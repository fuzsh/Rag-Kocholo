That is not to say that pre-twentieth-century Irish children's texts do not exist, but within the tradition of Irish literature as a whole, there have been relatively few appreciable and enduring works of children's literature written by native Irish authors. Overshadowed for centuries by the publishing predominance of the United Kingdom, Ireland witnessed a \"literary revival\" in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, thanks in large part to the contributions of such noted authors as Lady Augusta Gregory, Maria Edgeworth, and Oscar Wilde. However, even with the Literary Revival, Ireland still struggled to establish a cohesive national literature in the early twentieth century due to decades of political turmoil and cultural neglect. The course of Irish history in the twentieth century was filled with repeated conflict and struggle, born in part from attempts to create an independent Irish state and the resulting conflicts that flourished due to the separation of Ireland into two distinct entities: the autonomous Republic of Ireland and the six colonies of Northern Ireland under the stewardship of the United Kingdom. As the nation's political strife settled near the end of the century, more and more Irish authors began delving into the genre of children's literature, mining the nation's mythological, cultural, linguistic, and contemporary history to create works that appeal to children both in Ireland and abroad. With the recent record growth of Irish publishing houses independent from their larger cousins in England, Irish children's literature is finally thought to be offering both the quantity and quality of works worthy of Ireland's literary heritage, although continuing economic and political issues do remain.\n\nWhile mythology and folklore have long been a hallmark of the Irish cultural heritage, there has been some debate surrounding what constitutes Ireland's first official work of children's literature. Many historians regard Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) as one of the first authentically Irish children's texts. Although Swift initially intended the book as an adult work, the fantastic tone and universal theme of the work so appealed to children that its ascendancy into the pantheon of children's literature, in retrospect, now seems inevitable. Another candidate for the honor of \"first\" Irish children's story is the commonly anthologized ninth-century poem \"Pangur Bán\" (\"White Pangur\"), a simple rhyming tale of a monk's cat named White Pangur. Perhaps the first Irish work published solely to appeal to a young audience is The History of Goody Two Shoes (1765), likely written by Oliver Goldsmith, an Irish writer known primarily for writing novels for adults, particularly The Vicar of Wakefield (1766). The next significant Irish author to write for children was Maria Edgeworth, a writer of moral tales set amongst high society. She is also the author of Castle Rackrent (1800), often considered the first historical novel of the modern era. Among her best known children's works are The Parent's Assistant; or, Stories for Children (1796) and Early Lessons (1801). Edgeworth was active in Irish political affairs throughout her life, and these thematic concerns found their way into her stories for children. Celia Keenan has argued that, \"conscious educational and political intentions of Maria Edgeworth characterize her children's fiction in the first half of the 19th century, a period dominated by Irish writers, who unlike those of America, Britain, and Continental Europe, are now of merely academic interest.\" Edgeworth's juvenile fiction is distinctly Irish in both tone and setting, despite her English origins, and reflect a high point in the Irish canon, before the growing influence of the British Empire would begin to overtake and overshadow most Irish culture. In 1800 the English and Irish Parliaments passed the Act of Union which merged Ireland and Great Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and thus, Ireland came under direct English rule. As a result, Irish nationalism flourished in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, even during such cataclysmic events as Ireland's Great Famine of the 1840s, which decimated the Irish population. Meanwhile, also during the nineteenth century, England was experiencing the \"Golden Age\" of children's literature, in which English books for children reached an artistic peak under the guidance of such luminaries as Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway, and Walter Crane. However, as Keenan notes in her essay in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Ireland lacked a corresponding \"Golden Age\" within its own borders and was instead forced to import children's works from England, suggesting that both England's political dominance and the devastating effects of the Great Famine helped limit the ability of Ireland to further develop a prototypical Irish national literature for children. As the nineteenth century came to a close, the noted Irish-born wit Oscar Wilde offered a welcomed break from this relative literary paucity, releasing several works of innovative fairy tales clearly influenced by both his Irish religious heritage and the folk traditions espoused by his mother, an Irish author herself who wrote under the pseudonym of \"Sperenza.\" Combining the spirit of myth with overt religious morality, these stories—including such better known tales as \"The Selfish Giant\" and \"The Nightingale and the Rose\"—are still widely anthologized today.\n\nBy the dawn of the twentieth century, Ireland was in the midst of the Irish Literary Revival, a trend which carried over into the genre of children's literature. Spurred in part by nationalism and a late nineteenth-century initiative to revitalize Irish as a viable spoken language, literary groups such as the Gaelic League began emphasizing the need for a uniquely Irish literature to accompany the growing Irish cultural revolution. Among the leaders of this movement were W. B. Yeats and Lady Augusta Gregory, both of whom issued children's tracts which helped revitalize the body of Irish juvenile literature. Cuchulainn of Muirthemne, Gregory's 1902 translation of the ancient Irish myth of Cuchulainn into poetic vernacular English—initially intended for use in Irish schools—remains among the best-known works of Irish children's literature to date. These gains in the prestige and awareness of Irish children's literature were unfortunately ill-timed, as the 1920 Irish War of Independence, a violent and jarring event in the island's already troubled history, made establishing a national children's literature a secondary concern. Máire West has lamented the fleeting influence of the Literary Revival on Irish children's literature, commenting that, \"[s]ynonymous with the Anglo-Irish literary renaissance in Ireland, there would appear to have been an equally thriving period of creativity in the production of children's books of specifically Irish nature, aimed at the British, Irish, and American markets. Such a situation seemed to augur well for the future development of a native Irish genre of children's literature written through the medium of English. However, the promise of a literary revival was never fulfilled with regards to children's literature.\" The aftermath of the War of Independence led to Ireland being divided into two separate states—the self-governing and largely Catholic Republic of Ireland and the largely Protestant Northern Ireland, which remained under British rule. The partition of Ireland led to several more decades of political turmoil and bloodshed, beginning with the Irish Civil War of the 1920s. However, by the 1940s, a newly redeveloped sense of Irish national pride began to favor a greater presence of Irish culture as well as the rise of a limited second Irish literary revival of sorts. One of the immediate benefactors of this literary renewal was Eilís Dillon, who wrote over fifty young adult novels characterized by distinctly Irish protagonists, fashioning a canon that Keenan has suggested, \"enshrined the west of Ireland and Gaelic culture as proper bridges between traditional and modern societies.\" Still, the growth of a uniquely Irish children's canon remained relatively stunted within the boundaries of Irish literature throughout much of the century. Ciara Ní Bhroin has stated that, \"the promise of the Literary Revival was unfortunately not achieved in relation to Irish children's literature, which was characterised by its national orientation rather than its literary innovation. It was not until the 1980s, with the growth of an indigenous publishing industry for children's books, that a renaissance occurred in Irish children's literature. Nevertheless, the Revival marked the beginning of a fascination with myths, legends and folktales which remains prevalent in Irish children's literature today.\" It should be noted that the dearth of native Irish children's works in the early to mid-twentieth century existed in sharp contrast to the burgeoning wealth of world-renowned Irish adult writers for which Ireland was becoming increasingly famous, among them, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Frank O'Connor, Cathal Ó Sándair, and Seamus Heaney. Valerie Coghlan has explained this disparity between Irish adult and children's literature by asserting that, \"much of the best of adult Irish literature rebels against and frequently rejects the constraints of society in which the authors grew to maturity, and until very recently this questioning spirit would not have been acceptable in contemporary Irish children's books.\"\n\nAs a body of literature as a whole, perhaps the most important inspiration for the distinctive voice of Irish children's literature is the country's strong heritage of myth and legend—the resounding tales of the god-like Tuatha Dé Danann, the great hero Cúchulainn, the warring Fir Bolg, and the spirited faerie folk and leprechauns that reputedly dwell in the island nation. While these folktales are largely cultural in origin, born from Ireland's proud bardic tradition, they have been co-opted with relish by Irish children who revel in the daring adventures of their national heroes and the spirited lives of the hidden magic folk. Borrowing heavily from the four major cycles of Irish mythology—defined as the Mythological Cycle, The Ulster Cycle, the Fenian Cycle, and the Historical Cycle—Irish children's literature has been far more preoccupied with the nation's cultural folklore and legends than any of its adult counterparts. Cormac Mac Raois has suggested that, \"[j]ust as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels survives in the popular mind as an engaging children's fantasy with mild ironic overtones rather than the biting adult satire it originally was, so many of the ancient, mythological tales survive mainly in the realm of children's literature, only occasionally finding expression in adult form through drama, art, music, or texts of scholarly interest.\" In part, this reliance on myth was often a ploy by authors to instill nationalistic tendencies in Irish children. Ciara Ní Bhroin has argued that such works as Lady Gregory's Cuchulainn of Muirthemne were written with the idea that \"raising the consciousness of the young is a powerful way of shaping the future of a nation.\" Similarly, Ní Bhroin has noted the efforts of critic Daniel Corkery in the 1930s to establish an indigenous literature that \"would decolonize the minds of Irish children by inculcating in them a distinctive Irish identity.\"\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s witnessed a widespread renewed interest in Irish children's books, abetted in part by an increasingly strong and viable Irish publishing industry, for the first time existing separately from the formidable English publishing tradition. For Siobhán Parkinson, this change in the fabric of Irish publishing was a refreshing development, harkening a \"steadily growing range of books written by Irish writers, set in Irish contexts, featuring Irish characters, and published in Ireland for Irish children, some of them in the Irish (Gaelic) language. Now, in addition to continuing easy access to British children's literature, Irish children have the option of reading about their own experience and their own country, and this can only be counted a Good Thing.\" The economic boom that swept through the nation in the late 1990s further strengthened the abilities and desire of Irish publishing houses to offer culturally manifest works marketed exclusively to an Irish readership. While the boom has since leveled out—which led to a slight decrease in children's publishing due in part to reduced national spending—the gains achieved over the course of the past twenty years have revitalized both the interest in and worldwide recognition of the national canon of Irish juvenile literature. However, some critics have warned of the external pressures that will inevitably accompany the more global presence of Irish children's literature. Celia Keenan has suggested that, \"the effects of globalization can be clearly seen in that their subsequent work is less obviously Irish both thematically and in its frame of reference. On a more positive note, the interrelated threads of writing in Irish ad English are perhaps stronger in the 21st century than in earlier times, and awareness of children's literature continues to grow.\" As testament to the renewed vigor of Irish children's publishing, the industry has recently seen the emergence of an ancillary tier of magazines, associations, and awards dedicated exclusively to works by Irish authors. Among the agencies supporting the viability of Irish children's literature are: Children's Books in Ireland, a biannual publication devoted exclusively to Irish works (later renamed Inis); two national literary awards; the Bisto Book of the Year Award and the Reading Association of Ireland Award; and a national children's literature organization called the Irish Society for the Study of Children's Literature. Of this increased support for children's literature, Siobhán Parkinson has asserted that these changes are \"due partly to the efforts of the publishers and writers themselves, partly to Arts Council and other government support (royalties for creative artists are tax-free), and largely to the growth in both the Irish economy and the Irish sense of self-esteem, particularly in cultural areas. It is one marker of the coming-of-age of a nation which, not all that long ago, exercised such draconian censorship that many of its writers fled its shores; and over which loomed the shadow of a richer, stronger neighboring country that was a world center for English-language publishing.\"\n\nREPRESENTATIVE WORKS\n\nBrendan Behan\n\nThe King of Ireland's Son [illustrations by P.

Words like wonderful and great will be used, whether or not such adjectives are remotely justified by one's work—the mere fact of doing it is, apparently, praiseworthy in itself, rather in the way that giving money to the poor is, or being kind to the infirm. One will be told at length, with much sorrowful shaking of the head and as if the speaker is the first person to have had this piercing (and wildly inaccurate) insight, how dreadful it was \"when we were children—nothing but Enid Blyton.\"\n\nThere is in fact an honorable tradition in Ireland of writing for children, going right back to Maria Edgeworth. (Perhaps honorable is not quite the word—or, on second thought, perhaps it is rather too accurate.) Indeed, though its status as a children's book is questionable, we might even go back as far as Gulliver's Travels. Still (for all sorts of reasons, political, economic, and cultural), the Irish tradition of writing for children is quite a thin one, certainly by comparison with that of our nearest neighbor. When people say \"nothing but Enid Blyton,\" what they mean is that, with some exceptions (notably Patricia Lynch), there was very little writing for children here between the foundation of the state (1922) and the current so-called flowering of Irish writing and publishing for children. Most Irish adults, even those now only in their thirties, relied very heavily in childhood on whatever was being written for and read by children in Britain. We all grew up not only on Enid Blyton but also on William and Jennings, Paddington and Pooh, Greyfriars and the Chalet School, Biggles and the Borrowers. It was not exclusively a British diet, to be sure: we had access to a certain little house on the prairie, and we had heroines like Pollyanna, Anne, and Caddie; we had the March sisters, too, and the Hardy Boys and the Bobbsey Twins (the last deliberately imported from America in the mid-century, as Professor of Anglo-Irish Literature Declan Kiberd has said, in order to divert Irish children from perfidious British influence). But by and large, the world we read about was a British one.\n\nIt might be expected that the sheer volume of English fiction we read would have tended to suggest, even in vehemently-differentiated-from-England, Catholic nationalist Ireland, that England represented the norm. And it's true that we accepted this world of nannies and nursery teas, boarding schools and (field) hockey matches, vicarages and village fetes; words—like poorly, pillar-box, Father Christmas, and apple pie—that an Irish child would be unlikely to use or even to hear much (it's always apple tart in this country, whether or not it has a top crust); place names like Maidstone and Piccadilly Circus; and things like anchovy toast, Guy Fawkes Day, the Tube, Yorkshire pudding, and Hadrian's Wall.\n\nWe did accept all this, but not as the norm. We knew it was alien, exotic even. What happened in books was not what happened in experience, not because the books were fantasies, but because the experience they described was somebody else's. We didn't think of it like that, of course. It was just what went on \"in books.\"\n\nBeing, as far as we were concerned, a mythical place, the England of our childhood reading was perhaps more enchanting for us than it was for the children for whom it was a reality. It was even a little disappointing to grow up and find that the Tube, for example, actually exists. I still find walking around London rather disconcerting: I cannot bring myself fully to believe that it wasn't all invented by E. Nesbit. Indeed, to find that London is real is almost as surprising as it might be to discover that Narnia is the next station after Mornington Crescent.\n\nSince the 1980s, though, we have a steadily growing range of books written by Irish writers, set in Irish contexts, featuring Irish characters, and published in Ireland for Irish children, some of them in the Irish (Gaelic) language. Now, in addition to continuing easy access to British children's literature, Irish children have the option of reading about their own experience and their own country, and this can only be counted a Good Thing.\n\nNowhere is this more salient than in the area of historical fiction, and it is hardly a coincidence that the first wave of the recent resurgence of Irish children's literature contained a high proportion of fictional accounts of events in Irish history. One reason for this burst of Irish historical novels for children is surely that historical fiction is easily identifiable as the area in which Irish children's need for a literature of their own is most acute; and indeed, historical fiction is the area in which Irish children's authors have been most sure-footed in their writing and in which Irish children have been best served by their writers.\n\nMartin Waddell (a.k.a. Catherine Sefton), who is Northern Irish, claims to feel left out of the Irish children's book world. In fact he is much respected in the Republic, and it is not his Northern Irishness that tends to set him somewhat apart. When we talk about this recent flowering of Irish children's books, Waddell is sometimes overlooked, not because he is regarded as not-Irish, but because he has been flowering away all along. Moreover, and this is more important, he is published principally in Britain, rather than in Ireland, and it is this, along with his international reputation, that removes him slightly from the general Irish children's book scene, where international recognition is slow and the home market is the main focus of attention.\n\nThis perceived outsideness of Waddell and of Sam McBratney, who is also Northern Irish and also published mainly outside Ireland (and those facts are surely related), points up an essential feature of the current wave of Irish children's writing: it may not be entirely fair to say that the phenomenon has been publisher-driven, but it is certainly true that the growth and success of Irish publishers and their commitment to developing their children's lists has been crucial. Without the activities of a corps of Irish publishing houses publishing for children and marketing and publicizing Irish children's books, it is very likely that there would have been no \"flowering\" of Irish children's literature in the past decade or two.\n\nThe success in recent years of Irish children's publishing is due partly to the efforts of the publishers and writers themselves, partly to Arts Council and other government support (royalties for creative artists are tax-free), and largely to the growth in both the Irish economy and the Irish sense of self-esteem, particularly in cultural areas. It is one marker of the coming-of-age of a nation which, not all that long ago, exercised such draconian censorship that many of its writers fled its shores; and over which loomed the shadow of a richer, stronger neighboring country that was a world center for English-language publishing.\n\nIf a certain level of economic stability and national self-confidence is a necessary condition for the existence of a thriving children's book culture, the activity of the children's book community is vital for its sustenance. Children's Books Ireland, an association of people professionally or personally interested in children's books, is the most general and accessible organization devoted to promoting children's books in this country. It publishes a twice- / thrice-yearly reviewing journal and runs seminars and similar events. CBI is of particular value to children's writers as a forum where they can meet, socialize, and exchange information. It comes in for criticism at times, but CBI remains at the heart of activity and thinking in the area of children's books in this country.\n\nPart of CBI's work is the organization of the annual Bisto Book of the Year Award (£1500), with ancillary merit awards (£500 each). Along with the Reading Association of Ireland Award (which also has an ancillary merit award and is biennial and non-monetary), the Bisto serves to focus the thinking of those interested in children's books on the notoriously slippery concept of standards. As is the way with awards, not everyone agrees with the decisions of the judging panels, but both awards get it roughly right most of the time (at least if we extend our consideration to the shortlists rather than concentrating exclusively on the winners), and there is no doubt that the awards have played an important role in the setting and maintaining of standards in Irish children's publishing.\n\nThe main problem surrounding these awards is lack of media coverage and lack of debate. The shortlists are announced regularly; regularly they are completely ignored. The winners may be mentioned in the press, or the authors' photographs published (the most recent Bisto winner even made it onto TV), but the books themselves are almost never discussed. Children's book people the world over will no doubt recognize this pattern, but the case is surely worse here than is general: utter silence on the subject of the shortlists; a brief notification (sometimes) of the winners; and a single, controversial article some years ago challenging the choice of winner, by a journalist whose motivation seemed to be largely extraliterary.\n\nIndeed, CBI's own magazine, Children's Books in Ireland, serves us not much better in this regard. The shortlist is published in advance (sometimes barely in advance) of the announcement of the award, but the magazine publishes neither any consideration of the shortlist's deficiencies and omissions, nor any assessment of the books shortlisted, nor any speculation on the likely winners, nor any reaction to the choice of winners—none of the sort of coverage that is normal with regard to literary awards.\n\nThis seems to me to be a serious state of affairs. If children's books are forced to continue to exist in a ghetto, where coverage of awards is practically nonexistent and reviewing is, on the one hand, polite (as, with honorable exceptions, it tends to be in Children's Books in Ireland) and, on the other, both sparse and superficial (as, again with honorable exceptions, it tends to be in the general media), then this flowering of Irish children's books that we are all so busy admiring is in danger of running to seed. What, after all, is a flowering? Does it consist in a large number of books being published? Or has it something to do with quality? And who declares a flowering to be that, and not just a takeover by weeds?\n\nAuthors need considered responses to their books, and supplying these is surely one important function of the reviewing process. The composite reviews that the newspapers are so fond of, consisting largely of instant plot summaries of several titles, come into a category not far removed from advertising and serve a marketing function only (though there are reviewers who manage to say a lot in a paragraph).\n\nI can think of several Irish children's writers who were well regarded not many years ago and who no longer write for children. Writers move on to other things, of course; that is to be expected, and there are new authors coming up to take their place all the time; but perhaps the loss of more than a few of our best children's writers is one warning signal that everything is not entirely rosy in the garden. Whether this has to do with lack of recognition, lack of finance, or disillusionment with publishers, we can only speculate.\n\nAnother warning signal is that, although the number of Irish publishing houses establishing children's lists is growing, one of our two largest publishers of Irish children's books, Poolbeg, seems to have withdrawn sharply from this area of publishing, leaving a single publisher, O'Brien Press (my own publisher, incidentally), dominating the market in Irish children's books. Other publishers active to varying degrees in children's books include Blackwater, The Children's Press, Mentor, Mercier, Wolfhound Press, and several Irish-language publishers. Wolfhound is O'Brien's closest rival, but publishes considerably fewer children's books annually. O'Brien is a fine publisher with an excellent children's list, but it is not good, either for children's books in general or for the publisher itself, for any one publisher to be pushed into such a position of dominance.\n\nAnother threat to the health of Irish children's publishing is the recent trend for Irish writers of children's books to look to Britain for publishing opportunities. It is difficult for Irish publishers to compete with the advances and markets that British publishers can offer (it is notoriously difficult for Irish publishers to penetrate the British market, which is already oversupplied with titles; conversely, it is difficult to do deals with British publishers, who are reluctant to separate their territory, which they perceive as including Ireland, into British and Irish components), and it is unreasonable to expect writers to turn down these opportunities. But there is a danger, however remote, that Irish publishers—all small and independent—could eventually be forced out of children's books.\n\nPerhaps a more likely outcome is the development of a two-tier system, where the \"best\" Irish children's books are published in Britain—that is to say, the books considered \"best\" by large, market-driven British publishing houses—leaving books of a distinctively local appeal, and perhaps the books of new Irish writers, to the Irish publishers. This might seem an ideal compromise, for Irish publishers are bound to benefit if authors on their lists become big names in the British market; but in the long run Irish publishers, confined to a particular, more locally appealing type of children's book, might not have the range to build credible children's lists.\n\nNo child growing up in this country today is offered \"nothing but Enid Blyton\"—even if we take Blyton to stand for the whole of British children's books. And Irish children's publishing is visibly thriving. But there are threats and pressures, and even gardens in full flower—in fact, especially ones in full flower—need assiduous tending.\n\nCiara Ní Bhroin (essay date 2005)\n\nSOURCE: Ní Bhroin, Ciara. \"Championing Irish Literature.\" Bookbird 43, no. 2 (2005): 13-21.\n\n[In the following essay, Ní Bhroin relates the pioneering role that Lady Augusta Gregory's Cuchulainn of Muirthemne played in the development of the Irish Literary Revival and the genre of Irish children's literature in general.]\n\nLady Augusta Gregory (1852–1932) was a leading member, along with the poet W. B. Yeats, of the Irish Literary Revival. She took a passionate interest in the Irish language, collected folktales, wrote several plays and was a founder member of the Abbey Theatre. In 1902, she published Cuchulainn of Muirthemne, a translation of the ancient Irish myth of Cuchulainn into a poetic vernacular English, intended for use in Irish schools. Now mainly of antiquarian or academic interest, Cuchulainn of Muirthemne was nevertheless a seminal book of the Revival and a rare instance of the innovative influence of Irish children's literature on that for adults.\n\nIn his influential essay 'On National Culture' Frantz Fanon (1961) argues that national consciousness is a precursor to international consciousness and that both should be informed by a humanist philosophy based on consciousness of social and political needs. Central to his theory of decolonisation is that 'the building of a nation is of necessity accompanied by the discovery and encouragement of universalizing values'. 'Far from keeping aloof from other nations', he argues, 'it is national liberation which leads the nation to play its part on the stage of history.'\n\nIn relation to the stage of international literature, it is certainly true that Ireland's greatest contribution was produced at a time of national awakening, a time that has come to be known as the Irish Literary Revival. An increasingly crisis-ridden Home Rule campaign had caused disillusionment with parliamentary politics in Ireland at the turn of the 20th century and led to the birth of local self-help initiatives (Mathews 2003). In tandem with activity in other areas was an increased cultural activity, much of which aimed at transcending the sectarian and political division of the time through evoking a shared glorious and heroic ancient past. Charles Stewart Parnell's charismatic leadership and tragic demise in 1891 no doubt inspired the cult of the tragic hero which permeates the literature of the Revival and is embodied in the archetypal image of Cuchulainn.\n\nTransformative and Subversive Translation\n\nA member of the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy, Lady Gregory was uncharacteristic of her class in her passion-ate nationalism. Cuchulainn of Muirthemne was written primarily to repudiate statements made by Drs Atkinson and Mahaffy of Trinity College in response to the demands of the distinguished Gaelic scholar, Douglas Hyde, that Irish language and literature be taught in secondary schools. They claimed that Irish literature lacked imagination and idealism, was generally either silly or obscene and should therefore not be introduced into the school system (O'Connor 1984; Kiberd 2000). Determined to defend the integrity of Irish literature and to prove Atkinson and Mahaffy wrong, Lady Gregory undertook the task of translating transcripts of the Cuchulainn tales recorded by Eugene O'Curry and collating them with other manuscripts, primarily those of Stokes, De Jubainville and Kuno Meyer.\n\nFinding that the different versions lacked coherence, Gregory selected sections from many manuscripts, inserting a few sentences of her own to impose unity on the work as a whole. The result of her labours, Cuchulainn of Muirthemne, is characterised not only by the qualities of imagination and idealism, but also by the 'Kiltartanese' dialect (Hiberno-English as spoken in Lady Gregory's home area of Kiltartan, County Galway) in which it is written. This, more than anything else, distinguishes Cuchulainn of Muirthemne from previous translations into English of ancient Irish sagas and transforms the act of translation itself.\n\nFor other Anglo-Irish writers, such as Charlotte Brooke, Samuel Ferguson and Standish O'Grady, translation was an act of unification, a means of uniting Anglo-Irish and native Irish through a shared ancient culture and of enhancing esteem and partnership between Ireland and England within the context of Empire. Matthew Arnold's (1919) theories on the complementary natures of Celt and Saxon lent weight to a vision of union that accommodated and indeed encouraged Celtic difference. Though they embraced ancient Irish culture, the underlying motives of Brooke, Ferguson and O'Grady—the preservation of their own class and the naturalising of landlord-tenant relationships—were not very different from those of writers such as Maria Edgeworth, who rejected native tradition in favour of modern imperial progress. Indeed, Cairns and Richards (1988) describe the explicit identification of many Ascendancy intellectuals with Irish culture as a deliberate strategy amounting to 'little less than an act of cultural appropriation', an attempt to shape and control the emerging discourse in the interests of their own class.\n\nLady Gregory's translation of the Cuchulainn saga was subversive in a number of ways. Firstly, it was a deliberate challenge to the Trinity College professors who wished to denigrate Irish culture, an attempt to subvert the ideological control of the Trinity College establishment, which upheld the imperial values of a privileged class. To those who held the imperialist's contempt for the native culture and equally to those who enthusiastically sought to absorb its 'otherness' into imperialist hegemony, Lady Gregory intended to pose a challenge. She wished to validate native Irish culture through use of epic mythology and to show that this rich heritage was not the preserve of scholars and academics, but could be enjoyed by the masses through a living and distinctively Irish literature.\n\nLady Gregory's inclusiveness, her desire to make epic material available to the peasantry and to children—a powerless and often marginalised audience—was a direct contradiction of those, like Standish O'Grady, who urged writers 'to leave the heroic cycles alone and not to bring them down to the crowd' (Kiberd 2000). In her 'Dedication of the Irish Edition to the People of Kiltartan', she very deliberately addresses a native audience, a small local community, in an act that is the very antithesis of the provincialism which looks to the imperial capital. While distancing herself from the Trinity College establishment, she closely identifies herself with the local community in a manner similar to that of the oral storyteller.\n\nHowever, Lady Gregory's description of herself in the book under discussion as 'a woman of the house, that has to be minding the place, and listening to complaints, and dividing her share of food' highlights the difficulty of the Ascendancy intellectual who wishes to identify with the native peasantry. Fanon has described the precarious position of the native intellectual wishing to reconnect with the peasantry, but alienated by an assimilative colonial education. The position of the Anglo-Irish intellectual, who was both settler and native, was doubly precarious, however. Any attempt by Lady Gregory to identify with the peasant perspective, particularly her use of dialect, involved the risk of unconsciously appearing patronising. Nevertheless, her desire to do so, however precarious, deserves acknowledgement, as does her use of dialect as an empowering means of self-expression. Indeed, what is most subversive about Cuchulainn of Muirthemne is the way in which it reshapes the imperial language.\n\nReshaping the Imperial Language\n\nIn his preface to Gregory's Cuchulainn, W. B. Yeats writes of the difficulty he had experienced in writing stories of medieval Irish life with no language available to him but 'raw, modern English'. The search for a fitting language to express ancient Irish experience and a new awakening Irish consciousness was the challenge facing Irish writers in the English language. Fanon (1961) has drawn attention to the problem facing the native artist trying to create an authentic cultural work using the imperial language and derived forms: 'He contents himself with stamping these instruments with a hall-mark which he wishes to be national, but which is strangely reminiscent of exoticism.' Ironically, emphasising the otherness of Irish writing, through use of dialect and through a stress on ancient spirituality, fed into imperial notions of Irish exceptionalism, as expounded by the theories of Matthew Arnold in particular. Yet such an emphasis seemed necessary in order to establish Irish distinctiveness and therefore justify the claim to a separate national identity.\n\nLady Gregory was hugely influenced in her choice of idiom by the prose translations in Douglas Hyde's Love Songs of Connacht (1893). Recognising the literary potential of a distinctively Irish rendering of the English language, Lady Gregory tried to evolve a style deriving partly from the speech of the local community of Kiltartan and partly from her knowledge of the Irish language and her experience of translation. The resulting idiom had the advantage of seeming truer to the original transcripts than previous translations, closer to the native oral tradition and similar to a living, though transitional dialect of peasants who still thought in Irish. While Standish O'Grady related the epics in a formal, apocalyptic style, using elegant Victorian English and little dialogue, Lady Gregory's aristocratic heroes and heroines speak in a peasant idiom, yet with ancient nobility. This is particularly effective in the laments throughout the book, those of Deirdre, Ferb and Emer and Cuchulainn's laments on the deaths of Ferdiad and of his son Conlaoch. The idiom captures the raw personal grief and elegiac dignity of the caoineadh (lament).\n\nIn radically altering the English language to give a new voice to awakening national consciousness, translations such as those of Hyde and Lady Gregory 'mark a transition from translation as an act of exegesis to translation as an agent of aesthetic and political renewal. Translations no longer simply bore witness to the past; they were to actively shape a future' (Cronin 1996).\n\nDecolonising the Future\n\nThe association of myth with the sacred and of epic with the heroic made Lady Gregory's choice of form alone an effective answer to any allegations of lowness of tone or lack of idealism in Irish literature. Irish mythology evoked an ancient Gaelic civilisation equal to that of Greece or Rome, with the added advantage of being relatively unknown to the modern world and therefore wonderfully new and unused. While literary critics of the time such as John Eglinton (1899) questioned the relevance to a modern literature of legends 'which cannot be transplanted into the world of modern sympathies', Fanon (1961) has shown that the reclamation of the past through myth is vital to the process of decolonisation. In delving into the pre-colonial past, the writer uncovers 'beyond the misery of today … some very beautiful and splendid era', whose existence 'rehabilitates the nation' and 'serves as a justification for the hope of a future national culture'. The past, therefore, is recovered with an eye to the future.\n\nThat Cuchulainn of Muirthemne was written for children is doubly significant: raising the consciousness of the young is a powerful way of shaping the future of a nation. In his study of Levi-Strauss's structural analysis of myth, Edmund Leach (1974) emphasises the important role of myth in conveying the ancient collective wisdom of a society to its junior members. As a vehicle of continuity between the ancestors and descendants of a race or nation, myth is a powerful antidote to the disruptive force of colonialism.\n\nFurthermore, as a source of national 'rehabilitation' or salvation, myth is endowed with sacred significance. Terence Brown (1991) writes that\n\nCultural nationalism invests the records of the past with the spiritual charge of the sacred. Archaic texts are not simply archaeological remnants; they are chapters in the sacred book of the people.\n\nThis is evident in Yeats's preface to Cuchulainn of Muirthemne, in which repeated references to the Bible, along with numerous classical allusions, emphasise the book's symbolic significance. Indeed, his close association of the people, the land and the sacred has echoes of the Old Testament in particular. Just as Abraham led the chosen people to the Promised Land, and Moses delivered them out of slavery in Egypt, the Revival writers aspired to reconnect the Irish people with their ancient past and with their native land, in order to awaken the national soul.\n\nCuchulainn as National Soul\n\nThe ultimate personification of national soul was Cuchulainn. Lady Gregory's Cuchulainn is characterised most notably by youth and vigour, but also by beauty, bravery and loyalty. He is semi-divine, son of the sun-god, Lugh, and of a human mother, Dechtire, and has access to the supernatural aid of the sidhe (fairy people) in times of trouble. Such qualities made him the ideal icon to regenerate a disillusioned and emasculated Ireland, traditionally figured as a poor old widow. Cuchulainn's supernatural conception and the wonderful boyhood deeds by which he earns his name anticipate his subsequent heroism. Indeed, he is still a boy when Cathbad the druid tells him, in Gregory's translation, that 'all the men in the whole world will some day have the name of Cuchulainn in their mouths'.\n\nCathbad's prophecy of great fame and early death establishes Cuchulainn as tragic hero on the very day he takes up arms. He is outrageously glorious in battle, defending Ulster single-handedly against the forces of Maeve and Ailell. In love, too, he is successful, wooing and winning the beautiful Emer through riddles and dangerous feats. Desirable to women and having numerous lovers, Cuchulainn's sexual vigour is directly antithetical to the prudish moral code that led to the denunciation of Parnell, whose relationship with a divorcée was considered scandalous.\n\nThe extent to which Lady Gregory herself subscribed to Victorian sensibilities in sanitising much of the sexual material of the saga is debatable. Indeed, P J Mathews (2003) argues that 'in some respects … Lady Gregory can be accused of internalising the colonial critiques of Mahaffy and Atkinson'. Undoubtedly, Lady Gregory did not want to leave her book open to any charges of 'indecency' or 'lowness of tone', an indication of the pressure felt by Irish writers following the Atkinson/Mahaffy controversy to prove the inherent purity and morality of Irish writing. That Cuchulainn of Muirthemne was intended for use in schools was also a major consideration—an early instance of the dilemma continually facing writers of children's literature and arising from the tension between the authenticity of a literary text and its perceived appropriateness to a juvenile audience.\n\nAs with all tragic heroes, Cuchulainn's sorrows are as great as his joys. His heart-rending battle with his boyhood friend, Ferdiad, is all the more tragic to the modern reader in the light of the Irish civil war, which broke out only twenty years after Cuchulainn of Muirthemne was first published. Most tragic of all is the unwitting killing of his son, Conlaoch, which is the subject of Yeats's play, On Baile's Strand (1904). The powerful image of Cuchulainn fighting the waves became for Yeats a symbol of the individual's struggle for heroism in a modern world.\n\nCuchulainn's death is in keeping with his life. Tying himself to a pillar in order to die fighting in an upright position, Cuchulainn is the ultimate Irish image of heroic self-sacrifice (see photo, p. 16). His short but intensely lived life exemplifies what Yeats (1902) writes of myths in general:\n\nThe great virtues, the great joys, the great privations come in the myths, and, as it were, take mankind between their naked arms, and without putting off their divinity.\n\nCuchulainn for Children\n\nDeclan Kiberd (2000) points out that all treatments of the Cuchulainn story are explorations of contemporary issues by means of a narrative set in the remote past. For Standish O'Grady, Cuchulainn served as an inspiring example of nobility to the Ascendancy class, while Yeats saw in him an inspiration to each individual to awaken an inner heroism. The Irish revolutionary Patrick Pearse saw in the young Cuchulainn a shining example for the youth of Ireland in particular and, more specifically, a means of inculcating patriotic fervour in his students at St Enda's boys' school. The obvious parallels with the Christian story, explored explicitly in Pearse's portrayal of Cuchulainn, lent weight to the cult of heroic self-sacrifice which inspired the revolutionaries of 1916.\n\nLady Gregory's portrayal, which omits some of the more grotesque accounts of Cuchulainn's occult powers, emphasises the hero's humanity. Without diminishing his heroism, she managed to create a character with whom modern readers could more easily identify. Moreover, since her intention was to demonstrate the idealism of Irish literature, it possibly seemed better to omit accounts of Cuchulainn's distortions, explaining instead that his appearance changed to that of a god.\n\nSubsequent treatments of Cuchulainn in children's literature emphasise not only his humanity, but, unsurprisingly, his boyhood heroism. Indeed, many focus exclusively on Cuchulainn's boyhood deeds and in particular on how he got his name (by killing a dog, whose role as guard-dog he subsequently had to take on, thus becoming 'Cú Chulainn', the hound of Culann).\n\nSymbol of Celtic Regeneration\n\nAll treatments of Cuchulainn, whatever their specific emphases, portray him as a symbol of regeneration. Furthermore, his heroic qualities rendered him the very antithesis of modern British philistinism and promoted an image of the romantic and noble Celtic spirit, at odds with a tawdry and essentially reductive modern world. Cuchulainn embodies what Arnold (1919) describes as the 'Titanism of the Celt, his passionate, turbulent, indomitable reaction against the despotism of fact', ironically the very quality which, according to Arnold, made the Celt unsuccessful in the material world and incapable of self-government. In promoting Arnold's image of the romantic Celt through a figure such as Cuchulainn, Revival writers were defining Irish national identity in discursive terms set by the colonial context.\n\nIrishness thus became the antithesis of Britishness. Since an increasingly industrialised and urbanised Britain was seen to epitomise modernity, Ireland was conceived of as rural, spiritual and traditional. Irish cultural nationalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, therefore, was profoundly reactionary, and its apparent antimodern cast drew censure, not only from critics like John Eglinton, but also from Irish writers such as George Moore and James Joyce. However, Fanon (1961) argues that this reactionary stage is part of the process of decolonisation. Through the reclamation of a pre-colonial native culture, the writer reconnects with the native population and accords their shared past the value denied it by the colonial power. Essentialism, in such a context, becomes a strategic step in the resistance of imperial hegemony.\n\nFor writers such as Lady Gregory and Yeats, myth was the key to imaginative repossession of the past as an inspiration for the future. Equally important, it was the key to emotional reconnection with local places and landmarks and, by implication, to imaginary repossession of the land. Yeats (1902) urges the Irish people to keep Cuchulainn and his friends 'much in our hearts' and says that 'If we will but tell these stories to our children the Land will begin again to be a Holy Land'.\n\nIrish Mythology and Children's Literature\n\nLady Gregory was one of the first of many writers to 'tell these stories' to Irish children in the English language; but the promise of the Literary Revival was unfortunately not achieved in relation to Irish children's literature, which was characterised by its national orientation rather than its literary innovation. It was not until the 1980s, with the growth of an indigenous publishing industry for children's books, that a renaissance occurred in Irish children's literature. Nevertheless, the Revival marked the beginning of a fascination with myths, legends and folktales which remains prevalent in Irish children's literature today.\n\nHowever, as Robert Dunbar (1996) points out, this inheritance\n\nin the hands of the less gifted writer … has proved to be more of an encumbrance than an inspiration. This is a genre which too easily lends itself to clichés and stereotypes, both linguistic and thematic.\n\nCormac Mac Raois (1997), himself a writer of Irish fantasy for children, has questioned—with echoes of Yeats's reservations regarding Lady Gregory's exclusion of some sexual passages from Cuchulainn of Muirthemne—the appropriateness of retelling for children myths originally intended for adults, when sanitisation compromises authenticity: 'In the further toning down required for children's versions there is a risk of presenting a narrative of unappealing blandness.' Certainly, the current outpouring of glossy 'Irish myths and legends' collections needs scrutiny. It arguably reflects the wider fashion of packaging Celtic culture as a marketable commodity—in other words, nativism for profit—rather than a need to reinvent and recreate our ancient past, and by implication ourselves.\n\nCuchulainn of Muirthemne was a seminal book in translating tradition at a key moment in Ireland's decolonisation and in laying the foundations for a national children's literature in the English language, which is today gaining increased international exposure. Today, the notion of Irish exceptionalism in children's literature is giving way to the exploration of Irish experience as representative of human experience. An increasingly global Anglo-American culture, however, raises new questions about national identity and cultural diversity in the new millennium. Perhaps we should bear in mind Fanon's (1961) argument that\n\nIt is at the heart of national consciousness that international consciousness lives and grows. And this two-fold emerging is ultimately the source of all culture.\n\nBibliography\n\nArnold, Matthew (1919) On the Study of Celtic Literature and Other Essays London: Dent.\n\nAshcroft, Bill, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin (1998) Key Concepts in Postcolonial Studies London: Routledge.\n\nBrown, Terence (1991) 'Cultural Nationalism' in Seamus Deane (ed) The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing II: 188-93, Derry: Field Day Publications.\n\nCairns, David and Shaun Richards (1988) Writing Ireland: Colonialism, Nationalism, and Culture Manchester: Manchester University Press.\n\nCronin, Michael (1996) Translating Ireland Cork: Cork University Press.\n\nDunbar, Robert (1996) 'Fantasy' in Valerie Coghlan and Celia Keenan (eds) The Big Guide to Children's Books pp 40-45, Dublin: Irish Children's Book Trust.\n\nEglinton, John (1899) 'National Drama and Contemporary Life' in Literary Ideals in Ireland, republished in Seamus Deane (ed) The Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing II, pp 959-60, Derry: Field Day Publications 1991.\n\nFanon, Frantz (1961) 'On National Culture' in The Wretched of the Earth London: Penguin 2001, originally published in France (in 1961) by Francois Maspéro as Les damnés de la terre.\n\nGregory, Lady Augusta (1902) Cuchulainn of Muirthemne London: John Murray, republished Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe 1970.\n\nKiberd, Declan (2000) Irish Classics London: Vintage.\n\nLeach, Edmund (1974) Levi-Strauss London: Fontana/Collins.\n\nMac Raois, Cormac (1997) 'Old Tales for New People: Irish Mythology Retold for Children' The Lion and the Unicorn 21: 330-40.\n\nMathews, P J (2003) Revival: The Abbey Theatre, Sinn Féin, the Gaelic League, and the Cooperative Movement Cork: Cork University Press.\n\nO'Connor, Ulick (1984) Celtic Dawn: A Portrait of the Irish Literary Renaissance London: Hamish Hamilton.\n\nSaid, Edward (1990) 'Yeats and Decolonisation' in Dennis Walder (ed) Literature in the Modern World pp 34-41, Oxford: Oxford University Press.\n\nYeats, William Butler (1902) Preface to Lady Augusta Gregory Cuchulainn of Muirthemne London: John Murray, republished Gerrards Cross: Colin Smythe 1970.\n\nCelia Keenan (essay date 2006)\n\nSOURCE: Keenan, Celia. \"Ireland.\" In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature, Volume 2, edited by Jack Zipes, pp. 296-99.

Though territorial, political, and religious divisions are reflected in Irish literature for children, it does not make literary sense to consider the literature only in that light.\n\nVerse\n\nThe 9th-century Old Irish poem \"Pangur Bán\" (White Pangur) figures in translation in many contemporary Irish anthologies for children or edited by Irish anthologists, including The Rattle Bag (1982), edited by Seamus Heaney and Ted Hughes, and Rusty Nails and Astronauts (1999), edited by Robert Dunbar and Gabriel Fitzmaurice. This charming poem about a scholar and his pet cat is probably the earliest example of Irish children's literature, and exemplifies its complex world. It is not known who wrote it, for whom it was written, when it was written, how it appears in manuscript, where it was written, or what other texts surround it. It is, however, indisputably a children's poem—more accessible and immediately resonant to young readers and much less oppressively didactic than works with similar themes such as Isaac Watts's \"Against Idleness and Mischief.\"\n\nIn spite of \"Pangur Bán\" and the later Anglo-Irish examples of Oliver Goldsmith's playful verse such as \"Elegy on the Death of a Mad Dog\" and the 19th-century Donegal poet William Allingham's evocative poems such as \"The Fairies,\" contemporary Irish writing for young people is surprisingly thin in poetry. Mathew Sweeney's verses reenact young adult cynicism in Fatso in the Red Suit (1995). Gabriel Rosenstock, an Irish-language poet, has written a large number of humorous and thought-provoking poems in a variety of forms for young people. Pulitzer Prize—winning poet Paul Muldoon, who has an international reputation for his adult poetry, also published two books of poetry for children, The Last Thesaurus (1995) and The Noctuary of Narcissus Batt (1997), both notable for the variety and playfulness of their form and the sophistication and inventiveness of their language.\n\nFiction\n\nIrish children's fiction has less ancient roots than Irish children's poetry, but it is more substantial and continuous—though no less resistant to clear definition. Gulliver's Travels (1726) is a good example: Swift's savage and ultimately despairing work was not written for children, nor is it, in its unabridged form, suitable for them. By contrast, Goody Two Shoes (1765), presumed to have been written by Oliver Goldsmith, is clearly intended for children. Both these works take their place in an Irish canon. The conscious educational and political intentions of Maria Edgeworth characterize her children's fiction in the first half of the 19th century, a period dominated by Irish writers who, unlike those of America, Britain, and Continental Europe, are now of merely academic interest. Conflicting Unionist and nationalist ideologies are pitted against each other as the century moves on.\n\nThere was no golden age of Irish children's literature in that most miserable century in Irish history, with the Great Famine at its center. Frances Browne created modest literary fairy tales in the mid century. However, between 1888 and 1892 Oscar Wilde followed the example of Hans Christian Andersen by creating literary fairy tales that charmed children and continue to worry adults. These have not yet received the full critical attention they deserve. Given their Irish, socialist, Catholic, masochistic, and homoerotic possibilities, they are arguably richer and more complex than Wilde's richest adult works. Wilde's stories profoundly affected the founding father of modern Irish militant nationalism, the passionate educationalist and writer Patrick Pearse. His stories in Irish, Íosagán agus Scéalta Eile (Iosagan and Other Stories, 1907), echo almost all of Wilde's themes and many of his images, but are more spare and simple in language. The influence of Wilde's stories, in particular of \"The Selfish Giant,\" is also evident in the work of the Belfast-born writer C. S. Lewis, creator of Narnia, the land \"where it is always Winter and never Christmas.\"\n\nSince the 19th century, Irish myth, legend, and folklore have continued to underpin much of what is written for children, and continue to be published with unabated popularity. Ella Young, Padraic Colum, Sinead de Valera, Liam MacUistín, Michael Scott, and Marie Heaney have been major contributors. The best-known illustrator of contemporary retellings is undoubtedly P. J. Lynch. Colmán Ó Raghallaigh and the Cartoon Saloon have published a stunning graphic novel in the Irish language, An Tóraíocht (The Hunt for Diarmuid and Gráinne, 2002). This modern version of a classic story speaks to the 21st century in its brutal and tragic power.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, an essentialist vision of a traditional Ireland finds its strongest expression in the fiction of Patricia Lynch. Subsequently Éilis Dillon enshrined the west of Ireland and Gaelic culture as proper bridges between traditional and modern societies, but in a literary landscape peopled by boy heroes and untouched by contemporary feminist thinking.\n\nThe Northern Ireland \"Troubles\" erupted in the late 1960s, and subsequently much children's literature illustrated the folly of sectarianism and extremism. The consistently best writing on this topic has come from within Northern Ireland itself, from three writers in particular: Martin Waddell, Sam McBratney, and Maeve Friel. Waddell's The Beat of a Drum presents a challenging and authentic view of a Loyalist community. McBratney in The Chieftains Daughter and Friel in Distant Voices view the present through the lens of the remote historical past.\n\nThe 1990s saw a rapid expansion in publishing for children in Ireland, which in the 2000s seems to be declining: some publishers have abandoned children's publishing, the number of books published has dropped dramatically, and state support for children's publishing has waned. It can only be hoped that writers whose work came to the fore in that period, including Marita Conlon-McKenna, Aubrey Flegg, Tom McCaughren, Mark O'Sullivan, Ré Ó'Laighléis, Siobhán Parkinson, and Gerard Whelan, can continue to write for children. British publishers have adopted a significant number of authors and illustrators who were initially published in Ireland, including Mary Arrigan, Eoin Colfer, Margaret Cruikshank, Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick, Maeve Friel, Kate Thompson, and Niamh Sharkey. This can be seen as a welcome development for writers as it offers them better rewards; however, the effects of globalization can be clearly seen in that their subsequent work is less obviously Irish both thematically and in its frame of reference. On a more positive note, the interrelated threads of writing in Irish and English are perhaps stronger in the 21st century than in earlier times, and awareness of children's literature continues to grow—as instanced in the activities of a range of societies such as Children's Books in Ireland and the recently formed Irish Society for the Study of Children's Literature.\n\nBibliography\n\nAnderson, Celia Catlett, and Robert Dunbar, guest eds.

If we further consider that these tales were current in the oral tradition for a significant period before that, their antiquity becomes even more impressive. In fact, the astonishing truth is that the roots of many of these stories lie in the mythologies of the Celts, who spread westward across Europe, settling in Ireland more than a thousand years before Christ.\n\nIt is therefore a matter of considerable importance that many of them still have currency in modern Ireland, though they have undergone a number of striking metamorphoses with the passage of time. Just as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels survives in the popular mind as an engaging children's fantasy with mild ironic undertones rather than the biting adult satire it originally was, so many of the ancient, mythological tales survive mainly in the realm of children's literature, only occasionally finding expression in adult form through drama, art, music, or texts of scholarly interest.\n\nThe impact of Irish mythology on modern children's literature is well attested to by the fact that there are at present at least thirty books dedicated to the retelling of mythological tales on the children's shelves of Irish book shops. There is also a growing number of contemporary children's magical adventure stories that draw upon mythological sources for their characters and themes.\n\nWhile this outpouring of mythology in the form of children's literature must, of course, be viewed in the context of the general resurgence in publishing that has occurred in Ireland over the past twenty years, the full explanation for the phenomenon lies in the nature of Irish mythology itself. These ancient tales offer us a window into the psyche of our ancestors as well as an inside view of early Celtic society, its manners and values, its whole way of life. As well as this, many of these stories concern themselves with the major themes and preoccupations of the mystery of humanity that lie at the heart of all great art and literature. Such an inheritance demands to be passed on.\n\nWhat is Irish mythology? Basically, we are talking about stories our ancestors told one another, stories that arose out of their understanding of themselves and of the society in which they lived. They had serious political, historical and religious (pre-Christian) significance for the tellers and their audience. These tales were handed down over the centuries, mainly in the oral tradition, and in the process have developed into a rich, complex, and oftentimes confusing body of work. What we know of Irish mythology is but a small fragment of a vast tradition. Kuno Meyer estimated in 1900 that up to six hundred sagas had survived in manuscript form, of which only one hundred and fifty had been translated and annotated (Ellis 8).\n\nModern scholars recognize this vast corpus of material as falling into four main categories: the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle, the Cycle of the Kings, and the Fianna Cycle. (See the appendix for a fuller explication of the plots and characters of these cycles.) Outside these four divisions there lies a vast store of what may be designated as \"folklore,\" including tales of animals, ghosts, saints, voyages, and, of course, leprechauns—although the last of these appear much less in Ireland than foreign preoccupation with them would suggest.\n\nRetelling the Tales\n\nWith such a wealth of characters and plots available it would be surprising if this resource were not exploited by writers and publishers. Fortunately, most of those who have represented these tales to the young have done so in a manner that indicates their own appreciation of their material and their desire to communicate their enthusiasm to others. That the ancients took their storytelling seriously is witnessed by the ruling of the Brehon Laws, Ireland's ancient legal code, that only qualified storytellers should relate these tales. The qualified storyteller should know at least two hundred main stories and one hundred substories by heart (Ellis 9)!\n\nThis is quite an impressive act to follow. To attempt to do so in the realm of children's literature is to take on an array of daunting challenges, on a par with those faced by the hero in any saga. In spite of this, some eighteen authors whose work is readily available today have accepted the challenge. But in surveying this body of work we must keep in mind certain constraints (the modern version of the ancient geis!) with which the writers have to contend.\n\nIn the first instance the originals are not children's stories. They reflect adult preoccupations of their time and their style and subject matter are designed for the adult listener. Violence and physical suffering are described in graphic, even gory, detail: entrails are spilled on the ground; warriors' heads are displayed as trophies of war. The tales' forthright sexuality reflects a pre-Christian lack of inhibition. While, for example, Cú Chulainn is receiving advanced training in the martial arts from Scáthach, her prophetic daughter Uathach gives him an equally good grounding in the art of love-making. When he overpowers Scáthach's female rival, Aife, he spares her life on condition that she bear him a son. All this occurs while our hero's betrothed—to whom he has promised to remain faithful—waits for him in Ireland. His was not exceptional conduct. Fionn Mac Cumhaill did not leave his sexual appetites unsatisfied either. (These texts were later copied by Christian monks who censored unacceptable paganisms. Considering what they left in, one can only wonder what must have been cut out!) In the further toning down required for children's versions there is a high risk of presenting a narrative of unappealing blandness. Some tales would be better reserved for older readers, who might be able to deal with more robust versions. Our young readers' appetite for mythology could well be spoiled by too thin a gruel served too soon.\n\nMuch of our mythology belongs to an oral tradition and the style and construction of the tales reflect this. The immediacy and drama of the spoken word can easily be lost in the written versions. Since an exact retelling will not do, a new style of narrative must be invented. The stories were also told in Irish—and Old Irish at that. The necessary translations for the largely English-speaking population of today lose much of the richness and power of the originals. Many of the ancient Gaelic names are now unfamiliar. Attempts at Anglicization further complicate the situation by throwing up differing versions of the same name. Thus Sadhbh is rendered Sive or even Saba, while one of the three sons of Tuireann (in the Dé Danann tale) appears variously as Uchar, Urchar, Lurchar, or lurcharba.\n\nAs one might expect in a tradition so ancient, many versions of the tales grew up in different localities and times. New tales were added, not always coherent with the already existing body of mythology. This is particularly true of the Dé Danann tales and the Fianna stories. Modern children are often irked by these varying, sometimes contradictory, versions. As many stories are presented in anthologies, the same tales turn up in differing combinations, causing further irritation. Thus, some of the more popular tales come to suffer from overexposure.\n\nThe style and content of the retelling are naturally affected by the age of the target readership, which may vary from eight to eighteen. While the writers may be motivated by a desire to pass on what is perceived as a valuable part of the national heritage, the young reader will primarily expect the story to be readable and enjoyable. Unless these latter criteria are satisfied all other aims will fail.\n\nAmong the first to attempt this feat of retelling the old stories for a young readership was Patricia Lynch, with her Tales of Irish Enchantment (1952). These stories have now been reissued in two volumes, Tales of Irish Enchantment and Enchanted Irish Tales. In all, thirty tales are told, including a full life story of Cú Chulainn and a well-rounded collection of eleven tales of Fionn Mac Cumhaill. While the outdated over-Anglicization of names—Kian for Cian, Mac Cool for Mac Cumhaill, Cullen for Culann—and the rather far-fetched use of Ultonians to describe the men of Ulster are a little off-putting, Lynch's narrative style is powerful, direct, and frequently charged with all the heroic emotion that imbues the original tales. It would be hard to better her final sentence in The Táin describing the death of Cú Chulainn: \"He died there, standing, with his face to his enemies, and the glory of Ulster died with him.\"\n\nLiam Mac Uistín, a Celtic scholar and writer and playwright, produced a version of The Táin in 1989, followed by Celtic Magic (a collection of four tales), and The Hunt for Diarmaid and Gráinne. Of all the retellings Mac Uistín's are the ones which will probably most please the purists. His narrative is more disciplined than Lynch's. His swift-moving, well-honed text keeps the action flowing. This is particularly true in The Hunt for Diarmaid and Gráinne, where the pace of the narration mirrors the speed of the pursuit. As well as this, Mac Uistín achieves a remarkable feat of fidelity to the original texts while keeping the language simple enough for young readers and the content suitable to their age.\n\nIn Irish Myths and Tales, Carolyn Swift has presented an anthology of fourteen tales, with samples from all four of the main mythological groupings. All are told with a deceptive simplicity, suiting them to a younger readership than many other versions. The appeal of the work is somewhat lessened by the publisher's failure to provide any illustration—even on the cover! The opposite may be said of Brendan Behan's version of The King of Ireland's Son, recently reissued with lavish illustration by P. J. Lynch. In this instance the artwork is of so high a quality that it almost overwhelms the text.\n\nThe O'Brien Book of Irish Fairy Tales and Legends is also beautifully produced, on quality paper, with very attractive illustrations by Susan Field. Una Leavy retells the tales with a quiet simplicity that is well complemented by the style and color tones of the illustrations. This is a book for readers too young to be exposed to the reality and ugliness of violence, treachery, and the destructiveness of selfishly indulged passions.\n\nBy far the most outstandingly prolific writer of children's mythology in Ireland today is Michael Scott. From his first venture into this field—a beautiful retelling of The Children of Lir—Scott has produced some twenty-six volumes of mythology retold or of mythologically based tales. Always professionally conscious of the age profile of his readership, Scott fleshes out the old tales, making them immediate and powerfully effective. Where Mac Uistín's narrative has the strength of discipline and fidelity, Scott's retellings have the feel of modern novels, with which the young will be instantly comfortable.\n\nLynch, Mac Uistín, and Scott have all published versions of The Quest of the Sons of Tuireann, in which the druid Cian turns himself into a pig in order to escape being slain. Lynch relates this incident as: \"At once he turned himself into a pig and joined the herd …\" (1952, 14). Mac Uistín writes, in Celtic Magic Tales:\n\nHe touched his own shoulder with the staff and changed into a wild boar. With a triumphant snarl he raced away through the trees. (28)\n\nBy contrast, Scott's version in The Quest of the Sons is magically graphic:\n\nCian threw off his white cloak, tossing it into some bushes along with his tunic and sword belt, followed by his sandals. Then he crouched down on his hands and knees on the ground, which had been churned into muck by the pigs. Resting both elbows in the filth, he dropped his head down until his chin almost touched the ground, and he drew his legs in tightly to his chest and stomach. And then something moved across his body, something white and misty … like a dusting of fine white powder…. As they watched it thickened and hardened into a crust, like ice or hard snow, until the outline of the man was lost.\n\nAnd then the crust cracked.\n\nThin black lines ran across its surface and chunks of it fell way—to reveal the body of a pig underneath! (16)\n\nEqually, Scott is not afraid to take liberties in order to increase his impact on his young audience, as for example his use of the boy Colum in The Last of the Fianna, where the boy joins Oisín in Tír na nóg and returns to Ireland with him, witnessing his sudden aging. Again, this gives the story a more child-centered, up-to-date tone. In his anthologies, such as Irish Fairy Tales, Irish Hero Tales, Irish Animal Tales, and Magical Irish Folk Tales, Scott skillfully uses brief prologues and epilogues with each tale to establish its context within the overall anthology and to make it intelligible to the young reader. Viewed from any perspective Scott has made a major contribution to the popularization of mythology for modern Irish youth.\n\nNo retelling of our old tales can ever be perfect. Children's versions will always be less than the originals, but in refashioning these old tales for new people our modern writers carry on a tradition that is thousands of years old and they ensure that at least an echo of the voice of our ancient ancestors still sounds among those who inhabit the land of Ireland today.\n\nAppendix\n\nThe four main categories into which the corpus of Irish myth is usually divided are as follows:\n\n1. The Mythological Cycle (The Invasion, or Dé Danann Tales)\n\nThis is a collection of stories dealing with other world beings, their main focus being the struggle between the Tuatha Dé Danann and the Fomhóire, a conflict between the divine and the demonic that parallels similar themes in Norse, Vedic, and Greek literature (Ó Hógáin 312). Two major battles are described, both occurring at Magh Tuireadh (Moytirra) in the west of Ireland. In the first, the Tuatha Dé Danann arrive in Ireland and overcome the inhabitants, the Fir Bolg, in a five-day battle. Written accounts of this collection date from the eleventh century A.D. In the second, the Fomhóire, a demonic race living to the north of Ireland, impose tribute on the country but are overcome by the Tuatha Dé at Moytirra. The first written account of this occurs in the eighth century A.D. Characters from these tales include:\n\nNuadhu: king of the Tuatha Dé. He lost an arm in the first battle and had to resign his kingship. On having a silver arm fitted by the physician Dian Ceacht he is reinstated as king.\n\nThe Daghdha: a god associated with hugeness, generosity, and large appetite. His magic cauldron can provide unlimited food. The rough end of his club can slay nine men together, while the smooth end can revive them.\n\nAonghus: son of the Daghda and Boinn, the goddess of the river Boyne. Aonghus lives at Brugh na Boinne, i.e., Newgrange, in Co Meath. He is associated with youth and love.\n\nOghma: brother of The Daghdha. He is associated with speech and poetry and credited with inventing ogham script.\n\nBalar (also Balor) of the evil eye: gigantic leader of the Fomhóire. A glance from his evil eye could destroy all who beheld it. He was killed at the second battle of Moytirra by his grandson Lugh, an event foretold that he had tried to prevent.\n\nLugh Lamhfhada ('long-armed'): master of all the arts. He led the Tuatha Dé in the second battle of Moytirra and slew his grandfather Balar by driving his evil eye through his head with a sling-stone. He is associated with the harvest. (\"Lughnasa\" is Irish for 'August'.) The second battle of Moytirra takes place at Samhain (November) when the sun (Balar) is overcome by dark winter (Lugh).\n\nManannan Mac Lir ('Son of the Sea'): originally not counted among the divine Tuatha Dé, but accepted as such by the tenth or eleventh century (Ó Hógáin 287). He is god of the sea and of inland waterways and rides his chariot over the waves. His country is known as Tír Tairngire (The Land of Promise), also as Eamhain Abhlach (The Region of Apples). He carries a branch with three golden apples, the music of which brings healing sleep to the ill. He organized the retreat of the Tuatha Dé Danann into the sidh ('fairy-forts') after their defeat by the son of Mil, the legendary ancestors of the Gaelic people.\n\nBadhbh, Mascha and the Mór-Ríoghain ('Morrigan'): a sisterly triad of goddesses of war, who fling showers of hailstones, javelins, and flails against the enemies of the Tuatha Dé and drain away the courage of warriors. They are shape changers, who foretell and attend on battle slaughter. Their memory lingers on in folklore in the form of the banshee who wails as a death warning.\n\nTwo well-known stories were tacked onto the older Dé Danann mythology. \"The Quest of the Sons of Tuireann,\" in which three sons are obliged to seek out seven heavily guarded treasures from various parts of the world, is a tenth-century development, while the more famous \"The Children of Lir,\" in which a jealous stepmother changes her four stepchildren into swans, is a fifteenth-century Irish version of a European folktale.\n\n2. The Ulster Cycle (or Rudhraigheacht)\n\nThis is a large body of heroic tales concerning the Ulaidh, after whom the province of Ulster is named. They call themselves the Rudhraighe ('Rightful occupiers'). Medieval writers confused the name with ruadh (red) and from this came the name Red Branch Knights as a description of the Ulster warriors (Ó Hógáin 413).\n\nThese tales involve incredible feats of military prowess, shape changing, magical prohibitions (geis), interventions by Lugh, the Morrigan and Badhbh, boasting, disputes about honor and explicit sexuality. They seem to have been particularly popular among the elite of society and survived more in the literary than in the oral tradition.\n\nThe central story is the Táin Bó Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley) which was recorded in writing as early as the seventh century. The earliest surviving texts are in Leabhar na hUidre (Book of the Dun Cow) and Leabhar Laighneach (Book of Leinster), both from the twelfth century. Together with the preparatory tales that lead up to The Táin and the romances that were added later to account for the subsequent fates of the main characters, the Ulster Cycle boasts an epic range and power comparable to the Iliad. The scholar Alfred Nutt has estimated that the literature of the Ulster cycle would occupy a volume of two thousand pages—even after all the repetitions were edited out (Ellis 11)!\n\nAmong the stories included in the preparatory tales are the following: how Conchobar is begotten and how he becomes King of Ulster; how the men of Ulster become afflicted with birth-pangs; Deirdre of the Sorrows and the exile of the Sons of Uisliu; how Cú Chulainn is begotten and reared; Cú Chulainn's courting of Emer and his training in arms with Scáthach in Scotland; Cú Chulainn's slaying of his own son; how the bulls are begotten.\n\nThe central story, the Táin Bó Cuailnge, tells of how Meadhbh, Queen of Connacht, invades Ulster to capture the Brown Bull of Cooley so that she will have a bull equal to her husband's white-horned one. The men of Ulster are stricken by a magical illness, leaving only the young warrior hero Cú Chulainn to stand against the invaders. This he does with great panache and prowess, all across the southern borders of Ulster. Many combats are recounted, including his confrontation with his former tutor Fearghus and his most famous single combat, against his foster-brother Fear Diadh, who has been tricked into fighting him. Eventually, the men of Ulster recover and Meadhbh is driven back into Connacht. She manages, however, to steal the Brown Bull. The Ulster bull meets the Connacht bull, kills it, and carries it back to Ulster on its horns. There, its heart bursts and it dies.\n\nThe subsequent tales include Cú Chulainn's death at the hands of the six children of Cailitín, a warrior he had killed during the war with Meadhbh. They trick him into breaking his geasa (magical prohibitions) and pierce him with a javelin.\n\n3. The Fianna Cycle (or Fiannaíocht)\n\nThis body of tales concerns Fionn Mac Cumhaill, the great warrior-seer and leader of the band of astonishingly skilled hunter-warriors known as the Fianna, who traveled around Ireland fighting invaders—especially Vikings—, dealing with other world intrusions or themselves intruding into the other world, rescuing the distressed, quarreling among themselves and generally expecting hospitality from whomever they met.\n\nOriginally associated with the cult of wisdom in the Boyne Valley, Fionn became popular in the province of Leinster and thereafter throughout Ireland as a mythical local, then national, champion. Stories about him and the Fianna are found in eighth-century texts but it is obvious that they were popular in the oral tradition well before that. While Cú Chulainn seems to have been the national hero up to the eleventh century, Fionn takes over after that (Ellis 11). Tales abound associating him with different localities. Thus the Fiannaíocht has been added to, developed, and enriched in a tradition that has extended into the present century, where Fionn appears, for example, in Joyce's Finnegans Wake and in O'Brien's At Swim-Two-Birds. The most notable Fiannaíocht tales include the following:\n\nFionn and the Salmon of Knowledge. This relates how as a boy Fionn is left in charge of a magical salmon caught in the River Boyne by the seer Finneageas. While supervising the cooking of the fish, Fionn burns his thumb, sucks it to ease the pain, and gets the gift of wisdom. Thereafter, when Fionn is in need of enlightenment, he chews upon his thumb.\n\nHow Fionn Takes Command of the Fianna. Fionn defeats the fire-breathing Aillen who had burned down the royal palace of Tara at every November feast. The grateful High King, Conn Céadchathach, appoints him head of the Fianna, displacing Goll Móirne who had slain Fionn's father before the hero's birth. While they cooperate on most occasions, tensions between the Morna clan and Fionn's clan are a recurring theme in the Fiannaíocht, as are strains on the Fianna's loyalty to the High King. Numerous battles are listed, among them one at Ventry, Co Kerry, dating from the twelfth century, where with great slaughter Fionn overcomes \"The King of the World\" with the support of the Tuatha Dé Danann. There are many stories of single combats, challenges to contests of prowess by strangers from overseas, entrapments in other world hostels, hunts with Fionn's favorite hounds, Bran and Sceolaing, and encounters with giants who are often overcome by trickery.\n\nTóraíocht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne (The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne). This tragic tale relates how the aging Fionn's young wife-to-be, Gráinne, daughter of King Cormac Mac Airt, elopes with the handsome young Fianna warrior, Diarmaid Ua Duibhne. The enraged Fionn pursues them all around Ireland, Diarmaid eventually falling victim to Fionn's spitefulness. It is noteworthy that the character of Fionn is so well developed in mythology that he passes from wondrous youth, through heroic manhood, to sad, even embittered, old age.\n\nOisín i d Tír na nóg (Oisín in the Land of Youth). This is a favorite in children's anthologies. Oisín ('Little Fawn'), son of Fionn, is enticed away to Tír na nóg by the beautiful Niamh. In this paradise no one grows old and time passes without reckoning. When Oisín insists on revisiting Ireland he is warned not to set foot on the ground but his saddle girth breaks, he falls from his horse and suddenly ages. He wanders desolate around Ireland but the Fianna are long since dead. (The phrase Oisín i ndiaidh na Féinne [Oisín after the Fianna] is used in Ireland to describe a person pining for his companions.) Eventually Oisín meets St. Patrick and in a series of dialogues known as Agallamh na Seanórach (The Colloquy of the Ancients) they debate the contrasting excellencies of the life of the Fianna and that of Christian monks.\n\n4. The Cycle of the Kings\n\nThese are accounts of the doings of mythical and semi-mythical rulers of Ireland from 300 B.C. to 700 A.D. Best known among these are Labhraidh Loingseach ('Exiled one') or Lorc ('dumb' or 'fierce'), ancestor of the Leinster people, but remembered for having horse's ears!; Conn Céadchathach, ancestor of the dominant Connachta peoples; Cormac Mac Airt, the grandson of Conn and the most honored of all the kings, whose reign was a golden age of plenty; Niall Naoighiallach, a mainly historical king of the fifth century, credited with capturing the youthful St. Patrick; Guaire, king of Connacht, 655-66, noted for his generosity.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBehan, Brendan.

Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 1998.\n\n[In the following essay, Snodgrass presents a critical history of the fable in Celtic and Irish children's literature.]\n\nCeltic lore, among the oldest body of folk stories in Europe, belongs to an elaborate structure of myth and legend that captures in the wandering harper's metrics an ancient culture, ritual, and language. Unchallenged by the Roman invasions that adulterated and weakened British lore, the Celtic strand survived entire. It speaks through a runic script that dates to the preliterate druidic schools. The cult appears in the seven-volume Commentarii de Bello Gallico [The Gallic Wars] (58–52 B.C.E.), the war correspondence of Julius Caesar after his troops encountered Continental white-robed druid priests around 55 B.C.E. After Christian scribes established monastic settle-ments and began recording Irish vernacular stories in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, they produced vellum copies of the Lebor Gabala Erenn [Book of the Taking of Ireland] (eighth century), a sanitized, Church-sanctioned version of four widely spaced cycles:\n\nthe mythological cycle of the semidivine gnomes, warlocks, magi, and fairy folk of pre-Gaelic pagan Ireland (1500 B.C.E.)\n\nthe Ulster cycle of Cuchulainn's exploits and the tales of King Conor Mac Nessa of Ulster and Maeve, Queen of Connacht, from the first century C.E.\n\nthe parallel Fenian cycle of the warrior-hunter Finn Mac Cumhaill—popularized as Finn Mac Cool—and his followers, lauded in third-century tales and ballads\n\nthe historical cycle, namely, the ninth-century stories of the kings of Tara and of Saint Patrick\n\nLess common to Celtic collections are straightforward Aesopic fables. One author of morality tales, the Welsh poet Siôn Cent, approached the classic genre in a dour reflection on morality around 1430:\n\nThree lifetimes of a valiant-footed horse\n\nFor a man, and the life is short.\n\nThree lifetimes of a man, nimble rover,\n\nFor a stag, keen leaper.\n\nThree lifetimes of a stag, long-lived, long, lean,\n\nFor the blackbird of the wood, golden, proud, pretty,\n\nThree lifetimes of the proud, pretty blackbird\n\nFor the oaktree above a fair soil.\n\nEach one of these, a wheel's band,\n\nDies without warning.\n\n(Breeze 1997, 142)\n\nObsessed with the inevitability of death, the verse departs from the heroic and magical story world for a somber reflection on evanescence, a subject that dominates the nature fables of the eighth-century Greek farmer-poet Hesiod and his successor, the late seventh-century B.C.E. soldier-poet Archilochus.\n\nA more entertaining motif of Irish folklore is the traditional fool tale, a timeless folk story in which the unwise suffer at the hands—or beaks or fangs or claws—of smarter beasts. \"The Cold May Night\" embodies nature's punishment of fools in a cumulative tale about a miserably cold spring in which a crow eats an eagle's fledgling and steals its place in the warm nest. When the eagle returns and mothers the crow in the dark nest below, she comments on the uncommon weather. He surprises her by comparing the night to one years before. The mother, disconcerted by her clever young, follows his direction and visits the blackbird at the forge, a bull in a field, and the Blind Salmon of Assaroe before finding a witness to the earlier cold night. The salmon, like a jolly peasant roisterer, chaffs the eagle for being tricked by the clever crow, which devoured her babe and stole its berth.\n\nThe eagle is also at the heart of \"The Fox and the Eagle,\" a standard revenge plot in which the eagle's snatching of two ducks during a time of famine results in a greater loss to the thief. Because the story hinges on food for the hungry rather than reward for the greedy, the turn of events serves nature's ends. At the close of the fable, the eagle carries off a third duck whose feathers conceal embers. After she inadvertently sets the nest on fire, the three ducks as well as the eagle's chicks fall to the ground, where the clever fox awaits. A similar end awaits the protagonist in \"The Fox in Inishkea,\" the tale of a wily fox who boasts of tricking local people. Overconfident in his lair, he realizes too late that stalkers have cut the briar through which he swings out of range of dogs. Like his victims, he falls to the treacherous rocks below. A parallel tale, \"The Magpie and the Fox,\" places the despoiler of nestlings in the power of the angry mother bird, who overfeeds the fox, then sics the hounds on him. Perhaps from their historic perspective as the prey of raiders and usurpers, the Irish relish revenge against the rapacious.\n\nAn Irish story that reprises the motif of the hare and the tortoise relies on less vindictive animal behaviors for its action. In \"The Cat and the Dog,\" the dog challenges the cat for its place by the fire. The two run a race that puts the dog far ahead. When a beggar strikes the dog, precipitating a squabble with the angry animal, the cat takes advantage of their tiff and makes for home. According to pourquoi logic, she sits grinning by the hearth when the dog returns and keeps her spot to this day. A tale of innate qualities fuels \"The Sow and Her Banbh,\" a brief exchange between mother and piglet, who reminds her that she will never stop thieving and risking flight from a pack of guard dogs. Wittier is \"The Old Crow Teaches the Young Crow,\" a tit-for-tat between the wise elder and wiseacre young bird, who reminds his parent that danger exists in more guises than the old crow's simple lesson suggests. Satisfied that the young crow will survive the world's evils, the old crow urges, \"Off you go…. You know more than myself!\" (O'Sullivan 1966, 15) These fables examine animals in their normal settings and enliven nature's direc-tives with anthropomorphic dialogue, the genius stroke of Aesopic fable.\n\nAs is "
