Taking Dillon’s novel, The Bitter Glass (1958) as its main focus, the author's life and work and her wider influence on 20th Century Irish writing will also be discussed. It will feature special guests each week, including Dillon’s daughter, Eiléan Ní Chuilleanáin, her son, Cormac Ó Cuilleanáin, Anne Marie Herron, Siobhán Morrissey and Maureen O'Connor."
