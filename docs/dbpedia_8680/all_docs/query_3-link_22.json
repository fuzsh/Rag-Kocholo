        "text": "Hugh Dillon portrayed Team One's Team Leader Ed Lane, promoted from Constable to Sergeant in Keep The Peace, Part II.\n\nActing Career[]\n\nHugh Dillon's acting career began in 1995, but his career was truly launched by his performance in Bruce McDonald's cult classic, Hard Core Logo in 1996 . Hugh was hand picked for the role by Bruce McDonald when he saw Hugh on stage with his band, Headstones. Cast to as lead singer 'Joe Dick' alongside Callum Keith Rennie, Hugh played a self-destructive punk-rock front man attempting to relaunch his band via a set of gigs throughout Canada.\n\nDillon has since had a long career in both movies and television, delivering authentic performances and connecting to audiences in a variety of roles.\n\nImmediately prior to Flashpoint, Hugh starred in the Canadian series Durham County, which produced three seasons of dark drama in which he played Detective Mike Sweeney.\n\nSince the conclusion of Flashpoint, Dillon has brought his acting talents a number of movies and TV series'. Teaming up with friend Taylor Sheridan, he was cast in the feature film Wind River across from Jeremy Renner while in the same year earned a role in the award winning crime drama Dark Harvest.\n\nSoon, Dillon teamed again with Sheridan as Sheriff Donnie Haskell in Sheridan's streaming series Yellowstone. The two continue to work together in the Paramount series, Mayor of Kingstown, which Hugh co-created with Sheridan. The first season of the series filmed many scenes in Kingston, Ontario, Dillon's home town and impetus for the story. Hugh also stars in the series as Ian Ferguson, working with Mike McLusky, played by Jeremy Renner. Season Two is currently in production in Pittsburgh.\n\nMusic Career[]\n\nDillon grew up in Canadian musical hotbed, Kingston, Ontario. The town of 130,000 has sprouted some of the most iconic Canadian bands and musicians, including Bryan Adams, The Tragically Hip, Bedouin Soundclash, The Glorious Sons and Dillon's band, Headstones. He is approximately the same age as the members of 'The Tragically Hip', growing up as friends with guitarist Paul Langolis,\n\nAfter a short stint with a band called Sean Penitentiary, Headstones were formed in 1987. The band made their name on the punk-rock scene as hard-driving with Dillon as their frontman. Originally consisting of Mark Gibson on drums, Tim White on bass, guitarist Trent Carr and Hugh fronting the band and playing harmonica, their live shows grew a reputation of being edgy and Dillon being unrelenting in his audience interaction. The band addressed a number of sensitive topics with a brash forwardness and Hugh kept audience members on their toes as a cigarette-flipping, spitting stage presence. The band took pride in thumbing their collective noses at Toronto bands' civility with their crowd-surfing, hard rock style.\n\nAfter building a following due to their live shows, the group signed with MCA Records in 1992. In June 1993 they released Picture of Health, which was certified platinum in Canada, selling over 100,000 copies.\n\nAfter the tour was completed for their first album, drummer Mark Gibson opted to leave the band, being replaced by Dale Harrison for the recording of their second album, Teeth and Tissue in 1995. The band hit the road to support this album doing a two month, 44 city tour. Tissue would eventually become certified Gold in Canada selling over 50,000 copies. This led to the band receiving two Juno Award nominations in 1996, one for Best Group and one for Best Rock Album.\n\nIn 1997 the ensemble released their third studio album, Smile and Wave which was also certified Gold in Canada. The group continued to play live shows and record new material which led to 2000's Nickels for Your Nightmares, and 2001's compilation Greatest Fits.\n\nIn 2002, the group released Oracle of Hi-Fi with Maple Music. Soon after, in September 2003, the band announced via their website that they were no longer making music together. By this time, Dillon needed to make a change in his life to tackle his drug addiction.\n\nFor Hugh, however, his time away from music did not last too long. He had relocated to become a lumberjack in Northern Ontario, but he did release an album of a very different tone than Headstones albums in June 2005. He recorded The High Co$t of Low Living under the name 'Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir'. The album was produced by The Tragically Hip's Paul Langlois after he happened to be present during one of the recording sessions and offered to work on the project. The album was well received by Headstones fans, but featured a different line up of musicians with J.P. Polsoni on guitar, Chris Osti on bass, Ben Koayashi on Keyboards and Derek Downham Percussion. It was released on Paul Langlois' label, Ching Music and played a few shows, including at a massive fundraiser in Kingston, Ontario.\n\nFrom this album, the track 'Come On' was used as the theme for the Canadian version of the show Comedy, Inc and also featured in the video game 'EA Sports Triple Play' in 2002. Two tracks also appeared on the Season 1 DVD extras of Dillon's dark police drama, Durham County.\n\nBalancing a growing acting career and a music career, Dillon released another solo album in 2009 with Langlois' label, this time under his own name, but with the same members as Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir. The album, titled Works Well With Others, re-recorded tracks from High Co$t of Low Living and added 6 new songs. Two tracks from Hugh's solo album were featured in Flashpoint, including Lost at Sea (Attention Shoppers) and Don't Be Fooled (Just a Man).\n\nIn February 2011, Headstones reunited for a friend, Randy Kwan. Kwan had co-written songs for their first album and encouraged them to back get together. The group performed 4 shows in February and then 8 more in December, from Vancouver to Niagra Falls. This spurred the band to write again and soon started one of the most successful fundraisers PledgeMusic has ever seen, financing their reunion album, Love + Fury in just 24 hours. The single, LongWayToNeverland became a #1 hit in Canada and Love+Fury made into the Top 10. The album was released in 2013 and its entirety is dedicated to the memory of Kwan, who died of cancer, and proceeds from the first four shows were donated to his family. Chris Osti, from Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir, co-wrote two songs on the album and co-produced the album with Dillon. The liner notes of Love+Fury thank Sergio DiZio first, and Rico Colantoni last. Eventually, the album was distributed by Universal Music.\n\nFinding joy in making music together again, Dillon, Carr, White and Harrison quickly set up another crowd-sourced album, an acoustic revisitation of previous Headstones songs titled One In The Chamber Music. This unusual sound for the band found a different energy but excited fans nonetheless. It showed off different sounds among the ensemble including prominent upright bass, mandolin and acoustic guitars. These stripped-down versions also allowed Dillon to share his vocal prowess in the setting of the Headstones. The album was released in 2014 and was also produced by Dillon and Osti. Again, Flashpoint alumni, Sergio DiZio is thanked in the liner notes. Finding time to tour as well as fulfill his acting obligations, Dillon returned to the road with the band. This tour packed all the energy of the original Headstones tours but with slightly less spitting and smoking on stage. Instead, Dillon tends to interact with the audience up close and personal and occasionally will take items such as cameras from audience members and even photographers stationed in front of the stage.\n\n2015 saw the groups first vinyl release in a single titled 'Fuck It'. With two songs, the title track and a B side of 'One By One' and was released exclusively on 12\" vinyl.\n\nNext for the band came Little Army, released June 2, 2017 by Maple Music. Again produced by Dillon and Osti, the album also added Steve Carr on Keyboards, Rickferd Van Dyk on Guitar and Lyle Molzan on drums, replacing Harrison for the recording. Again, the band toured extensively around this album. Devil's On Fire reached #6 on the Canadian singles chart from this album.\n\nIn October 2018, the 25 year anniversary of Picture of Health saw a remastered re-release of the album. March 15, 2019 the group released a single, a cover of Gordon Lightfoot's Canadian classic, The Wreck of the Edmond Fitzgerald, which was praised by Lightfoot himself as \"an outstanding version\" of the song. The choice to record it came from the fans' response to it at their VIP sound checks.\n\nHeadstones released their second vinyl offering, Peopleskills on October 25, 2019. This album spawned 'Leave It All Behind' which reached #8 on Canadian Billboard Rock Charts. 'Leave It All Behind' and 'Horses' both reached Number 3 on the US Billboard Charts.\n\nThe band was set to embark on a Canadian tour in 2020 with three other Canadian 90's rock groups, Moist, The Tea Party and Big Wreck, until the COVID-19 pandemic shut down concert venues. After an attempt to reschedule, the entire tour was canceled in 2021.\n\nHeadstones are currently recording their newest studio album, expected to be released in 2022.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nHugh Dillon grew up in Kingston, Ontario, in a time period that produced many iconic Canadians. Crossing paths with names such as Paul Langois and Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip, David Usher and even hockey legend Doug Gilmour, Dillon moved to London, England when he was 20 in order to escape the trouble he had found growing up. He promised his parents he would stay away from his hometown for 5 years, and returned to Toronto before he was 22 to \"play rock and roll\". He became the lead singer and frontman of the Canadian punk-rock band, Headstones, which formed in 1987 in Kingston. Headstones, with Hugh's tough exterior and boorish attitude, became known known for their high energy shows and apparent flippant attitude.\n\nAfter the 2002 release of their fifth album, Oracle of Hi-Fi, Dillon left the band to deal with his heroin addiction, which had returned after he had kicked the habit in 2000 the first time. He moved to northern Ontario and worked as a lumberjack, focusing on rebuilding his life. In the following years, he would release two albums of a different style, fronting a group called The Hugh Dillon Redemption Choir as well as a solo album, Works Well With Others.\n\nWhile away from Headstones, Dillon focused primarily on his acting career, gaining notoriety in the series Durham County. When the band reunited, Dillon managed to successfully juggle his music and acting careers, touring with Headstones and performing in movies and TV shows.\n\nHugh Dillon is married to his wife, Midori Fujiwara and has homes in both Toronto and Los Angeles. He credits his wife and his manager with saving his life and supporting him through his addiction.\n\nTV Filmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Episode Count 2021-2023 Mayor of Kingstown Ian Ferguson 20 2018-2021 Yellowstone Sheriff Donnie Haskell 13 2018 The Detectives Detective Rod Piukkala 1 2017 Twin Peaks Tom Paige 1 2015-2017 X Company Duncan Sinclair 25 2017 The Expanse Lieutenant Sutton 3 2014 Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight Clean Gene 8 2013-2014 Continuum Stan Escher 7 2013 The Killing Francis Becker 12 2008-2012 Flashpoint Ed Lane 75 2007-2010 Durham County Mike Sweeney 18 2007 The Gathering Detective Gamble 1 2004-2005 ReGenesis Danny Dexter/Dextor 3 2004 Bury the Lead Eddie 1 2003 Starhunter Gus 1 2003 Blue Murder Kevin Marshall 1 2002-2003 Degrassi: The Next Generation Albert Manning 3 1998-2000 Twitch City Howard The Cannibal/Guy in the Convenience Store 2\n\nFilms[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2018 I Still See You Mathison 2017 Cosmology Short 2017 The Humanity Bureau Adam Westinghouse 2017 Wind River Curtis 2016 Dark Harvest Vincent 2015 The Offer Richard Short 2011 Issues Bobby Short 2008 Of Murder and Memory Vincent Nichol TV Movie 2008 Down to the Dirt Renny 2008 The Quality of Life Jean Tellier TV Movie 2008 About Face The Agent 2008 Surveillance Steven 2006 Trailer Park Boys: The Movie Sonny 2006 Hope and a Little Sugar Bar Construction Worker 2005 Our Fathers Johnny DeFranco TV Movie 2005 Assault on Precinct 13 Tony 2004 The Wool Cap Leather Jacket TV Movie 2004 The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess Bobby Tomahawk TV Movie 2004 Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning Reverend Gilbert 2004 Down to the Bone Bob 2002 Lone Hero King As Hugh R.
