The themes of her writing include island life on the Atlantic coast to her knowledge and love of language and folk tradition.\n\n.\n\nPictured at Ceiliúradh Eilís Dillon at the Town Hall Theatre were musicians Roisín Mannion, Tomás Mannion, and Emily Greaney. Photo:- Aengus McMahon\n\nCeiliúradh Eilís Dillon will be a virtual programme to ensure compliance with Covid-19 guidelines. The programme will include an online book club examining Dillon’s work; seminars exploring her Galway roots and place in Irish history; two new commissions which highlight her love of art and music - a visual art piece to celebrate her life and work and a music composition in response to one of her best known and highly regarded translated works, Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire; and a children's tour, One Author, 5 Islands’, along the wild Atlantic way."
