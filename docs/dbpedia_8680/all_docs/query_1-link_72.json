        "text": "An elderly man retires to an island in the Atlantic. Two boys from the community discover he has plans to make his home on an uninhabited island and help him to move his belongings in a boat, only to find themselves kidnapped with little hope of rescue. The author has also written \"The Sea Wall\".\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nEilis Dillon was born in Galway in 1920. Abandoning a career as a professional cellist, she turned to writing for adults and children, quickly earning an international reputation for both. Eilis lived in Italy for six years in the 1960s, then divided her time between Ireland and California, until her final years which were spent in Ireland. She died in Dublin in 1994.\n\nFrom School Library Journal:\n\nGrade 5-8-- After helping their tutor move to the deserted Island of Ghosts, Brendan and Dara discover that the man intends to keep them captive on the island to help him create the legendary paradise Hy-Brasil. The move was done in secret, for the people of Inishglass speak only of the haunted island in hushed voices, and all avoid going there. When an escape attempt only worsens their situation, the boys become resigned to their fate. Meanwhile, everyone back home is in mourning, assuming the boys have drowned at sea. Only their sisters deduce the truth and enlist the aid of a school teacher to teach them to sail so that they can rescue the boys. When the girls do not return, the teacher finally enlists the men of Inishglass to rescue the youths. They also find the remains of the ghosts that haunt the island and give them a proper burial. Although the ghost stories about the island have a great impact on the plot, the actual appearances of the ghosts and their significance to the story are not fully explored. Dillon's writing has a soothing quality that conveys a strong sense of place along with the love and respect the boys have for their families and homeland. While this strength will carry readers through some plot manipulations that may not ring true, some may feel that the gentle tone of the story and the quickness of Dara to forgive his captor softens the horror of the situation too much. --Susan Schuller, Milwaukee Pub .
