        "text": "About the author\n\nEilís Dillon (1920-94) was born in Galway, Ireland. She travelled widely in America, and lectured on Irish literature and poetry. She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, and wrote many books for children. There are over 30 books to her name: the three books which feature horses are aimed at differing ages, with the best known, The Island of Horses, aimed at teenagers. This book was selected by The Sunday Times as one of its “99 Best Books for Children.” It is an excellent read: a vivid picture of a small and close community combined with realistic and tense adventure.\n\nFinding the books\n\nThe Horse Fancier can be difficult to find (watch out for mad prices on Amazon) but it does turn up cheaply. The other two titles are easy to find."
