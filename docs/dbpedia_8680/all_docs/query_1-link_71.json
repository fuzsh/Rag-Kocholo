        "text": "Micahel Dillon was born in Dublin in 1922. His father Thomas was a Professor of Chemistry at University College Galway and his mother was Geraldine Plunkett, sister of the Easter Rising's Joseph Plunkett who as Director of Communications in 1916 was instrumental in putting the rebels own radio station on the air. Michael was a fountain of knowledge about farming and began writing about it in newspapers and trade magazines. In 1948 he joined Radio Eireann providing educational talks for a nation dominated by agriculture. Michael became a major force in the Irish Farmers Association. He presented 'Farmers Forum' on Radio Eireann for many years but at time not everyone was happy with the broadcasts."
