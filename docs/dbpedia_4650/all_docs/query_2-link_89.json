        "text": "This article was last updated in OCTOBER 2023\n\nWe’ve not got long to wait for the highly anticipated new Doctor Who episodes, with the three 60th anniversary specials (starring David Tennant, Catherine Tate and Neil Patrick Harris) due to air on the BBC in November 2023, and series 14 starting with a festive special. In the meantime, we’re certainly not short of a few series to revisit.\n\nWhether you’re a fan of the modern era of the show or want to find out where to watch classic Doctor Who from the sixties and beyond, there’s plenty of places to stream or buy old Doctor Who series both in the UK and the USA.\n\nWhere to Watch Classic Doctor Who\n\nIn The UK Only: BBC iPlayer\n\nFrom 1st November 2023, BBC iPlayer will host all 800+ episodes of Doctor Who, from classic Who right the way through to the modern era, plus the spin-offs, including Torchwood, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Doctor Who Confidential and Class.\n\nThis is part of the 60th anniversary celebrations, so it’s unclear just how long all of these episodes will be available on iPlayer, but we’ll certainly be enjoying it while it lasts.\n\nIn The UK, USA and Canada: BritBox\n\nThere’s a whopping 272 hours worth of classic Doctor Who available to stream on BritBox, with 558 episodes spanning the first eight Doctors, from William Hartnell to Paul McGann. You can also watch spin-off series K-9 and Company, documentaries including More Than 30 Years in the TARDIS and Doctor Who: Doctors Revisited, and rare gems such as the unbroadcast story, ‘Shada’.\n\nClassic Doctor Who is available on BritBox for both UK and US subscribers, and is streamable wherever you use your BritBox subscription: direct, on Apple TV, Prime Video or ITV Hub.\n\nIf you’re new to classic Doctor Who and wondering where to start with such a vast number of episodes, take a look at our pick of the best episodes from the 1960s era.\n\nIn The Rest of the World\n\nSadly, outside of the UK, US and Canada, classic Doctor Who isn’t widely available to stream anywhere.\n\nWhere to watch up to series 13 of modern Doctor Who\n\nIn The UK: BBC iPlayer\n\nBBC iPlayer is still the home of all modern Doctor Who, starting with Christopher Eccleston in Series 1 and going right the way through to Jodie Whittaker’s farewell in ‘The Power of the Doctor’ – and this will be the case for all new Doctor Who episodes too.\n\nIn The USA: HBO Max\n\nAll modern Doctor Who series are currently available on the HBO Max streaming service, from series 1 with the Christopher Eccleston era right to the most recent episode, ‘The Power of the Doctor’.\n\nRest of the World\n\nIn Australia, all thirteen modern series are on Foxtel. Some European countries like France, Italy and Spain also have varying number of series of modern Doctor Who via Pluto TV.\n\nSadly, most other countries don’t have access to modern Doctor Who, including Ireland.\n\nWhere to watch new episodes of modern Doctor Who\n\nIn The UK: BBC iPlayer\n\nAs above, the BBC remains the home of modern Doctor Who, and the 60th anniversary specials and beyond will be available on BBC iPlayer.\n\nIn The USA (and pretty much everywhere except Ireland)\n\nAll new episodes of Doctor Who will be available on Disney+ in every country where this streaming service is available – except the UK and Ireland. Disney+ is the new home of modern Who from the anniversary specials onwards.\n\nIn Ireland\n\nWhile there remains no streaming service available to watch Doctor Who in Ireland, most viewers can still access the BBC via satellite or cable TV, so you should be able to watch the new episodes live as they air."
