        "text": "It's not surprising that quality BBC iPlayer VPNs are in such high demand. The U.K.'s public broadcaster continues to offer a dizzying array of exclusive TV shows, classic films, and live events that are all absolutely free to watch at the point of access. From \"A Good Girl's Guide to Murder\", \"Call the Midwife\" and \"The Apprentice\", to national institutions like Wimbledon tennis and catching up on watching Glastonbury Festival, there's something for everyone on the Beeb.\n\nThe BBC iPlayer streaming service brings all of that on-demand and live content to laptops, smartphones, tablets, Smart TVs, and a wide variety of streaming devices. However, try and check it out from beyond the U.K. and you'll have no luck. It's all thanks to licensing issues that restrict certain shows and movies to certain countries. Annoying? Big time. Luckily, a VPN is all you need to turn the tide.\n\nI've tested the biggest VPNs around to discover which ones are able to access all the content you're used to back at home when you're abroad. Only the best VPNs also offer speedy connections, watertight security and a faff-free user experience.\n\nThe best BBC iPlayer VPNs at a glance:\n\nThe best BBC iPlayer VPNs in 2024\n\nThe best VPN overall\n\nNordVPN is my #1 pick because, quite frankly, it's the total package – and one that won't cost you a fortune. The VPN has more than 440 servers in the UK that are ideal for accessing BBC iPlayer (even if you're on the other side of the world). If you fancy checking out content from elsewhere, or picking a server nearer to your actual location, you can take your pick of servers in 61 countries.\n\nWhile connected to the web via Nord, you’ll be protected from malware and phishing ads through NordVPN’s Threat Protection tech – learn more in my NordVPN review.\n\nWith peak speeds of over 950 Mbps when connected to its proprietary NordLynx protocol, NordVPN is a streaming beast. It’s my top-rated Netflix VPN, unblocking hard-to-crack Netflix libraries and other streaming platforms at will – including, of course, BBC iPlayer.\n\nThere's also an excellent SmartPlay feature that combines Nord’s basic VPN protection and smart DNS technology to churn out better security and speed while you stream your favorite content on your phone, laptop, tablet, or even devices such as Smart TV that don't natively support a VPN.\n\nWhat's more, SmartPlay is automatically switched on the moment you connect to NordVPN – no manual intervention needed. However, be aware that if you're using Nord as a Smart TV VPN and only using SmartPlay, you won't have any added privacy – only the full VPN can do that.\n\nYou get two implementations of the kill switch, an audited no-logs policy, and nifty add-ons such as Double VPN and Onion Over VPN. Double VPN routes your internet traffic through two VPN servers instead of one, thus encrypting your data twice. While Onion Over sends everything through the super safe Tor network. Both are great for extra safekeeping.\n\nNordVPN also comes with a built-in antivirus and password manager, establishing the service as more than just a VPN – it’s a full-fledged security tool you can bank on to protect you from just about anything. And you can rest assured that your information will stay private because NordVPN employs powerful encryption and DNS leak protection.\n\nNordVPN knocks it out of the park as far as ease of use is concerned, and although its map-style interface isn't perfect in the mobile VPN apps, on larger screens it's a joy to use.\n\nHowever, it's a little disappointing that NordVPN allows you to login into only 6 devices at a time, especially when providers such as ExpressVPN have added room for more users in their recent updates. If you think the limited simultaneous connections will be an issue, consider Surfshark or PIA, both of which have no restrictions on how many devices you can use at once.\n\nThe bottom line remains that NordVPN offers one of the most, if not the most, complete security packages in the industry and its unblocking capabilities are second to none. If you’re still not convinced, thanks to a 30-day money-back guarantee, you’ll have the freedom to figure out whether the NordVPN package is right for you.\n\nOur NordVPN promo codes can help you save on top-notch security products. Use our codes to get discounts on NordVPN antivirus, VPN, and other protection tools.\n\nThe best VPN for beginners\n\nIf you're after a beginner-friendly provider, I'd have to recommend ExpressVPN. I've always found it to be perfect for streaming iPlayer thanks to its wide range of British servers, good speeds, and, of course, the fact it can get you access in the first place.\n\nOutside of iPlayer, ExpressVPN performed a clean sweep of streaming platforms in my latest round of testing. It'll get you access to a variety of global Netflix libraries, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube, ITVX, Channel 4 and pretty much everything else.\n\nAlthough ExpressVPN isn't the very fastest around, speeds of up to 750 Mbps in my testing are far faster than the vast majority of domestic connections. What's more, with servers in 105 countries, you'll be able to explore a huge amount of content outside of iPlayer.\n\nAnother ExpressVPN bonus is a diverse set of apps for devices such as the Fire TV Stick and game consoles. With other VPNs, you could end up spending hours fiddling with your Wi-Fi router to connect these devices – not so here, as you’ll have a dedicated app right in the store, ready to download.\n\nSome of these devices rely on Express’s MediaStreamer tech, which allows you to access blocked content through the use of Smart DNS rather than using VPN servers. This means that you can use ExpressVPN to unblock content on tons of devices like Samsung Tizen TVs that don't support true VPN connections. Be aware, though, that it doesn't provide the security benefits of a real VPN on these devices.\n\nOn that note, there's not a service that can beat the reliability ExpressVPN offers.\n\nWith an independently audited no-logs policy, industry-standard AES-256 encryption, and RAM-only servers, ExpressVPN leads the pack when it comes to maintaining the privacy of user data and keeping it away from the reach of authorities and malicious entities. Plus, superb security add-ons such as the Threat Manager and a built-in password manager make it all the more better.\n\nExpressVPN is also renowned for its excellent customer service. If something goes wrong while you’re watching iPlayer, you’ll be able to launch a live support chat immediately, as agents are available 24/7.\n\nOverall, ExpressVPN is solid on all counts, and with easy-to-use apps (that are ideal for newbies still learning how to use a VPN), nifty security features, and wide coverage, it's the perfect BBC iPlayer VPN that'll also keep you protected online, no matter what you're doing.\n\nThe best cheap VPN service\n\nMy Surfshark review demonstrates that there’s no need to break the bank in order to access a top-quality iPlayer VPN. As long as you’re willing to sign up for two years, Surfshark is easily the best cheap VPN on the market today.\n\nIn my most recent testing, Surfshark also delivered a clean sweep of streaming unblocking, accessing not only iPlayer but Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+. I tested it with other streaming services, including Channel 4 and ITVX in the U.K. and the Aussie 9Now and 10Play, and it was just as effective with them too.\n\nOne of Surfshark’s party pieces is its unlimited connections policy – this is quite rare in the industry, and having it combined with such a bargain price offers excellent value. With just one subscription, you, your family, and your friends can all stream iPlayer at the same time without worrying about anyone getting logged out.\n\nThankfully, even though it’s affordable, Surfshark doesn't lack any essential features. Your browsing data will be secure thanks to 256-bit AES encryption and protocols like IKEv2, OpenVPN, and WireGuard – plus the apps are incredibly easy to use no matter what platform you’re on, making iPlayer access super simple.\n\nIf you're mobile-first, Surfshark's Android VPN and iPhone VPN apps are really smooth to use. They feel modern, they're simple to navigate, and make staying protected and unblocking content a pleasant experience.\n\nIn my last round of testing, Surfshark proved to be one of the fastest VPN services. My speed testing is undertaken on a 1 Gbps connection, and the very fastest providers (including Surfshark, NordVPN, and Windscribe) all maxed out at 950 Mbps. On an even faster line, I have no doubt these providers would ramp up the speeds even more.\n\nCoupled with its great speeds, you'll also get cookie, pop-up, ad, and malware blockers, so no need to worry about being tracked my marketing agencies or falling foul of dodgy downloads.\n\nIf you're thinking of browsing further afield, Surfshark offers servers in 100 countries – more than NordVPN and just a few shy of ExpressVPN – meaning that no matter where you are or what you're looking for, you'll stay anonymous and have speedy, reliable access.\n\nOne negative from my testing is that when I put the kill switch under great pressure – closing low-level processes etc. – it did fail. However, this is very unlikely to happen in real life.\n\nOverall, Surfshark is very easy to use with navigable interfaces no matter the device you're using. Should you run into any trouble, 24/7 customer support will get you up and running again in no time at all – plus you’ll also have 30 days to claim your money back if you don’t love the service.\n\nOther quality BBC iPlayer VPNs that I've tested\n\nProton VPN is well-known as a secure, private VPN service, but in the last couple of years, it has also proved itself as a seriously capable VPN for unblocking an array of streaming platforms – BBC iPlayer included.\n\nIn my testing, it had no problem working as an iPlayer VPN, and each time I tried, I was able to watch whatever I wanted on iPlayer when connected to a U.K. server. Plus, if you subscribe to Netflix or just about any other streaming service, you'll be able to use Proton VPN with them, too.\n\nWhile peak speeds of around 460 Mbps isn't something to marvel at, it's respectable and gets the job done.\n\nPlus, with a proprietary VPN Accelerator technology, Proton VPN claims that your server speeds can be cranked up by 400%. That said, in my own testing, I found the VPN Accelerator didn't make much of a difference. Nevertheless, it's a nifty tool to have.\n\nAn always-on VPN feature ensures that you're never on the internet without a secure VPN server masking your IP address and protecting your privacy.\n\nIt works almost exactly like ExpressVPN's auto-connect feature in that it re-establishes connection with a VPN server in the unlikely scenario of your VPN connection dropping.\n\nOne downside to Proton VPN is the fact that it doesn't support quite as many devices as other providers.\n\nIf you only stream on your phone or laptop, that won't be an issue, but if you're using a smart TV or another device that doesn't support VPNs, Proton's lack of Smart DNS service lets it down slightly.\n\nHowever, its recently introduced Fire Stick VPN app shows that the provider is committed to upgrading its service regularly.\n\nAlso, Proton VPN offers 10 simultaneous connections, which although not the best that I've seen, is certainly more than heavyweights ExpressVPN and NordVPN.\n\nIn my testing, I was very impressed by Proton VPN's security. It's based out of Switzerland, a country outside EU and US jurisdictions and one that's not a part of the '14 Eyes' surveillance network.\n\nWith strong privacy laws as its bottom line, Proton VPN is as rock-solid as they come. Thanks to a free plan and a 30-day money-back guarantee on premium plans, you'll have ample time to test the service before committing.\n\nIn my most recent Private Internet Access review, it performed better than ever, and it's especially good as a BBC iPlayer VPN. It successfully accessed iPlayer in my testing and, what's more, it's great for Netflix, unblocking a number of regional libraries as well as Disney+, Hulu, and more.\n\nThe only site it couldn't get past was 10Play, the Aussie streaming platform, but other than that, it’s smooth sailing.\n\nThe biggest talking point has to be PIA's jump in 2023 to unlimited simultaneous connections – previously, it offered just 10 but it's now right beside Surfshark as a perfect choice for those looking to cover a lot of devices with a single VPN plan.\n\nPIA is an absolute bargain, and as the cheapest provider on the list, I'd recommend it for anyone pinching for pennies. To give you an idea, its longer term plans are priced at just a little over $2 a month – an absolute steal, considering the quality of service.\n\nPIA doesn't short-change you and provides impeccable security. It's the only VPN on the market to have proven its no-logs policy in court twice.\n\nAdd to that a MACE feature that keeps malware and ads at bay and a powerful kill switch, and PIA's security showing is right up there with the best. It's also 100% open-source, just like Proton VPN, meaning you're free to inspect its code any time you want.\n\nFor those that know how to use them, PIA's extra features like Port Forwarding will be very useful, especially if you're planning on using it as a torrenting VPN, but new users and those who want a simpler interface may find that they get in the way of a seamless experience.\n\nHowever, I definitely wouldn't consider this a deal-breaker for anyone except the most tech-unsavvy individuals. It's very easy to simply open up the app – on whatever device you're using – and connect to your chosen server.\n\nPIA, quite impressively, has the most VPN servers of any VPN on the market, topping out at a claimed 60,000+ worldwide. An illustrious location list with every server's latency mentioned alongside it makes PIA a delight to use and there will always be a fast and load-free server for you to connect to, no matter where you are.\n\nHow to choose an iPlayer VPN\n\nIf you're wondering how to watch BBC iPlayer, picking the right iPlayer VPN is essential. Your first check should be that your chosen provider can unblock the British TV streaming site at all. Thankfully, all the VPNs on this page work reliably in this respect, so you can make your decision based on other factors.\n\nPlenty of servers dotted around the world will be a bonus, especially for anyone who does a lot of traveling. Bear in mind VPNs are useful for tons of other things besides streaming.\n\nTop-quality privacy is also a must. Staying protected online is more and more difficult, so robust encryption, verified no-logs policies and any addition features like built-in antivirus should be green flags.\n\nA good support team, ideally with 24/7 live chat will also be very useful – should you discover your iPlayer VPN suddenly can't unblock the site, a quick message may get you back up and running in a matter of moments. It's also worth going for a service that's simple and easy to use, alongside delivering great privacy.\n\nNew to BBC iPlayer\n\nIf you're looking for something new to watch on the BBC iPlayer, here are some suggestions of content that has recently hit the service:\n\nUEFA Men's Euro 2024: BBC iPlayer has launched an entire Euros channel for this year's champisonship, will special features and matches from the Euros archive. Watch not only the matches, but highlights, home nations camp reports, analysis and the new Euro highlights programme, Euros Breakdown.\n\n\"A Good Girl's Guide To Murder\": This thrilling new series sees Emma Myers (\"Wednesday\") portray Pip Fitz-Amobi, a girl determined to unmask the real culprit behind an apparently solved murder case. How far will the real killer go to keep her from the truth?\n\nEastbourne Tennis 2024: Get yourself warmed up for Wimbledon by watching some of the biggest starts in women's tennis battle it out on court.\n\n\"The Traitors US\" season 2: Alan Cumming hosts the US version of the viral reality TV show which sees ordinary people play a faux-deadly game of subterfuge.\n\nTennis: Queen's: This pre-Wimbledon tennis tournament sees some of the biggest names in men's tennis take to the grass court.\n\nFAQ\n\nWhat is the best BBC iPlayer VPN?\n\nFrom the results of our in-depth testing, we consider NordVPN to be the best iPlayer VPN. It's fast, reliable, easy to use, and offers excellent privacy features. Plus, it comes at a budget-friendly price.\n\nHow do we test iPlayer VPNs?\n\nTo ensure we're giving you up-to-date information on these iPlayer VPN providers, we regularly test them to make sure they're keeping up with the competition. This is our process:\n\nFirst, we fire up the VPN to be tested, and connect to the automatically selected server in the U.K. – this best reflects what the majority of users will be doing.\n\nWe then head over to iPlayer and attempt to watch its exclusive content. We do this both in private browsing/Incognito mode and on a regular browser, note any differences, and repeat a number of times to check for any discrepancies.\n\nWe then note down the results, and update any relevant guides and articles if necessary.\n\nWhat can I watch with a BBC iPlayer VPN?\n\nOnce you've downloaded a working BBC iPlayer VPN, all of the channel's content will be available to watch. So that means all of the dramas, comedies, documentaries and films it has in its library to watch on demand, as well as all of its live channels.\n\nWe're not going to list here everything you can watch... this page would go on and on and on! But we're talking about the vast majority of the \"Doctor Who\" catalog, those brilliant David Attenborough documentaries like \"Planet Earth III\", hit shows such as \"The Tourist\" and \"Vigil\", and your daily dose of the goings on in Albert Square in \"Eastenders\".\n\nThen there's the all the live coverage it shows of Glastonbury festival, Wimbledon, the FA Cup and the Olympic Games, too.\n\nWhy doesn't every service work as an iPlayer VPN?\n\nWhile almost every VPN has the power to relocate you by routing your connection through a server in a different country, relatively few have the power to unblock streaming services.\n\nMost can act as a YouTube VPN, unblocking region-restricted content, thanks to the fact that YouTube has relatively lax VPN usage rules. Essentially, it's pretty easy to get around it.\n\nOther services like Netflix and Amazon Prime are trickier, though. To access Netflix a VPN has to put work into avoiding the blocks and check in place, and Amazon also take into account where your subscription is based/being paid from.\n\nHowever, in terms of VPN blocking, iPlayer is usually the most difficult to unblock. That's probably because there are no ads and it's free to use in the U.K. – so there's a lot of reasons why people overseas would want to get access. Thus, only the very best services can get you watching."
