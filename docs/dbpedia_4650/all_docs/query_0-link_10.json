The series invite research done in both humanities and social sciences and invite scholars working with the role of film and other media in relation to the development of a European society, culture and identity. Books in the series can deal with both media content and media genres, with national and transnational aspects of film and media policy, with the sociology of media as institutions and with audiences and reception, and the impact of film and media on everyday life, culture and society. The series encourage books working with European integration or themes cutting across nation states in Europe and books working with Europe in a more global perspective. The series especially invite publications with a comparative, European perspective based on research outside a traditional nation state perspective. In an era of increased European integration and globalization there is a need to move away from the single nation study focus and the single discipline study of Europe.

The question has also been the title of a research project funded by Independent Research Fund Denmark (2014–2019) and supported by Aarhus University Research Foundation (2014–2015) and Carlsberg Foundation (2016). In a Danish context, the project has been the first major investigation of the different cultural, institutional, economic, industry and policy aspects of the way Danish TV drama travels and how national series were suddenly viewed and praised outside the culture of their origin. This project would never have been possible without a number of crucial collaborations. In England we worked with Roehampton University/Professor Andrea Esser, King’s College/Professor Jeanette Steemers, and the Birkbeck University of London/Dr. Janet McCabe. In Germany our partner was the Film University Berlin/Professor Lothar Mikos, and in Wales we worked with the University of South Wales/ Professor Ruth McElroy and Cardiff University/Dr. Caitriona Noonan. Our partner in Australia was the University of Wollongong/Professor Sue Turnbull and Dr Marion McCutcheon, in Turkey it was Izmir University/ Dr. Yesim Kaptan, and in Brazil we worked with Universidade Federal de São Carlos/Dr. Alessandra Meleiro. Furthermore, we have worked with Dr. Tim Raats at Vrije Universiteit, Dr. Elke Weissmann at Edge Hill University, Professor Matt Hills at Huddersfield University, Dr. Vilde Schanke Sundet at the Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, v\n\nvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nProfessor Robert Saunders at SUNY Farmingdale State College, Professor Annette Hill at Lund University, Dr. Iris Rittenhofer at Aarhus University, Dr. Yamila Heram at the University of Buenos Aires, Professor Trine Syvertsen at the University of Oslo, Professor Hanne Bruun at Aarhus University, and PhD fellow Cathrin Bengesser at the Birkbeck University of London. Our international partners and colleagues have helped us to organise the fieldwork, recruit viewers and industry partners, conduct interviews, and translate and transcribe manuscripts. They have also taken part in the project’s visiting professor programme, co-authored and contributed in other ways to our publications, and given talks at workshops and conferences hosted by the project. As such, the study of transnational Danish television drama series became a transnational research project in itself. The project has benefited hugely from this collaboration across national, cultural and disciplinary borders, paving the way for future research initiatives and academic partnerships. There have been other related large-scale projects within the field, all of them only partly focusing on Danish television drama series, for example, Television from Small Nations (AHRC, University of South Wales, 2016–2017); Mediating Cultural Encounters Through European Screens (MeCETES, HERA, University of York, 2013–2015); Media Experiences (Wallenberg’s Foundation, Lund University, 2013–2016); Success in the Film and Television Industries (SIFTI, Lillehammer University College, Norwegian Research Council, YEARS); and Crime Fiction and Crime Journalism in Scandinavia (Danish Research Council, Aalborg University, 2007–2010). The transnational Danish drama series project has included researchers from these other projects and worked closely with them by exchanging ideas and co-authoring publications, thereby creating fruitful synergies and exchanging knowledge across the different research projects. It has been a pleasure to work with all our academic partners and colleagues both in Denmark and abroad. It has been an amazing journey, and we are grateful for all the help and support that you have given us. Besides the academic partners, we have worked closely with our industry partners both in Denmark and abroad, and we want to thank you all for your support and your time. We have conducted approximately 100 interviews with industry partners, including screenwriters, producers, distributors and buyers. And finally, we have talked to hundreds of viewers across the different countries and continents. We are thankful for your help and the fact that you have shared your experiences and insights with us.\n\nPREFACE\n\nvii\n\nThe team of researchers have published extensively, including books, edited volumes and articles, and as the editors of special issues about Danish television drama series or topics related to the study, both in English and in Danish. For a complete list of publications, please visit our project website ‘What makes Danish television drama series travel?’ at Aarhus University (http://danishtvdrama.au.dk). In addition to this volume about the general perspectives and findings, the group of researchers within the project have written the following books: 1864: Tv-serien og historien (2015, ed. Kim Toft Hansen); Locating Nordic Noir (2017, Kim Toft Hansen and Anne Marit Waade); European Television Crime Drama and Beyond (2018, eds. Kim Toft Hansen, Steven Peacock and Sue Turnbull); Reconsidering Audience Proximities: The Global Travel of Danish Television Drama (forthcoming, eds. Pia Majbritt Jensen and Ushma Chauhan Jacobsen); Dansk tv-drama 2005–2018 (forthcoming, Gunhild Agger); and The Showrunner Effect: System, Culture and Individual Agency in American Remakes of Danish Television Series (PhD dissertation, Aarhus University, Lynge Stegger Gemzøe). We will use this opportunity to thank the Danish research team for their professionalism and commitment, and their highly productive contributions. In this book we share the overall ideas and findings from our project about the traveling Danish television drama series. The book marks the end of the research project. However, our transnational media studies journey has just started.

Lessons Learned from Danish Drama Anne Marit Waade, Eva Novrup Redvall, and Pia Majbritt Jensen\n\nIntroduction When the Danish crime series Forbrydelsen (The Killing, 2007–2012) hit the British market in the early 2010s, attracting a surprising amount of interest from British viewers and critics, it became a global game-changer that not only created opportunities for the new export of Danish television drama to international markets, but also paved the way for subtitled and foreign drama as a new trend on television channels and Subscription-­ Video-­ on-Demand (SVOD) services (Redvall 2013; Bondebjerg and Redvall 2015; Eichner and Esser in this volume). The popularity of the\n\nA. M. Waade (*) • P. M. Jensen Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark e-mail: [email protected]; [email protected] E. N.

(eds.), Danish Television Drama, Palgrave European Film and Media Studies, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-40798-8_1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nDanish television drama series in the United Kingdom created opportunities for their export to new markets around the world (Jensen 2016). Danish broadcasters and producers experienced an increasing foreign demand for new/fresh Danish content; and in the following years, series such as Borgen (2010–2013), Bron/Broen/The Bridge (2011–2018), and Arvingerne (The Legacy, 2014–2017) travelled worldwide. The international success of Danish television drama interested and engaged the critics, the broadcasters, the distributors, the viewers, and the fans. In the 2010s, Nordic Noir emerged as a popular brand that built on the global success of Scandinavian crime fiction (Hansen and Waade 2017). Danish and other Nordic television drama and crime fiction have mobilized transnational online fan communities and inspired Nordic Noir tourism. In parallel with this, the growth of new and streaming services has led to a significant demand for content, and made drama an excellent ‘driver for sale’ (Lotz 2014; Steemers 2016). As a result of these trends, the Nordic region has experienced a general boom in the production of television drama series. Not only has Danish television drama travelled globally, so has Danish drama knowhow. For instance, producers from other countries have travelled to Denmark to learn more about the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) ‘dogmas’ for making engaging television series (Redvall 2013; Hochscherf and Philipsen 2017). The Nordic Noir style travels as well, for example in international series such as Fortitude (2015–2018), Hinterland (2013–2016), Broadchurch (2013–2017), Shetland (2013–), and The Kettering Incident (2016–) (Creeber 2015; Hansen and Waade 2017). Danish creators of drama productions (including producers, actors, and screenwriters) are also in international demand, and international broadcasters and producers are increasingly reaching out to Danish production companies and broadcasters to co-produce, remake, and collaborate with them, an example being the Danish-produced Netflix original series The Rain (2018–) (Nielsen 2016). Naturally, it is important to relate the international interest in Danish television drama series to the general international popularity of anything Nordic, be it food, fashion, architecture, landscapes, climate, candles, crime series, gender culture, or even the welfare state (Syvertsen et al. 2014) and bestselling books on ‘hygge’, ‘lykke’, ‘lagom’, and ‘how to be Danish’ (e.g. Kingsley 2013; Abrahams 2016). A reciprocal process is involved: Nordic Noir series and Danish television drama series strengthen the international interest in anything Nordic, and the international\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n3\n\npopularity of Nordic food, design, and culture makes it easier to sell Danish television drama series to international markets. The fact that Danish television drama series began to travel outside the Nordic region challenged fundamental understandings of—and theoretical approaches to—national and public service television drama production (Redvall 2013; Bondebjerg and Redvall 2015; Jensen et al. 2016; Jensen and McCutcheon 2020), as well as methodological approaches to the study of production and reception across countries and continents (Jensen and Jacobsen in this volume). This phenomenon called for a rethinking of the theoretical centre/periphery complexity within global television industries, in particular, cultural proximity and the role of small-­ nation screen production in a global media industry context (Straubhaar 2007; Jacobsen and Jensen 2016; McElroy et al. 2018). This chapter introduces a large-scale research project that studied how the international export of Danish television drama meets the challenges described above. In the following pages, we elaborate on this research project’s general findings and its theoretical and methodological contributions. We also introduce the other chapters of this edited volume, which analyse and explain specific aspects of the international success of Danish television drama, from the development of ‘screen ideas’ to the sale, distribution, and global reception of Danish series.\n\nResearching the Many Reasons Why Danish Television Series Suddenly Travelled ‘What Makes Danish TV Drama Series Travel?’ This question was the title of, and the research question that underlay, a large-scale research project funded by Independent Research Fund Denmark (2014–2019) and supported by the Aarhus University Research Fund (2014–2015). The study investigated why and how Danish television drama started travelling in the 2000s. The study comprised three principal sections: a production study (interviews with producers, screenwriters, and distributors, an ethnographic study of production processes and international television sales markets, and various studies with distinct focuses, such as screenwriting, international remakes, locations, international sales, and co-funding); a textual study (examining genres, mood, audiovisual style, place, and historical and cultural representation); and a reception study (examining media coverage, including interviews with distributors, broadcasters, and viewers in eight markets around the world: Argentina, Australia, Brazil,\n\n4\n\nA.

(DFF 2014–2019). The research project involved three research teams: the production study team, the text study team, and the audience study team\n\nGermany, Japan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States – as well as Denmark itself). Our ambition was to shed light on the specific transformations and value creations that took place at all stages of the production system of Danish television drama series, from idea to production, distribution, and reception processes (Fig. 1.1). Our study was divided into four distinct sub-questions, each shedding light on significant parts of this process, and including a particular set of interviews, data collection, and theoretical approaches: 1) How can we consider Danish TV drama series as an international brand? 2) What makes Danish TV drama series travel from a transnational production perspective? 3) How are Danish TV drama series interpreted and valued by audiences abroad, specifically in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Denmark itself? 4) How are small-nation drama series challenging the centre/periphery complex of the global media industry and culture?\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n5\n\nThe Danish research team consisted of nine scholars from the fields of media and screen studies and international business studies. The study was carried out by three teams, each with the distinct methodological and empirical ambition (production study, text study, and reception study) of improving insights into travelling Danish drama as a cultural and industrial phenomenon, and bringing together different theoretical perspectives and sets of data. As part of our research, we followed Danish television drama series around the world. We talked to producers, screenwriters, distributors, broadcasters, viewers, fans, and critics. We studied the series, the narratives, their aesthetics, and their production values. We also studied the media coverage of these series in some countries in order to see which of the series’ discourses and themes were touched upon in reviews around the world. As part of this project, we worked closely with researchers and universities connected to each of the specific markets that we were studying and with internationally recognized scholars in the field of transnational screen studies.\n\nTransnational Screen Studies and Small-Nation Television Cultures The concept of ‘travelling television drama’ is related to theories of transnational television and transnational culture. The definition of ‘transnational’ was negotiated and developed throughout the 2000s and 2010s, and is linked to the rich field of academic theories on globalization and mediatization. Jean Chalaby analyses television formats and argues that a new order of local, national, regional, and global levels has emerged: ‘The TV format chain may be global, the adaption process and transfer of expertise may be transnational, but TV formats begin and end their lives as local shows’ (Chalaby 2016, 187). Andrea Esser (2014) explains that transnational television content, whether factual entertainment formats or television drama, is an object of ongoing negotiation across national borders. According to Elke Weissmann (2012), travelling television drama should be regarded as two sides of the same coin: national and international. Weissmann’s study of the relationship between British and American television drama illustrates how television drama that travels between the two countries and continents becomes essentially transnational, and ‘the industries operate, consume, produce and think transnationally’ (Weissmann 2012, 6). The recent development of streaming services reinforces this transnationalism in production, financing, and narratives:\n\n6\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nA review of the economic underpinning of almost any new European television series will demonstrate that the financing of television has become at once both local and international. Motivated by new funding practices, in the space of two or three decades, TV series have become a financially glocal phenomenon marked by local, national, regional and transnational players. The most recent decade (2008–2018) has also seen the introduction of new global streaming services into this mix (Hansen et al. 2018, 7).\n\nMette Hjort (2010) argues that the concept of transnationalism itself has become trendy, and consequently that it has also become imprecise. She suggests that a distinction be drawn between unmarked and marked transnationality (Hjort 2010, 13), whereby marked transnationality foregrounds the transnational elements of a given film or television drama, whether this relates to production, distribution, reception, narrative, or cinematography (for further discussion, see Weissmann 2012; Agger 2016; Bondebjerg 2016; Hansen and Waade 2017, 221). The study of the international export of Danish television drama clearly reveals that transnationalization—marked and unmarked—involves not only production but also overarching themes and stories, aesthetics, audience reception, and distribution (Agger 2016; Agger, this volume). The instance of Danish television drama further demonstrates that local, non-­ Anglophone languages and places have become significant selling points in a global media market (see Hansen in this volume). Moreover, the fact that a small nation such as Denmark can produce content that is attractive to a broader global media market, and influence cultural trends, challenges the centre/periphery dichotomy that has dominated global media culture in modern times (for further elaboration, see Jensen and Jacobsen, this volume). Finally, the Danish case focuses on the role of public service broadcasters (PSBs) in small nations and on how recent international attention has resulted in significant changes in the production cultures in Nordic countries, including among the Nordic PSBs (see Sundet, this volume).\n\nUnderstanding Television Production in Terms of Different Screen Idea Systems In line with creativity researcher Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s statement that creativity never develops in a vacuum (1999, 315), a fundamental understanding that guided this research project is that screen production is always shaped by the people involved and by the particular places and\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n7\n\nmedia systems from which new ideas emerge, and where they are produced and distributed. We regard different production frameworks as various forms of screen idea systems (Redvall 2013, 2016), with new series being marked by the dynamics involved when people propose new ideas based on the traditions, trends, and tastes of the existing domain. These ideas must be accepted by the group of individuals who may be regarded as gatekeepers to the domain in question, gatekeepers who are constantly searching for a specific type of content (Fig. 1.2). DR has been the primary producer of Danish television drama for many years, so Danish television series are fundamentally based on a strong public service tradition that has influenced the kinds of stories and the storytelling strategies that emerged for particular time-slots and audiences. This project studied the way in which this tradition was challenged in the 2010s when, following the success of Danish series such as Forbrydelsen and Borgen, new national players started to produce television dramas, and, from 2012, when international players such as Netflix and HBO Nordic entered the domestic market. The 2010s witnessed a number of remarkable changes among the main producers of television drama and in terms\n\nTastes Trends Traditions\n\nSelects Novelty\n\nMandate Management Money\n\nTransmits Information\n\nProduces Novelty Stimulates Novelty\n\nFig. 1.2 The Screen Idea System (Redvall 2013, 31)\n\nTalent Training Track record\n\n8\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nof the content produced, something that several chapters in this volume address from various perspectives—comparing television drama traditions with current trends and tastes. Text and context are linked, and it makes sense always to regard production as the interplay of the three main forces outlined in the screen idea system: the people creating new series based on their particular talents, training, and track record; the series that already exist in the domain, to which all new ideas will be compared and with which they will have to compete; and the gatekeepers with a certain mandate and specific managerial ideas about what to produce, but with an often too-limited amount of money at their disposal for financing expensive drama series. Many of the chapters in this book explore these dynamics, for instance indicating the way in which individual showrunners or commissioners have a huge impact in specific small-nation screen idea systems. The notion of ‘track record’ is always at work when commissioners and financers decide whether to risk new ideas, often leading to a centralization of power that makes it hard for new talent to emerge. Television production is always high risk and always marked by the media industry mantra that ‘nobody knows’, because there is no recipe for success. Drawing on the interplay outlined in the screen idea system, this book explores some of the systemic, creative, textual, and audience aspects that may be regarded as important to the recent success of series that originate in a small-nation production framework such as Denmark.\n\nThe Values of Television Drama and the Transnational Value Ecosystem By taking the transnational circulation of Danish television drama series as its point of departure, this project explored the particular value creation that emerged at all stages of drama development, from idea to production, cross-sector collaboration, distribution, international reception, and fandom. In a Nordic context, discussing the values of publicly funded screen production has become more important than ever, because a media welfare state with nationally subsidized media such as Denmark needs to legitimize and embed the fact that it spends tax money on producing media entertainment and drama series (Lowe and Martin 2013; Syvertsen et al. 2014; Raats et al. 2016). We suggest a transnational value ecosystem model that describes this value creation, which takes place at all stages of\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n9\n\ndrama production and development. The underlying idea is that the transnationalization of Danish drama series increases their value for both domestic and international audiences. Our model is based on Turnbull and McCutcheon’s idea of a ‘total value model’ that frames a qualitative analysis of the cultural value generated by crime series (Turnbull and McCutcheon 2017, 6). The authors cluster the various financial values of television crime series into three main groups: first, values related to the production process; secondly, values related to the consumers (value to audience, including ratings and sales, critic and fan responses); and finally, values related to society in general (indirect benefits of the series that accrue to society as a whole). With regard to the production process, Turnbull and McCutcheon further distinguish values that may accrue for the creators and producers during screen idea development, other creative personnel during production, and sales intermediaries during distribution (Fig. 1.3). In contrast to the common vertical supply chain for media production and distribution (Doyle 2002; Turnbull and McCutcheon 2017), our model is circular, thus pinpointing the fact that each drama series is part of a larger cultural circulation of ideas and synergies. The circular value ecosystem model was inspired by Filmby Aarhus (2013) and Månsson and Eskilsson’s (2013) value-chain model for screen tourism, in which the dynamics between industries (in this case tourism and the screen industry) are emphasized. The fact that Danish screen production adds value to other sectors, trends, and industries, such as nation branding, the Nordic wave and tourism, and television channels and streaming services abroad, Fig. 1.3 The Transnational Value Ecosystem of Danish television drama\n\n10\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nis not captured by a traditional linear value-chain model. The cross-sector added value may also be understood as a spill-over effect by which value creation in one sector or industry creates value for other related sectors and industries (Fleming 2015). To emphasize these circular, dynamic processes and the spill-over effects of the transnational value creation of Danish drama series, we call the model a value ecosystem model.\n\nLocation Studies and Nordic Noir A central contribution to research that is informed by the study of travelling Danish television drama series is the location study model (Fig. 1.4). Kim Toft Hansen and Anne Marit Waade (2017) take the significant use of locations in Nordic Noir series as their point of departure. Nordic Noir is characterized by the remarkable use of landscapes, climate, mood, and lighting (also see Jensen and Waade 2013; Creeber 2015; Agger and Waade 2018). The authors analyse local colour in their research on Nordic crime series, and apply it to their study of contemporary crime series and crime fiction from Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Finland. The location study model encompasses both on-screen features and off-screen factors, relating the places that appear on screen to the production site. The general idea is that off-screen factors influence and inform the way on-screen features are displayed and received. Off-screen factors include aspects such as production facilities, studios, and local professionals (sites of production); local funding systems and screen industry strategies (policies of place); the actual places used, including their historical and physical character (geographical places); and finally the extent to which the places and film locations are known and promoted as tourist destinations (place as destination). The on-screen features encompass various categories of setting: from urban/rural places, architecture and design, and climate and weather conditions, to shore/island/inland settings, and mobility and infrastructure. Together, the off-screen and on-screen features influence the role played by the setting of a series (visual, dramaturgical, and referential). This model may be used in a textual–analytical approach to analysing series, but also as a way to design and analyse an empirical study of production that focuses on the settings. The overall idea is that there is a clear link between the increasing transnationalization of Danish television drama on the one hand and the significant use of Nordic settings, climates, and cultural conditions in a television series on the other (also see Hansen, this volume; Waade, this volume).\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA?

This model arose in response to one of our central concerns, namely the construction of a methodological lens that captured the multitude of\n\n12\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nplayers involved in viewing Danish television drama outside its immediate geo-­linguistic region of Scandinavia and the complexity of their interrelationships, while remaining as methodologically and theoretically explorative as possible when analysing emerging data. This methodological lens brought transnational audiences into focus in a novel way, revealing audiences not only as regular audiences or as statistics extracted from television ratings, but also as a ‘three-leaf clover’ of interacting players, each of which is an audience in a different capacity and each of which plays a key role in the transnational success of Danish television drama. The three-leaf clover comprises (1) television industry distributors and broadcasters who act as gatekeepers to international markets; (2) other professional actors in the media industry, such as journalists, bloggers, and television critics, who act as cultural intermediaries; and (3) regular audiences who act by watching series on television or diverse online streaming services. The metaphor of the three-leaf clover conveys a certain sense of a paradoxical sameness and difference. The three leaves refer to all three broad groups as ‘audiences’ that interact with, interpenetrate, and influence one another. But there are also boundaries within and between them that make each grouping distinct and separate. Secondly, each leaf is similar to the other two, which means that no specific grouping is methodologically privileged over another—they all exert influence in some ways, and the nature and extent of this influence and their interdependence must be empirically established within specific contexts. Thirdly, the metaphor of the clover leaf conveys a fragility of relationships and arrangements, which is a distinctive trait of sociopolitical and economic relations in an age of globalization (see Jensen and Jacobsen 2017; Jensen and Jacobsen in this volume). For the detailed account of the eight-country global study in all its variety, we refer to the edited volume published previously this year (Jensen and Jacobsen 2020). Audiences are often somewhat overlooked when the analytical focus is on production strategies or the content produced. However, apart from this project’s extensive reception studies, one important aspect has been the investigation of how certain ideas of audiences and concrete audience feedback during production may inform the production processes and help create stronger series. Consequently, there was a dialogue with media researchers such as Lene Heiselberg (DR Media Research) during the research project, leading among other things to an outline of how DR media researchers have been involved in testing drama content for many years, using traditional qualitative methods, such as focus groups, as well\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n13\n\nas new biometric methods, such as measuring skin conductance to learn more about audience arousal and offering feedback to those developing the series (Redvall 2017). Recent years have seen an increased interest in trying to develop series based on research into the intended target group, as was the case with the Norwegian hit teenage drama SKAM (2015–2018), which was created based on extensive research into the lives and thoughts of 16-year-old Norwegian girls (Redvall 2018). There are exciting perspectives in bringing production and audience studies closer together. The close collaboration between the various research teams in this project led to a number of interesting conversations that crossed research traditions and approaches, and proved valuable in this regard.\n\nCritical Perspectives on the Success of Danish Series: Is Imitation the Sincerest Form of Flattery? Danish television producers and broadcasters specifically and Denmark’s cultural industries and global brand more generally have undoubtedly benefited tremendously from the unprecedented international popularity of Danish television drama. This is evident in many of the chapters in this anthology. Internationally, Danish drama has unquestionably punched above its weight, and in the process moved Denmark away from the periphery of the global television market and closer to the centre—at least for a while. As Creeber (2015), Jensen (2016), and Turnbull and McCutcheon (2017) have emphasized, the traditional (often Anglophone) centres have not been slow to pick up on Denmark’s and Scandinavia’s success, producing a large number of series heavily influenced by Danish series and the general Nordic Noir trend: Fortitude, Broadchurch, Hinterland, The Kettering Incident, and The Code, to name a few. There have also been American and British–French adaptations of series such as Forbrydelsen and Bron/Broen. As these productions originate from well-known and fairly significant broadcasters and production companies in large, predominantly Anglophone markets, they generate more revenue and capture larger, more mainstream, global audiences than the original series. This is because English-language series will be sold to larger broadcasters and larger channels, and be given a more attractive time slot, resulting in significantly higher audience ratings, thanks to the historical dominance of\n\n14\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nthe American and British television markets in particular, and because English, the global lingua franca, is used as the production language. In this sense, these series operate in a global macro-market, in contrast to the global micro-market in which the Danish series operate. One example of these dynamics is found in the Australian market, where the original The Bridge was broadcast by the second public broadcaster, SBS, which has an average audience share of 4–5%, while the British–French adaptation (The Tunnel) was broadcast by the main public broadcaster, ABC, with an average share closer to 20%. Financially, this means that in the global market, Danish series trade for considerably less than American and British series. Moreover, Anglophone series are likely to be exported to more regions worldwide, which also generates larger revenues. Although imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery, we argue that in the case of Nordic Noir, imitation has been the means by which established global players exploit the trend, to a degree that may ultimately dilute the very brand and thereby saturate (at the very least) the global niche market for Danish and other Nordic broadcasters and producers. This means that despite global export and creative accolades, international prizes, and critical acclaim for Danish television drama— which must not be underestimated—the already dominant markets have also benefited considerably from its success. Indeed, financially speaking, they have probably benefited even more than the Danish market itself. The combination of increased digitization and convergence caused a rapid shift in the business models of the audiovisual industry over the course of this project. The television sector’s traditional revenue and financing models are under pressure, which has increased competition among legacy media and between legacy media and new players such as Netflix and HBO (Evens and Donders 2018). For television drama produced in small markets and by PSBs, three intertwining developments have increased the pressure on domestic production (see Raats and Jensen 2020). First, television viewing is moving from a linear paradigm to a non-­ linear one via Video-on-Demand and SVOD, provided by national broadcasters and distributors and international Over-the-Top (OTT) services alike. The quality offerings of the latter—including Netflix and HBO— mean that they can compete directly with series transmitted by PSBs such as DR. Naturally, broadcasters and producers could (at least theoretically) generate additional revenue by selling television drama on more platforms and in more windows, as well as to different territories, and this is\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n15\n\nhappening to a certain degree. However, the rise of new distribution platforms has also increased the pressure on traditional broadcasters, which no longer enjoy their previous exclusivity when it comes to television series. Secondly, not only do new OTT streaming services challenge traditional broadcasters, but they also invest in original content. The fact that Netflix operates worldwide provides advantages related to economies of scale, leading to investment in large-budget productions for the global market. However, given their global business model, Netflix and HBO are less likely to invest in other than token productions from smaller (language) markets such as Denmark, as subscription numbers in small markets are correspondingly far lower and therefore investments there are riskier than in larger (language) markets. Thirdly, the past decade has seen a series of significant public broadcasting cutbacks. In 2018, the European Broadcasting Union (2018) reported a drop of 2.8% in real terms of financing of European PSB, and DR is no exception, with their licence fee being turned into a media tax and their budgets cut substantially for the 2019–2022 period.\n\nThe Structure of this Book and the Individual Chapters As mentioned previously, this book builds on research conducted as part of the ‘What Makes Danish TV Drama Series Travel?’ project, in combination with related research by scholars who were affiliated with it during the four years that it ran. The chapters illustrate how the study of Danish television series has been approached from a variety of analytical perspectives by Danish scholars and those from other countries who explore the nature of the series themselves, as well as the context surrounding their production, distribution, and reception. The first section of this book focuses on the dynamics between national and transnational perspectives with respect to understanding the recent success of Danish drama series. In the first chapter of this section, Chap. 2, Gunhild Agger approaches recent Danish series from a historical perspective, outlining main developments in drama production from 1995 until 2015. Based on theories about golden ages, the chapter argues that the main television drama developments in those 20 years are an example of the emergence of a fruitful golden age in a small nation’s public-service drama production, which inspired new developments in neighbouring\n\n16\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\ncountries, such as Norway. Agger makes the case that golden ages have always travelled from one country and cultural context to another, and emphasizes the value of exploring how golden ages emerge and develop not only from a national perspective, but also from a transnational perspective. In Chap. 3, Janet McCabe uses a case study of the political drama series Borgen to investigate how watching and debating television drama may be regarded as a special kind of public sphere in the age of globalization, and that PSBs in particular have an important part to play in this arena in terms of putting certain topics on the agenda. McCabe draws on Pierre Bourdieu’s cultural and sociological ideas to explore how a series such as Borgen has been legitimated and its value accepted and circulated through a widely distributed network of various agents and institutions. The chapter uses this case study to discuss what happens when the productions of national broadcasting cultures become part of transnational flows, and how to think about cultural encounters like this in the current media landscape. Based on her extensive studies of media production in Wales, Ruth McElroy, in Chap. 4, explores a transnational perspective to analyse what Wales learned from the successful export of Danish television drama. The focus of this chapter is on bilingual crime drama, investigating the cultural mobility of Nordic Noir from the perspective of contemporary Welsh-­ language and bilingual television drama production. Adapting insights from linguistics, postcolonial studies, and minority-language media studies, this chapter examines how Nordic Noir operates in contemporary transnational global television cultures, and how small-nation production cultures naturally compare strategies and seek inspiration for successful strategies in other small markets. The second section of this book focuses on small-nation drama production. In Chap. 5, Kim Toft Hansen looks at the ‘glocal’ perspectives of Danish television drama. Drawing on case studies and qualitative interviews, Hansen argues that theories of transnationalism do not fully explain current trends in contemporary television production/funding practices. Hansen suggests instead that the theoretical concept of glocalization contributes fruitful perspectives that explain the co-existence of local, national, regional, and global players in television drama production and the different strategies chosen, for instance in relation to co-production. In Chap. 6, Jakob Isak Nielsen focuses specifically on the Danish series themselves, offering a visual-style analysis of the use of the colour green in\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n17\n\nthe Swedish/Danish crime series The Bridge. Building on film scholar David Bordwell’s work, Nielsen argues that overt style has an important function in several Nordic series and, accordingly, is important for understanding their international appeal. This chapter explores how overt style has evolved and been transformed historically, with overt practices in Danish mini-series from the 2000s reappearing in long-form series, where they assume a less obtrusive but still stylized form. In Chap. 7, Eva Novrup Redvall analyses The Team (2014–) as an attempt to create a European crime series based on what were perceived as effective Danish production practices. This chapter explores the difficulties of trying to export a specific production culture and outlines some of the clashes and conflicts that arise when one nation’s notions of best practices encounter a transnational cast, crew, and setting. Although much may be learned by adopting what seem to be effective production practices from other broadcasting frameworks, this chapter illustrates that co-­ production inevitably entails new challenges, particularly in terms of communication and translation across languages and cultures, in screenplays and on set, and in many different and sometimes surprising aspects of production. In the last chapter in this section, Chap. 8, Vilde Schanke Sundet analyses how the recent emergence of strong SVOD players, such as Netflix, in the Scandinavian markets and their ambition of appealing to younger audiences have challenged traditional ways of producing and distributing national drama series. Using the first NRK–Netflix production, Lilyhammer (2012–2014), and the NRK teen drama SKAM (2015–2017) as examples, this chapter investigates how the intent to produce different kinds of Norwegian flagship productions has been influenced by new production set-ups, such as the collaboration between the PSB NRK and Netflix and new distribution practices, such as the cross-media, real-time broadcasting of SKAM. Sundet argues that this development has been facilitated by the impact of Danish series and the general interest in Nordic content, but that the Norwegian television production landscape has been marked by remarkably different success stories and strategies. The last section of this book focuses on a number of different perspectives on distribution, reception, and audience engagement, ranging from audience encounters with Danish series to audiences’ desire to visit the actual locations and the countries where they were shot. Drawing on the extensive audience studies of the project, in Chap. 9, Pia Majbritt Jensen and Ushma Chauhan Jacobsen first outline different ways in which to\n\n18\n\nA. M. WAADE ET AL.\n\nthink about proximities theory, and focus on the notions of remoteness and closeness in an analysis of how emotional proximities connect individuals at the level of perceived universal affect that transcends cultural differences. They also discuss how cosmopolitan proximities connect individuals with distant others through perceptions of stylistic and ethical/ political sameness, and how grapevine proximities connect individuals in meshes of media industry and personal networks through viva voce, word of mouth. This chapter illustrates how these three forms of proximity have influenced the acquisition, viewing, and generally positive reception of Danish television drama in many different ways. In Chap. 10, Susanne Eichner and Andrea Esser focus on the distribution and consumption of Danish television drama series abroad, offering a comparative perspective on developments in the German and British markets. Their analysis illustrates how Danish series entered these two instrumental markets in very different ways, while considering the specific German and British market dynamics alongside broader technological changes and attendant market transformations. Their analysis reveals the many factors related to programme import, and the increasingly transnational character of television production, distribution, and consumption. In Chap. 11, Ib Bondebjerg uses the crime series The Bridge to offer a qualitative case study of a cultural encounter between a Danish series and its international audiences. This chapter analyses the demographic profile of the audiences of this series and the discourses surrounding it in selected newspapers and social media. The reception study reveals the presence of a fascination with Nordic Noir as a genre, but also demonstrates that the reception of the series was marked by social, political, and cultural themes and an exchange of different norms and lifestyles. Bondebjerg argues that small-nation content such as Danish television series may lead to cultural encounters that challenge established patterns of national understanding, and that in this regard The Bridge is a remarkable example. In the book’s final chapter, Chap. 12, Anne Marit Waade investigates Nordic Noir tourism as an example of fan culture and long-tail marketing, and as the result of strategic collaboration across industries with an interest in screen production and tourism. The chapter outlines how Nordic Noir tourism has developed since the early 2000s, and uses case studies of Wallander, The Killing, The Bridge, and Dicte to explore the framing and marketing of these series, as well as their distinct use of place. The analysis demonstrates that Nordic Noir tourism is a transnational phenomenon in the creative economy, which is often marked by deliberate market\n\n1 TRANSNATIONAL TELEVISION DRAMA? LESSONS LEARNED…\n\n19\n\nstrategies and screen tourism initiatives. This chapter concludes that the balance between factual and fictional places engages screen tourists, and documents how Nordic Noir tourism has developed into small enterprises that attract enthusiasts throughout the Nordic countries. This interest in Nordic Noir tourism and location has reached such a level that it represents a possible new source of funding for television drama productions, as well as new cross-sector collaborations and strategic partnerships, thereby underlining that the value created by television series may take many forms. As the outline of this book’s chapters shows, the findings of the joint research project contribute to a number of different fields and offer theoretical and methodological perspectives that have implications beyond the analysis of one particular small nation’s television culture. The global lesson learned from the story of Danish television drama is that drama series from a small, non-Anglophone country can travel worldwide and pave the way for subtitled and foreign drama, thus feeding into the general Nordic and Danish trend. Even though this trend may have peaked, and the golden age of Danish television drama may be declining (Agger, this volume), there are no signs yet that the international demand for Danish television drama content, production knowhow, and creative employees has decreased. And with the growing market for streaming services, the demand for content and co-productions that position and market channels, broadcasters, and platform providers will remain. By focusing on the theoretical framework (theories on transnational television drama and the screen idea system model) that informed this research, and the general findings and theoretical and methodological contributions to the academic field, the intent of this introduction is to draw attention to the general lines, trends, and challenges of this study— in particular, the transnational value ecosystem model, the location study model, and the transnational three-leaf-clover audience studies model. There are many other lessons in the following chapters that draw on the rich empirical material of this research project. Happy reading.\n\nReferences Abrahams, Charlotte. 2016.

There is abundant documentation of the fact that highlights such as Forbrydelsen/The Killing (DR1, 2007–2012) and Borgen (DR1, 2010–2013) acquired special status among producers and audiences worldwide, and that these series garnered a remarkable reception and impact (e.g. Jensen and Jacobsen 2017; Creeber 2015; Bondebjerg and Redvall 2015). In their introduction to Beyond the Bridge: Contemporary Danish Television Drama (2017), Tobias Hochscherf and Heidi Philipsen present the concept of a golden age as a truism: ‘The last decade has been a golden era for Danish television drama’ (Hochscherf and Philipsen 2017, 1). In research and its dissemination, the term has gradually developed into a standard designation that is synonymous with success. This is also the case in DR’s own marketing of series and generally in the press. The frequent use of the term is an invitation to trace its origins and meaning.\n\nG. Agger (*) Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark e-mail: [email protected] © The Author(s) 2020 A. M. Waade et al. (eds.), Danish Television Drama, Palgrave European Film and Media Studies, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-40798-8_2\n\n25\n\n26\n\nG. AGGER\n\nEquating a ‘golden age’ with success, in her 2004 book Pernille Nordstrøm introduced the term in the context of Danish television drama. Her presentation was concise and pragmatic: ‘[DR] has succeeded in uniting a level of artistic ambition with the audience appeal for which the series were created. Generally speaking, one success has been followed by another, to such an extent that it must be legitimate to mark the phenomenon as the golden age of the Danish television series’ (Nordstrøm 2004, 8, my translation). Her criteria for a golden age were artistic ambition and audience appeal, resulting in success. These criteria call for further reflection. One of the overarching aims of the major research project What Makes Danish Television Drama Series Travel? was to more precisely examine the question of recognition at various levels. Building on the research carried out for the project, this chapter analyses and discusses the explanatory power of the concept of the golden age in relation to this unusually productive period of Danish television drama production. The concept of the golden age is under-theorized, considering its popularity in research as well as in common usage. Coined by the Greek poet Hesiod, the term ‘golden age’ is globally used to identify a period of high-­ level achievement. This chapter takes Hesiod’s fundamental contribution as its point of departure, together with literary scholar Jurij M. Lotman’s theories of cultural exchange and renewal. Lotman (1990) has argued that certain patterns can be traced in the cultural exchange that takes place when golden ages travel from one country to another. Following this idea, this chapter compares recent developments in Danish television drama to earlier periods in television drama from the United Kingdom and the United States of America that have been identified as ‘golden’. Finally, the recent Danish drama scenario is compared with current developments in series from Norway, concluding with a discussion of what may be learned from a more nuanced understanding of thinking about, discussing, and labelling various periods of television drama as ‘golden’.\n\nStudying Television Drama Production and Cultural Exchange Several researchers have used a production studies approach when investigating what is widely recognized as the golden age of Danish television drama, and have documented profound changes in production culture. This applies especially to the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR). Eva\n\n2 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DANISH PUBLIC SERVICE DRAMA SERIES\n\n27\n\nNovrup Redvall’s work (2013) is an invaluable contribution to understanding the processes behind the series, highlighting creative developments and new collaborative approaches especially in the area of screenwriting. Later, Hochscherf and Philipsen (2017), Degn and Krogager (2017), and Jakob Isak Nielsen (2016), among others, have applied this approach, supplementing the existing results from different angles. New methods of transnational cooperation have also been analysed, highlighting how basic public service drama values have been exported (Jensen et al. 2016; Jensen and Jacobsen 2017; Esser 2017). One influential approach to television studies has focused on the way that ‘quality television’ (Nelson 2007) or ‘complex television’ (Mittell 2015) in drama series has redefined the cultural field in which it operates, taking on challenging themes and complex storytelling. In this way, television drama has contributed to debating the state of the nation and, further, to compare the state of different nations. This has entailed more innovative narrative patterns, redefined genres and genre mixing, the development of a distinctive noir style, and in particular increased complexity of characters and plot development (Nielsen 2016; Nelson 2016). An important point of view on the societal impact of television drama is found in the extensive research that surrounds the phenomenon labelled ‘Nordic Noir’, which originated in the Swedish crime bestsellers that paved the way for an international interest in all things Nordic (StougaardNielsen 2017). Nordic Noir certainly had momentum during the 2000s and 2010s, and undoubtedly the composite Nordic Noir brand strongly contributed to the international breakthrough of Danish television drama through its choices of location and style (Hansen and Waade 2017), and prevailing themes and characters (Waade and Jensen 2013; Agger 2016). I argue that the foregoing perspectives are not mutually exclusive but complementary approaches. Each examines parts of the transnational cultural exchange processes that have developed, with increasing speed, during this period. I argue that in many ways the second golden age of American television contributed to the emergence of the Danish one, which in turn has been instrumental in what may be regarded as the current golden age of Norwegian television drama. Which processes facilitated this? I will focus on the processes of cultural exchange and renewal, but first I present an introduction to Hesiod’s thoughts on golden ages.\n\n28\n\nG. AGGER\n\nThe Classical Concept of the Golden Age It is common knowledge that throughout the history of civilization gold has been attractive because of its permanence, which adds to its practical value as well as to its mythological status—practical value because gold was accepted as payment everywhere; mythological status because of its brilliant appearance and durability. Although the prize of the antique sports contests was a laurel wreath, gold, silver, and bronze were later included in the world of sport to symbolize the value of the medals awarded at major sports venues such as the Olympic Games. What, then, is a golden age? The prevailing definition is stated briefly in the Oxford English Dictionary as a ‘period when a specified art or activity is at its peak’. The way in which the concept is generally used originates in Hesiod’s Works and Days, written at the end of the eighth or the beginning of the seventh century BCE. Directly or indirectly, this poem provides the basis for the common understanding of this concept as presented in any encyclopedia. Here, Hesiod gives an account of the so-called Myth of the Ages. The combination of myth, everyday life, advice, and directions that follow each other without any transition makes it difficult to determine the work’s genre and assess its value. Translator and commentator Lene Andersen (1973) has convincingly characterized Works and Days as the most personal of Hesiod’s works, his intent being that his contemporaries should know about their past, including the gods’ actions and motives, in order to understand their present conditions. In Works and Days, Hesiod (c.700 B.C., 1914) introduces two golden age myths. The first explains the end of the happy age of humanity through the tale of Pandora. When Pandora raised the lid of the jar entrusted to her, a myriad of misfortunes escaped. This version is followed by an alternative version, the so-called Myth of the Ages, which divides the transition from happiness to misfortune into five phases, ranging from mythological time, or ‘Cronos’ time’, to the present. Hesiod’s ideas imply that periods are characterized by certain traits and that all periods will end, to be replaced by others in a constant process of change. Generation is a key concept in these changes. Hesiod distinguishes among five different generations that are marked by certain characteristics, which I summarize here with a few quotes to try to convey the essence of his ideas. 1. The Golden Age is characterized by harmony between people and nature in an ideal state without conflicts or the need to work: ‘And\n\n2 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DANISH PUBLIC SERVICE DRAMA SERIES\n\n29\n\nthey lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them’ (Hesiod ll. 109–120). 2. The Silver Generation is honoured without reason. It takes a hundred years for it to reach maturity, and when it finally achieves this it is characterized by hubris and ‘a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness’ (ll. 121–139). 3. Mankind of the third generation, the Bronze Age, ‘loved the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence; they ate no bread, but were hard of heart like adamant, fearful men’ (ll. 140–155). 4. The fourth generation, in contrast to the previous one, consists of heroes—the heroes of the Odyssey and the Iliad. As idols, they are ‘nobler and more righteous’ than the Bronze generation. After the Trojan War, they live on ‘islands of the blessed,’ where they harvest crops three times a year and enjoy ‘honor and glory’ (ll. 156–169b). 5. The fifth generation, Hesiod’s contemporaries, live in the Iron Age. They are contrasted with the generation of heroes, materially and spiritually: ‘For now truly is a race of iron, and men never rest from labour and sorrow by day, and from perishing by night; and the gods shall lay sore trouble upon them. But, notwithstanding, even these shall have some good mingled with their evils’ (ll. 170–201). Contrary to common understanding, Hesiod did not consider the Myth of the Ages as a story of pure decline. The fact that the Silver and Bronze Age generations represent a decline in relation to the Golden Age generation is undeniable. However, it is questionable whether the bellicose Bronze Age was that much worse than the lazy, invalid Silver Age. In any case, the heroes’ generation represents a kind of renaissance of the Golden Age. Although Hesiod complains about his contemporaries and wishes he were born in another era, the later sections of Works and Days argue that by taking appropriate precautions people could live effortless, cheerful, and active lives, even in what he calls the Iron Age. Admittedly, the Golden Age represents the ideal, but it is significant that all the other epochs manifest good and evil to various degrees. Moreover, the concept of time, or the concept of separate eras, is used to explain society’s fundamental cohesiveness. Regardless of any individual endeavour, the genus or generation displays a common spirit bred by the conditions of its time. Although this spirit is universally acclaimed in its own era, it changes with the next generation.\n\n30\n\nG. AGGER\n\nIn conclusion, since Antiquity, the concept of the golden age has appeared universally in literary and art histories to describe a period whose creations are indisputably characterized by an extraordinarily high degree of artistry. However, in light of Hesiod’s original understanding of the golden age’s relationship to both the good and bad that followed it, the implications of a golden age need further thought. We need to answer questions such as: Which are the most significant identifiers of a golden age? When does a golden age begin? When does it end? What happens in between? Is there a general model for its course? I shall discuss the first question in light of British and American television drama history, and the remaining questions will be examined from the perspective of Jurij M. Lotman’s reflections.\n\n‘Important Moments’—British and American Perspectives In the field of British television drama, the concept of the golden age is widely used to characterize the period from the mid-1960s to the 1970s. For instance, John Caughie argues that the term is appropriate with regard to the idea of television drama, itself a central component of post-war British culture, reflecting a transition in the wider culture. In this context, Caughie theorizes about the concept, simultaneously claiming and disputing its relevance: There is, however, a sense in which the idea of a Golden Age may be meaningful: when it refers to that historical moment when one set of meanings and values is being replaced by another, when the traditions which stabilized a culture are beginning to be questioned and rewritten, and when creativity seems to transgress the boundaries of received good taste. (Caughie 2000, 57)\n\nAgainst this background, Caughie argues ‘that in the years after 1964 television drama became one of the key sites of this moment’ (Caughie 2000, 57). Accordingly, it held a privileged position when it came to changing what he calls ‘the marketable images of Britishness in the national and international imaginary’ (Caughie 2000, 6). Caughie does not indicate when the period ended, but he points out its intermediate character, its path prepared by theatre and film from the 1950s. From an institutional perspective, the golden age was inaugurated by the Pilkington\n\n2 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DANISH PUBLIC SERVICE DRAMA SERIES\n\n31\n\nreport of 1962, which was highly critical of commercial television. Pleading for public service values, it supported the foundation of BBC Two in 1964 (Petley 2015, 6). In his history of television drama, Lez Cooke (2015) emphasizes what he calls ‘the important moments in the historical development’ of the single play, serials, landmark serials, series, and soap operas (Cooke 2015, 2), and his account concentrates on defining these moments. The 1960s–1970s golden age does not stand alone. Cooke has pointed out that since the recent turn of the century, British television drama has been enjoying a renaissance. According to Cooke, the fact is ‘that the advent of digital channels and the internet has increased the outlets for drama, and that the range, variety and quality of British television drama is now as great, if not indeed greater, than it was in the mythical “golden age” of the 1960s–70s’ (Cooke 2015, 249). This assessment corresponds with Trisha Dunleavy’s, who is referring to the international television drama landscape when she claims that ‘creative innovation in high-end series and serials has been a strategic, integral element of television’s response to the unprecedented pressures and opportunities that increasing multi-channel competition, technological convergence, and market fragmentation have combined to present’ (Dunleavy 2009, 199). There is general agreement among historical television drama researchers that a golden age of American television drama occurred as early as the 1950s. This period witnessed the creation of classical television drama that was characterized by originality and a pioneering spirit. In the United States, this kind of television drama was embodied in the so-called ‘anthology drama’ on different networks. This included adaptations of plays and literary works as well as original television films. Stage plays and literature yielded cultural authority to the new television medium. Television historian Erik Barnouw has highlighted the close connection with the theatre community in New York as crucial on the artistic level (Barnouw 1990, 154)—just as the London stage was later to British television. Television drama historians disagree on whether there have been two or three golden ages in American television. Robert J. Thompson’s book Television’s Second Golden Age (1996) emphatically identifies a second golden age, from 1981 to 1996. Others reserve this designation for the period from 2000 to the present. According to Thompson, the second golden age was introduced in 1981 with Hill Street Blues (NBC, 1981–1987), and comprised ‘Serious Literary Writer-Based Drama’\n\n32\n\nG. AGGER\n\n(Thompson 1997, 30). In his book, he analyses its groundbreaking character. The crucial elements he identifies in the 1980s aesthetic breakthrough may be summarized as: 1) series of episodes of about one hour’s duration, which spanned several seasons, utilizing television’s unique capacity to mimic everyday life; 2) an interest in popular genre conventions (crime, legal drama, soap opera, etc.) that are renewed by using 3) complex characters and narratives mastered by a showrunner/author in a form that uses symbols and allusions (Thompson 1997, 31–32). Thompson concludes that ‘As the Golden Age of Television was rooted in the legitimate stage, quality dramas were rooted in the soap opera’ (Thompson 1997, 35), a form that understood how to use multiple plots and narrative tracks that ran in parallel through multiple episodes. As noted, there is disagreement about the dividing lines between American television’s golden ages. An important reason for this is that many of the features that characterize the third golden age in American television repeat Thomson’s characterization of the second golden age— for instance, the crucial role of the main author/showrunner, and the use of multiple plots to promote narrative complexity in long-running drama series. If the second golden age ended in 1996 and the third began in the late 1990s, the periods are so closely linked together that a certain overlap is hardly surprising. Several alternative designations have been applied to a third golden age, from ‘post television’ (Pearson 2007) and ‘quality television’ (Nelson 2007) to ‘complex television’ (Mittell 2015). In general, what makes the third golden age stand out is the series format, in which new distribution and production units, such as HBO and Netflix, played a leading role. Although the major networks were subject to the doctrine of producing ‘the least objectionable programming’ (NBC’s vice-president Paul Klein, cited in Thompson 1997, 39), the arena of the new producers was pay television. This allowed them to address niche audiences more directly, by focusing on boldness in language and visual design, and their diverse themes supported a level of uncensored sex and violence in a hitherto unprecedented way. Overall, whatever the precise dates in question, new modes of distribution (Cunningham and Silver 2013) that increased transnational production and extensive experiments with aesthetics and narrative forms make a strong argument for a third golden age in American television drama. To summarize, Caughie’s and Cooke’s analyses emphasize ‘the historical moment’ when meanings and values that used to be marketable are\n\n2 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DANISH PUBLIC SERVICE DRAMA SERIES\n\n33\n\nsuddenly replaced because of a need to reassess traditional approaches. For my purposes, ‘the historical moment’ implies a powerful, culture-leading role for television drama that reverberates throughout, and changes, the public sphere.\n\nTransnational Cultural Exchange and Danish Television Drama That everything has a beginning and an end is a rule inherent in the golden age mythological trope Approaching the issue of the relationship between centre and periphery, or between national and transnational cultures, offers an interesting perspective. Jurij M. Lotman draws a fundamental distinction between ‘autocommunicative’ and ‘message-oriented’ cultures. Autocommunicative cultures are primarily oriented towards their own culture, whereas message-oriented ones display more curiosity and an interest in receiving messages from others. A culture may shift from one to the other over time. Such shifts are associated with intense value struggles, as is the case with any moment of significant historical change. Lotman’s model of exchange between cultures ‘orientated towards autocommunication’ (usually situated on the peripheries) and those ‘orientated towards the message’ (usually situated at the centres) represents a way of elucidating what it means to negotiate cultural relationships and appropriate another culture’s texts. Lotman conceptualizes the relationship between centre and periphery, and hence the processes of cultural export and import, as having five phases (Lotman 1990, 144–145). In the first phase, the foreign texts, distributed in their original language, are perceived as strange and elitist. In the second phase, by means of translations, imitations and edits (‘adaptations’, Lotman 1990, 146), the texts are restructured, gradually influencing the texts of the domestic culture. In the third phase, this appropriation is so extensive that the foreign texts seem quite homely; and in the fourth phase, the imported texts are completely dissolved into the recipient culture, which in turn starts to develop newly transformed and restructured texts. The fifth phase of this process causes the originally peripheral receiver culture to develop into a new transmission centre. This pattern is one of ongoing oscillation between periods of inertia, when saturation takes place, and periods of high activity.\n\n34\n\nG. AGGER\n\nIn the case of Danish television drama, the period against which the golden age is naturally measured is the period immediately preceding it (c. 1980 to the mid-1990s). During this period, the dominant DR production culture was ‘autocommunicative’ in the sense that it was primarily oriented towards its own culture. Exports were limited mainly to the other Nordic countries. As DR held a monopoly until 1988, the broadcaster could rely on an audience. Television 2 was designed politically to focus on news and entertainment programmes, therefore it took a while for any real competition to appear in the arena of television drama. Considered in terms of both quantity and quality, DR’s productions during this period provided a mixed bag of programmes. A variety of genres was included, to accommodate different tastes in different segments of the Danish population. As DR prepared for competition, it took some time before the traditional divide between serious and popular drama, between ‘art’ and ‘entertainment’, was breached. The in-house production culture in DR’s Drama division was not sufficiently encouraged to bridge this gap, and planning was hampered because of procedures that hindered swift decision-making and experimentation, which were hard to accommodate with the existing resources. The customary practice was to start on a fresh enterprise after six episodes (Agger 2005). The following period—the mid-1990s to 2016—witnessed the development of quite different Danish television drama, as a result of a transformation from a primarily domestically orientated production culture into a primarily transnational production culture. I would like to illustrate this transition with a rough outline that follows Lotman’s general pattern of five phases. • Innovation in Danish television drama is prompted by influences from abroad, primarily two television serials, Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective (BBC, 1986) and David Lynch’s Twin Peaks (Lynch/Frost Productions et al., 1990–1991). Both the international and the Danish reception of these productions stand out. They are intensely debated in the public sphere, and immediately become the focus of research (Bondebjerg 1993; Christensen and Kristiansen 1992). In the United Kingdom and United States, and in the other countries to which these serials are exported, they are regarded as strange, elitist, challenging, and highly innovative sources of inspiration. • The importing culture considers such products to invite new developments in locations, aesthetics, genres and themes, and they act as\n\n2 THE GOLDEN AGE OF DANISH PUBLIC SERVICE DRAMA SERIES\n\n35\n\ncatalysts for Lars von Trier’s television serial Riget/The Kingdom (DR1, 1994/1997) (Creeber 2002; Bainbridge 2007). The Kingdom depicts the much admired hospital ‘Rigshospitalet’ in Copenhagen with the use of distinctive aesthetic strategies. High angle photography and close interior shots are two perspectives that characterize these. The setting demonstrates seemingly peculiar, self-consciously aesthetic cinematography characterized by the hand-held camera, brownish colours, and leaps in time, and is distanced from the realism with which you would expect the nation’s top hospital to be depicted. Several genres are oddly mixed in this serial—medical soap opera, satire, melodrama, ghost stories set in the past, and horror mingle with a traditional, realistic depiction of everyday life. This production challenges the traditional institutional culture that is imposed from above with a scriptwriter/director/producer-oriented culture that is developed by the most creative minds in the kingdom. • The importing culture appropriates foreign fiction, starting the production of new serials and series. The Kingdom is followed by Ole Bornedal’s Charlot og Charlotte/Charlot and Charlotte (DR 1, 1996), which wins the Prix Italia for best European television serial. The lesson of this romantic comedy lies in its successful shift of perspectives—from the local perspective of Valby and Skagen, to the global perspective of New York, and back. Later, the long-running drama TAXA (DR1, 1997–1999), inspired by American narrative strategies (Nielsen 2016), dominates the scene. Subsequently, Rejseholdet/Unit One (DR1, 2000–2004) first conquers the domestic audience, then wins an Emmy, signalling wider international recognition. Simultaneously, Danish production culture begins exporting its appropriations, with intermediaries and audiences abroad beginning to take an interest in Nordic productions. Forbrydels"
