        "text": "All devices. I asked C4 and they told me that All4 delivers HD at 720p only.\n\nNot true any more. All4 now streams at 1080P on Apple TV devices. I just checked last week's ep of Grand Designs with the developer mode on and it confirms 1920 x 1080 as the native frame size.\n\nI've just checked the ITV Hub and it too now shows 1080P on live streams of some of the main channels. Catch up is limited to SD though still for most stuff. BritBox shows a lot of ITV stuff at 1080P already so the switch to ITVX should be smooth.\n\nBBC iPlayer is still stuck at 720P on Apple TV boxes, but the app does now stream 1080P on many devices along with the limited UHD content too.\n\nI can only report what C4 told me about All4. Perhaps All4 on ATV is the exception. I have no way to check resolution on either my LG or Panasonic TVs. I’ll ask them again, ITV too. Good news if the resolution has been bumped. As for iPlayer, 1080p seems limited to a handful of devices, and I thought that on ATV boxes, iPlayer can’t do 4K HLG.\n\nHow do you check the resolution on ATV boxes please? My big grumble on ATV boxes, and a showstopper for me, is the incomplete NowTV implementation with Boost. No 5.1 audio.\n\nI can only report what C4 told me about All4.

My big grumble on ATV boxes, and a showstopper for me, is the incomplete NowTV implementation with Boost. No 5.1 audio.\n\nYou turn on the developer mode on ATV boxes by following these instructions: How to Unlock Detailed Streaming Statistics on the Apple TV\n\n1080P is available on many iPlayer apps now, the BBC just haven’t updated their listings in a while. You are correct however in saying that the ATV app is limited to 720P with no 4K HLG.\n\nThe ATV NOW app does do 5.1 audio but only on live streams, on demand content is still limited to 2.0 stereo. It’s a pain as having tried the Sky Stream box, the NOW app on ATV is much smoother & more reliable.\n\n@BMox81 : I stream most stuff primarily on a LG 4K TV. There’s no way that I can find, other than on the Netflix app., as to what the current screen resolution is.\n\n@teeveedee : the Sky thing just doesn’t make sense. If live streams can be delivered in 5.1, why not the on demand stuff? What’s more galling is that the app. works as expected on Amazon kit, NowTV being a relatively recent addition to the platform. That said, the FireTV hardware does seem to offer the most comprehensive solution, with all bases pretty much covered.\n\nYes, I know about the thread. I've posted in it many times. Just like Sky to treat its customers with contempt. As much as I'd like an ATV box, the brain-dead Now TV and the crippled iPlayer apps. make it a non-starter for me. Annoying really, as I've bought in to the Apple ecosystem and the device would integrate nicely.\n\nI, like a lot of people, just want a one-box solution that caters for all of their needs. Sadly, such a beast doesn't currently appear to exist, Amazon hardware being the closest, but lacking the finesse and elegance of the Apple kit.\n\nYes, I know about the thread.

And is probably why you stick to your Smart TV apps.\n\nSo it’s whether you can live with the shortcomings of the ATV in the above two examples and I suspect most people do because of all the advantages that you get with the ATV when you’re in the ecosystem.\n\nThat's so pityful. My TV doesn't have freeview HD so I'm stuffed. Dunno why I pay my TV licence when they can't even output even at a meagre 720p on a browser in 2022.\n\nIf you want something for the TV maybe grab a Firestick HD ... not sure they if they do the Ultra HD but probably give you better than current and a load of other services as well.\n\nI've tried complaining to the BBC about their bizarrely random choice of which devices to bless with 4K streams. Apparently the \"Express Luck LE-43F2\" and the \"Shenzhen LT-43CA520\" are worthy, but anything with an Apple badge or anything running Windows is not.\n\nSadly the BBC cut and paste response is basically 4K is trial (a never-ending one apparently) so I should just keep checking their page for supported devices. They're useless.\n\nFortunately I watch so little BBC it's not a huge deal but it still irks. Why are they so needlessly obtuse? IPlayer is almost as expansive as Netflix, and that's in 4K DV on basically everything.\n\nI've tried complaining to the BBC about their bizarrely random choice of which devices to bless with 4K streams.

IPlayer is almost as expansive as Netflix, and that's in 4K DV on basically everything.\n\nVery little BBC content is shot & mastered in 4K. Only high end drama series & natural history docs. HD is still the standard delivery format for the majority of shows.\n\nNetflix commission pretty much all their original content in 4K HDR so that’s how they’re shot & delivered.\n\nMost new content uses Red Dragon, Arri and other high resolution camera equipment as old kit is upgraded. The main issue is the back end tech that for live content the image is captured in raw PQ which has to be transcoded to HDR10 (e.g. BT Sport), HLG (Sky/BBC iPlayer). Even the outlets that claim DV for live content where frame/scene grading is possible use an AI on the fly processing. With films the editor/colourist can manually grade for DV so the differences are going to be marginal.\n\nIf you want something for the TV maybe grab a Firestick HD ... not sure they if they do the Ultra HD but probably give you better than current and a load of other services as well.\n\nIt looks like they've upgraded the web browser iPlayer to 720p watching Argentina vs Australia. Definitely an improvement from 540p. Either the BBC are reading this forum or they've had a lot of complaints.\n\nAVForums 1-0 BBC\n\nIt looks like they've upgraded the web browser iPlayer to 720p watching Argentina vs Australia.

I watched the France match (on catchup - so rewound the live stream and it was stuck at 960x540 at 1700kbps which was dreadful. Even now their live bbc one stream is still the same. If I choose bbc two or four, its 1280x720 at 5166kbps so they are throttling bbc one for some reason.\n\nSeems they've downgraded today.
