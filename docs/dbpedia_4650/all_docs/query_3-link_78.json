        "text": "Virgin media have there virgin media channels in hd on there app on all platforms finally. It used to be the same as their broadcast on the saorview platform which is shocking on anything above a 24inch screen. It won't blow you away but i can at least see the score on the football now on my 75 in tv ðŸ¤£\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by app, but the Virgin Media channels (1,2&3) have been in HD on the Virgin Media Player for quite some time. And yes, if stuck with Saorview only, it's the only way to watch them in HD for free.\n\nFor those of us on Saorview, that's why we watch VM's rugby coverage on BBC or ITV.\n\nI can't understand why they don't broadcast in HD. They are losing a lot of viewers.\n\nThey are in hd on there own platform and sky subsidize it on there box to keep subscribers. 2rn the company behind saorview which is owned by rte who won the contract when it went to tender in 2010 wanted a couple of million for the extra bandwidth tv3 would be using and they refused to pay it.\n\nNobody, I think itâ€™s still SD there? I think the OP has confirmed their post referred to the channels being HD on the Virgin Media Player (which it has been for a good while).\n\nThe VM Player still doesnâ€™t have VM Four btw, or even acknowledge its existence."
