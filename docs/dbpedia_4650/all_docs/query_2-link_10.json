        "text": "Are you fed up not being able to watch BBC iPlayer from the USA? As fellow expats, we understand the frustration of being unable to access your favorite BBC shows while residing in the United States.\n\nThe key to unlocking BBC iPlayer from the USA lies in utilizing a Virtual Private Network (VPN). By harnessing the power of a VPN, you can enjoy BBC iPlayer’s extensive library for free, regardless of your geographical location. We will unveil the top VPN providers that excel in unblocking BBC iPlayer and walk you through the setup process, even if you’ve never used a VPN before.\n\nVPNs encrypt your traffic, preventing your activities from being monitored by hackers, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your employer, or the government.

ExpressVPN\n\nUnblocks BBC in USATested Aug 2024\n\nExpressVPN is a great all-round VPNs so it had to make this list, but it has been less reliable with BBC iPlayer lately. It has more than 3,000 servers in 94 countries worldwide, including the UK. This service can securely access streaming platforms that many other VPNs struggle with, including ITV Hub, and Netflix UK. Best of all, it’s fast enough to stream live HD content with no noticeable stuttering or buffering whatsoever.\n\nThis VPN service includes 256-bit secure encryption, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, perfect forward secrecy, and a kill switch (which halts all traffic whenever you disconnect unexpectedly), to keep your activities private at all times.

PrivateVPN\n\nUnblocks BBC in USATested Aug 2024\n\nPrivateVPN has around 150 servers in 60 countries (including the UK), but it makes up for its smaller network by providing faster speeds than many similar services. Additionally, PrivateVPN reliably works with not just the BBC iPlayer, but also Netflix UK, ITV Hub, and All 4.

Private Internet Access\n\nUnblocks BBC in USATested Aug 2024\n\nPrivate Internet Access operates a network spanning 80 countries including the UK. This makes it a viable choice for accessing geo-restricted content while traveling abroad. When you use it to stream BBC iPlayer (you can also access Netflix US), you’ll benefit from unlimited bandwidth and stable connections as a result. Another advantage of PIA is that it permits as many as 10 simultaneous connections per account.\n\nWith PIA, you can stream securely with 256-bit AES encryption and DNS leak protection. If you lose the VPN connection, a kill switch cuts your internet traffic and prevents your data from being exposed. There’s also ad and malware blocking and a no-logs policy. The lightweight apps are highly accessible even for beginners and should you have any trouble, 24/7 support is at hand.\n\nTo use Private Internet Access, download and install an app for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Linux, or Amazon Fire TV.

PureVPN\n\nUnblocks BBC in USATested Aug 2024\n\nPureVPN is a low-cost VPN based in the British Virgin Islands – a location that lacks invasive surveillance agencies and mandatory data retention directives that apply to VPNs. This makes it a highly secure provider with a fully audited no-logs policy you can trust to secure your privacy at all times.\n\nThe VPN has servers in 65+ countries, including the UK to watch BBC iPlayer abroad. It also works to watch Channel 4, ITVX, and Netflix UK and delivers super-fast speeds using its WireGuard protocol. In our tests, it also worked to watch US platforms like Netflix US, HBO Max, and Hulu, as well as international services in Germany, Japan, Canada, and France. This makes it an impressive all-rounder for the cost.\n\nDespite its affordability, PureVPN doesn’t compromise on security, offering robust features such as AES encryption, a kill switch, DNS leak prevention, and a strict no-logging policy.

At Comparitech, we use a data-based VPN testing methodology to review market-leading VPNs. This allows us to compare services directly to find the best VPNs for specific use cases, including watching iPlayer abroad.\n\nTo find the best VPNs for streaming the BBC in the US, we found services that are fast, reliable, and have the features listed below:\n\nReliably works with BBC iPlayer and similar streaming platforms. We look for VPNs that have solid British servers that work with iPlayer, All 4, ITV Hub, and other popular services such as internet banking.\n\nOffers consistently high-speed connections. Many VPNs run on outdated protocols and slow networks of cheap servers. We recommend fast VPNs that offer modern protocols, such as WireGuard.\n\nUses strong encryption and includes several other security features. We only recommend VPNs that have fully-featured apps with plenty of advanced privacy and security features. We also test for IP and DNS leaks and ensure the VPN has a kill switch.\n\nDoesn’t log any information that could identify you. We recommend VPNs with watertight privacy policies you can rely on to ensure your browsing habits always remain private.\n\nHas apps for all the most popular operating systems. We check the VPN, which has apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, to ensure you can stream iPlayer on all your devices.\n\nOffers good value for money. We only recommend VPNs for BBC in the USA that are fairly priced and give you plenty of bang for your buck. This includes discounts, free trials, and money-back guarantees. We also look at the number of simultaneous device connections supported when assessing value.\n\nHas reliable customer support. We hope you never have to contact customer support, but if you do, it should be a quick and pleasant experience. We test the customer service experience with each of our recommended VPNs and only recommend the very best. We expect to see live chat options with flexible open hours and give extra points if it’s 24 hours and available in a variety of different languages.\n\nCan I watch the BBC abroad with a free VPN?\n\nFree VPN services can be tempting, but we advise against using one for several reasons. The first is their performance; free VPNs rarely have enough servers to support all their users, which manifests as slow speeds. Streaming is pretty data-intensive, particularly at higher resolutions, and as such, you’ll likely experience choppy playback, subpar video quality, long buffering times and data limits. Further, the BBC regularly updates its geo-blocking measures so there’s a good chance you won’t be able to access BBC iPlayer at all with a free VPN service.\n\nThese services might be free to use, but they are businesses and as such, exist to make money. Most use an ad-supported model or offer perks like higher speeds for a monthly fee, but some resort to shadier practices. Some services store tracking cookies on your device to see which sites you visit, and sell the resulting consumer profile to advertisers. This takes control over who sees your data out of your hands, which is the exact opposite of what a VPN is supposed to do.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s difficult to even tell if you are using a safe VPN or not. Researchers recently tested 283 free VPN apps and found that almost 40% contained malware, 84% were vulnerable to IPv6 leaks, and 18% used no encryption whatsoever. Well-known services aren’t necessarily safer; in 2015, Hola was caught selling user bandwidth to help run a botnet.\n\nUsing a reputable VPN with a clear, customer-first privacy policy is the best way to stay safe online.\n\nCan I watch BBC News with a VPN?\n\nThe BBC provides two news services. Its global program, focused on international affairs, is available to users via bbc.com. However, if you want to access the UK’s version of the 24-hour BBC News channel, you must access bbc.co.uk or BBC iPlayer.\n\nYou will find that if you are outside the UK, you will be redirected to https://bbc.com.\n\nHowever, a VPN connected to a UK server allow you to access https://bbc.co.uk as well as BBC IPlayer. The news channel can be accessed directly via iPlayer, so you can keep up to date on the latest news and events in the UK.\n\nHow to sign up for BBC iPlayer\n\nCreating a new BBC account is easy and only takes a few minutes. Here’s how to do it:\n\nGo to the login page and click Register Now\n\nYou’ll be asked to enter details, including your date of birth, email address, and postal code.\n\nWhen you’re done, click Register and verify your email address.\n\nBritish law requires you to have a TV license to watch anything on the BBC iPlayer. While this service sometimes shows a popup making you aware of this, it doesn’t appear every time you try to watch something, and as such, is easy to forget. The iPlayer doesn’t check whether you have a TV license and relies entirely on an honor system.\n\nAlternatives to BBC iPlayer in the USA\n\nAlthough BBC iPlayer provides a vast collection of British television shows, other options are available for viewers in the USA who want to enjoy UK programming. Here are some alternatives that allow you to watch British TV from the comfort of your living room.\n\nBritBox: A collaboration between the BBC and ITV, BritBox is a British TV lover’s dream come true. From classic Doctor Who episodes to the latest EastEnders seasons, it’s a one-stop-shop for all things British. Plus, there’s no need to fret about legality; it’s all above board.\n\nITVX: Want more than just the BBC? ITV Hub offers a wide array of content from ITV’s channels. Whether you’re into dramas like Downton Abbey or reality shows like Love Island, ITV Hub has something for everyone.\n\nSky Go: Sky Go can be a viable option for those with access to a UK Sky subscription. It offers live and on-demand content from Sky’s channels, including sports, movies, and series like Chernobyl.\n\nAll 4: All 4’s content is supported by advertisements, which means you don’t need a TV license. You can watch popular shows like The Great British Bake Off and The Inbetweeners for free. It’s a fantastic opportunity to explore British TV without committing to a subscription.\n\nMy5: My5 is the streaming platform from Channel 5 where you can watch content from the main channel, and places like 5STAR, 5USA, and 5SELECT. Some of the biggest titles include Only Fools and Horses, The Inheritance, and Police Interceptors."
