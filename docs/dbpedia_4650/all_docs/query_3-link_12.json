        "text": "Virgin Media has pulled an advert in a multimillion-pound ad campaign featuring David Tennant after the BBC complained about references to Doctor Who.\n\nThe TV campaign features Tennant explaining the virtues of Virgin Media's TiVo personal video recorder and catch-up service.\n\nIn the ad Tennant uses the service to look up episodes of Doctor Who, while making a reference to how TiVo is good for watching sci-fi, and in the background Sir Richard Branson is seen using a time machine.\n\nBBC Worldwide lodged a complaint with Virgin Media that the ad campaign, which was launched during ITV1's Britain's Got Talent in March, appeared to be a commercial endorsement of the service, breaking the corporation's guidelines.\n\n\"Virgin Media has listened to concerns raised by BBC Worldwide about perceived commercial endorsement by a BBC brand relating to the recent Virgin Media advertisement that featured David Tennant and Richard Branson,\" the two companies said in a joint statement. \"As a gesture of goodwill Virgin Media has agreed to withdraw transmission of the advertisement and BBC Worldwide is now satisfied that the issue has been addressed.\"\n\nVirgin Media has created three TV ads with Tennant. The two others will continue to air.\n\nActor Marc Warren has previously appeared in the TiVo ads promoting the range of bundles of products, including superfast broadband, that Virgin Media offers.\n\nThe \"collections\" campaign was launched in January featuring Olympian Usain Bolt.\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.
