        "text": "Here's a guide explaining how you can watch TV shows found on BBC iPlayer from anywhere in Australia.\n\nNever miss out on watching your favourite BBC television series again by signing up to Beebs - a service aiming to guarantee access to the streaming service.\n\nSteps to Stream BBC iPlayer Live from Australia:\n\nStart using Chrome Browser\n\nInstall BritvPVN (formally Beebs)\n\nHead over to BBC iPlayer\n\nYour web-browser, having reloaded, will now be able to stream BBC iPlayer one you have registered with the BBC iPlayer (takes less than 30 seconds).\n\nWhy isn't BBC iPlayer available in Australia?\n\nThe BBC iPlayer is the UK's version of the ABC iView. Just as people in the UK cannot watch ABC iview, it is not usually possible to watch the BBC iPlayer from Australia.\n\nThe British video-on-demand services are all hugely popular in the UK, because not only do they host all the newest shows as their air TV, but they also have an extensive selection of classic British shows that people can stream. It sounds like the perfect online catch-up service. It's a shame that BBC iPlayer Australia isn't a thing.\n\nMethods to Access BBC iPlayer in Oz\n\nHelp is at hand because there are a few ways of watching the BBC iPlayer if you are living, working or just travelling in Australia. Though we cannot one hundred percent guarantee that all these options will work (except the fourth option), we hope you'll be streaming British television shows in no time.\n\nBritbox launched in Australia in November 2020, offering an extensive collection of British television shows with content from both the BBC and ITV. Subscribers also have the option of streaming exclusive content made just for Britbox, such as the re-launch of the classic British satirical comedy Spitting Image.\n\nOne criticism we do have of Britbox is that the programming on the service is lacking when it comes to newer content since these big shows are sold off to be distributed to the more popular platforms such as Netflix or Amazon.\n\nOption 2: Purchase a Premium VPN\n\nThere are a few ways to hide and switch your IP address so it looks as though you are situated within the UK. A VPN is a popular choice for those wishing to do just this. VPNs were originally used so staff in international companies could communicate in private from locations around the world to avoid spying from their competitors. These days they are mostly used to access certain geoblocked streams.\n\nSince a purpose built BBC VPN for Australians doesn't exist, you'll have to find a good quality VPN that can unlock the BBC iPlayer. This may mean that the BBC will detect the VPN regularly.\n\nOption 3: Find a Proxy Server\n\nIn terms of being able to change your IP address a proxy server is a tool that acts as a go-between for requests from clients (in this case, you) seeking resources from other servers (the BBC).\n\nNavigating a proxy server is definitely the most challenging option and requires the most tech knowledge. Your connection is less secure using a proxy server and free ones can include a lot of ads. There is also a cap on how much content you can watch, depending on which proxy you choose to use.\n\nOption 4: Sign Up to Beebs\n\nOnce you've downloaded the Beebs Chrome Extension, your device will have full access to site requests from all of the British streaming services. This means you have access to the entire online catalogue found on:\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nChannel 4 (All4)\n\nITV (ITVX)\n\nIt was also always so frustrating that BBC classics like EastEnders, Pointless and Match of the Day were never consistently (or ever) aired on any of the TV channels in Australia. Now, these shows and hundreds more will be there for you to stream live as they air in the UK. The same goes for streaming the BBC News live or sporting events.\n\nChrome extensions are tools that are added to your browser to enhance the user's experience. The most common are Adblock, Adblockplus and productivity tool. Here at Beebs we have a lightweight extension with a built-in proxy server which in one click will have anybody in Australia watching BBC iPlayer in an instant.\n\nFinal Words"
