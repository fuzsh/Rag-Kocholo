Windows would helpfully suggest that I \"use the web service to find the correct program\", but I don't think this ever worked. Today's faster connections mean files can be downloaded much more quickly, but it's still a pain when videos won't play or double-clicking an attachment does nothing other than make you worry you've just infected your PC. In this issue's cover feature (page 40), we explain how to ensure that anything you download can be opened on your PC, phone or tablet. This usually involves converting the stubborn file into a friendlier format, so we've chosen the best free tools for the job.

This gives you a much better view of famous landmarks, including the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge and the London Eye, than looking directly down on them from above or seeing them from street level. You also get a better idea of how church spires, skyscrapers such as The Shard and trees fit the London skyline (or not). To explore the 3D imagery, switch to Satellite mode, search for a famous London landmark or building and zoom in. Click the 'tilt the view' icon when it appears in the bottom-right to see the city as if you were in a helicopter. You can fly around structures, pan and zoom, and rotate the whole view. Surprisingly, London is actually the fifth UK city for which 3D imagery has been added to Google Maps. It's already available for Birmingham, Leeds, Reading and Stoke-on-Trent. maps.google.co.uk Watch Stephen Fry explain the Laws of Cricket bit.ly/cricket350 The Marylebone Cricket Cub, better known as Lord's, has launched a new set of animated videos to help young cricket players, novices and casual fans develop a greater understanding of the Laws of Cricket. Narrated by Stephen Fry, the latest batch of clips explains terms including 'the wicket is down' and 'batsman is out of his ground', as well as the rules of damaging the pitch and hitting the ball twice. The friendly videos make even the more technical aspects of cricket easy to understand, and are short enough (generally under two minutes) to avoid becoming tedious.

T Discuss web news at forum.webuser.co.uk 30 July 2014 7 Need to Know MPs push through emergency surveillance law What happened? British politicians have pushed through a new data-collection law, which allows government authorities to collect metadata about UK citizens in bulk. Back in April, similar regulations were deemed illegal by the European Court of Justice, which rejected the requirement for phone and internet companies to collect and store user data for a year, including information such as who you texted and emailed. That court ruling meant the UK needed a new law concerning the collection of such data. It took politicians three months to come up with a replacement, which was pushed through as \"emergency security legislation\" before Parliament closed for the summer. Titled the Data Retention and Investigation Powers Act - which gives it the rather amusing acronym DRIP - the new law took only a week from being announced to receiving Royal Assent. DRIP is similar to the previous law - a fact that has already prompted digital rights activists the Open Rights Group (ORG) to launch a legal suit against the government, noting that if the first version was illegal, surely the near- identical successor is, too. \"Blanket data retention is unlawful and we will fight against this legislation,\" ORG'S executive director Jim Killock said. \"Our message to Theresa May is: see you in court.\" The new law does offer a few minor protections for citizens, such as a built-in \"sunset clause\", which means it must be passed again before the end of 2016. DRIP also requires the government to OPtN RI0MT5 ORWJP No Emergency! .

Group foists to prntm and promote your rights in the digital age. We are funded by over 2/00 people lite you. issue transparency reports about how the data it collects is used, and limits which government bodies can request the data. Whether that will be enough to assuage the concerns of the European courts remains to be seen. The move follows a report from the UN, which warned that too many governments are passing electronic surveillance programmes that are \"neither necessary nor proportionate\", while showing no concern for privacy or transparency. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, said mass surveillance of people was becoming a \"dangerous habit\" for governments. How will it affect you? Very little will change for most of us because telecoms firms were already collecting such data, whether we knew it or not. DRIP's most notable addition is that it extends the collection to webmail services, although it's more surprising that this data wasn't already being collected. What's so frustrating about DRIP is there's not much any of us can do about its invasion of our privacy. Tech firms are forced by law to obey, so in this case there's little to be done by pressuring them not to hand over or collect data. If you don't like the sound of DRIP - or how it was hurried through Parliament - it's worth looking at the Open Rights Group's website (www.openrightsgroup .org). ORG will be leading the charge to court against DRIP, and is currently raising funds to cover its costs. What do we think? We think The UN is right to raise concerns about the amount of surveillance we suffer from in the UK, and it's frustrating that there's little we can do about it. Indeed, the government didn't even allow a proper debate in the House of Commons, let alone ask citizens for their thoughts, and many of us are likely to have opinions on the issue, especiallly after the Snowden revelations highlighted the extent of the US government's spying on people. It is astonishing and shameful that the government would use emergency legislation rules to force this law through. If it's so important to have such regulations in place, they should have been discussed openly from April, when they were deemed illegal. It would seem the British government doesn't feel it answers to the highest court in Europe, let alone its own people. 8 30 June 2014 Need to Know Top news stories and rumours, and how they affect you Amazon launches 'Spotify for ebooks' What happened? Amazon is now offering its US customers unlimited access to a library of more than 600,000 ebooks, for a subscription fee of $10 (£5.86) per month. This brings to reading the same streaming model popularised by Spotify for music and Netflix for television. Kindle Unlimited includes a host of popular titles - from the Hunger Games series to Harry Potter - but Amazon hasn't yet signed all major publishers, which limits its catalogue somewhat. Kindle Unlimited also includes more than 2,000 audiobooks from Amazon's Audible service (www .audible.com). How will it affect you? Annoyingly, Kindle Unlimited isn't yet available in the UK and Amazon told us we'll have to wait and see if and when the service launches over here. Most Amazon products and services are first made available in the US and arrive on these shores within months, but the company will need to see how successful Kindle Unlimited is in the States before it decides whether to expand it or not. You won't need a Kindle e-reader to access the Kindle Unlimited service, because you can use the free Kindle apps on your phone or tablet. What do we think? Avid readers will love this as much as film and TV buffs love Netflix, because buying just one new novel can cost the price of an entire month's subscription. However, Amazon must ensure that current bestsellers are available on Kindle Unlimited, or the service will seem less appealing. Simply put, most people watch TV and listen to music much more than they read books. If Kindle Unlimited were a cut-price add-on to its Prime subscription, it might make more sense. It's also worth noting that most libraries now offer ebooks for free. They generally use the EPUB format, which is supported by most e-readers except the Kindle, and there are plenty of free reading apps you can use on your mobile device. As with Kindle Unlimited, the choice of books on offer at libraries in digital formats remains limited, but it's still worth checking your local branch to see what's on offer.

Voted Website 'Of The Month B| Web User vtogaane For August 2014 ww.quickmobilefix.com BBC iPlayer down for entire weekend What happened? Technical difficulties rendered BBC iPlayer and the BBC homepage unavailable for the weekend of 19-20 July. The Beeb first confirmed that problems were plaguing parts of its website in a Twitter post at midday on the Saturday. On Sunday morning, it admitted that BBC iPlayer was \"not working for all users\", on both the web and mobile devices, and the BBC homepage was still missing on Monday. How will it affect you? If you were hoping to catch up with your favourite BBC programmes on iPlayer that weekend, you obviously would have been left frustrated. The BBC homepage was less of a loss, especially because visitors were still able to access popular sections such as News, Food and Weather. What do we think? It's very rare for iPlayer to go down, but the fact it did so during the hottest weekend of the year, rather than on a cold winter evening, was to the Beeb's advantage. At the time of going to press, the reason for the outage had yet to be confirmed, so we hope it doesn't become a regular occurrence. \"^Discuss web news at forum.webuser.co.uk 30 July 2014 9 Need to Know Microsoft cuts jobs and kills off Android phones What happened? Microsoft slashed 18,000 jobs - mostly from Nokia, which it bought in April for £4.5 billion - and scrapped its line of Nokia handsets that run a version of Android tweaked to look like Windows Phone. Nokia and Microsoft signed a deal in 2011 that all the Finnish manufacturers' handsets would run Windows Phone, despite the growing popularity of Android. However, earlier this year, Nokia unveiled the Nokia X range of smartphones running Android, which was aimed at emerging markets. The Nokia X was designed to resemble Nokia's Windows Phone handsets, and was intended to get users accustomed to Microsoft's mobile operating system. While a Nokia-designed phone running Android had broad appeal, Microsoft confirmed that it was killing off the line less than half a year after it was introduced, and will now only sell handsets that run Windows Phone. How will it affect you? If you had your eye on a Nokia X, you're out of luck, although you might still be able to buy one on eBay before they disappear forever. Nokia is famous for making attractive and well-designed devices that don't simply ape Apple's iPhone, but if you want a brightly coloured Nokia, you'll now have to settle New NokiaX Family^ n m NokiaX* NokiaX L for using Windows Phone. That's not as big a problem as it used to be: the recent updates have certainly improved the OS. and it's even due to get its own voice assistant, Cortana, later this year. However, while there are more developers creating apps for Windows Phone, it still has far fewer than iOS and Android. What do we think? We admit we were surprised when Nokia announced in February that it was releasing an Android handset - but also a little excited, too. Nokia makes wonderful phones, with bright colours, smart designs and excellent cameras, but they're held back by a merely serviceable and unappealing Microsoft operating system. We wish that Nokia had turned to Google in 2011 rather than Microsoft. Imagine what amazing devices could have been created if Google had bought Nokia instead of Motorola. Alas, it seems that our dream handset of a yellow Lumia running Android is not to be. <5> FIRST LOOK Raspberry Pi B+ www.raspberrypi.org Named the 'final evolution of the original Raspberry Pi' by its developers, the B+ includes several refinements over its predecessor. First and foremost, it uses less power, despite retaining the same 700MHz Broadcom processor and 512MB of RAM, which is good news if you plan to power the device using a battery. The size of the Pi has remained largely unchanged. Roughly as small as a credit card, it now offers four USB ports instead of the two included on the B model. These additional ports mean you can transfer files to your Pi using a flash drive or external hard drive, without needing to unplug your mouse or keyboard. However, you'll need an external drive with a power supply, because we found the Pi's ports weren't powerful enough to operate any of our 2.5in portable drives during our test. Even plugging in a flash drive knocked out the mouse when we used a smartphone's 850mA power supply to power the Pi, although this was quickly resolved by unplugging the mouse and plugging it in again. Alternatively, you can use a more powerful 2A power supply. The Raspberry Pi B's SD slot has been replaced with a MicroSD slot in the B+, and because the pocket- sized computer has an HDMI port, the composite video port has been merged with a 3.5mm headphone port to save space. It also comes with improved audio. The device's GPIO (general- purpose input/output) header has also been expanded to 40 pins, while keeping the same pinout for the first 26 pins as the previous model. At £27, the Raspberry Pi B+ costs the same as its predecessor, despite its many improvements. It's excellent value for the computer hobbyist, and we'll show you how to set it up in next issue's Weekend Project. 10 30 July 2014 Need to Know WHAT'S THE RUMOUR Will Google release the Nexus 6 in October? We've always been fans of Google's Nexus range of smartphones, which run 'pure' Android, offer excellent specifications and are extremely well-priced. However, we're already more than halfway through the year and details of the Nexus 6, the next phone in the range, have yet to be confirmed. Indeed, there's speculation that there won't be a Nexus 6 at all, with Google's Android Silver programme set to supersede it. Rather than designing and making a handset with one manufacturer, Android Silver involves Google collaborating with multiple handset manufacturers to design Android phones. But we're not convinced that Google is ready to ditch its popular Nexus line just yet. Historically, each version of the phone launches a new incarnation of Android; and we know that Android L (possibly Android 5) is due out in the autumn. Following the previous pattern of release, this means we should see the Nexus 6 in October or November. We can also assume that LG is making the new handset, as it did the Nexus 4 and 5 (pictured), and that the Nexus 6 will be based on the LG G3. That should mean it has a 5.5in, 2,560 x 1,440 pixel screen and 3GB of RAM, although we expect it to have a lower-spec camera than the LG G3 to keep the price down. There's even talk of the Nexus 6 having a fingerprint scanner, which would put it in line with the iPhone 5S and Samsung Galaxy S5. ::: •■• :i: ::: ::: ••• ::: ::: ■•■ ii: ::: ::: ::: '$ ::: ::: ::: LIKELIHOOD RATING ///// We won't be surprised if Google suddenly announces the availability of the Nexus 6 in October, just as it did with the Nexus 4 and 5.

K What's new on Kickstarter Our favourite new project on the crowd-funding site SpaceSelfie bit.ly/space350 I From £15 This intriguing project promises to capture \"the ultimate selfie of yourself, shot by hand from the edge of space\". It will use a high-altitude balloon, skimming the edge of the Earth's atmosphere at 130,000 feet, to photograph selfies submitted by backers against the stunning backdrop of space. However, the team behind SpaceSelfie admits that it hasn't actually obtained clearance to launch the balloon from the UK, so it might have to use another country.

I What's been bothering us this fortnight Shylock banking malware taken down Security agencies led by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) have knocked out the infrastructure of a banking malware that infected at least 30,000 computers, according to security company Sophos. The malware is called Shylock, because its code contains quotes from the character in Shakespeare's Merchant Of Venice, although it's also known as Caphaw. It uses some of the same techniques as the infamous Trojan Zeus to steal banking details. The takedown involved the NCA, FBI and agencies in six other countries seizing control of Shylock's command-and-control servers, and taking over the domains used by Shylock to connect infected computers. bit.ly/shylock350 Facebook scammers exploit MH17 tragedy Facebook has removed several pages that used the names and photos of passengers on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine.

If you receive the email, you're advised to report it via the Action Fraud website (actionfraud.police.uk), which also includes an example of the message. bit.ly/linked350 Security Helpdesk I Your questions answered by security specialists THIS ISSUE'S EXPERT: Simon Edwards of Dennis Technology Labs (www.dennis technologylabs.com) □ei\\Ni TECHNOLOGY Q-fc Is the term 'anti- virus software 1 T mm ^ now obsolete, because actual viruses are relatively scarce? Fiona Michaels, Facebook A Security software companies have used the term 'anti-virus' for years to describe their products, though viruses are the least of our problems today. Of more concern are infected websites that download threats to our computers automatically, sometimes locking them until a ransom is paid or secretly stealing data and using the computer to commit electronic crimes. The 'anti-virus' label is still there because customers are used to it. Security experts will talk about 'anti-malware' when discussing such products, because this term covers a wider range of threats. Some well-known firms are slowly rebranding and we may see the demise of 'anti-virus' sooner rather than later. Q— | Will Microsoft extend support for Windows 7, in light of its popularity? Trevor Charles, Twitter A There are two types of support. 'Mainstream' support provides security updates, fixes for non-security issues, changes to the design of the product and the availability of paid support. 'Extended ' support, which kicks in once the mainstream support period elapses, provides security updates and paid-for support only. Windows 7 has another six months of mainstream support, but you should continue to receive security updates until 2020. By that time, Windows 9 or its successor will probably dominate and Windows 7 will be in a similar situation as Windows XP is today, having been around for more than a decade. In 2007, when Windows XP was vastly more popular than its successor Windows Vista, Microsoft extended support for Windows XP by an extra three years, so there is a precedent here. It is quite likely that the company could add another three years to Windows 7's life, taking it to 2023. 12 30 July 2014 Email us your security questions at webuser@dennis.co.uk TP-LINK* The Reliable Choice Do More, Faster 3 times faster than wireless N speeds.

Colin, Web User Forums QAs long as your name and contact details were correct when registering the domain, then yes, the domain name is yours for as long as you wish to renew it. However, once a domain name expires, it ceases to belong to you. Look up the WHOIS info to check the details and expiry date.

Andy Shaw sees how it compares Samsung's latest Android tablet comes in 10.5 and 8.4in models. We've tested the smaller 8.4in unit, which looks like it's been specifically designed to draw potential iPad Mini purchasers away from Apple's popular tablet. This is Samsung's smallest and lightest tablet to date, just 6.6mm thick and weighing 294g. It's thinner and lighter than Apple's 7.5mm and 331g iPad Mini, despite having a larger screen - 8.4in across the diagonal compared to the Mini's 7.9in. It has a soft-feeling polycarbonate back that's comfortable to hold but rigid enough to stop it from flexing, so it feels reassuringly strong. If you want to protect it with a Samsung cover, there's a good range to choose from, including one that doubles as a keyboard. High-resolution screen The Tab S's screen is the device's outstanding feature. It has a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 pixels, which works out to 356ppi (pixels per inch). That beats both Apple's Retina screen (326ppi, 2,048 x 1,536 pixels) on the Mini and Google's Nexus 7, which is 323ppi. Such a high pixel density means it's difficult to spot individual pixels, even when you hold the screen up close, and it makes the screen look brilliant. The screen uses Super AMOLED technology, and produces rich and vibrant colour, with excellent contrast and saturation. It also adjusts to its environment automatically, using a colour light sensor on the front of the tablet that can adapt the colour, saturation and sharpness, not just the brightness as most other self-adjusting tablets do. However, this only works with certain apps. Hardware features There are separate menu buttons on the bezel, so you don't waste any precious high-resolution screen space. However, the 'back' and 'multitasking' buttons are the opposite way round to standard Android settings, which is normal for Samsung devices but might confuse you if you're used to a device from another manufacturer. The front-facing 2-megapixel webcam is good enough for impromptu selfies and is great for using with Skype. On the back is an 8-megapixel camera, complete with an LED flash, which isn't a common sight on tablet cameras. It has image stabilisation for both video and still images, which 20 30 July 2014 Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 Product Test — \\ 1740 Mor, 7 July Omen ««!*■ Mimcil.

There are also modes for HDR, Panorama, Burst Modes and Dual Camera, which lets you use both cameras at the same time. Overall, it's captured images were sharp with good saturation. Inside the tablet is Samsung's own eight-core Exynos 5 system-on-chip (SoC) processor, first seen on the latest Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. It's technically a quad-core ARM 1.9GHz Cortex-A15 paired with a quad-core 1.3GHz Cortex-A7, which is used to run less processor-hungry apps, because it doesn't require as much power. There's also a 4G version of the tablet available which uses a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor running at 2.3GHz. Both models have 3GB of memory reserved for running applications. We reviewed the Exynos 5 model and, in our SunSpider JavaScript benchmark (bit.ly/ sunspi350), it managed a score of 1,014ms, which is very fast. We used 3DMark's Ice Storm (bit.ly/3dmark350) to test the tablet's gaming abilities and it recorded a score of 9,012 in Ice Storm Extreme and 13,648 in Ice Storm Unlimited. That means it can run any game currently available for Android, without juddering or skipping frames. In our constant-playback video test, the tablet lasted for 10 hours and 55 minutes, which is around the same duration as the iPad Mini. Interface and OS The Tab S runs Android 4.4 KitKat but, as usual, Samsung has applied its own tweaks to the operating system. For example, Multi Window mode lets you use two apps at the same time, which is useful if you want a browser open while you're doing something else and stops you from having to switch between apps. Meanwhile, Kids Mode lets you set up a safe area for children; you can set parental controls and it has a customised, child-friendly interface. Around the outside of the tablet, there's the usual headphone jack, micro USB charging port, power button and volume rocker. However, there's also an infrared blaster, so you can use the tablet as a universal remote control. The tablet has a MicroSD slot that accepts cards up to 128GB, so you can significantly boost the built-in storage (which is available in either 16GB or 32GB options). It also has stereo speakers positioned so you shouldn't end up muffling them, no matter which way round you hold the device. They sound reasonable but you'll probably still want to use headphones OUR VERDICT The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is a terrific tablet with an amazing screen that beats both the iPad Mini and Google's Nexus 7. It's thin, light, has good battery life and can run anything currently available on the Android if you're watching films or listening to music. A fingerprint scanner has been incorporated into the Home button, to provide a more secure and less fiddly way to unlock your device than PIN codes or patterns. You can also use it to log into your Samsung account and pay for PayPal purchases. You can register up to three fingerprints per user and we found that it worked consistently well. The tablet comes in a luxurious white with gold trim, which is more understated than it sounds, but if you're still not convinced, it's also available in Titanium Bronze (basically, dark grey). store. At £319, its price is similar to that of the iPad Mini, though the Nexus 7 is considerably cheaper. However, we expect to see some retailers offering discounts.

You can choose to be sent alerts if movement is detected and you can also PRODUCT INFO HomeMonitor HD Pro www.homemonitor.me Price: £183.52 Buy from www.amazon.co.uk SPECIFICATIONS ■l-megapixePAinCMOS lens ■ Infrared range up to 10m in zero light ■Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n ■ H.264 video compression ■ IP66-rated weatherproofing ■ 125 x 57 x 57 mm -410g ■ One-year warranty FOR / Designed to operate outdoors / Saves footage to the cloud / No further charges for standard service /Harder to install than indoor cameras /Expensive log into the 1 website or app (Android and iOS) to get a live view. This latest addition to the camera family is a weather- proof outdoor model. The camera is encased in sturdy metal armour and comes with a wall bracket, which hides the cabling away inside. You could have the power cable trailing out of notches on the side of the wall mounting or, if you prefer, you can drill a hole in Once installed, getting the camera up and running is as simple as ever J J your wall behind the bracket and pass the cables through from inside your house. Either way, there are still wires exposed between the wall mount and the camera. The HD Pro has an Ethernet connection, which you only need to use while setting up the camera, though you can use it for its permanent network connection if you wish. Otherwise, there's a large router-style aerial on the top, which was perfectly capable of picking up our Wi-Fi signal, even from outside the house. Physical installation is certainly trickier than with the previous indoor cameras (which simply sit on their bases on any convenient surface), and will involve some drilling, even if it's just the holes you'll need to screw it into the wall. Once this is done, however, getting the camera up and running is as simple as ever. All the configuration is done through the website. You register a camera with the number printed on a tag attached to the cable, choose your Wi-Fi network, type in its password and you're away. You can configure alerts and set up which parts of the screen should be motion- sensitive. While this camera is expensive, you don't have to pay extra to host the video online unless you want to increase the amount of time videos are stored from seven days to 30 days. Seven days storage should be sufficient - if you need to keep things longer, you can also download videos from the site. OUR VERDICT Previous HomeMonitor cameras have won Gold Awards in our Group Tests and this outdoor model works just as well. It's harder to set up because you'll need to draw on your DIY skills to attach it to a wall, and there's the question of what to do with FEATURES PERFORMANCE EASE OF USE ***** VALUE FOR MONEY ***** the power cable. However, the seven days online recording and the service's website remain excellent. 22 30 July 2014 Web User's Best Buys Web User and its sister titles test over 2,500 products every year HARDWARE MONITOR BenQ EW2740L £194 from www.ebuyer.com Date tested: July 2014 The BenQ EW2740L is an excellent- value 27in monitor with good image quality.

It's essentially a free, cut- down version of StudioLine Photo Classic, and though it lacks some of the more advanced features found in the paid-for edition, it still provides plenty to satisfy most users. When you launch the software, a hint screen will display a list of available actions, including adding photos to the StudioLine image archive; editing pictures; viewing images as a slideshow; creating a web gallery (and publishing it online); and sending selected images via email. You can either choose one of these options or close the window to use the program however you wish. Images can be easily reordered by dragging and dropping, and you can sort them into folders within the software to keep things tidy. Click a photo and you'll be provided with various basic tweaks under the Edit tab, such as applying auto-tone and auto- contrast corrections, and adjusting highlights, midtones and shadows using sliders. The Describe tab lets you edit and add information to your image, including a name, description, copyright details, location and camera info. As well as a thumbnail view, images can be displayed on a map showing where they were taken. The program also offers a selection of useful correction tools and effects, including crop and rotate, red-eye removal, exposure correction, colour tuning, sepia, smoked glass and emboss. These are easy to use and produce excellent results. Although StudioLine Photo Basic is entirely free, you need to request an activation code so you can continue using it after the initial 30-day trial period. Considering that the paid-for version of the program costs $70 (£41), this seems like a fair trade-off.

A new Chrome (and Opera) extension called uBIock (bit.ly/ublock350) provides a more lightweight alternative that blocks all online ads while using minimal system resources - less than the memory consumed by Adblock Plus. It uses many of the same filter lists to determine which content to block on web pages, including EasyList, and lets you enable and disable them through its Options panel. You can also see the number of elements blocked on a page by clicking uBIock's toolbar button. It's very easy to use. and can be turned on and off with a single click, although it doesn't offer the option to allow 'acceptable ads' that you find in Adblock Plus. Note, too, that the more filters you select, the more memory uBIock will use, so it's wise to deselect any that you don't need. plilock vo 44 518 networK filters from * Voir filters 0 used out of 0 < mBIock niters 5 used out of 5 * long-toedmahraredomams (mawaredomams coir.) 2 350 used out of 2 360 < Maware domains (rra'wtaredona-ns com) 16 645 used out of 19 540 ■* Peter Lowe s Ad server ust ftovo org) 2 A&9 used out of 2 469 + Ma*aie Domain List (matworedoma-'utst com) i 342 used out of 1 342 nprtosts s Ad and tracking servers (ftosts-titc nefj 0 used out of?

You can prevent this from happening by installing Block Sender (www blocksenderapp.com), which lets you permanently block emails from specific senders and domains. You can also block messages that contain a particular word or phrase, and optionally send a fake bounced message that says: \"Delivery to the recipient failed permanently\". Block Sender lets you block 10 senders per month for free. If you need to block more, you can pay $4.99 (£2.91) per month or $29.99 (£17.50) per year for unlimited blocks.

It's a simple but useful idea, and you can turn the notifications off when you're browsing. Block annoying videos on YouTube Whenever you visit YouTube, the homepage recommends channels that you might like, based on videos you've watched previously and what's popular on the site at the moment.

Simply right-click a video and choose 'Block videos from this channel' or right-click the extension's icon in your address bar, choose Options and type the name of the channel to block. If you change your mind later, you can easily unblock channels by removing them from the list. The add-on is also available for Firefox. Manipulate your mood on Facebook A new extension called FB Mood Manipulator (bit.ly/mood350) claims to replicate Facebook's controversial experiment to influence the emotions of its users, which we reported last issue. Use the slider bars to set how you want to feel, whether positive, emotional or aggressive, and the add-on will adjust your news feed accordingly to give precedence to posts that match your desired mood. That's the theory, at least, although we found the results to be variable!

A new Firefox add-on called Download Plan (bit.ly/plan350) solves the problem by letting you schedule downloads for a less congested time. To use the add-on, right-click a download link on a web page and choose 'Add to plan', then repeat this for as many files as you want to download. Click the cog icon to open the Options panel and set start and end times for your plan, during which the files will be downloaded - Download Plan will look after the rest. It's very easy to use and saves you having to stay up late waiting for quiter periods, although you'll need to leave your browser open and your PC switched on. Download Plan X X X • x Sw. tn now Pen-e<« ait Get instant access to hidden Firefox tools Firefox now gives you access to various features and settings via a menu that opens when you click the Chrome-style 'hot dog' button in the top-right corner. You can customise this to include only the tools you use most often, but a better idea is to install All the Tools (bit .Iy/tools350). This places a More Tools button in the menu, which provides access to all available options with a single click. It's a useful shortcut to features that you only occasionally use. p o Find Options Add-ons ■ •■ • •• Developer More Tools O Sign in to Sync Q Customize 8 0 exactly the same way: when you have a lot of tabs open, click the OneTab icon on your toolbar to reduce them to a list on a single tab, thereby freeing up system resources. You can then reopen the pages individually or restore them all in one go; save your tabs as a group; and share them as a web page. Remove unwanted elements from pages Hack the web to make it look the way you want by using the scary sounding add-on Kill Button (bit.ly/kill350). It places two buttons on your toolbar, Kill and Multi-Kill, which you can use to remove unwanted elements from web pages by hovering your mouse over them and clicking. Multi-Kill allows you to delete several items at once, although you can't permanently damage the page and if you refresh it, all the elements will be restored. WebUser Reduce tab clutter and memory usage We've long been fans of the Chrome extension OneTab (www.one-tab.com), which stops your browser using too much memory, and now it's available for Firefox, too.

Go to Start, type regedit and press Enter. When the Registry Editor opens, navigate to: H KE Y_LOCAL_M ACH I N E\\ SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\ Windows\\CurrentVersion\\ Policies and select the key named Ext (if it doesn't exist, right-click Policies, choose New, Key and call the key Ext). In the right- hand pane, right-click and choose New, DWORD Value and name it DisableAddonLoadTime PerformanceNotifications. Double-click it and set its value to 1. Now, when you launch IE, the message will no longer appear. If that's too complicated, there's an easier way. When you're next prompted to disable add-ons, click the 'Choose add-ons' button and select '10 seconds' in the 'Tell me when the delay caused by add-ons exceeds' menu. Click Done and the message should stop bothering you. OView the weather on Speed Dial We've seen plenty of weather add-ons for Opera but the new Weather Speed Dial (bit.ly/weather350) is one of the most impressive. It places a tile on your Speed Dial page that shows you the current weather conditions and tells you the temperature forecast for the evening, during the night and the following morning. The add-on detects your location automatically and, unlike many weather extensions, uses Celsius rather than Fahrenheit. Click the tile to visit Clime. co (clime. co) for a more detailed forecast. ^Tell us your favourite add-ons at www.facebook.com/webusermagazine 30 July 2014 31 19 Best Free Apps App of the Fortnight TOOL Commandr for Google Now bit.ly/commandr350 Min requirements: Android 4.1 Size: 2.1MB NEW Commandr for Google Now is the Android equivalent of the iPhone's Siri, which lets you control your phone using only your voice.

If you're nowhere near a store, you can simply buy products online, and there's even an option to collect them in-store at your convenience. NEW PHOTOGRAPHY GoCam! bit.ly/gocam350 Mln requirements: iOS 7 Size: 67.1MB GoCam saves you the hassle of setting fiddly self-timers by letting you take pictures using simple gestures. To start the timer, you hold a flat palm towards the camera lens, make a fist showing as many fingers as you want the countdown to last for (so five fingers for five seconds) and then open your hand again. We really liked the innovative nature of this app, but in practice we found that it struggled to recognise our gestures from anything more than about a metre away. Fortunately, the five- second limit is enough time to set the timer and still get everyone in the family photo! Once you you're happy with B3BlB the result, you can edit your picture in the app and share it via Facebook, Twitter and email.
