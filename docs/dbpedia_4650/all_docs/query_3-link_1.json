        "text": "The scent of regeneration in the air on Doctor Who. Jodie Whittaker’s time as the 13th incarnation of The Doctor (yes, yes, we know that numbering system is all a bit messed up now after some major shocks) is almost up, as we reach the second of two final specials that will see her bowing out of the TARDIS to be replaced by… who?\n\nAs we write, that is still uncertain. But one thing we do know is that this latest Easter special features a returning foe that has so far evaded the Time Lord since the show’s reappearance back in 2005. They are the sinister aquatic beasts, the Sea Devils; amphibious Earth reptiles that were first seen in the 9th series of the iconic sci-fi show in 1972.\n\nIn the swashbuckling special, The Doctor (Whittaker), Dan (John Bishop) and Yaz (Mandip Gill) face off against the Sea Devils and pirate queen Madame Ching (Crystal Yu). When Madame Ching – a real-life 19th-century pirate leader – goes in search of the lost treasure of legendary ship the Flor de la Mar, she inadvertently unleashes a monstrous alien force.\n\nLike many classic Who monsters, the Sea Devils have been given a modern makeover and have been described by the show’s boss Chris Chibnall as a “terrifying evil”. But what are the scariest monsters in Nu Who history? We check them out…\n\nFirst appearance in the new series: The Impossible Astronaut, series 6 (2011)\n\nThe most alien-looking monster we’ve seen in the new era, they were forgettable – in the sense the second you turned your head, you’d forget about your encounter with them. Long fingers, creepy suits and bloodcurdling screams added to their overall dread.\n\nFirst appearance in the new series: The Empty Child, series 1 (2005)\n\nMixing the terror and unstoppable nature of a zombie, but in the body of a child. Give that kid a gas mask and a haunting catchphrase – “Are you my mummy?” – and the ability to make lights flicker, telephone ring and hearts thump, we’re out the door running.\n\nFirst appearance in the new series: The Waters Of Mars, autumn special (2009)\n\nIf you want a monster that epitomises how creative Doctor Who can be: they made water scary! A viral lifeform that infects other beings through close contact (gulp!), with their cracked skin and fast running (SO FAST!), even David Tennant could barely stop them.\n\nFirst appearance in the new series: Utopia, series 3 (2007)\n\nThe Doctor’s ultimate frenemy. Another Time Lord from Gallifrey, the pair have fought each other across all of time and space, but have occasionally teamed up. As Missy, the renegade Time Lord even tried to give being good a bash. It did not go well or last long.\n\nFirst appearance in the new series: Silence In The Library, series 4 (2008)\n\nLiterally meaning “the shadows that melt the flesh”, these are carnivorous swarms of microscopic beings The Doctor described as piranhas of the air. They can strip a creature down to bone in seconds. Oh great, we all thought, now we’re scared of our own shadows."
