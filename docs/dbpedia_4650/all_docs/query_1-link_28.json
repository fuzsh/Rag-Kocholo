        "text": "Episodes from across the entire 60 years of Doctor Who are streaming now on BBC iPlayer.\n\nMore than 800 episodes of the show are now available â from the first black-and-white encounter with the Daleks that had a generation hiding behind the sofa to the latest episodes.\n\nOur new Doctor Ncuti Gatwa and his new companion Ruby Sunday (played by Millie Gibson) are embarking on their first adventures as a TARDIS team. And so what better time to begin your own journey through the time and space of 60 years of Doctor Who?\n\nBut with so many episodes to choose from, it can be tricky to know where to start.\n\nTo help you navigate what Guinness World Records has named the longest-running science fiction series in the world, take the quiz below to find your perfect starting point.\n\nGood luck as you step inside the TARDIS...\n\nAs fits a character who can travel through time and space, there is a huge variety of stories to choose from: iconic villains like the Cybermen and The Master; planets from across the universe and beyond; adventures from the forming of the Earth to the day it gets engulfed by the Sun.\n\nThese episodes are not the only treats awaiting Whovians (and Whovians in waiting) on the BBC website and BBC iPlayer. Viewers can also enjoy spin-offs Torchwood, The Sarah Jane Adventures and Class as well as a wealth of never-before-seen archive material that tells the fascinating story of the making of Doctor Who.\n\nDoctor Who - and Doctor Who: Unleashed - are streaming now on BBC iPlayer. Visit bbc.co.uk/doctorwho for more content and doctorwho.tv for more quizzes and other content."
