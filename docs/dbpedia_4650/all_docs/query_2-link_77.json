        "text": "And so David Tennant is straight back in the Time Lord groove with the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials streaming weekly. Episode 2, Wild Blue Yonder, airs today on BBC One in the UK and Disney Plus around the world.\n\nThe second of the Anniversary Specials, Wild Blue Yonder, has been almost completely leak free but expectations are running very high and you can expect the same fabulous Donna/Doctor chemistry.\n\nShowrunner Russell T Davies has promised that Wild Blue Yonder will be \"a bit weird... it’s scary, it’s freaky, it pushes the show into areas it’s never quite been into before.\" The Doctor himself, David Tennant, adds: \"There’s a very fun scene with an apple very early on!\"\n\nNot long to wait now. We can all find out for ourselves from Saturday, December 2 and all the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials are available for FREE in the UK on the BBC iPlayer streaming service. But don't worry if you're on holiday because you can watch Wild Blue Yonder from anywhere with a VPN.\n\nKeep reading for all the information you'll need to stream online, including the Doctor Who episode 2 release schedule and watching when overseas.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who in the UK for free\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who in the US and Australia\n\nFor the first time, new episodes of Doctor Who will exclusively land on Disney Plus for Whovians outside the UK.\n\nDisney Plus prices start at $7.99 / £13.99 per month, with the value getting better if you sign up for an annual plan.\n\nIf you're in the US, you also have the option of paying a little more and getting the Disney Plus bundle.

And it's not a sonic screwdriver!\n\nNormally a streaming service will know where you are trying to tune in from and block you if you're not in the right country but a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an app that hides your location. That means you can access your usual sports and entertainment services even while you're traveling abroad.\n\nThe best VPN deal around right now is ExpressVPN, which is rated as a top VPN according to our sister site, TechRadar. There's a helpful guide on the best VPN services on TechRadar if you'd like to know more.\n\nHow to use a VPN to watch any stream\n\nDownload the app at NordVPN.\n\nChoose the location of the streaming service you want to watch (UK, US, etc)\n\nNavigate to the streaming service and start watching!\n\nThe trilogy of Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials are set to go out on three consecutive Saturdays, and started on November 25.

As the much-loved and even venerated fourth incarnation of the Doctor, Baker holds many records associated with the role other than that of being the oldest living actor to have played the role, including:\n\nHis span as the Doctor from 1974 to 1981 is the longest so far.\n\nIn that time, he recorded a record number of episodes (172).\n\n'City of Death’, broadcast in 1979 and starring Baker, has the highest viewing figures of any Doctor Who story ever (16.1m people watched part IV).\n\nHe remains the tallest Doctor, at 6ft 3in.\n\nAnd, with his long scarf and Poet Fedora hat, he is still the most iconic."
