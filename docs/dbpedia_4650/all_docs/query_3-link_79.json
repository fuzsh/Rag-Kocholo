        "text": "This had ‘easy gig’ written all over it. A near-future dystopian thriller about a world in which everything we do today with the aid of smartphones and laptops is transformed thanks to a high-tech brain implant that allows people to instantly share thoughts, memories and emotions.\n\nIt’s all there, right in front of your eyes – that’s the premise of Nick Clark Windo’s brilliant, prescient novel The Feed, which forms the basis of our show.\n\nWe managed to secure Channing Powell (The Walking Dead) as showrunner, added some of the UK’s hottest writing talent (Rachel Delahay, Tom Moran and Michael Clarkson) and off we went, urging them to let their imaginations roam free: “Don’t feel constrained about what the future might hold or look like.”\n\nIn Nick’s book, things start to unravel on about page 12, but after discussions with Amazon, Channing wanted series one to effectively be the backstory to the novel – a slow burn in which we see the world where The Feed (an Apple/Facebook/Amazon/Google mash-up that controls everything) works wonderfully well.\n\nWith simply the power of thought, you can speak to your partner, call a doctor or order a pizza. That is, until The Feed starts to glitch.\n\nPutting together a crack VFX team was our number one priority. Our crew, under DNEG team leader Steve Moncur, stretched from Mumbai to LA via Madrid. They worked up visual concepts and VFX producer Adam McInnes joined the team to manage the huge number of shots that left our edit each day for VFX work.\n\nAfter a quick back-of-an-envelope cost comparison, we alighted upon Manchester’s Space Studios as our production base. The story is set in London, but it was clear we would get a bigger bang for our buck by working in and around the north-west.\n\nThe Feed HQ, known in the story as ‘The Hub’, had to have all the futuristic architectural sex appeal of an iPhone and be able to believably sit next to the Thames somewhere in the high-tech east London of tomorrow.\n\nWe researched futuristic buildings in the north-west, then the Midlands and then the south-east. Nothing seemed to fit the bill, so with production dates looming, we had to start the studio build of the interior without knowing what we were matching it to. What could be simpler?\n\nBy the time we found a building with an interesting shape – in a science park in Anglesey, north Wales – we had already shot four episodes. We combined this with the magnificent atrium of the School of Politics at Oxford University.\n\nFinancially and logistically, this was a perfect storm. We were moving the unit long distances between shoots, often overnight, and had hundreds of supporting artists to transport first to Wales, then down to Oxford. It was expensive, and savings had to be made elsewhere to balance the books, but it was worth it for the added production value.\n\nThe opening of episode one shows the wedding of Ben Hatfield (Jeremy Neumark Jones) – the youngest son of The Feed creators Lawrence (David Thewlis) and Meredith Hatfield (Michelle Fairley) – to the daughter of the Japanese prime minister.\n\nNever ones for ducking a challenge, we shot the exteriors for this, with road closures and bus redirections, at the British Museum, which had to be transformed in vision into a Japanese pagoda – to show what The Feed can do. We then matched this to interiors at Wentworth Woodhouse near Rotherham.\n\nWe had a huge supporting artist call at both locations, which then had to be combined with a 40-metre, 360-degree green-screen shoot back at Space Studios in Manchester.\n\nThe future did nobble us on a couple of occasions – driverless cars are one example. They seemed like a good way of telling the audience we were in the future, until we considered the logistics of shooting them.\n\nDo you use a low loader? Conceal a stunt driver behind the seat or on the roof? Ultimately, we decided to save driverless cars for another day and another show.\n\nAfter six months of filming, we moved down to Soho, where we held hourly battles with the VFX team of Steve and Adam – “how much will that cost?” was a frequently asked question.\n\nMeanwhile, Jon Opstad wrote a stirring score and the VFX and ADR elves spun gold. Like I said, easy gig."
