        "text": "More than 800 episodes of Doctor Who from across the classic and modern era will soon be available to watch on BBC iPlayer, bringing the show's massive back catalogue under one roof.\n\nCurrently, fans of the Timelord can already enjoy the show's post-2005 relaunch on the platform, but from next month episodes from the original 1963-89 run will feature, too. Russell T Davies, Doctor Who showrunner, said: \"I’d like to thank the BBC for all the hard work to get this massive back catalogue under one roof, at long last. I'm so excited for new viewers - imagine being eight years old, spending winter afternoons exploring the '60s, '70s, '80s and beyond. And we’re determined this won't be a dusty museum - we have exciting plans to bring the back catalogue to life, with much more to be revealed!\"\n\nDan McGolpin, director of iPlayer and channels, added: \"Doctor Who has captivated countless millions of viewers on the BBC for 60 years, and in celebration of this special moment we are bringing classic series to BBC iPlayer for the first time. Fans will be able to enjoy many of the Doctor’s earliest adventures with William Hartnell right through to the very latest series and the soon to be released and tremendously exciting new anniversary specials with David Tennant.\n\n\"We want everyone to be able to enjoy this breathtaking back catalogue, so we are making each episode on iPlayer as accessible as possible, with subtitles, audio description and sign language all available for the first time.\"\n\nEventually, extra content will be added to the archive, including 100,000 documents such as correspondence, memos, designs and audience research, alongside orchestral scores of sheet music. To mark 60 years of the series, Doctor Who will return to our screens next month with three special episodes starring David Tennant as the 14th Doctor and Catherine Tate as Donna Noble.\n\nSex Education star Ncuti Gatwa’s first episode as the 15th Doctor will follow over the festive period. Gatwa will be joined in his adventure by Coronation Street star Millie Gibson as new companion Ruby Sunday. Doctor Who will premiere exclusively on the BBC in the UK and Ireland on November 1, while Disney Plus will be the home for new episodes internationally.\n\nThe science fiction juggernaut has so far featured 13 actors in the title role, starting with William Hartnell. In 2017, Jodie Whittaker made history by becoming the first woman to officially take on the role of the Doctor on television.\n\nDoctorin' The Tardis: Timelords through the ages:\n\nWilliam Hartnell (1963–1966)\n\nPatrick Troughton (1966–1969)\n\nJon Pertwee (1970–1974)\n\nTom Baker (1974–1981)\n\nPeter Davison (1982–1984)\n\nColin Baker (1984–1986)\n\nSylvester McCoy (1987–1989)\n\nPaul McGann (1996)\n\nChristopher Eccleston (2005)\n\nDavid Tennant (2005–2010 and forthcoming 2023)\n\nMatt Smith (2010–2013)\n\nPeter Capaldi (2014–2017)\n\nJodie Whittaker (2018–2022)\n\nNcuti Gatwa (2023)"
