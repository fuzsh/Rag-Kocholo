        "text": "If you want to watch the best of British television, the BBC is the place to be. With a tried and tested iPlayer VPN, you'll be able to stream everything – from your favorite shows to the latest music and sports events.\n\nWe've tested and retested the best VPN services to see which ones unblock BBC iPlayer consistently, and which ones aren't worth your time. In this guide, we'll give you quick recommendations and in-depth streaming VPN analysis to show you which ones are best for iPlayer.\n\nKeep scrolling to see how you can watch UK TV from abroad in just a few clicks, and how each of the best VPNs for iPlayer stack up against one another.\n\nThe best iPlayer VPNs at a glance\n\nJust want to get up and running? Here's a quick glance at the top 3 BBC iPlayer VPNs.\n\nThe best BBC iPlayer VPNs in 2024 – in-depth reviews\n\nHere's how my top iPlayer VPN picks compare, as well as each VPN's key features, test results, what I liked best about each service, and any reasons you might be better off avoiding them.\n\nThe best iPlayer VPN overall\n\nNordVPN continues to lead the way in our VPN testing – though, to be fair, the VPN always impresses. I had no trouble unblocking BBC iPlayer with NordVPN's help (and its sleek and stylish apps), and getting set up only takes a second. So, you'll spend less time scrolling through settings and more time catching up on your favorite British content.\n\nCurrently, NordVPN has a broad network of more than 6,400 servers, and 440 of them are based in the UK. This is great news for folks looking to appear as though they're in ol' Blighty and access BBC iPlayer, ITVX, All 4, and other British streaming services. That's not all, though – NordVPN has no trouble unblocking Disney Plus and Prime Video. Where Netflix is concerned, I think NordVPN is one of the best Netflix VPNs out there, reliably unblocking catalogs in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan. NordVPN could even provide a solution to the Netflix password-sharing ban.\n\nCurrently, NordVPN is sitting among 2024's quickest VPNs, though it no longer tops the list. While the speeds are no longer the fastest, they are still among the most reliable, meaning you can count on an awesome performance even during peak times. NordVPN is fast enough that you can leave it running in the background, and go about your day-to-day browsing, without noticing any major slowdown. That's not something all of today's top dogs can claim.\n\nNordVPN can get serious, too – and packs a ton of features into a subscription. A kill switch ensures that you don't leak information in the event of a VPN dropout, and P2P support makes NordVPN a top choice for folks on the hunt for a torrenting VPN. I'm particularly impressed by the fact that NordVPN has undertaken four independent security audits – and it's something I'd like to see other services emulate.\n\nOne of my only quibbles is that the map interface is somewhat glitchy. Admittedly, this is a fairly superficial qualm, but if you're using NordVPN on a device with a smaller screen, it could be a bit annoying. It's also worth noting that you'll only get 6 simultaneous connections, which might not be enough to cover a whole household.\n\nIf any problems arise, or if you need help accessing your BBC iPlayer favorites, the live-chat support is happy to help. You can also reach out via email, or do your own troubleshooting with the help of a well-stocked library of support articles and tutorials.\n\nThe best VPN for beginners\n\nExpressVPN is one of my go-to services for unlocking streaming content – and it's particularly adept at accessing BBC iPlayer content. I didn't run into any hiccups during my testing, and I'm confident that total VPN newbies will have an easy time of it, too.\n\nOn the subject of servers, there are more than 3,000 to choose from, scattered across 106 countries, and a decent selection of UK locations in London, the Docklands, and the Midlands. These UK servers come in handy for unblocking BBC iPlayer and other on-demand platforms, like ITVX and All 4. During my tests, I was able to access a huge library of content without any roadblocks. The VPN also claims to unblock other Brit favorites, including BT Sports and Now, and international staples like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney Plus.\n\n► Try ExpressVPN with a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nYou shouldn't run into any issues, but if you do struggle to unblock BBC iPlayer (and if the Smart Location server feature isn't fixing the problem), live chat support is available 24/7. ExpressVPN's agents are always happy to help, and can point out exactly which server you should use to continue your journey through the BBC's extensive collection of entertainment.\n\nExpressVPN has some of my favorite apps – they're incredibly easy to use, regardless of the device you install them on, and have a fresh, fun design. It's a little disappointing that the VPN only gives users eight simultaneous connections to play with, especially when Surfshark supports unlimited devices, but this is usually more than enough to cover the important gadgets in your house.\n\nAdmittedly, ExpressVPN isn't the fastest service on my shortlist – that honor goes to Surfshark. That doesn't mean ExpressVPN moves at a snail's pace, even if its speeds have dropped again to 410 Mbps. These results place it somewhat below average for performance, but you'll still easily be able to stream, torrent, and game online.\n\nThe ExpressVPN price point is on the steeper side, that's undeniable, but you're getting a premium provider stuffed with features, and proven security, as well as reliable access to BBC iPlayer and other popular streaming platforms.\n\nThe best cheap iPlayer VPN\n\nDon’t be fooled by the dirt cheap price – Surfshark is one of my favorite providers and has just as much to offer as many of its pricier rivals. You'll get a full toolkit of security features, well above average speeds (in fact, it's one of the fastest), and unlimited simultaneous connections to play with, which is some serious value for money.\n\nSurfshark knocks it out of the park when it comes to unblocking streaming platforms – and with more than 3,200 servers spread over 100 countries, it's easy to see why. You'll have reliable access to UK staples like BBC iPlayer, as well as Netflix, Prime Video, and Hulu. Basically, you'll never run out of box sets and movies.\n\nIf you're looking for the perfect streaming companion, Surfshark's speeds put it top of the list. The VPN prevailed in my latest batch of testing, hitting peaks of 950 Mbps which makes it the quickest VPN around. In short? With Surfshark in your arsenal, you probably won't even notice you're connected to a VPN, even when streaming in 4K.\n\nFar from being a basic VPN, Surfshark offers great security with its private DNS on each server, and a double-hop ability to further obfuscate your location to ensure ultimate privacy. Add to this P2P support, split tunneling, and more, and you’ve got a premium package. The recent (and welcome) addition of Dedicated IP should result in fewer CAPTCHA checks, too.\n\nThe Surfshark apps are nice and simple to use, even if you're totally new to the world of VPNs, and work well on just about any device you can imagine. There's even a dedicated Linux GUI – which makes a nice change from the bog-standard command-line interface you'll see most other providers offering.\n\nYou shouldn't run into too many hiccups with Surfshark, but if you do need a bit of expert advice (about which server or protocol to use, for example), you can reach out to the customer service team via live chat.\n\nOther VPNs I've tested and recommend\n\nWhether it’s a journey through time and space with the Time Lord in Doctor Who or strutting on the mainstage of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, Proton VPN makes light work of unblocking BBC iPlayer's extensive library no matter where you find yourself. Whether you’re outside of the UK, or in an office or school where access to BBC iPlayer is blocked, hop onto one of Proton’s UK servers and you’ll be able to stream content as if you were at home.\n\nAlongside that, it does a great job of unblocking other popular services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime, and YouTube. In my most recent tests, I also tried out other UK services, ITVX and All 4, as well as Aussie on-demand channels 9Now and 10Play, and Proton VPN only failed to unblock 10Play. That's an impressive and near-perfect score, and Proton VPN even plans to release an Amazon Fire TV Stick VPN app this year.\n\nProton VPN's speeds have seen an impressive level of improvement, rising from 510 Mbps to over 950 Mbps when using its WireGuard protocol. These speeds put Proton among the fastest VPN providers currently available, perfect for streaming your favorite shows. Plus, with OpenVPN speeds of around 400 Mbps, you won't find faster speeds on this protocol aside from Surfshark and Mullvad plans, a serious feat of speed.\n\nAlongside its deteriorating speeds and no sign of 24/7 live chat, there are a few drawbacks that put Proton VPN lower down in my recommendations. What's more, it can be pretty complex – both in terms of its apps and their usability, and when it comes to navigating the online support site.\n\nThe new browser extension for Chrome and Firefox sounds promising, however. It claims to let users connect to different servers in different browsers, which means you could browse BBC iPlayer in the UK and Netflix in the US without having to switch IP addresses.\n\nProton VPN's drawbacks may or may not be a dealbreaker depending on what you need from the service. With its own free VPN, though, prospective customers can give it a try to see if it's worth upgrading to a paid account. Be warned, however, that the unblocking features are reserved for paying customers, so you won't be able to watch BBC iPlayer unless you subscribe to one of its premium plans.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice about CyberGhost is its sprawling server network. There are more than 9,200 servers dotted across 91 countries and over 700 of those are in the UK, in London, Manchester, and Berkshire. With their help, you'll be able to unblock BBC iPlayer, even if the first UK server you connect to doesn't work.\n\nI also like that CyberGhost has a roster of specialized servers for specific streaming platforms. Connect to the BBC iPlayer server for more reliable access to your UK favorites, or switch things up and check out the Netflix and Amazon Prime libraries. It is worth noting, however, that the service struggles to unblock Disney+ and 10Play, which is a little disappointing.\n\nThe overall performance is more encouraging – CyberGhost's speeds are consistently quick, achieving peaks of 760 Mbps when I last put it to the test. That's a slight improvement from its previous 730 Mbps speeds and keeps it comfortably above ExpressVPN in terms of speeds.\n\nThere are a ton of handy features to check out, including an auto-connect feature, although I would like to see CyberGhost implement notifications when it connects or disconnects. The CyberGhost apps themselves are fantastic, too. They're sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate, even if you're using your smartphone.\n\nIn even better news, CyberGhost has begun to address some of my previous security concerns by undergoing a zero-logs audit, carried out by Deloitte. That's a great start, and now I'd like to see a deeper dive into its apps and overall security to really cement its place as a reliable and robust service.\n\nThe CyberGhost support site could use some TLC, too – I'd like to see more in-depth articles and tutorials that'll help users troubleshoot issues if they crop up. However, the live chat support is excellent, and has always been quick to help me tackle techy queries.\n\nHow to choose an iPlayer VPN\n\nNot all VPNs are made equal, and BBC iPlayer has proven to be one of the tricker streaming services to crack. So, what makes the best BBC iPlayer VPN?\n\nWell, at the top of the list is the ability to unblock BBC iPlayer and a selection of UK-based servers to get the job done. My top five picks can all circumvent geo-restrictions and access BBC iPlayer, as well as other popular UK TV channels' on-demand counterparts, such as ITVX and All 4.\n\nUnblocking is integral, but you'll also want a provider that puts power behind its software – and we're talking about speed. Your VPN needs to maintain a strong connection, and that's doubly important if you're connecting to a server based in another country (and potentially halfway across the world)! If not, you might fall victim to endless buffering and less-than-ideal picture quality, and nobody wants that.\n\nSecurity should also be of the utmost importance. While streaming may not initially seem like a privacy nightmare waiting to happen, consider the safety of your logins and payment details (more so regarding other services and websites you might use as iPlayer is, of course, free). If you happen to be streaming while traveling, you'll likely be using public networks with weak security. Don't leave yourself open to threats, and ensure you've got a VPN that walks the walk when it comes to safeguarding your digital privacy.\n\nWith networks stretching across the globe (including the UK), awesome speeds, and all-important security features, my shortlist of BBC iPlayer VPNs will ensure you have unfettered access to the very best British content.\n\nHow to unblock BBC iPlayer with a VPN\n\nUsing a VPN with iPlayer is way simpler than it sounds. Let me show you how to do it in just 3 steps:\n\nPick a VPN that suits you best: all of the apps above have proven time and again that they unblock BBC iPlayer in our stringent testing.\n\nConnect to the UK: once you've got your VPN, install it on the device you want to stream on, and pick a server in the UK. Most premium VPNs will automatically assign you the fastest server, so don't worry about which city to use.\n\nStart streaming: head over to iPlayer and watch UK TV from anywhere in the world.\n\nYou'll get the best results from a web browser, especially if you have the VPN's extension installed, but most will work with the iPlayer app, too.\n\niPlayer VPN FAQs\n\nWhat is the best working BBC iPlayer VPN?\n\nRight now, NordVPN tops my list of the best BBC iPlayer VPNs. It continues to provide a near-unrivaled experience for unblocking BBC iPlayer, thanks to a smart mix of speeds, security, and compatibility. With apps for almost any device, a wide array of security features, and some of the fastest WireGuard speeds available, you'll struggle to fault your experience using NordVPN with BBC iPlayer.\n\nWhy would I need a VPN for BBC iPlayer?\n\nWith more streaming services popping up than we can feasibly subscribe to, the BBC's on-demand platform, BBC iPlayer, is a bit of an anomaly, offering thousands of TV shows and films to stream 100% for free. However, if you find yourself outside of the UK for whatever reason, you're going to need a VPN to bypass the geo-restrictions implemented across the platform's library of content.\n\nHosting incredible British television like Peaky Blinders, BBC iPlayer is also the place to watch Sally Rooney adaptations Normal People and Conversations with Friends, and US imports like the 2021 reboot of Gossip Girl. You'll also want an iPlayer VPN to watch Gavin and Stacey, Fleabag, and Strictly Come Dancing.\n\nWhat else can a VPN do?\n\nVPNs have become a handy way to watch your favorite shows when abroad and open up a whole world of content on BBC iPlayer and beyond – the amount of people using a VPN for Netflix is enormous. The same goes for Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and regular domestic stations, too.\n\nThe geo-spoofing nature of virtual private networks that makes them so useful for streaming also acts as the perfect tool for unblocking restricted websites and sidestepping country-wide internet restrictions. This is also why VPNs for use in China are so popular.\n\nTheir encrypted tunnels also make VPNs a kind of de facto antivirus companion. Using an unrelated IP address effectively makes you anonymous as you use the internet, and your data is shielded from prying eyes and cyber crooks.\n\nIf you fancy learning more, or just want to brush up on your VPN know-how, I've put together a guide that'll show you how to use a VPN."
