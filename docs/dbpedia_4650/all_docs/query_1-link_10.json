Fifteenth Doctor will be teamed up with Ruby Sunday, played by Millie Gibson.\n\nTechnically on its 14th season (and also, in a way, its 40th), the show is getting a rebrand this year as Season One, but we’ll mostly refer to it as Season 14 in this article.\n\nIf you want to watch Doctor Who Season 14, read on. Below is a full guide on how to watch Doctor Who in the U.S., including an easy way to access the U.K.’s free Doctor Who streams and where to stream past seasons of the hit series.\n\nStream Doctor Who Season 14 for Free with a VPN\n\nThe best way to watch Doctor Who Season 14 is to stream the series on BBC iPlayer; a free U.K. streaming service. Although normally only available to U.K. viewers, fans in the U.S. can access BBC iPlayer with a good VPN. These services let you securely connect to U.K. servers, essentially tricking your streaming device into thinking it’s in the U.K. (or any other region).\n\nIf you don’t already have a VPN, we suggest ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Both are fast and boast secure encryption at a reasonable price, letting you access geo-restricted content all over the world. Both cost around $13 a month (less if you pay for multiple months upfront) and come with 30-day money-back guarantees.\n\nHow to Watch Doctor Who Season 14 in the U.S.\n\nDon’t feel like using a VPN? You can tune into Doctor Who Season 14 on Disney+. The streaming service will be the exclusive home of Doctor Who Season 14 in the U.S.\n\nDisney+ offers two subscription tiers: with ads or ad-free. The ad-supported plan costs $7.99 a month and the ad-free plan costs $13.99 a month. You can also get Disney+ through the Disney Bundle, which includes Disney+ and Hulu in the Duo package, or Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ in the Trio package. These bundles start at $9.99 a month for the ad-supported Duo package and go up to $24.99 a month for the ad-free Trio plan. Check out all the Disney Bundle plans here.\n\nOnce you’re signed up for Disney+, you’ll be able to watch new episodes of Doctor Who right when they come out. Disney+ has a ton of other content too, from Andor to X-Men ‘97.\n\nWhen Does Doctor Who Season 14 Come Out?\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 premieres with a double-episode release on Disney+ on Friday, May 10 at 7 p.m. ET. The first two episodes release in the U.K. on BBC iPlayer simultaneously (at 12 a.m. GMT). New episodes will then come out on Fridays each week. There will be eight episodes in total."
