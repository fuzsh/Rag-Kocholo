        "text": "Awesome news, but I find the restriction to WiFi odd, given my Nokia N900 plays fine over 3G using nothing more complicated than the Flash v9 plug-in in it's (FireFox based) browser. I've used this to watch BBC red button coverage of Formula 1 practice sessions on the train on Friday mornings, for instance. Sure, the video is a little jerky, but the audio is rock solid, which is *exactly* what I expect, given the circumstances.\n\nSurely it would make more sense for the app (or the user) to decide on the bandwidth available, and if even the lowest quality stream won't work, then fail (or better yet, warn your doing your best but it wont be up to par), rather than assuming (apparently falsely) that only WiFi is good enough. I'd be interested to know why the blanket ban is in place...\n\nI have mplayer in my phone, the application on which you let your lawyers lose because a one man band could provide a better service than all your development team. I can only imagine that was the only way to avoid further embarrassement.\n\nSo now I hold my Android 2.1 phone and I am wondering why mplayer was far more capable on it than the application you are releasing officially is in newer phones?\n\nSo you are yet again siding with your chums in the production companies and do zilch to empower the people forced to pay your salaries.\n\nThanks for nothing BBC, please let us know when you are prepared to work for the benefit of the licence fee payer....\n\nThe best part of a year ago another developer had an app capable of downloading iPlayer content to iPhones for playback when out of WiFi range, but was blocked from releasing it. And now after all this time you aren't releasing the the iOS app for the phone, and the iPad version won't do any more than the website via the iPad.\n\nIn the meantime other apps will continue to give me what you won't i.e. the ability to listen to BBC radio shows I'm paying for, when *and where* I want to listen to them.\n\nI think you're missing the point with all of this.\n\nI think you're missing the point.\n\nI'm really continuously disappointed in the BBC. I wish you would just admit what the rest of us already know; that you HATE Android, and indeed anything Open Source in general, because you can't control it.\n\nSeeing as we've already had Beebplayer, MyPlayer, and accessing the normal iPlayer web site over 3G (by selecting the non-mobile user agent option in the Android browser), there is absolutely ZERO reason why you couldn't actually give us Android users what we all wanted. Namely, an app that works over 3G which uses MP4 streams, the same streams that both the iPhone AND Android can use. You keep banging on about quality (the reason you're choosing Flash+Wifi), but NO ONE CARES. All we want to do is watch some telly while we're on the move. What is the point of creating an app for a MOBILE platform which needs WIFI to actually do anything?\n\nLuckily, this being Android, some bright spark will hack the .apk and make it work over 3G regardless. Me? I'll stick to MyPlayer and TVCatchup....\n\nFirst of all congratulations for planning to put out the official Andriod iPlayer - well overdue but most welcome. The iPlayer on the other platforms is a great addition to the BBC's output. However, it's pretty poor that it won't be running on Andriod 2.1.This may say more about the limited development skills in the BBC's team (or contractors) to create high-performance optimised code (which is indeed an art). Relying on extra procesing power in the future is no substitute for creating an optimised product from the outset as this gives more creative possibilities in the future. The 'management' wrap about gving people the 'best' experience doesn't ring true. Looks like something being developed down to a price and under duress with a hint of 'Auntie knows best'. Yes, the earlier platforms may not be as performant but that shouldn't preclude users being able to make their *own* decisions as to whether it will work well enough for them (abeit with caveats on its likely performance) - and the development team doing their bit to make it work as well as it could. Upgrade and backward compatability is an area where many software providers get it wrong; in general Apple have been very careful on this which has given them a significant market advantage imho. This in contrast to certain Android vendors who have failed (miserably) to provide an upgrade path from their Android 2.1 offerings to version 2.2 - making a switch back to Apple more attractive. This means that some people under contract will not be able to move up anytime soon. The question is is the BBC Android iPlayer going to be a class leading product or will it be slow and bloated (such that it wouldn't fit into the remaining phone memory on many Android 2.1 phones anyway). I'm hoping it will be good product into the future. Good luck with the launch.\n\nNick, since you keep popping up to add comments prehaps you can explain 2 things to Android users.\n\n1. Why does the Android version need flash when the ipad version doesn't.\n\n2. Since we will have to have flash installed why should Android users not just go to the iPlayer Website rather than waste space on our devices installing your app which will do exactly the same thing.\n\n3. Why has licence payers money been wasted developing an App to do nothing that can't be done in the browser (with flash installed) and on the legal fees incurred shutting down people who produced better and more competent apps.\n\nI don't expect to get answers to these questions, since you seem to have steadfastly ignored them so far.\n\nBaldyman1966 - watch out for a follow up post about the new apps in the next few days.\n\nHowever regarding Flash this was what David said in the post I have already linked to:\n\n\"Using Adobe Flash 10.1 streaming on mobile delivers significant infrastructure efficiencies for the BBC, as we use our existing video and audio encoding plant to create the streams. We don't need to install any new kit or set up any new servers. We just use what we already have to offer a higher quality BBC iPlayer on mobile experience.\n\nEnabling Flash on Android 2.2 devices also means that all current and new devices that support Android 2.2 can get BBC iPlayer. These devices all use the same standard Flash player which means we can offer a consistently high quality playback across all of them. Previously we had to review and test BBC iPlayer on a device-by-device basis to ensure the right high quality experience. Now we can offer BBC iPlayer on mobile to a whole group of devices at once, which is clearly much more efficient...\n\n...Adobe Flash reaches an estimated 95% of PCs which means the BBC can use Flash streaming technologies to reach audiences on the internet right across the UK with a consistent video playback experience.\n\nAs soon as Flash streaming came to mobile, through Adobe's Flash 10.1 player on Android 2.2 devices, it made sense to make the most of our existing Flash infrastructure to bring that consistent playback experience to mobile as well.\"\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks\n\nMove along. No news here.\n\nSorry, but repackaging a web page inside the browser view of an app doesn't count as innovation, improvement or increasing availability. (Re-)allowing access to the 3G streams you _already_ produce, perhaps even letting iPhone/iPad/Android users know that they exist, might do, but of course that would be encouraging use of \"low quality\" video!\n\nI appreciate that the BBC has commited to Flash as the future of iPlayer. Fine. May I therefore suggest that you obsolete/delete the non-Flash based streams that are currently generated and remove access from everyone not using a PC/Wii/new Android handset. For those that don't realise, here are the other streams that are generated for every show on iPlayer:\n\nRTSP streamed H.264 @ 176 x 96, 80 kbps (for Nokia over 3G)\n\nHTTP downloaded DRM'd WMV 9 @ 320 x 176 (for Nokia download)\n\nRTSP streaming H.264 @ 320 x 176, 128 kbps (for Nokia WiFi)\n\nHTTP downloaded H.264 @ 483 x 272, 400 kbps (for iPhone)\n\nKontiki Peer to Peer WMV 9 @ 672 x 544 (for Windows download)\n\nExcluding the download service they are evidently lower quality than on your TV, so let's get rid of them. I doubt anyone will mind.\n\n\"If the BBC gave you something that worked poorly on your chosen device I suggest you might be unhappy. \"\n\nYes, if I knew there was a better alternative. If the alternative is no iPlayer at all, I'll take what I can get. Your arguments are missing the point: noone can stream high quality video over 3G, so why not expand the service that has been offered to Nokia users for several years.\n\nI've read the whole thread, but I'm still looking for clarification. What are the BBC's plans/policy towards the iPod Touch?\n\nI bought one recently - it's efectively an iPad, just with a smaller screen. The majority of iPad apps work with it, but there's no sign of the BBC's iPlayer in the App Store because they seem to have flagged it as \"iPad only\".\n\nI tried using the \"Bigscreen iPlayer\" trick that used to work for the iPad, but just get told to \"Download Flash\". Does this mean that iPad support has been removed from this as well? Or are you using the browser string to decide, and if so why just the iPad but not the iPod?\n\nSome answers would be much appreciated.\n\n@Peet the Sadly Truncated\n\nAll iOS devices can use a version of the iPlayer website that will offer streams in the MP4 format that the devices can handle. This is one of the reasons why in its current state the app seems a bit pathetic, as it offers no functionality over the website you can visit in mobile safari.\n\n@Matt\n\nIn reply to why would you want to store video, there are many reasons, but these are the two main ones.\n\n1 - streaming over 3G is not always possible (blocks like the BBC have put into this app, or simply down to stupid usage caps by networks).\n\n2 - 3G coverage can be spotty at best. Especially when travelling and on public transport (when a mobile iPlayer app would be most useful).\n\nI've got Android 2.2, I've got Flash 10.1 \"Lite\", Flash streams work from almost every other website on the internet except the BBC. Adobe won't bring out 10.1 for the HTC Legend because of its CPU but when they demo'd Flash 10.1 it was on the same CPU.\n\nBasically because Adobe are lazy the BBC won't let me view its content.\n\nApplications like Beebplayer and myPlayer for Android which deliver the Apple steams to Android (and work very well) get shutdown by the BBC but the BBC won't provide alternatives. I don't understand the logic, if I have an old iPhone I can watch the BBC, if I have a newer but not highest spec Android I'm NOT allowed to watch the BBC.\n\nAlso you don't need Wifi, it works over 3g fine with a good signal. Wifi only is purely to keep the mobile operators happy. Beebplayer works over 3G and is very watchable even while on the move.\n\nThe BBC mobile technology department has a lot of inconsistency in its policy's clearing favouring certain manufactures and operation systems. Previous explanations by Erik Huggers clearly highlight he / the team don't understand the issues and the technology.\n\nUsing Adobe Flash 10.1 streaming on mobile delivers significant infrastructure efficiencies for the BBC, as we use our existing video and audio encoding plant to create the streams. We don't need to install any new kit or set up any new servers.\n\nSounds reasonable enough at first glance, but try this instead:\n\nUsing the same h264/MP4 streams for Android clients as we do for iOS delivers significant infrastructure efficiencies for the BBC, as we use our existing video and audio encoding plant to create the streams. We don't need to install any new kit or set up any new servers.\n\nIs that any less reasonable? If not, why not just do that then? If you could give us the 'technical' reason alluded to, but not included in the original post why something that we already know works can't work, I'm sure that would help.\n\nThanks Nick. I look forward to hearing more about where the BBC is planning to take iPlayer in the future.\n\nFrom my own personal perspective, I think those asking for a mobile download service are unlikely to be satisfied - DRM being too much of an issue for cross-platform support at the moment (except in iOS through iTunes, maybe?!). However, I'd really like to see the (already produced) H.264 iPhone streams moved to a container which is more accessible. It's at an ideal resolution for mobile use on all platforms, or for those with slower connections. I'd also like to see a low-res version (ie. the 3GP stream) opened to everyone, including the iPhone - 3G/H streaming is going to be the future demand. Neither of these would have any impact on the \"existing infrastructure\".\n\nLooking back at how the roadmap has changed over the years, I was intrigued by Antony Rose's post (https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/03/bbc_iplayer_on_iphone_behind_t.html%29:\n\n\"For devices with browsers [...] getting BBC iPlayer working on those devices \"merely\" requires us to provide audio and/or video streams in a format that is supported by the media player(s) available on that device. \"\n\nWhen did this attitude change? It seems from today's post that, when everyone else is moving into the browser, iPlayer plans to move out into platform-specific \"apps\"!\n\nPeople need to understand that the BBC absolutely must use a technology that supports DRM in order to enable access to as much of their programming as possible. It's just not possible to secure the rights to stream content from rights holders if that content is not properly protected with anti-piracy methods. I'm very sure the BBC itself has the same policy in all its licensing agreements.\n\nI can understand the frustration with the choice of Flash on Android devices. This is why I have been so supportive of Apple's stance on blocking Adobe's technology from its platform. The policy enforces the need for the likes of the BBC to utilise superior technologies that result in a better user experience for owners of iOS devices. Many of the heated comments in this blog entry really back up what Apple was saying about Flash last year.\n\nFascinating to see the BBC try come up with technical justifications for refusing to bring video to lots of platforms well capable of it. The fact of the matter is that the BBCs' #1 concern is an obsession with \"content protection\", and a belief that some platforms are \"safe\" (Apple and others) - and so get access to HTTP and HTML interfaces for iPlayer - and others are not (Android) and thus are denied. And then the amazing belief that Flash can somehow make unsafe platforms safe!\n\nThe BBC is very reluctant to discuss this issue in public, except in the most vague, high-level management speak - thus avoiding actual technical substance. Mentioning the subject here will not infrequently get warnings about off-topicness, even on posts where the issue quite clearly is pertinent.\n\nWorse, the BBC, as far as I know (and I've made formal and informal queries), has not even any empirical evidence to support its content protection policies. E.g. there is no evidence Flash adds any security (unless you believe Adobe sales-people). There is no evidence denying access to the HTML video player has prevented any copying. I'm still using get_iplayer... (I'd *like* to use the official HTML iPlayer, if only the BBC would let me!). So while there is no evidence *for* this content protection policy, there is plenty of good technical argument as to why it would be ineffective - and I'm sure at least some technical folk in the BBC have tried point it to management.\n\nAt least be straight with us. You lose a lot more respect when you try treat us as fools.\n\nFairly simple, surely - Flash 10.1 and iOS support a (small) level of content protection, which prevents us from easily downloading the video stream onto our desktop machines (i.e. the changes that recently broke the excellent iPlayer downloader).\n\nIt's also worth remembering - with all the accusations that the BBC is in bed with/biased towards Apple, that the ONLY reason the open H264 streams existed at all, is down to Apple's stance on Flash. The ONLY reason we could then use them on other devices and software, is because there was no way to authenticate the device.\n\n(What's changed recently is that with the most recent update, the BBC can more reliably authenticate that the client is iOS or a Playstation via certificates).\n\nI also recall a good period where Apple users were excluded from using iPlayer when it was a Windows-only program using a Microsoft-only DRM technology - with the BBC's explanation being Apple's lack of support for video DRM - outside of their own iTunes store.\n\nBefore all that, the BBC used RealPlayer.\n\nI don't see any evidence of the BBC having a preferred partner - just that they've always used commercial rather than open solutions.\n\nBut then, a large reason for that, would be that the producers of open solutions are never interested in meeting the content producers even half-way.\n\nAgain, Apple established the iTunes store before demanding the majors dropped DRM, from a position of power. They were able to make similar demands with iOS ('no, we won't support Flash, you support us').\n\nOpen streams will come when someone with similar clout demands them - not by winning the technical argument that DRM can always be defeated.\n\niPlayer, Android, and the fallacy of the DRM argument.\n\nA lot of people here seem to be under considerable confusion regarding Android and iPlayer, though a lot of that is due to that I consider marketing double-speak from the BBC.\n\nFirst of all, the requirements to run the iPlayer application on an Android device:\n\n1. The device must have an ARMv7 processor. There are many current Android devices that use ARMv6 processors and cannot run Adobe Flash 10.1. iPlayer requires the FULL Flash 10.1, Flash lite will not suffice.\n\n2. The device must be running Android 2.2 (or higher). There are many current devices that are still being sold with Android 2.1. Some of these may never be updated.\n\nSecondly, the notion that the BBC is using Flash because in insists on DRM for its content and that cannot be provided on an open-source platform.\n\n1. The BBC provide DRM free 3gp streams for Nokia device. These do not have a DRM component and were used by the BeebPlpayer and MyPlayer Android applications that were killed by the BBC. It is no more difficult to rip these streams from a Nokia device that from an Android device (or, indeed, from a PC). The \"It must have DRM\" argument just doesn't hold water.\n\n2. There is no earthly reason why a DRM solution cannot be provided for Android (or any other Open Source platform). True, it is easier for closed source, largely because most DRM systems rely on \"Security by Obscurity\", which brings me onto my 3rd point:\n\n3. DRM is a failed concept. All DRM systems are eventually circumvented. The main effect of DRM is to annoy legitimate users (or, as in this case, deny them access to the content they have paid for). DRM actually benefits those it is designed to defeat (professional / commercial pirates and prolific file sharers). If DRM prevent a legitimate user making reasonable use of the content they have paid for (or denies them access entirely), then they are likely to turn to more nefarious means of obtaining that content from those that DO have the ability to defeat the DRM of the content in question.\n\nThe BBC has behaved exceedingly badly with regards to the provision of iPlayer on Android. First, by killing off the two applications that permitted ANY Android user to access iPlayer, publishing, quite frankly, weak and absurd reasons for those actions. They then introduce, first, a web based iplayer client, then an application, which only support a subset of Android devices, being exceedingly cagey over its limitations with regards to supported devices.\n\nThe really absurd this about this \"app\" is that it it only supports the same devices as the existing web interface. Why did the BBC spend time an money developing an app that isn't needed when it could have developed an application for non-Flash Android devices?\n\n@71 Nick Reynolds\n\nYour post make it appear that the minimum requirement for Android 2.2 is an ARMv7 processor, this is simply not the case.\n\nThere are plenty of current Android phones with ARMv7 processor that do not have Android 2.2, and plenty of current (some only just released) phones with Android 2.2 that have ARMv6 processors.\n\nNeither can run Flash 10.0 or iPlayer.\n\nIt is imperative that the BBC makes it ABSOLUTELY clear that Android 2.2 is not the sole requirement for iPlayer. Someone signing up to a 2 year contract on an Android phone (with Android 2.2) thinking it will run iPlayer, and then finding that it will NEVER have that capability, is likely to be exceedingly annoyed.\n\nAs \"Eponymous Cowherd\" correctly points out. The BBC need to stop trotting out the line about Android 2.2, that is not the solution. You must have Android 2.2 with a ARM7 CPU !\n\nThis is confusing for end user buts the requirements Adobe have laid down and the ones thus the BBC must promote if Flash 10.1 is the answer for Android.\n\nSeveral ARM7 powered phones are stuck on Android 2.1 and won't be upgraded. Motorola and Sony Ericsson for example, how gutted would you be if you bought a £450 (of a high per month contract) SE Xperia X10 and now you can't get iPlayer or Flash because of lack of support from your manufacture.\n\nNick Reynolds, can you explain the BBC stand on Flash 10.1 LITE as supplied by some handset manufactures like HTC. I can view high quality streams from Sky News, ITV, C4, Youtube, CNN (the list goes on) but not the BBC. It might be a halfway house solution but it works."
