        "text": "David Farnor | On 13, Aug 2015\n\nCurzon Home Cinema has launched on Virgin Media TiVo boxes.\n\nThe pay-per-view VOD platform, which offers independent and art house films to rent, is operated by the Curzon Cinemas chain, including the Artificial Eye label. While the company continues to build its theatrical network, with new cinemas are planned in Oxford, Colchester, Acton and Tunbridge Wells, that joint role of distributor and exhibitor has given its VOD arm a stream of day-and-date releases., This has helped to establish Curzon Home Cinema as a go-to destination for smaller titles that may not receive a wide theatrical release in UK.\n\nTitles currently on the service include Still Alice starring Julianne Moore, the recently released Manglehorn starring Al Pacino and – later this month – Andrew Haigh’s acclaimed 45 Years.\n\nNow, Curzon Home Cinema’s catalogue will be available in the living rooms of Virgin Media customers, thanks a new deal between the companies. As well as the TiVo app, rented films will be available to watch across a number of platforms, including Amazon Fire TV, Freesat Freetime set-top boxes and integrated TVs, iOS devices, computers and Samsung Smart TV and BT TV. Users can now pause then resume watching on another device.\n\nDavid Bouchier, Chief Digital Entertainment Officer at Virgin Media, says: “We’re delighted to bring Curzon Home Cinema’s films and curated selections to our customers across the country. We’re passionate about keeping people entertained with an ever increasing movie offering which is why TiVo is the perfect home for Curzon’s app.”\n\nPhil Mordecai, Director of Curzon Home Cinema, adds: “We are extremely excited to be bringing 80 years of cinema expertise to Virgin Media TiVo customers, who can now enjoy a Curzon Cinema experience in the comfort of their own home.”\n\nThe new agreement continues Curzon’s expansion across devices in both the living rooms and trouser pockets of its audience. It follows the recent re-launch of the VOD service to include a mobile responsive layout and make it easier to find films."
