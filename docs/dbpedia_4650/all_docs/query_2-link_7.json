Learn more here.\n\nKey Takeaways: How to Watch Doctor Who Season 14 on BBC iPlayer\n\nSign up for a secure, consistent VPN service like ExpressVPN.\n\nOpen the VPN on your device and connect to a U.K. server.\n\nSign in to BBC iPlayer and start streaming ‘Doctor Who.’\n\nWhat to Know About Streaming Doctor Who:\n\nQuick rundown: British TV series ‘Doctor Who’ has its roots in the year 1963 and is still going strong to this day with multitudes of fans from all around the world. It follows the exploits of a time lord known as the “The Doctor” from the planet Gallifrey.\n\nSeason 14: This year, ‘Sex Education’ fan-favorite Ncuti Gatwa takes the lead as the doctor in a brand-new season of ‘Doctor Who.’ He will be joined by Millie Gibson, who portrays Ruby Sunday. Disney+ will broadcast the new season, though all episodes will also be free on BBC iPlayer.\n\nFun fact: Though one of the world’s most famous characters, Doctor Who’s real name has never been revealed. Exactly why is unclear, but someone on Reddit1 has speculated that this might be because there are many names attached to the Doctor — the names of people he previously knew.\n\nBest VPN for Streaming Doctor Who\n\nSeason 14 of the beloved sci-fi series ‘Doctor Who’ arrives in the U.S. on May 10, but you can watch it for free on BBC iPlayer from May 11 (U.K.) In light of this, fans should check out our guide on how and where to watch ‘Doctor Who’ for free no matter where you are in the world.\n\nIf you’re in the U.K., it’s easy to stream ‘Doctor Who’ episodes for free on BBC iPlayer, but if you’re outside the U.K., you may need to pay for a streaming platform subscription if you don’t have a VPN.\n\nLuckily, if you’re outside the U.K. but have a decent VPN, you can use that VPN to stream the new ‘Doctor Who’ season 14 episodes on BBC iPlayer for free, as well as all previous seasons. Read on to learn how.\n\nAt a Glance: Where To Watch Doctor Who?\n\nIn some countries like the U.S., U.K. and Canada, you can also buy ‘Doctor Who’ on buy/rental platforms like Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video, but since it’s so easy to stream all episodes for free, you shouldn’t need to do this.\n\nClassic ‘Doctor Who’ (1963-1989): Tubi (U.S.), Britbox (U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\n\nModern seasons of ‘Doctor Who’ (2005-present, seasons 1-13): Max (formerly HBO Max) — U.S.), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\n\n‘Doctor Who’ season 14 (May 10, 2024 release): Disney+ (U.S. and international), BBC iPlayer (U.K.)\n\n60th Anniversary specials (2023): BBC iPlayer (U.K.), Disney+ (U.S. & international)\n\n‘The Sarah Jane Adventures’ (spin-off series: 2007): BBC iPlayer (U.K.), Max (U.S.)\n\nWhich Streaming Services Have Doctor Who Season 14?\n\nYou can stream ‘Doctor Who’ season 14 on Disney+ (international) from May 10, 2024 (U.S. time), but this is a paid platform. Luckily, the new season arrives on BBC iPlayer — which is a free platform — on May 11, 2024, at midnight (U.K. time).\n\nIf you’re overseas at the time of ‘Doctor Who’ season 14’s release on BBC iPlayer, you can connect to a British server on a VPN to use the streaming service. If you keep scrolling, you’ll find a step-by-step tutorial on how to do that.\n\nIs Doctor Who Season 14 on Netflix?\n\nNo, ‘Doctor Who’ season 14 is not on Netflix because Disney+ is the platform with the rights to stream the season internationally, while the BBC has the U.K. rights. However, copyright agreements for streaming platforms change fairly often, so there’s a chance ‘Doctor Who’ could come to Netflix one day.\n\nWhere to Watch Classic Doctor Who Series (1963 – 1989)?\n\nA classic never dies, and although a new season is being released, some may wish to journey back through time and delve into early ‘Doctor Who’ episodes. Early “doctors” include William Hartnell (First Doctor), Patrick Troughton (Second Doctor), Tom Baker (Fourth Doctor) and Colin Baker (Sixth Doctor). Here is a roundup of everywhere you can head for your fix of classic ‘Doctor Who’:\n\n(U.K.)\n\nTubi (U.S.)\n\n(U.S.)\n\nIf you’re outside a location where your desired streaming platform is available, you can connect to a VPN server in that location. For example, if you want to watch the classic series on free streaming service Tubi but are outside the U.S., you can connect to a U.S. server.\n\nWhere to Watch Modern Doctor Who Episodes (2005 – Present)?\n\nThe modern ‘Doctor Who’ era kicked off in 2005. As of May 10, 2024, the season is in its 14th run. “Doctors” from the modern era have included Christopher Eccleston (Ninth Doctor), David Tennant (Tenth Doctor), Matt Smith (Eleventh Doctor) and Peter Capaldi (Twelfth Doctor). Ncuti Gatwa portrays the Fifteenth Doctor in season 14, the latest season.\n\nYou can currently stream seasons 1 — 13 on the following platforms:\n\n(U.S.)\n\n(U.K.)\n\nHowever, season 14 has a new home in most countries. No doubt frustratingly for many fans, seasons 1 through 13 will remain on Max and will not move to the new platform. The good news is that a VPN can help you access all ‘Doctor Who’ episodes on BBC iPlayer. Season 14 is streamed on:\n\n(U.S. & international)\n\n(U.K.)\n\nIn addition to the above platforms, some seasons of modern ‘Doctor Who’ are available on demand on Pluto TV — another free platform — in Canada.\n\nWhere to Watch Doctor Who 60th Anniversary (2023)?\n\nIn 2023, three 60th-anniversary special ‘Doctor Who’ episodes were released. The specials marked the return of two British treasures and former cast members, David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and Catherine Tate (Donna Noble). Here are your options for watching the 60th Anniversary specials:\n\n(U.K.)\n\n(U.S. and international)\n\nWhere to Watch Doctor Who Christmas Specials (2005–2023)?\n\nThe ‘Doctor Who’ Christmas special episodes, including the most recent special, ‘The Church on Ruby Road’ (2023), which stars Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson, are on BBC iPlayer. Tune in from outside the U.K. by connecting to a U.K. server on a VPN.\n\nHow to Watch Doctor Who Free Online With a VPN\n\nIf you’ve never used a VPN before, you may be feeling confused about how you can use one to bypass geoblocks. Check out this tutorial on how to unblock BBC iPlayer with a VPN from outside the U.K. and stream ‘Doctor Who’ for free. We used ExpressVPN as our example.\n\nSign up for a VPN\n\nOnce you’ve settled on a VPN, head to the provider’s website to choose a plan that works for you. ExpressVPN and many other reliable services let you claim your money back within 30 days if you’re not satisfied.\n\nDownload the VPN App\n\nDownload the app file from the provider’s website, then open the file to install the app on your device. Mobile users can download the app onto their device directly from Google Play (Android) or the App Store (iOS).\n\nConnect to a U.K. Server\n\nLog in to the VPN’s app and navigate to the server list. Select a U.K. server from the list, then click “connect.”\n\nStream ‘Doctor Who’ on BBC iPlayer\n\nGo to BBC iPlayer and create an account if you haven’t already — when prompted, enter any U.K. postcode. Click “yes” when asked if you have a TV license. Once you’ve logged in, search for ‘Doctor Who’ to start streaming.\n\nThe Best VPNs to Stream Doctor Who\n\nIf you need a VPN to access BBC iPlayer or another service, you’ll want to make sure the provider you opt for has servers in your target country and is fast and secure. All VPNs come with their pros and cons (check out the full reviews for providers to learn more about this), but some have many more pros than they do cons, including the following providers:\n\nExpressVPN: This is a VPN service we’ve been using and testing for years and with which we’ve always had a positive experience in terms of security, speed and ease of use. You can learn more about our best overall VPN recommendation in our ExpressVPN review.\n\nNordVPN: In addition to having the best overall speeds and affordable plans, NordVPN offers a range of extra features you can include in or leave out of your plan as needed. Pop over to our NordVPN review for the full lowdown.\n\nSurfshark: This is a cheap and cheerful VPN service that doesn’t scrimp on features, Surfshark is a decent choice for those looking to save a few dollars. You probably already guessed it, but here’s our Surfshark review for those curious to know more.\n\nPrivadoVPN: Privado VPN is the best option for those in need of a secure free VPN service. Like other free services, PrivadoVPN has its limitations, but it has a free U.K. server and works well with streaming platforms like BBC iPlayer. We’ve got a full PrivadoVPN review that discusses the ins and outs of the service.\n\nHow To Watch Doctor Who by Doctor\n\nThe infamous series is currently on its fifteenth doctor. With so many actors having taken on the role since 1963, it can be easy to lose track of who starred in which season, so here’s all the details you need to know:\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nJust because you’re not physically located in the U.K., that doesn’t mean you can’t stream ‘Doctor Who’ on BBC iPlayer. All you need is a VPN service with British servers that can handle geoblocks, and fortunately, there are plenty of those.\n\nTo discover more movies and series to stream, head to our entertainment page and find more genre guides such as:\n\nwhere to watch ‘Shameless’ (comedy/series)\n\nwhere to watch ‘Heroes’ (sci-fi/series)\n\n‘Firefly’ TV series streaming (fantasy/series)\n\nBeware, though — some VPNs are terrible and should be avoided at all costs. For this reason, we recommend opting for a service we’ve reviewed and checked out here at Cloudwards. Did this guide help you access BBC iPlayer from outside the U.K.? What are you most looking forward to in ‘Doctor Who’ season 14? Drop us a comment below, and thanks for reading.\n\nFAQ: Stream Doctor Who\n\nYou can stream all seasons of ‘Doctor Who’ on BBC iPlayer. If you’re not in the U.K., use a VPN and connect to a British server.\n\nNo, ‘Doctor Who’ seasons 1–13 are on Max (formerly HBO Max) in the U.S.\n\nYes. The fourteenth season of ‘Doctor Who’ will arrive on Disney+ (except in the U.K.) on May 10, 2024.\n\nNo. In the U.S., ‘Doctor Who’ is on Max (seasons 1–13) and Disney+ (season 14).

That’s the only way we can improve.\n\nStay Ahead in the Digital World\n\nReceive the latest updates on cloud technology, security, and project management.\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nThis is great info… but your headline is misleading because NONE of these options are FREE. You have to pay to watch Dr. Who anywhere. Period. Which really sucks, especially for those of us NOT in the U.K. But thanks anyway for the “clickbait” lol\n\nVery nice of you to list all the modern Doctors 9-12 with complete disregard for 13 while popping straight over to 15. She was more than a cameo. Give credit where it’s earned!"
