        "text": "All Virgin Media TV customers have been issued an urgent warning over their routers. The provider, which has scores of customers up and down the country, has warned entertainment fans and telly watchers over the place they should never keep their router.\n\nVirgin Media O2’s Director of Connectivity, Gareth Lister, warned: \"Keep your WiFi Hub up high and out in the open, don’t hide it away (for example, place it next to the telly and not behind it). This allows sufficient space for the Hub to send signal around your home with less likelihood of interference.\"\n\nMr Lister went on, saying: \"Ensure all the cables from the wall to the Hub are plugged in or screwed in securely and aren’t twisted.\" The handy warning comes as England fans prepare to watch the Euro 2024 final tonight, with the Three Lions facing Spain.\n\nREAD MORE Majorca put on 'alert' with bars and restaurants given strict new rules\n\n\"Check your broadband speed around the home using Virgin Media’s free Connect App. If you benefit from a WiFi Guarantee like Virgin Media’s and you get download speeds of less than 30Mbps in any room, you can request up to three WiFi Pods to help improve your WiFi signal – and if that doesn’t do the trick, you’ll get £100 credit,\" Mr Lister said.\n\n\"If you struggle with mobile phone reception at home, use WiFi Calling to experience clear, seamless calls when connected to WiFi.\" England face Spain at 8pm in a kick off in Berlin in Germany with both BBC and ITV airing coverage of the final.\n\nSpeaking out to England fans, Mr Lister signed off by saying: \"Know what’s realistic: Maximum WiFi speed varies by device and distance from the WiFi Hub. If you’re unsure about your WiFi speed, you can use Virgin Media’s Connect App to test the speeds you’re getting to your WiFi Hub and your device.\""
