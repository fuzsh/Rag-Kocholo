        "text": "Virgin Media is the main pay-TV competitor to Sky. It offers a wide range of entertainment channels – from sports, including Premier League football matches, to the latest blockbusters from Sky Movies – as well as catch-up and on-demand TV content.\n\nCan it give Sky a run for its money? Our latest customer rating reveals how Virgin Media broadband customers rated their Virgin Media TV and broadband service on speed, reliability, TV content, customer service and value for money. Read on for our review, or use the free broadband comparison service from Which? to find the best Virgin Media TV and broadband deal for you.\n\nWhat Virgin Media TV and broadband customers told us\n\n'It’s expensive and seems like poor value for money compared to other providers that friends and family use.'\n\n'On the whole, my internet connectivity is very good and I’ve never had any problems with the TV service.'\n\nVirgin TV and broadband review\n\nCustomer score: 60% (fourth out of five). Which? members can also read our full review, including how its customers rated it for key factors such as customer service and technical support.\n\nIf you're already a member, log in now, or join Which? today.\n\nPros\n\nCons\n\nWhich? verdict\n\nVirgin Media TV, broadband and phone satisfaction survey resultsBroadband speedBroadband reliabilityTV contentValue for moneyEase of contactingCustomer serviceTechnical support\n\nDiscover which providers impressed their customers most in our latest survey – we reveal the best and worst TV and broadband providers\n\nIf you'd prefer a cheaper option without a TV service, then you can find your ideal package by comparing all the latest broadband deals.\n\nWhat TV and broadband deals does Virgin Media offer?\n\nVirgin's TV and broadband service is supplied through its cable network, so you need to live in a Virgin-cabled area to get it at home (although once you're signed up, you can also access it on the go over wi-fi – even abroad, in the EU – via Virgin's TV Go app).\n\nVirgin Media's service isn't as widely available as those that use the Openreach network, but its network is faster, offering average broadband speeds up to 1,130Mbps.\n\nYou can take out separate TV, broadband and home phone deals, or bundle them all together, either by building your own package or opting for one of Virgin's own deals. It has eight available bundles: Big, Bigger Combo, Bigger Combo + Movies, Bigger Combo + Sports, Biggest Combo and Mega Volt. These include average speeds ranging from up to 54Mbps to 1,130Mbps, and from 100 channels to 230. They usually work out cheaper than creating your own package.\n\nVirgin Media offers a similar selection of TV channels to Sky TV. You can also add the likes of Sky Movies and Sports to your Virgin Media package for a fee, although you can't watch Sky Atlantic. Find out which of these two TV and broadband behemoths is best for you using our comparison of Sky TV & broadband vs Virgin Media.\n\nIf you're not interested in pay TV and just want a phone and broadband bundle, read our Virgin Media broadband review.\n\nHow much is Virgin Media TV and broadband?\n\nVirgin Media offers a wide range of packages, with various combinations of TV and premium channels alongside its broadband service.\n\nYou can view the entire range of Virgin Media broadband packages, or enter your postcode below to check for the best deals across all providers in your area.\n\nDoes Virgin Media put up TV and broadband prices every year?\n\nYes – Virgin Media started putting up its prices every year from 2024, so if you sign up to a deal now, you'll be impacted. The price increase will apply to both the broadband and TV elements of your contract. If you decide to sign up to a Virgin Media deal, keep in mind that each spring the amount you pay will go up in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) rate of inflation as published in February, plus an additional 3.9%, meaning an increase of 8.8% in 2024.\n\nWhat equipment comes with Virgin Media TV and broadband?\n\nVirgin offers its Virgin TV 360 box to new customers. This is 4K ready and allows you to watch television in multiple rooms for an extra fee. It also allows users to set profiles, so they can designate favourite channels and carry on watching shows where they left off.\n\nIf you'd prefer a broadband-only deal, then read in-depth reviews of all the major internet service providers in our Best and worst broadband providers 2024."
