        "text": "To mark the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who, the BBC has uploaded a huge archive of classic episodes. Alongside the modern Doctor Who series and various spin-offs – from K-9 and Company to Torchwood – there are over 800 episodes on iPlayer. That’s enough Doctor Who to fill the back end of the TARDIS.\n\nConspicuous by its absence, however, is Doctor Who’s first ever story – the four-part serial, An Unearthly Child, which first aired on November 23 1963. The story is missing because of a rights dispute. The son of the story’s writer has reportedly refused the BBC a licence to include the story on iPlayer.\n\nThese are not the only episodes missing from the BBC’s archive. There are – at present – 97 episodes missing from the show’s early years. From 1967, the BBC routinely – and short-sightedly – wiped its videotapes.\n\nMost of the episodes from the First and Second Doctor – William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton – were filmed on two-inch videotape. At the time, videotape was expensive so the BBC wiped its tapes to make room for new programmes. Television was a new frontier in time and space – then unappreciated as an artform or for the historical significance of its programming. If only the BBC had a way to go back in time.\n\nThe BBC did make 16mm film copies of Doctor Who serials to sell overseas – places such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Africa. But as black and white fell out of fashion, interest in Doctor Who waned. At one point in the 1970s, the Beeb held just seven episodes from the 253 made starring Hartnell and Troughton. (Many of Third Doctor Jon Pertwee’s episodes were also binned but were thankfully recovered.)\n\nThe BBC didn’t start archiving its programmes until 1978, at which point a tenacious archivist named Sue Malden began hunting down missing episodes – a handful were held by the British Film Institute, for instance – to fill the gaps where possible.\n\nThe missing episodes have become a crucial part of Doctor Who lore. The missing stories were featured in novelisations published by Target – the mere mention of which will make Who fans of a certain age go misty eyed. And though the BBC didn’t have the foresight to hold onto its shows, some viewers recorded the audio – by literally pointing a microphone at the TV. Audio soundtracks exist for every missing episode. CD copies of these soundtracks were popular and fuelled fandom before Doctor Who’s revival in 2005. The soundtracks have also been used for animations of the lost episodes. There are also “Telesnaps” – primitive screenshots – of some missing stories. Others, however, remain universal mysteries.\n\nSince the early 1980s, almost 40 episodes of classic Doctor Who have been rediscovered – unearthed by dedicated fans, salvaged from car boot sales and rubbish tips, or returned from far-flung territories. In 2013, an archivist unearthed nine Patrick Troughton episodes in Jos, Nigeria. The question is: are there more episodes out there still waiting to be rediscovered? Here’s what’s currently missing from iPlayer’s Doctor Who archive.\n\nAn Unearthly Child (all four episodes missing)\n\nIt doesn’t get much more classic Who than the very first serial (though in all honesty, the first episode is notable – the rest are a bore). But An Unearthly Child is not featured on BBC iPlayer. Stef Anthony Coburn, son of the serial’s writer, Anthony Coburn, confirmed on Twitter/X that he had withdrawn the BBC’s licence to show the episodes. Coburn said the BBC had offered a “pittance” to re-licence them. Coburn admitted that his motivation is vengeance. He tweeted: “In 1976 the BBC without asking permission or offering payment first registered my desperately ill father’s IP as THEIR trademark before (by gross professional negligence or deliberate intent) KILLING HIM!” Coburn also tweeted “I don’t give a toss” if most fans have access to the episodes. An Unearthly Child is available to stream on BritBox, however.\n\nMarco Polo (all seven episodes missing)\n\nBroadcast in early 1964 – part of the first William Hartnell series – these are the earliest episodes to be officially missing. It was The Doctor’s first foray into actual history, as the TARDIS crew joined Marco Polo on a trek from the Himalayas to Peking. Telesnaps exist of all but one episode. There were rumours of its recovery in 2013, but the classic adventure has yet to surface.\n\nThe Reign of Terror (episodes four and five missing; all missing from iPlayer)\n\nThe Doctor lands in post-revolutionary France and avoids the guillotine. The serial, however, wasn’t so lucky back in the late 1960s, when the master tapes were up for the chop. Four episodes were recovered in the early 1980s: Episodes one and two were returned to the BBC from the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation and episodes three and six were recovered in the UK from a private collector. For some reason, the first episode is missing from iPlayer, though it has animated versions (produced in 2012) of the missing episodes.\n\nThe Crusade (episodes two and four missing)\n\nWhat should be a standout serial from the First Doctor’s second series is sullied by two missing episodes. What remains of the four-parter is magnificent though. The story guest stars Julian Glover as Richard the Lionheart. A 16mm print of the third episode was retained by the BBC, while the third episode was discovered in a New Zealand film collection in 1999. These missing episodes are the only thing missing from the second series. And there are very few telesnaps of this story.\n\nGalaxy 4 (episodes one, two and four missing; all missing from iPlayer)\n\nThis third series opener marks a depressing trend – the last full season of the Hartnell era is depressingly bereft of archived episodes. In the story, The Doctor encounters the beautiful but unpleasant Drahvins and the hideous but quite-nice-actually Rills. For many years, Galaxy 4 was a complete mystery – there were just two photographs of its aliens and a six-minute clip. The third episode, however, was returned to the BBC in 2011 by film collector Terry Burnett, who apparently bought the film – along with a Patrick Troughton episode – at a school fete near Southampton in the early 1980s. The lost episodes were revealed at the BFS’s Missing Believed Wiped event in 2011. But the iPlayer instead features the animated version, released on DVD in 2021.\n\nMission to the Unknown (one episode missing)\n\nThis is an odd entry in early Doctor Who: a one-off episode that doesn’t feature any of the TARDIS crew – not even The Doctor himself – and serves as a glorified trailer for the upcoming serial, The Daleks’ Master Plan. It’s fairly grim – the Daleks bump off all the humans. It was wiped in 1974. There’s no known existing footage.\n\nThe Myth Makers (all four episodes missing)\n\nThis story about the Fall of Troy was wiped in the late 1960s. The entire serial is still missing – a crying shame as it would be wonderful to see the recreation of Troy and the inside of the Trojan Horse (this serial also gave viewers the first glimpse – now lost in the mists of time – of the TARDIS wardrobe room). All that remains are some 8mm clips and a few photos.\n\nThe Daleks’ Master Plan (episodes one, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine, 11, 12 missing)\n\nWith its big production, Dalek action, the first death of a companion, and tons of backstage lore, this 12-episode epic is one of biggest holes in Doctor Who history – a blockbuster in early DW terms. Among the missing episodes is Who’s first Christmas Special, The Feast of Steven, which aired on Christmas Day 1965. The episode had little to do with the Daleks’ overall plan to conquer the galaxy with a Time Destructor weapon. Hartnell broke the fourth wall to announce, “A Merry Christmas to all of you at home!” There were no copies of that episode – the BBC knew it would be a tough sell overseas. It was the first episode to disappear. Episodes five and ten were recovered from the basement of a Mormon church in South London – a still-unexplained mystery – while episode two was returned in 2004 – by a former BBC engineer who rescued it from a pile of rubbish.\n\nThe Massacre (all four episodes missing)\n\nThis classy, atmospheric story is about the events leading up to the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in 1572. It’s considered something of a lost masterpiece – one of the finest serials from Doctor Who’s less-popular historical stories. It was wiped in 1967. There’s very little photographic evidence of it.\n\nThe Celestial Toymaker (episodes one, two, and three missing)\n\nThe Toymaker has remained a popular villain in Who lore, despite featuring in just one existing episode. The story is daft but sinister, as the TARDIS crew land in the Toymaker’s toy room and have to play games – such as blind man’s bluff and hopscotch – or they’ll be turned into toys themselves. The serial retained notoriety thanks to some full-colour publicity photographs. The final episode made its way back to the BBC in 1984, after an edited version was uncovered in Australia. After years on spinoff appearances, the Toymaker himself is set to return for the anniversary specials – now played by Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nThe Savages (all four episodes missing)\n\nThe entire serial is missing from the archives (though it was sold overseas, so could make a comeback in the future). It’s not an especially popular story, featuring a race of parasitic elders who transfer their minds into the bodies of savages. Plenty of moralising and political subtext but not enough monsters.\n\nThe Smugglers (all four episodes missing)\n\nA 17th-century pirate adventure with lots of double-crosses – and death – over a stash of gold. There exists some home video of the location work, plus clips that were colourised earlier this year. The clips had been cut from the Australian broadcast by censors before broadcast (it was considered particularly violent) and had to be legally retained in Australia. There have been rumours that The Smugglers will be the next classic adventure to be animated.\n\nThe Tenth Planet (episode four missing)\n\nThis four-part serial marked the final appearance (save a later cameo) of The First Doctor and the first ever regeneration (though I wasn’t called that yet). It’s also the first appearance of the Cybermen – at their most frightening because they’re at their most human. Though the fourth episode is missing, a clip of the regeneration itself – from William Hartnell into Patrick Troughton – has survived. The Australian print came back to the UK in 1975, but = Episode Four is still missing. The fourth episode was subject to a hoax in 1992, with a hoaxer promising to return a full copy of the final episode – but, unlike Patrick Troughton, it never materialised. The animated version is on iPlayer, which doesn’t feature the live action regeneration.\n\nThe Power of the Daleks (all six episodes missing)\n\nThis is the full debut of Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor and probably the Holy Grail of lost Doctor Who serials. The Second Doctor arrives at the planet Vulcan — not that planet Vulcan — where the Daleks are passive servants. Or are they? (Spoiler: they’re not). It’s one of the great Dalek stories. Some clips were unearthed from various sources, such as a BBC kids show and from Australian broadcasts. There have been rumours of its return. The iPlayer has the animated version.\n\nThe Highlanders (all four episodes missing)\n\nThis serial introduces companion Jamie, the dubiously-accented Scottish warrior (played by Frazer Hines). It was the last of the early series’ historical adventures. Producers decided to ditch historical stories in an effort (and a successful one) to boost the show’s ratings. In the story, the Doctor gets involved with the Jacobite Rebellion. It’s a shame not to have Jamie’s debut – he starred in a massive 113 episodes, making him the longest serving companion.\n\nThe Underwater Menace (episodes one and four missing)\n\nWhat remains of this four-part serial is the earliest surviving performance from Troughton. The Atlantis-set story is famously unpopular – not least of all because of its ridiculous Fish People. The second episode is the other episode picked up by Terry Burnett at a Southampton school fete then shown at the BFI in 2011. The copy came from versions shown in Australia, with small sections missing due to the Aussie censors. Scans of the missing material will be restored for a DVD release later this month.\n\nThe Moonbase (episodes one and three missing)\n\nIt’s the Cyberman’s second outing and they’ve had an upgrade, trading the stockings-over-their-heads look for metal faces. The story is known by Whovians for not being as good as the Target novelisation. Episodes 2 and 4 were retained by the BBC – the others have been animated and feature on iPlayer.\n\nThe Macra Terror (all four episodes missing)\n\nThis is truly one of the great losses of classic Doctor Who – The Doctor vs. giant crabs in a sort-of totalitarian holiday camp. We’d eventually seen the Macra in CGI form in a 2007 David Tennant story. But you can’t beat the ropey giant crab models. A hoaxer known as Rogue Cyberman caused a social media stir in 2013 after claiming that they’d sourced a VHS copy (they hadn’t). There’s a 2019 animated version on iPlayer.\n\nThe Faceless Ones (episodes two, four, five and six missing; all missing from iPlayer)\n\nThis inventive, almost Bond-like adventure features a race of Chameleon aliens who sell sinister package holidays. The third episode – along with an episode of The Evil of the Daleks – were bought by a collector at a 1983 car boot sale, then later returned to the BBC archives. A few seconds of episode 3 also exists on silent 8mm home movie footage from Australia. Disappointingly, the surviving episodes are not on iPlayer – only the animated versions.\n\nThe Evil of the Daleks (episodes one, three, four, five, six, and seven; all missing from iPlayer)\n\nThis classic serial introduced the Emperor Dalek and marks their last proper appearance for five years. At the time, Dalek creator Terry Nation was trying to launch a US Dalek series. Episode 2 – the only surviving episode – is the only complete episode to feature Troughton vs the Daleks. Once again, the BBC has put the animated version on iPlayer instead of the original.\n\nThe Abominable Snowmen (episodes one, three, four, five and six missing)\n\nA six-part epic that took the TARDIS crew to Tibet (actually some mountains in Wales) and introduced the Yeti. The story was remembered by some production photos and home video footage of the locations. It was animated in 2021 though only the extant live action second episode is currently on iPlayer. A former BBC projectionist had held onto the episode – a version made for overseas sales – which was then uncovered in 1982.\n\nThe Ice Warriors (episodes two and three)\n\nThe archetypal “base under siege” story – a staple in this period of Troughton’s tenure – introduced another second-tier (but nonetheless popular) monster race, the Ice Warriors. Actually Martians, they’re like crocodile soldiers. The existing episodes were found in a cupboard at BBC Enterprises in 1988. The iPlayer contains a mix of the surviving episodes and 2013 animations.\n\nThe Web of Fear (episode three missing)\n\nThe recovery of this story – which sees the return of the Yeti – is quite remarkable. While cataloguing for the Nigerian Television Authority in Jos, archivist Philip Morris discovered all five missing episodes from The Enemy of the World and all the missing episodes (well, almost) of The Web of Fear. Until that point, all the BBC had was the first episode of The Web of Fear. But one of the Web of Fear episodes discovered by Morris – episode three – went missing. It was presumed stolen, and passed to a private collector. (So the Who conspiracists say, at least.) An animated reconstruction of the third episode 3 was released in 2021 and features on iPlayer.\n\nFury From the Deep (all six episodes missing)\n\nThe Doctor battles some seaweed. Yes, really. Brief clips exist, taken from the Australian censors, while the animated version is available on iPlayer.\n\nThe Wheel in Space (episodes one, two, four and five missing)\n\nThere are no animations to fill in the gaps of the Cybermen classic. Only the surviving third and sixth episodes are on iPlayer. Episode six was retained by the BBC, while a 16mm print of the third episode was discovered at a Southampton film dealership in 1983.\n\nThe Invasion (episodes one and four missing)\n\nThis eight-part epic is one of the most famous serials from the Troughton era. It’s known for introducing the most iconic Cybermen design – see them marching around London tourist attractions – and UNIT. Thankfully, the majority of the story exists in its original form. All but two of the episodes were returned to the BBC in 1976. Animated versions of the missing episodes fill the gaps on iPlayer.\n\nThe Space Pirates (episodes one, three, four, five and six missing)\n\nThe Doctor gets split from the TARDIS and finds himself doing some space swashbuckling with, well, space pirates. The BBC actually retained its copy of the second episode. It was shot on film and was considered historically significant."
