        "text": "If you have Virgin Media TV beamed into your living room there’s good news. The popular provider has just announced the launch of a new service and it's something Sky can’t currently match. From today, anyone with Virgin can now access Pluto TV right from their set-top box.\n\nThis free streaming service includes a swathe of unique channels such as The Drew Barrymore Show, Baywatch, Come Dine With Me, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and 5 Cops which all show back-to-back episodes of favourite shows.\n\nThere are also sports, endless movies and cartoons broadcast throughout the day. Although Sky has plenty of apps available on its platform, Pluto TV is not one that is currently compatible so Virgin has gained one advantage over its arch rival.\n\nTo access Pluto TV’s extensive range of programming, customers simply need to head to the apps section on Virgin TV or use the voice search function on their remote. It's then a question of installing Pluto TV and launching it to view the free shows.\n\nSpeaking about the update David Bouchier, Chief TV and Entertainment Officer at Virgin Media O2, said: “Virgin TV brings together fantastic programming and popular apps that we know our customers will love. With Pluto TV now available on Virgin TV 360 and Stream, our customers can tune into even more unmissable entertainment.”\n\nAlong with Pluto TV launching on Virgin TV, the service has just had a major overhaul with over 80 channels swapping positions on the telly planner.\n\nThe changes, which come into force from midnight on July 4, include services such as ITV +1, Discovery HD, MTV and Comedy Central +1 which all get new numbers on the planner. This reboot affects all of Virgin's set-top boxes including TiVo, V6, TV360 and its Stream device.\n\nVirgin says it is making the changes to move popular general entertainment channels into more prominent numbers in the TV guide and +1 channels into a dedicated channel range between 300-399"
