        "text": "The BBC has confirmed the \"global\" version of its iPlayer on-demand service will close next month.\n\nThe corporation had charged users subscription fees to watch programmes via the app in Western Europe, Australia and Canada.\n\nHowever, it never came to the US.\n\nReports suggest, external American pay-TV operators had threatened to drop the BBC America channel if the app had launched locally because they believed it would cost them viewers.\n\nBoth BBC America and the international edition of iPlayer screen some of the corporation's best known programmes, including Doctor Who, Top Gear, Sherlock and David Attenborough's natural history documentaries.\n\nPress releases had always described the online facility as a \"pilot\" meant to provide \"consumer insights\".\n\nBBC Worldwide - the broadcaster's commercial arm - first announced it intended to pull support for the Global iPlayer app in October 2013, saying it would instead focus on making material available via the BBC.com website.\n\nThe corporation repeated the point in its annual review last July, external, but until now had not provided an exact shut-off date.\n\n\"As announced in July 2014, the service will be closing this year as planned,\" said a spokeswoman.\n\n\"The service will close on 26 June.\""
