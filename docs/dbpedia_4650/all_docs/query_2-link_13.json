        "text": "The way we watch our favourite TV has changed. Many of us catch up on shows we’ve missed through apps like BBC iPlayer. And almost half of UK homes now pay for a streaming service like Netflix. But some are better than others at making their services accessible.\n\nOfcom requirements and on-demand video streaming\n\nMost UK terrestrial channels are required by Ofcom to hit a minimum target of programmes broadcast with access services. “Access services” are accessibility features like closed captions, audio description and signing.\n\nBut this does not apply to on-demand video services like Netflix, NOW TV and Amazon Prime Video. It even excludes TV broadcasters’ own catch-up services.\n\nAbout this guide\n\nDifferent services offer different benefits for those with access needs. Use this guide to compare the most popular on-demand services and find out which ones best suit your access needs.\n\nWe look at video on-demand (‘catch-up’) services like BBC iPlayer as well as paid subscription services like Netflix. We compare their accessibility services for disabled people.\n\nWe have tried to consider a range of needs in our analysis. Our findings are based on:\n\nFeedback from our Video streaming survey of more than 3,300 disabled people.\n\nWeb accessibility audit of each streaming service, in a computer web browser.\n\nPlease note, this is not a like-for-like comparison of services. We are giving an overview to help viewers with accessibility requirements.\n\nScope’s research panel has 1,700 disabled people and parents of disabled children. This is a great way to test your products and services. Find out more about our disabled consumer research service.\n\nOverview\n\nHere’s a quick summary of what we found when looking at accessibility features and streaming services.\n\nBest for overall percentage of subtitled content:\n\nDisney Plus\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nAll 4\n\nBest for overall percentage of audio-described content:\n\nDisney Plus\n\nAll 4\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nBest for screen reader users:\n\nDisney Plus\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nBest value for money (paid subscription services):\n\nNetflix’s £5.99 per month basic package\n\nLargest range of titles available at no extra cost:\n\nNetflix\n\nFree video on-demand streaming services\n\nThe following on-demand video services, also called catch-up TV, are free to UK TV license payers.\n\nBBC iPlayer\n\nLarge offering includes nearly all live and non-live TV programmes, film, radio and music from BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, Four, CBeebies, BBC News, Parliament, Alba and S4C.\n\nThe BBC has a mixture of its own accessibility guidelines as well as accessibility features already integrated into products.\n\nGareth Ford Williams, Head of Accessibility at the BBC, says that iPlayer will be subtitling more of its audio-described content soon too, which should bring its subtitled content from 76.5% closer to 90%.\n\nPrice: Free service for all UK TV licence payers\n\nTV highlights: Doctor Who, Killing Eve, Strictly Come Dancing, Fleabag, Our Girl\n\nContent breakdown\n\nBBC is one of the best services for accessible programmes.

But there are limited access services (like audio description) available through third-party platforms.\n\nITV Hub only currently offers audio description through its Android and iOS apps. But they plan to make audio description available on browsers and connected TV platforms for 2021.\n\nPrice: Free version available. Otherwise £3.99 per month or £39.99 per year (with a seven-day free trial) to watch without adverts.\n\nTV highlights: Britain’s Got Talent, Poirot, Gemma Collins: Diva Forever, Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip\n\nContent breakdown\n\n95% of ITV Hub content is subtitled, 30% is audio-described.\n\nAdvantages\n\nLarge range of original TV content\n\nAudio description category on iOS app\n\nDisadvantages\n\nWebsite and app interface is difficult for screen readers users and keyboard navigation.

Some video streaming services allow you to watch anything from their library for a fixed monthly amount. Other services also have a rent or buy service which allows users to pay for individual TV programmes and films on top of their subscription package.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix is the UK’s most popular on-demand video streaming service. If you want the streaming service with the most TV programmes and films available, Netflix is the winner. It’s known for its large library of licensed and original content.\n\nNetflix guarantee that all its original TV series and films are subtitled (including titles like Orange is The New Black and House of Cards). But it’s unclear whether this applies to all third-party content across different platforms.\n\nThey announced they would start audio describing all their original content in 2015, though they could not come back to us with a percentage breakdown of audio-described content.\n\nPrice: Plans start from £5.99 a month and go up to £11.99 (No free trials available)\n\nAvailable on: web browser on computer, tablet or smartphone.\n\nTV highlights: Stranger Things, Orange is The New Black, The Crown and films like The Irishman.\n\nBest for: large range of content, original TV series and films.\n\nContent breakdown\n\nNetflix tells us that 100% of its content is available with subtitles.

It includes content from several Sky channels. Pricing model is based on separate ‘passes’ a user can purchase to allow them to watch different kinds of content. All Sky originals go straight to NOW TV.\n\nPrice: Plans start from £3.99 to £11.99 a month (seven-day free trial available)\n\nContent breakdown\n\nUnknown (we’ve not received a response from NOW TV).\n\nBest for: Film lovers who want blockbuster films and recent content from Sky and HBO\n\nTV highlights: The Sopranos, Sex and the City, Dexter, Chernobyl, Westworld, Modern Family, The Handmaid’s Tale.\n\nAdvantages\n\nOffers a seven-day free trial for their entertainment package\n\nLarge range of family-friendly content\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe website interface can be difficult for screen reader users and those who rely on keyboard navigation, for example, there are no ‘Skip to Content’ links on the homepage screen.\n\nText cannot be enlarged in the web browser\n\nMany programmes are removed from the service a short while after original broadcast\n\nSeveral instances of low colour contrast ratios between text and background make it hard for visually impaired users\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nAmazon introduced Prime Video to the UK in 2014, replacing video service LoveFilm. Amazon Prime video is free with any Amazon Prime subscription.\n\nPrime video has one of the largest libraries of TV series and films of any other provider, but much of this is pay-per-view (PPV) content.\n\nPrice: Free with Amazon Prime subscription at £7.99 per month.

Disney almost doubled their global subscriber numbers to 50 million, gaining more than 22 million new subscribers since the Covid-19 lockdown.\n\nThe service provides access to all of Disney’s classic animated movies as well as Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel and National Geographic content.\n\nPrice: £5.99 a month or £59.99 a year.

The service is free for Sky TV subscribers, so as long as you’re an existing customer, you have access to it. There is a combination of live and on-demand content on offer, though not all live programmes are available through Sky Go.\n\nPrice: Free with Sky subscription. Sky Go Extra is free for two months, and then costs £5 per month after and allows users to download more content and watch on more devices.\n\nTV highlights: Gangs of London, Westworld, Grey’s Anatomy, Dynamo Beyond Belief\n\nContent breakdown: Unknown (we’ve not received a response from Amazon Prime Video).\n\nAdvantages\n\nFree for Sky customers\n\nAllows up to three people to stream at the same time using the same account\n\nDisadvantages\n\nUsers can only download programmes to watch later if they sign up for a Sky Go Extra account, or have Sky Q.\n\nNot all website content can be accessed using keyboard only\n\nPoor screen reader accessibility, for example, the content does not follow a logical structure when tabbing through the menu.\n\nApple TV Plus\n\nApple’s answer to TV streaming launched in the UK in late 2019. Apple TV Plus lower monthly cost compared to other streaming services. But this is partly because of the smaller library of content users are able to choose from at the minute, with less than 50 titles available\n\nPrice: £4.99 a month (with seven-day free trial available) Users can get one year of Apple TVPlus free with the purchase of an apple device.\n\nAvailable on: iOS, Samsung smart TVs, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, LG Smart TVs, computer web browser\n\nProgramme catalogue highlights: The Morning Show, Defending Jacob\n\nContent breakdown\n\nUnknown (we’ve not received a response from Apple TV Plus).\n\nAdvantages\n\nAllows up to six people to stream at the same time using the same account\n\nGreat for original content\n\nDisadvantages\n\nVery few TV and film titles to choose from (under 50 titles)\n\nAvailable on limited devices, most of which (Smart TVs and Apple devices) are expensive to purchase\n\nBritbox\n\nLaunched in late 2019, Britbox’s unique selling point is British TV box sets. Including comedy, drama, documentary and reality TV. This service offers more British TV and film titles than any other streaming provider.\n\nDespite being one of the newest streaming services on our list, Britbox performed poorly in our accessibility audit. Basic functionality, like making sure the website is accessible with a keyboard, is missing.\n\nPrice: £5.99 per month (with 30-day free trial)\n\nTV highlights: Broadchurch, Wolf Hall, Blackadder, Only Fools and Horses, Downtown Abbey\n\nContent breakdown\n\nA total of 80% of Britbox content is subtitled. The percentage of audio-described content is unknown.\n\nAdvantages\n\n30-day free trial available\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe website and app cannot be accessed using a keyboard only\n\nPoor website and app accessibility for screen reader users, for example, the website has no ‘skip to content’ links. There is also no way for users to change their password within account settings.\n\nLimited range of TV and film titles available (less than 500 titles in total)\n\nNot available to stream through games consoles\n\nThe streaming service with the most content\n\nUsing data from JustWatch.com, Google Play has the most content available to download and watch with 24,050 titles. Amazon Prime Video closely follows with 21,317 titles available to rent. But both on-demand video services have a pay-per-view subscription model. This means while their library of content is bigger, not all titles are available with a basic subscription.\n\nIf we remove rental titles from the results, Netflix has the largest total number of film and TV titles available at no extra cost. NOW TV has the second largest library of content and Disney Plus has the third.\n\nThe exact number of titles available on each service changes daily. These figures give us an overview of library sizes, but may not reflect real-time catalogue size.\n\nNotes\n\nAll video streaming services listed are accessible through a web browser except for Apple TV Plus.\n\nMost services allow users to download film and TV programmes to watch offline. All services, unless otherwise mentioned, require users to sign up and create an account. We have tried to include a range of access needs in our analysis, but some services might not be inclusive of all needs.\n\nFurther links\n\nWatching TV guide from Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)\n\nRNIB’s Technology guide to video streaming entertainment\n\nRelated services"
