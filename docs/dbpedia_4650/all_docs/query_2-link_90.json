        "text": "I am going to cancel my TV Licence and i am making sure that i am obeying the law before cancelling and that i have no means of watching live tv or record TV and watching the BBC Iplayer\n\nSo far i have de-tuned the TV's in the house and removed the aerials, even sold my Samsung Blu ray smart player with built in recorder and tv tuner, The only thing left to do is to remove the BBC Iplayer apps which i am finding it impossible to do because it doesn't give me a option. only this i can do is to sign out of the apps, i will try and delete my BBC Account.\n\nWith the TV licencing employing Capita to go knocking on houses who don't have a licence and scaring people with letters, I want to be 100% sure that they cannot get me on anything.\n\nSome apps on smart TVs can't be deleted by the user. This level of control, or lack thereof, will have been decided by the manufacturer and perhaps the app owner has a say in it as well, such as it being a condition of the manufacture being allowed access to that app.\n\nAs I understand it - the law requiring a licence requires you to actually use the equipment for a licenced purpose. Whether you own such a device or not isn't relevant. The onus would be on them to prove such use. Although inability of the equipment to be used in this manner is an easy defence, I don't think it's a necessity.\n\nThe requirement for a license is not exclusively attached to BBC transmissions. It is NOT, as many people think, a BBC TV Licence. The exact wording from the authority reads:\n\nYou don’t need a TV Licence if you never watch or record programmes as they’re being shown on TV, on any channel, or live on an online TV service, and you never download or watch BBC programmes on iPlayer – live, catch up or on demand.\n\nThis applies to any provider or device you use, including a TV, desktop computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, games console, digital box or Blu-ray/DVD/VHS recorder.\n\nNote the words \"on any channel\"\n\nDon’t you need an account to use iPlayer now - delete that account - put the request into the BBC if need be.\n\nActually, sure I have had to sign in at some point but just checked the web version and you just get a prompt saying “do you have a licence”. You just say ”I wouldn’t use the app any way because I am not entitled to but if I accidentally opened it when I get that I say ‘NO‘ I don’t have a licence and it won’t let me continue”.\n\nIf that is the only level of protect that the BBC implement you can’t do any more.\n\nCheers,\n\nNigel\n\nThe requirement for a license is not exclusively attached to BBC transmissions.

It doesn't mean I have to have a licence.\n\nIf I don't watch or record any live broadcasts, this means any not just BBC, so no Sky or Virgin either never mind ITV and Ch4, and don't use BBC iPlayer then I don't need a TV licence.\n\nif you have a receiver, (TV), that can receive analogue (now defunct), or digital content, whether freeview, freesat or you never watch BBC you must have a licence,\n\nThis is incorrect. It is perfectly OK to have and use equipment capable of receiving/recording live television broadcasts, internet streams of currently television content being simultaneously being broadcast, and the BBC iPlayer without a licence. If you don't have a licence you just have to not actually use the equipment to watch/record live TV broadcasts or use the BBC iPlayer.\n\nIts amazing the amount of people who believe the BBC in saying you need a licence if you have a TV, However , I have made it impossible to watch live TV by de-tuning my TVs, disconnecting the aerials, Deleting BBC Iplayers where possible, So if i get a knock on the door, I know that i am OK, But i will not be answering my door to anyone in the near future due to Corona and i have No cold callers plastered on the front door."
