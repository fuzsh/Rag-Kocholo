        "text": "When Virgin River season 5 part 2 dropped on Netflix at the end of November 2023, viewers were left reeling after multiple cliffhangers. So many shocking twists affected the residents of the quaint California town, with the season 5 finale leaving fans eager to find out how the characters will deal with these events in the next season.\n\nIn season 5, fans saw Mel Monroe (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Jack Sheridan (Martin Henderson) struggle to move forward after a devastating miscarriage. While the two stuck it out in the end, they also decided to try something new in their lives by buying — and repairing — Lilly (Lynda Boyd) 's farm amid a wildfire affecting Virgin River. That's all while Vernon \"Doc\" Mullins (Tim Matheson) signs up for a medical trial that could cause him to go blind, Lizzie (Sarah Dugdale) reveals she may be pregnant with Denny Cutler (Kai Bradbury)'s baby, and drug dealer Calvin (David Cubitt) is identified as the father of Charmaine Roberts (Lauren Hammersley)'s twins.\n\nPlus, a big reveal may come back to haunt Preacher (Colin Lawrence), and Mel learns that her mother had an affair with a man from town ... who might just be her biological father. Season 5 part 2 gave us a look at the idyllic town during the holiday season, but of course there were major doozies happening for these folks over Christmas, too. The biggest shocker in the most recent set of episodes was the introduction of Mel's father, Everett Reid (John Allen Nelson).\n\nClearly, there's a lot to address in the next set of episodes. Ahead, we have everything you need to know about Virgin River season 6.\n\nWill there be a Virgin River season 6?\n\nBack in May 2023, fans of the hit Netflix drama were shocked when Deadline announced Virgin River would be back for season 6. The news came almost four months ahead of the season 5 premiere. In another article published by the outlet in August 2022, Jinny Howe, Netflix's Head of Drama Development, expressed the streamer's hopes for the show to continue beyond the upcoming season.\n\n“I think we definitely see more longevity and growth with the show,” she said at the time. “As long as the audience asks for it and shows up … the fandom is very strong and growing in many places as well — it feels like based on what we’re seeing with Season 4 and the anticipation for Season 5 that there is a lot more storytelling to offer us. It will be exciting to see which characters continue to break out and audiences crave more of; we’re paying very close attention, understanding that this is a really rich universe of characters and that people can’t seem to get enough, myself included. So I think as long as that continues to be the case — which we’re very hopeful for — you can rest assured that there will be more Virgin River.\"\n\nWhile the show didn't initially share the renewal news on social media, some of the cast members excitedly confirmed that Virgin River would go on for another season. In a video uploaded to Colin's Instagram, he expressed his gratitude toward everyone who continues to make the drama a smash hit.\n\n\"Hey y'all, just wanna share with you some exciting news,\" he said in the clip in May 2023. \"Just got word that we have been picked up for a season 6! ... Wanna thank y'all for so much love. Gonna bring some great stories your way. Oh, I'm excited!\"\n\nColin wasn't the only cast member excited to work on another season. Annette O'Toole (who portrays Hope McCrea) added an Instagram photo of a rose as her way of announcing the news. What's more, she revealed that production would begin once the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA strikes reached resolutions with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP).\n\n\"Some roses to celebrate the good news,\" she wrote in May 2023. \"#VirginRiver season 5 will air in the fall and we’re going to film season 6 as soon as the strike is settled. #WGAStrong!\"\n\nHas Virgin River season 6 started production?\n\nAfter the WGA signed a deal with the AMPTP in late September 2023, the show announced that the writers' room was officially open for business that October. In a series of selfies posted on Virgin River's Instagram, fans could see that the creatives were ecstatic to get into writing new episodes for the next installment.\n\n\"Thrilled to have our writing team back in action, diving into Season 6! 📝,\" read the official caption in October 2023.\n\nAlexandra commented on the post, congratulating the group on starting a new chapter for the show. \"❤️🙌🔥 YOU made it!!!!! We made it!!!\" she emphatically replied.\n\nMake sure you hit \"save\" at the top of this article to stay up-to-date on the latest news about Virgin River season 6.\n\nAs of February 2024, Virgin River is officially filming the brand-new season! Martin uploaded a photo on Instagram of him and Alexandra holding a clapboard on set in what looks like Mel's cabin to announce that production is underway.\n\n\"Aaaaaannnnnnndddddd …… we’re back!\" he wrote. \"Back at it in Vancouver commencing shooting for season 6 of #virginriver. That’s right folks we are at it again! Feels so good to be back in Jack’s boots making more what we hope to be riveting, romantic and racy drama for y’all. Stay tuned for more updates on set life and BTS banter …. ♥️.\"\n\nThe Virgin River Instagram account also shared the photo, with the simple caption: \"It’s official! Virgin River season 6 is back in production!\"\n\nIt turns out Martin will have more than just acting on his plate this season. In a post uploaded on the show's Instagram on April 22, it was revealed Martin will go behind the camera and direct one episode in Virgin River season 6.\n\n\"Our very own Martin Henderson is having his directorial debut this season of Virgin River! 🎥 ❤️,\" read the caption accompanying a photo of the actor holding a clapboard.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, Martin gave a sneak peek at other parts of filming Virgin River, when he went on Instagram to show a behind-the-scenes look close to wrapping up season 6. He posted a picture of him in a recording studio, with a scene of him and Alexandra (as Jack and Mel) from the upcoming installment playing in the background.\n\n\"Back in the studio making all things Virgin River just spiffy,\" he wrote on May 15. \"We are close to wrapping up season 6 and what a ride this one has been. Excited for everyone to see it. ♥️.\"\n\nIs there a release date for Virgin River season 6?\n\nSince the show is filming through late May 2024, Netflix has yet to announce a premiere date for the latest season. However, fans can expect the show to return in 2025.\n\nWho will be in the cast of Virgin River season 6?\n\nBased on the events from the season 5 finale, here's who we can expect to return for Virgin River season 6:\n\nAlexandra Breckenridge as Melinda \"Mel\" Monroe\n\nMartin Henderson as Jack Sheridan\n\nTim Matheson as Dr. Vernon \"Doc\" Mullins\n\nAnnette O'Toole as Hope McCrea\n\nColin Lawrence as John \"Preacher\" Middleton\n\nBenjamin Hollingsworth as Dan Brady\n\nSarah Dugdale as Lizzie\n\nJenny Cooper as Joey Barnes\n\nZibby Allen as Brie Sheridan\n\nMarco Grazzini as Mike Valenzuela\n\nLauren Hammersley as Charmaine Roberts\n\nMark Ghanimé as Dr. Cameron Hayek\n\nKai Bradbury as Denny Cutler\n\nTeryl Rothery as Muriel\n\nNicola Cavendish as Connie\n\nStacey Farber as Tara Anderson\n\nGwynyth Walsh as Jo Ellen\n\nChase Petriw as Christopher\n\nBarbara Pollard as Melissa Montgomery\n\nKandyse McClure as Kaia Bryant\n\nDavid Cubitt as Calvin\n\nJohn Allen Nelson as Everett Reid\n\nWhat will Virgin River season 6 be about?\n\nWhile the show is famous for not giving away all the details, we do know that there are some storylines people can look forward to in season 6.\n\nWhen showrunner Patrick Sean Smith spoke with TVLine in November 2023 about the cliffhanger between Mel and her newly discovered biological father, he teased that there's a lot more to explore with this relationship. Specifically, he mentioned how Everett's appearance might affect Mel's father figure, Doc .\n\n\"What we’re exploring in Season 6 is a sort of a paternal love triangle,\" he told the outlet in November 2023. \"Doc has always been a surrogate father to Mel, so we’ll see what happens when her actual biological father comes into her life and how that affects their relationship.\"\n\nWhat's more, the showrunner confirmed that the mysterious news Everett has to tell Mel will affect her \"personally.\"\n\nAdditionally, when Patrick spoke to Deadline in November 2023 about Everett's involvement with the other townspeople in Virgin River, he shared that the writers are working on how the new character may have played a role before Mel and Jack moved to the area.\n\n\"I liked the idea that that person might be on the fringe, but there’s still an awareness in a small town of, especially the person on the fringe and the questions and the mystery that surround who he is. And we’re also imagining that, if he was in Virgin River with Sarah when Mel was conceived, he has at least 30-plus year history with the town.\"\n\nTalk about intriguing!\n\nHow can I watch and stream Virgin River season 6?\n\nWhen the time comes for Virgin River to drop season 6 episodes, you can watch the new installments on Netflix.\n\nFor those who don't already have an account, you'll need to set up a profile ahead of time. The popular streamer does offer a number of plans folks can choose from, with the lowest starting at $6.99 per month. Once you're all set up, head on over to the show's title page on Netflix's website or on-the-go with the Netflix app.\n\nWhile we wait for the Virgin River season 6 premiere date, why not catch up on seasons 1-5 on Netflix? It's always nice to get a refresher on the storylines before diving back in for the next dose of drama."
