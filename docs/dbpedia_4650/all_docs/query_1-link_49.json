        "text": "HUNDREDS of classic Doctor Who episodes are making their way onto iPlayer in just a few days, but fans are livid as important episodes are missing.\n\nMore than 800 hours of classic era Doctor Who episodes will be available to stream on BBC iPlayer as of November 1. However, some important episodes will be missing from the impressive archive due to rights issues.\n\nThe episodes being added to the BBC’s streaming platform are coming from the classic era of the juggernaut sci-fi series, which aired between 1963 and 1989. The show’s newer episodes, which have aired from 2005 onward, are already available to watch online.\n\nHowever, there are some important episodes missing from those being added to iPlayer.\n\nThe first four episodes of William Hartnell’s era, which were titled An Unearthly Child, won’t be available. William, who died in 1975, was the First Doctor, which makes these episodes especially important for setting the scene and establishing Doctor Who lore.\n\nTaking to X, formerly Twitter, one devastated fan said: “That’s really unfortunate news.”\n\n“I must say it’d be a tragedy not to include this because it’s probably the best opening episode of any series ever!!!” a second Whovian exclaimed.\n\nA third livid fan added: “Mad that this will not include the Time Lord’s very first story.”\n\n“Why would the BBC make a proud claim to be putting all Doctor Who stories on iPlayer with extras, but the opening story that sets it all up won’t be there!?” asked another.\n\nA spokesperson for the BBC revealed the reason for the missing episodes, telling Radio Times, “we do not have the rights to those.”\n\nThis is particularly frustrating for viewers who are starting the show from scratch and those who want to rewatch Doctor Who from the beginning ahead of the BBC’s upcoming 3-part special later in November.\n\nHowever, there will be plenty of the First Doctor’s other adventures joining the streamer – beginning with the next seven-part series, which is titled The Daleks.\n\nThis move comes ahead of the BBC’s upcoming 60th anniversary Doctor Who special which will see David Tennant reprise his role as the Fourteenth Doctor alongside his former companion Donna Noble (played Catherine Tate) later in November.\n\nThe three-part special will lead into Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa taking over the role at Christmas.\n\nSpeaking about what lies ahead, showrunner Russell T Davies said: “If you thought the appearance of David Tennant was a shock, we’ve got plenty more surprises on the way!\n\n“The path to Ncuti’s Fifteenth Doctor is laden with mystery, horror, robots, puppets, danger and fun! And how is it connected to the return of the wonderful Donna Noble? How, what, why? We’re giving you a year to speculate, and then all hell lets loose!”"
