        "text": "Looking for exclusive original dramas and comedies, alongside modern and old-school British TV classics, with the biggest range of British box sets from the BBC and ITV, all delivered straight to your all-singing, all-dancing Virgin TV box? Then get ready, because BritBox is available now.\n\nBritBox is normally available for just £5.99 a month, but from Wednesday 1 June until Sunday 12 June, new BritBox customers can get the service for half price for the first three months as part of an epic summer sale. All you need to do is sign up, and you’ll get access to all this great content for just £2.99. In the words of Del Boy, “Lovely jubbly!”\n\nBritBox is available to Virgin TV customers with a V6 box, powered by TiVo®, or a Virgin TV 360 box, and a subscription to the service. Simply sign up to BritBox via their website, and you can log in on the box. Virgin TV 360 customers can get to BritBox faster than ever with super-powerful Voice Search and Control. Just say “BritBox”, or you can watch by launching BritBox from the Apps section.\n\nYou can watch everything from The Only Way Is Essex to Broadchurch, Outnumbered, First Dates and more, as Virgin Media brings you the best TV all in one place, so there’s no need to hop around. Want to know more about some of the other belters you’ll be able to enjoy on the BritBox TV app? Then feast your eyes on this little lot…\n\nWhy Didn’t They Ask Evans?\n\nThe second series of this period drama from screenplay supremo Andrew Davies (House of Cards, Vanity Fair, Colin Firth’s Pride And Prejudice), based on Jane Austen’s unfinished manuscript, comes exclusively to BritBox. Sanditon is a seaside resort on the cusp of dramatic change, and when Charlotte (Rose Williams) returns to the town she is soon thrust into a world of secrets, intrigue and possibly love.\n\nDoctor Who\n\nGet ready to fly off on this trip of a lifetime with everyone’s favourite Time Lord. If you’ve loved the modern series, take a trip back in time (and space) and revisit the original Doctors with classic Doctor Who on BritBox. Whether you’re a Tom Baker fan, or Colin Baker was your man, they’re all here.\n\nSign up to BritBox today and then log in on your Virgin TV box\n\nMurder In Provence\n\nBased on the bestseller by Anthony Horowitz, this BritBox Original is a gripping and dark mystery tale that you won’t be able to switch off. Conleth Hill (Game Of Thrones) is author Alan Conway whose editor, Susan Ryeland (Lesley Manville, Mum), can’t wait to read his latest novel. There’s just one problem: it’s missing a final chapter. Actually, there’s a bigger problem. Alan is also missing...\n\nSpitting Image\n\nThe classic satire series is back in this BritBox Original. No public figure is off-limits as they get the puppet treatment – whether it’s the sporting world, reality stars or politicians, everyone is fair game. Fabulously funny and ridiculously rude, it’ll have the rich and famous hiding behind their sofas.\n\nOnly Fools And Horses\n\nArguably the greatest British comedy of all time can be watched in its entirety on BritBox. From those early days in Nelson Mandela House right up until the final episodes, watch Del, Rodney and Grandad (and then Uncle Albert) as they wheel and deal their way to becoming millionaires. Grab a Baileys and cherryade and settle in.\n\nSign up to BritBox today and then log in on your Virgin TV box\n\nHotel Portofino"
