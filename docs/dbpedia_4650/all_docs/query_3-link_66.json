        "text": "We all enjoy a comedy cracker, a spooky scare or a hair-raising thrill – but sometimes there’s no substitute for a dose of real drama. And if that sounds like your cup of tea, then you’re in for a right treat, as some superb shows are ready for you to dive in right now; from medical marvels to period perfection. So get ready to laugh and cry, shake and shiver, cower and celebrate, with our pick of the programmes ideal for an injection of excitement this week...\n\nWILD BILL\n\nMondays @ 9pm, Virgin Media One, Virgin TV 103\n\nRob Lowe stars as a high-flying cop set to shake up a police constabulary in England – though it turns out to be his new home that does a number on him! Smart and sharp, it’s a fish-out-of-water tale with plenty of police procedural mixed in to boot; that’s what we consider to be a pretty heady cocktail! And if you’ve missed the first few episodes, you can get up to speed right now through Virgin Media Catch Up; what more could you ask for?!\n\nFULL CIRCLE\n\nSeasons 1-3 available now on Virgin Box Sets\n\nA spectacularly innovative effort show that’s as raw and riveting as it gets, this anthology series tells 11 intertwining stories. Intelligently drawn characters – and a format that refuses to stand still – make for truly compelling viewing, while the performances from an excellent cast including David Boreanez and Minka Kelly do plenty to help matters along too!\n\nPOLDARK\n\nSundays @9pm, BBC One, Virgin TV 108\n\nAidan Turner’s smouldering soldier is back – but not for long, as its been confirmed that the eight episode run starting this weekend will be the show’s last. Details of exactly what we can expect are thin on the ground (though the ten year jump of the novels on which the show is based won’t be happening), but we imagine there’ll be loads of brooding, cliffs and triangular hats; business as usual then!\n\nCODE BLACK\n\nSeasons 1-3 available now on Virgin Box Sets\n\nWith enough action to guarantee a raised heartrate, and the indomitable Marcia Gay Harden front and centre, this emergency room drama is certainly theatrical – geddit?! If high stakes and high pace is your idea of fun, then this one’s a bonafide must-see; with strong writing and an impressive ensemble cast, it’s just what the doctor ordered! OK, sorry, we’ll stop..."
