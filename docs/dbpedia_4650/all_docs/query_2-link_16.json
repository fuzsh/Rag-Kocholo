        "text": "The term 'streaming wars' has been coined to acknowledge this fierce competition between platforms. And with so much choice, and the likelihood that our favourite shows and films are spread across multiple services with each coming with its own cost, how do we begin to choose?\n\nAfter years of expertise rating and reviewing the latest films and TV shows, RadioTimes.com knows a thing or two about streaming. In this guide, you'll find everything you need to know when choosing the best streaming service for you.\n\nWe break down all the platforms available in the UK and compare their prices, features, content and more, so you can confidently decide which to sign up to.\n\nMore like this\n\nIf you're not sure what to watch, we've got you covered. Check out our guide to the best movies to watch on Disney Plus, as well as the best shows on Apple TV+.\n\nGet an extended 30-day free trial on top Amazon Prime Video channels\n\nFrom today (4th July) until 17th July, Amazon Prime members will be able to secure an extra 30-day free trial on select Prime Video channels such as Crunchyroll, MGM+, and Curzon.\n\nThese channels normally only offer a seven-day free trial, but now you'll be able to enjoy a range of new TV, film and live content well into August.\n\nIf you're not already a Prime Video users, be sure to sign-up for your 30-day free trial to claim this fantastic offer.\n\nGet Amazon Prime Video channels extended 30-day trial\n\nJump to:\n\nWhich streaming services are available in the UK?\n\nWhat is the best streaming service in the UK?\n\nBest UK streaming service comparison\n\nWhat's the history of streaming services in the UK?\n\nWhich streaming services are available in the UK?\n\nCurrently, the list of major UK streaming services includes:\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nApple TV+\n\nDisney Plus\n\nNetflix\n\nNOW\n\nITVX\n\nDAZN\n\nHayu\n\nWhat is the best streaming service in the UK?\n\nThere's no easy answer to what is the best streaming service because it really depends on what your film and TV taste is, as well as what features are most important to you, and of course, how much you're willing to pay.\n\nIf you were to simplify the above streaming services, we'd recommend they're best for:\n\nAmazon Prime Video: Large households and those on a budget\n\nDisney Plus: Families, plus fans of Disney, Marvel and Star Wars\n\nNetflix: Binge-watchers, film fans and lovers of original content\n\nHayu: Reality TV fans\n\nApple TV+: Original big-budget dramas and children's shows\n\nNOW: Recent prestige shows from Sky and HBO, plus blockbuster films on demand\n\nITVX: Binging British boxsets\n\nDAZN: Boxing fans\n\nIn terms of content, it's hard to compete with Netflix which outputs an incredible amount of original film and TV each month, on top of an impressive back catalogue. It's fair to say that with this much content, the quality can be a mixed bag, but every so often a huge word-of-mouth hit, such as Stranger Things or The Crown, will land on the service, while a few of their films have been nominated for an Academy Award, such as Roma.\n\nHowever, with Netflix losing much of their licensed back catalogue, franchise fans may be better off heading to Disney Plus. The streaming service includes the very best of Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel, and will be the only place to see many of the spin-off shows from each of those universes. The addition of Star also means there's plenty more mature content, too, like Good Trouble.\n\nNOW may be one of the more expensive options, but you get a premium service — it's the first platform you'll find most films after their cinema release, and it's the only place to find HBO shows and Sky Originals without a TV contract. The option of Hayu and Sport is an added bonus, and you can sign up for either TV shows or films without having to pay for the other.\n\nFor those on a budget, Amazon Prime Video is one of the best value streaming services out there. It has a steady stream of hit original films and shows, but also allows you to buy or rent content that's not included in the service. If you opt for the full Prime package rather than just the standalone streaming service, you get free next day delivery, plus access to Amazon Music, Prime Reading, Amazon Photos, exclusive deals and gaming benefits.\n\nApple TV+ is another great budget option. It had some teething problems with a star-studded but sparse library at first, but their catalogue has steadily grown.\n\nAnd, it's also worth mentioning again that these aren't the only streaming services on offer. For those after sport, you've also got DAZN.\n\nRead on for more detail on each streaming provider. Or, if you're ready to commit, here's how to sign up:\n\nSign up to Amazon Prime Video\n\nSign up to Apple TV+\n\nSign up to Disney Plus\n\nSign up to Netflix\n\nSign up to NOW\n\nSign up to ITVX\n\nSign up to DAZN\n\nSign up to Hayu\n\nLooking for some subscription savings? Take a look at our pick of the best Disney Plus offers, Sky Sports offers, NOW TV offers, and BT Sport deals.\n\nBest UK streaming service comparison\n\nWhile all five are streaming services require paid subscriptions, each platform can vary considerably in terms of price, free trials, amongst other things. Streaming services will only allow you to stream on a certain number of devices at once; families, in particular, will want to take note of the maximum number of screens the service will support simultaneously.\n\nBelow, you'll find more information on each key streaming service.\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nPrice: £8.99 a month or £95 for a full year\n\nDevices to use: Smart TVs, blu-ray players, set-top boxes (Roku, Google TV, TiVo, Nvidia Shield), Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, game consoles, Android devices (Prime Video app for Android phones and tablets), iOS devices, Fire phone and Fire tablets\n\nBest for: Large households, those on a budget\n\nFree trial: Yes\n\nMaximum Resolution: 4K\n\nSimultaneous streams: 3\n\nAmazon introduced Prime Video to the UK back in 2014, replacing its previous video-on-demand service LoveFilm. Since then it has added a host of original and non-original content to its library.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat value subscription with benefits\n\nGood range of original content and classic titles\n\nLive sport\n\nOption to add Amazon Channels\n\nOption to purchase content not included in Prime\n\n4K Resolution at no extra cost\n\nCons:\n\nNot always clear which content requires an additional fee\n\nOriginal film library is lacking\n\nWhat is Amazon Prime Video good for?\n\nFor a long time, Amazon Prime Video has been Netflix’s closest competitor as the two platforms offer a similar service, with both boasting a good range of original and third-party content across film and TV.\n\nOne of the biggest bonuses of Amazon Prime Video – and something that makes it stand out from Netflix – is that the subscription comes with added Amazon benefits, such as unlimited one-day delivery on products ordered from the Amazon store. So if you’re a frequent Amazon shopper, this is a fantastic perk.\n\nPrime has also been pushing its sports coverage; it's the place to watch most tournaments on the ATP tennis circuit, and it shows Premier League football over the Christmas period.\n\nAnother advantage Amazon has over Netflix is that it offers users the chance to rent or buy films and TV shows that are not included with a subscription. This also includes add-on subscriptions — users can subscribe to Amazon Prime Channels such as StarzPlay and Hayu for an additional monthly fee, and access those platforms' shows through the Prime Video interface.\n\nOne thing that can sometimes frustrate Amazon users is that not all video content on the service comes under the subscription price, with some additional shows only available at an extra cost. However, Amazon has since added a 'Free to Me' section, making it clearer which shows and films are available for no added cost.\n\nAmazon also offers a range of streaming devices, which our Technology experts have put through their paces:\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube review\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick review\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick Lite review\n\nWhat original content does Amazon Prime Video include?\n\nSome of the best Amazon Prime series include the award-winning Homecoming and The Marvellous Mrs Maisel. The channel is home to motoring show The Grand Tour – which features Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, as well as their individual spin-offs, such as Clarkson's Farm. Other Amazon originals include Good Omens (co-produced with the BBC) and Nine Perfect Strangers.\n\nLike Netflix, Amazon has also shifted some of its focus towards film, and these are the best movies on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon also bought the rights to several high-profile films during the pandemic, including The Tomorrow War, Without Remorse and Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.\n\nWhat non-original content does Amazon Prime Video include?\n\nAmazon’s catalogue of classic TV shows is impressive, with highly regarded shows including The Walking Dead and Vikings, and classics like The X-Files. Its films library is equally commendable – with both recent hits and classics available with a subscription, including every James Bond film right through to No Time To Die. The streaming service has also brought shows such as Mr Robot and American Gods to a UK audience.\n\nAmazon has also partnered with film studio Lionsgate. This deal means the streaming service has exclusive first window streaming rights in the UK for films such as The Courier, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, Wrath of Man and The Father. As Lionsgate was previously partnered with rival Netflix, this contract represents a huge coup for Amazon.\n\nIs Amazon Prime Video good for families?\n\nThere’s a reasonable selection of kids' movies on Prime Video, such as Encanto, Luca and Sing 2. Amazon also produces a range of original children’s programming, including Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny and Lost in Oz, and is the home of Hotel Transylvania: Transformania.\n\nTop shows to watch on Amazon Prime:\n\nAmerican Gods, The Man in the High Castle, The Marvellous Mrs Maisel, Good Omens, The Romanoffs, Mr Robot, Outlander, The Grand Tour, Nine Perfect Strangers, Clarkson's Farm, Modern Love, Star Trek: Picard, Reacher, The Last of Us.\n\nTop films to watch on Amazon Prime:\n\nFight Club, Manchester by the Sea, The Tomorrow War, Red, White and Royal Blue, Palm Springs, The Sound of Metal, Spencer, No Time To Die, Shotgun Wedding, The Green Knight.\n\nPrice and subscription details:\n\nAn Amazon Prime membership – which includes not just video but also music, free delivery and a range of other benefits – costs £8.99 a month, or you can save if you pay for an entire year’s membership at once at £95 all in.\n\nIs a free trial available for Amazon Prime Video?\n\nYes – Amazon still offers new users a 30-day free trial.\n\nPlus, for a limited time only (until 17th July) Amazon Prime members will be able to secure an extra 30-day free trial on select Prime Video channels. That includes the likes of Crunchyroll, MGM+, Curzon and more. Plus, you can also get three months of Paramount+ for the price of one – so £6.99.\n\nGet Amazon Prime Video channels extended 30-day trial\n\nFor more on this Amazon Prime Video deal take a look at our guide.\n\nRadioTimes.com says:\n\nAmazon Prime offers the best value of any streaming service out there due to all the extra consumer-friendly features - but its streaming service stands on its own due to a number of award-winning shows, a film selection that is steadily improving and the unique ability to purchase content not included in Prime.\n\nStart your free 30-day Amazon Prime Video trial\n\nSee how Amazon Music fares against Spotify in our Amazon Music vs Spotify guide.\n\nFor even more on Amazon, take a look at our what is an Amazon Fire TV Stick? guide.\n\nApple TV+\n\nPrice: £8.99 a month\n\nDevices to use: iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, Amazon Fire TV, Roku and some new sets from Samsung, LG, Vizio, and Sony\n\nBest for: Brand new original big-budget dramas, children's shows\n\nFree trial: Yes\n\nMaximum resolution: 4K\n\nSimultaneous streams: 6\n\nApple created quite a fanfare with the launch of its much-anticipated new streaming service in November 2019, with a whole host of Hollywood stars ushering in the new platform.\n\nPros:\n\nAffordable price\n\nStar-studded original content\n\nGreat children's library\n\n4K resolution and six simultaneous streams at no extra cost\n\nThree months free with an Apple device purchase\n\nCons:\n\nSmall but growing library\n\nShort (one week) free trial\n\nWhat is Apple TV+ good for?\n\nApple TV+ has gone for quality over quantity, focusing on star-studded big-budget originals with exceptional production values rather than acquiring a back catalogue of older shows.\n\nThe best TV shows on Apple TV+ include a mixture of hard-hitting dramas, experimental comedies and a growing range of documentaries, almost always with a household name attached either in front of or behind the camera.\n\nThe best movies on Apple TV+ tend to be more adult-oriented dramas, again with huge names such as Tom Hanks and Bill Murray attached. Other offerings include a Billie Eilish documentary and a Meghan Markle-narrated nature documentary.\n\nSpeaking of Billie Eilish, here's how to secure Billie Eilish tickets for her UK tour.\n\nWhat original content does Apple TV+ include?\n\nAmongst the raft of originals that launched with the platform are See, a Jason Momoa vehicle set in a world where humankind has lost the ability to see, and The Morning Show, a #MeToo focused drama that stars Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell, although critical reviews have been mixed.\n\nHowever, a whole host of shows have launched since, with Jason Sudeikis's football comedy Ted Lasso arguably becoming the service's flagship series. Mythic Quest, Schmigadoon! and Slow Horses have become other TV highlights, while film offerings include Tom Hanks's return to World War II in Greyhound and Bill Murray teaming-up with Sofia Coppola in On The Rocks.\n\nSteven Spielberg is on board also helming a reboot of Amazing Stories, while Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry have worked together on mental health documentary The Me You Can’t See.\n\nApple became the first streaming service to win the Best Picture Oscar for heart-warming indie drama CODA, and has found success on the TV side with Ben Stiller's workplace thriller Severance and starry anthology Roar.\n\nWhat non-original content does Apple TV+ include?\n\nThe Apple TV app gives you access to UK streaming services including BBC iPlayer, All4 and ITVX, plus a dedicated kids’ section. The service also includes Apple TV Channels – which acts as a gateway to content from networks such as HBO, Showtime and Starz.\n\nHowever, there is little non-original content. Apple has since started licensing older content, buying the rights to children's series Fraggle Rock and the Peanuts franchise.\n\nIs Apple TV+ good for families?\n\nIn addition to the above acquisitions, Apple has also developed a small but growing library of charming children's fare, including a Sesame Street spin-off called Helpsters, cartoon Snoopy in Space, and a remake of 90’s kids show Ghostwriter.\n\nTop shows to watch on Apple TV+:\n\nSee, The Morning Show, Dickinson, The Mosquito Coast, The Elephant Queen, Helpsters, Ghostwriter, Oprah’s Book Club, For All Mankind, Ted Lasso, Slow Horses, Severance, Roar.\n\nPrice and subscription details:\n\nA subscription currently costs £8.99 a month – putting it on the cheaper end of the streaming spectrum. If you don’t currently have a compatible device (this includes most Apple products and many Smart TVs which feature the Apple TV+ app) you could buy the Apple TV HD box for £149 or take the cheaper option and purchase a streaming stick such as Roku or Amazon’s Fire TV Stick, which plug into your TV.\n\nBuy the Apple TV HD box from £149 at Apple\n\nIs a free trial available for Apple TV+?\n\nYes – any new user can sign up for a seven-day free trial.\n\nRadioTimes.com says:\n\nApple TV+ was always tempting by offering the work of A-List talent at a competitive price - and it's finally starting to realise its potential by filling up its library and producing quality content that is permeating pop culture.\n\nSign-up for a seven-day free trial at Apple TV+\n\nHere's how to watch Apple TV+ on a smart TV and the best Apple Music offers for this month. Also, check out how the music streaming service fared against Spotify in our Apple Music vs Spotify guide.\n\nDisney Plus\n\nPrice: Standard with Ads plan: £4.99 a month, Standard plan: £7.99 a month or £79.90 for a year, Premium plan: £10.99 a month or £109.90 for a year\n\nDevices to use: Amazon Fire TV and Fire tablets, Android devices and Android-based Sony Smart TVs, Apple TV, Google Chromecast and Chromebooks, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV LG devices, PlayStation 4/5, Roku, Samsung devices, Xbox One and Xbox Series S/X\n\nBest for: Families, as well as fans of Disney, Marvel and Star Wars\n\nFree trial: No\n\nMaximum Resolution: 4K\n\nSimultaneous streams: 4 with Premium, 2 with Standard and Standard with Ads\n\nDisney Plus only launched in March 2020, but it's safe to say it has made a pretty significant impact in the streaming landscape. As well as a valuable back catalogue, boasting Disney classics and over 700 episodes of The Simpsons, the service has huge TV hits based on the Star Wars and Marvel franchises.\n\nPros:\n\nIdeal for children and family\n\nHuge franchise films and shows\n\nGrowing adult-oriented library with Star\n\n4k resolution and four simultaneous streams at no extra cost\n\nCons:\n\nNo free trial\n\nWhat is Disney Plus good for?\n\nIt has a huge archive of animated classics, alongside everything Marvel and Star Wars.\n\nWhat new content does Disney Plus include?\n\nSome of the best series on Disney Plus include spin-off shows and mega franchises like Star Wars and Marvel, with The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Moon Knight and Loki dominating pop culture during their release.\n\nHowever, Disney's other franchises have made an appearance, too. The best movies on Disney Plus include the new live action The Little Mermaid and Pixar offerings Luca and Turning Red, which debuted exclusively on the service, while classic franchises such as The Mighty Ducks and Turner & Hooch have received reboots.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the streaming service introduced Disney Plus Premier Access, allowing users to purchase new cinema releases such as Black Widow for £19.99.\n\nIn February 2021, Disney Plus added a new section called Star, which featured more mature content from other Disney-owned properties, including the Oscar-winning Nomadland and new episodes of The Walking Dead.\n\nPlus, Swifties will be thrilled to hear that Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is now available on the streaming service, as well as other highly-anticipated content like Shōgun and The Creator.\n\nWhat existing original content does Disney Plus include?\n\nIf it’s Disney, it’s probably there! Take a look at the A-Z of shows and films on Disney Plus guide for content available on the service.\n\nIs Disney Plus good for families?\n\nThere’s not a brand more synonymous with family entertainment than Disney, so the answer to this one is a resounding 'yes'.\n\nDisney Plus has since introduced Star, a section that houses more adult-oriented content. Parental controls have also been implemented, keeping all inappropriate content neatly locked away behind that one segment if needed.\n\nTop Disney Plus original shows to watch:\n\nThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier, The World According to Jeff Goldblum, WandaVision, Marvel’s What If…?, Toy Story: Forky Asks a Question, Muppets Now, The Mandalorian, Love, Victor, Loki, Moon Knight, Pam & Tommy, Ahsoka, Percy Jackson and the Olympians.\n\nRead more: Meet the cast of Marvel's Moon Knight on Disney Plus.\n\nTop films to watch on Disney Plus:\n\nAvengers: Endgame, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3, Mary Poppins, The Muppets, The Parent Trap, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, The Jungle Book, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Hamilton, Luca, Nomadland, Death on the Nile, The King's Man, Eternals.\n\nBrowse the best movies on Disney Plus.\n\nPrice and subscription details:\n\nThe price of Disney Plus depends on the plan you opt for.

If you're shopping for a present for a loved one, a Disney Plus gift card could be just the ticket. Plus, make sure that you know how to watch Disney Plus on a smart TV.\n\nIf you're still not convinced, check out out answer to the question is Disney Plus worth it?\n\nNetflix\n\nPrice: £4.99 (with adverts), £7.99 (for one device), £10.99 (Standard), £15.99 (Premium)\n\nDevices to use: Gaming consoles, DVD and Blu-ray players, Smart TVs, set-top boxes, streaming sticks, home theatre systems and mobile phones and tablets\n\nBest for: Binge-watchers, film fans and lovers of original content\n\nFree trial: No\n\nMaximum Resolution: 4K (Premium), HD (Standard), SD (Basic)\n\nSimultaneous streams: 4 (Premium), 2 (Standard), 1 (Basic)\n\nDespite the ever-increasing competition, Netflix remains the giant of the streaming industry. The service is something of a trail-blazer in the world of streaming and has over 15 million subscribers in the UK.\n\nPros:\n\nHuge amount of original content\n\nHosts shows, such as Squid Game and Stranger Things, that have become worldwide phenomenon\n\nImpressive original film library including Oscar nominees\n\nHigh budgets and production values\n\nStrong non-original content\n\nRelease model is ideal for bingers\n\nCons:\n\nExtra cost for 4K and simultaneous streams\n\nReputation for cancelling shows\n\nPrice is creeping up\n\nNo free trial\n\nWhat’s Netflix good for?\n\nNetflix produces a wealth of original content, while a significant catalogue of non-original TV shows and films pads out the platform’s library.\n\nSome of the best series on Netflix such as Bridgerton, Bojack Horseman and Stranger Things have proved their worth over a number of series, while the service has also been putting an increasing focus on its film output in recent times. After enticing directors such as Martin Scorsese and David Fincher to work for the streamer, the platform has also made quite a stir at the Oscars as some of the best movies on Netflix such as The Power of the Dog and Don't Look Up scored multiple nominations.\n\nOne criticism is that Netflix has been known to prematurely cancel shows – with fan-favourite shows such as Daredevil, Anne With an E and The OA cancelled ahead of their time despite positive reviews.\n\nAre you a Stranger Things fan? Check out the best immersive experiences, including a Stranger Things immersive experience.\n\nWhat original content does Netflix include?\n\nNetflix produces an astronomical amount of original content – ranging from drama series to reality shows to documentaries; in 2021 alone, the platform released a new original film every week. The service has also picked up series such as Black Mirror and Cobra Kai, which were previously produced by third parties.\n\nWhat non-original content does Netflix include?\n\nAs things stand, Netflix has a substantial library of non-original films and TV. However, as more streaming services emerge, it's losing some of this content, with Disney content relocating to Disney Plus, and several BBC programmes moving to ITVX.\n\nStill, a decent amount of TV shows and films remain. Netflix continues to be the UK home of 21st century classics such as Breaking Bad, How To Get Away With Murder, and Homeland.\n\nIs Netflix good for families?\n\nYes! One of many things in Netflix’s favour is that users are easily able to switch their account to the children’s setting, which includes a long list of kid-friendly programmes and films.\n\nTop shows to watch on Netflix:\n\nBojack Horseman, Orange is the New Black, GLOW, The Crown, Stranger Things, Mindhunter, Bridgerton, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Queer Eye, Wednesday, Dark, Friends, The Office US, Anatomy of a Scandal, Squid Game, Sex Education.\n\nRead our guide to the best series on Netflix.\n\nTop films to watch on Netflix:\n\nRoma, Private Life, To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, Jaws, Shrek, Extraction, Hot Fuzz, His House, Easy Rider, The Power of the Dog, Joker, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget.\n\nRead our guide to the best movies on Netflix.\n\nPrice and subscription details:\n\nA number of different subscriptions are available, with the most basic starting at £4.99 a month – this gets you access to all of the platform’s content but is limited to one screen at a time per account, and includes adverts.

It is worth noting, however, that this content does not stay on the platform indefinitely; much like BBC iPlayer, shows are removed from the service a short while after broadcasting, though usually return eventually as a box set.\n\nThe platform is also home to an impressive back catalogue of classic shows, such as The Sopranos, Sex and the City and Dexter, so when combined with the excellent and constantly updated selection of films, the NOW TV catalogue is pretty formidable.\n\nIs NOW good for families?\n\nNOW previously had a separate Kids pass, but now children's shows are now included as part of the Entertainment Pass for no extra charge.

The price for the streaming service is pretty competitive, and you can sign-up to Netflix from £4.99 a month.\n\nThen known as NOW TV, NOW joined the streaming wars relatively early in 2012 and offered Sky's extensive library of films, TV shows and sports coverage to those without a pay-TV subscription.\n\nFollowing the retail giant's purchase of LoveFilm, Amazon Prime Video launched in the UK in 2014 as part of the site's Prime subscription. Amazon's streaming service is also one of the few to offer a free 30-day trial.\n\nApple was the next technology titan to get in on the streaming action, launching their own service Apple TV+ in November 2019 with original shows fronted by the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Jason Momoa. Apple TV+ also offers a free trial, although it's only seven days.\n\nOne of the newest streaming services is Disney Plus, which launched in the UK in March 2020 with the studio's iconic back catalogue and the very first live-action Star Wars show The Mandalorian. Now with the addition of new Disney Plus Star shows, the streaming service is available on a range of price plans which start from £4.99 a month.\n\nYou've likely heard of other major streaming services, such as Hulu, HBO Max and Peacock, however, those platforms are not available in the UK and are instead based in the US.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other niche streaming services popping up including DAZN, where you'll find a lot of boxing matches available, and Hayu, the home of most reality TV shows. In terms of cost, signing up to DAZN is £7.99 a month, while Hayu costs £4.99 but there is a one-month free trial.\n\nSee what else is on with our TV Guide, or for more on streaming, check out our guide to the best streaming devices, What is Sky Glass explainer and can I get Disney Plus on BT?"
