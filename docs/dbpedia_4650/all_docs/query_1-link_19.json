        "text": "This means classic episodes of the sci-fi juggernaut will be available to watch ahead of the three 60th anniversary specials. Though exact broadcast dates are yet to be announced, the BBC confirmed they will air at some point next month.\n\nEvery episode of programming will boast multiple accessibility options, including subtitles, audio description and sign language.\n\nAs well as Doctor Who, episodes from spin-offs The Sarah Jane Adventures, Torchwood and Class will be available. Every episode of Doctor Who Confidential – the behind-the-scenes show broadcast on BBC Three – is also coming to iPlayer.\n\nSome of the Doctor Who stories included are the First Doctor’s original foray with the Daleks and the Fourth Doctor serials The Brain of Morbius and The City of Death.\n\nAlso scheduled for 1 November is the launch of an online archive at bbc.co.uk/doctorwho. 60 interviews, documents, audio clips and photos will be used to tell the story of the show at its 60th anniversary, before the archive is expanded.\n\n“I’d like to thank the BBC for all the hard work, to get this massive back catalogue under one roof, at long last,” said Russell T Davies, the series showrunner. “I'm so excited for new viewers – imagine being 8 years old, spending winter afternoons exploring the 60s, 70s, 80s and beyond. And we’re determined this won't be a dusty museum – we have exciting plans to bring the back catalogue to life, with much more to be revealed!”\n\nThe episodes and online archive are coming to iPlayer on Wednesday 1 November."
