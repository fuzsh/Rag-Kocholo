        "text": "So, we've just seen that when you watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor, you will get more surprises than you'll expect. So as we say goodbye to Jodie Whittaker, in a special that will be \"a massive roller coaster\" by her own words, expect another doctor you didn't see coming.\n\nYes, now that Series 13 is long since over, the third and final special of the year is about to air. And while some surprises are in story, we've just learned that this special does not offer the first look at the new Doctor Who, Ncuti Gatwa. The Sex Education star is the first Black man and person of color to play the role (he succeeds Jodie Whittaker, the first woman to be The Doctor).\n\nBut since the Fourteenth Doctor's appearance is far from confirmed, let's talk about what we should expect. Sacha Dhawan, the new Master introduced in Series 12, is slated to appear, and will be the antagonist â€” as confirmed by the below trailer.\n\nThe Master, with the Daleks and the Cybermen, will look to wipe The Doctor's existence from the world in this special. And the event will include the defacing of iconic paintings (too soon?), a bullet train under attack and something involving Rasputin and Tsar Nicholas in 1916 Russia.\n\nSpecial appearances from previous companions Ace (Sophie Aldred) and Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) are already announced. Here's everything you need to watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor, including the trailer:\n\nOh, and in a bit of big Doctor news, the next Doctor Who seasons will be exclusive to Disney Plus.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor online from anywhere on Earth\n\nJust because BBC and BBC America aren't available everywhere doesn't mean you can't watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor if you're away from home. Watching along with the rest of the internet can be easy these days. With the right VPN (virtual private network), you can stream the show from wherever you go.\n\nNot sure which VPN is the right one for you? We've tested many different services and our pick for the best VPN overall is ExpressVPN, which offers superb speeds and excellent customer service.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who Centenary Special in the US\n\nBBC America, thankfully, is airing Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor on the same day as it hits TVs in the U.K., just slightly later because of prime time and all. That means you can watch it on two of the best streaming services, Sling TV and fuboTV.\n\nOf course, those visiting the U.S. who want to watch it live with our friends in the U.K. will need a VPN service such as ExpressVPN to log in back home to use BBC iPlayer.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor online in the UK\n\nYou can watch the Doctor Who Centenary Special in the UK on BBC iPlayer. It's totally free to view; you'll need to register, but there's no cost.\n\nIt arrives on Sunday (Oct. 23) at 7.30 p.m. BST on BBC1 and BBC iPlayer.\n\nCan you watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor in Canada or Australia?\n\nCrave has been the home for Doctor Who in Canada, but it's unclear if you'll be able to watch The Power of the Doctor on that service. No release date seems to be announced.\n\nOf course, those on vacation in Canada who stream live with their friends in the U.S. or U.K. will need a VPN service such as ExpressVPN to log in back home to use Sling, fubo or BBC iPlayer.\n\nCan you watch Doctor Who: The Power of the Doctor in Australia?\n\niView has been the home for Doctor Who down under, but it's unclear if you'll be able to watch The Power of the Doctor on that service. No release date seems to be announced.\n\nOf course, those on vacation in Australia who stream live with their friends in the U.S. or U.K. will need a VPN service such as ExpressVPN to log in back home to use Sling, fubo or BBC iPlayer."
