        "text": "Virgin Media has announced that music streaming service Spotify is now available with its mobile and broadband services, while an exclusive Spotify app is coming to TiVo.\n\nFollowing the announcement of a partnership deal with Spotify in the summer, the cable operator today started offering its broadband and mobile customers a variety of deals for the music service.\n\nNew or re-contracting customers taking one of Virgin's fibre broadband packages will be able access Spotify Premium - a subscription service streaming millions of singles and albums without advertising - for free for six months, representing a saving of nearly Â£60.\n\nAs part of the tie-up, there will also be a new 'VM Music' tab introduced to Spotify giving cable customers access to exclusive content, although there have been no further details on this.\n\nAny Virgin Media broadband customers taking a new pay monthly Virgin Mobile contract will get a three-month Spotify Premium subscription for free. They will also be able to stream or download music from Spotify during the period without eating into their mobile data allowance.\n\nFollowing the expiry of the free offer period, Virgin customers will be able to subscribe to Spotify Premium through Virgin Media, or switch to Spotify's ad-supported Free6 service.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Virgin will also launch a new Spotify app for its digital TV service powered by TiVo, allowing Spotify Premium customers to listen to their music through the TV, or home cinema sound system.\n\nVirgin Media's executive director of digital entertainment Cindy Rose said that the launch of Spotify on Virgin Media is a \"significant milestone\" for digital entertainment.\n\n\"Great digital services are no longer just about fast broadband or the latest TV technology, but increasingly about how people use their services to power and excite their daily lives,\" she said.\n\n\"Bringing together Virgin Media services with brilliant entertainment such as Spotify is a core part of our ongoing strategy and we're excited to be able to lead the way with such a great partnership.\"\n\nSpotify's global head of telecom business development Andreas Liffgarden added: \"We are thrilled to be partnering with Virgin Media to offer music fans access to one of the biggest music libraries in the world at their fingertips, through broadband, mobile and - for the first time - TiVo.\n\n\"Telecoms companies moving into the music space increases revenue streams to the music industry and provides benefits for fans and artists alike.\"\n\nVirgin Media announced plans to launch its own music streaming service back in summer 2009, but ultimately got bogged down in negotiations with the major labels.\n\nInstead, the company turned to a partnership with Spotify, as the Anglo-Swedish firm already has existing relationships with the labels and a maturing global operation.\n\nThe cable operator said that it would be revealing additional offers for bundling Spotify with its services \"in due course\"."
