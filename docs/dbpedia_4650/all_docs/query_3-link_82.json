        "text": "Also hdmi setting if it’s on. Automatic or 4 k you can’t zoom the picture it’s greyed out on my Sony a8 I have to switch it to 1080i or 1080p which is the best setting please. I only zoom the breakfast tv logos out of the screen to prevent burn in on my oled as I had that happen before.\n\nThe 360 box and or the Horizon software has no option to allow the box to output video at it native resolution. You'd have to set the output to 2160p in order to watch 4K UHD content at its native resolution, but this will also result in any content of a lower resolution also being scaled up to 2160p. If you set the output to 1080i then you'll get HD channels at their native resolution, but UHD channels and content will be scaled down from 2160p to 1080i.\n\nIf wanting to output whatever you are watching on whatever channel you are watching at its native resolution then you'd need the V6 box and the TiVo software.\n\nOk thanks I’ll just have to alter the settings each time then not that there’s much 4K on there. At the minute it’s set to 1080p to allow the zoom feature.\n\nI'd suggest you use the 1080i option as opposed to the progressive option. None of the HD channels you can access via Virgin Media are 1080p and all of them are 1080i. Your TV is more than likely better at deinterlacing the video than the Virgin STB you are using?\n\nThe only native progressive sources are those associated with streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon and the UHD 4K channels.\n\nOk I’ll switch it back then later to 1080i.\n\nI use the Sony inbuilt apps for Netflix and Amazon. Is there anything to increase the sound from the boxes noticeably quieter than the free view from the in built tuner and apps ?.\n\nThe audio or sound output configuration will basically depend upon what you are outputting to? You only really get 2 options and can either set the box to output Dolby Digital if and when present or set it to the PCM option. The latter results in instances where the audio may have been native 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital being mixed down and output as just 2 channel stereo PCM. THis option should be selected if the device you are outputting to hasn't the ability to handle or portray Dolby Digital encoded audio. If you select the Dolby Digital option then audio will be output in its native format. A lot of HD and or UHD channels encode their audio using Dolby Digital, both 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo. SD channels would still be encoded with 2 channel PCM though and this would still be output in association with those channels.\n\nEven if you've not an AV receiver or a soundbar, you may still be better served by the Dolby Digital option? Many TV now include the ablity to handle, decode and even portray Dolby Digital even if 5.1 in nature.\n\nStreaming services such as Netflix or Amazon primarilly use DD+ and Atmos metdata can be packaged with this. If you select the Dolby Digital setting then you'd get DD+ and Atmos via these services if and when available.\n\nI’m sure my v6 box let me watch itv news then switch to bbc need to watch the headlines of both but not on this software.\n\nI've still got V6 TiVo software and just tried this and you cannot rewind beyond the point from when you open a channel. If you stay on the channel, it caches and you can rewind to the point where you opened it, but as soon as you change channels the same situation applies.\n\nThanks for the replies.\n\nIf I watch by sports ultimate I would need to change the hdmi to 4 k then to get the best picture?.\n\nIn order to output UHD content and channels at their native resolution then you'd have no option other than to set the box's video output to the 4K 2160p option. Set it to anything other than this and native 4K content would be scaled down to the resolution associated with the setting you'd set the output to.\n\nYou will not get 4K if 4K 2160p isn't set as the output resolution. If outputting to a UHD 4K TV then the TV will have to scale up lower resolutions in order for the image to fill the TV's panel.\n\nThe box determines its autput setting by reading the EDID onboard the TV if you use the AUTO option. THis option simply results in the box setting its output to the highest resolution the TV can handle.\n\nThe resolutions of the channels you are viewing have no influence upon what is output. THe setting will simply result in lower resolution channels being scaled up to the setting associated with the audio output setrtring.\n\nIf the box is set to 2160p then BBC 1 HD will be output at 2160p and not at its native 1080i.\n\nThe AUTO setting doesn't set the ioutput to the native resolkution of the content and or channel you are watching and sets it to the highest resoolution up to 2160p that your TV can handle. If the TV were an HD model then this would result in the box being automatically set to 1080p and if a 4K UHD model then the box will automatically output everything at 2160p.\n\nThe setting is not dynamic and stays set to whatever setting it was set to by either you or in accordance with the AUTO option and the detected capabilities of your TV."
