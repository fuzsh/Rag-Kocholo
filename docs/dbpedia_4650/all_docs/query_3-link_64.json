        "text": "Christmas is hard enough without sifting through Christmas TV guides trying to find something to watch. Wouldn’t it be great if someone had done that for you, found the best Christmas TV for 2023 and collected it all in one place? Look no further. From the Christmas specials popping up in mid-December to Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day themselves, Virgin TV have you covered.\n\nDiscover what Christmas specials you can watch and when they’re on with our Christmas TV guide. We’ve got best Christmas TV across BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky Max and more, handily broken down into Drama, Comedy, Family, Entertainment and Documentaries.\n\nYou also don’t need to battle for the remote this Christmas. Thanks to the Virgin TV Go app, you can register on up to 5 devices and view on 2 devices simultaneously at no extra cost. You can access more than 100 live TV channels on the go from your devices, including your iPhone, iPad, Android mobile or tablet, and PC/Mac.\n\nBookmark our Christmas TV listings page for updates from now until the festive season.\n\nSkip to:\n\nDrama\n\nComedy\n\nFamily\n\nEntertainment\n\nDocumentaries\n\nLorna Watson is back as TV’s favourite Vespa-driving, crime-solving nun for a feature-length Christmas special of the brilliant Father Brown spin-off. In a sort of Cotswolds version of Murder On The Orient Express, Sister Boniface is travelling to visit family at Christmas when her train becomes stranded in the snow. So far, so mildly irritating – but then the lights go out and when they come back on, a crime has been committed…\n\nSister Boniface Mysteries is on Drama HD (CH 116) and in On Demand on Tuesday 19 December at 8pm\n\nFans were bereft when it was confirmed that Ghosts would end after the fifth series – but it was revealed the team had sneakily filmed a Christmas special, acting as both a festive treat and a finale in one. The show’s previous yuletide outings have usually resulted families crammed on the sofa trying ever so hard not to ugly-cry, so the fact this is the final ever episode… well, make sure you’ve got your hanky handy.\n\nGhosts is on BBC One HD (CH 101) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Christmas Day at 7.45pm\n\nFew shows have captured the chaos of entertainment shows in the 90s – an endless array of anarchy that felt like they were seconds from being pulled off the air. Late Night Lycett follows that tradition with its mix of celebrity chat (where the celebs look like they actually want to be there) and members of the public. This Christmas special should be off-the-wall.\n\nLate Night Lycett is on Channel 4 HD (CH 104/108) in Apps & Games > Channel 4 on Thursday 21 December at 10pm\n\nJack Whitehall is returning for an all-singing, all-dancing special of Bad Education. Whitehall left the series after cameoing in the show’s reboot now led by original cast members Layton Williams and Charlie Wernham as teachers. The special episode features original songs and choreographed dances – perfect for Strictly star Layton to show off his skills.\n\nBad Education is now streaming in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer\n\nTwo Doors Down\n\nWhile this isn’t a Two Doors Down Christmas special that we have come to love and expect over the years, there is added poignancy to this final episode of the series – the last to have been co-written by Simon Carlyle before his sad death in August 2023. If this is to be the last ever episode, it’s an absolute belter.\n\nTwo Doors Down is on BBC One HD (CH 101) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Saturday 23 December at 9.35pm\n\nBy now, you’re either on board the Mrs Brown’s Boys train by now or you’re not (did you know the show is older than Call The Midwife, first airing in 2011?). Ths year’s Christmas and New Year specials aren’t going to change your mind – but for its many fans, it’s the perfect way to end your Christmas with some light chuckles.\n\nMrs Brown’s Boys is on BBC One HD (CH 101) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Christmas Day at 10.45pm and on New Year’s Day at 10pm\n\nGreg Davies and Alex Horne will be kicking off 2024 with their fourth New Year Treat special episode. Once the season of goodwill is out of the way, watch as five new celebrity guests get roasted like the proverbial turkey by Davies as they attempt a series of baffling tasks. The perfect easy-watching merriment while you recovery from New Year’s Eve festivities.\n\nTaskmaster’s New Year Treat is on Channel 4 HD (CH 104/108) and in Apps & Games > Channel 4 on Tuesday 2 January at 9pm\n\nNow the UK’s second longest-running sitcom of all time, Lee Mack’s gag-filled series seems like it isn’t slowing down any time soon. Part of its success is ignoring sitcom convention that nothing changes, because now “Lee” is married with kids and living in Surrey (a far cry from the original flat-share sitcom). The Christmas special is always a highlight of the season.\n\nNot Going Out is on BBC One HD (CH 101) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Christmas Eve at 10pm\n\nThe Heist Before Christmas\n\nStarring James Nesbitt and Timothy Spall star as two different Santa Clauses in this enchanting festive comedy drama that has a bit of a Home Alone vibe to it. Cynical 12-year-old Mickey is done with all that feelgood Christmas nonsense, until he meets two men dressed as the big red guy – one a bank robber, the other a bit vague…\n\nThe Heist Before Christmas is on Sky Max HD (CH 111) and in On Demand on Christmas Eve at 8pm\n\nAfter the adventurous double act of Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan joined the circus for Christmas 2021 and danced on ice in 2022, this year they’re in Lapland’s Santa Claus Village to take on some festive-themed tasks and see if they have what it takes to become Santa’s elves. In a twist that will surprise no one, this somehow involves freezing their bits off with an ice dip. Get ready for some seasonal swearing and yuletide yelping.\n\nRob & Romesh Vs Lapland is available in On Demand\n\nAfter last year’s stunt-unpacking Unofficial Science Of Home Alone special, the concept returns on Sky Max as comedians Paul Chowdhry and Chris Ramsey get into the nitty-gritty of Die Hard – from rooftop escapes to walking on broken glass. Someone cue up Annie Lennox! And there’s another 80s movie treat in the New Year when Greg Davies and Maisie Adam give the Indiana Jones films the same treatment. Meanwhile, Alex Brooker meets cast members to talk about what the films mean to them.\n\nThe Unofficial Science Of Die Hard is on Sky Max HD (CH 111) and in On Demand on Saturday 23 December at 9pm. The Unofficial Science Of Indiana Jones is on Sky Max HD (CH 111) and in On Demand on New Year’s Day at 9pm\n\nChristmas With Katherine Jenkins\n\nWhile we might have gone with the title “Kristmas With Katherine”, that’s the only remotely negative thing about this joyous festive celebration starring the wonderful mezzo-soprano in what’s basically her homecoming show at Swansea Arena. Joining her are Michael Sheen, singer/songwriter Jack Savoretti and classical pianist Chloe Flower.\n\nChristmas With Katherine Jenkins airs on BBC Two HD (CH 102) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Saturday 23 December at 7.10pm\n\nMarks & Spencer has been at the heart of British Christmas for well over a century. This special episode takes you behind the scenes to show how “Marks and Sparks” brings the festive feast to our tables each year, from the retailer’s top-secret development kitchens (spoiler: Percy Pig and Colin the Caterpillar are bound to feature) to shop floors across the nation.\n\nInside M&S At Christmas is available now in Apps & Games > ITVX\n\nCaroline Aherne: Queen Of Comedy\n\nThis Christmas Day on BBC Two is a night celebrating the comedy genius of Caroline Aherne, including the 2000 Christmas special of The Royle Family, the first episode of The Mrs Merton Show and this new Arena documentary featuring the many people who loved and worked with her.\n\nCaroline Aherne: Queen Of Comedy airs on BBC Two HD (CH 102) and in Apps & Games > BBC iPlayer on Christmas Day at 10.35pm"
