However, in just one week, on Monday April 8, any existing downloads will be removed from accounts.\n\nFrom this date, the BBC iPlayer Downloads app will be closed - so if you have any downloads you want to watch, you have a week to do so. The BBC said they could no longer keep the PC iPlayer platform running due to the expense and lack of people using it.\n\nIt's worth noting that this change does not affect downloads on the BBC iPlayer mobile or tablet apps. Viewers will also be able to continue to stream programmes on BBC iPlayer on their PCs and Macs.\n\nAll of the BBC's live and on-demand programmes can be streamed on your computer by heading to the BBC iPlayer website."
