        "meta_description": "WASHINGTON — Today, marking Russia’s two years of unprovoked and unlawful full-scale war against Ukraine and in response to the death of opposition politician and anticorruption activist Aleksey Navalny, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning almost 300 individuals and entities. Together with actions from the U.S. Department of State (State), this is the largest number of sanctions imposed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. State is designating three Government of Russia officials in connection with Navalny’s death; together, Treasury and State are sanctioning over 500 targets to impose additional costs for Russia’s repression, human rights abuses, and aggression against Ukraine. The Department of Commerce is also adding more than 90 companies to the Entity List.To deny Russia the resources necessary to support its brutal war against Ukraine, Treasury is designating targets including a major cog in Russia’s financial infrastructure; more than two dozen third-country sanctions evaders in Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East; and hundreds of entities in Russia’s military-industrial base and other key sectors.“This solemn anniversary and Aleksey Navalny’s death in Russian custody are stark and tragic reminders of Putin’s brazen disregard for human life, from Ukrainians suffering the costs of his unprovoked war to people across Russia who dare to expose the corrupt abuses that fuel his regime,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.  “Russia’s economy and military-industrial base are showing clear signs of weakness in part due to the actions we, along with our partners and allies around the world, have taken to support Ukraine’s brave defense. Putin has mortgaged the present and future of the Russian people for his own aims to subjugate Ukraine. The Kremlin chooses to reorient its economy to build weapons to kill its neighbors at the expense of the economic future of its own people. But we must sustain our support for Ukraine even as we weaken Russia’s war machine. It’s critical that Congress steps up to join our allies around the world in giving Ukraine the means to defend itself and its freedom against Putin’s barbarous assault.”State’s concurrent actions include sanctions on those involved in supporting Russian future energy revenue sources, maintaining Russia’s capacity to wage its war of aggression, and facilitating sanctions evasion and circumvention. State is also taking steps to impose visa restrictions on Russian Federation-installed purported authorities involved in the transfer, deportation, and confinement of Ukraine’s children. Since February 2022, the U.S. government has deployed a number of economic tools aimed at disrupting and degrading Russia’s economy and war machine. Over the last two years, including today, the Departments of the Treasury and State have designated over 4,000 entities and individuals pursuant to Russia-related sanctions authorities. Treasury’s actions, alongside those of its partners across the globe, are restricting Russia’s ability to generate the revenue it needs to fund its war and disrupting the Kremlin’s efforts to build a wartime economy.RUSSIA’S FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTUREOFAC is targeting Russia’s core financial infrastructure, including the operator of the Mir National Payment System and Russian banks, investment firms, and financial technology (fintech) companies, to further implement G7 commitments to curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system to further its war against Ukraine.National Payment Card System Joint Stock Company (NSPK) is the state-owned operator of Russia’s Mir National Payment System. NSPK is owned by the Central Bank of Russia and plays a key role in facilitating financial transactions both internal to Russia and abroad. The Government of Russia’s proliferation of Mir has permitted Russia to build out a financial infrastructure that enables Russian efforts to evade sanctions and reconstitute severed connections to the international financial system. The United States has repeatedly emphasized the risks of the Mir system to our partners around the globe. NSPK was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.OFAC also designated nine regional financial institutions, including several headquartered in Russian military-industrial base hubs; five investment and venture capital funds that seek to underwrite Russia’s development of advanced and next-generation technology and industry and inject domestic and foreign investment into Russian companies; and six financial technology (fintech) companies that provide software and IT solutions for Russian financial institutions. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 4.SANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILLIn addition to individuals and entities located in Russia, OFAC continues to target persons outside of Russia who facilitate, orchestrate, engage in, and otherwise support the transfer of critical technology and equipment to Russia’s military-industrial base. OFAC also will continue to impose sanctions on persons, wherever located, that allow Russia to reconnect to global financial markets using illicit channels. Targeting third-country facilitators is also a focus of our international partners, who also continue to sanction persons outside of Russia whose actions enable Russia to maintain, sustain, and rebuild its war machine. Our international coalition is sending a clear message to would-be evaders and circumventers that such actions have and will continue to have consequences. Today’s OFAC targets are located across the world and include third-country exporters and transhippers of technology, equipment, and parts to Russia, a freight forwarder involved in weapons shipments to Russia, and a transnational money laundering network facilitating the illicit movement of Russian-origin precious metals. In all, OFAC today targeted 26 third-country entities and individuals in 11 countries, including the People’s Republic of China, Serbia, the United Arab Emirates, and Liechtenstein. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3.ALABUGA UAV PROCUREMENT NETWORKToday’s action also targets the network through which Russia has acquired and produced deadly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Russia and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) have cooperated to finance and produce Iranian-designed one-way attack UAVs, also known as kamikaze drones, at a newly established a facility in Russia. State is also designating MODAFL pursuant to E.O. 14024 today. This network has facilitated shipments, conducted financial transactions, and engaged in industrial production in support of this cooperation between Russian and Iran to produce one-way attack UAVs for use by the Russian military in Ukraine, including against critical infrastructure and other civilian targets. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 1.RUSSIA’S MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL BASE AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ECONOMYOver the past two years, the U.S. government has imposed sanctions on a wide array of individuals and entities in Russia’s military-industrial base, from Russia’s flagship defense companies to machine tool importers, third-country sanctions evaders to semiconductor manufacturers. As Russia’s overheating war economy continues to cannibalize non-defense-related production at the expense of future economic prospects for the Russian people, an increasing number of entities across Russia are directly or indirectly contributing to Russia’s war machine. Foreign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions, or provide any service, involving Russia’s military-industrial base—including any person designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology, defense and related materiel, construction, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors of the Russian Federation economy—run the risk of being sanctioned by OFAC. Russia’s military-industrial base may also include individuals and entities that support the sale, supply, or transfer of certain items or classes of items. OFAC has issued Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions on OFAC Sanctions Authorities Targeting Support to Russia’s Military-Industrial Base.Today’s actions continue Treasury’s campaign to disrupt and degrade Russia’s military-industrial base, with a focus on advanced manufacturing and technology such as machine tools, including computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, which are used in Russia’s heavy machine-building and arms manufacturing industries; additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), of which Russia has increased its use for defense purposes, including creating special-purpose 3D printers for the production of UAVs, aircraft parts, and other military-related items; bearings, which are an integral component of Russia’s military hardware, including its main battle tanks; and other fields such as robotics, industrial automation and software, specialized lubricants, and lasers. Today’s actions also target persons operating or having operated in other sectors of the Russian Federation economy, including the engineering, electronics, metals and mining, and transportation sectors. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 2.-----------------------------ANNEX 1ALABUGA SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONERussia-based Joint Stock Company Special Economic Zone of Industrial Production Alabuga (SEZ Alabuga) maintains a contract with the Russian military to assemble Geran-2 UAVs that were shipped from Iran, while increasing domestic production capability to produce many of the components for the Iranian-designed UAVs in Russia.

In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. All transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or blocked persons are prohibited unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt. These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. In addition, foreign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions or provide any service involving Russia’s military-industrial base run the risk of being sanctioned by OFAC. Examples of activities that could expose foreign financial institutions to sanctions risk under E.O. 14024, as amended, are maintaining accounts, transferring funds, or providing other financial services (i.e., payment processing, trade finance, insurance) for any persons designated for operating in the specified sectors or for any persons, either inside or outside Russia, that support Russia’s military-industrial base, including those that operate in the specified sectors of the Russian Federation economy.  For additional guidance, please see the December 22, 2023 OFAC Sanctions Advisory as well as OFAC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1146-1157.The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here. For detailed information on the process to submit a request for removal from an OFAC sanctions list, please click here.For identifying information on the individuals and entities sanctioned today, click here. ###",

        "text": "WASHINGTON — Today, marking Russia’s two years of unprovoked and unlawful full-scale war against Ukraine and in response to the death of opposition politician and anticorruption activist Aleksey Navalny, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is sanctioning almost 300 individuals and entities. Together with actions from the U.S. Department of State (State), this is the largest number of sanctions imposed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. State is designating three Government of Russia officials in connection with Navalny’s death; together, Treasury and State are sanctioning over 500 targets to impose additional costs for Russia’s repression, human rights abuses, and aggression against Ukraine. The Department of Commerce is also adding more than 90 companies to the Entity List.\n\nTo deny Russia the resources necessary to support its brutal war against Ukraine, Treasury is designating targets including a major cog in Russia’s financial infrastructure; more than two dozen third-country sanctions evaders in Europe, East Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East; and hundreds of entities in Russia’s military-industrial base and other key sectors.\n\n“This solemn anniversary and Aleksey Navalny’s death in Russian custody are stark and tragic reminders of Putin’s brazen disregard for human life, from Ukrainians suffering the costs of his unprovoked war to people across Russia who dare to expose the corrupt abuses that fuel his regime,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Russia’s economy and military-industrial base are showing clear signs of weakness in part due to the actions we, along with our partners and allies around the world, have taken to support Ukraine’s brave defense. Putin has mortgaged the present and future of the Russian people for his own aims to subjugate Ukraine. The Kremlin chooses to reorient its economy to build weapons to kill its neighbors at the expense of the economic future of its own people. But we must sustain our support for Ukraine even as we weaken Russia’s war machine. It’s critical that Congress steps up to join our allies around the world in giving Ukraine the means to defend itself and its freedom against Putin’s barbarous assault.”\n\nState’s concurrent actions include sanctions on those involved in supporting Russian future energy revenue sources, maintaining Russia’s capacity to wage its war of aggression, and facilitating sanctions evasion and circumvention. State is also taking steps to impose visa restrictions on Russian Federation-installed purported authorities involved in the transfer, deportation, and confinement of Ukraine’s children.\n\nSince February 2022, the U.S. government has deployed a number of economic tools aimed at disrupting and degrading Russia’s economy and war machine. Over the last two years, including today, the Departments of the Treasury and State have designated over 4,000 entities and individuals pursuant to Russia-related sanctions authorities. Treasury’s actions, alongside those of its partners across the globe, are restricting Russia’s ability to generate the revenue it needs to fund its war and disrupting the Kremlin’s efforts to build a wartime economy.\n\nRUSSIA’S FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOFAC is targeting Russia’s core financial infrastructure, including the operator of the Mir National Payment System and Russian banks, investment firms, and financial technology (fintech) companies, to further implement G7 commitments to curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system to further its war against Ukraine.\n\nNational Payment Card System Joint Stock Company (NSPK) is the state-owned operator of Russia’s Mir National Payment System. NSPK is owned by the Central Bank of Russia and plays a key role in facilitating financial transactions both internal to Russia and abroad. The Government of Russia’s proliferation of Mir has permitted Russia to build out a financial infrastructure that enables Russian efforts to evade sanctions and reconstitute severed connections to the international financial system. The United States has repeatedly emphasized the risks of the Mir system to our partners around the globe.\n\nNSPK was designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the financial services sector of the Russian Federation economy.\n\nOFAC also designated nine regional financial institutions, including several headquartered in Russian military-industrial base hubs; five investment and venture capital funds that seek to underwrite Russia’s development of advanced and next-generation technology and industry and inject domestic and foreign investment into Russian companies; and six financial technology (fintech) companies that provide software and IT solutions for Russian financial institutions. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 4.\n\nSANCTIONS EVASION, CIRCUMVENTION, AND BACKFILL\n\nIn addition to individuals and entities located in Russia, OFAC continues to target persons outside of Russia who facilitate, orchestrate, engage in, and otherwise support the transfer of critical technology and equipment to Russia’s military-industrial base. OFAC also will continue to impose sanctions on persons, wherever located, that allow Russia to reconnect to global financial markets using illicit channels. Targeting third-country facilitators is also a focus of our international partners, who also continue to sanction persons outside of Russia whose actions enable Russia to maintain, sustain, and rebuild its war machine. Our international coalition is sending a clear message to would-be evaders and circumventers that such actions have and will continue to have consequences.\n\nToday’s OFAC targets are located across the world and include third-country exporters and transhippers of technology, equipment, and parts to Russia, a freight forwarder involved in weapons shipments to Russia, and a transnational money laundering network facilitating the illicit movement of Russian-origin precious metals. In all, OFAC today targeted 26 third-country entities and individuals in 11 countries, including the People’s Republic of China, Serbia, the United Arab Emirates, and Liechtenstein. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 3.\n\nALABUGA UAV PROCUREMENT NETWORK\n\nToday’s action also targets the network through which Russia has acquired and produced deadly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Russia and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) have cooperated to finance and produce Iranian-designed one-way attack UAVs, also known as kamikaze drones, at a newly established a facility in Russia. State is also designating MODAFL pursuant to E.O. 14024 today. This network has facilitated shipments, conducted financial transactions, and engaged in industrial production in support of this cooperation between Russian and Iran to produce one-way attack UAVs for use by the Russian military in Ukraine, including against critical infrastructure and other civilian targets. For more information on these targets, please see Annex 1.\n\nRUSSIA’S MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL BASE AND OTHER SECTORS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ECONOMY\n\nOver the past two years, the U.S. government has imposed sanctions on a wide array of individuals and entities in Russia’s military-industrial base, from Russia’s flagship defense companies to machine tool importers, third-country sanctions evaders to semiconductor manufacturers. As Russia’s overheating war economy continues to cannibalize non-defense-related production at the expense of future economic prospects for the Russian people, an increasing number of entities across Russia are directly or indirectly contributing to Russia’s war machine.\n\nForeign financial institutions that conduct or facilitate significant transactions, or provide any service, involving Russia’s military-industrial base—including any person designated pursuant to E.O. 14024 for operating or having operated in the technology, defense and related materiel, construction, aerospace, and manufacturing sectors of the Russian Federation economy—run the risk of being sanctioned by OFAC. Russia’s military-industrial base may also include individuals and entities that support the sale, supply, or transfer of certain items or classes of items. OFAC has issued Guidance for Foreign Financial Institutions on OFAC Sanctions Authorities Targeting Support to Russia’s Military-Industrial Base.\n\nToday’s actions continue Treasury’s campaign to disrupt and degrade Russia’s military-industrial base, with a focus on advanced manufacturing and technology such as machine tools, including computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines, which are used in Russia’s heavy machine-building and arms manufacturing industries; additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), of which Russia has increased its use for defense purposes, including creating special-purpose 3D printers for the production of UAVs, aircraft parts, and other military-related items; bearings, which are an integral component of Russia’s military hardware, including its main battle tanks; and other fields such as robotics, industrial automation and software, specialized lubricants, and lasers.\n\nToday’s actions also target persons operating or having operated in other sectors of the Russian Federation economy, including the engineering, electronics, metals and mining, and transportation sectors.\n\nFor more information on these targets, please see Annex 2.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nANNEX 1\n\nALABUGA SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE\n\nRussia-based Joint Stock Company Special Economic Zone of Industrial Production Alabuga (SEZ Alabuga) maintains a contract with the Russian military to assemble Geran-2 UAVs that were shipped from Iran, while increasing domestic production capability to produce many of the components for the Iranian-designed UAVs in Russia.

For additional guidance, please see the December 22, 2023 OFAC Sanctions Advisory as well as OFAC Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1146-1157.\n\nThe power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law.
