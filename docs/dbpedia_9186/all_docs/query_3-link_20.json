        "text": "The reason the Bolsheviks\n\nBolsheviks\n\nThe Bolsheviks were a group within the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, which formed the new government after the deposition of the Tsar and the October Revolution in 1917. chose Kharkiv as the Ukrainian capital is still a matter of debate, but this decision was obviously perfectly in line with the Soviet authorities’ favorite strategy: rewriting history and creating new symbols from a blank slate. Ukraine’s \"historical\" capital, Kyiv, had retained the image of an affluent, patriarchal city, and Kyiv was anything but loyal to the Bolshevik authorities during the civil war. Not so with Kharkiv. Unburdened by excessive imperialist symbolism, Kharkiv was a large industrial city and the center of the workers' movement, thus providing the ideal backdrop for revolutionary experiments.\n\nFor the Bolsheviks, Kharkiv became one of, if not the most iconic and symbolic construction site. The second most important Soviet republic’s new capital had to be created on an appropriate scale to show off its special status. Numerous social and cultural institutions were instated simultaneous to the transfer of the many administrative agencies to the city. All of this inevitably entailed a fundamental reorganization of urban space and its explosive growth. The scale of construction in Kharkiv in the 1920s and 1930s is awe-inspiring, even when compared to the radicality of many other urban planning experiments in the Soviet Union at that time. In Moscow, for instance, immense post-revolutionary construction appeared in pockets throughout the huge space of the metropolis, somewhat diluting the effect. In Kharkiv, new buildings were erected in a concentrated area, creating a sense of rapidly changing reality. At the same time, unlike the majority of the newly created Soviet “cities of the future,” Kharkiv had a rich history. Pre-revolutionary Kharkiv was one of the largest cities of the Russian Empire and an important university and industrial center, as reflected by its noble and stately architecture. Even against this backdrop, the buildings of the new era would stand in absolute contrast to those of the old.\n\nA vivid indicator of the status and ambitions of the city in the first decades of Soviet power is the number of unrealized architectural plans and projects. Only Moscow surpasses Kharkiv in this respect. Such projects included large government buildings, the grandiose construction of a theater of mass action for several thousand spectators, a huge sports arena, and wide transport highways. Most of these projects were not realized, but they served as an orientation for further development, visualizing the city’s image of the future and solidifying the new symbolic role of the city.\n\nIndeed, other projects went on to exceed all initial expectations. New Kharkiv, a so-called sotsgorod or socialist city planned from scratch to house the families of workers for new industrial areas, sprang up a few kilometers from Kharkiv in just over two years, from 1930-1932. The creation of new modernist settlements near large industrial enterprises was a trend of the era, with such cities popping up in many countries. But Kharkiv's experience turned out to be unique both in terms of time and scale. Built for the workers of the Kharkiv Tractor Factory, New Kharkiv was designed to immediately house more than one hundred thousand inhabitants, and a mere four months passed from the start of project development to the ceremonial ground-breaking of the settlement.\n\nKharkiv of the interwar period turned into a laboratory of technologies and ideas. Personnel with work experience in Kharkiv would go on to leave their mark on other important projects throughout the Soviet Union. For instance, following the successful construction of Derzhprom, Pavel Rottert became the chief engineer of Dneprostroi (Ukr. Dniprobud). With this company, he participated in the construction of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, at the time the largest hydroelectric power plant in Europe. A little later he headed construction of one of the main symbols of Soviet industrialization: the Moscow Metro.\n\nThe remarkable intensity and radicality of the changes to life in Kharkiv in the 1920s was not limited to architecture and industry. The Soviet authorities sought to turn the city into the new cultural center of Ukraine. Again, they saw it as an alternative and symbolic counterbalance to “petty-bourgeois” Kyiv.\n\nBefore the 1917 revolution , Russian was the predominant language in Kharkiv. And yet, around the turn of the 20th century, of all places Kharkiv became one of the main centers of the Ukrainian national movement\n\nUkrainian national movement\n\nDue to the fact that the territory of present-day Ukraine was part of the Habsburg Empire in the west and the Russian Tsarist Empire in the east in the 19th century, the Ukrainian national movement was by no means uniform. In the Russian Empire, Ukrainian was not regarded as a separate nation and language, but merely as a subordinate form or subgroup of Russian. Furthermore, Ukrainian culture and language were suppressed, for example by banning the Ukrainian language. However, this did not prevent some groups and individuals of the Ukrainian intelligentsia from expressing Ukrainian culture in literature, music, art, and other forms. Among its most important representatives were Taras Shevchenko, Mykola Kostomarov, and Pantelejmon Kulish. The movement was able to develop more easily in Austrian Galicia, which was characterized by a predominantly Ukrainian rural population. Ukrainian schools were founded here as early as the mid-19th century, meaning that Ukrainian national consciousness was established here earlier than in the eastern regions. Two particularly noteworthy supporters of the national movement in Galicia were the poet Ivan Franko and the historian Mychajlo Hruschewskyj. . As in other cities of the Russian Empire, national Ukrainian culture was only semi-legal. The imperial authorities opposed the development of national culture and were extremely wary of any manifestations of Ukrainianness. Nevertheless, it was in 1898 in Kharkiv that the first monument to the famous national poet Taras Shevchenko appeared on the territory of Ukraine. It was here as well that one of the founders of Ukrainian nationalism, lawyer Mykola Mikhnovsky, was active. In 1900, Mikhnovsky published his famous manifesto The Independence of Ukraine, and in 1904 he helped plan the bombing of the Pushkin monument in the city center. The monument was not destroyed by the explosion. In fact, only part of its pedestal broke off. The bust of Pushkin himself was removed more than a century later, on 9 November 2022, after the start of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn this sense, the Soviet Ukrainization\n\nUkrainization\n\nThe early period (approx. 1920-1930) of Soviet rule was characterized by a nationalities policy that followed the principle of korenisatsiya (rootedness). This meant the promotion of the many national identities and cultures of the multi-ethnic state and their integration into the state system. Among other things, Ukrainian culture was promoted during this phase and the Ukrainian language was used as the official language in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and taught in schools in that territory. However, this phase came to an end at the beginning of 1930 and, in addition to political dissidents, particularly the national minorities and elites of the Soviet Union fell victim to the purges of the 1930s. of the 1920s found rather fertile ground in Kharkiv and became part of the Soviet government’s new large-scale experiment in the field of nationality policy. The promotion of the Soviet republics’ national cultures fit in with Moscow's pragmatic strategy: Moscow aimed to win over indigenous populations and local elites, while demonstrating to the world that the various Soviet nations’ right to self-determination was manifesting in the young state. Thus Kharkiv did indeed become the place where the new national culture was constructed. In record time, numerous literary, artistic, and theatrical associations emerged in the city, drawing in creative young people and representatives of the national intelligentsia from all corners of Ukraine. The Soviet government’s representational journal USSR in Construction, published in several languages, noted in 1930: “Previously a primarily Russian city, now the capital of the Ukrainian working masses, in the Kharkiv of today there is publishing in Ukrainian, the development of Ukrainian literature, theater, and cinema, as well as attention to the national minorities of Ukraine,” (USSR in Construction, 1930, No. 7-8).\n\nThe intense concentration of cultural life that existed in Kharkiv during its time as the capital is not just a metaphor. The image of density can be taken quite literally. New creative organizations, magazine editorial offices, theaters, and art studios popped up in a small, compact space in the center of the city. Major figures of national culture and young literary stars lived and worked side by side, creating a unique atmosphere with a special vibe. As they did with other professions, the Soviet authorities put the creative intelligentsia in separate cooperative living quarters. In Kharkiv, local architect Mikhail Dashkevich designed one such house specifically for Ukrainian writers in the fashionable style of constructivism. A sort of tribute to the architectural aesthetics of the era, Dashkevich imagined the outline of the building in the form of a “C” – the shape of the first letter of the Ukrainian word slovo, itself meaning “word.” Among residents, the informal name of the building is indeed firmly established, the Slovo Building."
