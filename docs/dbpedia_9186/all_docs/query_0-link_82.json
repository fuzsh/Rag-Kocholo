        "text": "On February 24 2022, the world awoke to news that Russian tanks had rolled into Ukraine.\n\nThis page is updated with the latest maps, charts, videos and satellite imagery showing military, environmental and humanitarian aspects of the war in Ukraine.\n\nLatest situation\n\nUkraine’s incursion into Russia aims to establish a “buffer zone” to prevent cross-border attacks into Sumy in Ukraine by Moscow’s army, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, as Kyiv’s forces blew up a third bridge in the Kursk region to strengthen its positions there.\n\nUkraine’s air force chief Mykola Oleshchuk published two videos showing air strikes on two bridges across the river Seym near the towns of Glushkovo and Zvannoe, which analysts said would hinder Russian military logistics and help Ukraine to consolidate its grip on roughly 1,100 sq km of territory.\n\nNearly two weeks after Ukrainian troops smashed through the Kursk border, catching troops by surprise, Russia has struggled to respond. The Kremlin has ordered a “counterterrorism operation” in the region led by its federal security service and sent in young, inexperienced conscripts.\n\nBut they have so far failed to repel Kyiv’s forces, which captured several more small settlements. The Russian military has also used deadly glide bombs on its own territory to try to disrupt the operation.\n\nOther maps and charts from the war\n\nJune 2023 onwards: Ukraine’s counteroffensive\n\nWith slow progress on its counteroffensive and Russia showing no sign of quitting, Ukraine faced a protracted war that would require long-term support from allies — who were also focused on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nJune 2023: Destruction of Kakhovka dam\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine on June 6, floodwaters devastated towns and villages downstream, with dozens of people perishing in the disaster amid patchy evacuation efforts in Russian-controlled territories. The flood also narrowed Ukraine’s attack options in its counteroffensive, which got under way in early June.\n\nMay 2023: Russian fortifications\n\nUkraine’s months-long preparation for its summer counteroffensive to try to wrest back occupied territory allowed Russia to fortify its positions along the almost 1,000km frontline.\n\nSatellite images reviewed by the Financial Times and analysed by military experts revealed a multi-layered Russian network of anti-tank ditches, mazes of trenches, concrete “dragon’s teeth” barricades, steel “hedgehog” obstacles, spools of razor wire and minefields.\n\nMay 2023: Battle for Bakhmut\n\nOn May 21, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin hailed his first major victory since the early days of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, claiming that Russian forces had captured the eastern city of Bakhmut, despite Kyiv insisting the battle “was not over”.\n\nPutin said the Wagner paramilitary group had seized the Ukrainian city with help from Russia’s armed forces after months of bloody fighting that had caused more than 100,000 casualties and reduced the city to ruins.\n\nEarlier in the year, satellite images from the Vuhledar area, south of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region, revealed the extent of damage in areas that had suffered intense artillery shelling.\n\nSeptember-November 2022: Ukraine retakes Kherson\n\nA counteroffensive led to Ukraine liberating 3,000 sq km of territory in just six days, its biggest victory since it pushed Russian troops back from Kyiv in March.\n\nUkraine’s forces continued to push east, capturing the transport hub of Lyman, near the north-eastern edge of the Donetsk province, which it wrestled from Russian control on October 1.\n\nThe hard-fought victory came after nearly three weeks of battle and set the stage for a Ukrainian advance towards Svatove, a logistics centre for Russia after its troops lost the Kharkiv region in the lightning Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nUkrainian forces advanced into Kherson on November 11 after Russia said its forces had completed their withdrawal from the southern city, sealing one of the biggest setbacks to Putin’s invasion.\n\nKyiv’s progress and Moscow’s chaotic retreat across the Dnipro river under Ukrainian artillery fire meant Russia surrendered the only provincial capital it had captured in the war, as well as ceding strategic positions.\n\nMarch 2022: Russia fails to capture Kyiv\n\nThe Russians were thwarted in Kyiv by a combination of factors, including geography, the attackers’ blundering and modern arms, as well as Ukraine’s ingenuity with smartphones and pieces of foam mat.\n\nThe refugee crisis\n\nThe number of Ukrainians fleeing the conflict has made it one of the largest refugee crises in modern history.\n\nSources: Institute for the Study of War, Rochan Consulting, FT research."
