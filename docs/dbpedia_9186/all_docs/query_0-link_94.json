        "text": "State of emergency declared as Ukraine launches raid into Russia\n\nA state of emergency has been declared in the Kursk region of Russia, as a rare cross-border attack by Ukrainian troops continued on Wednesday.\n\nThe acting regional governor, Alexei Smirnov, said the move was necessary \"to eliminate the consequences of enemy forces coming into the region\".\n\nRussian officials said at least five civilians had been killed and 31 wounded, six of them children, since the start of the incursion.\n\nUkraine has not officially commented and the depth of the incursion remains unclear.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, up to 1,000 Ukrainian troops, as well as 11 tanks and more than 20 armoured combat vehicles, entered Russia near the town of Sudzha, Moscow said.\n\nFighting reportedly took place in a number of villages throughout Tuesday, with local authorities urging residents to limit their movements and all public events cancelled.\n\nA number of air alerts were issued in Kursk and footage posted online – verified by the BBC - showed fighter jets flying low over the region, with smoke rising from areas on the ground.\n\nThousands of people were evacuated from border areas and doctors were being drafted in from other cities, Mr Smirnov said.\n\nUkrainian incursions into Russian territory have been extremely rare since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Honcharenko said the Ukrainian army had established control over the Sudzha gas hub, a major gas facility involved in the transit of natural gas from Russia to the EU via Ukraine, which has continued despite the war.\n\nIt is the only point of entry for Russian gas into the EU.\n\nAlthough the claim has not been verified by the BBC, Mr Honcharenko's comment was the first confirmation of an incursion into Russian territory by a Ukrainian official.\n\nMr Honcharenko said on Facebook that while he did not know what the \"plan\" behind the incursion was, it would show \"Europeans and Americans that... Russia can and needs to be attacked\".\n\nRussia's military response to the incursion will be one of Andrei Belousov's first big leadership tests as the country's new defence minister, after he replaced his long-serving predecessor Sergei Shoigu in May.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC’s Newshour, Mr Honcharenko added that \"from a military point of view, we are trying to take back the initiative”.\n\n“We are showing the world that the world should not be scared of escalation or the reaction of Putin. There is no reaction,” he said.\n\n“For the first time since the Second World War, Russian territory that is internationally recognised is occupied and Putin did not [turn] to nukes and so on.\"\n\nHe said the incursion would also force Russia to move troops to the region and hopefully decrease the number of attacks it can carry out in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn a lukewarm reaction White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US had no prior knowledge of the attack and that it planned to reach out to the Ukrainian military \"to learn more about their objectives\".\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Ms Jean-Pierre said Washington will continue to ensure Kyiv has what it needs \"to defend themselves against Russia's aggression\".\n\n‘Heavy’ fighting in Sudzha\n\nIn a televised meeting with government officials on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of launching a \"major provocation\" and \"firing indiscriminately\" at civilian buildings and residences.\n\nRussia's Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the \"advance\" into the Kursk region had been stopped, with Russian forces \"continuing to destroy the adversary in areas directly adjacent to the Russian-Ukrainian border\".\n\nMr Gerasimov said Ukrainian forces aimed to take over the area around the town of Sudzha, and that Russia had already killed 100 men and injured another 215.\n\nHowever, some popular and generally well-informed pro-war Telegram channels suggested the situation on the ground was not as stable as the Kremlin said.\n\nBlogger Yuri Kotenok described the battles taking place in Sudzha and nearby Korenevo as \"heavy\", while the channel Rybar said that the situation in the area around Sudzha was \"continuing to deteriorate\" and Ukrainian formations were advancing towards the town. The BBC is unable to verify these claims.\n\nThe influential pro-war Rybar Telegram channel went on to strongly criticise the highest ranks of the Russian military on Wednesday, saying that \"for two months the full information was sent to the useless headquarters\", adding that there was enough time \"to make an appropriate decision\".\n\nRybar's concerns were echoed by several other pro-war bloggers, who are very popular with Russian readers. They often offer a more critical perspective of military developments than the Kremlin, without questioning whether or not the war is necessary.\n\nThe Russian National Guard said it had strengthened the security of the Kursk nuclear power plant, which lies some 70km (43 miles) north-east of Sudzha.\n\nIn its latest report, the Institute for the Study of War said geolocated footage from the past two days show that Ukrainian armoured vehicles have advanced to positions 10km into the Kursk region.\n\nIn the Belgorod region, which neighbours Kursk, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov also issued missile attack warnings throughout Tuesday and said several people had been injured in Ukrainian air attacks.\n\nOn Wednesday, the head of the Ukrainian region of Sumy, Volodymyr Artyukh, ordered the evacuation of the areas that border Kursk.\n\nOne colonel in Ukraine’s military, Vladislav Seleznyov, told the prominent Nexta channel the attack was “preventative”, with an estimated 75,000 Russian troops continuing to gather close to the border.\n\nAfter a major cross-border incursion by Russia into the north-eastern Kharkiv region in May, there had been fears Moscow would attempt the same into the Sumy region further north.\n\nWith Ukraine now apparently capturing several settlements and highways the other way, those ambitions may well have been frustrated for now.\n\nBut with Ukrainian forces already overstretched and outmanned, some military analysts are questioning the wisdom of such cross-border raids.\n\nThis is not the first incursion into Russia by fighters based in Ukraine. Some groups of anti-Kremlin Russians launched raids last year, which were repelled.\n\nThe forces crossed into the Belgorod and Kursk regions again in March, where they engaged in clashes with Russian security forces.\n\nFor the past few months Russia has made incremental gains in eastern Ukraine, as many of Kyiv's ground forces have faced relentless attacks in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nIn a recent interview Ukraine's head of defence intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said the main offensive by Russian forces \"is expected to be over in a month and a half to two months\"."
