        "text": "Ukraine chief explodes at Germany over Russia snub\n\nUkraine is in the midst of a terrifying crisis. With Russian troops on their doorstep, this eastern European democracy is desperately trying and defend its sovereignty. As Ukraine tries to tear itself away from Russian influence, it has never been more important to refer to the capital as Kyiv, not Kiev. Here’s why spelling matters.\n\n“Kyiv” is the official Latin transliteration of the capital’s name in the Ukrainian language.\n\n“Kiev” derives from the Russian way of pronouncing the city’s name.\n\nVladimir Putin has continued to push the Russian spelling and pronunciation of the Ukrainian capital, despite Ukraine’s attempts to revert it to its original spelling.\n\nUntil recently the international community has widely used the spelling “Kiev,” but with an estimated 100,000 Russian troops on Ukraine’s border, the country’s independence is under threat.\n\nREAD MORE: Expert warns Putin's Ukraine plan could put Russia in 'real trouble'\n\nTherefore, it has never been more important to use refer to the capital as Kyiv to recognise Ukraine's independence from President Putin’s controlling regime.\n\nDr Yuri Shevchuk told the New York Times: “There’s no reason other than old colonialist inertia to continue using a Russian spelling for a Ukrainian city name.”\n\nHow do you pronounce Kyiv?\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in 2019, Dr Shevchuk explained how to pronounce Kyiv properly.\n\nHe said native Ukrainians stress the first vowel. The \"i\" is pronounced similarly to the “i” in “kid” or “lid.”\n\nMr Shevchuk added the second vowel is pronounced as a separate syllable and sounds like the “ee” sound in “keel.”\n\nAnd the v is also pronounced like the end of the word “low.”\n\nIn comparison, the Russian 'Kiev' is pronounced like Kee-ef\n\nIncreasingly, western media is adopting the Ukrainian-language derived “Kyiv” as their official spelling for the country’s capital.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the Telegraph, and the BBC have all ditched the Russian-rooted “Kiev” in solidarity with Ukrainian’s desire to ditch the Russian influence still gripping their country.\n\nBut this isn’t a recent revelation - in the 1990s the Ukrainian authorities tried to endorse “Kyiv” as the correct spelling for their capital, Atlantic Council reports.\n\nThis was done in light of a wider drive to assert a Ukrainian identity after the country broke away from the Soviet Union.\n\nUkraine became an independent state in 1991 and has since tried to reverse the so-called “Russification” of their country.\n\nUkraine has long been under the influence of Russia.\n\nUnder the Russian Empire and later the Soviet State, the use of the Ukrainian language in print was often outlawed and words altered to firm up Russian linguistic and political positions in the country.\n\nSince becoming independent Ukrainian authorities have tried to change other place names with their original names, however, this wasn't met with much success.\n\nOutside of diplomatic protocol, the international community didn’t pay much attention to Ukraine’s desire to take back its identity by reverting place names to their original Ukrainian spellings.\n\nThis has meant that the better known “Kiev” has largely stuck.\n\nWhen Russia backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and aggressively annexed Crimea in 2014, a fresh bid was made to try and change the spelling of the capital for good.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry launched a social media campaign to try and achieve this.\n\nThe campaign called on social media users to use the hashtags #CorrectUA and #KyivNotKiev and asked international media to switch from “Kiev” to “Kyiv”.\n\nThankfully, people are becoming increasingly aware of the significance of this spelling and are ditching the Russian “Kiev” out of respect for Ukrainians."
