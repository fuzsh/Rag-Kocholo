        "text": "Ukraine has come under attack by Russian air strikes again, officials say, after two days of major aerial assaults by both sides.\n\nMost attacks were concentrated on Kharkiv in the east, but explosions were also reported elsewhere.\n\nMoscow said it was retaliating against Ukrainian strikes on the Russian border city of Belgorod on Saturday, which killed at least 24 people.\n\nThat came after Russia carried out air strikes across Ukraine on Friday.\n\nKyiv said those Russian attacks, which killed at least 45 people, were the biggest missile bombardment of the war so far.\n\nThe latest Russian strikes happened as Ukraine entered its final day of 2023.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the attack on Kharkiv, including on a hotel, was a direct response to Saturday's strikes on Belgorod, and that it had used high-precision missiles to hit military targets in the city.\n\nHowever, Ukraine says not a single military facility was hit. A defence ministry spokesperson told local media that Russia deliberately hit civilian infrastructure to cause as much damage as possible.\n\nOn Sunday, Ukraine's air force reported it had destroyed 21 of 49 Russian drones launched overnight, with most attacks aimed at the Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions.\n\nUkraine's air defence systems in the region surrounding the capital Kyiv were also engaged late on Saturday to repel a Russian drone attack, the military administration of the region said on Telegram.\n\nThe regional governor of Kharkiv said that 28 people had been hurt after at least six missiles hit the city near the border with Russia overnight.\n\nUkraine's interior ministry also reported damage to 12 blocks of flats, 13 homes, hospitals, a hotel building, a kindergarten, commercial premises, a gas pipeline and cars.\n\n\"These are not military facilities, but cafes, residential buildings and offices,\" Kharkiv's mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.\n\n\"On the eve of the New Year, the Russians want to intimidate our city, but we are not scared - we are unbreakable and invincible.\"\n\nIn the southern region of Kherson, the governor also reported two people killed by Russian shelling.\n\nThe latest attacks come after a deadly couple of days in Ukraine and Russia.\n\nRussia's massive bombardment of Ukraine on Friday killed dozens and injured nearly 160. Several cities were attacked, including the capital, Kyiv.\n\nKyiv's military administration chief Serhiy Popko said on Sunday that more bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a warehouse that was hit by an air strike - taking the total number of people killed in air strikes on the city to 22, and the overall death toll across Ukraine from Friday's attacks to at least 45.\n\nEven before more people were pulled out of the wreckage, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko had described the attacks as the deadliest day so far for civilians in the city.\n\nSaturday saw Ukrainian attacks on south-west Russia, near the border with Ukraine, which a Ukrainian security source told the BBC was a \"response to Russia's terrorist attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians\".\n\nThe regional governor for Belgorod said on Sunday that 24 people were now known to have died in the attack.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov says four children were among the dead in what was one of the deadliest attacks on Russia since it invaded Ukraine.\n\nMore than 100 people were also injured in the attacks on Belgorod city, the region's administrative capital near the border.\n\nThe Ukrainian security source said more than 70 drones had been launched against Russian targets.\n\nAddressing the situation in Belgorod, they blamed civilian casualties on the \"incompetent work of Russian air defence\" - saying this was what caused falling fragments."
