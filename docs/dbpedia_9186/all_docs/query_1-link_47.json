So that you don’t offend your Ukrainian friends remember that there is no definite article “the” in the name of Ukraine. Just as odd as it would be to say “the France” or “the Canada” this is a country with a one word name, Ukraine.\n\nA beautiful country with beautiful people, closely tied to Russia as sharing a common birth place. Kyiv is one of the most beautiful and historic cities in the world, and the locals call it “Keev.”\n\nVisa Information:\n\nVisa and passport information can be found here.\n\nTransportation:\n\nMost likely you are flying into the main airport, Borispol International AIrport . Taxi service is plentiful at the airport or one can use the Skybus, a comfortable bus service to the city. This runs every 15 minutes in daytime hours and every 30 minutes at night.\n\nTaxi Service:\n\nTaxis in Kyiv tend to be expensive if you are a foreigner. Most visitors are better off using the Metro underground but for the more adventurous, every car is a potential taxi. You’ll find this to be true in most neighboring countries as well. Stick out your thumb and soon a car will stop. State where you are going, negotiate your price and off you go. (Note that this is now illegal in Moscow.) Wait to pay until you’ve collected all your things out of the car.\n\nAutosvit\n\ntel.: +38 044 234-4444, 247-0000\n\nAutotax\n\ntel.: +38 044 451-0021, 423-4540\n\nDelta Taxi\n\ntel.: +38 044 238-8284, 495-1919\n\nElite Taxi\n\ntel.: +38 044 531-9977, 238-8-238\n\nEuro Taxi\n\ntel.: 246-1036, 249-4040\n\nExpress-Taxi\n\ntel.: +38 044 239-1515, 495-1414\n\nPublic Transportation around Kyiv:\n\nPublic Transit is excellent in Kyiv from the trams and trolleybuses to the underground metro, city buses or by long distance trains to other cities, Kyiv offers many transport options.\n\nMetro stations are marked with a recognizable M logo.\n\nThe Kyiv Metro system consists of three lines which cover approximately 66.1 kilometres (41.1 miles) and 51 convenient stations. About 1.439 million passengers ride the Metro daily.\n\nTwo additional Metro lines are under construction and stations on those lines will open once completed. The Kyiv Metro fare is 2.00 UAH or about $0.25 cents.\n\nHere is a map of the Kyiv (Kiev) Metro subway system:\n\nElectric Trams: “tram-viy” (трамвай) are electric trams that run around the city on tracks. You’ll find these, mostly with older wagons, in almost every former Soviet city you visit. They are economical and an excellent way to get where you’re going while enjoying a view of the city as you go.\n\nMarshrutka vans: (Маршрутка) are mini-buses, typically yellow or white in Kyiv. City buses are also yellow so size does matter, the longer are city buses and taker longer to reach your destination because of frequent stops. Marshrutka minivans however drive a set schedule hour after hour with fewer stops. Most of the time you can find one going your direction so ask the driver if necessary. Prices are much less than taxis and they get around a lot faster than a city bus. Last prices we checked were 2.5 UAH (approximately 25 cents) a trip and you pay by passing your fare from passenger to passenger up to the driver or the person sitting next to him. If change is needed, it will be sent back the opposite direction.\n\nDriving: Most international driving rules apply in Kiev. However, beware that most locals fail to follow many driving laws – Ukrainians are some of the worst speeders in the world – they love to step on the gas. Officially, speed limits are 60 kph/37 mph in cities, 90 kph/56 mph in unpopulated areas, and 120 kph/72 mph on highways. You can turn right on red lights, wherever there are signs. Parking in Kiev is as difficult as in any other major European city. In downtown Kiev, many motorists park their cars on the sidewalks.\n\nDriving into Kyiv:\n\nTraveling outside of Kyiv to other regions:\n\nTrain tickets: most region to region travel in Ukraine is done by train and you can view schedules and purchase tickets at this link.\n\nElectric trains: called Elektrichka (электричка), from the outside at first these look a lot like normal long distance trains but they’re not. First off, they run from electric supply (not to be confused with city trams) and go around a region or city to city short distances. The Kyiv system covers 51 kilometers with 14 stations.Kyiv region electric train.

The penalties are severe and you are never sure what may happen in such incidents involving the Militia (as the local Police, is known). It is highly advisable to purchase liquor in the better shops rather than small kiosks; this reduces the risk of weak, fake or dangerous products.\n\nBusiness Hours: An 8-hour day is considered a standard work day. Most offices and institutions operate on this schedule Monday through Friday. A lunch break is taken between 1 and 3 PM. Most banks are open without breaks Monday through Friday from 10 AM to 5 PM.
