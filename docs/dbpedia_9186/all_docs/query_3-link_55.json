        "text": "Summary of PIMA report\n\n(Published in December 2019)\n\nUkraine’s public capital stock has been on a declining path over the last 20 years. Having started the period at a relatively high level (99 percent of GDP in 1996), it now ranks amongst the lowest of its comparator countries (56 percent in 2013). Evidence as to the reasons for the deterioration point to significant and persistent weaknesses in the institutional framework surrounding public investment management, inefficient allocation of resources to productive public investment and high levels of perceived corruption. Ukraine currently has an efficiency gap of around 32 percent, which ranks it below average amongst emerging market countries and other comparators. Persistent under-investment, the currently high stock of debt, and ongoing institutional weaknesses, coupled with effects of the conflict in the East could see this gap continuing to grow, absent concerted efforts to reverse recent trends.\n\nHow To Read The Flower Chart\n\nScoring\n\nEach institution is analyzed along three dimensions that reflect the key features of the given institution, resulting in a total of 45 dimensions. Three possible scores are assigned to each dimension (1: not met, 2: partially met, 3: fully met) and their average within an institution produces a score for that institution. PIMA scores are summarized in a chart that allows comparison with its comparators. In the chart, the further the away from the center, the higher the PIMA scores.\n\nInstitutional Design and Effectiveness\n\nAnother key feature of the PIMA is that it assesses both institutional design (“what is on paper”) and effectiveness (“what is in practice”) of a given country, because there is often a gap between the design of formal rules and how they are implemented in practice, due to capacity constraints among others.\n\nScores by Income Level\n\nAll countries, most notably emerging markets and low-income developing countries, have significant room to improve their infrastructure governance to increase effectiveness in public investment.\n\nWhat Countries are in Each Income Group\n\nThe countries listed below cover only refer to those that have conducted PIMA.\n\nAdvanced economies (ADV) and low-income developing countries (LIDC) are classified according to latest World Economic Outlook. Emerging market (EME) include those not classified as advanced economies or low-income developing countries. Fragile states are classified based on IMF Policy Paper, Macroeconomic Developments and Prospects in Low-Income Developing Countries, 2018.\n\nAdvanced Economies (ADV)\n\nEstonia\n\nIreland\n\nPoland\n\nSlovak Republic\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEmerging Markets (EME)\n\nAlbania\n\nAngola\n\nAnguilla\n\nArgentina\n\nArmenia\n\nBelize\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBotswana\n\nBrazil\n\nBulgaria\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCroatia\n\nEgypt\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEswatini\n\nGabon\n\nGeorgia\n\nGrenada\n\nGuyana\n\nIndonesia\n\nJordan\n\nKosovo\n\nLebanon\n\nMalaysia\n\nMaldives\n\nMauritius\n\nMexico\n\nMontenegro\n\nMorocco\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nRomania\n\nSerbia\n\nSri Lanka\n\nThailand\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTunisia\n\nUkraine\n\nLow-Income Developing Countries (LIDC)\n\nBangladesh\n\nBenin\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nCambodia\n\nCameroon\n\nCôte d'Ivoire\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\nThe Gambia\n\nGhana\n\nGuinea\n\nHaiti\n\nHonduras\n\nKenya\n\nKiribati\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nLiberia\n\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMali\n\nMauritania\n\nMoldova\n\nMongolia\n\nMozambique\n\nNepal\n\nNiger\n\nNigeria\n\nRwanda\n\nSenegal\n\nSierra Leone\n\nTogo\n\nUzbekistan\n\nVietnam\n\nZambia\n\nFragile States (FS)\n\nCôte d'Ivoire\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\n\nGambia\n\nGuinea\n\nHaiti\n\nKiribati\n\nKosovo\n\nLebanon\n\nLiberia\n\nMadagascar\n\nMalawi\n\nMaldives\n\nMali\n\nSierra Leone\n\nTimor-Leste\n\nTogo"
