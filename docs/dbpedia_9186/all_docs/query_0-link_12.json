        "text": "WARNING: Intermittent missile strikes by Russia continue in Kyiv. Stay away from military facilities, transportation and energy infrastructure and key government facilities. See the warning box at Ukraine for up-to-date details. (Information last updated 09 Dec 2023)\n\nKyiv (Ukrainian: Київ, also transliterated Kiev from Russian: Киев) is the capital of Ukraine, as well as the country's largest and most vibrant city. It is a city where the golden domes of Orthodox cathedrals sit amidst royal palaces and the grey concrete of Soviet Brutalist buildings.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe official name of the city has long been Kyiv, a transliteration from the Ukrainian Київ. A common alternative English name of the city, Kiev, is a transliteration of the Russian Киев. While the two names were formerly used interchangeably in English, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the choice of name has assumed political connotations; supporters of the Ukrainian government tend to use \"Kyiv\" as a sign of solidarity, while supporters of the Russian invasion tend to use \"Kiev\".\n\nIn 2020, it was home to 3 million people. It is in the north of central Ukraine on the Dnieper River (Ukrainian: Дніпро, Russian: Днепр).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vikings and the Old Norse, Russian Empire, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Soviet Union\n\nThe Ukrainians are understandably very proud of their capital's role in establishing European civilization in Eastern Europe. Kyiv is one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe dating back to the 5th century although settlements at this location existed much earlier. By the late 9th century, Kyiv was at the center of an emerging Eastern Slavic state. Between the 10th and early 13th centuries, the city reached its golden age as the capital of the first Ukrainian state known today as Kievan Rus (Kyivan Ruthenia, or Rus-Ukraine). It was this state that shaped the religious and cultural foundations of the modern East Slavic states of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Russia also claims its origin in Kievan Rus, and this claim continues to be a major bone of contention between Ukrainians and Russians.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Kievan Rus was overrun by the Mongols. Later that century, Kyiv became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 the city was absorbed into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1654 the Cossack, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky \"liberated\" Kyiv from that Commonwealth, but then promptly folded it into the Russian Empire, an action that continues to be a sore point for Ukrainian nationalists.\n\nFull Russian annexation came in 1775 and the city remained under Russian rule with brief independence between 1918 and 1920 during the chaos that followed the Russian Revolution. Over these two centuries, Kyiv experienced growing Russification and Russian immigration. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it became the capital of independent Ukraine and is now discovering its place as a large European capital.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nAverage temperatures are maximum 26°C (79°F), minimum 15°C (59°F) in summer and maximum -2°C (28°F), minimum -8°C (17°F) in winter. Spring and autumn (fall) can be very brief. Heat waves featuring temperatures as high as 38°C (100°F) are rare but not unheard of in the summer months, and brief but potent cold spells with temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F) are not uncommon in winter. Wintery precipitation can begin as early as October, and snowfall is fully expected by late fall and the winter months, when it can become intense enough to affect travel. However, snow cover is not always constant and even in the winter there can be periods when the ground lies barren. Warm clothes are a necessity from November through March, but dressing in removable layers will help travelers stay comfortable in any situation.\n\nTalk\n\n[edit]\n\nIn general, the people in Kyiv are hospitable and will be eager to help you. However, if you don't have a knowledge of Ukrainian or Russian you may find service in restaurants and shops difficult, though this is slowly changing among younger generations with more exposure to English. 51% of all Ukrainians can speak English, while the percentage in cities like Kyiv is being higher than that.\n\nWhile 85% of residents claim Ukrainian ethnicity, most Kyivans also speak Russian (all Kyivans can understand and speak Ukrainian, nonetheless). Many Kyivans, and even the residents of nearby villages, often speak a dialect referred to as Surzhyk in which it is common to hear phonemes and words which do not exist in standard Russian such as Ukrainian \"г\" (IPA: /ɦ/) or the word \"немае\". Like many former Soviet cities, Kyiv is a multicultural place: you will certainly meet ethnic Russians - which form about 13% of the city's population - and also Armenians, Azeris, Belarusians, Georgians and Tatars. There are also people claiming Jewish, Polish, Romanian and Hungarian descent.\n\nOfficially, all signs are in Ukrainian only. Since 2011, signs with Latin transliteration are starting to make an appearance throughout Ukraine.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: Due to the state of war, Ukraine's airspace remains closed to civil aviation. (Information last updated 28 Jan 2024)\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Ukraine#By train\n\nThere are international direct trains to Chisinau (15 hr), Vienna (24 h) and Warsaw (17 hr). Ukrainian Railways[dead link] has Intercity trains from Poltava (3 hr), Lviv (5 hr), Kharkiv (4 hr 30), Dnipro (5 hr 15 min) and Odesa (7 hr 15 min) among many other smaller cities - usually with two daytime trains and one slower overnight train. Direct trains from Crimea (under Russian military occupation) remain suspended.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nTickets can be purchases on Omio, BlaBlaCar and other bus apps.\n\nBy boat\n\n[edit]\n\nIt's possible to organize trips down the River Dnipro to the Black Sea in summer. A travel agency in Ukraine can book these trips for you.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv can seem quite foreign to the western tourist, as most signposts are in Cyrillic script. It is still largely a city where few people know English, but their number among young people is growing quickly. Many may not be able to maintain a conversation, but are likely to understand spoken English. Many cafés and restaurants offer menus in English, and the Metro has all announcements in Ukrainian and English. For the non-Russian or Ukrainian speaker, it's quite possible to get around easily, and it is a very interesting city to explore.\n\nIt is advisable, however, to pick up a pocket Russian or Ukrainian phrasebook, and learn the Cyrillic alphabet, which can be fun and is easy to learn. Spend some time practicing key words and phrases (e.g. 'hello', 'thank you' and 'bill please'). Even what you regard as a feeble attempt at Ukrainian or Russian will amuse most people to the point where they become comfortable engaging in pantomime or trying out the little bit of English they know.\n\nAmong locals, it might be considered impolite to chat loudly (e.g. in the Metro), point or wave one's hands. According to a superstition, it's suggested to avoid whistling indoors.\n\nFor shorter distances, there is no better way of getting around Kyiv than hitting the sidewalk, especially in the areas of the city center like Maidan Nezalezhnosti, Kontraktova Ploshcha, Arsenalna. The city center area consists of many hills, so be prepared and plan accordingly. The underground pedestrian crossings are ubiquitous and let you cross the busy streets without waiting for the traffic lights, many of them connect to the underground malls, being a specialty of Kyiv. Keep in mind they are often not equipped with elevators, just the stairs.\n\nBy municipal public transport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe base fare per trip is 8 грн with no difference for the length of the trip. Additional discounts apply for journeys paid in bulk. Each transfer means another trip (unless in the metro). E-Ticket guide can be found on the website.\n\nThere are 4 ways to pay for public transport trips in Kyiv:\n\nUsers of Google Pay, Apple Pay and contactless credit/debit cards can pay directly without the need for a separate ticket; just tap your card or device on the turnstile reader.\n\nSingle-journey paper tickets called QR tickets (not to be confused with the digital payment method listed below) can be purchased at the ticket office or ticket machines and scanned at the turnstile. These have replaced the old token system on the Metro.\n\nTap the prepaid Kyiv Digital (Київ Цифровий) multi-journey plastic card. The card can be purchased for 50 грн at all metro stations, and in T-Kiosks all around the city. You can top up the card at metro stations, via the Kyiv Digital app (iOS, Android), on EasyPay[dead link] , and at EasyPay, PrivatBank, City24[dead link] terminals.\n\nA digital version of the single-journey QR ticket can be purchased through the Kyiv Digital (Київ Цифровий) mobile app (iOS, Android) and used by scanning your phone screen at the turnstile.\n\nAll 4 are supported across the municipal transport network, including the funicular.\n\nTap / scan your preferred way of public transit payment only once when entering at the turnstile or at a ticket validator inside (depending on the mode of transport) and wait for a few seconds for confirmation. There is no need to scan again before exiting, since the price doesn't depend on the duration of the trip.\n\nBuses and trams do not accept cash payment or sell tickets onboard, so remember to get a ticket or transit card ahead of time before boarding, if not using contactless payment. The modernised light-rail trams depart from dedicated platforms with turnstiles and ticket machines so there is no need to validate your ticket onboard; remember to choose the correct platform if catching a tram at the main railway station.\n\nYou can track public transport on the official website and EasyWay.\n\nBy metro\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Metro (Метро) is one of the pleasures of Kyiv. It is a clean and fast subway system, and it is easy to navigate once you realize that all three metro lines (red, blue and green) go through the city center. There are 52 stations operating, and ambitious plans for the lines' extensions. The official website can be found here.\n\nAll stations support contactless credit card/digital payment, but not necessarily at every turnstile - look for those marked with the corresponding logos, often indicated by bright yellow/orange color. A green arrow will appear, indicating that the payment has been successful. When passing through a turnstile, make sure you walk through the correct side of the turnstile i.e. scanning the ticket on your right, not to be hit with a metal gate that will slam shut.\n\nThe cost of using the contactless payment is the same as a single-ticket, and discounts are automatically applied if you travel frequently. You can also associate your contactless card with a monthly/half-monthly unlimited travel plan for further discounts. As of March 2020, a tourist pass is planned. It would provide with an unlimited number of trips in any municipal mode of transport for 24, 48, and 72 hours from the moment of activation. They will cost 100, 150, and 200 грн, respectively.\n\nMost maps and signposts in the metro are translated into English. Every station has a unique three-digit number, with the first digit showing the number of the line (M1 for red, M2 for blue, and M3 for green). Once on board, every station is announced by loudspeakers and screens. These screens show a lot of weird ads between the stations, but flag an impending station before arrival. Upon departure, they then show the next station.\n\nMetro stations where you can interchange have two different names - one for each line. If you are changing lines, the other station can be reached by an overpass in the center or near one of the ends of the platform.\n\nTrains run every 30 to 150 seconds during business hours, every 5 min after 20:00, and every 10–15 min after 22:30. The last trains depart from the terminal stations around midnight, so your last chance to catch a train in the city center is between 00:15 and 00:25 (check the timetable of late departures, which is signposted on each station). Trains are often very crowded. Be prepared to push, as this may be the only way you get on the train during peak hours.\n\nThe Kyiv metro has some of the deepest stations in the world. The M1 \"Arsenalna\" is the deepest metro station in the world, at 107 m deep, and the M1 \"Universytet\" has one of the longest escalators (87 m long). Many stations have two long and intimidating escalators in a row.\n\nSpend some time looking at the stations. The red line features impressive architecture, similar to that seen in the Moscow and Saint Petersburg metro systems. Elaborate mosaics in the \"Zoloti Vorota\" (Золоті ворота) station depict rulers and other historical characters of the medieval Kyivan Rus.\n\nBy bus / trolleybus\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two types of city-run buses available – bus (автобус) and trolleybus (тролейбус) – as well as slow and moribund trams. Tap your phone (Google/Apple Pay compatible) at the orange ticket validator upon entering the vehicle. The message will signify the payment complete.\n\nUnlike the buses in Western Europe, in Ukraine there is no need to neither wave for the bus to stop as it approaches, nor push a button to ask for a stop. They will always stop on every designated stop, which are marked by an inconspicuous sign on a telegraph pole.\n\nThe buses are often very crowded during peak hours, but the norm is to push your way in.\n\nBy tram\n\n[edit]\n\nTravelling by tram mostly for on or to suburbs can be an option. In western Kyiv maybe a useful end station which is at the M2 \"Kontraktova Ploscha\". From here depart No.14 far to the westward and No.18 to the M1 \"Vokzalna\". Also, from M2 \"Kontraktova Ploscha\" depart to northbound No.11 to M2 \"Obolon\", No.19 to M2 \"Minska\", No.12 to northwest, a bit out of city limit to Horenka settlement. For more info, visit Kyivpastrans website.\n\nBy funicular\n\n[edit]\n\nBy marshrutka\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can also travel on so-called route taxis or minivans called marshrutky (маршрутки). These are privately run vehicles that travel assigned routes, which are listed on the front of the bus. They are easy to be confused with the public city buses, as both are shown on the apps like Google Maps. Marshrutka routes can be hard to figure out, but they have a list of stops on the window and a Metro logo for the metro stops. The best way to figure out where these go is to ask some of the locals. City maps usually picture all public transport, normal buses, trolleybuses, trams and marshrutky. The one downside to using marshrutky is that they tend to be a little overpacked (understatement) and very warm or cold, depending on season.\n\nYou can hail a marshrutka at the assigned bus stops. When you board, you pay the driver directly in cash or, if you're not near the driver, pass the money to the nearest passenger who will pass it to the driver. Your change will be returned in reverse order, but it is unwise to pass big bills. Kyiv Tsyfrovyi card / QR code can not be used in marshrutkas. The fare ranges for about 5 грн, and is usually stated on the front and sidewalk-side of the vehicle, so you will know how much you pay in advance. It is good to have some change, so you can pay exact amount.\n\nWhen you are reaching your destination, simply yell out to the driver to stop \"Na zupyntsi\" with stress on \"-pyn-\"', which literally means \"on the stop\" in Ukrainian, or use Russian: \"Na astanovkie\", stressing on \"-nov-\" (some 100 m in advance to the bus stop you need). If you overshoot, you get a nice walk and a driver gets a little extra stress a day.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis are the easiest way to get around the city, with low fares by Western standards. Marked taxis that can be hailed on the street are relatively rare compared to ridesharing app drivers. An Uber trip within the inner city (i.e. between any two of the major downtown attractions) should normally cost between 100 and 200 грн, exceeding 300 грн only during rush hour (as of Jan 2024); prices may differ with other services.\n\nBy scooter\n\n[edit]\n\nKick scooter is a funny way to shorten your time while getting around the city.\n\nBy bike\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are more than 200 km of infrastructure for bicycles in Kyiv. While you can use your own bike, you can also rent one using one of the following companies:\n\nBy car (rental)\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the taxi app rides ubiquitous and cheap, there is generally little reason to rent a car unless exploring outside the city. Kyiv city traffic is known to be quite heavy unless on weekends.\n\nTraditional car rental apps like Booking or Kayak let you compare the options across multiple locations for the car to rent for multiple days and has to be returned to the same location (unless paying extra fees).\n\nCar-sharing apps like Getmancar may be a better choice for short trips and let you save money in comparison to the taxi apps, the cars can be picked-up and dropped off in minutes flexibly in the zones all over the city (including the airports). Make sure to sign up on the app a day before - as the validation is not instantaneous.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv Pechersk Lavra complex\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: As of January 2024, the Perchersk Lavra cave system is closed to all visitors, including resident monks, due to a political dispute between the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church and the municipal government.\n\nOther religious buildings\n\n[edit]\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nMotherland Statue and war memorials\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv was pretty much destroyed during the invasion in World War II. The memorial near the motherland statue is pretty gripping. Lots of examples of classic Soviet-era memorial statuary, as well as some amazing exhibits of military hardware. The National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War located in the base of the statue is a must-see for visitors interested in the impact the German invasion had on the Soviet Union. Well worth the visit even if you don't speak or read any Russian or Ukrainian (several English language tours are provided daily). It's well curated and full of artifacts (including weapons, battle maps, hundreds of original photographs, and a moving installation at the end of the exhibit symbolizing the great losses suffered). There is also a small museum of the Afghan conflict nearby. Try to enter coming from the top part of the Pecherska Lavra. This way you get submerged with old soviet music and dark statues. M1 \"Arsenalna\".\n\nObolon Raion\n\n[edit]\n\nA part of the city on far north. These territories far beyond of its historical neighborhood with the same name. Its current population is 290,000 inhabitants.- The Obolon district encompasses the territories of the former Minsk district and is still sometimes referred to by that name. It also includes the former town of Pushcha-Vodytsia that used to be part of the Podil Raion. The name Obolon comes from the Old-Ukrainian word оболонь → болонь → болоньє (obolon' → bolon' → bolon'ye), which roughly translates as \"flood plain\" or an area that is being engulfed by water. The district was built up in the 1970s as a microdistrict in Kyiv on the Obolon sands to satisfy the growth of the city. Due to the composition of the soil at the time, the majority of the buildings were at most nine-stories tall, and few trees were planted when compared to other parts of the city. That and few other reasons originally made the district not prestigious. With the second construction period (2000–2005), the district has seen new, comfortable apartment buildings constructed closer to the Dnipro river and has become an attractive residential area. The new apartments are also more expensive, although still cheaper than in the center of Kyiv. The district was connected by M2 in the 1980s, with a station M2 \"Obolon\" opened on November 5, 1980. Now, here is M2 \"Minska\" and M2 \"Heroiv Dnipra\", too.\n\nPodil Raion\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is a historic neighborhood and an administrative raion (district) in Kyiv. It is one of the oldest neighborhoods of Kyiv, the birthplace of the city's trade, commerce and industry. It still contains many architectural and historical landmarks, and new archaeological sites are still being revealed. Numerous attractions of Podil particularly include: Frolivskyi and Pokrovskyi Convents, National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, House of Ivan Mazepa, House of Peter the Great, Fountain of Samson, Zamkova Hora hill, Andriyivskyy Descent — the main link of Podil to the city's administrative Uppertown, Borychiv Descent, Kyiv River Port, Kyiv funicular, Poshtova Square, and the Kontraktova Square. Modern Podilskyi Raion, despite its tourism and culture importance, remains one of Kyiv's main business, transportation and industrial districts.\n\nFurther afield\n\n[edit]\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nGo to church, even if you'd never do so at home: Orthodox services are strangely moving even to unbelievers. They are also mighty long and there are few if any seats in church, but it's perfectly acceptable to come and go as you please, as locals do. Women must cover their heads before entering the church. Pick any church you please, but St Volodomyr's (on Tarasa Shevchenka Blvd, listed above) is a good choice.\n\nParks and gardens\n\n[edit]\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv has many recreational running routes with different road surfaces. If you like plain terrain, opt for Mariiinskyi Park in the city center. You can even extend your route and run across the Lovers’ Bridge to the Puppet Theatre. If you fancy moderate hills, go for Spivoche Pole, with lots of open air and field tracks for those who do not like blacktop surface. For moderate mountainous lovers, there is Hryshko Botanical Garden with views to Paton Bridge and the Dnipro River.\n\nKyiv Shooting Club offers firearms shooting, providing different kinds of weapons available even for non-licensed travelers.\n\nIce skating is possible inside the city’s shopping centers. The largest indoor rink is at the Kosmopolit Shopping Center with an area of 1,800m2 (19,000ft²). You can of course find outdoor and covered skating rinks, such as Katok. It is a spacious “ice rink bubble”, just 15-minute walk from the M2 \"Pochaina\".\n\nOther\n\n[edit]\n\nWatch football at FC Dynamo Kyiv, who play soccer in the Premier League, the Ukrainian top tier. Their home ground is Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex, capacity 70,000, one km south of city center.\n\nShaktar Donetsk, who also play in the Premier League, have been displaced from their home city by the fighting. They've had a spell based in Lviv, but since 2020 have shared Olimpiyskiy stadium with Dynamo.\n\nUrbex for urbex enthusiasts, Kyiv is a goldmine. A quick Google search will turn up myriad abandoned spots and several groups willing to take visitors on tours of unusual spots around the city.\n\nFestivals\n\n[edit]\n\nVisit different eco-cultural, ecological, ethnic, rock and other festivals both inside the city and near its suburbs.\n\nLearn\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a number of private schools where you can learn Ukrainian or Russian, either part-time or full-time. There are also experienced teachers in the city - check out resources such as Kyiv In Your Pocket, The Kyiv Post, and What's On Weekly for details of schools and teachers.\n\nUniversities\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of Ukraine's universities are situated in the capital city.\n\nNational University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy ― one of the smallest and oldest universities in Ukraine. Offers courses in English.\n\nWork\n\n[edit]\n\nForeigners can sometimes find work teaching their native language. Pay is usually decent enough to live on in Kyiv if you get enough pupils and live by local standards.\n\nAs is the nature in a global economy, professionals with skills in demand, e.g. accountants and IT professionals, can be employed with global firms in Kyiv, without knowledge of Russian or Ukrainian languages.\n\nGetting a work permit (visa) is a necessity for foreigners if they are going to be employed by any legal entity (exceptions apply only for international institutions and representative offices of foreign companies). The work permit is more of a hiring permit. The potential employer has to apply with the labor administration for hiring a non-resident employee. With the application a complete CV, as well as documents showing an accredited education, have to be submitted.\n\nBuy\n\n[edit]\n\nFor more information on currency, see Ukraine#Money\n\nBanks and exchanges booths are very easy to find, with most of them displaying their rates outside the shop. Simply go around at least 2 blocks and compare rates. While a few of them are open 24 hours, those that do remain open at night may display bad buying rates.\n\nRates at the airport are not as good as in the city center. Not all hotels will change money and if you arrive in the evening or on a Sunday you could find yourself with no money for dinner if you don't change at least some at the airport. Most banks operate on Saturdays as well as Mondays to Fridays.\n\nATMs are everywhere and generally work with international credit and debit cards.\n\nLike in most places in Ukraine, having plenty of small change will prevent hassle from shop staff who perpetually lack small money.\n\nMarkets\n\n[edit]\n\nShopping malls\n\n[edit]\n\nGroceries\n\n[edit]\n\nUkrainian supermarkets are known for their convenience and long working hours, always open during the weekend, many operating 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.\n\nMost supermarkets conveniently have the coffee/tea machines inside. Some bigger ones have the food courts with a variety of cuisines so that you can enjoy a full meal in-between buying groceries.\n\nMost bottled waters are sparkling. To purchase regular bottled water, ask for literally \"water without gas\" (VoDA bez gaza). A 500 mL bottle should cost 3-6 грн, occasionally they will inflate the price to 10 грн if you look like a rich tourist.\n\nDo not forget to buy a few big jugs of bottled water, such as Staryi Myrhorod (Старий Миргород) or Truskavetska (Трускавецька). Kyivskij tort (київський торт) is another thing you should eat in Kyiv if you love cakes. Dark rye bread, Ryazhenka (Ряженка, Ukrainian style yogurt), Kvas (Квас, fermented drink made of bread) could also be interesting things to taste.\n\nChocolates, cakes, lollies, chips and biscuits/cookies are widely available at low cost and very popular with Ukrainians - after years of being deprived western brands, snack foods are becoming big business.\n\nPlastic bags are available but are not free, and some stores do not take credit cards. Bag your own groceries. If you're paying in cash, make sure the cashier gives you correct change back, as some are careless or dishonest.\n\nBanks\n\n[edit]\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nIn general, it is very cheap to dine in Kyiv by Western European or US standards. So long as you stay away from the places that totally pander to tourists or to the Porsche Cayenne-driving \"elite\", the food is great and cheap. Try the Borscht and the Mlyntzi and then try absolutely everything else. Baked goods are cheap and great too. Even the ice-cream on the street is great. Try, for example, the one to the right from M1 \"Khreschatyk\" - blue kiosk with varying length of queues.\n\nWhen you see vendors selling some liquid from big yellow/blue tanks on the street, you can be sure that it is \"Kvas,\" which is a brewed bread drink. Some people like it and others hate it. It tastes a bit like malt, and the alcohol content is so low (0.05-1.44%) that it is considered acceptable for consumption by children. Try \"Odyn Malenkyi\" (one small) drink.\n\nYou should not drink the tap water (for reasons both chemical and microbial). It is advisable to buy bottles in the supermarkets. You can always order \"Bonaqua\" (a brand of sparkling mineral water), but beer is just about as cheap.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nFast-food chains\n\n[edit]\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nIt's also worth checking out pubs and restaurants that offer business lunches during weekday lunch. These are set menus that usually cost around 40 грн, and include soup, salad, meat dish and a drink.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nNational\n\n[edit]\n\nUkrainian: There are many restaurants that claim to serve authentic Ukrainian food.\n\nItalian: Momento on Zolotoustivska Street (near the Circus), Napule on Mechnikova (near M3 \"Klovska\")\n\nGeorgian: Mimino on Spaska Street (Podil)\n\nVietnamese: there are several restaurants, owned by a person from Vietnam (the cuisine is a comprise of \"hits\", rather than complete luncheon sets; considered above-average within local Vietnamese community; extremely expensive)\n\nChinese: There is a good one near M1 \"Universytet\". It's called \"Jiu Long\", which means \"Nine Dragons\" (there is a fast food store upfront, but if you go through the arch, you will see an entire Chinese-style building, that's where the real restaurant is; quality is good and prices are lower than some other similarly fancy restaurants). If you don't care about price, go to \"Lun Van\" near M1 \"Teatralna\". Other above-average venues (but no one who's experienced anything like the real thing will find satisfactory Chinese food in Kyiv are Mandarin on a floating entertainment complex near the river port in Podil, and Vostok which is across the road from Mandarin.\n\nJapanese: There's one called Hanoi which serves Japanese and Vietnamese food. It is near M1 \"Arsenalna\". The quality is quite high, although the prices are too. Further, you will find various sushi-bar-chains in Kyiv (namely Sushi-Ya, Murakami and Yakitoria)\n\nKosher\n\n[edit]\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several nice places in Kyiv to get a drink. From small cafés that are only frequented by locals (they look dirty at first sight) to expensive places. Locals often buy drinks (beer) at a stall in the street and drink it in a park, leaving their bottles for the homeless to collect and cash in. However, since 2011, drinking beer in the street is prohibited and whilst you will see locals drinking in the street, you will make yourself an easy target for the police to stop and try for a bribe if you do. Locals often buy some chips or other salted things to go with their drinks.\n\nThe prices are quite reasonable by European standards. You will easily find decent Ukrainian beer for 20–30 грн and get 5cL of vodka or similar alcohol for about 20 грн.\n\nCoffee houses\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you are not keen about alcohol, try one of the abundant coffee houses. No matter whether their names are well-known and international (Starbucks, Costa Coffee, Russian-based Coffee House and Shokoladnitsa) or weird and local (Coffee Land, Coffee Life, and other similar variations), they are always neat places with similar menu featuring all imaginable versions of coffee, a good choice of tea, fancy milk shakes and smoothies, and a selection of cakes. Their main advantage is free Wi-Fi, while on the downside are the prices that are rather high on Kyiv standards. Coffee and piece of cake start from 20 грн each.\n\nWhen you urgently need a shot of espresso, you can also try coffee sold on the street. Basically, every second kiosk will offer some kava (Ukrainian word for coffee), but its quality is at best iffy. A safe choice would be special cars equipped with coffee machines. These cars can be found in most public places and next to entrances to the metro stations. They offer decent take-away coffee for 8-10 грн.\n\nIf you prefer places that do not look the same in each town and are not owned by big companies, you should try the café \"Living-Room\" in the vul. Spas'ka, 6, near M2 \"Kontraktova Ploscha\". The small but cozy place is organized by some enthusiasts and musicians. Two pianos and some other instruments can be used by the staff or guests! While most cafés would close at 22:00 this one is open as long as the staff wants to work. Besides excellent coffee they offer a wide range of very tasty teas, original cakes (e.g. beetroot-chocolate cake!), Beer and so on (no vodka). The kitchen will help you out for the small hunger.\n\nBars\n\n[edit]\n\nPubs\n\n[edit]\n\nIrish\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several Irish pubs, none authentic, but OK if you're in need of a Guinness and expat company. One is located near Golden Gate (Zoloti Vorota) on Volodymyrska Street (called, eponymously, The Golden Gate Pub). Another (and the first in Kyiv) is O'Briens on Mykhailivska Street (one of the streets running west off Maidan sq., the one to the right, with a branch of OTP Bank on the corner). Both are expensive by Kyiv standards. A new one has opened in Podil, on the corner of Gostyny Dvor, near the Dutch embassy (can't miss it as it's close to the bottom of Andriivskyi Descent) called the Belfast Pub. Other than these centrally located ones, others lie scattered around Kyiv, they do not cater to the ex-pat crowd and have better prices than you expect to find in any 'western' country. Keep your eyes open. Also try Dockers Pub.\n\nBelgian\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two Belgian beer cafés.\n\nClubs\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv has a nice club scene. Ranging from very cheap to overly-expensive, you can find what you want.\n\nA few popular venues are at the Mandarin Plaza shopping mall (Arena Entertainment complex), rumored to be owned by the Klitschko brothers. The clubs include Arena, Sky Bar, Barsky and Grotesque. They're right next to Bessarabsky market; most of the clubs are accessible from the court.\n\nSleep\n\n[edit]\n\nThis guide uses the following price ranges for a standard double room: BudgetLess than 2,000 грн Mid-range2,000-6,000 грн SplurgeMore than 6,000 грн\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nAir raid sirens will be activated in case of airstrikes or missile strikes. Prepare a bag with necessities. If you hear air raid sirens, follow the red arrows to your nearest civil defense shelter. If you can't find the shelter or the shelter is nonoperational, go to your nearest metro station. All Kyiv metro stations are being used as civil defense shelters. Intercity transportation has been significantly disrupted due to an outflow of evacuees.\n\nKyiv is a generally open and friendly city and stays lively until at least 23:00 in most districts.\n\nAvoid drinking the water from the tap — bottled water is cheap and available everywhere (Morshinska/Моршинська, Mirgorodska/Міргородська is good).\n\nRobberies and scams on tourists are fairly common in Kyiv. The best approach is to be extremely selfish and ignore anyone who approaches you. Avoid eye contact with suspicious looking people. If you do get caught up in a scam (such as the infamous wallet scam or the \"Look, I've just found money\" scam or even if you are stopped by someone claiming to be a policeman), simply ignore the person and walk away, indicate that you want to call your embassy or go to the next police station to get the problem sorted. That will usually shake the person off.\n\nIf you are leaving your baggage in the station, it is better to leave it with the guys in person rather than use a locker. Stories have been heard of people 'assisting' with the locker and overseeing the code, then walking off with the bag afterward.\n\nOn the metro, always keep your belongings securely zipped as close to your skin as possible. Pickpockets are highly organized and often in gangs that know what they are doing.\n\nThere are occasional (rare) reports of visitors being shaken down by corrupt officials, often customs officials. Naturally, the best protection is to make sure that you stay on the correct side of the law and, if there is any question, to keep your cool and not become argumentative. It seems that the cost of an error is surrendering the object in question and paying a \"fine.\" The officials are skilled at ensuring that people who argue miss their flights. Making, or giving the impression of making, a phone call to your country's embassy has been known to clear up \"problems\" quicker than actually paying the \"fine\" --- or pretend to have a very late flight.\n\nWalking around in the tourist areas (e.g. Maydan) at night there have been instances of groups of police stopping tourists and going through an overly theatrical display of asking to see passport and other documents, and sometimes even search for drugs or other prohibited items. To deal with this, firstly always carry your passport, not doing so will give them an easy excuse to extract a bribe. Secondly, making it clear that you speak absolutely no Russian may help. Lastly, don't give them any excuses whatsoever to threaten you with arrest—just because the locals drink in the street doesn't mean you should. Don't cross the road except at authorized points. Try and follow the rules.\n\nSome thieves like to abuse new tourists, for example, by playing plainclothes cop. They are rarely aggressive. They will go to you only if you're walking alone and don't look too familiar with the town. A bit of resisting usually shakes them off (but not too much, since you never know).\n\nThere is still some corruption in Ukraine; some services might openly ask you to bribe them to process your request, and denying it might make them refuse to help you. If encountering such situations, make sure to report such cases to the police online.\n\nThe people are very tolerant, and it is only reasonable to assume that they expect the same in return.\n\nConnect\n\n[edit]\n\nPost offices\n\n[edit]\n\nTelephone\n\n[edit]\n\nMobile (cell) phones: GSM (900/1800), 3G (CDMA, UMTS) and 4G (LTE) is used in Ukraine. This system is compatible with mobile phone networks used everywhere, apart from parts of the Americas and US dominated parts of Asia.\n\nIf you have an unlocked phone, you can get a Kyivstar (in Ukrainian), lifecell, or Vodafone SIM card for a few dollars at the airport or street vendors which will give you a local number and free incoming calls. Note that some of those cards don't have money on their account, so you may want to buy a payment card when you buy a sim card. If you don't have an unlocked phone already, new ones can be had for 1,200-1,600 грн and a touch cheaper if you buy a pay-as-you-go sim card at the same time. Incoming calls are free in Ukraine, so in extremis you can just SMS/text a request for a return call for a small charge.\n\nIf you are roaming in Kyiv, SMS messages do work well. They are confirmed to work for most foreign networks. Do note that the size of the country and the relative low population densities of rural areas means that sometimes there might be 'black-spots' where mobiles will not work. But of course these are away from the main cities/urban areas (and most of the main arterial road and rail routes also have reasonably consistent call signals).\n\nIf you are trying to call the US from your GSM phone, you may find that the access numbers for your calling card are blocked. Plan ahead and sign up with a callback service before you start your travels, or you can provoke them to call you (at much better rates) when you need to make a call.\n\nInternet\n\n[edit]\n\nThe easiest way to maintain Internet connectivity if you use your own laptop is to buy a 7-day unlimited Lucky Internet callback card. They are about 36 грн at the street kiosks. When you dial in, you will be initially firewalled off from everything until you activate by visiting their website.\n\nYou may also buy wireless internet access for your laptop for about 10 грн per day.\n\nInternet cafés have a good service. They usually have different types of computers with varying prices.\n\nNear the metro station on ul Khmelnytskoho (on the left side at a corner) there is one that is very good, open 24 hr non-stop. The cheapest computers cover your basic needs, the most expensive ones are usually for hardcore gamers.\n\nAlso, most foreigner-friendly cafés (see \"Drink\" section above) and a lot of fast food restaurants (including McDonald's) offer free Wi-Fi. Some require password to use their access point, ask waiter to get it.\n\nCope\n\n[edit]\n\nKyiv was part of the USSR. Some things work well, and other things may be broken. There is no point in stressing about this. Arrive with that realization and be prepared to roll with a few surprises.\n\nEmbassies\n\n[edit]"
