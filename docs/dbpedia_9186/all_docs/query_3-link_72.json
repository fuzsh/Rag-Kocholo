        "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russia launched another large missile and drone attack on Ukraine's two largest cities on Tuesday, killing five people and injuring 127, Ukrainian emergency services said.\n\nStrikes on Ukraine's capital of Kyiv hit residential buildings, a supermarket and gas infrastructure, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nKyiv resident Viktor Tyschenko, 75, says he heard \"five or six explosions — and then boom! We thought our lives were over.\"\n\nThe apartment complex where he and his partner live had been hit and caught fire. Their sixth-floor flat was quickly destroyed.\n\n\"There was so much smoke,\" his partner, 76-year-old Iryna Karetnykova, says. \"I was yelling, 'Save us! Save us!' — hoping someone would hear.\" Rescue workers came with a crane and helped the couple escape.\n\nHer face and hands still covered in soot, she says, \"We don't have anything anymore. We are homeless now.\"\n\nTwo of the fatalities and 45 injured were in the apartment building, according to Kyiv's mayor.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country's defenses shot down 70 of nearly 100 missiles across Ukraine, most of them over Kyiv. The northeastern city of Kharkiv was also \"hit hard,\" he said on his Telegram social media channel.\n\n\"The enemy launched dozens of attack drones, cruise and aerial ballistic missiles at Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Kropyvnytskyi and other settlements,\" the Foreign Ministry statement said.\n\nGen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, commander in chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said on X, formerly Twitter, the military was able to shoot down 10 of Russia's advanced Kinzhal missiles with the help of Patriot systems.\n\nThis follows a holiday weekend of Russia's aerial assaults on Ukraine, with a major attack on cities across Ukraine including Lviv, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi."
