The series aims to inform and support policy makers in their immediate response to the crisis in the early phases of the conflict, and inform longer-term domestic reconstruction and global-recovery efforts as the situation evolves.\n\nSince the start of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine, more than 10 million people have been displaced, either within Ukraine or abroad. Labour market integration of internally and externally displaced individuals remains challenging. While many immediate measures were undertaken in Ukraine and in host countries to support displaced Ukrainians, longer-term solutions are needed to enhance their human capital, and allow them not only to integrate into their receiving communities but also contribute to the recovery of Ukraine."
