        "text": "When Russia initially invaded Ukraine last week, one of its primary targets was the countryâs capital and most populous cityâwhich most English-language news outlets used to call âKiev.â In recent reports, however, itâs much more common to see or hear âKyiv.â Hereâs the history behind the switch.\n\nAs The Guardian explains, Russian and Ukrainian have a lot in common: Theyâre both east Slavonic languages that use versions of the Cyrillic alphabet. But Ukrainian evolved in its own direction, borrowing from Polish and originating certain pronunciations, letters, and vocabulary. Plenty of Ukrainian words are similar to their Russian counterparts, and the name of Ukraineâs capital city is one of them. In Ukrainian, itâs ÐÐ¸ÑÐ², which gets Latinized as Kyiv. In Russian, itâs ÐÐ¸ÐµÐ²âor, in English, Kiev.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union controlled the area during the 20th century, it systemically tried to quell Ukrainian culture in favor of Russian cultureâa process known as Russification, with origins dating back to the 19th century. This included promoting Russian over Ukrainian language, which is essentially how Kiev became more popular than Kyiv among international audiences. As the Soviet Union unraveled in 1991, Ukraine declared its independence and the country has been working to supplant Kiev with Kyiv ever since.\n\nIn 1995, as The Independent reports, the government made Kyiv the official Latinized name for the city; and in 2018, Ukraineâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs kickstarted a campaign called #KyivNotKiev to encourage the rest of the world to finally make the change official, too. The United States Board on Geographic Names did so in June 2019, and the media has gradually followed suit."
