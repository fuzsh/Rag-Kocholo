        "text": "Ukraine’s central bank eased some foreign exchange restrictions for businesses, a move it called the biggest currency market liberalization since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nThe loosening of capital controls follows the long-awaited approval last month of a $61 billion Ukraine assistance package from the US, which includes $7.8 billion in budget support. It also comes as Washington and its partners are in talks over tapping interest income from roughly $280 billion in frozen Russian assets to also help support Kyiv."
