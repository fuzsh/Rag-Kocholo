        "text": "The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is being bombarded with rocket strikes, as Russia continues its offensive against its Eastern European neighbour.\n\nPhotos and videos shared on social media appeared to show huge explosions and columns of smoke filling the sky in Kyiv on Friday morning, as air raid sirens rang across the city.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted: “Last time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany. Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.”\n\nThe spelling of the capital’s name has become something of a touchpoint during the conflict. Britons will be more used to the “Kiev” spelling, but most UK media outlets have recently adopted “Kyiv” instead.\n\nHere is the difference explained.\n\nIs it Kiev or Kyiv?\n\nThe Ukrainian capital is known as Київ in Ukrainian and Киев in Russian.\n\nAs with many words in languages that use the Cyrillic script, the transliteration of the name into the Roman alphabet is not precise, and it could be spelled variously as Kyiv, Kiev, Kyyiv or Kiyev.\n\nKiev was the standardised spelling when the city was under the rule of the Soviet Union, and continued to be used after the union dissolved in 1991.\n\nThe Ukrainian government legally approved a switch to Kyiv in 1995, but the issue gained added importance for many Ukrainians in 2014, when the pro-Russian leader Viktor Yanukovych was ousted and the country began to seek closer ties with the EU and Nato.\n\nMany Ukrainians see the name Kiev as a relic of the country’s Soviet past, as it is closer to the pronunciation in Russian, whereas Kyiv matches the pronunciation in Ukrainian.\n\nIn 2018 the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs launched the “KyivNotKiev” campaign, to attempt to persuade other countries to adopt their favoured spelling.\n\nIt said at the time: “Ukraine has been an independent sovereign nation for more than 27 years, but the Soviet-era versions of many geographic names stubbornly persist in international practice. The usage of Soviet-era place names – rooted in the Russian language – is unacceptable to the people of Ukraine.”\n\nCampaigns targeted airports, embassies and international media, and the change started to be adopted towards the end of the decade.\n\nAssociated Press, a news agency which provides copy to most major English-speaking media outlets, said at the time: “Although the AP prefers traditional English spellings for many cities, including Rome, Moscow and Warsaw (not Roma, Moskva and Warszawa), we regard the Ukrainian spelling of Kyiv as an important adaptation because it is linked to Ukraine’s present status.\n\n“To many Ukrainians, the former spelling Kiev appears outdated because it is associated with a time when Ukraine was part of the Russian and Soviet states, rather than an independent country.”\n\nHowever, a number of media outlets have only adopted the Kyiv spelling during the current conflict, which is why people are suddenly seeing it far more often. For example, The Daily Mail announced it was making the switch on Friday.\n\nHow do you pronounce Kyiv?\n\nThe pronunciation of Kyiv is a little different to Kiev.\n\nIn English the new spelling is pronounced KEY-eve, rather than KEY-yev.\n\nVitaly Chernetsky, a Ukrainian-born professor in the Department of Slavic and Eurasian Languages and Literatures at the University of Kansas, told NPR the old pronunciation is still OK when talking about food.\n\n“Just like we can still say Peking duck, it’s OK to say chicken Kiev,” he said."
