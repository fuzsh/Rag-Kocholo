        "text": "You can stay updated and follow our coverage of Russia’s war on Ukraine here.\n\nYou can also read more about Ukraine’s surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region here.\n\nFor more on Mali’s spat with Kyiv and whether the Russia-Ukraine war spilling over into Africa, read this.\n\nUkraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia brought war to his country and must feel the consequences after Ukraine launched an unprecedented incursion across the border.\n\n“Russia brought the war to our land and should feel what it has done,” he said in his evening address, without directly referring to Ukraine’s offensive into Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nRussia’s defence ministry says it thwarted the Ukrainian army’s advance in Sudzha and Korenevo in the Kursk region amid an ongoing Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory.\n\nRussia’s Battlegroup North units “keep destroying Ukrainian armed formations in the Sudzha and Korenevo districts of the Kursk Region directly adjacent to the Russia-Ukraine border,” it said, according to the TASS news agency.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly claimed to have repulsed the attacks since Ukrainian soldiers broke into the territory of Russia’s Kursk on Tuesday morning.\n\nCourts in Russia and Russian-controlled territory have handed long jail terms to Ukrainians accused of attempted “terrorism” and “espionage” on behalf of Kyiv, AFP reports.\n\nOne court in southern Russia found Tetiana Klyuchko guilty of participating in a “terrorist” group and attempting to commit an “act of terror” and sentenced her to 12 years in a penal colony.\n\nProsecutors in the Rostov region said Klyuchko in 2023 joined a clandestine “terrorist” group and expressed readiness to “take part in preparing and carrying out an act of terror in the Zaporizhia region”.\n\nInstructed by an officer from Ukraine’s GRU military intelligence, Klyuchko received an improvised explosive device, prosecutors said.\n\nIn eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region, which is almost entirely under Russia’s control, the supreme court sentenced a Ukrainian man to 13 years in prison for espionage after finding him guilty of handing over information on troop movements.\n\nYuriy Galetsky gathered information about troop locations in the northeastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region from 2022 and gave it to Ukrainian secret services, prosecutors said.\n\nThis week, Mali announced it was severing ties with Ukraine, after accusing Kyiv of having a hand in a devastating ambush in the West African country’s northern Kidal region in late July that saw dozens of Malian soldiers killed.\n\nSeparatist Tuareg rebels who masterminded the attack claimed they had killed Malian soldiers and mercenary fighters from Russia’s Wagner Group.\n\nAnalysts have said that if those claims are true, it might be the worst defeat for the mercenary group since it first deployed in 2021 to help Mali, which is led by a military government, fight a swarm of armed groups operating across the country.\n\nRead our story here.\n\nThe Russian-appointed district head for the Kherson region has said F-16 fighter jets were spotted over the Kakhovka district for the first time, Russian news agency TASS reported.\n\n“Since yesterday, F-16 jets have been flying over our district. This is done only to sow panic, to suppress our faith in victory,” Pavel Filipchuk said on Telegram, according to TASS.\n\n“They will all be shot down and destroyed,” he added.\n\nNATO allies transferred the first batch of United States-built F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine last month, amid hopes that they would boost Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has expanded legislation on “undesirable” organisations to include state-sponsored entities in addition to nongovernmental organisations, The Moscow Times has reported.\n\nUnder a new law signed by Russian lawmakers, a list of “undesirable” foreign-funded NGOs drafted in 2015 has been amended to include independent news outlets, human rights groups, environmental organisations and educational institutions.\n\nThe Russian news outlet reported that members of “undesirable” organisations faced up to four years in prison and leaders up to six.\n\n“These groups must cease all operations inside Russia, and it is illegal for individuals and media outlets to republish or share their content,” the independent English-language and Russian-language online newspaper wrote.\n\nUkraine’s senior presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak has said “the root cause of any escalation”, including events in Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, was “unequivocal aggression” on the part of Russia.\n\n“War is war, with its own rules, where the aggressor inevitably reaps corresponding outcomes,” he added.\n\nThe comment appeared to be the first acknowledgment by a Ukrainian official of the ongoing incursion, which has entered its third day.\n\nRussia’s Kursk regional authorities have reported that Ukrainian forces have not advanced any further in their incursion but have instead been retreating.\n\nAccording to some reports, Ukrainian troops had advanced up to 15km (nine miles), and sources say the fighting is continuing.\n\nAccording to the Russian health ministry, 34 civilians including nine children have been hospitalised. Nine people including Rossiya-24 correspondent Yevgeny Poddubny were taken to Moscow for treatment.\n\nMilitary analysts are sceptical that this incursion will have an effect on the course of the war as Ukrainian forces do not have the means to hold the captured territory.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has spoken to Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide about Zelenskyy’s “peace formula”, a set of demands that includes Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine’s entire territory.\n\nKuleba said in a post on X that the two also addressed the shipment of F-16 fighter jets and the possibility of “expanding this initiative”.\n\nUkraine could soon unleash robot dogs on its front lines, replacing soldiers for perilous missions like spying on Russian trenches or detecting mines, the AFP has reported.\n\nAt a demonstration in an undisclosed part of Ukraine, the metallic dog known as model “BAD One” stood up, crouched, ran and jumped according to commands transmitted by its operator.\n\n“This dog limits the risk for soldiers and increases operational capabilities. This is the core function of the dog,” an operator working for a British company providing military equipment told AFP journalists.\n\nA more advanced model, known as “BAD Two” could not be shown for security reasons.\n\n“I can’t say how many we deployed” in Ukraine, the operator said. “But it will have a significant impact on the operations and increase the safety of soldiers.”\n\nUkraine has not been contacted by Russia about the Sudzha gas transit station after reports of hostilities at the plant, Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko has said.\n\nHe added that the gas transit route was still functioning.\n\nHeavy fighting near the Russian town of Sudzha, where Russian gas flows into Ukraine, has raised concerns over a sudden stop to transit flows via Ukraine before a five-year deal with Russia’s Gazprom expires.\n\nThe Ukraine gas transit route enables Russia to export gas to Europe. The transit deal is set to expire at the end of the year. Kyiv has previously said it has no plans to renew or extend it.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised the Ukrainian army for its ability “to surprise” and achieve results, making no direct reference to the cross-border assault in Russia’s Kursk region.\n\n“Everyone can see that the Ukrainian army knows how to surprise. And knows how to achieve results,” Zelenskyy said at an event to unveil a new digital app to cut paperwork for the military.\n\n“This is demonstrated by the battlefield, where our soldiers not only withstood the overwhelming force of the occupiers, but also are destroying it in the way necessary to protect Ukraine – our state and independence”, he said in a video from the presentation posted on Telegram messenger.\n\nUkrainian soldiers have entered western Russia in a move that has bewildered Moscow, successfully tested its weak border defences and may deal a blow to its natural gas supplies to Europe.\n\nThe raid follows several incursions by Russian nationals fighting for Ukraine who briefly raided Kursk and neighbouring Belgorod in 2023 and heavy Ukrainian shelling of Belgorod this year.\n\nBut Sudzha, a Russian border town that Ukrainian forces are now approaching, is important as the location of the only pumping station that delivers Russian natural gas to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nRead our story here.\n\nDnipropetrovsk regional military administration chief Serhiy Lysak has said Russian troops “aimed artillery at a hospital” in the southeastern city of Nikopol, located on the Dnipro river across from Russian-controlled areas, killing a 50-year-old man.\n\nUkraine’s police said they were evacuating children from the most dangerous areas of the Donetsk region and had brought out more than 1,000 in three days, with 3,723 more needing to be moved.\n\nThe death brings the toll to at least five civilians killed in front-line Ukrainian regions since the morning.\n\nA Ukrainian official has said a young man and his six-year-old brother have been killed by a Russian guided bomb that hit a schoolyard as Moscow troops stepped up air strikes on the northern Sumy region, bordering Russia’s Kursk region.\n\nVolodymyr Artiukh, head of the Sumy region’s military administration, told national TV that the two were killed in the town of Mohrytsia. He also added the area had seen an unprecedented number of air strikes.\n\n“Sumy region has never known such a large number per day,” he said, referring to 56 guided bombs dropped by Russia in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkraine’s Foreign Ministry has said Niger’s decision to cut diplomatic ties with Kyiv was “regrettable” and based on groundless and untrue allegations.\n\n“It is regrettable that the authorities of Niger have decided to terminate diplomatic relations with Ukraine without conducting any investigation into the incident in Mali or providing any evidence as to the reasons for such a step,” the ministry said.\n\nNiger’s military government said on Tuesday it was acting in solidarity with Mali which earlier broke off ties with Kyiv over remarks by a Ukrainian military intelligence official that it said showed Kyiv’s support for rebels fighting in northern Mali.\n\nRussia has accused Ukraine of opening a “second front” in the war between them in Africa after Mali and Niger broke off diplomatic relations with Kyiv, accusing it of supporting “terrorist groups”.\n\nRussian prosecutors have asked for a 15-year sentence in the treason trial of a Russian-American woman who has pleaded guilty, Russian news agencies report.\n\nKsenia Khavana, whom Russian authorities identify by her maiden name of Karelina, was arrested in Yekaterinburg in February, accused of collecting money for Ukraine’s military.\n\nShe pleaded guilty in the closed trial on Wednesday, news reports said. Russia’s Interfax news agency quoted her lawyer Mikhail Mushalov as saying the sentencing is expected on August 15.\n\nKhavana reportedly obtained US citizenship after marrying an American and moving to Los Angeles. She had returned to Russia to visit her family.\n\nRights groups said the charges stem from a $51 donation to a US charity that helps Ukraine. Russia’s Federal Security Service claims she “proactively collected money in the interests of one of the Ukrainian organisations, which was subsequently used to purchase tactical medical supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition for the Ukrainian armed forces.”\n\nThe Ukrainian president has met with a bipartisan delegation of the US House of Representatives to discuss air defence and ways to stop “any attempts by Russia to prolong this war”, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X.\n\n“We talked about defending our country and our values from Russian terror,” Zelenskyy wrote before thanking the United States for its support.\n\nIn a separate post, he also said that “F-16s are already in Ukrainian skies, and there will be more”.\n\nUS-made F-16 fighter jets had been long sought after by Ukraine to protect its skies against Russian missiles. Zelenskyy said Ukraine “combined political, diplomatic, and military efforts for this purpose” and “gradually, step by step, we managed to achieve the result”.\n\nAt least two people were killed when Russian troops shelled the town of Kostiantynivka in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, according to the regional governor.\n\nVadym Filashkin said on Telegram that the strike hit a residential district of the town in the morning.\n\nUkrainian-held parts of the Donetsk region regularly come under Russian shelling and air strikes. Russian forces control a large part of the region, which Moscow claims, along with four other Ukrainian regions, as its own territory."
