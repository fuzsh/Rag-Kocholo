Have an account? .\n\nWhen Putin declared war on Ukraine, he expected to quickly seize the country's capital, Kyiv.\n\nBut after over 10 months of war, the city of nearly 3 million people remains in Ukrainian hands.\n\nBefore Kyiv was thrust into the global spotlight, it proudly boasted a rich and robust history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv is widely believed to have been established over 1,500 years ago in the late 400s. Legend tells of three brothers — Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv — who led a tribe of East Slavs to the region.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nDuring the ninth century, the city was captured and became the capital of the first East Slavic state called Kyivan Rus.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout the 10th and 11th centuries, Kyivan Rus was the largest and most powerful state in Europe.\n\nSource: Britannica, CIA\n\nIn the 11th century, the first foundations for the Saint Sophia Cathedral were laid. It took years to complete.\n\nSource: The Museum of St. Sophia Cathedral\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cathedral is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nBut Kyiv's power declined by the late 12th century, as it was weakened by internal struggles, and later captured and destroyed by the Mongols.\n\nSource: Britannica, CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the mid-1300s, Kyiv became a part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the 17th century, Ukrainian nationalism was beginning to rise.\n\nSource: Britannica, CIA\n\nThe Russian Empire took control of Kyiv through the 1686 Treaty of Eternal Peace with Poland, and around 100 years later, most Ukrainian territory — including Kyiv — was part of the empire.\n\nSource: Britannica, CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the mid-1700s, Empress Elizabeth of Russia ordered the construction of the baroque Mariinsky Palace, which would later serve as the residence for presidents.\n\nSource: Kyiv Post\n\nKyiv soon became a hub for Ukrainian nationalism.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city's economic power also grew as Kyiv's industry spread in the coming decades.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nGrain was a significant export for Kyiv, which soon became connected to Moscow and Odessa by rail, allowing more growth. The city also saw the rise of textile production, tobacco processing, distilling, brewing, and leather making.\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the 1917 Russian revolution, Ukraine became an independent state for just a few years with Kyiv as its capital. The city withstood a short German occupation during World War I before it eventually became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, part of the Soviet Union.\n\nSource: Britannica, CIA\n\nAs a Soviet state, Ukraine — and Kyiv — endured famine and devastation during World War II.\n\nSource: CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine remained a Soviet state until it gained its independence in 1991, and established diplomatic relations with the US. But the country remained on the frontlines of a struggle between pro-European Western values, and those of Russia to the east.\n\nSource: State Department\n\nIn 2004, demonstrators took to the streets in Kyiv to protest against a rigged presidential election. A new, internationally monitored vote brought pro-West Viktor Yushchenko to power.\n\nSource: CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2013, police in Kyiv under pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych led a violent crackdown against protesters who opposed his rule.\n\nSource: CIA\n\nAfter months of demonstrations, pro-West Petro Poroshenko became Ukraine's president in 2014, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy succeeded him five years later.\n\nSource: CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore entering politics and becoming the leader of Ukraine, Zelenskyy was a comedian and TV star. As president, he enjoyed solid popularity.\n\nSource: Insider, The Wilson Center\n\nKyiv has a moderate climate, and the city is defined by high-rise buildings, church spires, and golden domes. It also held one of Ukraine's many Christmas markets.\n\nSource: Britannica, Visit Ukraine\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv has numerous historic and tourist attractions, like St. Sophia's Cathedral or the Great Patriotic War Museum. Locals could pass the time by watching soccer, or visiting one of the city's many art museums.\n\nSource: Lonely Planet, Visit Kyiv Ukraine\n\nKyiv is still a major administrative hub and industrial center, with lots of manufacturing factories. The population grew to 3 million by 2022.\n\nSources: Britannica, CIA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut on February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launching an assault on Kyiv. He expected the city to fall within days.\n\nSource: Insider\n\nOver 300 days later, Kyiv has withstood waves of missile and drone attacks — but remains in Ukrainian hands.\n\nSource: Insider\n\nRead next\n\nUkraine Russia History\n\nAdvertisement"
