        "text": "ISTANBUL\n\nLocal authorities in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv have decided to tighten security measures in the city after recent missile strikes by Russia, an official said.\n\nSerhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram that an urgent meeting of the Kyiv Defense Council was held regarding security in the country’s capital, where risks have increased due to quick missile strikes and subversive actions.\n\nHe said that the council would review the staging of public events and boost security around large gatherings.\n\n“Separate monitoring of social networks will be carried out regarding the spread of disinformation, provocations and other information aimed at destabilizing the situation in the capital,” Popko added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine’s Security Service said it detained a group of Russian “agents” preparing missile strikes on military personnel, as well as energy and telecommunications facilities, in three regions, including Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this week, 10 people were injured in Kyiv’s Pecherskyi district following a missile strike that damaged a non-residential building."
