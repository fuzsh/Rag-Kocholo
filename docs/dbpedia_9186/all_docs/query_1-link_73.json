        "text": "Amid an intense fight between Ukraine and Russia, there seems to be some confusion going around regarding the capital city of Kyiv.\n\nYou might have encountered two sets of spellings of Ukraine’s capital: Kiev and Kyiv.\n\nSeveral analysts and reporters have been pronouncing it differently: Kyiv (KEEV) and Kiev (Key-EV).\n\nThe difference in spelling and pronunciation, however, is not due to ignorance; rather, the words highlight a deeper meaning and have a historical context for the ongoing Russian conflict.\n\nIs it Kyiv or Kiev?\n\nUkrainians call their capital \"Kyiv\" (kee-yiv)​​​​. While Russia refers it to as \"Kiev\" (kee-yev), the transliteration from the Russian Cyrillic.\n\nKyiv gets its name from one of its legendary founders, Kyi.\n\nAccording to an Old East Slavic folklore, three brothers named Kyi, Shchek, and Khoryv founded the mediaeval city of Kyiv.\n\nBefore Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, it was part of the Soviet Union (or USSR).\n\nAlso read | Ukraine invasion: What sanctions have been imposed on Russia?\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the capital city was referred to as \"Kiev\" internationally and also in the first years of this century.\n\nBut it is now associated with the Russianification of Ukraine.\n\nIn recent years, more and more publications, governments, airports, and geographical dictionaries have switched the spelling to the Ukrainian variant.\n\nWhen did Kiev become Kiev?\n\nFollowing Ukraine's independence from the USSR in 1991, several regulations were introduced regarding the national guidance for transliterating place names from Cyrillic to Latin alphabets.\n\nSoon, legislative and official acts and documents from Ukrainian officials started using Kyiv.\n\nBut the Western media continued to use the old Soviet-era spelling.\n\nAlso read | Russian forces capture Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, says official\n\nHence, in 2018, the # CorrectUA campaign was launched by the Foreign Ministry to promote the official spellings of Ukrainian places in an effort to move on from the Russian derivative of the name."
