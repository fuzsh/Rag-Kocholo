        "text": "With the advent of warming weather, the capital has felt alive. But from time to time, the idyll is shattered by an air raid warning, and at night the city periodically shudders from explosions. Find out how Kyiv residents live now\n\nEverything comes to life in spring, and the capital of Ukraine is no exception. After more than a year of war, Ukrainians have adapted to the new conditions and are trying to live a normal life. Read our article to find out how Kyiv lives today and what has changed over the year.\n\nWhat has changed in 2023?\n\nThis year brought positive changes: people started returning to Kyiv. According to the mayor of the capital, Vitali Klitschko, 3.6 million people now live in Kyiv. For comparison, in March 2022, there were up to 1 million people left in Kyiv, as most of them left in search of a safer place.\n\nIs it safe in Kyiv now?\n\nAlmost every night in May, Kyiv residents heard air raid warnings. In particular, on May 16, one of the largest and most intense missile attacks took place. But our air defense forces shot down all enemy targets. Kyiv remains the No. 1 target for the aggressor, so the city is reliably defended.\n\nMany thanks to everyone who serves in the Armed Forces of Ukraine!\n\nVisit Ukraine on social media: Telegram | YouTube | Instagram | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok\n\nRestrictions of martial law in the capital\n\nKyiv's residents know by heart the rules that must be followed. But guests of the capital should keep in mind the following restrictions:\n\n- Curfew is in effect from 24:00 to 5:00;\n\n- there will be no beach season in the capital;\n\n- rafting on the Dnipro is also prohibited.\n\nPrices for rental housing in Kyiv\n\nThe return of people to Kyiv has also revitalized the real estate market. As demand increased, so did rental prices.\n\nAs recently as last summer, prices were 45% below market levels. In certain parts of the capital, it was possible to rent a one-bedroom apartment for UAH 8,000. Before the war, similar housing cost UAH 13,000. Currently, prices are returning to pre-war levels, and experts predict a rise in prices in the future.\n\nBusiness in new realities\n\nThe war is still on, and the streets are full of anti-tank guns and people in uniform. However, Kyiv residents lead active lifestyles and have fun. Open coffee shops, shopping malls, theaters and museums provide an opportunity to escape from the war and enjoy life.\n\nUkrainians realize that there is no need to postpone life and the realization of dreams until later. Life is too short, so Kyiv residents are realizing their plans: opening cafes, shops and buying real estate.\n\nThere is no need to consider such financial investments as a waste. After all, every business - large and small - stimulates the country's economy and creates jobs for the population.\n\nTourism in Ukraine\n\nEven in times of war, tourism services are in demand. Ukrainians and foreigners can travel to the most picturesque places in our country and have a European-level vacation.\n\nAre you planning a vacation in Ukraine? Great, because even in times of war, tourism in Ukraine continues to function.
