I caught the bus from Bilbao to Pamplona and then to St Jean Pied de Port, not sure if there's a bus to Roncesvalles.

There is a bus service from Bilbao to Pamplona. I was checking timetables recently, and was dismayed to see no availability for my proposed travel date.The company is La Burundesa, but Omio is a site where they are very helpful for finding tickets for many bus companies. I rang the number they gave for Ireland, as I live here. So it doesn't matter if you don't have enough Spanish. Having reached Pamplona, there is a local bus to Roncesvalles. It takes around an hour. Tickets can be bought in the bus station, or I imagine, on the bus. No booking, it is a local service bus. Here is a screenshot, and a link to the website where I found this information for you. I have no idea if the local bus will be running now that the high season is over, but I know someone who used to travel on it every week day before Covid, so it is not a ghost bus, it does travel. Buen camino, when it comes.\n\nhttps://vivecamino.com/en/roncesvalles/ tap the thumbnail to enlarge the image."
