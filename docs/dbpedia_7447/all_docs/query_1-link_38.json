        "text": "ACPRail shows results for Renfe trains, but it only shows some Renfe trains, and doesn’t show competitors’ options. The search results page shows only three possibilities, which leaves you clicking quite a bit to try to compare prices through the day for a particular journey. The results that it does offer are more expensive in our tests than purchasing through Trainline, Renfe, or other options. And there is a booking fee on top of that.\n\nRailEurope (formerly Loco2, and now owned by the company that owns SNCF) works just as smoothly as Trainline and Omio, and has the same prices, but tacks on a booking fee that is generally a bit higher (though at least Rail Europe is transparent and declares its fees for each currency up front). Its European coverage is also not quite as extensive in general; it shows Ouigo but not other competing rail companies in Spain. I do like that it’s a quite usable site, up front in search results about the booking fee, and not polluted with a lot of extra add-ons. In its previous incarnations RailEurope/Loco2 was once our top pick for European train booking, and it could still make sense for some countries in certain cases, but it’s missing out on too many of the competing rail operators in Spain to be worth it here.\n\nIn our tests with complex routes involving various countries, Trainline performed better than RailEurope — the routes it proposed were cheaper, shorter, and with fewer changes.\n\nRome2Rio shows results for Spanish trains that are apparently taken from Omio (discussed above), so you might as well just use that instead.\n\nPetrabax.com: This is Renfe’s partner for the USA and shows only Renfe tickets in US dollars with a bit of a markup as compared to the other sites. There’s no real reason to choose it, even if you’re American, as you can use an American credit card to purchase from any of the other options listed here. It also tacks on an expensive service fee.\n\nRail.ninja consistently showed much higher fares in our test searches than what Renfe charges, and doesn’t seem to offer tickets with any of the competitors to Renfe. I like it that there is a pop-up next to these fares with a picture of the seating and some train information, although it was outdated. But that’s hardly worth the prices.\n\nThe French national train company’s website, SNCF Connect (formerly known as “Voyages-SNCF” and “OUI.sncf”) tries to sell Spanish tickets but doesn’t tend to work so well, and we’ve previously discussed the problems foreigners have with using it even for tickets in France itself.\n\nIt is very difficult to find English and other languages; to get there scroll to bottom and then back up part way within the black footer on the right side to where it says “country choice” and, for English, choose “Europe (other countries)”.\n\nThe search feature doesn’t have different fields for your origin, destination, and dates. There is instead one box, where you’re supposed to type a phrase about the type of trip you want. It doesn’t work, of course. But after you type something there that it misinterprets, you will get a more traditional trip search feature with origin, destination, and date search fields.\n\nPreviously the SNCF had a great “flexible dates” feature, but that has now been eliminated. It’s good to see that Trainline has since added it.\n\nOnce you get results, you’ll be able to book trips on Renfe trains. Ouigo trains are also shown, but infuriatingly, there is no button to actually buy those trips.\n\nPrices are not shown in search results; you have to click through to screens after the search results to see the prices. Then you are taken to a screen that sometimes doesn’t even show the trip that you originally clicked on, but does show prices. But these SNCF-Connect prices can be extremely inflated compared to booking on Trainline, RailEurope, or Renfe; one recent search showed a Madrid-to-Barcelona AVE train via SNCF-Connect at four times the cost of any of those other sites.\n\nSNCF’s sites were never good for booking for France and are just terrible for Spain; it’s striking to see how they’ve gotten even more difficult to use and bizarre over the years and many crazy redesigns.\n\nSpainrail.com offers Renfe tickets only and does so with a larger booking fee markup than our main pick. It appears to be a version of Railclick.com, and since these sites’ terms of use are not properly translated and there are a few other red flags we’re not recommending them at all.\n\nTrenes.com sells legitimate train tickets, it seems, but is not a good or useful train booking site. It comes up in a lot of Google Search Ads for trains. It has the advantage of offering all Spanish train operators: Ouigo, Avlo, Iryo, and Ave, as well as slower Renfe trains. But in my searches it doesn’t seem to be able to make combinations of these when that would be suitable, so we miss out on good deals that any of our top-pick platforms can snag. Trenes.com is also very sneaky about how it includes its booking fee (around 5-6% in tests): the price of tickets suddenly goes up a bit on the final payment screen with no explanation unless you click on “details” and then find an “included services: all expenses and fees” (whatever that means) alongside what is essentially a booking fee.\n\nKombo.co advertises as offering Renfe train tickets for Spain, but in my searches did not actually show any tickets for the most basic routes, even for Barcelona to Madrid. Its results were instead first for flights, which is an evil thing to propose when we’re seeking such a short, fun train ride on a disastrously warming planet. It showed no results for trains. Avoid this platform.\n\nSpanishTrains.com is another well-advertised but useless booking site; it just sends us over to Rail Ninja for the actual train booking search results, which as noted above showed us overpriced fares compared to our main pick booking platforms."
