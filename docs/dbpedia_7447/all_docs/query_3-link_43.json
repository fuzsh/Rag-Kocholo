        "text": "Here I am, plotting another Camino, and since I want to go sooner rather than later, and since Mary posted such a beautiful film of her VDLP walk, and I have no intention to encounter winter, VDLP is looking good.\n\nSo, I went to Rome2Rio and I still can't figure out which flights cost what. It tells me there are flights between 800$ and 1500$, clearly I am more interested in the 800$ option. But where do I see which option is which?\n\nThis is what I get: https://www.rome2rio.com/fr/s/Montréal/Séville - airlines, duration, days the flight combo flies, and again duration. Bit no mention of the price.\n\nI am on an Ipad. Could this be the problem?\n\nMy thanks to anyone who can help.\n\nWhen are you thinking of going?\n\nI tend to use Expedia to learn about the prices and combinations. Then I usually go to the airline site to do the booking, although I recently booked a trip directly on Expedia for the first time since they offered a better fare.\n\nEnd of January perhaps.\n\nI normally take a charter from Montreal to Madrid, Barcelon or Poeto, depending on the Camino, and then google for an internal flight, bus or train.\n\nIt is just aggravating that R2R gives you a hint of prices, but it doesn't show you where it came up with them. Show me inexpensive, I'll tell you when and with whom I fly.\n\nI find R2R extremely helpful as a tool to narrow the options of land travel possibilities in Europe (particularly trains and buses). It is not totally inclusive of everything possibility and totally depends on the companies offering the services to keep schedules and prices up to date -- so, I find that it is best to start with R2R, figure out the companies and paths and schedules might work, then link to those company's private websites and work on the details (pricing, schedules, bookings) from there. In almost every case, though, with further investigation, I will find other (less commercial) ways to get from point A to point B -- not better, necessarily, but other options. I will say that R2R has become my first source once I am on the ground in Europe and a great little tool to use directly off my phone once I am enroute and need to make a change in plans.\n\nThis is what I get: https://www.rome2rio.com/fr/s/Montréal/Séville - airlines, duration, days the flight combo flies, and again duration. Bit no mention of the price.\n\nI am on an Ipad. Could this be the problem?\n\nHi @Anemone del Camino Using your link, in chrome browser on Mac, I get sidebar on right. I click on flights to Sevilla, then click on the line Montreal(YUL) and a box opens with search area at the top for dates and times. When I put in dates and times, I get a list of\n\nflights and prices for those dates.\n\nI agree absolutely with @Sr.Bigote I find R2R immensely useful for land transport - combinations of coaches, buses, and trains are generally covered very well, and links to timetables are provided. I have often used it to identify the correct bus company in Spain for a particular trip, though I don't think I have ever used R2R to purchase a ticket. (I'm sorry that doesn't help them to make money! ) In my experience it works very well for France and UK too. So I find it a useful tool for trip planning."
