        "text": "We try and take a yearly vacation and visit new place in our travels. As some, we save to have the best time, see as much as we can for great value. Itâs always so helpful reading others experiences and thoughts. our trip to Germany last year we found amazing tours to several castles in a luxury coach. Trust me I was skeptical about spending a little extra $, but ready several different takes on it we were sold. Thank goodness we did, the other bus was packed as we had only30 people. It was amazing! We also used the advice of a smart travel in St. Lucia. A private van took us all over the island that the cost of a busy tour bus would of. Plus we weâre head of all the buses, so we beat the crowds.\n\nWe even use TripAdvisor for restaurants when we head to different cities through the year. Yes, people have different likes but reading other reviews helps us find some awesome handed treasures.\n\nI could go on and on, but you just need use it, itâs a great way to help with some many things. Make your life easy be advisedð\n\nPaid A LOT of money for my extended family of 7 to enjoy Ruthâs country dinner. When we arrived there was NOWHERE for us to sit. There were 2 seats we were able to find (@ different tables) and nothing else. The man who was to be singing/performing offered to disassemble a display table (card table) and gather some random chairs to accommodate some of my family which was super nice, but I felt like there should have been enough proper seating options for us. The girl setting things up was also so apologetic and tried to help best she could while my teenagers stood holding their plates and ate standing up. I went strait to the front desk where I was told I might find Julie (who I was told was in charge of these dinner reservations). The girls there gave me Julieâs business card with a cell phone and other contact info. I texted her and got an auto response letting me know that they had received my message and would be in touch. That was 3 days ago and still no contact from Julie or anybody for that matterâ¦ when I arrived back at the venue, someone had set up a table for my family in the blistering sun (to leave space for entertainment in the little left shade) with enough chairs and a proper table cover. I went to serve myself and there was maybe about a four of a cup of corn left and NO dessert left except watermelon. Just over all a huge disappointment and for the money I paid, just completely unacceptable."
