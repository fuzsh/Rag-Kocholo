Depending on the situation and weather, you could offer to share the ride with other pilgrims in similar circumstances. I usually just offer them a free ride if they are going to the same town up ahead as me.\n\nBuses are very much cheaper per km. BUT, many villages and small towns have very limited service as described above.\n\nI strongly endorse starting with the Rome-2-Rio app or website. Once you drill down enough to find the name of some of the contracting bus lines for a given route or area, see if they have a website or an app.\n\nIt is true that ALSA is the largest and national carrier, per se. But many provinces and regions contract more localized service to smaller, private companies.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nDonjek\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012 SJPdP - Fisterra\n\nDec 1, 2019\n\n#4\n\nThere is bus service to most villages. I don't know if they will stop to pick up flags between scheduled stops.\n\nOnce you get past Astorga most of the camino is located away from roads wide enough for buses. If there is service its once per day at most and some places have no bus service at all.

Then try to explain to the dispatcher (if you have cell phone coverage) where it is that you are located.\n\nNow imagine doing that in Spanish.\n\nThere are not ranks of taxis waiting in every village on the camino in the hopes of getting a fare from a pilgrim. If you're going to walk be prepared to walk the full distance.\n\nJohn Sikora\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2021\n\nDec 1, 2019\n\n#6\n\nFor all my Caminos, I like to plan a bail out on all probable segments. You never know whether blisters, lack of sleep, weather or some other factor will force your hand.\n\nI, like others, use rome2rio to do the initial check. That usually tells you whether there are any alternatives available (bus,train). You then have to look at the schedules and see if they match. Some towns are great for service, others have service only the morning or only in the evening, and weekends are a crapshoot.\n\nOnce you figure this out, you have your backstop with not a lot of effort.\n\nAnd, as others have said correctly, there are always taxis. Perhaps a little expensive depending on your budget but usually reliable, run by locals so they know the area and trails well, and most restaurants, hotels, bars, and cafes are more than happy to give them a call (sparing you the language events).\n\nt2andreo\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2013 - 2018 , Pilgrim Office volunteer 2014 - 2022\n\nDec 1, 2019\n\n#7\n\nJohn:\n\nIn my former line of work this was called always having a Plan B to get you safely out of any dicey situation. At least it prevented embarrassing stations, and at worst avoided injury, to me or someone else.\n\nIn retirement, and on Camino, it means, to have previously assessed your situation and circumstances, adapted a plan to address this issue or problem, and then simply the plan to overcome the challenge. You encapsulated this very well.\n\nAssess, adapt and overcome. Having that 'float plan\" in your mental pocket at the start of each day also helps remove any stress or anxiety some of us might feel. I do. I make these sort of plans all the time. I do not like surprises...unless they are very good surprises.\n\nRome2Rio remains the best initial go-to app. Once you an identify the local bus route operator licensed by the local government, or have the requisite app you know, from the provider (bus or rail), then have at it.\n\nTaxis make a good fall back, just in case.\n\nMontana Jayne\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSeptember 2015 - Camino Frances\n\n? Camino Ingles\n\nDec 2, 2019\n\n#8\n\nHi all\n\nCan someone plse tell me is there are buses between towns daily even early evening? Failing that are their always taxis available around this time?\n\nFriend from Barquinha\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nNone yet; perhaps the Portugese (2021?)\n\nDec 7, 2019\n\n#9\n\nFrom my observations in rural Portugal and Greece. (I would suspect the same is true in rural Spain.)\n\nThe local bus services are set up for local priorities. Thus the networks are typically planned so people from small villages can get to larger market towns once or twice a day (in the morning), and back in the late afternoon before dinner. Similarly, high school students tend to use them to get to the bigger town hubs where there are enough students for secondary schools to be practical. Then in the afternoon they go back to their home towns/villages. It usually turns out to be sheer luck if you can find a bus from one small town to another!\n\nTrying to get from town to town in the evening is pretty challenging. Taxis are the practical alternative (and you're generally supporting a local family business, as well).\n\nBom caminho!\n\ntaigirl\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019\n\nDec 7, 2019\n\n#10\n\nHi all\n\nCan someone plse tell me is there are buses between towns daily even early evening?

They will show you.\n\nI got interviewed by a spanish lady in Galicia (student who was engaged to interview pilgrims / tourists) who wanted to know amongst other things what could be improved for pilgrims / tourists in Spain.\n\nI told her, that I liked everything very much, everything was fine, except sometimes - if in need - it would be nice to be able to recognize the bus stops easily. She laughed and told me that even spanish people also have problems finding bus stops in environments that are unfamiliar to them and need to ask .\n\ntaigirl\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019\n\nDec 8, 2019\n\n#13\n\nWe did ask a local.

Now, ask yourself do you wish to walk several kilometers to a bus stop. Or, take bus to an in-between town then walk from there.

Also, we found that you can usually ask in the local bar about taxi service and they'll know if one is available. And there usually is, at least on the Frances, and they'll call for you. Taxis don't seem to be as readily available on the Norte. One time on the Norte, we'd found ourselves walking a lot further than expected and had foot problems. We asked in a restaurant about a taxi to take us the last 10 kilometers and the owner said it would be too expensive to take a taxi because the taxi would have to come from pretty far away. Then he thought a minute and said \"Come on. Get in my car. I'll take you.\""
