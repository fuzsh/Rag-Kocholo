Type c and press Enter in the console to continue from the breakpoint.\n\nMore documentation on UC Mode here: SeleniumBase/help_docs/uc_mode.md\n\nThe SeleniumBase driver includes all the original driver methods, plus new ones.\n\nI believe solving the captcha by using 2Captcha's or some other captcha solving service's API would be a more reliable solution than trying to evade detection. They might not be free, but their pricing is not an issue for most applications at 1-2$/1000 requests depending on the captcha type."
