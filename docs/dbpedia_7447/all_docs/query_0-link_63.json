        "text": "2024\n\n12\n\nAugust\n\nVancouver to Tokyo, Japan - $679 to $899 CAD roundtrip [Nonstop Flights]\n\nZipair has loaded their schedule for flights operating between November 2024 and March 2025.\n\nSimilar to when they first introduced their flights, they are offering nonstop flights between Vancouver and Tokyo, Japan (NRT) for $679 to $899 CAD roundtrip.\n\nThe nonstop flights are in and out of Tokyo's Narita Airport (NRT).\n\nZipair is a subsidiary of Japan Airlines.\n\nThings to note about Zipair:\n\n- Zipair aims to offer flights to Japan that are significantly cheaper than their competitors (Air Canada, ANA, and Japan Airlines here in Vancouver).\n\n(Note: Zipair is actually owned by Japan Airlines).\n\nHowever, Zipair does not include *anything* in their base fares, other than a small piece of hand luggage. Seat selection, actual carry-on, checked bags, and even meals are all extra.\n\n- If you want to quickly compare Zipair against their competitors, add about $220 CAD roundtrip to their cheapest prices. This is the typical cost of their 'Value' or 'Flex Biz' packages which includes things like carry-on or a checked bag and seat selection.\n\n- So as of right now, these flights are really around $679 + $220 roundtrip, or $899 CAD roundtrip. For comparison, the cheapest prices with Air Canada, ANA, and Japan Airlines for a nonstop flight are currently $1470 CAD roundtrip.\n\nZipair 'Full Flat' Class\n\nZipair also offers something called 'Full Flat'' class with lie-flat seats that are significantly cheaper than Business Class fares offered by competitors.\n\nBut again, this Full Flat class is stripped down to it's bare minimum. Full Flat is essentially Economy with a better seat. That's all you get.\n\nYou still need to pay extra for things that would normally be included on a typical Business Class flight (bags, seat selection, and inflight meals).\n\nPriority check-in, baggage handling or boarding, and lounge access are also not included.\n\nAlso note that in Full Flat there are no built in screens. You bring your own device and stream entertainment wirelessly.\n\nAvailability for travel\n\nLate October, November, December 2024\n\nJanuary, February, March 2025\n\nHow to find and book this deal\n\n1. Go to the ZIPAir website\n\n2. Change the currency from $USD to $CAD (near the top right of the page)\n\n3. Search for a flight from Vancouver (YVR) to Tokyo, Japan (NRT)\n\n4. Try dates starting in late October 2024.\n\nMost dates between late October 2024 and February 2025 are currently $360 on the way there and $320 on the way home. Dates in March are $87 more roundtrip.\n\n5. You can also try starting with this Google Flights search.
