Finding a comprehensive listing of the timetable is impossible.\n\nSo I thought we should make one. I wanted to show you all this after I have got back as I will do a lot of work on the ground, but I thought you'd like to see where I am at so far\n\nhttp://www.chalo.org.uk (temp domain name)\n\nIt's quite an impressive network, outside China India Japan and I guess Korea, I dont think anyone else in Asia has as much, certainly not as many different services. Here is a kml file you can best view in google earth. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7965866/comp.kml\n\nIt's not ready for publication yet. Apart from anything else the data, while grabbed mainly from the main website and tripbd, is highly dubious. I need to verify stuff with my own eyes and get something like a complete data set. I am currently working on getting a front facing db interface so that service providers, and ultimately anyone, can update data.\n\nAnyway, Bangladesh, the Forgotten (Railway) Kingdom. Let's make anything more adventurous than Dhaka to Chittagong/Sylhet or Khulna achievable for the masses. Once we've got all the details worked out on this we can build one of these for anywhere that's got two rails and not much of a website.\n\nHi Mark,\n\nI'd be interested to see what you've done for this, but the url isn't resolving at the moment...\n\nI crawled a pretty-complete set of Chinese train times, geo-located the stations and recorded the results to a database to power a map-hack of Chinese trains when searching from A to B. That was in ~2009 when I lived in Shanghai and I've been trying to find a copy recently.\n\nI'm quite impressed with the coverage of routes on rome2rio.com - unfortunately they don't cover Bangladesh yet, but they do cover India, China, Russia + Central Asia. Here's a sample:\n\nhttp://www.rome2rio.com/s/Jammu/Thiruvananthapuram\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn"
