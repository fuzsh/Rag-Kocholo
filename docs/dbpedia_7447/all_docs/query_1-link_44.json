        "text": "At a time when Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Donmez is announcing seismic surveys south of Crete, one of the world's leading online travel platforms names the Greek island as \"Ottoman Crete\".\n\nReactions have been provoked by one of the world's leading online travel platforms based in Australia, which displays Crete on its website as \"Ottoman\".\n\nRome2rio is a travel information platform that helps, among other things, the travellers to reach to any location in the world by choosing the best possible option.\n\nIn one of the searches, the website suggests \"7 ways to get from Fatih (Istanbul Municipality) to Ottoman Crete…\"!\n\nSpeaking to SBS Greek, the President of the Cretan Federation of Australia & New Zealand, Mr. Antonis Tsourdalakis, stated that legal proceedings have been initiated against the online travel platform, while the Federal Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Mr David Coleman and Victoria’s Multicultural Affairs Minister, Mr Ros Spence, have also been informed.\n\n\"We know about the posting of this website, we have also informed the lawyers of our federation. We are in contact with the embassy and the consulate and several letters have already been written to the competent ministers, while the Police have also been informed about this \", he said.\n\nThe Greek Program of SBS Radio contacted the company via email to comment on what is written on its website, without, however, having received any response so far.\n\nThe travel platform rome2rio, based in Australia and Amsterdam, was the brainchild of Bernie Tschirren and Michael Cameron, who, according to their website, met at a pub in 2007.\n\nThree years later they set up their business in Melbourne."
