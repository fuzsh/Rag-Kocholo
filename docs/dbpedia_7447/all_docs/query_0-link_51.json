        "text": "Manizales is nestled in the heart of coffee country and surrounded by forested mountains. This beautiful mountain city has a population of just over 450,000 people.\n\nManizales sits at an elevation of 7,000 feet. Its annual temperature stays near a cool 63 F. The daily average high temperature ranges from 69 F to 72 F and can dip down to the chilly mid-50s F range at night. While there is little need for air conditioning, some people may have small heaters or electric blankets in their homes to stay comfortable while they sleep. The fresh mountain breeze and almost daily rainfall keeps the air clean and minimizes pollution.\n\nFounded in 1849, Manizales lies in the shadow of Nevado del Ruiz, the second most active volcano in Colombia. It is located in Los Nevados National Natural Park, one of Colombia’s most visited natural attractions. As a university city, residents benefit from the latest research and technology from private care providers at competitive rates. Manizales is also a destination for spa, natural health, and medical tourism services and facilities.\n\nManizales is a reasonably quiet, medium-sized city situated in the Colombian Andes. It’s the capital of the Caldas department and is close to Nevado del Ruiz, one of Colombia’s most active volcanoes. It’s within the coffee region and is surrounded by beautiful greenery and rolling hills. Manizales is part of the coffee region in Colombia and is actually one of the main producers of coffee in the country. As well as being known for friendly people (duh, what part of Colombia isn’t?) and coffee culture, Manizales is also a university city and an education hub.\n\nBy Plane: There is no way to fly directly into Manizales if you’re coming from an international destination.
