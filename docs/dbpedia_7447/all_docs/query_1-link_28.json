If you search on that site it will open a booking tab as well as show the results in the regular tab.\n\nIs there a way I can block booking.com \"popup\" tabs in vivaldi?\n\nIf not, is there a good extension for this?\n\nPlease only recommend an extension you think that will work (not just because the name says popup blocking)\n\nI need to block booking.com new tabs (that I did not open myself, sometimes I do want to look at booking.com)\n\neither blocking them just on rome2rio.com or blocking them globally is fine (as long as I can open myself a booking.com tab from bookmarks or typing in the url, or as a result of a google search)\n\nAlso, having a tab open and then say \"blocked\", like might happen with, say, a \"focus\" extension that blocks sites for you when you want to focus, is not a good solution for this problem. So I'm not looking for that kind of extension.\n\nAlso any blocking extension should not have a huge amount of bloat - like say the ability to block ads.\n\nAny ideas?"
