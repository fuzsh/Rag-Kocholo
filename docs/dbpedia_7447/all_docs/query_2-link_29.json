        "text": "What about the logistics of getting to Florence?\n\nIf you are flying into Rome or another large city, Italy has an amazing train transit system, including high-speed trains, and it’s quite efficient to get between cities with many departures daily. Please use the wedding concierge to help with the logistics if you would like assistance. Contact Viviana at this email: margaretandtim@italianweddingplanners.com\n\nWhere will we be staying the night of Jun 29 after the welcome dinner in Florence?\n\nWe reserved a block of rooms at Hotel Cavour (this is the hotel the rooftop dinner and party are at). We are asking each guest to pay for their room this night at checkout (approx 350EUR per room).\n\nHow do we get from Florence to Borgo Argiano on the 30th?\n\nWe are arranging transportation as part of the wedding to move the entire group of us from Hotel Cavour (at checkout time) to Borgo Argiano. No need to worry about this.\n\nDo I have to pay for anything at Borgo Argiano?\n\nThe wedding is all inclusive and includes your room and meals.\n\nWhat if I get hungry between events and meals while there?\n\nEach room is an apartment and has a small kitchenette. We are arranging for the group to stop at a grocery store so people can buy some snacks and/or food to stock their apartment if they would like.\n\nDo I bring a gift?\n\nIn lieu of a gift we are asking people to donate to the Champaign County CASA fund if you would like to. Meg volunteers there and this organization assists kids that really need help. https://www.casa4kids.org/give\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nAt the welcome dinner in Florence on the 29th, it is formal and we request cocktail attire.\n\nUpon Arrival at Borgo Argiano on the 30th, we have a welcome tour and wine tasting, and this should be smart casual attire.\n\nThe evening of the 30th is the rehearsal dinner and it is also formal and cocktail attire. We are requesting people wear solid colors (no prints).\n\nJuly 1 is the wedding day and it is formal and ‘black tie’ (although ties are optional). We are requesting guests try to all wear black if possible. If not, then solid colors please.\n\nJuly 2 is the farewell event and both meals will be poolside in the cantina. Dress code is casual attire.\n\nOur photographer will be attending all of the events.\n\nHow do I get to my next destination after checkout on July 3rd at Borgo Argiano?\n\nWe are asking guests to arrange transportation to get to the destination they need to after the wedding. Our concierge, Viviana, can help you with any logistics.\n\nThere is time between scheduled wedding events and I want to explore. What can I do?\n\nYou would have to arrange your own excursion, and visit a nearby town (like Siena) or attraction. Our concierge, Viviana, can give you some guidance and help if you would like. You may be able to arrange things as you leave Borgo also. There is information compiled on the Travel tab here to get you some basic information.\n\nJuly is hot in Italy, will there be air conditioning?\n\nBorgo Argiano was recently renovated and has very powerful air conditioning and the entire estate is kept rather cool.\n\nI’d like more information about Borgo Argiano, where can I find that?\n\nThere is a lot of information on their website here: https://www.borgoargiano.com/en/\n\nI’d like more information about Hotel Cavour in Florence, where can I find that?\n\nHere is a link to Hotel Cavour: https://www.hotelcavour.com/\n\nIs there a website that helps navigate all the options of traveling within Italy?\n\nMeg and I love the site https://www.rome2rio.com/to help find the best way to get from city to city.\n\nDo I need a passport?\n\nYes. US passport processing takes a long time, so please check to be sure your passport is in a known location months in advance. Also check the expiration date. For travel to Italy, your US passport must be valid for at least three months beyond the period of stay.\n\nIf you have any questions about logistics, you can contact Meg or Tim directly, or you can email our wedding concierge, Viviana, at margaretandtim@italianweddingplanners.com.\n\nWe can’t wait to celebrate with everybody!!\n\nSIENA\n\nHalf a hour driving distance from Borgo Argiano, you find Siena, one of the most popular and visited places in Tuscany, a place extremely rich in history and art and with strong local traditions tied to its 17 districts (called “contrade”) and to the famous Palio di Siena, the biggest annual event that takes place twice each summer in the city.\n\nIf you visit Siena for the first time, I definitely recommend you to go straight into the heart of the city, to the beautiful Piazza del Campo, one of the landmarks of the city. You can decide to start your day in Siena right here or instead head towards the Duomo, returning to Piazza del Campo later. The main attractions of the city are located between Piazza del Campo and the Cathedral, so you’ll likely spend most of your time here anyway!\n\nSAN GIMIGNANO\n\nSan Gimignano, a small walled village about 50 min from Borgo Argiano, is famous for its fascinating medieval architecture and towers that rise above of all the other buildings offering an impressive view of the city from the surrounding valley.\n\nAt the height of its glory, San Gimignano's patrician families had built around 72 tower-houses as symbols of their wealth and power. Although only 14 have survived, San Gimignano still retains its feudal atmosphere and appearance.\n\nRecognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1990, San Gimignano offers visitors the chance to step back in time while enjoying its local products including saffron and its white wine, the Vernaccia di San Gimignano.\n\nSAFFRON FARM AND SAN GIMIGNANO DAY TOUR\n\nSan Gimignano remains in visitors' hearts as a city of golden light, splendid panoramas, refreshing straw-colored Vernaccia di San Gimignano, and a treasured gourmet food more expensive than its weight in gold: saffron.\n\nVia private luxury vehicle with English-speaking driver, you will explore the medieval town of San Gimignano and its picturesque Tuscan countryside. To follow you will be delighted by a unique, delicious lunch with locally produced saffron at a nearby organic saffron farm, a farm-to-table experience featuring authentic Tuscan ingredients and herbs.\n\nIf you are interested in booking a full day private Saffron farm and San Gimignano tour, please contact our concierge at: margaretandtim@italianweddingplanners.com\n\nMONTALCINO\n\nAbout one hour away you will find the wonderful town of Montalcino, a classic fairytale hilltop town, set within a full circle of fortified walls and watched over by a mighty castle of medieval perfection. Montalcino is a beautiful village immersed in the breathtaking Val d'Orcia Natural Park, renowned all over the world for the production of its precious Brunello red wine.\n\nThe town has scarcely changed in appearance since the 16th century. Once you get up to the town, a magnificent spectacle unfolds for your eyes: rolling sunny hills dotted with yellow and red flowers, ancient oak trees, picturesque olive groves, scenic country roads winding through perfect vineyards and isolated cypress trees atop hills.\n\nBRUNELLO WINE TOUR\n\nFor wine lovers, don't miss this opportunity to enjoy a full day of tasting the king of Italian red wines: Brunello di Montalcino.\n\nRemember that drink and drive is dangerous and forbidden.\n\nIf you are interested in booking a full day private wine tour in Montalcino, please contact our concierge at: margaretandtim@italianweddingplanners.com"
