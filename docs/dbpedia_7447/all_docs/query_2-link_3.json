        "text": "Poor Quality Checkout\n\nPoor Quality Checkout\n\nThe problem is they sold me a train ticket for a train in Spain (via RENFE) for the wrong date. I started my search entering the correct date of my trip - I am pretty sure - now only to find out that they sold me a ticket the same date of purchase.\n\nI find the checkout experience very poor. Why are they not highlighting in BOLD the date of your ticket and ask you to Review carefully. In their search and checkout process seems to be a function that resets the date of the ticket I suspect. Yes, it was my fault but I feel they didn't do anything to help me or prevent these kind of mistakes.\n\nI found out literally at the train station that they sold me a ticket for the wrong date and had to repurchase it. Luckily I managed to get on my train.\n\nPoor experience and poor quality checkout. Also follow-up emails and travel reminders are missing.\n\nConclusion. Do not just trust them, double check several times.\n\nDate of experience : August 12, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Jussara,\n\nThanks for taking the time to leave this review.\n\nWe're sorry to hear about your recent booking experience. Please email our Customer Support team at feedback@rome2rio.com with more details about the companies you booked with. We will be more than happy to look into this further to find out exactly what happened.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nAbove the Clouds Customer Service\n\nI am an independent traveler and I have used Rome2Rio many times. While attempting to book bus and train for a segment of a trip in Turkey, I used their site. It wouldn't allow me to book any of the shown transportation. I then emailed R2R customer service. Marissa patiently and thoroughly explained how, since their site is not offering these tockets at this time, I can book directly with the carriers (screen shots provided detailed directions). Above and beyond in customer service! Brian California\n\nDate of experience : August 06, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Brian,\n\nThanks for taking the time to leave this great review. Our Customer Support team takes great pride in their work and we're glad to hear that your experience was a positive one. We'll also be sure to pass on your kind words across to Marisa.\n\nWe appreciate your continuous support and hope you have a wonderful trip.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Rob,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to leave a review of our platform.\n\nRome2Rio manages information from thousands of transport operators around the world. Our team works hard to keep everything up to date and accurate so we’re sorry to hear that on this occasion the route we had shown was not up to standard.\n\nWe kindly ask if you could please email our team at feedback@rome2rio.com and provide us with the exact details you used for this transport search. Our team will then investigate this further and make any necessary updates.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nSuggesting long ways to get somewhere!!\n\nSometimes this website is good but then it suggests the worst ways to get somewhere! For example I was researching how to get to Italy from Avignon via Marseille. Instead of suggesting the train from Avignon Central to Vitrolles (Aeroport Marseille Provence) it suggests Avignon TGV to Aix TGV then a bus to Marseille Airport. So frustrating as I've taken this train a number of times there. Once you get off the train there is even a shuttle down to the airport. It's just lucky I spend so much time in Avignon that I know you take this way to Marseille airport if you're not driving!\n\nDate of experience : July 17, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Kristina,\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to leave a review of our platform.\n\nRome2Rio manages information from thousands of transport operators around the world.

They can actually book many for you. Plus the very quickly answer any question you have in real not IT language. I wish I had known them when planning my previous trip and am using them now for the forthcoming trip.I've told my friends and patients about the site and they love it too.\n\nDate of experience : April 01, 2024\n\nNothing Can Compare with Rome2Rio!\n\nNothing can compare with, \"Rome2Rio.\" I was introduced to the site by a fellow traveler. He showed me the app and I was amazed its default showed such detailed door-to-door information! As a test I queried from my house to the Pyramids of Giza. From the corner bus to light rail to airport to flight to shuttle to bus it was all right there. I was blown away. It's especially beneficial to those who are looking to travel by public transportation. Anyway, it's a life changer!\n\nDate of experience : January 22, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Jay,\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to leave this lovely review!\n\nRome2Rio prides itself on providing information to get you from A to B — literally door-to-door — so we're glad you found it helpful!\n\nWe're excited to hear of your adventures in the future. (Hopefully to the Pyramids!) Please feel free to share them and any other feedback with us via the app (Profile > Send Feedback) or email feedback@rome2rio.com.\n\nBest regards,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nConstant source of fake information\n\nThe Rome2Rio info on London is always wildly wrong! Usually it sends unsuspecting tourists in the wrong direction to a building that didn't exist in a borough 5 miles away from the destination.\n\nToday I was trying to look up routes from Customs House to the Excel Centre (which is about 10 minutes away) and by default it provided the following 'information':\n\n\"The fastest way to get from Customs House to ExCeL London is to fly which takes 27h 48m and costs $800 - $2,300. More details...\"\n\nDate of experience : June 13, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi Arabella,\n\nThanks for your feedback. We’ve had a look ourselves, it would seem that perhaps the Excel Centre was mistaken for a similarly named place in another country, as there are many around the world. If you are every unsure of a location you can type or paste in the actual address. Given we cover over 194 countries, it’s understandable that place names can exist elsewhere.\n\nIf you have any further concerns about London please email feedback@rome2rio.com with specific details so that we can investigate further.\n\nThanks,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio\n\nSometimes I make several trip plans and…\n\nSometimes I make several trip plans and wait for promotional long distance flights tickets. I use Rome2rio my trips in advance step by step for my future trip. I have a saved trip code for Sri Lanca. I want to make another travel plan for another place but I could not. I have send a message to Rome2Rio to be able to make several Trip Plans and to save. Rome2Rio Support Team replied same day and keep informing about software developments about new trip planning tool with multi-stop searches (including across multiple countries) and user accounts. Hope they will be developed soon.\n\nDate of experience : January 28, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi there,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave this valuable review.\n\nAs our support team shared, our multi-trip save feature is currently in the works and will be coming very soon, so stay tuned!\n\nWe wish you all the best on your travels to Sri Lanka!\n\nBest regards,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nThank you DC for your feedback.\n\nRome2Rio has partnerships with many travel websites, including Expedia, so we can show you the best results based on your chosen destination.\n\nWhen you leave Rome2Rio and go to one of our partners the Rome2Rio header is displayed, so that you know you are on a Rome2Rio trusted partner website.\n\nWe acknowledge this may catch some users by surprise as the header can still show after a few days, but we feel it's an important feature, especially for users who are booking with one of our partners for the first time, as it helps to build trust.\n\nWe hope this helps to clarify why you are seeing our logo even after a few days.\n\nHappy travels.\n\nThanks,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio\n\nNo longer my go to\n\nI am not sure when this happened, but there was a time when I would not travel anywhere without looking at rome2rio (40+ countries), but in the past 2 or so years the quality of the information provided has decreased significantly. I can no longer assume that the information provided is the best and/or only way to get from point A to B. It is ok to get a general sense of travel options, but you now need to search in several sites to make sure what your options are.\n\nDate of experience : May 23, 2024\n\nReply from Rome2Rio\n\nHi NRR,\n\nThanks for your feedback. We are sorry to hear about this.\n\nRome2Rio manages information from thousands of transport operators around the world. We want to assure you that Rome2Rio works hard to keep everything up to date and accurate. Please can you email feedback@rome2rio.com with the information you were looking for by destination and we can look into it for you.\n\nThanks again,\n\nTal\n\nRome2Rio Team\n\nRome2Rio for bus and train info\n\nI updated Rome2Rio on an Eastern European bus line and they got back to me really quickly. Rome2Rio is one of the best sites for figuring out bus and train service.\n\nIn this case I needed to go from Sofia Bulgaria to Serbia. There usually is an early bus but they had changed the time and the bus website did not have the information.\n\nRome2Rio puts information together really well. In this case it included a train option even though there isn't an international train, with a 20km taxi in the middle. That's pretty impressive even though the times didn't work out for me.\n\nDate of experience : April 04, 2024"
