It also provides booking details, so you can essentially plan your entire trip from this one app!\n\nWho is the Rome2rio app for?\n\nWhile this app is useful to anyone travelling from A to B, it is exceptionally useful for the spontaneous traveller. Whether you are backpacking and have yet to decide on where you’ll end up next, or you feel the sudden urge to go see a landmark on the horizon, this app makes it easy.\n\nLow-cost Travel Insurance from Worldwide Insure\n\nAnnual Multi-trip Travel Insurance Single Trip Travel Insurance Longstay Travel Insurance Wintersports Travel Insurance Cruise Travel Insurance Car Hire Excess Insurance\n\nClick to get an online quote ☝️or call the team on 01892833338\n\nWhat do the Rome2rio app reviews say?\n\nIt seems that the iPhone and iPad users are happier with the app than android users – and one of the best features is being able to compare prices of the transport options available. A nine-hour bus journey for £30 suddenly becomes appealing when it is £300 cheaper than a two-hour flight!
