This would help us review and improve our results in future. If you prefer you can send the details to [email protected]\n\nIf you are looking for alternatives to Rome2Rio you could also try routerank along with the Voyage SCNF site already mentioned. Also there are a couple more German focused sites with similar concepts GoEuro and Waymate in the future they may expand to feature other European countries in their data.\n\nSome other sites that you may already be aware of that I'd recommend would be Bahn a comprehensive schedule planner along with Seat 61 which has good references and guides to travelling by train in Europe.\n\nThere also several nice sites using the Rome2Rio API, but as it is generally the same dataset as Rome2Rio you may not be as interested in those :)"
