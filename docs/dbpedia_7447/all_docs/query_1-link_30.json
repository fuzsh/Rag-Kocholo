I went by bus from Madrid as it was considerably cheaper than train when I booked. Alsa.es is the website, takes 5.5 - 6 hours, depending on which departure you book - there are many. There may be other companies doing this route eg Flixbus. Bus prices are static whereas the train fares can vary, like airlines.\n\nOn my slower bus there was a 30 minute rest stop in Lerma. There's a toilet on the bus, as well as a little tablet with films etc built in to the back of the seat in front. But I find it much less comfortable than the train. Spanish trains are really spacious and the long distance ones all have cafe bars.\n\nBarbaraW\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019/22, Portuguese 2023, Ingles 2024\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\n#7\n\nIf you're flying into Madrid and not staying there some of the buses pick up at the airport, which may be easier. San Sebastian is lovely, compact with an interesting old quarter, good food and lots of places to stay. Cheaper than Madrid, though it may be different in high season.\n\nLuz de Luna\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrancais 2016\n\nPrortugues central/ coastal 2023\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\n#8\n\nIf you're flying into Madrid and not staying there some of the buses pick up at the airport, which may be easier.

Also the site to see bus schedules and pre purchase tickets?\n\ntrecile\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious routes 2016 - 2024\n\nApr 29, 2024\n\n#9\n\nDo you know how long to bus ride up to SanSabastian is?\n\nClick on the Rome2Rio link in post #2 - it will tell you how long the different transportation options take, and you can click through to the provider. Also, make sure that you spell San Sebasti√°n correctly. There is an e in it. And its name in Basque is Donostia.\n\nBarbaraW\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances 2019/22, Portuguese 2023, Ingles 2024\n\nApr 30, 2024\n\n#10\n\nLuz, as in my previous post the bus takes five and a half to six hours. It will be a bit less from the airport.

Any advice on the best way to get to San Sabastian from Madrid? Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nI flew from Madrid to the San Sebastian/Irun Airport using Iberia airlines last year and it was relatively inexpensive and a very efficient connection. Obviously more than a bus or train but was worth it to me an at least worth checking out."
