        "text": "Google Maps is an excellent navigation and mapping tool, but many Google Maps alternatives are as good or better for several reasons. Your choice of mapping tool depends on how you plan your trips and how you use your maps. Do you like planning out your trips at home on your computer, or are you doing most of your trip planning and navigation from your phone?\n\nThe following list highlights the features and all of the pros and cons of each Google Maps alternative so that you can choose the perfect mapping tool for your situation.\n\n1. MapQuest\n\nMapQuest has been around for about as long as Google Maps has. It offers both a web-based tool as well as a mobile app. With a MapQuest account, you can sync all of your navigation plans between the web and your phone.\n\nMapQuest works much like Google Maps does when it comes to searching for locations and finding directions. It’ll recognize your current location based on your IP address (if using the web) or your phone’s GPS (if using mobile). Just type in a location and click Get Directions to see the route.\n\nRoute directions are very accurate and include current traffic levels, distance, and even estimated fuel costs to make the drive. A hovering tool along the right provides you with zoom controls, satellite or traffic views, and share or print buttons.\n\nThe MapQuest mobile app has more features than the web-based tool. It offers more one-button location-finding options like hospitals, parking, post offices, schools, and more. It also displays the current temperature at your location.\n\nHow MapQuest is better than Google Maps:\n\nDirections include estimated fuel costs.\n\nAn integrated tool for quickly finding hotels and making reservations.\n\nOne-button tool for finding gas stations, grocery stores, coffee shops, shopping areas, food, and hotels.\n\nRe-routing the planned trip path is more user-friendly.\n\nHow MapQuest is worse than Google Maps:\n\nThe web tool is covered with several very annoying ads that block the map view.\n\nRoute planner has fewer features than Google Maps.\n\nThe route is slightly less accurate than Google Maps and doesn’t update as frequently.\n\n2. Waze\n\nIf you visit the Waze website, it doesn’t look like there’s a web-based tool at all. That is until you click the Live Map link in the menu. Even though the app is now owned by Google, it’s still one of the best Google Maps alternatives.\n\nThe web tool is meant as a supplement to your mobile experience. The Live Map lets you quickly search for destinations and plan routes, click locations on the map to drop pins or add destinations, and use the Waze Map Editor to customize your map of any area.\n\nThe Waze mobile app is much more fun to use than most other navigation tools out there. This is because of the social integration it offers with other users (called Wazers).\n\nYou can quickly share traffic or police alerts, and hazard warnings, note cool places, post camera shots, or ask for roadside help.\n\nHow Waze is better than Google Maps:\n\nMore of a social driving experience.\n\nBetter warnings about crashes, speed traps, and more.\n\nIntegration with your mobile music apps.\n\nOnline and mobile trip planning with scheduled departure times.\n\nSee and interact with other users around you.\n\nHow Waze is worse than Google Maps:\n\nMaps are less detailed on both the web and on mobile.\n\nThe navigation mobile view is more cartoonish.\n\nFar fewer features than other navigation tools.\n\n3. Bing Maps\n\nBing Maps is probably one of Google Maps’ most direct competitors. However, Microsoft doesn’t just try to copy the Google Maps interface to compete. Instead, you’ll find a fresh and clean user interface that’s very simple to use. All controls for directions, traffic, sharing, and more are lined up along the top.\n\nBing Maps has all of the same features you’ll find in Google Maps, including road, aerial, and streetside layers, as well as transit and walking maps in addition to driving. It’s straightforward to add destinations all along the route and then print the map to take with you on your trip.\n\nHow Bing Maps is better than Google Maps:\n\nMaps are extremely detailed, with multiple layers available.\n\nThe user interface is modern and easy to use.\n\nMap tools and features are situated all around the edges of the map.\n\nEasily save places to your personal library.\n\nHow Bing Maps is worse than Google Maps:\n\nNo mobile app is available.\n\nNo trip planner tool.\n\nOverall fewer features and tools are available.\n\nEven though there’s no mobile app available, it is possible to use the Bing Maps website on your smartphone, but it could use up more data than other navigation apps.\n\n4. Here WeGo\n\nThis navigation service may not be quite as well known or popular as Google Maps or MapQuest, but it has its unique features. The Here WeGo mobile app is well known, but there’s also a website worth using if you want to take some time before you head out to plan out your trip.\n\nThe online map interface is clean and simple but filled with great features like many route options like transit, taxi, or even car-sharing routes. There are also just as many layers as Google Maps, including transit, traffic, satellite, and terrain.\n\nYou won’t find advanced route planning or any extra bells and whistles that you may find with Waze or MapQuest, but that’s because the crown jewel of Here WeGo is the mobile app, and that’s where you should be using it the most.\n\nIt’s simple to use. With just a couple of taps, you can switch to satellite, transit, traffic, or classic view. When you first open the app, you can set your home location. After that, type your destination and launch the navigation tool to start driving.\n\nThe website and the app are perfect for minimalists who don’t want many distractions from their navigation app. With the app, you just set your destination and go. That’s it.\n\nHow Here WeGo is better than Google Maps:\n\nMust faster to plot a route and start navigating.\n\nLarge, easy-to-follow mobile navigation screen.\n\nFewer distractions in navigation mode.\n\nHow Here WeGo is worse than Google Maps:\n\nNo extra route planning tool or features like Google Maps.\n\nAdding stops while en route is more difficult.\n\nFar fewer features than Google Maps and other tools.\n\n5. Rand McNally\n\nOne of the most well-known names in the mapping world is Rand McNally, the publisher of traditional map books. Not to be left behind in the dust in the digital age, the company offers Rand McNally online maps.\n\nUsing the Rand McNally online map website is simple. Just type your origin and destination and click Get Directions to see the route. Just like their paper maps, the online Rand McNally maps are detailed. You’ll spot even the smallest bodies of water and even obscure walking trails.\n\nThe map tool itself doesn’t have the sort of transit and walking layers other online mapping tools have; it does have an impressive satellite view to see the contour of the land. You won’t find a companion Rand McNally mobile app, but the online site is an excellent choice for planning your routes to any destination.\n\nHow Rand McNally is better than Google Maps:\n\nMore detailed than any other mapping service.\n\nImpressive and useful satellite view.\n\nThe Zoom tool is fast and simple to use.\n\nQuickly save locations to your library.\n\nHow Rand McNally is worse than Google Maps:\n\nNo mobile app.\n\nNo transit, walking, or other layers.\n\nFar fewer features than any other online map tool.\n\n6. Maps.me\n\nWhile other mapping services only have a website but no mobile app, Maps.me is the opposite. This is a mobile-only service without any companion website.\n\nHowever, it’s also one of the few mapping apps that let you navigate anywhere offline. It’s a perfect way to save on your mobile data plan by downloading apps while you’re connected to your home Wi-Fi network and using those maps when you’re mobile.\n\nIt also doesn’t use a whole lot of storage. You can download general maps of the entire United States of America, consuming only 21 MB of your phone’s storage. You will need to download more detailed maps when you plan more specific routes.\n\nIncludes traffic and subway layers (subway layers don’t work with other online mapping apps).\n\nDiscover nearby businesses and attractions.\n\nDownload free travel guides for your destinations.\n\nBookmark and store locations in the cloud.\n\nHow Maps.me is worse than Google Maps:\n\nFeatures small ads on the app display.\n\nYou can’t search for specific businesses, only map addresses.\n\nFar fewer features than Google Maps.\n\n7. OpenStreetMap and OsmAnd\n\nThis service includes two services that work apart from one another. The first is the OpenStreetMap web mapping tool, and the other is the OsmAnd app that pulls data from the OpenStreetMap location database. Together, they work to place the app squarely within our list of favorite alternatives to Google Maps.\n\nOsmAnd is another offline mapping app that can save you on mobile data and help you keep track of where you are even when you’re off the grid.\n\nThe OpenStreetMap website is simple, but it includes more features than many of the other simple online mapping services out there. You’ll find different layers available, very accurate route planning, and a detailed map of your route.\n\nRouting includes very accurate bicycle or walking routes as well.\n\nOne drawback of this site is that entering the origin and destination is not as intuitive as other mapping services. Also, the online mapping site isn’t directly linked to the OsmAnd mobile app, so you can’t directly share saved routes. However, when you have your route finished, you can download the map as a file, transfer it to your phone, and load it into the mobile app for offline use.\n\nUsing the OsmAnd mobile app, you’ll need to download map data for specific locations. This app downloads the fully detailed maps, so it uses a bit more space initially than Maps.me. The free version also includes only 7 free map downloads, so if you plan to travel a lot, you’ll need to invest in the premium version.\n\nHowever, with those big downloads come lots of impressive detail. You’ll see icons for business types, walking paths, and even the direction of river flow. It’s great for scouting out areas but not so good for real-time driving navigation.\n\nHow OpenStreetMap is better than Google Maps:\n\nDoesn’t use any mobile data.\n\nWorks completely off the grid.\n\nExtremely detailed maps.\n\nHow OpenStreetMap is worse than Google Maps:\n\nSlower to route than other mapping services.\n\nThe web mapping interface is not very intuitive.\n\nWebsite and mobile app are not integrated.\n\nDriving navigation mode is basic and not very useful.\n\nChoosing Google Maps Alternatives\n\nAs you can see, all of these mapping services have their pros and cons. The one you choose depends on how you plan to use it. If you travel a lot off the grid, then offline access is critical. Do a lot of exploring in the city? Detailed maps are key. If you use your mapping app in the car, ease of use is the way to go.\n\nDon’t stick with Google Maps just because it’s what everyone uses. Branch out and try a few of the alternatives to Google Maps listed above. You may find that one of them works much better for you."
