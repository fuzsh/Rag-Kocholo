Tunnel excavation has officially kicked off on the Western Harbour Tunnel Stage Two project in Sydney.

A 100 tonne roadheader has commenced its journey its journey from Cammeray excavating south towards the Warringah Freeway and onwards towards the harbour at Waverton. Over the course of construction of Stage Two of the Western Harbour Tunnel, 10 roadheaders will be used.

Western Harbour Tunnel is a 6.5-kilometre tunnel, which will provide motorists a seamless connection from Warringah Freeway at North Sydney to the Rozelle Interchange, making it easier, faster and safer to get around Sydney.
