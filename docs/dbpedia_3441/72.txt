A second harbour tunnel is within the State Infrastructure Strategy's development plans in Sydney. The new tunnel will be an extension to the M2 motorway, connecting Balmain to Lane Cove, and will offer motorists a bypass to the congested inner city.

According to the plans, the tunnel will run from the intersection of Anzac Bridge and Victoria Road at Rozelle to the M2 motorway around Lane Cove. It is going to be part of the 33km WestConnex motorway, allowing commuters to avoid the traffic congestion of the Sydney centre. The chairman of Infrastructure NSW, Graham Bradley, stated that this 10-year plus project "could well be an adjunct to WestConnex that will have an impact on how it might affect the interconnection here with the city". The WestConnex is going to link the M4 to the M5 motorway via the Sydney Airport, also having a 13km tunnel as part of the new plans. Construction is expected to begin in 2015, with completed parts of the motorway being given for use until the completion of the project in 2023.
