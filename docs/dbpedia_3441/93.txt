This article describes the design and construction of the Sydney harbour tunnel, Australia, which is needed to avoid eventual chronic congestion of the Sydney harbour bridge. The tunnel was proposed in 1986, and its detailed feasibility study and environmental impact statement were released in December 1986. Construction began in January 1988, and completion is scheduled for 31 August 1992. The cost is fixed at $a553.8 million. The tunnel will be a 2.3 km dual carriageway link between the northern approach freeway to the Sydney harbour bridge and existing distributor freeways South of the harbour. It will have three major sections: (1) twin 990 m long land tunnels between the northern bridge approaches and the northern shoreline of the harbour; (2) a 960 m long immersed tube, consisting of eight precast reinforced concrete units across the harbour; (3) twin 400 m long land tunnels between the southern shoreline of the harbour and the southern distributor freeway. The latter part of the article details the construction of: (1) the northern land works; (2) the southern land works; (3) the marine works; (4) the immersed tube units. Finally, the mechanical, electrical and hydraulic services to be provided are described.
