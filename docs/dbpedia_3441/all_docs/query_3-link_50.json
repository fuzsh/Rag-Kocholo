        "text": "About Sydney Metro\n\nSydney Metro is Australia’s biggest public transport project.\n\nBuilding, operating and maintaining a network of four metro lines, 46 stations and 113km of new metro rail.\n\nSydney Metro is revolutionising how Australia’s biggest city travels, connecting Sydney’s north west, west, south west and greater west to fast, reliable turn-up-and-go metro services with fully accessible stations.\n\nChatswood to Sydenham\n\nThis project covers the construction and operation of the Sydney Metro rail line from Chatswood to Sydenham. This 15.5-kilometre section of the rail line is almost entirely comprised of underground rail tunnels –including beneath Sydney Harbour – and new stations at Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street, Waterloo, and new underground platforms at Central.\n\nThe Environmental Impact Statement was on public exhibition from 11 May to 27 June 2016 and received more than 300 submissions. Sydney Metro collated the responses and released a Submissions and Preferred Infrastructure Report (available in the document library). This report included a number of key changes made as a result of the feedback.\n\nThe Minister for Planning approved the project on 9 January 2017.\n\nUsing five tunnel boring machines, tunnelling finished in early 2020 on new 15.5-kilometre twin railway tunnels between the end of the Metro North West line at Chatswood and Sydenham.\n\nNew stations will be delivered at Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Martin Place, Pitt Street and Waterloo, along with new underground platforms at Central Station.\n\nSydenham to Bankstown\n\nSydney Metro received planning approval on 19 December 2018 to upgrade the T3 Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Bankstown to metro standards. Customers will benefit from a new fully-air conditioned Sydney Metro train every four minutes in the peak in each direction with lifts, level platforms and platform screen doors for safety, accessibility and increased security.\n\nFor more information see the Bankstown Line Metro Conversion newsletter.\n\nThe Submissions and Preferred Infrastructure Report for the Sydenham to Bankstown Metro upgrade was on exhibition until 18 July 2018.\n\nYou can view a summary of the project in the Sydenham to Bankstown Preferred Infrastructure Report Overview."
