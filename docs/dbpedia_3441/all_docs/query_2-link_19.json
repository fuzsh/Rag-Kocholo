        "text": "Ferries pass under the Sydney Harbour Bridge on their way to and from the Paramatta River. More pictures below.\n\nPower and splendour of\n\nSydney Harbour Bridge\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge is one of Sydney's two most famous landmarks, the other being the Opera House.\n\nThe pedestrian walkway across the bridge gives visitors some of the best views of Sydney Harbour, Opera House and Circular Quay - and they're free!\n\nCompleted in 1932, the construction of the bridge - known locally as \"The coathanger\" - was an economic feat as well as an engineering triumph. Prior to the bridge being built, the only links between the city centre in the south and the residential north were by ferry or by a 20 kilometre (12Â½ mile) road route that involved five bridge crossings.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge, which is known locally as the \"Coat Hanger\", took eight years to build, including the railway line. The bridge was manufactured in sections on a site that is now occupied by Luna Park fun fair.\n\nConstruction on the bridge began in December, 1926. The foundations, which are 12 metres (39 feet) deep, are set in sandstone. Anchoring tunnels are 36 metres (118 feet) long and dug into rock at each end. Construction on the arch began in November, 1929. It was built in halves with steel cable restraints initially supporting each side. The arch spans 503 metres (1650 feet) and supports the weight of the bridge deck, with hinges at either end bearing the bridge's full weight and spreading the load to the foundations. The hinges allow the structure to move as the steel expands and contracts in response to wind and changes in temperatures.\n\nBy October, 1930, the two arch halves had met and work then began on the deck. The deck is 59 metres (194 feet) above sea level and was built from the center out.\n\nThe Harbour Bridge was officially opened on 19 March 1932. The total cost of the Bridge was approximately 6.25 million Australian pounds ($A13.5 million), and was eventually paid off in 1988. The initial toll for a car was 6 pence (5 cents) and a horse and rider was 3 pence (2 cents). Today the toll costs $3.00. The toll is now used for bridge maintenance and to pay for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. The annual maintenance costs are approximately $5 million. More than 150,000 vehicles cross the bridge each day.\n\nThe bridge was built by 1400 workers, 16 of whom were killed in accidents during construction. Painting the bridge has become an endless task. Approximately 80,000 litres (21,000 gallons) of paint are required for each coat, enough to cover an area equivalent to 60 soccer fields. Before Paul Hogan (from the movie Crocodile Dundee) became famous, he worked on the Sydney Harbour Bridge as a painter.\n\nRecommended for all visitors to Sydney is the Pylon Lookout. Inside the Lookout is a fascinating display on how this bridge was built. Entry to the Pylon is from the pedestrian walkway on the Harbour Bridge. You can get to the walkway via the stairs in Cumberland Street, The Rocks, or from near Milsons Point Station on the north side. The Pylon Lookout is open every day except Christmas Day.\n\nTHE BRIDGE BY DAY\n\nYou get an entirely different perspective of the bridge when you see it from Observatory Hill, which can be accessed from The Rocks.\n\nThe bridge and Luna Park seen from the shores of Lavender Bay. The Australia artist Brett Whitely made Lavender Bay famous through a series of stunning paintings.\n\nA ferry departs for Circular Quay, having just dropped passengers off at the Milsons Point wharf. You can catch a ferry to Milsons Point, walk up the stairs onto the bridge's pedestrian walkway, and walk back across the Sydney harbour Bridge to The Rocks and Circular Quay.\n\nTHE BRIDGE BY NIGHT\n\nThe bridge takes on different guises at night, depending on where you view it from."
