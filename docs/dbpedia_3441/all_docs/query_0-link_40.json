        "text": "Case Histories: SEM/NATM Excavation Techniques\n\nPresidential C\n\nChairs: Dave Dorfman; Walsh Group, Warwick, NY\n\nMark Claassen; Arcadis, Toronto, ON\n\n10:00 am\n\nIntroductions\n\n10:05 am\n\nConstruction Phase Services for Australian and North American SEM Tunneling\n\nYun Bai; Delve Underground, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nMichael Salcher; Gamuda Australia, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nSarah Wilson; Delve Underground, San Francisco, California, United States\n\nMark Trim; Delve Underground, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\nOver the last decade more than 62 miles (100 km) of civil transport tunnels were constructed in Sydney, Australia, using the sequential excavation method (SEM). The WestConnex motorway tunnels, each stage of which used over 20 road-headers to excavate up to 40 tunnel headings, had numerous caverns up to 100 feet (30 m) wide and 82 feet (25 m) high. SEM tunnels in North America typically have far fewer active headings. This paper examines the differences in scope and risk allocation for construction phase services, including comparison of the Permit to Tunnel (PTT) process in Australia and the Required Excavation and Support process in North America.\n\n10:25 am\n\nInfluence of Early Ring Closure of Center Drift on Main Tunnel Excavation under High Overburden Ground\n\nDevini Abeyawardena; Penta-Ocean Construction Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSimin Zhai; Penta-Ocean Construction Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nSadatoshi Ohmori; Penta-Ocean Construction Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nNobuharu Isago; Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan\n\nA road tunnel is planned to be constructed in soft, high overburden ground of around 600m in Japan by using the center drift advancing method. The dodging effect and early ring closure of the center drift were expected to reduce the displacement and deformation of tunnel and promote safe construction. The measurement result during construction was analyzed and those effects, which the displacement and deformation after the widening excavation decreased and its effect increased as the center drift radius increased, were confirmed by numerical analysis. Also, the effect of the early closure of center drift after widening excavation did not have much effect.\n\n10:45 am\n\nChimney Hollow Reservoir Project Inlet / Outlet Tunnel Excavation and Valve Chamber Construction\n\nKyle Kittle; Stantec, Louisville, Kentucky, United States\n\nGregory Raines; Stantec, San Diego, California, United States\n\nAlbert Ruiz; Stantec, Chandler, Arizona, United States\n\nKyle Knaeble; Barnard Construction Company Inc., Bozeman, Montana, United States\n\nRyan Gewargis; Stantec, Denver, Colorado, United States\n\nThe Chimney Hollow Reservoir Project (CHRP) is located southwest of Loveland, Colorado. CHRP is a component of the Windy Gap Firming Project, operated by the Municipal Subdistrict of the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. The inlet/outlet tunnel (IOT) for CHRP contains a reinforced concrete lined valve chamber with PVC membrane waterproofing that was excavated via sequential excavation method to a diameter of 30 feet. The IOT was excavated using both drill and blast and road header with ground support consisting of steel sets, rock bolts, wire mesh and shotcrete. The IOT will withstand 300 feet of water head and rock fill surcharge load from the dam embankment constructed over the tunnel.\n\n11:05 am\n\nMitchell Point Tunnel, Oregon – Design and Construction\n\nMatthew Fowler; WSP USA, San Francisco, California, United States\n\nJohn Horne; WSP USA, Portland, Oregon, United States\n\nCole Bales; Anchor QEA, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nTaeyong Lee; FHWA, Vancouver, Washington, United States\n\nMitchell Point Tunnel near Hood River, Oregon is one of the more unique segments of the Historic Columbia River Highway and State Trail being constructed through the Columbia River Gorge. This 650-foot bike/pedestrian tunnel set to open in 2024 is being delivered by FHWA in partnership with Oregon DOT, Oregon State Parks, and the U.S. Forest Service. Primarily driven using drill & blast excavation methods through basalt, the shotcrete and dowel-supported tunnel features masonry portals and five “window adits” that provide illumination and views of the river similar to the original highway “tunnel of many vistas” built in 1915 that was removed in 1966 to make way for Interstate 84. This paper summarizes the planning, design, and construction.\n\n11:25 am\n\nThe Upper Hidden Basin Diversion Project Design and Construction at Terror Lake – Kodiak, Alaska\n\nSteve Brandon; Schnabel Engineering, Sterling, Virginia, United States\n\nJulius Strid; Schnabel Engineering, Seattle, Washington, United States,\n\nJennifer King; Kodiak Electric Association, Inc., Kodiak, Alaska, United States\n\nThe Upper Hidden Basin Diversion (UHBD) tunnel was driven approximately 1.2 miles by the drill-and-blast method primarily through massive granite bedrock geology for the Kodiak Electric Association, Inc. (KEA) in Kodiak, Alaska. The tunnel was driven from both portals with a constant 11-ft straight-leg horseshoe cross-section. The design and construction of the tunnel was driven by logistics and weather conditions due to its remote location and the rugged terrain of the project setting. This paper will discuss the successful completion of a challenging project over a five-year period from preliminary planning through the design and construction phases.\n\n11:45 am\n\nApplication of the Observational Method in the T-48 Tunnel Project in the Himalayas\n\nAnuradha Khetwal; WSP USA, Highlands Ranch, Colorado, United States\n\nSandeep Khetwal; Black & Veatch, Highlands Ranch, Colorado, United States\n\nAndrea Panciera; Lombardi Engineering Limited, Bellinzona, Bellinzona, Switzerland\n\nThe observation method is a design optimization approach for the drill and blast method in tunneling. This method includes first identifying the hazard scenarios through site investigation, formulating suit-able solutions, obtaining feedback during construction, and finally using that data to optimize the design methods. This paper illustrates the application of the observational method for T-48, a railway tunnel project in the Himalayas. It is a 10.2 km long tunnel with a parallel escape tunnel and 26 cross passages. The use of observational methods in this project optimized the overall tunnel design and considerably saved the overall project cost.\n\nDesign: Numerical Modeling\n\nPresidential A\n\nChairs: Eleanor Sillerico; Mott MacDonald, Los Angeles, CA\n\nMatthew Over; JCK Underground, Hendersonville, TN\n\nSponsored by:\n\n10:00 am\n\nIntroductions\n\n10:05 am\n\nThe Application of Load Combinations in Ground-Structure Interaction Software\n\nDale Brunton; Arup, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nMichael Dutton; Arup, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nRobert Adams; Arup, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTunnels and other underground structures are typically designed using ground-structure interaction models instead of traditional structural analysis programs. This allows for the degree of load sharing between the two bodies to be calculated, allowing for a more efficient design. While modern codes outline the use of limit states with factors on applied actions, limit states are not typically compatible with ground-structure interaction models. Consequently, the engineer is left to develop rational methods for incorporating load factors into their analyses. Several methods can be considered, including the Largest Factor Method, Averaging Method, Subtraction Method, and Split Factor Method. This paper discusses the approaches, compares their effects using a case example, and provides a recommendation for designers.\n\n10:25 am\n\nNumerical Impact Assessment of Axially Loaded Piles and Their Seismic Effects on an Existing Bored Subway Tunnel\n\nMaziar Pasdarpour; GHD, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nKeivan PakIman; GHD, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nTransportation tunnels are highly sensitive to ground movements and are required to be stable and secure for safe operation. In urban areas, the interaction between tunnels and adjacent piles, which are widely used to support buildings and other structures, requires careful consideration. The seismic response of tunnels may vary depending on the lateral stiffness and strength of the tunnel walls, while the axial loading and seismic impact of adjacent piles may cause soil displacement and stress changes that can damage the tunnel lining. As a result, tunnel owners often impose strict limits on the design of new piles lying close to existing tunnels including maximum allowable tunnel deformation, stress change limits, and minimum tunnel to pile separation distances. This paper describes a numerical analysis of the influence of the axial loading and seismic impact of bored pile foundations on subway tunnels, undertaken using the finite element software Plaxis 3D. Based on the results of the numerical analysis, the paper suggests a more realistic and less conservative approach for designing piles in close proximity to transportation tunnels.\n\n10:45 am\n\nATSSE: Design Workflow for Construction Impact Assessment from EPB TBM-Induced Ground Movements\n\nRoham Akbarian; Arup, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nAidan Hopkins; Arup, Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nStrabag, with Arup, is designing and constructing the ATSSE in Toronto, Canada. The 7.8 km long extension of the existing TTC Line 2 is in an urban area passing below existing structures, including Hwy401, the TTC Line 3 and thousands of utilities. Understanding construction impacts are an integral part of tunnel design. This paper proposes a design approach for assessing the impact to assets, providing a workflow linking “face pressure” and “volume loss” using numerical modelling. The step-by-step workflow is proposed for initial and detailed assessments on ground movements. The paper discusses the application of the workflow for ATSSE.\n\n11:05 am\n\nDesign of Special Precast Lining Rings for Cross Passage Openings Using Finite Element Analysis and Shell Spring Models\n\nMehdi Ghasemi; GHD, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nAlireza Ramezani; GHD, Markham, Ontario, Canada\n\nKeivan Pak Iman; GHD, Markham, Ontario, Canada\n\nThe complex nature of seismic soil-structure interaction in pre-cast concrete tunnel linings (PCTL) around cross passages (CPs) requires the use of numerical methods of calculation. Local restraints on the PCTL from the CP collar cause differential movement and generate stress concentration in the PCTL rings adjacent to the CP opening. The radial and circumferential joints in the PCTL make it impossible to use simple closed-form solutions. In this paper, a 3D model of the tunnel (including eight adjacent fully closed rings and two cut rings at the CP opening) are created by SAP2000, with the surrounding geologic medium represented by soil springs. The two cut rings at the opening, and the two rings adjacent to the opening are specially reinforced with reinforcing steel while the remaining rings are steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC). A non-linear link has also been added to the model for both radial and circumferential joints consideration. Ground strains caused by seismic waves were then applied to the model accounting for the interaction between the tunnel structure and the surrounding ground. A series of 3D shell spring models were created to investigate the effect of ground springs, joint properties, and CP stiffness on the seismic behavior of the structure. Finally, the PCTL segment and all connectors were designed and checked for the most critical combinations of induced hoop force, bending moment, and shear force.\n\nPlanning: Project Design\n\nPresidential B\n\nChairs: Shawna Von Stockhausen; Mott MacDonald, San Jose, CA\n\nAmanda Foote; AECOM, Newburgh, IN\n\nSponsored by:\n\n10:00 am\n\nIntroductions\n\n10:05 am\n\nRisk-Based Ventilation Design for a Long Bidirectional Road Tunnel\n\nSoroush Dabiri; ILF Consulting Engineers, Rum/Innsbruck, Tirol, Austria\n\nJuan Carlos de Rueda; ILF Consulting Engineers, Rum/Innsbruck, Tirol, Austria\n\nReinhard Gertl; ILF Consulting Engineers, Rum/Innsbruck, Tirol, Austria\n\nThe Tunnel of Guillermo Gaviria Echeverri, spanning 6.05 miles, will be Latin America’s longest road tunnel, is currently under construction in Colombia’s Antioquia Department with a single bidirectional tube connected to a parallel rescue tube through multiple cross-passages. The study faces challenges in implementing the prescriptive semitransversal ventilation system due to design restrictions. Different ventilation concepts are explored to find the most suitable system for regular operation and fire scenarios. A quantitative risk assessment evaluates each alternative system and identifies the longitudinal ventilation system, accompanied by risk mitigation measures, as the safest choice, since it surpasses the prescribed semitransversal ventilation concept.\n\n10:25 am\n\nDesign and Construction Challenges at the Piney Branch CSO 049 Storage Tunnel in Washington, DC\n\nRitika Kundu; Delve Underground, Bristow, Virginia, United States\n\nMoussa Wone; District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, Washington, DC, District of Columbia, United States\n\nAmanda M Morgan; Delve Underground, Washington DC, District of Columbia, United States\n\nTatiana K Proctor; Greeley and Hansen, Washington DC, District of Columbia, United States\n\nThe Piney Branch CSO 049 Storage Tunnel (PBST) will be the last major project for the DC Clean Rivers Program. The project includes construction of a 2,200-foot-long, 18-foot-internal-diameter storage tunnel; two connections to combined sewer infrastructure; and two shafts. Major challenges include excavation underneath an existing live outfall that must remain in service; excavation of the tunnel through several areas of low rock cover and mixed-face conditions; and negotiations with a variety of federal, regional, and local stakeholders to address project impacts. This paper describes the overall project scope; geotechnical conditions along the alignment; design and construction challenges; and construction procurement.\n\n10:45 am\n\nMicrotunnel Shaft Construction in Louisiana\n\nLance Heyer; Lithos Engineering, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States\n\nJames Carroll; Lithos Engineering, Fort Collins, Colorado, United States\n\nThis paper describes the shaft design and construction for a 72-inch microtunnel under 14 active railroad tracks in Avondale, Louisiana. Initial shaft design for a deeper tunnel alignment considered secant piles with a jet grout plug. Final design for a shallower tunnel alignment included contractor input with support consisting of braced sheet piles with a jet grout plug. The authors further elaborate on jet grout implementation in very soft organic clay soils and the practical limitations of jet grouting. This paper emphasizes how all project participants worked together to utilize value engineering and alternative delivery on a unique tunneling project with a focus on temporary shaft support.\n\n11:05 am\n\nShaft Design and Construction at the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel\n\nPa Ousman Njie; WSP USA, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nRichard Giffen; Mott Macdonald, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nLuca Pellegrini; Hampton Roads Connector Partners, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nMartha Gross; Virginia Department of Transportation, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nThe Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT) Expansion project in Virginia includes parallel 1.5-mile (2.4 km) tunnels constructed using a tunnel boring machine (TBM). The TBM launching and receiving shafts were excavated within the footprint of two reclaimed islands abutting the navigation channel for the Port of Virginia. The shaft excavations – a circular tri-cell shaft at South Island, and a circular-rectangular twin-cell shaft at North Island – were supported by slurry walls up to 190 feet (58 meters) below the island surfaces. This paper describes specific design considerations for these shafts, as well as construction and quality-oversight aspects of their excavation and construction.\n\nTechnology: TBM Technology\n\nPresidential Chamber A\n\nChairs: Max Engen; JF Shea, Greenwood, IN\n\nJeff Pargas; Delve Underground, New York, NY\n\n10:00 am\n\nIntroductions\n\n10:05 am\n\nTBM Excavation through Pre-Existing Tie-Backs – Ship Canal Water Quality Project (SCWQP)\n\nFrancesco Chiappalon; LANE, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nFabrizio Fara; LANE, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nFranco Gasperin; LANE, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nThis document describes the challenging task of mining through tiebacks using a 21”8” diameter Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) as part of the Ship Canal Water Quality Project. The mining operation involves navigating through 17 tie-backs that are evenly spaced at 8-foot intervals, with many intersecting the full face of the cutterhead. Detailed analysis and review of TBM parameters specific to this area have been conducted to ensure operational efficiency and safety. Hyperbaric interventions have been planned and coordinated, encompassing pre-mining preparations, continuous monitoring and adjustments during the mining process, as well as post-mining measures. The document highlights the complexity and importance of strategic planning and execution to successfully overcome the tie-back intersections during the mining operation.\n\n10:45 am\n\nExtended Application Ranges for EPB-Shields in Coarse-Grained Soils, the Lower Olentangy Tunnel Project Case History\n\nMiriam Piemontese; Pini Group, Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland\n\nElisa Comis; Pini Group, Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nMaria Chastka; Granite Construction, Columbus, Ohio, United States\n\nDavid Chastka; Granite Construction, Columbus, Ohio, United States\n\nThe Lower Olentangy Tunnel (LOT) Project involves the construction of a 17,000 ft (5,200m) long, 12 ft (3.65m) internal diameter Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) tunnel. The tunnel is excavated by using an Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) machine designed to cope with soft ground, weak rocks and water pressure. The project is located in the city of Columbus, Ohio and the main geotechnical hazards are related to the heterogenous soils and the low overburden in an urban environment. This paper focuses on the performance of the EPB first drive and the comparison between the design assumptions and the actual TBM performance during construction.\n\n11:05 am\n\nTunnel Belt Applications for Long Distance Tunnels with Curvy Alignments\n\nMarco Sonnenschein; H+E Logistik GmbH, Bochum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\n\nBelt conveyors for tunnelling are industry standard and key to high performance of TBM drives. Conveyors reduce traffic in the tunnel and increase safety in the tunnelling process. This paper will illustrate the state of the art of tunnel belt applications in very long and curvy tunnels like the Coxwell Bypass Tunnel Project in Toronto, Canada.\n\n11:25 am\n\nLong Haul TBM: Use of a Rebuilt Main Beam Machine at the DigIndy Tunnel System in Indianapolis, IN\n\nDoug Harding; Robbins, Solon, Ohio, United States\n\nChristian Heinz; J.F. Shea, Walnut, California, United States\n\nTBMs can last for decades and be rebuilt project after project with proper maintenance. How successful can rebuilt TBMs be? At the DigIndy Tunnel System in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, a rebuilt TBM was used to great effect. The 6.2 m diameter Main Beam, originally manufactured in 1980, bored 40+ km of tunnels and set three world records in its size class of 6 to 7 m, including a best month of 1,754 m. In this paper, the authors analyze the TBM rebuild, performance and lessons learned to make recommendations for future projects seeking to use rebuilt TBMs over long distances.\n\nCase Histories: Shaft Excavation, Tunnel Rehabilitation & Challenges\n\nPresidential C\n\nChairs: Jeramy Decker; Kiewit, Morgan Hill, CA\n\nIsmail Karatas; HNTB, New York, NY\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nSecant Pile Wall as Support of Excavation and Final Lining of a Major Underground Metro Station\n\nAshish Bhargava; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nTraditionally, secant piles have been utilized to provide temporary support during excavation for shafts and cut-and-cover tunnels. As an alternative, the secant piles can be included into the permanent structure, where they serve as the envelope sustaining the lateral loads and gravity of the permanent structure in addition to supporting the excavation during construction. This has several benefits, such as shorter building times and lower excavation costs. Recent construction of an approach structure and an underground station as part of Montréal, Canada’s Réseau Express Métropolitain (REM), one of the biggest transit systems in North America, was completed with remarkable success using this. In this paper, a case study based on a project that employed secant piles as the permanent liner is presented. Techniques to guarantee a watertight construction with over a century of service life are described, along with a variety of structural and waterproofing methods applied to create an economical design.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nTBM Rescue Shaft, Tunnel, and Relaunch in Karst Conditions\n\nDan Swidrak; Affholder Construction, O’Fallon, Missouri, United States\n\nWilliam Zietlow; Brierley Associates, Denver, Colorado, United States\n\nHalfway through a 17,770-ft long stormwater tunnel, an 11-ft diameter TBM encountered a karst void below the Mississippi River in Missouri, resulting in significant inflow. It was decided that the TBM could not safely advance without external intervention. Low-mobility grout was pumped from the surface. A rescue shaft was constructed and a conventional tunnel with spiling support was mined back to the machine. The TBM was removed and a 14-ft diameter TBM equipped with probing drills was relaunched. Probing from the new TBM encountered one additional karst feature but the machine advanced after grouting and successfully completed the tunnel.\n\n2:50 pm\n\nGround Freezing for Deep Shaft Excavation Shaft 18B-1 New York City Water Tunnel No. 3 New York, New York\n\nAndrew Chegwidden; Keller, Rockaway, New Jersey, United States\n\nTara Wilk; Walsh Construction Company II, LLC, Little Falls, New Jersey, United States\n\nShaft 18B-1 is the second shaft to be constructed as a part of contract C547A along the New York City water supply system Tunnel No. 3. More complex than Shaft 17B-1, this site has an additional 30 m (100 ft) of overburden for a total excavation depth of approximately 78 m (256 ft) through water-bearing overburden soil and 145 m (475 feet) of gneiss bedrock to connect to the underlying Water Tunnel No. 3. Ground freezing was specified as the method to provide temporary earth support and ground water control for the overburden material. An extensive supplemental geotechnical investigation (SGI) and frozen soil testing program was performed to develop the design of a temporary ground freezing system, consisting of over 7,315 m (24,000 ft or 4.5 miles) of drilling for the installation of 95 freeze pipes. At the start of shaft excavation, the upper sandy silts strata was found to have an unprecedented low thermal conductivity, leaving the frozen soil face approximately 0.6 to 1 m (2-3 ft) behind the cutline. The ground freezing earth support needed to be augmented with ring beams and liner plates to support this soil face and allow for the excavation to proceed and be completed safely.\n\n3:20 pm\n\nSumner Tunnel Rehabilitation\n\nJoseph Rigney; Delve Underground, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States\n\nDavid Nowak; Delve Underground, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States\n\nConrad Stacey; Delve Stacey Agnew, Darra, Queensland, Australia\n\nMichael Beyer; Delve Stacey Agnew, Darra, Queensland, Australia\n\nChris Blanchard; J.F. White Construction Co., Framingham, Massachusetts, United States\n\nJohn Czach; MassDOT, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nOriginally constructed in the 1930s, the 1-mile-long Sumner Tunnel is 31 feet in diameter and carries traffic deep below Boston Harbor, connecting Boston and East Boston. This project includes both design and construction for the rehabilitation of the nearly 100-year-old tunnel. The primary work includes repairing advanced deterioration at the tunnel crown with new precast arches that will add protection and strengthening. The restoration also consists of upgrading the tunnel systems, including permanently removing 75% of the existing exhaust duct suspended over the roadway to improve the overall ventilation system capacity and performance.\n\n3:50 pm\n\nTBM Shield Abandonment beneath the Fraser River for Connecting Tunnel and River Riser of the Annacis Island WWTP New Outfall System\n\nUlf Gwildis; CDM Smith, Bellevue, Washington, United States\n\nJohn Newby; CDM Smith, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada\n\nKen Masse; Metro Vancouver, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada\n\nGuillaume Roux; Bessac, Delta, British Columbia, Canada\n\nHow to connect an effluent conveyance tunnel to riser shaft and diffuser arms of an outfall system is dictated by the ground conditions, which ideally include rock or soil strata of low permeability. Where such favorable conditions are beyond reach, both the complexity of designing and the risk of constructing this crucial system connection increase disproportionally. This paper describes the considerations that went into the approach of connecting a 5-m-diameter TBM drive with the in-river riser shaft of the Annacis Island WWTP New Outfall System in the highly permeable Fraser River sands at hydrostatic pressures exceeding 3 bar.\n\nDesign: Tunnel Lining Design\n\nPresidential A\n\nChairs: Renee Fippin; Delve Underground, San Francisco, CA\n\nMark Trim; Delve Underground, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nApplication of Post-Tensioning in TBM Tunneling: Case Study of JWPCP Effluent Outfall Tunnel Project in Los Angeles, USA\n\nIlkin Abdullayev; Mott MacDonald, Marina Del Rey, California, United States\n\nJosue Garcia; Mott MacDonald, Paramount, California, United States\n\nMariana Soperano Capistran; Mott MacDonald, Long Beach, California, United States\n\nThe application of post-tensioning in segmental structures was introduced in the early 1900s and has been successfully applied in different types of structures including immersed tunnels, bridges, buildings, metro stations, and stadiums. There are, however, only five known circular concrete tunnel projects where the posttensioning approach has been adopted. This paper discusses the application of post-tensioning to mitigate the high internal operating pressures in an effluent outfall tunnel project 7 miles (11.3 km) long, currently under construction for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (LACSD). This project will be the first use of post-tensioned segmental concrete tunnel linings in North America.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nDurability Design of CSO Tunnels\n\nIrwan Halim; AECOM, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, United States\n\nRobert Vail; AECOM, Atlanta, Georgia, United States\n\nThis paper describes a durability design approach for combined sewer overflow (CSO) tunnels to achieve 100-year life against exposure threats. The design conforms with relevant ACI codes including serviceability and maximum crack width criteria. The Life-365 model was used to assess chloride diffusion into concrete. An EPA approach was used to estimate corrosion loss of internal surfaces from hydrogen sulfide in wastewater. Groundwater and CSO fluid data were used to assess threats to exterior and interior structure surfaces. The durability design approach utilizes steel fiber reinforced tunnel lining, conventionally reinforced concrete with minimum clear cover requirements, concrete mix design specifications and protective linings.\n\n2:50 pm\n\nOptimization of Fire Design for FRC Tunnel Segments\n\nMehdi Bakhshi; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nAli Haghighat; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nVerya Nasri; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nNader Shahcheraghi; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nAn accidental fire load is one of the major loads considered in design of segmental linings in transit tunnel. Typically, a two-dimensional coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis (FEA) is conducted. The conventional approach involves using standard fire curves (temperature-time curves) which can lead to a significant overestimation of fire load and tunnel lining thickness in metro tunnels. The focus of this paper is on the cutting-edge approach, using 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of real train fires in metro tunnels and coupled thermo-mechanical finite element analysis (FEA) to accurately and cost-effectively design fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) segmental tunnel linings for large-scale metro projects.\n\n3:20 pm\n\nFabrication and Installation of Americas First Post Tensioned Pre-cast Segmental Tunnel Liner\n\nMadeline Mello; Dragados USA, Wilmington, California, United States\n\nNick Karlin; Dragados USA, Wilmington, California, United States\n\nBryce Scofield; Traylor Precast, LLC, Little Rock, California, United States\n\nMichael Low; Traylor Precast, LLC, Littlerock, California, United States\n\nThe LA Effluent Outfall Tunnel is the first tunnel in the United States to incorporate post-tensioning into the precast segmental lining. Several unique components were integrated to ensure that the post tensioning could be carried out successfully in the tunnel, even concurrently with the TBM excavation. This also required the development of new processes both in the casting facility and in the TBM to ensure that the almost 3,700 rings could be successfully manufactured, threaded, stressed, and grouted.

During the final stages of the project completion, a large-scale rock fall-out incident occurred during final lining installation operations at the down-stream end of the tunnel that extended beyond the designed primary support system. The paper outlines the level coordination and collaboration between Owner, Designed and Contractor to remediate the situation safely, timely and effectively.\n\nPlanning: Rehabilitation, Fire, Safety & Training\n\nPresidential B\n\nChairs: Hamed Saghaeian-Nejad; Michels, Secaucus, NJ\n\nMahan Bigdeli; Arup, Golden, CO\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nWhy an Industry Education City for the Tunneling Sector\n\nRoss Digby; Holmesglen Institute, Chadstone, Victoria, Australia\n\nThe Victorian Tunnelling Centre (VTC) has evolved its purpose from purely training workers, to a tunneling industry education city. The VTC has now focused its activities on the areas of technology; education and training; applied research; and career education were identified as the hubs around which activities would be conducted to create a tunneling industry education city. The VTC provides Australia’s tunneling industry with an education facility that not only provides labor training, but enables the industry to come together to meet, participate in product launches, undertake research, work with new technologies and promote tunneling careers.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nCFD Simulation of the Effect of Bifurcation on Fire Smoke Temperature and Toxic Gas Evolution in an Underground Mine Tunnel: A Case Study\n\nOluwafemi Salami; Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, Missouri, United States\n\nConducting full-scale fire experiments in underground mines is difficult and expensive. Sometimes, it is impossible to carry out fire tests in mines due to the danger they pose to mine workers and the underground facilities. However, understanding the potential occurrence of fires in a mine and their dynamics is critical to developing an appropriate emergency evacuation plan, fire suppression, and firefighting techniques. In this study, a numerical fire model using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with fire dynamics simulator (FDS) 6.7.6 was developed to examine the influence of tunnel bifurcation on maximum temperature beneath a tunnel ceiling. The model was validated using full-scale experimental data. The maximum ceiling gas temperature predicted using FDS and measured maximum smoke temperature during the experiment shows good agreement. The study shows that bifurcation could lower the maximum ceiling temperature of fire induced smoke in a subsurface environment. The findings from this study apply to the broader field of ventilation and fire life safety in tunnels and other underground environments.\n\n2:50 pm\n\nTunnel Rehabilitation\n\nHenry Russell Jr; HNTB, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nOver the last 25 years the rehabilitation of underground structures and in particular highway and rail tunnels has become an important part of underground engineering. Over that period the author has developed detailed procedures for the inspection and rehabilitation of tunnel structures and their associated systems. Most underground facilities that require rehabilitation in urban areas and are a major element of the infrastructure. The rehabilitation of these facilities requires that the facility be maintained in service during the repair/restoration work. As a result of these requirements, special procedures have been developed to facilitate the inspection, design, and implementation of the repairs. These procedures require the use of specialty products, construction methods, and in most cases prequalification of the contractor. This paper will discuss the procedures used for the inspection, design requirements, and in particular the use of specialty materials, construction practice, and current methodology using case histories to illustrate successful underground rehabilitation projects.\n\n3:20 pm\n\nUnique Aspects of Remote High Altitude Water Tunnel Repair\n\nDavid Jurich; Mott MacDonald, Lakewood, Colorado, United States\n\nEd Perko; Busk Ivanhoe Water System Authority, Pueblo, Colorado, United States\n\nJacob Prezkuta; Drill Tech Drilling and Shoring, Parker, Colorado, United States\n\nNumerous Colorado mountain tunnels that date to the late 1800s convey water to the farming and urban communities of the eastern Front Range. Repairs to these remote facilities, often located in public lands at altitudes of 11,000 feet or more, require detailed planning, close coordination with multiple agencies, and creative execution. Issues and solutions discussed include designing repairs in undocumented ground and support conditions, logistical challenges, work in a short summer construction window, stabilization of historically significant structures, and project delivery strategies. Examples that illustrate early contractor involvement, flexibility in design, and construction solutions are presented.\n\n3:50 pm\n\nRemediation of the Falls of Ground in a Water Conveyance Tunnel\n\nAmir Karami; BGC Engineering Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n\nScott Munro; BGC Engineering Inc., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nThis paper focuses on remediation of a 3.6 km long water conveyance tunnel that suffered two large falls of ground (FoGs), one of which subsequently progressed to the ground surface, resulting in full collapse of the tunnel. The tunnel is part of a network of water conveyance tunnels and open channels that direct water into two turbines located in an underground powerhouse, originally constructed in the 1970’s. At the time of construction, the tunnel was partially supported with shotcrete or rock bolts, with no further ground support added since construction. Two sonar surveys in 2019 and 2021 identified two adjacent large FoGs in the tunnel, approximately 1.2 km from the tunnel outlet. Historical geological and geotechnical information indicated that the FoGs occurred within a 60 m wide fault zone. Remediation plans were developed, which included stabilization of the outlet channel, the portal, the tunnel leading up to the FoG areas (1.2 km length) and the FoG areas. Several remediation options were considered to restore the tunnel, including construction of a diversion tunnel to bypass the FoGs or remediation of the FoG areas with steel ribs and backfilling the void above the FoGs to surface.\n\nTechnology: Digital Technology\n\nPresidential Chamber A\n\nChairs: Kaveh Talebi; Jay Dee Contractors, Inc., Livonia, MI\n\nJeff Brandt; Traylor Bros Inc., Hawthorne, CA\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nAutomation in Segmental Tunnel Lining Design: Case Study of the Northside Interceptor Tunnel Project (NSIT)\n\nBhoshaga Mitrran Ravi Chandran; AECOM, Oakland, California, United States\n\nKevin Huynh; AECOM, Oakland, California, United States\n\nIrwan Halim; AECOM, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, United States\n\nTunnel segmental lining design constitutes a significant iterative process where modeling and numerical analysis are factors in deciding the number of segments, their dimensions, gasket placements, as well as the locations of dowels and bolts. Consequently, these modifications lead to revisions in the final drawing details. However, the current tunnel engineering practices lack systematic solutions that effectively bridge the gap between the iterative design process and efficient visualization of completed drawings due to the time-consuming nature of redrawing. This paper presents a pioneering application of AI-driven solutions including using Autodesk’s API, for the Northside Interceptor Tunnel (NSIT) Project. It showcases the automation of drawing design and the real-time visualization of modifications, thereby streamlining the drawing process.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nDetermining Tunnel Clearance by Automating 3D Mobile Laser Profile Data\n\nAli Hafiz; Advanced Infrastructure Design, Inc., Hamilton, New Jersey, United States\n\nKaz Tabrizi; Advanced Infrastructure Design, Inc., Hamilton, New Jersey, United States\n\nJoseph Rigney; Delve Underground, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States\n\nKevin Ruston; Delve Underground, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n\nJames Dorta; Delve Underground, Sydney, Australia\n\nChris Blanchard; J.

White Contracting Co., Framingham, Massachusetts, United States\n\nMany existing tunnels have deteriorated as they age, requiring a massive amount of investment for their rehabilitation. The tunnel of interest in this paper is being rehabilitated by adding precast concrete arch panels under the existing concrete ceiling, and measuring the gap between them was the objective of this research. For this purpose, a mobile 3D laser/thermal scanner was used for scanning the tunnel, especially for the purpose of measuring its profile. To calculate the gap, the distance between the tunnel profile and the theoretical profile of the concrete arches was measured. Additionally, an in-house program was developed using MATLAB to automate the data processing to determine the above-referenced gaps. Results were provided in the form of heat maps showing the measured gap.\n\n2:50 pm\n\nSlurry Shield Cutterhead Torque Characterization using AI Machine Learning and Mechanics-Based Modeling\n\nMike Mooney; Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, United States\n\nThis paper documents an effort to explain cutterhead torque behavior observed during slurry pressure balance TBM tunneling through soft ground on the Los Angeles Clearwater project. AI machine learning and mechanics model-based learning was used to characterize cutterhead torque behavior including the TBM operating and ground parameters that influence cutterhead torque. Also, key parameters were from the slurry circuit data, including fines content, in-situ density, pore water fraction and solids content were included. The paper details what was learned using these new data-driven approaches as well as limitations with AI machine learning.\n\n3:20 pm\n\nBIM for Conventional Tunneling: The Sotra Link Project in Norway\n\nEnrico De Panicis; Pini Group USA Inc., Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nElisa Comis; Pini Group USA Inc., Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nGianluca Bella; Pini Group SA, Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland\n\nMatteo Giani; Pini Group SA, Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland\n\nGuido Barbieri; Pini Group SA, Lugano, Lugano, Switzerland\n\nAndrea Biagi; Webuild S.P.A., Bologna, Lugano, Italy\n\nThe Sotra Link Project is a major infrastructure project in Norway involving the design, construction, financing and maintenance of several underground and surface structures between Sotra Island and the city of Bergen, among them 23 tunnel portals, 12.5 km of tunnels and a 900 m long suspension bridge. This paper describes the benefits in applying a Building Information Modelling (BIM) approach to tunneling, from Early Design to the Detail Design Phase. The BIM application to the Sotra Link Project resulted in several improvements, such as efficient handling of clashes and inconsistencies, deeper understanding of effective design choices (reduction of errors), more efficient communication between designers, enhanced control of project quantities and costs. The advantages of the BIM approach during the ongoing Construction Phase are also explained.\n\nCase Histories: Geotechnical and Contracting Cases\n\nPresidential D\n\nChairs: Jon Isaacson; Brierly Associates, Milwaukee, WI\n\nRobert Auber; NEORSD, East Cleveland, OH\n\n8:30 am\n\nIntroductions\n\n8:35 am\n\nFrom Planning to Commissioning: A Complete Overview of the Northeast Boundary Tunnel Project\n\nFilippo Azzarà; The Lane Construction Corporation, Cheshire, Connecticut, United States\n\nDaniele Nebbia; The Lane Construction Corporation, Cheshire, Connecticut, United States\n\nMoussa Wone; DC Water, Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nJeff Peterson; DC Water, Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nThe DC Water and Sewer Authority’s Long Term Control Plan includes tunnels, sewer separation, pumping station rehabilitation and green infrastructure to reduce combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges to the District waterways. The Northeast Boundary Tunnel is a deep, large sewer tunnel that will reduce CSO discharges; significantly mitigate known chronic flooding in the Northeast Boundary drainage area and improve the water quality of the Anacostia River. This paper presents the unique combination of Owner and Contractor perspectives of the entire Project from conception through procurement, execution, and contract management, providing lesson learned, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented to deliver the Project successfully.\n\n9:05 am\n\nQuality Control of Deep Bedrock Tunneling in Urban Areas: A Case Study of Louisville MSD’s Ohio River Tunnel\n\nReese True; Black & Veatch, Louisville, Kentucky, United States\n\nAlston Noronha; Black & Veatch, Louisville, Kentucky, United States\n\nMark Bradford; Black & Veatch, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States\n\nJacob Mathis; Louisville MSD, Louisville, Kentucky, United States\n\nIn June 2022, Louisville MSD completed a 6.5-km (4.0-mi), 6.1-m (20-ft.) diameter CSO conveyance and storage tunnel system located along the Ohio River in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. For large diameter shaft and tunnel construction, drill-and-blast operations among other methodologies were used in close proximity to federal, commercial, and residential properties with no impact to stakeholder infrastructure. As one of the first major tunneling projects in Louisville’s metropolitan area, this paper explores Black & Veatch’s rigorous geotechnical instrumentation monitoring program that provided quality assurance for local stakeholders and affirmed innovative tunneling solutions can be successfully executed in an urban setting.\n\n10:20 am\n\nBig Data in Design-Build: Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel Expansion Supplemental Site Investigation\n\nAmanda Wachenfeld; Design Joint Venture (Mott MacDonald), Austin, Texas, United States\n\nFrankie Perrone; Design Joint Venture (Mott MacDonald), New York, New York, United States\n\nBrian Keaney; Design Joint Venture (HDR), Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nJean-Michel Charpentier; Hampton Roads Connector Partners, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nMartha Gross; Virginia Department of Transportation, Norfolk, Virginia, United States\n\nThe Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel (HRBT) Expansion widens the existing four-lane bridge-tunnel corridor to eight lanes through construction of two parallel tunnels, interstate widening, and bridge expansions. As part of the design-build contract, a supplemental geotechnical investigation was completed to support the design. The investigation for the subaqueous tunnel segment consisted of over 48,400 linear feet of drilling and 7,100 laboratory tests. This paper discusses the challenges of planning and executing a large-scale geotechnical investigation for underground works in a marine environment and the use of big data for effectively managing, interpreting, and transmitting data to the design-builder consistently throughout the investigation.\n\n10:50 am\n\nGround Freezing with Liquid Nitrogen for TBM Cutterhead Maintenance\n\nJoseph Sopko; Keller North America, Rockaway, New Jersey, United States\n\nXavier Dontigny; EBC Inc., Brossard, Quebec, Canada\n\nFor the REM (Réseau Express Métropolitain) project, a 2500 m tunnel was built using a tunnel boring machine (TBM) under the Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport (ADM). Although the geology under the Montreal Airport (ADM) would have been suitable for an excavation with a hard rock machine, the first section required an earth pressure balance (EPB) TBM due to the soft soil located under wetlands. After excavating 280 m, the TBM was blocked in a transition zone of unconsolidated, water-bearing soils directly above the underlying bedrock. A free air intervention was not possible due to these geological conditions. After several failed attempts to create a slurry cake for hyperbaric interventions, a ground freezing system was designed and implemented, incorporating angled pipes drilled from outside the wetlands to directly in front of the cutterhead. This paper discusses the engineering required to form a frozen, water-tight zone in front of the cutterhead using liquid nitrogen. It also describes the complex method of replacing the disc cutters while holding the ground freezing system active in a manner protecting the health and safety of the workers.\n\n11:20 am\n\nContractual Practice in SEM/ NATM – Tunneling in Austria and Germany\n\nRichard Gradnik; BeMo Tunnelling GmbH, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria\n\nWolfgang Holzer; Brenner Basistunnel BBT SE, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria\n\nStefan Auderer; BeMo Tunnelling GmbH, Innsbruck, Austria, Austria\n\nLukas Erkurt; BeMo Tunnelling GmbH, Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria\n\nSEM/ NATM Tunneling contracts in Austria and Germany are usually tendered applying unit price contracts.

The purpose of this paper is to detail the investigation and subsequent determination that acid producing materials would affect the project during construction as well as long-term exposure of tunnel lining and permanent components during the operational life cycle of the tunnel and pump station. Details regarding the interaction between tunnel components and the acid producing material are also provided.\n\n10:50 am\n\nDesign Development of the I-35 Capital Express Central Drainage Tunnels\n\nJames Parkes; Schnabel Engineering, Owings Mills, Maryland, United States\n\nMark Kroncke; Schnabel Engineering, Longmont, Colorado, United States\n\nDan Goodin; BGE, Inc., Austin, Texas, United States\n\nJoseph Goessling; Texas Department of Transportation, Austin, Texas, United States\n\nThe I-35 Capital Expressway (CapEx) Central Drainage Tunnels will serve as a stormwater collection system for the forthcoming I-35 Capital Express Central reconstruction project through downtown Austin, Texas. The schematic level concept design included three tunnels, 10 to 14 ft ID, totaling 26,000 LF. Constructability reviews during design development indicated issues with the concept design including phasing of construction, conflicts with future retaining walls, staging area concerns, and significant mixed face tunneling. The design was updated to mitigate these risks. The revised design includes two tunnels, both 22-ft ID and totaling 33,000 LF, that will be mined almost entirely in rock.\n\n11:20 am\n\nReconnecting Urban Landscapes through Highway Lidding and Tunneling: A Comprehensive Study on Methodologies, Benefits, and Safety Considerations\n\nKatie Theis; HNTB Corporation, New York, New York, United States\n\nBernd Hagenah; HNTB Corporation, New York, New York, United States\n\nPetr Pospisil; HNTB Corporation, New York, New York, United States\n\nChristina Lauzon; HNTB, New York, New York, United States\n\nLidding over or tunneling existing transportation infrastructure is currently under review in several U.S. cities. The main reasons for this are the use of the created space for urban development, the reduction of noise and exhaust fumes for the residents, and, thus, a significant increase in the quality of life. The main aspects to be considered during the planning process are (1) total investment and operational costs, (2) impact of construction works on current traffic, (3) safety and fire protection, and (4) socio-environmental issues.

Unlike many other natural resources, water cannot be substituted by anything and must therefore be handled with the utmost care. Depending on the region and the possible shortage of water, the importance of water increases even further. Water consumption is not the only factor. In the construction industry, water pollution from auxiliary and operating materials and processes as well as other contaminants and their resulting load on wastewater play an important role. The sources for wastewater on tunneling construction sites are various: Washing water, seepage water accumulating in construction pits, tunnel water, water used in the slurry circuit in fluid-assisted tunneling methods or water from concrete work and stone cutting – all these waters are contaminated with a range of pollutants like solids, hydrocarbons, heavy metals, etc. These contaminants can be removed or treated/ reduced with the help of specifically designed wastewater treatment plants (WTPs). After the treatment the cleaned water can be either, in best case, reused on the construction site itself or discharged into water utilities like the available sewer or river pin respecting their discharge requirements. Due to dwindling water resources globally, the continuously rising discharge limits and the ever more important aspect of sustainability the use of WTPs on tunneling construction site will be indispensable. In this paper, it will be presented how these systems are designed and work, what advantages they offer environmentally as well as financially and what to look out for when planning and implementing such a system onto jobsite.\n\nCase Histories: TBM Performances and Challenges I\n\nPresidential D\n\nChairs: Tolga Togan; WSP, Newark, NJ\n\nCarlo Cattelan; Technopref, Montreal West, PQ\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nUltra-Long Tunnel Drive with TBM for the Construction of the Project York Potash Mine\n\nDr. Karin Bäppler; Herrenknecht AG, Schwanau, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany\n\nWerner Burger; Herrenknecht AG, Schwanau, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany\n\nA new polyhalite fertilizer mine is currently being developed in the UK by Anglo American Crop Nutrients.

It will be the first transportation tunnel constructed in the Mid-Atlantic region using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), a 44-foot-diameter Earth Pressure Balance (EPB) named “Chessie”, manufactured by Herrenknecht, and which was assembled at the CBBT’s southernmost island, with extremely limited room, live adjacent traffic, and difficult access. “Chessie” was successfully launched in February 2023 and this paper describes this complex and challenging process.\n\nDesign: Innovative Designs\n\nPresidential A\n\nChairs: Saeid Rashidi; HATCH, Belle Mead, NJ\n\nMichael Deutscher; Jacobs, Attleboro, MA\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nTunnel Euralpin Lyon Turin CO8 – Design of Temporary Support Profile of Base Tunnels and Cross-Passages\n\nFrancesc Rich; Pini France Engineers S.A.S, Saint Ouen, Paris, France\n\nBarbara Bitetti; Pini France Engineers S.A.S, Saint Ouen, Paris, France\n\nElisa Comis; Pini Group USA Inc., Washington, District of Columbia, United States\n\nGiuseppe Ragazzo; Systra-SWS, Torino, Piemonte, Italy\n\nJulien Pepiot; Demathieu Bard Construction, Paris, France\n\nStefano Lione; Tunnel Euralpin Lyon Turn (TELT), Collegno, Italy\n\nThe new Lyon-Turin railway project involves the construction of a 57 km twin-tube tunnel between France and Italy. Pini France (project leader) and Systra-SWS are the designers of Construction Site 8 (CO8). This part of the project includes the construction of the tunnel portal on the Villard-Clément platform, two 2.8 km long tubes of the base tunnel in the direction of Saint Martin la Porte, the cross-passages between tubes and the niches. This paper presents the general approach followed to design the temporary support for the base tunnel, crosspassages, and technical rooms. The design of the temporary support accounts for the variability of the ground and water conditions, the excavation attended behavior, the construction planning and the identified geological hazards that could be encountered along the alignment. Particular attention is paid to the intersections between the tunnels both in terms of numerical modelling and construction methods and phases. Two types of intersections are present in the project: the intersections between the cross-passages and the base tunnel and the intersections between the base tunnel and the niches. 3D models have been developed for the tunnel intersections.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nTo Swell or Not to Swell – Design of Underground Structures in the Presence of Swelling Clays\n\nDaniel Maine; Brierley Associates, Austin, Texas, United States\n\nSwelling clay soils have been problematic to many types of infrastructure in the United States. However, their impact on underground construction is often misunderstood. The use of swell pressures in design of initial tunnel and shaft support lacks proper guidance and is often mis-interpreted. This paper provides insight and guidance on how to implement a geotechnical investigation program to determine if swelling soil exists at a site and how it impacts the design of temporary support systems for underground projects. An example is provided for how swell pressures were incorporated into the design of an initial support system for a rib and lagging tunnel system and problems that occurred.\n\n3:00 pm\n\nExperimental Characterization of Large Diameter Tunnel Lining Radial Joint Rotation Behavior\n\nMike Mooney; Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, United States\n\nHaotian Zheng; Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, United States\n\nThis paper summarizes the results of an experimental program conducted to characterize the moment-rotation behavior of skewed flat radial joints from large diameter (45 ft) tunnel lining. Both positive and negative joint moment-rotation behaviors were measured experimentally using two-segment joint combination assemblies. The results are compared to closed form methodologies used by designers, e.g., the Janssen method. The differences in observed and model behavior are discussed within the context of design practice.\n\n3:30 pm\n\nImpact of High-Speed Operation on Tunnel Planning\n\nBernd Hagenah; HNTB Corporation, New York, New York, United States\n\nPetr Pospisil; HNTB Corporation, New York, New York, United States\n\nColin Santangelo; HNTB, New York, New York, United States\n\nThis paper explores the profound implications of high-speed train operation on tunnel planning, specifically investigating ongoing high-speed rail projects in California and Texas. The paper delves into the crucial considerations for designing high-speed rail tunnels, including selecting tunnel sections based on aerodynamic factors, which impact traction power requirements and pressure comfort. The paper also examines the need for emergency stations, maintenance access, and comprehensive safety and rescue concepts to address train incidents. Drawing from international high-speed rail projects, it shares valuable experiences and lessons learned to promote efficient and secure tunnel designs for high-speed train operations.\n\n4:00 pm\n\nThreading the Needle: Design and Construction of the Parallel Thimble Shoal Tunnel Project\n\nSandeep Pyakurel; Mott MacDonald / Chesapeake Tunnel Joint Venture, Arlington, Virginia, United States\n\nFrankie Perrone; Mott MacDonald / Chesapeake Tunnel Joint Venture, New York, New York, United StatesMitchell Gerdau; Mott MacDonald, Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States\n\nEric Crocker; Dragados USA/ Chesapeake Tunnel Joint Venture, Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States\n\nJoan Casado Ortega; Dragados USA/ Chesapeake Tunnel Joint Venture, Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States\n\nThe Parallel Thimble Shoal Tunnel (PTST) project is a part of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel (CBBT) complex. The project involves the construction of a two-lane bored tunnel under the Thimble Shoal Channel between Portal Island #1 (the southernmost island) and Portal Island #2. The new PTST will be the first transportation tunnel constructed in the Mid-Atlantic region by a tunnel boring machine (TBM). This paper describes the design and construction of the tunnel approach structure in an open marine environment with the strategies employed to overcome the various construction challenges. The project is unique since the entire tunnel approach structure is built on a very limited area within an open marine environment without any reclamation of the existing island.\n\nPlanning: Underground Project Risk\n\nPresidential B\n\nChairs: Paul Savard; MWRA, Ashland, MA\n\nReza Lotfi; COWI, Mc Lean, VA\n\n1:30 pm\n\nIntroductions\n\n1:35 pm\n\nIntegration of Century Old Mont Royal Tunnel into Montreal New Light Rail Transit Network\n\nMohammad Motallebi; AECOM, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n\nBehrouz Esmaeilkhanian; AECOM, Montreal, Quebec, Canada\n\nVerya Nasri; AECOM, New York, New York, United States\n\nRéseau Express Métropolitain (REM) is the new Light Rail Transit (LRT) network of Montreal, Canada. This new LRT network uses a century-old Mont Royal Tunnel (MRT) to connect Downtown Montreal to the north side of the Island of Montreal by passing through Mount Royal Mountain. This railway double track horseshoe tunnel is approximately 5 km (3.1 mi.) long, 8.8 m (29 ft.) wide and 5.5 m (18 ft.) high, with a constant 0.6% grade. Due to different geological characteristics of the surrounding ground, varied from hard rock to soft soil, different cross sections and excavation methods were adopted for construction of this tunnel. In order to use MRT in the modern transit system, the tunnel needed to be inspected, rehabilitated and be compliant to the recent safety standards. This paper presents a summary of history and characteristics of the existing tunnel plus the implemented steps to upgrade the tunnel. It includes the details of the structural inspection and rehabilitation methods of the tunnel. Further, this paper summarizes the procedures for the space proofing, construction of the separation center wall, and the tunnel enlargement. It also de-scribes parts of complications encountered during the construction and solutions implemented to tackle these issues.\n\n2:05 pm\n\nRisk Mitigation for the Big Walnut Sewer Tunnel Construction in Columbus, Ohio\n\nIrwan Halim; AECOM, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, United States\n\nHeather Marsh; Marsh-Wagner, Jacksonville, Florida, United States\n\nRob Herr; City of Columbus Department of Sewerage & Drainage, Columbus, Ohio, United States\n\nThis project will expand sanitary sewer within the City of Columbus. It consists of 2.5 mile long, 72-inch finished diameter pipe grouted inside 10.8-foot diameter tunnel excavation in shale. This paper describes the multi-faceted geotechnical exploration to minimize the underground risks. The tunnel will cross below a buried valley with minimum cover of highly weathered rock. The risk mitigation to cross the valley includes contingencies and cost allowances. Provisions to prevent impact on adjacent groundwater resources will be described. Latest construction updates will be provided including contractor alternate shaft support and pre-excavation probing to mitigate tunneling risk below the valley.\n\n3:00 pm\n\nDurability Design and Construction for Underground Facilities\n\nWern-Ping Chen; Jacobs Engineering, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nDurability risks for underground facilities can be underestimated during design phase as compared to well-known geological risks. However, unclear durability requirements can result in construction schedule delay and change orders. Unlike bridges or buildings, a unified underground durability code or standard does not exist. This paper will provide a durability approach for underground facilities, including degradation modes, mitigations, and compliance measures during construction. In addition, this paper will address how to clearly specify durability requirements in a contract document to reduce disputes during construction and discuss key durability tests that are time consuming and will impact construction schedule if not timely planned.\n\n3:30 pm\n\nHydraulic Testing and Monitoring – (How) Can it Help in Tunnel Construction? A Case Study of the Varberg Tunnel, Sweden\n\nÅsa Fransson; University of Gothenburg and WSP, Sweden, Gothenburg, Västra Götaland, Sweden\n\nWater is a key resource and tunneling’s impacts on groundwater largely relate to inflow and drawdown caused by construction and operation of underground infrastructure. Constructing fully sealed tunnel lining systems or alternatively pre and post grouted drained systems are examples of solutions to reduce and mitigate impacts to acceptable levels. Understanding which is the optimal solution from an engineering, environmental and sustainability perspective requires the geological and hydrogeological setting thoroughly be understood. Based on a Swedish tunnel project, this paper gives examples of how hydraulic testing and monitoring can help assess impacts and help develop appropriate strategies to manage them.\n\n4:00 pm\n\nSurface Water Supply Project – Segment B3 Long Tunnel – Houston, TX\n\nWilliam Hodder; Jay Dee Contractors, Katy, Texas, United States\n\nNate Long; Jay Dee Contractors Inc. dba, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nPhil Rhodes; Jay Dee Contractors Inc. dba, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nSergio Flores; Black & Veatch, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nTim McQueary; HB Trenchless, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nThe Surface Water Supply Project Segment B3 is a 4 miles section of tunnel that will run East-West in Houston TX, from Hopper St to I-45.
