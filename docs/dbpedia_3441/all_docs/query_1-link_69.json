        "text": "We have important tunnel ventilation equipment at Lane Cover River West and Scotts Creek. If wastewater levels rise above a certain point at these sites, control gates or penstocks open and channel the overflow into the tunnel.\n\nIf the tunnel capacity nears 70 million litres in wet weather, the airflow is reversed. The ventilation fan at North Head is automatically turned off and ventilation fans at Lane Cove and Scotts Creek start up. As the tunnel fills, air is extracted by the Lane Cove and Scotts Creek fans.\n\nAir discharged from the Lane Cove and Scotts Creek sites passes through 3 filters before being released into the atmosphere. The filters include a pre-filter, a granular-activated carbon filter and a final filter.\n\nAll equipment at the Quakers Hat Bay site is underground. The site is connected to the Northern Suburbs Ocean Outfall System (NSOOS).\n\nIf the flow of diluted wastewater rises in the NSOOS, it's channelled into the Quakers Hat Bay site and into the tunnel. If the tunnel is full, an isolation control gate or penstock closes. This channels the overflow into a purpose-built weir and discharges it into Quakers Hat Bay.\n\nAt Shelly Beach, a weir collects any overflow from the Manly Ocean Outfall System and channels it into a borehole that flows into the Northside Storage Tunnel.\n\nIf the tunnel is full, the overflow is discharged into the ocean. The Marine Parade outfall, near Shelly Beach, is no longer needed.\n\nThe North Head Water Resource Recovery Facility is on the coast near Manly. The cliff-face bypass weir and siphon at the facility's inlet channel prevent underground flooding if there's power or major equipment failure.\n\nThe tunnel reduces the need for the cliff-face discharge. It does this by allowing wastewater to divert into the tunnel during power or major equipment failure. The tunnel pumping station is monitored and controlled by the facilityâ€™s SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system.\n\nWe monitor all sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All data is recorded and sent via telemetry to our Systems Operations Centre. We track, monitor and report all critical data and assess and respond to any alarms. Although the Systems Operations Centre coordinates communication for all sites, each site is designed to operate safely and independently if there's a communications failure."
