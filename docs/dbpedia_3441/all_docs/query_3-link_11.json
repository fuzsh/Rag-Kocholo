        "text": "Getting NSW moving\n\nWestConnex is Australia’s largest tunnel road infrastructure project and is a critical part of a broader plan to get Sydney, and Australia, moving again. Along with the NSW Government’s record investment in public transport infrastructure, WestConnex is easing congestion, creating tens of thousands of jobs, and connecting communities.\n\nWestConnex was completed in November 2023 and provides motorists with a continuous, 33km traffic-light free motorway network, with connections for future projects linking the north shore, Sydney Airport and the southern suburbs.\n\nMostly underground, WestConnex has freed up large areas in communities that are being turned into 18ha of parks, playgrounds and recreational facilities. In addition, WestConnex is delivering and planting more than 1 million trees and plants.\n\nThrough in-tunnel technology, removing congestion and by taking the roads underground, early indications show that air quality around the tunnels improves once the tunnels open.\n\nConstruction of the projects has also created a skills legacy, with thousands of workers undertaking certified training that will help staff future projects.\n\nWestConnex is being delivered in four major stages:\n\nThe New M4, opened in July 2019. The WestConnex M4, including the 5.5km New M4 Tunnels, connects Haberfield to Parramatta and the M4. Motorists on this section of WestConnex are saving an average of 35 minutes on their westbound peak time journey compared to Parramatta Road.\n\nThe M8, opened in July 2020. The 9km twin tunnels connects the M5 at Kingsgrove to a new interchange at St Peters, with 6ha of new open space, built on a remediated former landfill site. The tunnels cut up to 30 minutes off a trip between Liverpool and the southern CBD.\n\nThe new extensions of the M4 and M8 opened in January 2023, linking the M4 at Haberfield with the M8 at St Peters, with future connections to the Anzac and Iron Cove bridges via the Rozelle Interchange.\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange opened to traffic in November 2023. The Rozelle Interchange connects the M4 to the Anzac Bridge and the M8 to the City West Link and Victoria Road and provides a toll-free bypass of Victoria Road known as the Iron Cove Link and connections to the future Western Harbour Tunnel. Rozelle Interchange has been built almost entirely underground, freeing up space for a new public parklands."
