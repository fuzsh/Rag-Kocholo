        "text": "In vehicular tunnel fire safety design, very low design fires [1] were adopted as reported [2,3] years ago. This assumption has to be reviewed because the style of living, the traffic flow, passenger loading, the amount of combustibles carried by cars, cargo vans or light goods vehicles (LGV) and heavy goods vehicles (HGV), and the expectations of citizens have drastically changed. Therefore, all these changes pose great challenges to the fire safety provisions for vehicular tunnels. Further, fire technology has improved significantly in the past decades, making it easier to put out big fires. This is the right time to review the fire safety provisions for both existing tunnels and the forthcoming tunnel projects. Note that there are urban traffic link tunnels (UTLT) [4] in China. Some identified problems can also be solved by using the new experimental data on heat release rate upon burning different types of vehicles. In 2011, the design fire was increased to 100 MW for HGVs in NFPA 502 [5].\n\nFire tests are used to determine whether fire protection products meet the minimum performance criteria set out in codes and legislation, as well as to certify these products. Experimental large-scale fires are used to test the performance of safety systems in tunnels, which are confined environments with a high probability of accidents and significant consequences due to the evolution of the event and whether there is the capability of counteracting it by safety measures. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. We searched the Scopus and Web of Science databases for publications from 2013 to 2022, resulting in a selection of 72 articles. An analysis was conducted on the following main topics: tunnel fires, fire characteristics (measured variables, spread, and smoke), model-scale tests, automatic shutdown systems, and ventilation solutions. One of the most important contributions of this study is the suggestion that fire tests represen...\n\nRoad tunnels are critical components of most transportation systems around the world. Ensuring fire safety in road tunnels is more challenging than ever due to the specific features of the tunnels, increased traffic and inadequate safety rules. The analysis of actual fire incidents has indicated that fires in tunnels tend to be hotter, last longer, and to be more destructive than was generally expected. This made rescue operations and fire extinguishment by the fire services more difficult. Les tunnels routiers sont des éléments critiques de la plupart des réseaux de transport dans le monde. Or, il est plus problématique que jamais d&#39;assurer la sécurité incendie dans ces tunnels, en raison des caractéristiques propres à ces ouvrages, de l&#39;augmentation de la circulation routière et de l&#39;inadéquation des règles de sécurité. L?analyse d&#39;incendies réels nous apprend que les incendies dans les tunnels ont tendance à présenter une combustion plus vive, à brûler plus longte...\n\nThe basic aim of this treatise is to research in-to relevant features of the control and manage-ment of fire event in a road tunnel. The simula-tion of 200 meters long cut out of the road tun-nel is performed with the computer code FDS (Fire Dynamics Simulator), which basis on com-putational fluid dynamics. FDS is used to simu-late fire dynamics behavior at three different scenarios: natural ventilation, forced ventilation with axial ventilators and vertical smoke extrac-tion. It is believed that the present research, the methodology applied and its findings should promote and improve safety and reliability of fire safety in road tunnels and to cope with the complex contemporary logistic demands of safe-ty and reliability in the transportation of passen-gers and goods.\n\nThe durability of various typical tunnel sections in the event of a prescribed 100 MW fire has been assessed. Cast-iron sections, pre-cast concrete sections and in-situ concrete cut and cover sections are all considered to be part of a 1 km long road tunnel. An analysis of the tunnel constructions and surrounding geology (based on a real tunnel) has led to the estimation of failure temperatures for the structural elements, internal cladding systems, jet fans and their fixings. A commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code was used to simulate various fire scenarios and calculate the times to failure of tunnel elements. Simulations were carried out for fires in different locations for the three section types. In parallel to the CFD study, an analytical model was devised to predict gas temperatures in the tunnel. Both models used the same input variables and general assumptions and great attention was given to establish the highest possible accuracy for all input variables and ..."
