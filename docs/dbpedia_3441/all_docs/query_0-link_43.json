        "text": "This chapter outlines the potential traffic and transport impacts associated with the M4-M5 Link project (the project). A detailed traffic and transport assessment has been prepared for the project and is included in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport). This chapter provides a summary of the technical working paper and details:\n\nThe assessment methodology and approach used to carry out the traffic and transport assessment\n\nThe existing traffic and transport environment within the study area\n\nFuture traffic and transport conditions without the project\n\nPotential impacts of the project on the road network during construction and operation\n\nRecommended safeguards and management measures to avoid, minimise and/or mitigate potential traffic and transport impacts.\n\nThe Secretary of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DP&E) has issued environmental assessment requirements for the project. These are referred to as Secretary’s Environmental Assessment Requirements (SEARs). Table 8-1 sets out these requirements and the associated desired performance outcomes as they relate to traffic and transport, and identifies where they have been addressed in this environmental impact statement (EIS).\n\n8.1 Assessment methodology\n\nThe transport network in Sydney is expected to be put under increasing pressure over the next 20 years. A Plan for Growing Sydney (NSW Government 2014) indicated that from 2011 to 2031, Sydney’s population is forecast to increase from 4.3 to 5.9 million, which equates to an average of around 80,000 additional residents per year. Moreover, by 2036, the number of trips made around Sydney each day is forecast to increase by 31 per cent from 16 to 21 million vehicle movements. This growth will place increasing pressure on the NSW transport network and the key travel demand corridors connecting regional cities and major centres across the greater Sydney metropolitan area, as shown in Figure 8-1.\n\nKey corridors currently accommodate high levels of daily traffic including freight, commuter and leisure travel. Users of these corridors frequently experience congestion and delay, particularly during weekday and weekend peak periods. Both the NSW Long Term Transport Master Plan (Transport for NSW 2012) and the State Infrastructure Strategy Update 2014 (State Infrastructure Strategy) (Infrastructure NSW 2014) identified the need to plan and invest in the future of Sydney’s motorway network, which provides vital infrastructure connections within and between key travel demand corridors. Any investment in motorway infrastructure must be aligned with supporting public and active transport initiatives to achieve an increase in capacity, while aiming to reduce the reliance on and demand for private vehicles on the future road network.\n\nThe WestConnex project is one part of a broader solution to these growing pressures. While public transport is also part of the overall transport plan, it is recognised that not all trips across Sydney can be served by public transport, especially trips to dispersed destinations, commercial trips requiring the movement of large or heavy goods/materials or trade and service-related journeys. In addition, Sydney is home to two-thirds of NSW’s manufacturing sector, with many of the state’s major aviation, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, electronics and automotive industries based in western Sydney. These businesses rely heavily on the road network and its connectivity to the port and airport precincts.\n\nA congested road network also affects public transport; with bus travel times experiencing the same delays as other road users. Providing new, tunnel alternatives to sections of the arterial road network will improve road-based public transport travel times and provide opportunities for new rapid transit options.\n\nFor these reasons, the NSW Government is investing in light rail, metro, bus rapid transit and motorways to provide a multi-modal response to current and future transport challenges. In this context, WestConnex is also an enabler of integrated transport and land use planning, supporting the development of initiatives including The Bays Precinct and the Parramatta Road Corridor Urban Transformation Strategy.\n\nThe key strategic traffic objectives of the project are to:\n\nProvide an efficient motorway link between the M4 and M5 motorways and improve traffic flow on the motorway network\n\nEnable long term motorway network development, including facilitating new cross-harbour capacity and connections to Sydney’s south\n\nImprove accessibility and reliability of commercial vehicle movement in the M4 and M5 corridors to economic centres, including to Sydney Airport and Port Botany economic zone\n\nImprove traffic conditions and ease future congestion on the inner western and south-western network, including Parramatta Road, supporting urban regeneration and growth\n\nImprove overall network productivity.\n\nA detailed discussion of the strategic context and justification for the project is provided in Chapter 3 (Strategic context and project need). This includes a description of transport policies, strategies and plans that are relevant to the project and the WestConnex program of works. A description of the alternatives to the project, which explains how and why the project design was selected as the preferred option for assessment in this EIS is provided in Chapter 4 (Project development and alternatives).\n\nFigure 8-1 Sydney travel demand corridors\n\n8.1.2 Traffic forecasting and modelling process\n\nThe Technical working paper: Traffic and transport (Appendix H) has assessed the potential impacts of the project during construction and operation, including cumulative impacts associated with the WestConnex program of works, as well as the proposed future Sydney Gateway, Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link and the F6 Extension projects.\n\nThe traffic and transport impact assessment undertaken for the project consisted of three key components:\n\nCharacterising the existing traffic and transport environment within the study area using a combination of data from Transport for NSW Transport Performance and Analytics and Roads and Maritime, traffic counts and survey data. A description of the study area for the traffic and transport assessment is included in section 8.1.4\n\nThe development and application of a regional strategic traffic model; the WestConnex Road Traffic Model (WRTM), to determine the anticipated future growth in traffic on the road network in the Sydney metropolitan area, based on planned and forecast changes in population and employment, and to understand the metropolitan-wide impacts of the project\n\nOperational modelling of the road network to determine the traffic and transport conditions in future years with and without the project on roads:\n\nAround the Wattle Street interchange\n\nOn the M4-M5 Link Motorway\n\nAround the Rozelle interchange\n\nAround St Peters interchange\n\nAround the construction ancillary facilities during construction of the project.\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment, as well as the methodology for undertaking these key traffic and transport assessments is discussed in section 8.1.4 to section 8.1.8.\n\n8.1.3 Relevant guidelines and policies\n\nThe following guidelines were followed in carrying out the traffic and transport assessment:\n\nGuide to Traffic Management – Part 3 Traffic Studies and Analysis (Austroads 2013)\n\nTraffic Modelling Guidelines (NSW Roads and Maritime Services (Roads and Maritime) 2013)\n\nGuide to Traffic Generating Developments Version 2.2 (NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) 2002).\n\n8.1.4 Study area\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment was informed by the forecast traffic and transport changes from the WRTM version 2.3 (WRTM v2.3), a strategic traffic model that covers the Sydney metropolitan area. The extent of the study area and the areas requiring operational modelling assessment were determined through analysis of forecast WRTM v2.3 traffic flow differences as a result of the project. This process allowed for identification of those areas of Sydney’s road network where the project was forecast to have a substantial impact (adverse or beneficial).\n\nThe study area for the traffic and transport assessment is shown in Figure 8-2 and broadly encompasses an area extending from the Parramatta River in the north to Sydney Airport in the south, and from the Eastern Distributor in the east to Haberfield and Marrickville in the west. The study area is predominantly focussed on the corridor between Haberfield and Rozelle, the corridor between Rozelle and St Peters, the corridor between Haberfield and St Peters, and the surface road networks around the Wattle Street, Rozelle and St Peters interchanges.\n\nChanges on strategic roads outside of this study area are assessed in the Sydney metropolitan road network sections in this chapter, and those outside the operational model areas are assessed through a screenline analysis, presented in section 8.3.3. Further justification of the study area is contained in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport).\n\n8.3 Assessment of potential impacts\n\n8.3.1 Construction\n\nDuring construction, the project may affect the surrounding road network as a result of:\n\nConstruction vehicles using the surface road network, especially heavy vehicles transporting spoil\n\nSurface road works, requiring temporary traffic, cyclist and/or pedestrian diversions, road occupation and temporary road closures\n\nTemporary changes to speed limits.\n\nOverview of construction traffic and vehicle routes\n\nConstruction of the project would result in additional heavy and light vehicle movements on the road network in three broad categories:\n\nRemoval of spoil generated by construction activities\n\nHeavy vehicle deliveries and other heavy vehicles involved in construction activities\n\nLight vehicle movements associated with construction of the project.\n\nConstruction traffic routes for the project would use the existing motorway and arterial road network as much as possible, reducing traffic related impacts on local roads.\n\nSpoil would be transported from construction ancillary facilities to spoil management locations, generally along arterial roads and the M4 East Motorway, the New M5 Motorway, the M5 East Motorway and the M5 South West Motorway.\n\nConstruction traffic management and access\n\nConstruction traffic generation and distribution\n\nThe project would generate around four million cubic metres of spoil, the majority of which would be generated from excavation of the tunnels. As such, the primary facilities for receipt and dispatch of spoil would be the tunnel construction sites.\n\nThe project would seek to reuse at least 95 per cent of uncontaminated spoil, either within the project or at other locations. Where reasonable and practicable, spoil would be managed according to the following hierarchy:\n\nMinimisation of spoil generation through design and management\n\nReuse of spoil within the project\n\nBeneficial reuse of spoil outside the project\n\nWhere reuse is not possible, disposal of spoil would be the last resort.\n\nFive potential sites have been identified for receiving excess spoil from the project, as summarised in Table 8-41. Negotiations for the final destination(s) for excess spoil would be carried out during detailed design, and may include one or more of the sites listed in Table 8-41 or other alternatives.\n\nTable 8-41 Potential spoil management sites\n\nNote: The Horsley Park spoil management site is a manufacturing facility and currently does not have a definitive limit for the amount of spoil it can receive.\n\nIndicative haulage routes from the construction ancillary facilities are shown in Chapter 6 (Construction work) and in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport). Spoil haulage routes would be confirmed during detailed design. Delivery of concrete to support tunnel construction would originate from batching plants close to the project footprint, although other sources may also be required. Other materials required for construction would, where available, originate from within the Sydney region and surrounds and would be delivered by vehicles using the arterial road network to access the various construction sites.\n\nTable 8-42 provides details of light and heavy vehicle volumes predicted to arrive and depart from construction ancillary facilities during a typical AM peak hour, PM peak hour and daily period. Light vehicles are comprised of passenger and commercial vehicles. The table shows that the highest volumes of heavy and light construction vehicles are forecast at the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5). Construction vehicles would use the M4 East and New M5 tunnels at Haberfield and St Peters rather than the surface road network, wherever possible.\n\nThe daily and peak hour volumes shown in Table 8-42 are based around targeted spoil haulage between 7.00 am and 6.00 pm. However, 24 hour spoil haulage would be required during tunnelling at five construction ancillary facilities, and the table shows indicative heavy vehicle volumes for these sites. Spoil haulage would only occur during standard daytime construction hours at the Darley Road civil and tunnel site to minimise heavy vehicle movements at night at this location. The peak hour\n\nidentified is representative of highest estimated construction volumes and falls within the broader peak periods experienced on the network.\n\nConstruction workforce parking\n\nA number of the project’s staff and labour force would be expected to drive to construction sites and would therefore require car parking. The number of construction personnel requiring parking would vary over the duration of the construction program.\n\nIt is anticipated that construction workforce parking would be primarily provided at the following sites:\n\nNorthcote Street civil site (C3a) – around 150 car parking spaces (Option A)\n\nParramatta Road East civil site (C3b) – around 140 car parking spaces (Option B)\n\nRozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) – around 400 car parking spaces\n\nCampbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10) – around 150 car parking spaces.\n\nThese facilities would be used to provide worker parking and shuttle bus transfers to other nearby construction sites.\n\nDue to the generally constrained nature of the other construction sites, only minimal car parking for construction workers would be provided at these locations. Typically, these sites would provide between four to 20 parking spaces intended to be used by engineers and other construction management staff. Parking of construction-related vehicles in adjacent local roads would occur, particularly during site establishment.\n\nThe construction workforce would be encouraged to use public transport. Victoria Road and Parramatta Road are major transport corridors that have multiple bus routes. The Inner West Light Rail Line runs along the southern side of City West Link with stops near the Rozelle Rail Yards at Rozelle Bay and Lilyfield; and at the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (Leichhardt North light rail stop). The T3 Bankstown Line stops at St Peters Station around 800 metres north of the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site. However, workers starting or ending shifts very early or very late would be more likely to use private vehicles.\n\nA car parking strategy would be developed as part of the Construction Traffic and Access Management Plan (CTAMP) to limit impacts on parking for the surrounding communities. The strategy would be developed in consultation with local councils and stakeholders associated with public facilities adjacent to project sites, as well as with the M4 East and New M5 contractors (where relevant) to identify opportunities to access parking during their respective construction periods and once those periods are completed.\n\nThe car parking strategy would include items such as forecasting of construction parking demand, review of existing parking supply and use on local streets in the area, impact on existing parking, consultation activities and proposed mitigation measures, such as management of workforce parking and transport, alternative parking arrangements and communication and engagement. This would include the identification of areas where there are high levels of existing parking demand around the construction ancillary facilities and works sites and identifying alternative car parking sites for use by the construction workforce. Processes for monitoring, reporting and corrective actions would also be part of the strategy.\n\nTable 8-42 Indicative daily and peak period construction traffic volumes\n\nNotes:\n\n1: Spoil haulage would occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week\n\n2: Indicative daily, AM and PM peak hour construction traffic volumes for a cumulative impact scenario where a section of the Rozelle civil and tunnel site (C5) is handed over for use for construction of the proposed future Western Harbour Tunnel and Beaches Link project are included in Table 8-42. These indicative construction traffic volumes have been used to carry out the cumulative construction traffic impact assessment in Chapter 26 (Cumulative impacts)\n\nAccess routes\n\nThe proposed access routes to the construction ancillary facilities are summarised in Table 8-43 and shown in Chapter 6 (Construction work). Wherever possible, access is proposed to be gained directly from major arterial roads. The project is also investigating the use of a marshalling area for spoil trucks to further assist in staggering the arrival of vehicles to site. This would be located in a non- residential area and in close proximity to the arterial road network and construction ancillary facilities where tunnelling would occur. This measure would assist in preventing queuing and parking of heavy vehicles on local roads in the vicinity of the project.\n\nThe distribution of light vehicles across the road network would be more varied. For the purposes of this assessment, light vehicle trips have been considered on top of background traffic and distributed accordingly. For all sites, except for the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10), the distribution of access is assumed to be via the M4 Motorway, Victoria Road, Anzac Bridge and Parramatta Road, with the proportion via each varying for each site. For the Campbell Road civil and tunnel site (C10), access for light vehicles is assumed to be divided equally between access from the Princes Highway from the north and the south.\n\nTable 8-43 Indicative access routes to and from construction ancillary facilities\n\nSite Access and egress points Heavy vehicles1 Light vehicles Wattle Street civil and tunnel site (C1a)\n\nParramatta Road then Wattle Street via M4-M5 Link entry and exit ramps\n\nParramatta Road then Wattle Street northern (eastbound) carriageway (right in, right out)\n\nHaberfield civil and tunnel site (C2a)\n\nBelow ground: via the WestConnex M4 East tunnels\n\nAbove ground: Wattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nWattle Street southern westbound) carriageway (left-in, left-out)\n\nWalker Avenue\n\nParramatta Road\n\nNorthcote Street civil site (C3a)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nWolseley Street\n\nWattle Street (left-out)\n\nParramatta Road West civil and tunnel site (C1b)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nAlt Street (crossover between sites only)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nAlt Street\n\nHaberfield civil site (C2b)\n\nWattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nWattle Street (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nWalker Avenue (left-in, left-out)\n\nParramatta Road East civil site (C3b)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left- out)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nAlt Street\n\nBland Street\n\nDarley Road civil and tunnel site (C4)\n\nCity West Link then Darley Road2\n\nCity West Link then Darley Road\n\nRozelle civil and tunnel site (C5)\n\nCity West Link (left-in from eastbound carriageway, right- out to westbound carriageway)\n\nLilyfield Road\n\nThe Crescent civil site (C6)\n\nThe Crescent (left-in, right-out)\n\nThe Crescent\n\nVictoria Road civil site (C7)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nVictoria Road (left in, left out)\n\nHornsey Street\n\nSite Access and egress points Heavy vehicles1 Light vehicles Iron Cove Link civil site (C8)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nVictoria Road (left-in, left-out)\n\nPyrmont Bridge\n\nRoad tunnel site (C9)\n\nParramatta Road (left-in)\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road (left-out)\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road\n\nCampbell Road civil\n\nand tunnel site (C10)\n\nAlbert Street via Campbell\n\nRoad and Princes Highway\n\nAlbert Street via Campbell Road\n\nNotes:\n\nSome use of local roads by heavy vehicles delivering materials and/or equipment may also be required, however this would be minimised as far as practicable.\n\nSpoil haulage vehicles would enter and exit the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (C4) via City West Link.\n\nConstruction ancillary facilities\n\nTwelve construction ancillary facilities are described and assessed in this EIS (see Table 8-44). The construction ancillary facilities would be used for a combination of civil surface works, tunnelling and tunnelling support, construction workforce parking and administrative purposes.\n\nThe number, location and layout of construction ancillary facilities would be finalised as part of detailed construction planning during detailed design and would meet the environmental performance outcomes stated in the EIS and the Submissions and Preferred Infrastructure Report and satisfy criteria identified in any relevant conditions of approval.\n\nTo assist in informing the development of a construction methodology that would manage constructability constraints and the need for construction to occur in a safe and efficient manner, while minimising impacts on local communities, the environment, and users of the surrounding road and other transport networks, two possible combinations of construction ancillary facilities at Haberfield and Ashfield have been assessed in this EIS. The construction ancillary facilities that comprise these options have been grouped together in this EIS and are denoted by the suffix a (for Option A) or b (for Option B) eg C1a Wattle Street civil and tunnel site. Although both of these options have been assessed in this EIS, only one of these options would be used during construction.\n\nTable 8-44 Proposed construction ancillary facilities\n\nSurface construction, including road works, and the establishment of construction ancillary facilities may result in traffic related impacts, including:\n\nAlterations to:\n\nExisting property access\n\nExisting pedestrian and cyclist access and movements\n\nLocation of existing bus stops\n\nLocal traffic environment\n\nTemporary road closures\n\nTemporary impacts on bus stop locations\n\nTemporary changes to pedestrian and cyclist access and movements.\n\nWhere applicable, these impacts have been assessed for each of the areas where surface construction, including road works, would occur. Construction ancillary facility locations are shown in Figure 8-8.\n\n8.3 Assessment of potential impacts\n\n8.3.1 Construction\n\nThe Crescent civil site (C6)\n\nLocation and construction activities\n\nThe Crescent civil site (C6) would be located between The Crescent and Rozelle Bay on land owned by Roads and Maritime. The site would be used to support the realignment of The Crescent, including the construction of a new bridge over Whites Creek, widening and improvement works to Whites Creek, and construction of the drainage outfall and culvert that would direct flows through and from the Rozelle Rail Yards to Rozelle Bay. The construction activities at this location are expected to occur between 2019 and 2021.\n\nEntry and exit\n\nIt is anticipated that heavy vehicles would enter the site via a left-in from The Crescent (southbound). They would then travel through the site, turn around and exit back onto The Crescent northbound via a right hand turn. Temporary traffic management measures would be established to enable access and egress arrangements.\n\nHeavy vehicle movements would be carried out during non-peak periods where feasible and reasonable. Light vehicles would enter via the same arrangement, but may also exit southbound along The Crescent towards Johnston Street.\n\nLocal road impacts\n\nNo impacts from construction vehicles are expected on local roads with heavy and light vehicle access and egress directly to and from The Crescent.\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road tunnel site (C9)\n\nLocation and construction activities\n\nThe Pyrmont Bridge Road tunnel site (C9) would be located between Parramatta Road and Pyrmont Bridge Road at Annandale on land currently occupied by commercial and light industrial premises. The construction ancillary facility would be mainly used to support tunnelling construction activities.\n\nRoadheaders would be launched from this site and would excavate the temporary access tunnel and the mainline tunnels. Spoil handling on the site would occur 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Where practical, spoil would be removed during the day, outside of peak periods. Reasonable and practicable management strategies would be investigated to minimise the volume of heavy vehicle movements at night. The construction activities at this location are expected to occur between 2018 and 2022.\n\nEntry and exit\n\nHeavy vehicle access to the site would be from the northern (eastbound) carriageway of Parramatta Road. Vehicles would enter via a new driveway, travel in an anti-clockwise direction via an internal access road and exit onto Pyrmont Bridge Road via a new temporary signalised intersection. Light vehicle access would be from Pyrmont Bridge Road, either via the temporary signalised intersection or a separate give-way access.\n\nLocal road impacts\n\nNo impacts from construction vehicles are expected on local roads with heavy and light vehicle access and egress directly to and from Parramatta Road and Pyrmont Bridge Road.\n\nWorks would be carried out to realign Bignell Lane between Mallett Street and Pyrmont Bridge Road. Short-term, temporary closure of Bignell Lane would be required during construction to allow for the realignment works, but rear-access to commercial properties along Bignell Lane would be maintained during construction.\n\nIntersection level of service\n\nThe intersection performance results for the road network under the 2021 ‘without construction’ and ‘with construction’ forecast traffic volumes for the AM and PM peak are summarised in Table 8-47 and Table 8-48. These intersection levels of service are not directly comparable to those presented in the operational modelling results, as those had exit blocking constraints, applied in the microsimulation models to reflect network congestion beyond the modelled network extents, removed.\n\nThe intersections assessed were grouped into six corridors (or clusters). A summary of the construction traffic impacts within each of these clusters is provided in the following sections. Detailed discussion on the potential impacts within each cluster is provided in Appendix H (Technical working paper: Traffic and transport).\n\nCluster 5: Parramatta Road at Camperdown\n\nCluster 5 consists of the following intersections:\n\nParramatta Road/Pyrmont Bridge Road\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road/ Pyrmont Bridge Road tunnel site (C9) access\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road/Booth Street/Mallett Street.\n\nAbout 60 PCU and 100 PCU are added to the network in the AM and PM peaks respectively in the ‘with construction’ scenario. This is shown to have minimal impact on the operation of the intersections, with levels of service at both the Parramatta Road/Pyrmont Bridge Road and Pyrmont Bridge Road/Booth Street/Mallett Street intersections forecast to operate at the same level of service as the ‘without construction’ scenario.\n\nThe Pyrmont Bridge Road/C8 site access intersection is forecast to operate at LoS A in both peaks.\n\nSummary\n\nThe construction impact assessment found that the most substantial impacts are forecast to be at the western end of the project footprint, as spoil trucks travel to the potential spoil management sites to the west of the project from the construction ancillary facilities and back. Light construction vehicle traffic would also contribute to these impacts, although these would use more dispersed routes.\n\nMitigation measures to manage these impacts would be developed as part of the CTAMP, and could include:\n\nRestriction of heavy vehicle right turns at City West Link/James Street and City West Link/The Crescent intersections during peak hours\n\nStaggering or rescheduling shift times to avoid a large generation of light vehicles during peak hours.\n\nThe assessment of potential construction traffic and transport impacts is a worst-case assessment based on peak construction traffic levels. Adverse impacts would be expected to reduce once peak construction is complete. A CTAMP will be prepared as part of the CEMP. The CTAMP will include the guidelines, general requirements and principles of traffic management to be implemented during construction and will seek to minimise delays and disruptions and identify and respond to any changes in road safety as a result of highway construction works. Further details on the management of construction impacts are provided in section 8.5.\n\nTable 8-47 Option A – 2021 AM peak hour intersection operational performance summary\n\nNotes: 1Traffic volume rounded to nearest 10\n\nTable 8-48 Option A – 2021 PM peak hour intersection operational performance summary\n\nNotes: 1Traffic volume rounded to nearest 10\n\nTemporary road network changes, closures and diversions\n\nIt is anticipated that road network modifications would be required to facilitate construction of the project. Indicative modifications are outlined in Table 8-49.\n\nRoad network modifications and traffic staging would be reviewed during the preparation of CTAMP, with the objective of minimising disruptions to the road network. At all locations where road closures would be required, access to properties would be maintained during construction. Appropriate signage for road closures or detours would be installed.\n\nVictoria Road/City West Link/Anzac Bridge approach intersection – reconstructing the intersection to accommodate existing connectivity, the new M4 East Motorway/Iron Cove Link to Anzac Bridge connections and construction of a new bridge at Victoria Road\n\nCity West Link/The Crescent intersection – realigning The Crescent to the west, building a new bridge over Whites Creek and modifying the intersection\n\nVictoria Road at Iron Cove – realigning the westbound (southern) carriageway of Victoria Road to create sufficient space to build new tunnel portals and entry and exit ramps for the Iron Cove Link.\n\nThese works would be undertaken on parts of the arterial road network that are heavily trafficked and which provide important network connectivity. To construct these works would require the implementation of multiple traffic stages that meet the requirements of the construction contractor, Roads and Maritime, Transport Management Centre (TMC) and other key stakeholders. The traffic staging would likely require the creation of temporary carriageways, intersections and bridges offline from the existing road infrastructure to enable the construction of the new works and the switching of traffic.\n\nTemporary closures and diversions, outside of peak hours would be required and would be undertaken following consultation with the TMC. Staging arrangements would be confirmed by the construction contractor during detailed design.\n\nIn preparing the traffic staging plans during construction the key considerations would include:\n\nMaintaining a safe environment for the public and the construction workforce\n\nMaintaining traffic and lane capacity, including bus or transit lane capacity, on the arterial road network particularly during peak periods\n\nMinimising delays to motorists utilising the affected parts of the arterial road network\n\nUndertaking the works efficiently to minimise the duration of traffic impacts\n\nMaintaining the safety of motorists, members of the public and construction personnel\n\nMinimising impacts on public transport services and providing alternative arrangements where necessary\n\nMinimising impacts on key active transport links and providing alternative arrangements where necessary.\n\nTraffic crashes\n\nConstruction traffic volumes are expected to be low when compared to existing traffic volumes on key arterial roads connecting to the construction ancillary facility locations. The greatest increase is forecast to occur on City West Link west of the City West Link/James Street intersection where, as a worst-case scenario, construction would generate around 110 vehicles during the AM peak hour and around 220 vehicles in the PM peak hour. Compared to existing traffic volumes, total construction traffic would be the equivalent of around three per cent of peak hour traffic on City West Link at this location during the AM peak hour and five per cent of existing peak hour volumes in the PM peak hour.\n\nThe volume of traffic generated by construction is expected to be low compared to existing traffic. The effects of this short-term increase on the existing road network is not expected to substantially impact road safety in and around the study area, although there is still a risk with construction traffic interacting with general traffic, with elevated risk when construction-related vehicles are entering and leaving construction sites.\n\nForeseen impacts on road safety for all users during construction would be mitigated as much as possible through the provision of a CTAMP and would include the development of construction staging and temporary works that minimises conflicts with the existing road network and maximises spatial separation between work areas and travel lanes. Further management measures that would be incorporated in the CTAMP are detailed in section 8.5.3.\n\nPublic transport services\n\nAn increase in vehicles on the road network during the construction period is forecast to result in some increased delays at certain intersections. Heavy vehicle volumes would increase along major roads. The following impacts on public transport services in these areas would potentially be experienced:\n\nBuses:\n\nSimilar to general traffic, there would be an increase in bus travel times due to slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays. This would be partially mitigated by the presence of bus lanes along Victoria Road and Parramatta Road to be installed as part of the M4 East project (refer to condition of approval B34 for the M4 East project for details on the provision of bus lanes along Parramatta Road)\n\nLonger travel times to and from bus stops by supplementary travel modes (eg car passenger, walking to/from bus stops) due to an increase in traffic volumes, slower travel speeds and increased intersection delays\n\nReduced amenity for bus users waiting at stops.\n\nThe traffic assessment has identified bus stops that would require relocation during construction for safety reasons, comprising\n\nThe bus stops on The Crescent (northbound and southbound) at Annandale near the intersection with City West Link would be moved south towards Johnston Street to allow for construction along The Crescent. The northbound bus stop would be permanently moved south to accommodate the new alignment. The southbound bus stop would be reinstated in generally the same location. Alternative access from The Crescent to the Rozelle Bay light rail stop would also be provided during construction\n\nThree bus stops on Victoria Road (two on the northbound side and one on the southbound side) near the intersection with The Crescent would be relocated north to accommodate the reconstruction of Victoria Road. These bus stops would be reinstated in generally the same location at the completion of construction\n\nTwo bus stops on Victoria Road near Iron Cove Bridge would be temporarily relocated (further east of the bridge) to allow for the widening works along Victoria Road. These bus stops would be reinstated in generally the same location at the completion of construction.\n\nThe modifications to bus stops would be reviewed during detailed design with the objective of minimising disruptions to public transport services. Bus stop relocations would be agreed with Transport for NSW and all affected bus operators.\n\nRail services\n\nBus service connections to railway stations may be affected due to a reduction in the reliability of bus services during the construction period. The project would have no direct impact on heavy rail services.\n\nLight rail\n\nBus service connections to light rail stops may be affected due to a reduction in the reliability of bus services during the construction period. Pedestrian access to the Leichhardt North light rail stop adjacent to the Darley Road civil and tunnel site (C4) and the Rozelle Bay light rail stop next to The Crescent, would be maintained during construction. The project would not directly impact on operation of light rail services.\n\nWalking and cycling\n\nThe construction impacts on pedestrians and cyclists have been assessed using the criteria outlined in Table 8-50. An increase in the number of vehicles during the construction period would potentially impact walking and cycling amenity. Pedestrian footways and cycle paths would also need to be diverted during construction.\n\nTable 8-50 Active transport – impact severity criteria\n\nConstruction activities would be carried out in stages resulting in changing impacts over the course of the construction program. Further information on the staged construction of the project is provided in Chapter 6 (Construction work). A key objective of the construction program would be to minimise disruption to pedestrians and cyclists and enable the use of the active transport links that would be provided as part of the project as soon as possible. Details about the active transport infrastructure that would be provided by the project are included in Appendix N (Technical working paper: Active transport strategy).\n\nPyrmont Bridge Road civil and tunnel site (C9)\n\nConstruction at this site is planned for 2018–2022. The Pyrmont Bridge tunnel site is generally bound by Parramatta Road to the south, Pyrmont Bridge Road to the north and Mallett Street to the east. No significant changes to the surrounding road network are proposed with heavy vehicle ingress via Parramatta Road and egress via Pyrmont Bridge Road, and all light vehicle ingress and egress via Pyrmont Bridge Road.\n\nThe Inner City Regional Route for cyclists runs along Pyrmont Bridge Road at this location (identified as a ‘bicycle friendly road’) with connections via Parramatta Road (west) and Booth Street (northern continuation of Mallett Street). There are pedestrian footpaths on both sides of Parramatta Road and Pyrmont Bridge Road.\n\nMinor impact is anticipated for pedestrians and cyclists at this location. Although there would be no requirement for diversions, there is the potential for interactions with construction vehicles, particularly where heavy vehicles enter the site from Parramatta Road and leave the site on to Pyrmont Bridge Road. Traffic management measures would be implemented at the entry and exit driveways on Parramatta Road and Pyrmont Bridge Road to manage potential interactions between construction traffic and pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nConstruction impact assessment – Option B\n\nThe intersection performance results for the road network under the 2021 ‘without construction’ and ‘with construction’ forecast volumes for the Option B scenario at Haberfield are summarised in Table 8-52 and Table 8-53 for the AM peak and PM peak respectively."
