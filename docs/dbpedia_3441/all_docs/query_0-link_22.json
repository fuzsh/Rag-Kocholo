        "text": "This article reports on a quantitative risk assessment, supported by Computational Fluid Dynamics calculations, to compare the fire risk levels of two design options for the Yas Island Southern Crossing Tunnel in Abu Dhabi: a 5-cell tunnel with two escape galleries, compared to a 3-cell solution with no escape galleries, but with a fire suppression system installed in the highway cells. The risk levels for the two designs were shown to be broadly similar, and the 3-cell design was accepted as meeting the required level of fire safety by Abu Dhabi Civil Defence. The 3-cell tunnel benefited from a reduced construction cost compared to the conventional 5-cell design, as well as reduced risks to meeting the target date for construction completion.\n\nABSTRACT The past decade has seen a swing towards the acceptance of fixed fire fighting systems (FFFS) in tunnels. Numerous water based FFFS have been installed in tunnels in recent years. In Europe, at least, the emphasis has been on water mist systems (WMS) for tunnel applications, with systems being installed in the tunnel sections of the A86 near Paris and the M30 Madrid ring road, amongst others.\n\nTwo important tunnel safety technologies are addressed. The majority of long road tunnels have ventilation systems. In the event of a fire in a tunnel, such systems will influence fire development in a number of different ways. Recent research and observations on these influences are presented. The effects discussed are critical ventilation velocity for smoke control and the influence of ventilation on fire size, fire spread and fire growth. There is no well defined ‘best’ approach to operate tunnel ventilation in a fire emergency. Another technology of growing importance is sprinklers and water mist systems, which are being installed in an increasing number of tunnels. There are some concerns regarding the integration of ventilation and suppression systems, these are discussed. Of particular concern is the interaction between water mist droplets and ventilation flow which may result in the suppression agent being carried long distances downstream, away from the fire. Ventilation an...\n\nMost highway facility components in the United States are governed by design, construction, maintenance, inspection, and operations codes and regulations of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). However, to date, highway tunnels in the U.S. do not have comparable national codes and regulations. Recent events, such as the July 2006 ceiling collapse of the I-90 Central Artery/Tunnel (CA/T) in Boston, Massachusetts, have called attention to the need for such national standards. After investigating the CA/T ceiling collapse, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommended that the FHWA seek legislation to establish a mandatory tunnel inspection program that would identify critical inspection elements and specify an appropriate inspection frequency. The FHWA requested clearance from the Office of the Secretary of Transportation to proceed with regulatory action to develop National Tu...\n\nTunnels evoke unique emotions and perceptions that may affect human behaviour in the event of an emergency. Limited empirical data on human factors affecting response during tunnel emergencies have constrained our ability to plan for these aspects of incident management. The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is Australia&#39;s only immersed (subsea) road tunnel. It was the site of a recent observational study conducted to further develop tunnel evacuation procedures and systems. The event involved the evacuation of 32 volunteers from a controlled &#39;burning car&#39; scenario. Response data was obtained from film footage and a post-exercise questionnaire. Pre-recorded audio messages were found to be the predominant source of information used in forming the decision to evacuate, augmented by social information exchange or social &#39;checking&#39; processes. Participants demonstrated much indecision and did not commence evacuation until audio instructions were issued. Three quarters of particip..."
