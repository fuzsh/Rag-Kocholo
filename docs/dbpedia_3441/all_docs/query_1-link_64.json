        "text": "Transport for NSW has confirmed the shortlist for the tenderers for stage two of Western Harbour Tunnel project which will see a second tunnel crossing across Sydney Harbour.\n\nThe successful parties of Acciona Construction Australia, Bouygues Construction Australia and Vinci Construction Grands Projects joint venture, and John Holland, CPB Contractors and UGL Engineering joint venture will now begin the formal tender process.\n\nThis follows the selection of a joint venture between CPB Contractors and John Holland earlier this week to deliver the Western Harbour Tunnel – Southern Tunnelling Works, the first stage of tunnelling for the Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe second package of works will deliver the remainder of the Western Harbour Tunnel, including the balance of northern tunnelling from Birchgrove, through Sydney Harbour and onto North Sydney, the marine work and all the tunnel fit-out.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel will be a second road tunnel under Sydney Harbour. The tunnel will connect the WestConnex Rozelle Interchange with the Warringah Freeway in North Sydney. Once complete and via the Beaches Link, there will be a continuous connection from WestConnex at Rozelle to Sydney’s Northern Beaches.\n\nThe NSW 2021-22 Budget allocated $6.3 billion over the next four years for the Western Harbour Tunnel, Beaches Link and Warringah Freeway Upgrade, including $454 million in FY2021-22.\n\nA spokesperson for Transport for NSW said progress on the Western Harbour Tunnel is well underway.\n\n“Once completed, Western Harbour Tunnel will change the way people move around Sydney and provide more options for motorists, whilst also reducing traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, Anzac Bridge as well as the Western Distributor,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe successful tenderer will be announced later this year.\n\nConstruction for Western Harbour Tunnel is expected to be completed in 2027.\n\nFor more information on the project, click here.\n\nRelated stories:"
