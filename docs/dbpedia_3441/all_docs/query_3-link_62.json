        "text": "Ventia has gone live with its implementation of Asset Vision for their Sydney Harbour Tunnel contract in NSW.\n\nAs part of the Sydney Orbital Network, the tunnel lets motorists cross from one side of Sydney Harbour to the other, linking the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney with the Cahill Expressway at the entrance to the Domain Tunnel in Sydneyâ€™s CBD.\n\nThrough a 15-year contract with the NSW Government, Ventia manages, owns and operates the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and its 2.3km of roadways. This includes a 960-metre immersed tube across the harbour, twin 900-metre land tunnels on the north shore and twin 400-metre land tunnels on the south shore."
