The billion dollar project has been split into two stages.\n\nStage 1\n\nStage 1 included adding 30kms of extra traffic lanes as well as widening the freeway from four to five lanes between the EastLink interchange and the South Gippsland Freeway. The street of freeway between South Gippsland and Clyde Road in Berwick was also widened for two lanes to three in each direction. Construction on stage one began in September 2016 and was completed in June 2018. The $400 million project was completed by contractors Fulton Hogan 11 weeks ahead of schedule in 2018.\n\nStage 2\n\nCPB Contractors commenced construction of stage two in early 2020 and is expected to be completed by 2022. Stage two includes adding 36kms of new lanes on the Monash and Princes Freeways between:\n\nWarrigal Road and EastLink outbound\n\nEastLink to Springvale Road inbound\n\nClyde Road to Cardinia Road in both directions\n\nThis stage of the project also includes connected Police Road to the freeway, connecting Jacksons Road directly to EastLink, extending the land-use management system from the South Gippsland Freeway to the Beaconsfield interchange. The $711 million project will also include upgrading O'shea Road to three lanes as well as extending the road to join the Beaconsfield interchange and building a shared walking and cycling path.\n\nOnce completed over the Monash Freeway will see a drastic decrease in travel times on one of the countries busiest freeways. With over 180,000 vehicles using it daily, the upgrade works will reduce congestion, help lower crash rates and connect to local communities more.\n\nMonash Rail Upgrade: $475 Million\n\nThe Federal Government has committed to funding a rail project connecting Monash Universities' Caulfield and Clayton campuses. The $475 million project will significantly enhance travel options for the tens of thousands of staff and students who travel to Monash each day.\n\nThe project is aiming to support one of Victoria's largest employment hubs, the Monash Precinct is the largest employment hub outside of Melbourne's CBD.\n\nMonash President and Vice Chancellor, Professor Margaret Gardner, has spoken about the importance of this rail line.\n\n\"Our Clayton campus can attract more than 53,000 people daily, the equivalent population of a major regional city. Fast efficient public transport links will reduce road congestion and deliver benefits to the wider innovation precinct,\" Professor Gardner stated.\n\n\"Reducing car use is core to Monash University's sustainability effort. We know that many who drive to campus would use public transport if more convenient options were available.\n\nFrankston to Baxter Line: $225 Million\n\nThe Frankston to Baxter Rail Line will receive $225 million in funding from the Federal Government for the duplication and electrification of the line. Currently, commuters have to board a diesel train at Frankston to get to Baxter, along with this there is only one rail line.\n\nA business case for the upgrade is currently being developed and works will begin as soon as it is completed. The business case will also plan and cost an extension of the line to a new Frankston Hospital station.\n\nIt is expected that this project will create almost 4,000 jobs which will be a significant boost to the local economy, a topic Frankston Mayor Colin Hampton spoke about.\n\n\"This $225 million is extremely welcome and will get the Frankston line on track to future-proof our region,\" he said.\n\nBruce Highway Upgrade Program: $8.5 Billion\n\nAccording to Queensland's Department of Transport and Main Roads, the Bruce Highway Upgrade Program is the largest road infrastructure program that Queensland has ever seen.
