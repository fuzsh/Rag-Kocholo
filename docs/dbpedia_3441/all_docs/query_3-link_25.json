        "text": "Motorists on Australia’s busiest freeway face years of disruption and closures as part of the multibillion-dollar construction of another road tunnel under Sydney Harbour.\n\nParts of the Warringah Freeway, used by as many as 250,000 vehicles a day, will be temporarily shut overnight during construction of the Western Harbour Tunnel and subsequent upgrades to the adjoining motorway.\n\nSubstantial construction for the harbour crossing could begin in late 2021 and finish by 2026, according to an environmental report, which was released to the public on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe project includes twin 6.5 kilometre tunnels from an underground junction for the WestConnex toll road at Rozelle to the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney. The seven-kilometre Beaches Link will then extend from the Warringah Freeway to Balgowlah and Seaforth in the city's north.\n\nVentilation stacks will be built at Rozelle, where the construction to the controversial interchange is under way, and Cammeray on the other side of the harbour.\n\nThe Rozelle ventilation stack is one of three already slated for the area, while the 30-metre high Cammeray stack is planned near Ernest Street, according to new mapping of the project.\n\nCammeray will be most affected, with parts of the golf course and 15 private homes to be acquired by the state government to widen the Warringah Freeway.\n\nAbout 20 properties will be acquired as part of the Warringah upgrade in total, while four will be acquired during the tunnel construction.\n\nConstruction, which will most likely cost more than $14 billion (including the Beaches Link) is expected to affect public transport and temporarily increase travel times through northern Sydney.\n\nHarbour Tunnel and Beaches Link Program director Doug Parris said disruption was \"inevitable\", given the upgrades to Australia’s busiest freeway, but said years of construction would result in more efficient transport and a more resilient road network.\n\nPartial or complete closures of the Warringah Freeway were outlined in the report, which indicated most would occur after 10pm, or during off-peak times.\n\n“It’s not a road that you can casually close some lanes and hope it will keep working, we’re not going to do that ... so we’re talking about overnight works effectively and ensuring the road is back up and open the next morning,\" Mr Parris said.\n\nLoading\n\nBirchgrove Wharf is also slated to be closed for about two years, according to the EIS.\n\nThe tunnel itself will be built in a trench on the harbour floor, where large concrete tubes will be lowered from barges above.\n\nThe government decided against an underground tunnel due to the poor geology at the harbour crossing, as well as the steep gradient near North Sydney.\n\nMaterial dredged from the harbour will either be taken offshore to a deep water disposal ground or, if it is more hazardous, will be treated locally before it's disposed in landfill.\n\n“We do expect for there to be contaminants in there, this is a harbour that has an industrial heritage,\" Mr Parris said.\n\nYurulbin Park, Anzac Park and St Leonards Park will all be used for temporary construction sites.\n\nWhile some of the Cammeray golf course will be acquired, the government said it would be \"reconfigured\" to remain operational.\n\nBalmain Greens MP, Jamie Parker, said the EIS had \"confirmed the worst fears\" for his community.\n\n“The choice to dig a trench to place prefabricated tunnel tubes will mean 10 hectares of deep water soft sediment will be dredged, destroying marine life and polluting our harbour,\" he said in a statement."
