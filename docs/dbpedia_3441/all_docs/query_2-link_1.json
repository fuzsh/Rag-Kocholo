        "text": "The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is a critical and iconic asset for the people of NSW. As part of the Sydney Orbital Network, the tunnel lets motorists cross from one side of Sydney Harbour to the other, by linking the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney with the Cahill Expressway at the entrance to the Domain Tunnel in Sydney's CBD.\n\nA dual carriageway with two lanes for each direction, the tunnel is just under 2.3 kilometres from the northern portals to the southern portals (entrances/exits). The Sydney Harbour Tunnel is made up of three sections: twin 900-metre land tunnels on the north shore, twin 400-metre land tunnels on the south shore and a 960-metre immersed tube across the harbour. The tube consists of eight concrete units.\n\nConstruction of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel started in February 1988 and it opened to traffic in August 1992.\n\nThe Sydney Harbour Tunnel is located on the traditional land and waterways of the Gadigal and Cammeraygal peoples of the Eora Nation.\n\nManager\n\nThrough a 15-year contract with the New South Wales Government that commenced in 2022, Ventia manages, operates and maintains the Sydney Harbour Tunnel, and operates the Domain Tunnel, for Transport for NSW. Ventia has provided asset management services for multiple motorway tunnels across Australia.
