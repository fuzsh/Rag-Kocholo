        "text": "Air Pollution\n\nAlienation of Parkland\n\nMarine Impact\n\nAir Pollution\n\nAir in the Tunnel will be exhausted from the top of the northern pylon of the Harbour Bridge, necessitating some internal changes - but not external changes - to the pylon. Fresh air will be supplied to the Tunnel from an air intake structure located in Bradfield Park.\n\nThere is a potential for adverse air quality impact at the southern portal in the Domain. This situation could be avoided by limiting the number of vehicles entering the Tunnel through electronic monitoring and electronic traffic signals and signs. The need is expected to arise only occasionally in the year 2000 and for a short duration each time.\n\nThe Department of Environment and Planning argued that the regional air quality would be worse with the Tunnel than without it but that the Tunnel could not be rejected on air quality considerations alone.\n\n...back to top\n\nAlienation of Parkland\n\nThe air intake structure in Bradfield Park will alienate a small proportion of parkland and cause changes in how the park is used and significant local visual impact due to both the visibility of the site and the transformation of an estimated three percent of the park. Planting will reduce visual impact of the structure.\n\nIn the area of the Domain adjacent to the existing Domain Tunnel there will be some regrading works, loss of approximately six trees, one of which is of particular significance (Melaleuca), and the construction of retaining walls. These changes will result in significant local visual impacts and a possible change in recreational use of the area. The affected trees will be transplanted where possible.\n\n...back to top\n\nMarine Impact\n\nThe impact on the marine ecology comes mainly from dredging and blasting on the Harbour bottom. The EIS argued that whilst some marine organisms would be lost they were plentiful in the area and their loss would not be significant. The disturbance from construction would also disturb some sediments containing toxic waste and heavy metal levels were expected to rise.\n\nA committee of review found that the EIS did not adequately study the impact of the construction of the Tunnel on the marine environment."
