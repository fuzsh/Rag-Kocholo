        "text": "The NSW Government’s vision for Sydney is one of an integrated road and public transport network that gives you the freedom to choose how and when you get around, no matter where you live and work.\n\nOne area of focus in Sydney is to complete the missing links in the motorway network to support the growth of our communities, places and economy, and enable people and goods to move safely and reliably around our city and beyond.\n\nWe know Sydney traffic can be frustrating, especially in peak hour. The Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade will change the way you travel across Sydney Harbour. This project will get you to places faster by improving capacity and providing new direct routes and reliability on both sides of the harbour.\n\nThis much needed new crossing of Sydney Harbour will be a game changer for our city. You will save time on your journeys and enjoy more direct bus routes between the Inner West, Sydney and North Sydney, with seamless connections to the future Sydney Metro and Sydney Trains.\n\nBy improving capacity, supporting public transport and providing new direct routes and reliability, this project will improve journey times for freight, public transport and motorists, and alleviate pressure on some of our city’s most critical transport corridors.\n\nWe have carried out a detailed traffic and transport assessment to help us make predictions about future traffic conditions. The traffic modelling considers future population growth, land use, and other major road network and public transport projects to anticipate the impact of the project on the transport network.\n\nOur assessments looked at road traffic, local roads and parking, public transport, pedestrians and cyclists, and maritime traffic. In addition to the benefits the project will deliver, we also investigated and assessed the potential impact to the local and wider road network and to vessels on the harbour; both while we are building and when we are open to traffic.\n\nShaping the future of our city is no small task and you may notice some changes to traffic and transport while we are working. We know our work can be disruptive and delays can be frustrating for you and we are committed to reducing our impact wherever we can.\n\nWhere possible, our construction sites have been located on motorways or arterial roads, to minimise the use of local streets for trucks moving materials to and from the sites.\n\nWe are not expecting substantial changes to your travel times while we are working.\n\nSome areas may temporarily experience minor short term delays due to:\n\nan increase of construction vehicles sharing the road\n\ntemporary changes to local roads and temporary bus lane closures\n\ntemporary changes to speed limits\n\ntemporary changes to on street parking.\n\nOur assessment shows we will have a limited impact on the public transport network around our projects, except at Birchgrove, where there will be some temporary impacts to the wharf during construction.\n\nPlease explore the map for more information about local traffic impacts.\n\nWe will continue to engage with you when we are building. This will include communication before the start of work to keep you informed of what we are doing in your area and on our roads, and any likely impacts.\n\nWhen planning our work we have made reducing the impact of our project, and ensuring safety, to you and our workers our priority.\n\nWe will be using roadheader technology similar to WestConnex and NorthConnex tunnel projects currently under construction. Our crossing of Sydney Harbour will use an immersed tube tunnel, which was the same process used for the existing Sydney Harbour Tunnel built between 1988 and 1992. This method is commonly used around the world and is a well understood and safe way to build a tunnel.\n\nOur EIS describes the proposed approach to construction of our project and our timeline, footprint, methodology, working hours, materials, equipment, traffic management, site access routes, and temporary construction sites.\n\nYou may see some minor change, once our selected construction contractor carries out detailed planning and design. Any changes will be assessed for consistency with the assessment made in the EIS and if not consistent, a planning modification will be submitted to Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) for their consideration and approval.\n\nIf you are interested in additional technical information, we encourage you to read the EIS.\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you. Our commitment is that the tunnels will be built and operated to meet strict air quality standards using modern ventilation and tunnel design. All ventilation systems will be built and operated to strictly comply with any conditions specified in DPIE’s planning approval, and the Environment Protection Licence (EPL) to be issued by the EPA.\n\nYou may be interested to know the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer has released a report in relation to road tunnel air quality. The report found emissions from well-designed road tunnels cause a negligible change to surrounding air quality, and as such, there is little to no health benefit for surrounding communities in installing filtration and air treatment systems in such tunnels. You can learn more about how we monitor air quality by visiting the Chief Scientist website.\n\nWe have carried out a detailed assessment of air quality in consultation with independent specialist agencies including the EPA, Office of the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, Ministry of Health and the Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality (ACTAQ) to ensure our project will meet regulatory requirements and manage the potential impacts on air quality. Our air quality assessment was subject to an independent review by international technical experts, coordinated by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer. It is now published on DPIE’s website.\n\nWe know how important it is to protect air quality during construction for your health, and the health of everyone working on site. Dust matters, so we are putting a series of measures in place to suppress it and monitor your air quality every day.\n\nLike any building work, dust is unavoidable. We will have an experienced construction team who will work to minimise dust. They will use dust suppression methods, including stabilising loose material and watering the site and trucks.\n\nMost of the material we excavate will be clean, crushed sandstone. This will be removed in covered trucks to minimise dust falling from trucks.\n\nWe will manage potential odours from our excavation work by having experienced construction contractors treat any of those materials and then remove them from site in sealed trucks.\n\nConstruction activity at each site is carried out under an EPL, issued by the EPA, which will include limits relating to air quality and dust.\n\nWhen we are building, we will be monitoring dust around the sites to ensure our methods are allowing us to meet the terms of our EPL and inform us if we need to make changes.\n\nAir quality in Sydney has improved over the last few decades due to initiatives which have reduced emissions from industry, motor vehicles, businesses and residences. Motor vehicle emissions are predicted to decrease significantly as a result of improvements in emission control and vehicle engine technology. Overall, traffic emissions in Sydney are predicted to be reduced by up to 50 per cent by 2027 and up to 65 per cent by 2037, when compared to 2016.\n\nYou will experience an improvement in air quality along the Western Distributor, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Warringah Freeway as the result of more vehicles using the Western Harbour Tunnel, reducing traffic on these roads.\n\nOur studies have shown there will be a small impact on the local air quality along some of the surface roads we are building and upgrading, as well as some existing roads due to increased local traffic.\n\nOur ventilation facilities use elevated outlets to eject tunnel emissions high into the atmosphere where they mix with the surrounding air, dispersing hundreds of times, quickly becoming indistinguishable from background levels.\n\nOur studies have also shown emissions the ventilation outlets for the project will only have a minimal impact on the surrounding air quality. This impact is negligible and will be generally undetectable. The ventilation outlets will be continuously monitored.\n\nThe EPA regulates the ventilation outlets for all current and future operating motorway tunnels to ensure they meet air quality limits.\n\nOur ventilation system is also designed to ensure there are zero emissions from the tunnel exits.\n\nThe map shows the predicted changes in air quality in 2027 and 2037 with the project.\n\nFor more information on local impacts please read chapter 12 and 13 of the EIS.\n\nWe have assessed the possible noise and vibration impact when we are building and when we are open to traffic. Once open to traffic some areas will benefit from less noise due to reduced traffic on the surface and the new noise walls and property treatments we will install.\n\nWe know our work can be noisy which is why we will use a range of measures to reduce the impact of our work when we are close to communities.\n\nWe have carried out a thorough noise and vibration assessment examining the potential impact to you when we build and operate the tunnels.\n\nThe assessments involved identifying areas which may experience changed levels of noise or vibration as a result of our work, assessing the types and significance of the impact and how we will manage them.\n\nNoise\n\nIf you live near where we are working you are likely to hear us. This may be when we are working on the road, delivering materials, tunnelling and removing spoil from tunnelling sites.\n\nHow noise is perceived is personal and can depend on the environment. Because of this, sound may also seem louder to you in some situations than others.\n\nFor more information on local noise impacts, please explore your suburb on the map.\n\nVibration\n\nWe are sensitive to vibration and can feel vibration at very low levels. This is why the vibration criteria we need to meet during our work to avoid annoyance to you is more stringent than the criteria to prevent damage to your property.\n\nOur assessment considers the type of work we will be doing and whether there are any properties which may be at risk. Unlike noise, it is difficult to ‘predict’ vibration. There are many variables like soil type and conditions, the type of rock below the surface, building types and foundations, and the plant and equipment being used on site. Because of this, we take a conservative approach in estimating our impact.\n\nWe understand there has been a lot of concern about the potential for vibration and settlement when we are tunnelling to cause damage to homes. Our objective is to ensure there are no buildings at risk of damage from vibration while we are building our tunnels.\n\nWe will offer you a property condition survey if you are located within 50 metres of our work. This will provide a clear record of your property’s condition before our work starts.\n\nWe will establish an Independent Property Impact Assessment Panel (IPIAP) to verify building condition survey reports, resolve any property damage disputes and establish ongoing settlement monitoring requirements. Panel members will be highly qualified in the fields of structural, geotechnical and/or civil engineering and be independent of the government and project.\n\nIf any damage is found to be directly related to our project, the damage will be fixed at no cost to you.\n\nThe project is predicted to reduce traffic noise for almost 60 per cent of properties near our surface roads.\n\nWe acknowledge there will be some parts of the community who live near our permanent facilities and surface road upgrades who may notice some more noise as a result of an increase in traffic going in and out of the tunnels.\n\nWe have identified and assessed properties which may be affected by noise from the project when it is opened to traffic.\n\nWe always try to mitigate traffic noise at the source first, including installing low noise pavement. If this does not reduce the noise enough then we then look at other options for you. This includes measures like building noise walls or providing your property with noise treatments.\n\nIf your property is potentially eligible for noise treatment we will be in contact with you soon. We want to start our noise treatment program as early as possible so you will benefit from reduced noise before we start construction.\n\nYou do not need to contact us as we will be in touch with you directly, if you are eligible.\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you. Our commitment is that the tunnels will be built and operated to meet strict air quality standards using modern ventilation and tunnel design.

The Western Harbour Tunnel motorway control centre will have no operational impacts to air quality.\n\nThe Beaches Link ventilation outlet will be located in the Artarmon industrial area, on the corner of Punch Street and Lambs Road. We are preparing a separate environmental impact statement for the Beaches Link project which will include an assessment of the air quality impacts and improvements. Please click here for more information on the Beaches Link project.\n\nThe map shows the predicted changes in air quality in 2027 and 2037 with the project.\n\nWe have assessed the possible noise and vibration impact when we are building and when we are open to traffic.

During operation, we do not expect the motorway control centre will contribute to ongoing noise levels.\n\nWe have identified and assessed properties which may be affected by noise from the project when it is opened to traffic.\n\nWe always try to mitigate traffic noise at the source first, including installing low noise pavement. If this does not reduce the noise enough then we then look at other options for you.

We want to start our noise treatment program as early as possible so you will benefit from reduced noise before we start construction.\n\nYou do not need to contact us as we will be in touch with you directly, if you are eligible.\n\nThere may be changes in road traffic noise in Artarmon as a result of the Beaches Link project. We are preparing a separate EIS for the Beaches Link project which will include an assessment of the noise and vibration impacts and improvements. Please click here for more information on the Beaches Link project.\n\nWe understand the character and visual amenity of your local area is important to you. We carried out an urban design, visual and landscape character assessment, which considered the potential for impact to the overall landscape, and visual amenity as a result of our project.\n\nOur project has been designed to make the most of existing transport corridors and built-up urban areas and is largely built underground to minimise impacts on the surface. This is so our project can blend into the surrounding environment and reduce the character and visual impact in local areas where possible.\n\nWe will be further developing the urban design as part of the detailed design with the construction contractor. We will seek your important input to ensure our project integrates with the unique character of your surrounding land and creates spaces which match the aspirations of local communities.\n\nWe will be inviting you to take part in a range of opportunities to provide input and feedback on the urban design and landscaping as the project progresses.\n\nOnce open you will benefit from improved traffic conditions, improved travel times, less congestion, improved safety, as well as better pedestrian and cycle paths and open spaces. The continuous, free-flowing southbound bus lane on the Warringah Freeway will remove weaving between buses and other traffic.\n\nWe will be providing greater access for pedestrians and cyclists with:\n\nNew shared user bridge to the north of Ernest Street, connecting Anzac Park to Cammeray Park\n\nNew dedicated cycleway on the Eastern side of the Warringah Freeway between Ernest Street and Miller Street connecting Neutral Bay and Cammeray.\n\nBased on community feedback, the Ernest Street ramps to and from the Warringah Freeway will be maintained. Movements will change and allow access to and from the Sydney Harbour Tunnel only. Access to the Sydney Harbour Bridge will be available at Miller Street and Falcon Street.\n\nTransforming the way people travel on the network requires us to make significant changes to the existing road network. Please explore the map for information about traffic changes in your area.\n\nWe will carry out a review of the operational network about 12 months after the tunnel is open to see if any further adjustments are needed.\n\nWe know how important it is to protect air quality during construction for your health, and the health of everyone working on site. We are putting a series of measures in place to suppress it and monitor your air quality every day.\n\nLike any building work, dust is unavoidable. We will have an experienced construction team who will work to minimises dust to protect everyone. They will use leading dust suppression methods, including stabilising loose material and watering the site and trucks.\n\nMost of the material we excavate will be clean, crushed sandstone. This will be removed in covered trucks to minimise dust falling from trucks.\n\nWe will manage potential odours from our excavation work by having experienced construction contractors treat any of those materials and then remove them from site in sealed trucks.\n\nConstruction activity at each site is carried out under an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL), issued by the Environment Protection Authority, which will include limits relating to air quality, dust and water run-off.\n\nWhile we are building, we will monitor the air quality around our sites to help us ensure our methods are allowing us to meet the terms of our EPL and if we need to make changes.\n\nAir quality in Sydney has improved over the last few decades due to initiatives which have reduced emissions from industry, motor vehicles, businesses and residences. Motor vehicle emissions are predicted to decrease significantly by 2036 as a result of improvements in emission control and vehicle engine technology.

This impact is negligible and will be generally undetectable.\n\nThe map shows the predicted changes in air quality in 2027 and 2037 with the project.\n\nIn tunnel air quality\n\nWhile motor vehicle emissions are a source of air pollution, modern tunnel ventilation design ensures sufficient air flows within the tunnel to meet strict air quality requirements.\n\nWe have carried out comprehensive modelling on in-tunnel air quality based on:\n\nExpected traffic volumes\n\nMaximum traffic volumes\n\nBreakdown or major incident in the tunnels\n\nThe results of our modelling show the ventilation system installed in the tunnel will be able to manage the tunnel air to meet the air quality criteria in all of these situations. We will continue monitoring the tunnel air quality 24 hours per day during operation and use real-time data to ensure we are meeting strict air quality criteria.\n\nNoise\n\nIf you live near where we are working you are likely to hear us. This may be when we are working on the road, delivering materials, tunnelling and removing spoil from tunnelling sites. What you will hear will depend on the type of work we are doing and what time of the day or night we are carrying out the work. How noise is perceived is personal and can depend on the environment. Because of this, sound may also seem louder to you in some situations than others.\n\nThe map shows the predicted noise impacts at each construction site during construction.\n\nVibration\n\nWe are sensitive to vibrations and can feel vibration at very low levels. This is why the vibration criteria we need to meet during our work to avoid annoyance to you is many times more stringent than the criteria to prevent damage to your property. Our assessment considers the type of work we will be doing and whether there are any properties which may be at risk. Unlike noise, it is difficult to ‘predict’ vibration. There are many variables for example soil type and conditions, the type of rock below the surface, building types and foundations, and the plant and equipment being used on site.\n\nAs part of our assessment we looked at a large area surrounding our construction sites in Cammeray to determine which buildings may possibly be impacted by noise and vibration. This area was determined by recommended minimum working distances that should be maintained between plant and equipment and buildings while we are working. Site-specific vibration assessments have been carried out for Cammeray to determine how many receivers may be within the potential worst-case minimum working distances.\n\nWe will work closely with the owners and residents of the properties identified in the EIS to ensure we have as little impact as possible. We will offer you a property condition survey if you are located within 50 metres of our work. This will provide a clear record of the property’s condition before our work starts. If our work is found to have damaged any property we will ensure our contractor repairs the damage at no cost to the owner.\n\nMore information on the specific buildings identified in the assessment is available in Chapter 10: Construction noise and vibration.\n\nSome areas where you are will benefit from a reduction in noise as the result of reduced traffic on surface roads and new noise walls we will build as part of the project.\n\nWe acknowledge there will be some of you who will live near our permanent facilities and new surface road upgrades who may notice some more noise as a result from an increase in traffic leading to and out of the tunnels.\n\nWe have identified and assessed properties which may be affected by noise from the project when it is opened to traffic.\n\nWe always try to mitigate traffic noise at the source first, including installing low noise pavement. If this does not reduce the noise enough we then look at other options for you. This includes measures like building noise walls or providing your property with noise treatments.\n\nIf your property is potentially eligible for noise treatment we will be in contact with you soon. We want to start our noise treatment program as early as possible so you will benefit from reduced noise before we start construction.\n\nYou do not need to contact us as we will be in touch with you directly, if you are eligible.\n\nThe map shows the noise walls proposed in the Cammeray area.\n\nWe know our work can impact the local community in many ways and we will minimise these impacts where possible.\n\nWe will engage directly with key stakeholders, nearby businesses and residents who will be most affected and work together to develop the best outcome.\n\nChanges to the Cammeray Golf Course may impact on the use of the golf course for some members. Cammeray Golf Course is likely to have important social networks and be an important meeting place for members, particularly playing and life members, as well as volunteers, and these changes may impact on some social networks associated with the club.\n\nWe are consulting with the club directly to identify specific potential construction impacts to the business. We have already reduced the size of our impact to the golf course by relocating one of the permanent facilities to Artarmon. We will continue to work with the golf club on minimising our impact.\n\nStep 1: You can use your mouse wheel or the plus/minus arrows on the right-hand side of the page to zoom in and out.

This includes letting us know the location your comment relates to, details on what you like and what you think needs to be enhanced.\n\nWe know how important it is to protect air quality during construction for your health, and the health of everyone working on site. Dust matters, so we are putting a series of measures in place to suppress it and monitor your air quality every day.\n\nLike any building work, dust is unavoidable. We will have an experienced construction team who will work to minimise dust. They will use dust suppression methods, including stabilising loose material and watering the site and trucks.\n\nConstruction activity at each site is carried out under an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL), issued by the EPA, which will include limits relating to air quality and dust.\n\nWhile we are building, we will monitor the air quality around our sites to help us ensure our methods are allowing us to meet the terms of our EPL and inform us if we need to make changes.\n\nSurface air quality\n\nYou will experience an improvement in air quality along the Western Distributor, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Warringah Freeway as the result of vehicles using the Western Harbour Tunnel and reducing traffic on these roads.\n\nOur studies have shown there will be a small impact on the local air quality along some of the surface roads we are building and upgrading, as well as some existing roads due to increased local traffic.\n\nOur ventilation facilities use elevated outlets to eject tunnel emissions high into the atmosphere where they mix with the surrounding air, dispersing hundreds of times, quickly becoming indistinguishable from background levels.\n\nOur studies have also shown emissions from the ventilation outlets for the project will only have a minimal impact on the surrounding air quality. This impact is negligible and will be generally undetectable. The ventilation outlets will be continuously monitored.\n\nThe EPA regulates the ventilation outlets for all current and future operating motorway tunnels to ensure they meet air quality limits.\n\nOur ventilation system is also designed to ensure there are zero emissions from the tunnel exits.\n\nThe map shows the predicted changes in air quality in 2027 and 2037 with the project.\n\nIn-tunnel air quality\n\nWhile motor vehicle emissions are a source of air pollution, modern tunnel ventilation design ensures sufficient air flows within the tunnel to meet strict air quality requirements.\n\nWe have carried out modelling on in-tunnel air quality based on:\n\nexpected traffic volumes\n\nmaximum traffic volumes\n\nbreakdown or major incidents in the tunnels.\n\nThe results of our modelling show the ventilation system installed in the tunnel will be able to manage the tunnel air to meet the air quality criteria in all of these situations.\n\nWe have assessed the possible noise and vibration impact when we are building and when we are open to traffic. Once open to traffic some areas will benefit from less noise due to reduced traffic on the surface and the new noise walls and property treatments we will install.\n\nWe know our work can be noisy which is why we will use a range of measures to reduce the impact of our work when we are close to communities.\n\nWe have carried out a thorough noise and vibration assessment examining the potential impact to you when we build and operate the tunnels.\n\nThe assessments involved identifying areas which may experience changed levels of noise or vibration as a result of our work, assessing the types and significance of the impact and how we will manage them.\n\nNoise\n\nIf you live near where we are working you are likely to hear us. This may be when we are working on the road, delivering materials, tunnelling and removing spoil from tunnelling sites.\n\nHow noise is perceived is personal and can depend on the environment. Because of this, sound may also seem louder to you in some situations than others.\n\nFor more information on local noise impacts, please explore your suburb on the map.\n\nVibration\n\nWe are sensitive to vibrations and can feel vibration at very low levels. This is why the vibration criteria we need to meet during our work to avoid annoyance to you is many times more stringent than the criteria to prevent damage to your property.\n\nOur assessment considers the type of work we will be doing and whether there are any properties which may be at risk. Unlike noise, it is difficult to ‘predict’ vibration. There are many variables like soil type and conditions, the type of rock below the surface, building types and foundations, and the plant and equipment being used on site. Because of this, we take a conservative approach in estimating our impact.\n\nWe understand there has been a lot of concern about the potential for vibration and settlement when we are tunnelling to cause damage to homes. Our objective is to ensure there are no buildings at risk of damage from vibration while we are building our tunnels.\n\nWe will offer you a property condition survey if you are located within 50 metres of our work. This will provide a clear record of your property’s condition before our work starts.\n\nWe will establish an Independent Property Impact Assessment Panel (IPIAP) to verify building condition survey reports, resolve any property damage disputes and establish ongoing settlement monitoring requirements. Panel members will be highly qualified in the fields of structural, geotechnical and/or civil engineering and be independent of the government and project.\n\nIf any damage is found to be directly related to our project, the damage will be fixed at no cost to you.\n\nThe project is predicted to reduce traffic noise for almost 60 per cent of properties near our surface roads.\n\nWe acknowledge there will be some parts of the community who live near our permanent facilities and surface road upgrades who may notice some more noise as a result of an increase in traffic going in and out of the tunnels.\n\nWe have identified and assessed properties which may be affected by noise from the project when it is opened to traffic.\n\nWe always try to mitigate traffic noise at the source first, including installing low noise pavement. If this does not reduce the noise enough then we then look at other options for you. This includes measures like building noise walls or providing your property with noise treatments.\n\nIf your property is potentially eligible for noise treatment we will be in contact with you soon. We want to start our noise treatment program as early as possible so you will benefit from reduced noise before we start construction.\n\nYou do not need to contact us as we will be in touch with you directly, if you are eligible.\n\nWe understand the character and visual amenity of your local area is important to you. We carried out an urban design, visual and landscape character assessment, which considered the potential for impact to the overall landscape, and visual amenity as a result of our project.\n\nOur project has been designed to make the most of existing transport corridors and built-up urban areas and is largely built underground to minimise impacts on the surface. This is so our project can blend into the surrounding environment and reduce the character and visual impact in local areas where possible.\n\nWe will be further developing the urban design as part of the detailed design with the construction contractor. We will seek your important input to ensure our project integrates with the unique character of your surrounding land and creates spaces which match the aspirations of local communities.\n\nWe will be inviting you to take part in a range of opportunities to provide input and feedback on the urban design and landscaping as the project progresses.\n\nBy improving capacity, supporting public transport and providing new direct routes and reliability, this project will improve journey times for freight, public transport and motorists, and alleviate pressure on some of our city’s most critical transport corridors.\n\nWe have carried out a detailed traffic and transport assessment to help us make predictions about future traffic conditions. The traffic modelling considers future population growth, land use, and other major road network and public transport projects to anticipate the impact of the project on the transport network.\n\nOur assessments looked at road traffic, local roads and parking, public transport, pedestrians and cyclists, and maritime traffic. In addition to the benefits the project will deliver, we also investigated and assessed the potential impact to the local and wider road network and to vessels on the harbour; both while we are building and when we are open to traffic.\n\nTraffic and vehicle movements\n\nShaping the future of our city is no small task and you may notice some changes to traffic and transport while we are working. We know our work can be disruptive and delays can be frustrating for you and we are committed to reducing our impact wherever we can.\n\nWhere possible, our construction sites have been located on motorways or main roads, to minimise the use of local streets for trucks moving materials to and from the sites.\n\nWe are not expecting substantial changes to your travel times while we are working.\n\nSome areas may temporarily experience minor short term delays due to:\n\nan increase of construction vehicles sharing the road\n\ntemporary changes to local roads and temporary bus lane closures\n\ntemporary changes to speed limits\n\ntemporary changes to on street parking.\n\nMaritime vessel movements\n\nYou will notice some increase in harbour maritime traffic when we are building the immersed tube tunnels for the harbour crossing.\n\nWe will manage our work to minimise interruptions to port operations and the navigation of ships and ferries within Sydney Harbour.\n\nIf you spend time on the water you may notice us:\n\nmoving around on barges, tugboats and smaller sea vessels\n\ntemporarily restricting maritime speeds around construction areas and our sites\n\ntemporarily relocating swing moorings at Berrys Bay and using the mooring at Snails Bay for our immersed tube tunnel units\n\nestablishing and operating construction sites at Yurulbin Point and Berrys Bay\n\nestablishing two cofferdams, one off Yurulbin Point at Birchgrove and one off the Coal Loader at Waverton\n\nimplementing exclusion zones around the north and south cofferdams at Birchgrove and Waverton – reducing navigational width\n\nseabed profiling activities in preparation for the installation of immersed tube tunnel units\n\npartially closing Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton for a period of up to 48 hours at a time when we install the immersed tube tunnel units.\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you. Our commitment to you is that the tunnels will be built to meet strict air quality standards using modern ventilation and tunnel design. All ventilation systems will be built to strictly comply with any conditions specified in the DPIE’s planning approval, and the Environment Protection Licence to be issued by the EPA.\n\nYou may be interested to know the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer has released a report in relation to road tunnel air quality. The report found emissions from well-designed road tunnels cause a negligible change to surrounding air quality, and as such, there is little to no health benefit for surrounding communities in installing filtration and air treatment systems in such tunnels. You can learn more about how we monitor air quality by visiting the Chief Scientist website.\n\nWe have carried out a detailed assessment of air quality in consultation with independent specialist agencies including the EPA, Office of the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, Ministry of Health and the Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality (ACTAQ) to ensure our project will meet regulatory requirements and manage the potential impacts on air quality. Our air quality assessment was subject to an independent review by international technical experts, coordinated by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer. It is now published on DPIE’s website.\n\nWe know how important it is to protect air quality during construction for your health, and the health of everyone working on site. Dust matters, so we are putting a series of measures in place to suppress it and monitor your air quality every day.\n\nLike any building work, dust is unavoidable. We will have an experienced construction team who will work to minimise dust. They will use dust suppression methods, including stabilising loose material and watering the site and trucks.\n\nMost of the material we excavate will be clean, crushed sandstone. This will be removed in covered trucks to minimise dust falling from trucks.\n\nWe will manage potential odours from our excavation work by having experienced construction contractors treat any of those materials and then remove them from site in sealed trucks.\n\nConstruction activity at each site is carried out under an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL), issued by the EPA, which will include limits relating to air quality and dust.\n\nWhile we are building, we will monitor the air quality around our sites to help us ensure our methods are allowing us to meet the terms of our EPL and inform us if we need to make changes.\n\nAir quality in Sydney has improved over the last few decades due to initiatives which have reduced emissions from industry, motor vehicles, businesses and residences. Motor vehicle emissions are predicted to decrease significantly as a result of improvements in emission control and vehicle engine technology. Overall, traffic emissions in Sydney are predicted to be reduced by up to 50 per cent by 2027 and up to 65 per cent by 2037, when compared to 2016.\n\nYou will experience an improvement in air quality along the Western Distributor, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Warringah Freeway as the result of vehicles using the Western Harbour Tunnel, reducing traffic on these roads.\n\nOur studies have shown there will be a small impact on the local air quality along some of the surface roads we are building and upgrading, as well as some existing roads due to increased local traffic.\n\nOur ventilation facilities use elevated outlets to eject tunnel emissions high into the atmosphere where they mix with the surrounding air, dispersing hundreds of times, quickly becoming indistinguishable from background levels.\n\nOur studies have also shown emissions from the ventilation outlets for the project will only have a minimal impact on the surrounding air quality.

Once we are tunnelling, the majority of the work will take place underground and activity on the surface will reduce. Based on our planned tunnelling rate we expect the impact from tunnelling to be minimal for residents as we will only be working under each property for about one week.\n\nWhen tunnelling, our work will be as deep as 42 metres (12 storeys) at Yurulbin Park.\n\nThe majority of our work on the surface takes place inside the acoustic shed, which manages the potential impacts of noise, dust and light. These sheds are also closed at night to further reduce noise. There may be occasional deliveries and some light vehicle movements outside of standard construction hours.\n\nSpoil transport via barges will only take place during standard construction hours.\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you.

Once we are tunnelling, the majority of the work will take place underground and activity on the surface will reduce. Based on our planned tunnelling rate we expect the impact from tunnelling to be minimal for residents as we will only be working under each property for about one week.\n\nWhen tunnelling, our work will be as deep as 42 metres (12 storeys) at Yurulbin Park.\n\nThe majority of our work on the surface takes place inside the acoustic shed, which manages the potential impacts of noise, dust and light. These sheds are also closed at night to further reduce noise. There may be occasional deliveries and some light vehicle movements outside of standard construction hours.\n\nSpoil transport via barges will only take place during standard construction hours.\n\nConstruction timeline\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you. Our commitment to you is that the tunnels will be built to meet strict air quality standards using modern ventilation and tunnel design. All ventilation systems will be built to strictly comply with any conditions specified in the DPIE’s planning approval, and the Environment Protection Licence to be issued by the EPA.\n\nYou may be interested to know the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer has released a report in relation to road tunnel air quality. The report found emissions from well-designed road tunnels cause a negligible change to surrounding air quality, and as such, there is little to no health benefit for surrounding communities in installing filtration and air treatment systems in such tunnels. You can learn more about how we monitor air quality by visiting the Chief Scientist website.\n\nWe have carried out a detailed assessment of air quality in consultation with independent specialist agencies including the EPA, Office of the independent NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer, Ministry of Health and the Advisory Committee on Tunnel Air Quality (ACTAQ) to ensure our project will meet regulatory requirements and manage the potential impacts on air quality. Our air quality assessment was subject to an independent review by international technical experts, coordinated by the NSW Chief Scientist and Engineer. It is now published on DPIE’s website.\n\nWe know how important it is to protect air quality during construction for your health, and the health of everyone working on site. Dust matters, so we are putting a series of measures in place to suppress it and monitor your air quality every day.\n\nLike any building work, dust is unavoidable. We will have an experienced construction team who will work to minimise dust. They will use dust suppression methods, including stabilising loose material and watering the site and trucks.\n\nMost of the material we excavate will be clean, crushed sandstone. This will be removed in covered trucks to minimise dust falling from trucks.\n\nWe will manage potential odours from our excavation work by having experienced construction contractors treat any of those materials and then remove them from site in sealed trucks.\n\nConstruction activity at each site is carried out under an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL), issued by the EPA, which will include limits relating to air quality and dust.\n\nWhile we are building, we will monitor the air quality around our sites to help us ensure our methods are allowing us to meet the terms of our EPL and inform us if we need to make changes.\n\nAir quality in Sydney has improved over the last few decades due to initiatives which have reduced emissions from industry, motor vehicles, businesses and residences. Motor vehicle emissions are predicted to decrease significantly as a result of improvements in emission control and vehicle engine technology. Overall, traffic emissions in Sydney are predicted to be reduced by up to 50 per cent by 2027 and up to 65 per cent by 2037, when compared to 2016.\n\nYou will experience an improvement in air quality along the Western Distributor, Sydney Harbour Bridge and Warringah Freeway as the result of vehicles using the Western Harbour Tunnel, reducing traffic on these roads.\n\nOur studies have shown there will be a small impact on the local air quality along some of the surface roads we are building and upgrading, as well as some existing roads due to increased local traffic.\n\nOur ventilation facilities use elevated outlets to eject tunnel emissions high into the atmosphere where they mix with the surrounding air, dispersing hundreds of times, quickly becoming indistinguishable from background levels.\n\nOur studies have also shown emissions from the ventilation outlets for the project will only have a minimal impact on the surrounding air quality. This impact is negligible and will be generally undetectable. The ventilation outlets will be continuously monitored. The EPA regulates the ventilation outlets for all current and future operating motorway tunnels to ensure they meet air quality limits.\n\nOur ventilation system is also designed to ensure there are zero emissions from the tunnel exits.\n\nThe map shows the predicted changes in air quality in 2027 and 2037 with the project.\n\nWe have assessed the possible noise and vibration impact when we are building and when we are open to traffic. Once open to traffic some areas will benefit from less noise due to reduced traffic on the surface and the new noise walls and property treatments we will install.\n\nWe know our work can be noisy which is why we will use a range of measures to reduce the impact of our work when we are close to communities.\n\nWe have carried out a thorough noise and vibration assessment examining the potential impact to you when we build and operate the tunnels.\n\nThe assessments involved identifying areas which may experience changed levels of noise or vibration as a result of our work, assessing the types and significance of the impact and how we will manage them.\n\nNoise\n\nIf you live near where we are working you are likely to hear us. This may be when we are working on the road, delivering materials, tunnelling and removing spoil from tunnelling sites.\n\nHow noise is perceived is personal and can depend on the environment. Because of this, sound may also seem louder to you in some situations than others.\n\nFor more information on local noise impacts, please explore your suburb on the map.\n\nVibration\n\nWe are sensitive to vibration and can feel vibration at very low levels. This is why the vibration criteria we need to meet during our work to avoid annoyance to you is more stringent than the criteria to prevent damage to your property.\n\nOur assessment considers the type of work we will be doing and whether there are any properties which may be at risk. Unlike noise, it is difficult to ‘predict’ vibration. There are many variables like soil type and conditions, the type of rock below the surface, building types and foundations, and the plant and equipment being used on site. Because of this, we take a conservative approach in estimating our impact.\n\nWe understand there has been a lot of concern about the potential for vibration and settlement when we are tunnelling to cause damage to homes. Our objective is to ensure there are no buildings at risk of damage from vibration while we are building our tunnels.\n\nWe will offer you a property condition survey if you are located within 50 metres of our work. This will provide a clear record of your property’s condition before our work starts.\n\nWe will establish an Independent Property Impact Assessment Panel (IPIAP) to verify building condition survey reports, resolve any property damage disputes and establish ongoing settlement monitoring requirements. Panel members will be highly qualified in the fields of structural, geotechnical and/or civil engineering and be independent of the government and project.\n\nIf any damage is found to be directly related to our project, the damage will be fixed at no cost to you.\n\nWe understand the character and visual amenity of your local area is important to you. We carried out an urban design, visual and landscape character assessment, which considered the potential for impact to the overall landscape, and visual amenity as a result of our project.\n\nOur project has been designed to make the most of existing transport corridors and built-up urban areas and is largely built underground to minimise impacts on the surface. This is so our project can blend into the surrounding environment and reduce the character and visual impact in local areas where possible.\n\nDue to the large scale of our project, there will be some permanent impact to the local landscape and visual amenity.\n\nWe will be further developing the urban design as part of the detailed design with the construction contractor. We will seek your important input to ensure our project integrates with the unique character of your surrounding land and creates spaces which match the aspirations of local communities.\n\nWe will be inviting you to take part in a range of opportunities to provide input and feedback on the urban design and landscaping as the project progresses.\n\nSydney has a rich biodiversity with a multitude of native plants and animals that form thriving ecosystems both on land and in the water. We are committed to minimising the project’s impact, protecting the local plant and animal life and implementing monitoring programs.\n\nWe have carried out extensive surveys in the study area and a detailed Biodiversity Development Assessment Report to understand the biodiversity impact of the project.\n\nPlease click on the map to find out which species were identified in our assessments around Birchgrove.\n\nWe understand the importance of the natural environment to you and are committed to minimising our impact, protecting the local plant and animal life and implementing monitoring programs.\n\nBefore we start building a detailed Construction Environment Management Plan (CEMP) will be developed to detail how the project will preserve, protect and manage any potential impact to the local environment. The CEMP will need to be approved by DPIE before we can start any major construction work.\n\nWe will continue to have a dedicated team of environmental specialists who oversee this process.\n\nTraffic and vehicle movements\n\nShaping the future of our city is no small task and you may notice some changes to traffic and transport while we are working. We know our work can be disruptive and delays can be frustrating for you and we are committed to reducing our impact wherever we can.\n\nWhere possible, our construction sites have been located on motorways or main roads, to minimise the use of local streets for trucks moving materials to and from the sites.\n\nWe are not expecting substantial changes to your travel times while we are working.\n\nSome areas may temporarily experience minor short term delays due to:\n\nan increase of construction vehicles sharing the road\n\ntemporary changes to local roads and temporary bus lane closures\n\ntemporary changes to speed limits\n\ntemporary changes to on street parking.\n\nMaritime vessel movements\n\nYou will notice some increase in harbour maritime traffic when we are building the immersed tube tunnels for the harbour crossing.\n\nWe will manage our work to minimise interruptions to port operations and the navigation of ships and ferries within Sydney Harbour.\n\nIf you spend time on the water you may notice us:\n\nmoving around on barges, tugboats and smaller sea vessels\n\ntemporarily restricting maritime speeds around construction areas and our sites\n\ntemporarily relocating swing moorings at Berrys Bay and using the mooring at Snails Bay for our immersed tube tunnel units\n\nestablishing and operating construction sites at Yurulbin Point and Berrys Bay\n\nestablishing two cofferdams, one off Yurulbin Point at Birchgrove and one off the Coal Loader at Waverton\n\nimplementing exclusion zones around the north and south cofferdams at Birchgrove and Waverton – reducing navigational width\n\nseabed profiling activities in preparation for the installation of immersed tube tunnel units\n\npartially closing Sydney Harbour between Birchgrove and Waverton for a period of up to 48 hours at a time when we install the immersed tube tunnel units.\n\nWe recognise that air quality is important to you.

We will be using a range of measures to reduce the impact of our work including:\n\nproviding additional notification and consultation about upcoming work\n\nlaying out our sites so the noisy equipment is shielded by other buildings and/or stockpiles or is enclosed in acoustic sheds\n\nensuring our equipment is serviced and maintained up to standard\n\nturning off machinery and equipment when not in use\n\nworking within standard construction hours wherever feasible\n\nmanaging construction activities to minimise major noise generating work being done at the same time at the same location\n\nstaging our work so we are not working near the same residents for large durations of time\n\ninstalling hoardings and temporary noise barriers where required\n\nusing acoustic sheds for 24 hour tunnelling activities\n\nproviding noise reduction property treatments to eligible properties\n\nproviding alternative accommodation where appropriate.\n\nAll our work will be carried out in line with the project’s Conditions of Approval, Environment Protection License and Construction Environmental Management Plan which are overseen by the DPIE and Environmental Protection Authority (EPA).\n\nWe will also use noise and vibration monitoring to ensure our measures are effective in complying with our licence conditions, and help us identify if we need to make changes.\n\nWe understand there has been a lot of concern about the potential for vibration and settlement when we are tunnelling to cause damage to homes. Our objective is to ensure there are no buildings at risk of damage from vibration while we are building our tunnels.\n\nWe will offer you a property condition survey if you are located within 50 metres of our work.

If this does not reduce the noise enough then we then look at other options for you. This includes measures like building noise walls or providing your property with noise treatments.\n\nIf your property is potentially eligible for noise treatment we will be in contact with you soon. We want to start our noise treatment program as early as possible so you will benefit from reduced noise before we start construction.\n\nYou do not need to contact us as we will be in touch with you directly, if you are eligible.\n\nPublic transport\n\nWe are not expecting substantial changes to your travel times while we are working. Some areas may temporarily experience minor short term delays due to:\n\nan increase of construction vehicles sharing the road\n\ntemporary changes to local roads and temporary bus lane closures\n\ntemporary changes to speed limits\n\ntemporary changes to on street parking.\n\nOur assessment shows we will have a limited impact on the public transport network around our projects.\n\nWe will need to make some short-term changes to bus stop locations and routes. This may include temporarily moving bus stops by a few hundred metres while work is being carried out or temporarily changing routes to avoid construction work. This may cause some minor increases in bus travel times at certain phases of our work. You will be notified well in advance of any disruptions or changes.\n\nShared user transport\n\nWe will be maintaining the shared user paths on Victoria Road during construction.\n\nPlease explore the map for more information about shared user transport impacts while we are building.\n\nWe understand the character and visual amenity of your local area is important to you. We carried out an urban design, visual and landscape character assessment, which considered the potential for impact to the overall landscape, and visual amenity as a result of our project.\n\nOur project has been designed to make the most of existing transport corridors and built-up urban areas and is largely built underground to minimise impacts on the surface. This is so our project can blend into the surrounding environment and reduce the character and visual impact in local areas where possible.\n\nWe will be further developing the urban design as part of the detailed design with the construction contractor. We will seek your important input to ensure our project integrates with the unique character of your surrounding land and creates spaces which match the aspirations of local communities.\n\nWe will be inviting you to take part in a range of opportunities to provide input and feedback on the urban design and landscaping as the project progresses.\n\nThe boundaries of the project are within the lands of the Cammeraygal people (also known as the Gamaraigal and Kameragal) in the Waverton to Cammeray area and the Darug language group in the Rozelle to Birchgrove area.\n\nWe have engaged with local Aboriginal parties throughout development of our design and assessments. We held two Aboriginal focus groups to seek input. This input has been invaluable to the development of our management measures.\n\nOur studies confirm evidence of Aboriginal occupation along and around the project area, particularly relating to historical areas of plentiful food resources, movement pathways, and meeting and camping sites located near locations such as Berrys Bay, Yurulbin Park and the Sydney Harbour foreshore.\n\nFor more information about Aboriginal heritage items listed in the assessment, please see chapter 15 of the EIS.\n\nWe know there are many important archaeological and historical sites along the project alignment. Our assessment found one hundred and thirteen non-Aboriginal heritage items, across the project alignment, which could potentially be impacted by our project. Several of these items are located around Rozelle.\n\nOur project has been assessed as having a minor non-Aboriginal heritage impact. This is because we are building underground tunnels which avoid impacting heritage items above ground, and using existing road infrastructure.\n\nPlease explore the map for more information about some of the key non-Aboriginal heritage items the local community has expressed an interest in during our ongoing consultation and have been identified in our assessment. For more information on all non-Aboriginal heritage items, please see chapter 14 of the EIS."
