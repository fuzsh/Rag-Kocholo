        "text": "Dark Spectrum is an immersive and multi-sensory event that is part of Vivid Sydney’s fabulous 2024 program. While it has a lot going on for it — from lanterns and pretty lights to luminous ropes and pulsating music, the most compelling aspect of the event was the location itself. Held away from the crowds and hubbub of Sydney CBD, the event has taken over Wynyard Station, more specifically its unused and long abandoned tunnels which had so far been hiding behind, would you believe it — a rather plain-looking door next to a Coles supermarket. But why are there secret tunnels under one of Sydney’s busiest train stations?\n\nSecret Tunnels, Wynyard Station\n\nFor years Sydney’s Wynard Station has had its own hidden tunnels, unbeknownst to commuters and the general public. When they first opened for Vivid, excitement was naturally high. But you’d be surprised to know that this well-kept secret has actually been around since the 1930s. The network of tunnels was essentially built for a train line that would cross the harbour and continue to the city’s northern beaches.\n\nThe project never materialised and was soon abandoned along with the tunnels although a section continues to be used as a carpark for the Menzies Hotel and as public parking. The tunnels later became part of the tram network for several decades until the late 1950s. Now you’ll find platforms three, four, five and six at Wynyard Station, platforms 1 and 2 are hidden behind a nondescript wall and don’t have any trains.\n\nInterestingly, these aren’t the only ones. In fact, there are just as many unused tunnels in Sydney as the ones in use. Among them are The Darling Harbour Railway Tunnel, the oldest railway tunnel to be constructed in NSW, the Old Glenbrook Tunnel which was built back in the 1800s and the old abandoned Helensburgh Tunnel which is now home to a colony of glow worms.\n\nKeen to get a glimpse of these abandoned tunnels? Museums of History NSW does limited annual tours of some of the tunnels but you have to get in fast since they sell out soon. Keep an eye on their website for announcements and get more information about these lost tunnels here."
