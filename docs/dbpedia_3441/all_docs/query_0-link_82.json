        "text": "The Philippine Tunneling Society (PTS) is holding a talk on August 15th titled \"Catalogue of Philippine Tunnels and Underground Space - a Work in Progress.\" As well as in-person attendance, the PTS has provided a Zoom webinar option, so feel free to register and listen in to show your support for the newest member of the ITA. The Philippines joined the ITA as the 80th Member Nation at the WTC held this year in Shenzhen and the ATS welcomes the PTS as a regional neighbour. #philippinetunnelsociety #australiantunnellingsociety\n\nATS Short Course: 27-29 November, Brisbane. Speaker Spotlight on: Brodie Aitchison from Aurecon. Brodie will give an Introduction to Tunnel Design on 27 November at 8:45am. BOOK NOW! ðŸ“£Brodie Aitchison BioðŸ“£ Brodie is a Chartered Civil Engineer specialising in delivering tunnelling projects. His expertise spans civil, structural, and geotechnical engineering disciplines for underground infrastructure projects, including tunnels, caverns, adits and portals. He has successfully designed, coordinated and led tunnelling work on projects throughout Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong. Brodie is the Chair of the ATS Young Members and sits on the ITA Young Membersâ€™ steering board, where he promotes underground space for sustainable development by connecting, developing, and promoting young tunnellers worldwide. Brodie has been part of developing the ATS Tunnel Design Guideline as an author and chair for the second edition. DON'T MISS YOUR SPOT AT THIS PREMIER EVENT. REGISTER HERE: https://lnkd.in/gJAmS34b The ATS Short Course 2024 is a multi-day event, designed to provide an introduction to the world of tunnels and is a must for tunnelling professionals. It is delivered by experienced professionals from Australian tunnelling who have specialist knowledge in their discipline field.\n\nðŸ“¢ Join us for an online technical presentation on Geocomposite Tunnel Invert Drainage â€“ August 29, 5:00pm - 6:00pm (AEST) - where expert speakers Goran Erak and Amir Shahkolahi from Global Synthetics Pty Ltd will present on the following topic: Cavidrain Invert geocomposite systems are used to form a drainage layer beneath the road pavement of tunnel floors. The use of Cavidrain Invert offers a number of advantages over more traditional methods (which use crushed stone and pipes) such as: (i) reduced excavation (as they form a much thinner layer compared to crushed stone layers, requiring less excavation thus accelerating the construction process); (ii) faster installation (they can be quickly laid down, reducing installation time compared to traditional methods); (iii) lower costs (achieved through the reduction of excavation and the acceleration of the construction process); (iv) improved drainage (as they provide larger void to facilitate a better water flow compared to crushed stone and thus ensuring effective drainage); (v) reduced mineral scale buildup (by mitigating problems caused by mineral deposits that can clog traditional drainage systems). This presentation demonstrates the use of Cavidrain Invert in projects such as the Cross River Rail and how these projects integrated this system into the design and construction. Don't miss out.

Snowy 2.0 is a major pumped-storage expansion of the Snowy Mountains hydropower scheme, which forms a vital part of Australiaâ€™s energy transition towards a low-emissions future. The project will substantially increase the existing schemeâ€™s capacity, adding 2200 MW of energy generation capacity and large-scale energy storage of 350,000 MW hours. At full capacity, Snowy 2.0 could operate for almost seven days without recharge pumping, providing deep energy storage necessary to underpin increasing wind and solar generation. Not unlike the existing scheme, the Snowy 2.0 project involves substantial underground works, both in terms of scale and complexity. The key elements include 33km of TBM-driven tunnels, 10km of D&B tunnels, three shafts, and a large power station cavern complex located 750m underground. This Technical Session will provide an overview of the Snowy 2.0 project, along with an update on the delivery of key underground elements. Following this, a deeper dive will be provided into elements of the geotechnical approach to the delivery of the underground power station cavern complex. The Snowy 2.0 caverns are amongst the largest and deepest in the world and are being delivered with a highly observational approach, in which design predictions are continually reviewed against actual ground behaviour and support performance during construction. In support of this approach, the project has developed a comprehensive 3D ground model that spans not only the caverns but also the surrounding network of tunnels.

This event is completely free to ATS members. Join today! https://lnkd.in/gesYreiG\n\nRegistrations for the Shotcrete 2024 workshop are filling fast, so donâ€™t miss out, book your seat now: 14th-15th Aug, Melbourne, with optional field trip on the 16th. The workshop will cover a range of topics related to developments in shotcrete for ground support in Australia. The format will comprise a first day of lectures covering the essentials of shotcrete technology for all applications, the second day will focus on more advanced aspects of shotcrete relevant to civil tunnels and infra-structure. It will finish with a facilitated interactive discussion where all attendees can share their experiences, views and identify areas of need for further information. There is an optional field trip on day 3 to the Fire Testing Laboratory at Victoria University, Werribee. Find out more at the link below: https://lnkd.in/gseuji3b"
