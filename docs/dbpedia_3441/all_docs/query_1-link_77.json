The Beaches Link project included twin tunnels approximately 6.5km long.\n\nIn an updated statement, Transport for NSW said it will now write to the Department of Planning and Environment to withdraw its State Significant Infrastructure Application for this project.\n\n“Transport will continue to carry out a road network review to assess what, if any, network improvements may be required in northern Sydney and other impacted areas to ensure a safe, efficient and reliable road network for motorists,” the statement said.\n\nThe Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway Upgrade was planned as a major transport infrastructure project designed to make it easier, faster and safer to get around Sydney.\n\nBy creating a western bypass of the Sydney CBD, the Western Harbour Tunnel was planned to take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors to improve transport capacity in and around Sydney Harbour."
