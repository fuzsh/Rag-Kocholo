        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel will connect to WestConnex at the Rozelle Interchange, cross under Sydney Harbour between the Birchgrove and Waverton areas and connect with the Warringah Freeway at North Sydney. As part of the project, the Warringah Freeway Upgrade will make the road safer and more efficient.\n\nBeaches Link is a tunnel which will connect to the Warringah Freeway, cross under Middle Harbour connecting with the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation at Balgowlah and the Wakehurst Parkway. The Wakehurst Parkway will be upgraded to two lanes each way between Seaforth and Frenchs Forest.\n\nCJC was engaged by Roads and Maritime Services (now Transport for NSW) to undertake a constructability assessment for the development of the Reference Design for surface and structures works. This involved working closely with the RMS Project Team to develop the design, and input into cost estimates, programmes, risk assessments and the environmental impact statement.\n\nThe constructability assessment included developing detailed construction method statements, construction staging, a construction program and traffic management measures."
