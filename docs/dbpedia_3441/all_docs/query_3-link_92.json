Both operational motorways are providing significant travel time savings to Sydney motorists.\n\nThe new extensions of the M4 and M8, 7.5km tunnels linking the M4 at Haberfield with the M8 at St Peters, with connections to the Anzac and Iron Cove bridges via the Rozelle Interchange opened in January 2023.\n\nThe final stage of WestConnex, the Rozelle Interchange, opening in 2024, is being delivered by the NSW Government and will connect the M4-M8 extension to the Anzac and Iron Cove bridges, and the future Western Harbour Tunnel."
