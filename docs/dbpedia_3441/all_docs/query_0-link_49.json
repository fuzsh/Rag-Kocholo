        "text": "Australian Place Style Guide View history\n\nAll Places need to comply with the Waze editing philosophy, only add places that are relevant to Waze's function as a navigation app - that is, possible destinations, or features that aid orientation. Other types of places aren't in line with the Waze map editing goal of SIMPLICITY.\n\nIf you decide you want to create a Place in the editor, the best way to ensure it doesn't need constant maintenance, is to do it right the first time. Fill in all the information you possibly can, don't just add places to the map because it's there.\n\nCreation Requirements\n\nAt a bare minimum, your created Place needs to have:\n\nTitle/Name (for Chains, use Business Name, Location, like \"McDonald's Silverwater\")\n\nRelevant Category\n\nAnd a best effort for the following information: (be aware some fields may not need filling in, depending on the type of Place)\n\nAddress\n\nDon't include the route number of the road in the address, e.g. \"1302 Princes Hwy\", not \"1302 A32 - Princes Hwy\".\n\nShort, Accurate and Unbiased description\n\nBy this we mean no opinions on a particular Place, stick to the facts or don't add Places at all.\n\nEntry point (this aids more in Area Place navigation to ensure the route goes to the correct street.\n\nAppropriate Lock Level (more on this below).\n\nAppropriate use of Area/Point Places\n\nMost Places should be a Point Place. The exceptions are water bodies, parks, relevant places that can be used at a glance to orient the driver, and Places that should be shown on the map (petrol stations). See When to use Area/Point\n\nWebsite and/or Phone (if available)\n\nDo NOT use Facebook, even if it's the company's official Facebook page. You must use a website that belongs directly to the business owner, not any third party hosting site. Check that the website doesn't prohibit linking without permission. Their Terms & Conditions page will usually include any restrictions. Australia Post, for example, requires a formal approval process.\n\nAccurate Services (some check-boxes may not apply to a certain type of place)\n\nOpening hours (if set, not variable)\n\nNote\n\n[L2+] If possible, add an external provider. This not only assists with making sure the place is in the correct spot, it also allows us to link that place to the Google Result.\n\nDon't stretch Area Places so that they intersect with road segments, they should come a little bit back from the road, as this avoids problems with editing geometry of both segments & Places.\n\nLocking\n\nAt a maximum for most places lock level, not under Vandalism or any special circumstances, should be 3. See the table below for more detail.\n\nExamples:\n\nPetrol station with all data filled out and complete, L3.\n\nPetrol station with name and minimal info, L2.\n\nPark in the suburbs, with no data, L1\n\nPark with all relevant data added and nothing left to add, L2.\n\nSydney Harbour (complex geometrical shape, necessary for orientation on Waze map), L3.\n\nCommon Issues\n\nFor your first 10 Places, you will need the changes reviewed by another editor. Once you have 10 approvals, you may create places without immediate moderation.\n\nExternal Providers can be added only by L2 or higher editors. If you try to as L1, your Place will not Save.\n\nTable of Places\n\nParent category type Lock Level comments min max Car Services - Point 1 3 - Car Services Petrol Station Area 2 3 Naming Standard: Brand + Suburb Name (Direction)\n\nIf there is more than one Petrol Station of the same brand in the same area, name it with direction as well. (e.g. Caltex Cronulla Sth)\n\nThese should be Area Places, and cover the entire land owned by the Petrol Station.\n\nCar Services Car Mechanic / Services Point 1 2 Car Services Car Wash Point 1 2 If a petrol station has this facility, please add as a secondary category. Car Services EV Charging Station (EVCS) Point 4 4 These are electric vehicle charging points. They should always be added as their own place instead of a secondary category. Please follow guidelines in the EV Charging Stations Wazeopedia page when mapping them. Transportation - Point 1 3 Transportation Airport Area 3 3 Airports should be mapped carefully. This is a very highly travelled area, and directions to these need to be precise. Please only use these Places in collaboration with your local experts. Transportation Bus Station Point 1 2 Transportation Ferry Terminal Area 2 3 Point if Private, Area if Public Transportation Marina / Harbour Area 2 3 Point if Private, Area if Public Transportation Underground Station Point 2 3 Since these are underground a Point place is necessary to ensure that it's not shown on the map. Appropriate Entry points must be set for these stations. Transportation Train Station Area 2 3 Naming Standard: Station Name + \"Train Station\". (e.g. Hurstville Train Station)\n\nArea is over the entire platform.\n\nTransportation Bridge Area 2 3 Use only to represent a named road bridge with local or navigational significance, preferably indicated with a signage at each approach.\n\nBridges without names are not to be mapped.\n\nTransportation Tunnel Area 1 2 We do not map Tunnels in Australia unless they are significant landmarks. Transportation Taxi Rank Point 1 2 Naming Standard: Road Name + Taxi Rank (e.g. Stone Rd Taxi Rank)\n\nUse only to represent actual taxi ranks designed for use by the public.\n\nTransportation Junction / Interchange Area 2 3 Use only to represent significant landmark interchange areas, such as the Sir Roden Cutler VC Interchange. Transportation Rest Area Area 2 3 Naming Standard -\n\n\"Rest Area\" - (Route Number) Street Name (- Direction/Locality)\n\ne.g. Truck Rest Area - A1 Bruce Hwy - Granite Creek\n\n-\n\nIf it's a Truck only Rest Area, name it \"Truck Rest Area\" + the standard naming convention.\n\nTransportation Carpool Spot Point 1 2 Not active in Australia, please do not add this category. Professional and Public - Point 1 3 - Professional and Public University / Higher Education Area 2 3 Professional and Public Primary / Secondary School Area 1 3 Use full school name. Any acronyms can be places as an alternative name. (e.g. Burraneer Bay Public School, alt \"BBPS\").\n\nFor places such as Driving, Art, Music, Tuition Centres and Training Centres, use Professional and Public as Primary category and School as Secondary category\n\nProfessional and Public Convention / Event Centre Area 2 3 Area if large centre, Point if residential or smaller.

If a Park has no official name, use a combined name of the bounding streets.\n\n(e.g. if bounded by Fisher St & Dunning Rd, Park name is \"Fisher Dunning Park\")\n\nOutdoors Playground - - - We do not map playgrounds in Australia. Instead map the Parks they reside in. Outdoors Beach Area 2 3 Beaches should be mapped as Areas to their fullest extent, and with a navigation point at the main entry area. Outdoors Sports Court Area 1 2 Outdoors Golf Course Area 1 2 Outdoors Plaza Point 1 2 Outdoors Promenade Point 1 2 Outdoors Natural Pool / Pond Point 1 2 Outdoors Services / Layby\n\n(Scenic Lookout / Viewpoint)\n\nPoint 2 3 Outdoors Ski Area Area 2 3 Do not map the mountain they reside on, only the base area. Natural Features - Point 3 6 - Natural Features Island Area 3 3 Islands should be used carefully. These should only be used to map actual islands, or to fix waterline issues (please leave name blank). Consult a L3 or higher before attempting this. Natural Features Sea / Lake Area 3 6 These are very complex polygons, please do not lock any lower than L3. Natural Features River / Creek Area 3 5 The area should encompass the body of water until it meets another River / Stream or a Sea / Lake. Natural Features Forest / Bush Area 3 3 Use this only for named forests / national parks. Natural Features Farm Area 3 3 Only farms that are open to public and are a tourist attraction should be mapped. Natural Features Canal / Ditch / Aqueduct Area 3 3 Natural Features Marsh / Wetlands Area 3 3 Natural Features Dam Area 3 3 Do not use this unless it can be actively used to assist in navigation / view-able from the road. Residential Place - Point 1 1 RPP's should only be used when fixing a navigation issue, or when adding supporting photography, to assist in residence discovery.\n\nResidential Point Places\n\nIn some circumstances, House Numbers can't be used to specify a street address. A Residential Place Point [RPP] can be used to overcome that limitation. The rules for a successful RPP are:\n\nThe abbreviation of the street type in the RPP must match a list of accepted abbreviations, which is not directly accessible to us. Most of the standard abbreviations in the Abbreviations and Acronyms list have been found to work, except that Crescent must be abbreviated as Cres, and Avenue must be abbreviated as Ave.\n\nThe Street Name and City in the RPP must match those of a nearby segment. If necessary, add an alt-name to the segment to provide a match. (For example, a street address of 123 Princes Hwy, Dandenong on a segment identified as ALTNR1 - Princes Hwy would require an alt-name of Princes Hwy, Dandenong on the highway segment. Note that the City name is required, but can't be added to the alt-name if the main name for the segment is flagged as \"None\". To overcome this, add a City name to the main name, then add the City in the alt-name, save your changes, then flag the main City name as \"None\" and save again. )\n\nThe RPP must have an explicit entry point.\n\nThe RPP will become effective in minutes, unless there were changes in the street name that need to be incorporated in the live map."
