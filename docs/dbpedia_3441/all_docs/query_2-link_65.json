        "text": "The Sydney Harbour Bridge, standing next to the Sydney Opera House in the city’s harbor is the world’s tallest steel arch bridge and one of the country’s most iconic landmarks.\n\nBack in 2019, Budget Direct partnered with NeoMam Studios and created rendered images of six design proposals that didn’t make the cut during the successive competitions, which led to the winning design of Dorman Long.\n\nFurthermore, the first worldwide competition for the project was held in 1900, and more than 70 designs were submitted, but none of them were successful. Following successive competitions, a winning design was selected in 1924 and inaugurated in 1932.\n\nThe bridge is currently the world’s eighth longest spanning-arch bridge, as well as holder of the title for the tallest steel arch bridge, standing at a height of 134 meters (160 ft.) above water. The structure measures 48.8 meters (160 ft.) in width, which also made it the world’s widest long-span bridge until 2012.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that the design proposed by Norman Selfe had actually been accepted by the authorities, but a worsening economic situation and a change of government led to its eventual rejection."
