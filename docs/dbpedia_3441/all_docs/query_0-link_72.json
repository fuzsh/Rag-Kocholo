Presenting the string quartets of cutting-edge American composer, Jennifer Higdon, alongside masters Haydn, Shostakovich and Tchaikovsky. Music from a time when life seemed straightforward, from deceptively simple arrangements to more complex structures that assign parts equal importance. Music to release a woman driven by a man to acts of insanity, music that liberates closet homosexuality and unacceptance, and melodies that brought Tolstoy to tears amid depression. What positive can come from this? Some of the best chamber music ever written. Music to free the soul.

The proposed C6a construction ancillary facility site would be located on the south side of The Crescent to the west of James Craig Road and adjacent to Rozelle Bay. The proposed modification would allow use of the site for a limited number of additional purposes which are not permitted by Condition C24 including:\n\nâ Light vehicle parking for workers (around 9 spaces) and\n\nâ Material laydown areas and a limited number of associated vehicle movements (small delivery vans and rigid trucks).\n\nMore Noise, More Traffic, More Air Pollution and loss of Mural\n\nThe Modification report will be exhibited for 28 days from 21 August to 18 September 2019.\n\nApplication Number SSI-7485-Mod-2\n\nAssessment Type SSI Modifications\n\nDevelopment Type Road transport facilities\n\nLocal Government Areas Canada Bay, Inner West, City of Sydney\n\nExhibition Start 21/08/2019 Exhibition End 18/09/2019\n\nMore information including making a submission\n\nhttps://www.planningportal.nsw.gov.au/major-projects/project/16516\n\nM4 - M5 Rozelle Interchange\n\nIf you havenât already heard RMS have released a modification to the M4-M5 Rozelle Interchange which will now include a new car overpass at The Crescent and significant changes to the promised pedestrian and cyclist access routes.\n\nThe Crescent overpass and active transport links Modification will remove the continuous GreenLink connecting Rozelle across the City-West Link to the foreshore. The Greenlink was designed to safely reconnect Innerwest communities and provide direct access to the water.\n\nThere seem to be a number of significant impacts to our community and how we safely access the foreshore from Annandale, Lilyfield and Rozelle - even Forest Lodge and Glebe.\n\nRMS are asking for feedback and it is the only opportunity to push them to look at alternate options and reinstate safe, direct access as in the approved GreenLink. We need all residents, community groups, clubs and interested groups to make a submission by Wednesday 18 September. You can do this electronically or writing to the DPIE.\n\nIdentified impacts for residents and commuters in the Innerwest wanting to access the foreshore and its facilities.\n\nThere will be significantly reduced safety and increased risk with removed pedestrian and cyclists access above The Crescent to Bicentennial Park.\n\nUnsafe and indirect access across five sets of pedestrian lights at The Crescent to reach the foreshore/railyards. The part Greenlink and concrete plaza at Rozelle Bay light rail still require you to cross at the five sets of lights on The Crescent.\n\nRemoval of direct active links to the foreshore (including the new skatepark and kids playground), cutting our communities off from the foreshore and the proposed revitalisation of the entire Bays Precinct.\n\nThe proposed modification has no updated Urban Design and Landscape Plan (or peer review ). The original EIS had both. The modification considerably changes the design intent of the approved EIS design.\n\nTraffic changes that limit movements around the suburb and create further congestion in the local streets of Annandale, Forest Lodge, Glebe, Lilyfield and Rozelle with no planning to deal with these but pushing them back on to Council.\n\nWe are asking you to now spread the word to your neighbours, to your colleagues, to your clubs, to your networks, to your friends - and ask people to read the information.\n\nFurther details on the Modification at Facebook https://www.facebook.com/foreshorecommunity\n\nRMS portal for submissions. https://www.planningportal.nsw.gov.au/major-projects/project/16516\n\nFrom Rozelle Interchange Work notification | 28 August 2019:\n\n\"4.0 Preparation work at Buruwan Park\n\nAs part of the upgrade of the intersection of The Crescent and City West Link the area within Buruwan Park will become part of the new road. New cyclist and pedestrian connections will be established as part of the permanent design, as well as a land bridge to the up to 10-hectare park within the Rail Yards. Work will begin in September to prepare for future construction within the park and activities include:\n\nsetting up a safe work area with fencing and site-specific environmental controls\n\ntree clearing and vegetation removal\n\ndesign investigation work\n\nutility relocation work\n\nAccess to the Rozelle Bay light rail station from Bayview Crescent will be maintained at all times. Pedestrian and cyclist access through Buruwan Park will be maintained until the end of this year and traffic control will be in place when we are working, to assist pedestrians and cyclists throughout these changes.\n\n2.0 Site establishment work\n\nWork continues to establish the sites and equipment we will need to construct the project. In September we begin installing the site facilities and amenities including offices and sheds, fencing and noise walls. Some permanent parking removal took effect on local streets in July and as our work progresses, further temporary and permanent parking removal will be required on local streets. Site establishment activities include:\n\ninstallation of site fencing, scaffolding, noise walls, retaining walls, hoarding, access points and traffic barriers\n\ninstallation of signage and relocation of street lighting poles\n\ninternal clearing within buildings and removal of contaminated materials\n\ndemolition of buildings and removal of structures\n\nutility installation, disconnections and protections\n\nearth and concrete work to level the sites and to build hard surface areas which includes footpaths and foundations for tunnel acoustic sheds along with spoil removal.\n\ninstallation of site sheds and offices, worker facilities, parking and environmental controls including sealing of storage areas\n\nbuilding foundations (piling) to support construction of temporary noise barriers, fencing tunnel access ramps and acoustic sheds\n\nclearing trees and vegetation within and around our sites including Buruwan Park, Victoria Road, City West Link, The Crescent\"\n\nremoval of medians and pavement work along City West Link and The Crescent\n\nSource and more information in Rozelle Interchange Work notification | 28 August 2019 at https://www.westconnex.com.au/sites/default/files/Rozelle%20Interchange%20-%20N0039%20-%20Rozelle%20Rail%20Yards%2C%20Victoria%20Road%20South%20and%20The%20Crescent%20construction%20update%20-%20September%202019.pdf\n\nWrite to Minister Stokes to Save Buruwan Park\n\nThe fences have gone up around Buruwan Park: https://www.facebook.com/nowestconnexannandale/photos/a.760413550713310/2203815693039748/\n\nPlease write to Minister Stokes to Save Our Park: at Parliament\n\nWith the re-election of the Berejiklian government, New South Wales now has a minister for public spaces, Rob Stokes...more\n\nPublic Spaces Minister plans to buy Sydney's 'forgotten land' for open space..more\n\nRally for our Trees\n\n8am Monday 9 September Buruwan Park.\n\nBuruwan Park Rally for the Trees\n\nWhat's on in Annandale (8 Sep)\n\nRally for the Trees - Westconnex moves into Buruwan Park 8am Monday 9 September 2019, Buruwan Park (Rozelle Bay Light Rail Stop) http://ramin.com.au/annandale/#rallySep9\n\nJohnston Street Jazz every Thursday 8pm - 10-ish,Annandale Creative Arts Centre, 81 Johnston St http://ramin.com.au/annandale/#jazz\n\nFreedom & Equality-The Phoenix Collective String Quartet 15 September 2019 at 2.30pm, Hunter Baillie Church https://phoenixcollective.com.au/\n\nMake a submission to Westconnex's new plans for Annandale and Rozelle before 18 September 2019 http://ramin.com.au/annandale/#aug19-mod\n\nLoaded Dog Folk Club - One Saturday night each month Annandale Community Centre, 79 Johnston St, ANNANDALE http://ramin.com.au/annandale/#dog\n\nLive Music AT THE NEWSAGENCY, Pyrmont Bridge Road Annandale http://www.thenewsagencyvenue.com/\n\nAnnandale Playgroup https://www.playgroupnsw.org.au/Playgroup/Playgroups/Annandale\n\nKnitting for Penguins at the Annandale Craft Group Fridays 11am - 4pm, Annandale Community Centre http://ramin.com.au/annandale/Annandale-Craft-Group.shtml\n\nAnnandale Aqueducts and Viaducts\n\nTalk and guided walking tour\n\nTake a look at this landscape of aqueducts and viaducts, where classical arches of the aqueducts add beauty.

This routine soon morphed into playing together in each otherâs homes as near-neighbours and mutual admirers of the otherâs music. Bassist Phil Stack was awarded first place in the 2008 National Jazz Awards and toured for many years with James Morrison and other distinguished jazz artists, as well as leading the Phil Stack Trio. He is also the founding mainstay bass guitarist of the well-known pop rock band Thirsty Merc, and writes and performs his original songs for his own solo project.\n\nMark Isaacs is an esteemed composer, pianist and conductor in classical music and jazz. Heâs written symphonies and concertos, plays classical piano and has performed or recorded with some of the biggest names in international jazz including Roy Haynes, Dave Holland, Kenny Wheeler and Vinnie Colaiuta as well as touring his home-grown Resurgence band. Mark is also a songwriter.\n\nMark and Phil will be playing tunes that they both love from the standard repertoire, whether swinging, ballads, Latin, groove or anything in between. Free For All\n\nThis will be the last Free For All for a month. Come down and play something you've never played before, sing something you've never sung before, dance something you've never danced before.

This failure has undermined the justification for the project and has exacerbated community opposition.\n\nFinding 5: That the transparency arrangements pertaining to the WestConnex business case have been unsatisfactory.\n\nFinding 9:That, given the Sydney Gateway project was a key part of the original rationale and business case for the WestConnex project, its removal from the WestConnex project will likely have led to a significant change in the cost-benefit ratio for the entire project.\n\nRecommendation 4:That the NSW Government immediately publish the base-case financial model for the WestConnex project.\n\nRecommendation 10:That the NSW Government proceed with Stage 3 of the WestConnex .\n\nRecommendation 11: That the NSW Government immediately publish a full account of all costs to be incurred by NSW taxpayers if Stage 3 contracts were cancelled.\n\nRecommendation 6: That the NSW Government ensure that the Audit Office of New South Wales has the resources required to undertake a detailed and comprehensive performance audit of the WestConnex project in 2019/2020.\n\nDissenting Report and Statement\n\nThe show must not go on!\n\nDissenting Report Ms Cate Faehrmann MLC, The Greens:\n\n\"This has been an extremely important inquiry and the final committee report details a litany of failures by the NSW Government in the delivery of the WestConnex project which have had a real and lasting negative impact on peopleâs lives, have eroded public trust and had significant costs for taxpayers.\"\n\n\"1. WestConnex should never have been approved or built\"\n\n\"Finding: That the NSW Government should have invested the public funds spent on the WestConnex project on improving public transport, including for western Sydney.\"\n\n\"Finding: That the separation of the Sydney Gateway Project from the WestConnex project was an attempt by the NSW Government to hide further WestConnex project cost increases.\"\n\n\"Finding: That if the full range of costs were adequately considered, and if the cost blow outs and scope changes were taken into account, it is probable that an updated business case for the WestConnex would not have a positive cost-benefit ratio.\"\n\nDissenting Statement, The Hon Daniel Mookhey MLC and The Hon Greg Donnelly MLC, Australian Labor Party<\n\n\"WestConnex promised much - Port Botany would directly connect with Sydneyâs major arterial roads.

The Gemilang-bodied, BYD electric chassis buses use around 80kW per hour; however, the vehicle also regenerates approximately 30-40 per cent of its battery capacity through braking, depending on traffic conditions.\n\nELECTRIC BUS ROUTES\n\nThe following routes have been chosen due to their close proximity to Leichhardt depot, so that operations and performance can be closely monitored during the trial:\n\n* Route 389 â Bondi Junction to Pyrmont\n\n* Route 431 â Glebe Point to City (Martin Place)\n\n* Route 433 â Balmain to Railway Square\n\n* Route 447 â Lilyfield to Leichhardt Marketplace (loop service)\n\n* Route 470 â Lilyfield to City (Martin Place)\n\nMore including photos at https://www.busnews.com.au/industry-news/1906/sydney-region-6-electric-bus-trial-starts-1-july-routes-confirmed\n\nWhat's on in Annandale (3 July 2019)\n\nListen out for a 433 or 470 Electric Bus!\n\nhttps://www.busnews.com.au/industry-news/1906/sydney-region-6-electric-bus-trial-starts-1-july-routes-confirmed\n\nInner West Council draft Transport and Housing Strategies on Exhibition until 28 July 2019 Drop in session: Tuesday 9 July, 2-4pm: Annandale Community Centre\n\nhttps://perambuler.ramin.com.au/2019/07/inner-west-council-draft-integrated.html\n\nWalking with Joy Workshop August 4 and 11\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#feld-walk\n\n18 July at Johnston St Jazz: Renata Arrivolo Jazz Trio\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#jazz\n\nSunday, 21 July 1-5pm Boomerang Bags Sewing Bee\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#boomA\n\nJuly 27 at the Loaded Dog: Jason & Chloe supported by Buck & Deanne\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#dog\n\n--\n\nMarghanita da Cruz\n\nEditor Annandale on the Web\n\nTelephone: 0414-869202\n\nEmail: marghanita@ramin.com.au\n\nWebsite: http://ramin.com.au/annandale\n\nTime of Marrai'gang - Bana'murrai'yung (wet becoming cooler) April - June\n\nInner West Council seeking feedback on\n\nStreetscape Improvements Master Plan - Annandale, Camperdown, Leichhardt and Petersham (until 1 July 2019)\n\nCouncil's key strategic documents 2019 to 2029 draft (until 11 June 2019)\n\nMore information and have your say at: https://yoursay.innerwest.nsw.gov.au/\n\ncries of the Marrai'gang (Quoll) seeking his mate..more\n\nWhat's on in Annandale (14 June)\n\nKirkin'o' the Tartan\n\n16th June, 10am\n\nhttps://www.hunterbaillie.com/upcoming-events\n\nBoomerang Bags Sewing Bee\n\nSUN, 16 JUN 1-5pm\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#boomA\n\nThe Convict Voice ReCollected + Cap in Hand (equal billing)\n\nJune 22, 7.30pm (doors open 7.00pm)\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/#dog\n\nWW1 bust of Annandale Hero Douglas Grant found\n\nhttp://ramin.com.au/annandale/story1-douglas-grant.shtml#bust\n\nAugust 25: Footprints ecoFestival\n\nhttps://www.innerwest.nsw.gov.au/explore/whats-on/events-in-detail/footprints-ecofestival\n\nWestconnex forces Swadlings to move\n\n\"âWe opened for trade in St Peters on the seventh,â says Swadling, with a touch of understandable pride. It took three weeks of almost constant work: the hardware store and shed racks were ready, but none of the outside racks had been built, so Swadlings used the mill space to store all the timber and unpacked it over January/February as they built the sheds. âWe put our fastest movers in the first shed, our second-fastest in the second shed and the slower-moving ones in the last shed we built,â says Swadling.\n\nRegular customers werenât aware of the juggle â orders were filled as usual and even special order moulding profiles were cut at the familyâs other store in Annandale.
