The final section of this critical Sydney motorway network, Rozelle Interchange​, opened on the weekend with the first vehicles (with police escorts for safety) entering the tunnel through entry points at Anzac Bridge, Victoria Road and City West Link early on Sunday morning (26 November).",

        "text": "Rozelle Interchange, delivered by the NSW Government and now operated by Transurban, has unlocked new journeys for Sydney motorists, making travel in and around the city safer, and more reliable. The interchange’s new tunnels are already helping motorists bypass seven sets of traffic lights (on Victoria Road through Rozelle), supported by the toll-free Iron Cove Link.​\n\nWith the completion of WestConnex, motorists travelling from Parramatta to the city are expected to save around 19 minutes in travel time (including skipping 33 sets of traffic lights) when taking the M4 and Rozelle Interchange during the morning peak. And motorists travelling on WestConnex’s M4 and M8 motorways can now continue to the Anzac and Iron Cove bridges and the City West Link via the new interchange. The new Western Harbour Tunnel​, when complete (target 2028), will also be accessible via this route.\n\nAs well as this new connectivity, the Rozelle Interchange project included the transformation of a disused rail yard into more than 10 hectares of new green open space and active transport connections for the area’s local community.\n\nThe delivery of WestConnex has been an immense effort, delivered in collaboration with the New South Wales Government, our delivery partners and the project’s local communities. We look forward to seeing Sydneysiders get the most out of their journeys on WestConnex and beyond."
