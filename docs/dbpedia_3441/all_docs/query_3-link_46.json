        "text": "The Western Harbour Tunnel project will deliver a western bypass of Sydney’s CBD and significantly reduce travel times for Sydney motorists, particularly between the North Shore, Northern Beaches and Sydney’s inner west. Once complete, the new tunnel is estimated to cut traffic by 35% in the Western Distributor, and by up to 20% for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nThe second stage of the project involves tunnelling between Birchgrove and Waverton using Tunnel Boring Machines, and then onto North Sydney where it will connect with the planned Beaches Link project and Gore Hill Freeway Connection.\n\nThe APP Group and partner SMEC were re-appointed as Independent Certifier for Stage 2 through the new principal contractor, ACCIONA Construction Australia, after delivering the same role as part of Stage 1 for John Holland and CPB Contractors."
