        "text": "Tunnels connecting the mainline tunnels with the other sections of the road network via Rozelle. The M4-M8 Link (formerly known as the M4-M5 Link project) received NSW planning approval in April 2018.\n\nStage one - construction of the M4-M8 Link Tunnels between the New M4 at Haberfield and the M8 at St Peters and stub tunnels to the Rozelle Interchange. The contractor on this stage is Acciona Samsung Bouygues Joint Venture (ASBJV). This stage is being managed by WestConnex | Transurban.\n\nStage two - construction of the Rozelle Interchange and Iron Cove Link. The contractor on this stage is John Holland and CPB Contractors Joint Venture. This stage is being managed by Transport for NSW.\n\nThe Rozelle Interchange and Iron Cove Link will provide a new underground motorway interchange to City West Link and provide a toll-free underground bypass of Victoria Road between the Iron Cove Bridge and the Anzac Bridge, with links to the approved Western Harbour Tunnel.\n\nThe interchange in Rozelle will be mostly underground and located at the site of the old Rozelle Rail Yards. By building the interchange mostly underground, the project will deliver new active transport options in Rozelle and up to 10 hectares of new open space in the future Rozelle Parklands.\n\nFor information on current and future traffic changes around Rozelle, please visit here.\n\nRozelle Parklands Working Group\n\nThe Rozelle Parklands is up to 10 hectares of public parkland and open space. The Rozelle Interchange project has prepared an Urban Design and Landscape Plan (UDLP) in consultation with Inner West Council, the community and affected landowners and businesses. The UDLP determined items including; landscaping, tunnel portals, tunnels, service buildings, bridges, retaining walls, pedestrian and cyclist access, lighting and wayfinding, heritage, monitoring and maintenance.\n\nWhile the Rozelle Interchange UDLP includes provision for an open space within the Rozelle Parklands precinct, it does not determine the recreational and sport use or maintenance for facilities not described in the UDLP.\n\nTransport for NSW (TfNSW) has completed consultation with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure the Parklands are used in a fair, productive, sustainable and sensitive way for the Rozelle, Lilyfield, Balmain and Annandale community to meet the diverse needs of the community.\n\nThe Rozelle Parklands Working Group (RPWG) was established to manage this consultation and made recommendations to TfNSW under the Terms of Reference.\n\nThe RPWG Recommendations Report has been finalised and was presented to the Minister for Transport in mid-2021.\n\nRPWG forum\n\nThe Working Group was established to determine the optimal uses for the Rozelle Parklands that includes the recreation and sport overlay (including any required facilities) for the Parklands and to ensure all perspectives were considered across government, Council, community and relevant groups, to provide the best outcome for the local community.\n\nThe Working Group provided a forum for collaboration between group members to enable a fair, sustainable, productive and sensitive outcome.\n\nEnvironment and planning\n\nUrban Design and Landscape Plan\n\nThe Urban Design and Landscape Plan (UDLP) outlines the urban design principles and objectives for the Rozelle Interchange project (the Project), including details of the transformation of the former Rozelle Rail Yards into a new open green space of up to ten hectares, similar in size to Victoria Park near Sydney University.\n\nWhen completed the future Rozelle Parklands will have a wetlands with a boardwalk, picnic and BBQ areas, play equipment, pedestrian and cyclist paths and green fields for leisure activities. To walk through the features view the flythrough video.\n\nIn May 2021, the Rozelle Interchange Project Urban Design and Landscape Plan was approved by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment.\n\nThe UDLP was on public display from 10 August till 6 September 2020. The public was directed to our virtual Community Centre to view the full plan, access the interactive map, read the Community Guide and watch an information session.\n\nAll feedback and submissions were carefully reviewed and considered for final design. The Community Guide summarises the feedback and comments we received.\n\nThe Crescent overpass and active transport links Modification – Design Amendment\n\nThe Modification was approved by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment on 30 September 2020. See the Response to Submissions Report on the Department’s Planning Portal.\n\nIn August 2019, changes were proposed to the design and construction of the M4-M5 Link (Rozelle Interchange) as described and assessed in the 2017 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). These changes were described in The Crescent Overpass and active transport links Modification Report (August 2019). Transport for NSW carried out a number of community and stakeholder workshops during the exhibition of this report and as a result of the feedback and the formal submissions received, we reviewed the design we initially proposed. A design review process involved an investigation with the commissioning of a Special Design Review Panel, additional community and stakeholder workshops and additional traffic and pedestrian modelling and assessment.\n\nIn May 2020, the improved Modification design was on exhibition through a Design Amendment Report and the community were invited to make a submission. The submissions and our response during the last exhibition were also made available.\n\nWestern Harbour Tunnel - Southern Tunnel Work\n\nWestern Harbour Tunnel - Southern Tunnel Work\n\nTfNSW awarded John Holland and CPB contractors joint venture (JHCPB) a variation to carry out the Western Harbour Tunnel – Southern Tunnel Work. The additional scope provided to the JHCPB contractors include the delivery of 1.7 kilometres of mainline road tunnels between Emily Street, Rozelle and Cove Street, Birchgrove as well as additional ventilation tunnels, ramps, and other services. Excavation commenced in June 2022 and is anticipated to be completed by mid-2025.\n\nHave a question?"
