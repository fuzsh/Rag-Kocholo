Unless Dave is right, it's pretty much in the middle of the tunnel. Last time I went through it was still the 1 camera. There's a strip of light shining across the road for the camera to capture the photo. That's where the camera is.\n\nTom\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nTom\n\nDrive\n\nNew: 2006 BMW 335i M-Sport | Old: 2000 Galant VR4, MY04 STI WRX, 2009 Audi A4 2.7tdi\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\nThread starter\n\n#4\n\nI went through checking again today and I didn't see any strip of light or any camera things on the roof =/ so it must be really well hidden!\n\nCameras all the way through? Oh snap! I think I definitely might've got done then =/\n\nI know at one point couple years back the Lane Cove Tunnel had cameras all the way through it, but they were proven very dodgy and were replaced with just the one camera..

There used to be just the one in a well lit section at the bottom, but that changed when they brought in the infra red camera's.\n\nFingers crossed for ya dude!\n\nTom\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nTom\n\nDrive\n\nNew: 2006 BMW 335i M-Sport | Old: 2000 Galant VR4, MY04 STI WRX, 2009 Audi A4 2.7tdi\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\nThread starter\n\n#6\n\nHopefully if they did get me, it's for 0-10kmh over and 1 point not 3 haha..\n\nMackTheKnife\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nPaul Mc\n\nDrive\n\n'90 MX5 and '01 LR Freelander V6 Softback\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\n#7\n\nThey allow 10% for speedo error for fixed speed cameras in NSW so if you were doing under 88kp/h you're schweet.\n\nTom\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nTom\n\nDrive\n\nNew: 2006 BMW 335i M-Sport | Old: 2000 Galant VR4, MY04 STI WRX, 2009 Audi A4 2.7tdi\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\nThread starter\n\n#8\n\nWell when I looked at the speedo it was sitting around the 90kmh, so maybe will get a fine for 3-5kmh!\n\nMackTheKnife\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nPaul Mc\n\nDrive\n\n'90 MX5 and '01 LR Freelander V6 Softback\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\n#9\n\nIt'd be nothing up to 88kph and 0-10 for up to 90kph and 10-20 for over 90kph.\n\nThey just don't issue fines for those within the 10%. That's a bit of what I learned at a drivers offenders course I did many moons ago to get out of a big speeding fine. The police officer giving the presentation seemed focussed on teaching us how to not get caught.\n\nIn my old (well 2008 model) civic I had a digital speedo and a really good cruise control, so I used to set cruise at 86kph for that stretch and had no issues after going through hundreds of times.\n\nThe Mobile Speed camera's are a whole different story because they are Macquarie Bank's and they don't give any leeway at all as far as I know.\n\nTom\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nTom\n\nDrive\n\nNew: 2006 BMW 335i M-Sport | Old: 2000 Galant VR4, MY04 STI WRX, 2009 Audi A4 2.7tdi\n\nSep 24, 2010\n\nThread starter\n\n#10\n\nSigh well I hope I'll be okay!\n\nThanks for your help dude, great weight off my mind!\n\nMackTheKnife\n\nLeaving Skid Marks\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nPaul Mc\n\nDrive\n\n'90 MX5 and '01 LR Freelander V6 Softback\n\naz1310\n\nHesitantly Boosting\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nAaron\n\nDrive\n\n1999 Legnum VR4\n\nSep 25, 2010\n\n#12\n\ni do 85 to 90 all the time in the harbour tunnel and never ever get fined. however a mate of mine was doing 92 and got a ticket. so im guessing the speed camera's are set to go off anything above 90kph.\n\ncyber_scriber\n\n1 AYC Bar\n\nLocation\n\nNSW\n\nFirst Name\n\nBruce\n\nDrive\n\n2000 Galant; metallic dark blue; manual; Recaros; Momo steering wheel; and sunroof!\n\nSep 25, 2010\n\n#13\n\nDon't forget Tom that even though your speedo might be showing 90, your actual speed is likely to be lower than that.\n\nManufacturers generally build in a bit of a tolerance into the speedo so that it shows higher than actual speed.\n\nking_panther\n\nGettin' tanked\n\nLocation\n\nNew South Wales\n\nFirst Name\n\nBrad\n\nDrive\n\n2012 VW Caddy 1.6TDI 7-Speed DSG.
