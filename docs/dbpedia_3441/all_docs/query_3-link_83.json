        "text": "12 March 2024\n\nBy Hannah Wilcox\n\nA night out on the town may become that little bit more costly with the Harbour Bridge at risk of becoming a two-way toll road.\n\nIt comes following the findings of an independent review of Sydney’s toll system by former ACCC chair Allan Fels and former Victorian consumer affairs chief David Cousins.\n\nHigh numbers of commuters are opting to take toll-free routes over the paid options, it found, recording as much as a 20 percent traffic volume difference during peak hours.\n\nThe recommendations would see a “reset” of the network with the city’s toll burden – estimated to cost drivers $123bn over the next 37 years – shifting predominantly from the west to the eastern and northern suburbs.\n\nIncreased revenue from two-way tolls on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Tunnel, as well as the Eastern Distributor, would not only make things fairer but also add revenue to be redistributed to help lower charges elsewhere.\n\nTwo-way charging on the Harbour Bridge was a smart move to reduce car traffic moving through the Sydney CBD, Committee for Sydney transport policy manager Harri Bancroft told the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n“At the moment, it’s cheaper for people to drive back and forth to the city during peak periods, than catching the train or bus,” he said.\n\nTraffic congestion and flow management will continue to become more complex as toll road networks expand, including the commencement of the Western Harbour Tunnel, the review said.\n\n“Two-way tolling on all parts of the network is necessary if uniformity and consistency is to apply,” the review said.\n\nTolls were introduced on the Bridge crossing southbound into the city in July 1970.\n\nIn October last year, they were hiked up for the first time in 14 years – from $4 during peak times, $3 off-peak and $2.50 at night to $4.27 in peak, $3.20 off peak and $2.67 at night.\n\nThis was reportedly to target toll inequity with many coming from Western Sydney being slammed with consistent price hikes and road privatisation.\n\n“The NSW Government believes it is appropriate for these tolls to be adjusted higher at a time when we are focused on providing greater equity across the toll road network, no matter what your postcode,” Minister for Roads John Graham said at the time.\n\n“Drivers in Western Sydney who have little choice but to use motorways for their commute and family travel have endured annual – and in many cases quarterly – toll increases since 2009 while the Bridge and Tunnel tolls remained fixed.”\n\nThe review did outline concerns that introducing two-way tolling on the Bridge crossing may interfere with current concession agreements.\n\nA final report including an implementation plan will be completed in about six months."
