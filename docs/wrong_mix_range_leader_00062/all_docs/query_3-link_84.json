To prevent further lies occurring in the telling of history, the author provides helpful hints: writers must reflect upon the source in order to extract the truth from it.

As well, the author suggests that the scope of history should be enlarged {attribution Wellesley Index}.\n\n“WELD’S HISTORY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY.” Fraser’s Magazine, 38, no. 224: (August 1848): [129]-137.\n\nThe reviewer thinks that Charles Richard Weld’s book is much needed (published J.
