        "text": "After reviewing a few animes, I thought I’d go back to reviewing a movie or two. You know, for variety.\n\nSynopsis and spoiler-free section:\n\nHere I am with another film from Wong Kar-wai. Fallen Angels (Chinese: 墮落天使), released in 1995, is a “loose sequel” if you will, to Chungking Express. Although it does not link to the stories of Chunking Express, it started out as the “third story” to Chungking Express – but as you can tell, it ultimately became it’s own story instead of being attached to Chungking Express. It still however follows a similar style (of camera work, editing, and overall cinematography) and themes.\n\nAnyway, enough about that – Fallen Angels follows two main stories; the first story is about Leon Lai’s character, Wong Chi-ming, a disillusioned and tired killer-for-hire, who is contemplating leaving the business, and therefore leaving his partner. His partner/agent (who remains unnamed for the entirety of the movie), played by Michelle Reis, wrestles with her feelings about his wants, and her own feelings about him. They had been partners in crime (literally) for a long time now, and possibility of change creates instability in both of their mental states. Meanwhile, in the second story, Takeshi Kaneshiro plays He Zhiwu, a mute, who has a very busy-body, to say the least. From falling in love, to making new friends, to opening up several businesses on his own at night, Zhiwu is a sight to behold.\n\nInteresting, but alienating characters:\n\nAs with all of my favourite Wong Kar-wai films, this one has really interesting characters which really hold the story together, and is the main reason why I like this story. Needless to say, Reis’ character and Lai’s character, Wong Chi-ming, are bad-asses. They’re both emotionally-detached, cool-headed, and usually logical thinkers. They’re the definition of “cool”, clad in their nonchalantly fashionable outfits and smoking their cigarettes. Kaneshiro’s character, Zhiwu, is not as “cool”, but he is so dynamic and fun, and honestly makes for the most amusing scenes in the movie. His parts are definitely the funniest parts of the movie.\n\nBut the things that make them so intriguing as characters also make the characters very unrelatable. Chi-ming, is struggling with issues that we (hopefully) have never experienced. We can sympathize with him, but we don’t feel the weight of his decisions and his thoughts. Reis’ character is just ineffably cool and sexy. Her edginess, her ability to create such an impenetrable front for her feelings, her beauty – it’s a great look and a great personification of a fantasy female character, but really not relatable for most people (if she is relatable to you then you have to teach me your skills). This really leaves Zhiwu to be the most relatable, which is ridiculous, because he is ridiculous. But Zhiwu, like a lot of us, just wants to be socially accepted. I’m sure we’ve all felt that we were once a little overbearing, a little socially awkward, and that we were unable to take social cues. Zhiwu just… takes it more over the top than most people.\n\nMood and style of the film:\n\nI don’t want to talk about Chungking Express too much because I already have a review for that (here, by the way), but I don’t think you can get away from it when talking about the style of Fallen Angels. Right off the bat, if you’ve seen Chungking Express, I think it’s pretty obvious that the style of this film is very similar. The way they filtered and colour matched this film is very similar, and creates a similar mood as Chungking Express because of it. For those of you who haven’t watch Chungking Express, I’m talking about the greenish-blue tone of this movie, that gives the film an overall look of “coolness” (in respect to colour). Mood wise, it gives the film this kind of grungy vibe without seeming dated.\n\nHowever, I think Fallen Angels experimented with these elements more than Chungking Express. In Fallen Angels, you will notice a lot playing with the angle of the shots, and also a lot of playing with the fish-eye effect, probably to illustrate the confusion and mood of the characters. There was also some playing with flashbacks, which provided an interesting look into the pasts of our mysterious characters. I think they were also a lot more adventurous with the locations in this movie, and even had some scenic shots here and there. I would describe the overall mood of this film to be the feeling of yearning for romance. This feeling of yearning and loneliness is helped by the main song of the soundtrack,\n\nMusic and sound:\n\n(I’m only going to talk about this a bit because the review is already running a little long.) Fallen Angels makes good use of the everyday background noises (ie: the sound of the TV on in the background) and movement noises (ie: heels clicking on the ground), and it gives the world in the movie a very organic feeling to it. There are some very awesome songs they used in this movie that was great for creating the mood and for engagement – but for brevity’s sake, the most notable song used was “Forget Him” by Shirley Kwan. This illustrates the heart-wrenching aftermath of a broken relationship, and is used again and again in this movie. It goes amazingly well with the theme.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nObviously, this is recommended for people who really liked Chungking Express. They’re by no means the same movie, but they have similar elements that are very complementary to each other. What you SHOULDN’T do is compare this movie to Chungking Express, because I struggled with formulating a real opinion on this movie for a long time due to that. That being said, even if you haven’t watched Chungking Express, you should definitely check this movie out. I don’t know which one I could recommend to watch first (I watched Chungking Express first) but it ultimately doesn’t matter since they’re not linked. Fallen Angels has very intriguing characters and interesting premises, and is very good at evoking mood. It is an unconventional love story, that focuses more on the character in love than progressing the romance.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend this for people who want something that is very plot driven. There is some advancement in plot in this story – but that’s not the main goal of this movie. I feel like the main goal is more to create mood and to tell interesting anecdotes about the character’s life. There’s a lot of attention focused on camera work and the little movements of out characters that ultimately don’t add to the progression of the story, and is only to develop the theme or the characters.\n\nIn-depth analysis (spoilers ahead):\n\nScroll down to TLDR section for the ratings and summary!\n\nFavourite story line:\n\nAs with my Chungking Express review (I know, I know, I keep referencing that movie… It’s hard not to!) I will discuss which of the two story lines is my favourite. It’s a little bit harder, because Fallen Angels connects the two stories a lot more than Chungking Express, which is a quality of Fallen Angels that I really like. Both of these stories are so unique, in different ways. Although it isn’t uncommon to have a story like the first story, the story of the two criminals who struggle with their relationship, I think Fallen Angels does a really good job with it. I liked how this movie focused on the individual character’s struggles with their feelings instead of trying to work towards progressing them as a couple – because that just isn’t a smart move, especially for people in their profession. The plot isn’t special, but the way they go about it is. This could have been another super cheesy movie where the characters just go like “But I need you…” and such, until they make love and ride off into the sunset together. Despite me saying that their characters aren’t relatable, they’re oddly realistic and true to their personalities.\n\nThe second story, as I stated above, is just a lot more funny. Zhiwu is the quirkiest of the quirky. I didn’t care much for his romance parts, but I loved watching his attempts to “bump shoulders” with the people that he met. He was so lovable to watch – but maybe not so lovable to meet (I sure wouldn’t want to be force-fed soft serve ice cream… or… huh.) He went through so many phases in the amount of screen time he had. My favourite phase of his, and the phase that resulted in my favourite scene of the movie, is his video taping scene. My favourite scene of the movie was when Zhiwu sits alone in his apartment, watching a taped video of his dad cooking. Damn near broke my heart :'(.\n\nSo, if I had to choose between the two story lines, I liked the second story line more. In a movie chiefly about creating good characters, I liked Zhiwu as the character the most.\n\nTLDR; and ratings:\n\nRecommended for: People who liked Chungking Express, people who pay attention to cinematography in a movie, people who like good character building\n\nNot recommended for: People who like plot driven story lines, people who don’t care for A LOT of attention to detail in films\n\nVisuals: 8/10 – Love the style of this film, obviously. The visuals add a lot to the entire mood of the film. This film does a lot of interesting things with the camera to compliment and convey the feelings of the characters.\n\nSound: 8/10 – Great, great soundtrack and great usage of everyday noises to great an organic vibe from this not so entirely “true to life” movie. The music really helped to tie this movie together.\n\nOverall enjoyment: 8/10 – This movie is filled with intriguing and odd characters. While the premise seems entirely fictional, Fallen Angels still somehow feels realistic. It’s a lovely film to watch stylistically, and it has a very good soundtrack that helps breath realism into this movie. And although the characters aren’t very relatable, that doesn’t stop them from being very amusing to watch.\n\nAnother Wong Kar-wai film review… there will be many to come. I believe this is the first Wong Kar-wai film I’ve ever watched. Here’s my review:\n\nSynopsis and spoiler-free review portion:\n\nWong kar-wai’s Chungking Express (Chinese: 重慶森林 chung hing sam lam) follows two storylines, both revolving around heartbroken policemen. The first one, starring Takeshi Kaneshiro as the happy-go-lucky He Qi-wu, and also known as Cop 223. Qi-wu’s girlfriend, named May, recently broke up with him, a month before his birthday (May 1st). He resolves to eat a can of pineapples everyday before his birthday – and if he is able to complete this task, he will take it as a sign that he will be able to get over his ex. During his month of heartbreak, by chance, he encounters the unnamed “Woman in the Blonde Wig” (played by Brigitte Lin). We get to see her own story, which includes a run-in with the law.\n\nThe second story in Chungking Express follows our protagonists Faye (played by Faye Wong) and Cop 663 (played by Tony Leung Chiu-wai). After 663’s recent breakup, he finds himself frequenting a fast-food Chinese food stand, “Chungking Express”, where Faye has been newly hired. Because of their reoccurring encounters, they eventually form an unlikely friendship.\n\nWhy I love this movie so much and why you should watch it even though I know you won’t:\n\nYeah so this review is going to be a little bias. Very bias. I love how a lot of HK films have this really indie feel to it – but a lot of them that I’ve watched aren’t really… that good. A lot of them have good things about them, but overall, the majority of HK films that I have seen weren’t “good” in my eyes. Maybe I’ve just been looking in the wrong place (feel free to leave suggestions). But a good place to look is in this film.\n\nFirst off, I loved every single main character in this film. They all had these very endearing quirks about them that made me love them a lot. I felt that there was a lot of attention to details about the characters’ personalities that really stuck with me after the film, and a lot of small things that just makes you really remember a film. This includes the pineapple eating thing that Qi-wu does, as mentioned above, why Lin’s character wears the blonde wig, etc.\n\nI love the dialogue in this film. Whether it’s narration or conversation (to other people, to themselves), the conversations were often really interesting and really funny. I don’t really know how to describe the type of funny I think it is though – it’s definitely not a really outrageous, shocking type of funny. It’s more like a chuckling type of funny. I don’t know – they warm my heart and they’re interesting. The chemistry between the characters are really good as well. Were they ever not friends? Who knows?\n\nRecommended for:\n\nI really love this movie, but I don’t think it’s for everyone. It’s similar to American indie films, in how some people just won’t like it because they don’t see the point in it. My brother’s friend described indie films to be like “two people pointing guns at each other for an hour and a half until someone finally pulls the trigger in the last two minutes of the film.” That’s fine – it’s not for everyone. But I think because it’s split into to halves, even people who struggle to see the point in indie films might be able to get into this. I would still say that it’s “exciting”, but not in the traditional way that American films are exciting if you get what I mean. There’s action – but this is by no means an action movie. There’s romance – but your heart isn’t going to be beating for the characters to fall in love and make out and such. It’s a very unconventional romance film, but I’d consider the characters to be quite “romantic”.\n\nIt’s an interesting film with intriguing characters, but don’t expect any really overwhelming emotions to bubble up as you watch it. I’d recommend it for anyone who can really fall in love with characters, and for anyone who can get sucked into interesting dialogues (maybe think Tarantino for the type of dialogues?) I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who only enjoys really epic movies. A lot of the things that are great about it are also really understated.\n\nSpecific scene analyses (spoiler alert!):\n\nJust go watch the movie so that you can read this section already! Scroll down to the bottom for TLDR;\n\nWhich did I like better? Story one or story two?\n\nWell, it’s hard to choose.\n\nI thought storyline one was more original. I really, really, REALLY love the pineapple thing that Qi-wu was doing to get over his heartbreak. It was just really… adorable, being fixated on pineapples as a cure for heartbreak, of all things. Qi-wu was my favourite character in this film too – I’m sure he’s a lot of people’s favourite though, for those who have watched it. He’s always smiling, despite being so hurt. His phone calls to his other ex-girlfriends were hilarious as well. He has a lot of great quirks.\n\nWhat was happening with Lin’s character as a part of story one was really compelling as well. It offset nicely with Qi-wu’s happy-go-lucky personality. It’s also funny that he’s hanging out with her since he’s a cop. Her story alone fulfills the “action” part of the film very well. I found myself really fixated on her part of the story as well as Qi-wu’s, though I liked Qi-wu as a character more. Her part of the story added the most “uniqueness” in terms of visuals for the film, with the shaky camera movements trailing her. It’s a great opening to the film, as it really draws you into it, following her through such a shady area.\n\nBut I also really loved story two, because I loved the chemistry between 663 and Faye. It’s kind of a weird chemistry though. No one gets quirkier than Faye – she breaks into his apartment to clean. Who does that? And poor 663 is so heartbroken, he doesn’t even notice. Their whole relationship is just odd. I don’t know why 663 was just cool with it after – he’s a cop and someone broke into his home.\n\nAs I said before, I really loved the whole bit where 663 talks to his stuffed animals and other non-living objects. My “chuckles” turned really obnoxious while I was watching these parts. Aside from the pineapples, this was my favourite bit from the movie.\n\nSo which do I like more? It’s so hard to choose. Through the first time watching it, I was more excited for the first story, but I think I liked the second story more, because I just loved the chemistry between the protagonists, and I loved the romantic quality of it nearing the end. Objectively though, I think the first one is better because it’s more compelling as a story. Qi-wu wins as the best character.\n\nVisual style (and also the score which I never really talk about):\n\nStylistically, I felt this film was really strong for creating a clear image of what Wong Kar-wai’s films are kind of like to me – both with the visuals and with the score. The song which they first play as Lin’s character rushes through the alleyways of Hong Kong creates a great sense urgency at the beginning, that really captivates you right off the bat. The reoccurring playing of “California Dreaming” by The Mamas and the Papas as Faye danced to it in the second story helped cement Faye’s character really well. In addition, I just like the whole colour tone of this film.\n\nTLDR;\n\nRecommended for: People looking for an unconventional romance movie, people who like indie films, people looking for a movie with great characters and memorable quirks\n\nNot recommended for: People who like really epic or lovey dovey romances, people who really, really, really can’t survive without COMPLETE closure.\n\nVisuals: 8/10 – The visuals of this film wasn’t anything too crazy, but they were really good at creating a style unique to Wong Kar-wai. The visuals matched really perfectly with the score.\n\nStory: 9/10 – They were just absolutely compelling to me. I can’t really explain them here without giving too much away though.\n\nOverall enjoyment: 9.5/10 – Yeah this probably seems too high to most people, but I LOVE Chungking Express. It’s my second favourite Wong Kar-wai film, or possibly my first (don’t make me get into this argument with myself right now please). The characters and all of their quirks made this film so loveable to me.\n\nAlso, for those of you who have watched the movie but haven’t seen this, Quentin Taratino gives a great talk about Chungking Express.\n\nHello folks!\n\nThis will be my first ever movie “review” (not intended to be taken very seriously in any way). It is of one of my favourite films, which I had just re-watched yesterday so it’s still fresh in my memory. I hope my review can do it some justice (though I doubt it). If you don’t want to read everything and you are just here for the final verdict, go down to the TLDR; at the bottom.\n\nSynopsis and spoiler-free analysis portion:\n\nIn the Mood for Love (Chinese: 花樣年華) is a HK film directed by one of my favourite directors, Wong Kar-wai. The movie is set in Hong Kong in the sixties, and it stars Maggie Cheung as Mrs. Chan, and Tony Leung Chiu-wai as Chow Mo-wan (also known as Mr. Chow). Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow move in next door to each other in the same apartment building; they soon discover that their spouses have been cheating on them with each other (Chow’s wife with Mrs. Chan’s husband), and they start to develop a platonic friendship through this development. It is a widely acclaimed film (though I don’t know anyone who has watched it other than my parents) and it is considered to be one of Wong Kar-wai’s best, and most visually beautiful films.\n\nA visually beautiful film\n\nFirst, I would just like to point out how much I love the Chinese title: 花樣年華 (pronounced fa yeung nin wa in Cantonese), which, literally, means something like “the time that the flowers are in full bloom”. There is just something so romantic about that title – and I think it represents the film better than the English title does (though the English title isn’t bad either). Like the Chinese title suggests, this film is a visually stunning masterpiece – without the help of crazy CGI and whatnot. From the smoke coming from Mr. Chow’s cigarettes as he smokes alone, to the various beautiful, floral patterned qipao (旗袍 – kei po in Cantonese), the traditional Chinese dresses that Mrs. Chan wears throughout the movie – all come together to create a beautiful film.\n\nMaggie Cheung has never looked more beautiful – I guarantee that during the time that you are watching this film, you cannot think of any woman more beautiful than her as Mrs. Chan. But it wasn’t just her clothes and her makeup and her hair that made her that way, but Cheung portrayed her perfectly. From the way Mrs. Chan carried herself – in her posture, in her stride, in her facial expression – was really true to her character, a refined and restrained, professional and elegant woman who is unhappy with her marriage. Tony Leung Chiu-wai also embodied Mr. Chow pretty perfectly too – as a handsome, soft-spoken, lonely, and self-contained newspaper writer. The chemistry developed between these two characters was fascinating to watch, and very realistic (more on that below). The way they share their loneliness, pain, and anxiety together, their subtle flirting and courting, the way they talk to each other with their eyes… I can honestly watch their interactions forever. If you like Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, I think you’d really enjoy this movie. These characters they portray are at the height of being “subtly cool” and infinitely romantic.\n\nRecommended for:\n\nIf you’re thinking about watching this film, I would definitely recommend it to you if you like films that are really focused on visual aspects – through sets, costumes, camera, and of course acting. It has a great score as well, that really highlights the loneliness of the characters and the longing between our protagonists. I will say the film progresses a little slow though, especially if you’re looking for a movie with a lot of passionate make-outs and a lot of sex; the title might suggest that there there will be a lot of amorous activities acted out in the movie – there won’t be. The beauty of the storytelling lies with the subtly of the acting.\n\nLonger analysis (SPOILERS AHEAD!):\n\nYou have been warned. Scroll down to the ratings and TLDR; if you don’t want to see this! These will be analyses of specific scenes.\n\nThe chemistry between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow:\n\nLike I’ve mentioned before, if you were reading the entire time, the chemistry between Mrs. Chan and Mr. Chow is incredible and believable. They don’t talk a lot in the film – at least not compared to what I’m used to seeing. It’s not a film where the man comes up with an endless amount of witty lines to charm the woman, or where the woman’s enchanting personality captivates the man like no other beauty before her could (you know which movies I’m referring to…). It’s a film that starts off with a man and a woman, neighbours, wanting to be platonic friends. But as the film progresses, it becomes clearer and clearer that they aren’t simply friends. We are first made aware of this when Mr. Chow says the magical “hook-up” words, “Let’s not go home tonight” or “Let’s stay out tonight” (depending on what your translated version says); it is only seconds later that we realize they are reenacting a scene. As we move through the movie, we see Mr. Chow longing for Mrs. Chan more and more, and she eventually starts developing feelings for Mr. Chow as well.\n\nLonging – that’s the word for it. Long shots of Mr. Chow staring at Mrs. Chan as she broods over how she feels about this awkward situation that they’ve found themselves in with each other’s spouses; and she eventually broods about their own relationship. Long shots of Mr. Chow inching towards Mrs. Chan’s hand as they ride a taxi together, only to have her pull away, until finally, in their last car ride together, she holds his hand back. Their implied amorous activities finally release the sexual tension that is in the air between the two, but the longing doesn’t end their; we carry it until the end of the film (and beyond, for me) of wanting more, but never receiving. It really does create the “mood” of love, as we succumb to the pain of an unrequited relationship. It’s not even happening to us, yet we feel the pain as they do.\n\nA visually beautiful film (part 2):\n\nThere are many notable visually stunning scenes here – my favourite is the one where Mrs. Chan rushes to the hotel where Mr. Chow is staying to write his story. She is wearing a white qipao with a black flower pattern, with a red coat over top. The contrast between the eye-catching red coat and the muted qipao alone is already so beautiful. But even more so is the way the camera follows Mrs. Chan up and down the stairs and through the corridors as she makes the decision to go to – or to bail on – Mr. Chow’s invitation. Her motions and emotions are frantic and afraid and uncertain and it made the audience (or me at least) feel the same. Flashing between the hotel structure and herself, the camera is barely able to follow up with Mrs. Chan’s movements – it is only when Mr. Chan opens the door to greet her do we feel release. Now that is storytelling by the camera done right.\n\nAnother scene which I’m sure a lot of people found really stunning was the final scene where Mr. Chow is in Cambodia, and he is talking into the hole. Long shots of the canyons and rocks are seen against a blue sky. Lovely, yes, and really the only “picturesque” landscape scene we get from the movie. However, I’m not a complete fan of this – I agree it’s beautiful, but for some kind of reason it doesn’t sit well with me against the rest of the film. It doensn’t look like it fits the sixties era very well… which the rest of the film excels at. It really does illuminate Mr. Chow’s loneliness though.\n\nFavourite scene(s):\n\nThere are so many good scenes in this movie. One of my favourites is the scene where Mr. Chow first calls Mrs. Chan to “consult with her about his wife’s birthday present.” They play innocent as they talk to each other, each of them trying to get information from each other, each of them trying to say things without saying anything. It was really clever – and the second time around watching it, I picked up on some things prior to this scene that adds to this scene (like when Mrs. Chan asks her husband to buy two of the same handbags for her boss – one for his mistress and one for his wife).\n\nAnother thing I loved was their reoccurring “bit” to act out hypothetical situations, the first one being the scene where Mr. Chow suggests, “Let’s not go home tonight.” They then go on to reenact Mrs. Chan asking her husband if he has a mistress, and also to her reacting to Mr. Chow leaving to Singapore. I thought all of these were so funny – especially after the first time watching it, when I finally realized they were joking.\n\nTLDR;\n\nRecommended for: People who like art films, fans of Wong Kar-wai, Maggie Cheung, or Tony Leung Chiu-wai, and the romantics\n\nNOT recommended for: People who can’t stand subtly or “implied” actions, people who are looking for a lot of passion and making out and sex, people with little patience (the pacing is a little slow, and I can see it being a turn off for people who can’t deal with that), and people looking for a standard Hollywood rom-com\n\nRATINGS:\n\nVisuals: 10/10 – Truly a beautiful movie. I want to own all of Mrs. Chan’s qipaos. The camera was great at assisting with the subtle visual storytelling, where the dialogue was missing.\n\nStory: 9/10 – I think it’s a pretty good romance story, but the first time watching it, I found that it kind of lacked closure. I’m okay now. I felt that it was INCREDIBLE at evoking mood.\n\nOverall enjoyment: 10/10 – It wasn’t a 10/10 the first time I watched it (close, but it wasn’t) but I couldn’t get it out of my head. And the more I thought about it, the more I loved it. And it’s a 10/10 now. Even if you don’t know Cantonese and are only relying on subtitles (I will say that some of the subtitles in my version were not completely sufficient in terms of creating a sense of character through the dialogue) it’s still a really good watch if you’re looking for a mood-evoking, visually stunning romance film.\n\nEXTRAS: Found this super funny clip on Critereon about a dancing scene that was filmed but cut from the movie. It is my new favourite thing:\n\nhttps://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2499-in-the-mood-for-dancing"
