        "text": "Colin Corcoran is a first-year M.A. student in the Social-Organizational Psychology program. Before attending Teachers College - Columbia University, he ran his own residential interior design studio. While working as an interior designer, Colin discovered a passion for understanding human behavior. A drive to understand his clients on a deeper level allowed Colin to interpret their needs in the context of creating beautiful and uniquely functional spaces that improved the way his clients lived their lives. Through his human-centered interior design work, Colin learned how to navigate family organizations, the dynamics of couples' relationships, and other intimate parts of human life, including religion, race, and culture.\n\nColin's passion for interpreting people motivated deeper learning and the pursuit of a new career path. The S-OP MA program at TC was an ideal opportunity for Colin to use his experience within a dynamic learning community to gain the skills needed to effect real change in organizations and society. With a deep understanding of human behavior and continued experiential learning, Colin is confident that he will be able to co-create individualized organization change capable of fostering new ways for people to work, produce and impact our global community.\n\nColin began an internship this spring with Veldhoen + Company, a leading international consultancy specializing in integrated workplace strategy, using the philosophy they founded called Activity Based Working. Veldhoen uses a holistic approach to organization change to foster new ways of working capable of having a global impact by transforming how we all work. Veldhoen's integrated approach believes physical space is a crucial element of whole organization change. Colin will use his experience as an interior designer to bring value to Veldhoen while simultaneously applying his new knowledge from TC and gaining ongoing experiential learning.\n\nEventually, Colin aspires to be a catalyst for impactful change in the organizations within our society. His ultimate goal is to work and support change leaders in organizations to develop diverse, equitable, and inclusive environments focused on meeting all organization members' needs. Colin believes that a holistic, integrated, and strategic approach to change that prioritizes individual and collective needs is the strongest way for organizations to achieve their goals.\n\nRosaimy (Rosy) Grady is a student in the Social-Organizational Psychology Master of Arts Program and a member of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) at West Point.

After working in the financial industry, Michelle moved home to Ohio where she helped manage her family business for a few years. It was there that she realized her passion for organizational psychology and decided to pursue her master’s degree in the field.\n\nMichelle enjoys her time as a full-time student making new friends and learning more in-depth theories that she can put to practice. During the summer of 2020, Michelle interned at PwC as a summer senior associate where she was able to implement theories she learned from TC as practical solutions for clients.

After obtaining her B.S. in Psychology and Theology from Fordham University in 2021, Mia started her professional career at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as a clinical research coordinator in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences working on meaning-centered research studies. With a desire to expand meaning-centered research and application, Mia began exploring ways that purpose could be found on a broader scale in the workplace. This led her to the study of organizational psychology, entering the S-OP program with a strong interest in leadership research and eager to explore the impact that good leaders can have on their employees' ability to find meaning in their work. This past summer and going into the fall, Mia is interning at Summit Leadership Partners, a management consulting firm that focuses on leadership advisory.\n\nMia is excited to start her role as the incoming president of the Organization and Human Development Consulting Club (OHDCC), a student-run club that supports the S-OP program, promoting professional development, networking and community building at TC.

Since 2020, Jessica has worked at Insight Partners, where she spent her first two years running lateral recruiting for the firm, and she now sits in a Human Capital Business Partner seat. During her first few months at Insight Partners, she realized that she wanted to attend the MA program in an effort to enhance her knowledge and skills, and to bring change and transformation to her organization. Jessica is particularly passionate about bringing systemic change to organizations to help them transform their DEI strategies and to help emerging leaders uncover their potential through behavioral change. Coaching is a potential career path that Jessica is interested in upon graduating from Teachers College.\n\nAs a mixed-race woman who has operated in predominantly white spaces for her entire academic and professional career, Jessica has seen first-hand how institutions and organizations can be inherently biased. In an effort to make an impact on others' experiences navigating from academic spaces to professional ones, she has been dedicated to supporting underserved communities by working with The Waterside School, a co-educational PK-5th Grade independent school in Stamford, CT that serves children and families regardless of limitations in income or circumstance. Jessica spends her time with the school helping alumni, many of whom are first-generation college students, to secure summer internships to jump start their careers.\n\nOutside of school and work, Jessica enjoys spending time with friends and family, getting lost in new neighborhoods and exploring the restaurant scene in New York City, trying new recipes, and planning her wedding with her fiancé.\n\nPlease feel free to connect with Jessica on LinkedIn.\n\nCaitlin Kingston is a second year M.A. student in the Social-Organizational Psychology program.

Underlying all of this is a deep commitment to advancing DEI and social justice, which she seeks to weave into all of her work and studies.\n\nCaitlin and her husband moved to New York from Austin, TX for Caitlin to participate in the S-OP program.
