        "text": "Since they decided to spend the rest of their lives together, Janice’s husband has played an important role in both her personal and professional life.\n\nJanice Man, who was born on December 29, 1988, is a well-known Hong Kong actress and model. Due to her exceptional beauty and talent, she has landed important roles in several mainland Chinese and Hong Kong film projects.\n\nHis film and television credits include “The Graduate Song,” “Helios,” “Cold War 2,” “Nightfall” and “The Midnight After,” as well as “The Legend of Zu.” Janice’s undeniable charm and talent continue to enchant audiences and fashion fans alike as she smoothly alternates between film and fashion.\n\nShe was named best dressed at the 30th Hong Kong Film Awards in 2011. In 2011, she was the face of Dr. Kits Hong Kong, and from 2013 to 2014, she was the face of SK-II Facial Treatment Essence. In 2015, Janice also sponsored the Adidas Hong Kong winter jacket. She has represented Bausch & Lomb’s Lacelle Series since 2011 and is also a spokesperson for IPSA and Forevermark Diamonds.\n\nThe career of Janice’s husband, Carl Ng\n\nJanice Man is a popular Hong Kong actress and model. In September 2019, she married her long-time boyfriend Carl Ng in a lavish wedding. After five years of growing devotion, the couple chose Lake Como, Italy, as the location for their spectacular wedding. Carl Ng, a wealthy family scion and dedicated financial practitioner, is said to be valued at more than HKD 100 million.\n\nJanice’s enthusiasm and dedication to her career is unaffected by their combined wealth. She continued to work in the entertainment industry after getting married, usually traveling between China and Hong Kong for filming.\n\nJanice has been cautious in the face of global health concerns and has chosen to take vacations and settle primarily in Hong Kong to avoid viral dangers. Despite the wealth that surrounds them, the couple’s genuine happiness and mutual respect shine through.\n\nThey symbolize a modern partnership in which both spouses value their work while building a life full of love, understanding and support for each other, regardless of financial circumstances. Beyond the glitz and glamour, it’s clear that their bond is strong and lasting.\n\nDoes Janice Man have children?\n\nJanice Man and her husband, Carl Ng, have made significant contributions to their industries. Their dedication and hard work are reflected in the advancements they have made in their fields. Due to the obligations and dynamic nature of their jobs, they have chosen not to embark on the journey of becoming parents.\n\nAlthough the couple does not rule out the possibility of having children in the future, they are more concerned about their professional goals and the quality time they spend together. Every person or couple has their own timeline, and for Janice and Carl, the present moment is about appreciating their love and work. Your decision reflects your shared understanding and consideration.\n\nJanice Man’s childhood\n\nJanice Man, who was born in British Hong Kong on December 29, 1988, catapulted to fame at a young age. She began her career as a professional model at the age of 14 after talent scouts spotted her on the busy streets of Hong Kong. Her career took a turn in 2007, when she entered television with series and showed her acting ability in films like “Love Is Not All Around.”\n\nHis burgeoning fame was further solidified in 2009, when he acquired a contract with A-Music, Leon Lai’s prominent artist management agency. He later performed at events such as Hong Kong’s Asia Exhibit and Summer Pop Live, cementing his place in the entertainment industry."
