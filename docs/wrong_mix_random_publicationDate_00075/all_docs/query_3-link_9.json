As a father, I need to protect my family by not exposing them to the public eye.\"\n\n\"As for our future, only time will tell.\"\n\n[embed]https://www.facebook.com/llleonlai/posts/1972423233010925[/embed]\n\nLai was reported to be dating 32-year-old Wing Chan who works as a sales manager in his record label Amusic.\n\nSpeculations of him becoming a dad surfaced after Chan was spotted with a baby bump.\n\nShe has now cut down on work to rest at home - a HKD60 million (S$10 million) mansion in Hong Kong's New Territories that she shares with Lai, Oriental Sunday reported.\n\nAccording to Apple Daily Hong Kong, she is expecting a baby girl who is due in May.\n\nChan has been said to bear a resemblance to Lai's ex-wife Gaile Lok. They parted ways in 2012 after a four-year marriage. The model wed businessman Ian Chu last year.\n\nWith a baby on the way, we wonder when wedding bells will ring for Leon Lai.\n\nminlee@sph.com.sg"
