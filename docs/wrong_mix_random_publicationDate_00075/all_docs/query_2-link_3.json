        "text": "Borough in Bergen County, New Jersey, US\n\nFor the 1970s television series, see Tenafly (TV series).\n\nBorough in New Jersey\n\nTenafly ( ) is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough's population was 15,409,[10][11] an increase of 921 (+6.4%) from the 2010 census count of 14,488,[20][21] which in turn reflected an increase of 682 (+4.9%) from the 13,806 counted in the 2000 census.[22] Tenafly is a suburb of New York City.\n\nThe first European settlers in Tenafly were Dutch immigrants, who began to populate the area during the late 17th century. The name \"Tenafly\" is of Dutch language origin. Some historical references cite a Dutch language connection to its location on or at \"a meadow.\"[23][24][25] Other derivations cite the early-modern Dutch phrase \"Tiene Vly\" or \"Ten Swamps\" which was given by Dutch settlers in 1688.[26][27]\n\nThe borough has been one of the state's highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Tenafly residents had a median household income of $153,381, ranked 13th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.[28]\n\nTenafly was incorporated as a borough on January 24, 1894, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of the now-defunct Palisades Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day.[29][30] The borough was the first formed during the \"Boroughitis\" phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.[31] Portions of Palisades Township were acquired based on legislation approved on April 8, 1897.[29][32]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.16 square miles (13.38 km2), including 4.59 square miles (11.88 km2) of land and 0.58 square miles (1.50 km2) of water (11.20%).[1][2]\n\nThe borough borders the municipalities of Alpine, Bergenfield, Cresskill, Englewood and Englewood Cliffs in Bergen County, as well as the Bronx in New York City across the Hudson River.[33][34][35]\n\nTenafly's street plan and overall development were largely determined by its hills and valleys. The eastern part of the borough is referred to as the \"East Hill\" for its higher elevation in relation to the rest of the borough. There, the terrain rises dramatically to the east of the downtown area, terminating at the New Jersey Palisades, overlooking the Hudson River. Nearby is the Tenafly Nature Center, located at 313 Hudson Avenue.[36]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18801,019—18901,0462.6%19001,74666.9%19102,75657.8%19203,58530.1%19305,66958.1%19407,41330.8%19509,65130.2%196014,26447.8%197014,8273.9%198013,552−8.6%199013,326−1.7%200013,8063.6%201014,4884.9%202015,4096.4%2023 (est.)15,178[10][12]−1.5%\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 14,488 people, 4,766 households, and 3,956 families in the borough. The population density was 3,148.6 per square mile (1,215.7/km2). There were 4,980 housing units at an average density of 1,082.3 per square mile (417.9/km2).

About 1.8% of families and 2.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 1.4% of those under age 18 and 2.2% of those age 65 or over.[45]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States census[17] there were 13,806 people, 4,774 households, and 3,866 families residing in the borough. The population density was 2,993.4 inhabitants per square mile (1,155.8/km2). There were 4,897 housing units at an average density of 1,061.8 per square mile (410.0/km2).

This charter retains most aspects of the borough form of government, with the addition of initiative, referendum, and recall features.[47] The borough is one of 11 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use a state-granted special charter.[48][49] The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office, and is eligible for re-election. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.[7] As the legislative body, the borough council adopts ordinances and resolutions, decides on appropriations, approves appointments made by the mayor, determines policy, and establishes the functions of the various departments of the local government. Each council member is chairperson of one of six standing committees. The mayor presides over council meetings, but only votes in case of a tie, and can cast a veto which can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the council.[50]\n\nAs of 2023 , the mayor of Tenafly is Democrat Mark Zinna, whose term ends on December 31, 2023.[3] Members of the Tenafly Borough Council are Lauren M. Dayton (D, 2023), Jeffrey D. Grossman (D, 2023), Venugopal Menon (D, 2024), Adam Michaels (D, 2025), Julie O'Connor (D, 2024) and Daniel Park (D, 2025).[50][51][52][53][54][55][56]\n\nIn January 2020, the borough council appointed Julie O'Connor to fill the remainder of the term expiring in December 2021 that had been held by Mark Zinna until he stepped down earlier that month to take office as mayor.[57]\n\nIn 2000, the local government of Tenafly sought to ban the erection of eruvs in their community. The eruv association filed a lawsuit in response to the borough's action. After six years of litigation in the federal courts, Tenafly settled by keeping the eruvs intact and paid $325,000 of the plaintiff's legal fees.[58]\n\nTenafly is located in the 5th Congressional District[59] and is part of New Jersey's 37th state legislative district.[60][61][62]\n\nPrior to the 2010 Census, Tenafly had been part of the 5th Congressional District, a change made by the New Jersey Redistricting Commission that took effect in January 2013, based on the results of the November 2012 general elections.[63] In redistricting following the 2010 census, the borough was in the 9th congressional district, which was in effect from 2013 to 2022.[64][65]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 5th congressional district is represented by Josh Gottheimer (D, Wyckoff).[66][67] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[68] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[69][70]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 37th legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the New Jersey Senate by Gordon M. Johnson (D, Englewood) and in the General Assembly by Shama Haider (D, Tenafly) and Ellen Park (D, Englewood Cliffs).[71]\n\nBergen County is governed by a directly elected County Executive, with legislative functions performed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of seven members who are elected at-large to three-year terms in partisan elections on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each November; a Chairman and Vice Chairman are selected from among its seven members at a reorganization meeting held every January. As of 2024 , the county executive is James J. Tedesco III (D, Paramus), whose four-year term of office ends December 31, 2026.[72]\n\nBergen County's Commissioners are: Thomas J. Sullivan Jr. (D, Montvale, 2025),[73] Chair Germaine M. Ortiz (D, Emerson, 2025),[74] Joan Voss (D, Fort Lee, 2026),[75] Vice Chair Mary J. Amoroso (D, Mahwah, 2025),[76] Rafael Marte (D, Bergenfield, 2026),[77] Steven A.

The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student's home school district.[121][122]\n\nAcademy of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which operates under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark,[123] was recognized in 2012 by the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program of the United States Department of Education, one of 15 public and private schools in the state to be honored that year.[124]\n\nAs of May 2010 , the borough had a total of 64.55 miles (103.88 km) of roadways, of which 54.71 miles (88.05 km) were maintained by the municipality, 6.85 miles (11.02 km) by Bergen County, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and 1.49 miles (2.40 km) by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission.[125]\n\nCounty Route 501,[126] U.S. Route 9W and the Palisades Interstate Parkway all pass through Tenafly.\n\nThe Palisades Interstate Parkway runs above the Hudson River from Englewood Cliffs north towards Alpine.[127] There are no exits on the parkway in Tenafly; the nearest interchanges are Exit 1 in Englewood Cliffs to the south, and Exit 2 in Alpine in the north.[128]\n\nU.S. Route 9W adjoins and runs parallel to the Palisades Interstate Parkway.[129]\n\nLocal and express bus service to and from New York City is available via NJ Transit bus route 166 to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.[130][131]\n\nRockland Coaches provides services to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Routes 9/9A/9T/9TA from Stony Point, New York, and the 20/20T routes from West Nyack, New York.[132][133]\n\nFrom the mid-1850s until September 1966, Tenafly was served by rail along the Northern Branch, originally to Pavonia Terminal, and later to Hoboken Terminal. CSX now provides freight service along the line. The former Tenafly Station, currently a restaurant, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979; it is one of four surviving stations on the Northern Branch.[134]\n\nThe Northern Branch Corridor Project, a proposal by New Jersey Transit to extend the Hudson Bergen Light Rail for nine stops and 11 miles (18 km) northward from its current terminus in North Bergen to two stations in Tenafly, the last of which would be a new terminus near the Cresskill town line, met with mixed reactions.[135][136] Many residents and officials believed that the negative consequences for the borough in terms of traffic and noise outweighed the benefits.[135][137] In November 2010, voters rejected the plan to re-establish a rail service to the town by a nearly 2–1 ratio in a non-binding referendum, with all of the borough council candidates opposing the restoration of commuter train service.[138] There is continued resistance to New Jersey Transit's preferred alternative as described in the plan's December 2011 announcement.[139] Despite local opposition, officials in Bergen County asked the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority to support the proposal.[140] In 2013, New Jersey Transit announced that the line would end in Englewood, after Tenafly officials estimated that as much as $8 million in commercial property valuation would be lost and residents raised strong objections.[141]\n\nHistoric locations in Tenafly include:[142]\n\nChristie-Parsels House, 195 Jefferson Avenue.[143]\n\nCotswold Mansion, 1 Byrne Lane.\n\nDemarest-Lyle House, 91 West Clinton Avenue.\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton House, 135 Highwood Avenue, home of the women's rights activist from 1868 to 1887. Stanton unsuccessfully attempted to vote in the borough in 1880.[144]\n\nRoelof Westervelt House, 81 Westervelt Avenue.[145]\n\nSickles-Melbourne House, 48 Knoll Road.\n\nTenafly Railroad Station, 1 Piermont Road, a former railroad station that operated from the mid-1800s until 1966.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Monument, Roosevelt Common, Riveredge Road.\n\nPeople who were born in, residents of, or otherwise associated with Tenafly include:\n\nMunicipal Incorporations of the State of New Jersey (according to Counties) prepared by the Division of Local Government, Department of the Treasury (New Jersey); December 1, 1958.\n\nClayton, W.
