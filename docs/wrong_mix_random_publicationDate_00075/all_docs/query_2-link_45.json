        "text": "When some people come to the Jersey Shore, hitting the beaches may not necessarily be in their plans.\n\nPlenty of people would much rather spend their day set up by the bay instead of near the Ocean.\n\nIt has its benefits; spending a day by the bay at one of our Shore towns offers a lot to visitors; it's usually less crowded, and bay beaches don't require beach badges.\n\nAnother plus side to a bay beach is that they generally have a playground kids can play on to keep them entertained.\n\nLavallette has a nice bay beach playground and now plans are in the works for Seaside Heights to get an updated \"all-inclusive\" playground at Sunset Beach.\n\nSeaside Heights NJ's Sunset Beach To Get An Upgraded Playground\n\nShore Beat reports that the new playground that's in the works would cost roughly 750,000 dollars and would be partially covered by the State Department of Environmental Protection under Jakes Law.\n\nJakes's Law was put in place 5 years ago and is to encourage towns and counties to build more parks and playgrounds for kids.\n\nThe new Seaside Heights playground would be constructed near the Stewart's at Sunset Beach.\n\nThere are currently some remnants of an old playground there; some wings and some sail structures, but those would come down in order to make way for the new playground.\n\nThe new playground would also be all-inclusive which according to Shorebeat means it allows all children including those with physical and developmental disabilities would be able to enjoy all the playground has to offer.\n\nThe new playground would also come with some new bathrooms, which is fantastic because right now Sunset Beach is lacking in the bathroom department."
