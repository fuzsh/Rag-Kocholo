        "text": "Peer mentors and alumni are valuable resources in our program who help us build a loving and supportive community. The peer mentor program at the MSCA program provides additional support to students' career success. Mentors utilize their own experience in job searching to guide mentees to help them improve the desirable skills in the job market and empower them to achieve their goals even facing obstacles. Our alumni are excellent examples of real-life success stories. Their experiences have inspired students to set long-term goals and develop confidence in a competitive job market.\n\nMeet Our Spring 2023 Peer Mentors\n\nHabibah Aftab\n\nAcademic Background: Master of Science in Supply Chain Analytics;\n\nUndergraduate: Bachelors of Electrical Engineering\n\nWork Experience: A total of 2.5 years of work experience across FMCG, Steel Manufacturing Industry and Engineering Sales and Business Development\n\nPersonal Interest: Writing, Reading, Hiking, Cooking\n\nContact: https://www.linkedin.com/in/habibah-aftab-89226a74/\n\nE-mail: ha482@scarletmail.rutgers.edu\n\nI'm an aspiring Supply Chain Professional eager to learn and grow with an open mind. Having worked in manufacturing industries and B2B sales, Planning, Problem Solving and Negotiating tops my skill set while Leadership and Communication are my prominent key strengths. The intricacy of supply chain processes and room for innovation and improvement in the field inspire me every day and that is why I have chosen to be a part of MSCA initiative so that I can learn and grow from everyone around while simultaneously giving back to our RBS community and help students excel in all domains. Together, we can make a lot of difference in finding out solutions to all your career-related and academic queries. Don't hesitate to reach out to me with your questions and confusions. Looking forward to working with you all.\n\nPang-Yuan Lin\n\nAcademic Background: Master of Science in Supply Chain Analytics, Class of 2023;\n\nUndergraduate: Bachelor of Business Administration\n\nWork Experience: 2 years of experience in sales, logistics, and marketing​​​​​​​\n\nSkillsets: R, Python, Tableau, SQL​​​​​​​\n\nPersonal Interest: Travel, Basketball, Tennis​​​​​​​\n\nContact: https://www.linkedin.com/in/pangyuanlin/​​​​​​​\n\nE-mail: pl589@scarletmail.rutgers.edu\n\nYou might think there are too many supply chain-related job openings and that determining a career path is challenging. You are not alone, so don't worry. The MSCA program offers much assistance with both academics and employment. As a peer mentor, I would like to use my experiences to help other students, especially international students like me, who need help finding internships or jobs, and network with experienced alums. As I have received so much support from the program and alums, I wish to help more fellow students. The program is fantastic, and I look forward to working with everyone. Please feel free to contact me.\n\nMaharghya Basu\n\nAcademic Background: Undergraduate: Bachelor of Technology, Mechanical Engineering;\n\nGraduate: Master of Science, Supply Chain Analytics\n\nWork Experience: 4.5 years of experience in management consulting working across strategy, performance, pricing & contracting for a pharmaceutical client\n\nPersonal Interest: Soccer, Cooking, Music\n\nContact: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maharghya-basu/\n\nE-mail: mb2230@rutgers.edu\n\nDuring the second-last semester of my undergrad, I embarked on educating and coaching myself on how to enter the corporate world. I believed that simply learning new things would not suffice. It was imperative that I know how to translate the same into the business world by bringing value using the skillsets I had developed and could potentially develop. 4.5 years in management consulting helped me hone new skills, network and led to mutual growth and benefits. My own experiences as well as being part of campus recruitment for my former employers made me empathize with student job seekers. I would like to use my educational background and work experience to help my peers network and identify new opportunities. The MS Supply Chain Analytics at RBS is one of the best programs. I want to help my peers across the line not only by leveraging this platform and the skills they have attained from prior experiences but also by bridging the gap between their current skills and the requirements of the roles. I am excited to meet and learn from everyone. I am optimistic about this program being a fruitful experience.\n\nPast Peer Mentors"
