Gaile Lok made her film debut starring in the 2000 romantic film, I Do, and subsequently appeared in another film entitled My Sweetie in 2004. When she made her debut, some Hong Kong entertainment information magazines had compared her likeness to that of Shu Qi, a Taiwanese actress.

As of 2006, Gaile was dating Leon Lai, a Hong Kong actor and singer. With this relationship, she became a target of paparazzi and the media. In 2006, a magazine published an article and intimate photographs of her with Leon Lai at the latter's residence, prompting the Hong Kong Actors Guild to protest "irresponsibility" on the part of the magazine.

In 2009, she and Lai were secretly married in Las Vegas at the Wynn Hotel, with his manager and assistant acting as witnesses.

On 3 October 2012 the couple had announced the end of their four-year marriage. The couple's joint statement stated that there were "different philosophies in life" which caused the divorce. Leon Lai's manager stated that there was not a third party that lead the couple to divorce.
