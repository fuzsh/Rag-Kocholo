22 Jul â€“ Rumours have been circling that the marriage of Hong Kong actor Leon Lai and his wife Gaile Lok are hitting the rocks.

According to media reports, Leon had reportedly filed divorce papers last week, while his wife Gaile had reportedly moved out from the actor's house.

Since the couple married in 2008 at Las Vegas, this is not the first time that the 46-year-old singer-actor has been hit by speculations that his marriage is coming to an end.

When asked to verify the rumours, Gaile's spokesman, Mr. Chan said that he has been hearing about the rumours for quite some time but had no idea of its source.

He added that the 32-year-old model is not reachable as she is still in the United States.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Leon has denied the rumours that appeared on Hong Kong tabloids to be credible. He also added that the actor's personal affairs are not under the company's control.
