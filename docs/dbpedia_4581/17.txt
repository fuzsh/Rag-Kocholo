Written note on can of 'Goenert" refers to Dr. Fritz (Friedrich) Goernnert, of Goering's administrative staff (Stabsamt), responsible for the Reich Marshal's three special trains; he maintained close contact with Martin Bormann & the Nazi Party. OSS Report on Nazi Art Looting names Goernnert and Gen. Kattengel [sic] among participants in Goering's structure for looting art in occupied Europe. The report describes Kattengel as working directly under Goernnert, and indicates Goering's private trains were used to transport much of the art looted from German-occupied Europe. The trains were named "Asien" [Asia] and "Robinson."
