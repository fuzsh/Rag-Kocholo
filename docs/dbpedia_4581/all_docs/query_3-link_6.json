The II./JG27 arrived in North Africa in the Summer of 1941 and the effect of the sun has faded and bleached the paintwork. As the emblem below the cockpit is clearly that of Stab II./JG27, the black and white Stab markings, sometimes identified as denoting an aircraft flown by a Major of the Geschwader Stab are thought in this instance to have another significance, possibly indicating that the aircraft was flown by the Gruppe Technical Officer.\n\nBf 109F II./JG27 (II+ Otto Schulz El Gazala 1941 01-02\n\nTwo photographs showing a Bf 109F-4 Trop of Gruppenstab II./JG27, probably in December 1941.

Schulz attacked and shot down a Hurricane, his 51st victory, which he saw crash-land, and was engaged in strafing his victim on the ground when he was himself attacked by a Kittyhawk and killed.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4Z/Trop Stab I./JG27 <A+ Werner Schroer Martuba Nov 1942\n\nProfile Source: Model Airplane Int 086 2012-09 Page 44\n\nMartuba Air Base (Arabic: Ø§ÙÙÙØ§Øª Ø§ÙØ¬ÙÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙØ¨ÙØ©â, Berber: Adwas Alibyan Ujnna) is now a Libyan Air Force base in the Derna District of Libya, located approximately 27 kilometres south-southeast of Derna, 268 kilometres east-northeast of Benghazi\n\nBf 109F I./JG27 <A+ Fw.

The combatants on the Axis side were the Panzer Army Afrika, consisting of German and Italian units and commanded by the \"Desert Fox\" Colonel-General Erwin Rommel; the Allied forces were the Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie under the close supervision of the Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Sir Claude Auchinleck. Rommel drove his armoured forces round the southern flank of the Gazala position, to engage the British armour behind the Allied defences. Despite success, Rommel found himself in a precarious position: interference to supply lines resulting from the resistance of Allied Forces, which anchored the southern end of the Allied Gazala defences and left a long route of supply to his forces behind the British line.\n\nRommel pulled back into a position abutting the British minefields, a defensive position termed \"the Cauldron\", creating a threatening presence in the midst of the British forces which was difficult to ignore. When Ritchie attacked his armoured forces lost many tanks and Rommel maintained the initiative. As the British withdrew from the Gazala line, Rommel concentrated his forces and was able to punch through the defences of Tobruk in a day, resulting in the capture of Tobruk and a resounding victory for the Axis. The battle is considered the greatest victory of Rommel's career. Rommel pursued the British into Egypt, trying to keep his opponent under pressure to deny him the opportunity to regroup. As both sides neared exhaustion, Auchinleck was able to check Rommel's advance at the First battle of El Alamein.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F-4/Trop 1./JG27 White 1 Commander Wolfgang Redlich Gazala airfield Libya November 1941\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F-4/Trop 'White 1' of Hptm.

This aircraft is finished in a standard low-demarcation 79/78 desert scheme with an all-yellow cowling, but in this case, the white on the spinner has not been extended back to the first panel line on the engine cowling.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4 I./JG27 (White 3+) North Africa 1941\n\nPhoto 01: A Bf 109F-4 Trop, White 3 of I./JG27.1t has been observed that the style of number is unusual for 1. Gruppe and may indicate the aircraft has been transferred from another Gruppe. The camouflage scheme consists of sand uppersurfaces with mid-demarcation, but tonal values between the sand and the undersurface blue makes the demarcation line almost indistinguishable.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf-109E 1./JG27 (W5+) Albert Espenlaub N.

Albert Espenlaub of 1./JG27, December 1941\n\nThis aircraft is depicted as it is believed to have appeared shortly before it was shot down on 13 December. It was finished in standard 79 Sand Yellow uppersurfaces with 78 undersurfaces and white theatre markings. The 14 victory bars are speculative and are based on the Abschussbalken seen on the rudder of this pilots White 5, shown on the previous page.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F 1./JG27 (W11+) Albert Espenlaub W.Nr 8477 El Adem, N Africa Dec 13, 1941 01\n\nPhoto's 01-02: British soldiers posing near El Adem with Ofw. Albert Espenlaubs Bf 109F-4 Trop, White 11. During air combat on 13 December 1941, this aircraft, W.Nr. 8477, received damage to its engine cooling system and crash-landed behind Allied lines. At this time, Espenlaub had 14 victories but the two rows of Abschussbalken, which would have appeared on the rudder above the large tear in the fabric, have already been removed as souvenirs. Note that the aircraft appears darker than usual in these photographs on account of the liberal amount of boiling oil which has sprayed from the engine and coated most of the fuselage and leading edge of the fin. Ofw. Espenlaub was captured uninjured but later was shot and killed by a guard while trying to escape from a PoW camp in Palestine.\n\nProfile Source: Model Airplane Int 086 2012-09 Page 43\n\nLuftwaffe JG27 pilot Albert Espenlaub\n\nPhoto 01-02: Pilots of I./JG27 before their flight to North Africa.

The damage to the propeller blades suggests this machine made a forced landing and although the photographs are believed to have been taken at El Adem on 22 December 1941, the aircraft perhaps crashed elsewhere and was taken to El Adem later. The 78 Sandgelb camouflage on this aircraft, which extended right down the fuselage sides, appeared to have been thinly applied by brush and the original camouflage, particularly along the fuselage top decking, showed through as darker areas. The rudder was yellow and the white nose area immediately behind the spinner has been darkened by a coolant or oil leak.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F 1./JG27 (W9+) North Africa Feb 1942 01\n\nThe true nature of the Sandgelb 79 and Hellblau 78 colours used by the Luftwaffe in North Africa is revealed in this color photograph. The white segment on the spinner, the white fuselage band and the yellow under the cowling are absolutely typical of Bf 109Fs operating in North Africa in late 1941 and during 1942. The only modification introduced to these colors and markings was that the spinners were later painted all white and a white band, extending back to the panel line immediately ahead of the exhausts, was added to the front of the engine cowling, as barely visible on 'White 9'. Note the low tonal value between the blue and the sand which, in monochrome photographs, sometimes makes it difficult to clearly recognise the demarcation line.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F 1./JG27 (W11+) Albert Espenlaub W.Nr 8477 El Adem, N Africa Dec 13, 1941 00\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4/Trop White 11 flown by Ofw.

The badge of 4./JG27 appeared under the cockpit and this aircraft had a faded, dusty, used appearance which was exaggerated by the oil leak which has caused heavy discolouration of the yellow area surrounding the oil cooler intake under the nose. Although not visible in the accompanying photographs, it is believed that this aircraft had a II. Gruppe bar, partially overpainted, on the rear fuselage.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F 4./JG27 (W12+-) WNr 8438 El Gazala Dec 1941 01-03\n\nPhoto's 01-03: British troops examining a Bf 109F-4 Trop, White 12 of 4./JG27. This aircraft, believed to be W.Nr. 8438, was captured by the British at El Gazala in December 1941 and had the Staffel badge under the cockpit. The aircraft had been deliberately wrecked by demolition charges but examination of an original print shows that the oil leak from the oil cooler had been blown backwards by the slipstream. Thus it must have been present when the aircraft was flown and was not caused by the demolition charges. Note that leaking oil has spread over the already black-painted wing root.\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4 of II JG27 red 4 Sanyet 1942\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4 of II JG27, Sanyet, 1942\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4Trop 2./JG27 (Red 11+) Friedrich Koerner W.Nr. 10154 Libya 1942\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109F 5./JG27 (Red 5+-) abandoned North Africa Nov 1942\n\nMesserschmitt Bf 109 F-4/Trop 5./JG27 (Black 2+-) Hans Niederhofer North Africa Dec 1941\n\nProfile 00: A Me109F-4 Trop of 5./JG27 flown by Uffz.

This feature has been observed on a number of Bf 109Fs operating in the Western Desert and seems to have occurred more frequently in this theatre than in Russia or on the Channel Front.

The white segment on the spinner, the white fuselage band and the yellow under the cowling are absolutely typical of Bf 109Fs operating in North Africa in late 1941 and during 1942. The only modification introduced to these colors and markings was that the spinners were later painted all white and a white band, extending back to the panel line immediately ahead of the exhausts, was added to the front of the engine cowling.

His Luftwaffe career began in 1937 as a member of the ground staff. In May 1940 he completed his flying training. On 27 August 1940 he joined 2./JG27 based on the Channel front. He flew his first combat missions during the Battle of Britain but did not claim any confirmed victories. In March 1941, I./JG27 was deployed toNorth Africain order to support theAfrika Korps under the command of Erwin Rommel.Schroer claimed his first victory, a RAF Hurricane, on 19 April 1941, however, his Bf-109E (WNr 3790) was hit and he had to make a forced-landing near his airfield with 48 bullet holes in his aircraft.\n\nOn 21 April, in an engagement with RAF Hurricanes, an aircraft collided with his Bf-109E (WNr 4170) slightly injuring him and requiring him to make another forced-landing. By the end of 1941 his score stood at seven. In March 1942, he was appointed Adjutant of I./JG27. He was appointed StaffelkapitÃ¤n of 8./JG27 on 22 June. In July he recorded 16 victories.\n\nOn 9 September, he was awarded the Deutsches Kreuz in Gold. He shot down 13 enemy aircraft in September, including six on 15 September to record his 35th through 40th victories. In October, Schroer claimed 15 victories. Leutnant Schroer was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 21 October for 49 victories. On 4 November, Schroer, with Alfred StÃ¼ckler (10 victories), shot down two four-engined B-24s. On 11 February 1943, Schroer reportedlyshot down two RAF Beauforts,although he claimed them as B-26s.\n\nWhen Major Gustav RÃ¶del (98 victories, including 13 four-engined bombers, RK-EL) was appointed Kommodore of JG27, Hauptmann Schroer took his place as Gruppenkommandeur of II./JG27 on 22 April 1943. Operating over Sicily and southern Italy, between 29 April and 23 July, Schroer was to claim 22 Allied aircraft shot down, including 12 four-engined bombers. On 2 August, he became the 268th recipient of the Eichenlaub, awarded for his 84 victories. In August 1943, II./JG27 was redeployed to Wiesbaden-Erbenheim in Germany for Reichsverteidigung duties. On 6 September, Schroer led the Gruppe on an interception of a formation of 262 B-17s. In all 45 American bombers were lost including four shot down by II./JG27, three of which were claimed by Schroer as his victories 86 through 88.\n\nOn 3 March 1944, Major Schroer scored his 99th victory and was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG54, relieving Major Rudolf Sinner (39 victories, DK) who had been badly wounded on 6 March attacking a formation of four-engined bombers III./JG54 was based at LÃ¼neberg and flew the Bf-109G-6.\n\nOn 24 May, Schroer shot down a P-51 and two P-47s for his 100th to 102nd victories. On 21 July 1944, Schroer relinquished command of III./JG54 to Hauptmann Robert 'Bazi' Weiss (121 victories, RK-EL, killed in action 29 December 1944). Schroer was transferred to a fighter pilot school as an instructor. On 4 August, he had to make a forced-landing when his engine malfunctioned. From November 1944 to February 1945 Schroer was retained in a training role.\n\nOn 14 February 1945, Schroer was appointed Kommodore of JG3. With this unit he quickly claimed 12 Russian aircraft destroyed. On 19 April 1945 he became the 144th recipient of the Schwertern. Werner Schroer survived the war. He died on 10 February 1985 in Munich, aged 67.\n\nWerner Schroer was credited with 114 victories flying 197 missions. 102 of his victories were scored on the Western front, including 61 claimed over North Africa, and 26 four-engined bombers.\n\nAsisbiz database list of aerial victories for Werner Schroer\n\nNo Date Time A/c Type Unit Location / Comments 1. 19.4.1941 - Hurricane 1./JG27 W Tobruk

He joined the Luftwaffe in 1934 and served for many years as an instructor. On 3 January 1940, Schulz was transferred to 4./JG27. He participated in the French campaign and the Battle of Britain. He recorded his first victory on 31 August 1940, when he shot down a RAF Spitfire fighter near Dover. By the end of 1940, he had four victories to his credit. In April 1941, Schulz participated in the Balkans invasion. He recorded two victories over Greece, including a Greek PZL fighter shot down over the airfield at Larissa on 15 April and a RAF Hurricane fighter shot down near Megara on 20 April.\n\nSchulz participated in the invasion of Russia. He claimed three victories during June 1941, before the unit was transferred to the Mediterranean theatre in September. Operating over the deserts of North Africa, Schulz was to be particularly successful. On each of the days 6 October 1941, 20 October and 28 November, he recorded three victories. Schulz shot down two RAF P-40 fighters on 30 November to record his 23rd and 24th victories. Both were piloted by notable Allied pilots: Australian, Sergeant Alan 'Tiny' Cameron (6.5 confirmed, 1 probable and 7 damaged victories) of 3Sqn, RAAF, who crash-landed and British pilot Pilot Officer Neville Duke (26.833 confirmed, 1 probable and 6 damaged victories) of 112Sqn, RAF.\n\nHe claimed another notable RAF pilot on 15 December (30), when he shot down and killed Pilot Officer Geoffrey Ranger (5.333 confirmed, 1 probable and 1 damaged victories) of 250Sqn, RAF. It is also thought that Schulz was the victor, when he shot down a Curtiss P-40 flown by the Australian ace, Flying Officer Andrew 'Nicky' Barr (11 confirmed, 3 probable and 8 damaged victories) of 3Sqn, RAAF , who crash-landed in the Agedabia-El Brega area, wounded on 11 January. He shot down five Curtiss P-40 fighters in 10 minutes on 15 February 1942 (40-44), including another British ace, S/L Ernest 'Imshi' Mason (15.4 confirmed and 3.6 damaged victories) of 94Sqn, RAF, who was killed in this engagement.\n\nOberfeldwebel Schulz was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 22 February. He was promoted to the rank of Leutnant in April. On 31 May, Schulz recorded another Curtiss P-40 victory (49), flown by yet another notable Allied ace, South African Major Andrew Duncan (5.5 confirmed and 1 probable victories) of 5Sqn, SAAF, who was killed in the engagement. On 17 June 1942, Schulz was shot down and killed in aerial combat. He had shot down an RAF Hurricane fighter, flown by Canadian ace Flight Lieutenant Walter 'Wally' Conrad (6.5 confirmed, 3 probable and 11 damaged victories) of 274Sqn, RAF, who suffered wounds in the engagement, for his 51st, and last, victory. However, Schulz was then shot down in Bf 109F-4 (W.Nr 10271) <+ by a RAF Curtiss P-40 in the Sidi Rezegh area. It is thought his victor was Canadian ace Flight Sergeant James 'Eddie' Edwards (16.083 confirmed, 8.5 probable and 13 damaged victories) of 260Sqn, RAF.\n\nOtto Schulz was credited with 51 victories in approximately 400 missions. He recorded three victories over the Eastern front and 48 victories over the Western front.\n\nAsisbiz database list of 51 aerial victories for Otto Schulz\n\nNo Date Time A/c Type Unit Location

KÃ¶rner enlisted in the Luftwaffe on 15 November 1939 and on completion of fighter pilot training was assigned to 2./JG 27 based in North Africa. He duly arrived on 4 July 1941. His first victory was achieved on 12 October 1941, when he shot down a RAF Tomahawk fighter over Sheferzen. On 19 March 1942, KÃ¶rner shot down a RAF P-40 fighter over the sea east of Tobruk for his 10th victory and JG 27's 1000th aerial victory. KÃ¶rner enjoyed his best day of aerial combat over Marsa Martruh where, on 26 June 1942, he shot down three SAAF P-40 fighters and two RAF Spitfire fighters. KÃ¶rner shot down 20 aircraft during June 1942. He was the 7th highest scoring German ace in North Africa. KÃ¶rner was able to achieve multiple kills no less than 7 times while deployed in the North African desert.\n\nOn 4 July 1942, exactly one year to the day after his arrival in the desert, KÃ¶rner scrambled in Bf 109 F-4trop (W.Nr. 8696) âRed 9â on a mission to intercept a formation of enemy bombers. Before he could reach the bombers he was intercepted by a flight of South African Hurricane IIC fighters. At 1330, KÃ¶rner was forced to take to his parachute and was promptly captured by enemy ground forces to remain a prisoner of war in Canada until 1947.\n\nHis victor was South African ace Lieutenant Lawrence Waugh (6 confirmed, 2 probable and 4 damaged victories) of 1 SAAF Squadron. While interned in Canada, KÃ¶rner was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 6 September 1942 for his achievements in the desert. Following his release from captivity, KÃ¶rner fulfilled many important roles in the post-war Bundesluftwaffe. KÃ¶rner retired from military service on 30 June 1979. At the time of his retirement, KÃ¶rner held the rank of Generalmajor. KÃ¶rner lived in Paris with his wife in retirement. He passed away on 3 September 1998.\n\nFriedrich KÃ¶rner was credited with 36 victories in approximately 250 missions.

He began his military career at Salzwedel where he completed his basic flying training. He attended the pilots' school in Breslau and the war school in Vienna-Schwechat. On completion of his training he was posted to JG 27. OberfÃ¤hnrich Stahlschmidt was assigned to 2./JG 27. In the spring of 1941, JG 27 was transferred to Africa. He claimed his first victory, a RAF Hurricane over Tobruk, on 15 June. On 20 November, Stahlschmidt claimed three SAAF Maryland bombers shot down to record his 2nd through 4th victories. On 21 February, he was shot down, making a crash-landing in no-man's land, following aerial combat with theAustralian ace Clive Caldwell (28.5 confirmed, 6 probable and 15 damaged victories)of250 Sqn, RAF.He was rescued by a German reconnaisance patrol.\n\nOn 27 February 1942, he was shot down while attacking a column of enemy vehicles. He force-landed his damaged Bf 109 F-4/Trop (W.Nr. 8497) when his engine cut, ramming a truck. He was captured by Polish troops who beat him with rifle butts and kicked him. His decorations were removed and he was made to run the gauntlet of the column. He was interrogated before being sent to another camp. He managed to escape the following night and hiked the 60km back to his own lines in 16 hours. He was awarded the Deutsches Kreuz on 20 April 1942.\n\nOn 7 May, Stahlschmidt attacked a formation of RAF fighters. He had reached an advantageous position behind a Kittyhawk when one of his guns exploded forcing his disengagement from the combat. He crash-landed his aircraft in Axis territory near Tmimi where his aircraft burned out. Stahlschmidt claimed four victories on 26 June to record his 14th through 17th victories. On 1 July 1942, Stahlschmidt was appointed StaffelkapitÃ¤n of 2./JG 27. He gained 26 victories in July 1942, including four victories on 4 July (23-26), and three on 10 July (31-33), 22 July (38-40) and 27 July (41-43). Leutnant Stahlschmidt was awarded the Ritterkreuz on 20 August 1942 for 48(47?) victories. On 3 September, he recorded five victories to take his tally from 52 to 56.\n\nOn 7 September 1942, Stahlschmidt was part of a Schwarm that had taken off on a freie Jagd. Southeast of El Alamein they came under attack by RAF Spitfires. Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt failed to return in his Bf 109 F-4 (W.Nr. 8704) \"Red 4\". It is possible he was the victim of the American ace John Curry (7.333 confirmed, 2 probable and 3 damaged victories) flying with 601 Sqn, RAF. Stahlschmidt was awarded the Eichenlaub (Nr. 365) and promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant posthumously on 3 January 1944.\n\nHans-Arnold Stahlschmidt shot down 59 enemy aircraft in over 400 combat missions. All his victories were recorded in the North African theatre.\n\nAsisbiz List of aerial victories for Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt\n\nNo Date Time A/c Type Unit location Comments 1. 15.6.1941 11:40
