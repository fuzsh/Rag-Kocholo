        "text": "Operation: Barce, Libya\n\nDate: 21 March 1942 (Saturday)\n\nUnit: No. 24 Squadron SAAF - Motto: \"Per Noctem Per Diem\" (\"Through Night, Through Day\")\n\nType: Douglas A20 Boston III\n\nSerial: Z2225\n\nCode: Not known\n\nBase: Landing Ground 140, Bir el Baheira No 1, near Kambut, Libya\n\nLocation: 35 miles south west of Bir el Hakeim, Libya\n\nPilot: Capt. Jacobus Pieter (Jimmy) Verster 102681 SAAF - Safe and uninjured (1)\n\nObs: 2nd. Lt. J.D.P. Bester 103555 SAAF - Safe and uninjured (2)\n\nAir/Gnr: Sgt.

Col. A.J.M. Mossop SAAF piloting Boston AL733 and detailed to bomb the city of Barce in north east Libya. The formation made its attack at low level and on the return flight whilst flying at 100 feet was attacked by 2 Messerschmitt Bf 109Fs flown by Lt. Friedrich Körner and Lt. Karl von Lieres und Wilkau of 2/JG 27. The crews of the Bostons had not expected the fighter to attack them whilst flying at such a low level and even then they expected just the one pass. However, the Messerschmitts continued to pursue them maintaining a long low level chase and Boston Z2225 had its starboard engine destroyed in the first attack. When in the second attack the port engine was hit, Captain Verster had no alternative but to make a high speed crash landing 35 miles south west of Bir el Hakeim. Whilst the crew were climbing out of the aircraft the enemy fighter ground strafed them and set the aircraft on fire. Air Sergeant Bender had been killed during the aerial combat and his body was burnt out with the aircraft.\n\nThe remainder of the crew then set out to walk on a compass course and after walking for 40 hours without water, were picked up by a Free French Army Patrol and returned to base.\n\nLt. Friedrich Körner (5) and Lt. Karl von Lieres und Wilkau (6) each claimed a Boston the other one shot down being AL733 piloted by Lt. Col. A.J.M. Mossop SAAF. Lt.
