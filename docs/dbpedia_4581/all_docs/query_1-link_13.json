        "text": "Orders for several other new planetariums arrived before the first installation at Das Deutsche Museum was opened. The next few planetariums to be completed would be in Barmen-Elberfeld, then Leipzig, and Düsseldorf.\n\nThe success of this first instrument demonstrations prompted other German cities to follow suit, soon planetariums with their Zeiss projectors were operating in several cities. The first purpose-built built stand alone planetarium originated in the Fall of 1924 when the Mayor of Barmen-Elberfeld, now the Barmen district of the city of Wuppertal, and his deputy visited Carl Zeiss Jena. There they were impressed by the prototype planetarium demonstration. They urged their City Council to approve 350,000 Reichsmarks to build a planetarium; this was a hefty sum in 1924 (then $82,940 USD) or about 42 times the cost of a nice house.\n\nLeft: The Barmer Planetarium, in Barmen-Elberfeld, Germany c.1926 (56,441 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view (148,236 bytes).\n\nThe Modell I planetarium was certainly revolutionary, and inspiring to most who attended. But it had some shortcomings, aspects that an experienced astronomer or presenter might notice. For one, the single tungsten lamp made it impossible to represent stars as having colors. To cover the entire dome with stars and the Milky Way required this projector be installed nearly three meters above the floor; it was bolted onto a concrete footer. But this set the audience well below the level of the horizon, leaving them to feel as though they were observing from some well. This had been made to work at the latitude of Munich, but growing demands from other latitudes meant Carl Zeiss would have to come up with a better design. The Barmer Planetarium would give Carl Zeiss Jena engineers their next chance to improve.\n\nThis housed an improved planetarium projector, the “Zeiss-Planetarium”, often termed the “Modell II”, this could support presentations in domes of larger diameters. The Modell II had been under development since at least 1924 when Dr. Walter Villiger, head of the Astro Division, provided suggestions that contributed to the developments. Villiger and Dr. Bauersfeld shared credit on the Patent of 1925 for development of this “device for projecting stars”.\n\nThe Barmer Planetarium opened on 18 May 1926. Vistors were greeted at the entrance with flanking large statues by Paul Wynand of the Roman god “Mars”, and the goddess “Venus”. This facility could seat up to 600 people, and so while it was the first it would soon become second in capacity to the planetarium opened later at Düsseldorf. The Barmer Planetarium would be destroyed during an air raid by the Royal Air Forces Bomber Command over the night of Saturday 29 to Sunday 30 May 1943 as their incendiary area bombing produced destructive firestorms. By 1955 the remains were demolished. The nearby stone Toelleturm (observation tower) that dated back to 1888 survives, but today there is only a memorial plate to commemorate The Barmer Planetarium.\n\nThe Leipzig Planetarium with its Zeiss Modell II projection system opened on 20 May 1926, just two days after the Barmer Planetarium opened. The Leipzig Planetarium was located at the south-west corner where meets Pfaffendorfer Street meets Kickerlingsberg Street, and adjoining the zoo grounds. This art deco structure featured a dodecagonal exterior base supporting a pyramidal roof. Leipzig remained an important railway hub and was a wartime factory center during World War II, consequently it was bombed by allied air forces. The worst was when the city was visited by 442 Royal Air Force bombers between 3:50 and 4:25 am on 4 December 1943. Consequently explosions and the subsequent firestorm destroyed the planetarium and claimed more than 1,800 lives.\n\nIn part as a technology demonstrator and also as a part of the Stiftungs sense of civic duty, the Zeiss Planetarium Jena was commenced in 1924. As with astronomical observatory construction, Carl Zeiss Jena was not a general contracting builder, so their observatory and their planetarium building and dome designs would be provided to a local licensed architect and builder, and then construction would proceed with the cooperation of representatives from Carl Zeiss Jena. In the case of the Jena planetarium building and dome, the architects selected for this project were Schreiter & Schlag, while the building prime contractor was Dyckerhoff & Widmann A.G..\n\nRight: Zeiss Planetarium Jena with its 25-meter diameter dome. Photo from postcard of the mid 1920s (107,792 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view (151,040 bytes).\n\nThis facility was completed in 1926, also housing the improved the Modell II planetarium projector, and Planetarium Jena was inaugurated on 18 July 1926.\n\nDr. Kurd Kisshauer (b. Dec. 1886 in Berlin, d. Nov. 1958) had been also among the Zeiss employees involved with the project. While Kisshauers doctorate was in political science, he was however an experienced amateur astronomer and member of the Astronomical Society, his practical experience was beneficial for the project. By 1926 Kisshauer had left Carl Zeiss Jena and moved to Dresden where later in 1926 he became the Director of the newly completed Municipal Planetarium Dresden.\n\nWhen the Mannheim Zeiss Planetarium opened on 13 April 1927, Professor Max Wolf wrote about his original recommendation to Oskar von Miller:\n\n“If I praise it, I am doubly entitled to being believed since. For it was I who suggested that other plan for the Deutche Museum,\n\nnamely, of using a great rotating hollow sphere, which happily has been discarded in favor of the Zeiss planetarium”\n\nOver the 1920s there was a boon of demand for these from the civic and educational organizations first in major cities in Germany, and soon from around the globe. Consequently Bauersfelds team modified the original designs so that the projector would be able to represent the skies over any point on the globe. Wherever their planetarium instruments were installed they became a source of civic pride, and an inspirational resource for science education. These sales were a source of revenue for a company that was soon to be working hard to survive the Great Depression.\n\nToday, the Planetarium Jena remains the oldest operating large Zeiss planetarium facility. The original Model II projector operated here from 1926 to January 1969. Three successors have since driven the presentations here, culminating in the Model VIII “Universarium”, produced by a unified Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, that entered service on 19 November 1996.\n\nEven after World War II both Carl Zeiss companies, east and west, would establish planetarium production at their headquarters, and their domes would figure prominently in the skyline of their factories. Even though after the second World War these never retained their status as a profit center for Carl Zeiss, it was a matter of social responsibility and corporate pride that inspired managements to continue production. This may have had something to do also with the leadership and influence of Dr. Bauersfeld, who had been deeply involved with the development of astronomical telescopes, their mounts, and instruments. Since 1927 Bauersfeld had also taught Astronomical Physics and Engineering Mechanics as an Associate Professor, and from 1938 to 1946 was ordentlicher Professor (Professor ordinarius) at the University of Jena.\n\nFor further reading we recommend a more contemporary 1935 account “The Story of the Zeiss Planetarium” by C.A. Chant, this is hosted at https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1935JRASC..29..143C.\n\nGermany Helping The People Who Would Later Eat Their Lunch: Nikon of Japan was formed when three leading optical manufacturers in Japan merged to form Nippon Kōgaku Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha (日本光学工業株式会社, or “Japan Optical Industries Corporation”). The company became known in many areas including the production of optical and measuring equipment, binoculars, small telescopes and even larger and more complicated astronomical telescopes. Moving into the 1920's Nikon worked to produce more sophisticated camera lenses but the company, lacking engineering know-how, ran into roadblocks. So by 1921 Nippon Kogaku persuaded eight German optical engineers to come to work for the company. These engineers including Heinrich Acht, Hermann Dillmann and Max Lange, were instrumental in helping to get Nippon Kogaku onto the right track.\n\nA series of lenses whose designs were modeled on the Zeiss Tessor were designated \"Anytar\" lenses. Seven of the German engineers returned home in 1926 while Acht remained until 1928, this was happening as in-turn Kakuya Sunayama, the General Manager of the Lens Design Department, visited Germany to learn more about optics. Mr. Sunayama acquired a Carl Zeiss 50cm F4.8 Triplet (three element) lens. The Zeiss lens was disassembled, studied, and essentially copied so that by 1929 Nippon Kogaku had completed their first prototype camera lens and designated this the Tessor-type Anytar 50cm F4.5. This lens was followed by the Anytar 12cm F4.5 at the end of 1929, as well as the 7.5 cm and 18 cm focal length lenses. By 1930 the Triplet, the Tessor and the Dagor type lenses were in production. Improving upon the original designs by 1931 the Anytar 12cm F4.5 was said to have become competitive with the Zeiss Tessor. With the prospects for developing a system of photographic lenses it was decided to market them under a unifying name, thus the NIKKOR brand was born in 1932.\n\nThe 1930s And More Optical Innovation For Cameras And Binoculars: in 1849 Moritz Carl Hensoldt (b. 1821 - d. 1903) and his brother-in-law Carl Kellner (known best for his eyepiece design) began a business for the fabrication of telescopes. By 1850 Hensoldt formed his own company “M. Hensoldt & Soehne AG” for the manufacture of optical instruments. By 1928 the Hensoldt company, with its factory in Wetzlar, had the Carl Zeiss company as a shareholder. Zeiss thereby acquired a partnership with a manufacturer best known for their roof prism binoculars introduced in 1897, and in 1905 the “Dialyt” series of Abbe-Koenig in line prism binoculars and riflescopes. Hence the similarity between the appearance of traditional Hensoldt roof prism binoculars made since about 1905 and several Carl Zeiss roof prism products up to today. Improvements continued, including the 1933 shift from binocular housing construction of brass and zinc to lighter weight metals including aluminum and magnesium.\n\nAs mentioned previously, camera production became an important sector for Zeiss, with their dozens of brands and factories involved in production for that market. Zeiss had become involved in camera lens design and fabrication giving the world such famous names as “Tessar”, “Biotar” and “Sonnar” with the latter having been developed by Dr. Ludwig Bertele - another famous name in optics design. The increased emphasis in this growing market lead to a landmark negotiation in the history of Zeiss with the founding of Zeiss Ikon in 1926.\n\nZeiss Ikon AG resulted from the planned merger of four well regarded names in the photo industry, and by the establishment of two new subsidiaries. The business plan was to unify, under Zeiss, the production and marketing of: cameras, lenses, and other photographic equipment by:\n\nOptische Anstalt C.P. Goerz AG of Berlin, originally founded in 1886\n\nHeinrich Ernemann AG, of Dresden, originally founded in 1889\n\nContessa-Nettel AG of Stuttgart, whose origins dated to 1902\n\nIca AG of Dresden, that was formed in 1909 by the merger of:\n\nFabr. phot. App. AG vorm. R Hüttig & Sohn in Dresden, originally founded in 1862\n\nDr. Rudolf Krügener, Photochemisches Laboratorium und Fabrik photographischer Apparate Frankfurt-Bockenheim (Kamerawerk Dr. Krügener) in Frankfurt am Main, founded in 1885\n\nEmil Wünsche AG in Reick of Dresden, originally founded in 1889\n\nCamerawerk Palmos AG (acquired by Zeiss) in Jena, originally founded in 1900\n\nAG Hahn für Optik und Mechanik, would be established in Kassel, 1927\n\nGoerz Photochemische Werke GmbH, would be established in Berlin, 1928\n\nThe combining of these companies was made possible by a notable additional investment from the Zeiss foundation. Zeiss Ikon facilities now included the Ica factory in Dresden, two Goerz factories in Berlin (which also made searchlights, medical instruments), and the Contessa Werke in Stuttgart.\n\nZeiss Ikon AG would remain based in Dresden, there in 1932 they began to produce box cameras under the tenure of Dr. Ing. Heinz Küppenbender. Carl Zeiss entered the 35 mm format camera market, that had been pioneered by rival Ernst Leitz Optische Werke, of Wetzlar. The first 35 mm entry was the “Contax” range finder camera, this was also built in Dresden. These cameras in prewar and in postwar configurations too earned Zeiss worldwide respect and admiration, their success led to the development of the Contarex and the Contax RTS camera series, some of which were fabricated by Yashica-Kyocera of Japan years later under license to Zeiss specifications. Lenses made by Carl Zeiss were made for sale with cameras manufactured by other firms such as Rollei and Exacta at Dresden. Zeiss lenses made in Germany and by Yashica continue as the choice for several camera manufacturing firms including Hasselblad of Sweden - even though in the mid 1970 Hasselblad seriously contemplated offering Nikon lenses. And Zeiss lenses to this day also remain available for use with many commercial products including copiers, photogrammetric cameras, comparators, etc.\n\nMore Innovations In Astronomy, And The First Planetarium In America: the 1930s were an exciting time of change and discovery in the world, and exhilarating time of productivity for Carl Zeiss Jena Astronomical Instruments section. By 1930 the first Planetarium had opened in North America; the “Adler” Zeiss Planetarium in Chicago. This was to introduce several generations of youngsters and adults to a rare treat - a tour of the heavens. To this day Zeiss Planetarium instruments continue to inspire awe at facilities around the world including that planetarium projector at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum “Einstein Planetarium” in Washington, D.C.\n\nZeiss optics were so well regarded and known around the world that this 1930 advertisement featured the Radiogram thanking Carl Zeiss, Inc. of New York. The Radiogram was sent from Richard E. Byrd, Jr. from the Byrd Antarctic Expedition (his first expedition of 1928 to 1930) to the New York Times, and with a return address of “Little America Antarctica”\n\nRight: Carl Zeiss binoculars advertisement of 1930, with text of the advertisement to the center of the page:\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view of the advertisement.\n\n“Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York\n\nZeiss Binoculars, Cameras and Microscopes\n\ngiving splendid results under trying\n\nconditions. They are a pleasure to use,\n\nand their high quality is much appreciated.”\n\nBy 1933 Zeiss had manufactured several proven refractors of the “E”, “A” and “AS” achromatic doublet designs, and apochromat triplets of the “U.V.” and “B” (Koenig) designs. These telescopes were offered in apertures of up to 65cm (25.6 inch) aperture f16 requiring a 14.5 meter diameter dome, a 60cm (23.62 inch) “Doppelrefraktor” (double refractor) f16 was available employing two objectives mounted in parallel within one tube - potentially the largest “binocular” ever made, a 36cm “Dreifacher” employing three telescopes in parallel with two U.V. triplets of 36cm with a 30cm “E” objective guidescope for astrographic uses, and numerous smaller refractors of 40cm, 30cm, 25cm down to 6cm achromatic models for use by amateurs and schools. Large pedestal or tripod mounted binoculars of from 60mm up to 15cm with 20x, 40 and 80x magnification oculars mounted in a turret were in production. Mirror telescopes of Newtonian, Cassegrain and Schmidt designs included models up to 1.25 meter aperture in single, or double or even triple configurations for astrographic applications. Zenith telescopes, spectrographic instruments and attachments, micrometers, photometers, comparators, coelostats of at least up to 65 cm diameter, and sundials of up to at least 90cm diameter rounded out the product line. And of course the production of telescopes was accompanied by the fabrication of mounts and drives to move them, and the domes to house them.\n\nBy the mid 1930s Zeiss offered a very wide selection of camera lenses and filters for use with print, and movie cameras, including some particularly unusual models such as the “Quartz-Anastigmat” of 120mm or 250mm focal length described by Zeiss as a “rapid special lens for criminological and scientific photography particularly with ultraviolet light”.\n\nMore New Technology, Including Antireflection Coatings: prior to 1935 most production refractive lenses were bare glass, ground and polished smooth and with no coatings so the glass surface was exposed to light and the environment*. Most lens surfaces, certainly the front and rear elements, were exposed to air and so these are referred to as an air-spaced element. As doublet lenses developed, some were joined with some liquid in between them and as the liquid dried the lenses seemed cemented together; hence the term cemented elements or a group. So, a lens that has four elements with three cemented together and one separate is said to have four elements in two groups.\n\n* Prior to this here were some attempts, intentional or not, that reduced surface reflections. We can go back to 1817 when Joseph Ritter von Fraunhofer (b. 6 March 1787, d. 7 June 1826) a physicist, optical lens designer and manufacturer, experimented with the treating some polished glass surfaces with sulphuric or nitric acids. More than a century later the Bausch & Lomb company experiments led them to treat some lenses with an acid etched anti-reflection process they described as “Leached” and that was particularly practical for glass elements in photography lenses and some binoculars that needed benefitted from ghosting combined with durability.\n\nA notable amount of the light approaching is reflected off each lens surface - front AND back surfaces too. This light loss can be four to six percent, per surface. Consider what do you see as you walk by a window pane? Your reflection! This happens when there is enough light reflected off that glass surface so that you can discern the image. The same thing was happening in telescopes, eyepieces, and camera lenses because instruments with multiple elements of uncoated glass share a tendency of light to not only to reflect off the first lens surface but to also reflect light back and forth between uncoated air-spaced elements in the system. This not only decreases overall light throughput that reduces brightness and contrast, but it often results in 'ghost' or secondary images showing up on film or to the eye. An astronomer might be perceive a star among others that was not really there.\n\nSo it was another noteworthy milestone when on 1 November 1935 a team at Carl Zeiss Jena led by Dr. Alexander Smakula (b. 9 Sep. 1900, d. 17 May 1983) applied for their Patent for the application of their first anti-reflective (AR) coatings. The Deutsches Reichspatentampt (German Empire Patent Office) Patent 765767 was issued effective 1 November 1935, the date of application, and published on 23 December 1939. Trade-named “T Transparenz”, these coatings when applied to air-spaced lenses surfaces improved light transmission dramatically over uncoated lenses in camera lenses, binoculars, and telescopes. The coatings also reduced the likelihood of ghost images, reflections back and forth between air-spaced lenses, being as pronounced. Consider the effect of the coatings when applied to lenses and prisms of a typical binocular for example, the light transmission would be improved from about half to over eighty per cent. The development found other applications for the advances of optics in many other fields.\n\nThe AR coatings remained a closely guarded technology, a military secret, applied only to the most critical optical elements until about 1940. After then they were applied to the lens elements of more and more devices (binoculars, rangefinders, etc.). By the mid 1940's the consumer might have had their first introduction to this technology with their prescription eyeglasses; so if you see a movie character wearing glasses that lack reflections then you know this timeline should be after 1939.\n\nAlso of note, Dr. Smakula was involved in the development of synthesized crystals, grown from solutions in a laboratory environment.By the end of the 1930's he had developed the first KRS five mixed crystal (thallium iodide-thallium bromide) that remains in use in infrared technology applications.\n\nThe early AR coatings were not very durable, they could literally be wiped off cleaning a glass with poor technique. However, Dr. A. Francis Turner of the Scientific Bureau at the Bausch & Lomb Co. in Rochester, New York developed a more durable Magnesium-Fluoride treatment that are optimized for transmitting in the yellow-green, this region of the visual spectrum is the peak of sensitivity for the human eye. These coatings are only four-millionths of an inch thick but when applied on all air to glass surfaces, light transmission through a binocular was perceptibly increased, in the case of a 7x 50 this might mean increases from 57.8% to 75% and with a reduction of ghosting and flare. First applied for commercial optics by B&L in 1939, by 1941 they were approved for service use and were finding their way into military optics. By 1943 the lenses and prisms of most U.S. military optics were being made with these AR coatings. As telescopes and binoculars were returned to service centers for repairs or maintenance, upgrades such as changing older uncoated lenses to the newer antireflection coated optics could have been retrofitted to some Mod versions. After the war these same coatings were marketed by B&L for the civilian market under their trade name “Balcote”. Soon after the war all major optical companies, including the re-established Carl Zeiss companies, were applying AR coatings to their optics while looking for even better solutions.\n\nZeiss, Just Before The World Went Mad:\n\nIt was the excellent quality of engineering and design, combining with meticulous craftsmanship in manufacturing products by many German firms including: Mercedes, Braun, Zeppelin, Carl Zeiss, Hensoldt, and E. Leitz (presently marketed as “Leica”) to name a few that over the course of the early half of the century served to cement the international perception of the preeminent quality of German optics, mechanical design and manufacture as a whole.\n\nCarl Zeiss Jena had become a Social-Democratic bulwark since the 1800s, especially under the enlightened leadership of Dr. Abbe and his peers. Yet from about 1933 and through World War II the management of the Carl Zeiss Jena industrial complex generally did not oppose, or even supported, the Nationalsozialismus (Nazi) regime as did most major German industries. From their perspective Adolph Hitler was about “make Germany great again”, and many bought into his MGGA movement. So, owing to the influence and actions of the Nazis there would be countless examples of loyal Germans being dashed aside, persecuted and even killed even before Germanya armies invaded any other country. The matter in 1933 of Carl Zeiss Jenas Scientific Director, Dr. Rudolf Straubel and his family (mentioned above), prove that by this time the majority of the management at Carl Zeiss Jena had no idea how to or if to oppose the Nazi policies. Although there are examples of personal risk taken in favor of high moral principles too, these were not usually a matter of company policy.\n\nBy 1937 Zeiss seemed to have developed the most coveted, and best integrated systems of microscopes. Their catalogs listed about twenty high quality monocular, binocular and stereomicroscope configurations in their literature. They also marketed a wide selection of optional attachments and illuminators including at least thirty-three objectives of from 2X to 120X including six Fluorite models, and about twenty eyepieces of Huygens, Orthoscopic, and Compensating designs of from 3X to 30X. Of course their other products lines, including photographic equipment, astronomical telescopes, planetarium instruments, measuring instruments, and more were doing very well too. The 1937 literature indicated Zeiss was established worldwide with marketing branches in: Berlin, Vienna, Cologne, Hamburg, Brussels, London, New York, Los Angeles (under New York), Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Tokyo with other firms acting as sales agents in Montreal, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Singapore, Melbourne and Sydney, Bangkok, Cairo and Haifa, Johannesburg, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Paris, Milan, Madrid, Shanghai.\n\nHowever, by 1937 the corporate priorities in Germany were obviously changing under they direction of the new government. In Dresden, where camera production had been dominant, civilian products and development were gradually discouraged in favor of those products such as bombsights, which met the more immediate goals of the government. Going into World War II the Carl Zeiss Jena factory employed about 10,000 people.\n\nZeiss During World War II:\n\nAs early as in 1937 the actions by the government of Japan in China had prompted President Roosevelt to direct his Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau to evaluate options for economic sanctions, and clear them with the Department of Justice. Tensions with Japan eased and these plans were tabled. The subsequent actions by Nazi Germany in 1938, the Anschluss and later the annexation of the Sudetenland, did not provoke U.S. economic sanctions. However, after Germany invaded Denmark and Norway on 8 April 1940 the United States responded with Presidential Executive Order 8389. The Presidential act was based of the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 as amended by Congress in 1933. Executive Order 8389 initially applied solely to Danish and Norwegian assets held in the United States, it attempted to isolate control of these assets, financial or business or otherwise, from Nazi Germany. This legislation also established an “Alien Property Custodian” who took control of Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, and other assets. The Department of State had argued against implementing the order, wanting the U.S. to appear as much as possible neutral, and for as long as was practical. As Germany advanced through Europe in 1940 and 1941, the assets of those counties that became occupied were similarly frozen. On 14 June 1941 the President issued Executive Order 8785 that extended controls over: Germany (including Danzig, Austria, and Poland), Italy, the Soviet Union (only through 22 June 1941 when Germany invaded it), neutral nations, small principalities, and several countries that had not not previously been included.\n\nWhile the U.S. Government confiscated patents and other assets of Nazi Germany, the American company Carl Zeiss Inc. continued doing business in New York, even after December 1941, but sold all remaining imported merchandise. Afterward, the U.S. based company provided services as possible, including routine work of maintaining and repairing microscopes for example, and eventually became more and more involved with the manufacture of products in the United States. Interestingly enough, throughout World War II one could find newly produced Carl Zeiss licensed designs of optical equipment. For example there were military issue binoculars made in the United States based on Zeiss designs, and that appear identical to those of Zeiss Jena, but that were made by United States companies.\n\nThe Presidents Executive Order addressed trademarks too, so the doublet lens logo of Carl Zeiss Inc. was modified so that it bore only the ZEISS name in the upper partition, and most often with a product model (7x50 for example) in the lower partition of the logo. However, by 1944 these products being made in the USA tended to no longer bear any mention of Zeiss, or the logo, in their labeling. Throughout this time Carl Zeiss Inc. remained under the management of Dr. Karl Bauer, the corporations first president who was a citizen of Germany.\n\nIn the years just before and for a year or two after World War II began (arguably) in September 1939 there had been an air of invincibility in Germany. In keeping with traditional practice most Carl Zeiss products and those of other manufacturers in Germany had proudly borne the makers trademark and city of origin of the product. However, by late 1941 it became clear to the Nazi administration that the Allies would be able to identify factories and then bomb these targets in Germany. So in February 1942 the German Armaments Ministry assigned three letter code marks to each of those companies engaged in fabricating military hardware. The codes identified the manufacturer and their facility location. So for example Carl Zeiss Jena products employed code marks including “blc”, and later in the war “rln”, while Leitz products were identified by “beh”, and so on.\n\nAn Endorsement Of Zeiss By The U.S. Government: as had been the case when the United States entered World War I, in 1942 the military did not possess enough binoculars to meet the impending needs of their rapidly growing forces. The manufacturers that would in time meet that demand were just starting to gear up for war, their escalating production would not meet the demand for a year or more. So in the interim the government issued appeals for consumers to loan their better binoculars for the war effort. In a replay of the Eyes for the Navy program of 1918, in the U.S. Navy asked civilians to send in their binoculars for evaluation of suitability for service, these were sent to The U.S. Naval Observatory, in Washington, D.C. It is an interesting commentary about how well regarded Carl Zeiss Jena optics were in the years leading up to World War II when the U.S. Government published advertisements asking the public to loan their personal binoculars for the war effort the ads specifically mention Zeiss and Bausch & Lomb.\n\nRight: one of the U.S. Navy advertisements soliciting civilian binoculars, this was printed in 1942. The text of that ad is below (44,401 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view.\n\nNo Enemy Sub Will Dare Lift Its Eye If You Lend Your Zeiss\n\nOr Bausch and Lomb Binoculars To The Navy\n\nPack Carefully, Include Your Name And Address\n\nSend To Naval Observatory Washington D.C.\n\nThe newly arrived civilian binocular would be inspected and if found suitable for naval use it would have a Serial No. and owners name too engraved for identification purposes. The number would be a four or five digit number followed by a dash and the year. So it is possible to find binoculars that were originally made and trademarked for the consumer market bearing military identification markings. It is somewhat ironic that Zeiss optics were pressed into service against the very U-Boats that Zeiss supplied with binoculars and periscopes.\n\nSince regulations of the day prohibited Federal agencies, including the military, from the accepting of gifts or free loans the owner of the loaned binocular had to be compensated. So the owner received a letter from the Navy Bureau of Ships confirming the loan and providing them with the assigned serial number, the letter also enclosed a Public Voucher form to be completed and signed by the citizen. Upon return of that voucher the Navy would issue a check in the amount of one dollar, the same amount they paid in 1918, that “releases the Navy from any obligation should the binoculars be lost. All possible care will be taken, however, to insure their return at the end of the war.” After the war the owners whose binoculars could not be returned were contacted again by the Navy and offered compensation.\n\nBack In Europe: there were forced foreign laborers (Fremdarbeiter) who were brought to work at Carl Zeiss Jena and other German manufacturing facilities. And it is certain that not all Germans were sympathetic to the Nazi regime, in fact there are known examples of intervention by the Zeiss Personnel Department to obtain the release from prison of some foreign laborers. Some Germans might warn a newcomer to “watch what you say” around certain others who might be Nazi supporters. One foreign laborer at Jena recalls visiting a couple whose son was at the Russian front and while there he dialed their radio to listen to the news from London, he was later warned such conduct in wartime Nazi Germany could lead to the death penalty.\n\nZeiss optics figured prominently in the success of many weapons systems. For examples there were the pressure resistant U-Boat U.D.F. targeting bearing transmitter binoculars, ultra wide angle large aperture binoculars, the stereoscopic range finders and sights used to direct fearsome weapons such as the outstanding 88mm anti-tank guns. One of the most published early photographs of the war shows Adolf Hitler outside of Warsaw, Poland in September of 1939 observing through a pair of artillery director periscoping binoculars (commonly used by a battery director to evaluate and correct artillery ranging) as the city is leveled by German artillery and air forces. Company Seven maintains a 52mm Scherenfernrohr, literally translates to shears or scissors telescope though sometimes referred to by Zeiss as Relieffernrohre or Relief Telescope, with rotating eyepiece turret of 10/20 X on exhibit in our museum collection.\n\nIntricate examples of complex lens making were found bearing Zeiss code marks indicating production after November 1944, even though the need for such sophistication and refinement on one product in a nation beset by lack of raw materials and manpower could be questioned. In Company Sevens collection for example we have a finely crafted hand held Zeiss 7x 50 mm binocular with very sophisticated optics marked “rln”, two custom made sets of filters, finely sewn leather case with straps and eyepiece rain guard engraved “Benutzer” (user) that was made at a time while many other Zeiss hand held military binoculars made were being shipped with painted prism housings instead of the pebble grain exteriors, and with no accessories. The Benutzer rain guard covers the eyepieces and offers protection against dirt or rain and water spray at sea; the personalization of the cover may have applied to a particular user or position (watch station for example) and is not necessarily indicative of having been made for some otherwise notable person.\n\nThe Downfall And Breakup Of Germany, And Of Carl Zeiss Jena:\n\nAllied Bombing Campaign: in September 1939 the German Wehrmacht (military) commenced the strategy of indiscriminate bombing of civilian population centers* with those in Poland first experiencing this from the air by the Luftwaffe (Air Force), and from ground Heer (Army) artillery. On the western front the Luftwaffe attacks initially targeted facilities of tactical or strategic importance. In the early periods during the war allied air attacks too targeted facilities of tactical or strategic importance, some of these by Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command actually struck targets in Germany as early as in March 1940, though with largely symbolic results.\n\n* We argue terror bombing was pioneered by the Luftwaffe “Legion Condor” commencing in 1937, this during the Spanish Civil War that brought the Nationalists under Francisco Franco to power.\n\nAfter the fall of France in June 1940 the United Kingdom was left largely alone to stand against Nazi Germany. The RAF Fighter Command was increasingly put on the defense; during the Battle of Britain they relied on “the few” to stand against the Luftwaffe. This and the U-Boat war too were strangling the United Kingdom when Germany changed their priorities in what became known as “The Blitz” that commenced on 7 September of 1940, directing bombings by the Luftwaffe against industrial areas of London (Unternehmen Loge) and of other industrial cities too. The following months saw these raids expand their reach to purposefully target civilian populations centers with the thought of destroying morale and impacting wartime production. However, the Luftwaffe had not (and would never) develop suitable long range bomber aircraft and escorts in the numbers necessary to effectively bomb distant large target areas. Given the distances Luftwaffe escort fighter aircraft had to fly and the home ground advantage of those in the RAF, the Luftwaffe paid dearly for comparatively little results. By 1942 the British RAF too launched air raids that purposefully targeted civilians of German cities.\n\nBombings Affecting Zeiss Facilities: after Nazi Germany declared war on the United States the major German cities were bombed by medium and heavy bombers of the Allies, increasingly at will, with some raids specifically targeting Zeiss facilities. The city of Stuttgart for example was targeted in a series of fifty-three allied air raids that commenced 25 August 1940 and continued through the course of the war; the worst raids in 1944 obliterated the central district while the Contessa factory in the Henslack district suffered only minor damage.\n\nJena had remained an important University city, a center of science, and because of the Carl Zeiss works and Schott AG it was an important industrial site involved in production for the Nazi Armaments Ministry. The Konzentrationslager Buchenwald (Buchenwald concentration camp) established one of their sub-camps in the northern suburbs of Jena, this housed (figuratively speaking) some 1,000 prisoners assigned to work for the Löbstedter Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk (Reichs road repair shop, or RAW), and later in 1944 these prisoners were also made available for repair of Deutsche Reichsbahn (German railroad). In addition to defense in the air by Luftwaffe fighter aircraft, Jena would over time build shelters and become defended by antiaircraft (flak) batteries, barrage balloons, and smoke generating equipment.\n\nOn the evening of 16 August 1940 four bombs were dropped by the Royal Air Force on the Gelände des Saalbahnhofs (railway station) of Jena; while the intent may have been to disable the facility the actual damage was more symbolic of what might be to come rather than significant.\n\nAs early as in April 1942 the city of Jena appeared on a list prepared by the British Bomber Command for the British War Cabinet of possible targets to be targeted for incendiary bombing, and by November that year the list had grown to include some fifty-eight cities. About one third of a typical R.A.F. bomb loading were magnesium or phosphorus incendiary bombs, the remainder being GP (General Purpose) bombs. However, the devastation caused by the purposeful incendiary bombings of Lübeck in 1942, Hamburg in 1943, and Dresden in 1945 would not be visited upon Jena.\n\nOn 27 May 1943 the R.A.F. visited again with fourteen low-flying de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito attack aircraft that dropped twenty-four 500 lb. bombs, about half of these incorporated delayed action fusing. The city sustained 12 dead and 56 wounded, while the damage was significant owing to the resultant fires. The raid no doubt impacted the psyche of the citizenry to some degree, and damaged the facilities at Zeiss. The R.A.F. lost three aircraft. The Royal Air Force did not bomb Jena again until three of their aircraft dropped twelve bombs on the city center and southern areas on the evening of 10 March 1945, and again on the evening of 15 March, both instances producing only minimal damage.\n\nJena was never designated by the U.S. Air Force as a Primary Target. However, on 8 February 1945 Jena was approved as an alternative Industrial Secondary Target, not so much for its overall value to the war effort but likely because other targets were either already effectively bombed or overrun by allied forces. So Jena was bombed by the U.S. Eighth Air Force several times late in the war, each time with increasing severity.\n\nRight: Jena, Germany today.

Almost halfway between the Jentower and the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena is the Stadtkirche Sankt Michael (Church of St. Michael) that was unfortunately heavily damaged over several raids.

Photo by U.S. Eighth Air Force.\n\nClick on the image to see enlarged view of Jena overlayed with the photo taken during an air raid in March 1945 (478,560 bytes).\n\nThe first U.S. bombing raid at Jena occurred on Friday 9 February 1945, when the United States Eighth Air Force (Mission 824) dispatched 1,296 bombers and 871 fighters in six separate forces. These were primarily targeting oil facilities in Germany, while also winning a war of attrition against the Luftwaffe who suffered a total 87 aircraft destroyed or damaged against 8 United States bombers and 5 fighters lost.\n\nNearly two thirds of the 311 U.S. bombers are reassigned to hit secondary targets, targets of opportunity for these 198 aircraft were the munitions industry in Weimar. Of these 198 B-17G “Flying Fortresses” aircraft, 11 bombed Jena shortly after noon damaging the city center and the northern quarter, including the Stadtkirche Sankt Michael (Church of St. Michael) and the Universitätshauptgebäude (University Library), with about 27 tons of bombs. In Jena this caused 98 deaths, 53 seriously injured, and another 204 slightly injured, while some 34 remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe second U.S. bomb raid at Jena occurred on Friday 23 February 1945, when the United States Eighth Air Force (Mission 843) dispatched 1,274 bombers in three groups, and 705 fighters. These were primarily targeting marshalling yards in Germany, while again combatting the Luftwaffe who suffered a total 31 aircraft destroyed or damaged against 1 United States B-24 “Liberator” bomber and 6 P-51 fighter aircraft lost. Of the 1,274 bombers, 368 were assigned to hit marshalling yards in Weimar, with 25 of the B-24s targeting the yards in Jena. Nearly 60 tons of bombs started falling at 11:41 AM and striking in the North East of the city up to Löbstedt.\n\nOn Saturday, 17 March 1945 the United States Eighth Air Force Mission 892) again visited Jena. Mission 892 dispatched 1,328 bombers and 820 P-51 fighter aircraft in three groups to strike oil, industrial, and rail transportation targets in Germany. Owing to cloud coverage over some primary targets several B-17G aircraft of the second group were diverted to bomb secondary targets, these included the 71 B-17G that targeted the Zeiss works arriving over Jena at 1 pm. The city defenses and Luftwaffe had been weakened so that the B-17s dropped 210.7 tons of General Purpose (GP) explosive and fragmentation bombs, and 9 tons of incendiary bombs. Of these some dozen or fewer bombs struck the Zeiss and the Schott factories, the remainder striking the railway yard and other facilities.\n\nOf this group of 449 B-17G, 1 was lost and 2 damaged beyond repair while 15 were damaged but repairable. The U.S.A.F. bombers lost 9 airmen Killed In Action (KIA), 1 P-51 pilot is KIA.\n\nOn Monday, 19 March 1945 the United States Eighth Air Force (Mission 896) again visited Jena in the strike that caused the most loss of life, severely damaging the historic downtown, again including the Church of St. Michael.\n\nThe Eighth Air Force records indicate this operation was originally planned to destroy airfields and industrial targets in Germany. The Eighth Air Force forces consisted of 1,273 bombers in three groups using visual and H2X radar, escorted by and 675 fighter aircraft. The Luftwaffe, though already severely depleted of fuel and experienced pilots, responded to this raid with more than one hundred fighters including a formation of 36 of the recently deployed Me 262 jet aircraft.\n\nCloud cover prevented 496 aircraft from accurately striking primary targets, so commanders of these groups directed the aircraft to bomb secondary planned objectives and these included the optical works at Jena which was bombed by 197 B-17G aircraft of the 3rd Air Division commencing at about 1:15 PM and concluding at 1:32 PM after some 563 tons of bombs were dropped. The bomb load included 800 incendiary devices that were dropped over the city center. The Zeiss factory was struck by about a half dozen bombs that had some effect. This one raid killed at least 134 people (in 2015 revised after studies by the City Historian to 236), leaving some 123 injured, and an estimated 12,000 people homeless. Almost every old building in the city center was damaged. Overall there were 1347 buildings damaged, of these 224 were total losses, while 261 suffered severe damage, 199 with moderate damage, and 663 with lighter damage; Jena had become the most devastated city in the State of Thuringia.\n\nThis bombing raid was witnessed by Lucas Van Hilst, he recounted in a letter sent to us at Company Seven:\n\n“I was standing outside a zig-zag 'Schutzgraben' (protective ditch) looking up to 'my friends', the first wave of whom just passed by so to speak. Then suddenly a German soldier on leave grabbed me by the arm. “Mach schnell, 'runter!!”. The suction of an explosion threw me down the stairs. He may well have saved my life. In the center section several persons were killed or wounded. The last bombardment was the worst. The sight of carts loaded with dead bodies was shocking - as it would anywhere. That air attack did substantial damage to some Zeiss and also to Schott buildings (where one of my Dutch friends was killed). The rather small “Alte Stadt” (Old Town) was totaled. Visiting in 1994 it still was a sad sight.“\n\nThe losses of aircraft and crew in this region were reported as:\n\nLuftwaffe: 3 aircraft were destroyed, 1 likely damaged beyond repair, and 5 missing.\n\nU.S. Air Force losses by aircraft and flak included: 4 B-17G bombers lost (2 in the vicinity of Jena), 4 were damaged beyond repair, and 121 damaged (46 in the vicinity of Jena); 9 airmen were Killed In Action (KIA), 5 Wounded In Action (WIA), and 49 Missing In Action (MIA).\n\nLuftwaffe losses this day over Germany amounted to a total of 41 aircraft destroyed, 3 likely damaged beyond repair, and 19 missing; these losses included 3 Me 262 aircraft. The U.S.A.F. total losses amounted to 6 bombers and 10 fighters are lost.\n\nJena in March 1945 was a transit center with people coming in and out, and with fluctuating numbers of refugees and forced laborers too so it is likely the exact number of casualties on the ground during these air raids will ever be known.\n\nA memorial was established at the Rathausgasse of Jena, and here every 19th of March the dead of that bombing raid are remembered with a wreath. To this day this is a difficult commemoration because many citizens see that event, and the postwar partition of Germany too, as part of what resulted from the actions of the Nazi party. In Jena too there had been Nazi era perpetrators, who as one publication explained “were guilty of the exclusion, persecution and murder of many people”. Another memorial the “Stele zur Judenverfolgung und KZ-Zwangsarbeit” in Jena was established at the Löbstedter Straße 56, this commemorates prewar Jewish residents who were interned at the behest of the Jena Mayor near the site, and this also marks the site of the satellite camp KZ Buchenwald eichsbahnausbesserungswerk (RAW) sub-camp in Jena.\n\nOn 9 April 1945 Jena was again attacked, this time it was the Primary Target for 86 B-26 “Marauder”, medium-range bombers of the 9th Bomber Division of the Ninth US Air Force. Between 16:14 to 16:53 they dropped 151 tons of bombs on Jena. The train station, the existing rolling stock, and approximately 105 surrounding buildings were largely destroyed. There were 108 deaths. In addition, another 6 aircraft loaded with 11 tons of cluster bombs attacked the city antiaircraft positions.\n\nThere is evidence that the disruptions of raw materials and transport were having some chain reaction effect at Zeiss facilities, and those who depended on products coming from Jena. In March 1945 the completion and delivery to the military of several new “Jagdtiger” (Hunting Tiger) tanks were being held up by the late delivery of the special shock resistant, precision sight components from Carl Zeiss Jena. The heaviest operational tank of the war, these tanks are armed with a high velocity long range 128mm gun, and armor so thick and well engineered that they could resist almost anything that ground forces or opposing armor could shoot at them. Some allied ground troops can thank the air forces for sparing them from more encounters with these opponents.\n\nTowards the end of the war in Europe one of the last decisions made in the selection of targets for the allied air forces was whether to bomb Schweinfurt, known for its ball bearing production and also for an October 1943 bombing campaign that resulted in tragic losses for the U.S. Army Air Forces and the German Luftwaffe, or to bomb Jena with its Carl Zeiss and Jena works. Schweinfurt was selected even though by then more than 35% of its production from the five factories there had been dispersed to other facilities.\n\nAdvance to Jena, Then Capture, Then Handover: on 2 April 1945 elements of the 90th Infantry forces of the U.S. Third Army under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr. (promoted to General on 14 April 1945) came upon the Kaiseroda salt mine near Merkers, a few miles inside the border of Thuringia. The mine was cleared on 4 April by a patrol of Company I, of the 3rd Battalion, 358th Infantry Regiment. This was found to house currency including: 98 million French francs, 2.7 billion Reichsmarks) and gold and coin including the entire gold reserves in 550 bags each of 55 to 81 lbs. totaling nearly 250 tons from the Reichsbank in Berlin (including 711 bags each filled with $25,000 in U.S. $20 gold coins). And as silent testament to victims of the Nazis there were stacks of valuables taken from those at the death camps: jewelry - wedding rings, watch cases, gold-filled glasses, teeth with gold and silver fillings, etc. For safekeeping from Germany there were some 400 tons of art, dozens of complex microscopes and other optical instruments made by Zeiss and others, along with plunder from conquered nations. The entire U.S. Army 712th tank Battalion and the 357th Infantry Regiment were diverted to guard the mine in preparation for removal of the items to the Reichsbank building in Frankfurt.\n\nIn possibly the only humorous aside to this tragedy was that on the morning of 12 April General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe, General Omar Bradley, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, Jr. and Major General Manton Eddy took the elevator ride 1600 feet down into the shaft. When reaching the bottom of the shaft the elevator doors opened to reveal one lowly Private on guard duty stumbling while rising to salute, in the tomblike stillness that soldier was heard to mutter “Jesus Christ!”\n\nRight: U.S. Army General Dwight D.

On 4 April 1945 U.S. Third Army forces captured Ohrdruf, a sub camp of the Buchenwald complex. On 11 April U.S. forces captured KZ Buchenwald, located only about 18 miles west-north-west of Jena. Here prisoners were assigned as slave labor to manufacture and assemble items including military equipment.\n\nAs a U.S. soldiers approached one of these camps prisoners were observed throwing binoculars over the fence to the passing GIs. One of these cased binoculars, in amazingly good and complete condition, was gifted to Company Seven's owner by family, the widow of a U.S. Army Major. This “liberated” Carl Zeiss rln 7x 50 binocular remains exhibited at our museum amongst other World War II military issue Zeiss binoculars. When gifted some four decades after the war we could not be certain this binocular was made or assembled at the prison camp, or whether it had simply been new stock at the camp, but the U.S. officer was there and that is how the widow recollected his explanation of how he acquired the binocular.\n\nOwing to the magnitude of the humanitarian catastrophe reinforcements were called, and on the next day the U.S. Army 80th Infantry Division arrived at Buchenwald. Allied soldiers were stunned by what they observed, they became angered at the Nazi SS associated with these camps and those who enabled them. On 12 April, after visiting Kaiseroda these top Generals visited Ohrdruf; after touring the camp General Eisenhower wrote in part:\n\n“I have never at any other time experienced an equal sense of shock.”\n\nWeimar, then Jena was next: the U.S. Third Armys VIII Corps continued its advance through Thuringia supported by the U.S. Army Air Forces. Morale was reportedly at its highest since their campaign in September 1944 through Luxembourg. But some of the most tenacious, even ruthless fighting was still ahead, and this would cause more needless deaths with damage to civilian homes and infrastructure. Some people faced the realities: at 9:15 on the morning of 12 April the Burgermeister (Mayor) of Weimar accepted the U.S. Army surrender ultimatum and the 2nd Battalion of the 319th Infantry Regiment moved in to occupy the city by 13:25. Weimar was spared what could have been; it was the last major city, and only about an 11 miles drive west, on the path to Jena.\n\nThe U.S. Army code for the city Jena was J7082. J7082 was assigned to the 317th and 319th Infantry Regiments, 80th Infantry Division. After Weimar surrendered the U.S. Army sent a German Ordnungspolizei Oberst (Colonel of Police) from Weimar to Jena conveying a surrender ultimatum however, Jena declined (authors opinion here - those in charge at Jena were not just nuts, but f'ing nuts!) The nearly 6,200 battle hardened soldiers and officers of these U.S. Army combat teams, supported by their artillery, tanks, and U.S. Army Air Force too would ensure that by 3 pm on 13 April any resistance in Jena would either have surrendered or been destroyed.\n\nAs parts of a U.S. Army battle summaries convey (dates adjusted one day forward, this actually commences 12 April after Weimar surrendered):\n\nThe 319th (Infantry Regiment) 2nd Battalion was relieved by the 2nd Battalion of the 317th (Infantry Regiment) at 1700 hours, and moved to GRETSCHWABHAUSEN (J6366) (Großschwabhausen, about 4 miles west of Jena) north of and abreast of the 319th 1st Battalion which had advanced without opposition by motor to GOTTERN (J6261) (Göttern) where it had dismounted and made preparation for the attack on JENA (J7082). The 3rd Battalion on the south had advanced without opposition to NIEDERSYNDERSTEDT (J6060) (about 7 miles west of southern Jena) where it prepared to cross the Saale River with CCR (Combat Command Reserve forces) of the 4th Armored Division, over a bridge to be erected by the CCA (Close Combat Attack forces) during the day at MAUA (J7159).\n\nThe 1st Battalion in the meantime waited for the 2nd Battalion to come abreast on its left flank, sent the I and R platoons to check the woods screening it from JENA. The I and R platoons fired a volley of MG (machine-gun) fire into the woods and 40 PWs (prisoners of war) came out. A squad of Inf then went with the I and R platoons and checked DOBREISCHEN (J6364) (Döbritschen) which was unoccupied. The squad of infantry was left to hold it as this was to be the LD (line of departure) for the planned night attack of the 1st Battalion on JENA.\n\nColonel Costello briefed the 1st and 2nd Battalion COs on the plan which was for the 1st Battalion to strike straight into Jena from the east, while the 2nd Battalion from GRETSCHWABHAUSEN (J6366) swept the woods southwest of JENA to the Saale River. The 1st Battalion with B Company leading, and A and C companies echeloned to the right rear, attacked at midnight, but the attacking elements ran into a defended roadblock at (J677667) after it had left DOBREISCHEN and Captain R Scott, CO of Company B, was killed so the attack was called off for the evening (and a defensive perimeter established). The attack (on Jena) was postponed until the dawn of 13 April.\n\nThe 319th 1st and 2nd (Battalions) attacked at first light (07:30), and after fighting small arms - Panzerfaust, bazooka and sniper fire, the 1st got to the town at 130930 April (9:30 am on 13 April). The 2nd (Battalion) had swept to the S through the woods and was checking the small towns that lie around Jena, and was entering the city from the south to make contact with the 1st Battalion, before crossing the Saale River.\n\nWhen the attack commenced soldiers of the 319th 1st and 2nd Battalions encountered what was described as “strong resistance in the steep wood approaches to Jena“ but by 11:30 the 1st Battalion had cleared all resistance to the west of Jena and entered the city.\n\nThe 319th 1st Battalion fought through Jena during the day in house to house combat. The 80th Infantry Division left one battalion of the 317th infantry to maintain law and order in ERFUT which fell on 121900 April (7 pm, 12 April), and moved up two battalions of the 317th Infantry, to aid in the reduction of Jena (J7082). The 1st and 3rd Battalions, 317th Infantry, struck it from the north, while the 2nd Battalion 319th Infantry, relieved in WEIMAR, skirted the town from the N and blocked the eastern approaches to JENA which was reduced at 131500 Apr. (3 pm, 13 April).\n\nAnother combat report, this one from the 317th that attacked Jena with the 319th, mentions on 13 April “relieved elements of 4th Armored Division in GERA...maintained law and order in JENA...scattered resistance encountered in clearing Jena east of the SAALE River; captured Approx. 250 PWs.” On the 14 April the 317th Regiment recorded in parts “relieved elements of the 319th in JENA...mopped-up areas in vicinity of GERA, JENA and EISENBERG; captured Approx. 900 PWs, including a Brig General, with his staff of four Officers”\n\nThe 3rd Battalion 319th Infantry, in reserve at NIEDERSYNDERSTEDT, was alerted to move forward after Division had called (131630 Apr) and ordered elements of the 319th to take over a bridge from the armor over the Autobahn in the vicinity of GOSHWITZ (J7160). Colonel Costello went forward and made arrangements with the C/S 4th Armored Division to move his motorized infantry units forward (3rd Battalion) on the S part of the Autobahn while CCR, which was following CCA on the southern portion of the 4th Armored Division right flank, used the northern double lane. The 3rd Battalion moved forward on the southern portion leaving one squad at GOSCHWITZ (Göschwitz, south end of Jena) and one Co (company) of Infantry at the Autobahn CR (J8961). The remainder of the Battalion moved into the vicinity of (K0265) north of GERA (26 miles east of Jena) and relieved elements of the 4th Armored Division along the Autobahn, and over the Autobahn bridge (K032654) over the WEISE ELSTER River north of GERA. The Regiment then planned to seize GERA while the 4th Armored Division continued its drive to the east.\n\nThe 1st Battalion had in the meantime cleared JENA and was sent in trucks along the Autobahn to TOPPELN (K0063) (Töppeln, about 20 miles east of Jena) where it arrived at 132300 Apr (11 pm, 13 April) and was instructed that its mission would be to clear out the woods lying to the W of GERA.\n\nAbout a mile or two beyond eastern Jena U.S. forces came upon a quarry near Großlöbichau where 37 prisoners from a Buchenwald concentration camp were found shot to death. They had been among thousands of prisoners being evacuated by the SS, but their train was attacked by allied aircraft and in the disruption they were among many who had escaped. Some were helped by locals, while some were captured by or turned over the the local Jena Volkssturm Bataillon (battalion of usually ineffectual citizen militia). Paul Müller, a teacher by trade, was then the Nazi Party District Leader of Jena. Soon after this Müller would die fighting the US Army. Criminal trials held later under Soviet occupation determined the Jena Volkssturm murdered those 37 prisoners on 12 April 1945. Three monuments, in the area and at the quarry, commemorate the massacre.\n\nWhile parts of the city of Jena were obliterated by air bombardment and some by combat operations, the Carl Zeiss factory had sustained what the U.S. Army accounts described as “surprisingly little effective bomb damage”. By then the original large planetarium test dome was gone, even though nearby on another rooftop the telescope observatory dome remained intact.\n\nBetween 1894 and the end of World War II Carl Zeiss Jena had produced some 2,260,000 binoculars for military and civilian use.\n\n“Operation Paperclip”, and then Partition: the Yalta agreement fashioned between the allies political leadership had predetermined that Germany would be partitioned into four zones, each under control of a major ally: England, France, Russia, and the U.S.A. All of the Carl Zeiss facilities except the Contessa works in Stuttgart (then occupied by the French, but designated for U.S. control) were in what would become the Russian zone of occupation. And so the U.S. military forces at Jena proceeded to evacuate manufacturing assets and documents over the course of several days.\n\nAt least some foreign laborers went with the U.S. Third Army to act in capacities such as “member-translator” of outfits such as the “Civic Affairs Team TA-4” traveling as far east as Vimperk (Winterburg), Czechia. With the rapid advances into areas being newly occupied the letter of the law or procedures were not always adhered to; just imagine running into a person in U.S. Army uniform carrying a carbine and bearing a Dutch passport!\n\nHowever, with the end of the Third Reich in sight the advancing allied forces would discover interesting products of German research and development efforts in many areas including optics. Among these was the “liberation” of two of the probable three or more “Doppelfernrohr” (double telescope) 20 + 40x 200 mm binoculars completed by Carl Zeiss Jena in 1944 or possibly 1945. Each refractive system incorporates 45 degree inclined wide-angle eyepieces providing 2.25 and 4.5 degrees actual field of view. Each binocular weighs about 460 lbs (209 kg), and with stand may have weighed about 1200 lbs! One instrument remains in the United Kingdom, the other (serial number 3) is property of the Smithsonian Institution Naval Historical Museum. After sitting in a warehouse for some fifty years, the U.S. example underwent a comprehensive restoration by the late Mr. Kevin Kuhne in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Since there was no appreciable interest to display them the U.S.A., the restored example was loaned by the U.S. people to the custody of the Wehrtechnischen Studiensammlung (Defense technical study collection) military museum in Koblenz, Germany where they are now on proper display.\n\nThe Americans “Operation Paperclip” was a classified program, where they compiled a list of German people who were determined to have value to the allies, and who would be subject to evacuation to the west as the area was transferred to Soviet occupation. Among the most vital staff of Carl Zeiss Jena to be evacuated were: Professor Dr. Ing. Walther Bauersfeld (b. 1879, d. 1959) Scientific Head with the company since 1908, Dr. Ing. Heinz Kuppenbender, Professor Dr. Joos, Paul Henrichs, who with about 130 engineers and technicians were evacuated to western Germany occupied by allied forces to what would become the Federal Republic of Germany. These also included 41 employees from Schott, and some 200 from the University of Jena. American officials advised the evacuees (reportedly in an early version of “make them an offer they can not refuse”) that they would be moved to the American Zone of occupation. There are accounts that some went voluntarily, while others were given no choice. U.S. Army trucks were assigned to move the families who were afforded only enough time to pack a suitcase. The 65 year old Frau Bauersfeld was allowed to take (as a last minute concession) one armchair for the long ride in the back of the truck. Months later, with the help of a neighbor and some luck one of Prof. Bauersfelds daughters moved the family Steinway piano from Jena on a railway car to Heidenheim. Carl Zeiss Administrator Joos later went on to the United States.\n\nWith the U.S. forces scheduled to withdraw in compliance with the Yalta agreements, a final meeting to coordinate the handover to Soviet Union forces was held on 30 June at Wiesbaden between U.S. Army Lieutenant General Wade H. Haislip and Marshal of the Soviet Union General Vasily I. Chuikov. General Chuikov was a combat-hardened leader who had personally developed tactics to minimize the strengths of the German Wehrmacht at the defense of Stalingrad, he later accepted the unconditional surrender of German forces from General Helmuth Weidling in Berlin on 2 May 1945. Shortly afterwards the remaining U.S. military forces commenced departing Thuringia and headed west. On 1 July the Soviet advance military forces arrived in Jena, there was some overlap with U.S. Army forces, until by midnight 4 July when the Soviet troops occupied the remainder of what became East Germany (German Democratic Republic) including Jena. A new Mayor was appointed for Jena, as the Soviet authorities set up a antifaschistische Komite (anti-fascist committee) to root out Nazi sympathizers and insure those in authority implemented the Soviet agenda.\n\nThe Russian forces and their representative demanded and obtained the best of what could be provided in terms of facilities, accommodations, and any remaining stocks of supplies. As was mentioned by the soon to be appointed new Mayor of Jena in his diary entry of 9 July:\n\n“it is noteworthy that the Americans issued laws, ordinances and proclamations, mostly ordered by number,\n\nwhile the Russians, at any rate, have so far only issued \"orders\".”\n\nResurrection - The Post World War II Zeiss Companies East And West:\n\nWithin as little a few weeks after the fighting concluded, some Carl Zeiss Jena facilities were back at work. The Contessa works at Stuttgart resumed production of Ikonta and Nettar film cameras. German military and civilian optics of the period remain among the most sought after “war trophies” taken home by occupying forces. To this day many people believe their grandfathers undocumented binoculars were the personal Zeiss field glasses of the famous Wehrmacht Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. We cannot count how many German Kriegsmarine tugboat or auxiliary binoculars are out there today being marketed as those employed by sailors of the highly respected U-Boat forces.\n\nAt Dresden, the Contax rangefinder camera manufacturing dies, parts, and equipment along with some staff were transported to Kiev. In part the Russians, and some other allies too, wanted to emasculate Germany and gather whatever reparations they could against a Nazi Germany that had decimated Russias population (even if less so than Stalin). Furthermore, the Russian well-founded fear of possible further conflict with the western nations rendered relocating any production capability into a more defensible Soviet province a logical strategic step.\n\nThe abrupt end of the war left manufacturers in Germany, as in the United States and elsewhere, sitting on hodgepodge stocks of military hardware, spare parts, and stocks of new parts awaiting assembly. Soon after the war elements of Carl Zeiss gradually returned to manufacturing. Initially their items were made for the civilian market, these tended to be items they had manufactured prior to the war that could be afforded by occupying soldiers for example. In time Zeiss would return to manufacturing for export and for military markets too. The initial post war production inventory coming out of the various Carl Zeiss Jena facilities commenced as early as late 1945, these included photographic cameras, lenses, and binoculars.\n\nIn the case of binoculars for example, those produced soon after the war were basically military models cobbled together from stock of parts left over from the war. The individual focus binocular models, including 8x 30, 7x 50, 10x 50, etc., were nearly identical to those made before May 1945 that would have borne the simple armaments code mark “rln”. The post war models were in fact identical other than their left side prism housing now bore the pre war Carl Zeiss Jena logo, and the consumer oriented models lacked any integrated measuring reticle. For the first year or two of production many of the binoculars assembled used existing wartime stocks of painted prism housings and objective tube barrels, instead of being covered with the pebble grain leather covering as had been typical of production models from before the war and through the later years of the war.\n\nThe Soviets ordered the inventorying of all personal, business and civic assets in their occupied zones. Banks were closed, deposit boxes forced opened and all were confiscated including family personal mementos. In their version of Operation Paperclip, persons deemed valuable to Soviet enterprises were identified for relocation, some in Germany used the term for kidnapped, to the Soviet Union. By the Summer of 1946 the decisions of what companies would be confiscated had been decided. By 11 October 1946 the dismantling of manufacturing equipment at Carl Zeiss Jena and Glas-fabrik Schott too had commenced, as was mentioned by one who observed it “down to the elevators and window fittings”. By about one year later the Soviets had completed packing and evacuating much of the remaining technical and management staff, and about 92% of the Carl Zeiss Jena manufacturing facilities to the east and well into Russia. This became the basis for the development of several Russian and Ukrainian optical companies that prosper to this day. Other German manufacturing assets were also confiscated under the reparations provisions and these resulted in the gutting of many factories, mostly in the Russian occupied zone.\n\nTwo Zeiss Companies: while Carl Zeiss Jena was reorganizing under Soviet control, and before West Germany was formally established as a republic, the “Zeiss Stiftung von Jena” (Zeiss foundation) was established at Heidenheim, with the “Opton-Optische Werstatte Oberkochen GmbH” (abbreviation of Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, akin to a limited liability corporation in the United States) factory located at Oberkochen on the banks of the Kocher River, near the city of Stuttgart in the State of Baden-Württemberg. The Schott Glass Works subsidiary was located at Mainz, the capital of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. The most important provisions of the organization were:\n\nThe Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung is the sole owner of Carl Zeiss and Schott Glaswerke\n\nFinancial resources must be obtained independently by Zeiss Stiftungs own efforts\n\nNo external influences e. g. by private persons, and no capital from external sources or the government\n\nBy 1947 the enterprise at Oberkochen was doing business as “Zeiss-Opton-Optische Werstatte Oberkochen GmbH”. Soon, the Hensoldt facilities at Wetzlar resumed production, while microscope production resumed at the Winkel factory at Göttingen, and eyeglass production in Aalen. On 3 March 1948 the transfer of Zeiss Ikon headquarters from Dresden to Stuttgart was formalized. In 1951 the Zeiss Ikon factory facility at Stuttgart would be about doubled in size to accommodate the headquarters and production operations.\n\nShortly after the war Carl Zeiss, Inc. in the United States resumed the import of products from both Zeiss Jena and Zeiss Oberkochen. And by 1960 the U.S. based Zeiss company was again fully owned by Carl Zeiss GmbH of West Germany. Dr. Bauersfeld continued to work there until he passed away in 1959 at age 80!\n\nWhile Jena had already resumed the manufacture of some products it was on 1 July 1948 that the East Germans, now independent of Carl Zeiss Oberkochen, formally reorganized the original factory in Jena as a state-owned corporation to be known as “V.E.B Carl Zeiss Jena” (Volks Eigene Betrieb translating to peoples owned operation) under Dr. Hugo Schrade. The reorganized Carl Zeiss Jena under the direction of the East German government gradually resumed production of microscopes, measuring instruments, astronomical telescopes, photographic lenses, military optics.\n\nBy 1949 in Dresden cameras such as the Contax II single lens reflex with a new 42mm threaded mount, and camera lenses such as the “Sonnar” were in production with all internal and external air to glass surfaces being “T” anti-reflection coated. The occasional similarity of appearance, of design, and the interchange ability of Zeiss Jena and Zeiss Oberkochen components such as components for microscopes, and cameras was more than by accident. For example, some binoculars marketed by Carl Zeiss Oberkochen (bearing the trademark “Optron”) were actually made under contract by Carl Zeiss Jena.\n\nAs diplomatic relations between East and West were closing, both Zeiss companies sought out new sources. During the time up to about 1952 there were hopes for a German reunification and so the Zeiss counterparts actually worked to help each other recover to some degree. The hopes for reunification were dashed as the East German political leadership assumed firm control of all commercial enterprises; from now until reunification the Communist Party and its system of promotion by political achievement (which selected the top management) would determine the course of company policy.\n\nBy 1954 the Zeiss Jena works had reestablished their ability to produce world-class planetarium projectors, the first completed unit being delivered in 1954 to the Volgograd Planetarium in Russia.\n\nOne interesting experiment at diversification by Jena occurred in the mid 1950s; Carl Zeiss Jena produced four variants of a model two-cycle diesel engine (“Aktivist”) for hobbyist applications in model cars, planes, and boats! In 1956 Zeiss introduced the “Jena Review”, their own publication to highlight their accomplishments in a manner similar to the “Zeiss Information” published by the West. In another footnote, by 1956 Carl Zeiss Jena binocular production was moved from the Jena works about eight miles to the east nearby to Eisfeld, still in the State of Thuringia.\n\nIn West Germany camera and camera lens production were underway at the “Contessa” camera factory in Stuttgart. In May 1950 at the Photokina camera show, Zeiss introduced their new “Contax IIa” 35mm rangefinder camera bearing the “Zeiss Ikon Stuttgart” mark.\n\nBy 1953 it could be argued that microsurgery was rendered possible with Zeiss Oberkochen surgical microscopes. In 1953 Oberkochen introduced a publication “Zeiss Information” to highlight the latest innovations at Zeiss.\n\nIn 1954 the Oberkochen facility produced its first binocular: an innovative very compact 8x30mm Porro Prism model made possible in part by their development of the air spaced objective. In 1958 Zeiss Oberkochen introduced an improved wide angle eyepiece designed by Horst Kohler and Helmut Knutti; designated by the binocular model designation suffix “B” (for Brillentrager spectacle wearer) this allowed persons wearing prescription spectacles or sunglasses to see the field of view with none or little vignetting. Also in 1956 they developed a new flexible gasket system for their central focus binoculars which substantially improved the sealing of the interior optics against dust, dew, light rain.\n\nBy 1954, Carl Zeiss Oberkochen had acquired a majority stock holding in Hensoldt, so by 1964 Zeiss relocated all binocular production to its Hensoldt subsidiary works in Wetzlar. In 1968 Hensoldt became a fully owned member of the Carl Zeiss Oberkochen group. To this day, binoculars and riflescopes made there bear either the Zeiss or Hensoldt trademarks - the Hensoldt trademarked labeling being reserved primarily for products destined to industry, or the military and law enforcement markets.\n\nIn another footnote, by 1956 Carl Zeiss Jena binocular production was moved from the Jena works about eight miles to the east to their new factory at Eisfeld, still in the State of Thuringia.\n\nAmong new facilities at Eisfeld were those opened in 1961 for the manufacture of synthetic optical crystals. These materials were vital for the fabrication of optical components within microscopy, astronomy, photography, medical and laser technologies. One of the important products to come from this investment was the growth of high quality Calcium Fluoride crystals. These were synthesized, eventually by both Zeiss companies, employing the Stockbarger process, a process that takes weeks to show results.\n\n* the offerings diversity and capacity too gradually increased so that by 1991 Jena offered at least 19 different materials grown from melts and solutions, having made something on the order of 250 tons of materials in its recent thirty years of production.\n\nAround the world many industrial fabricators too were jumping onto the synthetics bandwagon, especially those making optics for work into extended regions of the spectrum including the ultra-violet. It was becoming easier to fabricate lenses with these synthetics. In a parallel tack, glass makers worked to develop newer Fluorocrown (or fluorine crown) glass types that more closely rivaled the optical properties of Calcium Fluoride, and that would be easier to fabricate into lenses.\n\nBeginning in 1962 space missions are flown with Zeiss optics; Jena providing for Russia, and Oberkochen the West. And now the unified Carl Zeiss continues to do so to this very day.\n\nBy 1963 Carl Zeiss Jena was also manufacturing numeric measuring systems for the precise measurement of angles and length.\n\nBinocular innovation by Carl Zeiss at Oberkochen and Wetzlar continued with the introduction of an even more compact in line Schmidt (or Pechan) prism design for binoculars in 1964 bearing the trademarked “Dialyt” designation. While Zeiss had a tradition of offering “theater glasses” (low magnification, compact binoculars for use at concerts, etc.) dating back to before World War I, it was in the early 1960s that Zeiss introduced high quality pocket size “compact binoculars”, that could fit easily in to a shirt pocket; the first being an 8x20mm model introduced in 1969.\n\nAbove: Postage Stamp issued by DDR celebrating Carl Zeiss Jena accomplishments from 1846 to 1971.\n\nMulticoatings and Phase Correction Coatings: going back to the early years of World War II researchers at Bausch & Lomb were working to develop improved antireflection coatings. Soon after the war all major optical companies were applying the single layer magnesium fluoride coatings to their consumer optics, but even higher transmission and a capacity to optimize coatings for specific applications was sought. By the early 1950's multiple layer coatings for optics were developed that improved light throughput, resistance to ghosting, and overall contrast. By controlling the type of and thickness of element layers being deposited onto the glass surface then the coating laboratory could optimize the band pass of light to suit preferences: if birders prefer truer colors then a coating formula biased for that a more uniform transmission across the visible spectrum could be applied, if a photographic film camera lens was to be marketed for those who prefer black and white film to enhance contrast then a yellow-biased coating could be devised.\n\nMultiple layer antireflection coatings (multi coatings) were developed early in the 1960s that improved light throughput, resistance to ghosting, and overall contrast; Most were not as durable as Magnesium-Fluoride single coatings; Company Seven exhibits an early prototype Zeiss West German camera lens incorporating distinctive early multi coatings that could, with accidental abrasion or even with poor cleaning techniques, be removed. The first commercially successful multi coatings that were more durable consisted of three layers, introduced in 1965 these were termed Broadband and continue to be applied even today for some optics.\n\nRight: Carl Zeiss photographic camera lenses exhibited at Company Seven include 1. an uncoated Carl Zeiss Jena Tessar 180mm f/4.5 of 1937, 2. Carl Zeiss Jena Pancolor 50mm f/1.48 of ~1967, known as 'Zebra Lens' owing to the metal trim, a raw glass made with Thorium radioactive metal provides the yellowish tinted lens, this is MgFl coated, and 3. incompleted Carl Zeiss (West German) Sonnar 50 mm f 1.5 lens with early multicoatings of ~1956, note this is not yet labeled with the red T (247,599 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view (1,766,530).\n\nSome special purpose optics continued to be produced with lenses uncoated - with no antireflection coatings, these include the ultraviolet transmitting Carl Zeiss UV-SONNAR 105 f4.3 lenses made for Hasselblad cameras; hence they bear no T designation.\n\nIn 1972 Carl Zeiss of West Germany announced at Photokina in Cologne their improved multilayer antireflective coatings technology for lenses, filters, binoculars and other consumer optical products; these optics bear the T* designation, and resulted in a transmission of more than ninety (90) percent of the visible light entering a binocular for example.\n\nIn 1988 Carl Zeiss West Germany introduced Phase Correction Coatings on all their production roof prism model binoculars. As light passes through glass, depending on type and arrangement it is possible that not all the wavelengths are transmitted uniformly; this results in a phase shifting of their position to either before, at, or beyond the focal plane. Phase Correction Coatings facilitate a more uniform throughput of light across a wide portion of the visual spectrum, thereby resulting in further improvements of resolution and contrast by systems incorporating roof prisms. The Carl Zeiss optics that feature this will bear the red T*P designation. Later this was changed for marketing purposes only, to T*P*; this later designation meant nothing about any change of performance.\n\nLeft: Carl Zeiss Germany 8x 56 B/GA Dialyt with the later T*P* roof prism binocular exhibited at Company Seven. Notice the “Made In Germany” labeling reveals this was produced by Carl Zeiss after the reunification of Germany in 1990 (34,262 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view showing the complete binocular view (176,153).\n\nIncidentally, phase shift does not impact astronomical telescopes as we do not tend to employ components with roof prisms.\n\nBy the 21st century almost every new top-line optical product incorporated some version of these features, as applicable, so in 2015 Carl Zeiss phased out the use of the T* and T*P* labeling. Some of their products that had the coatings never bore the designation at all, such as their 20x 60S Stabilized Binocular, but as their newer series of sporting optics came were announced the coatings designations were deleted from product naming and labeling.\n\nMarketing Philosophies, and Litigation:\n\nIn the early 1970s tensions between the two firms between the two firms peaked, as they seemed to between East and West nations, with each of both Zeiss companies claiming the exclusive rights to the patents, trademarks and traditions of “Carl Zeiss”. This culminated in a series of legal battles around the globe, among these was one resolved in the U.S. Supreme Court granting rights to the name “Zeiss” solely to the West German Zeiss firm. As a result of court decisions and marketing agreements for products sold in the United States, the trademark “ZEISS” or “CARL ZEISS” appeared only on products manufactured by Carl Zeiss based in Oberkochen, West Germany.\n\nAbove: the bold logo of Zeiss West Germany products, employed from about 1972 until 1991. Afterwards, the East German products manufactured by the Jena firm were marketed in the United States only under the “aus JENA”, “JENOPTIK”, or “JENOPTIK JENA” trademarks. The original “CARL ZEISS JENA” trademark appeared on East German products sold in the former communist block nations, in Canada, England, and in some other countries. Adding to the confusion, in some countries both trademarks were recognized. However, both East and West companies continued to employ the name “Carl Zeiss” throughout the postwar era until the reunification of 1990 wherever possible.\n\nCarl Zeiss Jena continued to rely on a far less sophisticated network of independent agents. Zeiss Jena maintained an office in New York City, with distribution of microscopes (and incidentally - planetarium instruments) through Seiler Instruments, a private company in St. Louis, Missouri. In North America their binoculars and microscopes were marketed as aus Jena products through Europtik Ltd., a company in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. Their surveying instruments including Theodolites were marketed through yet another firm in Florida. In terms of ownership these firms were completely independent of Carl Zeiss Jena, and of one another.\n\nThe director of Carl Zeiss West Germany was quoted in a “Wall Street Journal” newspaper interview as stating that western style marketing “simply doesnt exist” in the east, “everything that is produced is dictated by the plan”. Yet by 1989 Carl Zeiss Jena was the largest of East Germanys 120 state owned corporations (Kombinate). However, Zeiss employees in the east worked an average of six (6) more hours per week at less than half the salary of a western worker. The eastern technology was falling behind the west, now being relatively primitive and too inefficient to compete in a modern economy. While the western facilities were more automated, energy efficient, and more ecologically sound in terms of worker conditions and production of waste materials.\n\nThe value of the western currencies continued to figure prominently in what success the eastern products enjoyed in the west. In a few areas the wests relatively higher labor costs and regulatory demands were also a handicap in competition against the east, although after the reunification Germany would begin exporting some manufacturing jobs (automobile manufacturing, etc.) to third world economies (such as the U.S.A.).\n\nCarl Zeiss of West Germany continued to develop precise electro-optical equipment for distance and height measurements that found applications in sports events; their Recording Electronic Tachemeter measuring systems and their variants were used at international sports since 1970 events including the Olympic Games held in Munich in 1972 and those in Montreal in 1976.\n\nIn 1976 the West German Chancellor Schmidt presented the Carl Zeiss Oberkochen Mark IV Planetarium projector to the National Air and Space Museum “Einstein Planetarium” in Washington, D.C.. Among the invited guests were Ruth Van Hilst b. Bauersfeld daughter of the former head developer of Zeiss planetarium instruments. The Zeiss instrument remained one of the highlights at the most visited attraction in the United States.\n\nCarl Zeiss West Germany continued to set the world standards for microscopy in many areas. In 1973 Zeiss West Germany announced the first high precision UMM 500 3D coordinate measuring machine. In 1976 Zeiss announced the first microscopes specifically designed for the examination of living cells, these were the IM 35 and ICM 405. In 1982 Carl Zeiss West Germany announced the worlds first LSM Laser Scan Microscope - the quantum leap in microscopy. And then in 1984 a new era in electron microscopy was introduced, the EM 902 with energy filter.\n\nAll the while Carl Zeiss Jena too continued to make innovative products including electro-optical equipment for distance and height measurements in sports events including the Olympic Games of Moscow in 1980, at Los Angeles in 1984, and at Seoul in 1988. Also developed was the “Cosmorama” computer controlled planetarium projector in 1984, and later the “Fundus” camera and their workstations for ophthalmology.

Also developed was the “Cosmorama” computer controlled planetarium projector in 1984, and later the “Fundus” camera and their workstations for ophthalmology.\n\nIn 1979 a project commenced that would lead up to a 1985 landmark innovation in telescope lens technology. This his would bear a Carl Zeiss Jena trademark and be known as the “APQ”.\n\nAPQ Apo Telescopes:\n\nIn 1979 Dr. Jürgen Pudenz was optical designer at Carl Zeiss Jena, East Germany. He was assigned to the astronomical instruments division where he worked with Alfred Karnapp, both were amateur astronomers too. It was at the beginning of 1979 when they, Dr. Pudenz explained “received information from their colleagues in crystal growing that calcium fluoride disks of optically good quality were now available for large lenses diameter are available.” This prompted them to commence studies and development on what would eventually culminate in the APQ telescopes.\n\nThere were challenges beyond lens making to tackle. As mentioned previously, because the coefficient of expansion of Calcium Fluorite differs from that of conventional optical glass types, the large CF element needed for telescope lenses heretofore tended be air spaced arrangements. There were some prototypes made along the development path, and at least some were doublet AP f/10 air-spaced lenses of at least up to 130mm; these were flint-leading with the Calcium Fluorite being the inner element but their physical length and weight prompted the team to push further. The lens cell had to not only precisely hold the three lenses, but help the lenses compensate for temperature changes.\n\nThe final APQ design is a triplet arrangement with the Calcium Fluorite sandwiched between to other lenses. This required a new synthetic material to essentially oil the three lenses together, and this media was developed for Carl Zeiss Jena the University of Jena. The media had to accommodate temperature changes, and have long life. Another benefit was less light loss as coated or not, 'cemented' lenses lose nothing to reflections. The edges of the lens are sealed so this should not leak though Company Seven has seen this happen infrequently, this can be remedied. The same media was later adopted by others, most notably Astro-Physics Co. with which Zeiss Jena was developing a relationship with AP even providing custom Carl Zeiss Jena branded version of their 600E German Mount.\n\nThe combined efforts at Jena in Calcium Fluorite manufacturing, research into lens design, research to develop the media, then refining large element fabrication techniques, resulted in the Carl Zeiss Jena APQ telescopes being developed by and credited to Dr. Jürgen Pudenz and Alfred Karnapp; the APQ was published in 1985 with the labeling derived from AP for Apochromat, and Q is a German acronym for liquid.\n\nThe APQ series telescopes that Carl Zeiss Jena offered for sale initially were:\n\nAPQ 100/1000mm f/10\n\nAPQ 130/1000mm f/7.8\n\nAPQ 150/1200mm f/8\n\nLater added to the production line:\n\nAPQ 105/640mm f/6.1\n\nA few prototype APQ objectives were made in other apertures and focal lengths, possibly intended for use in compact astronomical telescopes or in the large binoculars then being manufactured at a Carl Zeiss Jena Eisfeld factory.\n\nThe APQ astronomical telescopes had some characteristics that made them less competitive to most who have experience with other telescope lines, not least of which were factors of cost and their weight. Their focus mechanism and accessory interchange system are cumbersome, and traditional wood crates were heavy. In the United States, Seiler Instruments represented Zeiss Jena Planetarium instruments, and they also marketed the APQ but did not gain much traction with sales.\n\nHowever, the APQ simply ran out of time as these were coming onto the market just as the communist nations were transitioning to democracy. These transitions harshly impacted Carl Zeiss Jena resulting in gutting reductions of staff and production capacity. Their astronomical products production would suffer accordingly. It was not long after the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification before representatives of Carl Zeiss West Germany, then based in Oberkochen, visited the traditional home of Zeiss to mull over what they might logically acquire or not of what was left in Jena. At its peak, Zeiss of East Germany employed about 200,000 employees; many of them would not be needed by the West German Zeiss company as they had developed their own manufacturing facilities. The Eisfeld binocular factory for example would be among those facilities not retained after the merger of the two Zeiss companies, so there went any potential need for APQ 80/500mm lenses. As the West was not manufacturing amateur oriented telescopes, some of the former Carl Zeiss Jena astronomy department staff were retained when the two Carl Zeiss companies merged.\n\nIt was not until 1992 that we at Company Seven saw any signs of some stability there, of some efforts to salvage and produce enough to keep the former Jena astronomy section viable - and we were hopeful.\n\nThe Carl Zeiss Jena APQ telescopes were always comparatively expensive because of the real costs as well as the overhead expenses of being produced by such a large concern. In fairness though, these were a bargain when they originated in East Germany at a time of a nonconventional economy. But after the merger of the two Zeiss companies, and the need to compete in a western economy where 'sink or swim' is the rule, the costs of former East German made products dramatically increased. If the APQ were now to bear the trademark of a unified Carl Zeiss, a first-rate western concern, then they would be priced accordingly.\n\nMartin at Company Seven analogized Zeiss's competitiveness in the amateur telescope market as:\n\n“General Dynamics or Boeing could make a great, high-tech bicycle;\n\nthese might cost one million dollars ($1,000,000.) each, but they would be fine bicycles.”\n\nThere was a window of time to gain feedback and refine the Zeiss Jena telescopes line. There were talks with others who were considering taking on distribution of Carl Zeiss Jena amateur oriented astronomical telescopes. Company Seven was in the loop, and we heard some fantastical prognostications originating from some optimists trying to get in with Zeiss with claims along the lines of “we can sell thousands of Zeiss telescopes because all those American doctors and researchers who learned on Zeiss microscopes will come flocking regardless of the telescope prices or competitiveness”. Company Seven was very well positioned to understand Apo demand and actual total sales in the USA, so we advised Zeiss Jena that some of those proposed marketing claims were simply nonsense. In February 1993 we met with the Manager of Carl Zeiss Jena's astronomical products production, and we provided some constructive feedback and considered the viability of the line in the US market.\n\nThe APQ telescopes were innovative in 1985 and were superbly crafted optically but owing to the effects of reunification, and changing priorities by Zeiss management their production would be discontinued in about 1997. A total of some 500 APQ lenses were produced including: 80 of the APQ 100/640mm, between 200 to 250 APQ 100/1000mm, 140 of the APQ 130/1000mm, and between 40 to 80 APQ 150/1200mm. There were some prototypes made in the APQ 80/500mm, rumored to be destined for the ASPECTEM binoculars, and 105/840mm too. The APQ 206/1665mm f/8 telescope that had been advertised were never produced before the astronomical telescope manufacturing group in Jena were decimated.\n\nRight: Carl Zeiss Jena “ASPECTEM” 20 to 50x Vario (zoom) 80mm, assembled at the former Carl Zeiss Jena, V.E.B. factory. This was one of their very last large binoculars produced. Company Seven was a retailer of Carl Zeiss Jena when this arrived new about 1991, complete with lightweight fitted Case and a lightweight alloy Field Tripod with geared center column. This set was retired to permanent exhibit Company Seven's showroom collection, it is the third generation of Carl Zeiss Jena 80mm binoculars that we have (101,900 bytes).\n\nClick on image to see enlarged view (356,332 bytes).\n\nGoing back to 1901 Carl Zeiss Jena had developed and produced their first photogrammetric instruments. The line, including stereo comparators, had been improved and produced until the end of World War II. Their production was resumed in 1949, basically continuing to produce what had been made up to and during the war. By the 1960s more resources were devoted to improving and updating these products, most notably to take advantage of modern electronics. These were again updated and expanded in the 1980s through at least 1988 with particular attention to improved aerial photography culminating in their LMK 1000 Aerial Camera of 1986, and other instruments adding multi-spectral capabilities and improved navigation.\n\nIn 1984 Carl Zeiss Jena introduced photogrammetric cameras and associated instruments into production. In 1986 the Carl Zeiss Jena company had resumed production of photographic cameras.\n\nIn 1988 Zeiss Oberkochen announced the “P-Coatings” (invented by Adolf Weyauch); a “phase correcting coating” applied to a surface of roof prisms. This corrected the phase shifts as light passes through the system resulting in a sharper and clearer image. This and other innovations continued culminating with the introduction in 1990 of the “Design Selection” series of compact binoculars.\n\nOn 1 June 1990 the “ROSAT” X-ray satellite was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. At the time it featured the worlds smoothest mirrors ever made, and was the largest X-ray telescope ever produced (83.4cm aperture). It conducted the first X-ray survey of all the skies.\n\nCarl Zeiss West Germany grew to become the worlds largest optics research and development firm with marketing organizations in at least 28 Western countries. It features state of the art microscopes, several of the worlds largest or most complicated telescopes, specialized scientific instruments, measuring instruments, military optics (including submarine periscopes), spectacle frames and lenses, rifle scopes, photographic lenses, cameras (“Contax” made under license by Yashica/Kyocera) and binoculars.\n\nLater in 1990 Carl Zeiss of Oberkochen, West Germany, announced their new 20x 60 S - the worlds first hand-held, mechanically stabilized binocular; this too was invented by Adolf Weyauch. A more compact 20x 60 S monocular version followed. This is a Zeiss-developed and patented device based on cardanic prism suspension mechanism that works with precision magnets, so the users motions result in movements of"
