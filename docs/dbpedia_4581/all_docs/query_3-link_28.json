        "text": "For much of the past two centuries German governments encouraged or even sponsored the construction of war monuments. By the turn of the twentieth century Germany was covered in more than a thousand such shrines, most of which had local or regional significance as places of annual celebration or commemoration. Government, media, and business all contributed to an elaborate hagiography of Germany's battles, war heroes, and martyrs, with monuments usually serving as the centerpieces. Millions of middle-class Germans attended or participated in commemoration ceremonies at war monuments all over the country, and/or filled their homes with souvenir trinkets, tableware, wall decorations, coffee-table books, and other quotidian items that reproduced images of the monuments or scenes from the events they memorialized.\n\n1 Maurice Halbwachs, On Collective Memory, trans.

See also his “Unvergessene Opfer für die Freiheit,” Heimatkalender Landkreis Rees 1960 (Rheinberg: Schiffer, 1959), as well as Wolfram von Wolmar, “Der tollkühne Opfergang des Majors Ferdinand von Schill,” Das Freie Wort 38 (September 19, 1959); and Günther Gieraths, “Handelte Schill auf eigene Faust?,” Zeitschrift für Heeres- und Uniformkunde 165–166 (1959).\n\n5 The most widely read version appeared in 1905 under the title Letters of a Young Bride from the Era of the German War of Liberation. The letters became the basis for another entire genre of patriotic fiction in the Imperial and Nazi periods: stories for girls about the brave German women of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n8 For correspondence, program brochures, media commentary, and photographs from these events I have depended upon the SAW. The documentary was not completed until 1939. It was titled Die Schillschen Offiziere and has unfortunately been lost.\n\n10 As above, I have used the (largely uncataloged) collections of the SAW and Prussian Museum to trace the story of the post-war industrial development plans and the ensuing debate about the monument.\n\n11 Although a public debate gradually developed for a decade regarding whether the July 20 conspirators were indeed heroes, public spaces were being named for them as early as 1949, the year in which the Scholl siblings also got their street in downtown (East) Berlin. By the time of the Wesel controversy, in 1953, CDU politicians increasingly referred to the conspirators as heroes. For a recent analysis of this phenomenon, see Tobias Baur, Das ungeliebte Erbe. Ein Vergleich der zivilen und militärischen Rezeption des 20. Juli 1944 im Westdeutschland der Nachkriegszeit (Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 2007).\n\n12 The commission lasted from the early 1950s through 1965, when Dr. Otto-Ernst Schüddenkopf presented a comprehensive report on 146 different national and international conferences that had been held on the subject. The UN's original mandate also contained seed money for what became the Georg-Eckart Institute for Schoolbook Research, in Braunschweig.\n\n13 Wesel had only a single mayor for the entire duration of the Third Reich. In those years, its primary claim to fame had been as the hometown of Hitler's foreign minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop.\n\n14 See, for instance, the front-page story by Karl-Heinz Reuber, “Soll das Denkmal der Schill'schen Offiziere einen anderen Standort bekommen?,” General-Anzeiger, May 22, 1954. For the proceedings of the meeting I used the records kept by the SAW: Nr. 2/9.\n\n17 The exact division of men is not clear. Not only do prisoner-counts vary in almost every account, but apparently another 100+ Schillschen who had been captured from various detachments and flying columns were finally collected by mid-June and joined the main group. See État des frais d'entretien et de surveillance des prisonniers du corps de Schill pour le mois de XXX 1809 by General Michaud, the commander at Magdeburg, in the GS-PK: V HA, Rep. 6 VI, N.17.\n\n24 The Vechelde-Blume correspondence in the NSLA (VI Hs 15 Nr. 41) deals with his arrangements with the director of the collections at Leyden. A portion of Vechelde's correspondence with the Dutch government can be found in NSLA: 19 A Neu, Nr. 131.\n\n31 NSLA: 175 N, Nr. 41. Mund's official title was “Spokesman for the Schill-Committee.” Regarding the Totenkopf, note the letter to Mund from the leader of another veterans' group on November 5, 1965, concurring with the pride in the symbol, noting that his unit had included such worthies as Rommel, Guderian, Hoth, and Höppner, and sketching out plans for their group to attend the next Volkstrauertag.\n\n32 Correspondence and papers of the veterans' groups who organized the events each year may be found in the NSLA: 175 N, Nr. 41 (through 1979), and Nr. 42 (for the more recent controversies and the redesign).\n\n35 Note the 1992 report of Human Rights Watch-Helsinki, titled Foreigners Out! Xenophobia and Right-Wing Violence in Germany. In some of the eastern Länder, however, left-wing extremists were every bit as much to blame, and allegations of police brutality and/or violence against foreigners committed by former Stasi officers spiked in 1990, particularly in Sachsen-Anhalt and the Land Brandenburg."
