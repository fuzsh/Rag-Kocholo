        "text": "If you want to stay away from them that's your prerogative. I'll continue to collect them\n\nThe medal is a war merit cross, but the ribbon on it is incorrect, here's a pic of the ribbon that goes with it\n\nReally??? Okay, thank you very much for that! I had no idea. I found the medal and pin at a flea market in a place called Bad Aibling, Germany, back in the early 90's.\n\nThese items (not sure how it is today) were very taboo back then. You had to ask the vendors if they had any WWII German military memorabilia. If they did, the items would always be in the back or covered up.\n\nIn WW2 era, Germanys top award where the Ritterkreuz/ Eichenlaub/ Schwerten/ Brillantan 27 receipients from the KreigsMarine/ Heer/ Waffen SS/ Luftwaffe.\n\nHowever many deserving men never received the top award.\n\nGunther Rall JG-52 (276 victories) only got the Swords Gerd. Barkhorn JG-52 (302 victories) same deal. So histories second and third top scorer where robbed of this award. Another raw deal was Panzer (Tiger) Ace Kurt Knispel 168 Soviet tanks/120 PAKS knocked out/ yet he never got the Knighs Cross. Reason, he had long hair/ beard/ never saluted officers!\n\nGerd Barkhorn/ girlfriend\n\nGunther Rall\n\nKurt Knispel (civilized shot) shows he got German Cross in Gold at least. The award system was like a graduated system. 1st award Iron Class 2nd. class 2nd/ Iron Cross First Class/ German Cross in Silver/ German Cross in Gold/ then came the Knights Cross/ add Oakleaves/ add Swords/ Diamonds.\n\nsame guy (unkept hippie look)\n\nExcellent post, @panzerman ! I’ve always had a fascination for military campaign and commemorative medals which are a numismatic cousin to world coins. I think many of them are quite beautiful. I’m afraid my German campaign medals are a bit lacking at this point but that could change in 2020 now that my interest has been rekindled.\n\nThat’s a very impressive collection, @atcarroll ! Thank you for posting. I really like the way you are displaying them. It’s great to see what other collectors are doing.\n\nThe highest award for valour was specially minted for \"the Eagle of the Eastern Front\" Oberst Hans-Ulrich Rudel.\n\nThis was the \"Golden Oakleaves\". He had already been awarded everything to the Diamonds.\n\nHe achieved all of this flying the obsolete JU-87 \"STUKA\"\n\nIn 1941 he started his career with a bang. His unit was ordered to sink Soviet Battleships which where shelling Finnish troops in Leningrad sector. He ended up sinking the Battleship \"Marat\" and the cruiser \"Kirov\" in Kronstadt harbour. By the ended of the War, he flew 2500 combat missions. Later in 1943, his Stuka was fitted with two 3.7cm. flak cannon/ dubbed the \"Cannon Bird\" . By May 45, he had knocked out 519 Soviet tanks. Amazingly, he shot down 11 Soviet fighters, flying a dive bomber. Also destroyed 150 artillery emplacements/ 70 landing craft, 800 other strategic targets. His legs where shot off by flak in 45/ yet he kept flying combat with artifical legs. He even climbed mountains/ played tennis after the War. He ended up In 1977 he married a 20 year lady, died of a heart attack in 1982. He did not smoke or drink, was very active all his life.\n\nHis plane museum coll.\n\n@Islander80-83, in 1969 I was making my way to Norway to study, a circuitous route through Europe, and stopped at Bad Aibling to try to see my cousin stationed there. Couldn’t notify him ahead of time (no cell phones). Got to the base, stood by his bunk and could only leave a message. The six girls with me were anxious to keep going. He had been in the movie theatre.\n\nWere you stationed there?\n\nI’ve appreciated this thread\n\nYes I was. I've been in that movie theater as well.\n\nAustrian Waffen SS Knight Cross winner Vincenz Kaiser served with the 2nd SS Panzer Division \"Das Reich\"\n\nHe ended up as Obersturmbannfuhrer = Colonel\n\nHe also was awarded :\n\nClose Combat Clasp in Gold\n\nInfantry Assault Badge in Silver\n\n4 Tank Destruction Badges=single handedly knocking out enemy tank with explosive charge\n\nWound Badge in Silver\n\nIn 1945 he served with 17th SS PanzerGrenadier Division, \"Gotz Von Berchtlingen\"\n\nHe was captured by US forces and on April 20/45 was beaten/ shot in detention camp.\n\nOn photo you can see all the different awards....also in the Waffen SS you can see the rank by right collar tab/ the left collar has the Nordic \"Siegruenen\""
