        "text": "Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, KG (February 19, 1594 – November 6, 1612), was the eldest son and heir apparent of King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland; and his wife Princess Anne of Denmark, the second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nHis name derives from his grandfathers: Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley; and King Frederik II of Denmark. Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright and promising heir to his father’s thrones.\n\nPrince Henry was born at Stirling Castle, Scotland, and became Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles, and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland automatically on his birth.\n\nKing James VI worried that the mother’s tendency toward Catholicism might affect the son. The child’s removal to Stirling caused enormous tension between Anne and James, and Henry remained there under the care of Mar’s family until 1603.\n\nKing James VI wrote a note to the Earl of Mar in June 1595 instructing him, in the event of his death, not to deliver Prince Henry to Anne of Denmark or the Parliament of Scotland until he was 18 and gave the order himself.\n\nKing James VI of Scotland became King James I of England and Ireland in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns and his family moved south. Anne of Denmark came to Stirling to collect her son, and after an argument with the Prince’s keepers, Marie Stewart, Countess of Mar and the Master of Mar, was allowed to take Prince Henry to Edinburgh on May 28. On the following Sunday Anne took him to St Giles Kirk in her famous silver coach. Anne and Henry arrived in England, at the fortified town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, on June 1.\n\nWith his father’s accession to the throne of England in 1603, Prince Henry at once became Duke of Cornwall. In 1610 he was further invested as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thus for the first time uniting the six automatic and two traditional Scottish and English titles held by heirs-apparent to the two thrones.\n\nThe prince’s popularity rose so high that it threatened his father. Relations between the two could be tense, and on occasion surfaced in public. At one point, they were hunting near Royston when James criticised his son for lacking enthusiasm for the chase, and initially moved to strike his son with his cane, but Prince Henry rode off. Most of the hunting party then followed the son.\n\nPrince Henry is said to have disliked his younger brother, Prince Charles, and to have teased him, although this derives from only one anecdote: when Prince Charles was nine years of age, Prince Henry snatched the hat off a bishop and put it on the younger child’s head, then told his younger brother that when he became king he would make Prince Charles Archbishop of Canterbury, and then Prince Charles would have a long robe to hide his ugly rickety legs. Prince Charles stamped on the cap and had to be dragged off in tears.\n\nPrince Henry died from typhoid fever at the age of 18, during the celebrations that led up to his sister Elizabeth’s wedding to Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate of the Rhine (The diagnosis can be made with reasonable certainty from written records of the post-mortem examination, which was ordered to be carried out in order to dispel rumours of poisoning.) It was reported that his last words were to ask for his sister Princess Elizabeth.\n\nAfter Henry’s death, the prince’s brother Charles fell ill, but he was the chief mourner at the funeral, which King James (who detested funerals) refused to attend. The body lay in state at St. James’s Palace for four weeks.\n\nOn December 17, over a thousand people walked in the mile-long cortège to Westminster Abbey to hear a two-hour sermon delivered by George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury. As Henry’s body was lowered into the ground, his chief servants broke their staves of office at the grave.\n\nPrince Henry’s death was widely regarded as a tragedy for the nation. According to Charles Carlton, “Few heirs to the English throne have been as widely and deeply mourned as Prince Henry.”\n\nHenry’s titles of Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay passed to Prince Charles, who until then had lived in Henry’s shadow. Four years later Prince Charles, by then 16 years old, was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.\n\nHad the Prince of Wales lived to succeed the thrones, he would have become King Henry IX of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nElisabeth of the Palatinate of the Rhine (December 26, 1618 – February 11, 1680), also known as Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate, or Princess-Abbess of Herford Abbey,\n\nElisabeth of the Palatinate of the Rhine was the eldest daughter of Prince-Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate of the Rhine (who was briefly King of Bohemia), and his wife Princess Elizabeth of England and Scotland the daughter of King James I-VI of England, Scotland and Ireland and his wife Princess Anne of Denmark.\n\nMuch of Elisabeth’s early life outside of her familial relations is unknown. After a short, unsuccessful reign in Bohemia, Elisabeth’s parents were forced into exile in the Netherlands in 1620. Elisabeth stayed with her grandmother Louise Juliana of Nassau in Heidelberg before moving to the Netherlands at the age of nine.\n\nElisabeth had a wide ranging education, studying philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, jurisprudence, history, modern and classical languages. Her siblings nicknamed her “La Grecque” (“The Greek”) based on her skill with the ancient language.\n\nElisabeth also studied the fine arts including painting, music and dancing. She may have been tutored by Constantijn Huygens.\n\nIn 1633, Elisabeth received a proposal of marriage from King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland. The marriage of the Palatinate of the Rhine would have been beneficial to the Palatine fortunes, but the king was a Catholic, and Elisabeth refused to convert from her Protestant faith in order to facilitate the marriage.\n\nEdward Reynolds dedicated his Treatise on the passions and the faculties of the soule of man (1640) to Elisabeth. Although the exact context of the dedication is unknown, the dedication suggests that Elisabeth had seen a draft of the work.\n\nIn 1642, Elisabeth read René Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy. Elisabeth of the Palatinate was a philosopher in her own right and best known for her correspondence with René Descartes. She was critical of Descartes’ dualistic metaphysics and her work anticipated the metaphysical concerns of later philosophers.\n\nIn 1646, Elisabeth’s brother, Prince Philipp of the Palatinate of the Rhine, killed a man in a duel. Elisabeth was sent to stay with family in Germany where she tried to interest professors in Descartes’ work.\n\nPrincess Elisabeth’s sister, Princess Sophie of the Palatinate of the Rhine, married Prince-Elector Ernst August of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1701 Princess Sophie was selected as the Protestant heiress to the throne of England under the Act of Settlement of 1701. Her son became King George I of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1660, Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in 1667 she became abbess of the convent. While the convent was Lutheran, Elisabeth was a Calvinist. Although the previous abbess (Elisabeth’s cousin) had also been a Calvinist, this difference in faith created some initial distrust.\n\nAs abbess, she presided over the convent and also governed the surrounding community of 7,000 people. While Elisabeth was abbess, the convent became a refuge from religious persecution for people and she welcomed more marginal religious sects, including the Labadists. When Robert Barclay’s father David was imprisoned, Elisabeth intervened and helped to get him released.\n\nElisabeth died on February 12, 1680. She was buried in the Abbey Church of Herford.\n\nElizabeth of England and Scotland (August 19, 1596 – February 13, 1662) was a member of the Royal House of Stuart and by marriage she was Princess -Electress of the Palatinate of the Rhine and briefly Queen of Bohemia as the wife of Friedrich V Prince-Elector of the Palatinate of the Rhine. Prince Friedrich’s selection for the crown by the nobles of Bohemia was part of the political and religious turmoil of the Thirty Years’ War. Since her husband’s reign in Bohemia lasted over one winter, she is called the Winter Queen.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth was born at Dunfermline Palace, Fife, on August 19, 1596 at 2 o’clock in the morning. Princess Elizabeth was the only daughter of James VI-I, King of Scotland, England, and Ireland, and his Queen, Anne of Denmark, second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nKing James rode to the bedside from Callendar, where he was attending the wedding of the Earl of Orkney. At the time of her birth, her father was King of Scotland, but not yet King of England. Named in honour of Queen Elizabeth I of England, her godmother, the young Elizabeth was christened on November 28, 1596 in the Chapel Royal at Holyroodhouse, and was then proclaimed by the heralds as “Lady Elizabeth”.\n\nDuring her early life in Scotland, Elizabeth was brought up at Linlithgow Palace, where she was placed in the care of Lord Livingstone and his wife, Eleanor Hay. A couple of years later the king’s second daughter, Margaret, was placed in their care as well. Elizabeth “did not pay particular attention to this younger sister”, as even at this young age her affections were with her brother, Prince Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales.\n\nDuring Princess Elizabeth’s childhood, unbeknownst to her, part of the failed Gunpowder Plot was a scheme to replace her father with her on the throne, and forcibly raise her as a Catholic.\n\nCourtship and marriage\n\nSuitors\n\nAs the daughter of a reigning monarch, the hand of the young Elizabeth was seen as a very desirable prize. Suitors came from across the continent and were many and varied. They included:\n\n1. Gustaf Adolph of Sweden, son of the King Carl IX of Sweden(and later successor King Gustaf II Adolph of Sweden).\n\n2. Friedrich Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.\n\n3. Prince Maurice of Nassau.\n\n4. Theophilus Howard, Lord Howard of Walden, later second Earl of Suffolk.\n\n5. Otto, Hereditary Prince of Hesse-Cassel, son of Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.\n\n6. Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont, King Felipe II of Spain’s nephew and heir to the Duke of Savoy.\n\n7. King Felipe III of Spain, newly widowed in 1611.\n\nEach suitor brought to the proposed marriage the prospect of power and greatness for the young Elizabeth.\n\nMarriage would cost Elizabeth her father and her father’s kingdom. When James VI of Scotland had succeeded to the English throne in 1603, England had acquired a new role in European affairs. Unlike the childless Elizabeth I, James, by simply “having children, could play an important role in dynastic politics”. The selection of Elizabeth’s spouse, therefore, had little to do with her personal preference and a great deal to do with the benefits the match could bring.\n\nMost of her suitors were rejected quickly for a variety of reasons. Some simply were not of high enough birth, had no real prospects to offer, or in the case of Prince Gustaf Adolph of Sweden, who on all other grounds seemed like a perfect match, because “his country was at war with Queen Anne’s native Denmark”. Furthermore, England could not face another religious revolution, and therefore the religious pre-requisite was paramount.\n\nThe man chosen was Friedrich V, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Friedrich was of undeniably high lineage. His ancestors included the kings of Aragon and Sicily, the landgraves of Hesse, the dukes of Brabant and Saxony, and the counts of Nassau and Leuven.\n\nHe and Elizabeth also shared a common ancestor in King Henry II of England. He was “a senior Prince of the Empire” and a staunch defender of the Protestant faith.\n\nCourtship\n\nFriedrich of the Rhine arrived in England on October 16, 1612, and the match seemed to please them both from the beginning. Their contemporaries noted how Friedrich seemed to “delight in nothing but her company and conversation”. Friedrich also struck up a friendship with Elizabeth’s elder brother, Prince Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales which delighted his prospective bride immensely.\n\nKing James did not take into consideration the couple’s happiness, but saw the match as “one step in a larger process of achieving domestic and European concord”. The only person seemingly unhappy with the match was Queen Anne due to her opinion that Prince Friedrich was not of sufficient noble birth.\n\nAs the daughter of a king, the sister of a king, the wife of a king, and the mother of a future king, Queen Anne also desired to be the mother of a queen. She is said to have been somewhat fond of Friedrich’s mild manner and generous nature but simply felt that he was of low stock.\n\nOn November 6, 1612 Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, died. His death took an emotional toll on Elizabeth, and her new position as second in line to the throne made her an even more desirable match. Queen Anne and those like-minded who had “always considered the Palsgrave to be an unworthy match for her, were emboldened in their opposition”. Elizabeth stood by Friedrich, whom her brother had approved, and whom she found to have the sentiments of a fine gentleman. Above all, he was “regarded as the future head of the Protestant interest in Germany”.\n\nMarriage\n\nThe wedding took place on February 14, 1613 at the royal chapel at the Palace of Whitehall and was a grand occasion that saw more royalty than ever visit the court of England. The marriage was an enormously popular match and was the occasion for an outpouring of public affection with the ceremony described as “a wonder of ceremonial and magnificence even for that extravagant age”.\n\nIt was celebrated with lavish and sophisticated festivities both in London and Heidelberg, including mass feasts and lavish furnishings that cost nearly £50,000, and nearly bankrupted King James. Among many celebratory writings of the events was John Donne’s “Epithalamion, Or Marriage Song on the Lady Elizabeth, and Count Palatine being married on St Valentine’s Day”. A contemporary author viewed the whole marriage as a prestigious event that saw England “lend her rarest gem, to enrich the Rhine”.\n\nTheir marriage proved successful, but after they left Bohemia they spent some time in exile in The Hague, while the Thirty Years’ War continued. After his death, she eventually returned briefly to England, at the end of her own life, during the Stuart Restoration of her nephew, and is buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nWith the demise of Elizabeth’s great niece, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, the last Stuart monarch in 1714, Elizabeth’s grandson by her daughter Sophia of Hanover succeeded to the British throne as King George I of Great Britain initiating the House of Hanover.\n\nJames VI and I (June 19, 1566 – March 27, 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from July 24, 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from March 25, 1603 until his death in 1625. Although he wanted to bring about a closer union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, both ruled by James in personal union.\n\nJames was the son of Queen Mary I of Scotland and her second husband, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. James was a great-great-grandson of King Henry VII of England and Lord of Ireland, through Margaret Tudor, his daughter and the older sister of Henry VIII, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones.\n\nJames was born on June 19, 1566 at Edinburgh Castle, and as the eldest son and heir apparent of the monarch he automatically became Duke of Rothesay and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. He was baptised “Charles James” or “James Charles” on December 17, 1566 in a Catholic ceremony held at Stirling Castle. His godparents were King Charles IX of France (represented by John, Count of Brienne), Queen Elizabeth I of England (represented by the Earl of Bedford), and Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (represented by ambassador Philibert du Croc). Mary refused to let the Archbishop of St Andrews, whom she referred to as “a pocky priest”, spit in the child’s mouth, as was then the custom.\n\nQueen Mary’s rule over Scotland was insecure, and she and her husband, being Roman Catholics, faced a rebellion by Protestant noblemen. During Mary’s and Darnley’s difficult marriage, Darnley secretly allied himself with the rebels and conspired in the murder of the queen’s private secretary, David Rizzio, just three months before James’s birth.\n\nLord Darnley was murdered on February 10, 1567 at Kirk o’ Field, Edinburgh, perhaps in revenge for the killing of Rizzio. James inherited his father’s titles of Duke of Albany and Earl of Ross. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on May 15, 1567 to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her. In June 1567, Protestant rebels arrested Mary and imprisoned her in Lochleven Castle; she never saw her son again. She was forced to abdicate on July 24, 1567 in favour of the infant James and to appoint her illegitimate half-brother James Stewart, Earl of Moray, as regent. This made King James VI of Scotland the third consecutive Scottish monarch to ascend to the throne as an infant.\n\nFour different regents governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he succeeded Queen Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch of England and Ireland, who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known as the Jacobean era, until his death in 1625.\n\nAfter the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617. James was ambitious to build on the personal union of Scotland and England to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan that met opposition in both realms. “Hath He not made us all in one island,” James told the English Parliament, “compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?”\n\nIn April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled “King of Great Britain” on legal grounds. In October 1604, he assumed the title “King of Great Britain” instead of “King of England” and “King of Scotland”, though Francis Bacon told him that he could not use the style in “any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance” and the title was not used on English statutes. James forced the Scottish Parliament to use it, and it was used on proclamations, coinage, letters, and treaties in both realms.\n\nHe was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the Plantation of Ulster and English colonisation of the Americas began.\n\nThroughout his youth, King James VI was praised for his chastity, since he showed little interest in women. After the loss of the Earl of Lennox, he continued to prefer male company. A suitable marriage, however, was necessary to reinforce his rule, and the choice fell on fourteen-year-old Anne of Denmark, younger daughter of Protestant King Frederik II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nPrincess Anne at age 14, married James at age 23. Shortly after a proxy marriage in Copenhagen in August 1589, Anne sailed for Scotland but was forced by storms to the coast of Norway. On hearing that the crossing had been abandoned, James sailed from Leith with a 300-strong retinue to fetch Anne personally in what historian David Harris Willson called “the one romantic episode of his life”. The couple were married formally at the Bishop’s Palace in Oslo on November 23. James and Anne returned to Scotland on May 1, 1590. By all accounts, James was at first infatuated with Anne and, in the early years of their marriage, seems always to have shown her patience and affection.\n\nThey had three children who survived infancy: Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who predeceased his parents; Princess Elizabeth, who became Queen of Bohemia; and James’s future successor, Charles I. Anne demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of Prince Henry and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.\n\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James’s reign in Scotland was the longest of any Scottish monarch. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the English Parliament. Under James, the “Golden Age” of Elizabethan literature and drama continued, with writers such as William Shakespeare, John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon contributing to a flourishing literary culture.\n\nJames himself was a prolific writer, authoring works such as Daemonologie (1597), The True Law of Free Monarchies (1598), and Basilikon Doron (1599). He sponsored the translation of the Bible into English later named after him, the Authorized King James Version, and the 1604 revision of the Book of Common Prayer. Anthony Weldon claimed that James had been termed “the wisest fool in Christendom”, an epithet associated with his character ever since.\n\nSince the latter half of the 20th century, historians have tended to revise James’s reputation and treat him as a serious and thoughtful monarch. He was strongly committed to a peace policy, and tried to avoid involvement in religious wars, especially the Thirty Years’ War that devastated much of Central Europe. He tried but failed to prevent the rise of hawkish elements in the English Parliament who wanted war with Spain. He was succeeded by his second son, King Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nAnne of Denmark (December 12, 1574 – March 2, 1619) was Queen consort of Scotland, England, and Ireland by marriage to King James VI-I.\n\nAnne of Denmark\n\nEarly life\n\nAnne was born on December 12, 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark to King Frederik II of Denmark and Norway (1534-1588) and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1557-1631)was the daughter of Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Princess Elizabeth of Denmark (a daughter of Frederik I of Denmark and Norway and Sophie of Pomerania). Through her father, a grandson of Elizabeth of Oldenburg, she descended from King Hans of Denmark.\n\nFrederik II, King of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Schleswig.\n\nAt Princess Anne’s birth King Frederik II needed of a male heir and had been hoping for a son. Queen Sofie did give birth to a son, Christian IV of Denmark, three years later.\n\nSophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nWith her older sister, Elizabeth, Anne was sent to be raised at Güstrow in the Holy Roman Empire by her maternal grandparents, Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1527-1603) and Duchess Elizabeth of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Crown Prince Christian was also sent to be brought up at Güstrow but two years later, in 1579, his father the King wrote to his parents-in-law, to request the return of his sons, Christian and Ulrich, (probably, at the urging of the Rigsråd, the Danish Privy Council), and Anne and Elizabeth returned with him.\n\nElizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nAnne enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself. Suitors from all over Europe sought the hands of Anne and Elizabeth in marriage, including King James VI of Scotland, who favoured Denmark as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner.\n\nKing James VI in 1586, aged twenty, three years before his marriage to Anne. Falkland Palace, Fife.\n\nJames VI’s other serious marriage possibility, though eight years his senior, was Princess Catherine de Bourbon (1559-1604) daughter of Queen Jeanne III d’Albret (1528-1572) and Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme, (1518-1562). Princess Catherine de Bourbon was the sister of the Huguenot King Henri III of Navarre (1553-1610), future Henri IV of France. A match between Catherine and James VI was favoured by Elizabeth I of England.\n\nCatherine de Bourbon of Navarre\n\nScottish ambassadors in Denmark first concentrated their suit on the oldest daughter, Elizabeth (1573-1625), but Frederik II had betrothed her to Heinrich-Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg promising the Scots instead that “for the second [daughter] Anne, if the King did like her, he should have her.”\n\nBetrothal and proxy marriage\n\nThe constitutional position of Sophie, Anne’s mother, became difficult after Frederik II’s death in 1588, when she found herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of her son King Christian IV. As a matchmaker, however, Sophie proved more diligent than Frederik II and, overcoming sticking points on the amount of the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589.\n\nAnne herself seems to have been thrilled with the match. On July 28, 1589, the English spy Thomas Fowler reported that Anne was “so far in love with the King’s Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt enough to requite.” Fowler’s insinuation, that James VI preferred men to women, would have been hidden from the fourteen-year-old Anne, who devotedly embroidered shirts for her fiancé while 300 tailors worked on her wedding dress.\n\nAnne of Denmark\n\nWhatever the truth of the rumours, James VI required a royal match to preserve the Stuart line. “God is my witness”, he explained, “I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were a barren stock.” On August 20, 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle, the ceremony ending with James’ representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.\n\nMarriage\n\nAnne set sail for Scotland within 10 days, but her fleet under the command of Admiral Peder Munk was beset by a series of misadventures, finally being forced back to the coast of Norway, from where she travelled by land to Oslo for refuge, accompanied by the Earl Marischal and others of the Scottish and Danish embassies.\n\nOn September 12, Lord Dingwall had landed at Leith, reporting that “he had come in company with the Queen’s fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas.” Alarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers, and kept watch on the Firth of Forth for Anne’s arrival from Seton Palace, the home of his friend Lord Seton.\n\nInformed by Anne’s own letters in October that she had abandoned the crossing for the winter, in what Willson calls “the one romantic episode of his life”, James sailed from Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally. He arrived in Oslo on November 19 after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tønsberg.\n\nAnne of Denmark\n\nAnne and James were formally married at the Old Bishop’s Palace in Oslo on November 23, 1589, “with all the splendour possible at that time and place.” So that both bride and groom could understand, Leith minister David Lindsay conducted the ceremony in French, describing Anne as “a Princess both godly and beautiful … she giveth great contentment to his Majesty.”\n\nA month of celebrations followed; and on December 22, cutting his entourage to 50, James visited his new relations at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, where the newlyweds were greeted by Queen Sophie, 12 year-old King Christian IV, and Christian’s four regents.\n\nThe couple moved on to Copenhagen on March 7, and attended the wedding of Anne’s older sister Elizabeth to Heinrich-Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg April 19, sailing two days later for Scotland in a patched up “Gideon”. They arrived in the Water of Leith on May 17, After a welcoming speech in French by James Elphinstone, Anne stayed in the King’s Wark and James went alone to hear a sermon by Patrick Galloway in the Parish Church. Five days later, Anne made her state entry into Edinburgh in a solid silver coach brought over from Denmark, James riding alongside on horseback.\n\nAnne of Denmark\n\nAnne was crowned on May 17, 1590 in the Abbey Church at Holyrood, the first Protestant coronation in Scotland. During the seven-hour ceremony, her gown was opened by the Countess of Mar for presiding minister Robert Bruce to pour “a bonny quantity of oil” on “parts of her breast and arm”, so anointing her as queen. (Kirk ministers had objected vehemently to this element of the ceremony as a pagan and Jewish ritual, but James insisted that it dated from the Old Testament.)\n\nThe king handed the crown to Chancellor Maitland, who placed it on Anne’s head. She then affirmed an oath to defend the true religion and worship of God and to “withstand and despise all papistical superstitions, and whatsoever ceremonies and rites contrary to the word of God”.\n\nOn this date in History death of Queen Anne, the wife of King James VI of Scotland and I of England, March 2, 1619.\n\nAnne of Denmark (December 12, 1574 – March 2, 1619) was Queen consort of Scotland, England, and Ireland by marriage to King James VI and I. Anne was the second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Schleswig and his wife Sophia of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, (a descendant of King John of Denmark, and also his own first half-cousin, through their grandfather, Frederik I, King of Denmark and Norway. Sophia was the daughter of Ulrich III, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Elizabeth of Denmark).\n\nAnne married James in 1589 at age 15 and bore him three children who survived infancy, including the future Charles I. She demonstrated an independent streak and a willingness to use factional Scottish politics in her conflicts with James over the custody of Prince Henry and his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven. Anne appears to have loved James at first, but the couple gradually drifted and eventually lived apart, though mutual respect and a degree of affection survived.\n\nIn England, Anne shifted her energies from factional politics to patronage of the arts and constructed her own magnificent court, hosting one of the richest cultural salons in Europe.\n\nThe death of Prince Henry in 1612 at the age of eighteen, probably from typhoid, and the departure for Heidelberg of the sixteen-year-old Princess Elizabeth in April 1613, after marrying Elector Frederick V of the Palatine, further weakened the family ties binding Anne and James. Henry’s death hit Anne particularly hard; the Venetian ambassador was advised not to offer condolences to her “because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs”. From this time forward, Anne’s health deteriorated, and she withdrew from the centre of cultural and political activities, staging her last known masque in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court. Her influence over James visibly waned as he became openly dependent on powerful favourites. Though she was reported to have been a Protestant at the time of her death, evidence suggests that she may have converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.\n\nBy late 1617, Anne’s bouts of illness had become debilitating; the letter writer John Chamberlain recorded: “The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she would fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body.” In January 1619, royal physician Sir Theodore de Mayerne instructed Anne to saw wood to improve her blood flow, but the exertion served to make her worse. James visited Anne only three times during her last illness, though Prince Charles often slept in the adjoining bedroom at Hampton Court Palace and was at her bedside during her last hours, when she had lost her sight. With her until the end was her personal maid, Anna Roos, who had arrived with her from Denmark in 1590. Queen Anne died aged 44 on March 2, 1619, of a dangerous form of dropsy.\n\nHistorians have traditionally dismissed Anne as a lightweight queen, frivolous and self-indulgent. However, recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne’s assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a patron of the arts during the Jacobean age.\n\nQueen Anne was buried in King Henry VII’s Chapel, Westminster Abbey, on May 13, 1619.\n\nWe have reached an interesting point in this series. Although, as we shall see, the House of Stuart will have its difficult times on and off the thrones of England and Scotland, we have reached a period of relative stability as far as legal successions are concerned. There will be a few more crises for the throne but we will not see civil wars and usurpations like we have had in the past. In the next section of this topic we will see the rise of Parliament and the battle with the Crown over the power within the government. I will examine how this conflict actually helped stabilize the Crown and the succession to the throne.\n\nJames I-VI, King of England and King of Scots (when still only King of Scots) married Princess Anne of Denmark in 1589, the daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark and Norway and his wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. They would have seven children, three sons and four daughters, and only three of them surviving childhood. The eldest son, Prince Henry Frederick, was created The Duke of Rothesay as heir to the Scottish throne in 1594. Upon his father’s accession of the English throne in 1603 Henry Frederick automatically became Duke of Cornwall. In 1610 his father created him The Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. Although young, Henry Frederick displayed great promise in leadership and his sudden death from Typhoid at the age of 18 dashed the hopes of many.\n\nThis left his rather sickly brother, Charles, Duke of Albany, as heir to his fathers kingdoms. In the due corse of time Charles became King of England and King of Scots when his father passed away on March 27, 1605. The same year of his succession King Charles married Henrietta Maria de Bourbon of France, daughter of King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife, Marie de’ Medici. This marriage returned England to the problems between Protestants and Catholics. Henrietta Maria was a Catholic and for that reason she was distrusted at court. Her Catholicism influenced both her two eldest sons, the future King Charles II and King James II-VII. These conflicts over religion would have implications on the legal succession.\n\nCharles I had a difficult reign. He ruled for 11 years without Parliament and only reluctantly called Parliament because he needed to raise money for war. I will not focus on the English Civil Wars for that is a complex topic for another day. However, the Civil War did lead to Charles I being arrested, tried and convicted of treason and on January 30, 1649 he was beheaded and the monarchy was abolished. England was declared a Commonwealth and power was assumed by a Council of State, which included Lord Fairfax, then Lord General of the Parliamentary Army, and Oliver Cromwell.\n\nAs noted other places in when there is a war the victor gets to rewrite the laws and rules. In reality at that moment in time the throne was gone and the Commonwealth was the successor to the Kingdom of England. To his supporters Charles, Prince of Wales, was now the pretender to the extinct throne. He was a man with a high price tag on his head and spent many years on the run. He was crowned King of Scots in 1651 but with Cromwell’s army on his heels his stay in Scotland was brief. The next part will examine how Charles II became the legal King of England and King of Scots. I will also examine how his childless marriage and his brother’s Catholicism created a conflict for the throne."
