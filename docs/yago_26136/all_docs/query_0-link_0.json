In short the Danish court did not want to offend the British monarch and his consort.\n\nThis is what I have read too!\n\nI do wonder what title their children would have received had they had any. Would they be HH and prince or princess like their father or would they have been made count or countess of Rosenberg? How far in descent from the crown can the princely titles go in Denmark?\n\nIMO the matter would have been resolved by King Frederik IX, however my best bet is that the children would have been HH princes and princesses! Otherwise it would have been an issue with the British RF ! The Rosenborg-title was out of he question, it was used for those who entered unequal marriages.\n\nViv\n\nPrincess Anne of Denmark (4 December 1917 – 26 September 1980) was the mother of royal photographer, Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield and cousin of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBorn Anne Ferelith Fenella Bowes-Lyon in Washington D.C. in 1917, she was the daughter of Hon. John Herbert Bowes-Lyon (a son of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and a brother of the future Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother) and his wife, the Hon. Fenella (a daughter of the 21st Baron Clinton).\n\nOn 28 April 1938, Anne married Thomas Anson. Thomas held the courtesy title of Viscount Anson and Anne was styled Viscountess Anson upon her marriage and they had two children:\n\n(Thomas) Patrick John Anson (25 April 1939 – 11 November 2005), later the 5th Earl of Lichfield.\n\nThe Lady. Elizabeth Georgiana Anson (b. 7 June 1941), married Sir Geoffrey Shakerley, 6th Bt.\n\nAnne and Thomas were divorced in 1948 and she subsequently married Prince George Valdemar of Denmark (a great-grandson of both Christian IX of Denmark and Oscar II of Sweden and Norway) on 16 September 1950 at Glamis Castle and became Princess Anne of Denmark. Anne died in 1980, aged 62, in London, of a myocardial infarction.\n\nDid Georg & Anne play an active role in Danish life? I understand he lived abroad for a number of years as a military attache in Paris & London, but what was his career after he returned to Denmark. Did he have private wealth or receive a state income or did he earn other income such as a corporate director? Where did they live in Denmark?\n\nThey attended the occasional royal event along with other members of the DRF branch. They spent most of their time abroad, and I don't know where their Danish home was, maybe it was an apartment in a wing of the 'lesser' royal palaces. I'm 99.9 % percent convinced that Georg didn't receive any state income apart from the one as a career officer! And If I may brag a little : I once met Prince Georg briefly in the capacity of my job back then. He was a very kind and polite man.\n\nViv\n\nTheir marriage was considered dynastic and there's no doubt about that. She enjoyed the title of Princess of (af) Denmark and was considered a member of the Royal House. But I meant the changes of law from 1953 that limited succession to the throne to the descendants of Christian X. Since then, Prince Georg and other minor members of the Danish royal house, including the Greek royals, were no longer potential heirs to the throne. As such, they became princes af (which we can translate as of), not til (which means literally to) Denmark. I think the afs have no official status within the realm.\n\nI don't think Georg lost any status when he married Anne. It was a fully approved marriage, probably due to Anne's status as the niece of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nBy 1950 standards a Danish Prince marrying a bride of non- royal descent and a divorcee at that would have been demoted to 'count of Rosenborg', especially when he was not in line of succession!\n\nThe story goes ( I picked it up on another royalty forum several years ago! ) - that on hearing this, King George VI said something along the lines that ' if a Bowes-Lyon is good enough for me a Bowes-Lyon is good enough for a Danish prince'.\n\nI cannot guarantee the veracity of the King's remark but it sounds credible IMO, also considering the often firm will of his consort! I just cannot imagine that Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) would ever accept her niece being reduced to a mere 'countess' in a continental royal family.\n\nViv\n\nPrince George Valdemar of Denmark\n\nI am wondering about Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel of Denmark (1920-1986), a great-grandson of King Christian IX. In 1950, he married a minor British noble and divorcée, Anne, Viscountess Anson, née Bowes-Lyon, a niece of Queen Elizabeth of the UK (later the Queen Mother). It seems unlikely that this would be with the consent of the King of Denmark, but if that were the case, he would have been stripped of the title Prince of Denmark, reduced to being a Count of Rosenborg, like his brother and other relatives who married commoners.\n\nIt was a moot point, really, as he was (or would have been) removed from the line of succession to the Danish throne in 1953 anyway when it was limited to descendants of King Christian X. Also, he had no children to inherit either the non-dynastic title Count of Rosenborg or the dynastic (but non-successive) title Prince of Denmark.\n\nSo was he a Count of Rosenborg, or a Prince of Denmark (without succession rights after 1953) until his death?"
