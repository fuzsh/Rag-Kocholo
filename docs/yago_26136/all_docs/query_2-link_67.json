Composite: Hulton Archive/W and D Downey/Tim Graham Photo Library/Kypros/Getty ImagesGetty Images\n\nContents of dozens of royal wills have been kept private by judges in special hearings closed to the public\n\nRob Evans and David Pegg\n\nMon 18 Jul 2022 16.31 BST\n\nGenerations of the royal family have concealed details of assets worth more than £180m through a series of legal applications that have been granted in total secrecy.\n\nThe assets are outlined in 33 wills that were drawn up by members of the Windsor family over more than a century.\n\nThe family have been able to keep secret the contents of the wills by securing a special carve-out from a law that normally requires British wills to be published.\n\nThe sealing of the wills has enabled the Windsors to avoid the public seeing what kinds of assets – such as property, jewels and cash – have been accumulated by members of the royal family and how these were then distributed to, for example, relatives, friends or staff.\n\nHowever, the Guardian has been able to calculate the overall size of the wealth passed down by many members of the family, as the value of their estates has been published in public registers and declassified government files.\n\nThis shows that the Windsor family, whose wealth is opaque, have been able to keep secret wills that contain assets totalling – at today’s figures – £187m. Because the contents remain secret, some assets may have appeared in multiple wills and been counted more than once.\n\nAt the top of the league is the Duke of Fife, who married Princess Louise, a daughter of King Edward VII. When the duke died in 1912, he left behind a fortune that is worth the equivalent today of £79m.\n\nNine other wills contain assets worth between £5m and £11.7m if translated into today’s figures. They include Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister, who left £7.7m (£11.5m at today’s prices) when she died in 2002.\n\nAttorney general accused over Queen Mother’s will cover-up\n\nRead more\n\nWills drawn up by a succession of minor royals including grandchildren of Queen Victoria have been kept secret. One of the more remote relatives was a member of the Danish royal family, Prince George Valdemar Carl Axel, who was born in Denmark and was a second cousin to Prince Philip. He lived in Britain and married a viscountess who was a distant relative of the royal family.\n\nHis will was sealed in London after his death in 1986. His estate was valued at £785,000 (£1.8m at today’s prices).\n\nThe arcane practice of keeping secret the wills of members of the royal family is due to come under scrutiny in a court case that starts on Wednesday. The Guardian is taking legal action to challenge a decision to exclude the media from a court hearing that resulted last year in a ruling that kept secret the Duke of Edinburgh’s will.\n\nSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7am BST\n\nFor decades, lawyers for the royal family have obtained legal orders from high court judges to have the contents of wills kept confidential after relatives have died. Since 1911, all the court hearings in which senior judges granted these orders have been held behind closed doors.\n\nThis practice has been controversial, since wills belonging to members of the general public are ordinarily made public after they die. They are generally published in order to ensure that they are correctly implemented and are not subjected to any fraud. Legislation from the 1800s bans the publication of the monarch’s will.\n\nSecret wills of the royals - a tale of mistresses, jewels and cover-ups\n\nRead more\n\nFor more than a century, high court judges who decided that the wills should be kept secret also concluded that their judgments explaining their rulings should not be published.\n\nThe first judgment to be made public was last September, when a high court judge – Sir Andrew McFarlane, the president of the family division – published his ruling that Prince Philip’s will should not be made public.\n\nHe decided that the wills of senior royals should be confidential as it was “necessary to enhance the protection afforded to the private lives of this unique group of individuals, in order to protect the dignity and standing of the public role of the sovereign and other close members of her family”.\n\nLawyers for Philip also successfully applied to keep secret the value of the assets contained within his will.\n\nAs with all the other hearings, the media were prevented from attending or even being allowed to argue why they should be able to attend.\n\nIn its legal challenge to be heard over two days, the Guardian is arguing that the high court failed to properly consider whether the press should be allowed to attend the hearing, and that its failure to allow the media to make representations constitutes such a serious interference with the principle of open justice that the case should be reheard.\n\nThe application is being opposed by the attorney general’s department, which declined to comment as the legal case was being heard.\n\nBuckingham Palace declined to comment in detail. A spokesperson said: “The treatment of wills is a matter for the executors of estates.” The spokesperson added that the executors of any Briton could apply to have a will sealed. It is not known how many wills of Britons – outside of the royal family – have been closed after legal applications.\n\nWills of members of the royal family that have been sealed\n\nThe values of their estates (total wealth when they died) is given where known, along with the equivalent value at today’s prices, using the Bank of England inflation calculator.
