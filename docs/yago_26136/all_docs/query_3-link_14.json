The daughter of Frederick II of Denmark and Sophia of Mecklenburg, she married King James VI of Scotland by proxy in August of 1589 and in person on November 23 of that year. She was unpopular with the people of Scotland, and when James ascended the throne of England as James I in 1603, she caused great embarrassment when she refused to take Anglican communion during their coronation. She had 8 children, only 3 survived infancy. As her husband had definite homosexual preferences, they lived largely separate lives. Anne occupied herself with entertainments at court, having a penchant for staging and acting in elaborate masques. This coupled with her Catholic faith, taste for expensive clothes and costly building projects made her as unpopular with her English subjects as she had been with the Scottish, and added to the great financial difficulties of James' reign."
