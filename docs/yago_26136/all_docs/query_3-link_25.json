By her marriage to James VI/I of Scotland and England she became Queen Consort of Scotland on 17 May 1590 and Queen Consort of Great Britain on 25 July 1603.\n\nAnne was born on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark. She was the second daughter of King Frederick II of Denmark, and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nOn 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to King James VI of Scotland at Kronborg Castle. Anne set sail for Scotland within 10 days, but after a series of misadventures the crossing was abandoned for the winter. It ended with James VI sailing from Leith to fetch his wife personally. James arrived at Oslo on 19 November 1589. Anne and James were formally married at the Old Bishop's Palace in Oslo on 23 November 1589. The marriage produced seven children, of whom only three survived infancy:\n\nHenry Frederick, Prince of Wales (19 February 1594 – 6 November 1612)\n\nElizabeth (19 August 1596 – 13 February 1662). Married Frederick V, Elector Palatine.\n\nMargaret (24 December 1598 Dalkeith Palace – March 1600 Linlithgow Palace).\n\nCharles I, King of England (19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649).\n\nRobert, Duke of Kintyre (18 January 1602 – 27 May 1602).\n\nMary (8 April 1605 Greenwich Palace – 16 December 1607 Stanwell, Surrey)\n\nSophia (22 June 1606 – 23 June 1606)\n\nHer Lutheran upbringing and frivolous nature cost her the affection of James's Scottish Presbyterian subjects, and James alienated Anne by entrusting the upbringing of their first son, Prince Henry (1594 -1612), to John Erskine, 2nd earl of Mar. Nevertheless, after James ascended the British throne in 1603, he and Anne lived in harmony, although they had separate quarters during the last few years of her life.\n\nMost of the Queen's time and energy were devoted to lavish court entertainments, and her patronage contributed to the development of the arts. She embarrassed James, however, by displaying sympathy for Roman Catholicism. Their second son succeeded James as King Charles I (ruled 1625-49).\n\nDeath\n\nDeath:\n\nDate: 2 MAR 1619\n\nPlace: Hampton Court Palace, Richmond, Greater London, United Kingdom\n\nNote: Hampton Court Palace\n\nBurial\n\nBurial:\n\nDate: 13 MAY 1619\n\nPlace: Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London, Britain (UK)\n\nTitles\n\nDrottning i Skottland 1590, i England 1603,\n\nDronning af Skotland - England,\n\nPrincess of Denmark, Queen Consort Anne of Scotland, Queen of Scotland, England, and Ireland, Queen Consort of Scotland, England & Ireland, Queen of England, Princess of Denmark\n\nSources\n\nThe Peerage\n\nGeneall\n\n'Wikipedia: English, Dansk\n\nThe Illustrated Columbia Encyclopedia, 1969\n\nWorld Wide Illustrated Encyclopedia, 1935"
