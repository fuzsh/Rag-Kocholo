John Herbert Bowes-Lyon, son of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and the Hon. Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, daughter of the 21st Baron Clinton, making her a niece of Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. In 1938, she married Viscount Anson, Heir to the Earl of Lichfield, and was styled as Viscountess Anson during their marriage. The couple had two children, famous photographer, Patrick, the 5th Earl of Lichfield, and royal party planner, Lady Elizabeth Anson, before their divorce in 1948. In 1950, she married Prince George Valdemar of Denmark, son of Prince Axel of Denmark and Princess Margaretha of Sweden, becoming Princess Anne of Denmark. The Prince served as the Danish defence attaché to London and military, naval and air attaché at Paris, and the couple were quite active in British and Danish Society during the 1950s and 1960s.
