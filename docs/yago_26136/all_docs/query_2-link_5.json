Please go to the following link to see a photo of Prince Aage:\n\nhttp://photobucket.com/albums/y138/loejil/Denmark%20Royal%20Family/?action=view&current=PrinceAageofDenmark.jpg\n\nCan anyone tell me what type of uniform he is wearing? I have never seen that type of hat before on anyone. This prince was handsome. This photo is on an old postcard that I bought for my Royalty postcard collection. I would like any info on this royal. Thank you!\n\nThe photo was taken at the coronation of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) of Thailand at Dusit Palace, December 1911.\n\nThe European Monarchs sent represenatives to the coronation of King Rama VI. The king made many friends when he studied in England, and in having to represent his father, King Rama V, on many royal occassions in Europe. Another significant occassion when many European Royals gathered in Thailand was for the 200th-year celebration of Bangkok, in 1982.\n\nThe people in the photo, from left to right standing are,\n\n1) Prince Axel Christian Georg of Denmark (188 , second son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, grandson of Christian IX, King of Denmark (1818-1906), was married to Princess Margaretha Sofia Lovisa Ingeborg of Sweden (1899-1977).\n\n2) Prince Fushimi-no-Miya of Japan (Prince Fushimi Sadanaru, 22nd Prince Fushimi-no-Miya) (1858-1923). The Fushimi-no-Miya is one of the four branch houses of the imperial dynasty entitled to provide a successor to the throne.\n\n3) Prince Aage Christian Alexander Robert of Denmark, Greve af Rosenborg (1887-1940), eldest son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, grandson of Christian IX, King of Denmark (1818-1906), was married to Mathilde Emile Francesca Marie Calvi dei Conti di Bergolo (1885-1949).\n\n4) Prince Erik Frederik Christian Alexander of Denmark (1890- ), third son of Prince Valdemar of Denmark, grandson of Christian IX, King of Denmark (1818-1906), was married to Loïs Frances Booth (1897-1941) in Ottawa, Ontario, in 1924, divorced in 1937.\n\nAnd seated left to right,\n\n5) Prince Alexander of Teck (Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone) (1874-1957), son of Francis, Duke of Teck and his wife, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, and youngest brother of Queen Mary, consort of King George V of Great Britain, married to Princess Alice of Albany.\n\n6) Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich of Russia (1877-1943), son of Grand Duke Vladimir ROMANOV and Grand Duchess Marie PAVLOVNA, and grandson of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, married to Zenaida RASHEVSKA. 7) Princess Maries of Sweden (Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna of Russia) (1890-1958), daughter of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia and Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark, and grand daughter of Tsar of Russia Alexander II Nicholaievitch, was married to Prince Vilhelm of Sweden.8) Princess Alexander of Teck (Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone) (1883-1981), daughter of Prince Leopold of Great Britain and Ireland and Princess Helene zu Waldeck und Pyrmont, and granddaughter of Queen Victoria, married to Prince Alexander of Teck.\n\n9) Prince Valdemar of Denmark (1858-1939), son of Christian IX, King of Denmark (1818-1906) and Luise, Princess of Hesse-Cassel (1817-1898), youngest brother of Frederik VIII, King of Denmark (1843-1912), was married to Princess Marie Amélie Françoise Hélène d'Orléans (1865-1909).\n\n10) Prince Vilhelm of Sweden (1884-1965), son of King Gustaf V Adolf of Sweden and Princess Victoria von Baden, was married to Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna of Russia (ended in divorce). They had one son, Count Lennart Bernadotte af Wisborg.\n\nI wrote in my previous post that Prince Aage was satanding on the far left, he is actually standing third from the left, sorry I didn't say it right the first time, and I'll correct my earlier post.\n\nRoyal Fan said:\n\nHow Do you pronounce his name this is a great idea for a thread\n\nIf you say 'I owe you something' you take the word 'owe' and stretch the o a little bit before the w and then pronounce the e as an open 'eh' (as it isn't pronounced at all when you say 'owe'), then you got Aage, (or Åge as it's written these days.)\n\nooweh\n\nIt's a great idea this thread, I've been wondering why we know so little about Queen Alexandrine since she isn't that far back in history, only one generation before Queen Ingrid.\n\nScroll down this list to Frederik 8 and you will find the picture looks pretty much like 'Roi de Danemark' as it's shown above. He was quite a traveller, in fact he died in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nhttp://www.fortidensjelling.dk/jelling10.htm\n\nFull Name: Valdemar of Denmark\n\nBorn: 27 October 1858 at Bernstroff Castle, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nDied: 14 January 1939 at the Yellow Palace, Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nFather: King Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1906)\n\nMother: Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel (1817-1898)\n\nSiblings: King Frederik VIII of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, King George I of Greece, Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia, Crown Princess Thyra of Hanover.\n\nSpouse: Princess Marie Amèlie Françoise Hélène de Orlèans (b 13 January 1865). Married 20 October 1885 (religious ceremony was held October 22) in France.\n\nChildren:\n\nPrince Aage (June 1887-February 1940)\n\nPrince Axel (August 1888-July 1946)\n\nPrince Erik (Nov. 1890-Sept. 1950)\n\nPrince Viggo (Dec. 1893-January 1970)\n\nPrincess Margrethe (Sept. 1895-Sept. 1992).\n\nTrivia: Princess Margrethe was the mother of Queen Anna of Romania.\n\nNow that I have all that, does anyone know if Valdemar had any other names, and if so, what were they? It seems odd to see him with just the one name when all his siblings had a string of names...\n\nPrince Valdemar was a convivial sailor prince who turned down a few offers of thrones in other countries (Bulgaria was one I believe). He was very close to his nephew Prince George of Greece (Greek Georgie I think). I would not mention this but have gotten some very sinister undertones from those who talk about the relationship of these two, in the sense that their relationship may have been somewhat romantic. I am going from what I read in the bio of Greek Georgie's wife Marie Bonaparte and other reading and documentaries.\n\nHe was very close to his nephew Prince George of Greece (Greek Georgie I think). I would not mention this but have gotten some very sinister undertones from those who talk about the relationship of these two, in the sense that their relationship may have been somewhat romantic.\n\nTheirs was a strange relationship! I'm not sure whether there is any 'proof' so to speak! However if you get the impression that something unusual was going on nobody who's familiar with DRF history will blame you!. - Even Queen Margrethe once hinted in a documentary that 'they were very, very close friends'.\n\nWe may think about this whatever we like; I have decided to ragard it as one of the oddities of life!\n\nviv\n\nTheirs was a strange relationship!

Even Maria Bonaparte, Princess George understood it! She often wrote that when Prince George was with Uncle Valdemar, they both seem radiant! and when they had to separate (Prince George should go back to Greece), it was every year dramatical!\n\nPersonally I found disgusting! When they started Prince George was 16y old and Valdemar's nephew!! Valdemar was 11 years older.

At this time this story was \"normal\" for now NOT!\n\nA Diana-Charles-Camilla story, if happened 100 years ago, would never have provoked any reaction of the then \"Diana\" and the story would have continued for years without never becoming public.\n\nAnd do you think than the Dominique-Strauss Khan of 100 years ago would have been accused by the maid... Never!\n\nOn the other hand, if you know the story of the Lost Prince John of England, it is a very sad story, which would not happen now!\n\nConsequentrly I judge this story with my mind of today and my own opinion.\n\nIt was known to everyone that they had a \"romantic\" relationship.

We also don't know at what time the relationship moved from emotional to sexual. We don't know for sure if it ever did become sexual, so calling Valdemar an incestuous pedophile is a pretty extreme claim.\n\nPrince Michel of Bourbon Parme sold letters of Marie de Guise, Princess Valdemar of Denmark to her relatives (Royal families from GB, Russia , Greece, Denmark etc..) and also pictures (part of her 4000)\n\nThe Auction was on Monday 28 th of April at Drouot/Paris the whole day.\n\nPrince Michel's Children did not know about and went to Court to avoid that this historical letters would be sold to customers all around the world.\n\nHalf of the letters are cancelled and will be unsold. The Auction is only in the afternoon. (half day)\n\nI have the very interesting catalogue .\n\nThanks to the young Generation of Bourbon Parme !\n\nNo interest in real royal letters with their Royal Monograms and great handwriting ?.\n\nQueen Alexandra of GB , Tsarina of Russia and others wrote in French.\n\nPrince Michel is Princess Magrethe of Denmark's Son, and Princess Marie's Grandson as\n\nShe married Prince René of Boubon Parme.\n\nHe sold 3000 letters and 4000 pictures of his Grandmother in an Auction next Monday.\n\nThe Auction is shortened , I have the Catalogue and am wondering to see which items her great grandchildren refused to be sold.\n\nIn most places a 16 yr old would be of the age of consent.

It was his brother's kid!\n\nI'sorry but i do not think that 16 y old, at this period in Europe, it was the age of consent, and even if it was, matter could not be applied in such a close family relation, i.e. between an uncle and his nephew!

Age of consent between hetersexual relations didnt exist in some countries and in those that it did it may have been as young as twelve. Also there are several examples of uncle niece marriages hopefully you judge them the same way."
