        "text": "Anne, Princess Royal is known to be the \"hardest working royal\", constantly offering support to the monarch in their times of need. But there is someone on the sidelines silently supporting her as well – her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence.\n\nWho is Sir Timothy Laurence?\n\nLaurence is Anne's second husband, who she married in 1992 promptly after her divorce from her first husband, equestrian Mark Phillips, who is the father of her children Zara and Peter.\n\nLaurence first entered the royal fold in 1986 as an equerry for Queen Elizabeth, appointed to assist members of the royal family. Prior to this he was a naval officer in the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1988, he was appointed to be one of just three trustees for The Princess Anne's Charities trust, with one publication at the time saying the appointment \"just shows Anne's affection for him\".\n\nIt was in 1989 that everything was exposed, with a number of personal letters from Laurence to Anne being anonymously delivered to the UK publication The Sun. The letters were soon given to Scotland Yard to investigate, but it had already been the topic of many rumours. Some publications said the letters were intimate in nature, whereas others said that they were simply love letters.\n\nBuckingham Palace was forced to put out a statement about the correspondence, saying, \"The stolen letters were addressed to the Princess Royal by Commander Timothy Laurence, the Queen's Equerry. We have nothing to say about the contents of personal letters sent to Her Royal Highness by a friend which were stolen and which are the subject of a police investigation.\"\n\nThat same year Anne announced her separation from her husband Mark Phillips, though they did not intend to divorce at first. Three years later they did so, with Anne and Laurence publicly debuting their relationship shortly after and wedding on December 12 in a small ceremony at a Presbyterian church near Balmoral, attended by Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, and Prince Edward, as well as Anne's children.\n\nD espite their union coming about through scandal, the pair have led a quiet married life since their wedding in 1992, staying largely out of the media spotlight.\n\n2024 hospital visit\n\nHe has been seen supporting her through some of the toughest times of her life, most recently acting on her behalf after she had an incident involving a horse and received head injuries and a concussion, having to take a few days to recover in hospital.\n\nThough he is usually seen and not heard, Laurence, took it upon himself to inform the media of his wife's condition.\n\nThe 69-year-old told waiting media on Tuesday that the Princess Royal is \"doing fine\", adding to a well-wisher that he was blown away by the outpouring of support they'd received.\n\n\"She is recovering well, thank you,\" he said when asked about his wife's condition.\n\n\"We are both profoundly grateful to the medical team and hospital support staff for their expert care, and to the emergency services who were all so wonderful at the scene.\n\n\"We are both deeply touched by all the kind messages we have received from so many people near and far. It means a great deal.\"\n\nHe added that his wife's recovery was \"slow but sure\" as he left Southmead Hospital in Bristol carrying a blue cooler bag.\n\nWhen asked if he'd brought lunch from home inside the cooler bag, Laurence admitted he had brought some \"treats\" for his wife, 73, as she recovered in hospital.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's death\n\nHe also supported her through one of the most tragic events of her life – the death of her beloved mother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAnne was praised for being the one to accompany her mother's casket all the way from Balmoral in Scotland, where she passed on August 8, 2022, to Edinburgh. But what many don't know is that there was someone else accompanying them.\n\nLaurence travelled with Anne and his late mother-in-law for the six-hour-long car ride, being there for his wife during what was sure to be a tough journey.\n\nHe continued to be there for his wife, not more than a few steps away as the Royal family dealt with the formalities of the death of the monarch.\n\nHe was seen as the royal family greeted well-wishers and read tributes outside the gates of Balmoral, walking behind her as she followed the late Queen's funeral hearse, and accompanied her for each moment of the late Queen's procession and funeral.\n\nLaurence's unwavering loyalty to his wife has not gone unnoticed – even attracting the praise of his stepson, Peter Phillips.\n\nIn a documentary marking the Princess' 70th birthday, Phillips remarked, \"They both have an understanding of what being a part of the wider family means and what is required,\" acknowledging the \"strong support\" his step-father gives his mother."
