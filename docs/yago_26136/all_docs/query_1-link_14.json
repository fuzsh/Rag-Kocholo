Age of consent between hetersexual relations didnt exist in some countries and in those that it did it may have been as young as twelve. Also there are several examples of uncle niece marriages hopefully you judge them the same way.\n\nOf course. My judgement is based to the two facts i do not agree for, i.e close family relation and young age of one of the pair (actually if they were both sixteen, would be slightly more acceptable for me, than 28 to 16y).

I really do not care or judge that Pcs Valdemar + Pcs George had an homosexual relation. I just disapprove that a 28 years person had a sexual relation with the 16 years old, kid of his sibling!!! Heterosexual or Homosexeual it does not make any difference. It was an adult with a kid, his own brother's kid.\n\nJust put into actual years, and think about Pcs Albert of Monaco having a relationship with Charlotte Casiraghi when she was 16!!\n\nOr Pcs Edward, duke of Wessex with Pcs Harry when he was 16!\n\nI do not think that even now in our modern societies it could appear normal.\n\nmaria-olivia\n\nMajesty\n\nJoined\n\nOct 3, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n8,205\n\nCity\n\nBrussels\n\nCountry\n\nBelgium\n\nThanks for correcting .Kind regards MO\n\nfearghas\n\nCourtier\n\nJoined\n\nJul 21, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n591\n\nCity\n\nbrisbane\n\nCountry\n\nAustralia\n\nFair enough, I do understand your arguement re the closeness of kin.

It would have put Valdemar into direct conflict with his older brother – not favourable for any of the people involved. I actually recall reading in En kongelig familie (2004) that it was Valdemar himself who declined the throne, but I reckon it was a mutual decision between Christian IX and him.\n\nLast edited: Oct 27, 2014\n\nBlog Real\n\nImperial Majesty\n\nJoined\n\nJan 9, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n13,496\n\nCity\n\nLisboa\n\nCountry\n\nPortugal\n\nPrinces Valdemar and his children visit Lisbon (1907)\n\nhttp://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa....907/N63/N63_master/JPG/N63_0023_branca_t0.jpg\n\nhttp://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa....907/N63/N63_master/JPG/N63_0028_branca_t0.jpg\n\nIn the photos we can see the King Carlos I of Portugal and Queen d.
