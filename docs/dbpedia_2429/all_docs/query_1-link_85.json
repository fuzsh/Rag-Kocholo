It is a land to rejoice the heart of an antiquary, and to hold the fancy of a poet, since from the earliest times it has been the scene of fierce border-fights, and still can shew, in ruined castle and pre-historic mound, the wrecks of these forgotten wars. It is some account of this district or rather of one portion of it, the Lordship of Ewias Harold that I, greatly daring, now venture to set forth, though I am neither antiquary nor poet, but merely one who, living day by day among the hills and streams of Ewias land, has come under its spell; and, in the spare moments of a busy life, I have strung together these fragments of its story. The name itself, Ewias or Ewyas as it begins to be spelt in the i3th century need not detain us, as all attempts to explain it are purely conjectural. The really competent scholars to whom I have applied confess that they have no idea of the derivation of the name, though they all think it is Celtic, or possibly pre-Celtic. We may, therefore, leave such ingenious theorists as love to draw over-definite conclusions from insufficient premisses to decide as they please the question whether Ewias means â€œVale of the yew-trees\" or one of the half-dozen other purely conjectural interpretations of the word. For the true origin of the name of Ewias is lost, probably beyond all possibility of recovery.\n\n1 i See Appendix, Note B.\n\n2 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nIn the earliest days of which anthropological and archaeological investigations give us any knowledge, this land of Ewias, like the rest of Herefordshire, and several of the surrounding shires, was inhabited by the Silures, whom the history-books of our nursery days used to call \" a tribe of Ancient Britons.\" We now know, however, that they were not Britons at all, if by Britons we mean the old Celtic inhabitants of Britain, who spoke a language akin to modern Welsh. They were the remains of a pre-Celtic race, who came into England in a distant age, when as yet a broad bridge of land connected what is now the island of Great Britain with the mainland of France and Belgium. So far from being Celts, they were not even Aryans. They were akin to the people whose type still predominates in the east, centre, and south of Spain, and are therefore often called Iberian : some use the term \" Euskarian,\" from the proper name of the Pyrenean people and language that we call Basque, whose prevailing type however is not quite the same. It is this pre-Celtic race, and not the \" Ancient Britons,\" whose remains we dis-inter when the long mounds, or barrows, which are especially frequent in Herefordshire, are opened. They were a short, dark race, speaking, as we said, a non-Aryan tongue, and sharply marked off from their later conquerors, the Celtic Britons, by the elongated form of their heads, the back part of the skull being much prolonged. From this feature the race is called by anthropologists \" dolicho-cephalic \" or long-headed. They were an agricultural and pastoral people, who had learned to make pottery and cloth, but still only used stone implements, which, however, they fashioned most beautifully, and highly polished. This race was scattered, in little independent settlements, all over England, probably for many centuries. Then, at an unknown period after Britain had been severed from the Continent, a new race, tall, stalwart, broad-headed, and harsh- featured, made its way across the sea into the island. They were almost certainly of fair complexion, and are believed to have spoken a Gaelic dialect of the Celtic language ; but it is just possible that this was not introduced until the arrival of the next succeeding wave of conquerors. They had learned on the Continent the method of making bronze weapons, and, thus armed, they soon subdued the dark, long-headed race, with their stone hatchets and wooden clubs, In parts of Southern Britain the Silures, protected by their hills, seem to have kept more or less of independence ; and ethnologists still trace, in the dark complexions, long, oval heads, and prominent cheek-bones, which are exceptionally common amongst the men of Herefordshire, the remnants of this pre-historic stock. Gradually, however, the Silurians adopted from the dominant race their Celtic language, manners, and customs ; the fair or red-haired Celt, and the dark-haired Silurian slowly coalesced, but always with the Celt as master. This Celtic invasion was in at least two distinct\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 3\n\nwaves the Goidelic and the Brythonian. The Goidelic-Celts had already estab- lished themselves as masters of the whole of Britain, when their Brythonic kinsmen followed them from the Continent. A bitter struggle between the two kindred races followed, and the superior might of the Brythons drove the Goidelic-Celts to associate more and more intimately with their subject Iberians. Hence the Silurians of Herefordshire, when the Roman legions under Ostorius Scapula came against them, probably represented the old Iberian stock slightly admixed from Goidelic inter-marriages ; and curiously enough, in the last long fight with Rome, they were led by the great Brythonic chief, Caractacus ; who, after fighting thirty battles against the ever victorious legions, had taken refuge with the western tribes he had once dreamed of subduing and welding into a united Britain under Brythonic supremacy. It may well be that Iberian warriors from the hills and valleys of Ewias helped to throw up that great range of earthworks on the Malvem Hills, which probably marks the first line of defence against the advance of Ostorius, or fought in that last desperate battle near the head waters of the Wye, of which we read in Tacitus. Before the year 78 A.D. Frontinus had crushed the long and bitter resistance of the Silures, and from the important station of Ariconium, at Weston-under-Penyard, he commanded the whole district from the Forest of Dean to the Banks of the Usk. The tribesmen who had not been slain were pressed for road-makers, and a long straight cause-way was built across the land of Ewias, carrying the great road from Kenchester to Abergavenny, of a strength and solidity which must have astonished the poor Silurians. A portion of this road is still to be traced, within two miles of the present village of Ewias Harold. The tattooed barbarians of Ewias and the Doyer valley must have wondered at the magnitude of the \" Street,\" at the making of which their taskmasters compelled them to toil. But in time they saw \" stations \" springing up along the line. Traces are even yet to be seen of strongly-fortified Roman posts at Longtown and at Oldcastle in Ewias ;* and everywhere within reach of the road, Roman villas, built of stone, and decorated with mosaics and frescoed walls, rose on the sunny hill-sides. Iron-works were opened or extended in the Forest of Dean, and traders introduced new arts and new commodities, whilst Italian stewards organised new methods of agriculture. Lastly the strange new religion of the Christ came along the road to our Ewias valleys. For more than 300 years the land lay under foreign masters, much as India now is, under English rule. The Roman sternly kept the peace between the tribes-\n\ni See Appendix, Note C.\n\n4 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nmen ; he introduced the arts and luxuries of civilization ; but he never mixed with the subject race. Exactly as the Englishman to-day holds himself apart from the native Hindoo, so to the last the Roman held himself apart from the native Silurians. Living as serfs in the wretched huts which clustered round his villa on the hill-side, they only tilled his land, and kept in order his great road. He learned probably sufficient of their Celtic tongue to give his orders ; but they for their part learned nothing of his Latin speech, save, here and there, the name of his strange new works, the \" Street \" and the \" Chester,\" or Stationery Camp of the Legions.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nCHAPTER II .\n\nTHE ENGLISH IN EWIAS.\n\nDURING the centuries of unbroken peace under Roman rule the material wealth of the province of Britain had steadily grown. But the despotic system of the Roman government had crushed out all the vigour 'of the native tribes. Men had forgotten how to fight for the country which was no longer theirs. Hence when, in 41 1. Rome recalled her legions from Britain, the English from Schleswig-Holstein the \" sea-wolves that live on the pillage of the world,\" as a Roman poet of that day called them, raided the coasts for years, and finally conquered and settled in the land, mercilessly wearing down the Celts through two centuries of bitter warfare. By the year 600 Britain had become England, the land, that is not of Celtic Britons, but of Teutonic Englishmen. The English settlers on the border-land marked as yet by the Severn stream bore the name of \" Mercians,\" men, that is, of the March or Border-land. Beyond the Severn however the Welsh lived undisturbed as yet The district of Ewias was even then known by its present name. And the Liber Landavensis gives us some curious pictures of life in Ewias, in the 5th and 6th centuries. King Clydawg, we read, was \" King in Ewias, a man of holy life, with the palm of carnal chastity, who became a martyr through his virtue, being killed, innocent as a lamb, near the Mynwy (Monnow) while he was waiting for the meeting of the hunters and meditating with great devotion on sacred subjects.\" His friends, having joined oxen to the carriage, began to take away the body from the place. But the oxen could not move the carriage onward ; the yokes broke, and afterwards ropes and chains. The people therefore, recognizing the will of God, buried him on the spot, and built an oratory there, where miracles soon began to be wrought at the grave of the blessed martyr. The surrounding land, called Merthyr Clydawg (now Clodock), was devoted to God \"as an island placed in the sea, free from every service and without an inheritor ; and with refuge according to the will of the refugee, without limit and as long as he should choose to remain.\" A certain rich man in Ewias, Ithael, son of Eddilwyrth, having defrauded the shrine of St. Clydawg of a meadow, was paralysed, until at the sepulchre of the holy martyr, he yielded up the meadow, and \" with promise of future amendment of life, in fasting and prayer and almsgiving, he was restored before all the people, and returned thanks and praises to God for his recovery.\" This was towards the end of the Sixth Century. Early in the Seventh Century, the new King of Ewias, Erbig, son of ElfTin, \" for inscribing 6 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. his name in the Book of Life \" granted to St. Dubricius \" in the hand of Trychan, Bishop of Llandaff,\" the village of \" Elchon on Dulais \" (i.e. Ewias Harold on the river Dulas). This is, as far as I can find, the earliest mention of our village. With the coming of the English Conquerors, the name Elchon was apparently lost, and the district name Ewias alone remained in use. Under Offa whose long reign covers nearly the whole of the second half of the eighth century the Mercian Kingdom became the strongest of the English powers. Beating back the Welsh, Offa secured his new conquest by the great dyke which bears his name. This dyke ran probably some three miles to the East of Ewias, which remained unsubdued for another century. But Archenfield \" Yrcinga-felda\" as the Saxon Chronicle calls it, converting some corrupted form of \" Ariconium \" into a typical Teutonic clan-title was annexed to Mercia, though its half-Celtic, half-Iberian inhabitants, were still allowed to hold it, and became in time loyal subjects to the English, bearing arms against their fellow countrymen beyond the dyke. Early in the Tenth Century, however, the English seem to have pushed beyond the dyke, and established themselves in Ewias. It is alike impossible and unprofitable to try to trace out every detail of the border warfare which was always going on along the Mercian frontier. The English Chroniclers scarcely ever con- descend to speak of these endless skirmishes, while the Welsh Chronicles are full of them. And as time passed on we read not merely of incursions of the \" Saxons,\" but much more of the ravages of the \" Black Pagans,\" that is the Danish pirates. These Northmen in 915 harried all Ewias and Archenfield, carrying off as prisoner Camelgeac, the Bishop of Llandaff, who was making the tour of this furthest portion of his Diocese. It may have been this inroad which suggested to the Mercians in Ewias the need of a stronger defence. At any rate within a few years after this irruption of the Northmen, the great mound, on which afterwards was built the Castle of Ewias Harold, was raised, evidently with an immense expenditure of human labour probably, as in the Roman days, the forced labour of the unhappy Ibero- Celts. This mound and its earth-works are of a type not uncommon in the Marches. Very similar works are to be seen at Kilpeck and Builth, Caerleon and Cardiff, Brecon, Abergavenny and other places in the district. They were probably intended to serve the double purpose of places of refuge against Danish inroads, and strong- holds from which the English chiefs could keep the Welsh in check. The first half of the Tenth Century saw the gradual establishment of the West-Saxon rule over all England. Edward the Elder annexed Mercia, and THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 7 Edgar or rather his great minister Dunstan ruled, for seventeen years of glory and prosperity, an England that for the first time was one, never again to be per- manently divided. The subject Kingdoms, Mercia, Northumbria and the rest, were now governed by a Governor-General, or Viceroy, with the title of Ealdorman, or its Danish equivalent Earl. These Earls were appointed by the King and his Council ; they could be removed by the King, and they were responsible to him for the exercise of their authority. But within his Earldom, the Viceroy exercised full royal power. He was not usually removed except for grave reasons, but his office was not hereditary. At his death his son had no claim to succeed him though often, if the family was a powerful one, the King was driven to appoint the son whether he wished to do so or not. The only Earl of Mercia we need here refer to is Leofric, husband of the Lady Godiva of romance, founder and chief benefactor of Leofric's Minster (now Leominster), and many other religious houses. He succeeded his father about 1 030, in what was practically the supreme rule of all the central counties of England. On the accession of Edward the Confessor, in 1042, Herefordshire, with its as yet only half-attached dependencies of Archenfield and Ewias, was severed from Leofric's dominion, and erected into an independent Earldom. This dismemberment was due to the ambition of Godwin, who, through the first ten years of Edward's reign, was king in all but the name, leaving his practical sovereignty at his death to his son Harold. Of the four great Earldoms into which England was divided, Godwin himself held Wessex, his son Harold ruled East Anglia, and now, out of Leofric's Mercia, he carved a new Earldom for his son Sweyn. It was Sweyn's lawlessness and foul crime, which roused an ill-will in his new dominions that mere greed and ambition would not have excited. He first seduced the Abbess of Leominster, and then sent her back with what was, in the eyes of the men of that day, the yet more outrageous demand of her hand in marriage. The outraged religious sentiment of a whole nation called for satisfaction. The Nunnery was dissolved, and Sweyn banished, in 1046. And now appears on the scene one of the leading names connected with our history, Ralph, the father of Harold of Ewias, who, on the banishment of Sweyn, was created Earl of Hereford by the King.\n\n8 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nCHAPTER III .\n\nEARL RALPH AND THE FIRST CASTLE OF EWIAS.\n\nEARL RALPH AND THE FIRST CASTLE OF EWIAS. \"/1I7ITH the accession of Edward the Confessor to the English throne, the Norman W Conquest really begins. The son of a Norman mother, carried to Normandy in his childhood, brought up at the Norman court, Edward was a Frenchman in habits, feeling, language, and heart. He was a really good man, but a thoroughly incapable king. His natural place was not on the throne of England, but at the head of a Norman Abbey. Like his father, Ethelred the Unready whose character he reproduced, so far as a good man can reproduce the character of a bad one he was constantly under the dominion of favourites. Naturally, since Normandy was ever the land of his affection, he surrounded himself with companions who came from the beloved land, and spoke its tongue ; and these he enriched with English estates, and invested with the highest offices of the English Kingdom. Chief among these Norman favourites of Edward was his nephew, Ralph, the son of his sister Goda, by her first husband Drogo. 1 Even when, in the reign of Hardicanute, Edward came over to England as a private man, he brought Ralph with him, the fore-runner of the gang of foreigners who were soon to be quartered on the country, and gorged with English wealth and honours. When Edward came to the throne, he sought the first opportunity of promoting his nephew and favourite. The oppor- tunity came in Earl Sweyn's banishment in 1 046. Ralph was appointed in his place as Earl of Herefordshire to which it almost seems that Worcestershire was now added. This was the first appointment of a foreigner to a great temporal office in England. Four years later, however, Sweyn's outlawry was reversed, and he was restored to his Earldom. During the four years of Sweyn's absence the \" Normanizing \" of Hereford- shire had proceeded apace. Among the Frenchmen who had flocked after Edward into the land of promise were Richard, son of Scrob, and \"Osbern surnamed Pentecost.\" These each received from Earl Ralph grants of land in his new province, the one in the extreme north of Herefordshire, the other in the outlying district of Ewias. Here they each built for themselves a Castle, after the Norman model, as yet unknown in England. 2 In Ewias, Osbern found the ground plan ready to his hand in the mound and earth-works of the English burh, which had been constructed more than a century earlier, after the great inroad of the Danes. i See Appendix Note D. 2 See Appendix Note E. THE CASTLE HILL. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 9 On the mound he built his keep, and the earth-works defending the platform of the lower ward he surmounted with a wall. The English writers of this age always speak with horror of the building of castles. 1 To fortify a town, or to build a citadel to protect a town, was an obviously necessary precaution. But for a private land- owner to build a private fortress, that he might lord it over his neighbours, was a thing which the freedom-loving Englishmen had never known as yet. The French favourites were already deeply hated by the English people. But now that these impregnable keeps became a centre of all kinds of oppression \" working all the harm and besmear to the King's men there-abouts that they might,\" as the Peterboro' chronicler puts it the position became intolerable. \" Richard's Castle \" as the village is still called, though the fortress itself has vanished and the Castle of Ewias were a constant menace to English freedom. Men felt that the time was come to make a stand against the foreign favourites, who swarmed round the puppet King. Sweyn, on his return to his Earldom, found the men of Herefordshire in a state of furious indignation against the garrison of Pentecost's Castle in Ewias, who had committed foul outrages in the neighbourhood. He at once made an attempt to get the grants to Richard, son of Scrob, and to Osbern Pentecost revoked, and, failing in this, appealed to his father. Godwin had another and even greater grievance in the murder of some English citizens at Dover by Eustace of Boulogne (of whom we shall hear once again as over-lord of some at least of the Ewias lands). Gathering after him the men of Wessex, Godwin marched upon Gloucester, de- manding the expulsion of the foreign favourites, and the destruction of Norman castles on English soil. The Earls of Mercia and Northumberland, Leofric and Siward, jealous of the growing power of Godwin and his house, took Edward's side, and, uniting their forces with those of the King, enabled him safely to defy Godwin. Sweyn was once more banished, and Godwin, declining a useless struggle, went into voluntary exile in Flanders (September 1051). The vacant Earldom of Hereford was once again conferred upon Ralph, but he himself was for the present kept in the South-East, in command of a fleet at Sandwich, to watch for a possible return of the exiles in force. Taking advantage of the absence of the Earl, the Welsh invaded Herefordshire. The levies of the county and the Norman garrison of Ewias met them at Leominster. The English and foreign troops failed to act together, and the Welsh King had the victory, \"slay- ing many worthy Englishmen, and many of the French,\" says the Chronicle, markedly omitting to give any honourable epithet to the latter. i For this hatred of castle-building cf. Schiller, WiUulm Tell. I., 3. 10 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. News of this defeat, reaching Godwin in Flanders, encouraged him to attempt to secure his return, if need be, by force of arms. He was satisfied that if he once landed in England, the great majority of Englishmen would side with him rather than with the foreign priests and courtiers who surrounded the King. Gather- ing a fleet, therefore, on the Flemish coast, he sailed for England, but was driven back by a violent storm. Earl Ralph meanwhile had gone out from Sandwich to meet him, and either shirked the battle or failed to find his whereabouts in the storm. This failure roused such discontent among the men-at-arms, that the King removed his nephew from the command of the fleet, which, strangely enough in view of the threatening danger, was disbanded ; or, according to another account, the crews forsook their ships, and returned home, either in disgust at Earl Ralph's incompetence, or from sympathy with Godwin. With that helpless incompetence which always marks him, Edward summoned his favourite to him, and took him with him, at this crisis of their fate, on a hunting expedition in Wiltshire. Godwin, mean- while, joined by a fleet brought by his son Harold from Ireland, sailed into the Thames without opposition, and was hailed by the men of London as a deliverer from the foreign yoke (September, 1052). When he heard that Godwin's fleet was in the Thames, the King, with the Earls Ralph and Odo, and other Norman nobles, hastened to London, which he reached about the same time as Godwin reached it. It seemed as if a battle was inevitable : Godwin had only to give the word, and Earl Ralph, Osbern Pentecost, and all their tribe would have been annihilated by the English warriors, who had fought in every fight since Assandun. But Godwin, wishing to secure a bloodless return, obtained from the King that the matter should be referred to the Witan, to be called together the next day. The result of the meeting was already certain ; Godwin would be restored, and the French favourites banished, or even executed, such was the temper of the people. That night the whole company of Normans, priests and knights alike, mounted their horses and rode for their lives. The Bishops of Canterbury and London got over to France in an old, crazy ship. \" Some went north,\" says the chronicler, \" to Robertes Castle, some west to Pentecost's Castle \" in Ewias. Next day the expected happened ; Godwin and his sons except Sweyn were restored, and the Norman gang, with a few exceptions, banished. Among the exceptions was Ralph, who was left undis- turbed in his government of Herefordshire the only foreigner who retained an Earldom. But Osbern Pentecost and the friends who had taken refuge with him in the Castle of Ewias were outlawed, one and all. Conscious of guilt, or fearful of popular vengeance, they fled, save only Osbern himself, and a comrade named Hugh, who threw themselves on the mercy of Earl Leofric the Peace-maker of those THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. II unquiet times and surrendered the castle into his hands. With Leofric's safe conduct they passed into Scotland, and took service with King Macbeth. The Castle was dismantled, and the lands that had been Osbern's, including Ewias, were either then or later given to his nephew, Alured of Marlborough, who, at the Conquest, was allowed by William Fitz-Osbern to retain them, and who still held them twenty years later, at the time of the Survey. On the death of Godwin, which took place in the following year, many of the Norman favourites returned, including Richard, son of Scrob, and his son Osbern, who was made Sheriff of Herefordshire. But Osbern Pentecost seems never to have returned. Possibly he died with Macbeth, some six years later, in his last great fight at Dunsinane. The returned exiles, however, were in a far different position than they had been before the outlawry of Godwin. No Norman held any high office during the last thirteen years of Edward's reign, when Harold was King in all but the name. Only Ralph retained his Earldom, owing this exceptional favour to his royal blood, and his position of especial favourite with the King. Indeed he was very widely looked upon as a possible successor to the throne. The King was childless, Ralph was his sister's son, and if Edward's personal inclinations had decided the succession, it certainly would have been Ralph's. But Ralph was a Norman of the Normans, detested by the English, and himself despising them and their ways ; and, more important still, he was, if not the coward men believed him to be, yet at any rate strangely unlucky as a warrior. He was shortly now to prove this in an adventure which won for him the title of \" Ralph the Timid.\" Early in 1055, Alfgar, Earl of the East Angles, was banished for treason. He gathered a force in Ireland and allied himself with Gruffydd, Prince of North Wales. The combined host prepared for a devastating inroad into Herefordshire. Marching through Ewias, they entered Archenfield inhabited, as we shall see in a succeeding chapter, by Welshmen living under English allegiance, and bound to service against their independent brethren and ravaged with special delight the lands of their recreant kinsmen. So thoroughly did they complete their work, that in the Domesday Survey 30 years later, it is mentioned that the effects of this ravaging were still to be seen. Slowly the destroyers advanced north, harrying as they went, until they came within two miles of the City of Hereford. It is worth while here to quote Freeman's word-picture of the city on the Wye, as it was in those days : \" By the banks of the Wye rose the Minster, low and massive, but crowned by one or more of those tall, slender towers, in which the rude art of English masons strove to reproduce the campaniles of Northern Italy. Around the Church were gathered the houses of the 12 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. Bishop, the Canons, the citizens, the last at least mainly of wood. Over all rose the square mass of the Norman Donjon, an ominous foreboding of the days which were soon to come.\" This Donjon had been built by Earl Ralph, for the protection of the town, and from it at last he issued to meet the invading forces of Alfgar and Gruffydd. His army was composed partly of levies from the district, partly of his own French and Norman following. He had, however, insisted on the English being mounted, as were his Normans. Accustomed to fight on foot, the English protested in vain. Ralph despised them and their methods of warfare, and without previous training in the Earl's new continental tactics, a hastily gathered levy was taken into battle mounted on horses brought from the plough, and all unaccustomed to the sights and sounds of battle. The natural consequence followed ; the whole force took to flight before the battle was well begun. The monk of Worcester adds that Ralph himself was the first to fly, a statement which may be due to national dislike. In any case the flight soon became a rout. The active Welsh, though on foot, easily overtook the clumsily-mounted English, of whom some 500 were slain, while of the victors not a man was wounded. Thus Earl Ralph earned his nickname of \" Ralph the Timid.\" The victorious Welshmen entered Hereford the same evening, sacked and set fire to the whole town, slew seven of the Canons as they stood in the great western door of the Cathedral, burned the beautiful building, with all its relics and ornaments, and killed or carried into captivity numbers of the citizens. Even the strong walls of the Citadel were demolished. Laden with rich booty, the Welsh went back to their hills, leaving nothing standing in the town. The saintly Bishop Athelstan, old and blind, died of a broken heart within three months. Blinded by partiality though he was, it was now clear even to King Edward that the defence of the border could no longer be left to his incapable nephew. Harold, Godwin's son, now Earl of the West Saxons, was sent to Hereford to set matters right again. He followed the Welsh into the hills and drove them to take refuge in South Wales. Then he set himself to re-build and strongly to fortify the city of Hereford, which he surrounded with a wall. Two years later (December, 1057) Ralph the Timid died, and was buried in the distant minster of Peterborough, to which he had been a benefactor. He left a young son Harold, who afterwards was to give his name to Ewias. The Earldom of Hereford, however, was added to that of the West Saxons, held, as we have seen, by Harold, son of Godwin, whose great campaign against the Welsh in 1063 is beyond the limits of our history. 1 i See Appendix, Note F.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 13\n\nCHAPTER IV .\n\nWILLIAM FITZ-OSBERN AND THE RE-BUILDING OF THE CASTLE.\n\nWITHIN six months of his victory over Harold, near Hastings, King William re- turned to Normandy, leaving as his Viceroy William Fitz-Osbern,whom he had created Earl of Hereford (with whom was associated Odo, Bishop of Bayeux). The new Viceroy was the son of that Osborn the Seneschal, who had been the loyal guardian of the infant Duke, and had paid for his fidelity with his life, defending his ward (in 1040) against a treacherous attempt at murder. William never forgot this faithful act of devotion, and adopted his name-sake, Osbern's son, as his familiar friend through life. It was William Fitz-Osbern \" the bold of heart \" Li filz Osber el cuer hardi, as the Roman de Rou calls him who bade Duke William when the news came of Edward the Confessor's death, and Harold's succession to the throne of England, not mourn, but be up and doing, and wrest the Kingdom from the usurper. Fitz-Osbern's appointment as Earl of Hereford shows the important position the county held in the early years of the Conquerer's reign. Not merely was it the Welsh border, which needed a strong man in command, but the King as yet was King only of the South. Mercia and Northumbria still were unsubdued, and the new Earl of Hereford was to keep watch against the Mercians also. Of his adminis- tration we have two very opposite views in our original authorities. The Norman historian of William paints a glowing picture of the just government of Fitz-Osbern, while the English Chronicler speaks with loathing of his cruelty and oppression. This loathing was increased by the diligence with which the new Viceroy pressed on with the work of castle-building. He had been specially bidden to be diligent in this great work of securing the obedience of the land by the building of castles ; and memories of Osbern Pentecost, and of Richard, son of Scrob, made the men of Herefordshire look with special horror on a castle. And now they saw not merely the hated castle of Pentecost in Ewias re-built, but others like it, planted on every point of vantage along the whole border. Well was it for the new Earl that he lost no time in thus strengthening his defence. For Edric, surnamed by the Normans \" The Savage,\" holding practically all the North of the county, refused submission to the new King. He did not scruple to call in the Welsh, and once again the unhappy districts of Ewias and Archenfield were laid waste, in August, 1067. Only the town of Hereford itself, the Castle of Ewias in the South, and Richard's Castle in the North were held by their Norman garrisons, and that with difficulty ; for it is plain that at one time they were reduced to great straits. On the arrival of Norman reinforcements, the Welsh as usual fled back into their hills. For two or 14 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. three years longer Edric, with the support of his Welsh allies, held out amongst the hills and woods of the border against the new rulers of the land. In 1070, how- ever, he made his submission to the King, and was pardoned, anticipating by only a few months the better known submission of Hereward \" the Wake \" at Ely. But after the Welsh invasion of 1067, it was only on the far western border that Fitz- Osbern met with opposition. For the four short years during which he held his Earldom, it is not too much to say that he \" reigned \" over the country from Severn's mouth to Richard's Castle, as the petty sovereign of a feudal principality. Follow- ing the precedent already set in Ewias and Richard's Castle, he divided the whole country-side into \" Castelries,\" organised on the quasi-military system which cha- racterized the Marches for some centuries. From Chepstow to Shrewsbury, along the whole border, there arose in less than two years one continuous chain of fortresses. It is to William Fitz-Osbern, more than to any other man, that we owe the exceptional status of the Lords Marchers. By lavish pay and grants of land, he attracted a large following of Norman Knights, and extended to them and to all Burgesses of Hereford of French birth certain privileges which had been customary in his Norman Lordship of Breteuil \" leges et consuetudines qua sunt in Hereford et in Bretuill\" says Domesday. The most important of these privileges was that Burgesses of French birth should not be fined more than twelve pence for any offence save three reserved pleas (pacem regis infractam et heinfaram et forestellum). Attracted by these privileges granted to \" Francigena burgenses\" many Norman adventurers settled on favourable terms in the borough of Hereford. So valuable was this Norman element, or so welcome were the rights conferred by the \" Laws of Breteuil,\" that they spread to many new places in the March, Ludlow, Shrewsbury, Montgomery, and even distant Rhuddlan. Thus gradually arose those \" Customs of the March \" which two centuries later were pleaded by the Lords Marchers as valid even against the direct orders of King Edward I. in person. Another trace of the short \" reign \" of William Fitz-Osbern is to be found in the many grants of land in Herefordshire to the two monastic houses that he founded in Normandy, at Cormeille, and at Lyra. To the latter he gave lands near Ewias, at Kentchurch. In 1071 he was called away from the work which he was accomplishing with such wondrous energy as if already he foresaw how short his time was to the war in Flanders, where he lost his life. Such was the reign of the great ruler whom the Conqueror made his nearest personal friend. \" Stark man he was and great awe men had of him,\" says the Chronicler of Duke William : and the same may be truly said of his great name-sake THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 15 and lieutenant, who rebuilt our castle in Ewias Harold, and built another at Ewias Lacy. Of the masonry of the castle of Ewias Harold, scarcely a stone now remains. But the plan can easily be traced. The extremity of a tongue of high land, rising abruptly in the angle where two streams meet, had been already cut off by a ditch, and, by the addition of a mound and an outer circle of earth-works, turned into a.burh in or about 915 A.D. Some time between 1046 and 1051, Osbern Pentecost had built his Norman castle there, which was demolished in 1052 or 1053. In all probability, William Fitz-Osbern and Alured of Marlborough, in rebuilding the castle in 1067, followed the lines of the previous building, adding such improve- ments as the then rapidly advancing science of military architecture had arrived at in the intervening time. The ground plan may be roughly described as a circular platform of about two hundred yards diameter, with a mound sixty or seventy feet high, touching the circumference on the side where the ditch cuts off the castle from the high ground of the original ridge. On this, the weakest side, a couple of towers were placed, to command the approach from the ridge. The keep itself was some thirty yards in diameter, built of the old red sand-stone of the district, and probably many-sided. The ascent from the lower ward to the keep was, it would seem, by a flight of steps. The crescent-shaped platform of the lower ward, strengthened by large earth-banks and encircled by a curtain wall, contained a number of domestic buildings, and a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas. Some considerable remains of the castle were still standing in Leland's day (about 1550), but before the days of the Civil War as we learn from Richard Symonds the neighbouring farmers had grubbed up even the foundations for building their barns and lime-kilns. One of the latter, hard by the mound, is all that can now be seen of the masonry of the castle. 1 i See Appendix, Note G.\n\n1 6 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nCHAPTER V .\n\nEWIAS IN DOMESDAY.\n\n\" A S a historical monument,\" says Mr. Freeman, \" the value of the Domesday [* cannot be over-rated.\" It gives us a sort of map and picture of England as it was in 1086, at the completion of the Norman Conquest. It sets before us the whole life of the age, with a thousand local and personal details which no chronicler could give. The survey is wonderfully complete ; we are told who held the land when the survey was made, and who held it in the time of King Edward : we are told the number of inhabitants, the extent of the estate, how much was arable land, how much wood, and how much pasture. \" So very narrowly he caused it to be traced out,\" complains the English Chronicler, \" that there was not a single hide, nor one yard of land, nor even it is shame to tell, though it seemed to him no shame to do an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was left that was not set down in his writ.\" We may obtain a very fair idea of our Ewias Lordship in the time of King William from the following passage, translated from the Herefordshire Survey : \"Alured of Merleberge holds the Castle of Ewias from King William. For the King himself granted to him the lands which Earl William [Fitz-OsbernJ, who rebuilt the Castle, had given him, that is five carucates of land in Ewias, and another five carucates at Manetone. The lands pertaining to the Castle, which had belonged to Ralph of Bernai, the King granted to him [i.e. to Alured]. There he has in demesne two carucates, and nine Welshmen with six carucates, paying seven sextaries of honey [each year], and twelve bordarers working [for their Lord] one day a week. There are four Ox-herds, and one other man paying six-pence [each year]. Five Knights, Richard, Gilbert, William, and William and Hernold have five carucates in the demesne and twelve bordarers, and three fisheries, and twenty-two acres of pasture. Two others, William and Ralph, 1 hold two carucates of land. Turstan holds lands bringing in nineteen pence [each year] and Warner lands bringing in five shillings. These have five bordarers. This castelry is worth ten pounds.\" In trying to make out the full significance of this entry, let us begin by explaining a few of the terms. A carucate, usually called in the days of the Confessor \" a hide,\" is \"as much land as was sufficient to be cultivated by one plough,\" and is generally taken to be equal to one hundred and twenty acres. This was supposed to be the amount necessary for the support of one tenement. None of this land was i It is possibly from this Ralph that the parish of Rowlstone derives its name. In the earlier references to it, Rowlstone is always called \" Villa Radulphi,\" i.e. Ralph's or Raoul's town. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 17 inclosed, save here and there a few acres of meadow, mowed for hay. The great stretches of arable were divided into narrow strips, a furlong in length and some two perches in breadth, separated by turf-balks. (The furlong or furrow-long is \" the distance which a team of oxen can conveniently plough without coming to rest \"). The holding of each tenant was made up of one or more score of these strips, scattered about in the three huge plots into which the estate was divided. One of these plots lay fallow every year, another grew a crop of corn, and the third was planted with vetches, beans, or peas. The lands of the manor or castelry consisted of the demesne lands, or home farm, the lands held by free tenants, and the lands held by villans or bordarers : the difference between these two seems to have consisted mainly in the amount of land they held. The villans, corresponding to the Saxon ceorls, were the most important class of unfree tenants, holding perhaps thirty acres, scattered about in the way we have described. The bordarers were cottagers who held from one to ten acres. Both of these, in return for their holdings, gave their lord a certain number of days' work in each year on his home farm, which was entirely cultivated by this unfree labour. As money became more plentiful, and its use crept even into the country districts, the practice of commutation of service began, the villans paying money instead of their services. (In reading of money payments, we must constantly keep in mind that money was at the time of the Conquest more than thirty times its present value). They were not, however, farmers in the true sense of the word, a farmer being originally that particular villan who held his land on condition of being bound to supply feorm i.e. food and entertainment to the non-resident lord when he visited the manor. All lands whatever were held ultimately from the King himself, who granted them in fee to his tenants in capite, the greater barons, who rendered military service in return. These barons sub-let their land to others. These, keeping a portion in their own hands as a home farm in demesne as it is called let out the rest, some in \" Knights-fees,\" to Knights rendering military service for forty days each year : some to free tenants, socmen or yeomen, paying in service, or in kind, or in money\": some to villans and \" bordarers \" (i.e. dwellers in boarded huts or cottages) paying in service. Coming now to the castelry of Ewias, we find that Alured l of Marlborough kept some two hundred and forty acres as his home farm, the land immediately round the castle, where now is the village of Ewias Harold. This was worked by the unfree service of twelve \" bordarers \" working each one day a week. (It would seem that the Lord of Ewias let off his \" bordarers \" on easy terms, for usually they i Alured is a Norman-French proper name corresponding to the Old English Alfred, our modern Alfred. 1 8 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. rendered two days and sometimes three days a week.) The rest of his land Alured let out on varying tenures. The land nearest to the home farm, called actually in demesne in the Survey, he let out to five knights, whose names are given, on a strictly military tenure. These also had twelve \" bordarers \" to work their land. Other lands possibly the distant portions at Manetone were held by William, Ralph, Turstan, and Warner, who were free tenants or Socmen unless William and Ralph were knights, for the wording of this passage is somewhat ambiguous and they had five \" bordarers.\" This land of Manetone was situated \" in valli Stradelie\"^ now called the Golden Valley. Manetone had been seized soon after the Conquest by Ralph of Bernai, one of the most unscrupulous of the Norman adventurers who swarmed into the borderland. He seems at one time to have been Sheriff of Here- fordshire. Whether as Sheriff or as a private adventurer, he laid unjust hands on all he could, sparing not even the Church. He carried out a series of systematic aggres- sions on the lands of the monastery of Worcester, which spoliation, later on, his heir compounded for by giving a portion to a Norman religious house. Most of his unjustly acquired lands in Manetone, however, the King took from him, and restored to the Lordship of Ewias, though as we find from a later entry in the Survey Ralph got back one carucate, which he is expressly stated to have taken unjustly (abstulit injuste). Quite apart from the other tenants scarcely indeed bound to the Lordship at all, save for the annual quit-rent of honey were the nine Welshmen, who shared seven hundred and twenty acres between them. They, like their kinsmen in Archen- field, lived under laws and customs of their own, sanctioned by the King himself, and written at length in the Survey. 2 These Welshmen of the Border lived under English allegiance, and were bound to military service against their independent brethren. Indeed, they claimed the right, in any expedition into Wales, to form the van in the march, and the rear in the retreat. They neither understood nor were interested in the English system of local government by Shire-Mote and Hundred-Mote, which was fitfully at work even in these unsettled border districts. And a fine of two shillings, or an ox, was imposed on them if they were not represented in these little local parliaments. They paid their dues entirely in honey, of which large quantities were always needed for making the mead, or sweetened beer, in which our forefathers delighted. The bordarers no villans are mentioned as holding land in Ewias were also probably of Ibero-Celtic race, though with some English admixture ; but they had passed completely under the dominion of the Norman lords, whilst those i See Appendix, Note F. 2 See Appendix, Note H. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 19 referred to as ' Welshmen\" had preserved a certain amount of independence. They all spoke Welsh, however, and continued to speak it for some centuries though English blood, and the English language were gradually introduced. As late indeed as the Act of Uniformity, the Bishop of Hereford is joined with the Welsh Bishops in the duty of providing a Welsh translation of the Prayer Book. At the time of the Survey, Welsh and Norman-French were virtually the only languages spoken in Ewias, save the Latin of the Churches. In the Pipe Rolls, as late as the reign of Henry II., the official title of the whole county is given as \" Herefordshire in Wales.\"\n\n20 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nCHAPTER VI .\n\nHAROLD OF EWIAS.\n\nWE have seen in a previous chapter that Earl Ralph, the nephew of the^Confessor, at his death in December, 1057, left a young son Harold. Had this son been older, he might certainly, as Freeman suggests, have been a claimant to the throne on Edward's death in 1066. He was the nearest of kin to the dead King, and it would seem that he did not inherit his father's timid nature as certainly his son Robert did not. But, though we do not know his exact age, he could only have been a boy in January, 1066. For he was then a minor in the wardship of Queen Edith, widow of the Confessor and daughter of Earl Godwin. Hence it was that while the ill-starred Atheling, grandson of Edmund Ironsides, was obliged to flee and join the Danes, the great-grandson of Ethelred the Unready, thanks to his guardian's Norman sympathies, was left in possession of his father's lands. From this it would seem that Harold's mother, Gytha or Gueth, was dead ; and this being so, it is natural that the boy should be placed in the wardship of the house of Godwin. For in spite of Earl Ralph's love of all things French, he not only had married an English woman, probably of Godwin's house or kin, but Godwin's greatest son, Harold the Earl, had become Godfather to the child of this marriage. It was the influence of his guardian that prevented the boy Harold's claims to the throne from being brought forward, as those of the Atheling were. For Queen Edith, though Godwin's daughter, was the avowed partizan of the Normans. When, a fortnight after the battle of Hastings, William appeared before Winchester, then held by the Do wager- Queen, she welcomed him with gifts and offers of submission. Strangely enough, the lands which the Queen's ward held lay, as yet, not in that Hereford- shire where his name was to survive through so many centuries, but in the shires of Gloucester, Worcester, Warwick, and Middlesex. One of his manors in the latter county was lost to him while still a minor, through the carelessness or actual unfaithfulnes of the Dowager-Queen, his guardian. For it is recorded in Domesday that at Edward's death the manor of Eia in Middlesex was in her hands as Harold's guardian, and that soon afterwards she leased it for ^\"3 a year to William the Chamberlain, who at her death in 1074 held it directly from the King. Harold never recovered the estate, and it passed later into the hands of Geoffrey de Mandeville. It is possible that after the Conquest the new King would have given to Harold the Hereford Earldom which his father held, had it not been that this border Earldom, beyond all others, needed a trusty soldier, and a statesman of great tact TOM P. OF ROBERT DE EVVIAS, ABBEYDORE. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 21 and ripe experience. At his majority, however, which he attained in or about 1070, Harold came into very considerable estates in the counties above-mentioned. The Herefordshire land which was to be his, was still held in 1086 by Alured of Marl- borough. Exactly how or when Harold became possessed of this Ewias land it is not possible to explaim. Nor does it seem quite clear why one who was already \" Lord of Sudeley,\" and other more important manors, should at once begin to take his name from his last acquired lordship. At any rate, he soon begins to be called in all official documents \" Harold of Ewias,\" and the lordship itself begins to be called Harold's Ewias as distinguished from the Ewias of the Lacy family and the village retains the name to this day. It may be that the castle of Ewias was his favourite home, and hence in a long life for he lived to be at least seventy he became closely identified with the place. It is interesting, and possibly significant, to note that Harold succeeded Alured of Marlborough, not merely in the lands of Ewias, but also in four manors in Somerset, part of the \" Honour of Boulogne.\" Possibly we have here a clue to the connection of Harold with Alured. * For the latter held some of his lands, at any rate, from Eustace of Boulogne, the second husband of Goda, Harold's grandmother. Of the vast estates held in England by the Count of Boulogne, many had come to him from his royal wife. And though she had long been dead (she died circ. 1056) it is most likely that when the lands held by Alured of Marlborough lapsed to the \" Honour,\" Count Eustace granted them to the only surviving grandson of his wife. At any rate, under Henry I. \" Harold of Ewias \" is found among the Knights of Count Eustace, and in the reign of John, Harold's then heir, Robert de Tregoz, is returned as holding lands from the \" Honour of Boulogne,\" by Knight-service. 2 Of Harold's foundation of the Priory of Ewias, and his gifts to it, we shall speak in later chapters. Of the time of his death we know nothing. But as late as 1 1 20, we find Count Eustace in the Colchester Cartulary confirming a gift of ten manors to St. John's Abbey, Colchester. Among the witnesses to this charter are two of the Count's own sons, and \" Harold of Ewias and his son Robert,\" with other tenants of the manor. The wife of Harold of Ewias is unknown. I conjecture her to have been the \"Alveva uxor Heraldi,\" who is mentioned in Domesday as holding lands in Buck- inghamshire, near to the lands once held by Harold's mother Gueth. He left five sons, Robert, Roger, John, Alexander, and William.

I John the eldest son. But the list in the Charter founding Ewias Priory must be taken as our final authority on this point. * Robert inherited the Lordship of Ewias, and John that of Sudeley and Toddington. The Worcestershire land went also to John ; and we find him, later on, granting one hide of land in Droitwich to his nephew Richard, the younger son of Robert of Ewias. It is not within our plan to follow the history of the Sudeley Lordship. But we may note that nearly two hundred years afterwards, in April, 1282, a later John de Sudeley brings a troop of eight lances to a gathering at Chester for the Welsh war. Of the three remaining sons of Harold, Roger, Alexander, and William, we know nothing. The Lordship of Ewias, which fell to Robert, contained, according to one account, no less than forty-seven fees held in capite (that is, direct from the King), with others held from the \" Honour of Boulogne.\" Of these lands we may mention, besides Ewias and Manetone in Herefordshire, the manors of Pontington and East Chelworth in Somerset, Upton and Teffont Ewias in Wiltshire, and Essendene in Buckinghamshire. Robert of Ewias, unlike his grandfather, \" Ralph the Timid,\" was a warrior from his youth, and lived only to fight the Welsh. We are told in the Gesta Stephani that Robert of Ewias was not only a man of the very noblest birth, but also of the highest courage. In 1135, when the strong hand of Henry I. was withdrawn from Wales, the Welsh rose in revolt, and attacked the Flemish settlements in Pembrokeshire and Glamorgan. They destroyed most of the castles, and slew many of the foreign settlers, both Norman and Flemish. King Stephen got together a strong force and sent it against the revolted Britons, under the command of Robert of Ewias. Starting not probably from Ewias, but from Gloucester, Robert crossed into South Wales, and there gained a great victory over the Welsh. He \" re-built and made impregnable,\" one of the castles dismantled by the Welsh, which is not, unfortunately, mentioned by name. Then, leaving a chosen band as garrison, resolute to hold out to the last, Robert returned to England with a few followers to recruit his forces. The Castle was immediately invested by a large body of the enemy, and after a long siege the garrison was obliged, by famine, to surrender, Robert not being able to bring up his re-inforce- ments in time to save them. Whether or not the Lord of Ewias took part in the fierce civil warfare, which marked the twenty years of Stephen's reign, we have no means of discovering. From what we know of Robert's character, we may conclude, in the absence of any scrap of direct evidence, that he held himself apart from the pillage, bloodshed, and misrule of that terrible time, ruling righteously his i See appendix, Note I. . THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 23 own domain, and fighting only the ever restless Welsh on his Western border. Of the lands which he left to his son, Robert the Second of Ewias, we are able to make out from the Red Book of the Exchequer a fairly complete return, which will be found in the appendix. 1 Robert seems to have been even more generous in his gifts to the Church than his father Harold had been. For the cartulary of the Priory of Ewias contains no less than five grants from Robert to the monks of Ewias. He founded also in the year 1147 the Cistercian Abbey at Dore, in which he was buried, and he was a benefactor also to the alien Priory of Craswall. His tomb with recum- bent figure in full armour, is still to be seen in Abbeydore Church. When he died is not certain, but by his wife, Sibilla, he left four sons, Robert, Richard, William, and Herbert. Of these Robert, the eldest, succeeded his father in the Lordship of Ewias. Sibilla de Ewias survived her husband, and in her last illness if we may believe the scandal-loving Gerald de Barri was made a monk of Dore Abbey in the following manner : The monks of Dore, knowing that she was rich, and would leave much money, and was now very near her end, visited her assiduously, and more suo carmina dira susurrantes never ceased from their solicitations until \"with all the solemnity of psalms and prayers, with which men were wont to be made monks, they made her a monk, with tonsure and cowl complete.\" \" The question is left open,\" says the scornful Gerald, \" whether in their Latin phrase, the newly initiated one should be called ' hie monachus ' or ' hsec monacha,' and whether if she had recovered she would have been taken to the Abbey and left with the other brothers in the refectory and the dormitory.\" The Prior of Ewias, always somewhat jealous of the newer religious house, which was already so much more wealthy and powerful than his own, was fiercely indignant at this proceeding ; but, nevertheless, \" although she had been made a monk and forcibly snatched away from him by outside monks as though by open robbers, he buried her as his parishioner in the graveyard of Ewias, together with the habit thus fraudulently put upon her.\" \" It is strange,\" sneers Gerald in conclusion, \" that these monks, though they will not receive women alive within the enclosures of their houses, seem yet so anxious to welcome them in their death, not however the poor and destitute, but those only for whom Queen Money coming before them throws open the doors.\" Of the next Lord of Ewias, Robert Fitz-Robert, we know very little. His wife's name was Petronilla, but of what family she came is unknown. The story of Robert's dispute with the Abbot of Gloucester concerning the Priory of Ewias i See Appendix, Note^J.\n\n24 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\n(1194-1196) will be narrated in a later chapter. He had no male issue ; and his only daughter, Sibilla, became the heiress of Ewias. She had married, during her father's life-time, in the year 1194 or earlier, Robert de Tregoz. By him she had a son, John, who died young, and another son, Robert, who inherited Ewias after her. Her husband is found executing a deed in his own name in 1196 or early in 1197. From this we gather that Robert Fitz-Robert, his father-in-law, must have died very shortly after the settlement of his dispute with the Abbey of Gloucester. Whether in fear that the monks of Dore might get hold of her, as they had done in the case of his mother, Sibilla, or for some other reason, Robert P'itz-Robert left to his wife, Petronilla, for her life-time, the manor of Eton Foy, at some distance from the dangerous neighbourhood of Dore. We find her, in 1204, carrying into the King's Court her dispute with the Abbot of Gloucester concerning the advowson of Foy, which she claimed. The Justices (William de Cantilupe and Simon de Pateshull) gave the advowson to the Abbot, who is ordered, however, to pay to Petronilla de Ewias four marks of silver. Late in 1196 or early in 1197, Robert de Tregoz followed Richard I. to Normandy, and never returned. He was with Richard at Andelys in 1197 helping at the building of Chateau Gaillard, Richard's \" pretty child,\" as he lovingly called it, the most perfect of the fortresses of the middle ages. Early in 1198, Robert de Tregoz is witness, at Andelys, to a Charter of King Richard, granting to Hubert, Bishop of Sarum, license to inclose and empark a wood. But he must have died very shortly after this, for in 1198 or early in 1 1 99 we find Sibilla married again to William de Newmarch, a kinsman of the Lord of Talgarth, and Brecon, and Elwel by him she had no children. This second husband died in or about 1 2 1 1 ; and Sibilla, still well under forty, and, we may presume, attractive both in her person and her estates, within a year or two married Roger de Clifford, 1 by whom she became the ancestress of the Earls of Cumberland. She seems to have been a strong and masterful woman, executing deeds in her own name and ruling Ewias and her three husbands with a firm, vigorous hand. She died in or about 1235, leaving Ewias to Robert de Tregoz, her son by her first husband. i His tomb, with statue in chain armour, is still to be seen in Abbeydore Church, and a charter of his will be found in Dugdale : s \" Monasticon,\" under Dore Abbey\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 25\n\nCHAPTER VII .\n\nTHE TREGOZ LORDS OF EWYAS.\n\nAS to the origin of the family of Tregoz or Tresgoz, I have not been able to find any evidence. The earliest mentioned of the family is William de Tregoz, who in 1131 was Lord of Tolleshunt Tregoz (in Essex). Of his son John de Tregoz we know nothing save that he was alive in 1167. His son Robert Tregoz was Sheriff of Wilts 3 Ric. I. (1192); and shortly afterwards, certainly before 1194, he married Sibilla de Ewias. We have seen in the previous chapter that he was Lord of Ewias for only two or three years. He left three sons, John, Robert, and William. Of these John died young (or at any rate before 1235). The third son, William, took orders, and became Rector of Kentchurch. Robert married probably not before his mother's death Juliana, daughter of William de Cantilupe, and sister of Bishop Thomas of Hereford, afterwards canonized. There is still existing a curious manu- script in Norman-French, written by this Juliana in her old age, giving an account of the origin of her family. As this account has never yet appeared in print, I give a translation of it in the appendix. 1 Of the life of Robert de Tregoz the Second, very little is known, save that he was the devoted friend and follower of Earl Simon de Montfort, and died with him at Evesham in 1265, as will be seen more fully in the next chapter. It may have been the influence of his wife and her brother which led Robert de Tregoz to side with De Montfort, for Thomas Cantilupe was a strong partizan of the great reformer, and was appointed by him Chancellor of England. Robert's wife, Juliana, survived her husband for more than twenty years. After Bishop Cantilupe's death in 1282, we find her receiving from his executors the proceeds of the manor of Earley. The deed still exists in which her son John Tregoz gives to her, as her dower, the manors of Alington and Eton. Robert's son, John Tregoz, had served as Seneschal of Ewias during the later years of his father's life. After Robert fell at Evesham, the son made his peace with the king, did homage, and was received into such favour that the fine incurred by his father's treason was in whole or in part remitted. To the lands inherited from his father, he began to add new possessions from the first. Among others, the manor of Holme Lacy, which then belonged to the See of Hereford, was granted to him by Bishop Cantilupe, his uncle, by the service of one knight's fee. The Lacy family, after whom it was called, had held it by the same service from earlier Bishops, as the \" Testa de Nevill\" shews. i See Appendix, Note K. 26 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. John Tregoz was a warrior from his boyhood. As Seneschal of Ewias he served an early apprenticeship to the art of war as did, a century later, the victor of Agin- court in the neighbouring castle of Grosmont. No better place could have been, in which to train a man for war ; for the holder of Harold's Castle was called upon almost daily to take part in one or other of the border skirmishes which never ceased in the unquiet land of Ewias, where no man ever went unarmed. He must, even in his youth, have won for himself a certain reputation, or the redoubtable Fulk Fitz-Warine would have scorned to give him his daughter, Mabilia, in marriage. The marriage took place probably in 1257 or 1258. Fitz-Warine gave his manor of Tretire as his daughter's dowry, but the title was disputed, and, more than twenty years later (in 1292), Walter de Huntley, and the other heirs of Walter de Muce- gros, impleaded John Tregoz for the manor, as having been the property of the said Walter. How the trial ended is uncertain. As a matter of course, the young Lord of Ewias fought through all the Welsh campaigns. These Welsh wars, which occupy so large a space in the history of Edward the First's reign, were really little more than a scientific organizing of the guerilla warfare which was always being waged in one or other of the border lord- ships. The Conquest of Wales is not a series of big actions, but a slow 'process of hemming in and wearing down the Welsh, and then erecting new castles to keep them in subjection. Already in 1274, when Edward returned from the Crusade, the whole border was in more than its usual state of unrest. It was clear that serious war was close at hand, though it did not break out till 1277. Through the greater part of the first campaign (1277-1278) John Tregoz and most of the Lords of the Middle Marches fought in Radnor and Brecknock, merely holding the Welsh in check, while the King's forces literally cut their way through the pathless forests of Flintshire. l The Knights-fees of the Ewias lands in Herefordshire and Wiltshire were nineteen, and there were others in other counties. But in 1277 the Lord of Ewias only brought with him three lances. He contributed however perhaps in place of the missing men, and even more acceptable a number of horses for the campaign. One of the greatest difficulties of the King was the procuring of horses. Officials were sent in 1277 to France to purchase war-horses at prices varying from five pounds for an ordinary trooper's horse, to eighty, one hundred, or even one hundred and twenty marks, for the splendid animals of the Barons themselves. When the war broke out again in 1282, John de Tregcz apparently with a force of ten or twelve lances joined, on the 3oth of June, i See Appendix, Note L. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 2^ the King's muster at Rhuddlan, for the last great campaign against Llywelyn. He and his troop, however, were assigned to the division led by Roger Mortimer, whom they joined at Whitchurch, in Salop. Hence they did not share in the terrible march of that autumn along the Menai Straits, but were occupied in subduing the Welsh of the Upper Severn and Radnor. On Edward's retreat to Rhuddlan, Llywelyn, with a small force, entered Radnorshire, intending to stir up the Welsh tenants of the Mortimers, or, it may be, to win over the Marcher Lords. Mortimer had died in October, and John Giffard had succeeded to the command. Early in December Llywelyn was slain in a petty skirmish on the banks of the Wye, not far from Builth. Next spring John Tregoz was almost certainly present with Roger L'Estrange and the young Mortimers at the seige of Bere, which practically ended the war. Four years later (January 2oth, 1286), a claim for scutage was made upon John Tregoz for this Welsh campaign. Whether it was due to some in- accuracy on the part of the officers of the Exchequer, or was as it seems a deliberate attempt at extortion, the attempt was resisted, and payment refused. In 1298 the claim was again revived on the part of the Exchequer, and an inquisition held before the King himself at York, on July i8th in that year, at which, it being proved that the service in 1282 had been duly performed, the claim was finally dropped. This war of 1282-3 led to quarrels between the Lords Marchers, which gave the King the opportunity, for which he had long been seeking, of taking strong measures to break down the March customs. The story of this struggle is given at length in the next chapter. John Tregoz joined the other Marcher Lords in the passive resistance they offered to the King at the trial of the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford. But throughout the long and bitter quarrel which followed, he sided with the King. In 1294 John Tregoz served, together with his brother-in-law, Fulk Fitz- Warine, in Gascony. It was apparently for his services in this Gascon campaign that the Lord of Ewias was rewarded by a writ of summons to Parliament. It was in the reign of Edward I. that the distinction between Greater and Lesser Barons, which had existed from the days of Henry I., was legally recognised. For more than a century before the Writs of 23 Edward I., the Great Council of the Realm had been usually composed of the Greater Barons only. But the Lesser Barons (who formed the bulk of the tenants of the Crown) though for various reasons rarely or never attending, yet possessed legally the right to appear. After the three Writs of 23 Edward I., a legal distinction is drawn between those who merely held a Barony by Tenure, and those whom the King, in the exercise of his 28 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. discretionary power, summoned to his Council by Writ. The Writs of this year (i 295) contain the names of fifty-three Barons out of about 250. John Tregoz is not one of the fifty-three, and, therefore, in that year he must still have been reckoned one of the Lesser Barons. But being now a man of some considerable mark, a tried soldier, and a staunch supporter of the Crown, he could no longer be left outside the Council. We find his name, therefore, as one of the Barons summoned by Writ to the Parliaments of 1297 and 1299. In 1297 came the unfortunate expedition to Flanders, which caused the rankling sense of wrong, on the part of the Earls of Norfolk and Hereford (Gloucester was already dead), to burst out into open defiance. Their feudal tenures did not bind them to foreign service, and they would not follow the King to Flanders. \" By God, Sir Earl,\" said the King, bitterly playing on the Bigod's name, \" you shall either go or hang.\" \" By God, Sir King,\" was the cool reply, \" I will neither go nor hang.\" Both the Bigod and the Bohun were deposed from their offices, and the King sailed for Flanders, leaving, however, lest the two Earls might break out into open war, some of his staunchest supporters and best fighting men as members of the Council of Regency. These included John Giffard, Alan Plokenet who gave his name to Allensmore and John Tregoz, who was made \" Constable of the Tower and Guardian of London.\" He was chosen also, with Geoffrey de Genville, to bear to the recusant Earls the King's message : \" If the Earls choose to accompany me, it will please me much ; but, if not, I request that they will not injure me, or at least my kingdom, in my absence.\" On the King's departure both sides prepared for war, and Hereford and Norfolk appeared in arms at the gates of London, demanding the confirmation of the Charter. Civil war was only averted by the news of Wallace's rising in Scotland. The Charter was hastily confirmed, Edward hurried back from Flanders, and an army was got together for service against the Scotch. On this expedition John Tregoz served with a troop of thirteen lances, and his son-in-law, William de Grandison, with ten. This campaign of Falkirk was apparently the last in which John Tregoz took part. He does not seem to have gone to Scotland in 1299, in which year he attended the Councils in February and in April. Next year (August 2ist, 1300) the greatest of the Lords of Ewias died. John Tregoz left no son, but two daughters. The elder of these, Clarissa de Tregoz, 1 early in the reign of Edward I. certainly before 1277 had married Roger la Warr, by whom she had a son, John la Warr. The second daughter, Sibilla, born in 1262, had married William de Grandison, younger brother of that i She died before her father, and was buried in Ewias Harold Church, where her tomb is still to be seen. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 2Q Otto de Grandison, who, having served with distinction through the Welsh Wars, was created in 1284 Justiciar of North Wales. Otto does not seem, however, to have discharged the duties of the post, since almost from the first he was absent abroad, and was represented in Wales by a deputy. In 1288 William de Grandison was appointed to the deputy Justiciarship. In 1300 the estate of John Tregoz by escheat reverted to the Crown, and a writ was issued (Jan. 25th, 1301) directing that an \" Inquisition/^/ mortem\" should be held, and the estate divided between John la Warr and Sibilla, wife of William de Grandison. This valuable document of portentous length, filling some 124 folios gives in minutest detail the possessions of the Barony of Ewias at the death of John Tregoz. It is fully described in a later chapter. It is sufficient here to say that a division was made (Dec. 21, 1301), by which the Manor and Castle of Ewias Harold were assigned to John la Warr, who, his mother Clarissa being dead, at once became Lord of Ewias, though his father, Roger la Warr, did not die until 1320. The new Lord began with an act of grace to his tenants, releasing them from the ancient service of repairing the mill- dam of the Castle Mill (amunder le estanke del molyn ke est apele Castelmelne ke esta devant la porte de la Priorie de Ewias). In spite of this act of grace, both the new heirs of the Ewias lands seem to have had difficulties with their tenants, who, the strong hand being removed which had ruled them so long, neglected their customary dues. In 1304 William de Grandison was driven to seize several of the beasts of one of his tenants and the ox of another, which led to legal proceedings in the King's Court. In the following year another case, in which both the heirs should have appeared before the Justices of the Bench at York, was postponed, because both William de Grandison and John la Warr were serving with the King in Scotland. Even as late as 1342, a few years before his death, John la Warr was still obliged to seize the oxen of his defaulting tenants. 1 This case enables us to see how the Castle of Ewias was defended. For it seems that a certain William of Leykesworth held a manor in the Barony by the service of providing two esquires for the ward of the Castle of Ewias. This service had not been performed since the death of John Tregoz. John la Warr died in 1347, having survived his eldest son John, whose son Roger, aged only 18, succeeded to the Lordship. He it was who made, in 1358, the Agreement with the Abbot of Gloucester and the Bishop of St. David's, sup- pressing the Priory. Neither John nor Roger la Warr seem to have lived much in Ewias. For in 1331 we find that John la Warr enfeoffed John de Claydon in I See appendix, Note M. 30 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. the Castle and Manor of Ewias Harold. Nine years later, both Castle and Manor were transferred to Warine Latimer. Roger la Warr the second died in Gascony in 1370, leaving two sons, John and Thomas : the former inherited his father's lands, the latter was a priest. From this time to the end of the century the history of the Lordship is somewhat obscure. We have an abundance of references to Ewias, 1 but they are perplexing, sometimes almost contradictory. In 1375 Edward la Despenser 2 died holding Ewias Harold (possibly in feof from John la Warr the second). In 1390 Sir John Montacute holds some of the Ewias lands in Herefordshire, together with three Wiltshire fees in the Barony : five years later these same lands are held by his widow. Early in 1399 John la Warr the younger has the Castle and Manor once more in his own hands. But in this same year the King commissions Sir Philip la Vache and others to enfeof William Beauchamp, Lord of Bergavenny, and others in the Ewias lands. 3 Here, for the first time since 1370, we are on firm ground again, or nearly so. William Beauchamp had inherited Bergavenny, as it was then called, from John de Hastings, Earl of Pembroke ; and by the deed we have referred to (i Henry IV.) the Castle and Manor of Ewias Harold were added to the Bergavenny lands. Other Ewias holdings seem to have been left in the hands of the Montacutes, who (now Earls of Salisbury) are mentioned as having lands in Ewias in 1409 and in 1429. William Beauchamp garrisoned both his Castles (of Abergavenny and of Ewias Harold) against Owen Glyndwr, as we shall see in a later chapter. He died in 1411 ; and, as late as 1436, his widow, Johanna, still held the Castle and demesne of Ewias Harold. His only son Richard (created Earl of Worcester in 1420) died in 1422, leaving a daughter and heiress Elizabeth. She married Edward Neville, son of Ralph, Earl of Westmoreland, and brought to him the Barony of Bergavenny, and (on the death of her grandmother, Johanna) the \" Castle, ville, and lordship \" of Ewias Harold. These possessions have been held by the Neville family without interruption to this day. ->3JC3J6-- i See appendix, Note N. 2 About 150 years earlier than this date a certain Philip de Dispenser is a witness toa charter in the cartulary of the Priory. See Chap, xii., No. 34.) 3 See appendix, Note O. THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 31\n\nCHAPTER VIII .\n\nTHE CUSTOM OF THE MARCH.\n\nIT is all but impossible to realize the position of Robert de Tregoz, and that of his son, John de Tregoz, in Ewias, without making some effort to understand that difficult and troublesome question, the custom of the March a question that still awaits full investigation by a competent scholar. Beset with difficulties as the whole subject is, we can only sketch, in briefest outline, the rise of the Custom of the March, and the struggle of the King to break it down. The Marcher Lordships had their origin, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, in the granting to the adventure-loving Normans, who had come over with the Conqueror, of licenses to hold as much of the border-lands as they could conquer. This was advantageous to the King in two ways. In the first place, it helped to form a strong barrier against the ever-present fear of inroads into England by the Welsh ; and, secondly, it diverted the high-spirited Normans, whose love of adventure and fighting might prove dangerous to the royal power, into a country where they had plenty to do, and little opportunity of giving trouble to the King. Here, in the \"no- man's land\" of the West, they built their grim Norman fortresses, surrounded them- selves with grim Norman men-at-arms, and became, in a short time, each the absolute ruler of a little independent Principality. Thus it came about that the Welsh Marches were the most thoroughly Normanised part of the kingdom. In the Northern Welsh border the Conqueror himself created the two counties Palatine under practically independent Earls of Chester and Shrewsbury. The latter of these, in the time of Henry I., had become so powerful that its Earl, Robert of Montgomery, dared to dictate to the King. Henry's vigorous action, however, crushed the power of the Palatine Earl, removed Snrewsbury from its position as a County Palatine, and gave the vast estates of the Montgomery family to others, to be held by Knight-service as were the English lands. Chester was left in its exceptional position, and has little to do with our story. It was a single strong power, pitched over against another single strong power the Prince of Gwynedd or North Wales and little came of their conflicts. But further south we have, on the one side, native tribes scattered and disunited, at war with one another as often as with the Normans, and, on the other side, bands of greedy adventurers, always pushing ahead, each fighting for his own hand, each eager to grasp more lands, to build new castles, and to attract new fighting men to his standard by granting new privileges. Hence, it is in the Middle Marches and the South that the custom of the March grew up, by the rise of Lordships whose independence, though not legalised as\n\n32 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. /\n\nthat of Chester, yet gradually became in practice as real, since for two centuries the King could spare very little time for looking into the condition of the Marches. We have seen, in the customs of Breteuil, that from the first the tenants of the March lived in the enjoyment of certain rights and privileges, sanctioned and even introduced by the Viceroy of the King himself. In the next place, there gradually arose the custom of conquering and annexing new land from the Welsh, without any reference to the Crown oi England ; and the tenants of the land thus annexed had no appeal from the Lord-Marcher to the King as overlord. (One right only was preserved by the Crown. If a Lord Marcher lost his land again to the Welsh, and called in the aid of the royal forces to recover them, the lands thus re-conquered reverted to the Crown.) Thus the first custom of the March is the power of the Lord to govern his own tenants absolutely, without reference to the King. Each Lordship had a court of its own, with jurisdiction completely independent of the King. The Clares in Glamorgan had all the authority of an absolutely independent monarchy. When King Edward passed through Glamorgan in 1284, Gilbert de Clare entertained him as though he were a brother sovereign. He certainly was as independent as the Earl Palatine of Chester. He had his own Curia Comitatus and compelled Henry III., and later on Edward I., to recognise it as independent of the Curia Regis; he appointed his own vice-comes or deputy ; had in short a complete imperium in imperio. This of Glamorgan is an extreme instance, but all the Marcher Lordships approximated more or less closely to this model. Being thus for all practical purposes in complete independence, it follows that the second of the March Customs was the right, claimed by the Lords Marchers, to make private war on one another, instead of referring their disputes to the King. In the Baron's war of 1264 the Lords Marchers held the balance of power between Earl Simon and the King, It must be confessed that in this struggle most, if not all of them, played a mean and selfish part. Devoid of any feeling of loyalty to the Crown, and incapable even of understanding Earl Simon's lofty patriotism, the Barons of the March fought entirely for their own hand, intent solely on maintaining their position as semi-independent magnates, privileged by March custom to raise their own armies, and to make war at will. This explains the otherwise meaningless changes of front by the Marcher Lords, as they thought either side was becoming too strong. Gilbert de Clare, for instance, fought side by side with Simon at Lewes, served with Prince Edward at Evesham, and took up arms against the King to prevent the proscription of the Baronial remnant after the battle. Roger de Mortimer was at first on the side of the Barons, and was even put upon THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 33 his trial by the King for treason. Obtaining his pardon he fought thenceforth for the King. John Giffard, too, was a Montfortian at Lewes, and did splendid work for the King at Evesham. We may conclude, perhaps, that Robert de Tregoz, the Lord of Ewias, was less selfish than the rest, and possibly even felt something of Earl Simon's passion for reform. At any rate he consistently supported the great patriot, and was one of the little band, who, \" having no will to live, if he died,\" fought round Simon to the last, falling one by one till the Earl was left alone, to be struck down by a blow from behind. When Edward I. came to the Throne he determined from the first to break the power of the Lords Marchers. Never again should they hold the balance of power between the King and his subjects. To secure this, his first need was to get together an army largely composed of paid professional soldiers, which would make him independent of all Feudal service. Hence we see, in the Welsh wars of 1282 and 1283, a curious struggle between the King and the Barons. The King wished to pay them and their men for their services ; but they stood on their rights, and insisted on the performance of their feudal obligations, bringing unpaid troopers even more than their quotas, and serving longer than their forty days. It was only by bribing the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford with high commands that the King induced them to agree to the raising of a paid force. This beginning of a standing army was the first serious blow at the power of the Lords Marchers, as it rendered the King, to some extent at any rate, independent of their unpaid feudal quotas. When the King was now feeling strong enough to try conclusions with the Lords of the March, chance gave him the opportunity, in a private war which arose between the two most powerful of the Lords, the Earls of Gloucester and Hereford. They had quarrelled about a strip of \" no-man's land \" at the foot of the Brecon Beacons, which each claimed as belonging to his March : and Gloucester's men had raided the Bohun lands. In January, 1290, the King issued a strongly worded proclamation calling on the Earls to abstain from active hostilities. Within a month, Gloucester's men, as if in open defiance, had once again raided Breconshire, and, by the custom of the Marches, the Earl received a third part of the loot, thus definitely becoming particeps criminis. This was the King's chance of introducing legal process into the March, and early in 1291 the two Earls were summoned to appear before a Royal Court of four judges, with a jury to be empanelled from the Lords Marchers them- themselves. The Earl of Hereford appeared, but not Gloucester. Of the Marcher\n\n34 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nLords John de Hastings, the two Mortimers, Theobald de Verdun, John Tregoz, and Geoffrey de Camville answered to their writs of summons ; but one and all refused to be sworn on the jury, pleading that such a trial was against the custom of the March. Next an attempt was made to empanel a jury of their tenants ; but, by pleading distance, or some flaw in the writ, most of the Lords evaded the claim. The two Lords of Ewias, John Tregoz of Ewias Harold, and Theobald de Verdun of Ewias Lacy, made no excuse, but simply declined to produce either steward or tenants. The trial, however, was carried to an end somehow. Gloucester was condemned in damages of ^100, and a renewal of the raids stringently forbidden in the King's name. The raiding, however, being continued as before in the debatable land, Edward himself in full Council tried the case again at Abergavenny. At this second trial both Hereford and Gloucester were condemned to imprisonment and confiscation of their estates. Bnt the King's honour having been vindicated, restitution was made to both Earls in the July following. Gloucester died some three years after this humiliation, but Hereford lived to revenge himself in the triumph of October, 1297, when, the King being absent in Flanders, the Earls of Hereford and Norfolk appeared at the gates of London with 1 500 mounted troops, and a vast army on foot, and extorted from the Prince Regent and his Council the promise that the new clauses of the Charter should be confirmed, which was done shortly afterwards by the King at Ghent. When the second Edward came to the throne, the Lords Marchers, finding him weaker and less resolute than his father, resumed their March privileges, which, slightly modified by the Court of the Marches created at Ludlow in 1478, they retained until 1535, when Henry VIII. abolished the whole system. 1 i See appendix, Note P\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 35\n\nCHAPTER IX .\n\nTHE LANDS OF EWIAS.\n\nAS WE have already seen, in Chapter VI., that, at the time of the Domesday Survey, the lands of Harold of Ewias lay in the counties of Gloucester, Worcester, Warwick, and Middlesex. The Middlesex land was lost to him while he was still a minor ; and at his death his lands in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Warwick shire went to his third son, John de Sudeley. The lands which his eldest son, Robert of Ewias, inherited, had all been acquired by Harold after 1086. Of these we can get some idea from the entries in the Red Book of the Exchequer, which will be found in the appendix. 1 From these entries it appears that in 1 166 Robert of Ewias held 19 Knights-fees in Herefordshire (which throughout is called \"Hereford in Wales,\") and an uncertain number in Wiltshire. In the same year more land seems to have been added to his possessions. For amongst others Godfrey de Scudamore, who had the largest Wiltshire holding under Robert, has four Knights-fees early in n 66, and towards the end of the year is said to hold these four de antiquo feodo, and one de novo. Some difficulty seems, however, to have arisen between the tenant and his lord ; for next year we are told that Godfrey de Scudamore holds his five Knights-fees from the King direct \" q uia Robertus de Ewias noluit recipere homagium suum;\" and in 1201 Peter de Scudamore holds the same five fees \"which had belonged to Robert of Ewias.\" When Robert de Tregoz the younger came into the lordship of Ewias, he must have received back from the King the five Knights-fees, which had been so long in dispute. For an entry in the Testa de Nevill (undated, but after 1234 and earlier than 1265) mentions a later Godfrey de Scudamore as holding 5^ Knights-fees from Robert Tregoz. The Wiltshire Fees in this entry amount to over eleven. The Herefordshire Fees lay in and around the \" ville \" of Ewias Harold, at Monnington Stradel in the Golden Valley, at Eton Tregoz, and at Pencombe. John Tregoz considerably increased the lands of the Barony during the thirty-five years of his vigorous rule. He died on August 2ist, 1300, and since he left no male issue, his lands by escheat reverted to the King. On January 25th, 1301, a writ was issued \" apud Neteleham\" ordaining that an \"Inquisition/^/ mortem\" should be held to decide \" how much land the said John held on the day of his death in his domain, as in fee from the King in capite, and how much he held from others, and for what service, and how much it was worth per annum with all its profits, and who was the nearest heir and of what age.\" This inquiry was to be held i Sec appendix, Note J.\n\n36 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD.\n\nin each district where John Tregoz had held lands, taking the evidence on oath of certain of the tenants and others. In an anonymous work bearing the title of \" Fleta,\" written in the reign of Edward I. as a sort of Vade Mecum for landlords, we have a complete statement of the details into which enquiry was made at such a survey of a manor. This statement will be found in the appendix. l Like his predecessors in the Lordship, and all the Barons of that day, John Tregoz held lands in many counties. This resulted from the settled policy of the Norman and Plantagenet Kings, who rewarded their followers with wide estates, but for their own safety did not allow these estates to be concentrated. Hence a Baron might hold a hundred or more manors, but they would be in a dozen different counties. We have in this an explanation of the apparent restlessness of the Barons in these early days. They roamed with a huge train of followers from one estate to another ; in each there was a great bustle of preparation for their coming. In a stay of a few days or weeks they consumed the produce stored up during the year, and then passed on to their next manor. Until money was plentiful enough to enable produce to be sold, they were kept continually on the move. The Tregoz lands in 1300 lay in Herefordshire, Wiltshire, Shropshire, Northampton, Somerset, and Surrey. In each of these counties an enquiry was held before the Escheator of the King : In Herefordshire at Hereford (June 2oth), at Ewias Harold (Oct. i8th), and at Eton Tregoz (Oct. 2Oth) ; in Wiltshire at Salisbury (June 27th), and at East Kennett (Oct. 25th); in Shropshire at Allbrighton (Thursday, Oct. 27th); in Northampton at Dodington (Saturday, Oct. i5th) ; in Somerset at \"Chywton\" (Oct. 22nd); and in Surrey at \"Sende juxta Ripele\" (May 3oth). It was proved on oath that the two nearest of kin to the deceased Baron were John la Warr, now aged twenty-three, son of Clarissa, the elder daughter of John Tregoz, and Sibilla de Grandison, his younger daughter, now aged twenty-eight (the men of Shropshire, however, returned her as \" thirty years old and more\"). The Escheator made the partition of all the lands between the two heirs at Trent on December 2ist, 1301. The record of this enquiry, a voluminous manuscript of one hundred and twenty-four folios of closely written Latin with contractions, gives a complete account not merely of the acreage of the lands, but of every house and cottage, with the names of every tenant; it gives also the rent, or other service which each tenant rendered for his holding. I propose here to give a brief summary of this return, adding in the appendix a full translation of the Herefordshire portions, viz., the lands of Ewias and Eton. 2 i See Appendix, Note Q. 2 See Appendix, Note R\n\nTHE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. 37\n\nDealing first with Herefordshire, we are told that the Manor of Ewias Harold, comprising some seven Knight's-Fees, was held by John Tregoz from the King in Capite per Baroniam. It is said to be in partibus Wallice, and with its members consisted of the \"ville\"of Ewias Harold itself ;> place called Mulstonton or Mulstoneston, which I cannot identify ; \" Puston in Straddel,\" now Poston near Peterchurch ; Pencumbe with Caldewell near Bromyard, where he held fifteen hides (eighteen hundred acres) belonging to the \" Honour of Ewias \" ; and Monnington Straddel in the Golden Valley, still so called. In the demesne or home farm of the Castle, there were four carucates of arable land (\" every one of which contains one hundred acres by the short hundred \"), twenty acres of meadow, six acres of pasture, and fourteen acres of wood. There were nine tenants-in-chief, hold- ing between them six Knights-fees. In the village of Ewias Harold itself, there were thirty-seven freeholders, and seventy-five custumarii, rendering \" aids \" and other services. Allowing for their families this would represent a popula- tion very much the same in number as at the present day. There were in the village the Castle garden, and the garden of the Prior. There were two water-mills, one bringing in twenty-six shillings and eight-pence a year, and the other thirteen shillings and four-pence. Of the freeholders each held a house and a certain amount of land, varying from a carucate to a few acres. The dues which they paid to the Lord varied very much in the different holdings. Thus Richard of Ewias for his house and one hundred acres paid nothing in money, but owed many feudal services, \" suit of Court every three weeks, Castle-ward, marriage dues, heriot and relief when it should fall.\" Henry de Eylston for a holding of the same extent renders all the above services and twelve pence a year. Then again Madoc ap Jeverard for a house and nine-and-a-half acres pays three shillings and nine- pence halfpenny each year ; while Jeverard ap Adam for an exactly similar holding pays only fourteen-pence. Hugh Gilbert pays five shillings and sixpence, and \" one sparrow-hawk at the feast of St. John the Baptist, or two shillings instead thereof.\" The customary tenants paid partly in money, and partly in work for the Lord, mowing and reaping, lifting hay, ploughing and the like. In Kentchurch which is a \" member \" of the manor there is a manor-house, with a garden (and a dovecote worth eighteen-pence a year), and in the demesne one hundred acres of arable, one-and-a-half acres of meadow, and one acre of pasture. There are in Kentchurch seven free tenants, and twenty customary tenants. In Eton Tregoz there are nineteen free and thirty customary tenants. Here also, as in Ewias Harold and Kentchurch, there is a perplexing diversity in the services and payments rendered for holdings of equal extent. 38 THE HISTORY OF EWIAS HAROLD. Coming now to Wiltshire, we find that there was in the \" Honour \" of Ewias the Manor of Alyngton, (now Allington, four miles North-East of Devizes) containing in demesne three hundred and fifty acres of land, together with pasture for twenty- four oxen and four hundred sheep. There are in Alyngton four free and twenty- three customary tenants Next in the hamlet of Est-Kenete (East-Kennett, five miles South- West of Marlborough) there are in demesne eighty acres of land with pasture, four free tenants and twelve cottars. Then follow particulars of thirteen and-a-half Knights-Fees, in places as far apart as Allcannings, between Marlborough and Devizes, Upton Scudamore near Warminster, and Teffont Ewias near Wilton. 1 The Shropshire lands of Ewias lay at \" Albriton \" (Albrighton) and were held from the King by the service of one Knights-fee. There were in demesne eighty acres of arable and four of pasture, with manor-house and garden. The rest of the estate was held by free tenants, who rendered only suit of Court. In Northampton John Tregoz held the manor of Great Doddington from John de Hastings by the service of qu"
