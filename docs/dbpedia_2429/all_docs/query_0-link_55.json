H. Jones, did not in fact die as the result of the First World War: see below\n\nThe Jesus College War Memorial was erected by Messrs Rogers and unveiled by Captain Angus Buchanan, VC, with a photograph appearing in the Oxford Journal Illustrated of 19 January 1921.\n\nBrief details about each of the above men\n\nThe following information was obtained from their pages on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website (CWGC)\n\nand the Oxford University Roll of Service, a book published in 1920 (OURS)\n\n(where the OURS military details conflict with CWGC, the latter have been recorded)\n\nAlso consulted: Ancestry for the England & Wales censuses and military records (including De Ruvigny's Roll of Honour)\n\nPANEL 1, top left\n\n[The first three names listed on this panel are out of alphabetical order]\n\nPANEL TWO, lower left\n\nPanel 3, lower middle\n\nThe first two names and the last three men surnamed Jones listed on this panel are out of alphabetical order\n\nPanel 4, top right\n\nThe first name listed on this panel is out of alphabetical order\n\nPanel 5, lower right\n\nPostscript\n\nA man wrongly listed under Jesus in the Oxford University Roll of Service\n\nA man called M. ANDREW is recorded under Jesus College in the Oxford University Roll of Service as having been killed in action on 4 November 1918, but is not listed on the college's memorial board.\n\nIt appears that OURS has confused Melville Andrew, who attended Jesus College and appears to have survived the war, with Malcolm Andrew, who did not attend Jesus College, but was killed on the day given for the death of M. Andrew.\n\nBrief details on each of the men are given below:\n\nMelville ANDREW (Jesus College, survived the war)\n\nBorn in Sheffield in 1887, the son of Robert Andrew and Lucy Shaw. His father was a grocer, but was described as “retired from business” on his son's matriculation form. He was educated at King Edward VII School, Sheffield and was matriculated at the University of Oxford from Jesus College on 17 October 1906, obtaining his B.A. on 2 August 1910. He grew up in Sheffield with his four siblings, and became an assistant master at Saffron Walden Grammar School. Fought in the war, but survived, and died in 1947\n\nMalcolm ANDREW (not a member of Jesus College, killed in the war)\n\nMarried Gladys I. A. Elleray in the Romford district near the beginning of 1918\n\nEnlisted 1914. Served in France\n\nLieutenant, 20th Battalion, attached 104th Trench Mortar Battery, Lancashire Fusiliers,\n\nKilled in action on 4 November 1918\n\nBuried in France at Romeries Communal Cemetery Extension, Solemes (grave ref. VI.D.1)\n\nCWGC entry\n\nHis widow's address in the mid-1920s: South Farm, Langton Green, Tunbridge Wells\n\nAn undergraduate at Jesus College who committed suicide after his war service\n\nJohn Ainscow DUGDALE, an undergraduate at Jesus College, shot himself near Binsey Church in 1919. His inquest was fully reported in the Oxford Times of 31 October 1919 (p. 7). Dugdale had fought in Mesopotamia, and it was said that his health had been undermined by war service. A verdict of “Suicide in a fit of temporary insanity” was given.\n\nA young member of staff of Jesus College who died in Egypt\n\nBertie Cecil RAWLINS (also known as RAWLINS-INNS) was the son of a Jericho bricklayer. The 1911 census shows that at the age of 14 he was already away from home and working as a page in the Principal's Lodgings at Jesus College, where he lived with the Principal John Rhŷs and his family together with three other members of the domestic staff (a cook, parlourmaid, and housemaid). He died of sickness in Egypt at the age of 20 on 23 August 1916: more information about him here."
