        "text": "This article about records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom and of England includes a variety of lists of MPs by age, period and other circumstances of service, familiar sets, ethnic or religious minorities, physical attributes, and circumstances of their deaths.\n\nSee also: Baby of the House\n\nPrior to the Acts of Union, the youngest known person to have sat in the House of Commons of England was Christopher Monck, elected MP for Devon in 1667, \"probably without a contest\", at the age of 13. He sat in the House for three years, before being elevated to the House of Lords upon his father's death. He is said to have been \"moderately active during his short period of membership, sitting on seven committees\".[1]\n\nMonck was one of many members returned underage in the late seventeenth century, with around ten underage members in each of the Parliaments of 1690 and 1695, many aristocrats. In response to this, the Parliamentary Elections Act 1695 established 21 as the minimum age, although this was not reliably enforced.[2] Until the Reform Act 1832, underage MPs were seldom unseated. For example, Charles James Fox became an MP aged 19 in 1768,[3] and Robert Jocelyn, Viscount Jocelyn, became an MP aged 18 in 1806.[4][5]\n\nBefore the general election of 2015, the youngest MP since the Reform Act of 1832[6] was William Charles Wentworth-FitzWilliam, elected at Malton in the 1832 general election aged 20 and 11 months. His election, whilst theoretically illegal, was unchallenged; Malton was a pocket borough controlled by his family, and the matter was viewed as academic as he would be of full age by the time Parliament assembled.[7]\n\nAfter Wentworth-FitzWilliam, the youngest MP elected was James Dickson, who was elected as a Liberal at a by-election for the Borough of Dungannon on 25 June 1880. He was born on 19 April 1859, and so was aged 21 years 67 days. The youngest female MP was Bernadette Devlin, elected on 17 April 1969 from Mid Ulster, aged 21 years 359 days. Until 1970, the minimum age to sit in parliament was 21.[dubious – discuss] In 1970, the minimum age was lowered to 18.[dubious – discuss] Both records are now jointly held by Mhairi Black, who was aged 20 years and 237 days old at the time of her election to the seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire South in the 2015 general election.\n\nThe oldest serving MP whose exact dates are known was Samuel Young (1822–1918), who was MP for East Cavan from 1892 (when aged 70), until his death at the age of 96 years 63 days.[8]\n\nPerhaps the oldest parliamentary debut of all time was that of Warren Lisle, believed born in 1695, who was elected on 7 September 1780 during that year's general election as MP for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis as locum tenens, aged reportedly 85. He stood down on 21 November to allow his kinsman, Gabriel Steward, to stand for the seat after completing his own term as mayor of the borough (when he had been the local returning officer). He died in July 1788 aged reportedly 93.[9]\n\nThe oldest debut where a confirmed birth date is known was made by Sir Robert Pullar (born 18 February 1828) who was elected at an unopposed by-election for Perth on 12 February 1907 aged 78 years and 359 days. He retired at the January 1910 general election.\n\nThe oldest debut at a general election to the UK Parliament was possibly by Bernard Kelly (born 1808) who was elected MP for South Donegal in 1885 in the year of his 77th birthday. He died in office on 1 January 1887 aged 78.\n\nThe oldest woman at first entry to the Commons was Dr Ethel Bentham (born 5 January 1861) who was elected MP for Islington East at the 1929 general election aged 68 years and 145 days. She died in office, the first woman to do so, in 1931.\n\nJim Allister was the oldest MP first elected at the last general election, the 2024 general election, at age 71.\n\nDavid Hacking was the oldest hereditary peer elected to the House of Lords in a by-election, aged 83 in 2021. He had previously been in the House for 28 years before leaving in 1999.\n\nName Born Became oldest MP Left House Age on leaving Died Political party Highest office held Murdoch Macdonald 6 May 1866 1945 1950 83 2 24 April 1957 Liberal David Logan 22 November 1871 1950 Feb 1964 92 1 25 February 1964 Labour Winston Churchill F 30 November 1874 Feb 1964 Sep 1964 89 2 24 January 1965 Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Emanuel Shinwell 18 October 1884 Sep 1964 1970 85 2 8 May 1986 Labour Minister of Defence S.

His daughter Charlotte Atkins also served as an MP from 1997 to 2010. On 30 August 2018, he surpassed the previous record set by Theodore Cooke Taylor (3 August 1850 – 19 October 1952), member for Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth from 1900 to 1918, who had lived to be 102 years and 77 days old. Atkins died aged 104 years and 200 days old.\n\nOther ex-MPs who have reached their centenary are Nathaniel Micklem (1853–1954), Sir Harry Brittain (1873–1974), Sir George Ernest Schuster (1881–1982), Manny Shinwell (1884–1986), Edgar Granville (1898–1998), Jack Oldfield (1899–1999, who outlived his parliamentary service by 68 years), Hartley Shawcross (1902–2003), Bert Hazell (1907–2009), Michael Shaw (1920–2021) and Sir Patrick Duffy (born 1920, and the only centenarian former MP currently living).\n\nFrank James, who was elected MP for Walsall at the 1892 general election, but unseated on petition in November that year, died at 102 years and 135 days old; James's record was surpassed by Atkins on 27 October 2018.[13]\n\nAs of 2024 , Sir Patrick Duffy is the oldest living former MP (born 17 June 1920, age 104 years, 55 days).[14]\n\nJill Knight (9 July 1923 – 6 April 2022) was the longest-lived female former MP, aged 98 years, 271 days.\n\nAs of 2024 Elizabeth Shields is the oldest living female former MP (born 27 February 1928, age 96 years, 166 days).\n\nStratton Mills (born 1 July 1932, age 92 years, 41 days), who was elected MP for Belfast North at the 1959 general election, is the earliest elected former MP still living.[15] Mills was sworn in on 22 October.[16]\n\nOne known contender for this record for whom both birth and death dates are known, in the Parliament of England, was James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley, who while still a minor was MP for Callington in 1621–1622, and for Winchester from early in 1624 until his death from illness on military service in the Netherlands on 1 November 1624 aged 19 years and 251 days.\n\nBased only on evidence from his university entrance records,[17] Peter Legh, MP for Newton from 1640, may have been aged 19 or younger when he died after a duel on 2 February 1642, but his precise birthdate is not known.\n\nGeoffrey Palmer, MP for Ludgershall from March 1660, died in office on 31 October 1661 aged 19 years and at least 245 days, based on his baptism registration (28 February 1642).[18]\n\nAfter the setting of the youngest age of candidacy at 21, the youngest MP to die in office was George Charles Grey who was elected MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1941 and was killed in action on 30 July 1944 aged 25 years 240 days. Throughout this period he was the Baby of the House.\n\nThe shortest-lived female MP, Lady Cynthia Mosley, MP for Stoke 1929–1931, died in 1933 aged 34. The youngest female MP to die in office was Jo Cox, MP for Batley and Spen since 2015, who was murdered on 16 June 2016, 6 days before her 42nd birthday.\n\nSee also: Father of the House\n\nSir Francis Knollys (also the oldest ever sitting MP) was first elected as MP for Oxford in 1575 at the age of around 25 and was MP for Reading at the time of his death in 1648, a period spanning 73 years,[8] although there were eight periods, amounting to 27 entire years (1590–1592, 1594–1596, 1599–1600, 1602–1603, 1605–1613, 1615–1619, 1627 and 1630–1639) in which the Parliament of England did not meet, and his period of service totalled little more than 23 years.[19]\n\nThe longest span of service of an MP since the start of the 20th century was Winston Churchill who was first elected on 1 October 1900 and left the House of Commons on 25 September 1964, a period of 63 years 360 days. His service was not continuous, as he was not an MP for a spell in 1908 and between 1922 and 1924.\n\nCharles Pelham Villiers was the longest continuously serving MP. He was elected in 1835 and remained an MP continuously for over 62 years until his death on 16 January 1898, aged 96 years 13 days. Since the start of the 20th century, the longest continuous service by an MP has been 51 years 80 days by Edward Heath, who sat from 1950 to 2001.\n\nThe longest continuous service record for a female MP is held by Harriet Harman, first elected in October 1982. The longest total service record for a female MP is held by Dame Margaret Beckett, who served for 4 years and 7 months between 1974 and 1979 and was then re-elected in June 1983. Beckett also holds the record for the longest span of service for a woman. Both Harman and Beckett left the House of Commons on 30 May 2024.\n\nThere are cases of MPs being elected posthumously; Edward Legge (1710–1747) was elected unopposed as MP for Portsmouth on 15 December 1747, four days before news arrived that he had died 87 days previously in the West Indies. In 1780 John Kirkman was elected as MP for the City of London despite dying before polls closed.[8]\n\nIn more recent times, members have died after polling, but before the declaration of the results. In 1906, Thomas Higgins was declared elected for the seat of North Galway, even though he had died earlier that morning, after polling day. More recently, in 1945 Sir Edward Taswell Campbell at Bromley and Leslie Pym at Monmouth died after polling, but nine days before the declaration of the results. Both were declared elected posthumously, and both had been MPs for a number of years. Noel Skelton is another example in 1935.\n\nThe shortest non-posthumous service was that of Alfred Dobbs, who was declared elected MP for Smethwick on 26 July 1945 and was killed the following day in a car accident on the way to take his seat.[20]\n\nThe shortest service for women MPs has been 92 days in the case of both Ruth Dalton, who was MP for Bishop Auckland from a by-election on 7 February 1929 to dissolution of Parliament on 10 May 1929 prior to that year's general election, and Margo MacDonald, who was MP for Glasgow Govan from a by-election on 8 November 1973 until the dissolution of Parliament on 8 February 1974 prior to the coming general election.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of MPs since 1900 with less than 365 days total service see\n\nList of United Kingdom MPs with the shortest service\n\nPat Cullen[a] 2024–\n\nDáire Hughes[a] 2024–\n\nCathal Mallaghan[a] 2024–\n\nJohn Finucane[a] 2019–\n\nÓrfhlaith Begley[a] 2018–\n\nChris Hazzard[a] 2017–\n\nElisha McCallion[a] 2017–2019\n\nBarry McElduff[a] 2017–2018\n\nMickey Brady[a] 2015–24\n\nFrancie Molloy[a] 2013–24\n\nPaul Maskey[a] 2011–\n\nMichelle Gildernew[a] 2001–2015, 2017–24\n\nPat Doherty[a] 2001–2017\n\nConor Murphy[a] 2005–2015\n\nMartin McGuinness[a] 1997–2013\n\nGerry Adams[a] 1983–1992, 1997–2011\n\nOwen Carron[a] 1981–1983\n\nBobby Sands[b][c] 1981\n\nPhilip Clarke[a][b][d] 1955\n\nTom Mitchell[a][b][d] 1955\n\nAlfred Dobbs[c] 1945\n\nJoseph Bell[c] 1922\n\nHarry Wrightson[c] 1918–1919\n\n69 Sinn Féin Members elected at the 1918 general election (including 6 first elected in by-elections 1917–1918)[a]\n\nJames Annand[c] 1906\n\nThomas Higgins[e] 1906\n\nHenry Compton[f] 1905–1906 (shortest serving MP – 46 days – whose tenure was not ended by his death)\n\nJoseph Andrews[f] 1905–1906\n\nNotes:\n\nOn rare occasions the election winner may be disqualified, either by an election court or by the House of Commons, and the seat awarded to the runner-up.\n\nMalcolm St. Clair: Bristol South-East, 1961–1963\n\nCharles Beattie: Mid-Ulster, 1955–1956\n\nCharles Stewart Parnell: elected in 1880 General election for three separate seats – Cork City, Mayo and Meath.\n\nRichard Hazleton: from 9 December 1910 until 23 February 1911, when he was unseated on a petition from the second seat, he was MP for North Galway and North Louth.\n\nAt the 1918 election, 4 Sinn Féin candidates were each elected to two seats: Arthur Griffith (Cavan East and Tyrone North West), Éamon de Valera (Clare East and Mayo East), Liam Mellows (Galway East and Meath North) and Eoin MacNeill (Londonderry City and National University of Ireland). However, none of them took their seat in the House of Commons, instead attending the First Dáil.\n\nIn modern times, it is unusual for an MP to represent more than one or two constituencies during their career, although before the 20th century it was quite common. MPs whose seats were altered purely by boundary changes are not listed.\n\nMichael Ancram: Berwick and East Lothian 1; Edinburgh South 1; Devizes 5\n\nRalph Assheton: Rushcliffe 1; City of London 2; Blackburn West 5\n\nWalter Ayles: Bristol North1; Southall 4; Hayes and Harlington 3\n\nKenneth Baker: Acton 1; St. Marylebone 2; Mole Valley 5\n\nArthur Balfour: Hertford 4; Manchester East 1; City of London 1\n\nJoseph Braithwaite: Hillsborough 1; Holderness 2; Bristol North West 1\n\nJames, Lord Brudenell: Marlborough; Fowey 2; North Northamptonshire 5\n\nJohn Calcraft (the younger): Wareham 4; Rochester 4; Dorset 10\n\nWinston Churchill: Oldham 4; Manchester North West 1; Dundee 1; Epping 2 Woodford 2\n\nWilliam Clark: Nottingham South 1; East Surrey 4; Croydon South 5\n\nRoger Conant: Chesterfield 1; Bewdley 2; Rutland and Stamford 5\n\nMims Davies: Eastleigh 4; Mid Sussex 4; East Grinstead and Uckfield\n\nGeoffrey de Freitas: Nottingham Central 4; Lincoln 3; Kettering 5\n\nBenjamin Disraeli: Maidstone 4; Shrewsbury 4; Buckinghamshire 6\n\nWalter Elliot: Lanark1; Kelvingrove1; Combined Scottish Universities 2; Kelvingrove 10\n\nGeorge Galloway: Glasgow Hillhead/Kelvin 4; Bethnal Green and Bow 4; Bradford West 1; Rochdale 1\n\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone: Newark 1; Oxford University 1; South Lancashire 2; Greenwich 4; Midlothian 5\n\nThomas Graves: Okehampton 4; Windsor 4; Milborne Port 5\n\nArthur Griffith-Boscawen: Tunbridge 1; Dudley 1; Taunton 1\n\nRay Gunter: South-East Essex 2; Doncaster 1; Southwark 3\n\nEdward Hemmerde: East Denbighshire 4; North West Norfolk 2; Crewe 1\n\nArthur Henderson: Barnard Castle 4; Widnes 1; Newcastle East 1; Burnley 1; Clay Cross 10\n\nAustin Hudson: Islington East 1; Hackney North 1; Lewisham North 10\n\nRoy Jenkins: Southwark Central 2; Birmingham Stechford 3; Glasgow Hillhead 1\n\nHarcourt Johnstone Willesden West 1; South Shields 1; Middlesbrough West 10\n\nWilliam Jowitt: Hartlepool 1; Preston 4; Ashton-under-Lyne 6\n\nRichard Kidston Law: Kingston upon Hull South West 1; Kensington South 2; Haltemprice 6\n\nGeoffrey Lloyd: Birmingham Ladywood 1; Birmingham King's Norton 2; Sutton Coldfield 5\n\nWalter Long: Wiltshire North 2; Devizes 1; Liverpool West Derby 4; Bristol South 4; South Dublin 4; Strand 2; Westminster St George's 6\n\nSir Manasseh Masseh Lopes: New Romney 3; Evesham 9; Barnstaple 9, Westbury 3\n\nLeonard Lyle: Stratford 1; Epping 5; Bournemouth 6\n\nCharles MacAndrew: Kilmarnock 1; Glasgow Partick 4; Bute and North Ayrshire 5\n\nRamsay MacDonald: Leicester 2; Aberavon 4; Seaham 1; Combined Scottish Universities 10\n\nJames Patrick Mahon: Clare 8; Ennis 1; County Carlow 10\n\nLord John Manners: Newark 1; Colchester 4; North Leicestershire 4; Melton 6\n\nFrank Markham: Chatham 5; Nottingham South 1; Buckingham 5\n\nFergus Montgomery: Newcastle East 1; Brierley Hill 2; Altrincham and Sale 2\n\nHyacinth Morgan: Camberwell North West 5; Rochdale 4; Warrington 5\n\nJohn Fletcher Moulton: Clapham 1 South Hackney 1, Launceston 5\n\nWilfred Paling: Doncaster 1; Wentworth 2; Dearne Valley 5\n\nArthur Palmer: Wimbledon 1; Cleveland 1; Bristol Central 2; Bristol North East 2\n\nSir Robert Peel: Cashel 4; Chippenham 4; Oxford University 4; Westbury 4; Tamworth 10\n\nCharles Simmons: Birmingham Erdington1; Birmingham West 2; Brierley Hill 1\n\nFrank Soskice: Birkenhead East 2; Sheffield Neepsend 2; Newport 5\n\nJohn Strachey: Aston 1; Dundee 2, Dundee West 10\n\nEarl Gower: St Mawes 4; Newcastle-Under-Lyme 4; Staffordshire 5\n\nShirley Williams: Hitchin 2; Hertford and Stevenage 1; Crosby 1\n\nJohn Wilmot: Fulham East 1; Kennington 4; Deptford 5\n\nSir Joseph Yorke: Reigate 7; Saint Germans 3; Sandwich 4 Reigate 10\n\nNotes:\n\n1 subsequently defeated\n\n2 seat abolished\n\n3 resigned\n\n4 sought another constituency\n\n5 retired\n\n6 inherited/raised to peerage\n\n7 resigned but returned to constituency at later date\n\n8 unseated on petition; elected at a later date, then retired\n\n9 unseated for bribery\n\n10 died\n\nIn modern times, it is unusual for an MP who has been defeated (or retired e.g. due to their seat being abolished) to achieve more than one comeback to the House of Commons after a period of absence. In the UK Parliament, William Vesey-FitzGerald, Lord Charles Beresford and Arthur Henderson were exceptional in achieving it on no fewer than four occasions each: Vesey-FitzGerald over a span of 18 years through three by-elections and one general election, Beresford over a span of 25 years after voluntarily resigning or retiring from the House at stages of his naval career, Henderson invariably at by-elections following serial general election defeats in other seats, in the shorter span of 14 years. A woman has never come back more than once.\n\nOf living MPs, George Galloway transferred to a different constituency and party in 2005 but did not have any period of absence from the Commons at that time. Having left Parliament in 2010 he made a comeback at a by-election in a third constituency in 2012, was defeated in 2015, then returned at a by-election for a fourth constituency in February 2024 before losing it in the general election the same year.\n\nGeorge Galloway: 2012 b, 2024 b\n\nWilliam McCrea: 2000 b, 2005\n\nMichael Ancram: 1979, 1992\n\nFergus Montgomery: 1967 b, October 1974\n\nTony Benn: 1963 b, 1984 b\n\nArthur Palmer: 1952 b, 1964\n\nAlec Douglas-Home: 1950, 1963 b\n\nFrank Soskice: 1950 b, 1956 b\n\nRichard Law: 1945 b, 1951\n\nHyacinth Morgan: 1940b, 1950b\n\nFrank Markham: 1935, 1951\n\nSir Herbert Williams: 1932 b, 1950\n\nCahir Healy: 1931 b, 1950\n\nHarold Macmillan: 1931, 1945 b\n\nIan Fraser: 1931, 1940 b\n\nHarcourt Johnstone: 1931, 1940 b\n\nCuthbert Headlam: 1931, 1940 b\n\nGwilym Lloyd George: 1929, 1951\n\nWalter Ayles: 1929, 1945\n\nSomerville Hastings: 1929, 1945\n\nGeorge Isaacs: 1929, 1939 b\n\nWilliam Jowitt: 1929, 1939 b\n\nJames Chuter Ede: 1929, 1935\n\nHerbert Morrison: 1929, 1935\n\nRobert Richards: 1929, 1935\n\nArthur Henderson Jr.: 1929, 1935\n\nBenjamin Walter Gardner: 1929, 1934 b\n\nTom Smith: 1929, 1933 b\n\nWilliam Wedgwood Benn: 1928 b, 1937 b\n\nManny Shinwell: 1928 b, 1935\n\nAustin Hudson: 1924, 1950\n\nWalter Elliot: 1924, 1946 b\n\nEdward Cadogan: 1924, 1940 b\n\nLord Erskine: 1924, 1940 b\n\nTom Johnston: 1924 b, 1935\n\nAndrew MacLaren: 1924, 1935\n\nAlec Cunningham-Reid: 1924, 1932b\n\nArchibald Boyd-Carpenter: 1924, 1931\n\nSir Geoffrey Ellis: 1924, 1931\n\nArthur Evans, 1924, 1931\n\nPark Goff, 1924, 1931\n\nVivian Henderson: 1924, 1931\n\nGeorge Hume: 1924, 1931\n\nFrank Sanderson: 1924, 1931\n\nWilfred Sugden: 1924, 1931\n\nCharles Lyle: 1923, 1940 b\n\nTom Kennedy: 1923, 1935\n\nThomas Ellis Naylor: 1923, 1935\n\nFrancis Dyke Acland: 1923, 1932 b\n\nWalter Rea: 1923, 1931\n\nJohn Edmund Mills: 1923, 1929\n\nWalter Robert Smith: 1923, 1929\n\nHenry Guest: 1922, 1937 b\n\nRamsay MacDonald: 1922, 1936 b\n\nCharles Roden Buxton: 1922, 1929\n\nFred Jowett: 1922, 1929\n\nHastings Lees-Smith: 1922, 1924, 1935\n\nJohn Edward Sutton: 1922 b, 1923\n\nArthur Henderson, Sr.: 1919 b, 1923 b, 1924 b, 1933 b\n\nEdward Hemmerde: 1912 b, 1922\n\nGeoffrey Howard: 1911 b, 1923\n\nCharles Masterman: 1911 b, 1923\n\nSir James Millar: 1911 b, 1922, 1929\n\nSir Donald Maclean: December 1910, 1929\n\nEdward Anthony Strauss: December 1910, 1927 b, 1931\n\nSir Hamar Greenwood: December 1910, 1924\n\nFrederick Guest: December 1910, 1923, 1931\n\nLeif Jones: December 1910, 1923, 1929\n\nWilliam Mitchell-Thomson: December 1910, 1923\n\nArthur Griffith-Boscawen: December 1910, 1921 b\n\nJ.

Commons:\n\nEdward Mainwaring, 35 years and 269 days from serving as MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme in the parliament that closed on 12 August 1625, to returning for the same seat at start of the Cavalier Parliament on 8 May 1661,[22]\n\nSir William Killigrew who was out of the Commons 35 years and 30 days from the close of the 1628 parliament on 10 March 1629 when he served as MP for Penryn, Cornwall, until returning as MP for Richmond, Yorkshire on 9 April 1664[23]\n\nNote that intervals of more than a decade between service in the Commons were more commonplace in the 17th than in later centuries due to factors such as:\n\n-years when no parliaments were held, such as Charles I's rule without parliament covering 1630–39,\n\n-Royalist MPs expelled during the English Civil Wars sitting again after the restoration of Charles II (1660),\n\n-the Cavalier Parliament of 1661–79 which met without general elections in meantime.\n\n-former Civil War and Commonwealth era Roundhead MPs returning to the Commons in the 1670s and 1680s under the Whig Party.\n\nSince the establishment of regular parliamentary government at the end of the 17th century and the creation of the United Kingdom Parliament in 1801, possibly the longest gap between sitting was faced by Henry Drummond (1786–1860), of nearly 35 years between the dissolution of his first parliament on 29 September 1812 and returning to his next at the general election held in July–August 1847.\n\nOthers:\n\nJohn Angerstein, 33 years (1802–1835)\n\nSir George Sondes, 32 years (1629–1661)\n\nRichard Spencer, 32 years

(Both sat for same two-member seat, Amersham.)\n\nJohn Beresford, MP 1801–05, and son John Claudius Beresford, MP 1801–11.\n\nSir Mark Wood, 1st Baronet, MP 1801–18, and son Mark Wood, jnr., MP 1816–18. (They sat together for same two-member seat, Gatton.)\n\nSix brother sets:\n\nFrancis Seymour-Conway, Viscount Beauchamp (later 2nd Marquess of Hertford) served 1766–1794; Lord George Seymour-Conway 1784–1790 and 1796–1801; Henry-Seymour-Conway (later Lord Henry Seymour) 1766–1784; Lord Robert Seymour 1771–1790 and 1794–1820; Lord William Seymour 1783–1784 and 1785–1796; and Lord Hugh Seymour 1784–1786 and 1788 to his death in 1801. All began serving in the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 126 years.\n\nHenry Paget, Lord Paget (later 1st Marquess of Anglesey) served 1790–1804 and 1806–1810; Arthur Paget 1794–1807; Berkeley Paget 1807–1826; Sir Charles Paget 1804–1826 and 1831–1833 and 1833–1834; Sir Edward Paget, 1796–1806 and 1810–1820; and William Paget 1790 to his death in 1794. Four of the brothers began serving under the pre-1801 Parliament of Great Britain and their service in the Commons totalled 79 years.\n\nProbably the longest (though not continuous) all time span of service by brothers in the Commons, in the Parliament of England, was 85 years from 1562, when Sir Henry Knollys was elected MP for Reading, until the death in 1648 of his brother Sir Francis Knollys (above, aged reputedly 97) also representing Reading, although there were intervals of years when parliament did not meet. They were part of another set of six brothers who all sat at various times.\n\nSince regular parliamentary government was established by the start of the UK Parliament, contenders for longest span of continuous service include the four brothers Sir Robert Peel (also twice prime minister), William Yates Peel, Jonathan Peel and Edmund Peel, with a span of 59 years from Robert's by-election return on 15 April 1809 as MP for Cashel, to the retirement of Jonathan at the 1868 general election as MP for Huntingdon. Their collective service totalled 115 years and all four were simultaneously in Parliament when Edmund was sitting in 1831–1832 and 1835–1837 for Newcastle-under-Lyme. Another 59-year service span was enjoyed by two brothers, William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale (when Viscount Lowther before entering the House of Lords in 1841) and Henry Cecil Lowther, from the former's election as MP for Cockermouth in 1808 until the death of the latter as MP for Westmorland (which he had represented since 1812) and Father of the House on 4 December 1867.\n\nThomas Hyde Villiers and his brother Charles Pelham Villiers (above) had a span of nearly 72 years service from the former's first election as MP in 1826 to the latter's death as a serving MP and Father of the House in 1898, but this was broken by an interval when the former was out of parliament in 1831, and the gap between Thomas' death on 3 December 1832 and Charles' first election in 1835. Their consecutive service thus totalled 69 years.\n\nWhere seats were in the patronage of territorial magnates, it was commonplace into the 19th century for brothers in (usually landowning) families to hold seats successively or (before the advent of single member seats) even concurrently, before the system of choosing candidates by local party associations became organised on a competitive selection basis. Two brothers successively represented North Derbyshire for a total span of nearly 48 years. Lord Cavendish of Keighley was MP from the 1832 general election until succeeding his father and going to the House of Lords as Earl of Burlington in 1834. He was succeeded by Lord George Henry Cavendish from 1834 until the latter's death on 23 September 1880.\n\nThe last set of brothers to represent the same constituency were Frederick and Henry Guest, who did so in connection with two successive constituencies:\n\nEast Dorset. Frederick was first elected at the January 1910 general election but was unable to take his seat due to irregularity by an election agent, causing a by-election in June 1910 when he stepped aside in favour of Henry, who held the seat until the December 1910 general election when Henry in turn stepped aside in favour of Frederick who was elected, to hold the seat until the 1922 general election.\n\nPlymouth Drake, of which Frederick was MP from 1931 to his death in 1937 when Henry succeeded him at the by-election and held the seat until the 1945 general election.\n\nSets with one brother still serving following the election:\n\nDavid Miliband, MP for South Shields 2001–2013, and Ed Miliband, MP for Doncaster North from 2005.\n\nGwilym Lloyd George (later 1st Viscount Tenby), MP for Pembrokeshire 1922–1924 and 1929–1950 and Newcastle upon Tyne North 1951–1957, and sister Lady Megan Lloyd George, MP for Anglesey 1929–1951 and Carmarthen 1957–1966.\n\nVictor Cazalet, MP for Chippenham 1924–1943 and his sister Thelma Cazalet-Keir, MP for Islington East 1931–1945.\n\nSet with one sibling still serving – Keith Vaz, MP for Leicester East 1987–2019, and sister Valerie Vaz, MP for Walsall South 2010–2024 and Walsall and Bloxwich since 2024.\n\nJames Grenville and Richard Grenville sat together as MPs for Buckingham from 1774 to 1780.\n\nEdward John Stanley, MP for North Cheshire, sat alongside his brother William Owen Stanley, MP for Anglesey, from 1837 to 1841.\n\nAngela Eagle and Maria Eagle, mentioned above, are the only twin sisters to have sat in the Commons together, last elected in 2019.\n\nWhen the UK Parliament was established in 1801, non-Anglicans were prevented from taking their seats as MPs under the Test Act 1672. However, Methodists took communion at Anglican churches until 1795, and some continued to do so, and many Presbyterians were prepared to accept Anglican communion, thus ensuring that members of these creeds were represented in the Parliament.[29] Some Unitarians were also elected.\n\nThe first Roman Catholic general election victors in the UK Parliament were at the 1830 general election. They included Daniel O'Connell and James Patrick Mahon in Clare.\n\nThe first Quaker general election victor was Joseph Pease at the 1832 general election.\n\nThe first Moravian general election victor was Charles Hindley at the 1835 general election.\n\nThe first Jewish general election victor was Lionel de Rothschild at the 1847 general election. He was not permitted to take his seat until 1858.\n\nThe first Catholic Apostolic general election victor was Henry Drummond also at the 1847 election.\n\nThe first Baptist general election victor was George Goodman at the 1852 general election.\n\nThe first Congregationalist general election victor was Samuel Morley at the 1865 general election.\n\nThe first declared atheist general election victor was Charles Bradlaugh at the 1880 general election. He was not permitted to take the oath until January 1886, although he sat briefly in 1880–81 when permitted to affirm allegiance; a legal action later held that affirmation had no effect.\n\nThe first Parsi general election victor was Dadabhai Naoroji at the 1892 general election.\n\nThe first Sikh general election victor was Piara Khabra at the 1992 general election.\n\nThe first Latter-day Saint general election victor was Terry Rooney at the 1992 general election, after being initially elected for his seat at a by-election in 1990.\n\nThe first Muslim general election victor was Mohammad Sarwar at the 1997 general election.\n\nThe first Hindu general election victor was Shailesh Vara at the 2005 general election.\n\nThe first Buddhist general election victor was Suella Braverman, then known as Suella Fernandes, at the 2015 general election.\n\nThe heaviest MP of all time is believed to be Sir Cyril Smith, MP for Rochdale between 1972 and 1992, who weighed 189.6 kg (nearly 30 stone) at his peak in 1976.\n\nThe tallest MP of all time is believed to be Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham between 2005 and 2024, at 6 feet 8+1⁄2 inches (2.045 m) in 2007,[30] later stated to be 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) in 2014.[31] Before Kawczynski's election the record was held by Louis Gluckstein, MP for Nottingham East between 1931 and 1945, who measured 2.02 metres (6 feet 8 inches).\n\nAmong pre-20th-century MPs, Sir John Cheyne (c. 1442–1499), known among contemporaries as the \"Vigorous Knight\" and MP for Wiltshire between 1471 and 1481, has been estimated to have been 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) tall, based on analysis of his femur (measuring 21 inches / 53 cm) found in his tomb.[32]\n\nThe tallest female MP of all time is believed to be Antoinette Sandbach at 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) in 2011, when she was a Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament (formerly National Assembly for Wales) member,[33] later stated to be 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) in 2019.[34] She served in the House of Commons as MP for Eddisbury in 2015–2019.\n\nNot counting MPs who served as minors, adult contenders for this record in modern times include Sarah Teather, MP for Brent East 2003–2010 and Brent Central 2010–2015, who in 2014 was held to be the shortest MP then sitting, at 4 feet 10 inches (1.47 m)[31] and is now regarded as the shortest woman member in British parliamentary history.[35][36]\n\nThe following were all known to be disabled when serving as MPs:\n\nSir Francis Bryan, MP for Buckinghamshire in 1529, 1539, 1542 and 1545, who lost an eye in a tournament in
