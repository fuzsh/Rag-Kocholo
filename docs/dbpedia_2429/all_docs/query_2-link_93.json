Her Majesty18547232 The Vintners' Company7921100 The Dyers' Company9114105 [ Totals: ]35582437\n\nProbably they have not since increased; but the numbers were formerly much greater; at one period the Vintners' Company alone possessed five hundred birds. *\n\n* The marks are termed \"nicks\": the Vintners' mark is two nicks; hence the well-known tavern sign: \"The Swan with two necks\"\n\nIn the language of swan-herds, the male swan is called a Cob, the female a Pen; the black tubercle at the base of the beak is called the berry.\n\nInstances are given by Yarrell of singular instinct in cases of floods, when the birds have beforehand raised their nests two feet and a half above the level of the stream, to protect the eggs from inundations. Mr. Jesse, in his \"Gleanings of Natural History\", observes that\n\n\"each family of swans on the river has its own district, and if the limits of that district are encroached upon by other swans, a pursuit immediately takes place, and the intruders are driven away.\"\n\nYarrell says,\n\n\"their food consists of the softer part of water-plants, roots, aquatic insects, and occasionally small fish: a swan has been seen to eat a small roach; they also eat grain and bread.\"\n\nETON COLLEGE WTSWG\n\nHaving passed the [Boveney] lock, we are at once in the midst of \"a bustle\". We are ignorant that \"the rule of the road\" is not the law of the water, and run much risk, in our comparatively unwieldy barge, of upsetting one or more of the tiny cockleshells in which a youth is seated, rowing up the stream; we cross rapidly over and give free passage  not without an audible reproach for our want of skill in Eton boat lore  to those\n\nWho foremost now delight to cleave\n\nWith pliant arms thy glassy wave.\n\nThe youths are on the banks, as well as on the water of old Father Thames:\n\nA sprightly race,\n\nDisporting on thy margent green,\n\nThe paths of pleasure trace.\n\nOut of this \"careless childhood\" or heedless youth, must issue much of the after-renown of England  upon them mainly rest the hereafter of her fate. The embryo statesman is here; the philosopher in the bud; the hero in the cruca; the germ of that greatness, the high destiny of which is to preserve the honour and extend the glory of a kingdom upon which the sun never sets; and as boy after boy passes  the father of the man  one can scarcely fail to murmur a hope, with a faith, in his career \n\nHail to Ihee who shall be great hereafter!\n\nIn the lives of a very large portion of the foremost men of our country, it is an incident that they were \"educated at Eton\"; and to have been an \"Eton boy\" is the proud boast of many who have gathered laurels in peace and in war.\n\nEton is in Buckinghamshire, Windsor is in Berkshire. The river divides the counties  a very pretty bridge joining the towns. The College at Eton owes its birth to Henry VI.,  there\n\nGrateful Science still adore; Her Henry's holy shade, \n\nETON COLLEGE\n\nthe charter of incorporation bearing the date 1441. The buildings consist of two quadrangles, in one of which are the chapel and school, with the dormitory of the foundation-scholars; in the other are the library, provost's house, and lodgings of the fellows. The chapel is a handsome Gothic edifice, and is that which \"tells\" so well in all pictures of the place. A statue in bronze of the royal founder occupies the centre of one of the quadrangles. Few buildings are more happily situated;  \"the meadows\" adjoin it, the Thames rolls its refreshing waters immediately in front, while always in view are the towers of \"regal Windsor\", inciting to that loyalty which is ever the associate of virtue in the young.\n\nThe college, as originally founded by Henry VI., was, in accordance with the feelings of his age, charitable as well as scholastic; *\n\n* \"On the 30th of July, 1440, the king, preparatory to the settlement of the College, and probably at the suggestion of Bekynton, Bishop of Bath and Chancellor of Eton, visited Winchester, and examined the plan of Wykeham's foundation there.\"  Tighe and Davis's History of Windsor.\n\nThese authors say that it was \"not only a place of gratuitous instruction and maintenance for indigent scholars, but also a place of education for the children of wealthier families.\n\nhaving also a number of priests to properly perform religious services in this \"College Roiall of our Ladie of Eton\", as it was first termed.\n\nIt then consisted of a provost, ten priests, six clerks, six choristers, twenty-five poor grammar scholars, with a master to instruct them, and twenty-five almsmen, who lived upon the foundation. The king granted the lands of the dissolved monastery of Deerhurst, in Gloucestershire, to the college; but this led to disputes with the powerful prelates of the Abbey of Tewkesbury, which lasted until the reign of Henry VII., when, by way of peaceful conclusion, an exchange was made with them for other lands. Even during the progress of this suit, the lands originally granted were taken by Edward IV. to bestow on a more favoured college at Fotheringham, in Northamptonshire, founded by one of his ancestors. When Henry VI. had decided on this establishment, he incorporated two small colleges, or hostels, at Cambridge, one of which he had founded two years before; and thus King's College, Cambridge, originated, to which, as Lambarde remarks, \"Eton annually sendeth forth her ripe fruit.\"\n\nThe college was especially exempted in the act of dissolution, and its revenues were then valued at £1101 l5s. 7d. It was by the command of King George III. that the scholars are termed \"King's scholars\". They are eligible from the ages of eight to fifteen years, and are required by the statute to be \"indigentes\" (which they now never are), and skilled in reading, chanting, and grammar.\n\nThere was a curious old custom here known as the \"Montem\", which was discontinued only a few years since; *\n\n* It was discontinued in 1847, at the instigation of the Master of the College, who urged upon Her Majesty's Government various reasons for its abolition: the measure was however, strongly opposed by many old Etonians.\n\nthe boys were dressed in various fancy costumes, and \"begged\" on the first Tuesday of Whitsun-week of all passers-by. The money was termed \"salt\", and the gatherers \"salt-bearers\"; the proceeds were generally large, and were given to the senior boy to defray his expenses at Cambridge. Salt Hill, to which the scholars went in procession, is an artificial hill, or mound, about two miles from Eton. It is believed to be an ancient tumulus, probably used subsequently as a place of popular assembly. The ceremony was generally very gay, there being always among the spectators the relatives and friends of the aristocratic scholars who levied the \"salt\"; and who were little scrupulous in assailing the purses of their connexions, in their eagerness to make up the largest possible sum \"for the honour of the college\". The Royal Family more than once joined in the festivities of the day, particularly in 1793 when they all visited the college to see the procession start, and went afterwards to view the ceremonies there, and give their donations to the salt-bearers. The ceremony was triennial. The practice has been very properly discontinued: although rendered in some degree respectable by time, and certainly venerable by age, the usage was derogatory and humiliating. It is now only a matter of history, having passed away as one of the evidences of the \"wisdom of our forefathers\", which society has benefited by abrogating altogether: like many other matters of a bygone age, it was\n\nA custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\nTHE MILLS AT ETON\n\nThe mills at Eton are of great antiquity. In the \"Annals of Windsor\" we are told that in the time of the Conqueror there were two mills at Eton and a fishery. One of the mills at Eton and that at Clewer no doubt stood on the same spots where the \"Tangier\" and Clewer mills are now situated. Various causes tend to make a corn-mill one of the most permanent species of property. Wherever a mill is specified in Domesday Book, we generally find it still subsisting. Mills anciently belonged to the lords of the manor, and the tenants were permitted only to grind at the lord's mill. This circumstance sufficiently accounts, not only for the great number of mills noticed in the survey as objects of profit to the landholder, but for the large sums they are continually stated to yield. The fisheries at Eton and at Windsor also still exist on the same spots they occupied eight hundred years ago.\n\nWINDSOR BRIDGE WTSWG\n\nCollier, in his Map of Windsor, 1742, thus notes concerning Eton in his time: \n\n\"A wooden bridge over the river Thames joins Windsor to Eton, so called from its low situation among the waters; for Eton is the same as Watertown, but, as they are running waters, and it is a gravelly soil, it is observed that no place is more healthy than this.\n\nIt is well known for the college founded here by Henry VI., 1440, *\n\n* Our engraving exhibits the seal of the college used in the reign of Edward IV. It is termed upon it \"The Royal College of the Blessed Virgin Mary\", and her assumption is depicted in the centre, above the arms of the sovereign. She is represented in royal robes, surrounded by glory, crowned and supported by angels from an aureole of clouds. There is much that is curious and instructive in the study of these old seals, irrespective of their interest as historic documents to the antiquary. Thus the conventional religious picture afforded by the present example, is so very characteristic of a certain era in the art of design, that a date is not necessary to determine its age by the eye accustomed to examine such relics. The regal dress in which the Virgin is wrapped, and the peculiar arrangement of the angelic host in the sky, are all indicative of a phase in the art of the mediaeval era; an art, however wanting in elegance, yet never without a certain earnestness and love of truth.\n\nand for the great number of the sons of noblemen and gentlemen that are sent to the school here for their education.\"\n\nThe college at this time consisted of a provost, seven fellows, a master, usher, seventy scholars, and sixteen choristers.\n\nThe library is extensive, and contains some curious books; its principal contributors were the Bishop of Chichester, Sir Thomas Reeve, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Dr. Richard Mead, whose collections included those of Mr. Richard Topham, of New Windsor. *\n\n* The greatest rarity in the library is a copy of \"Ralph Roister Doister\", the earliest comedy in the English language. It was written by Nicholas Udall, before 1550, who was one of the masters of Eton school, and is noted by Tusser, the author of the \" Five Hundred Pointes of Good Husbandrie\", as his master when there, and as a very severe one to him and others.\n\nWe learn from the Builder that the Hall has been very recently restored, according to designs by Mr. Woodyer.\n\n\"The roof is new, but simple in construction. Two large Gothic windows east and west replace those inserted by Wren. That at the west end over the dais has been filled with stained glass. In the upper part of the window the central light is occupied by a figure of the founder, King Henry VI., the smaller light being filled with armorial bearings and heraldic designs, and the six lower lights are filled as follows; \n\n1. Visit of King Henry VI. to Winchester, previous to the foundation of Eton College.\n\n2. King Henry VI. purchasing the tenements which stood on the site of Eton College.\n\n3. Henry VI. granting the charter to the college.\n\n4. The appointment of the first provost.\n\n5. Henry VII. when Duke of Richmond, a scholar at Eton.\n\n6. Defence of the liberties of the college by Provost Westbury, under Edward IV.\n\nThis window is the work of Mr. Hardman. The plain stone floor has been replaced by a pavement of Minton's encaustic tiles, containing various arms and badges connected with the college and founder. Behind the wall-panelling, where their existence was wholly unsuspected, were discovered three fire-places, the carving of that on the dais being as fresh as though just from the workman's chisel. There was also a small door discovered, communicating with the lodge, and is now again used by the provost. The screen (and gallery) at the east end, replacing Sir Christopher Wren's screen, contains the shields of the benefactors of the College.\"\n\nWINDSOR CASTLE\n\nANCIENT WINDSOR CASTLE\n\nWindsor Castle, occupying a hill to which there is an ascent from all sides, is seen from every part of the adjacent country, and the several distant heights; it is always a pleasant sight, not only as regards the scenery, but with reference to its many \"happy and glorious\" associations with the past, and its suggestions of hope and joy as the favourite dwelling of the Queen, the Prince Consort, and the royal family of England. *\n\n* Until very recently there was no worthy History of Windsor  a singular deficiency in our literature. The want has, however, been at length supplied: two large volumes have been recently published, entitled,\n\n\"Annals of Windsor; being a History of the Castle and Town, with some account of Eton and places adjacent. By Robert Richard Tighe, Esq., and James Edward Davis, Esq.\"\n\nThey exhibit amazing research, and include every topic, important or trifling, desirable to illustrate the castle-palace. They contain many prints, plans, and maps, and may be considered as entirely exhausting the subject. From this work we have borrowed much, and gratefully acknowledge our debt to the accomplished and indefatigable authors.\n\nHere, in its gardens, walks, or rides, they may be seen daily, during the period of their residence, protected by the loyalty that has become affection, and the duty that is a true pleasure. The earliest engraved representation of Windsor Castle is that to be found in Braun's \"Civitatis Orbis Terrarum\", 1594, which was drawn by a foreign artist  George Hoefnagle  for that work. We copy the portion that exhibits the walled forecourt, with the Chapel of St. George in the midst. The round tower beyond, as depicted in the same view, is very much beneath its present altitude: it was raised during the renovations by George IV. The walls here seen are the oldest remains of the fortifications. The towers which are so thickly set along them are of two characters  round and angular. The former are probably the remains of the castle as enlarged by Henry III. The portion inhabited by royalty beyond this consisted, in the reign of Elizabeth, of a conglomerate of square and round towers, the work of successive ages of change, which adapted the fortress-home of the earlier kings to the more secured and refined life of the days of the \"Lion Queen\". The terrace is represented in this curious print as a simple embankment supported by wooden piles, with a row of rails to protect promenaders from a fall into the ditch below. The town at this time appears to have been a collection of small cottages, and a shepherd reposes with his sheep in the foreground of the view, while mounted courtiers pursue the deer in the park, accompanied by huntsmen who run on foot beside them. Such was the Windsor of the days of Shakspere.\n\nThe present aspect of the castle is widely different; but, during every change, there has been one striking feature preserved  the old Bell Tower, which we here engrave. It formed one of the most ancient defences; and is seen in the view engraved [above]; it is now one of the most conspicuous points of the castle when viewed from the river, or seen in its full proportion as the visitor wends his way up the main street of the town to the principal entrance. This ancient erection was originally called Clure, or Clewer Tower, and subsequently Julius Caesar's Tower. This western extremity of the castle, with its walls and towers, is the only portion of the building that has retained the original features of the edifice, as erected in the thirteenth century. Only a few years ago the walls were hidden by houses built close upon them, but they were all removed in 1851, the walls were again exposed, and the narrow, winding Thames Street widened and improved thereby. This north-western tower has long been used as a belfry and clock-house, probably from the time of Edward III., when it is certain there was a clock at Windsor, since in the last year of his reign the sum of £50 was expended upon a new bell for it; and there is reason to believe that the castle clock has always occupied the same situation.\n\nThe bell tower, anciently \"the curfew tower\", was in early times the prison of the castle; and in the crypt underneath, the cells are still perfect in which state prisoners were confined. On the stone walls are many initials and dates, several so far back as a.d. 1600, but none earlier, except such as are undoubtedly forgeries. The accompanying engraving will convey an idea of this interesting interior,  in which, by the way, a subterranean passage has recently been discovered, said to lead under the Thames to Burnham Abbey, distant three miles, and supposed to have been constructed to facilitate the escape of the garrison at a period of anticipated peril. Messrs. Tighe and Davis, speaking of this tower, remark that\n\n\"the lower story has remained intact from its foundation. It consists of a chamber twenty-two feet in diameter, vaulted on plain massive stone ribs; the walls twelve feet and a half thick, with arched recesses, terminating in loop-holes. The whole is constructed with chalk, faced and arched with freestone, and is a perfect and most interesting specimen of the architecture of the period.\"\n\nCRYPT IN BELL TOWER\n\nCamden conjectures, \"plausibly enough\", that Windsor derived its name from the winding shores of the adjacent river, being by the Saxons called \"Wyndleshora\": in very ancient documents it is also so termed; and by Leland, \"Windelesore\". The earliest notice of \" Wyndleshora\" is to be found in the \"deed of gift\", by which the Confessor presented it to the monks of St. Peter, Westminster, he having a residence here. It did not, however, continue long in their possession, for the Conqueror, very soon after he subjugated England, \"being enamoured of its situation, its convenience for the pleasures of the chase, the pureness of the air, and its vicinity to woods and waters\", obtained it \"in exchange\", bestowing on the monastery Wakendune and Feringes, in Essex. He at once commenced building a castle on the pleasant site; and in the fourth year of his reign kept his court there, and held there a synod: for eight centuries and a half, therefore, Windsor has been the palace of the British sovereigns, and its history is in a great degree that of the kingdom over which they ruled. *\n\n* The seal of the Corporation of Windsor is here engraved. It will be perceived that the castle forms the principal object. The inhabitants were first incorporated by Edward I., when Windsor was made the county town until 1314, when Edward II. transferred it to Reading. The genuine old name of the town, slightly Latinized into \"Wyndlesorie\", appears on this seal. The corporation consists of a high steward (H.R.H. the Prince Consort), recorder, mayor, six aldermen, &c. It was declared a free borough in 1276. The population, by the census of 1851, was about 9000. The borough sends two members to parliament. Its principal public structure, the hall and corn-market, was built by Sir Christopher Wren, in 1686.\n\nWINDSOR CASTLE\n\nIn the prodigious pile which now covers the hill, there can be little resemblance to the castle in which the first William received his proud Norman barons, and the humbled Saxon \"thegns\" he had subdued. It was not until King Henry I. had enlarged it \"with many fair buildings\", and kept his Whitsuntide there, in the year 1110, that it became famous as the royal residence. He was married to his second queen at Windsor, in 1122, and five years afterwards he held another \"solemn feast\" at the castle, when David, King of Scotland, and the English barons, swore fealty to the king's daughter, the Empress Maud, at which time Windsor was esteemed the second fortress of the kingdom. More than one parliament was held here in this reign; it was within its walls that John angrily awaited the meeting of his barons at Runnymede, they having refused to trust themselves by visiting the king in his stronghold, and the king merely leaving the fortress to append his signature to Magna Charta, and return sulkily to his fastness.\n\nDuring the barons' wars the garrison was lost and won by both parties in turn. The peaceful days of the first Edward note only the records of tournays and residence here. His successor had several royal children born here; Edward of \"Windsor\" was his eldest, who afterwards figures so nobly in English history as Edward III. It derived accessions of strength and beauty from many succeeding monarchs. By the third Edward it was almost entirely rebuilt: the famous William of Wykeham being clerk to the works, \"with ample powers, and a fee of one shilling a day whilst at Windsor, and two shillings when he went elsewhere on the duties of his office\"; his clerk receiving three shillings weekly.\n\nAs evidence of the liberty the king's subjects then enjoyed, it may be stated that \"three hundred and sixty workmen were impressed to be employed on the building, at the king's wages: some of whiom having clandestinely left \"Windsor, and engaged in other employments to greater advantage, writs were issued prohibiting all persons from employing them on pain of forfeiting all their goods and chattels\". Good old times!\n\nIn the great civil war the castle was garrisoned for the parliament, and was unsuccessfully attacked by Prince Rupert in 1642. Six years afterwards it became the prison of Charles I., who here \"kept his sorrowful and last Christmas\".\n\nAfter the Restoration, the second Charles restored the castle from the state of dilapidation in which he found it. But for its present aspect we are mainly indebted to his Majesty George IV., who, by aid of his architect, Jeffrey Wyatt, afterwards Sir Jeffery Wyattville, and \"assisted\" by copious parliamentary grants, gave to the palace its high character; Art contributing largely to the advantages it received from Nature. It is, however, to be regretted that these restorations were not postponed to recent times, when Gothic architecture is so much better understood; we may well imagine how infinitely more perfect the structure would have been if the successor of William of Wykeham had been Gilbert Scott, and not Sir Jeffrey Wyattville.\n\nTo describe Windsor Castle is foreign to our purpose; it would demand a volume instead of a page; and there are many guide-books that do so with sufficient accuracy. Visitors are admitted freely to examine all the more ordinary apartments; *\n\n* Tickets to view the state apartments may be obtained in London from Messrs. Colnaghi, Pall Mall East, and other publishers. But also, by a recent and very judicious arrangement, visitors may receive orders from J. Roberts, Esq., at the Lord Chamberlain's office, within the walls.\n\nand these are richly decorated by works of Art. The corridor contains a large collection of paintings by many of the old masters, mingled with several of our own time,  the portraits of Lawrence, and the commemorative pictures of Wilkie, Leslie, and Winterhalter. During a considerable portion of the year, Windsor Castle is the residence of the Sovereign. It is unnecessary to say that \"the apartments\" ordinarily called \"private\", but which are occasionally, and under certain restrictions, shown to visitors, are fitted up with a degree of graceful refinement unsurpassed in any mansion of the kingdom. They will not indeed vie in costliness of decoration, and extravagance of ornament, with many of the continental palaces; there is here no lavish expenditure, and but little of that \"display\" which excites more of wonder than admiration; but there is an elegant \"fitness\" in all things, appertaining more to comfort than to grandeur, and belonging less to the palace than \"the home\". But in furnishing and decoration, in the several chambers for state purposes, and in all they contain, there is amply sufficient to make the subject satisfied that the sovereign is worthily \"lodged\" when at Windsor, to rejoice that it is so, and fervently to pray that so it may continue to be through many generations yet to come.\n\nWindsor Castle has been always described as the only royal residence in England; certainly, it is the only appanage of the crown that can be considered on a par with those regal dwellings in which other European sovereigns reside, or compared with some of the seats of our nobility scattered throughout the several shires. It is in truth a palace worthy of our monarchs, rising proudly on a steep which commands prospects innumerable on all sides. There is perhaps no single spot in our island from which can be obtained so grand an idea of the beauty and the wealth of England:\n\nAnd ye, that from the stately brow\n\nOf Windsor's heights th' expanse below\n\nOf grove, of lawn, of mead survey,\n\nWhose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among\n\nWanders the hoary Thames along\n\nHis silver-winding- way.\n\nBut the value of Windsor is largely augmented by the associations that connect it with the past. Many of the illustrious names of ten centuries have their records here: here the Order of the Garter was instituted; Windsor Castle is the temple of the order; true heroes, many, have been numbered among the \"poor knights\", who have still their \"convenient lodgings within the walls.\" *\n\n* This establishment was formed by Edward III. They were originally called \"Milites Pauperes\", subsequently \"Alms, or poor knights of Windsor\", but are now distinguished only as \"military knights of Windsor.\" Their number is thirteen of the royal foundation, and five of the foundation of Sir Peter Le Maire, in the reign of James I. There is also an establishment (founded by the will of Mr. James Travers), but not within the walls, for seven naval officers. By one of the early regulations it was declared that \"the knights should be elected from gentlemen brought to necessity through adverse fortune, and such as had passed their lives in the service of their prince.\" This wholesome rule has been seldom adhered to until of late years. During the sovereignty of Queen Victoria no claims have been regarded except those of merit and service. It is a gratifying sight, and one of which all Englishmen may be rightly proud, to see these gentlemen thus comfortably provided for in their honoured age.\n\nSt. George's Chapel is in the lower ward of the castle; it was begun by King Edward IV., the older chapel, founded by Henry I., having gone to decay, as well as that rebuilt by Edward III. The king, determined that his new building should equal any fabric then in existence, appointed the Bishop of Salisbury to superintend it: so costly and laborious was the work that it was not completed till the reign of Henry VIII., the roof of the choir being the last thing done, in the year 1508. Sir Reginald Bray, the prime-minister to Henry VII., succeeded the Bishop of Salisbury as clerk of the works, and he was a liberal contributor to its completion; his cognizance occurs on several parts of the building. Some remains of the older chapel of Henry III. are still, however, believed to exist on the north side of the dean's cloisters, and at the east end of the chapel, behind the altar, where one of the doors is covered with old wrought iron-work of much beauty.\n\nThe chapel is the mausoleum of many kings. The earliest buried here was the unfortunate Henry VI.: but his tomb has been long since destroyed, and the royal arms, under a simple arch, marks the spot ¦where it once stood. In the north aisle is the tomb of Edward IV.; it consists of a simple slab, over which is erected an open screen, highly enriched with Gothic tabernacle-work in iron, which has been gilt. In the year 1789 the vault below was opened, and the skeleton of the king discovered in a plain leaden coffin. In a vault beneath the choir King Henry VIII. lies buried; he has no monument, but one was in course of erection by him when he died, which he directed to be made more stately than the tombs of any of his predecessors. They were all despoiled and destroyed in the great civil war. One of his queens, Jane Seymour, is also buried at Windsor, and so was King Charles I. *\n\n* The tomb-house now used as a royal burial vault was originally designed by Wolsey for himself. It was fitted as a chapel by James II., and, after his abdication, allowed to decay, until George III., in the year 1800, gave orders that it should undergo a thorough repair, in order to be used as a place of interment for himself and family a purpose to which it has been since dedicated.\n\nSt. George's Hall was built by Edward III. as a banquetiug-room for the Knights of the Garter, when they met to celebrate the festival of their patron annually at Windsor. The old seal of the warden and college of the chapel of St. George, at Windsor, is curious, as depicting the king kneeling to the patron saint of England. It has that minutiae of detail which gives so much interest to these early works. At this time the festival was celebrated with tournay and processional display; many noble foreigners were invited to be present, and the utmost splendour of feudal pomp was lavished on the ceremony. For more than two centuries feasts of this kind were annually held at Windsor, The new statutes of the order, made by Henry VIII., preluded the necessity of holding the great feast here; and in the reign of Elizabeth it was arranged to be held wherever the court happened to be. So showy were these displays, that knights-companions were allowed to bring fifty followers; and admission to the order has always been considered one of the highest honours an English sovereign can bestow. Their number (exclusive of foreign princes) is limited to twenty-five. The stalls of the sovereign and the knights-companions of the Garter are situated in the choir of St. George's Chapel. Each stall is enriched with carving, and behind is the armorial bearings of each knight, and above the silken banner emblazoned with his arms. The royal stall is on the right of the entrance, and is distinguished by a larger banner of velvet, mantled with silk.\n\nOf the Order of the Garter, Selden says: \n\n\"It exceeds in majesty, honour, and fame, all chivalrous orders in the world\", and has \"precedence of antiquity before the eldest rank of honour of that kind anywhere established.\"\n\nOf course a chivalric institution of the middle ages, so entirely adapted to the knight-errantry then practised, has lost much of its meaning and use in modern times; it is now simply a distinction; but it is the noblest the sovereign of these realms can bestow, and among the brotherhood are enrolled the names of sovereigns of other kingdoms, who willingly admit the honour accorded by such companionship. The origin of the order is still involved in doubt. The recent historians of Windsor, whose work we have several times quoted, tell us, \"the annals of the institution, the chroniclers of the time, and the public records, do not afford the slightest information on tbe subject; and although some writers on the order have treated with contempt the romantic incident to which its extraordinary symbol has been ascribed, they have neither succeeded in showing its absurdity, nor suggested a more probable theory. The popular account is, that during a festival at court, a lady happened to drop her garter, which was taken up by King Edward; who, observing a significant smile among the bystanders, exclaimed with some displeasure, 'Honi soit qui mal y pense'  'Shame to him who thinks ill of it.' In the spirit of gallantry which belonged no less to the age than to his own disposition, conformably to the custom of wearing a lady's favour, and perhaps to prevent any farther impertinence, the king is said to have placed the garter round his own knee.\" *\n\n* Such was the opinion of one of our soundest historical antiquaries, the late Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas, who first expressed it in his History of the Order of the Garter, and afterwards in his communication on the early history of the order, \"Archaeologia\", vol. xxiii.\n\nHe thinks the Story \"perfectly in character with the manners and feelings of the time, and the circumstance is very likely to have occurred.\" It should be noted that this writer had no tendency to \"romance\", and but expressed the conviction of a mind devoted to dry research; but his conviction was essentially based on probabilities.\n\nBut greatest among all the many attractions of Windsor Castle are, perhaps, those which are presented to the visitor by the views he obtains from the terraces, or any of the adjacent heights, and especially from the battlements of \"the Round Tower\", \n\nOf hills and dales, and woods, and lawns, and spires,\n\nAnd glittering towns and silver streams.\n\nHe stands in the centre of a panorama of unequalled beauty, and he is, as he ought to be, proud of his country. Look where he will, some object of deep and exciting interest meets his eye. Immediately beneath him, and seeming as if part of the grand demesne, is Eton, with its many associations of the present and the past, and fertile in hopes of the future. Here Wellington learned his first lessons in war; here, in his boyhood, the victory of Waterloo was fought and won; here William Pitt, and here also his great father, were the embryo pilots who steered \"the ship\" through the storm; here Bolingbroke, Camden, Walpole, Fielding, Boyle, Fox, Porson, Canning, and a host of other immortal men laid the foundations of that renown which became the glory of their country. Farther on is Slough, where, in a comparatively humble dwelling, the Herschels held commune with the stars. *\n\n* The famous telescope of Dr. Herschel is still preserved in the garden of the house in which he lived, and may be seen without much difficulty by persons desirous of renderiug homage to the memory of the great astronomer.\n\nSTOKE POGIS CHURCH\n\nYet a little farther is the churchyard in which Gray lies, that of \"Stoke Pogis\",  beneath the tomb he erected to his mother and his aunt; it is the square tomb seen in our cut, and is without his name upon it, but a plain tablet on the wall records that \"opposite this stone, in the same tomb upon which he has so feelingly recorded his grief at the loss of a beloved parent\", his remains were deposited, August 1771. The churchyard is well worthy of a pilgrimage  it is a pleasant field walk of about two miles from Slough, and retains many features alluded to in the famous \"Elegy.\" Still nearer Windsor is the ivy-covered tower of Upton, which is very ancient, and bears traces of Norman workmanship. It is believed by many to have been the one the poet had in mind, if not in eye, while writing. It certainly accords better than that at Stoke Pogis with his description  it is, and has been for centuries, \"ivy-mantled\". Upton was one of his early haunts; the gloomy character of the church and neighbourhood in twilight must have been well suited to the thoughts of the poet in this his most popular work.\n\nTHE IVY-MANTLED TOWER\n\nIver, Langley, Bulstrode, Dropmore, Burnham, and Dorney  places honoured in history and cherished in letters  will be pointed out to those who examine the rich landscape in this direction. Looking eastward and southward, other historic sites, and other examples of beautiful scenery, come within his ken. On a level with the eye is a range of hills  St. Leonard's Hill, Highstanding Hill, Priest's Hill, and Cooper's Hill; while further eastward are St. Anne's Hill, and St. George's Hill. At St. Leonard's Hill dwelt \"for a season\" the Earl of Chatham, \"the great father of a greater son\"; there, too, is Binfield, where Pope \"lisped in numbers\", \n\nFirst in these fields he tried the sylvan strain;\n\nunder the trees of Windsor Forest, in his boyhood, he conned his lessons, accompanied by his tutor, an old French Roman Catholic priest. Cooper's Hill overlooks Runnymede, commemorated in the beautiful verse of Denham \n\nHere his first lays majestic Denham sung;\n\nwhile St. Anne's Hill looks down on the town of Chertsey, where dwelt in calm retirement, after seasons of exciting labour and thought, Charles James Fox, and where\n\nThe last accents flow'd from Cowley's tongue.\n\nGazing up \"the Long Walk\",  that noble tree-avenue of three miles,  the visitor sees the statue of George IV., a colossal work, standing on a rock, and placed on a mound; from this point we obtain a peep into the ancient glades, and contemplate those venerable sovereigns of the forest, who wore their green leaves in glory when the Conqueror was at Hastings.\n\nTo enumerate half the places seen from Windsor Castle, and which time, circumstance, and some heroic or grateful memory have rendered famous, would occupy pages of our tour. We may not forget, however, that the sight is often cheered and gratified while wandering over the view from \"Windsor's heights\" by those well-managed and productive \"farms\", which, under the personal care of the Prince Consort, are examples and lessons to the English gentleman.\n\nBut to the present age, and the existing generation, the castle at Windsor is suggestive of holier and happier feelings than those we derive from the past. The most superb of our palaces is accepted as a model for the home of the humblest, as of the highest, British subject; the lowliest in position, as well as the loftiest in rank, deriving their best example from those graces and virtues which are adornments of the proudest mansion of the realm. And not alone is this \"home\" pre-eminent for domestic happiness: the personal character of the Sovereign, and that of her illustrious Consort, influence every class and order of society; they are the patrons of all improvements for the good of their country; all its charities are helped and forwarded by them; under their just and considerate rule, at a time when every state in Europe was in peril, there was no disaffection at home: loyalty has become the easiest of Enghsh duties; those who teach the present generation the old and venerated lesson, \"Fear God and honour the Queen\", have to contend against no prejudice, to reason down no opposing principle, to overcome no conscientious scruples that rational liberty is abridged by earnest and devoted homage to the crown. It is the universal heart of her kingdom which utters the \"common\" prayer  \"that God will with favour behold our most gracious sovereign lady Queen Victoria; endow her plenteously with heavenly gifts; grant her in health and wealth long to live, and strengthen her that she may vanquish and overcome all her enemies.\"\n\nThe \"Little Park\", so called because of its immediate contiguity to the castle, and to distinguish it from the \"Great Park\", is described as about four miles in circumference; it derives interest, in addition to its intrinsic beauty, as the scene of those revels which Shakspere has described in his \"Merry Wives of Windsor\". *\n\n* The Little Park was enclosed some years ago, during the present reign, and the meadow below the slope was given in exchange to the people of Windsor, who now play at cricket there, and use it for fetes and other amusements.\n\nHERNE'S OAK\n\nAnd here was the famous tree  \"Heme's Oak\"  round which \"the hunter\" \n\nSome time a keeper here in Windsor Forest \n\nwas doomed to walk \"all the winter time\". The veritable tree was cut down by an unfortunate mistake at the close of the past century. Ireland, in his picturesque views of the Thames, published in 1792, describes it as then standing, and gives an engraving of it, which we copy.\n\nHERNE'S OAK: THE EARLIER\n\nThere are, however, many in Windsor who believe that this tree was not the tree, but that a venerable ruin which still exists, and to preserve which every possible care has been taken, is actually that to which the \"immortal poet\" made reference in the drama of which the scene is laid in this neighbourhood. Among the most strenuous advocates for this view of the case is Mr. Jesse, whose works exhibit so much of pure fancy in combination with observation, thought, and genuine love of Nature; and there can be no doubt that the venerable father of the forest, whose cause Mr. Jesse eloquently adopts, was aged when Falstaff was pricked by the fairies under the branches of some denizen of the forest \"thereabouts\": *\n\n* An inscription has been placed on this tree from Shakspere, as if to identify it with that to which the poet alludes. Messrs. Tighe and Davis, in their great book on Windsor, have again entered into the entire question as to the fate of the old tree; they have come to the conclusion that the genuine tree has been destroyed, and that the present one is one of the old trees in an avenue once Known as Queen Elizabeth's Walk. It is a tree of no remarkable size, and was alive in 1790, when the real tree was cut down.\n\nUnder its boughs, all mossed with age,\n\nAnd high top bald with grey antiquity.\n\nHERNE'S OAK: THE LATER\n\nThis tree is of a picturesque character, it is venerable and interesting, and the reader will be pleased to examine its likeness, as an example of the antique features of the sylvan scenery of Windsor. *\n\n* The question as to the identity of this tree with that named by Shakspere was anxiously inquired into by Mr. Knight in his edition of the immortal poet's works, and he places beyond doubt the fact of its destruction.\n\nWest, the president of the Royal Academy, used to relate that King George III. \"had directed all the trees in the park to be numbered, and upon the representation of the bailiff that certain trees encumbered the ground, directions were given to fell those trees, and that Heme's Oak was among the number\".\n\nMr. Nicholson, the landscape painter, some time after this made further inquiries on the point, and requested Lady Ely to ask the king himself, who confirmed the story, saying, \"that when he was a young man it was represented to him that there were several old oaks in the park which had become unsightly objects, and that it would be desirable to take them down. He gave immediate directions that such trees should be removed; but he was afterwards sorry he had given such an order inadvertently, because he found that, among the rest, the remains of Herne's Oak had been destroyed\".\n\nIf any doubt remains, it will certainly be removed by the fact that about the period the following lines appeared in a newspaper (the Whitehall Evening Post). Mr. Thomas Wright, F.S.A., has courteously forwarded them to us, as copied by him out of an old volume of \"cuttings\" collected by his father.\n\nODE,\n\nUPON HERNE'S OAK BEING CUT DOWN, IN THE SPRING OF 1796\n\n______\n\n'There is an old tale goes, that Herne the hunter,\n\nSome time a keeper here in Windsor Forest,\n\nDoth all the winter time, at still midnight,\n\nWalk round about an oak,' &c.\n\nSHAKSPERE'S Merry Wives of Windsor\n\nWithin this dell, for many an age,\n\nHerne's Oak uprear'd its antique head; \n\nOh! most unhallow'd was the rage\n\nWhich tore it from its native bed.\n\nThe storm that stript the forest bare\n\nWould yet refrain this tree to wrong;\n\nAnd Time himself appear'd to spare\n\nA fragment he had known so long.\n\n'Twas mark'd with popular regard,\n\nWhen famed Elizabeth was queen;\n\nAnd Shakspere, England's matchless bard,\n\nMade it the subject of a scene.\n\nSo honour'd when in verdure drest.\n\nTo me the wither'd trunk was dear;\n\nAs, when the warrior is at rest.\n\nHis trophied armour men revere.\n\nThat nightly Herne walk'd round this oak.\n\nThe superstitious eld received;\n\nAnd what they of his outrage spoke\n\nThe rising age in fear believed.\n\nThe hunter, in his morning range.\n\nWould not the tree with lightness view:\n\nTo him Herne's legend, passing strange,\n\nIn spite of scoffers still seem'd true.\n\nOh! where were all the fairy crew\n\nWho revels kept in days remote,\n\nThat round the oak no spell they drew,\n\nBefore the axe its fibres smote?\n\nCould wishes but ensure the power,\n\nThe tree again its head should rear,\n\nShrubs fence it with a fadeless bower,\n\nAnd these inscriptive lines appear:\n\n'Here, as wild Avon's poet stray'd ' \n\nHold;  let me check this feeble strain \n\nThe spot by Shakspere sacred made,\n\nA verse like mine would but profane.\n\nFrom the parks at Windsor we are naturally led to some consideration of Windsor Forest: there is nothing, of its class in the kingdom more entirely beautiful,  in a word, it is worthy of the magnificent castle to which it is attached. Although now of comparatively limited extent, it was \"anciently\" among the largest forests of the kingdom. *\n\n* One of the most beautiful spots in Windsor Forest is \"the Heronry\"; the birds are still numerous there. It lies in the vicinity of the red brick tower at the western extremity of the park. The neighbouring scenery strongly calls to mind the sylvan descriptions in \"As You Like It\". It is probable that Shakspere derived many of his ideas of forest scenery from Windsor Forest.\n\n\"It comprised a part of Buckinghamshire, as well as a considerable district of Surrey, and ranged over the whole of the south-eastern part of Berkshire, as far as Hungerford.\" In Surrey it included Chertsey, and its eastern boundary is said to be marked by an aged oak-tree still standing, at Addlestone, and under the boughs of which tradition states that Wickliff preached. The reader will, no doubt, be gratified if we submit to him a picture of this tree also.\n\nWICKCLIFF'S OAK\n\nTHE KEEPER'S DAUGHTER\n\nLet us vary our more matter-of-fact details by the introduction of one of those sketches which, though of little importance in themselves, like the lights in a picture, may give strength and value to a subject.\n\nMany years have passed since we believed we knew every house, cottage, lodge, and tree in the picturesque neighbourhood of Old Windsor; indeed once, when in very ill health, we spent three months at a keeper's lodge; his wife had been the favourite servant of an old friend, and we were especially recommended to her care because of the air, and quiet, and new milk, and fresh eggs, and the quantity of game (no imputation on the good keeper's honesty). It was then we learned all the green paths and brown roads, and dales and dells, of this charming locality; spending hours, day after day, in the forest, with no other companions than a sure-footed pony and the keeper's only child  a particularly shy, mild, blue-eyed, blushing sort of girl, who looked fifteen, but was quite twenty; who used to cry over \"Paul and Virginia\" at least once a week, and knew by heart every word of \"Turn, gentle hermit of the dale\", and \"Margaret's Ghost\"; who loved moonlight, believed in fortune-tellers, and confessed that whenever she tossed a cup she found a true-lover's knot in the bottom. It was, therefore, evident that the girl had a lover somewhere; but as we had never seen him, we asked no questions. We had taken several excursions together, and we fancied we had made considerable progress in all kinds of forestry: could tell the different sorts of birds'-nests at a glance; could find a hare's form, and could track a rabbit; could tell how the wind blew, and where the deer lay; and knew many lonely roads and winding paths where that enemy of tranquillity, \"the public\", had never been.\n\nOne evening, returning from a delicious ramble, our fair guide turned into a cover so close that we almost laid down on the pony's neck to avoid contact with boughs and brambles; and when that peril was past, we found ourselves on a long strip of upland which stretched away for a considerable distance. This narrow elevation, had it been near the castle, or any other dwelling, would have formed a terrace, sloping as it did on each side into the wildest underwood, running on boldly and unsheltered, save at its abrupt termination, where, in far back times, two trees had been planted, designed perhaps to form what their interlacing boughs really had formed  a natural arch. <\n\nThrough this there was a bird's-eye peep at the Thames: there lay, like a vast mirror, the calm, silent river, lending its magic light to the landscape, touched here and there by the rose-coloured and saffron tints of the setting sun; indeed, the sun had set, but the tender farewell colours still lingered on the clouds, and were reflected by the faithful river. The scene was so unexpected, and so fascinating, that we drew up with an exclamation of delight, much to the pony's contentment, who immediately began to crop the grass.\n\nAfter a sufficient pause, so rapidly were the tints fading that, as we rode slowly along the ridge towards the trees, the river, in the deepening twilight, assumed a very soft, grey, lake-like effect  it was the perfection of repose, we asked our fair guide (whose bustling, thrifty mother had given her the out-of-the-way name of Rizpah) if this elevation was supposed to be natural or artificial, and she informed us that some said it was thrown up in old times in a single night, so that one of the ancient queens could sit there on her palfrey to see a battle.\n\nThis was not satisfactory, but our guide had no more to tell. Rizpah, however, deficient as she was in historic information touching the pathway, became quite eloquent in its praise; she thought it the prettiest spot in park or forest  the river shone so bright between the trees. Did we not observe how beautifully the ferns waved at either side?  they were so large: and in the little valley beyond the trees, just down the slope, there were so many orchids; and at the other side of the woodcutter's hut (yes, that distant brown ridge was a wood-cutter's hut) there were such lovely beds of iris, and such reeds! Should she go and gather some? the pony could not well go along in the hollow  the felled timber lay here, and there, and everywhere; but she could run over them  it was so pleasant to spring from one log to another!\n\nBut the blackbird was whistling his evening hymn, the bees and butterflies had folded themselves up for the night, and the \"whang \" of the cockchafer, and peculiar cry of the owl  not the \"hoot-tu-who!\" but the waking cry, a struggle in his throat, trying his voice, as it were, before he commences his fearful shout  warned us that the night would fall before we arrived at the lodge if we tarried longer; and so we told Rizpah very decidedly  for she always tried to have her own way  that we would come another time  the dew was falling, and we dared not linger. The girl looked disappointed, and we turned our pony (nothing loth) homeward; suddenly a clear sharp cry  the nearest attempt a woman makes at a shout  broke upon our ear, and in less than a minute it was answered. We looked for Rizpah, and saw her running towards us from beneath the long shadows of the arched trees.\n\n\"What cry was that?\"\n\n\"It was I\", replied the panting Rizpah, as she laid her hand on the pony's neck, and seemed intent on picking her steps, though the path was broad and clear, a rich carpet of short grass and moss; \"it was I; and did you not hear the echo?\"\n\n\"Echo!\" we repeated; \"we heard an answering shout, but no echo.\"\n\n\"It is a curious echo\", persisted Rizpah; \"we have many curious sounds in these parks and forests.\"\n\nNow we had been fully convinced that Rizpah was practising upon our credulity, and were half amused and half provoked at the coolness and self-possession of the shy, innocent-looking forest girl, but we simply repeated,\n\n\"Very curious indeed; was the echo there when the queen sate on her palfrey to see the battle of the Thames?\"\n\nRizpah replied, with her usual mixture of coolness and innocence, \"She did not know.\"\n\nRizpah's mother was a stout, rosy dame, simple-minded and straight-forward  bright, cheerful, good-natured, and somewhat noisy; but though her voice was loud, it was not unmusical or inharmonious, and there was a tenderness in its tone when she spoke to the sick or the old, or the little children who sometimes found their way to her door, that was quite pleasant to hear. Her husband was like all other \"keepers\"  a tall, broad-shouldered man; we never saw him out of his dun-coloured leather loggias, or without his gun, and hardly ever heard his voice. She patted and petted him and her daughter, and patronized them in an easy, good-natured way, as if they were both little ones. She extended this care-taking to ourselves; and thus saved us all trouble in our domestic arrangements, while evidently increasing her own happiness. A great portion of that happiness depended on her being considered a \"clever woman\"; she was proud of that, proud of being clever and clear-sighted.\n\nOn our return, we were reproved for being out so late, and Rizpah was rather sharply questioned as to the cause. We had just commenced telling the good dame about the echo, when Rizpah, who was preparing tea, poured, as if accidentally, a little of the boiling water out of the tea kettle on her mother's favourite cat  a cat, by the way, who was chained every evening at six o'clock to the fender, to prevent its poaching. The scolding and commiseration which followed interrupted the story.\n\nThe cottage was a perfect bower of ivy, and clematis, and roses, and woodbine: along the south wall each climber seemed to flourish over its own particular territory, but at the gable end, where our rooms were situated, all mingled together; while the eaves were tenanted by birds, which even the cat did not seem inclined to disturb.\n\n\"If you please\", said Rizpah, while removing the tea-tray, \"there is no use in telling mother about the echo; she never believes in it, or in anything  not even in Herne the Hunter, or the fairy bridges at full moon over the Thames. Father and I never tell her anything of that sort.\"\n\n\"But she could test the echo.\"\n\n\"It's too far for mother to walk, and the pony would not be able to carry her; so, if you please, it's better to say nothing about it. She would begin to fancy things.\"\n\n\" What things, Ilizpah ?\"\n\n\" Oh, I don't know\", replied the girl, blushing\"; mother has a very active mind: I would rather you said nothing about it.\" And she raised her soft limpid blue eyes to ours with such an appealing look, that we said quietly,\n\n\"Very well\", and commenced reading.\n\nIn about an hour we heard a soft, low whistle, a little to the right; it was repeated twice. We opened our door, and passing along a passage, entered the kitchen; there stood Rizpah, looking decidedly sulky, with extended hands, holding a very thick skein of worsted, which her mother was slowly winding, talking all the time in an unmistakeable lecturing voice.\n\n\"I fear\", I said, \"there are poachers about; I have heard a whistle repeated three times.\"\n\n\"It's only the wind in the woodbine\", said Rizpah, quickly; and while she spoke the clock struck nine.\n\n\"It's too early for poachers\", said the dame, \"and the moon is at full; they know better than to be about at this hour, or at full moon.\"\n\n\"It was not the wind in the woodbine, Rizpah\", we replied, \"nor in the ivy either  surely we must know the whistle of a man from the whistle of the wind: besides, there is not sufficient air afloat to move the petal of a rose.\"\n\nAt that moment an ill-favoured, snub-nosed, rough-coated, faithful, ugly dog  one of those miracles of canine sagacity and bad temper to be depended on only in moments of difficulty and danger  stood suddenly up on his hind legs, and placing his stubbed, vulgar paws on the ledge of the window, pricked his ears, bared his teeth ( Rizpah used to call it laughing ) whined, and wagged a nothing of a stump, which courtesy might designate a tail, most vigorously.\n\n\"Down, Dicken! down, sir!\" exclaimed Rizpah, stamping her foot.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said the dame, throwing her ball on the floor, \"is that the wind in the woodbine? Soh! There's but one human creature beside your father and us two that Dicken laughs at!\" The dame threw up the window, and there was a rustling among the branches; but Rizpah held the struggling Dicken in her arms.\n\n\"It's either father or the white owl in the ivy\", faltered Rizpah, still restraining the dog.\n\n\"Father, or the white owl in the ivy!\" repeated the dame, in her loudest and most contemptuous tone; \"why, you jade, you know father's always a-bed and asleep, on moonlight nights, until eleven. The owl in the ivy, indeed! why he was found dead this morning.\" In a moment she had seized one of the guns, which always lay in a corner of the kitchen, and presented it at the darkness. Rizpah fell on her knees screaming, and Dicken sprang out of the window.\n\n\"What's to do here?\" inquired the keeper's gruff, determined voice from the outside, and we saw him dimly under the shadow of the projecting roof;\n\n\"put down the gun, mother, and open the door; it's quite time to put a stop to this hide-and-seek foolery.\"\n\nRizpah, trembling and blushing, rose from her knees: it was not so dark but she saw that her father had taken a prisoner. \"Oh, mother! mother!\" she exclaimed, \"father knew he was come back  and oh! mother! mother!\"\n\nAnd \"Ah, Rizpah! Rizpah! was that the echo from the Thames? Is that great six-foot-one young man the 'wind in the woodbine?' Is the individual you call 'Paul' the 'owl in the ivy?' Sly, sly, quiet little blushing Rizpah! for shame!\"\n\nThe next morning it was the dame who looked sulky, and instead of patting and petting Rizpah, it was Rizpah who petted and patted the dame. There might have been \"family reasons\", which did not concern us, but it was evident that the usually self-contained gamekeeper had determined Paul should marry Rizpah, and that Rizpah offered no opposition. The dame was either tired out or won over  perhaps a little of both; at all events, we lost our forest guide, but not before we knew the forest well.\n\nROMNEY AIT\n\nLeaving the bridge that connects Windsor with Eton,  the Castle to the right, in Berkshire, and the College to the left, in Buckinghamshire,  we pass a long and narrow and prettily wooded ait, Romney Island, so well known to Etonians, and dear also to brethren of the angle,  for here good old Izaak passed many pleasant days of spring and summer with his beloved friends, Cotton, Donne, and that great and excellent man, Sir Henry Wotton, appointed by James I. Provost of Eton, \"as the fittest place to nourish holy thoughts, and afford rest to his body and mind\", after his busy life as an ambassador. We may fancy the four high and pure souls luxuriating under the shadows of refreshing trees, their simple enjoyments augmented by rare converse concerning Nature and her works: kindly, and loving, and gentle hearts; all in their decline (for Sir Henry was sixty when he took orders and office there), yet fresh and green, and young in age; each illustrating that passage which he who was \"chiefest\" among them so sweetly and so truly wrote: \n\nThis man is free from servile bands,\n\nOf hope to rise or fear to fall;\n\nLord of himself, though not of lands \n\nAnd having nothing, yet hath all.\n\nWINDSOR LOCK [ ROMNEY LOCK WTSWG ]\n\nWINDSOR LOCK [ now called Romney Lock ]\n\nWe soon pass through Windsor Lock, still lonely and retired, although so much of business and bustle is close at hand. *\n\n* For the sketch we engrave we are indebted to Commander King, the gallant son of one of \"the military knights\", who, by the gracious kindness of his sovereign, \"reposes\" here in happy tranquillity, after a long life of honourable and active labour.\n\nCaptain King is well known to, and highly respected by, all artists and lovers of art. He was for many years a regular contributor to the walls of the Royal Academy; and his copies of Claude are among the best that have been made from the pictures of that great master.\n\n[ BLACK POTTS ] RAILWAY BRIDGE WTSWG\n\nUnder the railway bridge of the Great Western we then row, between another ait  \"Blackpott's\"  and \"the Home Park\",\n\nVICTORIA BRIDGE WTSWG\n\nVICTORIA BRIDGE\n\nuntil we arrive at Victoria Bridge, a new and exceedingly graceful structure, which connects Windsor with the pretty and picturesque village of Datchet. The bridge, which has its companion a mile or so lower down the stream  the Albert Bridge WTSWG  was built in 1851, from the design of Thomas Page, Esq., civil engineer, the acting engineer of the Thames Tunnel, and the engineer for Westminster Bridge.\n\n\"Datchet mead\" is the name given to the lowland on the banks of the Thames between the river and the Little Park. It is the scene of Falstaff's adventure in the buck-basket, and \"the muddy ditch close by the Thames' side\" existed until the time of Anne, when it was converted into a covered drain, and known as Hoghole. The embankment raised to form the approach to this new bridge destroyed the last vestige of this hole, together with the small brick arch over it. The scenery about this bridge is very charming  quiet lawns, rich woods, and the noble castle, meeting the eye on all sides.\n\nOLD WINDSOR WTSWG\n\nPassing other pleasant places, and some graceful islets, which give their charms to the river scenery, we arrive at Old Windsor.\n\nIt is certain that Edward the Confessor some time kept his court here, and it was that sovereign who presented the manor to the Abbot of Westminster, to increase the wealth of the monastery he had there founded. The site of the palace at Old Windsor is not known with certainty. A farm-house, which until recently stood west of the church and near the river, surrounded by a moat, probably marked the site. Scarcely raised above the level of the Thames, which flows close to it and supplied the moat with water, the palace had no natural defence, and was used rather as a convenient spot for hunting and hawking than as a place of strength. *\n\n* Tighe and Davis's \"Annals of Windsor\".\n\nWhen the Conqueror was firmly fixed upon the throne, he obtained the land from the monastery in exchange, and commenced building the Castle of Windsor on the elevation in the vicinity so peculiarly adapted for the site of a castle, according to the established rule of these defences. But the palace at Old Windsor was not deserted by royalty until long after the Castle was built. The probability is, that this castle was a simple military defence, and had no conveniency for residence until Henry I. completed, in 1110, additional buildings, and royally opened his home at Whitsuntide; after which we hear little of Old Windsor, except that the manor passed into a variety of hands, by whom it was held from the king by the service of finding a man with lance and dart to attend the royal army. Since the fourteenth century it has been held on lease under the crown.\n\nPerhaps there are not so many dwellings in Old Windsor now as there were when the Norman took possession of England: and naturally and rationally preferring the height to the dell  to overlook the Thames rather than submit to its occasional inundations  commenced the fortress that has endured for eight centuries and a half, without having encountered any of those \"battles, sieges, fortunes\", to which so many other \"strong places\" have succumbed. Yet in Old Windsor there is nothing old; we search in vain for any indications of antiquity; there is no \"bit of ruin\" to carrv association back.\n\nOLD WINDSOR CHURCH\n\nOLD WINDSOR CHURCH\n\nA new road from Windsor leads partly through the Long Walk, beside the model farm of his Royal Highness the Prince Consort, and a turn to the left conducts to the venerable church. It is a by-road, rarely trodden except by those who worship; a group of noble trees, and some yews of great age, completely surround and almost hide the sacred edifice. It is not, however, of very early date, and is rather picturesque than beautiful.\n\nIn the churchyard was buried that unhappy lady  fair and frail  who, as an actress and an author, obtained some share of notoriety at the close of the past century, and who was celebrated by the name of \"Perdita\", from her clever impersonation of that character in Shakspere's \"Winter's Tale\". A tomb covers her remains, but it is overgrown with nettles: there have been none, for half a century and more, to care for the last resting-place of unhappy \"Mary Robinson\".\n\nAn unpretending gravestone, near at hand, honours the memory of another who is there buried, one who was neither more nor less than a simple shepherd.\n\nA sensation, difficult to describe, oppressed us when, after a lapse of many years, we found ourselves in the ever green churchyard of Old Windsor; we felt a loneliness that was not tranquillity  an undefined longing it was for perpetual repose: all around us was so still that even the song of the robin, and the footfall of the little wren upon the crisped leaves, disturbed our musing. It was a bright, glowing autumn day: there was no wind, no breeze, not enough to send another brown leaf from the oak hardly any air to breathe: a very bright day for England, for the soft vapours, so thin and gauze-like, which here and there veiled the azure firmament, could hardly be called \"clouds\"  a cloudless autumn day: yet no shine of sun could penetrate the matted branches of the grand outspread yews. It flooded them with light; their luscious berries were of more than coral brightness. It was wonderful to stand off at a little distance from these resolute, unyielding trees, presenting the same outline, the same tone of colour, to one century after another, and note how their uppermost platforms  tier after tier of firm-set boughs  rejoiced in that great sunlight, while beneath reposed the dark ground, carpeted by accumulated spines of countless years.\n\n\"Old Windsor!\" fallen from its ancient state, and but a suburb to the glorious pile beyond it! So \"old\" it is, that every vestige of its antiquity has mouldered into dust  the sacred dust that cherishes the roots of grand old trees, and yields nourishment to the very grass whereon we tread!\n\nThere was a change: the fitful autumn had called up a dark, heavy sweep of clouds, so suddenly, that we knew not whence they came: yet there they were, hanging like a mighty pall across the hemisphere, obscuring the full-faced glory of mid-day, and casting a grey, filmy hue over all the landscape. But we were compensated for the loss of light by the variety of shadows that passed over the church and trees, and we sat on a tombstone to watch their progress. All the tombs in this quiet field of graves have a green-grey tone of colour, caused, perhaps, by age or damp, or a mingling of both; they are in wonderful harmony. Upon some of them are time-honoured names; some are railed in, but the iron has lost its hard and exclusive character  it is either enwreathed by ivy or overgrown by moss. You would rather not believe that those who desired to preserve those particular graves were cold, defiant people, who wished to protect what belonged to them from the contamination of vulgar dust and ashes, but loving, tender folk, who \"honoured their dead\" with fervour in simplicity. How we cling to the desire of being remembered here, as if we doubted how we should be recoguised hereafter! yet how few are the bright names that endure even ten years after their owners have removed into the narrow house  how few of the many swept away by the surges of \"Time\" obtain an immortality derived from Heaven!\n\n\"It be a goin' to rain\", said an old labourer, who had wheeled a barrow, heavily laden with autumn prunings, up the broad gravel walk, close to where we sate:\n\nuntil he spoke we were unconscious of his presence. We looked up, not knowing whether the words were addressed to us or muttered to himself. Although he had that neglected look we too often observe in aged peasants,  as if circumstance ignored the poet's notion of \"a brave peasantry, their country's pride'  his wrinkled skin was fair, and the red tint of the winter apple was on his cheek; there was unextinguished fire in his light blue eye: the face and form were alike Saxon. In his youth the old man must have been conspicuous for strength and beauty. He had withdrawn his hands from the barrow, and wiped his furrowed brow with the remnant of a spotted handkerchief.\n\n\"It be a goin' to rain\", he repeated, in answer to our look of inquiry, \"though the clouds are drifting towards the castle, and may breakover there: but there's no telling at this time o' year  they're here one minute, and gone the next. There's not much in the churchyard to please you: only, maybe, like the rest of the gentry, you want to see what we used to call the tomb of the Fair Shepherdess. Lor! when that tomb was put up first, what numbers came to see it! but there's nothing changes its object so much as curiosity  what people think so much of to-day they don't care about to-morrow. I've seen such loads of lords and gentlemen gazing at that tomb  but not so many ladies. She was a play-actor once, and they called her the Fair Perdita, which is shepherdess, you understand, the fair shepherdess  but to see how one may go from bad to worse! They say a king's love fell upon her like a mildew, and, for all her beauty, withered her up; and then she died, poor thing, bad enough off too. And her daughter,  she has been to see her mother's tomb often, as I know well, for I have been on the spot, and opened the gate to her: and she'd bow and smile like a real lady: but always  and I minded it well  always she came either at early morning or in the gloom before night. She'd hang over the railing, even in winter, like a wreath of snow: it always seemed as though she loved, yet was ashamed of her; and she died just eighteen years after her mother. She could not have been more than five years old when the poor foolish mother died. I can tell over the inscription to you  I learnt it all by heart years and years ago, to repeat to the poor who could not read, and the rich who could not see; but, lor!\" he added in a somewhat peevish tone, \"everybody reads and sees now.  'Mrs. Mary Robinson,'  that's the Perdita,  'Mrs. Mary Robinson, author of poems, and other literary works: died on the 26th of December, 1800, at Englefield Cottage, in Surrey, aged 43 years.' And then the daughter  not married, you understand  'Maria Elizabeth Robinson, daughter of Mary Robinson, of literary fame, who died at Englefield Cottage, January the 4th, 1818, in the 23rd year of her age.'  Two young deaths, and that's the end on't. Why, you'll hardly believe it, now, when the gentry come and ask which is 'Perdita's' tomb, and I tell 'em, maybe they'll hardly damp their shoes to look at it, and ask each other what poems 'twas she wrote, and no one knows  not one can tell! But, some fifty years ago, I've seen some, and from the Castle, too, who would tell them all over plain enough.\"\n\nWe sought to divert the old man's attention from a painful theme by remarking that there was another tomb in the churchyard of such natural and simple interest that we should be glad to know if \"Thomas Pope\", whose grave was close to the church-door, had been one of his friends. The expression of his face changed in a moment: we felt at once that we had fallen in his esteem. \"Tom Pope\", he said, in an indignant tone, \"was only a common shepherd  just as he himself was; only a day labourer nothing more than that! Those who put up the stone needn't have faced it right by the church-door, in the very eyes of the congregation: for his part, he didn't know what the gentry could see in such a headstone, to stand gazing at it, as they often did, on the Sabbath  exalting one poor man above another.\"\n\nWe told him we thought he ought to feel proud of such a distinction for one of his own class, and that we honoured the memory of the real shepherd far more highly than that of the make-believe shepherdess: the one had left an unsullied name, and an example worthy of imitation; the other  poor, fluttering butterfly!  no woman could look on her grave without a blush and a tear. Could he repeat the epitaph on Thomas Pope \"Ah, ah, ah!\"  what a cackling, bitter laugh it was! so contemptuous  \"No  ah, ah! the gentry who liked might read that for themselves. He had nothing to say against Tom Pope!  Tom never had a coat on his back in all his life; nothing but a smock-frock,  and, ah! to put a tomb over him! 'Faithful and honest',  why, to be sure, many as 'faithful' were left under smooth grass: to think of his being exalted on a tombstone!\"\n\nWe were so foolish as to persist  though the old man had resumed his barrow  in the attempt to reason him out of his nature,  a nature by no means peculiar to a Berkshire labourer. \"Surely he ought to feel proud of a distinction conferred upon one of his own people.\"\n\nAlas, alas! Tom Pope was none of his people: his father died at ninety-two  no one put a tomb over him. He himself would be eighty come Easter; and full sure he was no one would put a tomb over him. It was evident he considered the record of Thomas Pope's virtues an insult. He found no fault with the homage rendered to the gaudy imitation; the mock shepherdess had his sympathy,  she did not belong to his race: the real shepherd had his contempt. \"Why should he have a tomb, when no one could put a tomh over him?\"\" The old peasant wheeled away his loadwithout further parley.\n\nThis is the touching inscription on the headstone to the memory of a real shepherd, conferring distinction and honour on the churchyard of Old Windsor \n\nTHOMAS POPE,\n\nSHEPHERD,\n\nWHO DIED JULY THE 20TH, 1832,\n\nAGED 96 YEARS.\n\nCHEERFULLY LABORIOUS TO AN ADVANCED AGE,\n\nHE WAS MUCH ESTEEMED BY ALL CLASSES OF HIS NEIGHBOURS,\n\nSOME OF WHOM HAVE PAID THIS TRIBUTE OF RESPECT TO THE MEMORY\n\nOF A FAITHFUL, INDUSTRIOUS, AND CONTENTED\n\nPEASANT.\n\nALSO,\n\nPHOEBE, WIFE OF THE ABOVE,\n\nWHO DIED MARCH 2ND, 1843,\n\nAGED 90 YEARS.\n\nAT OLD WINDSOR\n\nAT OLD WINDSOR\n\nA passage through the churchyard leads to the Thames, and just at the corner is a quaint old house, which the artist thought it worth his while to copy, less for the mansion, however, than for the scenery about it.\n\nCOOPER'S HILL WTSWG\n\nA mile or so from Old Windsor, and we enter the county of Surrey, on the right bank  Buckinghamshire remaining with us some way further on its left; the two great metropolitan counties then continuing on either side until, east of London, they meet the shires of Essex and Kent. The first object that arrests the eye of the tourist is the spire of the church at Egham; but his attention is soon directed to an object of even greater interest  Cooper's Hill. The hill is indebted for much of its fame to the poem of \"majestic Denham\"; it has other, and earlier, claims to distinction: although little more than \"a steep\", its slopes are gradual and ever green: it is beautifully planted  perhaps was always so  in parts; and is now crowned by charming villas, lawns, and gardens: it was, however, altogether a poetical fancy which thus pictured it \n\nhis shoulders and his sides\n\nA shady mantle clothes; his curled brows\n\nFrown on the gentle stream, which calmly flows;\n\nWhile winds and storms his lofty forehead beat \n\nThe common fate of all that's high and great.\n\nDenham, although born in Dublin, where his father was some time Chief Baron of the Exchequer, was \"native\" to this neighbourhood: here his ancestors lived and were buried. At Egham Church there are several monuments to their memory: his own dust reposes in Westminster Abbey. If he bestowed celebrity on Cooper's Hill, he derived hence the greater portion of his fame: tbe poem was published at Oxford in 1643, during tbe war between the King and tbe Parliament; its popularity was rapid, and has endured to our own time. Dryden described it as \"the exact standard of good writing\"; and \"Denbam's strength\" was lauded by Pope.\n\nRUNNYMEDE WTSWG\n\nVIEW FROM COOPER'S HILL\n\nBut Cooper's Hill has an advantage greater even than that it derives from the poem \n\nThe eye, descending from the hill, surveys\n\nWhere Thames among the wanton valleys strays;\n\nfor at its foot is immortal Runnymede, and midway in its stream is the little island on which, it is said, John, the king, yielded to the barons, who there dictated to the tyrant terms that asserted and secured the liberties of their country. Runnymede is still a plain level field, unbroken by either bouse or barn, or wall or hedge. We know not if by any tenure it bas the right to be ever green; but we have always seen it during many years as a fair pasture  upon which to-day, as seven centuries ago, an army might assemble.\n\nMAGNA CHARTA ISLAND WTSWG\n\nMAGNA CHARTA ISLAND\n\nThe small ait or island  Magna Charta Island  is situate midway between Runnymede and Ankerwyke  now a modern mansion of the Harcourts, but once a nunnery, founded by Sir Gilbert de Montfichet and his son, in the reign of Henry II. Even the walls are all gone; but some ancient trees remain, under one of which tradition states the eighth Henry met and wooed tbe beautiful and unfortunate Anna Boleyn.\n\nIt is a mooted point whether the barons held the island, or the king selected it as the place where the eventful meeting was to take place. In Tighe and Davis's \"Annals of Windsor\", the name of Runnymede, which the field then bore, and still retains, is said to be derived from Run and mede, signifying in Anglo-Saxon, the Council Meadow. It is probable, therefore, that Edward the Confessor occasionally held his witan or council there during his residence at Old Windsor, and that the barons chose the ait as well on account of its previous association with those very rights they met to assert, as because it was a convenient distance from Windsor, sufficiently near for the king, but far enough removed to prevent any treacherous surprise by his forces. The early historians, indeed, expressly assert that the spot was chosen by the barons, the king, according to some, having suggested Windsor as the place of meeting.\n\nAccording to local tradition, the conference took place and the charter was signed on a little island in the river near Ankerwyke, and opposite the meadow, and now called Magna Charta Island. The Charter bears date June 15, 1215. It is certain that John \"took refuge in Windsor Castle in 1215, as a place of security against the growing power of the barons\"; nor did he quit the protection its walls afforded him until after the signing of Magna Charta. The result of this great political gathering is one of the events in the world's history. Hence, as Hume hut coldly writes, \"very important liberties and privileges were either granted or secured to every order of men in the kingdom: to the clergy, to the barons, and to the people.\"\n\nMagna Charta may be considered as a general condensation of the laws for the proper guidance of the kingdom, and the liberty of its subjects, which had descended from the time of Edward the Confessor, and had been confirmed by other kings, particularly the Conqueror. The severe forest laws, and other obnoxious introductions of Norman usage, were always distasteful to Englishmen; and on the accession of Henry I. the celebrated Charter of liberties abolished many vexatious enactments, and placed the right of the subject on a clearer basis. Stephen and Henry II. both confirmed these laws; but the troublesome days which succeeded supplied excuses for their infringement, and the gradual encroachment of the crown on the general privileges of the subject, induced the barons and people to demand from John a clear and full declaration of their rights, to be solemnly confirmed for ever.\n\nThere has long been preserved in our British Museum an ancient Charter which purports to be that which John signed at Runnymede. It is part of the manuscript treasures so industriously collected by Sir Robert Cotton; there is a somewhat curious history of its discovery by Sir Robert at his tailor's, just when he was about to cut it into strips for measures. The story is related by Paul Colomies, who long resided in England; but the indefatigable historian of Magna Charta, Mr. Richard Thomson, inclines to doubt the truth of the Story, and prints a letter from Sir Edward Bering at Dover Castle, in 1630, to Sir Robert Cotton, in which he states that he possesses the document, and is about to send it to him. This famous parchment was much injured by the fire that took place at Westminster in 1731, and destroyed the building containing the Cottonian Library; it is greatly shrivelled and mutilated, and the seal reduced to a shapeless mass. Mr.Thomson is of opinion, that though this famous copy \"has been considered of inferior authority to some others brought forward by the Record Commission, on account of its deficiency in certain words and sentences, which are added for insertion beneath the instrument, yet the same circumstance may very probably be a proof of its superior antiquity, as having been the first which was actually drawn into form and sealed at Runnymede; the original whence all the most perfect copies were taken. *\n\n* The Charter purports to be given \"under our hand at Runningmede, between Windsor and Staines.\" The signature of the king was in all probability \"his mark\", as was usual with the uneducated nobles of his era. It is a curious fact that no sign-manual of a British sovereign is known to exist before that of King Richard II. The usual sign-manual was a rude cross placed before the name written by some \"learned clerk\".\n\nIt was fortunately engraved in facsimile by Pine, before the fire had injured it; and one of the most important clauses is given in our woodcut; it is that which provides for the free and immediate dispensation of justice to all, in the words: \n\n\"No freeman shall be seized or imprisoned, or dispossessed, or outlawed, or in any way destroyed; nor will we condemn him, nor will we commit him to prison, excepting by the legal judgment of his peers, or by the laws of the land.\" *\n\nA CLAUSE OF MAGNA CHARTA\n\n* The original abbreviated Latin would read in full thus: \n\nNullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonatur, aut\n\ndissaisiatur, aut utlageter, aut exuletur, aut aliquo modo\n\ndestruatur, nec super eam ibimus, nec super eam mittimus,\n\nnisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae\n\nBy this important clause the liberty and property of the subject were preserved until after open trial.\n\nThere is another fair copy of this document in the Cotton Library. The Record Commissioners, however, seem to attach most importance to that preserved in Lincoln Cathedral, which is supposed to be the one sent by Hugh, then Bishop of Lincoln, to be placed among the archives there. This is very carefully written, and contains all the words and sentences noted for insertion in the body of that preserved in the British Museum. There is another among the archives of Salisbury Cathedral, which is thought to be the one entrusted to Herbert Poore, the Bishop, or William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, for preservation there, in accordance with the old custom of placing copies of such important documents in the great clerical depositories. These are the only ancient examples of this great grant; but there are many early entries of it in old legal collections, reciting the whole of its clauses, and verifying their accuracy. These were confirmed by other English sovereigns; and the Great Charter was thus the foundation of English liberty.\n\nIt is to be regretted that no monument marks the spot, at Runnymede, where the rights and liberties of the people of England were maintained and secured, although several attempts have been made to raise one here. The very name, however, is a memory imperishable: the ait and meadow are places of pilgrimage to all who boast the Anglo-Saxon blood; and few are they who cross the Atlantic to visit Fatherland without offering homage to their great ancestors in this meadow of eternal fame  repeating, with raised and hearty voice, the lines of the poet: \n\nThis is the place\n\nWhere England's ancient barons, clad in arms,\n\nAnd stern with conquest, from their tyrant king\n\n(Then render'd tame) did challenge and secure\n\nThe Charter of thy freedom. Pass not on\n\nTill thou hast bless'd their memory, and paid\n\nThose thanks which God appointed the reward\n\nOf public virtue.\n\nIn the island which forms so charming a feature in the landscape, the Harcourts have built a small Gothic cottage  an altar-house, so to call it. It contains a large rough stone, which tradition, or fancy, describes as that on which the parchment rested when the king and the barons affixed their signatures to \"the Charter\". It has the following inscription:\n\nBe it remembered that on this island,\n\nin June, 1215,\n\nKing John of England signed\n\nthe Magna Charta;\n\nand in the year 1834,\n\nthis building was erected in commemoration of that great event\n\nby George Simon Harcourt, Esq.,\n\nLord of the Manor, and then High Sheriff of the County\n\nCOTTAGE OF MAGNA CHARTA ISLAND\n\nRIVER COLNE\n\n[ There are several streams called Coln(e):\n\nThe River Colne enters just above Staines Railway Bridge\n\nThe Colne Brook enters below Runnymede Bridge\n\nA different River Colne enters by the Thames and Severn Canal at Lechlade. ]\n\nA little below Ankerwyke, the Coln, which divides the counties of Buckingham and Middlesex, joins the Thames. The river rises near the small market town of Chesham, Bucks, and passing by Cherreys, waters the town of Rickmansworth, Herts, reaches Uxbridge, flows by the once famous village of Iver, refreshes the villages of Drayton and Harmondsworth, and, gathering strength, \"goeth\", to borrow from old Leland, \"through goodly meadows to Colnbrook, and so to the Thames\".\n\nThere is little to interest the voyager after he leaves this interesting neighbourhood, gradually losing sight of Cooper's Hill, until he approaches Staines; we have leisure, therefore, once again to admire the rich foliage of the river  that which ornaments its surface or decorates its banks. We direct the reader's attention to some of the objects that here gratify and instruct.\n\nPERSICARIA\n\nA pretty little weed that decks the still recesses of the river is the amphibious Persicaria (Polygonum amphibium), a plant that seems to thrive equally well on land or water; in the former situation being one of the most troublesome of weeds to the river-side farmer, but when it takes to the water forming one of its greatest ornaments; the green and red shaded leaves floating on the surface, above which rise the bright pink flower-spikes in groups, that wave and dance with every ripple of the water, are always pleasant and cheerful.\n\nFORGET ME NOT\n\nIn no place do we remember to have met with that that most elegant of plants, the Forget-me-not (Myosotis palustris), in such beauty and luxuriance as in some of the fresh grassy nooks that we every now and then come upon in the course of our voyage. This is the true Forget-me- not, the Virgiss-mein-nicht of the Germans, with whom originated, if we mistake not, the romantic knight and lady story to which it owes its name  a name that is often given erroneously to other commoner and less beautiful species with small blue flowers. The glossy green foliage and thick waxen flowers of the true flower sufficiently distinguish it from others, independent of the scientific distinctions. In all European countries, but more especially in this country, the Forget-me-not has been a favoured theme of the poets. There is hardly one of them who has not made it a subject upon which to build some sweet theory of remembered friendship or love. It is attractive, not alone for its own peculiar grace and delicacy, but because it is found every where in England: there is no flower more \"common\", yet there are few more beautiful and none more suggestive.\n\nTHE LARGE FLOWERED WILLOW HERB\n\nThe tall, rosy-flowered plant that makes such a show among the river-side herbage, is the Large-flowered Willow Herb (Epilobium hirsutum), called by the country folks \"Codlings and Cream\", from a supposed resemblance to those luxuries in the smell of the young foliage of this herb. As cattle are fond of eating it, it has been recommended for cultivation as fodder in wet places where other useful plants will not grow, and where the willow herb flourishes luxuriantly. This is one of those conspicuous plants for form and colour that tell with such charming effect when introduced in the foreground of river pictures, in company with the dock-reeds, loose-strife, meadow-sweet, the yellow flag, and other water-nymphs so dear to the landscape-painter of the school of nature. Happily that school is increasing in numbers and in strength: happily, too, there is a growing disposition to avoid those evils which arise from a willingness to copy deformities rather than to seek and find beauty in combination with truth. We cannot too frequently impress on the artist the exceeding value of the charming and graceful \"bits\" he will continually encounter on the banks of the Thames.\n\nTHE CARP\n\nWhile revelling among historic sites, and enjoying the rare banquet of foliage, of which Father Thames is so profusely lavish \"hereabouts\", we may not, however, forget that we have yet much to say of the fish that abound in his waters. The Carp and Tench are of his produce, although they are not found in quantities sufficient to tempt the angler, and do not often come to his bait. We describe them nevertheless, for they belong to our river. The common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) inhabits most of the ponds, lakes, and rivers of England, always preferring muddy to clear bottoms; it is very tenacious of life, and grows to an enormous size, sometimes weighing between fifteen and twenty pounds. The mouth is small, and has \"no apparent teeth\"; the body is covered with large scales; the general colour is a golden-olive brown, \"head darkest\"; the fins dark brown; the belly a yellowish white. In the \"Boke of St. Albans\", by Dame Juliana Berners, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1496, the carp is mentioned as a \"deyntous fisshe\"; and in the privy purse expenses of Henry VIII., in 1582, various entries are made of rewards to persons for bringing \"carpes to the king\". It is, however, not a native, although the period of its introduction to England is not ascertained. The Prussian carp is much smaller than the common carp. The carp with which we are most familiar is the \"golden carp\"; of late years it has become, so to speak, domesticated, and adds essentially to our home enjoyments in vases and drawing-room tanks, where it is usually associated with minnows and other \"small fry\" of the river being kept in health by water plants, which grow freely in comparative confinement. The date of the first introduction of \"gold and silver fish\" into England is \"differently stated by authors\", as 1611, 1691, and 1728. Yarrell does not attempt to fix the period. There is no doubt that they were first imported from China. In Portugal, and, indeed, elsewhere, they are completely naturalised, inhabiting many of the streams and rivers; it is probable they will be so ere long in England, for they breed freely in many of our ponds, and seem to require no especial care, either in winter or summer.\n\n\"The extreme elegance of the form of the golden carp, the splendour of their scaly covering, the ease and agility of their movements, and the facility with which they are kept alive in small vessels, place them among the most pleasing and desirable of our pets.\"\n\nThey become remarkably tame, frequently taking food from the hand, and appearing to distinguish clearly between an acquaintance and a stranger.\n\nTENCH\n\nTENCH\n\nThe Tench (Tinea vulgaris) differs essentially in character from the carp, although its habits are similar, frequenting the same localities, and delighting in muddy bottoms; its origin is also foreign; and it is exceedingly tenacious of life. The scales of the tench are small; the head is rather large and \"blunt\"; the general colour of the body is a greenish-olive gold, \"lightest along the whole line of the under surface; the fins darker brown\";\n\nit grows sometimes to a large size, not unfrequently weighing from five to seven pounds. The angler finds it very difficult to make prey of this fish; they are usually shy, and \"take to the mud\" when alarmed; occasionally they bite freely, we have ourselves taken out of a pond five or six dozen in a day, each of the average weight of three pounds; finding on that occasion a small pellet of new bread the most effective bait. Yarrell, however, states that\n\n\"the best bait for them is the dark red meadow worm\",\n\nand that the time when they are most readily taken is '\"early morning\". They are not numerous in the Thames, and are there never fished for expressly, although every now and then one will make acquaintance with an angler's hook. The Thames, however, as we have often said, has other fish besides the carp and tench to tempt the brethren of the gentle craft.\n\nTHE BOUNDARY STONE WTSWG\n\nTHE BOUNDARY STONE\n\nWe are now approaching the ancient town of Staines;  its bridge and its church steeple are in sight; but before we reach them there is an object standing on one of the aits that claims our especial attention. We must step ashore to examine it, for it is the Boundary Stone of the City of London; and here its jurisdiction ends  or did end, we should rather say, for by a recent enactment all its rights and privileges, as regard the river Thames, were transferred to \"a Commission\".\n\nThe conservancy of the river Thames was vested in the Lord Mayor and Corporation of the City of London by long prescription, confirmed by various charters and acts of parliament. Apart from the Courts of Conservancy, which were held by the Lord Mayor in person, attended by the Recorder and other officers, with much state, most of the administrative duties of Conservator of the Thames have long been performed by a committee of the corporation, known as the \"Navigation and Port of London Committee\", consisting of twelve Aldermen and twenty-nine Common Councilmen. Their jurisdiction extended from Staines, in Middlesex, to Yantlet, in Kent. Their duties were to prevent encroachments on the bed and soil of the river, or anything being done on its banks to impede navigation; to regulate the moorings of vessels in the port, deepen the channel, erect and maintain public stairs, keep in repair the locks, weirs, and towing paths, regulate the fisheries, and seize unlawful nets, &c. In the performance of these duties they were aided by four harbour-masters, an engineer, water-bailiff, and other officials appointed by the corporation.\n\nThe revenue arose principally from two sources, viz. the tonnage dues on ships frequenting the port, and the tolls paid by vessels passing through the locks, or using the landing-piers. The corporation also received, not as conservators of the river, but as owners of its bed and soil, rents for wharfs, piers, and landing-places, which they granted licences to erect. The produce of the tonnage dues was about £18,000 per annum  a sum more than sufficient to cover the expenses charged upon them, as the corporation were in possession of a surplus of about £90,000; but as the application of these dues was, by act of parliament, strictly limited to the river below London Bridge, no benefit could be derived from the possession of such surplus to the upper portion of the river, where the amount received from tolls was small, and, in consequence of the great competition of the railways with the carrying trade of the river, had latterly become so much diminished as to fall far short of the annual expense.\n\nNotwithstanding the difficulty in which the corporation were placed, with a surplus below bridge, which they were unable to appropriate, and a deficiency above bridge, which they had no means of making good but by pledging their corporate estates  they have shown no hesitation in the performance of the duty cast upon them. Meanwhile circumstances had arisen to prevent that efficient management of the Thames which it has ever been the constant object of the corporation to secure. A claim was set up by the crown to the bed and soil of the river. The right to the conservancy of the Thames had been contested in the time of Queen Elizabeth, by the then Lord High Admiral, and decided in favour of the city; but the right to the bed and soil of the sea-shore, and of navigable rivers, between high and low-water mark, is comparatively a recent claim on the part of the crown. A bill was filed against the corporation to enforce this claim, and requiring them to show their title; and after protracted proceedings, extending over a period of thirteen years, a compromise was effected. The city, with a view to the interests of the public, consented to acknowdedge the title of the crown to the bed and soil of the river, and the crown consented to grant a title to the corporation, stipulating, at the same time, that a scheme, suggested by Government for the future management of the river, should be adopted and embodied in an act of parliament, which act has recently come into operation.\n\nThe Thames Conservancy Act, 1857, placed the authority over the river Thames  within the limits of the ancient jurisdiction of the city  in a board consisting of twelve persons, viz. the Lord Mayor for the time being, two Aldermen, and four Common Councilmen, elected by the Court of Common Council, the Deputy-master of the Trinity House, two persons chosen by the Admiralty, one by the Board of Trade, and one by the Trinity House. The members are severally to remain in office for five years, unless otherwise removed, and are eligible for re-election. The revenue arising from the tonnage dues below bridge, and the tolls and other receipts above bridge, together, form one fund for the management and improvement of the navigation of the river; and of the receipts arising from embankments, or other appropriation of the bed and soil, one-third is paid to the crown, and the remaining two-thirds added to the general fund above mentioned.\n\nThus was almost regal authority, enjoyed for ages by the citizens of London, and exercised by their chief magistrate and corporation in a spirit of munificent liberality that did honour to their administration, quietly supplanted and absorbed by the greater power of the crown. Our hope is, that public interest may not suffer by the change. Those who have visited the Thames above \"the city stone\" cannot fail to lament that the whole of the river has not been under their jurisdiction: between Staines and London all matters have been admirably and liberally managed; from Staines upwards they have been shamefully neglected. There are numerous \"Boards of Conservancy\" from Cricklade downwards, not one of which seems to have the least idea of cleansing the river, repairing its banks, or facilitating its navigation and traffic. If we are to judge of other \"reforms\" which the corporation of the metropolis is doomed to undergo by this reformation of the conservancy of the Thames, we fear we may not anticipate a change that will be advantageous.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the \"improving\" spirit of the age will not proceed so far as to remove this ancient boundary mark; but that the inscription it still retains  \"God preserve the City of London\"  will be uttered as a fervent prayer by generations yet to come: for, of a truth, upon the prosperity of the metropolis of England depends the welfare of the kingdom.\n\nSTAINES\n\nStaines  or, as it is written in old records, Stanes  is on the Middlesex side of the river,  a busy and populous town, with a venerable and picturesque church.\n\nSTAINES BRIDGE WTSWG\n\nSTAINES BRIDGE\n\nA handsome bridge connects it with the county of Su"
