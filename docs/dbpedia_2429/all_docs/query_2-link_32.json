        "text": "A guide to Ordnance Survey maps as historical sources: 1. the one-inch to the mile maps of England and Wales\n\nHarley, J.B.\n\npp 130-140\n\nThe first in a series of four articles, this article is by one of the leading cartographic historians of the 20th century. In this article Harley comments in detail, with key diagrams, on the one-inch Ordnance Survey map series and its significance to the local historian. The first survey of 1791 was not published until 1801 and the remainder followed during the 19th century. Harley also discusses the original surveyors' drawings, which in some cases show considerable amounts of detail which was omitted from the published maps. In 1840 a six-inch survey was started, and the later one-inch sheets (particularly those for the six northern counties) were reduced from this larger-scale survey. During the later 19th century and early 20th century further printings were made from the original plates, but with some updating such as the inclusion of new railways. The article discusses how these later impressions or editions may be identified. They include the second edition, published from 1872 onwards as a reduction of six-inch surveys and including experiments with colour printing; the third and fourth editions, for which new surveys were started in 1901 and 1924, and including the first 'tourist' maps in 1938; and recent editions, including those for wartime (1939-1945) (see also 05 07 202-211; 05 08 251-259)."
