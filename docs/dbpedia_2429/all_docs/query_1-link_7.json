        "text": "The ever-expanding Lawrence literature overlooks the link between his concept of warfare and subsequent choice of the RAF for enlistment. Lawrence's fame stemmed from the cultural difference between Romantic heroism in the desert and the industrial warfare on the Western Front. Yet pare away the myth and enigma of 'Lawrence of Arabia' using the official archives and one finds a proponent of air power and a strikingly modern way in warfare, using machines rather than men, and combining aeroplanes and armoured cars with Arab regulars and irregulars. The experience resulted in Lawrence's subsequent postwar support of air power for colonial control in Iraq and probably influenced his choice of Service for enlistment.\n\nAs a personality, Thomas Edward Lawrence – born in Wales in 1888, the second son of an aristocrat and his daughters’ governess, and later known as Lawrence of Arabia – seems to have stepped straight out of the imaginative world of Nietzsche. With the benefit of hindsight, there is something superhuman about his character. Yet tempting as it is – a temptation illustrated by the countless biographies and popular portrayals in existence – it seems almost impossible to reduce his character to one simple denominator. However, more than almost anyone else, Lawrence embodies the transformation from hero to anti hero that shaped literature in the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1923, almost two decades before the formation of its Second World War Special Duties (SD) squadrons, the RAF created a 'special force' of airmen who conducted highly unorthodox small-scale operations. Like all Special Forces operations, the tactical-level actions by these airmen generated operational level and strategic effects in uncertainb, often hostile, and politically sensitive regions. Between the World Wars, these special airmen, the RAF Special Service Officers, integrated air, civil, and social actions to ensure peace and stability on the frontiers of the empire and, in the process, helped to preserve the independence of the Royal Air Force."
