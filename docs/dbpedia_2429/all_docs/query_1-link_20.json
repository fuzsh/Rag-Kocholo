        "text": "The Left Flank Company, 5th Battalion (SR) Scots Guards\n\nNote: the ranks listed below would appear to be the ranks the Officers, NCO’s and men held prior to their being selected for the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards. With the exception of the Officers holding command positions in the 5th Battalion, their actual ranks within the Left Flank Company are unknown.\n\nThis detail is included to give as much of an idea as possible as to the men that made up a Battalion that had volunteered to be flung into a remote war in a little known area of the world, in unfamiliar terrain and against a formidable enemy..... All the information in this Post is historically accurate BTW, nothing altered. I really wanted to get the flavour of these men as much as possible and convey this before I started on what could have happened if they had made it to Finland.\n\nCompany Commander: Major C J Stone: East Surrey Regiment: covered earlier.\n\nCompany Headquarters\n\nCapt. The Hon. J L Lindsay: 2nd Bat, Queen Victoria’s Rifles\n\nWhat little is available on Capt. The Hon. J L Lindsay are a series of notices in the London Gazette, starting with THE LONDON GAZETTE, 8 JANUARY, 1937, Territorial Army, advising that 2nd Lt. Hon. J. L. Lindsay is transferring from the 22nd (Lond.) Armd. Car Co., to be 2nd Lt. with the Scouts – Scottish Horse, from l0th Dec. 1936. From this and a subsequent notice in THE LONDON GAZETTE, 22 FEBRUARY, 1938 TERRITORIAL ARMY. SCOUTS. Scottish Horse—advising that 2nd Lt. Hon. J. L. Lindsay to be Lt. 20th Feb. 1938, one surmises that Lindsay was a Territorial Army officer in the Scottish Horse (a Yeomanry Regiment of the British Territorial Army from 1900 to 1956). Between Feb 1938 and June 1944, no information is available but one surmises that at some stage he had transferred to Queen Victoria’s Rifles (at the outbreak of World War II, 1/QVR and 2/QVR were formally made part of the KRRC (King’s Royal Rifle Corps).\n\nIn the SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 27 JUNE, 1944, it is advised that K.R.R.C. (King’s Royal Rifle Corps) Capt. The Hon. J. L. Lindsay (64126) is placed on the h.p. list on account of il-health, 26th June 1944. Subsequently, in the SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 24 APRIL, 1945 - Memorandum. Capt. The Hon. J. L. Lindsay (64126) h.p. list (late K.R.R.C.) relinquishes his commn. on account of disability, 25th Apr. 1945, and is granted the hon. rank of Maj.\n\nSection Sgt-Major P H Thompson: 449 Company: (no information found)\n\n2Lt G M Jackson: 2/5th Essex Regiment(?)\n\nGeorge Michael Jackson had served as a soldier in the Household Cavalry before being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant near the start of WW2. His son, General Sir Michael David \"Mike\" Jackson, GCB, CBE, DSO, DL (born 21 March 1944) became one of the British Army’s most high-profile generals since the Second World War, serving for three years as Commander-in-Chief, Land Forces and then as Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the professional head of the British Army, in 2003. In his biography, “Soldier” by General Sir Mike Jackson, he says of his father: “My father George Jackson served in the Army for forty years, without ever rising beyond the modest rank of major. He suffered a serious heart attack in the early 1950s and that put the kibosh on any further promotion. The Army was pretty ruthless about such matters then. My father never showed any resentment at this setback. If it ever went through his mind that he might leave the Army, he never mentioned it to me. He was a great gentleman, very courteous, and scrupulously honest; a delightful man, who always had a wry smile on his lips, perhaps indicative of his humorous attitude to life. I liked him and I respected him; to me he was always ‘Pop’. Pop was a tall, lean, dark man with a long nose, all features which he handed on to me. He sported a neatly trimmed moustache, a practice I have not emulated! Pop was an active and practical man, who’d been a member of the Boys’ Brigade and who was very fond of playing football. In adulthood he became a keen motorcyclist. Mother (Ivy, (née Bower, who was a curator at a museum in Sheffield) was dark too, slight but none the less forceful, a strong, bright-eyed Yorkshire woman, who had been quite a beauty in her youth. She loved walking, and in her teens had done a great deal of hiking in the Peak District.\n\nMy father joined the Army in 1935 as a private soldier, becoming a trooper in the Household Cavalry. I can remember his telling me about being a member of the Sovereign’s Escort at the coronation of King George VI, which sounded very impressive to a young boy. He didn’t make the big leap to commissioned rank until about halfway through the Second World War, when he became an officer in the Royal Army Service Corps. I suspect that my parents waited until my father was commissioned to get married.\n\nGeorge was the youngest of five children of Charles Henry Jackson, the skipper of a deep-sea line-fishing vessel working out of Grimsby. My grandfather, whom I sadly never knew, had lost his father when he was only four and, having been sent to work on a Lincolnshire farm at the age of ten, had run away to sea in his late teens. The life of a long-line fisherman then was very hard, sailing small vessels up to Iceland and along the Greenland coast even in winter, often under brutal masters and in cruel conditions, defying icebergs and heavy seas in the search for cod and halibut up to 20 stone in weight. Such a harsh life left him unmarked, however, for Pop said that no family ever had a better father. My grandfather was patient, loving and fair; everyone who knew Charles Jackson respected him and his word, and looked upon him as a gentleman. In the First World War he served as a master of a minesweeper. In the Second World War, though by then well into his sixties, he again volunteered for service with the Royal Navy and was made master of a small vessel working out of Scapa Flow.\n\nMy parents must have met during the early part of the war when both were in their mid-twenties, though unfortunately I know almost nothing about the circumstances beyond the fact that Pop was then living in Bristol, and since my mother’s death late in 2006 there is now no one left alive to tell me. My mother Ivy was from Sheffield, where her father, Tom Bower, had been an engineer in the steel industry who had lost his job in the Depression. She was a year older than my father, born five months before the outbreak of the First World War, and the only child of her parents, which was unusual for the period. (Her own mother had been one of eleven siblings.) An intelligent girl, she won a scholarship to Sheffield Grammar School, and when she met my father she was working as a curator at the Sheffield Museum.\n\nAlong with so many British soldiers, my father spent the early part of the war kicking his heels. He and my mother married on 7 March 1942, soon after he received his commission (see additional note below – this was actually his promotion from 2Lt to Lt). I was born two years later, at my mother’s home in Sheffield, just ten weeks before my father finally went into action on D-Day, 6 June 1944. He was second-in-command of a squadron of amphibious vehicles (DUKWs) whose function was to ferry men and materiel ashore. His squadron commander was killed on the first run in to ‘Gold’ Beach, so my father had to take command from then on. For him, as for so many others, D-Day was a baptism of fire. For his actions then and subsequently he was awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre and was mentioned in dispatches. Like so many of his generation, he was reluctant to talk about his experiences and, judging that it would make him uncomfortable, I didn’t seek to push him to do so.\n\nI don’t know much about what Pop did for the rest of the war except that he took part in the Allied advance through north-west Europe, finishing up on VE-Day in Germany. After the war he was posted to Palestine, in the Mandate days, before the creation of the State of Israel. British soldiers were trying to keep the peace between Arabs and Jews, and might be attacked by either; it was no place for wives and children. So my early years were spent in Sheffield with my mother’s family, and then in Aldershot when Pop came back from Palestine. In 1948 he was posted to Libya, an Italian colony which had been occupied by the British during the war, and which would become an independent kingdom in late 1951. My first memory is of sailing out by troop-ship with my mother to join him.”\n\nAfter the Second World War, George Jackson was eventually posted to Tripoli, Libya, where the family lived for two years, during which time Michael’s younger sister was born. After suffering a heart attack, George Jackson retired with the rank of major after 40 years in the Army. Delving into the London Gazette, it would appear that Mike Jackson missed a couple of things about his father – his commission in 1942 was in point of fact a promotion from 2Lt to Lt – as per the SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 13 MARCH, 1942 advising that George Michael JACKSON (226972) was promoted from 2Lt to Lt. on 21st Feb. 1942. From this and a post-war SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 18 APRIL, 1947, advising that 2nd Lt. (War Subs. Capt.) George Michael JACKSON (226972) from Emerg. Commn. to be Lt., 9th Nov. 1946, with seniority, 9th May, 194O. (Substituted for the notifn. in Gazette (Supplement) dated 8th Nov. 1946.) one can conclude that Jackson had been commissioned as a 2nd Lt early in the war, where it would seem that he volunteered for the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards.\n\nA SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 3 DECEMBER, 1946 advises that “The undermentioned Lts. to be Capts. 9th Nov. 1946, with seniority 1st July 1946: — (War Subs. Capt.) G. M. JACKSON (226972). A SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE of 13 APRIL, 1948 advised that on 9th Nov 1946 — (War Subs Capt ) G M JACKSON (226972), with seniority 9th May 1945 (Substituted for the notifn. in Gazette (Supplement) dated 3rd Dec 1946). Subsequently THE -LONDON GAZETTE, 16 May 1950 advises that Capt. G. M. JACKSON (226972) to be Maj., llth May 1950. THE -LONDON GAZETTE, 15 FEBRUARY, 1952 advises that Major George Michael JACKSON (226972), Royal Army Service Corps has been awarded the (Belgian) Croix Militaire 1st Class. In the SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE of 23RD MAY 1961, for the ROYAL ARMY SERVICE CORPSCapt. G. M. JACKSON (226972) to be Maj., llth May 1950, with seniority 12th June 1951. (Substituted for the notifn. in Gazette (Supplement) dated 19th May 1950.). And finally, a SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 12™ MAY 1970 advises that Maj. G. M. JACKSON (226972) retires on retired pay, llth May 1970.\n\nLCpl W A Challington: Cameron Highlanders\n\nAfter his time in the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards, William Albert Challington (3515161) would go on to join the Commandoes. He was awarded a DCM for the raid on St Nazaire, where he was a Sgt in 2 Commando. He was captured in the aftermath of the raid and would remain a POW for the remainder of WW2.\n\n“On 28th March 1942 during the Commando Raid on St.Nazaire,France Sgt Challington was with the assault group covering the dry dock area. Disembarking from the burning bows of HMS Campbeltown on to the dock gates, Sgt Challington immediately engaged the enemy gun crews.who were on the roof of the pumping station and whose plunging fire was intense in the immediate area. Under his devastating covering fire, the assault onto the roof of the pumping station and the consequent destruction of the crews and guns was successfully completed. Later, when his assault group formed a covering force in the area which the demolitions were taking place, this NCO showing total disregard for his own safety, engaged and knocked out an enemy machine gun position which was bringing heavy fire to bear on the Operational HQ. Continuing to display great courage and initiative, his group later became engaged in the street fighting in the town of St.Nazaire and during the fighting he alone engaged an enemy motorcycle combination which approached at high speed firing an automatic gun from the sidecar. Durirng this street fighting, this NCO's dash and initiative was outstanding and with a small party he managed to regain the open country through the town in an attempt to escape to Spain. He was captured only after organising other members of his party to set off in pairs to freedom.”\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.commandoveterans.org/cdoGall ... +1941a.jpg\n\n1.

G. R. G. Bird to be Lt. 29th Aug. 1932. In the inter-war period, promotion from 2nd Lt to Lt usually took some years and from this (and his approximate retirement date) we can surmise that Bird joined The Sherwood Foresters as a 2nd Lt around the mid-1920’s. The only reference to Bird during the war years is a reference to Capt. G. R. G. Bird, Foresters (s.c.) Capt. (actg. 17/10/41). By 1947, we know that G R G Bird was a Lieutenant-Colonel, by way of his authorship of a 1947 paper listed as “Tobruk: account of operations of 1st Battalion the Sherwood Foresters 1942 June 1-21, by Lieutenant-Colonel G. R. G. Bird.”\n\nIn the SUPPLEMENT TO THE LONDON GAZETTE, 2 JUNE, 1953 Maj. & Bt. Lt.-Col. G. R. G. BIRD (44029) from Foresters, to be Lt.-Col. on the Employed List (1), 9th Sept. 1952.

Crosthwaite Eyre (134990) is a 2nd Lt. and is transferred to the Intelligence Corps as 2nd Lt, retaining present seniority as of 15 July 1940. The London Gazette of 20 June 1941 advises that 2nd Lt. J.

On 27th October 1941 the Battalion moved to Liverpool and embarked for Singapore on the SS Reina Del Pacifico, with their transport on SS \"Bonnikom\". Captain H L Hoppe commanded \"B\" Company. The 5th Battalion landed on Singapore Island on 29th January 1942 and were taken prisoner at the surrender of Singapore on 15th February 1942, just 17 days after their arrival. They landed without equipment and had been trained in warfare against the German Army in Europe. They had never trained in jungle warfare, were not acclimatized and had never seen a Japanese soldier nor knew what they were capable of both as an enemy at war and as captors.\n\nUpon capture the 5th Battalion was split into small groups over five days and communication between groups became next to impossible. From the Battalion six officers and twenty-six men were killed and many more wounded. They suffered three and a half years of captivity where a third of the soldiers died from over-work, sickness and starvation. Captain Hoppe was one of the survivors. The London Gazette of 12 July 1955 advises that Lt. (Hon. Capt.) H. L.

And believe me, I won't be going to this level of detail for any other units - just, I got really interested in these guys.

One mention of him alludes that “Sandy was a famous hurdle race amateur jockey” – (that’s actually a steeplechase rider – this and the fact that he was a pre-war officer in the 4th CLY which had high mess bills, indicates he was reasonably well-off). Limited mentions of him include that on 10 Sept 1939, the 4th County of London Yeomanry War Diary records that at 1103 a Convoy of 3 trucks under 2Lt Scratchley left for MINEHEAD. On 11 Nov 1939, 2Lt AJ Scratchley was Gazetted with effect 22 Sept 39. He volunteered for the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards and served in Finland with the battalion for the duration of the Winter War. On his return, he was posted to the Special Training Centre, Inverness, following which he rejoined the 4th County of London Yeomanry Regt. Temporarily. He was a member of L Detachment SAS in 1942 and 1 SAS (A Squadron) from 1942-43 with the rank of Lt. He was a member of 2 SAS (A and HQ Squadrons) over 1943-44 where he was promoted to Captain and then to Major.\n\nThe London Gazette of 1 August 1944 records that Lt. A. J. Scratchley of the SAS, from 4th Co. of Lon. Yeo., to be War Subs. Lt., 1st Apr. 1944, retaining his present seniority. On 4 May 1944, Capt. A J Scratchley of the Royal Armoured Corps was awarded the Military Cross for action in Italy. He was also awarded the D.S.O, Mentioned in Despatches and received a bar to his M.C. He seems to have been fairly well known – numerous accounts of the SAS or memoirs or interviews of SAS members such as Carol Mathers mention Scratchley.

As a boy he boxed, fenced and swam with marked success, riding in the winter-time; then, well equipped for an Army career, he sat the Sandhurst examination and passed high in the list. Displaying a characteristic enthusiasm and cheerfulness, Bill entered wholeheartedly into both military and sporting activities at Sandhurst, winning the Modern Pentathalon. He went on holiday in Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia with three other cadets, where they were temporarily arrested in Zagreb for spying - an event which Bill regarded with glee. In 1935 he was commissioned into the 2nd Northumberland Fusiliers, who were still using horse transport, and he found himself very much at home in the stables. His sporting activities led him to be selected and to train for the British Olympic squad, due to go to Berlin in 1936, but appendicitis put him out of the team.\n\nWhile convalescing in Cornwall, he met a number of artists and writers, discovering a strong empathy with them, which he was to develop later on. Then, on holiday in Florence, where he had been guided by some of his new friends, Bill met Barbara Tatham, his future wife. That year, he learned to fly a BA Swallow aircraft. He became engaged to, and then married Barbara. Shortly after the Munich crisis, the Collingwoods moved – typical of Bill's sense of humour - to a new address at Collingwood Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle. When war broke out, he instantly volunteered for the 'sharp end', the “5th Battalion, Scots Guards”, the cover name for a ski battalion of volunteers intended for service in Finland against the Russians. After training with the Chasseurs Alpins in Chamonix, the battalion embarked for Finland.\n\nAfter returning from Finland in late 1940, there followed a period of flying experience, appointment as Adjutant at the Depot, and several courses including the Staff College at Camberley. Bill was appointed Brigade Major of a tank brigade, but when its role was changed to training, he volunteered for the Parachute Regiment. After a short spell as a company commander in 7 PARA, and then completing his parachute course at Ringway, Bill joined that remarkable 3rd Parachute Brigade team: James Hill the Brigade Commander, Alec Pope the DAA & QMG and Bill the Brigade Major. A private soldier from 9 PARA, temporarily posted to 3 Brigade defence platoon, remembers Bill at the time: 'He always had a smile and a cheery word for all of us. He was a lovely officer!'\n\nOn the night of 5 June 1944, Bill left in an Albermarle aircraft with the Pathfinders, having selected the Brigade DZ himself from air photographs. The pilot, a Charterhouse contemporary, could not find the DZ at all, and had to make five circuits of the area. Bill was on the edge of the hole ready to jump, when a near miss with another aircraft and then an AA shell-burst close to the fuselage toppled him out. But somehow his foot had got caught and he hung by one leg under aircraft for an agonising ¾’s of an hour, wafting in and out of consciousness, until his batman, Pte Allen, and the rest of the stick who had been unable to jump, hauled him in. Among all the dashing parachuting stories, this is a perfectly true one! Major Napier Crookenden, Bill's opposite number as Brigade Major of the Airlanding (Gliders) Brigade, was eating eggs and bacon in the RAF mess, Brize Norton at 3.30 that afternoon, preparatory to flying over to join the 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades, when in came a battered figure, his face still covered with camouflage cream, wearing his smock and limping badly. It was Bill, followed closely by his stick. “Can you give us a lift to Normandy?” he asked, and was at once provided with a spare glider. By 9.30 that evening, Bill was in position at 3 Para. Brigade HQ in Le Mesnil, having come in to Ranville with the 6th Airlanding Brigade, as his second attempt to land in Normandy within 24 hours. Few can claim this double assault on Hitler's 'Western Wall'!\n\nBill showed great endurance by carrying on with his key role, despite injuries, often under heavy fire and not helped by a wound in his backside, until eventually he had to submit to being evacuated. Graded Category B, he recovered enough to become Chief Instructor at the School of Land/Air Warfare in Old Sarum, which he knew from a previous course there, and it was possible for Barbara to be with him again. So ended the brief war experience of a first rate Regular officer, typical of so many men, full of energy and enterprise and of complete devotion to duty who laid the foundations of the young Airborne Forces. When the war was over Bill, now A.l fit, went to India as GSO 1 of the Indian Airborne Division but very nearly died of meningitis. Barbara was sent for, came out and remained with him when he had again recovered. They spent memorable leaves together in Goa and Kashmir and thereafter were seldom separated. Regimental duty with his own Royal Northumberland Fusiliers followed in Gibraltar, then Warminster, on the directing staff at Camberley, on the Suez Canal, CO of 1RNF in Northern Ireland, then still a land at peace.\n\nBill commanded the Old College at Sandhurst, taught naval history and had a hand in the beginning of the “Edward Bear” parachute exercises, whose brand of quirkiness on the whole appealed to him. He also helped organise the World Modern Pentathalon Championship, based on Sandhurst and, for the two years he was there, his gentle kindness and consideration for the cadets created its own form of discipline. Bill's Army career ended as Commander of 151 TA (Territorial Army) Brigade in Durham and North Yorkshire, where he continued to hunt and to ride point to points. He retired from the Army in 1962.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.durhamrecordoffice.org.uk/Ca ... 4_0102.jpg\n\nNewspaper cutting, from the Newcastle Journal , including a photograph of Sir James Duff, the Mayor of Durham, with Brigadier W.A.C. Collingwood, Commanding 151st Brigade, centre, and Colonel A. de V. Gibson, Commanding 8th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, in Durham, 14 March 1960\n\nIn 1962, Collingwood was made Regional Officer of the Independent Television Authority in the South West & the Channel Islands, where he was to indulge his fondness for sailing. His grasp of the job, personality and his way with people all made him a popular figure. Three years later, he returned to his beloved South West and in 1977 came his retirement from the IBA. He and his wide settled in a house on the Devon side of the Tamar river at Bere Alston. His own description 'We made a garden' is inadequate to express what he created at several levels on the site of a fifteenth century silver smelting works, with exotic plants, goldfish pool, lawns and trees, He also converted 'the barn' into a fully equipped hall where art exhibitions attracted visitors from near and far, and where he was planning to promote concerts\n\nBill Collingwood died suddenly at home on Christmas Eve 1992 among his family, so further diminishing that 'band of brothers' which was the 6th Airborne Division. He left his wife Barbara, four children, 12 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren, as well as very many friends and old comrades, all sadder for the loss of a marvellous companion, player of games and of tricks, a man whose very presence lit up the company he kept.\n\n2nd Lt P V Cowley\n\nThe London Gazette of 28 January 1941 advises that P V Cowley (74603) is promoted from 2nd Lt. to Lt as of the 1st of January 1941 (Royal Northumberland Fusiliers).

I’ve included it here both as a historical record (believe me, it took a long time to collect and collate all this information and put it together – and it’s nowhere near complete – and I owe a huge debt of thanks to those who have helped me, most notably Chris Rooney, whose father, Oswald Basil Rooney, was in the 5th Battalion and who has been an invaluable source for original photos from his father’s collection as well as source documents and information on some of the members of the Battalion. Thx Chris!!!!).\n\nAnd on a serious note, if anyone can add to this information, please post it here or inbox me – I’m working on a Wikipedia article on the Battalion and any and all information, even if it’s a single reference, is invaluable for this kind of thing.\n\nCyclops Bradley:\n\nNo information found other than a brief mention that it is thought that Cyclops Bradley went on to the Small Scale Raiding Force.\n\nJames Michael Calvert\n\nJames Michael Calvert (6 March 1913 – 26 November 1998) born at Rohtak in India, son of a member of the Indian Civil Service. He was educated at Bradfield College and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1933, and for a time was the Army's middleweight boxing champion as well as playing water polo and swimming for the army.. He read for the Mechanical Engineering Tripos at St. John's College, Cambridge. After graduating in 1936, he was appointed to the Hong Kong Royal Engineers. In this post, he learned Cantonese. He also witnessed the Japanese attack on Shanghai and the Rape of Nanking, which made him one of the few officers who truly appreciated the potential threat posed by the Japanese. When WW2 broke out, Calvert volunteered for the 5th Battalion Scots Guards and service in Finland.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://frogenyozurt.com/wp-content/uplo ... alvert.jpg\n\nBrigader James Michael “Mad Mike” Calvert\n\nSomewhat of an expert with explosives, he gained a great deal more practical experience in Finland as he participated in the demolition of numerous Red Army supply dumps and odd pieces of infrastructure such as bridges. After the Battalion returned from Finland, he went on to train Commando detachments in demolition techniques in Hong Kong and Australia. In Australia, along with F. Spencer Chapman, he assisted with training Australian commandos who formed the first Australian Army Independent Companies at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria in 1941. He was then appointed to command the Bush Warfare School in Burma, training officers and NCOs to lead guerilla bands in China for operations against the Japanese. The Japanese invaded Burma in early 1942. Calvert and others from the school raided Henzada by riverboat after the fall of Rangoon as a deception operation to convince the Japanese that Australian reinforcements had reached Burma. Calvert then spent a period of time touring Burma with Orde Wingate. After the Bush Warfare School closed, Calvert was sent with 22 men from the school and a few hundred men separated from their units to guard the Gokteik Viaduct thirty miles east of Maymyo. (The Allied Commander in Chief, General Archibald Wavell apparently hoped that Calvert would use his initiative and demolish it, in spite of orders from the civil government to keep it intact. For once, Calvert obeyed orders). After retreating from the viaduct, Calvert's unit finally retreated to India at the very rear of the army, often behind the Japanese lines.\n\nIn India, he reunited with Wingate, and the two became firm friends. Calvert led one of the company-sized columns in Operation Longcloth, Wingate's first Chindit operation in 1943. This was a long-range penetration operation behind enemy lines, which put great demands on the endurance of all who took part. Calvert was awarded the DSO for his achievements on the operation. Calvert next commanded 77th Indian Infantry Brigade in 1944 in Operation Thursday, the much larger second Chindit operation. His brigade spearheaded the airborne landings deep in the Japanese rear. In May, the Chindit brigades moved north. The monsoon had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations. In June 1944, Calvert's brigade was ordered by the American General Joseph Stilwell to capture the town of Mogaung. Although his men were greatly weakened by shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease, he succeeded in doing so against desperate Japanese defenders, by the end of the month. His brigade had suffered 800 battle casualties in the siege; half of its strength. Of the remainder, only 300 men were left fit to fight.\n\nOn receiving orders to move to Myitkyina, where another Japanese garrison was holding out, he closed down his Brigade's radio sets and marched to Stilwell's army's headquarters in Kamaing instead. A court martial was threatened, but after he and Stilwell finally met in person and Stilwell appreciated for the first time the conditions under which the Chindits had operated, 77th Brigade was evacuated to India to recover. Calvert was awarded a bar to the DSO for the second Chindit expedition. In the field Calvert was \"clearly the most successful and aggressive Chindit commander,\" and a font of \"positive leadership\" throughout the campaign. He frequently led risky attacks from the front, a practice that earned him the nickname \"Mad Mike.\" Calvert was then evacuated to Britain on medical grounds (ironically following an accidental injury) in September 1944. In March 1945 he was appointed to command the Special Air Service Brigade and held this appointment until the Brigade was disbanded in October 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he attended the Army's Staff College. After passing the course, he was appointed to a staff post as Lieutenant Colonel in the Allied Military Government in Trieste. During the Malayan Emergency the British Army experienced the rebirth of the SAS. Disbanded shortly after the end of the Second World War, the specialists of the SAS returned in 1950 when General Sir John Harding, Commander-in-Chief Far East, decided that he needed independent advice from an expert in jungle warfare. He called for Calvert, who he knew had had considerable experience of jungle warfare in Burma. Calvert had also been one of the prime movers in ensuring the SAS ethic had not died out at the end of the war. The Malayan Scouts were an early unit that contributed to the resurrection of the SAS. Calvert was selected in 1950 to command the Malayan Scouts (SAS) engaged in operations against Communist insurgents in Malaya. Although he held the local rank of Brigadier, he nevertheless led several patrols and operations in person. However, the Malayan Scouts were not subject to proper selection procedures and never lost an early reputation for poor discipline. Calvert's exertions meant that he was invalided home in 1951.\n\nCalvert reverted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, and was posted to the British Army of the Rhine. While there, he was accused of an act of indecency, court-martialled and forced to leave the Army under a cloud. He was also prone to alcoholism by this point in this life. He several times tried to rebuild a career as an engineer, in Australia and Britain. Following his dismissal, Calvert wrote three books about his time in Burma with Wingate and the Chindits: Prisoners of Hope, Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War, and Chindits: Long Range Penetration. Calvert also contributed to acclaimed British documentary television series, The World at War. He died impoverished and an alcoholic in 1998.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.farsettingsun.co.uk/Gallery_ ... age008.jpg\n\nBrigadier Mike Calvert in action, Burma 1944:\n\nImage sourced from: http://cf.mp-cdn.net/97/ea/03c9aad1dd3b ... 0630ec.jpg\n\nChindits: Long Range Penetration, written by Mike Calvert for the Ballentines History of the Second World War series\n\nFrederick Spencer Chapman\n\nLieutenant Colonel Frederick Spencer Chapman, DSO & Bar, ED (10 May 1907 – 8 August 1971) was a British Army officer and World War II veteran, most famous for his exploits behind enemy lines in Japanese occupied Malaya. His medals include the following: The Arctic Medal, Gill Memorial Medal, Mungo Park Medal, and the Lawrence of Arabia Memorial Medal. Chapman's mother, Winifred Ormond, died shortly after his birth in London. His father, Frank Spencer Chapman, was killed at the Battle of Ypres. Freddie (or sometimes Freddy as he was to become known) and his older brother, Robert, were cared for by an elderly clergyman and his wife in the village of Cartmel, on the edge the Lake District. He was schooled at Sedbergh School before studying at Cambridge.\n\nChapman was joined Gino Watkins' 1930-31 British Arctic Air-Route Expedition and a subsequent Greenland Expedition in 1932–33 as the \"ski expert and naturalist\". In these expeditions he experienced cold of such intensity that he lost all his finger and toe nails. He spent twenty hours in a storm at sea in his kayak and at one point fell into a deep crevasse, saving himself by holding onto the handles of his dog sled. He later led a three man team across the desolate Greenland ice-cap, the first European to do this since Nansen. He was fluent in Inuit and was an able Inuit Kayaker and dog sledger. He also fathered a son by an Inuit girl but the child died a year later. He was awarded the Polar Medal for his participation in the first expedition. It was clear that Gino Watkins moulded an extraordinary esprit de corps in his expeditions, and the expedition members were a strange mixture of military intelligence (MI) officers, hard nuts, and rather fay Cambridge misfits. Many of the members would go on to do extraordinary things in the war. These members included Martin Lindsay, Augustine Courtauld and Chapman himself.\n\nIn 1935, he went to Finnish and Norwegian Lapland, and had \"an exciting\" expedition on skis with a reindeer called Isaac, which he eventually sold to a butcher. Early in 1936, he joined a Himalayan climbing expedition. He was a keen mountaineer and enjoyed the difficult climbs and achieved peaks, as well as meeting Basil Gould, the Political Officer for Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet. Gould invited Spencer to be his private secretary on his political mission, from July 1936 to February 1937, to persuade the Panchen Lama to return from China and establish permanent British representation in Lhasa. Spencer learnt Tibetan well enough to converse. He was involved in cypher work, kept a meteorological log, pressed six hundred plants, dried seeds, and made notes on bird life. He kept a diary of \"events\" in Lhasa and took many photographs that were sent to India on a weekly basis. He was allowed to explore within Tibet and did so in an unshepherded way into the middle of Tibet and around the Holy City.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Gua ... an-001.jpg\n\nNaturalist, adventurer and a now almost forgotten explorer, mountaineer and hero of the second world war, Freddie Spencer Chapman (far left). Photograph: British Library\n\nAfter his return from Lhasa, Chapman obtained permission to lead a five-man expedition from Sikkim to the holy mountain Chomolhari, which the British group had passed on the way from Sikkim to Tibet in July 1936. Chapman and Sherpa Passang Dawa Lama succeeded to become the first mountaineers to climb the 7314 m high peak, which they finally reached from the Bhutanese side after finding the route from the Tibetan side impassable. The mountain would not be climbed again until 1970. In 1938 Spencer taught at Gordonstoun School where Prince Philip was one of his pupils. Commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders as a lieutenant on 6 June 1939, Chapman was attached to the Ski Battalion (the 5th Battalion) of the Scots Guards where he trained at Chamonix and then fought in Finland with the Battalion. He designed the skis that were to be used by the Battalion, but on arrival in Finland these were replaced with the superior Finnish military skis. He became somewhat of an expert in behind-the-lines operations whilst in Finland. After the Winter War, he served a spell as instructor at the S.O.E. training centre at Arisaig and was then posted to a Commando School in Australia to train Australian and New Zealand forces in guerrilla warfare and eventually to join what was then Special Training School 101 STS-101 in Singapore. This school had as one of its main objects the organization of parties to stay behind in areas the Japanese might overrun.\n\nIn August 1941, a plan for stay-behind parties that would include local Indians, Chinese and Malays was proposed, but this was rejected by the British colonial governor, Sir Shenton Thomas, as extravagant and defeatist. By now a Captain, Chapman took part in undercover raids during the Japanese invasion. When Singapore did fall, in early 1942, Chapman disappeared into the mountains, not to emerge again until May 1945. Conditions were atrocious. Half-starved, delirious due to malaria and festering ulcers from leech bites, Chapman and the two Brits he had eventually linked up with daubed themselves in dye, marched miles through the dense jungle by night, and set about inconveniencing the Japanese. In the first fortnight alone, they blew up 15 railway bridges, derailed seven trains and exploded 40 military vehicles, mostly using homemade bombs of gelignite hidden in bamboo sticks. They used 1,000lb of explosives, threw 100 grenades, and caused – according to Chapman's own estimate – between 500 and 1,500 enemy casualties. The Japanese command believed it was up against 200 highly trained commandos, and deployed 2,000 troops to hunt the three-man band down.\n\nAware that this rate of attack could never be kept up, Chapman tried to make it to the sea but was eventually forced back into the jungle where he started training local insurgents – teaching them to whistle The Lambeth Walk for identification purposes after dark while announcing his own nocturnal arrival with the cry of a British tawny owl. The risks were immense. When any of the locals who assisted him were caught, their whole village would be burnt to the ground - the inhabitants incinerated inside their houses, or shot and bayoneted to death, men, women and children. Chastened by such endurance, despite suffering many of the jungle's ills - pneumonia, infected leech bites and blackwater fever, a variant of malaria that caused him 'frightful vomiting and dysentery, accompanied by such agonising pains across my pelvis that it seemed as if all my bones must come apart'. When the fever was at its height, his fits were so bad that two men had to hold him down. He travelled to other guerilla camps and en route he lived variously with Chinese bandits, Malay tribespeople and communists. On one such visit he was served a special banquet, with an unfamiliar meat. It was only later he learned the hideous truth. 'I was told I had been eating Jap,' he wrote. 'Though I would not knowingly have become a cannibal, I was quite interested to have sampled human flesh.'\n\nAlmost permanently sick, Chapman spent 17 days in a coma, only subsequently realising what had happened from the absence of any notes in his diary. Once, he was so feverish that his mouth had to be bound shut to prevent his chattering teeth giving away his whereabouts to a Japanese patrol. And on the one occasion he was captured, Chapman blithely announced that a Japanese prince had been his keen birdwatching companion at Cambridge. The arresting officer was apparently so charmed that he apologised for having no whisky to offer Chapman, and declined to bind his hands and feet. Chapman then waited till dead of night and, despite a debilitating bout of malaria, made good his escape.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_k07pirzBU34/S ... 548two.jpg\n\nFreddy Spencer Chapman entered the war as a lieutenant with the Seaforth Highlanders and ended the war as a Lieutenant-Colonel\n\nIn December 1943, he was overjoyed to be joined by two special forces officers, John Davis and Richard Broome, who had been landed in Malaya by submarine to coordinate guerilla activity for a planned Allied invasion. For over a year they worked as a three-man unit, training Chinese guerillas, making contact with other resistance groups and trying desperately to procure a working radio. At last, in February 1945, they obtained one and made contact with the British forces in Ceylon, who were at first reluctant to believe that any of them, but particularly Chapman, could possibly be alive after so long in the jungle. A rescue plan was soon launched to bring the jungle heroes home and in May 1945, after a hazardous journey to the coast, they were picked up by submarine and taken back to Ceylon. Chapman's heroic tale of survival was over and three months later Japan finally surrendered. In recognition of his extraordinary achievements and endurance he was given a DSO and bar, although not the Victoria Cross that many, including Mountbatten, thought he deserved.\n\nYet for years after the war, Chapman felt a keen sense of despair. Having sealed off his emotions in the jungle, in peace-time he found himself tormented by memories of 'companions shot down beside me . . . the screams of defenceless Chinese women and children bayoneted to death by the Japanese'. Writing of Chapman after the war, Field Marshal Earl Wavell said that, \"for sheer courage and endurance, physical and mental\", the adventurer-naturalist stood together with TE Lawrence as \"examples of what toughness the body will find, if the spirit within it is tough\". Both, Wavell reckoned, were \"very worthy representatives of our national capacity for individual enterprise\". Quite why Chapman hasn't found Lawrence of Arabia's fame is anyone's guess. After the war, he was headmaster of schools in Germany and South Africa. Married with three children, he ended up as warden of a hall of residence at Reading University in the UK. Forced to retire before he would have wished, aware his health and energy were no longer what they were, and suffering from one of the periodic bouts of depression that had gripped him since Cambridge, he shot himself in the head in his office, aged 64. Chapman wrote a number of books, including perhaps his most famous, “The Jungle is Neutral.”\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://britains-smallwars.com/swbooks/j ... _cover.jpg\n\nCover of “The Jungle is Neutral” by F Spencer Chapman\n\nSir Rupert William John Clarke\n\nSir Rupert William John Clarke, 3rd Baronet, AM, MBE (5 November 1919 – 4 February 2005) was an Australian soldier, businessman and pastoralist. He achieved success in a number of fields, including horseracing, the military and as a corporate chairman. He was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the son of Rupert Clarke, 2nd Baronet (a prominent pastoralist and Member of Parliament) and Elsie Tucker (born in Melbourne). His father purchased the Villa Les Abeilles in Monte Carlo and the young Rupert attended a French-speaking primary school. Upon his father's death on Christmas Day 1926, he succeeded as the Third Baronet of Rupertswood at the age of seven years. His mother remarried (to the Fifth Marquess of Headfort) and he moved to England. Rupert became an accomplished athlete at Eton and then later at Magdalen College, Oxford. He excelled at shooting, swimming, fencing and rowing. Scholastically he excelled, particularly in languages. Sir Rupert visited Australia during university holidays in 1937 where he met his future wife Kathleen Grant Hay and then returned to England.\n\nHe then spent a considerable amount of time travelling through Germany with friends who would soon be on the opposing side during World War II. Just prior to the outbreak of WWII he returned to Australia. However, being too young for a commission in the Australian Army he returned to England where his membership of the Oxford University OTC assisted in his enlistment as a weapons instructor and then to Royal Military College Sandhurst, where he digressed by volunteering for a ski battalion to fight the Russians. He trained in Chamonix, Mont Blanc with the Chasseurs Alpins as part of the 5th Battalion Scots Guards, serving as “Guardsman” as the soldiers in the Scots Guards were known. He gained notoriety within the Battalion in Finland for his obvious enjoyment in blowing things up. After returning from Finland, he completed a further stint at Sandhurst and in 1941 was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion the Irish Guards. The unit had lost most of its senior officers in a dive bombing attack off Narvik and with the experience he brought with him from the fighting in Finland, Sir Rupert had no trouble establishing a reputation as a mad Australian weapons officer given to blowing things up and shooting flies on barracks walls.\n\nAfter an appointment as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Harold Alexander, Clarke was present at various major turning points in the war, including the withdrawal from Burma, the North African Campaign against the German Afrika Korps and the Invasion of Sicily. As ADC to Alexander, he met Chiang Kai Shek and Pope Pius XII. In 2000, Sir Rupert wrote a book on his war adventures entitled With Alex at War – From the Irrawaddy to the Po 1941-1945.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5 ... SS500_.jpg\n\nCover to “With Alex at War” by Rupert Clarke:\n\nAfter the war, Clarke returned to Australia and married Kathleen Grant Hay, daughter of a successful Melbourne brewery owner. Following his appointment as a Director (his first of many) of the Richmond Brewery in 1950, Sir Rupert returned to England seeking introductions to inspect breweries, then became involved in a partnership venture to ship cattle to Australia for stud purposes. He later became involved in horse racing, and was on the Victoria Amateur Turf Club (now the Melbourne Racing Club) for 40 years, nearly half that time as chairman. He was also chairman of Cadbury Schweppes Australia, and P&O Australia, deputy chairman of the Distillers Group and the third generation of Clarke Baronets to sit on the board of the National Australia Bank and managed to fit in time to be the Honorary Consul of Monaco in Australia.\n\nHe died in 2005 at the age of 85, leaving three children and his second wife, Gillian de Zoete. His eldest son, Rupert applied to succeed him as the Fourth Baronet of Rupertswood. The baronetcy (originally awarded to Sir William Clarke by Queen Victoria in 1882), is one of only two now extant with Australian territorial designation, and the only such baronetcy held by an Australian-born citizen.[\n\nGuardsman Sir Ivar Iain Colquhoun, 8th Baronet\n\nGuardsman Sir Ivar Iain Colquhoun, 8th Baronet, JP, DL (4 January 1916 – 31 January 2008 aged 92) was the eldest son (of five children) of Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet and his wife Geraldine Bryde (Dinah) Tennant. Sir Ivar was educated at Eton. He was working at a lumber camp in Finland at the outbreak of World War II, and returned to the UK where he joined a Territorial Army battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as a private soldier. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, he was seconded to the 5th (Ski) Battalion, Scots Guards. After returning from Finland in late 1940, he joined the artillery in Libya and served there during the siege of Tobruk, later to become the subject of some of his drier reminiscences. By the end of the war, he was serving as a liaison officer with the Kings Company, Grenadier Guards and subsequently became a Captain in the Coldstream Guards.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DaAnDSWPhus/R ... 2jan37.jpg\n\nThe young Sir Ivar Iain Colquhoun, 8th Baronet at his coming of age party in January, 1937\n\nHe was married in 1943 to Kathleen Nimmo Duncan (died 17 April 2007), 2nd daughter of Walter Atholl Duncan, of Cadogan Sq, London. His wife's sister Marjorie Ray Duncan married in 1938 the 6th Earl of Verulam. After marriage, he settled the family at Camstradden, by Luss. His eldest son, Torquhil (who died in 1963 at the age of 19), was born in 1944, followed by Iona Mary (who married the 12th Duke of Argyll in 1964) in 1945 and Malcolm Rory Colquhoun (b 20 Dec 1947), 9th baronet, who as the surviving son succeeded as Clan Chief, in 1947. Prior to succeeding to the title, he was styled Malcolm Colquhoun of Luss, younger of Luss, as the heir to the baronetcy and estate.\n\nSir Ivar was the eighth baronet, the 30th Laird of Luss and Clan Chief of Colquhoun. As a member of the Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs, he made regular appearances at clan gatherings and clan games and endorsed the clan museum. From 1949 until 1982 he was chieftain of the Luss Highland Games which were held every July. He served as a Justice of the Peace for over 20 years, though was reported to not enjoy it much. He was a deputy lieutenant for Dunbartonshire and for 20 years (between the 1950’s and 1970’s) was the chairman of the British Sailors’ Society, a charity dear to his heart. He was a keen sailor, often exploring the sea lochs up the West Coast where he knew and loved the inlets and passages around the western isles as well as any man alive. He was also an active force in the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, while his sister, Lady Arran, was a powerboat champion and pioneer. A countryman through and through, he was a keen shot and gardener with a particular interest in forestry plantations, never happier than when out with his gun, or in his garden, or inspecting one of the forestry schemes that he assiduously cultivated on the Luss Estate. He also loved brightly colored cars.\n\nHe inherited the titles and the Luss Estate from his father, Sir Ian Colquhoun, the 7th Baronet, who died in 1948. The legacy he had been left by his father, which in those days extended to some 70,000 acres on the west side of Loch Lomond, was not in good shape (business matters had never been Sir Iain’s forte) and so he devoted his energies to restoring the fortunes of the Luss Estate, which he had initially been advised to sell. Although the estate, renowned as one of Britain’s most beautiful, with its hill grazing for sheep, was not economically viable for agriculture, and its sporting facilities for pheasant and grouse shooting, stalking and fishing were not in the big league, Colquhoun fought a valiant battle against the encroachment of urban sprawl. He was a principled opponent of wind farms on the ground of aesthetics even when there were lucrative subsidies available and few objections from the green lobby, thus preserving Loch Lomond from an eyesore. He lived at the family mansion of Rossdhu until 1972, when economic reality meant that large houses such as this were no longer viable, and moved back to Camstradden where he had embarked on married life almost 30 years before.\n\nIn the event, with nearby Glasgow, once famous for its slums, becoming renowned as a prosperous city, the solution to the problem was inspired. Twenty years ago Colquhoun invited the American golfer Tom Weiskopf, to develop a golf course, and this was eventually achieved in co-operation with the Arizona developer Lyle Anderson. The result is an internationally famous golf course that attracts top professionals in the summer just before the British Open and is well known to television viewers. The land is leased from the Colquhouns, and their magnificent Robert Adam-designed house, Rossdhu, has become the clubhouse decorated with the family tartan, with their furniture and paintings, while Colquhoun and his wife Kay, lived in the dower house next door. At the same time, Colquhoun fought hard to protect the village of Luss, often voted the prettiest village in Scotland, and won a five-year campaign to prevent BP building an oil terminal on his land. Those who worked for Colquhoun during his 60-year tenure at Luss recall that, although shy, he was a canny and doughty fighter, resisting the lure of development money. His proactive diplomatic efforts to protect the islands in the loch and the cottages on his land were executed with brilliance and a firm hand, often he simply said: \"We don't do that.\"\n\nAn enthusiastic traveller, especially in African countries such as Egypt, Säo Tomâe and Guinea, where he steeped himself in the local culture and historical oddities such as distilling from sugar cane and enjoyed puzzling out the purposes of archaeological remains. While travelling to Samarkand with his old friend Sir Iain Moncreiffe, the two seemed to delight in competing with each other to describe arcane details of tribal life. In addition to his other interests, Sir Ivar had a great interest in – and considerable knowledge of – Clan and genealogical matters, although in his old age he had delegated many of his duties, including those as Chieftain of Luss Games, to his son Malcolm.\n\nLady Colquhoun died in April 2007 on their 64th wedding anniversary. Sir Ivar lived out the rest of his days at Camstradden, becoming ill in August 2007 with a recurrence of a cancer problem from many years before. Although he kept himself largely to himself, he was a familiar figure around Helensburgh with his dogs and brightly coloured cars; he was a generous host, a knowledgeable and witty companion to his many friends, and deserves to be remembered for having rescued and replenished his threadbare inheritance and, in so doing, preserving the ancestral lands of Clan Colquhoun for posterity – a considerable achievement, and one of which he was enormously proud. Sir Ivar Colquhoun died peacefully at home at Camstraddan on his beloved Loch Lomondside just outside the village of Luss on the 31st of January 1938. Sir Ivar was the longest serving Clan Chief of Colquhoun, having succeeded to the title in November 1948 and holding it for almost 60 years. With his death, the last of the great post-war generation of landowning Scottish clan chiefs – familiar names such as Cameron of Lochiel, Fraser of Lovat, the Dukes of Atholl and Montrose – came to an end. He was also one the last survivors of the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards.\n\nHe is succeeded in the baronetcy by his surviving son Malcolm (60) who is married to Katharine. They have three children, Patrick, Fergus and Georgina.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.electricscotland.com/webclan ... quhoun.jpg\n\nSir Ivar Iain Colquhoun, 8th Baronet, Guardsman (5th Battalion, Scots Guards)\n\nTo Be Continued.....\n\nThe 5th Battalion, Scots Guards (Continued)\n\nWilliam Hubert Fox\n\nWilliam Hubert Fox (26 January 1911 – 20 September 2008) was born in Manila in the Philippines, the son of a successful trader who operated around the South China Sea. His parents travelled extensively and whilst still an infant he had visited Madrid, Paris and London. In 1916 Fox was sent to preparatory school, then attended Haileybury Public School. He was expected to go on to Oxford University and thence into the petroleum industry; but this was not to be. Fox read an advertisement in The Times inviting people to audition for the Central School of Speech and Drama (well known for training actors). He won a scholarship but since he was from a wealthy family, the scholarship was only given on the condition that the money be passed on to the next person on the list. Fox's father agreed to fund Fox's studies only on the basis that Fox would complete what was normally a two-year course in a single year. He achieved this, and was awarded the school's gold medal upon graduating.\n\nIn 1930 Fox left drama school and won a role in London's West End performing in an eight-month run of W. Somerset Maugham's new play The Breadwinner at the Vaudeville Theatre. Following this success Fox co-founded an acting troupe, based in the West Country, where they converted a former swimming baths in Teignmouth into a theatre. He staged the thriller Rope and following a glowing review from actor Cyril Maude, the play had an eight-week sold-out run. In 1932 he married Carol Rees, who was seven years his senior and already pregnant with their daughter. The relationship did not survive the divergence of their careers and Rees petitioned for divorce in 1937. Fox went on to perform in J.B. Priestley's play Dangerous Corner, directed by Tyrone Guthrie; he was billed as \"a great discovery\". He rejected an offer to join the Broadway cast of the play, opting to join a company led by John Gielgud at the Old Vic Theatre. He played opposite Peggy Ashcroft in As You Like It, and their performance was painted by Walter Sickert.\n\n1934 was Fox's busiest year to date; he performed in five stage plays in the West End. One was Precipice, a play about a ballet, which co-starred dancer Anton Dolin. After a short spell on Broadway, Fox returned to Britain. In the US he had been offered an audition by Warner Bros., but turned it down since his new love, Patricia Hillard was acting in Oxford. After being spotted dining together at the Savoy Grill by W. B. Priestley, who said he had never seen a couple \"so much in love\", they had a successful run in Priestley's play I Have Been Here Before which ran from 1937 until 1938. Fox also acted in and wrote radio dramas. He often wrote under a pseudonym, as he didn't want his fellow actors to know he was the writer and sometimes made casting decisions. His first performance was in 1934 in Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea.\n\nIn 1939 Fox and Hillard were living in Dolphin Square, where they became annoyed by their neighbour, Unity Mitford's, habit of playing loud Nazi marching songs. Inspired by this, and fortified by \"lunch at L'Ecu de France\", Fox joined the Territorial Army. While he was receiving military training he also happened to be playing a Nazi officer in a play called Weep for the Spring, about life in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler.\n\nAs a territorial soldier Fox was amongst the first to be called up in 1939 upon the declaration of war with Germany. Fox was commissioned as an officer in the London Irish Rifles. He volunteered to join a ski battalion which was to be sent to Finland to aid that country in the Winter War against the Soviet Union. On his return from Finland, he attended Staff College at Camberley, then spent the majority of the war stationed in North Africa and the Middle East. One of his roles involved helping to administer the meeting between Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin in Tehran in 1943. After six years service Fox was demobilized with the rank of Major (and had had a spell as an acting Lieutenant-Colonel). He later learned that in 1945, a few days before the liberation of Manila, his parents had been shot by the Japanese. After the war he continued to hold a reserve commission as a captain and honorary Major until 1961, when he reached the age limit for service. He was awarded the Territorial Efficiency Decoration (TD) in 1967.\n\nAfter demobilisation Fox was considered too old to take on the types of “younger” roles he had used to play, and as he had no experience as a lead actor directors were wary of casting him in these parts. It was whilst in Baghdad that Fox decided to start the Reunion Theatre; this association was designed to help demobilised actors who had been out of the business for several years. The association did this by performing extracts from well-known plays and inviting agents and producers to watch. One actor who benefitted from this was Dirk Bogarde. After several successful productions Fox handed over the chairmanship of the Reunion Theatre to Laurence Olivier. During the 1950s and '60s Fox's career was mixed; he did a season at Stratford and took on several West End comedies. The 1960s saw less theatrical roles; he did however perform in film, television and radio, for which he also wrote.\n\nFox started a wine merchant business and also dealt in antiques and pictures. These activities led to his devoting less time to acting though he continued to perform, notably in television shows such as The Duchess of Duke Street, When the Boat Comes In and Yes, Prime Minister. The late 1970s saw a return to theatre and the West End in a revival of T.S. Eliot's The Family Reunion. He would also appear in an opera as Haushofmeister in Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos at Glyndebourne. Fox was a member of the Gentlemen's Club and the Garrick Club, where he often spent time in the company of Kenneth More and Kingsley Amis\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/e ... am_Fox.jpg\n\nWilliam Hubert Fox, Actor and Guardsman, 5th Battalion, Scots Guards\n\nBrigadier Simon “Shimi” Christopher Joseph Fraser, DSO, MC, TD, 15th Lord Lovat, 4th Baron Lovat and 25th Chief of the Clan Fraser\n\nSimon Christopher Joseph Fraser, the 15th Lord Lovat, 4th Baron Lovat and 25th Chief of the Clan Fraser was born on 9 July 1911 in Beaufort Castle (the Lovat’s traditional home), Inverness, Scotland and died 16 March 1995 in Beauly, Inverness-shire, Scotland. His friends called him \"Shimi\" Lovat, an anglicised version of his first name in the Scottish Gaelic language. His clan referred to him as MacShimidh, his Gaelic patronymic, meaning Son of Simon. Simon ws the favored first name for the Chiefs of Clan Fraser. Fraser was the son of the 14th Lord Lovat and Laura, daughter of Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale. After being educated at Ampleforth College (where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps) and Oxford University, where he joined the University's Cavalry Squadron, Fraser was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Lovat Scouts (a Territorial Army unit) in 1930.\n\nThe Lovat Scouts were first formed in January 1900 for service in the Second Boer War as a Scottish Highland yeomanry regiment of the British Army by Simon Joseph Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat, father Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, and uncle of David Stirling, the creator of the Special Air Service. The unit was commanded by an American, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts, who fittingly described the Lovat Scouts as \"half wolf and half jackrabbit”. Major Burnham was selected for an award of the the Victoria Cross but declined rather than give up his American citizenship. Well practiced in the arts of marksmanship, field craft, and military tactics, they were also phenomenal woodsmen always ready to tempt fate, but also practitioners of discretion: \"He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day.\" The Lovat Scouts also have the distinction of being the first military unit to wear a Ghillie suit.\n\nThe Lovat Scouts were attached to the Black Watch, but were then disbanded in July 1901 while two surviving companies (the 113th and 114th) were formed for the Imperial Yeomanry. When the Second Boer War ended in 1902, the two companies of the Imperial Yeomanry were also disbanded. The unit was reformed the following year as two regiments, titled the 1st and 2nd Lovat Scouts. From these scouts a sharpshooter unit was formed and in 1916 this became the British Army's first specialist sniper unit. The two Lovat Scouts battalions saw extensive involvement on the Western Front, at Gallipoli, in Egypt and in Macedonia during WW1. The Sharpshooters were formed from gamekeepers (or ghillies) from the highland estates and were used in an observation and sniping role on the Western Front until the end of the War. With the defence cuts implemented after World War I, one regiment of the Lovat Scouts was disbanded in 1922.\n\nWith the start of the Second World War, the Lovat Scouts were mobilized and there were initially plans to send the Battalion to Finland to join the 5th Battalion Scots Guards and the Atholl Highlanders. However, with the Battle of France in full swing and Norway having been lost, in May 1940 the Lovat Scouts were instead sent as a garrison to the Faroe Islands to protect against a possible German invasion. They remained there until June 1942, when they were sent back to the UK and a number were removed from the unit due to a decrease in performance. The numbers were then swelled with new recruits, including hill walkers from Yorkshire and Lancashire, but also new recruits from the Regiment's more traditional recruiting areas. After a period based in northern Scotland and in Wales, the Scouts were sent to Canada in December 1943 for specialist ski and mountain training. As a consequence of their training in Jasper, they were sent to Finland from mid 1944 to the end of the war, where they fought as a component of the Allied Forces under overall Finnish command.\n\nHowever, that’s more by way of a footnote than anything. Returning now to Lord Lovat, he transferred to the regular army (still as a second lieutenant) joining the Scots Guards in 1931. The following year, Fraser succeeded his father to become the 15th Lord Lovat and 25th Chief of the Clan Fraser. He was promoted lieutenant in August 1934. Lovat resigned his regular commission as a lieutenant in 1937, transferring to the Supplementary Reserve of Officers. He married Rosamond Broughton, the daughter of Jock Delves Broughton, on 10 October 1938, with whom he had six children.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.pegasusarchive.org/normandy/ ... ovat_4.jpg\n\n“Shimi” Lovat and Rosamond, nee Broughton on their wedding day, 10 October 1938\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://i49.servimg.com/u/f49/15/99/12/13/lord_l11.jpg\n\n“Shimi” Lovat in 1939, just prior to the start of WW2\n\nIn June 1939 Lord Lovat also resigned his reserve commission. In August 1939 however, as war approached, Lord Lovat was mobilized as a captain in the Lovat Scouts. He volunteered for the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards and would see service in Finland where his natural abilities as a military commander would shine, despite his having enrolled in the Battalion as a Guardsman. With the 5th Battalion attached to Osasto Nyrkki, and with the full fury of the war forcing a rapid tempo of operations, Lord Lovat soon found himself a Captain once more, only this time in command of a mixed group of volunteers from a number of the Commonwealth Battalions who had volunteered for “special service”. In September 1940, Captain The Lord Lovat was awarded the Finnish Cross of Liberty, 1st Class for his part in a raid on military installations in Leningrad. His citation (translated from the original Finnish) reads:\n\nCaptain The Lord Lovat commanded a detachment of our soldiers which carried out a successful raid on military installations within the Soviet-occupied city of Pietari on the night of 21st/22nd July, 1940. Although the area selected for the raid formed part of a highly organised defensive position and although the enemy brought fire to bear on and around our attacking troops as soon as their presence became known, Captain The Lord Lovat by his speedy and clear-headed appreciation of the situation and by his cool leadership succeeded in retaining the initiative and by either killing or driving the Russians from their positions, enabled our fighting teams to carry out the demolitions which were the object of the raid.\n\nThroughout the operation Captain The Lord Lovat exercised faultless control and bold and skilful handling of his forces, not only in the initial stages which entailed the elimination of enemy guardposts and defensive positions, but also during the two hours spent deep within the enemy positions in attaining of the objective. Later, although the withdrawal was a precarious undertaking owing to the enemy's continuing attacks and defensive fire, and to the nature of the withdrawal itself, it was achieved without casualties and utilizing a carefully planned and laid smoke screen to conceal the assault gyrocopters which removed the detachment.\n\nI consider the fact that this operation was carried out with complete success and practically without loss to our troops was largely due to the excellent leadership and control of Captain The Lord Lovat.\n\n(Note of course the reference to the “Soviet-occupied city of Pietari” – when this Award was publicized, the war was in its last weeks, the Kremlin had been destroyed, Stalin was dead, incinerated together with a sizable portion of the Politburo and secret peace negotiations were underway with his successors. At this stage of the Winter War, and with the Finnish military holding a front that stretched from the White Sea to the suburbs of Leningrad, Finland was applying pressure obliquely on the still-secret negotiations by referring to Pietari (St Petersburg) and Ingermanland (the area surrounding Leningrad and stretching from the Finnish border to Estonia) as traditionally part of Finland, which indeed it is/was).\n\nFollowing his return from Finland and the Winter War, Lord Lovat volunteered to join one of the new commando units being formed by the British Army, and was eventually attached to No. 4 Commando. Now a (temporary) Major, Lord Lovat commanded 100 men of No. 4 Commando and a 50-man detachment from the Canadian Carleton and York Regiment in a raid on the French coastal village of Hardelot in April 1942. For this action he was awarded the Military Cross on 7 July 1942. Lord Lovat became an acting Lieutenant-Colonel in 1942 and was appointed the commanding officer of No. 4 Commando, leading them in the abortive Dieppe Raid (Operation Jubilee) on 19 August. His commando attacked and destroyed a battery of six 150 mm guns. Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).The raid as a whole was a disastrous failure: over 4,000 casualties were sustained, predominantly Canadian.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.clanmacfarlanegenealogy.info ... 201942.JPG\n\nSimon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat at Newhaven after returning from the Dieppe Raid, August 1942\n\nLord Lovat eventually became a Brigadier and became the commander of the newly formed 1st Special Service Brigade in 1944. Lord Lovat's brigade was landed on the coast of Estonia near Narva during the invasion of Estonia in April 1944. Lord Lovat reputedly waded ashore donning a white jumper under his battledress, with \"Lovat\" inscribed into the collar, while armed with a Suomi submachinegun. Lord Lovat instructed his personal piper, Bill Millin, to pipe the commandos ashore, in defiance of specific orders not to allow such an action in battle. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: “Ah, but that’s the English War Office. You and I are both Scottish and we’re attached to the Finnish Army, so that doesn’t apply.”\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.sunray22b.net/images/bill_millin.gif\n\nMiekka Beach (Invasion of Estonia). Lord Lovat, on the right of the column, wades through the water. The figure in the foreground is Piper Bill Millin.\n\nMillin began his apparently suicidal serenade immediately upon jumping from the ramp of the landing craft into the icy water. As the Cameron tartan of his kilt floated to the surface he struck up with \"Hieland Laddie\". He continued even as the man behind him was hit, dropped into the sea and sank. Once ashore Millin did not run, but walked up and down the beach, blasting out a series of tunes. After Hieland Laddie, Lovat, the commander of 1st Special Service Brigade (1 SSB), raised his voice above the crackle of gunfire and the crump of mortar, and asked for another. Millin strode up and down the water’s edge playing The Road to the Isles. Bodies of the fallen were drifting to and fro in the surf. Soldiers were trying to dig in and, when they heard the pipes, many of them waved and cheered — although one came up to Millin and called him a “mad bastard”.\n\nWhen the brigade moved off, Millin was with the group that attacked the rear of a small town being used as a defensive position by the Germans. After the capture of the town, he went with Lovat towards Narva, piping along the road. They were very exposed, and were shot at by snipers from across the river. Millin stopped playing. Everyone threw themselves flat on the ground — apart from Lovat, who went down on one knee. When one of the snipers scrambled down a tree and dived into a field, Lovat stalked him and shot him. He then sent two men into the long grass to look for him and they came back with the corpse. “Right, Piper,” said Lovat, “start the pipes again.”\n\nAt Puhkova, where they again came under fire, the CO asked Millin to play them down the main street. He suggested that Millin should run, but the piper insisted on walking and, as he played Blue Bonnets Over the Border, the commandos followed. When they came to the crossing which later became known as Puhkova Bridge, Maavoimat Parajaegers on the other side signaled frantically that it was under sniper fire. Lovat ordered Millin to shoulder his bagpipes and play the commandos over. “It seemed like a very long bridge,” Millin said afterwards. The pipes were damaged by shrapnel later that day, but remained playable. Millin was surprised not to have been shot, and he mentioned this to some Germans who had been taken prisoner. They said that they had not shot at him because they thought he had gone off his head.\n\nWilliam Millin, the son of a policeman, was born in Glasgow on July 14 1922. For a few years the family lived in Canada, but they returned to Scotland and Bill went to school in Glasgow. He joined the TA before the Second World War and played in the pipe band of the 7th Battalion the Highland Light Infantry. He subsequently transferred to the Cameron Highlanders before volunteering to join the commandos in 1941. He met Lord Lovat while he doing his commando training at Achnacarry, north of Fort William. Lovat, the hereditary chief of the Clan Fraser, offered him a job as his batman, but Millin turned this down and Lovat agreed instead to take him on as his personal piper. When Millin boarded the landing craft bound for the Estonian beaches, he took his bagpipes out of their box and, standing in the bow, played Road to the Isles as they went out of Kotka. Someone relayed the music over the loud hailer and troops on other transports heard it and started cheering and throwing their hats in the air.\n\nLike many others, Millin was so seasick on the rough crossing that the coast of Estonia proved a welcome sight, despite the dangers that came with it. “I didn’t care what was going on ashore. I just wanted to get off that bloody landing craft,” he said. He accompanied 4 Commando down the Baltic coast, into Poland and then on to Germany; he finished the war at Lubeck. After being demobilised the following year he took up the offer of a job on Lord Lovat’s estate. This life proved too quiet for him, however, and he joined a touring theatre company with which he appeared playing his pipes on the stage in London, Stockton-on-Tees and Belfast. In the late 1950s he trained in Glasgow as a registered mental nurse and worked in three hospitals in the city. In 1963 Millin moved to Devon, where he was employed at the Langdon Hospital, Dawlish, until he retired in 1988. In several of the Ten Tors hikes on Dartmoor organised by the Army he took part as the piper, and also visited America, where he lectured about his D-Day experiences. Millin played the lament at Lord Lovat’s funeral in 1995, and he donated his pipes to the National War Museum in Edinburgh. Bill Millin married Margaret Mary Dowdel in 1954. She predeceased him and he is survived by their son.\n\nLovat's forces swiftly pressed on, Lovat himself advancing with parts of his brigade from Miekka Beach to Puhkova Bridge, which had been held by men of the Finnish Army’s Parajaeger Division who had landed in the early hours by glider. Lord Lovat's commandos arrived at a little past one p.m. at Puhkova Bridge though the rendezvous time as per the plan was noon. Upon reaching the rendezvous, Lord Lovat apologized to Everstiluutnantti Yrjö Mäntyruumisarkku, CO of the 7th Parajaegerpataljoona (Paratroop Battalion). The commandos then marched across Puhkova Bridge to the sound of Bill Millin's bagpipes, as a result of which twelve men died, shot through their berets. Later detachments of the commandos rushed across in small groups with their helmets on. He went on to establish defensive positions around the outskirts of Puhkova, south of Narva. The bridges were relieved later in the day by elements of the Maavoimat's 3rd Field Infantry Division.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.commandoveterans.org/images/VL158.png\n\nTwo legendary Commando Officers - the 'Laird' of Achnacarry, Lt. Col Charles Vaughan and Lt. Col The Lord Lovat : photo taken shortly after the capture of Narva, E-Day+2 (there is no record of why Lt Col. Vaughan was in Estonia, what role he played or how long he stayed. It may be that he was evaluating training for the Commando forces vis-à-vis actual combat as Lt-Col Vaughan ran the Commando training centre which trained all the Allied Commandos and the US Rangers during the Second World War. Born in 1893 (died 1968), he was a Veteran of the First World War and the Retreat from Mons in 1914. In the inter war years he graduated from Drill Sergeant to RSM, but he was much more than just a bawling barrack square man, although he could do that if needed. His obvious military potential as an officer was recognised and he was commissioned. A Londoner by birth and proud of it, Charlie's standards for soldiers and soldiering were set by his long service in war and peace. He accepted nothing but the best, whether it be in fitness, training, weaponry and musketry, fieldcraft and tactics, drill and turnout, or even in the more apparently mundane matters of administration which included feeding and hygiene. Together all these factors made the 'whole' - and the self disciplined and reliant Commando soldier 'fit to fight' and 'fighting fit' with high morale, willing and capable of tackling any military task, under any circumstances, and against any odds\" He apparently served in No.7 and No.4 Commando before taking up his role as the Commandant of the newly formed Commando depot at Achnacarry, a position he held from 1942-1945.\n\nDuring the Battle of Utena on 12 June 1944, Lord Lovat was seriously wounded whilst observing an artillery bombardment by the 21st Pansaaridivisoona. A stray shell fell short of its target and landed amongst the group of observing officers, killing one, and seriously wounding others. Lord Lovat made a full recovery from the severe wounds he had received in the Baltic but was unable to return to the army (he transferred to the reserve in 1949). In 1945 he joined the Government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, \"becoming responsible for the functions of the Ministry of Economic Warfare when these were taken over by the Foreign Office\". He resigned upon Winston Churchill's election defeat. In 1946 he was made a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John. His formal retirement from the army came on 16 June 1962, he retained the honorary rank of brigadier.\n\nLord Lovat's involvement in politics continued throughout his life, in the House of Lords and the Inverness County Council. He devoted much of his time to the family estates. He was chieftain of the Lovat Shinty Club, the local shinty team which bears his family name. Lord Lovat experienced a great deal of turmoil in his final years; suffering financial ruin and two of his sons predeceased him in accidents within months of each other. A year before his death, in 1994, the family's traditional residence, Beaufort Castle, was sold. Piper Bill Millin, Lord Lovat's personal piper who had piped the Commandos ashore on D-Day, played at Lord Lovat's funeral.\n\nCapt. Hugo Samuel Kenneth Greenlees\n\nOn 26 April 1940, Lt Greenlees was posted to The Cameronians. After serving in Finland with the 5th Battalion, Scots Guards, he ended up joining SOE. The London Gazette of 18 Feb 1943 records Lieutenant Hugo Samuel Kenneth Greenlees (129984), Infantry (Betchworth, Surrey), but with no mention as to why. On 4 January 1945, Captain Hugo Samuel Kenneth Greenlees (129984) of The Cameronians Special Reserve was awarded the OBE (Middle East, Special Operations). Greenlees was part of the SOE team assigned to work with the Chetniks in Yugoslavia attached to the HQ of Mihailovitch, the Chetnik Commander.\n\nPhoto sourced from: http://www.commandoveterans.org/cdoGall ... __+5tp.jpg\n\nCaptain Kenneth Greenlees, No.11 Commando 5 troop.
