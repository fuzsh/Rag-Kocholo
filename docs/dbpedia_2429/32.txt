Armies: Earl of Essex Dalbier, John John Dalbier (died 1648)

Dalbier’s date of birth, family and background are unknown. Probably of German or Dutch ancestry. Merchant, administrator, negotiator and soldier, he was briefly attached to the duke of Buckingham’s military ventures and was probably involved in the Ile de Rhe expedition. In 1642 he became a captain and then colonel of horse in the earl of Essex’s Army and for a time was his quartermaster general of horse. He was commissioned by Essex to command a newly-raised regiment of horse in spring 1643, which he led to the relief of Gainsborough in July 1643. He was with Essex in the relief of Gloucester and the first battle of Newbury. He and his regiment formed part of Balfour’s brigade which supported Waller in spring 1644 and thus he fought at the battle of Cheriton. He was back with Essex in summer 1644 for the doomed march into the South West and may have been at the second battle of Newbury. However, by autumn 1644 he was under suspicion and was detained in London for much of autumn and winter 1644-5, during which his regiment shrank through desertion. In spring 1645 he effectively lost command of his horse regiment and what was left of it was sent west and absorbed into Massey’s regiment of horse. However, Dalbier was not completely out of favour, for he was back in the field by late summer 1645 and he and men under him took part in the final and successful sieges of Basing, Donnington and Wallingford castles between autumn 1645 and spring 1646.

In 1647 he supported the political Presbyterians against the New Model Army and he joined the royalist rising in Surrey in summer 1648. He fled north and was part of the group of rebels caught and surprised at St Neots, Huntingdonshire, where he perished, either cut to pieces on the spot by former colleagues disgusted at his side-changing or from wounds sustained before his capture.

A lieutenant in Staffordshire. In Oct. 1644 he petitioned the county committee about his mother’s horses, which had been taken away by people in Walsall. He was authorized to arrest the offenders and detain them until he received satisfaction. He was also granted £50 because his father had died in the state’s service owed at least £20 and back pay. At one point he was serving in the garrison of Wrottesley, Staffordshire.

By Mar. 1644 he was a captain in Cheshire. By the end of Apr. 1645 Daniell as major was in command of the 70-strong colonel’s company of George Booth’s regiment of foot. A few days later at Knutsford Daniell was one of only two serving Cheshire officers who signed the anti-Brereton petition. In 1659 he took part took part in Sir George Booth’s Rising.

Armies: Cheshire Daniell, William William Daniell

Of Over Tabley, Cheshire. Son of Peter Daniell (1583/3-1652) of Over Tabley, MP for Cheshire 1626, and his wife Christian Grosvenor (died 1663), sister of Sir Richard Grosvenor, first baronet (for whom, see Oxford DNB). The funeral certificate of William’s grandfather Richard Grosvenor, in 1619, omits him, and gives his brother Henry as Peter and Christian’s fourth son; Sir Peter Leycester’s notes at the Restoration give William as fourth son and Henry as fifth. William’s elder brother John Daniell was auditor of the forces in the expedition to the West Indies in 1655, and was just possibly Major John Daniell in the Cheshire forces (although Dore considers John Daniell, junior, of Daresbury as a more likely identification). William’s eldest brother Peter was a royalist in the regiment of John, earl Rivers. His brother Henry Daniell was killed at Brentford in Nov. 1642; and while he is not recorded as a parliamentarian officer, the much greater death toll in Essex’s regiments coupled with Sir William Brereton’s claim to have been at Brentford, makes it more likely that Henry Daniell fought for parliament than the king. William’s sister married Simon Finch.

By Apr. 1645 William Daniell was captain of a sixty-strong company in Colonel Henry Brooke’s regiment of foot at the siege of Chester. In Jan. 1646 he was with a force sent into Wales against the castles at Hawarden and Holt, and by mid-Apr. was serving with the Cheshire forces besieging Lichfield Close. By the end of Apr. Daniell had been promoted major and on 26 May had command of a 92-strong company. In June 1648, holding the rank of colonel, Daniell was the acting governor of Chester Castle. On 4 May 1650, holding the rank of major, Daniell was ordered to raise a regiment of foot for service in Ireland. His officers included several who had served in the Cheshire forces in 1645-6, including as captains his lieutenant and ensign. Instead of being posted to Ireland, in July 1650 Daniell’s regiment joined Cromwell’s army in the invasion of Scotland and fought at Dunbar on 3 Sept. In 1651 Daniell’s regiment played an important role in Lambert’s victory at Inverkeithing on 20 July. For much of the 1650s the regiment was stationed at Perth. Daniel was active against the royalist rising of 1653-4, culminating in the surrender of the earl of Atholl in Aug. 1654. In June 1657 Monck appointed Daniell as commander in northern Scotland. He recommended to Thurloe that for this ‘very troublesome and chargeable’ appointment, Daniell be paid an extra 6s per day: ‘itt would bee a good incouragement to him to carry on his businesse, being hee is to bee constantlie at Aberdene from his familie, which is new settled att St. Johnston’s, where hee is governour’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental History, 2, 493). Daniell was alarmed by the growth of Quakerism, its converts including his own Captain-Lieutenant Davenport, declaring: ‘Where all are equals I expect little obedience in governement’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental History, 2, 493). A Cromwellian loyalist, Daniell was discharged from his command in summer 1659. However, his request for a formal discharge, which would confirm he was not dismissed for baseness or unworthiness, was ignored. Daniell’s replacement was his lieutenant-colonel, John Pearson.

Danvers does not seem to have served in Staffordshire during the first civil war, and his military service is obscure. In 1647-8 he participated in discussions of The Agreement of the People with radical officers such as Thomas Harrison.

Commissioned major of horse in the Leicesterhire militia, Mar. 1650, and colonel of foot in the Staffordshire militia, May 1650. Governor of Stafford, 1650-2.

In 1662/3 a survey of the allegiances of the Staffordshire gentry described him as of ‘Perry Hall but dweleth at Newinton Greene neare London’, aged about 40. Worth £300 per annum in Staffordshire ‘Of very dangerouse parts (and a very great Annabaptist)’ (‘Staffs. Gentry’, 13).

Armies: Earl of Denbigh; Shropshire Davenport, Christopher Christopher Davenport

Of Coventry. Son of Henry Davenport, draper, of Coventry, and mayor there, 1613-14. Christopher, a clothier, was admitted to Coventry’s First Council in June 1639 and was mayor in 1641-2. In the summer of 1642 he was a lukewarm parliamentarian: John Barker reported to Lord Brooke that Davenport had refused to implement the Militia Ordinance but, he thought, could be won over. In 1645 Davenport sat on the Coventry accounts sub-committee, a forum for the opponents of the more militant county committee.

Davenport appears in the earl of Denbigh’s accounts as captain-lieutenant (23 Mar. and 13 Apr. 1644), and then as captain (27 Apr., 4 May and 6 May 1644). Another account details a payment to ‘Lieut. Danpoorte his company’ (TNA, SP28/147, Part 3, f. 471r.).

Armies: Waller (Southern Association) Davidson, George George Davidson

Lieutenant-Colonel. A Scottish professional soldier. On 24 Oct. 1642 he was allowed two months’ allowance as captain of foot. He came down to Gloucestershire with two other Scottish officers, Lieutenant-Colonel James Carr and Colonel Arthur Forbes, and in Feb. 1643 Sergeant-Major Davidson was put in charge of training the Gloucester soldiers. In early July, by when he had risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, he was at the siege of Bristol, where he advised Fiennes to counter-attack and opposed a parley. He went to Gloucester for the siege, and returned there again after a journey to London. On 7 Oct. 1643 £4 15s. was paid at Gloucester for his use. Peachey and Turton, Fall of the West opine that, ‘Davidson’s movements indicate he may have progressed to second in command of one of the volunteer regiments of foot from Gloucestershire, probably a regiment destroyed at Roundway Down. Sir Robert Cooke’s is the most likely although Sir Horatio Carey’s is possible’.

Probably the William Davis who had been major in Sir John Merrick’s regiment of foot raised for Ireland early in 1642 to be part of Lord Wharton’s army. Instead, by or from 10 Aug. 1642 he served as lieutenant-colonel of the earl of Essex’s own regiment of foot in the earl of Essex’s Army. As such, given Essex’s other duties, he effectively had day-to-day command of the regiment. He continued in that role until sometime between 24 Aug. and 14 Oct. 1643. By or in May 1644 he succeeded James Holborne as colonel of his regiment of foot in the earl of Essex’s Army and commanded that regiment for around a year, until it was broken up and largely disbanded in spring 1645, though a handful of officers from it – but not Davies himself – transferred to the New Model Army at that point.

Peter Young states that he was dismissed from the Ordnance after Edgehill because of his useless performance there. Even the official parliamentarian account of the battle admits that in the run-up to the battle, as the army marched out from Worcester to intercept the king’s army, ‘our Train of Artillery was so unready, through want of Draught-Horses, and through other Omissions of Monsieur Du-Boys, that we were forced to leave it behind ro follow us’ (Young, Edgehill, 306).By 6 June 1643 he was quartermaster general of the Foot in Essex’s Army. He was dead by 17 Aug. 1643, when his widow, Mrs Geertuit de Boyes, claimed for his arrears.

Armies: Gloucestershire Devereux, Robert, third earl of Essex Robert Devereux, third earl of Essex (1591-1646)

Born in London, the eldest son and heir of the second earl of Essex, the Elizabethan courtier whose luck ended with his execution in 1601. Robert’s fortunes and titles were restored by James 1. though his time as a young courtier of the first Stuart king was cut short when he was humiliated by the adultery of and graphic annulment proceedings brought by his wife. He spent the next few years in semi-retirement on his Staffordshire estates.

During the 1620s he divided his time between campaigning and fighting on the continent in the Thirty Years War and taking his seat in the Lords during the frequent parliaments of that decade. The 1630s were marked by a fairly disastrous second marriage and growing distance between him and royal policies. He held military office in the English army raised for the First Scots War but not the Second; by summer 1640 he was clearly identified as a prominent critic of royal government.

He was one of the leading members of the Lords who were active in dismantling much of the personnel and policies of the Personal Rule in 1640-1. In summer 1641 the king appointed him commander of such troops as were based south of the Trent while he went north to ratify the Anglo-Scottish treaty. Essex accepted the drift to war in 1642 and on 12 July was appointed lord general and commander-in-chief of parliament’s armies. He retained that role for most of the main civil war, until forced to relinquish his command in spring 1645 under the terms of the Self-Denying Ordinance.

Essex’s military performance and record 1642-5 seem mixed. He was often quite cautious, tended to move slowly and often reacted to events and royalist moves rather than taking the initiative himself. But he was careful and methodical, took very few risks and was perhaps more concerned with not losing the war than with winning it.

In autumn 1642 he marched his fledgling army across the Midlands, securing and garrisoning key towns, before engaging the king’s armies in the major but drawn battle at Edgehill and then getting back to London in time to bolster the capital’s defences and to frighten off the king’s advance.

In 1643 and 1644 Essex and his army were based and campaigned in the main in and around the Thames valley. In both years they also observed quite brief campaigning seasons, not coming out of winter quarters and taking to the field until Apr. or May and ending the year’s campaign in Sept. or Oct.

The 1643 season began brightly enough, with the capture of Reading, and ended successfully by marching westwards to relieve Gloucester and then by getting back to the London area almost unscathed despite the king’s attempt to block the route at the first battle of Newbury. However, the summer period in between was marked by a lot of inactivity.

The following year also began positively, with Essex and Waller co-operating in a drive to encircle Oxford, forcing the king to bolt across the Cotswolds to elude them and to reach the Severn Valley. But at that point, the antipathy between the two men prevailed, their combined force divided and they went their separate ways – Waller to a ragged pursuit of the king leading to the rebuff of his army at Cropredy Bridge, Essex to a curious march into the South West, initially, sensibly and successful relieving the pressure on isolated Lyme Regis, but then plunging on through Devon and Cornwall, pursued by the king, until at the beginning of Sept. his army ran out of ground and hope; although he and other senior officers got away by boat and much of his horse was able to cut its way out, his foot had to surrender en masse south of Lostwithiel.

Essex survived in office for a while, genuinely and quite seriously ill during the autumn and so unable able to play any part in the desultory second battle of Newbury and associated campaign. During winter 1644-5, as during the previous two winters, he returned to London, to the Lords and to his political career. Although he opposed and resisted some elements of the ensuing major reorganisation of the parliamentary war effort, in spring 1645 he was forced to relinquish command in line with the Self-Denying Ordinance.

Although he was lord general from summer 1642 until spring 1645, at no time did Essex have full control over the war and war effort. He had to struggle with parliamentary and political initiatives and involvement and he had only loose control over the other regional armies in the Midlands, the East and the North.

As lord general he commanded his own army, always operating in southern England and generally based at the London end of the Thames valley; even at the height of the campaigning seasons, Essex maintained a strong military presence to the west and north-west of London to guard those approaches to the capital. He had his own regiments of foot and of horse, though given his wider duties the day-to-day command of those regiments really rested with subordinate officers. He also had a cluster of other horse and foot regiments which generally operated with and directly under him.

But his army was quite fluid and operated within a semi-porous membrane. Thus parts of Essex’s Army were sometimes deployed to reinforce or to garrison key parliamentarian strongholds in the southern half of England, including the Dorset ports and Plymouth, Gloucester and Newport Pagnell. Parts of his army were temporarily redeployed to strengthen other southern armies, especially Waller’s, including a brigade under Balfour which supported Waller’s (Cheriton) campaign of spring 1644. Equally, Essex could draw on other forces to strengthen his own Army for particular operations – most notably for the expedition to relieve Gloucester and the ensuing engagement at Newbury in late summer 1643, when he was reinforced by London units as well as some of Waller’s troops. Even though the two men had an uneasy, sometimes poor, relationship, at times it is hard to discern whether certain units were really Essex’s or Waller’s.

After leaving the army and giving up his military role, Essex’s final eighteen months were spent in richly-rewarded semi-retirement. He died quite suddenly, probably of a stroke, in Sept. 1646 and was accorded a grand state funeral. His equally grand funerary monument in Westminster Abbey was removed at the Restoration, but his body was left undisturbed.

Armies: Earl of Essex Dingley [Dineley], William William Dingley [Dineley] (1607/8-1653)

Of Hanley Castle, Worcestershire. His name is consistently spelt Dingley in the records, but the family name is more usually rendered Dineley. A younger son of Henry Dineley (died c. 1640) and his second wife Magdalen, daughter of Richard Egioke of Salford, Warwickshire. He married Alice, daughter of Edmund Waller of Gregories, Buckinghamshire (not the poet and plotter) and his wife Mary.

Dingley was a major when commissioned governor of Evesham and colonel of the foot regiment there by orders of the Lords and Commons on 25 Apr. 1646.

He brought his forces to the siege of Worcester, when it was known as ‘the Evesham regiment’ (TNA, SP28/138, Part 17).

The monumental inscription placed in Hanley Castle parish church by his widow makes clear that he had served in foreign service, and suggests that his promotion came rapidly once he returned to England. It also portrayed him as a man eager to release his county from the burdens of war: ‘To the happy and perpetual commemoration of Colonel William Dingley, of Hanley-Castle, a branch from the antient and eminent family of Charlton, and consequently allied to the great and noble of this county and nation; educated from his youth in a foreign militia, wherein his progress was so exact and conspicuous, that returning he was deservedly advanced to the government of Worcester; this opportunity spake the obligeingness of his noble nature to his endeared country, often by his ingenious industry, freed from the severe and numerous quarterings both of horse and foot; neither was he wanting to the civil government, being enrolled a justice of peace and quorum for this county, of which, in peace and war, he was most highly deserving, if not more fitly stiled the better genius, who for the great infelicity thereof was withdrawn by the great Jehovah, May 5, 1653, in the 46th. of his age’ (Nash, Worcestershire, 1.565).

Born a younger son of James Disbrowe of Eltisley, Cambridgeshire. He married in 1636 a sister of Oliver Cromwell.

He served under Cromwell from the outbreak of the civil war, initially as quartermaster of his troop of horse in Essex’s Army and from Apr. 1643 as captain in his horse regiment in the Eastern Association Army. In autumn 1643 he became its major and he stayed in the regiment until it was absorbed into the New Model Army in spring 1645, whereupon he became major in Fairfax’s horse regiment. He was prominent in several New Model actions during the last year of the war, including the battles of Naseby and Langport.

In the renewed fighting of 1648 he served in East Anglia, both restoring order in and around Bury and then taking part in the lengthy siege of Colchester. Fairfax appointed him governor of Yarmouth, so he was out of London at the time of, and had no direct part in, the regicide.

In Sept. 1649 he became colonel of a New Model horse regiment formerly commanded by Cromwell, assigned to the South West. Indeed, for much of the 1650s he was linked militarily to that region. Thus he did not campaign in Ireland or Scotland, though he and his men did take part in the battle of Worcester. In Mar. 1655 he took the lead in mopping up and restoring order after Penruddock’s royalist rising and his regional military command over the south-western counties served as a prototype for the regime of the major-generals; he was major-general of the South West. Although he also held naval office during the 1650s, he never went to sea.

He was an MP in the first and second Protectorate parliaments and became a member of the Other House. He was also a Protectoral Councillor. He was one of a small group of senior officers who, rapidly growing disenchanted with Richard Cromwell’s Protectorate, acted in spring 1659 to remove him and it; in the autumn he supported the removal of the Rump and the imposition of more direct military rule. As such, he fell from power during the opening months of 1660 and he was arrested at the Restoration and imprisoned in the Tower, though he escaped and fled to the continent. He was imprisoned again upon his return to England in the mid-1660s,, but he was released later in the 1660s and spent his last years in retirement in Hackney.

Of Conishead in Furness, Lancashire. Eldest son of Miles Dodding of Conishead (died c. 1632) and his wife Ursula Daivill. He married Sarah, daughter of Rowland Backhowse, a London alderman.

In early 1642, as a colonel, Dodding raised forces for parliament in Lonsdale Hundred. In early 1643 he was captured at Lancaster by the earl of Derby’s forces while attempting to escape by sea. Released, in Apr. 1643 Dodding was made a county sequestrator. He had been appointed a JP in 1642 and was also a deputy-lieutenant, although being in the remote north of Lancashire he played little part in the politics of the county committee. Dodding continued to serve as a colonel, his regiment including both horse and foot, and in spring 1644 was appointed governor of Lancaster. His organisation of its defences deterred Prince Rupert from attacking the town. Having fought at Marston Moor, Dodding returned to recruit his forces in Blackburn Hundred. On 26 Aug. 1644 he and Colonel Nicholas Shuttleworth defeated royalists under Lord Oglevie and Colonel Hudleston near Preston. In Sept. he and Joseph Rigby commenced the lengthy siege of Greenhalgh Castle. In 1648 Dodding was colonel of a militia regiment of foot in the Lancashire county forces.

D’Oilie is his own spelling of his name.

Fourth son of Sir Cope Doyley (1573/4-1633) of Chislehampton, Oxfordshire. He matriculated from Wadham College, Oxford on 15 June 1627, aged 15, graduated BA in 1629 and proceeding MA in 1632. He was admitted to Lincoln’s Inn in 1642. He later claimed that he was a student at Oxford, ‘but being obliged to fly thence, was plundered of his whole study of books, and other things of some value’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental history, 1.47). (He is the only Charles Doyley in the Oxford records at roughly the right date.)

D’Oilie was a cornet in the earl of Essex’s lifeguard when he was wounded at the first battle of Newbury (20 Sept. 1643). By Sept. 1644 he commanded the lifeguard, part of the cavalry which escaped when Essex’s Army surrendered in Cornwall. A premature royalist account of the second battle of Newbury claimed that he had been shot dead when the lifeguard, who had been in the van of the attack, were driven back.

With the creation of the New Model Army, D’Oilie (then of Colonel Graves’s regiment) was appointed commander of Sir Thomas Fairfax’s lifeguard. He went with Cromwell into Oxfordshire in May 1645 and distinguished himself at Naseby. When Fairfax rode up to his lifeguard in the middle of the battle, D’Oilie tried to press on him his own helmet, which the general refused. Then, ‘seeing a body of the King’s foot stand, and not at all broken, he asked D’Oilie if he had charged that body, who answered, that he had twice charged them, but could not break them’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental history, 1.45). A third attack, with D’Oilie charging from the front and Fairfax from the rear, broke them.

Later in the summer the troop was disbanded.

By 12 Aug. he was serving governor of Henley, from where he reported to parliament a mutiny. However, three days earlier the Commons had appointed him governor of Newport Pagnell; he was the candidate for the post of Fairfax, who had proposed him two months earlier.

He entered as governor on 28 Aug. 1645 and later claimed arrears as colonel of the garrison regiment, captain of a troop of horse and governor from 19 Aug. 1645 to 1 Sept. 1646.

On 17 June 1647 a vote passed the Commons that he should be governor of Bristol Fort and Castle, but it was not agreed by both houses. However, when he arrived at Bristol with the commission on 20 July 1647 he carried a commission signed by the Army’s Presbyterian enemies, and Captain Sampson, ‘When he saw the names of Holles, Stapleton, Waller, Lewis, Clotworthy, Massey were at it [the commission], he told Captain D’oyly his commission was signed by those that were impeached by an army that had persevered in their fidelity to the public, which those members had not, and therefore he was resolved to disobey his commission, and live and die with the army; and so the new intended governor was dismissed’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental history, 1.47).

On 27 Dec. 1647 D’Oilie petitioned the Commons for the payment of £1,000 of the arrears due to him, or at least the interest on that sum quarterly. He cited the expenses he had incurred for the post at Bristol from which he had been suspended, and said how he would have gone to Ireland himself ‘though unfit’, if he might have had his regiment with him. But he laid great emphasis on how he had ‘been many times dangerously wounded, by which his health and constitution, formerly strong and sound, have been so greatly impaired, as to render him not only unfit for study, but for any hard service. He has himself suffered great cruelty as a prisoner of war, and has been plundered to his shirt’ (Firth and Davies, Regimental history, 1.47).

What dates there are seem consistent with him being Lieutenant Dormer of Captain Skinner’s troop of dragoons in June 1644. By Dec. 1644 he was a captain in Ralph Weldon’s regiment of Kentish foot. He continued in the regiment after it became part of the New Model Army. In spring 1647 the regiment (now commanded by Robert Lilburne) split over the question of service in Ireland and Dormer was one of those willing to serve there under its lieutenant-colonel, Nicholas Kempson. He was to be major in the regiment which split off from Lilburne’s, and arrested Ensign Nicholls for circulating the Army petition prohibited by parliament. In the events of June-July 1647 this regiment was itself disbanded and Dormer left Lilburne’s regiment.

Armies: London Drake, Sir Francis, second baronet Sir Francis Drake, second baronet (1617-62)

Of Buckland. Colonel of horse [and of foot?]. Eldest son of Sir Francis Drake, first baronet (1588-1637) and his second wife Joan, daughter of Sir William Strode. He married Dorothy (died 1661), daughter of John Pym in Jan. 1641. Hence nephew and son-in-law to two of the Five Members and cousin of Alexander Pym.

Vis. Devon, 301 describes Drake as colonel of the Plymouth regiment of horse; HoP: The Commons, 1660-1690, 1.233, records him as colonel of the Plymouth regiment of foot, 1642-44. Peachey and Turton show payments of £10, £20 and £20 in late 1642 by the mayor of Plymouth to Sir Francis Drake. There is an undated reference to a trooper serving under Colonel Sir Francis Drake; moreover, William Chapman of Plymouth, husbandman, was noted as a trooper under Baronet Drake, wounded at Braddock Down (19 Jan. 1643).

Possibly also commissioned by the earl of Stamford. Captain of a troop of horse in the service of Devon, 22 Sept. 1643-17 Jan. 1643 (if so, the colonelcy may be a later date, but given his status and connections likely that he was a colonel from early in the war). Later colonel of a regiment of horse, also known as the Plymouth regiment from its origins, in Edward Massey’s Western Brigade, 1645-7: on 10 Nov. 1645 he was still its colonel but with his appointment as sheriff of Devon command of the regiment passed to Colonel Eliziar Leighton.

Recruiter MP for Bere Alston (1646), he abstained from attending after Pride’s Purge; MP for Newport in the Convention Parliament of 1660 (where he was totally inactive) and in 1661.

Assuming it is the same person, a much travelled civil war infantry officer. He began the war as major in the earl of Manchester’s regiment of foot and as such fought at the battle of Edgehill as part of Essex’s Army. After a spell as major in Sir William Fairfax’s regiment of foot, from June to Nov. 1643 he was lieutenant-colonel of Thomas Leighton’s regiment of foot. After a spell as a reformado, he moved south and in Sept. 1644 he became lieutenant-colonel in Herbert Morley’s Sussex-based regiment of foot, staying with that regiment until its reduction in spring 1645.

Second son of Sir Francis Drake (1588-1637) of Buckland, first baronet and his second wife Joan, daughter of Sir William Strode (and hence younger brother of Sir Francis Drake). He married Susan, sister of Ellis Crymes.

Drake possibly commanded a Trained Band company in 1642 and took over his brother Sir Francis’s troop on 17 Jan. 1643. He played a notable part in the parliamentarian victory at Sourton Down, near Okehampton (25 Apr. 1643). He was captain of one of the three troops who advanced first upon the enemy and led the first charge, and according to one account ‘skew 12 or 13 with his battle axe and sword…he charged through and through the midst of the Armie’.

Drake later defected to the royalists. On 26 July 1644, the Commons ruled that:

‘Upon the humble Petition of Major Tho. Drake, now in Custody of the Serjeant at Arms; and upon the Report from the Committee of the West, to whom the Consideration of this Business was referred; it is Ordered, That the said Tho. Drake be forthwith discharged from any further Restraint: But he is not to depart the Town, without first acquainting the Committee of the West, and their Leave obtained’ (JHC, 3.570).

Captain-Lieutenant of the colonel’s company in Sir John Gell’s regiment of foot in Derbyshire, serving in the Derby garrison. Twice, in Dec. 1644 and Jan. 1645, he and his men invaded the room of the Derbyshire county committee, presumably over pay. Drinkwater reportedly said, ‘that hee had as good bee killed before 5 as 500 and uttered desperate words’ (Slack, Man at War, 121). Gell, then present, signed a warrant (presumably for pay) without consulting his colleagues on the committee: some followed suit but his enemy Clarke refused and the implication is that Gell was sympathetic and not averse to his men’s protests. Drinkwater was wounded at Stoke on 25 Mar. 1646.

A captain-lieutenant in Cheshire. Identified by a pay warrant dated 16 Dec. 1645, granting him arrears of £5 and acknowledging his service for parliament in Cheshire since 1642. Although perhaps a kinsman of Robert Duckenfeild, Francis is absent from the family pedigree in Earwaker, East Cheshire.

References: TNA, SP28/225.

Armies: Cheshire Duckenfeild, Robert Robert Duckenfeild (1619-1689)

Eldest of seven children of Robert Duckenfeild, esquire (baptised 1597, died 1630), of Duckenfield Hall, Stockport, Cheshire, and his wife Frances (died 1663), daughter of George Preston of Holker, Lancashire. He married (1) before 1662, Martha Fleetwood (died 1669), daughter of Sir Miles Fleetwood of Aldwincle, Northamptonshire, and sister to Charles Fleetwood; (2) Judith Bottomley (1653?–1739), daughter of Nathaniel Bottomley of Cawthorne, Yorkshire.

On Whit Tuesday 1642 Duckenfeild mustered a company of foot under his captaincy at Brinnington Moor, Stockport; in 1647 he was not allowed payment for this service, ‘being no Comysson’, although payment was allowed for his later colonelcy of a regiment of foot (until its disbandment in 1646) and captaincy of a troop of horse. He led his company and a troop of horse during the operations around the siege of Manchester. In Feb. 1643 Duckenfeild brought his company to Sir William Brereton at Nantwich. In Nov. he was commissioned colonel and raised a regiment of foot officered by north-east Cheshire men. In Jan. 1644 he fought at the battle of Nantwich, but in May was among the Cheshire commanders forced to withdraw before Prince Rupert’s advance. In summer 1645 at the siege of Chester he acted as governor of the suburbs in Brereton’s absence. Although his regiment was disbanded in 1647, Duckenfeild succeeded Michael Jones as governor of Chester, occupying the post until 1653. He was commissioned colonel of militia regiments of horse and of foot on 8 July and 22 Aug. 1650 respectively. In 1651 he commanded the force that captured the Isle of Man.

An Independent in religion, who built a chapel for Samuel Eaton at Duckenfeild, in politics in the 1640s he was an ally of his fellow Independent Sir William Brereton. By the mid-1650s, however, Duckenfeild was withdrawing from the regime. In Mar. 1655 he declined a commission as colonel of a regiment of horse, amongst other reasons explaining to Oliver Cromwell his unease about the direction he was taking: ‘Because that the extreames that the levelling party do run furiously upon, doth, as I humbly conceive, drive your highnes upon direct contrary extreames; and I desire to imitate Caleb and Josua in the wildernes, as neare as may be, and not to seeke a confederacy with those, who limitt God to their passions, and against whom God hath an evident controversy, andc. I beleive firmely, that the roote and tree of piety is alive in your lordship, though the leaves theirof, through abundance of temptations and flatteries, seeme to mee to be withered much of late; yet I hope time and experience will have a good influence upon your lordship (Deo juvente) andc.’ (Thurloe state papers, 3, 294).

At the Restoration he lost much of the property he had acquired during and after the civil war and he spent the 1660s under suspicion and occasionally under arrest and imprisoned, in Hull, the Tower and the Isle of Wight. He supported and offered to lead Cheshire forces in support of the Glorious Revolution.

Armies: Lancashire Duett [Dowett], Francis Francis Duett [Dowett]

A Frenchman, earmarked for the Irish expedition in 1642, but instead he began the civil war as a captain or major of horse in the earl of Essex’s Army. He served in Waller’s regiment of horse in 1643, first as a captain and becoming its major by the summer. In Aug. 1643 he may have been appointed colonel of what turned out to be an abortive regiment of horse and he may be the Captain Duett who by 3 Nov. 1643 was commanding a company of foot in Waller’s Army. By August 1644 he was the major of Edmund Ludlow’s regiment of horse. As such, he fought at the second battle of Newbury, though Ludlow claimed that he ensured he and his men were in the rear and so quite safe. He then served for a time in the garrison at Malmesbury, Wiltshire, but defected to the king in spring 1645 and was killed in a skirmish at Lechlade in Wiltshire before the end of the year.

Before Duett changed sides, Mercurius Civicus praised ‘the gallant major’, contrasting his fidelity to the parliamentarian cause with that of other foreign commanders (Stoyle, Soldiers and strangers, 104). After his defection, a royalist newsletter defended his behaviour, to which one pamphlet responded, ‘Aulicus would not have us call Major Dowet a perjured renegade [but] no matter what he is, he is no Englishman, and whether he hath any Christian name I know not’ (Stoyle, Strangers and soldiers, 149, citing Mercurius Britannicus, 25 Aug.-1 Sept. 1645).

In spring 1644 he was made captain in Colonel Edward Apsley’s short-lived and abortive Sussex regiment of foot in Waller’s Southern Association Army, but with the abandonment of that initiative in summer 1644 he entered Waller’s lifeguard, where he served until the disbanding of the lifeguard in spring 1645 when Waller resigned his commission.
