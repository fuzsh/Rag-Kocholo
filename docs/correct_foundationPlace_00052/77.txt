Syed Helmi joined the school this fall as well, as Professor of Practice, with a joint appointment with Engineering Education. Helmi comes to Purdue with a background in both Industrial and Mechanical engineering, having earned BS degrees in both disciplines, the former coming from Clemson University and the latter at the University of Alabama. In addition to this Helmi earned a Master's in Mechanical - Advanced Manufacturing Technology and Ph.D. in Engineering Education. Helmi's IE area of expertise ranges from facilities planning and design, production control and systems modeling and optimization.

Zhe (Jimmy) Zhang will be joining the School of Industrial Engineering in January of 2024. His research aims to address some challenges for engineering, science, and business decisionmaking in the current big data revolution, including the problem complexity due to risk, fairness, and privacy concerns, and the need for distributed algorithms to leverage the big data computing infrastructure. His work has been awarded the firstplace prize in the Alice and John Jarvis Ph.D. Student Paper Competition in the ISyE Department, Georgia Tech. More generally, he is interested in the broad area of machine learning and operations research.
