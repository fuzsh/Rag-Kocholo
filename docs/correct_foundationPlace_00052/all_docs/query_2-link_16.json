Over the last five years we’ve heard from Success Stories, tried to re-Imagine History, looked at InTolerance, explored Trust as a New Currency, searched for the Spark behind Tunisia’s leading women, and reflected on the Differences We Make.\n\nFive years of talks at TEDxCarthage have let us experience how people in Tunisia and around the world are responding to some of the big questions of this Big Time moment we find ourselves in. Now as we mark this 5-year milestone and press on ahead, let’s push against these boundaries we think we know, and discover the great ideas that will rewrite the next five years, and beyond."
