        "text": "Whether it is accelerating the energy transition, improving diagnosis and treatment in healthcare, or the latest applications of artificial intelligence: technology is at the heart of the vast majority of innovations. To get a clear picture of what our country do and do not want to focus on, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate (EZK) is working on a national technology strategy, which will be announced later this year. Read more in the Innovation and Impact Action Plan launched last autumn by ministers Micky Adriaansens (EZK) and Robbert Dijkgraaf of Education, Culture and Science.\n\nCurrent developments\n\nIn preparation for that strategy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs asked TNO and NWO to review the basic list of key enabling technologies from 2018 in the light of current developments in society, science and technology worldwide. Thanks in part to input from a large number of experts, this has resulted in an updated list consisting of eight categories, ranging from advanced materials and chemical technologies to digital and information technologies. These include a total of 44 individual technologies, six fewer than on the original basic list. This is mainly because, in addition to additions and content tightening, several technologies have been merged or consolidated under a broader name.\n\nIntersections and coherence\n\nThe new list reflects, for example, the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, the importance of quantum technology and the climate transition. The descriptions of the clusters and technologies also pay attention to the intersections and coherence between the various key enabling technologies. The ordering focuses on the technology rather than its applications.\n\nWhat are key enabling technologies?\n\nKey enabling technologies have a broad scope or reach in innovations or sectors. They enable breakthrough process, product and service innovations and are essential in solving societal challenges. By creating new business and new markets, they make a large potential contribution to the economy. Research on key enabling technologies can be fundamental, but offers the prospect of medium- or long-term application."
