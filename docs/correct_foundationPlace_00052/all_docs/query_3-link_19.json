        "text": "Public university in Groningen, the Netherlands\n\nThe University of Groningen (abbreviated as UG;[5] Dutch: Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, abbreviated as RUG) is a public research university of more than 30,000 students in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands. Founded in 1614, the university is the second oldest in the country (after Leiden) and one of the most traditional and prestigious universities in the Netherlands.\n\nThe University of Groningen has eleven faculties, nine graduate schools, 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175-degree programmes. The university's alumni and faculty include Johann Bernoulli, Aletta Jacobs, four Nobel Prize winners, nine Spinoza Prize winners, one Stevin Prize winner, various members of the Dutch royal family, several politicians, the first president of the European Central Bank, and a secretary general of NATO.[6][7][8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the Ommelanden, or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.[9][10][11]\n\nThe coat of arms of the university was confirmed by The Estates of the City and County of Groningen in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.\n\nIn the first 75 years of its existence about 100 students enrolled every year.[citation needed] Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first rector magnificus, Ubbo Emmius, came from East Frisia in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region.[citation needed]\n\nThe development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the siege of the city by ‘Bommen Berend’ in 1672.[citation needed] On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period.\n\nDuring the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administered by the Imperial University of Paris. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen). During this time period, it remained the only open university in the Kingdom of Holland.[12] In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. A fire completely destroyed the building in 1906.\n\nIn the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the \"Rijksuniversiteit Groningen\" (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the university was given a research as well as an educational duty.\n\nThe University of Groningen developed during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students grew rapidly. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had grown to 1,000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. In recent times there are about 32,700 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly in recent years.\n\nIn March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the China Agricultural University to establish a campus in the Chinese city of Yantai. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China.[13] The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by censorship in China.[14] In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the \"insufficient support for the project\".[15]\n\nFacts and figures\n\n[edit]\n\nKey facts and figures about the University of Groningen are:[3]\n\nThe university, as of 2020, has 34,000 students enrolled in various programs from the undergraduate level up to doctorate students. This includes 8,250 international students.\n\nThe university currently has 3,600 individuals in its academic staff. The UMCG included, a third of the academic staff is international.\n\n425 full professors\n\n45+ bachelor's degree programmes (35+ bachelor's degree programmes are taught in English)\n\n120+ master's degree programmes taught in English\n\n40+ research master's and top programmes[16]\n\n11 faculties (one in the Frisian capital of Leeuwarden), nine graduate schools\n\n140,000 alumni\n\n120+ nationalities\n\n8,000 research publications\n\n4,350 PhD candidates (51% international)\n\n1.0 billion EUR budget\n\nResearch grants from the Dutch Research Council (NWO): 14 starting grants (Veni), 5 experienced research grants (Vidi) and 4 senior research grants (Vici) awarded in 2020\n\nResearch grants from the European Research Council (ERC): 1 Starting Grant, 1 Consolidator Grant, 3 Advanced Grants and 1 Proof of Concept Grant awarded in 2020\n\n18 patent applications in 2020\n\nThe university operates under the BSA system, under which a first year undergraduate (bachelor) student must achieve a certain number of ECTS in order to progress to the second year. This varies from 30 ECTS to 45 ECTS among various degrees.[17]\n\nRUG has its own newspaper: the Universiteitskrant [nl].[18]\n\nThe university's Center for Information Technology (CIT) houses an IBM Blue Gene/L supercomputer and data center of Target used by the LOFAR project as well as a Virtual Reality and 3D-visualisation center.[19]\n\nRankings and reputation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Groningen (RUG) is a member of the so-called Excellence Group of universities in Europe. The Excellence Group has 56 members, which is 1.3 percent of the approximately 4,500 European institutions of higher education.[26]\n\nRUG belongs to the top 100 large comprehensive research universities in the world.[27]\n\nRUG was #80 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021.[28]\n\nAccording to the 2019 U.S. News & World Report, the Faculty of Economics and Business ranks as 3rd in The Netherlands, 10th in Europe and 32nd in the world for Economics and Business.[29]\n\nIn 2021, the university ranked #64 in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).[30] In addition to this overall score, the university falls within the global top 100 for several specific fields and subjects: Psychology (41), Clinical Medicine (51-75), Business Administration (37), Ecology (51-75).\n\nRUG was ranked #139 worldwide in the QS WUR 2024.\n\nThe university was ranked #73 worldwide in 2019 by the National Taiwan University that publishes the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities.[31]\n\nThe Webometrics placed the university #85 worldwide and #14 in Europe.[32]\n\nThe university was ranked 3rd place in the UI GreenMetric World University Ranking in 2021, which includes 780 universities. UI GreenMetric World University Rankings was launched by Universitas Indonesia (UI) to focus awareness on sustainability in university policy-making. Universities are ranked in the basis of self-reported data in the areas of Setting and Infrastructure, Energy and Climate Change, Waste, Water, Transportation, and Education and Research.[33]\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the university was ranked 91st place in the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR).[34]\n\nIn 2019, Times Higher Education introduced a new ranking: the Europe Teaching Rankings. The university was ranked 26th place, which includes more than 200 universities. This new ranking focusses on higher education institutions' teaching quality and learning environments for students.[35]\n\nThe university was ranked 1st in The Netherlands by U-Multirank (UMR)in 2019. UMR was developed by a consortium consisting of the Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies (CHEPS) in Twente, the Centre for Higher Education (CHE) in Germany and the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) in Leiden. The university achieved the highest score on 16 indicators that include International Orientation dimension, Research and Knowledge Transfer.[36]\n\nThe Faculty of Economics and Business is accredited by both AACSB and EQUIS.[37]\n\nOrganisation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe RUG has 6,250 employees.[38]\n\nThe university library was renovated between 2013 and 2017.[39] The RUG has a branch in Leeuwarden.[40] Plans to establish a \"branch campus\" in China's Yantai were called off in January 2018, and the University Museum is now in the process of being established.[41]\n\nThe University of Groningen is represented in the Academic Heritage Foundation, a foundation that aims to preserve university collections and cultural treasures.[42]\n\nFaculties\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Groningen is organized in eleven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, law, economics and business, spatial sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences and technology. Each faculty (cf., College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers bachelor's, master's, PhD, and exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.\n\nSince 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent liberal arts college, University College Groningen (UCG).[43][44]\n\nFaculty of Economics and Business\n\nFaculty of Arts\n\nFaculty of Law\n\nFaculty of Religion, Culture and Society\n\nFaculty of Philosophy\n\nFaculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences\n\nFaculty of Medical Sciences\n\nFaculty of Science and Engineering\n\nFaculty of Spatial Sciences\n\nUniversity College Groningen\n\nCampus Fryslân [nl]\n\nNational Cooperation\n\n[edit]\n\nExposome-NL, Dutch consortium cooperating in the field of exposome research.\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Groningen engages in many types of international cooperation throughout both teaching and research. The main networks and partners[45] of the university are:\n\nEnlight,[46] an alliance of nine European universities, The Guild[47] of European research-intensive universities and the Coimbra group,[48] a network of 37 long established European multidisciplinary universities.\n\nStrategic partnerships (academic connection): Universität Hamburg (UHH) and Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg\n\nGlobal strategic partnerships: Nanyang Technological University (Singapore), Osaka University (Japan), Macquarie University (Australia), Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia), Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia), Universidad de Chile (Chile), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Mexico), Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil), Stellenbosch University (South Africa)\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university's original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the Broerstraat. The faculty of medical sciences is located close by at the University Medical Center Groningen(UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after Nobel Prize winner Frits Zernike. The Zernike campus is also shared by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.[49]\n\nThe university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The library at the city center also has a Starbucks on its premises. The university has also recently opened another campus in Leeuwarden, Friesland, referred to as \"Campus Fryslân\", that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.[50]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Groningen is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city's residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. The university, through ACLO,[51] offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.[52]\n\nThe university also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.\n\nThe use of bicycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as \"The World Cycling City\" because of this.[53]\n\nStudent housing\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Groningen does not have student accommodation. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via SSH Student Housing, which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands.[54] A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however, a recent addition to the housing options for students is The Student Hotel as well. In an effort to combat the annual housing shortage, the city of Groningen has incentivized the construction of short-term accommodation such as The Village which is made of shipping containers for international students.[55] The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.[56]\n\nIn 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students.[57] Especially in the fall semester of 2021 the housing crisis hit its peak with hundreds of students reportedly not having any accommodation and resorting to emergency shelters. [58] The housing shorting evoked a protest in the city centre which culminated in the Academy building being temporarily occupied by students to put pressure on the city to extend emergency housing. [59]\n\nResearch\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2019, 708 PhD students were admitted to a PhD programme (compared to 816 in 2018). Around 50% of the admitted PhD students came from abroad. In 2019, a total of 546 PhDs took place, 22 of them cum laude. The national share was thus around 11%.[60]\n\nResearch schools, centres and institutes\n\n[edit]\n\nHumanities and Social Sciences\n\nCenter for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG)\n\nCentre for Religion and Heritage\n\nCentre for Religion, Conflict and Globalization (CRCG)\n\nCentre Religion, Health and Wellbeing\n\nCRASIS, Culture, Religion and Society in Graeco-Roman Antiquity\n\nGlobalisation Studies Groningen (GSG)\n\nGroningen Institute of Archeology (GIA)\n\nGroningen Institute for Educational research (GION)\n\nGroningen Research Institute of Philosophy (GRIPH)\n\nGroningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG)\n\nHeymans Institute\n\nInstitute of Indian Studies\n\nInteruniversity Center for Social Science Theory and Methodology (ICS)\n\nQumran Institute\n\nUrban and Regional Studies Institute (URSI)\n\nLaw\n\nCentre for Law, Administration and Society (CRBS)\n\nGroningen Centre of Energy Law (GCEL)\n\nEconomics & Business\n\nSOM research institute\n\nLife Sciences\n\nResearch School of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCN) / UMCG[61]\n\nResearch Institute BCN-BRAIN / UMCG[62]\n\nCancer Research Center Groningen (CRCG) / UMCG[63]\n\nGroningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences (GELIFES)[64]\n\nGroningen University Institute for Drug Exploration (GUIDE) / UMCG[65]\n\nGroningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology (GBB)\n\nGroningen Research Institute of Pharmacy (GRIP)\n\nScience in Healthy Ageing and healthcaRE (SHARE), UMCG[66]\n\nW.J.
