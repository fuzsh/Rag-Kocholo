        "text": "Hi,\n\nit looks like the behaviour of push/pull has changed. In previous version you could select as many face as you want for push pull as long as you haven't yet started pushing or pulling. That made it easy to do multiple push/pull at once. After you started moving the arrow clicking another face was seens as a \"push coplanar to this face\" command. I found that handy overall.\n\nNow with the latest version this has changed i can't yet find out what the rules are. Sometimes i could select multiple faces, another time clicking the second face directly pushes or pulls the first selected face coplanar to this face. As the user interface once again gives no idea to how this is intended to work. The short help bubble that dissappears quicker than i can read it sounds like it should still be like it was in earlier versions (and yes, i just found out i can pin this bubbles).\n\nAny help for how this should be working now?\n\n---\n\nFrank / @helmi\n\nEstablished 1974. Internet addicted since 1994. Collector of Kudos.\n\nHi Helmi,\n\nI think that what you are seeing here is the behavior of Press/Pull in a parametric design. In a parametric design, Fusion interprets Press/Pull as a \"smart\" edit operation. If the Press/Pull is on a face of a Feature, we can turn the edit into an edit of the feature. For instance, on an extruded rectangle:\n\nI show the sketch as visible to show the orientation of the feature. In this case, if I press/pull on a side face, this is interpreted as a move of the underlying sketch line from that face:\n\nHere you can see that the sketch is being modified. In this mode, you are limited to one face at a time (because Fusion can only drive one sketch line at a time). This behavior has been part of Fusion since the introduction of parametric design in January. This is a difference in behavior from Direct Modeling. You can get the Direct behavior, although the workflow today is a bit awkard (and we are working to improve it). When you start Press/Pull, select one face. Then, in the dialog, for Offset Type, choose New Offset:\n\nThen, you will get a behavior that is closer to the Direct Modeling behavior - you can select multiple faces:\n\nAnd note, the sketch is not updated in this mode. Instead, this operation will add a new Offset feature to your timeline:\n\nI hope this sheds some light on the behavior you are seeing. And thank you for the feedback - your input has caused us to realize that the behavior may be surprising, and we are re-thinking how to present this capability.\n\nJeff Strater (Fusion development)\n\nJeff Strater\n\nEngineering Director"
