        "text": "College Intern of the Year: Mason Gordon (Purdue University)\n\nMason Gordon spent three of his four years at Purdue University interning with the city of Rushville. During that time, he built strong relationships and contributed to multiple meaningful projects. The skills Gordon built, however, were put to the test in 2020.\n\nAs COVID-19 reached Rushville, Gordon led a team of interns in reaching out to more than 500 companies to proactively measure the impact of the virus on the city’s economy. Through those calls, Gordon and his team collected valuable data and gathered key contact information so the city could easily communicate information about its COVID-19 response and various funding opportunities.\n\nRushville intends to continue using the list of contact information Gordon gathered for the city’s business retention and expansion efforts.\n\nGordon’s impact didn’t stop there. He led the city’s intern team in managing a program called Rush Back to Local Business. The initiative raised $20,000 to help incentivize a gift card program to boost the local economy during the shutdown period. That led to the city selling nearly $60,000 in local gift cards in just three hours.\n\nHe also worked with the Heart of Rushville to submit and receive COVID-19 grants. Through his efforts, Gordon secured two grants totaling $11,700 for the organization.\n\nGordon’s passion for rural development and his experience with the city of Rushville has led him to pursuing a master’s degree for rural futures planning and innovation at the National University of Ireland Galway. He’s attending the university thanks to being selected as a Mitchell Scholar. Gordon is only the second Purdue student to receive that scholarship.\n\nCollege Intern of the Year: Erin Moher (Indiana University)\n\nDuring her internship with netlogx, Erin Moher wasn’t afraid of making major contributions to the company’s culture. The importance of diversity and inclusion within organizations was highlighted during 2020. Moher coordinated with netlogx’s Learning Management System (LMS) administrator to develop a companywide workshop. She arranged training materials, discussion questions and communications for the release of netlogx’s Diversity and Inclusion Workshop.\n\nAlong with leading netlogx’s diversity and inclusion initiative, Moher’s leadership continued to shine through the other training courses she created in the LMS. With the help of a fellow intern, she recorded the Intern Series to explain what is expected of the company’s interns, what the interns should expect of netlogx and how to juggle an extended internship as a college student. She also created multiple training videos focusing on home security and Zoom that greatly helped fellow employees as they transitioned to working from home.\n\nMoher also made sure netlogx’s team members felt connected while working remotely. She hosted a Halloween costume contest during one of the company’s biweekly virtual support sessions. Through her active involvement with netlogx’s Wellness Committee, Moher worked with the committee leader to finalize how the company’s Team Step Challenge would continue virtually.\n\n“Erin is the epitome of what interns are able to do when extended smart trust,” says Abbey Szentes, a human resource and internal support assistant at netlogx.\n\nHigh School Intern of the Year: Kelly Burnham (Woodlan Junior/Senior High School, Woodburn)\n\nSenior Kelly Burnham is part of her high school’s Interdisciplinary Cooperative Education program. Through the program, she works as a certified nursing assistant (CNA) in the dementia wing at Miller’s Merry Manor in Fort Wayne. Throughout her two years as a CNA, Burnham became a steady source of comfort to the special population within the nursing home.\n\n“She always shows kindness, gentleness and patience with every resident she comes into contact with,” notes Brooke Ebersole, director of nursing. “She provides all aspects of care for them, and they have come to trust her and depend on her.”\n\nBurnham consistently works with the nursing home’s administration to promote high-quality care to new admissions. She also helps new CNA students who come into Miller’s Merry Manor. She assists with floor duties and gives advice and guidance on how to care for each resident in a dignified way.\n\nBurnham received the Miller’s Merry Manor Employee of the Month award for March 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. She earned the honor based on her ability to help and monitor conditions when other nurses were not available to assist.\n\nAfter high school, Burnham plans to pursue a bachelor’s degree in nursing with a specialization in health, labor and delivery.\n\nNon-Traditional Intern of the Year: Jake McCarty (The Garrett Companies, Greenwood)\n\nJake McCarty started his internship with The Garrett Companies during the COVID-19 pandemic. That meant he would be working remotely like the rest of the organization. However, he didn’t let that stop him from taking on major projects, impressing the team with his time management and making new connections.\n\nWithin two weeks of beginning his internship, McCarty established YouTube channels for five business locations and populated the channels with video content created from photography assets. Eventually, he also began pitching articles he wrote for the company’s corporate and residential locations to area businesses and municipalities. The city of Greenwood picked up his article “Investing in our Hometown” and tripled its online reach.\n\nDespite working from home, McCarty made many connections within The Garrett Companies by managing its new hire promotions process for the marketing department. This role gave him the unique opportunity to meet and correspond with the nearly 35 new hires that joined the organization during his internship. His warm personality and friendly approach were the perfect fit for making each new hire feel comfortable and special, shares Nikkie Crosby, McCarty’s immediate supervisor. “Nearly every day someone was stopping by my office or chatting me in instant message to say how much they loved Jake and how glad they were that he was on the team.”\n\nCareer Development Professional of the Year (college): Jan Nickless (Indiana University)\n\nIndiana and Purdue universities don’t always set aside their sports rivalry, but when it comes to Jan Nickless, representatives from both schools agree that she’s a superstar. Nickless was nominated twice, once by colleagues from each school. She served as the senior associate director of experiential education at the Indiana University Career Development Center.\n\nNickless developed innovative student employment and mentoring programming to assist Pell Grant and exploratory students. In January 2021, Nickless’ plan to centralize all on-campus part-time jobs and internships through university human resources took effect, making it much easier for students to find opportunities.\n\nShe also led the charge with IU legal counsel, former IIN Executive Director Janet Boston and others to establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that allows internships to be shared from Indiana INTERNnet with the university’s customer service management system. That MOU has served as a template for IIN as it extended partnerships with other Indiana colleges and universities.\n\nWhile Nickless’ impact is impressive, it’s her customer service and kindness that makes her stand out. No matter if she’s working with a major Indiana employer or a freshman student coming to see a career coach for the first time, Nickless treats everyone with the same level of care.\n\nAfter 37 years in higher education and career development, Nickless retired at the end of 2020.\n\nCareer Development Professional of the Year (high school): Lori Heuer (Columbia City High School, Whitley County)\n\nIn her role with Whitley County Consolidated Schools, Lori Heuer developed a four-year career connective program called Whitley Works for students at Columbia City High School. This program offers career exploration and work-based learning opportunities for students by connecting them to area businesses – through mentorships when they are freshmen, career interviews for sophomores, job shadows for juniors and internships for seniors.\n\nHeuer likes to think outside of the box for the benefit of her students and her community. She helps students discover what they’re good at and their interests before connecting them to adults and businesses that can help them further develop their skills and explore those interests.\n\nAt the educational level, Heuer collaborates with school counselors to consider how the work-based experience may align to graduation requirements (including Graduation Pathways) or enhance the student’s high school educational experience. She acknowledges that her work is not done independently from other high school counselors and teachers. Through her efforts, she has placed 391 students in internships and worked with 165 employers in Whitley County and northeast Indiana.\n\nIntern Supervisor of the Year: Cindy McCullough (BGBC Partners, LLP, Indianapolis)\n\nEach year, Cindy McCullough’s colleagues at BCBG Partners, LLP know where to find her during the months of January to April. She’s camped out in a room with the company’s interns. She dedicates her time to maximize their learning and development experiences while also engaging them in fun activities. Even when the company transitioned to working remotely, McCullough made it a focus to keep the interns involved.\n\nDuring the three-month internship program, McCullough intentionally focuses on understanding each interns’ skill levels and how to maximize their growth. Then, she aligns that with available projects. On the personal side, McCullough works to create a friendly, warm and accepting atmosphere for the interns so that they can develop their skills in a low-stress environment. She treats each intern with patience and care.\n\nMcCullough’s commitment is always to the individual, ensuring she meets with each intern on a weekly basis. She also advocates for the interns as they enter the professional workforce. Because of their positive experience, many of the interns join the firm after finishing their internship. This is critical to BCBG’s strategy for developing, evaluating and securing talent.\n\nEmployer of the Year (for-profit): RJL Solutions (Terre Haute)\n\nTrust is a key component to RJL Solutions’ internship program. During their experience, interns are entrusted with important projects and challenging assignments that are necessary to the success of clients and the company. Interns are assets to the team and are expected to perform as such.\n\nRJL Solutions’ internship program was developed over a three-year period by a current employee who began her journey as one of the first RJL Solutions interns. The program provides interns with dependent positions in their respective departments that allow them to have the proper training, experience and consulting opportunities to prepare them for their future desired careers.\n\nA major component to RJL Solutions’ program is a group project of the interns’ choice in order to exercise their passions in the various industries RJL has clients in. At the end of the internship, the interns present their finished project to the entire RJL team.\n\nAlso, on a weekly basis, interns come together with the internship program coordinator for one hour or more to learn about a relevant topic of the business world or their specific industries. These sessions help them prepare for life outside of their undergrad experience, whether that is going back to school for graduate and certificate studies or entering the workforce.\n\nEmployer of the Year (non-profit): The International Center (Indianapolis)\n\nAs some Hoosier employers either scaled back or canceled their 2020 internship programs due to COVID-19, the International Center expanded and adapted to incorporate virtual, in-person and hybrid experiences. It hired 27 interns into their 2020 internship program with all of them from Indiana colleges and universities.\n\nThe International Center’s 2020 interns helped them quickly adapt their traditional plans. When they needed to pivot their fundraising endeavors, interns helped plan and execute a drive-in fundraiser. They helped the Center shift their five-month international leadership program to be hosted virtually. The International Center values each intern for the skills and education they bring to the table.\n\nEach intern is supported by a supervisor for their work, the leadership team for their professional mentorship and an ambassador for their organization and cultural orientation. The Center’s COO also worked with the staff, board and community leaders to identify additional opportunities for interns to participate in high-level events and meetings. While the intern may serve the organization during their semester, the International Center’s staff commits to serving the intern throughout their education and professional journey.\n\nDavid R. McKinnis Community Partner\n\nTechPoint (Indianapolis)\n\nIn 2012, TechPoint launched the Xtern Program. The 10-week program provides internship opportunities to more than 100 students from around the country with Indianapolis tech companies. The interns also participate in cultural and networking activities that show off what the city has to offer. Xtern plays a crucial role in attracting and retaining future Indiana tech leaders.\n\nThe year 2020 threw the Xtern Program into limbo. The five-person talent team sprang into action and fully reimagined Xtern in fewer than six weeks. While many of the Xtern companies made their internships virtual, some unfortunately had to cancel their programs.\n\nThat’s where the Summer Opportunities for Students (S.O.S) Challenge came to the rescue. The S.O.S. Challenge provided work experience and $250,000 in stipends to 500 students from Indiana colleges and universities who lost summer internships due to COVID-19 cuts.\n\nStudents worked in teams on a COVID-related challenge. Those who completed the program received $500 each in addition to the chance at a $25,000 prize purse and giving virtual presentations to Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana tech sector leaders.\n\n2020 Indiana INTERNnet IMPACT Awards Nominees (Winners Bolded):\n\nInterns\n\nKira Axsiom, GrantSelect / Littleberry Press (Bloomington)\n\nAndrea Axsom, GrantSelect / Littleberry Press (Seymour)\n\nIdriss Bah, enFocus (South Bend)\n\nMack Bell, Olympus Properties (Bloomington)\n\nSeth Biggs, Fuson Automotive, Inc.
