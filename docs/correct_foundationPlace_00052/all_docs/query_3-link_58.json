        "text": "Assistive learning technologies are products that are aimed at assisting people with disabilities in improving their learning with minimum intervention of caregivers. Their efficacy has been assessed by means of experimental research trials. An experiment is characterized by the treatments and experimental units to be used, the way treatments are assigned to units, and the responses that are measured. The treatments and experimental units require representative participants or sample. However, because of the limits of numbers of participants or sample sizes, such kinds of studies have been delicate but challenging experiences. This paper attempts to review such valuable research experiences.\n\nThis article offers a socio-technical framing of assistive technology design for in-classroom use to enable a better understanding of how to improve educational opportunities and outcomes for learners with disabilities. By addressing social inequities in public education and recognizing user-centered design faults and inadequacies in the current implementation of assistive technology in the educational environment, this paper focuses on understanding the experiences of learners with disabilities. This article discusses challenges faced when adopting such technology and the effects of the current well-intentioned but flawed implementation of assistive technology. The authors highlight the limitations and shortcomings of the current approaches portrayed in previous research and educational practices. The article concludes with a call for a socio-technical approach to the adoption of assistive technology to augment the learning experience for a more inclusive atmosphere, and encourages...\n\nLearning disabilities are neurologically-based processing or performing disabilities that can hinder one in daily activities, more specifically in education, as our conventional education institutes do not support differently-abled people. However, children with disabilities are just as smart as their fellow students and it is evident from research, that with the right assistance, they can excel academically. This research paper takes a deep dive into assistive technologies and how they have influenced students with learning disabilities in the classroom. The various types of assistive technologies have additionally been dissected, with their influence and impact on schools in general. This research paper will list the different fields in which, assistive devices can be utilized, and how they could further be developed to provide students with the right avail or assistance to excel at educational institutions. Learning disabilities can be hard for individuals, making them less likely to succeed at doing tasks related to academics. Assistive devices help students in writing, reading, and organizing, which will be further explained in this research paper.\n\nThis paper was written to expose the meaning, benefits, and answer why the use of assistive technology for children with learning disabilities. The paper discussed the various types of assistive technology devices that were designed and used to solve written language, reading, listening, memory and mathematic problems of children with learning disabilities. It pointed out the need for selecting the right technology tools for the children with learning disabilities, to enable achievement of the target goals, and highlighted instructional guides for the classroom teachers, that would make children with learning disabilities benefit maximally from the use of assistive technology tools, whether in the classroom or at home, in order that the technology would make the teaching – learning process enjoyable and productive. The possible challenges faced by developing nations in using assistive technology were mentioned. It concluded that there was potential for assistive technology to improv...\n\nAssistive Learning Technologies (ALT) have gained increasing research attention for supporting physically-disadvantaged learners to realize their potential in the educational process. This paper reports on a multiple-case study that sought to explore the underlying mechanisms (i.e., the how and why issues) relating to the role of ALT in helping students with special needs to circumvent their disabilities and integrating them into the mainstream schools. It is found that the use of ALT enables the subjects to access the electronic learning environment, as well as improve their time management. The end result is that these students can perform their everyday (learning) tasks on par with their peers in school. The study has also unveiled moderating factors influencing the usage of ALT; examples are the ease of use of ALT, and the subjects’ desire to enhance their academic and social competency."
