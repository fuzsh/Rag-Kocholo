        "text": "The shrike recovery program has seen a number of successes to date. We are learning more about the threats to the wild population, and thousands of acres of habitat have been restored or improved.\n\nSince 2003, the conservation breeding program has released over 1,300 young birds in Ontario!\n\nNot only are many of these birds returning the following spring, some are returning year after year. In 2012, for example, a six-year-old female released in 2006 returned to pair with a wild male — solid evidence that the field breeding and release techniques are working.\n\nUp to 36% of shrikes spotted in the wild have been birds released from our conservation breeding program in previous years. The majority of these birds pair successfully with wild mates and contribute a significant number of young to the wild population.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to gather clues about where our Ontario birds go during the winter, and how they get there. So far, we have evidence that a portion of Ontario eastern loggerhead shrikes winter in both the north- and south-eastern United States, and there is a clear link with the Virginias, with birds banded in Ontario seen in Virginia, and vice versa. Tracking data has so far revealed two potential migratory strategies in Ontario, with some birds heading southwest to pass in to the U.S. around Windsor, and others appearing to head more directly south to hop across Lake Ontario. Lately we’ve also tracked birds migrating through Pennsylvania during both their spring and fall migrations, and with each year of tracking data collected the picture of shrike movements to and from Ontario is coming into clearer focus.\n\nWe have proven that we can breed shrikes capable of surviving and thriving in the wild. Birds released from our conservation breeding program have successfully migrated south and returned to Ontario at a rate at least as high as their wild-born counterparts. According to population viability analyses conducted in 2009 and 2015, conservation breeding alone is unlikely to restore the wild population to a self-sustaining level. However, the release of young birds has certainly had a stabilizing effect and the situation would be even worse without the breeding effort. The graph below shows the number of birds that have been found in the wild in the two main core areas, Carden and Napanee, since Wildlife Preservation Canada took over program coordination.\n\nReleases began in Carden in 2005 and in Napanee in 2012, and populations in each area nearly doubled in the years following those efforts. Though it’s difficult to attribute those upturns in the population to any one factor, the release of juveniles has certainly had a positive effect on the numbers of birds we’ve seen in the wild, as birds coming from the conservation breeding program have averaged 20-30% of the wild population in recent years.\n\nSo far, the conservation breeding program is doing its job: keeping eastern loggerhead shrike present in Canada while we work to discover and address the causes of loss during the migration cycle. Once we address those causes, the conservation breeding will be an essential tool in helping the wild population begin to grow again.\n\nThe techniques we have developed can also be applied beyond eastern loggerhead shrikes. An external review of the conservation breeding program in 2008 suggested that it would ultimately provide a model for future recovery programs for other shrikes in North America and — even more broadly — for other migratory songbirds at risk.\n\nEastern Loggerhead Shrike Annual Reports\n\n2023 Field Report\n\n2022 Field Report\n\n2021 Field Report\n\n2020 Field Report\n\n2019 Field Report\n\n2018 Field Report\n\n2017 Field Report\n\n2016 Field Report\n\n2015 Field Report\n\n2014 Field Report2013 Field Report2012 Field Report2011 Field Report2010 Field Report\n\n2009 Field Report\n\nHome on the Range Newsletter\n\nFrom the archives\n\nFall/Winter 2017\n\nSpring/Summer 2017\n\nFall/Winter 2016\n\nSpring/Summer 2016\n\nPublications\n\nHudecki, J., Wheeler, H., and A.
