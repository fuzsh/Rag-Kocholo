        "text": "5/23/2022 > --- TOUR--- Tour of Marian University EcoLab >Speaker: Zach Sylvain (Email: zsylvain@marian.edu) Sponsored By: peggy sabens Rick Whitener (ID: 481)Tour of Marian University EcoLab. The Nina Mason Pulliam EcoLab is a 75-acre natural area on campus. It is a highly biodiverse area with rare wetland habitats and threatened animal species with a few miles of downtown Indianapolis. The goal is to restore and protect these lands for current and future residents. They offer field trip programs for students at several level and opportunities for older students to work on research projects. Our host will be Zach Sylvain, director of the facility. The tour is mostly outdoors over some uneven terrain. You need not be a mountain climber but we will probably cover more than a mile during the visit. The center is located at 3200 Cold Springs Road. There is parking by the Nature Center for those with limited walking range. Much more parking is on the east side of Cold Springs road near the Major Taylor Velodrome. To sign up for this tour, please send an email to RWhitener17@gmail.com , a text message to Rick at 317-345-0727 or call him at that number. We need your sign-ups by Tuesday, May 17. There is no charge for the tour, but getting the number attending will help our host plan for our visit. Please plan to arrive around 11:45 AM for the tour to begin at noon. We expect to finish shortly after 1:00 PM.

We're protecting urban forests to generate carbon offsets. Eli Lilly has been involved for the past year and said they'll purchase these offsets. The problem, though is that they'll need 20X more offsets than what this project will produce. So we're also launching a for-profit startup company to reforest Indian. Based on forecasted demand we think we can reforest 2M acres of Indiana by 2040, eventually generating $3.36B in annual carbon offset revenues for landowners.

But when the invasion actually came in Ferbuary of 2022, the havoc was far worse than I had imagined. The displacement of millions of Ukrainians is the largest refugee crisis of this century. I thought my medical service and goodwill might offer some comfort to these victims of war, particularly at the end of their long and hazardous exodus. Therefore, I spent a month at a refugee center in Budapest, living and eating in the same quarter as they do, and treating those who had fallen ill. It is an experience I will carry with me for the rest of my days and I like to share it with my Scientech friends in this talk.

Almost all these districts feature a Seat-Time-Model that empowers an expensive educational bureaucracy rather than teachers and students. Staff shortages, bureaucratic paralysis, school violence, and unprecedented levels of public anger over school curricula are causing this feudal educational system to collapse in the most vulnerable areas. The MIT Open Learning structure, built around a Mastery Learning Model, is restructuring (and saving) higher education. Can it also save secondary education? With some slight modifications, the answer is yes.

It represents the first powered and fully controlled atmospheric flight on any celestial body beyond Earth, with the intention of studying the entire surface over its two-year mission for extraterrestrial habitability. Titan is a fascinating place, having a thick atmosphere of nitrogen and methane and an abundant, complex, and diverse carbon-rich chemistry on the surface of a water-ice-dominated world with an interior water ocean, making it a high-priority target for astrobiology and origin of life studies. Join us as we examine this innovative flying machine which is much like a large quadcopter with 3-foot diameter double rotors, or an octocopter. With lithium-ion batteries and a plutonium-powered electrical generator, Dragonfly can cruise the skies of Titan at 22 mph and climb to an altitude of 13,000 ft. Dragonfly is expected to launch in June 2027 and will take seven years to reach Titan, 850 million miles from Earth, arriving by 2034, and landing at a location on the surface of Titan named called Shangri-La.

With no available treatments for the disease, patients there could only expect to receive final care. Once symptoms developed, most died within two years. The 1910 miracle drug for syphilis, Salvarsan 606, had no effect on neurosyphilis, but could one deadly disease be used to treat another? In this talk, Sarah Halter will discuss the development and efficacy of malaria therapy for neurosyphilis, its use at Central State Hospital beginning in 1925, and the gradual abandonment of it in favor of penicillin in the late 1940s.
