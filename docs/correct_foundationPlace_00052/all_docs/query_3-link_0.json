        "meta_description": "Purpose HELMi (Health and Early Life Microbiota) is a longitudinal, prospective general population birth cohort, set up to identify environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors that modify the intestinal microbiota development in the first years of life and their relation to child health and well-being.\n\nParticipants The HELMi cohort consists of 1055 healthy term infants born in 2016–2018 mainly at the capital region of Finland and their parents. The intestinal microbiota development of the infants is characterised based on nine, strategically selected, faecal samples and connected to extensive online questionnaire-collected metadata at weekly to monthly intervals focusing on the diet, other exposures and family’s lifestyle as well as the health and growth of the child. Motor and cognitive developmental screening takes place at 18 months. Infant’s DNA sample, mother’s breast milk sample and both parent’s spot faecal samples have been collected.\n\nFindings to date The mean age of the mothers was 32.8 (SD 4.1) and fathers/coparents 34.8 (5.3) years at the time of enrolment. Seventeen percentage (n=180) of the infants were born by caesarean section. Just under half (49%) were firstborns; 50.7% were males. At 3 months of age, 86% of the babies were exclusively breastfed and 2% exclusively formula-fed.\n\nFuture plans The current follow-up from pregnancy to first 24 months will be completed in March 2020, totalling to over 10 000 biological samples and over 50 000 questionnaire entries. The results are expected to identify environmental and host factors that affect early gut microbiota development and health, and hence give indications of how to prevent or reverse microbiota perturbations in infancy. This prospective cohort will be followed up further to identify how the early microbiota relates to later health outcomes, especially weight gain, infections and allergic and other chronic diseases.\n\nTrial registration number [NCT03996304][1]; Pre-results.\n\n [1]: /lookup/external-ref?link_type=CLINTRIALGOV&access_num=NCT03996304&atom=%2Fbmjopen%2F9%2F6%2Fe028500.atom",

        "text": "Biological samples\n\nStool samples: Nine stool samples from the infants are collected at the age of 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks and 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. In addition, for a subset of 66 infants, daily sampling was performed during the 1st, 6th and/or 12th month as part of a HELMiPlus subproject. Parents were asked to provide a spot stool sample around the time of childbirth, preferably within 2 weeks of the due date. Parents collect the faecal samples at home, freeze them immediately at −20°C and transport in a frozen form to the laboratory for −80°C storage. Faecal samples are processed for the intestinal microbiota analysis using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.\n\nBreast milk sample: Breastfeeding mothers were requested to give a breast milk sample at 3 months postpartum at the clinic. Mothers gave a milk sample by hand expression from an uncleaned breast from which they had not fed for a minimum of 1 hour. When needed, the nurse assisted the expression aseptically. The first 0.5 mL was discarded after which a 1 mL sample was collected in a chemically clean cup and transferred to freezing phial aseptically. Samples were temporarily stored at −20°C before transfer to −80°C.\n\nDNA sample: Buccal swabs from the infants were collected at 3 months for the extraction of genomic DNA. All children are being genotyped for FUT2 gene that determines whether mucosal glycans contain terminal fucose-sugar residues that are known to mediate interactions between gut microbes and the host, FUT2 representing the first single gene variant that was associated to microbiota composition in humans.14 FUT2 genotyping is performed in collaboration with the Finnish Red Cross using a previously described single nucleotide polymorphism analysis method.14\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nWe collect a large amount of data on the families’ lifestyle, environmental exposures and the health of the study infants and their parents using online questionnaires that store the answers instantly on an online database, enabling monitoring and data query already during the data collection. After providing basic information on the neonate, including the birth date, gender, gestational age and birth weight, parents were prompted to fill in recurring questionnaires on child’s nutrition, gut function and care practices weekly for the first 4 months, then biweekly until 7 months and finally monthly until 2 years of child’s age (figure 2). In addition, parents fill in comprehensive questionnaires regarding living conditions and infant behaviour and health at 3 month intervals. At child’s age 1 and 2, additional questionnaires on diet and motor development are administered. The start and end date for illnesses, medication and use of probiotics and other dietary supplements are reported in a continuous manner using a study diary. To promote compliance in the questionnaire response rates, parents receive automatic reminders via email and text messages.\n\nNutrition: Breastfeeding and use of infant formula are monitored at weekly to monthly frequency, with an estimate of percent-based and volume-based share of formula in partially breastfed infants before weaning. For the first 7 months, parents indicated at weekly to biweekly intervals for breastfed infants whether they received the milk from the breast or whether it was pumped. We record data on timing and type of introduced solid foods and monitor which food ingredients are intentionally avoided. At child’s age 1 and 2, parents fill food frequency questionnaires for the infant and themselves. Families that collected daily faecal samples from the infant as part of the HELMiPlus subproject also filled a daily food diary for the infant.\n\nGrowth: Weight and height trajectories are recorded based on the 12 measurements taken at child welfare clinic during the first 24 months, according to the Finnish public health system.\n\nHealth and well-being: Infants’ crying, gastrointestinal function (based on questions, eg, on regurgitation, stool frequency, consistency and colour, signs of stomach ache and flatulence) and skin health are monitored with the recurring questionnaires. Child’s sleeping habits, onset of allergic or other symptoms, need for healthcare services and medical diagnoses set by a physician are reported at 3-month intervals.\n\nEnvironment and lifestyle: In addition to nutrition, the recorded environmental exposures for the study infants include person-to-person contacts (number of siblings and frequent caregivers; group size, if in day care) and environmental factors (housing type, biodiversity, pets, travelling, home cleaning practices and hygiene standards measured based on, eg, on the frequency of vacuuming and sterilisation of dummies, if in use).\n\nMaternal and paternal factors: Age, education, smoking and alcohol use were recorded for both parents at the enrolment; weight and height for body mass index (BMI), medical diagnoses and family history of chronic diseases were assessed for mothers and biological fathers. For the mother, several prenatal and postnatal factors were additionally assessed, including parity, medication and use of probiotics and other supplements during pregnancy and lactation, complications of pregnancy and childbirth details. Maternal stress during the third trimester was determined using a short scaling questionnaire on stress. The same questionnaire is administered at 1.5 years postpartum, together with Beck Depression Inventory II and Parenting Stress Index questionnaires."
