That's a unique opportunity that a lot of programs don't really offer you.\" - Jerry Bradley, MD\n\n\"I was born and raised in Kentucky and I wanted to serve Kentuckians. I was impressed with the mission of this program. Our program director wanted to start something from the ground up that would be everlasting and really have a positive impact on the people here.\" - Hamed Haghnazar, MD\n\n\"When you see the experience of Dr. Sivoravong with 20 years' experience with residency programs, and you see that the attendings and the faculty members have long experience, and when you are with the University of Louisville, you are confident that you will get the best education available.\" - Hayat Itani, MD\n\n\"This being an unopposed program is a big draw. We are not competing with ER residents or surgery residents in the hospital to get to do procedures or to be involved in cases. And with this being a new program, I like the idea of being able to help set the tone.\" - M. Damon Kolok, MD\n\n\"I really liked the director's vision to generate residents who can basically practice anywhere at the end of their residency program. Also, the staff from the hospital, the CEO and other doctors, were very supportive for this residency program. That was very impressive.\" - Suheung (Steven) Lee, MD\n\n\"I intend to practice in an underserved, rural area. I felt like being exposed to a wide variety of pathology in a rural setting would be a good experience for my career as a rural family doctor.\" - Daniel Meis, DO\n\n\"When you're interviewing for residency programs, you can tell whether or not they actually care about you and that you succeed. I felt like this would be a place that would both care about the work we do, as well as the people doing the work. And I have no regrets. I was right.\" - Augusta Rawlins-Rader, MD"
