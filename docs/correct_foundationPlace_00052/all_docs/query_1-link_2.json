This name was chosen to represent the rarity of such successful ventures, much like the mythical unicorn.\n\nThe significance of tech unicorns lies not just in their high valuation but also in what they symbolize: a combination of innovation, investor confidence, and potential for significant impact on the market and society. Yet, nowadays they are not so mythical. As of November 2023, there were over 1200 unicorn companies worldwide, indicating a growing presence of such high-value startups in the global market.\n\nHowever, the concept of tech unicorns has attracted some criticism. While their high valuations are noteworthy, these figures don't always translate into long-term success or market stability. The focus on achieving unicorn status can sometimes lead to overvaluation and an emphasis on rapid growth over sustainable business practices.\n\nIn Latin America, the tech unicorn landscape has been thriving, particularly in recent years. Increased investment led to a record number of new unicorns in Latin America. Brazil leads the region with the most unicorns, followed by significant contributions from Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay.\n\nCURRENT AFFAIRS\n\nChile: The EU and Chile have signed an Advanced Framework Agreement and an Interim Trade Agreement, aimed at enhancing political cooperation and boosting trade and investment. These agreements focus on promoting shared values like human rights, sustainable trade, and gender equality, and respond to global challenges such as securing sustainable supply chains and addressing climate change. Chile becomes the first country in the region to conclude a next-generation agreement with the EU, with a focus on tackling challenges like climate action and sustainable development with the aims to modernize trade rules and support businesses in both regions towards achieving a net-zero economy.\n\nBrazil: Marcus Nobel is offering a \"Green Nobel\" prize to honor environmental champions of the Amazon rainforest. The United Earth Amazonia prize, independent of the Nobel Foundation, focuses on projects preserving the rainforest and its biodiversity, with winners to be awarded in June at the Opera House in Manaus. This annual prize, first awarded last year without prize money, aims to give visibility to significant environmental efforts and will expand its scope in 2024 to include nations sharing the Amazon rainforest.\n\nArgentina: Argentina's Economy Minister Luis Caputo has warned of a \"substantially higher\" inflation rate for December, following a 12.8% rate in November. This comes as the new government under President Javier Milei implements economic measures including a more than 50% devaluation of the peso and cuts in energy subsidies. These actions, part of Milei's economic shock therapy to address Argentina's financial crisis, have been cautiously welcomed by markets but are expected to further impact inflation and consumer prices.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nEpisode #29 of Find The Way Podcast is out:\n\nð± Investing with Impact: Shaping the Future with Finance\n\nTune in to our latest episode focusing on the transformative power of impact investing in Latin America.
