He was the son of Rabbi Mayer Weisz and Cecilia Steiner.\n\nEhrich was one of seven children, having four brothers, including fellow magician and escape artist Theo Hardeen, and two sisters.\n\nIn pursuit of a better life, the Weisz family emigrated to the United States when Ehrich was only four. They settled in Appleton, Wisconsin, where his father served as a rabbi.\n\nHoudini and Bess Houdini\n\nHoudini Milk Can\n\nHarry Houdini (1874 -1926)\n\nHoudini Handcuff King\n\nHoudini locked in chains\n\nHoudini's mother and wife\n\nWhere Houdini Lived in Appleton\n\nHoudini often referred to Appleton as his birthplace, fondly calling it his ‘hometown.’\n\nHe lived at 114 S. Appleton Street, now called Houdini Plaza and dedicated to Houdini’s life and career.\n\nWho Influenced Houdini and Where Did Houdini Get His Name?\n\nEhrich showed interest in magic from a very young age and was influenced by the French magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin, after reading his autobiography.\n\nIn 1891 he began his career as a professional magician.\n\nHe adopted the stage name ‘Harry Houdini,’ ‘Harry’ being the American version of his nickname ‘Ehrie,’ and ‘Houdini’ as an homage to Robert-Houdin.\n\nHe added the “i” to the name because, in Hungarian, it means “belongs to.”\n\nWhat Did Houdini Look Like?\n\nAs for Houdini’s physical appearance, he was not particularly imposing, standing about 5’6” (1.68m) tall. However, he possessed a strong, athletic build that was vital to many of his escape performances.\n\nHoudini had medium blue eyes that added to his charismatic stage presence.\n\nHoudini’s early years were marked by struggle and hardship, including dire poverty. He eventually relocated with his family to New York City, where he took several jobs as a child, including a trapeze artist.\n\nHis beginnings in Appleton and his dedication to magic from an early age played a crucial role in shaping the legendary performer we continue to remember today.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nHarry Houdini’s professional career in magic began in earnest with card tricks. He worked for starvation wages at dime museums showcasing curiosities for ten cents.\n\nAt this time, he billed himself as the ‘King of Cards’ and focused primarily on traditional card tricks.\n\nHoudini also worked in sideshows, a form of entertainment that typically accompanied circuses and carnivals, performing magic tricks and began to experiment with escape acts.\n\nThese early experiences gave Houdini a deep understanding of audiences and performance art.\n\nPerforming With His Brother\n\nIn the early 1890s, he teamed up with his brother, Theodore and began appearing under the name ‘The Brothers Houdini.’\n\nTheodore, known as ‘Dash,’ would later become a successful magician in his own right, adopting the stage name ‘Theodore Hardeen.’\n\nThe Brothers Houdini performed at the Chicago World’s Fair and dime museums in New York City.\n\nWho is Bess Houdini?\n\nDuring these early years of his career, Houdini met Wilhelmina Beatrice Rahner, known as ‘Bess.’ Bess was a singer and dancer performing at Coney Island, and Houdini was instantly smitten.\n\nThey married in 1894, just three weeks after they first met.\n\nBess became Houdini’s stage assistant and an integral part of his performance. Bess Houdini was also his lifelong companion and played an essential role in his life and career.\n\nHoudini’s Big Break\n\nHoudini’s big break came when Martin Beck, an influential entertainment manager, discovered him in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nBeck was impressed by Houdini’s handcuff escapes rather than his card tricks. He advised Houdini to concentrate on escape acts and soon booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit.\n\nThis led to significant success, as audiences were captivated by Houdini’s daring feats and charismatic showmanship.\n\nThis stage of Houdini’s life laid the foundation for the iconic figure he would become, setting him on a path that would change the face of magic and illusion forever.\n\nRise to Fame\n\nHarry Houdini’s rise to stardom culminated in his relentless dedication, charismatic showmanship, and constant push to challenge the limits of possibility.\n\nHis fame spread to Europe, where he performed in some of the most prestigious theaters and astonished audiences with his daring escape acts.\n\nHoudini became a global sensation due to his fearless escapes, ability to take risks, and impressive marketing skills.\n\nChallenges, Escapes, and Publicity Stunts\n\nHoudini’s escapes were as varied as they were breathtaking and were presented to the public as real, adding a sense of danger and thrill to his performances.\n\nHoudini was skilled at crafting the narrative of his performances, often devising his own challenges to ensure his escape and maintain his reputation as a master escape artist.\n\nWhat Did Houdini Escape From?\n\nHis repertoire included:\n\nEscaping from handcuffs in darkened cells.\n\nWriggling free from packing boxes.\n\nExtricating himself from straitjackets (often while suspended upside down from cranes or buildings).\n\nBreaking out of jail cells.\n\nEscaping from iron boxes.\n\nOne of his most famous escapes was the ‘Chinese Water Torture Cell,’ in which he was suspended upside down in a water-filled tank with his feet locked in stocks.\n\nPublicity\n\nHoudini was a master of publicity.\n\nHis stunts were dramatic and eye-catching, designed to draw crowds and media attention.\n\nHe would often perform escapes in public places, like jumping manacled from a bridge into a river or allowing himself to be buried alive and escaping. His skill and audacity made headlines, drawing huge crowds to his shows.\n\nChallenges\n\nChallenges were crucial to Houdini’s success. He would often set up the challenges himself, controlling the parameters to ensure a successful escape.\n\nHe presented these as spontaneous challenges from the audience or local authorities, enhancing his performances’ spectacle and perceived risk.\n\nHoudini did receive authentic challenges, but if one presented a situation he couldn’t handle, he ignored it.\n\nBy turning his shows into spectacles and taking control of the narrative, Houdini became not just a magician or escape artist but a captivating figure of mystery and adventure.\n\nThe allure of Houdini was about more than his ability to escape; it was about the daring, audacious figure who seemed to laugh in the face of danger, defy the odds, and escape unscathed.\n\nDid Houdini die while performing?\n\nDid Houdini die while performing? No.\n\nThe 1953 film Houdini starring Tony Curtis, has almost re-written the legacy of one of history's most iconic illusionists.\n\nMany believe Houdini died performing his famous water tank mystery, the \"Chinese Water Torture Cell,\" because of the movie's final scene.\n\nA dramatic ending to the movie-- but how did Houdini die?\n\nHoudini's Final Days and Death\n\nHarry Houdini died on October 31, 1926, but the circumstances leading up to his death began several days earlier.\n\nIn the days leading to Houdini's death, Harry Houdini performed in Montreal, Canada. He was backstage nursing a broken ankle from a stunt he had performed on October 11, 1926.\n\nHoudini also reported a fever.\n\nWhere Was Houdini Punched?\n\nOn October 22, while Houdini was resting in his dressing room after a performance at the Princess Theater in Montreal, Canada, he was visited by a group of students.\n\nOne of them, J. Gordon Whitehead, askedHoudini if it was true that he could resist any blow to his abdomen, as rumors suggested.\n\nHoudini replied in the affirmative, but before he could prepare himself for the blows, Whitehead punched him in the stomach.\n\nThe unexpected blow caused Houdini considerable pain but he did not seek immediate medical attention, continuing with his planned shows.\n\nAs he traveled to Detroit’s Garrick Theater, Houdini’s health rapidly deteriorated.\n\nDespite his doctor’s advice, he performed his final show on October 24 while running a high fever and in considerable pain.\n\nFinally, on October 25, Houdini was admitted to Grace Hospital in Detroit, where it was discovered he had a ruptured appendix.\n\nIt's believed that a blow to Houdini's stomach ruptured his appendix, but a recent theory suggests Houdini died of Peritonitis which may have already been ruptured.\n\nHoudini's Final Words\n\nDespite undergoing two operations, his condition continued to worsen, and Houdini succumbed to peritonitis, an inflammation of the tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs, resulting from his ruptured appendix.\n\nIt’s reported that Houdini’s last words were, ‘I’m tired of fighting.’\n\nWhere is Harry Houdini buried?\n\nHarry Houdini was buried in New York State in Queens in the Machpelah Cemetery in 1926.\n\nThe Machpelah Cemetery is a Jewish cemetery within the Cemetery Belt in Glendale, Queens, New York.\n\nHe is buried with his brother Theodore Hardeen, his mother, father, grandfather, four other brothers, and a sister.\n\nThe Society of American Magicians performed a broken wand ceremony on October 31, 1996, the anniversary of the famous magician's death.\n\nWhere is Houdini Buried and Bess Houdini buried?\n\nIn his will, Houdini had left provisions for a plot for Bess next to him, but because she was not Jewish, her family refused to bury her there upon her death in 1943. Instead, Bess Houdini is interred at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.\n\nDespite being laid to rest separately, Harry and Bess Houdini’s love story is one of the most enduring aspects of the great magician’s life.\n\nAlthough Houdini died almost a century ago, his legacy endures as he attempted to communicate from beyond the grave.\n\nAfter Life and Contacting the Spirits\n\nDespite his penchant for the mystical in his performances, Harry Houdini was a staunch opponent of what he considered fraudulent spiritualistic practices.\n\nDebunking Spiritualism Was Influenced by His Mother\n\nFollowing the death of his beloved mother in 1913, Houdini began attending séances in an attempt to contact her.\n\nHowever, he quickly became disillusioned by the methods used by the mediums and began a lifelong campaign to expose them as frauds.\n\nHoudini attended séances in disguise, used his knowledge of magic to understand the mediums’ tricks, and even wrote a book titled ‘A Magician Among the Spirits,’ detailing his experiences and exposing the fraudulent methods used by supposed spiritualists.\n\nHis crusade against spiritualism brought him into conflict with many, including his one-time friend, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a firm believer in spiritualism.\n\nThe Houdini Code\n\nPerhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of Houdini’s battle with spiritualism is what’s known as the ‘Houdini Code.’\n\nBefore his death, Houdini left a secret ten-word code with his wife, Bess.\n\nThe code was a combination of the word \"Rosabelle\" inscribed on Bess's wedding ring and the name of the song Bess sang when they first met and a secret magician code with the following words:\n\n\"Rosabelle, answer, tell, pray, answer, look, tell, answer, answer, tell.\"\n\nSecret Code:\n\nEach word corresponded to a secret letter, ultimately spelling out ‘Believe.’\n\nThis was a final test, a challenge to mediums who claimed they could contact the dead. If a medium could relay this code to Bess from Houdini in the afterlife, it would be considered genuine proof of communication with the departed.\n\nContinued Séance Tradition\n\nEvery year for a decade after Houdini’s death, Bess held a séance on Halloween, the anniversary of Houdini’s death, in an attempt to receive the secret message.\n\nDespite numerous attempts, the code was never successfully relayed.\n\nBess eventually gave up the tradition, famously saying, ‘Ten years is long enough to wait for any man.’\n\nHowever, the tradition of holding séances to contact Houdini continues to this day among magic enthusiasts, keeping the memory and legend of Houdini alive.\n\nMagician Harry Houdini Fun Facts\n\nHere are some fun facts about Harry Houdini:\n\nBrotherly Bond: Harry Houdini was close with his brother, Theodore, who became a famous magician, Theo Hardeen. Initially, they performed together as “The Brothers Houdini,” but later, Hardeen pursued his own successful career. Even though they were competitors on stage, they remained supportive of each other throughout their lives.\n\nAviation Enthusiast: Houdini had a keen interest in aviation. In fact, he was one of the first people to fly a plane in Australia. He purchased a French Voisin biplane in 1909 and, in March 1910, made his successful flight in Australia.\n\nSilver Screen Performer: Houdini had a brief but notable career in silent films. He founded his own film production company, the “Houdini Picture Corporation,” and starred in several films like “The Man from Beyond” and “Haldane of the Secret Service.” While his film career didn’t take off as he might have hoped, it is an interesting part of his diverse career.\n\nPublishing Venture: Houdini launched his magic magazine, “Conjurers’ Monthly Magazine” in 1906. The magazine was not just about magic but also a platform for Houdini to expose fraudulent spiritualists. Although it only ran for a year, it was widely read and remains a fascinating part of magic history.\n\nNicknamed’ Handcuff King’: During the early part of his career, Houdini became known as the ‘Handcuff King’ because of his uncanny ability to escape from any handcuffs he was put into. The moniker stuck with him throughout his career and is still associated with his name today.\n\nA Fight Against Fraud: Houdini spent a significant portion of his later career debunking spiritualists and mediums, going as far as to attend séances in disguise to expose fraud. His crusade was so impactful that he was asked to testify in front of a Congressional committee.\n\nA Unique Library: Houdini had one of the largest private libraries in the world dedicated to magic and the occult. At the time of his death, it contained more than 5,000 books.\n\nAn Inventor: Not just a master of escapes, Houdini was also an inventive mind! He held several patents to his name, including one for a unique diving suit design.
