        "text": "Okay, so first i was only going to get it because my friend was samsung, and i am i phone so i wanted to face time him but i cant because iPhones cant facetime samsungs on normal calling app, so i asked my dad to install and he approved. One thing that immidealty hit me after i opened the app for the first time was the aesthetics, tje look and feel on whatsapp is WAY better, like imessage is so boring and plain, but this is soo many stuff to do on it. Also, i really like meta ai, cause its a fun and interesting feature that I absolutely LOVE about WhatsApp. Now whatsapp is my main messaging app, compared to i message i message is trash and i am mever going back to i message after my experience with whatsapp so IF YOU ARE READING THIS REVIEW AND YOU DONT HAVE WHATSAPP AND YOU ARE STILL USING THAT TRASHY I MESSAGE GET THIS RIGHT NOW IT IS WAY BETTER TRUST ME yeah it just looks better, feels better, more stuff to do like meta ai, and oh yeah i forgot to mention this earlier but APPARENTLY YOU CANT MESSAGE SAMSUNG PHONES OUT OF THE COUNTRY ON I MESSAGE, SO WHATSAPP ALSO FIXES THAT PROBLEM WHATSAPP IS WAY BETTER OK BYE ðð¤ªðð\n\nThis is a really great app, Iâve had this app since I was in high school, Iâve had other social social media apps, but always come back to this one.\n\nI have some ideas when it comes to the AI features. Is it possible to create a life coach AI?\n\nThere is a career coach, but it would be awesome if there was a life coach as well.\n\nAlso, I know that a lot of these AI chats are made using certain programs that probably might not allow the AI to send messages, but if it is possible, could we somehow have it to wear talking with an AI is exactly like talking with another person on WhatsApp?\n\nMeaning that not only will the AI message with you back-and-forth, but every once once in while, you might get a message from the AI.\n\nFor example, say that someone wants to use the life coach AI to help with exercising, and one of the things that they would like is accountability. The AI would be able to message the person, checking in on them to see if they did what they said they were gonna do.\n\nOr, say someone was talking to Liv, and they were going through grief. Liv could send the messages every once in while to check on them and see how theyâre doing and help them through what theyâre going through.\n\nEssentially, it would be like having an actual conversation with someone. It was just a thought that I had. Hope you all are doing well.\n\nI had a pop up from WhatsApp requesting access to all photos. I can't even remember the last time I used the app (it has been over a year) and at the time the pop up was displayed I was browsing in Safari. Since I didn't expect the pop up I mindlessly clicked Allow and then immediately went into settings to revoke all photos access. WhatsApp should not be requesting access to all photos out of the blue.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars because the app worked fine as far as I remember. I wanted to report the issue to WhatsApp but have not found a way to do that so am attempting to let somebody know by writing a review. I'll probably delete the app now though to avoid future occurrences. It makes me suspicious of what it could possibly be doing in the background without my knowledge because I didn't do anything that should result in WhatsApp wanting access to my photos."
