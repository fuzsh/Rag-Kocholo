However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nWith just one episode left in the series, episode 9 certainly went out with a bang. Literally. So everyone is wondering if Mariko died in Shogun because if so, we’ve just said goodbye to one of our favorite characters. Mariko, played so beautifully by Anna Sawa, is based on Akechi Tama, a real-life aristocrat and Christian noblewoman who was killed before the Battle of Sekigahara.\n\nBased on James Clavell’s novel, Shōgun is set in Japan in the year 1600 at the dawn of a century-defining civil war. Lord Yoshii Toranaga is fighting for his life as his enemies on the Council of Regents unite against him when a mysterious European ship is found marooned in a nearby fishing village. Enter John Blackthorne, an English pilot who serves on the Dutch warship Erasmus and becomes the first Englishman to reach Japan.\n\nInitially a prisoner, Blackthorne—most commonly referred to as “Anjin”, which loosely means pilot in Japanese—begins to aid Toranaga in more ways than one and becomes enthralled by Japanese culture in doing so.\n\nClavell’s 1,000-page novel was turned into 10 episodes for FX and shed light on whether fans would get a second season. “We took the story to the end of the book and put a period at the end of that sentence. We love how the book ends; it was one of the reasons why we both knew we wanted to do it—and we ended in exactly that place,” co-showrunner Justin Marks told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“And I’ve been party to this in the past with shows like this, where you build a whole factory, and it only pumps out 10 cars and closes up shop. It’s a bummer. You know, one of our producers wrote a nearly 900-page instruction manual for how we do this show—almost as long as the book Shogun itself. All of this infrastructural knowledge went into it.” Here’s if Mariko dies in Shogun.\n\nDoes Mariko Die In Shogun?\n\nDoes Mariko die in Shogun? Yes, sadly, our favorite character dies in an explosion in the final moments of the show’s penultimate episode. It’s not in vain, however. She sacrifices her life for Lord Yoshii Toranaga to signal Ishido Kazunari’s corruption and hopefully spark a rebellion.\n\n“It’s such a powerful moment because she’s not only serving her Lord [Toranaga], but she’s also fulfilling her father’s wishes. She’s allowing herself to follow in the footsteps of her father, which is her wish,” Sawai told The Hollywood Reporter. “Her name is currently Toda Mariko, which is Buntaro’s last name, but she says ‘Akechi Mariko’ in her final moment. She is always going to be her father’s daughter, and this is the long, long journey. It’s the long fight [involving her father]. It’s not just about right now.”\n\nThat long journey is in reference to her suicidal ideation when she was pregnant with her son, 14 years before the events of the show. But it’s under different circumstances now. Her father, Akechi Jinsai, was a vassal of the then-Japanese ruler, Kuroda. Believing him to be corrupt, her father assassinated Kurodaa and when he was caught, he was forced to kill his entire family because of what the government considered a treacherous bloodline. Mariko begged for her life to be taken as well, but she was forced to live.\n\nHer eventual death is “less about feeling shameful for still living, and it’s more about, ‘I don’t agree with the fact that my father and my whole family had to die, but if that is what happened, then I shall follow their footsteps. I’m going to be with them. I’m part of this whole protest’,” she explained to The Hollywood Reporter. “So that is the meaning behind her will to die throughout the whole show. It’s not that she’s saddened and just wants to die. It’s more like, “I don’t agree with this. This is not right.” And that’s the message that she keeps until her very last breath.”\n\nIs Shogun a true story?\n\nThe events portrayed in Shogun and Lord Toranaga are loosely inspired by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who began the Tokugawa Shogunate of Japan in 1603. Historically, he’s regarded as one of the country’s “Great Unifiers”. Ieyasu was the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate, which ruled Japan for over 250 years until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. He emerged victorious in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, which solidified his control over Japan and allowed him to establish a centralized government.\n\nUnder his rule, known as the Edo period, Japan experienced a long period of stability, economic growth, and cultural development. Ieyasu’s policies, such as the strict regulation of samurai and the establishment of alternate attendance (sankin-kotai), helped to maintain control over the feudal lords and stabilize the country."
