        "text": "[There are spoilers ahead for last night’s episode of Euphoria. If you haven’t watched yet, stay away from this post!]\n\nLast night’s Euphoria season finale was quite literally a doozy. We got to see Cassie and Maddy brawl on a stage, Rue and Jules have a sweet heart-to-heart moment, and Elliot sing a little song, giving everyone an opportunity to check Twitter for three minutes. But maybe the most consequential of all the things that happened was the shootout at Fez and Ashtray’s place, which might have left both of them dead. Or maybe just one of them. Or maybe neither?\n\nIf you need a quick recap of the events, here’s what happened:\n\nIn last night’s episode, Custer comes over to Ashtray and Fez’s house and it’s clear to the viewer that he’s working with the police. Ashtray, as he is wont to do, stabs Custer in the neck. Fez pleads with Ashtray to let him take the fall because they know the police are literally on their way. Ashtray refuses, and he grabs a bunch of guns and barricades himself in the bathroom. The FBI enter the home and there’s a shootout between the FBI officers and Ashtray, who’s hiding in the bathtub. In the midst of the craziness, Ashtray shoots Fez.\n\nFor a second, the shooting stops, and it seems like Ashtray was shot. An FBI officer approaches the bathroom door, opens it, and Ashtray is lying on the ground, as if he’s dead. But it turns out to be a fake-out, and Ashtray sits up and shoots the FBI officer. We then see the red dot on Ashtray, like a gun is pointed right at him. The camera turns away from Ashtray and we hear a shot fired.\n\nSo…is he dead?\n\nWell, that’s a great question. Technically, we never see Ashtray’s dead body, so sure, it’s possible he’s still alive. But it feels really unlikely. We did get to see Fez being taken away in handcuffs, very much alive, but we didn’t get any signs of life from Ashtray.\n\nBut Javon Walton, the actor who plays Ashtray, is not totally convinced he’s dead. Or rather, he *hopes* he’s not dead.\n\n“Man, I just hope he’s alive,” Javon told Esquire. “Because I’m sure he didn’t just get shot one time by taking cover in the bathtub and getting shot through the wall.” He went on to talk about what he thinks could happen in season 3 if Ashtray somehow survived.\n\n“With Fez in jail, I feel like he’s going to get out no matter what,” Javon says. “I don’t know how, but I feel like he’s definitely going to be able to get out somehow. And Ash is definitely going to find a way back to him because that’s the person he cares about most to him. That’s what I would want to happen, is for Ash and Fez to reunite. People love the Ash and Fez duo. The Fesh train!”\n\nOkay, interesting. Nothing incredibly definitive here, but I guess if Euphoria creator Sam Levinson wants to pull a fast one on all of us, Javon has some plot ideas!"
