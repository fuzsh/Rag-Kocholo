Here’s what Danny had to say to NPR about the Black Milk-produced track:\n\nMe and Kendrick always talked about doing stuff, and I had the idea to get K Dot and Earl together …but first I got me and Ab Soul. And then one day when I was mixing the album with Ali, K Dot snuck in and just laced it. I had to be patient and wait on Earl, but it was all worth it you know because Hip-Hop needs that posse cut. We just wanna make the best possible song cause we know the hype on paper. I know it’s gonna satisfy, my feet is up."
