        "text": "Danny Brown assembles a rap dream-team of Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul on his new single “Really Doe,” a gritty track from his upcoming LP, Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nThe four rappers trade explosive bars over producer Black Milk’s clanging drums and eerie, looped bells. “I done made it out of the hood,” Brown flows in his manic, idiosyncratic style. “Think I’m goin’ back? I wish a motherfucker would.”\n\nEach participant sneaks in some brooding lines: Ab-Soul is “still wicked as Aleister Crowley,” and Lamar explores trademark religious imagery (“Hold the crosses ‘cross your heart/ Sin is such a work of art”). The verses are connected by Lamar’s smooth, half-sung chorus: “They say I got the city on fire/ I ain’t boomin’, that’s a goddamn lie.”\n\n“I’m pretty much the main star of this show, as always,” Brown told Rolling Stone of the all-star team-up. The track follows Brown’s previous singles “Pneumonia” and “Rolling Stone,” which also appear on his fourth LP, Atrocity Exhibition, out September 30th.\n\nTrending\n\nThe album, which follow’s 2013’s Old, marks his debut for electronic label Warp Records. Atrocity – which draws inspiration from Raekwon, early Björk, Joy Division, Talking Heads and System of a Down’s Toxicity – also features production from Kanye West collaborator Evian Christ and South African songwriter Petite Noir."
