        "text": "UPDATE: The studio version of the song is online now, so we get to hear it fully intact, with no DJ hyping.\n\nDanny Brown’s feverishly anticipated new album Atrocity Exhibition comes out at the end of the month, and today, we get to hear the song that pretty much all of us have been most anxious to hear. Brown already shared early tracks “Pneumonia” and “Rolling Stone,” and they were both great. But what we all really wanted to hear was “Really Doe,” the song that matches Brown up with guests Ab-Soul, Kendrick Lamar, and Earl Sweatshirt. Brown teased it on Instagram last night, and the Hot 97 DJ Peter Rosenberg debuted it this morning. The radio rip is now going around online, and even though we have to hear with Rosenberg self-hyping all over the clean version, it is still a thing to behold. The song has an eerie, fractured beat, and it has all four rappers doing whatever they can to out-monster each other. Early verdict, at least from where I’m sitting: Earl won this. But listen to it below and decide for yourself."
