        "text": "This answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[A'ight, I signed up just to answer this question (though I'm very late, but some of you might still be looking for answers). Now, just a disclaimer: what i'm about to say are just theories on HOW Rufus dies.\n\nMy theory: he died of Victor hitting him with a speeding car, while Victor was trying to get to Delilah.\n\nClues:\n\n1. Remember how each character somehow bumps into one another, though they had different stories of their own? For example, that woman who tried to kill herself (forgot her name, sorry) saw them speeding on a bike and didn't jump, and that bomb guy bumped into Mateo and Rufus pages before the touching-explosion-bookstore scene?\n\n2. Victor hasn't collided with Mateo and Rufus in the story, and the story just ends with him dangerously driving in his car to reach his fiancé.\n\n3. The story also ends with Rufus passing the street without anyone, or in particular- Mateo- to hold him back. Last time Mateo did it, it was to warn him of passing cars. But none passed. What if this time, it did?\n\n4. A lot of deaths seem to revolve around cars in this book (except dear Mateo's death, ofc). Rufus' family died of a car plummeting off a bridge, and Howie died of a car accident. That's only two but you get my point right?\n\n5. I'm not sure, but in page 362 it states that Victor got into his car and speeds to Althea (the place). At page 367, Rufus says that he's going to Althea Park. Hmmmm....\n\nSo that's it, really.\n\nAgain, this is just a wacky theory of mine. I'm not sure if it's been said before... but yeah :/\n\nOrrrr perhaps the author wanted to leave it to the reader's imagination? (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Both Mateo and Rufus died by the end of the book. Mateo dies because of a fire. Rufus tried to save him, but failed. Rufus goes to the hospital to talk to Mateo's father, and when he leaves, he'll die because he'll be hit by a car. We know this because of the last line: \"I cross the street without an arm to hold me back.\" This refers to a moment earlier in the book when Mateo holds back Rufus, because otherwise he would've been run over by a car. This time, he crosses the road without Mateo holding him back to prevent him from being hit by a speeding car. (hide spoiler)]"
