        "text": "Danny Brown sets the city on fire with “Really Doe,” a new posse cut featuring Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, and Earl Sweatshirt off his upcoming album, Atrocity Exhibition.\n\nThe Black Milk-produced slapper allows each MC to spit a mean verse over thumping production.\n\n“Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips,” Ab rhymes. “Soulo Ho, the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition / Oh yeah, now a ni**a livin’ good / But good could be better / I wish a motherfu**er would.”\n\nK-Dot follows his TDE brother with some potent rhymes of his own. “Big power, big stages,” he raps. “My zoo cannot fit the cages / This booth is not used to fakin’ / My crew just love confrontation.”\n\nMeanwhile, the host delivers his “special flow” over booming drums. “Now a ni**a livin’ good,” he raps. “I done made it out the hood / Think I’m goin’ back? I wish a motherfu**er would.”\n\nIn an interview with NPR, Brown explained how the collaboration came together. “Me and Kendrick always talked about doing stuff, and I had the idea to get K-Dot and Earl together …but first I got me and Ab-Soul,” he said. “And then one day when I was mixing the album with Ali, K-Dot snuck in and just laced it. I had to be patient and wait on Earl, but it was all worth it because hip-hop needs that posse cut. We just wanna make the best possible song ’cause we know the hype on paper. I know it’s gonna satisfy, my feet is up.”"
