One of the best posse tracks in recent memory, Really Doe is full of incredible punchlines, great rhyming, hard delivery, and a hypnotizing beat.

Personally, I think this is one of the few songs Kendrick has been outshined on. Earl Sweatshirt dropped one of his best career verses. What does everybody else think?

Earl definitely took the spotlight.

Interesting time in Kendrick's career, right at the tail of end of the TPAB era, where his stream of conscious stuff was starting to become a massive f---ing bore. Didn't think I'd not care for his verse on a song with Danny Brown, Ab Soul & f---in Earl. Thank god he 180'd his whole s--- with d---.

Yeah Earl was definitely the star here. Danny did great though

donâ€™t really care for the other two verses, or Ab-Soul in general

I heard soul and danny have fallen off since they made this because it was meant to be just soul and danny on the song at first. Aparantly he took a danny verse of huey knew because of it
