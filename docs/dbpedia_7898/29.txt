WHAT IT IS: Doe Boy clings to truth in between cleverly quotable punchlines, bullet-riddled bars and intoxicating hooks. The Cleveland-based rapper asserts himself as both a storyteller and a party starter with an unpredictable, uncompromising sound of his own. Ranging from 2016’s Streetz Need Me to 2022’s OH REALLY, Doe Boy’s initial releases earned him praise from the likes of FADER, HYPEBEAST and LeBron James. With hundreds of millions of streams under his belt, a diehard fanbase and his 2023 album, BEEZY, Doe Boy has solidified his place in the music scene.
