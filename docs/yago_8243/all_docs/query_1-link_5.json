Chad is Liz and allisters son liz is eve’s adopted sister so there is no blood relation. Miles is with whitney and chad now. Chad is canoodling with a “unknown” person while he is engaged to be married to whitney.\n\nChris Boothe/Sheridan Crane/Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\n/Fancy Crane- i saw where they found out luis was alive, that’s it…where is her son… how did sheridan get pregnant?\n\nChris booth got her pregnant- she had a miscarriage- You missed the Omega plot in rome so that is when luis went to look for beth and marty- he was searching with fancy- beth always stayed one step ahead of them with the help of her father (alister). The end result of the chase- beth, marty, and alister were all supposedly killed in a train explosion. I stress supposedly- noone ever saw the bodys but that prompted luis to return home with Fancy who in the meantime has fallen in love with luis.\n\nDr. Eve Russell/Julian Crane/TC Russell- t.c. thought she was being faithful…Eve and jullian hooked up… TC found out about eve’s past and he hooked up with liz for a while then he was gone until he got in a car accident\n\nSomething I was confused about was it just me or when TC got in the drunken car accident about a month and a half ago there was no air of his “stroke” and this is what they refrance to not a accident. Eve took him in as a patient this is what started eve and jullian fighting and the breakup.\n\n******what was hiding in the shed all those yrs ago?\n\nhis car that he was driving when jullian ran him off the road that ruined his tennis carrear years and years ago.\n\nEdna Wallace/Beth/Marty- are they still in hiding? Edna ran off with norma and we saw them briefly in rome they are now living together somewhere else.\n\nEndora/Siren/Tabitha/Kaye- is kaye a witch now? who is siren?Kay is not a witch but does believe in magic and performs spells. Siren is no longer on the show but she was a horney mermaid who was created by endora because she liked mermaids. Siren wanted to curse the men in kays life because she wanted to have sex with them and then they would no longer be able to have sex with a mortal again. “mermaids Curse” Kay broke this after she slept with fox.\n\nPilar/Martin Fitzgerald- what’s up with their marriage? They are not together…Thanks Kathrine.\n\nEthan/Gwen/Theresa- whose raising whose kids now???\n\nEathan and gwenn are raising jane and threesa has custody of little eathan For now.\n\nNoah Bennett/Fancy Crane- how’d they start? how’d they end? Don’t know how they started but they ended in rome when noah was liying to her about his ex- girlfriend this was a plot that was alister’s doing he didden’t want fancy with a Bennett.\n\n“Spike” Lester/Jessica Bennett- i saw were he met her, then skip ahead and sam said spike had turned her into a hooker? i need details here.\n\nI’m not totally sure about this one either but Jessica was hooked on drugs and spike was pimping her out and she is convinced she killed a bunch of johns in some hotel and now is married to spike because he kind-of- black mailed her by threatening to go to the police if he was ever caught.\n\nKay Bennett/Fox/Miguel- who loves who, is charity dead?\n\nKay loves fox and Miguel both charity is not dead she ran away… Miguel chased after her and to no avail he returned to harmony to find kay engaged to fox. ( I don’t really care about this I never liked charity any way.) the true story here now is the fox,kay,Miguel love triangle. Miguel now loves kay and wants to be a family but kay Is engaged to fox.\n\nIvy/Sam Bennett- are they a couple? what happened to grace? Grace ran off with another man (david) and his son. This was a plot I think if I remember correctly by ivy to get grace to leave the picture. Because of the fire-Pre-Passions Air- she had amnesia and diden’t remember if she was really married to David first or not- so dumb grace ran off with him and her new not really son and hasen’t returned. Ivy had medical issues that got her to live with sam and they fell in love again.\n\nJared Casey- forgot who he is all together that’s because he is new… threesa likes him it drives eathan nuts and he calls threesa tess. No one really knows him.\n\nPaloma Lopez-Fitzgerald?i saw her and simone, are they a couple? if not gay then is she dating anyone?\n\nPaloma is not gay she is in love whith robert a guy from mexico he is around every once in a while. Simone is with Rae. And currently works at the book café.\n\nRebecca Hotchkiss? is she dating anyone?No and she gave jullian a divorce.\n\nSimone Russell? i know she’s gay…\n\nShe’s with rae."
