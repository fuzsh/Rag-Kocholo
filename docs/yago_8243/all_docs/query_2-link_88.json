        "text": "The Vasquez family massacre is a continuing storyline on the American soap opera Passions, featured most prominently from October of 2007 to the present. Involving the Lopez-Fitzgerald family characters, the plot focused on Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald, and her past in Mexico.\n\nStoryline\n\nYears before Passions began, Pilar grew up in Mexico with her close friend Juanita. As the girls grew up Juanita met and fell in love with a man named Carlos Alejandro Vasquez, the heir to an immense drug cartel. Juanita became engaged to Carlos. Pilar was worried about the Vasquez's involvement with drugs, but Juanita assured her friend that Carlos was not going to go into the family business, instead he was to become an attorney. After the wedding, Pilar left Mexico for New England still keeping in touch with Juanita.\n\nPilar settled down with her husband Martin Fitzgerald, eventually giving birth to sons Antonio, and Luis. Juanita also had a son and at least two daughters. In January sometime in the early 1980s Juanita wrote to Pilar and insisted she come to Mexico to see her family. Pilar agreed. In Mexico, she was reunited with Juanita and met Carlos, who had a sinister interest in her. On January 28th, Pilar learned that Carlos had in fact inherited and was now operating the drug cartel! Pilar went to tell Juanita when she was attacked by Carlos who viciously raped her. In self-defense Pilar struck Carlos with a nearby candlestick. The blow killed him. Pilar called the police and told them about the drug cartel. When Juanita came home, finding her husband dead she accused Pilar of murder, refusing to believe her husband was the head of the cartel or a rapist. Just then the police stormed the Vasquez estate, believing the drug cartel to be outside. Juanita's children and the rest of the family had been outside in the terrace, when the police, believing the family members were part of the cartel open fired on them. The Vasquez's, along with Juanita's children, died instantly.\n\nJuanita-the only Vasquez left alive- was taken into custody, because of her relationship with Carlos. Mad with grief, she blamed Pilar for her family's death's. She vowed to make Pilar and her own family pay...with their lives! Pilar returned to Harmony, while Juanita was sent to prison. It is unknown what occurred between that time and 2007, but through her own admission, Juanita has stated that after her time in prison, she discovered her husband's involvement with the cartel. At first horrified Juanita gradually enjoyed the lifestyle, and soon became head of the cartel herself, honoring her husband's memory, and murdering anyone who stood in her way. Meanwhile, Pilar gave birth to three more children, and never told of her involvement in the massacre to anyone except for Father Lonigain, and Ivy Winthrop, and so it remained for twenty five years.\n\nIn October of 2007, Rebecca Hotchkiss Crane, and her daughter Gwen Hotchkiss were determined to find a way to end her former husband Ethan Winthrop's engagement to Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane. They found information about Pilar's involvement in the massacre on Rebecca's deceased lover J.T Cornell's flash drive.\n\nImpact\n\nCharacters involved\n\n*Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\n*Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane\n\n*Juanita Vasquez\n\n*Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\n*Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\n*Ethan Winthrop\n\n*Gwen Hotchkiss"
