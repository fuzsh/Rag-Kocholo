        "text": "How will Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald, a matriarch who has known hardship and anguish, deal with the imminent arrival from Mexico of her beautiful daughter, Paloma, whom she has not seen in years? What will the people of Salem say when they learn that Dr. Marlena Evans, a compassionate psychiatrist and one of the town's most beloved residents, is of all things a serial killer? And how will her adoring husband, John Black, a millionaire as well as an intelligence agent, react when he learns the terrible truth?\n\n''It's, like, I'll always love her,'' Drake Hogestyn, who has played John Black since 1986 on the popular NBC soap opera ''Days of Our Lives,'' told fans on Saturday afternoon. His reply to the improbable question was in the true soap opera tradition, a tradition that crosses cultural boundaries.\n\nMr. Hogestyn was one of more than 60 English- and Spanish-language soap opera actors to appear at a weekend jamboree in which thousands of fans (as many as 20,000, NBC officials said) surged across the Universal City Walk to embrace them, ask them questions and celebrate two NBC soap operas, ''Days of Our Lives'' and ''Passions,'' as well as telenovelas, or soap operas on Telemundo, the NBC-owned Spanish language network. The event had two purposes: to honor the two American soap operas and, more important, to underscore the links between the Spanish-language soap operas on Telemundo and their counterparts on NBC.\n\nEva Tamargo, who plays the hard-working housekeeper Pilar Lopez-Fitzgerald (soap operas sometimes cover several ethnic bases in one swoop) on ''Passions,'' moved from Telemundo and Spanish soap operas to the NBC show and was recently host of a reality show on Telemundo. On ''Passions'' the housekeeper's two sons and daughter are locked in complicated romantic relationships with the pampered children of her rich employers.\n\nMs. Tamargo, who was born in the Bronx in a Cuban family, said she received large amounts of mail, most of it from Latino girls. ''It's a very strong, positive role model,'' Ms. Tamargo said. ''I didn't have me on television when I was a kid.'' Her newly arriving fictional daughter, played by Silvana Arias, is also coming in from Miami and the world of Telemundo's soap operas.\n\n''Ethnicity is everywhere, and our show kind of celebrates it,'' Ms. Tamargo said. ''I play a woman who is extremely nonjudgmental, compassionate and understanding. As close to perfect as you can get.'' She laughed. ''I wish I was like her.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
