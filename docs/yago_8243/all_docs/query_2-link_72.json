        "text": "Friday, April 11, 2005\n\nAt the Crane compound, Katherine asked Gwen if she’s really doing what is best for “Ashley.” Gwen defended her actions. Katherine tried to convince Gwen to give Jane back to her real mother, Theresa. Kat told Gwen she has faith that she will do the right thing… On a plane headed to the compound, Theresa told Ethan that he has to choose between her and Gwen. Theresa continued to claim that Ethan is destined to be with her. Ethan privately contemplated about who he will choose. Ethan and Theresa arrived on the compound and tried to figure out how to break in… During her tea party, Tabitha made Whitney feel even worse about giving her baby up for adoption. Tabs welcomed T.C. and Liz and explained to Whitney that she invited them over so that she could tell her pop about the baby herself. T.C. was excited when Whit revealed her stomach and said she delivered a boy. He was mad when he realized nobody called to tell him. Liz blamed Eve for keeping T.C. in the dark. When T.C. asked to see the newborn, Whitney was forced to tell her father that she put his grandson up for adoption. Tabitha was thrilled to see T.C.’s temper flare. In order to place blame on Eve once again, Liz suggested that the adoption wasn’t Whitney’s idea. T.C. yelled at a crying Whitney, pointing out she made the wrong decision since she has a supporting, loving family who would have helped her raise her child. Eve and Julian arrived (thanks to Tabitha’s call to them). T.C. blamed Eve for Whitney’s decision….\n\nSheridan did not want Beth to leave with Marty and told Luis that Beth tried to hill her. At Sheridan’s cottage, Luis overheard Edna demanding Beth tell the truth. Beth covered by claiming she feels responsible for Sheridan hitting her head and therefore prompting her “hallucinations.” Eve and Julian arrived. Luis explained that Sheridan had a blow to the head and is now saying Beth was one of the clowns who kidnapped her. While Eve examined Sheridan, Julian asked his sister what she remembered about the clown. Sheridan described everything she recalled about her kidnapper. Sheridan was upset when Luis gave Marty to Beth to take home. The guests left the cottage and Sheridan told Luis she is not crazy and begged him to believe her. She asked Luis if they can conduct a DNA test on Marty….\n\nBack at the Wallace home, Beth set her clown costume ablaze. Edna pointed out that a DNA test will prove Marty is Sheridan’s child. Thursday, April 7, 2005\n\nAs Ethan waited for his private jet to take off, he agonized about throwing Gwen over for Theresa. Ethan called Kay and shared his plans to find Gwen and Jane….\n\nWhitney fretted over Fox’s reaction to her giving up “their” baby and wanted to run away. Theresa delayed her pal’s exit by accepting an invitation for tea at Tabitha’s place. When they arrived, Tabby raved what a great mom Whitney will make, compelling her to admit that she gave her son away. Kay, another tea party guest, was horrified by the news and peppered a guilt-ridden Whit with questions. Theresa dashed after finding out about Ethan’s plans and showed up on his jet….\n\nEdna pined for Precious then got spooked when she found Beth’s clown mask….\n\nSheridan fingered Beth as the clown who stole her baby; Luis feared she was delusional while Beth feigned indignation. Luis tried to reason with Sheridan who also remembered that Beth socked her. Luis played referee with the squabbling women….\n\nIvy tried to stop Jessica from sneaking out of the house. When Ivy brought up Jess’s rape, the teen lied she was a willing participant, then left. Sam came home and was peeved his daughter was gone. Ivy lied she went to the movies. At the club, Spike the owner slipped Jessica drugs then took her to his back room. He vowed revenge for Ethan, Fox and Chad closing down his first club. Wednesday, April 6, 2005\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse gave a discharged Whitney a baby basket. Whitney returned to her room in the Bennett home, which was decorated for a baby. She laughed and cried while reading a sweet card from Fox. Theresa took down the baby decorations. Whitney fell asleep and dreamed about Fox coming home and telling him she gave the baby up for adoption. She woke up and told Theresa about her dream. Theresa comforted her friend….\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Chad headed to his office at Crane Industries and made yet another mysterious phone call. Ethan walked in and claimed he was working on a business deal. Ethan got a call and said it was private… At Sheridan’s cottage, Beth tried to wake her unconscious rival. Beth wondered if she finally killed Sheridan. When she realized Sheridan was breathing, Beth planned to finish the job. “Get ready, here I come,” she said while plunging in to strangle her foe. Luis walked in and asked Beth what happened. Beth claimed she was defending herself from a physically abusive Sheridan. She told Luis that Sheridan said Marty is her son. Luis blew up at Beth, then apologized. Beth tried to convince Luis that Sheridan has lost her mind again. Sheridan woke up and again flashbacked to the clown that kidnapped her. Beth panicked. Sheridan told Luis it was the clown that took the baby… At the Crane compound, Fox chugged champagne and flirted with a French guard, Monique. When Gwen once again tried to get through to Fox, he joked about finding a male guard for her. After Gwen walked out, Fox took his shirt off and persuaded Monique to do the same. In a bedroom, Alistair forced Katherine to have sex. Gwen overheard Kat asking him to stop, but an armed guard told her to leave. Alistair heard the ruckus outside the door and came out. Katherine assured Gwen she is okay, and told her to go away. Fox and the guard headed to the pool and kissed. Before she left, Fox stole her key. Just as Fox tried to unlock a door, Monique and a male guard drew guns on him. Alistair showed up and demanded the guards lock up Fox. Gwen talked to “Ashley.” Katherine walked in and explains why she let Alistair have his way with her. Tuesday, April 5, 2005\n\nAt the Lopez-Fitzgerald home, Luis tried to convince Martin to help bring down Alistair by revealing his secret. “If I told you, it would cause so much more pain,” reasoned Martin. Luis called his pop a “liar and coward” because he remained mum. “You want to reconcile with us, then open your mouth….\n\nwhat kind of man has a chance to save his family and doesn’t?” An emotional Luis told Martin how hard he worked to make him proud, but now he doesn’t want him as a father….\n\nAt the Crane compound, Alistair told Katherine, Gwen and Fox that the person at Sheridan’s door will ruin her life forever. Katherine and Gwen pleaded with Alistair to save Sheridan. Alistair told Katherine she has to reward him for helping their daughter. He forced his wife into a kiss. Gwen yelled at Fox to put a stop to Alistair’s behavior. When Fox refused, Gwen ripped Alistair away from Katherine, but he pushed her to the floor. “I can hurt her again if you don’t do what I told you to do. Go to the bedroom,” Alistair threatened tp Katherine. Gwen begged her not to give in to Al, but Kat left. Alistair holds Gwen’s arms behind her back. “You sick freak, let me go,” she yelled. Alistair then told Gwen how close Theresa and Ethan have gotten while she’s been away. Alistair pointed out that she gets to keep Theresa’s baby if she stays there. Still, she pleaded for him to let her go back to Harmony. Again, Gwen cried to Fox for help. She asked Fox if he’s putting on an act; When he continued to act like a “playboy,” she called him a snake. After a torn Katherine put on lingerie, Alistair forced himself on her….\n\nWhile Chad blew up at Whitney, Ethan and Theresa entered the hospital room. Chad told Ethan that Whitney gave her baby away. Ethan, Theresa and Chad ganged up on a defensive, teary-eyed Whitney. “That baby deserves better than you, Whitney,” Chad said. He questioned Whitney about what she’s going to do when Fox returns. He then asked Ethan if it’s legal for her do give the baby up without Fox’s permission. Theresa assured that that she doesn’t agree with Whitney’s decision, but she has to support her friend. “Good job, who are you going to throw out of your life next,” Ethan said to Whit after she kicked Chad out. Chad overheard Whitney tell Theresa that if she told Chad, the baby would grow up with a horrible stigma. She covered by saying, “The stigma of being a black Crane.” A disappointed Chad left the room. Whitney cried to Theresa, she then asked time by herself. Chad refuses to find Fox in order to stop the adoption. Shortly after, he privately made a phone call….\n\nBeth walked in to Sheridan’s cottage demanding she return Marty. Sheridan explained that Alistair kidnapped the boy, but he is now safe. While the women argued, Beth called Sheridan a “stupid blonde.” Sheridan immediately had a flashback of the her kidnapper (Beth), dressed as a clown, calling her just that. Sheridan claimed that Marty is her son. Beth told Sheridan she is nuts, then punched her. Monday, April 4, 2005\n\nWhen Julian arrived at her cottage, Sheridan cried to him about Alistair taking Marty. When Eve arrived, Sheridan told her what was going on. Sheridan admitted that she still believes Marty is her son. Julian wondered if his sister could be right. Someone with a threatening note watched Sheridan from outside. Once Eve and Julian left, the mysterious person knocked on the door….\n\nChad grilled Whitney when he overheard her talk to Eve about giving her baby up for adoption. Whitney explained that she doesn’t want to get married, nor be a single mom. Whitney demanded Chad leave her alone. He then said she’s just like Eve, “Getting ready to throw her baby in the trash.” Chad told Whitney she has no heart or feelings….\n\nGwen pleaded to Alistair to let her and “Ashley” leave the Crane compound, but he explained that nobody will be leaving the premises because then word will get out about where Katherine is staying. Alistair told the gang that Whitney gave birth. While Gwen was thrilled by the news, Fox tried to brush it off by asking his gramps if he could borrow his black book to get girls to come over. “I’m not Ethan; I’m a Crane, which means the only person I care about here is me,” he said when Gwen questioned him about his odd behavior. A cocktail-swigging Fox claimed he is happy Alistair is trapping him in the luxurious estate. Alistair then informed an uncomfortable Katherine that Martin is reuniting with Pilar….\n\nTheresa (who is still walking with a cane), Paloma and Pilar tried to reason with Luis about accepting the fact that Martin is moving into the Lopez-Fitzgerald house. Luis refused to forgive his father and told him to get out of the house. Martin assured Luis that he wants to be a family again. Still, Luis believes his dad will leave again for Katherine. A teary-eyed Luis told the Lopez-Fitzgerald women that Alistair kidnapped Marty. Paloma asked a thrilled Pilar if they can go to church together. Martin found out what Alistair did and vowed revenge."
