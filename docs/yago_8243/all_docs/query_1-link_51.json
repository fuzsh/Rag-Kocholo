        "text": "Kurt H. Teil, F52\n\n1952\n\nKURT H. TEIL traveled from Karlsruhe, Germany, to his birth city of Hamburg to view the placement of his very own Stolperstein (Stumbling Stone) memorial in front of the home he left in 1939. More than 70,000 of these memorials, in the shape of cobblestones bearing brass plates on top, have been placed in the sidewalks in front of homes that Jews inhabited in Europe before they were deported to extermination camps or fled abroad. The German Spiegel newsmagazine and the Hamburger Abendblatt have covered Kurt’s 20th-century exploits as a Jewish refugee, ball turret gunner over Germany, war crimes investigator and Nazi hunter, civil rights activist in 1948, McCarthy hearing witness in 1949, and so on. After Fletcher, he joined the U.S. Foreign Service, and served within the Agency for International Development for three decades, retiring to Austria and Germany.\n\nTOM PICKERING, F54\n\n1954\n\nTOM PICKERING, see 1995.\n\nLEE E. DIRKS, F57\n\n1957\n\nLEE E. DIRKS retired after 47 years in the newspaper industry and now lives in Jupiter, FL, with his wife, Donna Bradley. Lee has devoted much of his retirement to collecting art, at first paintings of New Mexico by nationally prominent early American modernists and more recently Japanese woodblock prints from the 1680s to the 1920s. The Met in New York City is planning to exhibit about 40 of his more important prints until May 30; some 165 traveled to Japan in 2018–19 for a Nikkei-sponsored exhibition in four major cities, with a catalog entitled Popular Impressions: Japanese Prints from the Lee E. Dirks Collection.\n\nPHYLLIS ELLIOTT OAKLEY, F57\n\n1957\n\nPHYLLIS ELLIOTT OAKLEY moved to a retirement home in Ingleside, still in DC, in mid-December 2019, and found a few other Fletcherites. They were going to get together, but that’s on hold. She used to see CAROLE SAWYER DAVISON, J56, F57, often, but since COVID-19 hit, it is all via telephone.\n\nPETER KROGH, F61, F66\n\n1961\n\nA new book by PETER KROGH, The World’s Westward March: Explorers, Warriors and Statesmen, has landed on Amazon with a full house of five-star reviews. It follows the westward migration of “centers of initiative” and of the “main axis of commerce and communication” over the last 600 years.\n\nBRAD OELMAN, F61\n\n1961\n\nBRAD OELMAN has been retired for 20 years, and his interests revolve around his wife, Betty, and his five children and eight grandchildren. To be closer to the youngest ones growing up in Los Angeles, they are moving their summer residence from Cape Cod to Sherman Oaks.\n\nRAY DUNCAN, F62, F64\n\n1962\n\nRAY DUNCAN, see 1963.\n\nLORNE DYKE, F62\n\n1962\n\nLORNE DYKE sends his best wishes to all remaining members of the Class of 1962. He particularly wishes us safe transit through perilous times.\n\nFRITZ GILBERT, F62\n\n1962\n\nJane and FRITZ GILBERT are very thankful that the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t hit us before FaceTime, Zoom, and WhatsApp became widely available. Despite the pandemic, they’ve stayed in touch with friends and family to a degree that they would never have imagined. This year will be the first in 27 that they haven’t spent partly in Vermont. But they are adapting pretty well. Jane worked with a group of volunteers, preparing postcards that exhorted voters around Virginia to support Democratic candidates. The New York Times reported on this group’s efforts. Fritz continues to work part time for the nonprofit group known as the American Friends of the Episcopal Church of the Sudans (AFRECS).\n\nCAROL HURLBURT, F62\n\n1962\n\nCAROL HURLBURT’s good news is that her family members are staying well and socially distanced, mostly at home. Her efforts to register voters and get out the vote moved to the virtual sphere as the groups she worked with requested that those over 70 stay home. In addition to writing cards and letters, she was the contact person for the “Souls to the Polls” project sponsored by the church to which she and Sid belong. That involved working with a local interfaith charitable organization to register voters and help folks in underserved areas get to the polls. One of her and Sid’s daughters worked with the Biden transition team, and the other has completed teaching her virtual history class and returned to full-time work as an assistant dean at North Carolina State.\n\nHARVEY BURG, F63\n\n1963\n\nHARVEY BURG was given ADL Austin’s Lifetime Achievement Award in December.\n\nWALTER CARTER, F63\n\n1963\n\nIn early November, WALTER CARTER attended (via Zoom) Fletcher’s Global Issues Seminar, Climate Change Challenges and Concerns. He’s glad that the internet has made such things possible, but he looks forward to a return to in-person connections.\n\nGLENN COOPER, F63\n\n1963\n\nLike most everyone else, GLENN COOPER and Pam are hunkered down trying to help stop the virus spread and are appalled at how such common-sense behavior has become a national political issue. Onto foolish elderly stuff: Glenn sold his last motorcycle and bought another sailboat. He had his share of near misses with the motorcycle, and now he and Pam risk kidnapping by Somali pirates again. Not really. Plan is for the new, used boat to become a seasonal home as they return to spending winter months cruising around the Bahamas. Really wonderful to miss the TV news because you’re too busy spearfishing. After Thanksgiving, Glenn joined a Zoom call with BOB LEGVOLD, F63, F67, and RAY DUNCAN, F62, F64. They’re both in terrific shape and sound very busy.\n\nRON GLANTZ, F63\n\n1963\n\nNew York has lost its magic because of COVID-19, so RON GLANTZ moved to Rhode Island to be closer to family. Ron remains senior advisor to Pantera Capital Management, the leading blockchain investment firm and one of the largest institutional owners of cryptocurrencies. Gina founded and runs genderavenger.com, a community of activists dedicated to ensuring that women are always part of the public dialogue.\n\nLINDA GROFF, F63, F78\n\n1963\n\nThe Rev. LINDA GROFF is director at Global Options & Evolutionary Futures Consulting and emeritus professor at California State University, Dominguez Hills, where she taught for more than 40 years. She is working on two books: Sustainable Peacebuilding in a Rapidly Changing World: Holistic, Evolving Aspects of Peace, Nonviolence, & Community Engagement and Options for Future Human Evolution: Cutting-Edge Issues for Humanity and the World.\n\nBOB LEGVOLD, F63\n\n1963\n\nLike the rest of you, Gloria and BOB LEGVOLD are focused on trying to stay safe during the virus crisis and working remotely. The rest of their family, including the five grandchildren, seem OK. The youngest is finishing her Army medic training in Texas, and the oldest is super busy as part of the management team at Athena Health. Gloria continues her leadership role in several community organizations, although she stepped down as campaign chair for their state senator. Bob is still involved with a variety of projects and organizations, including a master’s program that he co-chairs in Moscow. He also co-chairs the American Academy of Arts and Sciences project Managing the Challenges of the New Multipolar Nuclear Age.\n\nMICHAEL SHARPLES, F63\n\n1963\n\nDee and MICHAEL SHARPLES took a six-day cruise to Captiva Island on their new boat, Morning Star, an 11-meter Beneteau Antares. The crew included grandkids Cole and Kinsey.\n\nLOUISE DECOSTA WIDES, F63\n\n1963\n\nLOUISE DECOSTA WIDES spent most of her adult years in Washington, DC, where she and her husband worked for the government. For 25 years, she directed the Information Division at the Federal Election Commission, explaining the campaign finance law to candidates, parties, and PACs. Today, she teaches English as a second language to adult learners. She has never enjoyed her work as much as she does now. She teaches virtually, using Zoom (with breakout rooms and shared screens). A steep learning curve. She suspects that Zoom and many other such tools will be with us for a long time—well after COVID-19.\n\nBILL MARES, F64\n\n1964\n\nRaised in Texas and educated at Harvard and The Fletcher School, BILL MARES is a former journalist, state representative, and high school teacher. He has authored or co-authored 18 books on subjects ranging from the U.S. Marines to desert travel, from war memorials to economic democracy, from brewing beer to beekeeping. From 2007 to 2018, he wrote more than 200 commentaries for Vermont Public Radio. He serves on the boards of VT Digger, the Vermont Beekeepers Association, the Vermont Brewers Association, and Food4Farmers. He lives in Burlington, VT, with his wife of 49 years, Chris Hadsel. They have two sons.\n\nCHARLIE STEVENSON, F64\n\n1964\n\nCHARLIE STEVENSON is at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, where he teaches courses on Congress and foreign policy and on the interagency process for national security. He worries about the financial and other challenges facing international affairs schools. Having worked for then-Senator Joe Biden from 1981 to 1985, he is hopeful about the new administration. He remembers fondly the close-knit life at Fletcher and wishes that students everywhere could have that kind of experience nowadays.\n\nLARRY STRUVE, F65\n\n1965\n\nThe Fletcher Class of 1965 was honored at the virtual Winter Celebration for the Januarian Class of 2021 on December 11, 2020. LARRY STRUVE, author of the 1965 class memoir In the Shadow of Camelot, gave the keynote address, which paid tribute to several classmates, including Capt. JAMES PATTON, F65, F72, JAMES FUNNA, BOLAJI AKINYEMI, F65, F66, SUCHIT BUNBONGKARN, ROBERT C. HORN III, F65, F66, F69, HUGO SPECHAR-GONZALEZ, PAUL HSU, and SANDAR VOGELGESANG, F65, F71. The address was recorded and can be viewed on Fletcher’s Facebook page.\n\nPETER ARMSTRONG HALL, F67, F75\n\n1967\n\nAt long last, PETER ARMSTRONG HALL reconnected with MASAO KAWAI. They reminisced about their years at Fletcher, including Ping-Pong after Walter Cronkite, Thanksgiving outings, incredible snowstorms in which Masao was entrapped, tennis, and studying in the library. They also remembered how, much later, Masao helped Peter name his eldest daughter, Taira. Peter hopes to see Masao and other Fletcher colleagues in post-pandemic time. Meanwhile, he has been cycling, reading, and spending time with his wife, Saskia. Their daughter CAROLINE ARMSTRONG HALL, F20, is rounding off her academic career at Cambridge, where she is studying international law.\n\nMASAO KAWAI, F67\n\n1967\n\nMASAO KAWAI has lectured at universities in China for the last 15 years. Because of the coronavirus, he was unable to go abroad this year, so he has been talking with his students in China online. He also talks with a couple of Europeans in French every week. In the fall, he gave an online lecture to about 100 Southeast Asian students. Masao wants to increase his contacts among young people in East Asia who could help promote peace in the region. After the coronavirus comes under control, he would like to go to neighboring countries and talk with young people again.\n\nSTEVE PENROSE, F67, F73\n\n1967\n\nSTEVE PENROSE and his family around the country thankfully are healthy. His life has been rather oddly busy, as his volunteer work has continued virtually through everyone’s new best friend, Zoom. For the first time in modern memory, Steve hasn’t visited an airport (except to renew his Global Entry pass, a reflection of blind optimism).\n\nJOHN STREMLAU, F67, F74, & CAROLYN STREMLAU, F67, F75\n\n1967\n\nJOHN STREMLAU and CAROLYN STREMLAU, see 1968.\n\nRICK WEINTRAUB, F67\n\n1967\n\nAlison and RICK WEINTRAUB arrived in Vermont and completed their quarantine just in time for a 40-inch snowfall. Nothing like 40 inches of snow to take your mind off just about everything else. A challenge to lift the shovel and toss the snow but also truly beautiful.\n\nVIVIAN WITKIND DAVIS, F68\n\n1968\n\nVIVIAN WITKIND DAVIS lost her husband, Jack, in March 2020. Jack died of complications from 28 years with progressive MS. They were lucky to get him out of the hospital and into home hospice just before the first wave of COVID-19 swept through Ohio.\n\nALAN MCKEE, F68\n\n1968\n\nALAN MCKEE and Marty have indeed survived, as have their grown kids and grandkids (whom they’ve hardly seen for a year, of course).\n\nSALLY KYLE MILLER, F68, & BRUCE JON MILLER, F68\n\n1968\n\nWith great sadness SALLY KYLE MILLER reports the passing of her husband of 50 years, BRUCE JON MILLER, who completed his life’s journey on January 7, 2021. His stunts while a student at Fletcher were legendary, including the parking lot snow removal hoax, as well as the nightly trips to Angelina’s for subs at 11 p.m. The friendships he and Sally made at Fletcher have lasted a lifetime. Donations in his memory may be made to The Fletcher School. On a happier note, Sally has been cancer-free for nearly three years following her 2018 surgery. She and her granddaughter have organized two local food drives and helped prepare weekend food packs for their local elementary and middle schools. Also, Sally’s genealogical research has turned up intriguing stories of punished Scottish rebels sold as indentured servants in New England, a Massachusetts fisherman captured by the French, a livery stable owner in Brooklyn in 1930, and a kosher butcher in Pueblo, CO, in 1910.\n\nPETER OLESON, F68\n\n1968\n\nPETER OLESON and Luuk are staying isolated in Kailua, on the windward coast of Oahu, where they are renovating a house they recently bought. They spend a lot of time babysitting their 8-year-old granddaughter and 1-year-old grandson. This helps their daughter and son-in-law, both of whom work from home, which makes child care a challenge. Peter continues to do research and write, having had several articles published over the last six months.\n\nCYRUS PARTOVI, F68\n\n1968\n\nAfter 28 years, CYRUS PARTOVI has retired as Lewis & Clark College senior lecturer emeritus in social sciences. Previously he served as director general in charge of international affairs for the Imperial Court of the late Shah of Iran. Just for the record, he asserts that he would not trade one day of his classroom lectures, in which he was constantly challenged by progressive, inquisitive minds, for all the imperial pomp and circumstance. However, he does admit to missing the freshly baked bread and the smell of the Caspian Sea.\n\nBARBARA PORTER, F68\n\n1968\n\nBARBARA PORTER is helping her continuing care community with financial and strategic planning, which it especially needs during these times. The pandemic has led to unexpected expenses, and revenue has been curtailed because of restrictions on new residents moving in.\n\nJAIME REIS, F68\n\n1968\n\nJAIME REIS continues to live in Lisbon and be a part of Instituto de Ciências Sociais Universidade de Lisboa.\n\nMARK REUBINGER, F68\n\n1968\n\nMARK REUBINGER’s career has included work for several nonprofit organizations, including the Ford Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts. For 17 years, he was the chief executive of the national nonprofit called LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corp.). LISC invests more than a billion dollars a year in the physical and economic development of low-income urban and rural communities. Mark retired in 2016.\n\nLEX RIEFFEL, F68, F69\n\n1968\n\nLEX RIEFFEL became a member of the board of trustees of Parami University in Myanmar in October. The university is a startup that will be Myanmar’s first private, nonprofit liberal arts college when its first class arrives in the fall of 2022. To learn more or to donate, Lex suggests going to parami.edu.mm.\n\nCHRISTINA SCHOUX, F68\n\n1968\n\nCHRISTINA SCHOUX hopes that the new administration will help restore the country’s role and influence in the world. On a personal note, it has been a difficult year for Chris, who lost her younger, California sister, Eva Hussey, to COVID-19 in June. She’s grateful for Zoom meetings and programs, and for the opportunity to spend three weeks in October visiting her daughter, a linguistics professor, and her two granddaughters, Vivi Belle, 11, and Clea Joy, 9, in Copenhagen.\n\nNEALIE SMALL, F68, & JONATHAN SMALL, F68\n\n1968\n\nNEALIE SMALL lost her husband of 51 years, JONATHAN SMALL, in late July. Her four grandchildren have been a vital part of her life, particularly since the summer. Support from her two married daughters, one of whom is a medical doctor, was critical during Jon’s time in hospice. Jonathan graduated from Brown and Harvard Law before coming to Fletcher. After a long career as a partner in the law firm of Debevoise & Plimpton, he served as the executive director of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York.\n\nKEITH SMITH, F68, F72\n\n1968\n\nKEITH SMITH has two sons who are mixed (Black and white), and his second son has two children who are half Chinese. Having grandkids representing such racial diversity ain’t half bad, he says.\n\nROGER SULLIVAN, F68\n\n1968\n\nROGER SULLIVAN announces the arrival of a “true” Fletcher grandson. Silas Sullivan Stremlau is the son of Roger’s daughter and her husband, Matthew Stremlau, who is the son of JOHN STREMLAU, F67, F74, and CAROLYN STREMLAU, F67, F75. The Fletcher genes live on.\n\nPATRICK CONNOLLY, F69, F71\n\n1969\n\nPATRICK CONNOLLY and his wife, Agnes, are enjoying their monastic solitude in Sonoma, CA. Patrick is sorry to report that the late-summer fires devastated thousands of acres of lovely vineyards around them. Heartbreaking to see all that beautiful agriculture destroyed, yet another cost of the changing climate.\n\nGEORGE LAMBRAKIS, F69\n\n1969\n\nGEORGE LAMBRAKIS is riding out the pandemic at his home by the ocean in Pornic, western France. Fletcher alumni in Britain, France, and elsewhere recently interviewed him via Zoom about his Foreign Service memoir, So You Want to be a Diplomat? An American Diplomat’s Progress from Vietnam to Iran, Fun, Warts and All. The memoir remains eminently available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and Alibris.\n\nCAROLYN SETLOW, F69\n\n1969\n\nCAROLYN SETLOW and her husband, Andy Shapiro, have been hunkered down in their country home in rural Connecticut since March 2020. Their only significant excursions have been visits to New York City to spend time with Josephine, their newly arrived first grandchild. Carolyn has been active locally in organizing food drives and has joined CUNY’s Graduate Center Lifelong Peer Learning Program. Thus far she’s pursued subjects ranging from Winston Churchill to artificial intelligence, Wagner’s operas to documentary films. Drawing on her studies at Fletcher’s Edward R. Murrow Center and her professional experience in public opinion polling and marketing research, she is preparing a 12-week study-group course, Public Opinion Polls: For Better or Worse in a Democracy?\n\nGREGORY SMITH, F69\n\n1969\n\nGREGORY SMITH and his wife, Fraya, are exploring the wildlife areas in rural Vermont and pursuing new lifelong learning programs. A course on the writing of memoirs and Zoom readings of plays have kept Greg modestly sane, or reasonably close thereto.\n\nJOHN CASWELL, F70\n\n1970\n\nJOHN CASWELL stayed happy and healthy and kept his head down in 2020. He’s praying and hoping for a better year in 2021.\n\nFARRI CRESS, F70\n\n1970\n\nFARRI CRESS continues to work closely with J Street and other U.S. organizations striving to bridge the gap between Israelis and Palestinians. Her particular focus is youth in Gaza who are struggling to pursue an education during the pandemic. Most rely on cell phones for their virtual studies, and she is trying to get computers to the 14 boys who remain on the Irene Meister Scholarship program. Farri has also sponsored a successful Shop with a Cop program in Wayne, NJ, where she has lived for the past 30 years. Through Shop with a Cop, police officers build positive relationships with disadvantaged children by taking them shopping and just having normal conversations with them.\n\nRICHARD (DICK) DOYLE, F70\n\n1970\n\nRICHARD (DICK) DOYLE and Eileen are back to their winter home in Cocoa Beach, FL. Although Dick has temporarily given up his volunteer work at Cape Canaveral Hospital, he continues to serve as a board member of the Community Transportation Association of America. Dick and Eileen spent the summer at their home in Ireland. They have found that it’s great to have a whole separate Irish life.\n\nMARY HARRIS, F70\n\n1970\n\nOn winter solstice eve, MARY HARRIS was waiting to see the confluence of Saturn and Jupiter. The ability to gaze skyward at something in common makes us Fletcher folks far flung throughout the globe seem closer to one another, she says. May we one day all be together again (51st reunion anyone?).\n\nANDREA JOHNSON, F70, & WILLIAM SPENCER JOHNSON, F70\n\n1970\n\nANDREA and WILLIAM SPENCER JOHNSON are both now in excellent health after medical events not related to the dreaded virus.\n\nCHARLES KOVACS, F70\n\n1970\n\nCHARLES KOVACS and Catherine returned to Budapest in January 2020 and have been there ever since, thanks to COVID-19. Restrictions in Hungary have been less severe than in the U.S. and Western Europe, and the quality of life has remained high along with the level of corruption, though they have not benefited from the latter. Social life has ranged from the diminished to the nonexistent, ergo, this has been a year with reading, the internet, and Skype as the main activities.\n\nAUGUST (GUS) MAFFRY, F70\n\n1970\n\nAUGUST (GUS) MAFFRY still lives with his wife, Elizabeth, in a Parisian suburb near Versailles and is at home a lot due to very strict French COVID-19 rules. He was closely following recent negotiations between the State Department and Congress that would affect compensation for bombing victims like him. By way of background, he quotes an article in the Exeter Bulletin: “The U.S. Supreme Court in May 2020 unanimously ruled that Sudan must pay punitive damages to certain victims of the 1998 Nairobi embassy bombing. Gus Maffry, who was injured in the attack, is one of the plaintiffs in the relevant lower-court ruling that was overturned.”\n\nTOM MARTIN, F70\n\n1970\n\nAlthough much of the Washington, DC, area was shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic, TOM MARTIN continued full time at a client site for Booz Allen. He observes that there are several new work rituals: a daily walk-through temperature check in the lobby, weekly COVID-19 tests, and some rather innovative (imaginative?) split shifts.\n\nCAROLYN PATTERSON, F70\n\n1970\n\nCAROLYN PATTERSON and Bill have been in lockdown, and it has been a remarkably uneventful year. They have been living at their property about 45 miles north of New York City since early March 2020. They look forward to widespread vaccination. Happily, Zoom has allowed Carolyn to continue most of her normal activities, including the always fascinating Off the Record lecture series on foreign policy.\n\nHARRY PETREQUIN, F70\n\n1970\n\nHARRY PETREQUIN and Katharine have been doing a lot of reading previously postponed. Harry reflects that this pandemic and the climate crisis have shattered the illusion of normalcy, redefined who we are, and shown us that we live in a world where everything is interconnected. He is heartened to see his three sons and their generation advocating for the code of conduct that our global community will need to survive.\n\nROY STACY, F70\n\n1970\n\nAfter considerable encouragement from friends and colleagues, ROY STACY wrote his memoir, A Delinquent’s Detour. It begins with his eyewitness account of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and then follows his professional life at USAID, most of it in Africa. Roy’s book is available on Amazon and through Archway Publishing. The title refers to his early years as a juvenile delinquent.\n\nROGER WALLACE, F70\n\n1970\n\nROGER WALLACE has been at his farm since March 11, 2020. That was when he returned from Los Angeles after seeing his first grandchild, who was born late that February. For those of us lucky enough to have a sustainable income and a roof over our heads, this year has been one of profound reset, he says. He doesn’t think we have begun to fathom what it means. He is optimistic about 2021.\n\nWILLIAM SARGENT, F71\n\n1971\n\nWILLIAM SARGENT wrote a novel called Terror by Error? The Covid Chronicles. It looks at times that medicine and biological warfare have intersected, from the early 1600s, when Native Americans encountered smallpox, to the SARS epidemic of the early 2000s. The focus then turns to COVID-19 and its impacts. Sargent, a recipient of the Boston Globe’s Winship Award, is a NOVA consultant and the author of 27 books about science and the environment, including Crab Wars: A Tale of Horseshoe Crabs, Bioterrorism and Human Health. To schedule a 45-minute virtual book talk, please contact Jill Buchanan at jbuchanan42@comcast.net.\n\nJOHN ENDICOTT, F73, F74\n\n1973\n\nGetting released from two weeks of isolation after returning to Korea on their 61st wedding anniversary was a highlight for JOHN ENDICOTT and Mitchie. Woosong University, which John has led for 14 years, was awarded a 2 billion won grant to integrate artificial intelligence and big data in the development of an autonomous railway system, including driverless trains. John’s leadership team also established a new English language school, the J.W. Kim College of Future Studies, at the university. Now the courses at four of the eight colleges of Woosong University are taught in English, and 230 of the 700-strong faculty are foreign.\n\nNIHAL GOONEWARDENE, F73, F74\n\n1973\n\nNIHAL GOONEWARDENE chair of The Fletcher Fund, is happy to report that it met all its challenges on Giving Tuesday, raising $173,107 from 428 donors. To help make that happen, he took a cue from that sage from the Windy City, Rahm Emmanuel. The dictum of the former Chicago mayor—that “a crisis is too important to waste”—prompted Nihal to redouble efforts to mobilize the recent activism of students and alums. Many rallied their finest instincts in support of Fletcher.\n\nHERB HOWE, F73\n\n1973\n\nHERB HOWE and Caryle were able to sample the sights in Sarasota, FL, and in Rhode Island while celebrating family weddings before the onset of the pandemic. They loved the beaches and two circus museums in Sarasota. Caryle continues gamely on her road to recovery from major transplant surgery in 2018. Good days outpace the rough ones. Herb, of course, continues to fret about our polity.\n\nNORM MOSHER, F73\n\n1973\n\nNORM MOSHER and Jan have rebranded themselves as Virginians. In a back-to-the-future move, they have left Alaska and returned to Irvington, VA, where they will reside at Rappahannock Westminster-Canterbury, a continuing care community. Norm says, “After you’ve seen the bear and caught the fish and the scenery has not moved, it’s time to go home.”\n\nSEAN RANDOLPH, F73, F78\n\n1973\n\nDespite the pandemic, SEAN RANDOLPH was busier than ever in San Francisco, producing work on technology and global economic issues for his think tank. The 2020 presidential campaign, in which he volunteered for Biden, was also a big focus, as were trail and mountain running. Even though all 2020 competitive races were canceled, he managed to pull off a 60-mile run across the North Cascade Mountains in Washington state in September. Meanwhile, his granddaughter Sky is now 2 years old and growing quickly. She, his son Ian, and daughter-in-law Joy live in the UK.\n\nSUZANNE RATZLOFF, F73\n\n1973\n\nSUZANNE RATZLOFF is sad to report the death of Dr. Sergey Fedorenko in April. Sergey lectured at Fletcher and participated in Professor Pfaltzgraff’s International Arms Control Symposium, which is where she met him during her Fletcher years. Sergey and Suzanne maintained close ties while he served in the UN Security Council’s Office of Disarmament and, later, lectured at the Naval War College, Georgetown University, and Salve Regina University in Newport, RI. Ever the brilliant mind, he quickly picked up medical expertise that allowed him to work with her through her boutique company, Health Research International, for two decades. Suzanne continues to live and work from her Arabian horse farm in West Liberty, OH.\n\nLISA ANDERSON, F74\n\n1974\n\nLISA ANDERSON joined the Fletcher Board of Advisors in the fall in her capacity as a trustee of Tufts University. She looks forward to direct engagement with Fletcher and the Class of 1974.\n\nNIHAL GOONEWARDENE, F73, F74\n\n1974\n\nNIHAL GOONEWARDENE, see 1973.\n\nMICHAEL K. SIMPSON, F74\n\n1974\n\nMICHAEL K. SIMPSON has been selected as a mentor/instructor for the Designing for Defense program at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He will support a project on space system anomaly detection. He has also been selected to mentor students in the Southern Hemisphere space studies program offered by the International Space University and the University of South Australia. For this program, he will support a project that explores the use of space assets to address the growing threat of wildfire. Both programs will be offered online.\n\nDAVID DEESE, F75\n\n1975\n\nDAVID DEESE’s oldest son, Brian Deese, of Belmont, MA, became the director of the National Economic Council for Biden in January.\n\nBRUCE STRONACH, F76\n\n1976\n\nIn early September, BRUCE STRONACH retired after serving for 12 years as dean of Temple University’s Japan campus and was appointed dean emeritus. Bruce has moved from Tokyo back to his house in Maine on Lake Messalonskee. He’s doing some writing, teaching a course at Colby College, and just trying to figure out what his second (third? fourth?) life is going to be.\n\nERIC HERMANN, F78\n\n1978\n\nERIC HERMANN is waiting out COVID-19 in the Rockies with a Bernese puppy. Still doing emerging markets but also devoting time to a biotech startup focused on wound healing and tissue regeneration.\n\nKEITH NICHOLS, F78\n\n1978\n\nKEITH NICHOLS, see 1979.\n\nDORAN HOWITT, F79\n\n1979\n\nDORAN HOWITT is now blogging at OccasionalEconomist.com.\n\nDENNIS JOHNSON, F79\n\n1979\n\nDENNIS JOHNSON thought that taking the chief credit officer job at a bank in Central California would be a capstone to his banking career. He also hoped that the good economy would last a few more years, after which he would retire. Then came 2020, COVID-19, and PPP loans, and the hits just keep on coming. He and Anne are empty nesters with one daughter in the horse insurance industry and the other pursuing a Ph.D. in equine microbiology at the University of Delaware. They have a place in Newark, DE, which has allowed them to visit Maria Elena and SCOTT THAYER several times now. Back in California, they keep talking about visiting Michelle and KEITH NICHOLS, F78, once the pandemic abates.\n\nADRIANA BOSCH, F80, F84\n\n1980\n\nADRIANA BOSCH completed a film in March 2020 that was featured at the Boston Latino International Film Festival. She is also the producer of part one of the PBS American Experience series Reagan. Part one of Reagan is based on an upcoming book by Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post titled The Triumph of Nancy Reagan. In that book, Tumulty argues that Nancy Reagan helped nudge her husband toward negotiations with the Soviet Union and thus was instrumental in ending the Cold War.\n\nMAHNAZ ISPAHANI BARTOS, F81, F85\n\n1981\n\nMAHNAZ ISPAHANI BARTOS was quoted in People regarding the Poltimore tiara, which Princess Margaret wore when she married Antony Armstrong-Jones on May 6, 1960. Mahnaz was identified as “a vintage jewelry dealer and scholar” and said that this tiara “was purchased for [Margaret] at auction in January 1959.” She also said that Margaret “couldn’t wait to wear it.”\n\nSUSAN CLARK LIVINGSTON, J79, F81\n\n1981\n\nSUSAN CLARK LIVINGSTON joined the Leadership Council of the Robert Fitzgerald Kennedy Human Rights organization in 2020.\n\nJEFFREY MCCAUSLAND, F81, F84\n\n1981\n\nIn September, JEFFREY MCCAUSLAND published a book called Battle Tested! Gettysburg Leadership Lessons for 21st Century Leaders. It is available on amazon.com. He has also started writing for NBC News at nbcnews.com/think.\n\nJONATHAN ADDLETON, F82, F91\n\n1982\n\nJONATHAN ADDLETON former U.S. ambassador to Mongolia, has been selected as the next rector/president of Forman Christian College in Lahore, Pakistan. Founded by the Presbyterian Church in 1864, Forman offers an American-style curriculum and has an enrollment of more than 8,000. Its alumni list includes former presidents, prime ministers, chief justices, governors, journalists, and academics in both India and Pakistan. Jonathan has also co-authored an article for The Hill with Alonzo Fulgham, who served as acting USAID administrator during the first year of the Obama administration.\n\nHUGH DUGAN, F83\n\n1983\n\nOn December 8, HUGH DUGAN celebrated the first anniversary of bringing U.S. hostage Xiueu Wang out of Iran. Hugh was acting special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the time. Since then, he has served in the National Security Council as special assistant to the president for international organization affairs.\n\nKIRK PATTERSON, F83, F91\n\n1983\n\nAfter cruising Japan full-time for six years, KIRK PATTERSON swallowed the anchor in 2019 to spend more time with his wife, Tsuyuko Sasaki, whom he met at a marina in 2015 and married in 2016. He sold his boat in early 2020. Shortly after retiring from cruising, Kirk established a marine tourism company to support other cruisers in Japan, organize yacht charters and tours, organize kayak tours, and help marinas and ports attract foreign cruisers. In spring 2020, he and his wife took in an adorable 2-year-old foster daughter, whom they hope to adopt in a year or two. Kirk reports that although (or perhaps because) it is rather late in life to try his hand at fatherhood (he turned 67 last October), it is turning out to be a most enjoyable experience.\n\nCHARLES ALTEKRUSE, F85\n\n1985\n\nCHARLES ALTEKRUSE has lived in Berkeley, CA, for more than 20 years. He worked for a decade in Silicon Valley for the likes of Apple, Intuit, and Sega before finishing his high-tech foray at Elon Musk’s first startup. Around 2000, Charlie switched to nonprofits, working on community relations for California Native Nations. He also married the love of his life, Barbara Banks, and bought a house and started a family. Barbara suddenly passed in May 2020 from cancer. Every day, Benjamin, 19 and a freshman at Lehigh, Jeremy, 12, and Charlie celebrate the gifts of love, grace, joy, beauty, curiosity, and patience they are blessed with because of their time with her. And, of course, they miss her. Charlie is now working to launch a global effort that would use the ideas embodied in the international Olympic movement to foster health and resilience in individuals, communities, and society.\n\nROSS KENNEDY, F85\n\n1985\n\nROSS KENNEDY has been living in Bloomington, IL, since 2002, working on the faculty of the history department at Illinois State University.

Sidney is a junior at the University of Illinois, while Eliot will be starting at the University of Minnesota in fall 2021.\n\nMARTIN SWARTZ, F85, F88\n\n1985\n\nMARTIN SWARTZ and his wife, Michelle, recently celebrated their 30th anniversary. They enjoy traveling and spending free time with their three children and four delightful grandchildren. The COVID-19 pandemic meant no big trips this year, but before that, Martin and Michelle got away to Geneva and the Alps, Israel, and Quebec. When not hiking to mountain waterfalls, Martin continues to work on foreign policy issues for the government.\n\nROBERTA JACOBSON, F86\n\n1986\n\nAmbassador ROBERTA JACOBSON and TOM WYLER, F05, published an article called “To Counter China, Look to Canada and Mexico” in Foreign Affairs in July.\n\nTOM KALIL, F87\n\n1987\n\nTOM KALIL, see 1995.\n\nLAURIE MACNAMARA, F87\n\n1987\n\nLAURIE MACNAMARA recently joined the U.S. General Services Administration’s technology transformation services as the director of strategic partnerships.

Laurie continues to make her home in Alexandria, VA, with her husband, BILL HENDRICKSON, F88, and their daughter Fiona.\n\nJILL MINNEMAN, F87\n\n1987\n\nFour Fletcher friends—JILL MINNEMAN, LISA ERRION, F88, MONIKA HUPPI, F88, and CARRIE THOMPSON, F88—masked up and hiked to Cabin John Island along the Potomac River on a warm day in mid-December. All are thriving with varying degrees of full-time employment, community service, and retirement. See more in 1988.\n\nJIM PACKARD-WINKLER, F87, F89\n\n1987\n\nBecause of the pandemic, JIM PACKARD-WINKLER and MARY PACKARD-WINKLER, F88, have been grounded from international travel for the first time since college days. But they have taken advantage of the beautiful Shenandoah Valley and the outdoors. Jim became vice president of the economic growth division of Creative Associates International in January 2020 after a wonderful 30-year career at the international development company DAI. Mary is consulting with various clients. Her work includes a global nutrition study of 17 countries that is financed by a Gates Foundation grant. Jim and Mary’s son Aaron, born in Fletcher Hall (now known as Packard Hall) and now 33, has worked at 3M in Minneapolis for the past three years and has just accepted a new job with Microsoft.

The pandemic has made international business a little difficult, because of closed borders, but since he has had seven years to develop relationships in Canada, he has friends who can step in and help. His daughter Kathryn had to leave her freshman year at Brandeis University in mid-March 2020, and she holed up with him in central New Hampshire for two months.
