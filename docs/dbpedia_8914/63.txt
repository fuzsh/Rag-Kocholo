Here’s part three of our humbling interview with the self-effacing and self-assured Soul Khan. In this final section, Khan touches on the musical influences of his that we’d least expect, his connection to John Coltrane, his recording process, the concept of the “self-made” man and much more. What’s astounding here is Khan swift ability to keep himself in check; just after he skewers the rap world for only encouraging artists to speak on their own stories, he addresses the cultural tensions that arise when trying to tell someone else’s story. Enjoy part three of “Soul Khan The Wise” below, and check out parts one and two, as well as the freestyle he dropped as soon as the interview wrapped.
