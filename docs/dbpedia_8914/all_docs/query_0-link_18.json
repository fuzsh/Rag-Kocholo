well, i exhale oceans how could they not know? they up the next male's colon this is for the pipe-dreamers with the 9-to-5 fever the hardest working fathers and the friday night divas i dedicate my resume to all my light sleepers who stay awake and wonder where they future might lead us\n\n2.\n\n1: they got my melatonin hella open, y'all, i'm sleeping on 'em but i'm so beyond that next shit, i'm quantum leaping on 'em and they're lambs to the slaughter, so i gotta feast upon 'em but j57 told me not to speak upon 'em well, gotta get your, gotta get your, gotta get your bars up i connect that live electric shit that lit the stars up y'all just bosses, i'm walking with a halo the way they're politicking got my mama sick, it's shameful this anglo's slick as a raincoat, get vehicular mangled if you think you can range rove with this con queso-getter from grayskull that delivers the fuego to incinerate them same old cliques they let the flood gates open, i don't like the result and i ain't concerned with swagger, homie, i'm an adult so fuck a photo up if you're still here for the music and holler at your man that be chilling with the chewstick hook: and the people sing can't you hear 'em sing? and they all sing so let's all sing and the people sing can't you hear 'em sing? and they all sing so let's all sing 2: mama-se, mama-sa, mama-ku-suck on my dick if you think that i ain't that sick you wanna clap that gauge? money act your age i got a massive range like i'm satchel paige i'm living proof that even if you sacrifice you only get a lil' dap as your asking price and seems like the ink dried all too fast you signed on that line but all you ass y'all some borderline barnacles, welcome to the chronicles so old school that my molecules got monocles fine women caught a few, ice dripping? nada. you ain't built nothing but a little lego block or two ain't a person i can shoot, that was a child once who never got a chance 'cause he ran with the wild ones rather sip a 22 than throw a clip in 22, 'cause going to a funeral ain't really nothing fun to do hook\n\n3.\n\nkoncept: i see your team is asleep but sleep is seeming to be keeps em reaching for dreams til I defeat em in speech we be speaking emcees and being free is a need i see a reason preaching like they was teaching to me 2010 run events nothing less than sold out moneys spent to run again tell your friends to go now updating statuses?, upgrade your caliber hold weight in your own hand no chance to flatter us it's make it and taking it I'm greedy with the whole stash can't recycle flows I believe it's what we call trash hockey puck knuckle punch evacuate the premises always has to happen drinking Jack in great measurements slap shots break glass should of worn your face mask you skating pacing on the ring I'm bringing what you lames lack hmmm, just the face off a stick to your abdomen have to set the fight the degree that we master in homeboy sandman: live from the dead of the winter with no coat and no skully here's one verse you can take personally get served, no shoes, no shirt, no money my balls don't break nor burst for nobody my clique nah trust conduct our own studies and stick cops up for donuts go nutty back before all these condos shot up everywhere so if you got manos put em in the air thump knock babies from car seats haunt Queens stomp crop circles in concrete Boy done broke outta quarantine hopped up off the top turnbuckle on your uncle and auntie boy king, brassknuckled and undaunting swashbuckler speech beyond your belief how much more unprofessional can anybody be? now everybody sleep 8thw1: i don't know man, i'm just not feeling it it's kind of hard for me to take this serious do you know the power that i'm dealing with when all i do is talk and they're like, \"he's killing it?\" so i'm winging it like paul mccartney crash the party with a baby in a car seat then bag a bad chick give her the game and now the dame playing with my joystick like atari to marty mcflys i'm the future take you out of character, you shook...michael j. fox i like it, i take it, fuck \"may i\" just say \"bye\" like confused gay guys but i don't need to be around that i need a crib somewhere in the adirondacks c.b. radio's only contact grow a beard, contemplate not coming back 'cause other than a-ok and the brown bag i ain't heard nothing past not bad so my favorite mc is me and homeboy sandman...my bad soul khan: i'm a bad motherfucker and a passionate lover looking for a smooth chick with her ass on the cover people say soul khan is delusional because i don't hold back on these juveniles you see, i too once was a clueless child so i'mma flunk your high school musical ain't none jihad-er, time bomb with a lit wick it's all fun and games, 'til a socket gets slick ricked concocting a sick, sick, sick (666) scenario even my burial plot probably got big twists just like shyamalan, yes i kamika-- --ze these weak-kneed automatons and you can see me at comic con teaching the padawans how to geek out like i'm leading a synagogue phenomenal with that heatrock spittle leave the beat so brittle it should be hospitalized and that's that, homie, soul knows best my tracks slap like motorboating oprah's breasts brown bag, a-ok, we're the coldest yet we run the whole damn table, money, fold the deck\n\n4.\n\nPlace That Birthed Me 02:25\n\n1: it's like straight from the city of sunshine and silicone even on the busiest streets, you still feel alone unless you're repping a set or set to direct a mill or millimeter's how they measure respect they say the weather is best, but sometimes it rains and sometimes it bleeds 'cause drugs line the veins of all kinds of fiends, they all got the need in the hills and the ghetto and what lies between got one life to lead, but two different faces prime real estate for the youthful and famous too many cops are abusive and racist but white folks still staying glued to the matrix chicks drop stacks for rags on rodeo then they hit the strip to sniff some more yayo dudes on the street sipping forties like they're drano the city where the angel pawned his own halo hook: let's take a trip to the place that birthed me home of roscoe's and big game worthy los angeles, i can't love it enough so no matter where i'm at, i put my w's up 2: now, i could spit a reference to different intersections but that wouldn't capture california in its essence the asphalt is scalding beneath your chucks wherever we post up, there's burrito trucks and the traffic in the city turns the corner to a jukebox bumping ever genre from foreigner to tupac peace to the homie selling oranges a few blocks up, now he's got a small fortune in his tubesocks it's where i learned to freestyle with ease and fluency used to hear people preach peace and unity the women were an infinite spectrum of thickness and greeted every increase in heat with nudity now i'm in the east with a dream and a tunnel vision you gotta leave home to see home for what it isn't so some day, i'll return like the sun arisen and on my mama's mama, i hope that nothing's different hook repeats\n\n5.\n\nFor That 03:33\n\n1: before terrorism had arisen to fight i'd stay up for the wake up show and i'd listen at night just to know what was officially tight, get it cassetted made my fat tapes while classmates sweated for extra credit but me, son?
