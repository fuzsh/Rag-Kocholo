        "text": "I got a chance to post another update!\n\n----------------------------------\n\n--Chapter Seven--\n\nThe Beta Quadrant\n\n2261.85\n\nAboard the USS Enterprise, life went on pretty much as it had for the last year. Hopping from one system to the next, looking for life signs, seeing if any present civilisations were space-faring yet. Kirk was adamant that they obey the Prime Directive this time around. The last time he'd ignored it, a good friend of his had died. It hadn't been directly related, but it was close enough in his mind that he didn't want to risk pissing off any sadistic diety that might be listening in.\n\nAt present, they were near the Brinthini system, where Doctor Leonard McCoy, known affectionately to Kirk as Bones, was trying his hardest to convince the captain they needed to visit on shore leave.\n\n\"Jim, if I spend more than two more days on this ship, I'm going to lose it.\"\n\nKirk held up a hand. \"Alright, alright! There's one more system between us and Brinthini. It's supposed to be uninhabited.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Then why are we going?\"\n\nThe captain shrugged. \"The civilisation vanished, Starfleet has no idea why. They last surveyed . . . ten years ago? They want us to swing by, see if we note any changes that might explain things. I think it's a waste of time, but it should be fast and easy.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's what I thought about my ex,\" Bones said under his breath. \"Fine. What's this planet called, anyway?\"\n\nKirk poked at the display on his captain's chair. \"Uh . . . Doesn't have an official name, just a designation. CX-431. There's three planets, but the first doesn't really count, since it's a nice, toasty rock. Says here the atmosphere burned away a couple millennia ago. Then there's CX-431 Alpha, and CX-431 Beta. Beta's a gas giant. Alpha's the one Starfleet wants us to peek in on.\"\n\nHe turned to the navigator and pilot. \"Hey, Sulu, how close are we to CX-431?\"\n\n\"We should be there in a few minutes, Captain,\" Hikaru Sulu replied. \"Coming out of warp now.\"\n\nThe Enterprise dropped out of warp, and they found themselves at the edge of a small solar system, with a yellow sun similar to Earth's. Near them floated CX-431 Beta, a blue-green gas giant nearly as large as Jupiter. The system was on the edge of a brilliantly coloured nebula, space awash with purple, blue, green, and red gases.\n\n\"Wouldja look at that,\" Bones said. \"Now that's somethin' to look at.\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's . . . Okay, it's pretty,\" Kirk laughed.\n\n\"Pretty, Captain?\" Spock asked from behind him.\n\n\"Well, yeah! Look at it, Spock! It's all rainbow-y and sparkly!\"\n\nOver at the communications station, Uhura snorted.\n\nThe planet they were aiming for was currently closest to the nebula, in its orbit around the star. It, too, was jewel-like, with green fields, blue oceans, and white, fluffy clouds. Smaller than Earth, just a little, it looked peaceful and serene.\n\n\"Scan for seismic activity, volcanoes, that kind of thing,\" Kirk directed his crew. \"Also life. Just for the hell of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nSpock moved to stand next to Kirk's chair. \"It certainly looks habitable. Perhaps we should make an excursion to the surface, and-\"\n\n\"Captain,\" Sulu said, interrupting the first officer. \"I'm picking up life signs on the surface. Seventy-fo- no, seventy-five individual signatures.\"\n\nKirk had been leaning back in his chair, somewhat lazily, and now he sat forward. \"Run that by me again?\"\n\n\"Seventy-five individual life signatures. They're registering as humanoid.\"\n\nThe Vulcan tipped his head. \"Perhaps, Captain, a nearby system has ventured out to colonise? Brinthini, perhaps?\"\n\nJim Kirk stared at the planet, as it grew larger in the viewscreen. \"I dunno, Spock. I've got a bad feeling about this.\"\n\n\"Is that not a quote from a fictional character in the 'Star Wars' series?\" Spock inquired. \"That disreputable smuggler, I believe.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Spock, Han Solo's awesome. Sulu, you've got the con. Spock, we're going down to the surface. Uhura, you're with us. We might need to talk to people.\"\n\n----------\n\nTheir new home was almost done. Anthea was pleased with the space. It wasn't fancy, but Khan and Joachim had put in fireplaces in both the living room and in the master bedroom. Annoying as he was, it turned out Joachim was actually good for something.\n\n\"This is lovely,\" she told her husband.\n\n\"We still need to finish installing the generator and the electricity. And I'm afraid the plumbing isn't quite up to twenty-third century standards.\"\n\n\"Alright, so I didn't put toilets on the list of things to steal from Starfleet.\"\n\nHe snorted.\n\n\"It'll be fine. We'll upgrade when we make a trip to Brinthini to trade. We may not have a lot in products, but I stashed away a fortune in Vulcan, Romulan, Klingon, Betazed, and Ferengi credits, just to name a few.\"\n\nKhan made a face at the mention of Klingons, but before he could make any snide remarks about the species, he was interrupted.\n\n\"Khan!\" Otto burst into the cabin. \"Khan, there is a . . . vessel approaching.\"\n\n\"What kind?\"\n\nHis lieutenant hesitated. \"I . . . do not know, Kaiser.\"\n\nImmediately on alert, Khan strode out of the cabin and grabbed one of the phaser rifles from the table at the centre of camp, one he himself had designed while at Starfleet. Anthea was hot on his heels, Nolan tucked against her side.\n\nIt was a Starfleet shuttle, emblazoned with \"NCC-1701\" on the side, and it had just come to rest at the edge of the village.\n\nAnthea swore vehemently.\n\n\"Sit!\" Nolan repeatedly gleefully.\n\nKhan spared her one brief, amused look before levelling the rifle at the door of the shuttle. \"I thought, darling, you said they didn't know where we are,\" he said.\n\n\"I took great pains,\" she said, \"but Kirk seems to have preternatural luck.\"\n\nAnthea was decidedly less than thrilled at the thought of seeing James Kirk again. She'd met the man only once, a year before, and things had been left very awkwardly. At the time, she hadn't known Khan was still alive, and she had, in a moment of extreme weakness and loneliness, had one night of . . . not precisely passion, but intimacy with the Starfleet captain. Her husband was aware of it, and didn't seem to be angry with her.\n\nKirk's continued safety over the matter was little more debatable.\n\nAs they watched, the ramp of the small vessel lowered. Out of it stepped four people: James Kirk, the Vulcan named Spock, Lieutenant Nyota Uhura, and a lithesome blonde Anthea was disgusted to recognise as Dr. Carol Marcus.\n\n\"Oh, look, it's the brat who can't keep her nose out of things,\" Anthea muttered to her husband.\n\n\"I see she's walking again,\" he replied in kind.\n\n\"Why wasn't she walking?\"\n\n\"I broke her leg.\"\n\nAnthea didn't blame him in the slightest. If Carol Marcus had been able to keep out of their business two years before, Khan wouldn't have had to flee Starfleet, or fear for her life and those of his people. He would have been able to smuggle them to safety. She wouldn't have spent so long without him.\n\nTheir unwelcome guests approached with their hands up, well aware they were walking into a situation they had no chance of leaving if they pissed off the colony's leader. Kirk took the fore, hands above his head.\n\nAt last, the tall, burly blonde captain spoke. \"You know, when we scanned and detected life down here, this was not what I was expecting to find. Hello again, Khan.\"\n\n\"James Tiberius Kirk,\" Khan intoned. He flicked a switch on the rifle, changing it from \"stun\" to \"kill\". \"I cannot say it's a pleasure.\"\n\nThe landing party from the Enterprise waited in tense silence, knowing they were sitting ducks if Khan and his men decided to press their advantage.\n\n\"Get off our planet,\" Khan growled. \"This is not Federation territory. We have claimed this world as our own. Have you not done enough to us, Captain?\"\n\nAnthea pushed his rifle down, so that it wasn't aimed directly at the Starfleet captain. \"All we want is to be left alone,\" she told Kirk. \"To not be imprisoned and exploited and used as slaves.\"\n\n\"'We'?\" Uhura repeated, stepping forward. \"You're not one of them!\"\n\n\"You do not speak to Kaiser Khan's wife so!\" Otto burst out, and several others grumbled their agreement.\n\nKhan held up a hand, silencing his men with a simple gesture. \"My wife is, indeed, one of us,\" he said. \"Any who suggests she is not will face my wrath.\"\n\nKirk took a few steps towards them. \"I should arrest you and haul you back to Earth!\" he exploded, pointing at Anthea.\n\n\"Over my dead body!\" Khan roared, and brought his rifle back up.\n\nAnthea handed Nolan to Kati and shoved between the two men, bracing a hand on each of their chests. They were both considerably taller than she, but they stopped advancing on each other when they realised she was in their way.\n\n\"Khan,\" she said softly. \"Let me handle this.\"\n\nHer husband's jaw tightened in anger, but he gave a terse nod.\n\nShe looked to Kirk. \"Don't do this. We came here to live in peace.\"\n\n\"He's a criminal!\" Kirk burst out. \"And so are you!\"\n\n\"And it's not a crime to condemn a man to an eternity in frozen silence, without a trial?\" She had to tip her head up to look at him. \"Please . . . Jim.\"\n\nThe way she said his name instantly transported him to a year ago, in his apartment near Headquarters, when she'd cried in his arms over the death of her husband. When she'd let him seduce her, while he'd known that Khan was, in fact, still alive.\n\nHe shoved aside the memory of her writhing in his arms and gritted his teeth. \"Fine. For now, I won't kill him.\"\n\n\"Ever,\" she snapped. \"I'm not kidding, Kirk. All we want is to live here, quietly, on our own, and not be subject to the whims of Starfleet.\"\n\n\"You and your husband are fugitives,\" he said. \"You broke at least a dozen regulations doing this-\"\n\n\"It may come as a surprise to you, Kirk, but my family is more important to me than the whole of Starfleet. Which, let me remind you, I joined before you did. Don't lecture me about regulation or the bloody Prime Directive or what-have-you. We're not in Federation space, and these people are not Federation citizens.\"\n\nShe jabbed him in the chest with a finger. \"Now, you can finish your bloody survey or whatever the hell it is that brought you here, but when you're done, you need to get the hell off our planet.\"\n\n\"It's not your-\"\n\n\"It is now,\" Anthea said. \"It's not a Federation territory and there are no other claims on it, aside from ours. That makes it our planet.\"\n\nKhan rested the rifle against his shoulder. \"She happens to be correct, Captain. Even according to your precious Federation law, which we do not recognise as we are not part of it, this planet is ours now. I'll give you one day to conduct your survey, but then I expect you to leave this system and forget we are here.\"\n\nKirk folded his arms across his chest. \"And if I don't? How will you make us leave the system?\"\n\n\"Kirk,\" Khan drawled. \"If you're not off this planet within twenty-four hours, I will make sure you don't ever leave it.\"\n\nHe stalked off, back towards the cabin construction site, leaving Anthea to be the less volatile diplomat.\n\nThis chapter was . . . interesting to write.\n\n----------------------------\n\n--Chapter Eight--\n\nKirk turned to Anthea, who held her hand up to forestall anything he might have said.\n\n\"You may be under the delusion you have any say here, Kirk, but you don't. I did that on purpose. Now, if you'll excuse me, we actually have to work for a living here, and I have things to do.\" She headed towards the cargo hold of the Reliance, skirt fluttering, to retrieve some things she'd need when the house was finished. To her annoyance, Kirk followed her aboard the ship.\n\n\"I have nothing more to say to you, Captain,\" she shot over her shoulder. \"I've said everything already.\"\n\nKirk caught her arm, pulled her back. \"Anthea. What are you doing with this guy? I mean, seriously? He's a monster.\"\n\nShe yanked herself free. \"He's my husband, Captain Kirk. The one you conveniently forgot to mention was still alive when you took advantage of me. At least he's honest with me.\"\n\n\"You're right. I shouldn't have- Didn't we discuss this a year ago? Agreed it shouldn't have happened?\"\n\n\"That doesn't change the fact that you lied to me and you-\" She gritted her teeth. \"Do you have any idea how it made me feel to learn that my husband, the man I love, was imprisoned in a cryotube and I- let you do things to me that-\"\n\nShe couldn't even get the words out.\n\n\"Fine. I'm guilty of being a man. I didn't think you needed to know. You were better off thinking he was dead.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't!\" she screamed, slamming her fist into his chest. \"Do you have any idea what it's like to lose someone, Kirk, someone whose loss feels like half of you has been ripped away? Of course you don't, so you don't care how badly I ached without him. You have no concept of what it was like, waking every morning without him, not knowing if he was alive or dead, suspecting he'd been killed but not knowing. All the unanswered questions, the pain, and you took advantage of me when all I wanted to know was where my husband was.\"\n\nKirk looked stricken, the colour draining out of his face, as he realised just how mistaken he'd been about her motives all this time. \"I'm . . . sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't think-\"\n\n\"That doesn't absolve you, and it doesn't absolve me. It makes me sick to think of what I did. I lied to Khan and told him I instigated it to get information out of you. If he were to find out the truth, Kirk, he would kill you. And I'm not thrilled at the idea of having him angry at me, either.\"\n\nKirk shook his head. \"There's no reason he would find out the truth.\"\n\n\"Is there not?\"\n\nThe low timbre of Khan's voice came to them from the doorway. Anthea took an instinctive step back from Kirk. \"Khan,\" she said.\n\nHer husband stepped into the hold with a deceptively casual poise. His hands were relaxed at his sides, but Anthea knew him well enough to see he was seething with rage. Sometimes, he hid it really well, but she knew him now. She knew what the little tic by his right eye meant.\n\n\"I came to get a bandage from the medbay,\" he explained, \"as Joachim hammered a nail into his thumb. I do not know what I'll do with that boy. Imagine my worry, hearing my wife screaming at someone.\"\n\n\"We were just discussing . . .\"\n\n\"Oh, I heard every word. Every word that was relevant, at least. I suspected you weren't telling me the whole truth,\" he said to Anthea, but he never took his eyes off Kirk. \"You are not that ruthless, my love.\"\n\nKirk stepped between Khan and Anthea. \"Don't you even think about hurting her!\"\n\nKhan's smile was cold. \"Captain, Captain, Captain! I would never dream of laying a hand on my beloved wife. You see, I understand that she was alone for so long, that she thought me dead. Why wouldn't she, if she thought she was a widow, find solace? I cannot blame her for that.\"\n\nThen his eyes went from chilly to nuclear in a millisecond. \"But you, Kirk. You knew what she did not. You admitted just now that you lied to her, tricked her into breaking vows she takes seriously enough to violate your precious Prime Directive for me, to commit treason for my people.\"\n\n\"Look, Khan, it was a mistake, we'd been drinking-\"\n\nIn a dark blur, Khan closed the space between them, his fist pounding Kirk right in the face with the force of a bullet train. The blonde man's head snapped back and he flew several feet. Before he landed, Khan caught Kirk with a hand around the younger man's throat, and slammed him into the wall, suspended off the floor by the one-handed grip.\n\n\"I can forgive her,\" he hissed, as Kirk choked. \"Because I love her, and I understand her. But you . . .\"\n\nKirk's fingers scrabbled at Khan's hand, couldn't find sufficient purchase to break his hold. Not that he would have been able to. No one could match Khan Noonien Singh for sheer physical strength, not even that Vulcan, Spock. The only way Spock had won that fight was through Uhura's intervention, and his own dazement after the crash. Kirk was only alive now because Khan still held back. He could have taken Kirk's head clean off if he'd wanted to. After all, tearing one off was only a small step up from crushing a skull with one's bare hands.\n\nThe Starfleet captain's face was red, and he gasped, desperate for air.\n\n\"Khan,\" Anthea said. \"Please, don't kill him.\"\n\nHe tipped his head her direction, though he didn't look over. \"Do you have some affection for him, wife?\"\n\nShe might have once had a lingering . . . fondness that came from their one, shared night, but no longer. \"No, I just don't want to deal with the consequences if we end up with a dead Starfleet captain on our hands. He's Starfleet's golden boy, remember? Also, the cleanup isn't something I feel like dealing with today. Do you know how difficult it is to get blood out of silk?\"\n\nKhan turned his head, regarded her in silence for several moments, with a slight smile.\n\nThen he let go of Kirk, and the younger man collapsed to the floor, wheezing as he sucked in much-needed oxygen. Khan aimed a savage kick at the prone Kirk's ribs.\n\nAnthea caught her husband's arm. \"Khan! Khan. Don't kill him.\"\n\nKhan shifted his attention her, his gaze softening. He gently stroked her cheek, once again the picture of calm. \"I do forgive you,\" he told her softly. \"What you did for me is enough to forgive any number of sins.\"\n\nThen he pulled away, turned on one bootheel, and stalked out before his control snapped and he killed the whelp after all.\n\nKirk rolled to his knees and doubled over, coughing violently. Anthea looked down at him somewhat dispassionately, much calmer than she'd been before.\n\n\"Did I mention that my husband has super-hearing, Captain?\" she asked. \"I said I didn't have anything to discuss with you.\"\n\nKirk turned blood-shot blue eyes up to her. \"Still can't believe you married that guy.\" His words were broken and hoarse.\n\n\"Love makes us do crazy things sometimes, Captain Kirk. At least I know I can trust him.\"\n\n\"He lied to you for months, though!\"\n\n\"Not about what mattered, Captain. He never lied about loving me, and he never lied to me about the most important things in our lives.\" She crouched, didn't offer him any assistance. \"You see, I understand now why he did the things he did. He was protecting me from Marcus by keeping me in the dark. You ever stop to think, Kirk, what Marcus would have done to me if he'd known I'm Khan's wife? I would have died, and Nolan with me.\"\n\nBy now, Kirk was on his knees. He cleared his throat, did it again. \"He's killed people.\"\n\n\"Technically, so have I. So have you. What Khan didn't tell you, when he was imprisoned on your ship, is that Marcus threatened to kill me just for being close to him. The man you saw then thought he had lost everything. Would you do any different?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't go rampaging around, killing people indiscriminately in revenge!\"\n\nAnthea smiled wryly. \"But isn't that what you did, Kirk? When you took those torpedoes to Qo'noS, intending to kill my husband? You didn't kill Khan, in the end, but wasn't that fuelled by the need for revenge? If you think it wasn't, you're more deluded than I thought.\"\n\nShe rose, leaving him there, and exited the hold. She found Khan waiting for her there.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she told him. \"That I didn't tell you the whole truth.\"\n\nWordlessly, he caught her hand, hauled her down the corridor to the medbay. Yves was there, and Khan snapped, \"Out!\"\n\nOnce Yves had vacated the room, Khan locked the door, shoved Anthea against it, and kissed her hard. Part of her hated that it thrilled her when he got demanding and pushy like this. The rest really didn't care.\n\n\"Khan,\" she gasped. \"Is this really the best-\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" he growled. \"It's this or I go back in there and I tear Kirk limb from limb.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't want that on my conscience,\" she murmured wryly, and stood on her toes to kiss him.\n\n. . . I had to!\n\nOkay, but on a more serious note . . .\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n--Chapter Nine--\n\nSpock arched a brow at his captain when Kirk emerged from the Reliance. The human's face was red and swollen, the beginnings of bruising around the eye and cheekbone rivalling the ring forming around his neck.\n\n\"I'm only gonna say this once,\" Kirk muttered, \"but I deserved it.\"\n\n\"Am I to assume that you ran afoul of the colony's leader?\" Spock inquired. \". . . Again?\"\n\nCarol exclaimed in dismay when she saw him. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Khan took exception to my, uh . . .\" Kirk cleared his throat. His larynx was bruised, as well. \"I sorta . . . slept with his wife last year.\"\n\n\"It is a wonder you are still breathing, as that was a spectacularly foolish thing to do,\" Spock observed.\n\n\"Anthea stopped him.\" Kirk avoided looking at Carol.\n\n\"And yet, he does not have issue with her actions?\"\n\n\"Apparently not. Can we change the subject?\"\n\nHe'd overheard quite a bit from Khan and Anthea--mostly Anthea--as he'd passed the medbay on his way out of the ship, and Kirk couldn't help feeling a little irritated. She hadn't sounded like that when he'd- Kirk stopped that thought in its tracks. Obviously, there was something wrong with the woman, that she'd let him treat her that way. But it was none of his business, as Khan had made painfully clear.\n\n\"Let's get that survey done,\" he croaked at Spock. \"And get the hell off this rock.\"\n\n\"I was under the impression you wished to bring Khan and his people into custody, or Anthea Harrison at the very least.\"\n\nKirk gestured to the little village, where nearly everyone watched them. \"We're outnumbered, Spock. Seriously. We'd have to blast them from orbit to get them into custody, and there's a kid over there I don't feel like hurting today.\"\n\nCarol took his arm as they got back into the shuttle. \"You need Dr. McCoy to look at you. I think your cheekbone is fractured.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, considering the guy hits like a Mack truck . . .\" Kirk touched his cheek, winced. \"Uhura, contact Bones, get him to beam down. We shoulda brought him down the first time.\"\n\n\"You had no way of knowing Khan would-\" Carol began, but Kirk interrupted.\n\n\"I suspected,\" he said. \"When Sulu said there were seventy-five people down here? I suspected. Seventy-three Augments, including Khan, and his wife and kid.\"\n\n\"But you couldn't know,\" she insisted softly. \"Don't beat yourself up about it.\"\n\nKirk laughed bitterly. \"Ah! Ow! He did that enough for me. Jeez, that hurts.\"\n\nSpock and Uhura moved into the cockpit, giving them a small amount of privacy.\n\n\"You never mentioned that you'd . . . slept with her,\" Carol said.\n\nHe looked down at his hands. \"It was just once, a year ago, and it's not something I'm real proud of, Carol. I'm sorry. I'm saying that a lot today.\"\n\n\"If you think I'm hurt, or angry, I'm not,\" she whispered.\n\n\"No, no. For bringing you down here when I suspected it was Khan. I forgot for a minute that he . . . killed your dad.\"\n\nThe blonde woman sighed and shifted to sit in the seat beside him. \"My father . . . brought his death on himself, Jim. Do I like being near the man who killed him? Heavens, no. And I'd likely kill him myself if I could. But you don't poke a tiger and then get offended when it bites your arm off. My father knew Khan was a tiger, and he put him in a cage and prodded him until he snapped. I loved my father, but . . . I cannot hold Khan entirely to blame.\"\n\n\"Really? After what Khan did, right in front of you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm angry, unbelievably angry. I just recognise that Dad made himself a target. I'm angry at Khan, I'm angry at Dad . . .\"\n\nHe turned, caught her hand. \"You're not angry at me for anything, are you?\"\n\nShe smiled a little. \"No. I'm not angry at you.\"\n\nUhura turned in her seat and called back, \"Dr. McCoy is on his way, Captain. He said he'll get his medkit and beam down. He also said to tell you that you owe him.\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" Kirk muttered. \"Thank you, Lieutenant.\"\n\nJust a few minutes passed before a knock sounded at the shuttle door, and Bones appeared with his medkit. He took one look at Kirk and did a double-take.\n\n\"Kid, you look like you went twelve rounds with Mohammed Ali.\"\n\n\"Who?\" Kirk asked.\n\nBones opened his mouth, thought better of it, and closed his mouth. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Went half a round with Khan. Meaning I opened my big mouth and he attempted to kill me.\"\n\nThe doctor snorted. \"And here I thought your near-death experience had tempered some of that stupidity,\" he snarked. \"Wait a minute. Khan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Carol said. \"It seems we've stumbled across the missing dictator and his people.\"\n\n\"Huh.\" Bones pulled out some equipment and set about dealing with Kirk's injuries. He injected Kirk with something just behind his jaw. \"Did you know your face is broken?\"\n\n\"No, I dithn't,\" Kirk said sarcastically. \"Dathe it, Boneth!\"\n\n\"Had to numb you, you wouldn't like this one if I didn't.\" Bones injected him with something else.\n\nKirk shrieked.\n\n\". . . Okay, you'd like it even less if I hadn't numbed you.\"\n\nThe captain batted at his face. \"Boneth! Whad'd you do?! Ahhh!\"\n\nCarol gave the doctor a worried look.\n\n\"It's a new serum for bone repair,\" Bones explained. \"Haven't had the chance to test it 'til now. I suppose I could have asked Khan for some of his blood, but under the circumstances, probably don't have a very good chance of that, right?\"\n\n\"Dabbit!\" Kirk gasped. \"I gonna kill you!\"\n\n\"Don't be such a baby. It's the fastest way to fix your face.\"\n\nThe searing pain subsided finally and Kirk sagged against the bulkhead, glaring at Bones with tears streaming from his eyes, an involuntary reaction from the pain. \"Theriouthly, Boneth, I gonna kill you an' make you inna thoeth.\"\n\n\"Pardon?\" Carol murmured.\n\n\"Shoes,\" Bones said, translating for Kirk. \"He's gonna make me into shoes. Good luck with that, by the way.\"\n\nKirk shot him a rude gesture, and McCoy laughed.\n\n----------\n\nAnthea was still straightening her long skirt when she emerged from the Reliance and went to retrieve Nolan from Kati.\n\n\"I am surprised there was not bloodshed,\" Kati remarked as Anthea took the toddler.\n\n\"There was, actually, but it's settled for the moment.\" Anthea checked her son, but he seemed to be unperturbed by the goings-on.\n\nKati frowned, looking a lot like her brother when she did. \"What was that about? Who are these people?\"\n\n\"They're from Starfleet,\" Anthea told her. \"Captain James Kirk and his crew, of the USS Enterprise. Remember, I told you about them going after Khan?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. The blonde man is the captain? He is not how I pictured him.\" Kati looked over at the closed-up shuttle. \"A man arrived a few minutes ago. He appeared in a light.\"\n\nNolan reached up and grabbed Anthea's nose. She laughed and kissed his small hand. \"That would be transporter technology. It means we can teleport from ship to surface. The Reliance has a two transporter pads, but we haven't used them.\"\n\n\"Oh. That is so interesting. I think I would like to experience it someday.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can do that sometimes. Some people don't like the sensation. Who was the man that beamed down?\"\n\n\"Beamed? Oh, teleported? I do not know. He had a black case with him.\"\n\n\"Likely their doctor,\" Anthea said. \"Given the beating Khan gave Kirk.\"\n\nKati arched a raven brow. \"Why did he do that?\"\n\n\"Let's just say that there are . . . tensions between them. They've tried to kill each other several times in the past.\"\n\n\"And yet, they both defer to you?\"\n\nAnthea pressed her cheek to the top of her son's head. \"I was . . . very briefly involved with Kirk, a long time ago. And they're both aware of it.\"\n\nHer sister-in-law snorted. \"Male posturing over a female?\"\n\nShe thought of Khan strangling the life out of Kirk, and why. \"Something like that.\"\n\n----------\n\nWhen the shuttle left to conduct its surveys, Dr. McCoy opted to stay in the village and observe \"the locals\". He was the only one of the Enterprise crew Anthea could actually say she liked, mostly because he took his oath to help others seriously, and he had been so good with Nolan the first time they'd met.\n\nAs soon as Yves discovered there was a twenty-third century doctor on-planet, he sought out McCoy and the two men immediately hit it off.\n\n\"Irritated as I am that they are here, I think Yves's new friendship with Dr. McCoy could be advantageous,\" Khan remarked in an undertone to Anthea. \"He is, after all, the man who derived the serum from my blood, and could give us insights into how to help Kati.\"\n\n\"And Yves learning some modern medicine might be useful later, what with the baby and all. I know women have been doing it for millennia, but I'm still scared.\"\n\n\"Yes, I agree.\" Khan rubbed his hand over her back.\n\nAnthea smiled to herself. Ever since she'd told him she was pregnant, he'd become more publicly affectionate. It might also have had some influence from the subtle hostility towards her from certain quarters, but Anthea thought the baby had more to do with it. He was happy and less defensive against the world at large, secure in their relationship, and it spilled out.\n\nShe leaned her head against his shoulder. \"What will we do if Kirk won't leave?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure. I need to find leverage with the man. Something he needs enough to make him compromise his overdeveloped sense of right and wrong.\"\n\nHis wife chuckled.\n\n\"What is it you find so amusing?\"\n\n\"Just that we're so casually discussing coersion and extortion, as if we were discussing the weather.\"\n\nHe smiled faintly. \"Kirk has gone to survey, but I'm certain he's thinking of a way to capture me, our people, and imprison us again.\"\n\n\"We dismantled all but two of the cryotubes, recycled them into refrigerators,\" she pointed out. \"That's the only way he could possibly keep you locked down. And if he tries, I'll kill him.\"\n\nKhan laughed and kissed her temple. \"I adore you.\"\n\nShe ducked her head. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you the whole truth, about Kirk. I felt so . . . stupid and used, and I didn't want to admit that I'd . . .\"\n\n\"Anthea.\" Khan turned her, gripped her arms. \"I am not angry with you. Desperate times make us do desperate things. I hate the thought of you in another man's arms, but I understand why. It was a single indiscretion, and it worked in our favour in the end. What enrages me is that he lied to you, and that he thinks he has some sway over you.\"\n\n\"He doesn't hold anything over me,\" she assured him softly. \"Since I met you, I've never wanted anyone else. That night with Kirk was . . . because I was so lonely, and he acted as if he cared.\"\n\nHer husband drew her close. \"I know your reasons, Thea. You don't need to explain.\"\n\nShe sighed. \"I tried so hard to find someplace Starfleet wouldn't come, at least for a long time. And yet . . . How did they find us so quickly?\"\n\n\"As you said, Kirk possesses an unnatural amount of luck.\"\n\nNolan, his leash pinned under Khan's foot, toddled over from inspecting a stick and grabbed his father's pantleg in grubby hands, trying to haul himself up. Khan stooped to lift his son into his arms. Nolan thunked his head against Khan's chest, a blissful smile on his little face.\n\nKhan looked down at his son, a little bemused. \"Is there anything in particular you wanted, Nolan?\"\n\n\"Hug Dada,\" the seventeen-month-old said. \"Love Dada.\"\n\nHis father's face went through a wide array of emotions in the space of a few seconds. Watching the visible struggle, Anthea could barely contain a grin. Khan tried so hard to be the invincible and stoic leader, and then Nolan went and did something that turned the former dictator to mush.\n\nKhan brushed his lips against the top of his son's head. He caught the look on his wife's face, and flashed her a grin. \"My weakness,\" he told her softly. \"You and Nolan are my Achilles' heel.\"\n\n\"It's okay to have one. You and No are mine.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine you having one.\"\n\nAnthea reached over, ran a fingertip over the curve of Nolan's ear. \"You didn't see me at my worst. I could barely hold it together after I lost you.\"\n\n\"But you managed,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Only because I had our baby to live for. I really don't know what would have happened if . . .\" She trailed off, nodded her head. \"Incoming. Doctor McCoy.\"\n\nKhan stiffened. Feeling his father's tension, Nolan turned his head to see what was going on.\n\n\"Doctor McCoy,\" Khan said, greeting the Starfleet officer.\n\nMcCoy's brown eyes flicked over to Anthea. \"I've been talking to your doctor,\" he told Khan. \"You've got some interesting theories, but I think I found the flaw in your work.\"\n\nArching a black brow, Khan handed Nolan to Anthea. \"There was a flaw?\" he drawled.\n\n\"A very tiny one. We were thinking you'd like to come have a look.\" McCoy turned to Nolan. \"Would it be possible to bring the kid, and your sister?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" Anthea said. \"I'll go find Kati and bring her and Nolan along.\"\n\nKhan gave her a nod, and he followed the doctor to the the Reliance. Nolan reached up and caught a handful of Anthea's hair.\n\n\"No, sweetie,\" she said. \"Don't grab Mummy's hair. Let's go find Auntie Kati, hmm? Daddy needs her.\"\n\nI totally see him as teen!Nolan now. I have to hunt down younger pictures now. Ha ha ha.\n\nI think, with the right motivation, Khan would be a husband and father. I mean, we don't know what he's like when he's not on a homicidal rampage . . .\n\nSpock is so Vulcan-snarky in my head. I don't try to write his dialogue, it just comes out. Actually, they all do it, come to think of it.\n\nObviously, there was something wrong with the woman, that she'd let him treat her that way. But it was none of his business, as Khan had made painfully clear.\n\nObviously, Kirk. If that makes you feel better.\n\n[/quote]\n\nI've got this posted elsewhere with the sex scenes intact, gotta cut 'em out to post here, so Kirk overheard . . . a lot. *cough*\n\nSomething about Lindy always felt a little off to me. I dunno. I hated writing her after a while. With Kati, I don't feel that way. I may want to smack her sometimes for messing up my plotting, but stop writing her? Nah.\n\nMe, too. *sigh*\n\nWell, she wasn't Intelligence/Section 31 for nothing. She has killed people before. It was part of her testing/training when she was recruited. Anthea just doesn't talk about it.\n\nI adore Nolan. I want one just like him. With my luck, though, I'll get a little snot like Kirk.\n\nThanks! I saw the movie again tonight, and he really does care. I can't imagine he had a happy childhood, and his people are the only ones who accept him. They're his adoptive family. They're all he has left. I think he would be incredibly, fiercely protective of what's his, especially of a child that is half him, you know? Next chapter in just a sec.\n\nThey should, shouldn't they? Thanks!\n\n--Chapter Ten--\n\nWhen Anthea carried Nolan into the medbay, she had to suppress a momentary flashback to earlier. Catching Khan's eye, she saw him smirk briefly. Damn the man. How did he always know what she was thinking?\n\nKati trailed behind her. She'd been experimenting with dyes made from local plants, and had made herself a brightly-patterned sari, wearing it over the utilitarian clothes Anthea had managed to acquire from Starfleet. She and Khan didn't subscribe to any particular religion or social traditions; she just liked the look, she'd told Anthea, and it reminded her of home.\n\nNolan tried to leap from his mother's arms, chanting, \"Dadadadadada!\" Khan plucked him up, before he could tumble to the floor. Holding the squirmy child with one arm, he said to McCoy, \"My sister, Khatri Kaur. Kati, this is Doctor Leonard McCoy.\"\n\nMcCoy glanced up from the microscope, then did a double-take. He quickly scrambled to his feet and held out a hand. \"Pleased to meet you, Miss Kaur.\"\n\nKati shot a smirk at Anthea, then shook the doctor's hand. \"Please, call me Kati. You are with Starfleet?\"\n\n\"I am, yeah. I'm the chief medical officer on the USS Enterprise. Please, have a seat so I can get a look at you, see if we can do something about this problem of yours.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Doctor McCoy.\" Kati boosted herself up onto one of the beds and folded her hands in her lap, smiling at the doctor.\n\nBehind McCoy, Khan raised both brows. He turned an astonished look at his wife. Beside him, Yves looked thunderous.\n\nAnthea sidled up to Khan and murmured, \"I think Kati has a fan.\"\n\nTo Yves, she said under her breath, \"As an American classmate of mine at the Academy was fond of saying, 'You snooze, you lose'.\"\n\nSince McCoy was occupied with Kati, Anthea took the opportunity to extract a blood sample from Nolan, while Khan held their son. She took as little as possible, hating it the whole time. When she was done, even though it was a painless procedure, she kissed Nolan's little arm.\n\n\"All done, sweetheart,\" she murmured. \"Shall I take him, or do you still need him?\"\n\nKhan handed Nolan over. \"You can take him. If we need him for anything, I'll find you.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" She gave his forearm a squeeze, winked at Kati, and left the medbay.\n\nAnthea dragged Nolan's playpen in from his room and set it up by her work station, plopping him down in it with his bunny. He rolled to his back and hugged the fuzzy green toy to his chest.\n\nPulling up her log on the computer, she started a new entry.\n\nDear Mum and Dad,\n\nI've lost count of what day it is for the colony. We've\n\nfinished all but the last cabin now. Khan was working on it\n\nuntil the ship from Starfleet showed up.\n\nI had hoped that they would never find us, but I figured\n\nthey would eventually. I never expected it to be so soon,\n\nor for it to be the USS Enterprise. In all honesty, the\n\ninevitable confrontation between Khan and Captain Jim\n\nKirk went a lot better than I anticipated, meaning that\n\nKirk was able to walk away from it.\n\nKirk wants to take Khan and his people back into custody.\n\nI don't know how we're going to dissuade him otherwise. I\n\ncan't go through losing Khan again. I will personally kill\n\nKirk if I have to, to keep my husband here. I'm pregnant\n\nagain, and a repeat of two years ago would destroy me, I\n\nthink.\n\nDoctor Leonard McCoy is here, working with Khan and\n\nYves to find a solution to Kati's illness. I like Dr McCoy.\n\nHe's a bit of a curmudgeon, but Kati seems to have\n\ncharmed him. I think she may be flirting with him to\n\nmake Yves jealous, but I don't know. It's nice of him to\n\nhelp us, considering that Khan attempted to destroy the\n\nEnterprise and, by extension, kill Dr McCoy.\n\nI want Starfleet to just go and leave us alone, but I can't\n\nthink of a way to get Kirk to-\n\nThe chime at her door sounded. Anthea saved and closed the file before she went to answer it. Yves was there, looking distraught.\n\n\"He is flirting with her!\" he burst out. \"And she with him!\"\n\nStifling a sigh, Anthea stepped aside to let him in. She hoped the Starfleet incursion ended soon, because the drama they'd caused was quickly going to be unbearable.\n\n----------\n\nThe early morning was taken up with running scans on Kati's brain functions, and with readying a serum that McCoy had apparently been up all night fiddling with. Khan had been there with him for most of it, so Anthea hadn't slept well as a result. She never did sleep well without her husband beside her.\n\nHer morning sickness wasn't helping matters. She didn't always throw up, but the frequent nausea and the fatigue made her feel vile. Only Khan's request that she be there for the testing of the serum had her up and in the medbay.\n\nShe sat off to the side, watching quietly, as they ran the scans and established current baselines for her brainwaves. Kati looked nervous, so Anthea moved over to stand beside her, holding her sister-in-law's hand as McCoy administered the serum.\n\n\"I don't know how fast this'll work,\" the doctor cautioned. \"Or if it will.\"\n\n\"It is worth a try,\" Kati told him.\n\nHe injected her with something to induce a coma, and Kati went limp, eyes closing. Her vital signs dropped, jumped, dropped again, and then stablized.\n\nKhan stood on the other side of Kati's bed, eyes fixed on the readout of her vital signs. His tension sang through the room.\n\n\"You see this part here?\" McCoy said, indicating the brain map. \"This is the damaged part. Every seizure causes damage, increasing the risk of another seizure, and we gotta repair that as well as fix whatever caused the nervous system problem in the first place. Otherwise it'll just start all over again.\"\n\nThe map lit up as the serum found its way through Kati's blood to her brain. The woman on the table hissed and jerked, in spite of her unconscious state.\n\n\"See, this is why human cloning and genetics manipulation like you guys is banned,\" McCoy muttered. \"Even now, the results are unpredictable.\"\n\n\"If she dies-\" Khan began.\n\n\"She won't die. I isolated the gene that made her reject your blood and neutralized it. That's what happening now. I feel like I'm playing God here, you know. Rewriting a woman's DNA.\"\n\nIt took hours. The serum burned its way through Kati's entire body, through every cell fed by her blood, and flipped the switch that kept Khan's blood from fixing her. Then McCoy administered the second serum, the one created from a mixture of Khan's and Nolan's blood. That one specifically targeted her nervous system. Anthea didn't really know how it all worked. She didn't need to know. She was there for moral support for Khan, just in case things went wrong.\n\nKati's vitals fluctuated, and her muscles tensed and relaxed in erratic spasms. McCoy kept stealing glances at Khan, as if bewildered that the man he knew as a killing machine was so worried over his sister.\n\nAt last, the woman on the bed relaxed and her vitals stabilized once more. McCoy lifted one of her eyelids, flashed her with a light.\n\n\"I'm gonna keep her in the coma until afternoon,\" he said at last. \"Just so we can watch her. Then I'll bring her out of it and we'll see what effect it's had, but going from her brain map, it seems like it's repaired the seizure damage to her right hemisphere.\"\n\nKhan finally relaxed. \"Thank you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"Just so we're clear, I did it for her, not you.\"\n\n\"I had no delusion otherwise, Doctor McCoy. Nevertheless, you have my thanks.\"\n\n----------\n\nThe Enterprise's shuttle returned shortly before McCoy was scheduled to bring Kati out of her coma. Because Khan was with his sister, Anthea went out to greet it, reluctant as she was.\n\n\"You done with our doctor?\" Kirk asked, as he left the shuttle.\n\n\"Just about. He's in our medbay with my sister-in-law. How did your survey go?\"\n\n\"Same results as the previous one, which I'm sure you have.\"\n\n\"As a matter of face, I do,\" she replied sweetly. \"Now, about you leaving-\"\n\nMcCoy appeared, exiting the Reliance. He was followed by Khan.\n\n\"She's awake,\" the doctor said. \"Jim, you're back!\"\n\n\"Who's awake?\" Kirk asked.\n\nKhan ignored the captain. \"Her vitals are good, and there is no sign of abnormal brainwaves. It seems it worked. You have my heartfelt thanks, Doctor McCoy.\"\n\n\"Again, who?\"\n\n\"My sister-in-law,\" Anthea reminded Kirk. \"As I just said. Doctor McCoy was kind enough to see if he could assist us with Kati's epilepsy.\"\n\n\"I think it worked, but I'm gonna stick with 'cautiously optimistic'.\"\n\nKirk frowned. \"Oh . . . kaaaaay.\"\n\nKhan finally looked at Kirk. \"Which brings us to our unresolved problem. What do I need to do, to convince you to leave us here?\"\n\nKirk's jaw clenched. \"I-\"\n\n\"Captain!\" Uhura came out of the shuttle, looking upset. \"Enterprise just sent us a message; they caught a distress call from a nearby system. They're being attacked by Klingons. At least one raiding party is on the surface.\"\n\nIt all went through Kirk's brain in a flash: Qo'noS, fighting a patrol of Klingons. Their small party nearly dying until a very unlikely rescuer appeared and single-handedly took them out.\n\nKlingons didn't have much of a fighting chance against the Enterprise when it came to space battles, but on the surface . . .\n\nHe turned, looked at Khan. The other man's face was impassive, but he clearly understood, had likely realised it seconds before Kirk himself.\n\n\"We can't take them on alone,\" the Starfleet officer said, his voice rough. \"And I can't sit back and let those people get killed.\"\n\n\"My people will help on one condition,\" Khan informed him, somehow managing to keep the gloating out of his voice. Finally, he had the leverage he'd wanted. \"You leave us here, to live out our lives in peace, and you do not tell Starfleet where we are.\"\n\nIt wasn't even really a question, in the end. What choice did he have?\n\n\"Done,\" Kirk said.\n\nHe was limping. It took him a bit, and they were . . . loud.\n\nI'm actually considering writing a companion piece to \"Scars\", telling the events of STID from Khan's POV. In the scene where Kirk runs in and goes \"Why's there a man in that torpedo?\", just before Kirk run in and starts running his mouth off, Khan's sitting on that horrible cot, all by himself, looking down at the floor, and he just looks so sad. I found myself wondering what he was thinking right then, and . . . Well, I'm gonna write it, eventually.\n\nAnthea's just as protective of her family as Khan is. She's not as strong or skilled, but she loves her husband passionately, and her love for her son is beyond words. I think she underestimates herself, too.\n\nSeriously, Bones writes himself. I just write down what he says in my head. I haven't once had to edit a single line of his dialogue because it just wasn't right. It's always right. The only character I've struggled with in the slightest is Rodriguez.\n\nOf course it's never that simple! If it were, there'd barely be a story.\n\nYeah, all Khan wants is to have his world with his people, and for Starfleet to leave him the hell alone.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n--Chapter Eleven--\n\nKhan quickly selected twenty of his men, opting to leave Otto in charge, Chin as his second. Thirty-one of the colonists were women, forty-one men, not including Khan and Anthea, and twenty of the men leaving took half of the toughest warriors. The women, too, were capable fighters, but a good number of them had expressed to Khan they did not want to be soldiers any longer and had no wish to go along to fight Klingons.\n\n\"They're becoming too domesticated,\" Khan muttered good-naturedly, as he selected a phaser rifle from the table.\n\n\"I will make them go hunting,\" Otto said. \"Keep their edge up.\"\n\nKati shuffled out of the Reliance, looking tired. Anthea couldn't imagine how the woman felt after what her body had been put through. \"What is going on?\"\n\n\"We're going to hunt Klingons,\" Khan said. \"They've attacked a nearby system and I intend to deal with the threat.\"\n\nHis sister frowned. \"And leave Anthea here?\"\n\n\"I don't want to go,\" Anthea said quickly, before Khan could say anything. \"I'm good staying here. I'd like to get a start on decorating the cabin, anyway.\"\n\n\"We should not be gone long,\" her husband assured her.\n\nYves appeared beside Kati. \"What are you doing out here? You need to rest! Come back inside!\"\n\nKhan watched the doctor guide her back to the ship.\n\n\"I don't want you to go,\" Anthea whispered. \"What if this is a ploy to capture you again?\"\n\nKhan caught her face in his hands, his voice a low rumble meant for her ears only. \"That's why I'm leaving some of my people here. If I do not return, you can use the Reliance to come after me. That said, I believe Kirk's desperation to save these people, to clean up after the attack at the least, is very real. This is my chance to strike a deal with him, my love. If I do this, he will leave us alone. I don't believe James Tiberius Kirk is a man to betray his own honour. He is too much . . . how did you put it? Starfleet's golden boy.\"\n\nA memory flashed in his mind, of the bridge of the USS Vengeance. When faced with Admiral Alexander Marcus's plan to start a war with the Klingons, Kirk could have easily shot the man, killed him to stop him. But he hadn't. He'd wanted to stun him and force him to stand trial back on Earth. It had been Khan who had taken the step to deal with the matter directly. Kirk was too good, didn't have the guts, as Marcus had said.\n\nAnthea pressed her hand to his upper abdomen, then fisted his shirt in her hand. \"Okay. But you come back to me this time, alright? You disappear again and I won't sit back and wait. I will hunt you down.\"\n\nKhan grinned. Not caring that they had Kirk and his crew for an audience, he dipped his head to kiss her rather thoroughly. She sighed, pressing closer. He kissed like no other, with singular and intense purpose.\n\n\"I will be back,\" he murmured against her mouth. \"You can be sure of that. Nothing will keep us apart again, Thea. I would raze Heaven and Hell to reach you.\"\n\n\"You'd better. I love you.\"\n\nHe pressed a kiss to her ear. \"And I love you, my Thea. Be safe whilst I'm gone. I'll be back soon.\"\n\nThen he stepped away. Before her eyes, he shifted from devoted husband to warrior, his face going hard, losing all expression. It sent a shiver down her spine.\n\nHe gestured to the men he'd selected to join him. They all filed aboard the shuttle. It would be a tight fit, but only the Starfleet officers would complain.\n\nAt the door, Kirk and Khan were the last to board. They stared at each other in macho silence, then Khan gave a brief nod and stepped through the door. Kirk paused, glanced back at her, shook head head, and went aboard.\n\nKati stepped up beside Anthea and handed Nolan over. \"Men,\" she said. \"Though I cannot say the blonde one is not pretty to the eye.\"\n\nAnthea snorted. \"Everything isn't what it says on the tin,\" she muttered.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" her sister-in-law inquired curiously.\n\nThe shuttle lifted off. Anthea ignored Kati's question, absently stroking her hand over Nolan's dark, silky hair as she watched the vessel containing her husband get smaller and smaller as it disappeared into the atmosphere.\n\n----------\n\nThe shuttle, dubbled Galileo II, settled on the shuttle bay floor and disgorged its occupants. Khan was the first of his crew to leave the shuttle, and he stood for a long moment, the others flowing around him, as he was dragged back through memory to the last time he'd been here.\n\nHe had surrendered on Qo'noS, so that Kirk and his crew would bring him here, aboard this ship, where his own people slumbered, encased in cryotubes that had held them for centuries, within torpedoes that Alexander Marcus had forced him to design.\n\nThe ship had not changed, to his eye. It had undergone repairs, certainly, after all the damage dealt to it by the USS Vengeance, first at Marcus's hand, then at his own. But it was still the same ship, still evoked the same vague sense of panic that even now ghosted along his nerves.\n\nHe had more control now than he had then. He'd been a prisoner before, sacrificing his freedom temporarily to be near his crew. Now, he was on more even footing with Kirk, and he had his own men with him.\n\nAnd yet, he could not help a small frisson of fear brought on by the sense of deja vu that standing here inspired.\n\n\"Khan?\"\n\nHe turned cold eyes to Kirk. \"My men will need quarters, as long as we are here. Something a little more comfortable than the accommodations you afforded me on my last visit.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Kirk drawled, \"the brig isn't meant to be comfortable. Lieutenant, show our guests to their quarters on deck eighteen.\"\n\nThe captain pushed past Khan, issuing orders to his crew. The lieutenant Kirk had addressed, one of the security officers, was a dark-skinned man with a thick mane of black, coarsely-textured hair, heavy brows, and strangely flat teeth. He gestured for Khan and his crew to follow him.\n\nEach cabin had two beds, and a bathroom joined every two rooms. Khan had his own quarters, both as the uneven remainder and as the leader of the group. He didn't miss that there were extra security officers posted near their assigned lodging. It amused him that Kirk thought the additional officers posed any sort of threat to Khan and his people.\n\nOnce the men were settled, Khan went up to the bridge to join Kirk. It was the first time he'd been to the lauded and holy command deck. The blinding white of the environment was irritating. He much preferred the bridge of the Vengeance, but that ship was long-since scrap: piece-mealed, Anthea had told him, to repair the very city it had devastated.\n\nHe kept his opinion to himself, however, as he stood one step down from the captain's chair, behind the navigation station, hands at his sides.\n\n\"We were headed to the Brinthini system next, anyway,\" Kirk remarked as he settled into his chair. \"If we hadn't detoured and come across you guys, I can't imagine what would have happened if we'd be there, unprepared, when the Klingons attacked.\"\n\n\"Died,\" Khan said flatly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You would have died, Captain. I do not say this derogatorily. It is a statement of fact, Kirk. You and any you had taken to the surface would have been slaughtered at the hands of the Klingons. That is why you need me, is it not?\"\n\nKirk opened his mouth to speak, then thought better of it. \"Right. So. Sulu, how far are we from Brinthini?\"\n\n\"Uh . . . Hour and a half at warp eight, Captain.\"\n\n\"See if you can push it to warp nine,\" Kirk said. \"Scotty says the core can do that.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nKhan arched a brow at Kirk. \"Cannibalized the Vengeance, did we?\"\n\n\"Made a few improvements with some spare parts someone left lying around,\" Kirk shot back.\n\nAt his station, Sulu snickered.\n\nGrudgingly, Khan thought, Score one for Kirk.\n\n----------\n\nIt didn't take long to reach Brinthini. When the Enterprise arrived, they found a Bird of Prey still in orbit, indicating the Klingons remained on the planet. As they prepared to head to the surface, Kirk paused in strapping on a bit of body armour, confiscated from some smugglers a while back.\n\n\"You seem to be disturbed by something, Captain,\" Khan said. His own \"preparation\" consisted of strapping on an extra phaser he accepted from one of the security officers currently passing the weapons out.\n\nKirk looked at his hands. \"What did you do to me?\"\n\n\"Pardon?\"\n\n\"Your blood. When they gave it to me, to revive me, it . . . did something to me. Changed me.\"\n\nKhan's pale eyes crinkled at the corners, but his expression didn't change otherwise. \"I would imagine that your senses have improved and your thought processes are faster, as well? Interesting. I wonder if the effect is more potent with blood straight from the source, rather than a derived serum?\"\n\nThe captain stared at him. \"I knew you were a cold-hearted bastard, but-\"\n\n\"Did you really expect me to have sympathy for you, Captain?\" Khan gave him a humourless smile. \"After everything, you honestly thought that I would care?\"\n\n\"You seem to care a lot for your family.\"\n\nKhan's eyes narrowed dangerously. \"My family is of no concern to you, Kirk.\"\n\nThe captain pointedly rubbed the bruise around his throat. \"Yeah, you made that pretty clear.\"\n\n\"Then let us make another thing clear, Captain. You may have had my blood taken from me to revive you. That does not make us kin or any kind of relation to each other, no matter the changes my DNA may have made to yours. The only reason I am helping you now is because I saw a chance to gain leverage. A favour for a favour, if you will. I scratch your back, you scratch mine. I have no sympathy for the people of this planet we are going so gallantly to rescue. They are of no real concern to me.\"\n\nKirk leaned against the railing. \"Uh-huh. And what would Anthea have said if you'd elected to ignore the attack?\"\n\nKhan smirked. \"You do not know my wife as well as you think you do, Captain. One night with her did not make you an expert, and it certainly did not win you her allegiance. That has always been and shall always be mine. And if I . . . elected to ignore this attack by the Klingons, she would have abided by it. Anthea is a practical woman, Kirk.\"\n\n\"Let's face it, Khan. You're not any happier that the Klingons are in this area than we are. They've gotta know, or at least suspect, about you, right? I mean, we told them John Harrison was wanted by Starfleet, and we hauled you off after you took out their patrol. What'll happen if they find out who you are, what you did to them all by yourself? They probably won't take kindly to a guy like you kicking the **** out of them.\"\n\n\"There were no survivors, Kirk. How could they know it was me?\" The dark-haired man clenched his hands unconsciously into fists at his sides.\n\n\"We're assuming there were no survivors,\" Kirk responded. \"We didn't stick around long enough to make sure. What if one did?\"\n\nThat idea hadn't occurred to Khan, and he didn't like it. It was further proof that he'd been off his game those few weeks. If he'd been thinking clearly, he would have made certain they were all dead before approaching Kirk to surrender.\n\nHe watched the security officers as they left, then turned to his men. \"We hunt Klingons, not the Brinthi. Brinthini's people are tall, slender, pale, with blonde hair, purple eyes, and webbed hands and feet. Klingons are large, with dark skin, usually dark eyes but sometimes blue. Most possess central forehead ridges extending from the bridge of the nose, but not all. They also have sharp teeth. Most have dark hair, though some shave their heads, including eyebrows.\n\n\"They will be wearing armour, including helmets. Weak points are at armour joints and the sides of the ribcage. Do not aim straight for center of mass as they protect this area with plate metal, and phasers will not work. If you can confiscate any blades, including their curved bat'leth, do so. They may have their own phasers, but they prefer hand-to-hand combat. Leave no survivors.\"\n\nHis men saluted and separated to the two shuttlecraft they'd been assigned.\n\n\"My duty is to protect the Brinthi,\" Kirk said to Khan. \"Your men won't do anything to them, will they?\"\n\nKhan smirked. \"No, Captain. The Brinthi are safe in my men's hands, I assure you.\"\n\nHe ducked into one of the shuttles, to pilot the vessel himself. Kirk, with the contingent from the Enterprise, went for the third shuttle.\n\n----------\n\nA figure separated itself from the shadows in the shuttle bay, watching the three shuttlecraft as they went out through the airlock.\n\nSo this Khan was the man they hunted? How very interesting! It made so much sense now, why Marcus had never responded. Why the plan had failed.\n\nAnd if he had special abilities, all the better. The Klingon High Council would very interested to get their hands on him. But how? They could not take him from this vessel, so how to lure him away?\n\nThe spy mentally reviewed the conversation he'd overheard. This Khan had a wife and son, back on the planet they had just left. Family was important to him, both men had stated that several times.\n\nGrinning wickedly to himself, the spy pulled out his communicator."
