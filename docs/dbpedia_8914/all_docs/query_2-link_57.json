To Hampton, Bona Fide is a record about a ride she calls \"the human rollercoaster.”\n\n“You have falling in love, getting cheated on, celebrating this life – you only get one,” she says. “We go through so many human emotions on this album, and that’s what I want to bring to life: The ride of being a human! I want to take you to the moment you found the love of your life when you looked across the room. This album is literally meant to take you to every human emotion you have.”\n\n“I want them to see themselves in my songs and inspire them to be the best version of themselves.”\n\nJoslyn & The Sweet Compression are Bona Fide, ready to bring their love and joy to audiences everywhere.\n\nArtist Website\n\nMunit Mesfin - Fri, June 14, 8pm\n\nMunit Mesfin is an Ethio-American singer and songwriter whose musical stylings range from jazz to soul, funk to reggae.
