        "text": "Her career took off in Chicago with the group Rufus and skyrocketed via the Stevie Wonder-penned hit \"Tell Me Something Good.\" This success laid the foundation for an illustrious solo career, beginning with the empowering global anthem \"I'm Every Woman.\" Chaka's impact on pop culture extends beyond music; she has ventured into theater, made history-making collaborations, and contributed to children's television. Beyond her rich entertainment success, she has mastered the art of business with entrepreneurial ventures, including gourmet chocolates and a signature fragrance, 'Chaka by Chaka Khan.' Her life story is detailed in her autobiography \"Through the Fire,\" serving as a testament to resilience and optimism. With a heart of gold, Chaka has changed lives through philanthropic efforts focusing on mental health and education. Celebrated by her peers and adored by fans worldwide, she remains a beacon of musical excellence, passion, empowerment, and love, uplifting hearts around the world. She embodies all the qualities of a true legend\n\nSteel Pulse continues to be revolutionary in engaging controversial topics of racial injustice and human rights on a global scale. Their musical stance and conceptualizations are as potent and relevant today as they were at the beginning of their career. The album’s uniquely thematic approach provokes thought as it presses forward, toward humanities unification. A manipulation of our minds has been influenced by a New World Order currently dominating humankind. Steel Pulse reappears at a fated moment, armed with compassion, encouraging all people to reject false ideals, set higher goals, and demand more from themselves to further this unification.\n\nLead singer and guitarist, David Hinds’ creativity, human persona, and visionary views are revealed through inspiring compositions that capture the effects of the African Diaspora. These songs weave and interlock with each other, enticing all to stand together and unite.\n\nLadyRyan is a Bay Area favorite, inspiring a sense of safety, joy, and belonging as a spiritual conductor and dedicated professional. Her music and voice have been riding the wave of partygoers from coast to coast for more than a decade.\n\nHer passion for music started at an early age, singing in her church choir at 6, sampling and making beats at 20, and ultimately tapping into her true passion when she bought her first set of turntables at 23. LadyRyan’s deep range of knowledge in multiple musical genres, balanced with the right touch makes her ability to conduct high vibrations a sure shot!\n\nLadyRyan has played with and opened for artists such as George Clinton, Erykah Badu, and Anderson .Paak. In 2011, LadyRyan co-founded SOULOVELY, creating space for QTBIPOC community and she's been packing in hundreds of people at outdoor parties ever since. LadyRyan has held long-standing residencies at some of East Bay's most popular clubs. In 2016, she was named East Bay Express’s Readers Choice as \"The Best DJ Who Dabbles in Every Scene.\"\n\nOur concerts are FREE but we require tickets\n\nTickets are released 1 month prior to the show date\n\nDidn’t get tickets on the first ticket release?
