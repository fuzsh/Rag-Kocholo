        "text": "We here at SOUL have been fans of Chaka Khan and Stephanie Mills for a LONG time. Their careers both span decades and are fixtures in not only the Black music world but music a whole. The upcomming Verzuz between the two is destined be everything except a battle and nothing but pure love.\n\nStephanie Mills rose to fame playing Dorothy for five years in the CLASSIC musical The Wiz. (Diana Ross would go on to play the role in the feature film.) We look forward to hearing songs like “Home” and “I Feel Good All Over” that will surly hit nostalgia button. Staying relevant through out the years with collaborations in hip hop, rap and RnB, with 7 Tony Awards under her belt we know girl will PERFORM!\n\nChaka Khan is the undisputed Queen of Funk and it gives me chills thinking about her performance. As lead singer of renowned funk band Rufus she recorded hits like “Tell Me Something Good”, “You Got the Love”, “Sweet Thing” and so much more. She blasted off a solo career with the anthem “I’m Every Woman” written by Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson but would return to Rufus soon after and stay with the band until 1983. “I Feel You” launched her solo career. Multiple collaborations and samples of her songs through the years would sustain her mark in the music world. I could go on and on."
