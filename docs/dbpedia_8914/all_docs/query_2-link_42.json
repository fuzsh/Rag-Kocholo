        "text": "As a national monument, Genghis Khan Mausoleum records the vicissitudes of history and splendid culture of the Mongolian nation. There is also a very interesting story about the site of Genghis Khan's Mausoleum. Legend has it that Genghis Khan happened to pass through Ordos when he led his army to fight against the Western Xia Regime. When he saw the fertile soil, rich water, flourishing grass here and elegant sika deer, he was so happy that he accidentally dropped his riding whip on the ground. When one of his subordinates was about to pick up the riding whip, Genghis stopped him and murmured to himself, \"Here is the place where the sika deer lives, the home where the birds raise their young, the site where the declining dynasties rejuvenate, and the land where the aged pleases themselves.\" Then he turned to his subordinates and said, \"I can be buried here when I die.\" When the hearse carried Genghis Khan's coffin arrived in Ordos after his death, the wheels of the hearse suddenly sank into a swamp, and no amount of horses and oxen could pull it out. Then the general who escorted the hearse recalled what Genghis Khan had said, so he placed the yurt, his tunic and one of his stocking in the altar white room and formed the Babai Palace (八白宫), which is now the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan.\n\nTill today, the real location of Genghis Khan's mausoleum remains a mystery. The Mausoleum of Genghis Khan, now built in Ordos, is a cenotaph and scenic area to commemorate Genghis Khan and carry forward its fine culture.\n\nMausoleum Palace (成吉思汗陵宫) is a sacred place to worship Genghis Khan. The architecture retains the shape and characteristics of the eight White House of Genghis Khan, becoming the representative architecture of the Mongolian nation. The Mausoleum Palace of Genghis Khan consists of the main hall, the back hall, the east and west halls, and the east and west halls. The mausoleum palace has a construction area of 2000 square meters. The main hall is 24.18 meters high and the east and west halls are 18 meters high. The resplendent mausoleum palace, like an eagle flying wings, shows the grand momentum of the prairie emperor's mausoleum. The milky white walls, vermilion doors and windows, golden roofs and blue cloud pictures all have unique Mongolian characteristics. In the Mausoleum Palace, Eight White House (rooms) of Genghis Khan (八白宫) are enshrined, and there are huge murals there. Hanging in the middle of the eaves of the Mausoleum Palace is a plaque \"Mausoleum of Genghis Khan\" inscribed by former Vice President Ulan Fu.\n\nQizhuang Shanhe Memorial Gate\n\nThe memorial gate presents the shape of \"山(Shan)\", Like a huge crest splitting from the top, towering statue of Genghis Khan prancing horse soaring out of the sky in the center, the eastern and western mountains were chiseled out... The shape of the condensed and dignified Qizhuang Shanhe Memorial Gate (气壮山河门) has a profound meaning that is the ground-breaking power and epoch-making grandeur, hence the name.\n\nThe Sculptured Group of Iron Horses and Golden Hordes\n\nThe Iron Horses and Golden Hordes (铁马金帐雕塑群) is the world’s first large scenic sculpture group which completely displays the army palace of Genghis Khan. The military life of Genghis Khans reappears in your eye. Conquering from north to south, spanning the territory from Asia to Europe with mighty and powerful forces, showing visitors the historical picture scroll of Genghis Khan's great achievements. When you step into the vast sculpture group, you can feel the real scene of Genghis Khan commanding millions of troops to fight bravely and unify Mongolia.\n\nMongolian History and Culture Museum\n\nWith the shape of the Mongolian word “Han (which means the emperor)”, the Mongolia History and Culture Museum (蒙古历史文化博物馆), also known as Genghis Khan Cultural Heritage Museum, is one of the typical architecture in Inner Mongolia. It is the first museum at home and abroad to collect, study and display the history and culture of the Mongolian ethnic group. The museum has collected a large number of Mongolian historical relics and exquisite and unique national artifacts since Genghis Khan, playing an important role in inheriting and carrying forward the long-established history and culture of the Mongolian nation.\n\nThe 206 years' historical picture scroll from the birth of Genghis Khan to the withdrawal of the Mongolian rulers from the Yuan capital and the Mobei steppe and the establishment of the Northern Yuan regime in the Yuan Dynasty, truly reflects the most glorious period of historical facts of the Mongolian nation and the historical process of realizing the reunification of the Chinese nation and accelerating the development of world civilization. The Long Scroll of Mongolian History (蒙古历史长卷), which is displayed in the museum, is the longest scroll in the world.\n\nAlaten Gandal Obo\n\nAlatan Gandel Obo (阿拉腾甘德尔敖包) was set up by the ancients to commemorate Genghis Khan's shedding of his riding whip. It brings together the most ancient shamanism sacrificial culture and sacrificial ceremonies of the Mongolian nation, and leads you into a mysterious altar where you can dialogue with the immortal heaven. On the altar stands the Chagaan Suld, which symbolizes the eternal residence of the spirit of Genghis Khan, reflecting the distinctive ethnic cultural characteristics of Ordos. Every year on the 21st day of the third lunar month, the worship ceremony of Chagansuluk festival is held here.\n\nNinety-nine Steps\n\nMongol people worship heaven and believe that the heaven which dominates everything in the world is composed of ninety-nine levels. Genghis Khan once drew up the ropes of ten thousand herds of cattle and sprinkled the milk of ninety-nine female mares on the banks of the Cluren River to make sacrifice to heaven. Ninety-nine Steps (九十九级台阶) are a symbol of luck and happiness. Looking from a distance, it is like a surging river, implying that the \"eternal river\" of \"Mongolia\" created by Genghis Khan has a long history and will last forever.\n\nNadaam Equestrian Events Center\n\nBesides, the mausoleum area and on the grassland, a racecourse designed and built according to the international track standards and the traditional customs of the horse back ethnic group, staging the three arts of Nadaam (Mongolian horse race, Ordos wrestling and Hathar bowing) and other entertainment games with national characteristics.
