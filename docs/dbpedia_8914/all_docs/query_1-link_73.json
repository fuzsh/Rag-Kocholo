        "text": "The Neighborhood House Party, as it was billed, was promoted heavily to a pop crowd, yet featured some indie hip hop acts. I was unsure of what to expect the crowd to be like, but I was intrigued when I arrived at Neighborhood Theater last Thursday night to catch Mr. Invisible, Soul Khan, Shinobi Ninja and Brody & Choch. There was a very large audience, about a 50/50 mix of indie hip hop scene regulars and the College St. crowd.\n\nI arrived in the middle of Mr. Invisible, which was sadly only a Justin Aswell set. His other half, Ill-Use was sick and absent. Aswell held it down solo with his Maschine as he explained “Ill is literally ill.”\n\nThe crowd cheered loudly, but I was a tad disappointed the more mainstream audience members would not get the full Mr. Invisible experience.\n\nHowever, they are normally a hard act to follow, so perhaps this worked out well for Soul Khan, who was up next. I was already familiar with Soul Khan, thanks to his battle videos on youtube. I knew him to be a verbal beast. Unfortunately, as he spit his lyrics, it was very difficult to understand them. I don’t know if there was a problem with the sound or maybe even the way he held the mic, but every word was indiscernible. Oddly enough though, it didn’t really matter. His flow rode the beat so perfectly, everyone just danced along and vibed out.\n\nThere was some pretty cool stuff happening between the sets. As we awaited Shinobi Ninja, a scat battle broke out, complete with a $50 prize. There were also t-shirt giveaways and other improvised competitions. Activities like these really helped enhance the party vibe. Props to the person who organized this.\n\nShinobi Ninja took the stage by storm, delivering power pop-punk. A friend in the audience offered up the description “like if 311 had a baby with the Black Eyed Peas.” This is pretty on-point, only I might also throw a little Willow Smith somewhere in there, as the lead female vocalist repeatedly whipped her hair back and forth in expert fashion. At this point, the audience ratios were skewed heavily in favor of the College St. crowd and they loved this high energy set. It was a great warm up to what Brody and Choch brought next.\n\nBrody and Choch were introduced as the “Greatest hip hop duo of our city,” causing many raised eyebrows amongst the hip hop scene regulars still in the audience. Their eyebrows remained raised as Brody & Choch went through their set, using classic, iconic, hip hop beats but performing their own hooks over them. By this time, the crowd had grown by at least 100 people and they were all under the age of 24. I began to wonder if they knew these were classic songs, or if they thought these were Brody & Choch originals.\n\nI was relieved when Brody & Choch told the crowd to sing along with B.I.G.’s “Juicy” and everyone knew the words. At this point, I saw their set for what it was – not a set at all, they were just cold rock’n this party like the 2012 Kid N Play and I couldn’t be mad about it. I danced along to Apache while drunk kids crowd surfed above me. I marveled at Choch onstage in basketball shorts and argyle socks with the illest stair-step box.\n\nThey ended the party in the best way possible, by pulling half the crowd onstage to get down. I’ve never seen anything quite like it. They gave the people what they came for, which was a damn fun night. I do hope I can catch them rocking their original material sometime soon, though. I know a few candidates for greatest hip hop duo of our city and although Brody & Choch can rock a party, I am not yet convinced they are contenders for that title.\n\n[simpleviewer gallery_id=”223″]"
