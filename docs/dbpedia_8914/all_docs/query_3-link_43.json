        "text": "[Editor’s Note: Two major trends have emerged in the recent history of new media: 1) Music videos are the new music and 2) YouTube is the new MTV. With that in mind and to keep you up to speed with the greatest and latest in this online video category, Tubefilter has partnered with INDMUSIC, YouTube’s largest independent music network, to bring you at least one must-watch music video every week. Turn up your volume and we hope you enjoy the analysis, sites, and sounds.

Founding member of the much lauded and oft copied Brown Bag All-Stars, Soul Khan got his start in the rap battle scene. With a distinct voice and delivery, he is, as always, lyrically masterful in this new video shot right on the streets of Kings County.\n\nThe stripped down video for Iron Galaxy Freestyle is heavy on technique and puts you, the viewer, right up front for a couple of tight verses from a rising star in the world of New York City Hip Hop.\n\nSubscribe to get the latest creator news\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe sporadic lens flares add a distinct noir vibe to the video as Soul Khan marches down the street dropping his lines. The video mixes the feel of a 1950’s detective movie with 90’s era Hip Hop, where rappers would spit right into the camera, making their lyrics unavoidable. All that’s missing here is a sultry femme fatale.\n\nHowever, if this is your first foray into the world of Soul Khan you might be asking: “Why so serious?” Well fret not, for this emcee isn’t above the random Star Trek reference (if you caught it right at the top of the video you win nerd props from yours truly) or doing a super fun, super bad ass, super hero spoof with his buddy Akie Bermiss.\n\nArshan Sadri is the Channel Manager at Brooklyn based, INDMUSIC, YouTube’s largest music Network. He got his start booking comedy and music at the University of Maryland. On weekends he refuses to travel above 14th street, likes to run, and plays in two bands that are just ok."
