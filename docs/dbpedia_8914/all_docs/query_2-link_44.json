        "text": "Well let me directly come to the point based on my American friend Ted Gioia’s blog post where he reviews one of the most controversial music genre known as Avande-Garde. You can find a section of the blog post at the bottom of my comments.\n\nWell, it is more than a year that Imran Khan is in prison. In February, 2024, general elections in Pakistan were held and a coalition government is formed between Pakistan People’s Party and Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz. Brother of Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, who was himself 3 times Priminister of the country, is the new Prime Minister of Pakistan. The incumbent government of Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif from the very onset was faced with challenge of an Economic default where as inflation rates were soared to more than 40 percent with a sluggish economic growth that was not more than 1 percent. In 4 months, economy is moving towards stability with inflation at 10 percent and with agricultural growth rate at above 6 percent. The economic momentum needs to carry on and that means that the coalition government should complete its 5 years term. However, Pakistan is facing increased political instability because one of the most popular leader, Imran Khan is not willing to do politics in National Assembly and promoting politics of agitation as he has always done. It is different this time and it should be different this time for Khan. Firstly, Khan and PTI now has many years of experience in the government when he was Prime Minister of the country during 2018–2022. On the contrary Khan is doing the same politics as he did before having experience of national governance. Imran Khan is not willing to talk to the incumbent government. Khan says he would never talk to the political leaders of PPP and PMLN. He is more than willing to talk to military establishment that is clearly against the spirit of Democracy.\n\nIf we assume that Imran Khan gets another term as Pakistan’s Prime Minister some time in distant future, how would he manage his oppsoition that would still be PMLN and PPP and their leadership? Maybe he doesnt want his oppsotion to be around. He wants to exile them or worse. I dont know but what I know is that Imran Khan became unpopular among the decision makers of the country and outside because he has shown intentions of one party rule in Pakistan where Imran Khan can rule the country for decades. Well one party rule of Haseena Wajid in Bangladesh met a horrible fate just few days ago.\n\nImran Khan and PTI has no economic plans to meet the challenges default prone economy of the country faces and Khan and PTI are only promoting politics of agitation for the sake of agitation when Pakistan needs political and economic stability the most.\n\nThereby, let me make another effort to convince Imran Khan. And the logic I want to promote his from the music review of my American friend Ted Gioia. Neither Imran Khan is worse, nor his opposition namely Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif, Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari. The worse is the absence of all or the absence of any one of them. They are all great political leaders of the country.\n\nBeing a Pakistani where a national level politician that Imran Khan is has been calling for revolution and being an Economist, I loved this parable from Ted Gioia: ‘Life after the revolution starts to resemble the same tyranny we just toppled.’ So true if revolution leads to another autocracy like in case of Russia and Cuba. In case of France, revolution has led to democracy. Its really good to understand a bit about that after reading Ted Gioia. And being an advocate of peace in the world, I loved it when he writes worse than Avant-Garde is that there is no Avant-Garde. Indeed, when some segments of the population hate so much the others because of their color, religion and ethnicity should instead know your golden rule in music. Absence of multicultural nature of global population and that is so true for multi-ethnic societies of Europe and the U.S. is worse than having these beautiful people around. Similarly competing political leadership would win their countries a great deal of economic prosperity and social cohesion if they send the same message for their opposition. The only thing worse than Donald Trump is absence of him. The variety in persons, leaders, theories and music would always be a source of progress. Without counterfactual one may never be able to measure and plan the real progress. That is so true for a world influenced by technology. What shape future technology takes would all depend on your golden rule. Cheers my friend for such a power article on music telling more than what it contains and in most beautiful words.\n\nNine Observations on the Avant-Garde\n\nHas it disappeared? Does anybody care? Should they?\n\nTed Gioia (Honest Broker — Substack Blog)\n\nAug 07, 2024\n\nSome time back, I was invited to attend a concert by an up-and-coming avant-garde band. These musicians were hellbent on disruption and mayhem, proving their transgressive credentials at every turn.\n\nMy companion that evening was a well-known jazz musician and, at the end of the concert, he turned to me and said:\n\n“The future was then.”\n\nThe Honest Broker is a reader-supported guide to music, books, media & culture. Both free and paid subscriptions are available. If you want to support my work, the best way is by taking out a paid subscription.\n\ndawoodmamoon96@gmail.com\n\nSubscribe\n\nI laughed, because this was so true. The performance we had just experienced wanted to be cutting-edge and futuristic, but every note played reflected a notion of the avant-garde as it existed sixty years ago.\n\nThe future was then.\n\nI thought of that concert recently when a magazine convened a group of artists and intellectuals and asked them a troubling question:\n\nWhat happened to the avant-garde?\n\nFew people paid attention to their hand-wringing. I didn’t even hear about this online colloquium until months had passed — and I try to stay on top of precisely these kinds of issues. Nobody I know mentioned it, and I stumbled upon it purely by chance.\n\nBut that only proves that there really is a crisis in the avant-garde. It’s a crisis of neglect. Of disinterest.\n\nPeople once got worked up about cutting edge art and transgressive culture. They loved it or hated it, but they always had strong feelings. Nowadays they hardly notice.\n\nPerhaps they are just deadened to it from over-exposure.\n\nYou can put up the strangest statue in the town square nowadays — let’s say Albert Einstein getting swallowed by a monster snail — and people just walk by it. They’ve seen it all before.\n\nYou have too.\n\nArtists can make the most bizarre music, destroying instruments, shouting obscenities, and creating all sorts of noise. But — yawn! — somebody’s great-grandpa was doing all that three generations ago.\n\nPhoto from Luigi Russolo’s The Art of Noises (1913)\n\nIn a previous career, I often visited factories.\n\nI’ve been on the factory floor in at least 20 different countries, and even trained as an assembly line worker just to learn what it was like.\n\nAnd here’s one thing I found out: People and food and customs are different all over the world, but factory noise is always the same.\n\nNoise may be the universal language. But it doesn’t express much.\n\nAnd that’s the curse of so many avant-garde musical projects — for example, the “future was then” band described above. The intensity is high, but the emotional range is narrow — very narrow.\n\nBut does it have to be that way? I don’t think so (as I’ll explain below).\n\nAvant-garde music can do — and should do — so many things that it rarely even attempts. But like every other genre, it gets caught up in its own past.\n\nAnd what did the colloquium participants, invited to address the “crisis of the avant-garde,” have to say about all this?\n\nLucy Sante diagnosed the crisis in terms of time and money:\n\nAn avant-garde needs a scene, and the cities are too expensive for scenes now. An avant-garde needs an excess of time, and that’s in short supply nearly everywhere.\n\nJamie Hood supported this idea that the rent s too damn high — at least for experimental artists in New York.\n\nNearly all the broke artists I loved or fucked or partied and collaborated with a decade ago have been priced out of New York, or they’ve been black-holed into waged labor that leaves little to no room for vibrant social or intimate lives, let alone for the making of art.\n\nDean Kissick instead blames the reactionary nature of the establishment:\n\nMuch of the art world is actively and outspokenly opposed to the idea of aesthetic progress or provocation, and has turned backwards.\n\nThere’s some truth to the last comment. I know a lot of people (including many readers here) who view the current crisis of the avant-garde as encouraging news. I can almost hear you muttering: About time those bastards got their comeuppance.\n\nI’m not quite so jaded, but I understand where these naysayers coming from. I’ve sat through some painful avant-garde performances in my day.\n\nBut my feeling about the avant-garde is more like Churchill’s quip about democracy. Democracy is the worst system, he admitted, except for all the others. My version would be: The only thing worse than the avant-garde is a world without the avant-garde."
