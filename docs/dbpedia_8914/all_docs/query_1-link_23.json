[Verse 1] now bear witness to the metamorphosis that be getting your missus as wet as a swordfish is nah, forget about it, I already lost interest the truth is the truth and a metaphor isn't you're ready to four-fifth it but you already forfeited what would Cosby be like if he never lost Ennis? you don't really want it if we set it off in this so, just shut the fuck up and just let the god finish i'm climbing up the pedestal, no matter what they said to you and now you're wondering why they put a tiger in the petting zoo so tell all the promoters that are dyin' for some revenue your homie got it covered like Tobias like a never-nude but I ain't David Cross, I'm the kind of giant that crossed David and rock harder than what David tossed at him, I split that like Kit-Kats, and swim through pirhannas and shake 'em off [Hook] when time keeps slippin', and your mind's no different, stand up lil homie, you're part of the Khangregation whether Shalom aleikhem or A'Salaam Alaikum stand up lil homie, you're part of a Khangregation [Verse 2] so motherfuck who a problem, i'mma sun, moon and star 'em for the junk you've been talking, I'mm crush you to carbon decorated with the ladies 'cause I come chew the carpet a gentleman excelling in the \"fuck you\" department what the fuck you done started from that one room apartment? now this shit is too heavy for just one spool of Charmin words are a weapon, so I cut through the jargon if you reap what you sow, then I uproot the garden in other no novelty, I only rap well, and sing a little too, but I ain't no Maxwell a native of the land of the Manuels overworked and underpaid like I made what the Gap sells so stop talking down to those trying to break even or get thrown from the ring like Bobby the Brain Heenan money comes and goes but poverty ain't leavin' so if this is my job, there's gotta be great reason [Hook] [Outro] and thus concludes Chapter 1. Soul Khan, DJ Element welcome back to where you have always belonged\n\n3.\n\nAmerican Made f Sene 02:15\n\n4.\n\n1: oh, you ain't loving them hoes it's obvious, though 'cause if you did, you wouldn't be calling them hoes i've had it up to my sack with those who hijack the image of a modern man who always got his wife's back i was made by my mother and raised by my mother so, if i love a woman then i say that i love her i mean, the audacity to say that we're tougher when a child comes out of them and they still recover when a man's afraid, i don't say he's a pussy it's 2011 and you ain't eating pussy? c'mon it's fun as fuck, just to see her coming, plus let her finish first, i don't mind being the runner-up after it's over, i'm grabbing her closer you're baffled, perhaps understand when you're older i act right, meaning never act like i own her 'cause that's what i'm supposed to do hook: oh god, it's such an honor just to be with you i even picked a real fucking raw beat for you if i made a club banger, it would make me stacks but i know you got a brain to match, not brain like that 2: i felt heartbreak that would make you cut up your wrists and learned the hard way, just 'bout any love is a risk see, it'll go hand-in-hand like a knuckle and fist but ain't a problem in the world that a punch gonna fix shit, women cheat and make us jealous a bit but that's like hearing the pot calling the kettle a dick it's childish, like some of y'all ain't never been kissed without it being just another step to legs getting split i was told i'm the center of her universe a level that a few reserve, but never sweated losing her you would think i'm lucifer, nah i wasn't grown enough wasn't even soul enough, back then i was noah with a shoulder shrug that flooded tear ducts in a worn-out eye i'd be like \"cheer up, shorty, 'cause it's warm outside\" couldn't fathom the agony 'til i brought out mine now what i've got's better than whatever more i'll find hook 2x\n\n5.\n\nAbout Something 02:10\n\n6.\n\nWellstone f Akie Bermiss 02:58"
