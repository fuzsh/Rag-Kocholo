        "text": "From the San Fernando Valley, but long ensconced in the New York rap scene, Soul Khan has become a critical favorite by making sincere music. In an industry obsessed with short‐lived trends, he has grown on his own terms, amassing a devoted following in the process. Soul Khan's perspective and style are as multidimensional as his listeners. He fluidly navigates subjects without coming off heavy‐handed, rare for a rapper who addresses social issues. His compelling voice provides a nearly unrivaled depth and grit to convey his message. This has led to work with artists like Lupe Fiasco, the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, and Homeboy Sandman. With six acclaimed EPs and an album many call an underground classic, Soul Khan has received coverage from MTV, BET, Red Bull, Complex, 2DopeBoyz, The Needle Drop, among countless other outlets. He has performed throughout much of the US, as well as in Canada and England, though he intends to reach his fans in all continents. On the festival circuit, he has rocked stagesmat Bonnaroo, SXSW, Warped Tour, CMJ, NXNE, Pop Montreal, A3C, and Fun Fun Fun Festival. His latest single, “Shine” is available digitally via Tommy Boy Entertainment but you can hear and watch all of his work at soulkhan.com.
