These 60 second audiograms are thoughts that I've had while doing my MBA at Cranfield, and bringing them back to the charity sector context. Check out more info about the book and what it talks about here - https://lnkd.in/eeFHnjND NB - In the short 60 seconds I have for these audiograms, I didn't say anything positive about the founders who have created so many wonderful charities - please forgive the absence, I had a lot to say and no time to say it! #foundersmentality #founderssyndrome\n\nIn a 2006 study performed by the National Institutes of Health found that when people gave to charities, regions of the brain associated with pleasure, social connection, and trust were activated as endorphins are released creating a “warm glow” effect, referred to as the “helper’s high.” If you’re looking to support a business or nonprofit who are making a difference, look no further! We have several campaigns looking for people who want to give, and contributing will give you that “warm glow” effect. #Giving #Donate #Communities https://lnkd.in/gVZKM_FM\n\nAs there are only a few weeks left before my #LondonMarathon challenge it felt like a good time to reflect and share what I have learned along the way. Disclaimer: These are purely my own electrolyte fuelled ramblings and are not based on any level of expertise........ 1. Your fingers bleed a lot when you cut them on a training run (don’t ask me how I did that). Don’t stand on the side of the road covered in blood. People get freaked out. 2. Be prepared for another layer of fatigue. Sleep – lots of it. 3. Don't be shy. Tell people you’re running a marathon (usually complete strangers). Be proud of yourself – it’s an incredible feat of dedication and effort. 4. Be consistent with your training runs – most of them should be done in low heart rate zones. 5. #Londonmarathon is the biggest annual fundraising event in the world, raising over £1 billion since 1981 for good causes. The donations I’ve received have made me feel like I’m part of something bigger and helped me through the “why I am doing this moments?” There are lots of those! If you can spare some cash to get me through these last few weeks, the link is below and Thank You! https://lnkd.in/ep2jYVkp\n\nIt is very common when you learn the truth about Tr@//ick1ng to feel overwhelmed. Overwhelm can lead to shutting down or freezing. When it feels like too much we often can't move forward to take action. What if, however, you could move forward by supporting an organization that is taking actions that are making a difference? What if you could donate your time? What if it was that simple?! It is. And you can. The choice is yours. #humantraffickingawareness #makeadifference #takeaction #donate\n\nThe most important principle in fundraising, I think, is to work out what the story is and then tell it to donors and supporters; this excellent advice from Dan at the aptly named Better Story describes an application of that principle; what is the donor's story? How do they engage with your organization and the people in it? Where are the points of shared energy and vision? The better you know their story, the better the story you can tell them."
