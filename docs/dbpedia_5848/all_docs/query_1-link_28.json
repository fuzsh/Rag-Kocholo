        "text": "44%\n\nOutlaw Posse (2024) This lightly radical framing helps cover some of the film's formal sins, casting its low-budget aesthetic as more charming than not and keeping the proceedings solidly entertaining for undemanding viewers interested in the Western genre. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 02, 2024\n\n94%\n\nThe Monk and the Gun (2023) While the film is certainly humorous throughout...the satire is never biting enough to actually make any decisive statement on the notions of democracy, capitalism, and whether the people of Bhutan actually need either. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 05, 2024\n\n85%\n\nShe Is Conann (2023) While She is Conann is unabashedly and appealingly a gender-flipped, queer version of the traditionally hyper-masculine tale, it isn't only that: it's a complete contortion of what a fantasy film can be. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 31, 2024\n\n--\n\nAbbé Pierre – A Century of Devotion (2023) Tellier fumbles this poorly paced, repetitive film by indulging narrative loops that quickly wear you down and result in more of a boring slog than a captivating portrait of Pierre’s political and spiritual struggles. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 05, 2023\n\n92%\n\nThe Fishbowl (2023) In general, the film lacks the stillness necessary to land with impact, surprising given the narrative; it only runs 90 minutes, but still feels frustratingly lacking in intent. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 27, 2023\n\n84%\n\nLet It Be Morning (2021) The film’s fundamental flaw... is that the comedy isn’t particularly effective and doesn’t have enough bite to feel genuinely insightful or provocative. - In Review Online\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 10, 2023"
