        "text": "Celebritydecks\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n4 min read\n\n·\n\nFeb 22, 2024\n\n--\n\nThe English actress Nico Parker first became well-known for her role in the 2019 Tim Burton film “Dumbo” and for playing Sarah Miller in the 2023 film “The Last of Us.” She is the well-known child of film director Oliver Parker and actress Thandiwe Newton.\n\nIn this Article, we’re going to discuss about Nico Parker Movies and TV Shows, her personal and professional life, age, height and Net Worth.\n\nNico Parker Early Life\n\nOn December 9, 2004 (As of now Feb- 2024, she is 19 years old), Nico Parker was born in London, England’s Kensal Rise.\n\nHer parents have achieved success in the film industry, with her mother being the renowned actress Thandiwe Newton, and her father, Oliver Parker, a well-known film director and screenwriter.\n\nShe shares her upbringing with her younger brother, Booker Parker, and her older sister, Ripley Parker.\n\nFamily Ties\n\nNico’s family connections extend to her uncle, Jamie Newton, known for his work as an EPK cameraman in films like Blitz (2011) and One Day (2011).\n\nHer grandfather is Nick Newton, adding to the family’s rich background in the film industry.\n\nEarly Exposure to Film Sets\n\nAt the age of around 9 or 10, Nico Parker visited her mother, Thandiwe Newton, on the set of the sci-fi western Westworld.\n\nDuring this visit, she encountered a prosthetic of her mother’s corpse, which she initially found amusing.\n\nRecounting the experience at 19, Nico shared that, while discussing it with a friend, she initially found it funny.\n\nHer friend, however, pointed out the dark aspect, questioning if such an encounter could be disturbing for a child.\n\nNico acknowledged the potential scarring effect and humorously mentioned considering bringing it up in therapy someday.\n\nGrowing Up on Sets\n\nNico Parker, being the daughter of director Ol Parker (known for films like Mamma Mia 2), practically grew up on film sets.\n\nReflecting on her upbringing, she expressed gratitude for the early exposure but noted that, at a young age, it felt like a normal part of her parents job rather than something flashy or exciting.\n\nCareer\n\nIn “Dumbo,” she portrayed the older daughter of circus performers Holt and Meena Farrier, contributing to the emotional depth of the story.\n\nFollowing her impressive debut, Nico joined the HBO miniseries “The Third Day” in 2020, starring alongside acclaimed actors Naomie Harris and Jude Law.\n\nShe played Ellie, a young lady on a quest to find her missing brother on a remote island, earning her an official nomination for the Best Actress category at the British Independent Film Awards.\n\nNico’s career reached new heights when she co-starred with her mother, Thandiwe Newton, in the science fiction film “Reminiscence” (2021), directed by Lisa Joy.\n\nIn this surreal thriller, Nico portrayed Zoe, a young woman utilizing Hugh Jackman’s character as a memory hunter to locate her missing spouse.\n\nRecent Career Highlights\n\nNico Parker’s fame soared to new heights when she made a cameo appearance as Sarah Miller in the opening episode of the HBO series “The Last of Us” in 2023.\n\nThis show, based on the popular computer game of the same name, features prominent roles played by Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey.\n\nNico’s participation in “The Last of Us” contributed to her being designated as Tatler’s “Bright Young Thing” in 2023.\n\nFriendship with Pedro Pascal\n\nNico Parker treasures her friendship with Pedro Pascal, emphasizing its value during the filming of “The Last of Us.”\n\nShe expressed a deep need for someone like Pascal in her life during that period, appreciating his presence immensely.\n\nNico’s latest achievement includes being selected to play the character Astrid in the remake of “How to Train Your Dragon.”\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCurrently single, Nico Parker prioritizes her professional growth and aims to excel in her career rather than focusing on personal relationships.\n\nHer dedication to acting and career development is reflected in her strong work ethic.\n\nNet Worth\n\nNico Parker has amassed a commendable fortune at a young age, with an estimated net worth ranging between $75,000 and $1,00,000 as of 2024.\n\nHeight and Weight\n\nNico stands at a height of 5 feet 2 inch.\n\nShe maintains a weight of 51 kilograms.\n\nAward Nominations\n\nNico Parker recently secured the Sundance Film Festival’s Breakthrough Performance Award for her outstanding role in Suncoast, Laura Chinn’s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age dramedy.\n\nAdditionally, she received a 2023 Online Film & Television Association (OFTA) nomination for “The Last of Us” as the Best Guest Actress in a Drama Series.\n\nHer exceptional guest performance in “The Last of Us” also earned her nominations at the 2023 Black Reel Awards for Television and the International Online Cinema Awards (INOCA).\n\nIf you want to know more about
