        "text": "Top picks | Live music picks | More weekend arts and culture\n\nTop picks\n\n'Guac'\n\nTheater | Manuel Oliver's son, \"Guac,\" or Joaquin Oliver, was killed during the Parkland shooting in 2018, along with 16 of his classmates, the deadliest high school shooting in United States history.\n\nIn the years since, the Oliver family have tried — and continued to try — whatever form of activism they can to prevent more gun violence in the United States. But something about the theater lit a spark for Manuel Oliver. He realized he could capture the attention of hundreds of people at a time in a theater, even if they were not seeking out a story about gun violence — just by sharing a connection.\n\n\"This is my real life. This is my story, and Joaquin's story. It's just putting together events that are very happy moments. I always like people to remember Joaquin for his 17 years and not for his last two minutes. So that's what the play is about. It's about those wonderful 17 years. Of course we talk about those terrible two minutes, but at the end of the show you will feel empowered,\" Oliver said. \"It's an empowering play.\"\n\nTo hear more from Oliver, check out my feature here.\n\n\"Guac\" will be performed twice in San Diego. The Saturday show is already sold out, but tickets for Friday night's performance at UC San Diego are still available.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 2. Mandeville Auditorium, 9500 Gilman Dr., UC San Diego. $0-$23.18.\n\nCamila Meza Trio\n\nMusic, Jazz, Latin | NPR has called composer and performer Camila Meza \"one of the best-kept secrets in New York City,\" and (lucky us) she's coming to town with her jazz trio. Meza's music is bright, rich and powerful and her performances are engaging and expressive.\n\nThis concert wraps up the Athenaeum's summer jazz series, and one major bonus to their concerts is that you can peruse the Athenaeum's visual art exhibition before and after the show.\n\nCurrently on view is their \"32nd Annual Juried Exhibition,\" so don't forget to take a peek.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Sunday, Aug. 4. Athenaeum Music & Arts Library, 1008 Wall St., La Jolla. $40-$45.\n\nSmall Press Nite: Juliet Escoria, Lily Hoang, Ana Carrete and Michael Deagler\n\nBooks, Literature, Poetry | This excellent small press reading series returns to The Book Catapult in South Park with erstwhile San Diegan Juliet Escoria returning to tour with her brand new short story collection, \"You Are The Snake.\"\n\nEscoria's writing is raw and beautiful, with equal vulnerability, strangeness and edge. I love the way she frames girlhood, vice, addiction, friendship and horror in her stories.\n\nLily Hoang, Ana Carrete and Michael Deagler round out the event. Hoang's latest collection is \"The Mute Kids\"; Carrete's latest poetry collection is \"Blush and Blink\"; and Deagler's novel is \"Early Sobrieties.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 3. The Book Catapult, 3010 Juniper St., South Park.

The Hill Street Country Club, 530 S. Coast Hwy, Oceanside. $15.\n\n'Peter Pan'\n\nTheater, Music | Acrobatics, musical theater and a classic story combine in the touring Broadway production of \"Peter Pan,\" newly adapted by Larissa FastHorse.
