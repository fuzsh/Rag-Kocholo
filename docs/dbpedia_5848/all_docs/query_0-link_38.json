        "text": "Alan Parker, who was nominated for the best-director Oscar for the 1978 film “Midnight Express” and again 10 years later for “Mississippi Burning,” died on Friday in South London. He was 76.\n\nHis death followed a long, unspecified illness, a spokeswoman for the British Film Institute said.\n\nMr. Parker directed a number of other well-regarded films, working in a range of styles and genres. “Fame” (1980) was a musical about a performing arts high school in New York. “Birdy” (1984) was based on a William Wharton novel about a boy who had an erotic fascination with avian life. “Angel Heart” (1987) was a sexy noir that flirted with an X rating but ended up with an R. “Angela’s Ashes” (1999) was based on Frank McCourt’s popular autobiography.\n\nMusic underpinned some of Mr. Parker’s best-known work. His first feature film was the gangster satire “Bugsy Malone” in 1976, in which adolescents played the gangsters and Paul Williams songs punctuated the action. Two years after “Fame,” he directed “Pink Floyd: The Wall,” an imagery-filled story about a British rock star that was written by Roger Waters of the band Pink Floyd and based on the band’s album of the same name. In 1991 came “The Commitments,” a lighthearted tale about a band in Dublin. In 1996 he directed the film version of the stage musical “Evita,” with Madonna in the role of Eva Perón.\n\nMadonna, he told The Mirror in 1996, wasn’t the easiest person to work with, but he found a way to get the best out of her."
