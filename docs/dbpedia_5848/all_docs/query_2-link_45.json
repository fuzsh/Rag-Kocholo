        "text": "The time period in this movie was the complete opposite than the book. In the book there were no cars, no guns, no lights. I believe the book took place in 1303, but the movie was in the early 90’s. Their swords were replaced with guns, their horses with cars. I would of felt a totally different vibe from the movie, it's newer and the dialect was still old, that didn't fit right.\n\nThere are also some differences, and some similarities between the play and the movie with some of the events. One similarity is when Gata-Man/Caliban tries to get an indulgence out of Miranda when she is young. There are many dissimilarities between the play and the movie, many of these are caused by the absence of many characters. Even the absence of the malignant characters Stephano and Trinculo are missing, removing the scene of Stephano finding Caliban and Trinculo, and multiple other scenes.\n\nAll the actors and actresses are suitable to the characters and fit the descriptions in the play in both the Fishburne and BBC versions. However, in comparison, the actors for Othello and Iago are better in the version we have watched in class. Not only the appearance of Laurence Fishburne, as Othello, is similar to the original play, the stateliness of him also effectively represents the powerful and honorable Vinece General. In the BBC version, on the other hand, the Othello by Anthony Hopkins seems not as dignified and confident as the Othello in the Fishburne version, because the character irritably argues with others a lot, especially about the political issues at the beginning, which is not as steady as a General should be. Simply, The Iago by Kenneth Branagh in the Fishburne version perfectly fits the description in the play as he looks more loyalty and honest than the other Iago by Bob Hoskins to the audience.\n\nOne other feature contrasting in the movie to the play are certain themes that surround religion. The biggest factor that altered the religious ardor seen within the play is the change of setting. Instead of using religion to play a major role to develop the film, Almereyda incorporated more modern traits in the film, such as technology and color. There is not much of the religious influence as was seen in the play. Religion played a major role in the development of the play and seeing that it is completely left out of the movie is significant. The essential complexity of this play was formed on the relationship of Christian beliefs of morality competing with the classic principles of revenge tragedy. The inner turmoil that Hamlet was experiencing as the play progressed was based on this deep religious attitude. Hamlet’s religious doctrine influenced the play on several occasions. The most obvious event was when Hamlet gave up his chance to kill Claudius once and for all while he was praying. The opportunity to end the entire journey for revenge could have been avenged earlier on in the play if Hamlet had just killed Claudius while he was praying. However, Hamlet chose not to for many reasons. One being that he had thought that Claudius was repenting for all of his sins and if Hamlet had killed him in that moment then Claudius would have gone to heaven. The mere thought of Claudius going to heaven while his father’s soul was still in purgatory halted him (III.iii.73-88).\n\n1.) Shakespeare is considered the most important playwright ever because, according to the film Shakespeare on the Silver Screen, “he seems to deal with and discuss and dramatize most of the things that matter to most human beings.” What this means is that he was able to write about issues that individuals wanted to see and what mattered to them. He had a gift of observing people without judging them; he observed them for who they really were. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare was able to discuss tragic love, something that most humans could relate to and love is something that mattered to a number of them as well. He was able to connect to individuals and connect to the emotions they were feeling.\n\nOne of the most famous Shakespearean plays today, which wasn’t popular back in the Elizabethan era because of the violence shown in the murder of the king, is Macbeth. This is a play about the struggle for power, through mostly violent means. The two film versions that we watched as a class were two very different depictions of the play. Rupert Goold’s film from 2010 (to be referred to as Film A), even though it is the same play, was in my opinion less enjoyable than Geoffrey Wright’s film (to be referred to as Film B), which was an older film, made in 2015. There were many things that were different about these two films, and these differences can change a person’s general view towards this play. Of the many differences, the most prominent ones that affect our liking towards the play include the setting of the scenes and the depiction of characters.\n\nWithout this, the play makes Othello look nothing more than someone psychologically unstable, seeking vengeance after he hears word that his wife has been unfaithful, from a practically nobody, lingering around the castle day in day out, failing to get in with Othello’s wife Desdemona but somehow managing to destroy Othello psychologically and his position (and a few others) as General. The inconsistencies in the costuming make it seem like World War II for one moment where we first meet Othello in his army general uniform (Ray Chong Nee), and then 2015 when Desdemona (Elizabeth Nadden) steps out in coral culottes bought from the nearest David\n\nWilliam Shakespeare has been marred by controversy of whether or not he actually wrote his plays and poems. William was born on April 23, 1564, in Stratford Upon Avon, United Kingdom. Although he is a famous author and playwright, his early history is actually a cloudy mystery. William Shakespeare didn’t write his plays and poems because his entire family had a lack of education, there isn’t any other documents, such as letters or journals, and he never left Avon or London and all of his plays were staged in Italy.\n\nMy subject in this essay in playtexts and in films of those playtexts. Drama offers the storyteller a simple choice about how to communicate each element of the story to the audience: show it, or have a character describe it. Often in drama narration is used because an event cannot be shown, but occasionally telling is used when showing is perfectly possible and Shakespeare uses this device self-consciously to draw attention to the medium rather than the message of his story. Shakespeare appears then interested in ekphrasis, which the Oxford Classical Dictionary calls \"an extended and detailed literary description of any object, real or imaginary\" (Hornblower & Spawforth 1996)\n\nDuring and environmental theater, the theme of the play would be pretty clear for the actors since they would inspire themselves with known plays but what would be unexplained are the contact between performers and the texts, and the interaction among the performers and the effect given to the audience on the production. Since this kind of theater theme has a unlimited and free movement style, The script line would be based on the talking but mostly on the movements of the\n\nI found Othello, the 1995 film, to be a close adaptation of the written play read in class, but in the part of Othello there are notable variances between the film and the written play that may be accounted for by the actor's interpretation of Othello. Through his persona, Lawrence Fishburn portrayed Othello as commanding more clout in the film than he did in the written play, and Fishburn portrayed Othello as having less emotional intimacy with Desdemona in the film than he did in the written play."
