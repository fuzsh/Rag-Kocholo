        "text": "This review will considers the similarities and differences between two versions of 1604 Othello by William Shakespeare; the play itself and the 1995 film version directed by Oliver Parker, a talented English film director.\n\nAccording to Geoffrey Wagner’s three categorization of adaptation, Parker’s version of film adaptation have been categorized under the commentary adaptation. Despite of the well adaptation from the original text, yet it is undoubtable to deny the fact that Parker’s adaptation has cut much of the original text without skip or change any acts. Nevertheless, from my point of view, still, this is the most straightforward adaptation, where Parker still preserving the element of plot, the characters, the themes, the setting of the play and even the usage of language. However, Parker still altering the play by rejuvenating the character using the element of fantasy sequences and soliloquy throughout the film. These can be seen in two characters; Othello and Iago. For example, Parker includes the use of dream cinematically as an effective tools to convey the depth of emotion and conflict experienced by both Othello and Iago rather than monologue as in the play. Meanwhile, Iago's direct, threatening soliloquies and fierce facial appearance with the audience via the camera conveys his deceitful intentions to destroy Othello meaningfully.\n\nSecondly, Parker also creatively add-on another scenes which are significant to the movie which I believes will enhance audience’s understanding about the play especially in the beginning of the film, by showing the arrival of Othello. As near as Othello approaching the bay, Parker inserts the element of surprising by the act of Othello’s sudden wearing a mask. This scene will definitely foreshadowing the audience something about Othello and rising a big question about him such as, ‘Who is that person’? and ‘Where he want to go?’. In addition, there are also additional scenes such as in Act 2 Scene 1 - Desdemona perform a dance for Othello in the hall, as the celebration of the victory of the war between Cyprus over the Turks and in Act 5 Scene 1 - Roderigo and Cassio received a treatment for their wounds. Parker also make a difference in the resolution of the film (Act 5 Scene 2) by showing the scene of a boat carrying the dead bodies of (Othello and Desdemona) and drop it into the sea. This scene will shows how strong and passionate their love and even they are dead, yet their soul shall live together forever.\n\nHowever, the most significant changes are in Act 3 Scene 3, where Parker add another scenes - Othello’s nightmare of Desdemona’s adultery with Cassio and the handkerchief progress. Both of these scenes play an important roles in Parker’s adaptation. Othello’s dreams are helpful in portray and shaping the concrete form of Othello's worst fears and the obsession that Desdemona doesn't really love him and has taken Cassio as her lover. This scene become the extra dimension to the film in help Iago’s character as the master of manipulator. Additionally, in this act, there is also a different scenes, how Iago catch the handkerchief from Emilia, how Cassio received the handkerchief and how Othello witnesses the scene of Bianca gives the handkerchief to Cassio. These differences in how the handkerchief is used illustrate the progression of Iago's plan and his passionate in projecting and ensure the successfulness of his plan. Meanwhile, in Act 2 Scene 3 – overt sex scene between Othello and Desdemona, which I believes this is one way of modernizing the version of Parker’s Othello to the audience.\n\nFinally, I did notice the differences of Othello’s language and tone at the beginning, where he is a calm person and confident noble man. Through act 3 and 4, as Iago successfully manipulates him into believing Desdemona’s unfaithfulness, his language become more barbaric and rude. This changes will not simply noticed if I am reading the play without watching the film. I am encouraging others to read and watch Parker’s adaptation because this film definitely help a lot in widening audience’s point of view and give depth understanding due to the difficulties of the language and in the same time acknowledge Shakespeare’s work."
