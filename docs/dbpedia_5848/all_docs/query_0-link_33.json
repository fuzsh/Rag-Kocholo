You can read more about it here:\n\nhttps://www.screendaily.com/.../protagoni.../5192612.article\n\nFilm4, British Film Institute, Protagonist Pictures, Suitable Pictures, Wellington Films, Griffin Pictures, Film i Väst\n\nThe History of Sound is an upcoming historical romantic drama directed by Oliver Hermanus. It is based on the short story of the same name by Ben Shattuck about two men who fall in love while traveling together to record the stories and songs of their countrymen during WWI.\n\nThe film has wrapped shooting and as co-producers we are excited to continue the work into the post-production phase!\n\nBased on the novel Grief is the Thing With Feathers, The Thing with Feathers follows Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game, Star Trek Into Darkness) who will play a young father whose hold on reality crumbles following his wife’s death as a strange presence begins to stalk him from the shadowy recesses of the apartment that he shares with his two young sons.\n\nThe film has wrapped shooting and as co-producers we are excited to continue the work into the post-production phase!\n\nThe powerful drama \"Exodus\", produced by B-Reel and directed by Abbe Hassan, tells the story of a professional smuggler that tries to save a 12-year-old girl whose family has gone missing in the Syrian war.\n\nToday, the film received 2 nominations for the upcoming Guldbaggen awards: Best Screenplay (Abbe Hassan, Kristoffer Cras) and Best Original Music (Lisa Montan).\n\nTogether with the Filmgate VFX-crew that created the visual effects for the film, Filmgate Films wish to extend its biggest congratulations to the team and best of luck at the ceremony!\n\nThe feature film \"Living\", directed by Oliver Hermanus and co-produced by Film i Väst together with Filmgate Films - with Filmgate VFX carrying out all VFX for the film - has recieved three BAFTA nominations and two Oscar nominations!\n\nA special congratulations to Bill Nighy for his two nominations as a leading actor!\n\nDon't forget to watch the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday February 19th and The 95th annual Academy Awards on March 13th.\n\nThe nominations for both BAFTA and the Academy Awards are listed below.\n\nDouble Oscar winners Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson have the leading roles in Oliver Parker’s latest project - the warm time drama “The Great Escaper”, which has now started filming.

The Swedish co-producers are Film i Väst and Sean Wheelan of Filmgate Films.\n\nIn the summer of 2014 Bernard Jordan (Michael Caine) made global headlines. He’d staged a “great escape” from his care home to join fellow war veterans on a beach in Normandy, commemorating their fallen comrades.\n\nIt was a story that captured the imagination of the world - Bernie seemed to embody the defiant, “can-do” spirit of a generation that was fast disappearing. But of course, it wasn’t the whole story. It was the story we all tell ourselves to make war and old age bearable. The bitter-sweet script explores the reality with wit and a very big heart.\n\nFilmgate Films and Filmgate VFX are happy to have been involved with director Charlotte Colbert’s feature length debut - “She Will”.\n\nThe film centers around an aging film star who retreats to the Scottish countryside with her nurse to recover from surgery.
