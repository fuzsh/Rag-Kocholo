        "text": "Oliver Parker, 58, is a film director best known for An Ideal Husband, The Importance of Being Earnest and Dorian Gray. He also directed the St Trinian’s reboots, the 2016 film adaptation of Dad’s Army and the newly released Swimming With Men.\n\nHe comes from an illustrious family: he is the brother of actor Nathaniel Parker and public relations expert Sir Alan Parker. His father was Sir Peter Parker, chairman of British Rail; his mother Gillian, Lady Parker, was a gardening writer and GP.\n\nParker has two children and a stepson and lives in Queen’s Park, London, with his partner Cassia Kidron.\n\nHow did your childhood influence your attitude to money?\n\nMy dad and mum came through the war years, when you learnt a certain amount of frugality. There was an ingrained respect for money.\n\nWhat was your first job or wage?\n\nMy first job was on a milk float with my brother Nat, helping the milkman on his round. We were paid in tepid orange juice.\n\nMy first wage was £88 per week, when I was 17, working in a cement factory in Kent. I stood under a perpetual shower of grey dust as the rickety conveyor belt rattled past over our heads. As it turns out, this was excellent preparation for the independent film business.\n\nHas there been any period when money was tight?\n\nI was an actor for the first few years and, unless you are very successful, you learn to live on slender takings. But I had no responsibilities.\n\nWhen did you realise it was all going to work out?\n\nWhen An Ideal Husband happened, around 1998, I thought: “I am really enjoying this.” It all seemed to be right. I realised that I would get a chance to make another film.\n\nWhat has been the most lucrative part of your career so far?\n\nThere was a period between 2005 and 2010 when I was making a movie virtually every year, which is a lot. The sheer rapidity of these projects meant there was a proper wage coming in.\n\nWhat are your current sources of income?\n\nMy income is nearly all from directing and writing fees. I’ve turned my hand to scriptwriting more regularly and I have also set up a production company, Anyway Productions. We have developed a number of projects which, if they go into production, should generate more income.\n\nWhat has been your worst financial decision?\n\nThere was a co-production where our partners were not true to their word. Suddenly we were left with a shortfall in the budget of about £1.5m. That’s quite difficult if the show is already on the road and you’re signed up to the talent and the locations.\n\nWe decided that as we were so far in, we had to carry on. It meant that we took almost nothing for a year’s work. It’s very easy to be exposed in the film industry.\n\nHave you ever been ripped off?\n\nYes. I have been very slow to learn this, but you cannot take some producers’ word on the state of the budget. There have been a few occasions when I have trusted people but they have not even built the ship and you are launching.\n\nIt’s not through malicious reasons, but it can take a hell of a lot of nerve and good fortune to get these projects going.\n\nHas the world of TV and film changed since you started?\n\nMassively. In the early days, not many films were made in the UK.\n\nI made Othello [starring Laurence Fishburne and Kenneth Branagh] for $10m (£7.6m) in 1995. Mid‑scale films of that budget have now become really hard to fund.\n\nSwimming With Men has a smaller budget than my usual films and so my fee is smaller too. I often try to line up jobs, but given the fickle nature of film production it rarely works out that way.\n\nAs a result I am increasingly looking towards TV, where some great work is being made. TV has really hit a wonderful patch and talent is streaming into it.\n\nI do also have some low to mid‑risk investments which I trust to my advisers and don’t follow that closely.\n\nWhat have you treated yourself to when times are good?\n\nWe have taken some great family holidays, whether it’s Namibia, India or Jamaica. My wife is the adventurous type and will whisk us off somewhere exotic. Food is also a passion of Cassia’s and we enjoy a lot of excellent restaurants.\n\nWhat is the biggest financial lesson you have learnt?\n\nRead the small print. And don’t agree to things too quickly. I remember Richard Eyre, the film director, saying that you should always ask who the producer is.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how great the project – if you don’t have someone with a really firm hand on the tiller, the whole thing can come apart. I am often guilty of falling for a great project and forgetting this lesson."
