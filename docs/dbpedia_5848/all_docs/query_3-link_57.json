        "text": "STILLWATER, Okla. — Back in the fall of 2021, there was a room of freshmen defenders living together in Stillwater.\n\nFour members of Oklahoma State's 2021 signing class were roommates for the 2021-22 school year: Nick Martin, Collin Oliver, Lyrik Rawls and Ty Williams. The group quickly became friends, being from East Texas and Oklahoma, and started to push each other to be great for the Cowboys.\n\nOver the last three seasons, the four freshman year roommates have had varied levels of success and heading into what could be their final year in Stillwater, Rawls has a great sense of pride for his friends and wants to contribute this season after suffering an injury that sidelined him for much of 2023.\n\n\"It was inspirational,\" Rawls told GoPokes247 of Martin having the breakout season he did a year ago. \"To see my roommates out here winning these awards is really cool and it's possible for me too. They're my brothers out there doing their thing.\"\n\nRawls suffered a season-ending leg injury a few weeks into the season and required surgery. He had 20 tackles and an interception in the three games played.\n\nSidelined, the Jefferson, Texas native spent time away from football, talking with friends, growing deeper in his faith and putting in hours at the academic center.\n\nIt definitely took a toll on him after a strong start to his redshirt sophomore season.\n\n\"I'm feeling good and feeling good to get back out there and not have to just watch anymore,\" Rawls said. \"It was heavy on my mental. I had never been hurt before, so just sitting back and watching wasn't easy to do. I had to do what was best for me, swallow the pill and just work on what I could do.\n\n\"I want to be able to get back in there like nothing ever happened to me. I want to get back in the mix, make some plays and do what I can to help the team.\"\n\nIn the offseason this winter, Rawls and the defense sat down with defensive coordinator Bryan Nardo and discussed what went wrong in the coordinator's first season at Oklahoma State. These were honest meetings, and they were more beneficial than the meetings from spring 2023 because Nardo understood who the players were as players and as people.\n\n\"He's gotten to know us,\" said defensive lineman Jaleel Johnson. \"He's moved us around. He's switched us in…I feel like he has improved a lot and he's big on culture.\"\n\nRawls agreed that Nardo being more comfortable around his players will prove to be beneficial in Year Two.\n\n\"I feel like he's in a more comfortable position now,\" Rawls said. \"He's able to talk to the players better because he knows the players. He's had everyone for a year now and brings back a lot of returning key players. I feel like he's able to talk to us more familiarly. He can relate to us more, which helps the on field results.\"\n\nOne of those many key returning players is nose tackle Justin Kirkland, who is back for his second year after transferring from FCS Utah Tech last offseason.\n\nKirkland got better as the season went on, getting reps against Power Five talent and growing more comfortable with his coaches and teammates.\n\nThis season, for Kirkland and the returning defensive starters, it's more about ironing out the little things as opposed to last offseason where they spent a lot of time just learning new schemes and learning each other.\n\n\"I have a year under my belt and I know what to expect,\" Kirkland said. \"The football part is the football part. That'll work itself out on the field, but what time do I have to get to meetings, what about the hotel? It was more about just setting up the routine where now I know what to do. I'm working on minute things to help my game.\"\n\nThe focus on the little things as opposed to teaching is true across the field for a roster of veteran players, but especially on the defense who overall has younger faces. Head coach Mike Gundy feels like this year's team is further along at this point in the preseason than they were a year ago.\n\nIt's allowed them to get into a \"football-mode\" as opposed to a longer install period.\n\n\"The good news is we have identified what the issues were and now the coaches have to work to fix those issues and find a plan to get the players to understand why that happened and how we can get better and it's honestly not real complicated,\" Gundy said Saturday. \"You tackle better. You don't drop coverage and you keep everything in front of you and it forces the offense to run nine, 10, 11-play drives and then in most cases an offense will mess it up.\"\n\nWith so much experience across the field, the expectation to return to Arlington is prevalent. Nardo and his players feel confident that the mistakes have been addressed and they're better for it.\n\nIn a few weeks, Oklahoma State will be able to put the improved defense to the test against a team that hasn't lost a game since September 2022.\n\n\"With everyone coming back, we're only improving as a team,\" Johnson said. \"I feel like we've built a stronger bond. We can win it and bring it home this year.\""
