        "text": "https://lnkd.in/gaVte9rX For the past two years, I’ve been filming my conversations over tea with Marthe Cohn, a 103-year-old French Jewish woman who kept a secret for nearly six decades: after helping her family and hundreds of others evade the Nazis, she transformed herself into the covert weapon her people needed—a spy who infiltrated enemy lines to glean intel that helped win WWII. Our conversations are the basis for my upcoming feature documentary, 103. Your tax-deductible donation to the film would help immeasurably, and ensure that this extraordinary tale of Marthe Cohn’s courageous resistance will continue to inspire current and future generations.
