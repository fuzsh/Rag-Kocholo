        "text": "Pittsburgh Sound + Image shines a light on a maker of educational films who has, until now, been completely omitted from our collective film history. As director, she was often credited simply as “Maclovia.”\n\nWe introduce her to you under her full name, Maclovia Rodriguez. In the 1960s and 70s, she made a string of charming, empathetic short films for Encyclopædia Britannica that circulated widely in schools but have largely been forgotten in the intervening 50 years. Experience the anxieties and joys of personal and cultural change from a child's perspective as we watch the following films:\n\nAn Autumn Story: Mrs. Pennypacker's Package\n\nManuel from Puerto Rico\n\nThe Blue Dashiki: Jeffrey and His City Neighbors\n\nChicano from the Southwest\n\nGlasses for Susan: A New Day\n\nWhat Do You Do While You Wait?\n\nThe total runtime is approximately 77 minutes. All films presented from original 16mm prints courtesy of Flea Market Films, except for The Blue Dashiki, which is courtesy of Orgone Archive.\n\nChildren’s educator Valerie Herrero will join PSI’s Steven Haines for a post-screening discussion of the films.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the NEW Glitterbox Theater\n\n210 West 8th Avenue, Homestead, PA 15120\n\nDoors at 7:30, movies start at 8\n\nTickets $10. As always, Pittsburgh Sound + Image members get in for FREE\n\nAbout our guest:\n\nValerie Herrero is an avid adventurer and finds inspiration from closely observing everyday wonders and curiosities. Valerie has worked in education and community programming for the past 11 years and has taught at several organizations including Carnegie Museum of Art, Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, Assemble, The Pittsburgh Glass Center, The Ellis school, The Mattress Factory, and Pittsburgh Public Schools. She has an MEd in early childhood education from Carlow University. Having grown up amidst woods and fields scattered throughout Ohio, she appreciates the ways nature has been a great teacher to her. Valerie loves cultivating collaborative spaces, making meaning through exploration, and learning from the people she meets along the way. Her artwork and performance projects are filled with wonderings about fleeting time, the process of change, and the intricate connections that make up the gentle balance of life on Earth. She currently lives in McKees Rocks with her cat, Cow Kitty."
