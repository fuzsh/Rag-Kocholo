I got the impression this was a filmmaker at her peak; how can Céline possibly surpass this? No need, frankly – to achieve just one piece of work as good as this in a filmography would be enough. Note to self: Must. Write. Something. Worthwhile. 2020.\n\nNapszállta (Sunset, László Nemes, 2018)\n\nSo utterly mysterious, ambitious and intriguing. Found myself asking what on earth inspired someone to make this peculiar film? Doesn’t matter, film culture is extremely grateful.\n\nA Hidden Life (Terrence Malick, 2019)\n\nMr Malick returns to form and delivers what he does best: cinematic poetry. Even his “failures” are generally more interesting than whatever else is out on release at the time. I recall Christopher Plummer once commenting that “the problem with Terry is he needs a writer, desperately”. I hear Mr Plummer, but profoundly disagree; leave Terry be.\n\nMadeleine’s Madeline (Josephine Decker, 2019)\n\nThis came out of nowhere and was so bold and refreshing. Hooked from the start and definitely felt the need to make a bloody film asap.\n\nCall Me By Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017)\n\nI’d seen the film only in numerous pieces on many occasions (ushered in countless shows at Curzon Soho, London where it played for months) but I needed to let some time pass before devouring it as a whole (at the cinema, to be clear). There’s an electricity that permeates throughout; every now and then a film just has that “something” which can’t be described. I used to work in film production and I’d give almost anything to have been crew on Call Me By Your Name. I’ll never forget the magic in the auditorium when we had Luca, Timothée and surprise guest Armie (donning fetching red tracksuit) for a Q&A; confession: I completely choked up in response to the audience reaction as the lads arrived on-stage. Beatlemania…ish.\n\nThe Farewell (Lulu Wang, 2019)\n\nDidn’t see this coming; so special. A mirror. Films can most definitely change your life.\n\nMektoub, My Love: Canto Uno (Abdellatif Kechiche, 2019)\n\nA severely under-rated, extraordinary ensemble piece filled to the brim with life…and an often wandering camera. But regardless of how apparently unacceptable it is to approve of this film I simply can’t (won’t) deny how I felt during that initial screening. Joyous. To Cinema!\n\nUncut Gems (Josh and Benny Safdie, 2019)\n\nRelentless. A delicious follow-up to Good Time from these ridiculously talented brothers, and indeed a showcase for Adam Sandler who after The Meyerowitz Stories once again proves his cinematic worth.\n\nHigh Life (Claire Denis, 2019)\n\nSci-fi? Well I’m sold, whatever Claire does. Didn’t hurt that this one happened to be brilliant, and so completely different to her previous (and equally brilliant) film Let the Sunshine In.\n\nBros: After the Screaming Stops (Joe Pearlman and David Soutar, 2018)\n\nThis came to mind and I couldn’t resist. I really connected with this documentary which was caught late on BBC iPlayer, and to be clear – I was with the brothers throughout, never mocking them like lots seemed to do. Genuinely moved by the whole thing.\n\nThe Souvenir (Joanna Hogg, 2019)\n\nA distinct pleasure.\n\nTini zabutykh predkiv (Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors) and Tsvet granata (The Colour of Pomegranates) (Sergei Parajanov, 1965 and 1969 respectively)\n\nIf ever in need of restored faith in cinema, turn to Sergei. There’s nothing quite like these films. Jaw-dropping in the Tarkovsky sense; it’s no surprise the two men were contemporaries/friends. No words can really describe the work; I’d insist viewing on the big screen and if that means waiting, then so be it. That’s what I did.\n\nUn amour impossible (An Impossible Love, Catherine Corsini, 2019)\n\nAn old friend saw this at the London Film Festival in 2018 and highly recommended it; she was completely on the ball; an unassuming, magnificent piece of work.\n\nLoro (Paolo Sorrentino, 2019)\n\nA fine mess.\n\nLos Olvidados (Luis Buñuel, 1950)\n\nCurious to find a largely conventional film by Mr Buñuel. I’d trade it for Un Chien Andalou any day, but Los Olvidados is a cracker, nonetheless.\n\nStraub-Huillet retrospective 2019\n\nFrom the BFI to the ICA to MUBI; it was never easy but so very rewarding and each and every film, from Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach, 1968) to Geschichtsunterricht (History Lessons, 1972) to Sicilia! (1999) will be revisited time and time again no doubt. Unbelievable.\n\nProgram of the Year\n\nTaipei Stories at Close-Up Film Centre, London\n\nThis season featured the films of Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-hsien and Tsai Ming-liang. Of everything CINEMA in 2019, this program was the ultimate.\n\nFrom the beautiful so-called melodramas of Edward Yang such as Hai tan de yi tian (That Day on the Beach, 1983) and Yī Yī (A One and a Two, 2000) through the inventive Zuìhǎo de shíguāng (Three Times, 2006) by Hou Hsiao-hsien to the bleak but powerful Qīngshàonián Nézhā (Rebels of the Neon God, 1992) by Tsai Ming-liang, these films all struck me in different ways and proved deeply inspirational.\n\nThe one that hit the most was Tsai Ming-Liang’s Jiaoyou (Stray Dogs, 2013) which I somehow managed to miss on release. What a film, what a filmmaker.\n\nCompletely separate to the above season – months later – came the release of Wang Xiaoshuai’s heartbreaking saga Dìjiǔtiāncháng (So Long, My Son, 2019). Within seconds I’d connected the film with Taipei Stories and had perhaps found a new maker of the finest “melodrama” (after the late Edward Yang), which is meant as a huge compliment. It’s rare to sit through a three hour film and not want it to end. In fact, I’m in need of a re-visit.\n\nFinal note: I haven’t seen For Sama yet.\n\nStefano Miraglia\n\nArtist and curator.

With an intelligent script that brings wit where appropriate amongst the film’s dramatic progression, and outstanding performances from Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, this may be a hard watch for anyone experiencing relationship issues, but this slice-of-life comedy-drama has an emotional poignancy to live on in the memories of anyone that has watched this. That and you will not hear the Stephen Sondheim standard, “Being Alive”, the same ever again.\n\nHot and Tasty (Laura Jayne Hodkin, 2019)\n\nThis brilliant student film has such stunning use of colour and bold use of character design, you can honestly say that Laura Hodkin deserves to be an original animation artist to look out for in the future, with her wonderful snide on bestie relationships as well the as post-night-club activity of grabbing a cheeky takeaway.\n\nPagans (Lucy Luscombe, 2019)\n\nPagans is an amazing slice-of-life drama that deals with the sudden loss of a friend. For anyone that has ever lost a loved one, you will find this British short drama a rewarding journey with a balance of its themes of acceptance and struggling to cope with such a tragedy.\n\nOnce Upon a Time… in Hollywood (Quentin Tarantino, 2019)\n\nWith standout performances from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, you can honestly say that this is a subliminal snide towards the nostalgia of the 1960s, with Tarantino’s distinct eye for soundtrack choices, as well as the ending being somewhat archetypal of the director’s approach to violence, with dark wit thrown in for good measure. Subversive just about sums up this extraordinary epic that addresses finding work alongside the dark side of Hollywood.\n\nThe Irishman (Martin Scorsese, 2019)\n\nFor anyone that can binge-watch 3 episodes of your box set of choice, you will find The Irishman a sort of geriatric take on Goodfellas. Whilst fans of Scorsese will enjoy seeing DeNiro and Pesci playing these real-life mobsters, it should be noted that the likes of Al Pacino, as the cartoonish Jimmy Hoffa, and Stephen Graham’s convincing accent make worthwhile additions into this poignant true story where crime doesn’t pay for those that live into the twilight of their years.\n\nFor Sama (Waad Al-Kateab/Edward Watts, 2019)\n\nFor Sama is an excellent documentary in which Waad Al-Kateab chronicles a loving relationship in war-torn Syria. The film documents the pitfalls and struggles of Al-Kateab’s raising a family during such a conflicted period in the country’s recent history. Engaging, riveting and downright emotional for all the right reasons, you will not see a more powerful love story in a war-torn country.\n\nMade Public (Foster Wilson, 2019)\n\nFor anyone that is glued to social media on their phones, you may wish to watch Made Public, a cautionary comic fable where the groom uses a Facebook poll to determine the outcome of his wedding. With a sharp and witty script, Made Public is not only laugh-out-loud amusing but also probably one of the best romantic comedies in recent memories.\n\nApollo 11 (Todd Douglas Miller, 2019)\n\nWith all the anniversaries of such historical landmarks this year, it only seems appropriate that one of the best documentaries of the year coincides with the 50th anniversary of the moon landing in 1969, in which the titular vehicle helped propelled the astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins into public consciousness as well as the history books. Todd Douglas Miller manages to tackle such a broad and popular topic (there have been many addressing this topic this year!) into just over 90 minutes in an engaging and thrilling space venture with a visually striking use of imagery and dramatic music, particularly for the countdown sequences.\n\nJoker (Todd Phillips, 2019)\n\nIs this the best DC film outside of Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy, or a false masterpiece of an origin story that idolises the iconic comic book villain to a vigilante people look up to during troubled times? Whatever your view on Joker, there is no denying Joaquin Phoenix’s portrayal certainly brings out certain characteristics, like that manic laughter, into the spotlight, that other actors may not have thought about. Besides, Robert DeNiro appearing as the titular character’s favourite talk show host does bring an element of The King of Comedy to the mix of the film’s false-retro aesthetics. There are a few Easter eggs to keep the average Batman fan happy, but its grim undertone juggling themes of mental health funds and finding a role model against political frustration make this comic-book film just for grown-ups.\n\nThe Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (Mike Mitchell, 2019)\n\nIn a year in which we had sequel after sequel serving as primal currency for box office blockbusters, we find ourselves with the second installment to Warner Bros’ The Lego Movie which has a balance of great comic timing and some memorable music. With such exquisite musicality, you wish that it would pick up the 2020 Best Song Oscar with the brilliantly named “A Catchy Song”, currently on the Academy shortlists for such an accolade. Whilst the fun and games do bring out the core theme of collaborating with others, this sequel is just great entertainment, whilst the semi-serious ending being shoehorned may dent that experience slightly, it is still a noteworthy sequel to endure and enjoy.\n\nDarragh O’Donoghue\n\nArchivist at Tate, contributing writer for Cineaste, struggling through a PhD on the Stephen Dwoskin Archive at the University of Reading\n\nTop Ten\n\nAnimus animalis (A Story About People, Animals and Things) (Aiste Zegulyte, 2018)\n\nCele două execuții ale Mareșalului (The Marshal’s Two Executions, Radu Jude, 2018)\n\nDogman (Matteo Garrone, 2018)\n\nFin de siglo (End of the Century, Lucio Castro, 2019)\n\nHuo shan (Up the Mountain, Zhang Yang, 2018)\n\nKabir Singh (Sandeep Reddy Vanga, 2019)\n\nA film about a misogynist or a misogynistic film?

This skews the film towards the husband, although Adam Driver’s complacency is probed rather than indulged for once. Laura Dern gives a masterclass in effortlessness. When Baumbach reveals his primary sources, however – Bergman and Sondheim, artists fearless in scraping emotional depths – he concedes how tidy and superficial his film is.\n\nMowa ptaków (Bird Talk, Xawery Żuławski, 2019)\n\nSomething for the Boys (Hannah Quinlan & Rosie Hastings, 2018)\n\nTalking about Trees (Suhaib Gasmelbari, 2019)\n\nThis Way Up (Alex Winckler, 2019)\n\nThe Tiger Who Came to Tea (Robin Shaw, 2019)\n\nTime and Tide (Marleen van der Werf, 2018)\n\nWar (Siddharth Anand, 2019)\n\nA skilful Mission impossible knock-off transmuted into art by Hrithik Roshan’s rubber-limbed grace.\n\nWhat We Do in the Shadows (Jemaine Clement et al, 2019)\n\nAnd I appear to be the only person in the world who cried with laughter at Holmes & Watson (Etan Cohen, 2018)\n\nDuds and Disappointments\n\nBack to Berlin (Catherine Lurie, 2018)\n\nThe Dead Don’t Die (Jim Jarmusch, 2019)\n\nSlack cinephile slop.

It reminded me of being dragged to mass as a kid! It is curious in these punitively “woke” times how a white colonial male artist continues to be given a critical free pass to traffic in black, female and/or indigent suffering for Western consumption.\n\n“Flat pack” arts documentaries that shoehorn diverse subjects into the same public TV chronological/biographical narrative format and sidestep the difficulty of the work for fear of frightening the viewer : Barbara Rubin and the Exploding NY Underground (Chuck Smith, 2018); George (Jeffrey Perkins, 2019); Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool (Stanley Nelson, 2019); Searching for Sam: Adrian Dunbar on Samuel Beckett (Paul McGuigan, 2019) and the like.\n\nBest Revival\n\nI was thrilled to see for the first time Eine Dubarry von heute (A Modern Du Barry, Alexander Korda, 1926), Night Nurse (William A. Wellman, 1931), First a Girl (Victor Saville, 1935), Maclovia (Emilio Fernández, 1948), No Man of Her Own (Mitchell Leisen, 1950), The Cool World (Shirley Clarke, 1964), Vuk samotnjak (The Lone Wolf, Obrad Gluščević, 1972), Variety (Bette Gordon, 1983; part of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London’s terrific I, I, I, I, I, I, I, Kathy Acker exhibition), Le garçu (Maurice Pialat, 1995), Gudu (Alone, Wang Bing, 2013), and in particular Nachom-ia kumpasar (Bardroy Barretto, 2015) in various seasons and retrospectives.\n\nNevertheless, a rote repertory screening of Spellbound (Alfred Hitchcock, 1946) at the Regent Street Cinema was my revival of the year, for a very troubling reason – it was the first Hitchcock film I was able to see on film since moving to his home city half a decade ago. Something has gone badly wrong there.\n\nBest Publication\n\nFilm Culture 80: The Legend of Barbara Rubin (2018). Although the same people were involved in the Rubin documentary (see above), this collection of letters and scripts alone preserves the essential and uncontainable vitality of Rubin’s voice.\n\nCinema-Related Non-Film Event\n\nStaged soon after his death by Charing Cross Theatre, London, Michel Legrand’s beguiling fantasy romance Amour (2002) is the closest we’ll get to a lost Jacques Demy film.\n\nRoberto Oggiano\n\nFILM CRITIC AND PROGRAMMER BASED IN BRISTOL (UK), HOST OF CINEMA AND SOUNDTRACK RADIO SHOW CAIRO STATION\n\nHere is my 2019 end of the year list in no particular order.\n\nLiberté (Albert Serra, 2019)\n\nNe croyez surtout pas que je hurle (Just Don’t Think I Will Scream, Frank Beauvais, 2019)\n\nA Portuguesa (The Portuguese Woman, Rita Azevedo Gomes, 2018)\n\nBait (Mark Jenkin, 2019)\n\nAtlantis (Valentyn Vasyanovych, 2019)\n\nBlanco en blanco (White on White, Théo Court, 2019)\n\nVox Lux (Brady Corbet, 2018)\n\nThe Beast in the Jungle (Clara Van Gool, 2019)\n\nAbou Leila (Amin Sidi-Boumédine, 2019)\n\nThe Souvenir(Joanna Hogg, 2019)\n\nSpecial mentions\n\nSophia Antipolis (Virgil Vernier, 2018)\n\nEffetto Domino (Alessandro Rossetto, 2019)\n\nO que arde (Fire Will Come, Oliver Laxe, 2019)\n\nLa llorona (The Weeping Woman, Jayro Bustamante, 2019)\n\nBurning Cane (Phillip Michael Youmans, 2019)\n\nDe nuevo otra vez (Again Once Again, Romina Paula, 2019)\n\nVitalina Varela (Pedro Costa, 2019)\n\nA Vida Invisível de Eurídice Gusmão (Invisible Life, Karim Aïnouz, 2019)\n\nSynonymes (Synonymes, Nadav Lapid, 2019)\n\nOld but Gold\n\nMaria Zef(Vittorio Cottafavi, 1981)\n\nL’Affaire des Divisions Morituri (The Case of Morituri Division, F.J.

The key to understanding the present has always been in the past.\n\nOur Lady of the Nile (Atiq Rahimi, 2019)\n\nEvil doesn’t just appear. It starts from a hateful glance, a casual remark.
