        "text": "THE LIFE CAREER AND DISAPPEARANCE OF MILTON REID\n\nhttp://theblackboxclub.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-life-career-and-of-disappearance.html\n\nSometimes you’ll be watching a film and a minor supporting player will suddenly appear and command your attention in a way that is more powerful and immediate than the leading actors. It could a physical gesture they make or a line of dialogue uttered in an unusual way or simply the look of their face or body or both. Milton Reid is one of those actors. His credit is likely to be down toward the bottom of the cast list with the designated role of “The Executioner” or “The Bodyguard” or “The Club Bouncer” or “The Big Pirate” but it’s his mug that will stick in your memory long after the film fades. He appears to be of Asian descent though one biographical reference intimated that his ususual features were the result of Turner syndrome which is incorrect because that rare genetic disorder only affects about 1 out of every 2,500 FEMALE births. But it’s possible that his exotic look was the result of something other than being the son of an Irish father and Indian (as in Bombay) mother.\n\nStrangely enough, my introduction to this imposing character actor wasn’t in a movie but in a series of trading cards issued by Universal in 1963 known as “Spook Stories” which stuck silly captions on stills from the studio’s horror films (here’s a link to an article on Monster trading cards –There were two images of Mr. Reid from the 1962 Hammer film NIGHT CREATURES that conjured up all kinds of crazy scenarios in my mind of who this character was. (The original British title of NIGHT CREATURES was CAPTAIN CLEGG which was a remake of the 1937 British feature; Walt Disney remade it in 1963 for television where it was broadcast in three parts on “The Wonderful World of Disney” as “The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh” and Patrick McGoohan played “The Scarecrow” aka Dr. Syn.)\n\nWhen I finally caught up with NIGHT CREATURES years later Mr. Reid does indeed pop out of the screen during his brief scenes as “The Mulatto,” a huge mountain of a man whose tongue is cut out because of his treachery to the pirate Captain Clegg. He is later used by the relentless Captain Collier (Patrick Allen) to sniff out the incognito Clegg who is behind a smuggling operation in the village of Dymchurch. The film is a rousing and highly atmospheric period thriller with some wonderful visuals (the appearance of the marsh phantoms), and spirited performances (Peter Cushing, Patrick Allen and Oliver Reed have fun with their roles). But Milton Reid’s larger than life presence is mesmerizing. He’s like a caged wild animal here, grunting, growling and desperate, and though his part is relatively small, it’s of crucial importance to the story and leads to Clegg’s undoing.\n\nNIGHT CREATURES, however, is probably an exception to most of the films Reid made where his on-screen time was barely more than that of an extra. And he rarely had dialogue because with a face and body like that who needs it? But even in one scene appearances or minor supporting roles you couldn’t miss the guy. He stands out the way Tor Johnson does in the Ed Wood films. You can’t look at anything else. You might not have known his name but you’ve probably seen him many times – he was the Japanese executioner in THE CAMP ON BLOOD ISLAND (1958), the big pirate in Walt Disney’s SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960), a guard working for DR. NO (1962), the strong man in BERSERK! (1967), the mute dog handler in THE BLOOD ON SATAN’S CLAW (1971) which will be shown on TCM’s Underground franchise on 3/28, Biederbeck’s man servant in DR. PHIBES RISES AGAIN (1972), he played Sabbala in THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT (1977) and Sandor in THE SPY WHO LOVED MEdr np (1977).\n\nAccording to a biography for Reid posted on IMDB by Jim Marshall, Reid was born in Bombay, India in 1917. He moved to London in 1936, married fashion illustrator Bertha Lilian Guyett in 1939 and made his first film appearance in the British propaganda film THE WAY AHEAD in 1944. Then the bio gets extremely interesting: “After the war he trained as a wrestler, turning professional in 1952, firstly as a Tarzan-like character called Jungle Boy wearing leopard skin trunks. He also continued to play small parts in films, usually as a tough guy or bodyguard, often as a cruel henchman such as the Japanese executioner in THE CAMP ON BLOOD ISLAND (1958). His break-through came in 1959 when he was required to shave his head for the role of Yen the pirate in FERRY TO HONG KONG. He remained shaven-headed for the rest of his career, also changing his wrestling image to that of “The Mighty Chang,” an oriental giant. On stage he played in pantomime at the London Palladium as the Slave of the Lamp…However, most people remember Milton Reid as the bodyguard sorting out pretty girls for his boss in a long-running pipe tobacco commercial. In 1964 Milton challenged “The Great Togo” (aka Harold Sakata) to a wrestling contest to decide who would play the coveted role of Odd-Job in G0LDFINGER. Unfortunately, Milton had already been killed off in the first Bond movie Dr No (1962), so the producers were forced to pick Sakata and the “eliminator contest” wasn’t needed.”\n\nReid’s film career began to wind down in the late seventies and some of his last roles were in such sleazy softcore features as CONFESSIONS FROM THE DAVID GALAXY AFFAIR (1979) and QUEEN OF THE BLUES (1979), his final credited screen appearance. According to a poster on the britmovie.co.uk forums, there is an article on Reid in the book KEEPING THE BRITISH END UP, a survey of British softcore sex comedies. However, Reid’s story becomes much more unusual after 1979. Jim Marshall’s IMDB bio states that “Milton decided to try his luck in “Bollywood” and in 1980 returned to India. However, various problems arose and in 1981 he was arrested by Indian police for “trespassing, damaging furniture and disconnecting a telephone.” The trouble started when he visited his mother and sister in Bangalore, and there was a dispute with tenants at his sister’s bungalow. Police also complained of violence and abuse when they tried to detain him, and there were accusations of a manservant being assaulted. The following year Milton was stated by some reference works to have died from a heart attack, but that was incorrect. The actor’s son (same name) was still receiving correspondence sent by his father from Bangalore up to December 1986. Significantly, nothing was heard after that date, and the present assumption is that Milton Reid died in obscurity somewhere in India during the early part of 1987, although no death certificate or confirmation has been received by the family. Sadly, Bertha died in England in 1997, at the age of 90, still not knowing what had become of her husband. However, research continues.”\n\nDespite the above information, some internet biographical sources have maintained that Reid died of a heart attack in London in 1982 but offer no explanation or evidence of their research. Reid’s grandson, Ian Reid, in fact, has challenged this fact in a web posting that read “I would be very interested to find out where the information about his death came from as this does not agree with how my family and I believe his life came to an end. His death and the location of his death are in fact a mystery. Therefore I would be interested to hear about any proof that backs up the claim that he died in London of a heart attack in 1982.”\n\nWe may never know what happened to “The Mighty Chang” but at least we can marvel at his unique presence in more than fifty films.\n\nIMAGES: Marcus Brooks\n\nA Cocktail Recipe For\n\nDisaster: Peter Sellers And\n\nOrson Welles On The\n\nMaking Of Casino Royale\n\nhttps://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/a-cocktail-recipe-for-disaster-peter-sellers-and-orson-welles-on-the-making-of-casino-royale\n\nTake one deluded producer, two huge egos, four directors, five 007s and half-a-dozen writers. Sprinkle with cash, add jokes to taste, shake, stir - and voila! Casino Royale: a cocktail recipe for disaster\n\nRichard Luck | Updated on Nov 2, 2015\n\nCasino Royale must have looked an appetising prospect when it went into pre-production in 1965. The Saltzman/Broccoli Bond movies had established the playboy spy as a bankable commodity, and when producer Charles Feldman signed up comic genius Peter Sellers for his film version of Fleming's novel, he doubtless thought he had a licence to print money. Rather than breaking box-office records, however, Feldman's $12 million movie would devour its budget, fail to recoup its costs and destroy careers, including his own.\n\nBut Casino Royale was cursed even before Feldman optioned it in the early '60s. CBS, who had made a US TV movie of it in 1954, passed the option on to actor-director Gregory Ratoff. He signed to make a big-screen version for Fox in 1960 - only to die before a frame was shot.\n\nAs for Feldman, his problems began the day he hired Sellers - at the time one of the biggest movie stars in the world. The impact of his performances in Dr Strangelove, in addition to the commercial success of the Pink Panther movies, elevated Sellers to a position of rare power for a comic actor. Feldman knew from experience that Sellers was a draw - the actor had helped make a hit of the producer's giddy comedy What's New Pussycat? - so he agreed to pay the former Goon a then-unheard-of $1m to play accountant and Bond imposter Evelyn Tremble.\n\nNo sooner had he agreed terms than Sellers fell out with Feldman and began to act irrationally. He insisted that the producer hire his friend, TV director Joe McGrath, and refused to appear on set with co-star Orson Welles. Many concluded that the already eccentric Sellers had gone mad, especially after he came to blows with McGrath and then fled the set - never to return.\n\nThe impact of his performances in Dr Strangelove, in addition to the commercial success of the Pink Panther movies, elevated Sellers to a position of rare power for a comic actor\n\nPeter Sellers' walkout seemed to spell the end of Casino Royale. But rather than capitulating, Charles Feldman reverted to his original plan and set about making a truly immense movie. Out went McGrath and original writer Wolf Mankowitz; in came a string of different directors - Val Guest, John Huston, Richard Talmadge, Robert Parrish, Ken Hughes - and a raft of screenwriters that included co-stars Woody Allen and David Niven, Hollywood legend Billy Wilder and groundbreaking novelist Terry Southern .\n\nThe end result has to be one of the strangest films ever made by a Hollywood studio. The combination of Sellers' walkout and Feldman's extravagance deprived Casino Royale of anything approaching structure and transformed it into a series of unconnected sketches. Worst of all, here was a comedy almost totally devoid of laughs.\n\nIt was to be Feldman's swansong: he died of stomach cancer within a year of the film's 1967 premiere. The paranoid Peter Sellers had predicted as much. \"Feldman is going to die!\" he once ranted, \"and the reason he'll die is so he can blame me! He'll say, 'Sellers killed me!' He'll do it to spite me!\"\n\nCharles Feldman (producer): I love the movies, always have. I like money too, but only because it lets me make the movies I want to make.\n\nOrson Welles (actor, Le Chiffre): The movies need people like Charles Feldman: rich, jolly, generous men who're happy writing cheques.\n\nVal Guest (director): Charlie found out that, when he bought the book, all he got was the title. Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli had already used everything in the book except the baccarat game, so the whole thing had to be structured around that.\n\nWoody Allen (actor, Jimmy Bond/Dr Noah): I was offered a lot of money and a small part. My manager said, \"Why not? It could become a big movie.\" So I went to London. I was on a good salary and expense account. But they didn't film me for six months! I stayed in London at their expense for six months! That's only one example of how utterly wasteful the project was.\n\nI once saw him on one phone to Peter Sellers, on a second to United Artists and on a third to the Italian government\n\nBryan Forbes (first-choice director): Charlie came into my life brandishing a copy of Casino Royale. He told me he wanted to have five James Bond and would guarantee me an all-star cast. \"You can write it wherever you want. Do you like the south of France?\" Gifts started to arrive - silk scarves, theatre tickets. Charlie was talking Monopoly money to secure my services. Every time I expressed doubts, he sweetened the deal.\n\nPeter Sellers (actor, Evelyn Tremble): People will swim through shit if you put a few bob in it.\n\nWoody Allen: Charlie was a genius. I once saw him on one phone to Peter Sellers, on a second to United Artists and on a third to the Italian government. He was a big-time charming con man and I never trusted him for a second.\n\nBryan Forbes: I said 'yes' to Charlie and then thought about the basic idiocies of the script. Five Bonds! That meant departing from the novel. I called one of Charlie's assistants who went into a fit on the phone. But I stuck to my guns.\n\nWolf Mankowitz (screenwriter): Peter Sellers was a treacherous lunatic. My advice to Feldman was not in any circumstances to get involved with Sellers. But Sellers was at his peak. I told Charlie that Sellers would fuck it all up.\n\nJoseph McGrath (director): Feldman was glad to get Peter at any price. He'd put up the money for Sellers' insurance on What's New Pussycat? - after his heart attack, nobody would cover him.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Charlie gave Sellers a Rolls Royce on the first day of shooting as a come-on.\n\nPeter Sellers: I was offered $1 million to play Bond. I said, \"You must be out of your bloody minds - what about Sean Connery?\" Feldman said, \"Yes, I know, but I have this book and I'm going to make it.\" I said, \"I certainly can't play Bond!\"\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Charlie Feldman offered Peter more and more money to play 007. In the end, the fee was so large Peter would have been mad to turn it down.\n\nPeter Sellers: I wanted to play James Bond the way Tony Hancock would play him. But Ian Fleming's people would never have allowed it.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: In the end, Peter didn't play Bond. He played Evelyn Tremble. \"Who's Evelyn Tremble?\" everyone asked. Nobody knew. But then we didn't know who Sellers was either.\n\nCharles Feldman: The only way to make a film with Peter is to let him direct, write and produce it as well as star in it.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers wanted different directors; he wanted to piss around with the script. He knew nothing about anything except doing funny faces and funny voices.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter asked me if I'd be interested in directing a film he'd agreed to star in. I said, \"I'd be delighted to.\" And that's where the trouble started.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: By Casino Royale, Peter Sellers was pretty well round the bend and couldn't function properly. He'd change the order of shooting. He'd be 'unavailable' or constantly change his timing, making it hard to splice material together.\n\nSellers was frightened of the scale of Orson - his legend, literally his weight and immensity.\n\nOrson Welles: Sellers wasn't terribly bright, but he came on as the great actor.\n\nJoseph McGrath: One of the problems that blew the film apart was that Orson and I got along really well. And Sellers got really annoyed. \"I didn't think you and Orson would take sides against me.\" I said, \"I'm not - but Orson thinks we can come up with some funny stuff.\" Sellers replied, \"I'll only attempt to come up with funny stuff so long as he's not here.\" He was frightened of the scale of Orson - his legend, literally his weight and immensity.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: I'll never forget the occasion Orson and I, two rather large fellows, were in the lift. The door opened and Sellers was there. Sellers wasn't talking to Orson, and he was none too keen on me either. He wouldn't go down in the lift with us - said it wasn't safe. Orson was pissed off. \"What the fuck is he talking about?\" \"I think he means the combined weight, Orson.\" \"What the fuck does he weigh? Skinny as a shrimp. Looks like a shrimp, come to think of it.\"\n\nJoseph McGrath: Orson didn't have the same attitude about his career as Peter did. Peter was what he did. Orson thought, I'll be here for four weeks, let's enjoy ourselves. Peter's thing was: My career is on the line.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Peter was terrified of playing with Orson and converted this into an aversion for him.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Orson would come onto the set at 9am prompt, sit down at the baccarat table and say, \"So, Joe, where's our thin friend today?\"\n\nOrson Welles: Sellers was very proud of how thin he was. Apparently, he'd taken a lot of pills to help shift the weight. If you listened to him talking, you'd think it was the greatest achievement of his career.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers claimed Orson was surrounded by a dark aura and said it would not be healthy for him to be close to Orson. He was incredibly superstitious. He was obsessed with horoscopes, tarot cards and colours.\n\nPeter Sellers: Green has been a superstition of mine for a long time. And purple. Vittorio De Sica told me, \"My dear Peter, purple is the colour of death.\" And certain shades of green. The hard, acidy green is bad. I pick up strange vibrations from it. It disturbs me.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: Sellers was completely obsessed with royalty. He was always going on about Princess Margaret. His biggest thrill was to present people to her.\n\nOrson Welles: The fact that Princess Margaret was stopping by every day at my house was unknown to Sellers. One day she came to the set to have lunch with Peter, or so he claimed. He couldn't wait to tell the cast and crew who he was dining with. Then she walked past him and said, \"Hello, Orson, I haven't seen you for days!\" That was the real end. That's when we couldn't speak lines to each other. \"Orson, I haven't seen you for days!\" absolutely killed him. He went white as a sheet, because he was going to present me!\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter and I had a fist fight in his caravan. He threw a punch and I hit him back. We got separated by Gerry Crampton, the stunt coordinator. \"I love you both. I don't know who to thump first,\" Gerry said. Sellers and I started laughing and crying, but I said, \"There's no point going on, because somebody's going to hit somebody again.\" And he did.\n\nPeter Sellers: If I find myself surrounded by stupid people, I get rid of them.\n\nJoseph McGrath: After I was fired - at Peter's request - Sellers phoned and said, \"Come back! Feldman's going to give you a Rolls Royce.\" I said, \"I don't want one.\" Two years later, I was in LA and Jerry Bressler, who got a credit on Casino Royale as an executive producer, pulled up in a white Coriniche. \"Are you Joe McGrath?\" he said. \"I'm driving your Rolls Royce!\"\n\nPeter Sellers: In the end, Peter did one of his celebrated walkouts.\n\nKen Hughes (director): Peter stated that he was not prepared to complete the movie. Casino Royale came to a ghastly halt. Charles Feldman was left with a few scenes shot with Sellers but no movie. He had to consider closing down. But big money was involved and he decided to go ahead.\n\nJoseph McGrath: It's hard to finish a film when you lose your star.\n\nKen Hughes: At a panic script meeting, it was decided that since they no longer had Sellers, they'd have to improvise. The writers were working like crazy trying to save the day. Feldman hired everyone in sight: Woody Allen, David Niven, John Huston. It was total chaos. Units were shooting in three studios. I was shooting at Shepperton, another unit was shooting at MGM. And none of us saw a completed script. I had to call the director at MGM to find out what he was shooting so I'd know how it dovetailed into what I was shooting.\n\nOrson Welles: At the end of it, Charlie Feldman hired John Huston to direct and John moved everybody to Ireland because he wanted to go fox hunting.\n\nKen Hughes: The end result speaks for itself - a mish-mash that came into being because the star had walked out.\n\nWolf Mankowitz: The film doesn't make any sense. Because of Sellers it was cut, re-cut, screwed around with a thousand different ways.\n\nJoseph McGrath: Peter told me years later, \"I don't have a lot of friends, but I can trust you. Because we've been through hell together. You've actually faced me and thrown a punch at me. I know you won't put up with any shit.\n\nPeter Sellers: I am not a funny man. I don't have a strong comedy personality. But even without that, you can be successful if the material is funny.\n\nWoody Allen: I never bothered to see Casino Royale. I knew it would be horrible. The set was a madhouse. I knew then that the only way to make a film is to control it completely.\n\nPeter Sellers: The making of that film would make an interesting film in itself.\n\nThe Stakes Behind The James Bond Rights Auction\n\nAs Warner Bros And Others Try To Win 007’s Loyalties\n\nFrom Sony\n\nhttps://deadline.com/2015/10/daniel-craig-james-bond-sony-warner-bros-mgm-daniel-craig-1201528241/\n\nBy Anita Busch, Mike Fleming Jr | October 30, 2015 8:10am\n\nAsk anyone in the hunt for the next batch of James Bond films that are now up for grabs, and this is what you’ll hear, as voiced by one exec whose studio is among those in the chase: “They might not say they’re actively shopping it, but they are certainly making it known their deal is up and they will be.”\n\nThe James Bond distribution deal with Sony is done after Spectre bows in the U.S. on November 6. It could stay at Sony or it could head to Warner Bros., or Fox (which handles MGM’s home video), or Universal, and Paramount. Or even Disney, where Bob Iger has shown the wisdom of making big bets can work out in buying out whole companies like Marvel and Lucasfilm for cash and stock.\n\nAt a time when studios are hungrier than ever for proven global franchises, James Bond is Hollywood’s longest-running success story. Consider that 50 years after Sean Connery launched the character in 1962’s Dr No, 007’s last outing Skyfall became the series’ biggest grossing film, topping out at $1.1 billion globally. With Daniel Craig and that film’s director Sam Mendes a week away from the U.S. launch of what might be their last Bond film together, there is every expectation that Spectre will chase that high-water gross mark. It already opened briskly overseas.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that a hit-starved studio like Warner Bros, or any other major, would covet the franchise. Indeed, sources sighted Warner Bros chief Kevin Tsujihara at the Montage Hotel recently with Gary Barber, the point person at MGM whose job it is to figure out the distribution future of 007 for MGM and Danjaq producers Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. According to our source, the chatter seemed more intense than a meet and greet. It looked like they were throwing around numbers. Not surprisingly, Warner Bros has been oft mentioned as the most aggressive in this hunt.\n\nWhat’s odd about this is that nobody is saying that Sony hasn’t done a fine job in marketing and releasing the Bond films. But the last deal was made by Amy Pascal, and she is no longer in charge. The new guy in the seat, Tom Rothman, is known from his days running Fox as a tough, bottom-line-minded executive who most feel would walk away from a deal that gave the studio market share at the expense of profit. Indeed, some say that at Pascal’s urging, Sony gave up too much the last time around to keep 007 in the fold.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal rifled through those hacked Sony documents and pried out a memo that underscores the troubling risk-reward disparity. According to WSJ, co-financing and marketing and releasing Skyfall brought Sony $57 million on a film that grossed $1.1 billion globally. MGM, in turn, made $175 million, while Danjaq made $109 million. And that doesn’t factor in all the other things Sony gave up and the movies like the 21 Jump Street franchise that MGM was kissed into when the last re-up deal was made. Some would consider the math on this to be on par with the old first-dollar gross deal scenarios which became toxic to studios when owners like Sumner Redstone realized that a star like Tom Cruise had earned way more than $50 million on a Mission: Impossible movie through first-dollar gross participation before Paramount — which financed the whole film –had even recouped its outlay. His generous portion on video pushed that payday to an estimated $80 million.\n\nSo much is up in the air right now on 007. First off, the odds are against Craig and Mendes returning for another go, which would mean starting again with a new actor even though reports indicate Craig might owe one more film to fulfill his contract. When Craig recently observed that he would rather “slash his wrists” than do another Bond movie, it certainly echoed loudly around Hollywood, even if those close to him attributed it mostly to the bad idea of putting Craig in front of a journalist right after he completed a time-press and arduous Spectre shoot in which he seriously injured his knee. It would be similar, they said, to asking a woman just out of childbirth how eager she was to have another.\n\nHere’s what we hear. 007 rights gatekeepers Barber, and Wilson and Broccoli, will wait until Spectre plays around the world and accumulates an ungodly global gross that will only strengthen their leverage. And then, early next year, they will make the best deal. If that means bidding farewell to Sony, so be it.\n\nSony had initially gotten rights to Casino Royale years ago in a deal orchestrated deftly behind the scenes by former Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO John Calley, who revived James Bond while head of United Artists. Because of that, Sony released Casino Royale with a new Bond — Craig — and grossed about $600M worldwide.\n\nWhen it came time to re-up, Pascal was running the studio and people are still debating whether her zeal to keep Bond led Sony to give up too much. On the plus side, Pascal was invited to have a creative voice in the process over the last few films. Sony co-financed movies that were big hits, and received a distribution fee that some say was capped.\n\nBut it was the other concessions granted by Sony that still has tongues wagging. Sony offered up some of its plum projects to be co-financed by MGM. At the time, the sexiest one the studio had was The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. That film, which starred Craig, went into the pot and while the movie didn’t come close to meeting everyone’s out-sized expectations, 21 Jump Street — another film offered up for co-financing — certainly did. MGM got to be part of that hit and its sequel and presumably will be part of the next film that is rumored to meld that series with Men In Black. Sony, in turn, got to co-finance and release some MGM films, including the Robocop remake. Sony is now gearing up for another Dragon Tattoo installment with The Girl In The Spider’s Web, the book written by David Lagercrantz, who was installed by the rights-holder relatives of the late author Stieg Larsson. Pascal is a producer on that movie, and MGM is expected to be in the mix if the studio wants to be.\n\nThe proceeds from these co-fi deals went into into a split pot, but the unsung coup for MGM was that it got to broker almost all of the international TV deals. That studio was still getting back on its feet after being frozen in a bankruptcy, and it’s believed they didn’t have the kind of clout to get as high a price as Sony would have. It also left Sony’s loyal global customers on the outside looking in because MGM was making the deals and had its own list of customers. The prospect of all that led to widespread internal disagreements within Sony divisions over whether the studio should make such a deal, but Pascal won the day.\n\nTwo blockbusters and Spectre later, and Pascal is now off producing movies. And the studio will have some serious decisions to make as it formulates how crucial it is to keep James Bond. Many believe that no studio will replicate the horse trading that took place in the last Sony 007 deal. It is an open question whether another studio will find some ground on which they can get the market share bragging rights that come with 007, while not feeling they made a loss leader deal.\n\nIf ever MGM was going to get back into the distribution business — it disbanded distribution when it emerged from bankruptcy and has placed big movies like the Ben-Hur and The Magnificent Seven remakes all over town — the 007 franchise would be the one to relaunch. That’s always an option, but more of a long shot than the notion of Craig returning to His Majesty’s Secret Service.\n\nThe betting here is that if Sony’s brain trust led by Michael Lynton and Rothman won’t do it, another big studio like Warner Bros — which successfully partnered with MGM on the billion-dollar The Hobbit trilogy — will swallow hard and make the deal. Tsujihara and Barber are tight, and you can bet that Warner Bros will move heaven and earth to make a hit out of MGM’s upcoming Rocky film Creed, the Ryan Coogler-directed film that opens Thanksgiving with Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan starring. Is it too much to imagine that soon, the most important entries on Tsujihara’s call sheet will be Barber, along with Harry Potter author JK Rowling and James Packer?\n\nAlbert Finney, 82, ‘Angry Young Man’ Who\n\nBecame a Hollywood Star, Is\n\nDead\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/movies/albert-finney-dead.html\n\nBy Alan Cowell | Feb. 8, 2019\n\nAlbert Finney during the filming of the 1981 crime drama\n\n“Loophole.” He was one of his generation’s finest and most\n\nhonored actors over six decades.CreditCredit\n\nEvening Standard/Hulton Archive, via Getty Images\n\nLONDON — Albert Finney, the British stage and film actor who defined an era’s rage and frustration in dramas of blue-collar realism and social revolt and went on to find stardom in Hollywood, died on Thursday in London. He was 82.\n\nHis death, at the Royal Marsden Hospital, was confirmed by Jon Oakley, a partner at Simkins, a law firm that represents the Finney family. The cause was a chest infection, he said.\n\nMr. Finney became one of his generation’s finest and most honored actors over six decades. A frequent nominee for an Oscar and Britain’s equivalent of one, the Bafta, he was a star as comfortable in movies like “Tom Jones,” “Murder on the Orient Express,” “Under the Volcano” and “Erin Brockovich” as he was on the classical British stage.\n\nHe first came to wide attention alongside contemporaries like Alan Bates and Tom Courtenay, actors collectively known as “angry young men” — counterparts to the playwrights and novelists who shared that sobriquet. Together they helped turn Britain’s gaze inward, toward gritty industrial landscapes, where a generation of disaffected youth railed against the class system and the claustrophobic trap it laid for workers locked in dead-end jobs.\n\nMr. Finney was propelled to early stardom by “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,” a low-budget 1960 film steeped in smoggy vistas of smokestacks and deprivation and shot in stark black and white. Mr. Finney played Arthur Seaton, a restless young man caught in sexual adventures and bouts of beer drinking intended to distract him from his job at a cavernous bicycle factory.\n\nHis broad-voweled northern accent injected a powerful authenticity into the part, and his acting style drew favorable comparisons to such titans of the English stage as Laurence Olivier. Yet he preferred wealth to accolades, according to his biographer, Quentin Falk.\n\n“At the turn of the ’60s, Finney was the screen’s incarnation of the new working-class hero,” Mr. Falk wrote in “Albert Finney in Character,” published in 1992 and republished in 2015. “In the theater, he was barely 20 when he was hailed as the ‘new Olivier.’ Yet instead of pursuing either mantle, he became a millionaire and made love to beautiful women on several continents.”\n\nMr. Falk added: “To some he is still the leading actor of his generation; to others, though, he has suffered an ambition bypass. To even severer critics, he appears to have remained cheerfully indolent, almost willfully failing to fulfill the remarkable early promise.”\n\nMr. Finney, as the title character, with Diane Cilento in “Tom Jones,” Tony Richardson’s\n\n1963 adaptation of the Henry Fielding novel. The performance brought Mr. Finney the\n\nfirst of his five Academy Award nominations.\n\nCredit Lopert Pictures Corporation/Photofest\n\nThe angry young men “were indignant because little seemed to be changing in postwar Britain,” the critic and essayist Nora Sayre wrote in The New York Times in 2000. “They thought there were few opportunities for the young.”\n\nTheir characters grew from the work of novelists like Alan Sillitoe (who adapted his novel in writing the script of “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning”), John Braine and David Storey, and the playwright John Osborne, whose “Look Back in Anger” set the parameters for what became known as kitchen-sink dramas in the late 1950s and ’60s.\n\n“Stocky and obdurate, Mr. Finney spits with aggression, walks with impatience and indicates that laws exist to be broken,” Ms. Sayre wrote. “His morose, craggy face looks as though it has been pummeled by experience.”\n\nThe angry young men were a prelude to the explosion of creativity and license that characterized the so-called Swinging Sixties, when the songs of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and other bands were anthems to a new permissiveness that changed British society.\n\nMr. Finney went on to play an eclectic array of movie roles, from the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot in Sidney Lumet’s star-studded version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” in 1975, to the pugnacious lawyer Edward L. Masry, who hires the crusading title character (Julia Roberts) in “Erin Brockovich” (2000), Steven Soderbergh’s tale of a power-company pollution scandal.\n\nBut in 2007 Mr. Finney dropped out of sight, disclosing only in 2011 that he had been struggling for four years with cancer. After his return to acting, he took small parts in the thriller “The Bourne Legacy” and the James Bond movie “Skyfall,” both in 2012.\n\n“The pattern of my life is that there is no pattern,” Mr. Finney once said. “In work I like doing things that are different, contrasting. I’m lurching rather than pointing in any given direction.”\n\nAn episode in 1960 seemed to confirm that self-assessment. Mr. Finney had a long screen test for the lead role in David Lean’s epic movie “Lawrence of Arabia,” but, according to Mr. Falk, he rejected a lucrative five-year contract with the film’s producer, Sam Spiegel, saying, “I didn’t know where I want to be in five years’ time — or tomorrow for that matter.”\n\nThe role, of the adventurer T. E. Lawrence, went to Peter O’Toole and turned him into an international star.\n\nMr. Finney, center, in his Oscar-nominated performance as the Belgian detective\n\nHercule Poirot in “Murder on the Orient Express” (1974), directed by Sidney Lumet.\n\nCredit Paramount Pictures\n\nMr. Finney was nominated five times for an Oscar, four for best actor: as the title character in “Tom Jones,” Tony Richardson’s 1963 adaptation of the Henry Fielding novel; as Poirot in “Murder on the Orient Express”; as an aging, embittered actor in Peter Yates’s 1983 version of “The Dresser”; and as an alcoholic British consul in a small town in Mexico in John Huston’s “Under the Volcano,” based on the Malcolm Lowry novel. His performance in “Erin Brockovich” earned him a supporting actor nomination.\n\nHe was also nominated 13 times for a Bafta and won twice — as “most promising newcomer” in 1960 and, in 2002, for his performance as Winston Churchill in “The Gathering Storm,” a BBC-HBO television movie that also brought him an Emmy.\n\nHe never won an Oscar, however, and made a point of not attending the glittering award ceremonies.\n\n“It’s a very long evening and not exactly my idea of a good night out,” Mr. Falk quoted him as saying — “sat there for five hours in a nonsmoking, nondrinking environment.”\n\nDuring the Oscar ceremony in 1963, Mr. Finney was cruising aboard a luxurious catamaran off Hawaii while a news crew, surrounded by a throng of onlookers, awaited his return to port in case he won the award for his role in “Tom Jones.”\n\nFrom an upper deck, Mr. Finney had a clear view onto the approaching quay side. “Suddenly,” Mr. Falk wrote, “Finney saw a man pushing his way through the crowd, shouting: ‘Wrap it up. He didn’t win.’ Sidney Poitier had.” (Mr. Poitier won for “Lilies of the Field.”)\n\nBy the time the catamaran docked, the news crew and its equipment had disappeared.\n\nMr. Finney’s aversion to such accolades extended even to Britain’s own system of medals, knighthoods and peerages. In 2000, he turned down an opportunity to become Sir Albert Finney, echoing an earlier rejection of a lesser award. He said the honors system was a way of “perpetuating snobbery.”\n\nAlbert Finney was born on May 9, 1936, in Salford, near Manchester in northwest England, the third child and first son of Alice Hobson, who left school at age 14 to work in a mill, and Albert Finney Sr., who made his living running bets on horse racing.\n\nThe family lived at first in a rowhouse — the familiar cramped accommodation of the working classes in a region where the Industrial Revolution had spread a patina of grime, grit and pollution over back-to-back homes separated by cobbled alleyways and streets. Overshadowed by the nearby northern metropolis of Manchester, Salford was known as a factory town and inland port, and its docklands became a target for German bombers during World War II.\n\nIn 1941, when Mr. Finney was 5 years old, the family was bombed out of its rowhouse and moved to a more genteel home across town.\n\nMr. Finney with Julia Roberts in “Erin Brockovich,” Steven Soderbergh’s 2000 tale of a\n\npower company pollution scandal.

CreditBob Marshak/Universal Studios\n\n“Though Finney himself would later come to personify the working-class hero in several of his earliest roles,” Mr. Falk wrote, the move to a new area “confirmed a strictly lower-middle-class status for a family who were never really less than comfortably off.”\n\nAs a high school student at Salford Grammar School, Mr. Finney displayed both a liking for the theater and a poor grasp of academic subjects. A teacher suggested that he apply to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art — Britain’s premier acting school, usually known as RADA — where he auditioned in 1953 and won a scholarship.\n\nBy 20, he had completed his course at RADA and was playing parts in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” at a repertory theater in Birmingham, in the English Midlands. He went on to play Henry V in the play of the same name — one of many Shakespearean roles that established his reputation on the stage.\n\nBesides Shakespeare, he had leading roles in plays by Anton Chekhov, Samuel Beckett, August Strindberg and John Osborne.\n\nMr. Finney met Jane Wenham, a fellow actor, in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1957. The couple married and had a son, Simon, who became a film technician. They divorced in 1961. Mr. Finney married the French actress Anouk Aimée in 1970. They divorced in 1978. He married Pene Delmage, a travel specialist, in 2006.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, his son and two grandchildren.\n\nThe low-budget “Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,” filmed on location in Nottingham and at Twickenham Studios, was Mr. Finney’s big break. Three years later, the critical and box-office success of “Tom Jones,” which won three Oscars including best picture, made him a millionaire at the age of 27. He took a 10-month break to travel the world for much of 1964.\n\nAs Mr. Finney’s career unfolded, movies overlapped with stage plays. He appeared in the musical films “Scrooge” in 1970 and “Annie” in 1982, for which he shaved his head to play Daddy Warbucks. He made his American television debut in the role of Pope John Paul II in 1984.\n\n“I often wondered why I am an actor,” Mr. Finney told a television interviewer in 1962. He then seemed to answer the question, speaking of the profession as a very public form of escape.\n\n“I think I am always watching and balancing, and sort of tabulating my own emotions,” he said. “And the only way I can lose myself is when I’m acting.”\n\nTim Pigott-Smith obituary\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/09/tim-pigott-smith-obituary\n\nStage and screen actor best known for his role in the TV series The Jewel in the Crown\n\nMichael Coveney | Sun 9 Apr 2017 13.34 EDT\n\nLast modified on Tue 19 Dec 2017 15.56 EST\n\nTim Pigott-Smith as Ronald Merrick, with Siddharth Kak (right), in The Jewel in the Crown, Granada TV’s adaptation of Paul Scott’s Raj Quartet novels. Photograph: ITV/Rex\n\nThe only unexpected thing about the wonderful actor Tim Pigott-Smith, who has died aged 70, was that he never played Iago or, indeed, Richard III. Having marked out a special line in sadistic villainy as Ronald Merrick in his career-defining, Bafta award-winning performance in The Jewel in the Crown (1984), Granada TV’s adaptation for ITV of Paul Scott’s Raj Quartet novels, he built a portfolio of characters both good and bad who were invariably presented with layers of technical accomplishment and emotional complexity.\n\nTim Pigott-Smith in the title role of\n\nMike Bartlett’s King Charles III at the\n\nAlmeida theatre in 2014. Photograph:\n\nTristram Kenton for the Guardian\n\nHe emerged as a genuine leading actor in Shakespeare, contemporary plays by Michael Frayn – in Frayn’s Benefactors (1984) he was a malicious, Iago-like journalist undermining a neighbouring college chum’s ambitions as an architect – and Stephen Poliakoff, American classics by Eugene O’Neill and Edward Albee, and as a go-to screen embodiment of high-ranking police officers and politicians, usually served with a twist of lemon and a side order of menace and sarcasm.\n\nHe played a highly respectable King Lear at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2011, but that performance was eclipsed, three years later, by his subtle, affecting and principled turn in the title role of Mike Bartlett’s King Charles III (soon to be seen in a television version) at the Almeida, in the West End and on Broadway, for which he received nominations in both the Olivier and Tony awards. The play, written in Shakespearean iambics, was set in a futuristic limbo, before the coronation, when Charles refuses to grant his royal assent to a Labour prime minister’s press regulation bill.\n\nThe interregnum cliffhanger quality to the show was ideal for Pigott-Smith’s ability to simultaneously project the spine and the jelly of a character, and he brilliantly suggested an accurate portrait of the future king without cheapening his portrayal of him. Although not primarily a physical actor, like Laurence Olivier, he was aware of his attributes, once saying that the camera “does something to my eyes, particularly on my left side in profile”, something to do with the eye being quite low and “being able to see some white underneath the pupil”. It was this physical accident, not necessarily any skill, he modestly maintained, which gave him a menacing look on film and television, “as if I am thinking more than one thing”.\n\nTim Pigott-Smith: a man born to play kings\n\nBorn in Rugby, Tim was the only child of Harry Pigott-Smith, a journalist, and his wife Margaret (nee Goodman), a keen amateur actor, and was educated at Wyggeston boys’ school in Leicester and – when his father was appointed to the editorship of the Herald in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1962 – King Edward VI grammar school, where Shakespeare was a pupil. Attending the Royal Shakespeare theatre, he was transfixed by John Barton and Peter Hall’s Wars of the Roses production, and the actors: Peggy Ashcroft, with whom he would one day appear in The Jewel in the Crown, Ian Holm and David Warner. He took a part‑time job in the RSC’s paint shop.\n\nAt Bristol University he gained a degree in English, French and drama (1967), and at the Bristol Old Vic theatre school he graduated from the training course (1969) alongside Jeremy Irons and Christopher Biggins as acting stage managers in the Bristol Old Vic company. He joined the Prospect touring company as Balthazar in Much Ado with John Neville and Sylvia Syms and then as the Player King and, later, Laertes to Ian McKellen’s febrile Hamlet. Back with the RSC he played Posthumus in Barton’s fine 1974 production of Cymbeline and Dr Watson in William Gillette’s Sherlock Holmes, opposite John Wood’s definitive detective, at the Aldwych and on Broadway. He further established himself in repertory at Birmingham, Cambridge and Nottingham.\n\nTim Pigott-Smith as the avuncular businessman Ken Lay in Lucy Prebble’s Enron at the Minerva theatre, Chichester, in 2009. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian\n\nHe was busy in television from 1970, appearing in two Doctor Who sagas, The Claws of Axos (1971) and The Masque of Mandragora (1976), as well as in the first of the BBC’s adaptations of Elizabeth Gaskell’s North and South (1975, as Frederick Hale; in the second, in 2004, he played Hale’s father, Richard). His first films were Jack Gold’s Aces High (1976), adapted by Howard Barker from RC Sherriff’s Journey’s End, and Tony Richardson’s Joseph Andrews (1977). His first Shakespeare leads were in the BBC’s Shakespeare series – Angelo in Measure for Measure and Hotspur in Henry IV Part One (both 1979).\n\nA long association with Hall began at the National Theatre in 1987, when he played a coruscating half-hour interrogation scene with Maggie Smith in Hall’s production of Coming in to Land by Poliakoff; he was a Dostoeyvskyan immigration officer, Smith a desperate, and despairing, Polish immigrant. In Hall’s farewell season of Shakespeare’s late romances in 1988, he led the company alongside Michael Bryant and Eileen Atkins, playing a clenched and possessed Leontes in The Winter’s Tale; an Italianate, jesting Iachimo in Cymbeline; and a gloriously drunken Trinculo in The Tempest (he played Prospero for Adrian Noble at the Theatre Royal, Bath, in 2012).\n\nTim Pigott-Smith: how Ian McKellen made me raise my acting game\n\nThe Falstaff on television when he played Hotspur was Anthony Quayle, and he succeeded this great actor, whom he much admired as director of the touring Compass Theatre in 1989, playing Brutus in Julius Caesar and Salieri in Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus. When the Arts Council cut funding to Compass, he extended his rogue’s gallery with a sulphurous Rochester in Fay Weldon’s adaptation of Jane Eyre, on tour and at the Playhouse, in a phantasmagorical production by Helena Kaut-Howson, with Alexandra Mathie as Jane (1993); and, back at the NT, as a magnificent, treacherous Leicester in Howard Davies’ remarkable revival of Schiller’s Mary Stuart (1996) with Isabelle Huppert as a sensual Mary and Anna Massey a bitterly prim Elizabeth.\n\nIn that same National season, he teamed with Simon Callow (as Face) and Josie Lawrence (as Doll Common) in a co-production by Bill Alexander for the Birmingham Rep of Ben Jonson’s trickstering, two-faced masterpiece The Alchemist; he was a comically pious Subtle in sackcloth and sandals. He pulled himself together as a wryly observant Larry Slade in one of the landmark productions of the past 20 years: O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh at the Almeida in 1998, transferring to the Old Vic, and to Broadway, with Kevin Spacey as the salesman Hickey revisiting the last chance saloon where Pigott-Smith propped up the bar with Rupert Graves, Mark Strong and Clarke Peters in Davies’ great production.\n\nHe and Davies combined again, with Helen Mirren and Eve Best, in a monumental NT revival (designed by Bob Crowley) of O’Neill’s epic Mourning Becomes Electra in 2003. Pigott-Smith recycled his ersatz “Agamemnon” role of the returning civil war hero, Ezra Mannon, as the real Agamemnon, fiercely sarcastic while measuring a dollop of decency against weasel expediency, in Euripides’ Hecuba at the Donmar Warehouse in 2004. In complete contrast, his controlled but hilarious Bishop of Lax in Douglas Hodge’s 2006 revival of Philip King’s See How They Run at the Duchess suggested he had done far too little outright comedy in his career.\n\nTim Pigott-Smith as King Lear at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2011.

Boyer | Times Staff Writer |\n\nMay 17, 1990 | 12:00 AM\n\nAltovise and Sammy Davis Jr. in 1972\n\nSammy Davis Jr., the quintessential showman embraced by his peers as \"Mr. Entertainment\" for his enormous talent and versatility, died early Wednesday morning at his home in Beverly Hills after a nine-month battle with throat cancer.\n\nDeath came as friends and fans of the diminutive, 64-year-old entertainer maintained a vigil outside his home. They had been gathering there since Tuesday when word began to circulate that the end was near.\n\nThe tributes were immediate:\n\nFrank Sinatra, who with Davis, Joey Bishop, Dean Martin and Peter Lawford became Hollywood's fast-living \"Rat Pack\" of the 1960s and who knew him for 40 years, said he \"wished the world could have known Sam as I did. . . . It was a generous God who gave him to us for all these years . . . . Sam was the best friend a man could have.\"\n\nSaid Bishop: \"Guess they must need a good show up in Heaven, that's all I can say.\" Then he added, \"God I'm sorry. I loved him.\"\n\nMartin hailed Davis as a great entertainer and \"an even greater friend, not only to me, but to everyone whose life he touched.\"\n\nFormer President Ronald Reagan remembered him as \"a special talent which made him more than just a great entertainer--it made him magical.\" Comedian Bill Cosby said that \"it would have been fantastic to see him at age 82 still enjoying performing for the people. I'll see him later.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley—who counted Davis among his friends and political supporters—ordered the city's flags flown at half staff.\n\nDavis had battled the cancer in his throat since September, when a tumor was discovered growing behind his vocal cords. He began a series of radiation treatments that left his skin discolored and raw enough to bleed when he touched his throat.\n\nWhen his illness became known, fans around the world deluged him with letters letting him know that he was in their prayers.\n\nShow business friends from Sinatra and Cosby to Liza Minnelli and Steve Lawrence rallied to his side, putting themselves at his disposal. A month before the cancer was detected, Davis, Sinatra and Minnelli (filling in for an ailing Dean Martin) had been on a reunion tour, bringing sellout audiences to their feet.\n\nHis friends' affection for the man who enjoyed describing himself as a \"little one-eyed colored guy\" was nowhere more evident than during a television tribute earlier this year, commemorating his more than six decades in show business.\n\nSaid singer Whitney Houston, a guest on the televised tribute taped last year: \"He helped to break down the color barriers. I think he fought the battle for the rest of us.\"\n\nDavis would have been the first to acknowledge that he was but one soldier among generations of troops who assaulted color barriers. Nonetheless, he determinedly fought his battles with whatever weapons were available, including one that he felt the haters could not withstand—his talent.\n\nWhether dancing with his father and uncle on countless television guest spots, captivating movie audiences as Sportin' Life in \"Porgy and Bess,\" singing his way through \"Mr. Wonderful\" on Broadway, or finding a hit song and a theme in \"Candy Man,\" Davis brought an exuberance to every performance.\n\nHis versatility was such that he could go on a bare stage alone and weave a stunning evening of entertainment with song, dance, impressions and comedy.\n\n\"This is what I want on my tombstone,\" he once told an interviewer:\n\n\"Sammy Davis Jr., the date, and underneath, one word: 'Entertainer.' That's all, because that's what I am, man.\"\n\nBehind Davis' superb stagecraft, however, and despite the adoration of faithful fans, Davis was for much of his life a man at war with himself.\n\nHe buried his pain in alcohol and cocaine—chasing the delusion that his \"swinging\" lifestyle somehow compensated for his two divorces, his estrangement from his children, and his futile efforts to become what he thought others expected him to be.\n\n\"I didn't like me,\" Davis told an interviewer in 1989. \"So it made all the sense in the world to me at the time that if you don't like yourself, you destroy yourself.\n\n\"The monkey on my back is that I created a lifestyle that was no good for me. My life was empty. I had drugs, booze and broads, and I had nothing.\"\n\nHe had to fight his way through what he has called \"the tortures of the damned,\" and he credited Altovise, his wife of 20 years, with helping him make a turnaround.\n\n\"She was there for me,\" he said. \"She gave me all the support in the world.\"\n\nThe turnaround began when doctors told him in 1983 that his stomach and liver were so damaged that he would die soon if he didn't stop drinking. He stopped. In 1984 and 1985, he underwent hip replacement surgery.\n\nBut he returned to dance again and charmed movie fans as Little Mo, the veteran hoofer with still enough moves to accept a \"challenge\" dance, in the 1989 film \"Tap.\"\n\nThe drinking was only one of his excesses. He spent money just as easily.\n\nDuring his illustrious career, he had earned millions and spent or given away more. And by the 1980s, the Internal Revenue Service was clamoring for unpaid millions in taxes it said he owed.\n\nDavis also shamelessly gushed over every guest on his television shows. And his ostentation became a trademark. If one gold ring was good, four had to be better.\n\nTry as he might to win love with his talent, his public persona had become an easy target--grist for a devastating (and, he said, all too accurate) impersonation by comedian Billy Crystal.\n\nBut if his excesses were obnoxious to some, Davis, the individual, was a monument to generosity for others. He marched for civil rights in Selma, Ala., played benefits for Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH, and helped raise funds to investigate the Atlanta child murders.\n\nBenjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, remembered him Wednesday as \"a humanitarian whose heart was so big . . . that it dwarfed his frame.\"\n\nHooks, in a statement, called attention to Davis' accomplishments \"in the struggle of African-Americans,\" much of which \"was not widely known . . . .\"\n\nCoretta Scott King called him \"not only one of the greatest performing artists of our age\" but \"an ardent, tireless supporter of Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement . . . .\"\n\nDavis would break into his schedule to play a benefit for a blind ex-fighter or sell bonds for Israel. Even as his bank account slid toward empty, he was contributing thousands of dollars to his child's school.\n\nThis consummate entertainer whose career has been described as a series of radical mood swings was born Dec. 8, 1925, in Harlem, N.Y., where his father was lead dancer and his mother, Elvera (Sanchez) Davis, was in the chorus of a vaudeville troupe headed by his adopted uncle, Will Mastin.\n\nWhen the act went on the road, Davis remained with his paternal grandmother, Rosa (Mama) Davis, who raised him until his parents divorced. His father took custody, and by age 3 a mugging little Sammy had made his stage debut.\n\nHe learned to dance by watching routines from the wings, and the rhythms from his flashing feet soon became a popular addition to the act. He made his film debut in 1933, at age 7, in \"Rufus Jones for President,\" a comedy in which a boy dreams he is elected President.\n\nDavis never attended school. His father and Mastin hired tutors—especially when truant officers applied pressure—to teach the youngster the three Rs. That irregular instruction and Davis' later friendship with a U.S. Army sergeant who loaned him books and taught him remedial reading was as close as he came to formal education.\n\nMastin's troupe, which had included 12 members, began to shrink with the decline of vaudeville and eventually was reduced to \"The Will Mastin Trio, Featuring Sammy Davis Jr.\"\n\nTouring in the 1930s and '40s, the trio often could not find hotels that would rent rooms to blacks or restaurants that would serve them. But it was not until Davis was drafted into the Army's first integrated unit at age 18 that he ran into the naked racism never far beneath the surface of World War II America.\n\nDuring basic training in Wyoming, he was beaten, kicked and spat upon by bigoted whites in his barracks. Describing those days in his best-selling 1965 biography, Yes, I Can, Davis said his knuckles were covered with scabs from fighting racists during his first three months in the Army.\n\nPerhaps the ugliest incident occurred when a group of white enlistees decided to teach him a lesson for being too familiar with a white female officer.\n\nDavis said they lured him to a remote spot on the base, where they beat him and painted racial slurs on his chest and forehead. They forced him to tap dance and smeared more white paint over his body, only to remove a spot to demonstrate that beneath the paint he was still \"just as black 'n' ugly as ever.\"\n\nThe pain of that incident motivated him to pump even more energy into his performances at camp shows. He felt that his sheer talent could reach the haters, \"neutralize them,\" force them to recognize him as a person.\n\nHe used an audience's affection as fuel, and he made no secret of his \"joy of being liked.\" And he would work himself to exhaustion to please an audience, friends said, in a futile effort to make the world love him--to erase the brutal memories of his Army experiences.\n\nDavis rejoined his father and uncle after the war, but the trio led a hand-to-mouth existence as vaudeville died and they tried breaking into nightclubs. They worked hotels in Las Vegas, where they could neither register as guests nor enter the casinos because they were black.\n\nSome New York City clubs would not allow him to enter, and he needed a special permit just to be on the streets of Miami Beach at night when he performed there.\n\nBut Davis continued to increase his repertoire—adding trumpet, drums, celebrity impressions—as the trio crisscrossed the country, taking whatever dates they could find.\n\nIn 1946, Metronome magazine named him \"Most Outstanding New Personality\" on the strength of his Capitol recording of \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" the magazine's selection as record of the year. Davis recorded it under a deal paying him $50 a side for each recording.\n\nDuring the next two years, the trio appeared with headliners such as Mickey Rooney, Sinatra and Bob Hope. Jack Benny later intervened to get them a booking at Ciro's nightclub in Hollywood where they opened for singer Janis Paige. The audience would not let them off—or Paige on—stage. The next night, Paige was the opening act for the Will Mastin Trio.\n\nThe group's later appearance on Eddie Cantor's NBC television show was such a hit that they became the comedian's summer replacement.\n\nBy 1954, when Davis released his first album under a contract to Decca Records, his father and Mastin had become background accompaniment to his soaring performances.\n\nWith Davis as its centerpiece, the trio sold out clubs from Los Angeles to New York, and the group was in constant demand for guest spots on television variety shows.\n\nDavis' on-target impersonations of Jimmy Cagney, Jerry Lewis and Jimmy Stewart were a revelation to audiences who simply had never imagined a black performer being able to so accurately capture a white celebrity's character.\n\nBut it all nearly ended in November, 1954, in a car crash on a stretch of highway between Las Vegas and Los Angeles that cost him his left eye. During his recuperation at a San Bernardino hospital, he said, he began thinking seriously about religion and converted to Judaism.\n\nOnce out of the hospital, he was in even more demand. And contract offers began a steady march upward through five figures for a week's work. In 1956, he made his Broadway debut in \"Mr. Wonderful,\" a musical comedy created for him.\n\nBy the late 1950s, the Will Mastin Trio had broken up, but Davis continued dividing his income with his father and uncle for months—some friends say years.\n\nHe became a member of Hollywood's so-called \"Rat Pack\" and made six of his 23 movies with them, beginning with \"Ocean's Eleven\" in 1960 and ending with \"One More Time\" in 1970.\n\nAfter a brief marriage to dancer Loray White in 1959, Davis married Swedish actress May Britt in 1960. The couple had a daughter, Tracey, and adopted two sons, Mark and Jeff. The couple divorced in 1968, and two years later Davis married dancer Altovise Gore. They adopted a son, Manny, last year.\n\nDuring his marriage to Britt, his celebrity could not shield him from white anger and black consternation.\n\nDavis noted in an interview with Playboy magazine that his mother was Puerto Rican.\n\n\"So I'm Puerto Rican, Jewish, colored and married to a white woman,\" he said. \"When I move into a neighborhood, people start running four ways at the same time.\"\n\nHe was bitterly criticized in 1972, during the Republican National Convention in Miami, for hugging Richard M. Nixon. To many black Americans, the photo of that incident was eloquent testimony to what they saw as Davis' misplaced values.\n\nThat criticism, however, wasn't as painful as the rejection that came his way from John F. Kennedy, whose candidacy he had tirelessly supported.\n\nDavis had been invited to Kennedy's 1961 inauguration, but the invitation was rescinded a few days after it was offered because the Kennedy camp felt Davis and his white wife might anger Southerners.\n\n\"The guy I ran with is the man that told me, 'Don't come to the White House cause you'll embarrass me' because I was married to a white woman,\" Davis said in a 1987 interview. \"And I had to accept that. But that was the man I campaigned for, and went all out for. That was John Kennedy.\"\n\nBy now Davis was a fixture in the firmament of American stars. Before his \"Rat Pack\" movies, he had appeared in \"The Benny Goodman Story,\" co-starred with Eartha Kitt in \"Anna Lucasta\" and won rave notices as Sportin' Life in the film version of \"Porgy and Bess.\"\n\nHe returned to the stage in the mid-1960s in a musical adaptation of Clifford Odets' \"Golden Boy,\" a production that ran for 568 performances before closing in March, 1966.\n\nDavis, meanwhile, had remained busy in films, producing the forgettable \"A Man Called Adam\" with his own company in 1966. He also appeared as revivalist Big Daddy in \"Sweet Charity\" and performed in the 1972 documentary \"Save the Children.\"\n\nWhile moving between stage, television and movies, Davis also recorded dozens of albums and released several hit singles, including his all-time top-seller, \"Candy Man.\"\n\nHis was a familiar face in America's living rooms as he turned up on television in shows ranging from \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" to \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\" to the soap opera \"One Life to Live.\" He hosted several specials of his own, sat in for Johnny Carson and did the brief and ill-fated \"Sammy Davis Jr. Show\" on NBC from 1965 to 1966.\n\nHe was a smash hit in \"Sammy,\" a television retrospective of his first half-century in show business. But his second try at a network show, \"NBC Follies,\" was canceled midway through the 1973-74 season.\n\nLast year he published a second biography, Why Me?, co-written, as was his best-selling first book, with Jane and Burt Boyar. In interviews discussing the new book, he acknowledged that racial prejudice had profoundly affected him.\n\nHe poignantly told a story of a man coming to his table at a nightclub to greet him after he had become an international celebrity. The man was the very person who had refused him admission to the same club some years before.\n\nHe felt he should have told the man \"to get away from me with his hypocrisy.\" But he was silent.\n\n\"So I went home and threw up,\" he said. \"I had stifled my own feelings and made myself sick. That night I vowed: 'I'll never let that happen again.' \"\n\nHe said he began to fight the subtle prejudices he encountered, whether it was fellow board members of a company being surprised that he could do more than sing and dance, or making it clear to guests at a party that he could talk about more than what Carson or Sinatra are \"really like.\"\n\nStill, by his own admission, he had mellowed in the last five years.\n\nHe overcame what he called his obsession with his career even as he was being increasingly called upon to accept yet another honor for his body of work or for his commitment to various social and political causes.\n\n\"I've been looking inward,\" he said last year. \"I've been counting my blessings. I no longer feel I have to do it all. I don't yearn to be at the top of the mountain.\"\n\nDavis is survived by his wife, four children and two grandchildren. His mother and a sister also survive. Services are scheduled at 11 a.m. Friday at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Hollywood Hills. Burial will follow at Forest Lawn, Glendale.\n\nThe family suggested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Sammy Davis Jr. National Liver Institute at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark.\n\nTimes staff writer Eric Malnic contributed to this obituary.\n\nNote: most sources confirm his death ass on 18 may 2017."
