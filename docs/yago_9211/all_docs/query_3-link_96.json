        "text": "i '-6 -X i i a I $anta FeN.M., April 22, 1974 THE NEWMEXICAN A9 I double role a artist, too ft By GEORGE A. KRIMSKY Associated Press Writer NEW YORK AP) The informer glanced at his watch and tried to look casual as he peered over his newspaper in search of the cop who had promised to meet him at East River Pier No. 15. The only man in sight was a shaggyhaired artist sketching tugboats in the harbor. Looking for me, man? drawled the artist, without looking up from his sketch pad .\n\nYou Volpe? Yeah, Im Volpe, said the artist, savoring the others incredulity with a wide, crinkleeyed grin. Not an unusual approach for Detective 3rd Grade Robert R. Volpe, 31, who is not your usual policeman and not your usual artist. Babin pursuit of both, Volpe has managed to smudge the sharp line which ordinarily separates the worlds of enforcement and creativity. His job with the New York City Police Department is hunting down stolen art and the people who try to get away with it .\n\nIn the 18 months he has worked on the Art Identification Team, Volpe has helped recover more than $2 million worth of stolen art, collectors items and artifacts. He is the sole member of the team, which is the only known municipal police unit of its kind in the country. When off duty, Volpe likes to paint strong things with gentle strokes. If he can bear to part with the result, Volpe sells a painting for nearly as much as he earns from a month as a gumshoe. He has seen his works hang in one-man shows at prestigious New York galleries, and critics have given him their blessing .\n\nIs the cop an artist or the artist a cop? Detective Volpe will tell you within earshot of a department superior that hes an artist first and a cop second. I was born an artist. I had to learn to be a cop. Then catch that grin as Volpe discovers the Picasso print on his cluttered desk is a fake. He invites you to look through the magnifying glass at the dotted lines as in a newspaper photograph .\n\nIn my own way, I love this work, he says. Volpes way is original even among today's new breed of city policeman permissive, socially-conscious and hip. A 10-year veteran of the New York force, he has never been in uniform, and its hard to picture him in one. He never wears a watch because time doesnt mean anything to me. Weaned on undercover work, he meticulously retains the nonpolice look .\n\nPRACTICE RUN The popular crawfish races to determine the fastest crawdad in the Cajun Country are among the highlights of tne Breaux Bridge, festival to be held this year on May 4-5. Breaux Bridge, not far from Interstate 10, calls itself the Crawfish Capital of the World. UPI STATE OF NEW MEXICO COUNTY OF SANTA FE IN THE PROBATE COURT IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF CHARLES F.
