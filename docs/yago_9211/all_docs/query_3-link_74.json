The oldest section is the IOOF, which was the first original cemetery. I have included extractions from obituaries that I believe to be of genealogical value. Many thanks to Jim Hass of Hass Funeral Directors of Clayton, Union County, New Mexico. He was kind enough to submit a CD containing the following burial information. I have omitted the burial plot and space numbers in the interest of space. Other burial information was obtained from various newspapers.\n\nGail Brown Copyright 2001\n\nQUINLAN, Daniel Thaddeus b. 23 Mar 1865, Antioch, IL. d. 8 Feb 1943, Clayton, Union, NM; 77 yr 10 mo 16 da; struck by train; lived in Union Co., NM for 32 yr; was the youngest of 12 children.
