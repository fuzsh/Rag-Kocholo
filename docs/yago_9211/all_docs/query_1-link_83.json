        "text": "The Wild Bunch\n\n1969 // USA // Sam Peckinpah\n\nLetterboxd (LINK)\n\nWestern has always been my least favorite genre, and I don’t even like John Ford’s THE SERACHERS (1956). I guess the reason is I started my Western viewing from films by Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah‘s THE WILD BUNCH instead of the film’s from the mythical ‘good old west,’ and I couldn’t help but compare the rest with them. Occasionally I am won over by Ford and Hawks, but still, THE WILD BUNCH stands out the most. Ironically I have only watched it once nearly a decade ago and I really afraid a rewatch could ruin my favoritism on it. As the film is reaching the 50th anniversary this year, I have rewatched THE WILD BUNCH at last, and man it still holds up as much as, and even better than, I remembered.\n\nI’m overwhelmed by the saturation of violence onscreen, the two elaborated shootouts, or should I say massacre, bookend the film in a nice symmetry. Pike Bishop (William Holden), the leader of the ‘wild bunch,’ is first and foremost a ruthless bandit of whom killings need no remorse. When Pike’s gang, disguised in army uniform, robs a railroad office but is ambushed by Pike’s former partner Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan) and a posse of bounty hunters, all hell breaks loose, quite literally. Pedestrians are gunned down savagely, women are squashed by horses and children helplessly holding each other in dismay. One of the bandits is shot on the face, another one, a psychopathic one, is purposefully abandoned by Pike inside the railroad office as a diversion.\n\nMorality offers no protection for the defenseless, whilst violence offers no resolution but a dead end. This ‘wild’ world, transited from Texas to Mexico when Pike’s gang takes refuge in their Mexican member Angel’s (Jaime Sánchez) village, is a deadly game for the survivalist, and violence is merely the means. But this time around I asked if the violence is necessary. In a moralistic answer, no violence could be justified, but in THE WILD BUNCH, Sam Peckinpah conjures an unforgiving world that resembles closely to the real world we are living in where terrorist bombing and school shooting are shown in the daily news.\n\nUpon the rewatch this time, I’m surprised to find THE WILD BUNCH more a political film than a Western. The corrupted Mexican General Mapache (Emilio Fernández), the ultimate ‘villain’ in this film, collaborates with a German military adviser and has been ravaging the area’s villages. The year is 1913, the eve of World War I, Pike’s gang unwittingly gets tangled by the conflict between the General and the revolutionary Pancho Villa when a jealous Angel shoots his ex-fiancée Teresa dead as she voluntarily gets into Mapache‘s arms.\n\nPike’s gang could easily be the antagonist if the film’s perspective follows the vengeful Deke instead. A series of brief flashbacks show us the history between Deke and Pike and the reason why Deke laboriously hunts them down alongside an ‘incompetent bunch’ of bounty hunters. The film also tricks us into believing a final showdown between the two gangs but instead, the climactic shoot reverses the role of Pike’s gang into a heroic sacrifice driven by a sense of desolation. Pike and his remaining gang, including his right-hand man Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) and the two incendiary brothers Lyle (Warren Oates) and Tector Gorch (Ben Johnson), stormed into General Mapache‘s celebratory party in an attempt to trade a tortured Angel back.\n\nPike’s gang is formerly hired by Mapache to steal guns and ammunition from a U.S. Army train, a deal that is made to defuse the situation when Angel shot Teresa. Angel trades his share of gold for a box of weapons which is then given to the revolutionary for fighting against the tyrant, but Mapache finds out and Angel is caught. As all conventional narrative drama, THE WILD BUNCH relies on the ramification of every little decision the characters made, and most of the time they made the wrong one impulsively, ignorantly or unwittingly. Pike’s hubris causes the arrest of Deke, which eventually leads to the trap for Pike’s gang in the first act of the film whilst Mapache‘s viciousness and slyness dominate the second half.\n\nThere’s no code of honor amidst the Pike’s gang, the Gorch brothers even repeatedly taunt the old-timer Freddie Sykes (Edmond O’Brien) throughout the trip, and Pike apparently builds no friendship with the others except Dutch. What has driven them to save Angel when they all get their gold now? I believe it’s a sense of emptiness that eventually propels them away from tranquility. The realization of peace would only weaken their macho and perhaps only death could be their emancipation. Do they know it’s going to be a suicide mission? Probably not, but I think they always expect the worst. That’s the moment when bad guys turn into heroes.\n\nTHE WILD BUNCH embraces the extreme violence, and mild sexism as well. Paradoxically I don’t think the film desensitized the violence as it never evades from displaying the bloody aftermath. It glorifies the violence but at once condemns the men who impose it, the ‘bunch’ is all dead except the redeemed Deke and the harmless-looking old Freddie. The next generation, represented by the children intermittently seen throughout the film, has been shown with acceptance and even a practice of violence (during the infamous opening credits, a group of indigenous kids drops a scorpion into an anthill, letting the ants devour the scorpion). In my opinion, Peckinpah asserts that violence is in our blood, passing along the lineage, it’s nihilistic, that’s why I love THE WILD BUNCH unreservedly.\n\nFilm’s Trailer"
