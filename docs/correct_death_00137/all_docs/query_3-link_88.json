        "text": "RAWALPINDI, Pakistan | Moments after a euphoric crowd stretched its arms toward Benazir Bhutto, moments after the charismatic former prime minister made herself vulnerable by saluting her followers through a car's sunroof, the street was awash with blood.\n\nAnd in that chaotic instant, a dangerous world became even more dangerous.\n\nEfforts to restore democracy in Pakistan suffered a crushing blow with Thursday's assassination of the 54-year-old Bhutto after a rally. A country that has nuclear weapons was even more destabilized, and America's hopes to maintain Pakistan as a bulwark against terrorism were shaken.\n\nOn whose behalf did the suicidal assassin kill Bhutto, 20 others and himself? No one knew for certain. But clearly, this was a victory for extremists.\n\nPresident Pervez Musharraf blamed Islamic terrorists. 'Today, after this tragic incident, I want to express my firm resolve ... we will not rest until we eliminate these terrorists and root them out,' he told a national television audience.\n\nMusharraf debated whether to postpone Jan. 8 elections — a bitter irony, because Bhutto had returned from exile to run in that election against Musharraf, leader of a military government since a 1999 coup. Another opposition politician, Nawaz Sharif, announced he would boycott any vote in the wake of Bhutto's murder.\n\nIn the United States, a tense-looking President Bush condemned the attack 'by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy.' Bush spoke briefly by phone with Musharraf; the Bush administration had banked on a plan to stabilize Pakistan with a rapprochement between Bhutto and Musharraf.\n\nAcross Pakistan, the shock of Thursday's bloodshed faded into violence, as Bhutto's enraged supporters burned vehicles and attacked shops. At least nine people died in the mayhem that followed. As news of her death spread, supporters gathered at the hospital where she had been taken, smashed glass doors, stoned cars.\n\nRightly or wrongly, they knew whom to blame: They chanted, 'Killer, Killer, Musharraf.'\n\nHours before, addressing more than 5,000 supporters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Bhutto scoffed at reports that foreign troops would be sent here to help fight resurgent militants linked to the Taliban and al-Qaida in the area bordering Afghanistan.\n\n'Why should foreign troops come in? We can take care of this, I can take care of this, you can take care of this,' she said.\n\nThen, as Bhutto left the rally in a white sports utility vehicle, the attacker struck.\n\nSardar Qamar Hayyat, an official from Bhutto's party, was about 10 yards away. A smiling Bhutto stuck her head out of the sunroof and responded to the chants of her supporters, he said.\n\n'Then I saw a thin, young man jumping toward her vehicle from the back and opening fire. Moments later, I saw her speeding vehicle going away. That was the time when I heard a blast and fell down,' Hayyat said.\n\nThe blast was a suicide bomb the young man was apparently carrying. The carnage was immediate.\n\nBhutto was rushed into emergency surgery. A doctor on the surgical team said a bullet in the back of her neck damaged her spinal cord before exiting from the side of her head. Another bullet pierced the back of her shoulder and came out through her chest, he said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. She was given an open heart massage, but the spinal cord damage was too great, he said.\n\n'At 6:16 p.m. she expired,' said Wasif Ali Khan, a member of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party who was at Rawalpindi General Hospital.\n\nBhutto's supporters questioned why the government had not provided her better security in the wake of death threats and previous attempts on her life — including a bombing that killed more than 140 people when she returned from exile in October.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds of riot police manned security checkpoints at the park for Bhutto's first public meeting in the city since her return. In November, Musharraf forced her to cancel a planned rally here, citing security fears. In recent weeks, suicide bombers have repeatedly targeted security forces in Rawalpindi, a city near the capital where Musharraf stays and the Pakistan army has its headquarters.\n\nMakhdoom Amin Fahim, chairman of Bhutto's party, called for a thorough investigation. 'The Bhutto family and the party should know who is behind the attack,' he said.\n\nSharif, another former premier and leader of a rival opposition party, demanded Musharraf resign immediately and announced his party would boycott the elections, seen as vital to restoring democracy after eight years of authoritarian rule under Musharraf. He also called for the resignation of Musharraf, a former army chief who toppled Sharif in a 1999 coup.\n\n'Musharraf is the cause of all the problems. The federation of Pakistan cannot remain intact in the presence of President Musharraf,' he said.\n\nMusharraf convened an emergency meeting with his senior staff to discuss a response to the killing and whether to postpone the election, an official at the Interior Ministry said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. Musharraf also announced three days of mourning for Bhutto, with all businesses, schools and banks in the country to be closed.\n\nThe killing could strengthen the increasingly unpopular Musharraf by eliminating a strong rival, or weaken him by sparking uncontrollable riots across the country.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council vigorously denounced the killing and urged 'all Pakistanis to exercise restraint and maintain stability in the country.'\n\nAuthorities would deploy troops to stop violence if needed, said Akhtar Zamin, home minister for Sindh province.\n\nBhutto was killed just a few miles from the scene of her father's violent death 28 years earlier. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a former prime minister and the founder of the party that his daughter would later lead, was executed by hanging in 1979 in Rawalpindi on charges of conspiracy to murder; supporters said the charges were politically motivated by the military regime. His killing led to violent protests across the country similar to the ones that raged across the country Thursday."
