        "text": "Rawalpindi: A Pakistani court on Thursday branded former military ruler Pervez Musharraf a fugitive in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s murder trial, but acquitted five men accused of being involved in the 2007 assassination.\n\nThe verdicts are the first to be issued since Bhutto, the first female prime minister of a Muslim country, was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack nearly a decade ago, sparking street violence and plunging Pakistan into months of political turmoil.\n\nFormer president and military ruler Musharraf is alleged to have been part of a broad conspiracy to have his political rival killed before elections. He has denied the allegation.\n\nHe was charged with murder, criminal conspiracy for murder, and facilitation for murder in 2013, in an unprecedented move against an ex-army chief, challenging beliefs the military is immune from prosecution.\n\nBut he has been in self-imposed exile in Dubai ever since a travel ban was lifted three years later.\n\nThe anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi ruled he had “absconded”, a court official told reporters outside, saying it had also ordered the confiscation of his property.\n\n“There will be no justice till Pervez Musharraf answers for his crimes!” Bhutto’s daughter Aseefa Zardari tweeted moments after the statement.\n\nThe court also acquitted five men who had been accused of being Taliban militants involved in the conspiracy to kill Bhutto on 27 December 2007. They were set to walk free nearly 10 years after they were first arrested, though a defence lawyer said it was not yet clear when they would be released.\n\nHowever the judges found two police officers guilty of “mishandling the crime scene”, the court official said.\n\nThe police officers—Saud Aziz, who was chief of Rawalpindi police at the time, and senior officer Khurram Shahzad—are now the only two people to have been convicted over Bhutto’s assassination.\n\nShahzad was accused of hosing down the crime scene less than two hours after the killing—an act the United Nations (UN) described in a report as “fundamentally inconsistent with Pakistani police practice”.\n\nAziz was accused of both giving Shahzad permission to hose down the scene, and of refusing multiple times to allow an autopsy of Bhutto’s body to go ahead.\n\nThey were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment on one count and seven on another, with the sentences to run concurrently, and fined Rs500,000, according to a court order.\n\nMusharraf’s government blamed the assassination on Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud, who denied any involvement. He was killed in a US drone attack in 2009.\n\nIn 2010, the UN report accused Musharraf’s government of failing to give Bhutto adequate protection and said her death could have been prevented.\n\nThe unanswered questions surrounding the case prompted a swirl of conspiracy theories.\n\nRashid A. Rizvi, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, alluded to them Thursday when he noted that the acquittals were “as much a conspiracy as her murder was”.\n\nThe judgement, political analyst Hasan Askari said, was unlikely to offer any clarity as it “has failed to answer the question of who actually murdered her”.\n\n“Were they Taliban or Musharraf?” he asked, adding the prosecution “could not provide any evidence... So the mystery remains unsolved”.\n\nMusharraf is facing a string of cases connected to his 1999-2008 rule, and Pakistani courts have ordered his property to be confiscated on previous occasions.\n\nHe was acquitted last year in the 2006 killing of a Baloch militant leader, but four cases remain against him: one accusing him of treason for imposing Emergency rule, one alleging the unlawful dismissal of judges, one over a deadly raid on the Red Mosque in Islamabad in 2007, and Bhutto’s killing."
