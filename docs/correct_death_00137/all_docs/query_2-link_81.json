        "text": "Following our blog on the assassination yesterday of the former Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, in a suicide attack, we will continue to keep you abreast of developments today.\n\nBhutto, who was killed just two months after returning to her homeland after eight years of self-imposed exile, will be buried alongside her father and two brothers in a huge white marble mausoleum in Nao Dero today. The mausoleum was built by Bhutto for her father after he was hanged in 1979.\n\nHer funeral procession has started in Larkana near Karachi in the province of Sindh. A wooden coffin is being carried by some of the thousands of mourners. Her husband, Asif Ali Zadari, and their three children will be attending the funeral.\n\n9.40\n\nIn today's Guardian, Declan Walsh in Karachi writes that Bhutto's assassination has cast into doubt the elections scheduled on January 8 and triggered fears of violent unrest and even civil war.\n\nThere are unconfirmed reports that al-Qaida has claimed responsibility for her murder, while others are pointing the finger at President Pervez Musharraf. Riaz Malik, of the opposition Pakistan movement for Justice party, said: \"There is a very real danger of civil war.\"\n\nThe Times reports that Bhutto had blamed Musharraf for failing to protect her in an email to a friend: \"She wrote she \"wld (would) hold Musharaf (sic) responsible\" if she was harmed in Pakistan.\"\n\nThe paper quotes an email Bhutto sent to Alan Duncan, the Conservatives' shadow business secretary, on Christmas Eve, in which she predicted her Pakistan People's party would win the forthcoming elections if they \"are not rigged\". But she ended the message saying it is \"better to be an optimist\".\n\n10.10\n\nThere are reports of unrest across the country, with 19 people killed according to a security official. Pakistani forces have been given authority to shoot violent protesters. Police have opened fire on protesters in the southern city of Hydrabad, wounding five people.\n\nThe Pakistani news channel Geo TV says more than 100 vehicles, banks, petrol pumps and factories have been set on fire in Karachi.\n\nAP says police fired teargas into crowds in the central city of Multan after around 7,000 people ransacked seven banks and a petrol station. In the capital, Islamabad, about 100 protesters burned tyres in a commercial quarter of the city.\n\nA roadside bomb has exploded, killing four people, near the village of Manglore in the district of Swat, about 200 km (120 miles) northeast of Peshawar, the capital of the north-west frontier province. The victims were a local leader from the ruling party in north-western Pakistan and three of his associates. The attack is believed to be linked to a local dispute with a pro-Taliban cleric rather than Bhutto's assassination.\n\n9.50\n\nCommentators have been speculating on the political rammifications of Bhutto's assassination. Many are predicting that the elections will be postponed. Kanishk Tharoor, on openDemocracy, notes that the PPP has been left in disarray following her death.\n\nIt's also worth looking at an analysis of the political crisis facing Pakistan, published by the respected international affairs thinktank Chatham House last month. It warned that \"neither Musharraf nor Bhutto can expect to win the struggle against Islamic militancy without a clear mandate to do so. This entails urgently restoring civilian rule - however flawed - through free and fair elections.\"\n\n10.30\n\nThere are now several news reports of the assassination on YouTube. This one, from CNN, quotes Bhutto aide Sardar Qarmar Hayyat as saying he saw \"a thin young man jumping to her vehicle from the back and opening fire\".\n\n10.50\n\nSixteen people, including three policeman, have been killed in violent protests in Sindh province, where the funeral is taking place, according to Reuters.\n\n11.00\n\nBhutto's coffin has arrived at her family's mausoleum to be interred. The white ambulance carrying the simple wooden coffin - draped with the green, red and black tricolour of her party - is surrounded by tens of thousands of her supporters. Many of the mourners are chanting slogans against President Musharraf and pro-government parties.\n\n11.10\n\nGlobal Voices has set up a page aggregating blogs and posts about Bhutto's assassination. There's also an RSS feed of bloggers' reactions.\n\nMarxist blog the Red Diary reckons Bhutto was killed because \"the strong possibility of the rise of a secularist Benazir into power made her a mortal threat for those in the State who harbored sympathy for Islamic Fundamentalists\".\n\n11.20\n\nBhutto's coffin is now being buried, according to Pakistan State TV.\n\n11.28\n\nBhutto has been buried next to her father in the family mausoleum.\n\n12.04\n\nBritish prime minister Gordon Brown has urged Musharraf to \"stick to the course he has outlined to build democracy and stability in Pakistan\". Brown said of Bhutto's assassination: \"This was a cowardly terrorist act designed to destabilise democratic elections.\"\n\n12.51\n\nThe death toll resulting from protests in Sindh province has risen to 17. Mobs burned 10 railway stations and several trains across the region, forcing the suspension of all train services between Karachi and eastern Punjab. Meanwhile, Saud Aziz, the police chief in Rawalpindi, where Bhutto was killed, said investigators had reconstructed a mangled head recovered from the scene, which is believed to belong to her suicide attacker.\n\n14.40\n\nAt least 23 people have been killed in the unrest, according to the latest figures from security officials.\n\n15.46\n\nThe number of people killed in the unrest has risen to 32. Pakistan's interior ministry says it intercepted an al-Qaida phone call about the Bhutto attack. The ministry says it has \"irrefutable evidence that al-Qaida is trying to destabilise Pakistan\".\n\n15.52\n\nThe surgeon who treated Bhutto says she was killed by shrapnel from the blast when her suicide attacker blew himself up, and not by the shots he fired.\n\n16.03\n\nIn a press briefing, the interior ministry says Bhutto died when the force of the explosion smashed her head against a lever on the sunroof of her car. It says no bullet or shrapnel was found in her body. Confusion over the exact cause of her death may well continue because her husband has refused permission for a full autopsy.\n\n17.09\n\nThere are now several dramatic accounts of the hours after the attack on Metroblogging. Karachi blogger Inspirex writes: \"We started seeing crowds of people frantically walking towards us and passing us, looking back over their shoulders. One of the people told us that cars were set ablaze (...) A few moments later we heard some screaming, smashing of glass and when we looked behind us, barely 4-5 cars away, a car was set ablaze.\""
