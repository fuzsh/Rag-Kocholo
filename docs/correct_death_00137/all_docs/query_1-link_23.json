        "text": "Pakistan was plunged into deeper political turmoil today after the assassination of the former prime minister and main opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, in a suicide attack.\n\nAs he confronted a situation that threatened to spiral out of control, President Pervez Musharraf condemned the attack as the work of terrorists and appealed for calm.\n\n\"This is the work of those terrorists with whom we are engaged in war,\" he told Pakistan state TV. \"I have been saying that the nation faces the greatest threats from these terrorists. Today after this tragic incident, I want to express my firm resolve.\"\n\nMusharraf announced three days of national mourning during which the Pakistani flag will fly at half-mast.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the attack, the president convened an emergency meeting to discuss the government's reaction. Unnamed sources told the Associated Press news agency that the discussions included whether or not to proceed as planned with January's parliamentary elections.\n\nThe US president, George Bush, broke off his holiday at Camp David to condemn the killing of Bhutto, who was the first woman to lead a Muslim state. Bhutto's death marks a severe blow for the US, which had encouraged Bhutto to return from exile and share power with Musharraf.\n\n\"The United States strongly condemns this cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy,\" Bush said, adding that those responsible for Bhutto's death \"must be brought to justice\".\n\nBhutto was killed as her jeep pulled away from an election rally in Rawalpindi. Standing up in an open-top jeep, she presented a clear target.\n\nEyewitnesses spoke of hearing gunshots followed by a bomb blast. Bhutto's security adviser, Rehman Malik, said the former PM was shot in the chest and neck. Conflicting reports from Pakistan's interior ministry said Bhutto was killed by the suicide bomber's collision with her jeep.\n\nBhutto was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery but is reported to have died on the journey at 6.16pm local time (1.16pm GMT). At least 20 others were killed in the attack.\n\nAnnouncing the death of the Pakistan People's party (PPP) leader outside the hospital, Bhutto's lawyer said: \"The surgeons confirmed that she has been martyred.\"\n\nBhutto's supporters at the hospital wept, smashed the glass doors and started fires around the hospital periphery. Some were heard to shout \"dog, Musharraf, dog\" and \"killer Musharraf\".\n\nHer long-time political rival and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif went straight to Bhutto's bedside. Bhutto and Sharif had been attempting to form a united front.\n\nIn a statement, Sharif referred to her as a \"sister\" and said he \"shared the grief of the entire nation\". He later demanded Musharraf resign immediately.\n\n\"The holding of fair and free elections is not possible in the presence of Pervez Musharraf. After the killing of Benazir Bhutto, I announce that the Pakistan Muslim League-N will boycott the elections,\" he said.\n\nMembers of other opposition parties said her death could trigger civil war.\n\nIn Karachi, shop owners quickly closed their businesses as protesters set tyres on fire on the roads, torched several vehicles and burned a petrol station, said Fayyaz Leghri, a local police official. Gunmen shot and wounded two police officers, he said.\n\nOne man was killed in a shootout between police and protesters in Tando Allahyar, a town 120 miles north of Karachi, said the mayor, Kanwar Naveed. In the town of Tando Jam, protesters forced passengers to get out of a train and then set it on fire.\n\nViolence also broke out in Lahore, Multan, Peshawar and many other parts of Pakistan, where Bhutto's supporters burned banks, state-run grocery stores and private shops. Some set fire to the election offices of the ruling party, according to Pakistani media.\n\nThe violence came at the height of campaigning by opposition leaders. Hours before the assassination, clashes between Sharif supporters and pro-government supporters at a separate rally saw four people killed and three wounded.\n\nAs soon as the government learned of Bhutto's assassination it convened an informal discussion on whether or not to go ahead with January's elections as planned. Holding the elections as planned was something for which Bhutto had campaigned hard.\n\nThe United Nations announced it was convening an emergency meeting concerning the assassination.\n\nThe British foreign secretary, David Miliband, called for \"restraint but also unity\" as he expressed his shock at Bhutto's death.\n\n\"All those committed to a stable future for Pakistan will condemn without qualification all violence perpetrated against innocent people,\" he said. \"In targeting Benazir Bhutto extremist groups have in their sights all those committed to democratic processes in Pakistan. They cannot and must not succeed.\"\n\nMalik, Bhutto's security adviser, questioned the adequacy of protection for Bhutto.\n\n\"We repeatedly informed the government to provide her proper security and appropriate equipment including jammers, but they paid no heed to our requests,\" he said.\n\nIt appears the Musharraf government had been considering ways to strengthen her security, and it forced Bhutto's PPP to cancel a rally in Rawalpindi in November due to security fears.\n\nToday's Rawalpindi rally only went ahead after hundreds of riot police had set up security checkpoints. Rawalpindi is a so-called garrison city and popularly regarded as one of the most secure cities in Pakistan.\n\nOn Bhutto's return to the country in October after eight years in exile, a local Taliban leader threatened to unleash a series of suicide attacks.\n\nAlthough today's attacks bore the hallmarks of Islamist opponents to the moderate Bhutto, critics attacked Musharraf.\n\nIn Rawalpindi, grieving supporters tore down the posters of Musharraf's ruling party and attacked police, who fled from the scene. Angry supporters also took to the streets in Peshawar, while in Karachi shop owners quickly closed for business as activists from Bhutto's party burned tyres on the roads.\n\nThe assassination came two months after more than 140 people were killed when suicide bombers struck a parade celebrating Bhutto's return from exile in the southern city of Karachi."
