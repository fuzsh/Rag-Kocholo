        "text": "History of Anniversary of Benazir Bhutto's Death\n\nBenazir Bhutto was the former Prime Minister of Pakistan and was the chair of the political party called the Pakistan Peoples Party. She was born with a political background since her father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto also served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan. He was, however, removed from power in a military coup and later hanged for a crime he didn’t commit. After his death, Bhutto was sent into exile and she did not return to Pakistan until 1986. When she returned, she found that the nation had not forgotten her. At the airport, she was greeted by such large crowds that it took her motorcade nine-and-a-half hours to travel the eight miles from the airport to a rally site in Lahore.\n\nBhutto then served two terms as the Prime Minister of Pakistan until she was exiled in the late 1990s by military dictator Pervez Musharraf. After the dictatorship ended, Bhutto returned to Pakistan and joined an Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy in 2006. Amidst negotiations between the military regime and other politicians, Bhutto continued to hold rallies for her supporters across Pakistan.\n\nOn October 19, 2007, one of these rallies was disrupted by a suicide bomber who ended up killing 139 of her supporters. Bhutto survived the attack. However, her luck was short-lived as she was again attacked at a rally on December 27, 2007. Bhutto was standing through her vehicle’s sunroof to wave at supporters when three shots were heard. The attack was followed by a blast. Bhutto died on the way to the hospital."
