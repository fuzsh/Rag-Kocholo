        "text": "Attention Ghoul Boys:\n\nTransylvania University is a historic private liberal arts college in Lexington, Kentucky. In fact, we’re the oldest university in Kentucky. We also have 2 bodies in a tomb on campus. In the 1800s, the campus was cursed by botany professor Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. This curse has caused our main building, Old Morrison, to burn down twice, as well as multiple mysterious deaths and other happenings on campus. Rafinesque, known on campus as Raf, died in Philadelphia but his remains were unearthed and returned to campus and placed in a tomb on campus in hopes that the curse would be lifted if he was laid to rest on campus (the remains may not even be his, but that’s another story). We were also the home of a heist in the early 2000s, which was the focus of the movie American Animals, starring Barry Keoghan and Evan Peters.\n\nWe also are rumored to have multiple ghosts on campus! One of them is said to be a student who committed suicide in a dorm. This ghost is said to be a male in gym shorts who will appear at the foot of your bed and then disappear. Another lesser known ghost haunts Little Theater. This is Lucille Little, the namesake of the theater. I’ve heard firsthand stories of her making noises, turning on faucets, and flushing toilets during late nights in the theater.\n\nAlso the school is literally called Transylvania University. If that’s not creepy enough to draw the Ghoul Boys here I don’t know what is.\n\nAnyways, Shane and Ryan and the Watcher team, we would love to have you come and investigate the campus. By we I mean me (the organizer of this petition) and my roommate. But I’m sure other students are Boogaras and Shaniacs as well and would love to have you! We would love to have you come investigate the campus for Ghost Files (as long as the administration approves of course)\n\nSincerely, Maddie Goins (Transylvania University First Year Student)"
