KILROE NEW YORK I-'\"- •SAINT TAMMANY AND THE ORIGIN OF THE SOCIETY OF TAMMANY OR COLUMBIAN ORDER IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK BY EDWIN PATRICK KILROE SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE FACULTY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY NEW YORK 1913 COPYRIGHT, 1913 BY EDWIN P. KILROE PREFACE THE following treatise is the result of a study under- taken under the direction of the School of Political Science, Columbia University. Its original purpose was the prepara- tion of a monograph on the political significance of Tam- many Hall. A brief investigation, however, of the pub- lished works on the subject revealed the fact that no authen- tic exhaustive work had been written or even attempted, including the whole or any considerable part of the field. It became apparent that the subject invited a complete investi- gation to reveal the true scope of the movement of the early Tammany Societies, the legendary of Saint Tammany, and the origin and development of the Society of Tammany in the City of New York, as the basis for the proper under- standing of the growth and influence of the institution and the evolution of the Democratic \" machine \" in New York County. Such a work has been undertaken and the follow- ing chapters are the beginnings of the complete history that is planned. In the search for original sources of information, the writer found himself in a maze of pertinent and interesting but wholly uncollated data, revealing the necessity for a comprehensive bibliography as a guide to the inquiry. Dur- ing its preparation the miscellaneous information which is presented in the form of an appendix to this dissertation was secured. The appendix includes a list of orations de- livered before Tammany Societies in the United States, with contemporary criticisms wherever found; and it may not be amiss to add that the orations reflect the attitude of the societies upon the social, political and economic problems 3 263729 4 PREFACE and conditions of their times — an indispensable source of information to the investigator of the movement. The facts and traditions concerning Saint Tammany, which are here collected for the first time, possess more than an antiquarian interest, for they disclose the character of the fetich to which the movement of the Tammany So- cieties was dedicated. No pains, therefore, have been spared in presenting the topic. The amount of information uncovered respecting the several epochs of the history of the Tammany Society of New York City varies greatly. From 1789 to 1800, the important activities are adequately chronicled in contem- porary newspapers, and much documentary information is accessible. During the period from 1800 to 1812 the major functions are briefly treated in the news columns, but the sources are not so abundant as in the preceding decade. A mere outline of the workings of the Society from 1812 to 1825 is provided by the press, and an occasional broad- side or pamphlet issued by the Society, or published by its political opponents, furnishes additional sidelights on the activities of the period. There is a paucity of informa- tion covering the period between 1825 and 1850, broken only by an occasional pamphlet and the passing comment of general works. The daily newspapers of New York City, numerous magazines and periodicals, together with official publications by the Society in the form of broadsides, pamphlets, communications and accounts of its proceedings, furnish abundant material for its history during the latter half of the nineteenth century. In discussing the development of the early Tammany Societies, the article by Francis Von Cabeen, on The So- ciety of the Sons of Saint Tammany of Philadelphia, pub- lished in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biog- raphy in 1902, was of great assistance. The references PREFACE 5 pointed out by Mr. Cabeen were of especial value in de- scribing the part played in the movement by the Philadelphia Society. The author takes pleasure in acknowledging the assist- ance rendered to him by Mr. Albert Matthews, lexicog- rapher and historical investigator, of Boston, Massachusetts, by furnishing references to invaluable sources. The splen- did facilities of the New York Historical Society, New York Public, New York Society, American Antiquarian, Brown University, and Columbia University Libraries, and the Library of Congress, made accessible vast store- houses of information, and the courtesy of their respective librarians is gratefully remembered. Professor Charles A. Beard, of Columbia University, under whose personal su- pervision this study was commenced, has been unstinting in his suggestions and encouragement. To Professor E. M. Sait, of Columbia University, the writer is indebted for helpful, scholarly criticism. Mr. William A. Hildebrand, formerly assistant librarian at the New York Historical Society, has materially aided in verifying references. The author is especially grateful to Dr. Austin Baxter Keep, of the College of the City of New York, who has read manuscript and proof throughout and whose experience in historical investigation has provided a never failing source of assistance and sympathetic interest. Louis E. Swarts, Esq., of the New York Bar, has aided in the revision and arrangement of the work in the same cordial spirit of cooperation that has characterized his professional relations with the writer during the past seven years.

INTRODUCTION THE Tammany Societies in the United States exercised a powerful influence in shaping the destinies and in crystal- lizing the principles of our government, and have contrib- uted much to the development of our present extra-consti- tutional system of party government. The importance of this influence has been inadequately recognized by students of American history. The societies bore the standards of equal rights and popular rule like the powerful Jacobin clubs of the French Revolution, and were the rallying points of Republican activity until the complete annihilation of the Federalist party. Under the favoring leadership of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison the movement flourished, and in its organized activities foreshadowed the establishment of national political machines. With the passing of the Federalists the issues which had stimulated the movement disappeared, and one by one the societies succumbed to the lethargy resulting from the cessation of violent partisan controversy. The New York Tammany Society alone remained, presenting the most curious phenomenon in the history of American politics in its development from a patriotic and fraternal institution to an organized force or machine in party politics ; in which position, for three- quarters of a century, it dominated the public life of the American metropolis. Originally a society of purely social and patriotic motives, the organization was transformed into an agency for the assertion and maintenance of Republican principles; and, under the corrupting influence of partisan greed, degene- rated at times into an oppressive vehicle for the acquisition 11 12 INTRODUCTION of political spoils. Following the disclosures of the iniqui- tous Tweed Ring in 1871, the Society slowly relinquished its hold upon the party machinery, and the evolution of state election laws regulating party control completed the separation. Thus by a singular metamorphosis, the Society, which for so many years had been absolute dictator of Democratic politics in New York City, the arbiter of party regularity, and the distributor of public patronage, was wholly divorced from its partisan control and partially reha- bilitated in its original character as a fraternal and patriotic body. The building known as Tammany Hall is owned and con- trolled by the Society of Tammany or Columbian Order in the City of New York. The term \" Tammany Hall,\" however, in popular significance is used to designate the dominant faction of the Democratic party of the County of New York. This designation arises from the fact that the assembly room of the Society, ever since the construction of the first Tammany Hall in 1811, has been the meeting place of the controlling committees of the Democratic party. In a similar manner the dominant faction of the local Democracy prior to 1811 acquired the names of \" Martling party \" and \" Tammanial party,\" because it met in the Society's wig- wam at Martling's Long Room; and, in the struggle with De Witt Clinton for supremacy within the party, the faction led by the Society was called \" Bucktails,\" after the well- known Tammanial emblem. The political organization known as \" Tammany Hall \" and the Society of Tammany or Columbian Order in the City of New York are, therefore, separate and distinct entities, — the former a body created by statute, a legalized functionary of party government ; the latter the shell of an ancient and honorable patriotic organization. The Society and the \" Machine,\" however, so far interlock that it is INTRODUCTION 13 customary for leaders of the party to be officers of the So- ciety. Thus the Society is to-day dominated by the political institution which it created and long controlled. The Society no longer occupies a position of leadership in the celebration of public holidays, so many of which it originated, and to the establishment of which it contributed so prominent a part. The modern Tammany Society, divested of the political machinations which deprived it of its estimable non-partisan character, is entitled by virtue of its ancient traditions and historic public service to become again a leader in the patriotic ceremonial of the City of New York. For this office its membership and plan of organization render it peculiarly fit, and it is the hope of its votaries that this function may again be delegated to the Society. The Tammany Society has survived over a century and a quarter of storm and stress, during which it has exerted a portentous influence upon the life of the American Com- monwealth. Its principles have been deprecated and its motives assailed on the one hand, and, on the other, its glories celebrated and its virtues enlarged by interested partisans. With the prejudice born of opposition, detractors have arisen without its ranks, while its eulogists have taken inspiration from their own devotion to the Order. Unhap- pily, those whose dispassionate estimation has been fur- nished to us, with spectatorial indifference, have failed to fathom its anomalies or to search out the hidden funds of information from which alone could accuracy arise. The subject is worthy of a better fate. The history of no other isolated institution is so fraught with epoch-making prece- dent, nor presents a more useful illustration of the work- ing out of our republican forms, — revealing at once the spreading ulcers of corruption and the healthy growth of the sinews of true democracy. 14 INTRODUCTION The Order has participated in numberless movements of social, political and civic import; every epoch, every year, has seen its affirmative acts; and its position has been writ large in infinite bitter controversy. That the record of its achievements and of its activities, both social and per- nicious, should form the basis for an impartial judgment of its worth, is the postulate from which a compendious history of the Society should proceed. A study of its fore- runners, the ideals to which it aspired, the causes and scope of its organization, together with a description of the early activities of the Society, are the purposes of the present work. CHAPTER I SAINT TAMMANY 1. Tamenend THE American Indian or \"Amerind \" has enriched our history and our literature with two heroic characters, Hiawatha,2 a chief of the Onondagas, and Tammany, a sachem of the Dela wares.3 Hiawatha conceived and founded the great Iroquois Confederacy,4 America's first Republic, a potent influence for the promotion of peace and amity among the Indian nations. Notwithstanding the errors of historians and distortions of poets, our history and literature have accorded undying fame to this; great law- giver and reformer of an aboriginal race. The name of x Tammany is preserved in history by a series of blunders, while in literature as the patron saint of our country his fame is perpetuated by numerous legends, odes and poems. He is also honored as the patron and guiding spirit of a patriotic and fraternal movement that gave rise to a society which in turn has developed into a powerful and astounding political machine. Both characters are depicted as the incar- nation of nobility, sagacity and power, and crowned with magnetic charm, personifying those essential attributes always bestowed by an indulgent posterity when a great historic figure is molded. Tammany, the tutelary saint of America, as a character stands unique. Much has been written concerning his virtue, prowess and achievements; and about his memory a kind and bounteous tradition has woven numberless romances which rival the tales of Heracles and Theseus, and give 15 16 SAINT TAMMANY him a place in the Indian lore of America analogous to that held by those demi-gods in ancient Greek mythology. This Nestor5 of the American Indians, whom tradition is pleased to describe as the embodiment of wisdom and honor, and whose ability, benevolence, nobility and diplomatic savoir faire brought to him immortal renown, was a sachem of the Lenni-Lenape or Delaware Indians. His origin, his achievements and his death are shrouded in obscurity, while only a short period of his life is actually open to the scru- tiny of research. For fifteen years he was in contact with the whites, but during that period he did not appear as a chief of extraordinary accomplishments or importance; nor does he seem to have made a profound impression on the white settlers, for there is no record that they were awed by the force of his genius or charmed by his personality. The authentic history of Tammany 6 is short and simple, and the events recorded are neither startling nor impress- ive. His name was first presented in writing, to the civilized world, on June 23, 1683, when he affixed his mark to a deed of that date, granting to William Penn, Proprietor, \" all my Lands Lying betwixt Pemmapecka and Nessami- nehs Creeks, and all along Nesheminehs Creeks . . . for ye Consideration of so much Wampum, so many Guns, Shoes, Stockings, Looking-glasses, Blanketts and other goods as he, ye sd William Penn shall please to give unto me.\" r On that same day Tammany and Metamequan exe- cuted a joint deed and affixed their respective marks thereto, granting to William Penn the identical lands that Tammany had conveyed in the previous deed ; and at the same time ex- ecuted a receipt for the consideration received, with which \" we doe hereby hold ourselves fully contented and satis- fyed.\" On June 25, 1683, the name of Tammany ap- pears with four other Indian names in witness to a deed given by Wingebone to William Penn for \" Lands Lying TAMENEND 17 on ye West side of ye Skolkill River begining from ye first Falls of ye same all along upon ye sd River and Backward of ye same, so farr as my right goeth.\" His name is again presented for our consideration in a letter written by William Penn to the Society of Traders on August 16, 1683. 10 In speaking of the Lenape or Delaware Indians, Penn only casually mentions the name of Tammany; his remarks are : \" Their language is lofty yet narrow : . . . I must say that I know not a language spoken in Europe, that hath words of more sweetness, in accent or emphasis, than theirs; for instance, Tamene, Secane, Menase, Secate- rius, are the names of persons.\" On June 15, 1692, the name, with those of three other Indians, appears on a quit-claim deed.11 By this instru- ment they acknowledged \" full Satisfaction for all that Tract of Land formerly belonging to Taminent and others, which wee parted with unto William Penn, Proprietor. . . . Therefore wee Doo hereby acquitt, release & discharg the said Proprietor his Heirs & Success1\"5 from any further claims, dues & demands whatsoever, Concerning the said Lands or any other Tract of Land claimed by us from the beginning of the World to the day of the date hereof.\" This sweeping conveyance in legal effect wiped out all of Tammany's land claims in Pennsylvania. In this transac- tion, at least, his native shrewdness does not show to any great advantage, for the white representatives of the Pro- prietor clearly out-traded him and drove a good bargain. The name of Tammany next appears in the minutes of a meeting of the Pennsylvania Provincial Council, held in Philadelphia on July 6, 1694. The purpose of the Coun- cil was to confer with the Delaware Indians concerning a proposition made by the Seneca Nation, to have the Dela- wares join the Senecas in a war against the French. The minutes of this meeting contain the only record of a speech 18 SAIXT TAMMANY made by Tammany that may be considered authentic. Dur- ing the conference Tammany spoke of the whites as follows : \" Wee and the Christians of this River Have all way es had a free rode way to one another, & tho' sometimes a tree has fallen across the rode yet wee have still removed it again & kept the path clean, and wee design to Continou the old friendshipp that has been between us and you.\" The coun- cil assured the Indians that the English were their friends and would protect them from both the French and the Sen- ecas. \" So they all departed verie well satisfied with the Lt. Governor's answer.\" 12 In this conference Tammany played no important part, the real leader being Hithquo- quean, who \" in name of the rest of the Delaware Indians took outt and laid down a Belt of Wampum \" and acted as spokesman for the tribe. Again, the names of Tammany and four members of his household — his two sons, his brother and the heir-apparent to the chief tancy of the Delaware Nation — appear in a deed dated July 6, 1697.13 of which the following excerpt is pertinent : We Tammy Sachimack and Weheeland my Brother and Weheequeckhon, alias Andrew, who is to be King after my death, Yaqueekhon alias Nicholas, and Quenameckquid, Alias Charles, my Sonns, for the Consideration of Twenty Match- coats, Twelve White Blankets, Ten Kettles, Twelve Guns, Thirty Yards of Shirting Cloth, one Runlett of Powder, Ten Barrs of Lead, fforty yards of Stroud Waters, Twenty Parrs of Stockins, one Horse, ffifty pounds of Tobacco, Six Dozens of Pipes and Thirty Shillings in Cash . . . Do give, grant, alien, sell, en feoff and confirm unto the said William Penn, his Heirs and Assigns, All the Lands, Woods, Meadows, Riv- ers, Rivulets, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties Whatsoever, sit- uated lyeing and being Between the Creek called Pemopeck and the Creek called Neshaminy, in the said Province Extending in Length from the River Delaware, so farr as a horse can Travel TAMEXEND 19 in Two Summer dayes, and to carry its breadth accordingly as the several Courses of the said two Creeks will Admit, And when the said Creek do so branch that the main Branches or bodies thereof cannot be discovered, Then the Tract of Land hereby granted, shall stretch forth upon a direct course on each side and so carry on the fful Breadth to the extent of the Length thereof. In the first deed from the Delaware Indians to William Penn, dated July 15, 1682, the conveyance was made by the %i said Indyan sachamackers, parties to these presents, as well for and on behalfe of themselves as for and on the behalf e of their Respective Indyans or People for whom they are concerned/' This clause would seem to give color to the position taken by Morgan, in his \"Ancient So- ciety,\" ' that Indian lands were occupied by the tribe in common. The system of land tenure among the Dela- \\vares and the powers and duties of the head of the Nation are not clearly defined by writers and investigators of Indian customs, and the deeds signed by Tammany throw but little light on the question. For in the transfer of lands to Wil- liam Penn there is no clear evidence of a tribal supervision, nor is there anything to show that the lands were held in trust by the sachem for the use and benefit of the tribes- men. It was not customary for a sachem, however high his rank, to attend any land conferences that did not affect his private possessions. To the first and to many other deeds to William Penn the name of Tammany was not affixed, which leads us to infer that he concerned himself only with his own patrimony; and, inasmuch as he joined with other sachems in transferring land, his power over the land was no greater than theirs. Thus it would seem that land tenure among the Delawares, in so far as it was defined at all, was one of private ownership. We find the name of Tammany in print in 1698, in an 20 SAINT TAMMANY article by Gabriel Thomas, who arrived in America shortly after the landing of William Penn and spent some fifteen years among the early settlers. On his return to London he published an interesting account of his experiences in America, but his sole allusion to Tammany is found as follows in a discussion of the Delaware Indians : 16 * The names of some of the Indians — Anachkoating, Bussabena- ting, O'Konycan, Potasko, Quindasnon, Lames, Alpoogan, Kohonk, Hiton, Temeny\" This brief record of Tammany's dealings with the English settlers completes his authentic biography. It discloses merely a series of business transactions, in each of which the Chief was outwitted and outbargained by the business tact and shrewdness of his white neighbors. With the mere reference to his name by Thomas in 1698, the Chief passes from history, and no more is heard of him until 1771, when he is introduced to us in the guise of a Saint, with the first of May set aside as the day sacred to his name. How this remarkable transformation took place, and why Tammany, who appears as a chief of only ordinary attainments, was selected for popular canonization, are questions yet to be answered by the student of American history. Everything written about him subsequent to 1698 is based on conjec- ture, romance and untrustworthy tradition. There are no portraits of Tammany in existence ir and only two writers have transmitted descriptions of his per- sonal appearance. One, ascribed to William Penn, thus de- picts the Chief : \" He found him an old man, but yet vigor- ous in mind and body, with high notions of liberty, easily won by the suavity and peaceful address of the Governor.\" The other is by James Fenimore Cooper, who gives what purports to be a full description of Tammany and reveals him presiding over a Council of the Delawares in the neigh- borhood of Lake George, New York, in the year 1757.1* TRADITIONS OF SAINT TAMMANY 21 The description is based on legends and traditions current in 1825, when Cooper wrote, and in reality is but an imper- sonal idealization of an Indian chief. x 2. Traditions of Saint Tammany. Tradition states that Tammany was the first to welcome Penn on his arrival in America, on October 27, 1682, and that he was present, in June, 1683, at the Great Treaty under the Elm at Schakamaxon; history, however, has left no record of the individuals present on these two occasions. The Indians in attendance at the Treaty were the entire tribe of the Susquehannocks and the Unami and Unalachtigo clans of the Dela wares.20 The object of the meeting was to confirm the land grants previously made to William Penn, and to negotiate a treaty of friendship, \" to last as long as the sun should shine and the waters run into the rivers.\" Tammany, it must be remembered, up to this time had made no conveyances to Penn; so his presence was not essential to confirm the land grants.22 The residence of Tammany has been assigned to various places. Richard C. Adams 2S fixes it at the present site of Wilmington, Delaware; another writer locates him in 1683 at Perkasie.24 Others place his wigwam at the present site of Princeton University,25 an error arising from the fact that there was situated the home of Col. George Morgan,26 upon whom it is said the western Delawares conferred the sobriquet \" Tamanend.\" Tamma- ny's residence has also been fixed at the present site of Easton, at that of Scranton, and at the Delaware Water Gap, all in the state of Pennsylvania, likewise in the upper Ohio Valley 2? and in northern New York.19 The most persistent tradition of his residence, however, is that he once settled on the upper Delaware, near the present vil- lage of Cochecton, on the Pennsylvania side of the river, 22 SAINT TAMMANY on the fertile bottom lands in what is now Damascus town- ship. In 1775 Joseph Skinner and his eight sons settled at a place called Acklake, now Milanville, Wayne County, Penna., opposite the present town of Cochecton, New York. David Skinner, the eldest son, succeeded his father in the ownership of the family farm, which he called St. Tamma- ny's Flats.28 Just when this appellation was bestowed on the locality we are not informed, but that it was later than 1772 seems certain, for the canonization of Tammany was not generally recognized until after that date. Daniel Skinner, or \" The Admiral,\" as he was familiarly called, floated rafts from Cochecton to Philadelphia, and on these trips heard of, and perhaps attended, the celebrations which took place in the latter place between 1772 and 1790, on the first day of May. Thus he became acquainted with the name of St. Tammany, learned its significance, and, fasci- nated by the legends and ceremonies, applied it to his own plantation.2\" This alone gave color to the story that Tammany lived at Damascus, on the flats that bear his name, for there is no authentic information to indicate that he even visited that section of Wayne County. His authentic residence, however, has been located on the lower Delaware and along the fertile banks of the Neshaminy river in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on the lands which between 1683 and 1697 he conveyed to William Penn.30 Three places, widely separated, claim the grave 31 of Tammany. The view has been advanced that he was buried on the spot where now stands Nassau Hall at Princeton, New Jersey; but, like the tradition of his residence there, this view may be dismissed by recalling the fact that Colonel Morgan, known as \" Tamanend,\" lived and died at Prospect, the present site of Princeton. For the story that Tammany was buried at Muskingurn, Ohio, and a huge mound erected over his grave, no confirmation whatever can be found. In TRADITIONS OF SAINT TAMMANY 23 fact, the tale originated with an orator \" who afterward admitted that it was pure fiction, but its adoption by certain serious, albeit unsophisticated, writers gave the story a wide and unwarranted currency. On the other hand, an elaborate set of circumstances is advanced as evidence of his burial beside a spring near the bank of the Neshaminy creek in New Britain township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\" This tradition, as preserved by the Shewell family\" of that county, relates that about 1740 or 1750 an aged chief, with his followers, was proceeding to attend a conference with the Pennsylvania Proprietaries at Philadelphia. The chief, too infirm to walk, was carried by younger members of the party. They halted near a spring, where the young Indians built a hut for the old man ; for they either became tired of their burden or wished to hasten to the conference at an appointed time. When night came on they decamped, leaving the old man under the care of an Indian girl. On awakening the following morning, he became so distressed and enraged at finding himself deserted that he sought death by stabbing himself; but his weakness frustrated this attempt. Persevering in his endeavor to take his own life, he set fire to his bed of leaves and threw himself upon it.\" The other Indians who, in the absence of their chief, were denied an audience by the Proprietaries, returned to the hut and found the old man, with a hole burned in his side, dead. The incident became known in the neighbor- hood, and Walter Shewell, a man of prominence in that vicinity, had the body buried near the hut, in the presence of the other Indians. Soon afterward the body of another Indian, presumed to be a son or descendant of the aged chief, was brought to the spring for burial, and laid beside the body of the patriarch. This legend of Tammany's death \" found favor in the popular imagination, supplied the theme for odes and poems, and its action was repro- 24 SAINT TAMMANY duced as a part of the ceremonial of the Tammany Societies' celebrations. In the New York Journal and Patriotic Regis- ter for May 19, 1792, we find an account of the celebration of the Tammany Society of Charleston, South Carolina, on May first of that year, in which a pantomime depicting Tam- many's tragic end is described as follows : At about 4 o'clock they sat down to a plain and plentiful dinner, and after imbibing a suitable quantity of Indian drink proceeded to the solemnity of burning the Old Chief, who being placed in the Wigwam and having sung the death song, fire was set thereto and the whole immediately consumed. A dance, after the Indian manner, concluded the ceremonies of the day. It is evident that the chief buried was not Tammany; for, if Tammany had been alive as late as 1749, he would scarcely have escaped the attention of the Moravian mis- sionaries who began their work among the Delaware Indians as early as 1742. We have no direct record of the date of Tammany's death, but from collateral facts it would seem that his career as a chieftain ended about 1698, for in that year Owhala, or Ocahle (Owechela),37 is mentioned in the Maryland Council Records as King of the Delawares. From the same source we learn that on August 29, 1700, in Cecil County, Maryland, Owhala on behalf of the Dela- ware Nation signed a treaty of friendship with the Mary- land Commissioners. Professors A. L. Guss 38 is of the opinion that \" Owhala,\" \" Owehala on Christina,\" and We- heeland, mentioned as Tammany's brother in the deed of July 6, 1697, are the same person; and that Weehee- queckhon, who was to be king after Tammany, was the celebrated Sassoonan or Allummapees. If this be true, it is fair to infer that Weheeland or Owehela, Tammany's brother, acted as regent during the minority of Wehee- queckhon. For on July 26, 1701, the Pennsylvania Coun- cil sent a message to Menangey, Hithquoquean, and Owe- TRADITIONS OF SAINT TAMMANY 25 hela on Christina, the leaders of the southern Delawares, inviting them to be present at the next meeting of the assembly of the Province to discuss a proposed law prohibit- ing the sale of rum to Indians. If Tammany were then alive, his name would appear among those invited to attend so important a conference. Mercer,33 however, is con- vinced that Tammany was deposed as Chief in 1718, that he was succeeded by Allummapees, and that his deposition was brought about by the powerful influences of the Iro- quois, who desired at the head of the Delaware Nation a chief in sympathy with their policies. It is Mercer's theory that Tammany thereafter lived in seclusion until his death in 1750, escaping the attention of the whites, though enjoy- ing a great reputation in his tribe. This view, while agree- able to those interested in the Bucks County legend, is not supported by facts, for Skalitchi was Chief of the Delawares in July, 1709,39 and was succeeded in 1715 by Allum- mapees, who \" actually shook himself to death with the ague,\" in October, 1747. Nevertheless, the tradition is still cherished, and the Bucks County Historical Society re- cently purchased the ground where the supposed Tammany was buried 40 and has selected a monument to be erected over the grave, bearing this inscription: To the Memory of the Celebrated Lenape Chieftain Tamenend once owner of this and all land between Neshaminy and Pen- nypack Creeks. These stones are placed at this spot near which an aged Indian, called Tammany by the pioneers of Bucks County was buried by white men about the year 1750.41 26 SAINT TAMMANY It is said that Tammany adopted the motto \" Kwanio Che Keeteru,\" which has been translated \"This is my right; I will defend it.\" 42 Horatio Hale, however, says the words are not of the Delaware language, but of Iroquois origin, and mean \" I am master wherever I am.\" The phrase is ancient, for in 1747 the Schuylkill Fishing Company pre- sented to the Association Battery a \" new thirty-two pounder \" cannon, which weighed between two and three tons, and on this gun were stamped the words said to have been the motto of the venerable Chief Tammany.44 This cannon was used during the Revolutionary War, and on April 23, 1883, the gun was restored to the \" State in Schuylkill \" on its grounds known as the \" Fish House Com- pany.\" The phrase was later adopted as the motto of the Society of the Sons of St. Tammany in Philadelphia.4* Other writers have ascribed to Tammany the motto \" Unite in peace for happiness and in war for defense.\" These mottoes were, of course, fictions of the white men, for the use of mottoes is a mark of civilization and culture. The only sign used by the Indians, so far as research shows, was a totemic device, the forerunner of the -heraldic symbol of the family. A rude reproduction of the device was painted in a conspicuous place on the Indian hut, an invitation and assurance of brotherly aid and protection to passers-by hon- oring the same device.47 An interesting but vexatious phase of our inquiry con- cerning Tammany is presented by the Walam Olum, a rec- ord purporting to preserve the primitive legends and tradi- tions of the Lenni-Lenape. The legends were recorded in pictographs or hieroglyphics to perpetuate the chants by which the tribal legendary had been kept alive before the compilation of the \" Walam Olum.\" The Olum was first procured by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz in 1820, as a reward for a medical cure. The songs and chants TRADITIONS OF SAINT TAMMANY 27 were secured in 1822, and in 1833 Schmaltz made the trans- lation. Because of his unreliability — he was a discredited scientist, a tramp scholar, doing odd jobs for a living, at times a teacher, a prolific author, and a manufacturer and peddler of a nostrum or patent medicine — doubt has been cast on the authenticity of the work/8 The Olum is divided into five parts or chapters, and contains one hundred and eighty-four verses, varying in length from one to five lines. As a whole it represents the traditions of the Dela- wares with reference to the Creation, and the tribal migra- tion from the north or west to the Atlantic coast line. From the beginning of this migration to the advent of the white man, the nation was ruled by ninety-four chiefs, two of which dynasty, the thirty-first and the seventy-sixth, were named Tamenend. The reference in the Olum to Tamenend, the thirty-first chief, with the translation reads : ** Weminitis tamenend sakimanep nekohatami Eluwiwulit matemenend wemi linapi nitis payat Wtenk wulitma maskansisil sakimanep w'tamaganat. All being friendly, the Affable was chief, the first of that name. He was very good, this Affable, and came as a friend to all the Lenape. After this good one, Strong-Buffalo was chief and pipe- bearer. The reference to Tamanend, the seventy-sixth chief, f ollows : Lappi tamenend sakimanepit wemi langundit. Wemi nitis wemi takwicken sakima kichwon. Again an Affable was chief, and made peace with all, All were friends, all were united under this great chief. 28 SAINT TAMMANY If the Walam Olum be true, then the Tammany who reigned from 1683 to 1697, the period in which he dealt with Penn and his followers, was the third of his name, two others of that name having held the exalted position of Chief of the Nation before him. If we allow twenty-five years 50 as the average reign of each chief, the first \"Affable \" or \" Tamenend \" reigned about 800 years after the migration started, and about 1,500 years before the advent of the whites. By the same method of computation, the second \"Affable \" or \" Tamenend,\" the seventy-sixth Chief mentioned in the work, reigned about 1,900 years after the start of the migration, and about 450 years before the landing of the whites, or about the middle of the llth Cen- tury. Both chiefs are described as exceptional men and remarkable peacemakers, and both had power to unite the tribes, allay discord, and bring universal peace and happi- ness to the Nation. Thus it is possible that to these chiefs 51 rightfully belong the glory and fame that attach to the name of Tammany, and perhaps the missionaries and early writers who secured these legends and traditions from the Indians applied them indiscriminately to the only Tam- many of whom they knew. On the other hand, if the Walam Olum is rejected as unworthy of credence, this ex- planation of the source of the unearned attributes with which Tammany is credited falls- For we are inclined to agree with Brinton's view that authentic history tells us nothing about the migrations of the Lenape before we find them in the valley of the Delaware. There is no positive evidence that they arrived from the west; still less concerning their earlier wanderings. The true history of the Delaware be- gins with his association with civilized man.52 CANONIZATION 29 3. Canonisation. In 1698 the name of Tammany as a real person vanishes from our history, to reappear in 1771 in the guise of the Patron Saint of American Liberty. On December 24th o>f the latter year, a letter was written by William Eddis ** of Annapolis, in which he described \" St. Tamina \" as the saint revered by the Americans on that part of the continent, and tells us that the first of May was set apart as sacred to his memory. This is the first extant reference to Tammany as a saint. The development of the Tammany legend be- tween 1698 and 1771 has not been chronicled, but the fol- lowing paragraph in a letter from Ebenezer Hazard of Philadelphia to Dr. Jeremy Belknap,54 dated at Phila- delphia, June 14, 1784, gives some idea of the process by which the sanctification of Tammany was evolved : Tammany was an Indian Sachem, whether real or fictitious I do not know ; but the first day of May has long been con- sidered as his day. When I was a boy I used to wear in my hat upon that day a buck's tail, gilded, and a picture of an Indian (Tammany, no doubt), shooting a deer with a bow and arrow. We used to talk of King Tammany then but it seems he has been canonized since the Declaration of Inde- pendence, and has now become a Saint. He will make as good an one as any in the Calendar; though I have not heard that he has been approved by his Holiness. However, as he is, I suppose, to be the titular Saint of Pennsylvania, and Pennsyl- vania is one of the United States, Congress ought to have been consulted about it. Should the \" balance of Power \" between the States be destroyed by this accession of weight to the Penn- sylvania Scale, it would be a sad affair. This same saint's day is kept principally by natives of this state; but I apprehend anybody might be admitted who would pay his club towards a good time and liquors to get drunk with.55 30 SAINT TAMMANY To this letter Dr. Belknap replied from Dover, N. H., in part as follows: I thank you for the account of King or Saint Tammany, who is a being of about as much importance to your bucks as St. Patrick is to the Hibernians, or St. Cuff ee to the Negroes : i. e.f he serves to give them a yearly feast ; but I dare say his votaries are not content with such fare as St. Tammany himself lived on.50 Inasmuch as Hazard was born in 1744, his recollection does not carry the celebration of Saint Tammany's Day back very far, although these festivities may have been held as early as 1752,67 when Hazard was but eight years old. He is mistaken, however, about the date of Tammany's canonization, for it is clear from the letter of Eddis that Tammany was on the Calendar of Saints at least five years prior to the Declaration of Independence. Many explana- tions of the canonization of Tammany have been expressed. Mr. Albert Matthews explains the anomaly in the following words : M Clearly, however, the need was felt for some native Saint as an offset to the foreign saints; and the Canonization of Tammany was doubtless a joke on the part of some facetious American. My guess is that the Canonization took place be- tween 1765 and 1771, or, in other words, was a manifestation of that opposition of the British Government which character- ized the stormy decade between the passage of the Stamp Act in 1765 and the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775. Another writer states : The custom of European nations to adopt some Saint as % patron, a relique of the early Monkish times, perhaps gave to an Indian Chief of the Leni Lenape (or Delaware) Tribe, the innocent prefixture, which the Mother Church allows only to those who have passed the ordeal of Canonization. Tammany, an Indian Chief, whose abode was one of the beautiful vallies CANONIZATION 31 which now form the neighborhood of Germantown, had dis- tinguished himself iby his urbanity and hospitality, his kindness and affection to the early settlers of this city ; and many anec- dotes are told of him, which would not dishonor the sanctity of those Saints whose names have a day appropriate, a legiti- mate place, in the Calendar.59 Some writers ascribe to John Trumbull the honor of being the first to enroll Tammany on the roster of saints, to check the Tory influence of societies such as St. George, St. An- drew and St. David, whose members were fervent in their loyalty to the King of Great Britain. We find this theory first enunciated in an anonymous work entitled \"A Brief Account of the Origin and Progress of the Tammany So- ciety; Who Saint Tammany was, and why the Society de- rived their Name from him,\" published in New York in 1838. A paragraph' from this work is perhaps the most con- vincing example of the inaccuracy and confusion of which writers adopting this view were victims. It reads as follows : A Mr. Trumbull, I believe, at the time, a gentleman of the bar, in Hartford, Con., author of Mr. Fingal's \" American Liberty Triumphant, or the Downfall of British Tyranny, and the death of General Montgomery,\" who contributed as much by his pen, as most others by the sword, in achieving the inde- pendence of his country. He saw the object of those royal associations, and to counteract their pernicious influence, and to form a rallying point for the friends of liberty, proposed to form a national society.60 What should it be called was the question? As most every Christian government in Europe had its national patron saint, they concluded to adopt one, and, as they were striving, or looking forward to found an inde- pendent American government, they did not wish to borrow a saint, and as modern saints were not held in high repute, they were induced to fix upon an aborigine, who of course must be a true American, and . . . they fixed upon an Indian Chief of the Delaware tribe. 32 SAINT TAMMANY R. G. Horton, writing some twenty years later, accepts this view and gives it the added weight of positive affirma- tion. In the following sentence he saddles this palpable error on the subsequent course of historical treatment of the subject : \" To John Trumbull, the author of the clever- est imitation of Hudibras which has ever been written, it is said, belongs the distinction of first originating the desig- nation of ' St. Tammany.' \" 61 However, a careful examination of the works of Trum- bull and his contemporaries of the Connecticut school of poets, \"The Hartford Wits,\"62 fails to reveal a single allusion to Saint Tammany. In fact the name seems to have been wholly unfamiliar to New England.63 More- over, although Trumbull was the author of \" M'Fingal,\" a caustic -satire on England's oppressive attitude toward the colonies, he was not the author of \" Mr. Fingal's American Liberty Triumphant, or the Downfall of British Tyr- anny, and the death of General Montgomery,\" 65 as our anonymous writer so confidently asserts. Nor did he pro- pose to form a national society to counteract the influence of \" those royal associations.\" For the idea of the forma- tion of a national society came long after the formation of the early societies of Saint Tammany, and is plainly trace- able to John Pintard, whose effort is discussed in the next chapters. It is clear that the author of this anonymous pamphlet, who states in his preface that he had \" only to observe that the author was born in the year 1769,\" was writing from memory and had confused (he was then 69 years of age) the works o>f John Trumbull with those of John Leacock; 66 for Leacock was the author of a comedy published at Philadelphia in 1776, entitled \" The fall of British Tyranny ; or, American Liberty triumphant. The first campaign, a tragi-comedy of five acts, as lately planned at the Royal Theatrum Pandemonium, at St. CANONIZATION 33 James's. The principal place of action in America.\" On April 30, 1776, a song taken from this comedy appeared in the Pennsylvania Evening Post*8 published at Phila- delphia. It contained the first reference to Tammany as America's Patron Saint, and, appearing shortly after the first skirmish of battle with Great Britain, became extrav- agantly popular with the patriots. It was sung at all cele- brations of the Tammany Societies,69 and to its strains the Sons of Tammany marched to their festivals. After its publication the song is mentioned as a part of the cere- monial of almost every celebration in honor of Saint Tam- many, and, because of its significant influence upon his na- tional canonization, it is quoted here in full: THE FIRST OF MAY, A NEW SONG, IN PRAISE OF ST. TAM- MANY, THE AMERICAN SAINT. (Tune, The Hounds are all out, &c.70) \" Of St. George, or St. Bute, let the poet Laureat sing, Of Pharaoh or Pluto of old, While he rhimes forth their praise, in false, flattering lays, I'll sing of St. Tamm'ny the bold, my brave boys. \" Let Hibernia's sons boast, make Patrick their toast, And Scots Andrew's fame spread abroad, Potatoes and oats, and Welch leeks for Welch goats, Was never St. Tammany's food, my brave boys. \" In freedom's bright cause, Tamm'ny pled with applause, And reason'd most justly from nature; For this, this was his song, all, the day long; Liberty's the right of each creature, brave boys. \" Whilst under an oak his great parliament sat, His throne was the crotch of the tree ; With Solomon's look, without statutes or book, He wisely sent forth his decree, my ibrave boys. 34 SAINT TAMMANY \" His subjects stood round, not the least noise or sound, Whilst freedom blaz'd full in each face: So plain were the laws, and each pleaded his cause ; That might Bute, North and Mansfield disgrace, my brave boys. \" No duties, nor stamps, their blest liberty cramps, A king, tho' no tyrant, was he ; He did oft'times declare, nay sometimes wou'd swear, The least of his subjects were free, my brave boys. \" He, a king of the woods, of the rivers and floods, Had a right all beasts to control ; Yet, content with a few, to give nature her due : So gen'rous was Tammany's soul ! my brave boys. \" In the morn he arose, and a-hunting he goes, Bold Nimrod his second was he; For his breakfast he'd take a large venison steak, And despis'd your flip-flops and tea, my brave boys. \" While all in a row, with squaw, dog and bow, Vermilion adorning his face, With feathery head he rang'd the woods wide : St. George sure had never such grace, my brave boys. \" His jetty black hair, such as Buckskin saints wear, Perfumed with ibear's grease well smear'd, Which illum'd the saint's face, and ran down apace, Like the oil from Aaron's old beard, my 'brave boys. \" The strong nervous deer, with amazing career, In swiftness he'd fairly run down; And, like Sampson, wou'd tear wolf, lion or bear. Ne'er was such a saint as our own, my brave boys. \" When he'd run down a stag, he behind him wou'd lag ; For so noble a soul had he ! He'd stop, tho' he lost it, tradition reports it, To give him fresh chance to get free, my brave boys. CANONIZATION 35 \" From his quiver he drew forth an arrow so keen; And seiz'd fast his imperial bow; It flew straight to the heart, like an Israelite dart ; Could St. Andrew ever do so, my brave boys? \" With a mighty strong arm, and a masculine bow, His arrow he drew to the head, And as sure as he shot, it was ever his lot, His prey it fell instantly dead, my brave boys. \" His table he spread where the vension bled, Be thankful, he used to say ; He'd laugh and he'd sing, tho' a saint and a king, And sumptuously dine on his prey, my brave boys. 11 Then over the hills, o'er the mountains and rills, He'd caper, such was his delight ; And ne'er in his days, Indian history says, Did lack a good supper at night, my brave boys. \" On an old stump he sat, without cap or hat, When supper was ready to eat, Snap, his dog, he stood by, and cast a sheep's eye ; For ven'son's the king of all meat, my brave boys. \" Like Isaac of old, and both cast in one mold, Tho' a wigwam was Tamm'ny's cottage, He lov'd sav'ry meat, such that patriarch eat, Of ven'son and squirrel made pottage, brave boys. \" When four score years old, as I've oft'times been told, To doubt it, sure, would not be right, With pipe in his jaw, he'd buss his old squaw, And get a young saint ev'ry night, my brave 'boys. \" As old age came on, he grew blind, deaf and dumb, Tho' his sport, 'twere hard to keep from it, Quite tired of life, bid adieu to his wife, And blaz'd71 like the tail of a comet, brave boys. 36 SAINT TAMMANY \" What country on earth, then, did ever give birth To such a magnanimous saint? His acts far excel all that history tell, And language too feeble to paint, my ibrave boys. \" Now, to finish my song, a full flowing bowl I'll quaff, and sing all the long day, And with punch and wine paint my cheeks for my saint, And hail ev'ry First of Sweet May, my brave boys.72 Painstaking research has failed to reveal an earlier reference to Saint Tammany, as a national figure, and John Leacock is alone entitled to credit for popularizing the Indian chieftain as America's patron saint.73 The influence of Saint Tammany and the activities of his votaries subsequent to 1771 are readily followed, but the changes and events of the seventy-three years imme- diately preceding that date are veiled in mystery. The arrowheads of history, however, indicate that the trans- formation of the Delaware chieftain into the patron saint of America had origin in Pennsylvania, and that his canoni- zation was not spontaneous, nor was it due to the genius or facetiousness of any individual. Although the intolerant attitude of the home government toward the American colonies aided in making St. Tam- many a popular figure and gave an added impetus to the early movement of the Tammany Societies, it is evident that their development was not solely a manifestation of hos- tility to British suppression. Careful research reveals that the canonization of Tammany may be traced to the Schuyl- kill Fishing Company, a society established in 1732 by Quakers of Philadelphia.74 According to the tradition of this club, certain Indian chiefs, including Tammany, granted to its members and their successors the right to fish and hunt within defined limits in the waters of the CANONIZATION 37 Schuylkill and the adjacent woods. Each year the sport- ing season opened on May first, which became a day of celebration and festivity to members of the club. The society adopted Tammany as its Patron and Saint, and May first was assigned as his day. On October 11, 1782, when victory for the American colonists seemed assured, the Club, which had become known as the \" Colony in Schuylkill,\" changed its name to the \" State in Schuylkill \" and adopted new by-laws, among which we note the following: \" 10th. There shall be the following meetings of the Gov- ernor and Council annually. . . . One on the first of May, to commemorate the day of our illustrious Saint and Patron, St. Tammany.\" This custom of adopting patrons is of remote origin, prac- ticed among the guilds and trades of ancient Greece and Rome,75 and, in the Middle Ages, adopted by govern- ments, which denominated Saints of the Church as their patrons. Later societies also selected saints, from whom their ideals were derived, and to whom their activities were dedicated. The Schuylkill Fishing Company, in conformity with this custom, most naturally selected as its patron saint the Indian chief, who, thirty-five years before the Society was organized, inhabited that region, and who sold to William Penn the very ground on which 'stood the \" State House \" of the Society. It also adopted as its motto the words said to have been the favorite maxim of the Chief.76 Following this society, two other fishing clubs 7T were organized on the banks of the Schuylkill prior to the Revolution, and on every first of May the season was opened with much ceremony. As the clubs grew in importance and prestige, their celebrations gained in so- cial splendor and spread through Philadelphia and its vicinity the fame of the original club's saint and patron. Slowly his name found its way into print. From the 38 SAINT TAMMANY meagre data at hand, it would seem that the appellation \" Saint \" was not generally accepted at Philadelphia until 1773, for in May, 1772, the name, so far as we can learn, first appeared in print in Philadelphia as \" King Tam- many,\" 8 when the \" Sons of King Tammany \" held their first meeting. However, on June 14, 1772, the name appears in the public press as \" King (or Saint) Tam- many,\" 79 and by 1773 his claim to canonization was well established, and his right to a place 0*1 the Calendar of Saints publicly recognized. On April 28, 1773, the fol- lowing notice of a meeting of the Sons of Saint Tammany 'made its appearance : 80 The Natives of this flourishing Province determined to fol- low so laudable a custom, and for some years past have adopted a great warrior sachem and chief named Tammany, a fast friend to our forefathers, to be the tutelar Saint of this Prov- ince, and have hitherto, on the 1st of May, done the accustomed honors to the memory of so great and celebrated a personage. A few days later, May 1, 1773, Miss Sarah Eve, who resided near Philadelphia, made the following note in her journal : 81 \" This morning was ushered in by the ring- ing of bells, in honor of King Tammany, as he was used to be called, but now, I think, they have got him canonized, for he is now celebrated as St. Tammany.\" The invitation of April 28, 1773,80 indicates clearly that Tammany had been known as \" Saint \" for some years, despite the apparent lack of recognition in the public press, and that he had been unofficially adopted as the tutelar Saint of the Province of Pennsylvania. After 1765 Philadelphia was the center of heated dis- cussions of England's tyranny, and when the Revolution 'broke out the Pennsylvania troops quite naturally adopted their Provincial Saint as Patron and Guide.82 This example was followed by the Continental Army, and dur- CANONIZATION 39 ing the War the-natal day of Saint Tammany was reve- rently celebrated both at home and on the field. This observance was continued by the army long after the con- clusion of War, until discontinued by order of General Dearborn, and then only as a part of the policy of retrench- ment instituted by President Jefferson.83 The passing of Tammany as a heathen chief and his accession to the dignity of our Patron Saint are marked by progressive steps. He first appears as the patron of a social club in Philadelphia; in 1773 he is the tutelary Saint of the Province of Pennsylvania, and during the Revolution he is Patron and Guide to the Continental Army. In 1773 his canonization was widely recognized, and by the year 1786 the regard for Saint Tammany was so great that he was well established as our National Saint.84 Be- tween 1773 and 1789, in the process of evolution from the obscurity of a local patron to the dignity of a national figure, his glory and achievements were celebrated in story and song. The annual celebrations of the Sons of Saint Tam- many of Philadelphia were usually graced by the delivery of an ode or poem dedicated to the memory of the Saint and his day.85 Tnree poems delivered on these occasions are repeated here, as typical of the eulogies offered in his honor : CHARACTER OF ST. TAMMANY.86 \" When superstition's dark and haughty plan Fetter'd the genius, and debas'd the man, Each trifling legend was as truth receiv'd ; The priest invented, and the crowd believ'd. Nations adorn'd the whim in stone and paint, And gloried in the fabricated saint. Some holy guardian, hence, each nation claims, Gay France her Denis, and grave Spain her James ; 40 SAINT TAMMANY Britons two mighty saints at once obey ; ' Andrew and George maintain united sway ' ; O'er humbler lands the same old whim prevails ; Ireland her Patrick boasts, her David, Wales. We, Pennsylvanians, these old tales reject, And our own saint think proper to elect ; Immortal Tammany, of Indian Race! Great in the field, and foremost in the chace ! No puny saint was he, with fasting pale ; He climb'd the mountain, and he swept the vale ; Rush'd through the forest with unequalled might; Your ancient saints would tremble at the sight: Caught the swift boar, and swifter deer with ease, And work'd a thousand miracles like these. To public views he added private ends, And lov'd his country most, and next his friends ; With courage long he strove to ward the blow (Courage we all respect, ev'n in a foe) ; And when each effort he in vain had tried, Kindled the flame36 in which he bravely died ! To Tammany let well-fill' d horns go round ; His fame let ev'ry honest tongue resound. With him let ev'ry gen'rous patriot vie, To live in freedom, or with honour die ; Nor shall I think my labor too severe, Since ye, wise sachems, kindly deign to hear.

Most of the legends of this chief and his remarkable per- formances obtained currency through two sources : ( 1 ) an oration delivered by Samuel L. Mitchill before the Tam- many Society or Columbian Order in the City of New York on May 12, 1795; and (2) the reports of missionaries among the Delaware Indians, as exemplified by John G. B. Heckewelder, a Moravian. Mitchill 89 gives in his oration a stirring account of Tammany as warrior, hunter, lawgiver, diplomat, doctor, farmer and peacemaker, and describes in harrowing detail a sanguinary conflict between Tammany and the Evil Spirit, from which the chief at length emerges victorious. Finally, the orator tells us, Tammany, too old to rule, abdicated in favor of a younger man, and some years afterward was laid to rest near Muskingum, Ohio, where a great mound of earth was erected over his grave. In 1809 William L. Marcy delivered an oration entitled \"A traditional account of the life of Tammany, an Indian Chief,\" before the Tammany Society of Troy, New York.90 While Marcy states that he derived his informa- SOURCES OF LEGENDARY 47 tion \" from the uncertain light of tradition, which often bewilders the most inquisitive reseaches, by the apparent inconsistency of facts and seeming irreconciliations of chronology,\" a glance at the work shows that it is based entirely on Mitchill's oration, although presented from a different point of view. Subsequent writers dealing with Tammany have fallen into the serious error of assuming that Mitchill intended to give an authentic life of Tammany, and they have freely followed his lead. In a letter dated August 9, 1811, Mitchill, however, made known that the work was a crea- tion of the imagination, and not intended to be taken seriously. This letter, which was addressed to B. F. Thompson, the historian of Long Island, has been pre- served, and reads as follows : 91 New York, Aug. 9, 1811. My dear Sir: I thank you for your ingenious and patriotic oration to the Columbian Order, for our last National New Year's Day. I shall preserve it among the mementoes of my valued acquain- tance. If I can find any where a copy of my long talk on the life, exploits, and precepts of Tammany, I will certainly send it to you. The only copy that I have is bound up with various other pamphlets, and very inconvenient to be sent abroad. It is a large octavo volume. The society gave the orator but a few copies ; and they were begged away by parents who wished •to read to their children, the advice given by Tammany to the tribes of his people. But the printer, who published it, is since dead; and I know not who purchased his stock. I wish, with all my heart, I could get a copy for you. It was a sportive thing, done during a time when I had in- flamed eyes, and could not bear the light; at a period, too, when political fervor was very hot, just when Mr. Jay had i/ succeeded in his election as Governor of the State. I intended 48 SAINT TAMMANY the composition to be a sort of moral romance ; yet what was my surprise to find it considered 'by both political parties a deep Political Allegory! The Democrats on one side and the Federalists on the other, discovered manifold meanings that had never occurred to me, and their respective significations were as opposite as their ways of thinking. One thing remarkable grew out of my Tammanial address. A copy by some means fell into the hands of the Earl of Buchan. He presented it to the Society of Scottish Anti- quaries; and I shortly after received a certificate from Edin- burgh, of having been elected a member. So much for our fetich Saint and Sage. It will be gratifying to me to receive your essay on Tobacco; though I am somewhat of a smoker of cigars myself. I am satisfied I shall read it with satisfac- tion, although Sir J. Sinclair has proved that the moderate use of it does not shorten life an hour. Truly and with much esteem, Yours, SAM'L L. MITCHILL. The influence of the early missionaries and their reports upon the history and traditions of Tammany may be dis- missed with the consideration of the works of their leading commentator, Heckewelder. Heckewelder, long a mission- ary among the Delawares, was strongly prejudiced in their favor, and unconsciously colored many of their traditions. He had only a speaking knowledge of the Delaware mis- sion dialect, and many of his conjectural interpretations of their customs fell wide of the mark.92 He taught at the Moravian Missions at Friedenhutten and Sheshequin, Pennsylvania, from 1765 to 1771, and then, becoming an Evangelist, went with David Zeisberger among the Dela- wares in Ohio. Upon his return to Bethlehem, Pa., in 1810, he devoted his time to literary pursuits, and in 1819 published his work on the Delaware Indians. This work SOURCES OF LEGENDARY 49 contains the following lofty estimate of the Delaware Sachem : 93 The name of Tamanend is held <in the highest veneration among the Indians. Of all the Chiefs and great men which the Lenape Nation ever had, he stands foremost on the list. But although many fabulous stories are circulated about him among the whites, but little of his history is known. The misfortunes which have befallen some of the most beloved and esteemed personages among the Indians since the Euro- peans came among them, prevent the survivors from indulg- ing in the pleasure of recalling to mind the memory of their virtues. No white man who regards their feelings will intro- duce such subjects in conversation with them. All we know, therefore, of Tamanend, is that he was an ancient Delaware Chief, who never had his equal. He was in the highest degree endowed with wisdom, virtue, prudence, charity, affability, meekness, hospitality, in short, with every good and noble qualification that a human being may pos- sess. He was supposed to have had an intercourse with the Great and Good Spirit; for he was a stranger to everything that is bad. When Colonel George Morgan, of Princeton in New Jersey, was about the year 1776, sent by Congress as an agent to the Western Indians, the Delawares conferred on him the 'name of Tamanend, in honor and remembrance of their ancient Chief, and as the greatest mark of respect which they could show to that gentleman, who they said had the same address, affability and meekness as their honored chief, and therefore ought to be named after him. The name of this great man extended even among the whites, who fabricated numerous legends respecting him, which I never heard, however, from the mouth of an Indian, and therefore believe to be fabulous. In the Revolutionary War his enthusiastic admirers dubbed him a Saint, and he was es- tablished under the name of St. Tammany, the Patron Saint of America. His name was inserted in some calendars, and his festival celebrated on the first day of May in every year. 50 SAINT TAMMANY Heckewelder was in Ohio at the time \" The Prophet,\" the Shawanese agitator, was in the zenith of his power. The influence of the Prophet was strong among the Dela- wares, who were at that time the friends and allies of the Shawanese, and they doubtless related to Heckewelder stories concerning this remarkable contemporary. The inaccuracy of Heckewelder's commentaries is exhibited by his mistake concerning so intimate a fact as the identity of the Prophet,95 whom the commentator mistook for the Prophet's brother, Tecumseh. That Heckewelder confused the stories related about the Prophet, with legends asso- ciated with the name of Tammany, is apparent from his account of an alleged tradition that Tammany had inter- course with the Great Spirit. This was the cardinal pre- tension of the Prophet, according to so reliable an authority as Thomas Jefferson. We quote from a letter written by Jefferson to John Adams : 96 Monticello, April 12, 1812. Dear Sir: . . . The Wabash Prophet is more rogue than fool, if to 'be a rogue is not the greatest of all follies. He rose to notice while I was in the administration, and be- came, of course, a proper subject for me. The inquiry was made with diligence. His declared object was the reformation of his red brethren, and their return to their pristine manner of living. He pretended to be in constant communication with the Great Spirit, that he was instructed by him to make known to the Indians that they were created by him distinct from the whites, of different natures for different purposes, and placed under different circumstances adapted to their Natures and destinies ; that they must return from all the ways of the whites, to the habits and opinions of their fore-fathers. Another influence upon the growth of these traditions may be found in the subserviency of the Delawares to the SOURCES OF LEGENDARY 51 Iroquois Confederacy, for it is more than probable that in recognizing the powerful suzerainty of their overlords, the Delawares adopted and perhaps confused with their own the legends and traditions of the Iroquois. At the time William Penn arrived in America, the Delawares were com- pletely under the influence of the Five Nations. At a coun- cil held in Philadelphia on July 6, 1694, Hithquoquean, speaking for the Delawares, acknowledged their humiliat- ing subjection in a few words: \"We have allways been a peacable people, and resolving to live so, and being but week and verie few in numbers, cannot assist you.\"9 At this time the Delawares were rapidly declining in strength and spirit, and doubtless absorbed the traditions and institutions of the Iroquois. It is probable, therefore, that the traditions of the Iroquois came to be considered a part of the history of the Delawares. Thus it is likely that the exploits of the great Hiawatha have been unjustly ascribed to Tammany, and that the missionaries and even the Delawares themselves in later years98 perpetuated this confusion. The traditions that are credited to Tam- many closely correspond with stories of the achievements of Hiawatha. Hiawatha was a warrior, a lawgiver, a reformer and a diplomat, and aimed to bring universal peace and contentment to the American Indian, a purpose cred- ited to both Tamenends in the Walam Olum. By his genius, perseverance and tact, he succeeded in uniting the various Indian tribes that were constantly at war with one another, and in establishing a Confederacy of Nations that was America's first great political organization. His influence shaped the history of the American continent, for the Iroquois Confederacy, the creation of his genius, was the bulwark against which the southward trend of French ambi- tion for a colonial empire was shattered and spent. This made possible the American Union. 52 SAINT TAMMANY In contrast to this remarkable figure, Tammany stands as a mere name, leaving no memorial o<f epoch-making accom- plishment or institution of permanence among his people. Through the arbitrary selection of his name by writers of romance, and through the blunders and confusion of the early missionaries, and perhaps of the Delawares them- selves, the glory and the fame of right belonging to the talented Hiawatha have been attributed to Tammany.\" The real Tammany, it must be concluded, was a chief of ordinary attainments, who made little impression on his white contemporaries, and whose conduct in no wise influ- enced the history of the land in which he lived. His notable virtues and fancied deeds are wholly incongruous with his recorded characteristics and achievements, and the eager veneration bestowed upon this pagan saint finds no warrant either in historic fact or in relevant legendary to any extent commensurate with the dignity and grandeur of his fame. NOTES TO CHAPTER I. 1. The word \"Amerind\" is a composite of the words American and Indian to denote all the Indians on the Ameri- can hemisphere as distinguished from the natives of India and elsewhere. It was adapted by the well-known explorer and anthropologist, Major John W. Powell, founder and one-time director of the United States Bureau of Ethnology; other ethnologists have since made use of the word, believ- ing it to be \" correct, convenient and comprehensively ex- pressive.\" See A History of Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania (Wilkes-Barre, Penna., 1909), by Oscar Jewell Harvey, 1 :78. 2. The name of Hiawatha is made famous in our literature by Longfellow in his poem \" The Song of Hiawatha.\" Long- fellow based his poem on the distortion of the legend of Hiawatha, by Schoolcraft who, in his usual unreliable way, confused Hiawatha with Manabozho, a fantastic deity of the Ojibways; and thus by an historian's lack of scholarship, and the errors of a poet, \" a grave Iroquois lawgiver of the fif- teenth century has become in modern literature an Ojibway demigod.\" The Term Indian Summer (Boston, 1902), by Albert Matthews, p. 46. See Note 4. 3. A biographical sketch of St. Tammany or a monograph on the Tammany Societies would be incomplete without a brief reference to the Delaware Indians and their traditions. The first white settlers in Pennsylvania found the eastern part occupied by the Lenni-Lenape or Delaware Indians, the most numerous, powerful and exalted tribe of the eastern Algonquin confederacy and to whom special dignity and authority were assigned. Forty tribes, it is said, respected their command. The Delawares took first place as the \" grandfathers \" of the Algonquin family, and the associated tribes were called \" chil- dren,\" \" nephews,\" and \" grandchildren.\" The proper tribal name of these Indians was and still is Lenape; they called S3 54 SAINT TAMMANY themselves Lenni-Lenape, meaning \" true or manly men.\" The phrase, however, has been variously translated as \" our men,\" \" males of our kind,\" \" Indian men,\" \" the original or pure Indian,\" 4< the Indians of our tribe or nation,\" \" peo- ple of the same nation,\" \" men of our nation,\" \" original or pure people,\" and \" original people.\" As early as 1694, the name \" Delaware \" was applied to them, and by 1715 the ap- pellation had become firmly affixed. Heckewelder, in his History of the Indian Nations, says that he will remembers when \" they [the Lenape] thought the whites had given the name ' Delaware ' in derision ; but they were reconciled to it on being told that it was the name of a great White Chief, Lord de La Warre. As they were fond of being named after distinguished men, they were rather pleased, considering it a compliment.\" The Lenape lived on the banks of the Delaware River in detached tribes under different sachems and occupied the en- tire valley from its source to its mouth, extending westward to the territory of the Susquehannock, and eastward over the entire area of New Jersey to the Hudson River. The \" Nation,\" as the tribe was called, was divided into three clans or totems, each having its totemic symbol or device, through which it claimed a mystic descent: (1) The Minsi, Monsey, Munsee, Montheys, or Minisink, \"The people of the stoney country \" or \" mountaineers,\" whose totemic sign or device was the wolf. They lived in the mountainous region at the headwaters of the Delaware, above the forks or junction of the Lehigh River. Their hunting ground swept over lands now embraced in three states, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and in the Minisink Plains a short distance above the Delaware Water Gap their principal fire was lo- cated. They were the most vigorous and warlike of the Lenape and excelled the other totems in numbers. (2) The Unami, Wonamey or Wanamie, \" the people down the river,\" whose totemic sign or device was the turtle or tortoise. They occupied the territory on the right bank of the Delaware, ex- tending southward from the Lehigh Valley. This totem en- NOTES TO CHAPTER I 55 joyed a position of great dignity among the Lenape, for they shared with people of the old world the myth that a great tortoise, first of all created beings, bore the earth upon its back. Thus by their totem the Unami had precedence, and in time of peace their sachem or chief, wearing a diamond- V marked wampum belt, was chief of the whole tribe. (3) The Unalachtigo, \" people who live near the ocean \" or \" the tide- water people,\" whose totemic sign or device was the turkey. This tribe had its principal seat on the affluents of the Dela- ware River near the present site of the City of Wilmington. This proud and powerful nation once held undisputed sway over the eastern part of the American Continent, but some time prior to 1694 they were conquered by the Iroquois Con- federacy, or Five Nations, and reduced to a humiliating con- dition of political vassalage known as \" women.\" In this state of subjection they occupied the unenviable position of non-combatants, were denied the privileges of bearing arms and engaging in warfare, and were under the constant super- vision of the Five Nations, who looked upon them with the utmost contempt. Although the exact date of their sub- jugation is unknown, various dates ranging from 1609 to 1725 have been suggested; the minutes of a meeting of the Penn- sylvania Provincial Council, held on July 6, 1694, clearly indi- cate, however, that at that time the Delawares were under the domination of the Iroquois. The startling success of the Five Nations in their bitter struggle with the Delawares is readily traceable to the introduction of firearms among the Iroquois tribes, who dealt with the followers of Champlain and with the Dutch settlers in the upper Hudson and Mohawk valleys. In 1683 the tribe was already on the decline, its number in Pennsylvania being estimated at two thousand; the en- croachment of the whites gradually forced the Delawares westward, first to the Wyoming valley, then to western Penn- sylvania, and later to Ohio. From Ohio some migrated to Canada, while the main body removed to Indiana, thence to Missouri and later to Kansas; and in 1866 the remnant set- tled in Indian Territory, where they now share a reservation 56 SAINT TAMMANY with the Cherokee Nation. Here the tribal bonds are slowly dissolving and the tribe is gradually losing its identity. See: Harvey as cited, 1:78 et seq.

The Iroquois, \" an island in the great ocean of the Al- gonquin tribes,\" occupied central and western New York. The confederacy was made up of the Mohawks, Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas and Cayugas, and was organized about the middle of the 15th century. The founder of the league was Hi-a-watha (Da-ga-no-we-da), chief of the'Onondaga Na- tion, \" who was the incarnation of wisdom \" and \" whose power was equal to his intelligence.\" He long beheld with grief the evils that befell the Indian tribes through continual wars and accordingly elaborated a scheme for a vast confed- eration of Indian nations to insure universal peace. With a view to the realization of this ideal, he invited the chiefs and wise men of the five tribes to a peace conference on the north- ern shore of Lake Onondaga to discuss the terms and condi- tions of the compact that was to control their future des- tinies. After days of debate and deliberation, the confederacy of the Five Nations was formed and its first council-fire kindled. The federation was remarkable in construction and ideals and included in its scope the establishment of peace and NOTES TO CHAPTER I 57 amity among all tribes of men. To quote the historian Lossing : \" The Iroquois Confederacy was a marvel, all things considered . . . and a practical example of an almost pure democracy most remarkably developed.\" In 1729 the Tuscaroras, who had migrated northward from the Carolinas, were admitted as the sixth member of the league. Spurred on by a thirst for military glory and conquest, the Iroquois subdued all the Indian tribes from the Hudson to the Mississippi and from the great lakes to the Carolinas, enjoy- ing at the time of the discovery of America a complete hege- mony over this vast empire.

Tammany has been referred to in several works as Amer- ica's untutored Crichton (History of Tammany Hall, by Har- mon C. Westervelt, MS. in New York Public Library. The significance of this comparison, however, is not easy to divine, for the Crichton referred to undoubtedly was James Crichton, a Scotch scholar, linguist and poet, so skilled in dialectic and so amiable in character, that he became famed throughout Europe as the Admirable Crichton. He was the son of Robert Crich- ton, Lord Advocate of Scotland under Mary and James VI., and was born at Eliock, Dumfriesshire, in 1560. He received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from St. Salvator's College, St. Andrew's, in 1574, and the degree of Master of Arts in 1575. So talented was he, and so wonderful was his memory, that he attracted attention wherever he appeared by the ex- tent and charm of his erudition. In his travels on the Conti- nent he met the Prince of Mantua, Vincenzo di Gorgaza, to whom he became companion and preceptor. On July 3, 1582, when only 22 years of age, he died at the hands of his pupil, the Prince, in a street brawl. The brilliance and popularity 58 SAINT TAMMANY of the youthful scholar became his undoing, for the Prince, inflamed by jealousy, plotted Crichton's destruction and, dis- guised as a brigand, stabbed him to death. The alleged parallel between this intellectual prodigy and our aboriginal hero is not to be found in the reputed attributes of the two characters. See: Life of Crichton, by P. F. Tytler.

Since the Indians themselves had little or no written language, accuracy in repetition was not assured by a fixed spelling, and the early settlers, who first transposed the names into their respective languages, were not endowed with those qualities incident to careful scholarship, which alone could have produced reasonably accurate interpretation of the Indian words. Moreover, it must be remembered that many times the same name comes to us through the media of differ- ent languages. Thus we may have an Indian name as it im- pressed the Dutch, the French, the Swedish, and the English settlers. And there is small wonder that we often fail to recognize a name in its various guises as the same appellation. The confusion is further heightened by the fact that Indian sachems frequently changed their names to fit especial occa- sions and by the carelessness of early writers in failing to recognize this custom. The name Tammany has appeared in various forms: in the body of the deed dated June 23, 1683 (see note 7), it takes the form \" Tamanen,\" while the mark affixed to the NOTES TO CHAPTER I 59 indenture is described as that of \"' Tammanens.\" In the joint deed given by Tammany and Metamequan on the same day, the name is spelled \" Tamanen \" and the description of the mark is \"\" Tamnen.\" And William Penn in his own hand- writing made the following endorsement on the back of the instrument : \" Metamequam's and Tamanaris conveyance to Proprietor and Governor\" (Penna. Archives, First Series, 1:65). On August 16, 1683, William Penn spelled the name \"Tamene\" (WTorks of Wm. Penn, London, 1782, IV:305). This despite the different interpretation of the name in the body of the joint deed of June 23, 1683, and his own use of the word as \" Tamanan,\" in the endorsement on its back. In the deed dated June 15, 1692, the name is spelled \" Taminent \" ( see note 11), while at a Council held in Philadelphia on July 6, 1694, the name is recorded in the minutes as \" Tamanee \" (see note 12). In the body of the deed dated July 5, 1697, the name appears as \" Taminy \" (see note 13). Francis von A. Cabeen, in his article on the \" Society of the Sons of Saint Tammany of Philadelphia\" (Penna. Mag. of History and Biography, XXV:436), in speaking of this deed says: \"He [Tammany] is described in the deed ... as the great sachem Tamaniens!' This is obviously an error on the part of Cabeen, for in none of the deeds signed by Tammany does his name appear in the form \" Tamaniens.\" In 1698 Gabriel Thomas wrote the name as \" Temeny,\" and on December 24, 1771, the name appears as \" Tamina \" (see note 16). Since 1772 the name has been variously written as \"Tamine\" (History of Philadelphia, by Scharf and West- cott, Vol. 1:38), \" Taimenend,\" \" Tamend,\" \" Teamonand \" (MS. correspondence of Colonel George Morgan in the Li- brary of Congress), \" Tamanend,\" \" Tamenund,\" \" Temania \" (Mrs. Sarah D. Mowry: Proceedings of the Delaware County, Penna., Historical Society, 1:77-80, \" Tamenend,\" \" Tam- anend,\" History of the Manners and Customs of the Indian Nations (Phila., 1819), by John G. B. Heckewelder, p. 300, \" Temend \" and \" Tamany \" (The Lenape and their Legends, by D. G. Brinton, pp. 41, 117, 251), \" Tamenay \" (The Last of 60 SAINT TAMMANY the Mohicans, Boston, 1876, by James Fenimore Cooper, p. 350), and finally we have it in its present form, \" Tammany.\" Heckewelder spells the name \" Tamanend \" and gives its significance as \" Affable.\" John D. Prince, Professor of Semitic Languages, at Columbia University, however, differs from Heckewelder, and in a letter to the author, dated August 10, 1910, says : \" Tammany was in its original form Tamenend or Tamenund, the vowels being rather indeterminate in Dela- ware, and consequently a, e, or u, being practically equivalent to a short ^-pronunciation. The meaning is given by Hecke- welder as ' affable,' but I fail to see how this can be so, as he evidently connects the word with the Delaware word for Beaver, ' tamakwi/ and translates it ' beaver-like/ and con- strues this to mean ' affable/ There is an Algonquin stem which appears in the Natick (Mass.) kindred dialect to Dela- ware, as tummuhouau l he is worthy, deserving,' the same stem appearing in the word kut-tamhouan-ganooash ' your deserts ' and also in the form at-tumunnum ' he receives, deserves it.' I believe that the Delaware Tamenend, Tamenund, Temenend is a participial form ending in-w^ the regular ending in Dela- ware, from the stem tame ' deserve ' or ' receive,' and that the name means ' the deserving ' or ' worthy one,' a very ap- propriate designation for an Indian chief of the importance of the original Tammany.\" Tammany as a Proper Name.
