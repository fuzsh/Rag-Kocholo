MORTON AND COMPANY fo l 1895 CNIVBB8ITT COPYRIGHTED BY RICHARD ELLSWORTH CALL 1895 TO THE MEMORY OF Constantino ^amuef NATURALIST PREFACE. HHHIS memoir had its inception in an attempt to clear •1 up certain matters connected with the synonymy of a large and important group of fresh -water mollusks — the UnionidcB, A number of very remarkable facts con nected with the personality of its subject were thus incidentally learned. As the collation of data proceeded the facts gathered seemed of sufficient importance to group them for presentation to the literary and scientific world, in the hope that a better and more intelligent understanding of this eccentric naturalist might result. A number of impressions were forced upon my attention as the work proceeded; among other conclusions reached was the one that Rafinesque had not been treated always fairly by his contemporaries. Resulting from this was the conviction that many naturalists now living have formed opinions concerning the nature and value of Rafinesque's work, which appear to me to be quite erroneous. In the hope that some of these misappre hensions might- be corrected the task of writing his life, which is quite a labor of love, was undertaken. THF. UHIVEB8ITI vi Preface. The Filson Club, an organization devoted primarily to the collection and preservation of original matter connected with the history of the State of Kentucky, has, since it recognizes Rafinesque as the first resident professor -naturalist within the limits of the State, been particularly interested in this memoir, and its aid has been freely extended in the matter of sumptuous publica tion. The intelligent interest and historical enthusiasm of Colonel R. T. Durrett, LL. D., the President of the Club, was early enlisted in the project, partly for the reasons above given and partly because of personal interest in the career of a most remarkable man. He freely offered access to his superb and unrivaled library of Kentuckiana, without which courtesy much, which now appears, must long have remained unknown. During the progress of this work numerous courtesies have been extended, and by various persons. To these especial thanks are due. Professor Howard M. Ballou, of the Louisville Manual Training High School, spent many days in the various libraries of Boston and Cam bridge in abstracting and verifying certain bibliographic matter; to his interest and zeal this portion of the brochure owes very much indeed; he has also rendered invaluable aid in proof-reading as the several signatures came from the press. Doctor G. Brown Goode, Assistant Preface. vii Director of the United States National Museum, Doctor Charles S. Sargent, Director of the Arnold Arboretum at Jamaica Plains, Mr. C. E. Faxon, of the same institu tion, Honorable Thomas Meehan, of Philadelphia, and W. H. Venable, LL. D., of Cincinnati, have all contrib uted valuable aid. Doctor Goode especially has cour teously furnished all the references to the rare Specchio delle Scienze, and has also verified others; he further has looked over the proofs of part of the bibliographic portion as they came from the printer, and has made numerous valuable suggestions. I desire to make especial mention of the aid afforded by Miss Johanna Peter, of Lexington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of a careful search through the Lexington Library, rich in old Kentucky books and newspaper files, and thus led to the discovery of many useful items. Mr. Alexander Griswold kindly photographed the pages for the plate illustrating the Florula Ludovic iana ; Doctor William T. Durrett did the same with the page for the plate from the Fishes of the River Ohio. Mrs. Asa Gray has courteously allowed the use of the letter to De Can- dolle, from among the letters left by Doctor Asa Gray, which is herein reproduced. To Doctor B. L. Robinson, Curator of the Herbarium at Harvard University, thanks are due for the opportunity to photograph the portrait viii Preface. of Rafinesque, which forms the frontispiece in the \"Analyse de la Nature,\" and which subserves the same purpose in this volume. To all these gentlemen and other helpers most cordial thanks are extended. Several important items connected with rare books were searched for and given me by Mr. Sidney M. Ballon, of Harvard University, for which grateful acknowledg ment is tendered. The portrait of Rafinesque, from the Wisconsin Historical Society, was permitted presenta tion through the generous courtesy of Honorable R. G. Thwaites, the Secretary. To our publishers especial acknowledgments are due for the pains taken to secure perfection in the sumptuous form of publication adopted. Their work needs no commendation. To the naturalists of America this brochure is sub mitted in the hope that it will at least aid in placing its remarkable subject in his proper place in the histoi^ of natural science in this country. Whether all will acquiesce in the conclusions reached is really a matter of very small moment. If there shall result an intelli gent estimate, favorable or otherwise, of the writings and botanical or other scientific work of Rafinesque; if those who have known him only through misinformation furnished by contemporaries, who, in all cases, were not wholly disinterested investigators, shall now have oppor- Preface. ix tunity to consult his published work, and shall be able, through it, to approve or condemn his course; if the tendency to ignore all of his work because some of it was peculiarly bad shall give way to a more generous treatment, then, the time required to collect and arrange the scattered matter which constitutes the bibliographic portion of this volume, and to present for inspection the whole course of an active though largely misdirected life, will be amply repaid. It is not true, notwithstand ing that the editor of a well-known scientific journal has but just editorially so declared, that recent identifications of Rafinesque's species \"will be ultimately set aside, when a more critical spirit prevails among species zoolo gists\"; on the contrary, outside of certain editorial rooms there prevails that spirit of honor and fairness which demands that these claims shall be recognized. The position thus editorially assumed is, in itself, a complete justification for the expenditure of the time and means involved in presenting, to men of science, this resume of the work and life of Rafinesque.

Familiarity with the work of others in the same fields is impossible to many; sympathetic interest on the part of others is unknown; fruitful methods which result from the successful expe rience of others are unheard of; means of publication of facts of value and of especial scientific , importance on first discovery are entirely wanting. Then, too, it often happens that communities which are far removed from the great urban centers have little appreciation of the life and work of the student of Nature, who is always open to the suspicion of mental derangement, or at least of being charitably regarded as \" eccentric\". Far more noticeable is this unfavorable feature in a country yet quite primitive. In such regions the indus- 2 The Life and Writings of tries and minds of the people are concentrated upon the single problem of making the unwilling earth yield an abundant store, or else directed to that other task of reclaiming a virgin forest and establishing a center of urban life and activity. Mental and scientific pursuits under these conditions receive little attention and less encouragement; in some unexplained manner it often happens that those who attempt to promote these objects meet with decided opposition. Such opposition is based chiefly upon the idea that matters of any sort, to be of value, must have reference solely to the real present and find expression in money values. Rare indeed is it, in these early communities, to find any adequate conception of the value of the work and time spent in the collection of plants and animals, of bugs and of fishes, of fossils and of clams. What matters it that one should know the life history of a single nocuous insect, or that he have full knowledge of the ways best to protect fishes in maintaining their existence in our streams ? Is not a bug, a bug, and a gar-pike, a gar-pike, for all that? So say they all! And stranger still, let such matters become subject for legislative appropria tions, and those who most directly are concerned stand in armed neutrality or else in aggressive opposition. Such is the common fate of propositions connected with Constantine Samuel Rafinesqtte. 3 the development of natural resources when the State is asked to aid. It follows from these considerations that one can not give a just estimate of the life and work of a man unless one regards well the times in which he lived, the prevail ing enthusiasms or their lack, the public knowledge on matters of this sort, the public appreciation of their value, and the other conditions of social and educational environment of which the scholar and student of men, or of language, or of Nature, is not wholly independent. The beginnings of scientific life in Kentucky were in just such surroundings as these pictured, and long remained unchanged. In such primitive scenes, though trained in an old and cultured community, the most active period of a most eventful life was passed; in estimating its value to us and to the State all these facts must have weight. BIRTH AND EARLY LIFE. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque [Schmaltz] was born in Turkey in Europe, in Galata, a suburb of Constanti nople, October 22, 1783. He was of French - German descent, his father being a French merchant of Mar seilles, while his mother,* though born in Greece, was *Died at Bordeaux, 1831. 4 The Life and Writings of of German parentage, from Saxony. The mercantile enterprises of his father reached to distant lands and often necessitated his absence from home for long periods at a time. There would seem to be but little question but that matters connected with his father's business ventures and their recital in the home of the lad had something to do with determining his future bent toward travel. The family was not a large one; Rafinesque had one only sister, who became a Mrs. G. Lanthois, of Bordeaux, whose name was never mentioned by our author save once, and a younger brother, Anthony Augustus. From the circumstance that Rafinesque speaks of this brother as his younger brother some have inferred that there was an older member of the group of sons, but if so it nowhere appears in any of his writings. More of the family is not known. The younger brother drops out of the record after 1805, having gone to France from Philadelphia, and thence to Sicily, and nothing further is known of him. Of the mother very little is known, but from the fragmentary items connected with the earlier education of Rafinesque it would appear that she was a most intelligent woman, and had great concern for the proper education of this son. The absence from home of the father natu rally placed almost the entire care of this phase of the Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 5 boy's home life in his mother's hands, and she seems to have performed her duty well and conscientiously. Rafinesque says* that in one of the numerous country seats about Marseilles he first became conscious of his existence, and there he received his first education. In his own words: \"It was there among the flowers and fruits that I began to enjoy life, and I became a Botanist. Afterwards the first premium I received in a school was a book on Animals, and I became a Zoologist and Natu ralist.\" There are some who profess to see in this state ment that Rafinesque had too high an appreciation of his powers, since a young man, or, rather, a mere boy, such as he then was, could have been neither a botanist nor a zoologist. Perhaps, however, the just interpretation will be the one Rafinesque himself intended, namely, that these books determined his career and that he dated his interest in scientific matters from that time. In 1793 his father died, a victim to the yellow -fever epidemic of that year which made such waste of life in Philadel phia, whither the merchant Rafinesque had gone to escape the English cruisers. The recollection of this fact afterward cost the son much trouble in a similar epidemic which obtained in Philadelphia, after Constan tine had himself become a resident of that city. * A Life of Travels and Researches in North America and South Europe, etc., p. 6. 6 The Life and Writings of The four years from 1792 to 1796 were passed in residence with his mother near Leghorn, in Italy, whither she had gone throngh fear connected with the excesses of the French Revolution. He had previously been taken to several other places by his parents, and this fact, coupled with his later travels, gives the raison d^tre of the French couplet which graces the title page of his \"Life.\" It reads: \" Un voyageur des le berce&u, Je le serais jusqrf au tombeau. . . .\" During his residence in Italy his education was di rected by private teachers, and geometry, geography, history, drawing and the English language engaged his attention. He developed a taste for reading, and found the greatest pleasure in books of travel, greedily devouring them all. He declares, probably in hyperbole, \" Before twelve years of age I had read the great Uni versal history and one thousand volumes of books on many pleasing or interesting subjects.\" It was while he dwelt at Leghorn that he began regular herborizations, in 1795, and commenced the formation of a herbal. From what he himself relates it would appear that dur ing this period he was allowed the fullest liberty and gave full bent to his whims or wishes, and read and studied what he pleased. He congratulates himself that Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, 7 lie had wasted no time on dead languages, \"but had spent it in learning alone and by mere reading ten times more than is taught in the Schools.\" In 1796 Rafinesque was taken to Genoa, and the journal of this tour constituted his first essay of the kind. In making mention of this journal he remarks that he had done the same ever since by notes or journals. His residence varied for the next few years between Genoa, Pisa, and Marseilles, during which period his training was successively in the care of his mother and grandmother, but was completed by himself. During these years also he continued his botanical studies and \"read every kind of books, good or bad; but happily I knew how to distinguish them.\" To his studies he now added natural and moral philosophy, chemistry, and medicine. It is not to be understood, I take it, from these remarks of Rafinesque about the direction assumed by his student-work at this time that he means to imply he had mastered these branches. He was an indefati gable reader and no doubt read every thing in the way of books that came to hand, and books on these subjects were among the number. In a curious and naive way he tells us about his nature studies in the neighborhood of Marseilles, where his botanical walks gave him much pleasure. He appears first of all to have devoted him- 8 The Life and Writings of self to the study of plants, but also gave much attention to other branches of natural history. He says: \" I had made to myself a small garden in a wild and remote place. I began the study of Fishes and Birds, I drew them and collected Shells and Crabs. Daudin, of Paris, who published then a natural history of Birds, was my first correspondent among the learned, and I communicated to him some observations on Birds. I drew maps, copied those of rare works, and took topographical surveys; these were my first essays in geography.\" In reading Rafinesque's account of a hunting episode which took place near Leghorn in 1802, one will be struck with the similarity of his experiences and those recorded by Charles Darwin, England's great naturalist.* Rafinesque says: \"I began to hunt, but the first bird I shot was a poor Parus, whose death appeared a cruelty to me, and I have never been able to become an unfeel ing hunter.\" Darwin had the same feeling for animals, even the very lowest, and never allowed himself to harm them wilfully or knowingly. The year 1802 marked, in the spring, the end of the youthful home life of Rafinesque. There appears in the record no evidences of interest in matters which should prove attractive to a boy of his years. Whether he ever had any fondness for boyish sports and games, » Vide Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Vol. I, p. 28, 1887. D. Apple- ton & Co., New York. Constantine Samuel Rafinesq^le. 9 whether he had much enjoyment in the association with other youths, whether these facts had not great influ ence in determining his attitude toward social events in after years can all be but matter of conjecture. In recounting the facts connected with his early life Raf- inesque omits very many important things which we should enjoy knowing, but enough is told us to explain the system or rather the lack of system in his studies. Perhaps this will explain the apparent want of those closer habits of application which characterize the best work of men of science. The record simply discloses that he essayed every branch of natural science, read oinnivorously, made copious notes, formed ideas which were often vague and never afterward matured, and always had before him the travels and work of the great men of his own and preceding decades; it appears, too, that he fondly imagined himself about to become, or that he had already become, a great traveler. It is really believed that this period of great mental activity and developing powers of observation, for such it cer tainly was, had he been firmly guided by some master hand, would have given the world one of its greatest naturalists. But the lack of coordination of powers led to habits, both of thought and literary effort, that had a serious influence, in after years, on his life and work. io The Life and Writings of FIRST VISIT TO AMERICA. Rafinesque first came to the United States, in com pany with his younger brother, Anthony Augustus, in the spring of 1802, \" provided with an adventure and many letters of introduction\". He landed in Philadel phia April 1 8th. With a mind keenly awake to nat ural objects it is not surprising that at once he again began the study of Nature, probably with fresh ardor born of new surroundings and a novel flora. Scarcely had he landed in his new home before he began botan izing, and found a cruciferous plant which had passed under the name of Draba verna; he considered it new and bestowed upon it the name of Draba americana. Whether a formal description of this plant was ever written by Rafinesque I know not; it is not mentioned ir Watson's \" Bibliographical Index to North American Botany\", which contains many other names formulated by Rafinesque, so it is to be presumed that he never presented it in such form. But he remarks of this species that \"the American Botanists would not believe me; but Decandole has even since made with it the new Genus Erophilal* This is the emblem of many * Watson, loc. cit., p. 62, regards both the genus and species of DeCandolle as synonyms, and retains the name of Draba verna. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. n discoveries of mine of which ignorance has doubted, till science has proved that I was right.\" To us, at this time, the interesting fact connected with the find ing of this specimen and supposed new species lies in the evidence which it affords that Rafinesque was for ever wedded to his loves, the flowers. Here he was, at the age of eighteen, in a new land, on fortune bent, in the midst of strangers who spoke a strange tongue, yet he at once turned to the woods and fields, a real student of Nature, and averse to any thing else. The Philadelphia business relations of Rafinesque were those which eventually determined his coming to Kentucky some eighteen years afterward. While in that city he came into relation with the Cliffords, owners of the vessel which brought him to America; also here he met the brothers Tarascon, formerly of Marseilles, whose names are familiar to all students of early Kentucky history. At this time Rafinesque was busied with mer cantile pursuits, occupying a clerkship, but filled all his leisure with botanizing in the vicinity of Philadelphia. He declares that during this period he minutely de scribed all the plants found, a task quite characteristic of the man! He had already determined upon follow ing the footsteps of his father, and devoted himself to mercantile pursuits, prosecuting his Nature studies in 12 The Life and Writings of hours of leisure, but withal with serious intent. But now came again the yellow fever, in the summer of 1802, of which Rafinesque writes: \"Being much afraid of this disorder, which had deprived me of a father, I left the city and took refuge in Germantown; where I had the good luck to be invited by Col. Forrest, a Friend of Horticulture, to dwell with him, and travel with him to collect Plants.\" This gave him a summer of travel and botany, for the scourge which he sought to escape did not disappear until the following October. A considerable number of excursions about Germantown, some of which extended into New Jersey and over Kast- ern Pennsylvania, were made during this period. While these were nothing more than botanical tramps, such as the veriest tyro is compelled to take who desires an acquaintance with the flora of any locality, Rafinesque dignifies them by the name of \"journies\"; in this pecul iarity he shows in a remarkable manner the influence of his early reading. If not yet such, he surely would be a veritable Marco Polo or von Humboldt! During this stay in Philadelphia Rafinesque had frequent opportunity to visit the botanical gardens of Marshall and Bartram, the former of which was not far away at West Chester. Attention will again be directed to these gardens in connection with a certain Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 13 experience of Rafinesque at Lexington, in Kentucky, years afterward; the reader will then remember that all about Marseilles, where Rafinesque had spent much of his boyhood life, are to be found botanical gardens in which he must often have been as student and collector. But the summer spent in plant -hunting and other scientific work, very congenial to the disposition of Rafinesque, had unfavorably disposed him toward a business life. The irksome quiet of the office had been relieved by a summer with the birds and flowers, and to his duties he returned with laggard feet. Not only did he not like the close confinement incident to a clerkship, but it may even be supposed that the emoluments of such a position in that early day were certainly not in excess of those of the present time; surely in such career those ever present dreams of wide travel and learned books could never become fact. In 1804 Rafinesque resigned his position in favor of his brother, of whom he makes no other mention for all this time, and became secretary to a gentleman by the name of Gernon. This position was also abandoned early in the spring of the following year; the place was one \"of no advantage\", and then he could not withstand the allurements of the forests and fields. His whole time was now given to the collection of the plants and 14 The Life and Writings of animals about the city, and also of those of the neigh boring States. He extended his tours into Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, for he had already foreseen that it was but a question of short time until he should leave America. He made the most of his opportunities and gathered large numbers of all things collectible. Thus passed the period until January, 1805, when both he and his brother,* \"who would follow\" him, set sail for Italy. In May he became a resident of Sicily. TEN YEARS IN SICILY. \"This lovely Island\" was reached after a delightful voyage, its presence having been foretold \"by the ema nations of orange blossoms, carried far at sea in the night by the land breeze.\" Says he, further, \"The mountains were smiling with flowers and verdure, they invited me to climb over them.\" He was now twenty- two years of age, enthusiastic, energetic, habitually care less both of his person and his methods of study, and about to enter upon a scientific career of the greatest moment. Here he began that extensive series of pub lications, record of which has been attempted in the accompanying bibliography. *This brother died at Havre, 1826, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 15 It is materially unfortunate, to our mind, that Raf- inesque does not, in his \"Life of Travels\", enter some what more into detail respecting his home life in Sicily. But one will search in vain for a single word on these topics. There seems to have been abundant reason for not mentioning these matters, for Rafinesque married, in 1809, a Sicilian woman by the name of Josephine Vaccaro, a woman who does not appear to have been suited to the kind of life the naturalist had marked out for himself. It is more than probable that this marriage was never consummated in legal form. In his will,* from which alone this information is obtained, he says: \"While residing in Sicily I deemed myself law fully married . . . although the decree of the Council of Trent forbade our regular marriage.\" The two infer ences which may safely be drawn from this statement are, first, that the Sicilian whom he espoused was a Roman Catholic in religious faith, and, second, that legal or religious rites were never solemnized. In 1811 a daugh ter, Emily, was born to the couple, and in 1814 a son, Charles Linnaeus. The boy died the following year, 1815. Neither child is mentioned by Rafinesque in all his writings ; in his will alone we find the first intima tion of paternity and of parental solicitude. Of the * Vide Appendix, where this will is given in full. 1 6 The Life and Writings of daughter no information other than that which is given in this document has been attainable. The consort of Rafinesque, on receiving the news of his shipwreck in 1815, \" suddenly married Giovanni Pizzalour, a comedian,\" and dissipated the property which Rafinesque had left in her hands. All that is further known of this woman is the opinion in which she was held by Rafinesque, who, in his will, declares her to be \"unworthy\", and directs that his executors shall not allow her \"a single cent\"; he also directs that no part of his property should be paid to his daughter Emily \"until she leaves altogether and separates from\" her mother. Emily, influenced no doubt by the theatrical relations of the new family bonds, became a singer in the Palermo Theatre. She was the mother of an illegitimate daugh ter, Henrietta Winston, by one Sir Henry Winston, for the maintenance of which grand-daughter Rafinesque was not certain the baronet would provide ; he therefore com mends her, in his will, to his nephew, Jules Rafinesque. The last known of Emily was the simple fact of resi dence in Naples in 1833. With this period of Rafinesque's career there is little of direct interest to us. First and all the time he was a naturalist; though his real concerns here were of a business character. It would appear, from his account Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 17 of these years, that he was reasonably successful in business enterprises, for he states that \"by trading in the products of the island\" he made his first personal fortune. It is curious to note that some of his ventures were along the line of economic botany, for his trade lay in the manufacture of squills for the European and American markets. Rafinesque first taught the Sicilians many things of this sort, thus proving himself, though unwillingly, another Latinus to this beautiful island. He became quite familiar with the whole island, and seems to have devoted himself assiduously to the study of every form of life within its area. All the ten years he spent here were full of toil and study. They were, on the whole, very happily passed, though many of his business employments were heterogeneous and peculiar. At one time connected with the United States legation as secretary or chancellor to Minister Gibbs, at another the manager of a successful brandy-still for a company of gentlemen, next a candidate for a State position which he never obtained, editor of a magazine, naturalist and collector always, these were the occupations with which he filled the ten years of Sicilian life. He became per sonally and by correspondence known to many of the scientific men of Europe, and with some of them he had very pleasant relations. Swainson, the English nat- 3 1 8 The Life and Writings of uralist, was stationed for some time in Sicily, and with him Rafinesque had the most intimate and cordial coop eration. They collected and studied and wrote together. On one occasion, when the vicissitudes of business pre vented personal attention on the part of Rafinesque, Swainson supervised the printing, at Messina, of one of his friend's books, \"The Index of Sicilian Ichthy ology \". During these years, too, the habit of mind engendered by indiscriminate reading and delving into every thing natural bore its proper fruit; for a time he worked at volcanic rocks and eruptions, anon found recreation and employment in tracing the remains of ancient settlements, hunted plants, drew and described them, collected fish, secured large numbers of shells, assisted Swainson in hunting insects, worked on the reptiles, and withal kept up a voluminous correspond ence with other naturalists in France, in America, and in Italy. In truth these ten years were very busy ones, an estimate of the work of which is offered in its proper place. His experiences with the natives of his chosen home do not appear to have been of the most pleasant character. In his description of Sicily occurs almost the only epigrammatic writing I have ever noted in Rafinesque's works; says he, \"she offers ... a fruitful soil, a delightful climate, excellent productions, perfidious men, deceitful women,\" Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 19 SECOND VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES. In 1815 Rafinesque left Sicily and Europe forever. During the later years of his Sicilian residence, affairs, from a business and literary standpoint, had not pro gressed satisfactorily; he apparently did not regret the fact of leaving that famous island. The voyage began in July and ended in November. Adverse weather con ditions met the vessel as soon as the Mediterranean was cleared; the good ship suffered the ordeal of a severe Atlantic storm, was damaged and compelled to seek a haven in the Azores. The Island of St. Michael thus by an accident became an object of botanical interest to Rafinesque. He collected thereon, observed the volcanic rocks, drew some of the objects found, and so turned a seeming misfortune to the best account possible. The story of the landing of Rafinesque in America for the second time reads like a romance, and though there are many who profess to doubt its exact truthful ness I must confess to the most complete credulity in its essential correctness. I have so long read and studied this man, am so familiar with his character, which was open and honest, have so great an admiration for that part of his life which was unclouded by mental misfor- 20 The Life and Writings of tune that I will, I am sure, be pardoned for expressing thus strongly my belief in the. truth of the story of shipwreck. It appears to me that the incident is ex tremely important in weighing certain facts of his after life. It was midnight of the second of November, 1815, in a dense fog, on Race Rock, off Fisher's Island, at the eastern end of Long Island Sound, that the good ship, which had brought Rafinesque and his possessions across the Atlantic in safety, went down. Striking on the rocks, her keel was entirely torn away, and when a swell landed her beyond the rocks she rapidly filled and sank. Down with her went the results of years of toil and of labor, both mercantile and scientific. To quote the lan guage of the sufferer: \" I had lost everything, my fortune, my share of the cargo, my collections and labours for 20 years past, my books, my manu scripts, my drawings, even my clothes ... all that I possessed except some scattered funds and the Insurance ordered in Kngland for one third of the value of my goods.\"* I can imagine the condition of this man under these circumstances. I can see him walking the streets of New London \"in a state of utter despair\". Here, in this misfortune, and resulting from it, began that mental *Vidc \"A Life of Travels\", etc., pp. 48, 49. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 21 condition which made his scientific work in later years subject of the severest criticism. He was still a young man, it is true, having seen but thirty-two summers, but those who have studied character will agree that this misfortune affected him as it might but one in a thou sand. Of this loss he writes as follows: \"Some hearts of stone have since dared to doubt of these facts or rejoice at my losses! Yes, I have found men, vile enough to laugh without shame at my misfortune, instead of condoling with me ! But I have met also with friends who have deplored my loss, and helped me in need.\" Rafinesque appears never again to have known pros perous business adventures. He belonged to that large class of men, from this time, who imagine that the hand of every other man is against them. Leaving New London, Rafinesque went to New York, where, pending the settlement of his insurance claims in London, he found warm friends. With Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, with whom he had enjoyed a correspondence while yet a resident of Sicily, and to whom he had sent numerous scientific, chiefly botanical, papers, he found friendly greeting and a helpful friendship. The neces sities of making a livelihood led him to accept the position of private tutor in a wealthy family by the name of Livingston, residing on the Hudson; therein 22 The Life and Writings of he taught Italian, drawing, and botany. It is more than likely that the introduction which Mitchill gave Rafinesque to New York literary society helped him to this place. But before spring he resigned this post because the family desired to spend the winter in the South. He again became a child of fortune. As soon as spring had sufficiently advanced he devoted his time to geology and to the collection of the plants which grew about New York. The summer following he went as far north as Saratoga, and spent several weeks at the series of falls which are so famous in Bast-central New York. In a similar manner was passed the long period of the four following years. Then he went to Philadelphia, on business bent, and again met his old friend John D. Clifford, known to all students of Ken tucky history, who was and had been for some time a resident of Lexington. In him he found a warm and sympathizing friend, and was persuaded to visit the West, which then meant Kentucky. The summer of 1818 finds the monotony of Rafin- esque's life varied by a journey over the Alleghanies and down the Ohio, which he descended from Pittsburg in a flat-boat. He was one of a party of several men, who traveled by day and rested by night. This must have suited the taste of Rafinesque, who could thus give the Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 23 greatest possible attention to his loves, the flowers and the fishes and the mollusks. During his long residence in Sicily he had done much work on the fishes of the Mediterranean, and no doubt he found ample opportunity in the long days of slow movement down the Ohio to arouse again his intelligent love of these forms. FIRST VISIT TO THE FALLS OF THE OHIO. The party with which Rafinesque reached Louisville found its haven at the Falls. At Shippingport* he was \"received with open arms\" by the Messrs. Tarascon, formerly of Marseilles and next of Philadelphia, who now operated a large flouring -mill at that place. For two weeks he remained there, and one who has ever seen the rich molluscan life of the Falls of the Ohio at low water might understand what busy weeks these were. Rafinesque spent the time \"studying the fishes and shells of the river, of which I made a large collection, drawing them on the spot at the same time. I was sur prized to find them nearly all new: this rendered my researches still more important and interesting.\" *Shippiugport is now within the corporate limits of the city of Louisville, at the foot of the Falls of the Ohio. 24 The Life and Writings of THE VISIT TO HENDERSON. Extensive botanical and other collections were made by Rafinesque all the way from Louisville to Henderson ; the trip being made by day, that he might better study the plants and fishes and shells. Arrived at Henderson he sought John J. Audubon, the ornithologist, to whom he had a note of introduction and with whom he remained several days. Rafinesque says \" some days\"; Audubon himself says \"three weeks\". In this connection, perhaps better than in any other, reference may be made to an episode which Audubon has recorded of Rafinesque. With some reluctance, in this place, is the incident again related, not because it will have harmful effect in judging the work of Rafin esque, but because it must needs detract much from the fame of Audubon, whose reputation for strict truthfulness was never of the best among those who knew him. It serves to explain some features of the great ornitholo gist's life and strengthens the unfavorable opinion which some entertain of him; it serves also to throw light upon the plain, straight - forward, trusting character of Rafinesque. When the story is read between the lines the effect on the reader would appear to be most favorable to the victim. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 25 Auduboii introduces Rafinesque as the \" Kccentric Naturalist\",* the humor of which has so appealed to very many writers that they have been constrained to reproduce the episode without much interest in the man it most affects. Audubon nowhere gives the name of his victim, but it is understood that the \"M. de T.\" is none other than Rafinesque. The account runs as follows: \"'What an odd-looking fellow!' said I to myself, as, while walk ing by the river, I observed a man landing from a boat, with what I thought a bundle of dried clover on his back. ' How the boatmen stare at him ! Surely he must be an original ! ' He ascended with rapid step, and, approaching me, asked if I could point out the house in which Mr. Audubon resided? 'Why, I am the man,' said I, 'and will gladly lead you to my dwelling.' The traveller rubbed his hands together with delight, and drawing a letter from his pocket handed it to me without any remark. I broke the seal and read as follows : ' My Dear Audubon — I send you an odd fish, which you may prove to be undescribed, and hope you will do so in your next letter. Believe me always your friend, B.' \" With all the simplicity of a woodsman, I asked the bearer where the odd fish was; when M. de T. . . . smiled, rubbed his eyes, and with the greatest good humor said, ' I am that odd fish, I presume, Mr. Audubon.' I felt confounded and blushed, but contrived to stammer an apology. \"We soon reached the house, when I presented my learned guest to my family, and was ordering a servant to go to the boat for M. de T.'s luggage, when he told me he had none but what he brought on his back. He then loosened the pack of weeds which *Vide Ornithological Biography, Vol. I, pp. 455-460. 4 26 The Life and Writings of had first drawn my attention. The ladies were a little surprised, but I checked their critical glances for the moment. The naturalist pulled off his shoes, and while engaged in drawing his stockings, not up, but down, in order to cover the holes about the heels, told us in the gayest mood imaginable that he had walked a great dis tance, and had only taken a passage on board the ark, to be put on this shore, and that he was sorry his apparel had suffered so much from his late journey. Clean clothes were offered but he would not accept them, and it was with evident reluctance that he performed the lavations usual on such occasions before he sat down to dinner. \" He chanced to turn over the drawing of a plant quite new to him. After inspecting it closely, he shook his head, and told me no such plant existed in nature: — for M. de T. although a highly scientific man, was suspicious to a fault, and believed such plants only to exist as he had himself seen, or such as, having been dis covered of old, had, according to Father Malebranche's expression, acquired a ' venerable beard.' I told my guest that the plant was common in the immediate neighborhood, and that I would show it to him on the morrow. 'And why to-morrow, Mr. Audubon? L,et us go now.' We did so ; and on reaching the river I pointed to the plant. I thought M. de T. had gone mad. He plucked the plants one after another, danced, hugged me to his arms, and exultingly told me that he had got, ' Not merely a new species, but a new genus.' \" When it waxed late, I showed him to the apartment intended for him during his stay, and endeavored to render him comfortable, leaving him writing materials in abundance. I was, indeed, heartily glad to have a naturalist under my roof. We had all retired to rest. Every person I imagined was in deep slumber, save myself, when of a sudden I heard a great uproar in the naturalist's room. I got up, reached the place in a few moments, and opened the door, when, to my astonishment, I saw my guest running about the room naked, holding the handle of my favorite violin, the body of which he had Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 27 battered to pieces against the walls in attempting to kill the bats, which had entered by the open window, probably attracted by the insects flying around his candle. I stood amazed, but he continued running around and round, until he was fairly exhausted; when he begged me to procure one of the animals for him, as he felt convinced they belonged to a 'new species'. Although I was con vinced to the contrary, I took up the bow of my demolished Cremona, and administering a smart tap to each of the bats as it came up, soon got specimens enough. \" M. de T. remained with us for three weeks and collected multi tudes of plants, shells, bats, and fishes. . . . We were perfectly reconciled to his oddities, and finding him a most agreeable and intelligent companion, hoped that his sojourn might be of long duration. But one evening, when tea was prepared, and we expected him to join the family, he was nowhere to be found. His grasses and other valuables were all removed from his room. The night was spent in searching for him in the neighborhood. No eccentric naturalist could be discovered. Whether he had perished in a swamp, or had been devoured by a bear or gar-fish, or had taken to his heels, were matters of conjecture; nor was it until some weeks after, that a letter from him, thanking us for our attention, assured me of his safety.\" That this incident, so charmingly told, is amusing, its popularity with other writers full well attests, but it contains certain internal incongruities that lead one to suspect that it is grossly exaggerated. Particularly does this impression grow on one who reads carefully that portion, omitted here, which recounts the famous bear and cane-brake episode. There could have been but one purpose in Audubon's mind, and that was to 28 The Life and Writings of make the hero of the episode as ridiculous as possible. The story never found its way into print until Rafinesque had for some years ceased to be a resident of the State, and even then, in its original form, dared not name him as the real hero ! But this failure to name Rafinesque makes the turpitude of Audubon the greater. And add to this another episode in itself far less harmful than the bat story, but infinitely more disreputable in its nature and results, and the reader of Rafinesque has just cause of complaint. Audubon played upon the credulity of his guest, who had implicit confidence in him as a brother naturalist. The host simply lied to Rafiuesque, and seeing him eagerly accept the proffered bait still further abused his confidence and did a most unmanly act, one which has caused great annoyance and loss of time to succeeding naturalists. Audubon drew figures of some impossible fish, giving them gaudy coloration and glowing descriptions, and supplied Rafinesque with what purported to be notes of fact ; all of these Rafinesque duly copied into his own note-book. Furthermore, the host described to his guest impossible limpet-like shells, said to live in the Ohio, and these were likewise carefully noted. Later, Rafinesque used these so-called facts as the bases of new genera and species ; then Audubon employed the data known only to himself to make Rafinesque ridic- Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 29 ulous.* I have long had a suspicion that Audubon had taken the whole naturalist world into his confidence, in many of his bird biographies, and that some of his facts would sometime result in romances. The more I know of him and his methods the more I am convinced that this is true. But, in this case, a guest was made the innocent victim of misplaced confidence in his host; and the host in the role of a confidence man never inspires faith. Men to whom Audubon told the tale, attempting to justify it as a joke, have used the facts to the detriment of the fair fame of Rafinesque.f FROM HENDERSON TO THE MISSISSIPPI. Rafinesque left Henderson and the home of Audubon for a journey to the mouth of the Ohio, which point he reached as the farthest point in all his western travels. On his way he passed through New Harmony, Indiana, which was then one of the great scientific centers of the New World. In that quiet town on the Lower Wabash » *Vide Contributions to North American Ichthyology, I, p. 6, 1877. Also, Rafinesque, by David Starr Jordan, in Popular Science Monthly, Vol. XXIX, No. II, p. 217, June, 1886. tThe following are the names ol\" fishes bestowed upon the \"drawings communicated by Mr. Audubon \" : Perca nigropunctata, Aplocentrus calliops, Pogostoma leucops, Catostomus anisopturus, Catosfomus niger, Catostomus fasciolaris, Catostomus (?) megastomus, Pylodictis limosus, Accipenser macros- tomus, Dinectus truncatus. 30 The Life and Writings of dwelt Say, and Owen, and Maclure, and LeSeuer, names all yet held, and deservedly, in the highest honor. He did not long remain in that retired place, the foundation principles of which impressed Rafinesque with its Uto pian character. Much of the return journey from the mouth of the Ohio was accomplished on foot, \"having found the horse too fatiguing\". His destination was Lexington, but he went by way of Louisville in order that his collections might be put in the care of his friends, the Tarascons, and by them transmitted to Pitts- burg. Rafinesque had not yet knowledge of the fact that he would become a resident of Kentucky. His only care was to make as large collections as possible and get them safely away to Philadelphia. FIRST VISIT TO LEXINGTON. It was a roundabout way that carried Rafinesque to Lexington on his first visit. The towns of Shepherds ville and Frankfort were visited and several side excursions taken. At length he reached Lexington and found his former Philadelphia friend, Clifford. This visit and the kindness of his reception, together with the opportunities for study and collecting that seemed to present them selves, coupled with the persuasions of his friend, deter- Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 31 mined Rafinesque to come to Kentucky, and this he did after a visit to Philadelphia to \"settle my concerns and withdraw from trade\". The chief fact that influenced him to this decision appears to have been the promise of Clifford to secure for him an appointment to a professor ship in Transylvania University. Clifford was himself an enthusiastic geologist and indefatigable collector; he had amassed a considerable collection of fossils, and these helped Rafinesque in reaching a decision. More over, Clifford looked with great favor on the scientific work of his guest, and one may well be sure that the guest appreciated this fact. Already Rafinesque had been made aware of the hostile feeling that many men of science entertained toward him, for to some of them he had shown himself a formidable rival. The visit to Philadelphia again gave Rafinesque occa sion to know something of the perfidy of man and especially, it may be supposed, of Sicilians. He had intrusted certain of his business adventures to a Sicilian, who proved false to his trust and bankrupted and defrauded him of all his earnings. Finally, however, a start westward was made, business affairs left behind, goods shipped, and for the third time Rafinesque crossed the Alleghanies. The journey began in May, 1819, and ended in the heart of the bluegrass region of Kentucky 32 The Life and Writings of in middle summer. Rafinesque found the University in the midst of vacation, and hastened to join Clifford, who was spending the summer in scientific recreation in the country. RAFINESQUE AT TRANSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY. The institution to which Rafinesque had now come had a stormy career. It was the outcome of an act of the legislature of Kentucky which had amalgamated two earlier and rival schools, the fact having been consum mated in 1798. The two institutions whose fortunes were thus joined were the Transylvania Seminary, estab lished in 1783 by the Virginia Legislature, and the Kentucky Academy, established by the Presbyterians in 1796. Considerations of economy, on the one hand, and the evident fact that rivalry such as theirs would only result in permanent injury to both schools, on the other, led to the amalgamation. The University was now under the celebrated Holly regime, its president, the third to hold the office, being the Reverend Horace Holly, LL. D. Rafinesque became connected with this school in the fall of 1819, and at a time when there were internal dissensions. To this untoward condition must be added the fact that he was a stranger, of foreign birth and Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 33 with foreign air, and, further, there must be considered the fact that his chair was new and counted of but little importance. Those were the days of a classical education, purely and simply, and there was no interest in any other roots than those of Latin and Greek origin or in leaves of other sort than those which had the cabalistic signs of men who thought and wrote two thou sand or more years ago. He who could quote freely and at length from Horace or Juvenal, or could see in Pindar and Demosthenes meanings of which they them selves never dreamt, was the educated man.* It mattered not how little he might know of gravitation or of dynamics, of bugs or of plants, if only he knew our ancient Latin friends; his education was then complete. Amid literary surroundings such as these Rafinesque now found a home. It would be difficult indeed to find another degree of literary difference so marked as that between Rafinesque and his associate professors. They were, in tastes and pursuits, as unlike as men could be; *It needs only in support of this statement that attention be called to the character of the articles which constitute the bulk of the Western Review and Miscellaneous Magazine, published at Lexington, about this time. Its pages contain many labored literary articles, and not a few philosophical ones, in which classical training ran amuck through all the fields of knowledge, compelling attention to its demands to the exclusion of all else. The political articles, which appeared from time to time, continually refer to Greece and to Rome, to Xerxes, to Hannibal, to Epictetus, to Caesar, and to Augustus. 5 34 The Life and Writings of their intercourse was necessarily a continual contrast of ideas and theories determined, on the one hand, by effete philosophical systems, and, on the other, by hasty generalizations based upon incomplete knowledge of natural surroundings. It was, in epitome, a renewal of the long-continued warfare between the classics and science, without that tempering of zeal and expression which is so characteristic of real culture or of exact knowledge. Rafinesque brought to the Kentucky metrop olis of that day the habits of thought and views of State polity which were the outgrowth of his foreign birth and residence. From Sicily to Kentucky was indeed a great change; little wonder is it that he did not speedily adapt himself to these new conditions. Evidently, his real place among his colleagues must be estimated along other lines than those which found ex pression through his associates in Transylvania Univer sity. The beginning of the Kentucky life of Rafinesque was marked by a signal misfortune. With Clifford he was planning numerous excursions, one at least of which con templated a visit to Arkansas, when Clifford succumbed to a sudden fatal illness. In this blow Rafinesque lost the only man whom, as I believe, he ever loved. In vain will you search his published writings for ex pressions of regard for others, whether men or women; Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 35 the only name mentioned tenderly and with evident regard is that of Clifford. Of all the men with whom Rafinesque came in contact Clifford alone seemed to enter into the life of the naturalist, and the influence of that association was greater than all the world beside. The seven years of life at Lexington were very busy ones for Rafinesque. He made many excursions, some of which extended into Tennessee, and during which nearly all the accessible portions of Kentucky were visited. He made most extensive collections, chiefly in conchology and botany, though he neglected no branch of natural science. Numerous papers were written, and many of them published; at the same time he attended to the ordinary duties of the class-room. He was the secretary of the Kentucky Institute, the first scientific society formed within the State, and one of the first, if not the first, west of the Alleghanies. Doctor Horace Holly was the President of the Institute, before which a number of persons, and Rafinesque most of all, read scientific papers. Some of these were afterward printed in the Cincinnati Literary Gazette. The exploration and mapping of the ancient monuments which are near Lexington were accomplished during these years. But the most remarkable work of all was the preparation of the Ichthyologia Ohiensis, which has caused such 36 The Life and Writings of criticism from students of American fresh-water fishes. More will be said of this remarkable book in another place. Attention has previously been directed to the Botanic Gardens with which Rafinesque was acquainted at Mar seilles, and to those of Bartram and Marshall near Phila delphia. One of the ambitions of his life was the foundation of similar gardens at Lexington. To accom plish this he spent much time and developed a wonder ful amount of energy. In 1823 ne brought the matter to the attention of the State legislature, at Frankfort, with such success that the senate passed the bill to establish the proposed garden at Lexington; the house refused its sanction and the bill failed to become law. Though disheartened by this result Rafinesque did not wholly despair. He undertook the private solicitation of funds, the scheme contemplating the formation of a joint stock company. His friends and others inter ested in the undertaking succeeded so far as to get the projected garden incorporated. Ground was purchased within the village of Lexington;* planting was begun; *The Kentucky Reporter of the issue of Monday, November 22, 1824, has editorial mention of the purchase of the land for this garden. The location was the upper end of Main Street, and comprised ten acres. A Mr. Harper was the treasurer of the company \" on whom the stockholders are expected to call and pay the 1st and 2d installments on their shares.\" Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 37 but many who had subscribed failed to meet their obli gations and the attempt was at last entirely abandoned. His dreams were never realized. He says of the under taking, long after its collapse, \"I never owned an acre of ground; this garden would have been my delight: I had traced the plan of it, with a retreat among the flowers, a Green-house, Museum and Library; but I had to forsake it at last, and make again my garden of the woods and mountains.\" Nothing of historic importance grew out of the enterprise; nor could such result have been expected in this inland village at such an early day. Aside from Rafinesque there was probably not a single person in Lexington who knew any thing of the real nature and cost of these enterprises ; nor did he, seemingly, remember the existing untoward conditions under which the enterprise was bound to end in failure. The scheme could not appeal to the cupidity of those to whom stock was offered, for every dollar put in it went in to stay from the very nature of things. Scientific interest was impossible in men trained to other habits of thought, nor were the times ripe for the expenditures of considerable sums of money in a community still contending with a virgin forest for the very mastery of the fields themselves. The episode, however, serves a useful purpose in that it emphasizes the influence on 38 The Life and Writings of the life of Rafinesque of the surroundings of his boy hood days. In connection with the attempt to secure favorable legislative action in the matter of the Botanic Garden a serious illness resulting from exposure to a prevailing epidemic enters into the record in such manner as to illustrate another side of Rafinesque's life. He says : \"I took the measles then prevailing, and was very sick on my return to Lexington ; but I recovered in spite of the Physicians, by taking none of their poisons, anti mony and opium, while many died in their hands.\" Clearly Rafinesque had little regard for the disciples of ^sculapius ! According to the account contained in the \"Life of Travels\", with the governing body, or better, perhaps, the executive head at Transylvania, Rafinesque did not rnjoy the most pleasant relations. Doctor Horace Holly, the President, did not look with favor on the natural sciences, and having himself no especial training in them was not prepared, perhaps, to appreciate their importance. Nor were the relations which Rafinesque sustained toward his associate professors more cordial. He complains that they intrigued one against another,* * There does not seem to be sufficient warrant for this statement of Rafiu- esque. General and ex-Senator George W. Jones, of Dubuque, Iowa, who was a Constantine Samuet Rafinesqite. $9 and that there was little \" subordination among the students\". It can not be positively stated that the frequent and long excursions, which Rafinesque made while a professor at Transylvania University, were allowed to interfere with his lecture appointments or his other class-room work, but it would seem incredible that they did not. He was engrossed in his field-work, surrounded with a flora both new and beautiful, a circumstance in itself calculated to appeal strongly to the heart of the naturalist; shells and fishes totally unknown and often unique furnished addi tional inducement to relieve the weary monotony of the class-room. It even may be surmised, with strong degree of probability, that some of the dissensions of which he speaks were to be referred to this probable interference for their origin. But among the causes, whatever else they may have been, must be considered that of a certain autocratic bearing and distaste for the opinions of others which is said to have been quite characteristic of him. student in Transylvania University, and who was graduated in 1825, writes me in answer to enquiries on this subject as follows : \" I never knew of any dis agreements between the professors in Transylvania University, but I recollect how bigotted religionists in Lexington and in Kentucky persecuted President Holly and drove him from the head of the institution in 1826, then the most distinguished in the whole world. . . . The university went down and was an irreparable loss to society and to learning from the moment President [Holly] left the institution.\" 40 The Life and Writings of He was widely read and kept in touch with most of the work of his day, but he does not seem to have clearly interpreted all of his authors. In another place will be found an estimate of his literary style which, as attested by the very voluminous bibliography published from Lexington, was none too clear; he delved in every field of knowledge, and covered in his reading and his writings almost every field of research. Subjects meteor ological, geological, botanical, chemical, veterinary, astro nomical, philological, theological, engaged his attention, and were all made matter for several memoirs. He even attempted poetry, sometimes in Latin, or French, or English. These facts simply attest the work of a mind devoid of the power of concentration. That these peculiarities were known to his associate professors is certain; that this knowledge had some influence in determining their judgments of him is equally evident. In 1823 Rafinesque undertook a considerable journey across Middle Kentucky and into Tennessee, reaching the Tennessee River. The unsettled character of the country only prevented him from making the journey westward to the Mississippi. On the return trip he visited Mammoth Cave, of which he says, \"I spent one day to survey it, and found it very different from the printed exagerated accounts, but yet wonderful Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. ^ enough.\" Lexington was reached in July, and in August and September the regions of Eastern Kentucky, as far as Cumberland Gap and the Falls, to Pine Mountain, were explored. This journey was the last that Rafinesque made within the bounds of Kentucky. While resident at Lexington Rafinesque had perfected a \"patent and Divitial Invention,\" which, in 1825, prompted a journey to Washington to take caveats and patents. This is described in the following language: \"This Invention consisted chiefly in rendering Bank Stock and Deposits and Savings circulable by divisible Certificates; which will one day be certainly adopted. . . .\" This has always been the basis of the claim of Rafinesque that he was the inventor of the coupon system now so common on bonds and similar instruments. It was on the return from this journey that he \" found how the President of the University had behaved\" in his absence. He censured that official in no measured terms ; said he : \" I returned to Frankfort and to Lexington, . . . To evince his hatred against sciences and discoveries, he had broken open my rooms, given one to the students, and thrown all my effects, books and collections in a heap in the other. He had also deprived me of my position as Librarian and my board in the College. I had to put up with all this to avoid beginning law suits. I took lodgings in town and carried there all my effects: thus leaving the College with curses on it and Holly ; who were both reached by them soon after, since he died next year at sea of the Yellow fever, caught at 6 42 The Life and Writings of New Orleans, having been driven from Lexington by public opinion : and the College has been burnt in 1828 with all its contents. But Clifford's cabinet was saved (like mine) by being removed previously like mine, and is now partly in Cincinnati and partly in Philadelphia. This was a lucky escape.\"* FIRST OBJECT TEACHER IN KENTUCKY. During the time that Rafinesque occupied the chair of modern languages and the natural sciences in Tran sylvania University, was introduced west of the Allegha- nies the modern method of object teaching. During the three winters from 1823 to I8a6, among other duties he lectured on medical botany to the students in the medical department, giving his course with \" exhibition of specimens\". In this he was far ahead of the teachers of his time, and introduced a method which now every where obtains among competent instructors. * It will probably never be known what led to this action on the part of President Holly, but it would appear to have some relation to absenteeism on the part of Rafinesque. It is but just to the memory of the famous Transyl vania University President to say that always Rafinesque had received cordial welcome to his home. The following facts appear lo controvert the opinion Rafinesque had formed of the President; they are quoted from a letter I have received from an inmate of the Holly household, by permission : \" He . [Rafinesque] was a great admirer of Doctor Holly and came frequently to the house to talk on subjects of interest to him. He was never an inmate of the house although his face was a familiar one there. . . . He wrote verses, English, and Italian, and Latin, I think, and brought them to find an audience with us. . . ,\" Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 43 In still another matter lie appears to have antedated some more modern observations, as may be gathered from the following facts: \" He often lectured to the students in College and in a most entertaining manner to the great delight of his audiences. His lecture on the ants was peculiarly instructive and interesting, caus ing many of the students to laugh heartily when he gave us the history of ants, especially when he described them as having lawyers, doctors, generals and privates, and of their having great battles and of.the care by physicians and nurses of the wounded, etc., etc. . . . \" I would now give any reasonable sum to hear him repeat one of his lectures that I listened to in Transylvania University.\"* Skilled indeed mnst have been the mind that could fix facts like these in such manner that they endured for seventy years ! RAFINESQUE AS A LECTURER. Much of the time of Rafinesque in, the University was employed in teaching the modern languages, in which he again was the pioneer of the West. Transylvania University, through him, has thus a remarkably impor tant place in the history of higher education west of the Appalachians. But it would appear that the professor and naturalist, notwithstanding the wide range of his scientific investigations and the great number of papers * General Geo. W.

To fill the full measure of his desires he formed and conducted classes in the modern languages outside the college walls ; he lectured on scientific sub jects to the people of Lexington; he gave instruction in botany to all that desired it. In illustration of the wide range his activities acquired, the following notices from various numbers of the Kentucky Reporter pub lished during 1821 and 1822 may serve: \"TUITION.\" \" Prof. Rafinesque Teaches the French Italian and Spanish Lan guages, in the University and gives also private lessons to the ladies in town.\" \" He will give private instruction in the University or in town in the following branches — Elements of useful knowledge, Botany, Geometry, Map-Drawing etc.\" {Kentucky Reporter ; January 15, 1821.) Later, in the spring of the same year, when the plant lift of the region was about to awaken for the new botanical year, he thus advertised: \"PROFESSOR RAFINESQUE Will begin to deliver his Course of Botany as soon as a class shall be formed : — he invites those who are willing to attend it to apply to him immediately.\" \"He continues to give private instruction in the French & Italian Languages etc. Also in several branches of other knowledge.\" Sometimes during this period Rafinesque essayed the lecture platform. As in his writings, so in his lee- Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. ^ tures to the public a very wide range was given to his subjects. He was not often on the lecture platform, but there are several mentions of lectures in the Kentucky Reporter for the years 1820 to 1822 that are interesting, inasmuch as they show us how he occupied some of the leisure of college life. Among these notices the following are characteristic of the man : \"TRANSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY. Professor Rafinesque will deliver a Public Lecture, introductory to a course of Medical Botany Medical Mineralogy Medical Zoology &c, in the Chapel of the University, on Wednesday next, 2ist Nov. at 12 o'clock. The Medical Professors, Students etc. are invited to attend as well as the ladies and gentlemen of Lexington.\" \"If the weather should prove unfavorable it will be postponed to the next Saturday at the same hour.\" (Kentucky Reporter, Novem ber 19, 1821.) The next year his public lectures appear to have taken an entirely different direction. They then seemed to have been suggested by his studies on the matter which was finally included in his historical works or works on ancient nations. The psychological tendency of his researches is evident from the notices which are here reproduced : \"A PUBLIC LECTURE.\" \" On the Human Mind will be delivered (weather permitting) on the 22iid of April, Monday next, at 12 o'clock in the Chapel of Transylvania University by Prof. Rafinesque as an Introductory to UNIVERSITY 46 The Life and Writings of a course of Lectures on the Natural & Moral History of Man Kind. \"The Ladies and Gentlemen of L/exington are invited to attend.\" (Kentucky Reporter, April 15, 1822.) The only mention of a lecture accompanied by a fee for admission is found late in the year 1822, and, like the last preceding, the address belonged to the realm of metaphysics. The notice runs as following: \"LECTURES ON PRAENOLOGY.\" \"Professor Rafinesque will deliver a discourse by request on Phraenology Craniology & the Analysis of the Human Mind, on this evening at 7 o'clock in the Medical Room. \"Admission Fifty Cents. Tickets to be had of Mr. McNitt, at the lecture room & at Mr. De veins.\" (Kentucky Reporter, December 16, 1822.) Curiously enough there never occurs any reportorial or editorial notices of any of these lectures; there is absolutely no means of ascertaining any thing relative to their reception by the townspeople. Nor, among the frequent \" letters\" to the editor in either criticism or praise of the various departments of the University, and such letters were numerous, for these were stormy times in University matters, have we found a single one which mentions, to say nothing of being chiefly concerned with, Rafinesque's work or the department of science over which he presided. It would appear that he toiled Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 47 along alone, with little of counsel or of help. Unap preciated he certainly was, his quaint ways and habitual obliviousness of his surroundings subserving that end. Rafinesque was a frequent contributor of \"open let ters\" and short articles to the Lexington newspapers, and some of these are quite quaint and interesting. He always seemed to believe that the general public felt as much interest in natural history details as he himself did; perhaps, however, the fact that many rare and little known forms of animals were brought to his notice by the curious around him explains an interest which he thought was general ; in this way, perhaps, his own interest he came to believe was common to all who read the newspapers. A single example will serve to indicate the nature of these newspaper contributions, none of which are deemed of sufficient importance to constitute a portion of the bibliography given in this volume. From several articles the following is selected: \"THREE NOTICES OF NATURAL HISTORY.\" \"BY PROF. C. S. RAFINESQUE.\" \" i.

The interest of Jefferson in matters scientific was well known to Rafinesque, who had often written him personal letters. Also during these years in Lexington he frequently wrote open or published letters to persons of celebrity, among whom were Cuvier, Banks, De Candolle, Bory, and others. Three of these letters are preserved in the Kentucky Reporter for the dates 22d and 29th August and 6th September, 1820. They are so very characteristic of the man that they should be useful in undertaking an estimate of his / • .^ »^x • s /, / >y */s j ml */ s S s* ^ f^^rjj^ c/j^w/fc* cl<^~v C* Vw^y^owv oL ( ' Ltvu^^^I »'t7f Ct-vCtTotXt, cL-lQ~K.J>4<»-. ot^-^ot >- uc/uoitr <t~qjL'</ v^v. w^t^T «v JlX.v^-^ c^JtXx/^j^jD d6<K$o ,«.r Jt^u-.o/VM^« ^vw. eX^-i /t^«)<4tr^ ^ ' \" •/• J / ^- I- I / // - ^/ ^ «^\\A/tr^»»»/i /i vu t»< t*« CM'M Lc-«^«— ^^ '((AUTVI vvCZZC^r\" \"v»-M* tw-* tXctiooi^ o*vt-«. acji*.v* f4^^Ji^* «XtA^(^ -(LL*,v^ ^«^U*^x.<X- ^^.^JjJit^ t rA.^^r^L^i^j Md- f<~^^«~ ^ \"1~ oJ C*VN —/ <ifc«^- /«-^/CtV« C»W'< ?Jt OlAJ^lC^l^xOA-<. tJr(>-^<^rr^l IJoLJOO^y lr«._fcf} tHf*N>AV.V<Ol 0«.

[ Reduced one-fourth.] Constantine Satmiel Rafinesque. 49 mental life. These three are addressed, \"To the Hon orable Thomas Jefferson, Late President of the United States.\" The first is an introductory one, of a column and a half length, \" On Alleghawian Records \" ; the second constitutes a \"Description of the Alleghawian Monuments In the neighborhood of Mount Sterling, Montgomery Co. Kentucky\"; the third, a column and half long, has the following title : \" On some Allegawian Implements etc\". The mounds or works are quite fully described in these letters, as well as their probable uses, or better, perhaps, the uses which Rafinesque supposed they had subserved; the same treatment was accorded the implements. FROM 182^ TO 1840. Rafinesque left Lexington and Kentucky in June, 1825, taking with him all his possessions. He left Transylvania University of his own accord, driven to desperation by the treatment accorded his collections. He turned his footsteps eastward; his work west of the Alleghanies had ended. So far as is known he never visited again the regions to the west. As first, in 1802, so now, in 1825, he at last made Philadelphia his home. It is impossible to follow with very much detail the last fifteen years of his life. The facts are too little 7 50 The Life and Writings of known and have, so far as known, too great likeness to warrant minute statement. He continued his numerous excursions to the very last, and during these journeys always explored new regions. These few years sufficed to take him to nearly all the Middle Atlantic States and furnished him with very many opportunities to study the mountain flora of the northern Appalachians. Some of his larger works were composed in great part during these last years, and a number of them were published. From the time he left Transylvania University he ex perienced considerable difficulty in getting his numerous papers published; very many of them never would have seen the light in printed form, were it not that he es sayed the establishment of one or two literary and scien tific periodicals. These, like his earlier adventure of similar nature in Sicily, came to sudden ends, through failure of subscribers to pay, and through failure of publishers to print without cash payment. Some liter ary enterprises, extensive in nature, for which he was not well equipped either in training or in means, were projected, and some, like his \"Tellus,\" were to compass the whole world in their scope. This last ambitious project was partially consummated, and is represented by two volumes, printed in Philadelphia, in 1836. The widest possible range of subjects is included within his Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 51 writings of these years, testifying strongly to his ina bility to concentrate his mind and work. The most interesting fact connected with this por tion of the career of Rafinesqne is his attempted appli cation of his medical information to the treatment of consumption. He has commonly been regarded as a \"quack\" during this part of his life. However he was far from such in fact. There is the essential distinction, first of all, that Rafinesque really believed in his medi cines and in his treatment. In his will may be found a paragraph to which attention is directed in this con nection. For some years he had made and advertised a medicine, sold in several forms, to which he gave the name of \" Pulmel,\" and concerning the virtues of which he wrote a book. His methods, then novel — and Rafin esque always seemed to be in the lead in novelties — were not at all unlike those now adopted by respectable firms for the advertisement of their own nostrums. He published a number of statements of cures, reliefs, and similar matters, just as is now done under cover of the certification of a reputable physician. While it is prob able his decoctions and pills and powders possessed very little therapeutic value, it is not quite clear that they were less valuable than many that now are heralded, world wide, as possessing virtues and powers that are incredible. 52 The Life and Writings of It should also be remembered that Rafinesque was driven by the necessities of a poverty almost unspeakable, in the midst of a city of plenty, to do some things with his \"Pulmel\" which he probably never would have done under any ordinary circumstances. The determination to owe no man anything; to secure the publication of his books; to get and arrange new plants and other nat ural history objects; to complete the exploration of the northern Alleghanies, were all - controlling motives with him. It was not sordid gain that drove him to medical concoctions, but a sincere desire to get by fair means, in an honorable way, the opportunity to do good and be of service to mankind. I believe that Rafinesque did good as he understood and felt it; that he had a nature sus ceptible of appreciating kindnesses, and that, in his way and to the best of his knowledge, he was of a philan thropic mould. Of this particular episode in the life of Rafinesque it would be well, perhaps, to allow him to speak. He says :* \"Having cured myself completely in 1828 of my chronic com plaint, which was the fatal Phthisis, caused by my disappointments, fatigues, and the unsteady climate ; which my knowledge in medical botany enabled me to subdue and effect a radical cure: I entered into arrangements for establishing a Chemical manufacture of veg etable remedies against the different kinds of Consumption. This *Life of Travels, p. 87. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. ^ succeeded well. I introduced also a new branch of medical knowl edge and art. I became a Pulmist, who attended only to diseases of the lungs, as a Dentist attends only to the teeth. Being thus the first Pulmist, and perhaps the only one here or elsewhere. This new Profession changed my business for awhile ; yet enabling me to travel again in search of plants or to spread my practice, and to put my collections in better order, publishing many pam phlets, &c. \" In 1829 I gave a public proof of my art, in printing a small book called the Pulmist or the art to cure the Consumption, and many hundreds of individuals, whom I have cured or relieved are another striking proof of the beneficial results of my new practice.\"* Rafinesque did not entirely abandon pedagogy when he left Kentucky. In the winter of 1826-27 he lectured on physical geography and natural history in the Franklin Institute, and afterward, during part of 1827, was \" Pro~ fessor of Geography and Drawing in the High school of *This book, the full title of which will be found in the bibliography accompanying this sketch, was caustically reviewed by the editor of \" The Western Journal of the Medical and Physical' Sciences\" Volume III, 1830, pp. 417, 418, 455. The review is included in a series headed \"The Peoples Doctors,\" which deals with books of a character similar to that of Rafinesque. The most remarkable thing connected with the review lies in the fact that its author, Doctor Daniel Drake, had never seen the volume ! He says, p. 417 : \" We have not had the advantage of seeing the Professor's ' doctor book,' the title of which is prefixed to this article, but his circular lies before us. . . .\" I have no defense for Rafinesque's foolish book, with the contents of which I am familiar, but I can not enter too strong a protest against treatment of this sort, and against reviews by reviewers, who have never seen the works of which they write. But this method has not been confined to the doctors, evidently, as a perusal of some of the articles in the \"Rafinesquiana\" herewith published will abundantly testify. 54 The Life and Writings of the same Institution.\" In September of the same year he left this post, and so far as known never again entered a class-room as instructor. Ill health seriously interfered with all his manifold occupations, but he still kept on writing, amassing notes, publishing fragmentary articles, and devoting not a little time to inventions and to his medical business. THE Six PER CENT SAVINGS BANK. Probably the most interesting business adventure of Rafinesque during these later years was the proposal, elaboration and establishment of a kind of savings bank which he called the Divitial Institution and Six Per Cent Savings Bank. This institution had been a favorite scheme for quite ten years before final organi zation. The men who went into the scheme were all men of small holdings; wealthy people would have nothing to do with it. It paid stockholders six per cent, and loaned money at the same interest rate. The first year of its operation the bank divided a dividend of nine per cent among the stockholders. How money could be borrowed at six per cent, loaned at six per cent, and current expenses be paid, does not appear, unless, indeed, \"the commissions, fines, and casualities \", Constantine Samuel Rafinesqtte. 55 which he mentions, proved a prolific source of income! Many similar institutions were proposed and established at this time in Philadelphia, but Rafinesque lumps them all together and declares that they were all gambling institutions. The bank was still in existence at the death of Rafinesque, but nothing can be learned of its real history. It is not a little singular that the earliest and the latest business ventures of Rafinesque alone appear to have succeeded. All the rest is a record of continuous failure. THE DEATH OF RAFINESQUE. The closing scenes in the life of this man are of the saddest nature imaginable. He lived in the most abject poverty on Race Street, Philadelphia, in a garret, sur rounded by his books, minerals, plants and other loved natural objects. He shunned the company of others and had no, or but few, real and tried friends. Scientific recluse that he was in these days, there were none to care for him and help him in time of want. His scientific loves were still strong, and he struggled along in the unequal battle with fortune in the face of a disease which had no relief save in death. The end came in 1840, when, alone in his crowded garret, in a poor quarter of the great city, he died of cancer of the stomach. 56 The Life and Writings of Language can not adequately portray the emotions that arise as these words are written. Here was a man who for years had loved and wooed that coy goddess whom we call Nature; a man who had the soul to appreciate both her richness and her profligacy; whose varied for tunes, both in letters and in means, seem as the details of a romance; he had at last paid the penalty of being a part of that same Nature. He died without a word to cheer him, without a tear shed for him. Rafinesque! The name had gone to every land where science is cul tivated. Rafinesque! The name had been bandied about in jest and contumely by those who should have hailed him as brother. Rafinesque! Dead! He yet lives and will live as long as plants shall be studied and classified ; as long as fishes shall unwittingly fall in the net of the searcher; as long as the waters of the West shall give life to mollusks; as long as changing stream or fleeting cloud or moving star shall bear a message to men. Long may the name of him who studied them all and loved them all and understood them all be revered by those who regard the labors of the pioneer! Rafinesque had been dead to the world of brightest minds for some years. The experiences through which he had passed, which involved some of the saddest that come to men, had so broken him that there is little Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. ^ question but that he was not of sound mind during these latest years. He was not, however, the irrespon sible madman some would have us believe; rather, his was monomania, and took the direction of descriptions of new forms of animal and plant life. But, more than this, his defect was that peculiar form of monomania which believed only in himself; which saw in his own work a value that does not always attach to it; which made him neglect the work of others, or, if it were noticed, impelled him to caustic and unwise criticism. It is related of his burial, that when a few men, what ever the motive that prompted them may have been, learned of his death and assembled to give the dead decent entombment, his landlord refused permission of burial; he hoped to find a market for the body in a medical school, and thus obtain the rental Rafinesque could not pay when living. The body had been locked in a room adjoining that in which death had come; the door was forced open in the presence of his last and faithful friend, Doctor William Mease, and an under taker by the name of Bringhurst; and what remained of Rafinesque was let down by ropes into the back yard and then conveyed to its resting-place.* *This statement was first published in the Philadelphia Ledger Supple ment, May 5, 1877. It is reproduced entirely in the American Naturalist, 1877, Vol. XI, pp. 574, 575. Vide \" Rafinesquiana \" at the end of this volume. 8 58 The Life and Writings of The unfortunate naturalist lies buried in Ronaldson's Cemetery, Ninth and Catherine streets, Philadelphia. In 1 86 1 the place was marked by a plain board slab on which was painted simply \"C. S. R.\" To-day the spot where he was buried is unmarked. DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTY OF RAFINESQUE. All that Rafinesque possessed in the world is summed up as personal property in the items of his will. When it was learned that he was dead and that his property would be sold at public auction, there was an unseemly haste on the part of some persons to get possession of his treasures, whatever they were. Kight dray loads of books and natural history collections comprised the mass of his \"estate\". They went to the auction rooms of the city and were publicly sold, in violation of the provisions of his will, which required private sale. There is no intimation in the return of the executors that any attempt was made to comply with its requirements. His manuscripts on archseologic subjects were bought by Professor S. S. Haldeman, and eventually found their way, most of them, into the hands of Brantz Mayer, of Baltimore, formerly consul for the United States to Mexico. Thence many finally reached the United States Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. CQ National Museum at Washington, where some are still preserved. The National Museum possesses also several note-books in which are recorded Rafinesque's observa tions during some of his numerous travels; in addition, there are an unpublished paper on the fishes of New York and Pennsylvania, and the manuscript of a pro posed \"Conchologia Ohiensis.\" Many of the archseologic manuscripts of Rafinesque eventually found their way into the hands of Squier and Davis, the authors of the immortal \" Ancient Monu ments of the Mississippi Valley\". Such parts as suited their purpose these gentlemen employed in its compi lation. Most of this work of Rafinesque on the ancient peoples of America seems to have disappeared from view in Baltimore. The collections of Rafinesque had suffered much from neglect and inability properly to care for them. Labels were lost and misplaced ; indeed most of the mineral and conchologic materials were entirely without labels, and were sold for mere trifles. The botanical collections were badly injured by mice and other vermin, and were in sad condition; most of the plant collection sold as waste paper. A few good specimens were secured by Mr. Isaac Burk, and by him presented to the University of Penn sylvania, where, it is to be presumed, they still are. A 60 The Life and Writings of considerable collection of plants, named and studied by Rafinesque, may be seen in the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, where they form a portion of the Herbier Durand. Mr. William Hembel presented to the Philadelphia Acad emy of Natural Sciences that portion of the herbarium of Rafinesque which contained the plants on which were based the descriptive portions of the Medical Flora. These descriptions are said to possess very great value to-day, and it is very agreeable to know that the plants are still in existence. They, together with other valuable Buropean and Oriental plants, had been purchased at the sale of the estate of their owner. A collection of Annelides, or marine worms, made by Rafinesque, also found its way into the Philadelphia Academy's collec tions.* The rest are gone forever; that they really possessed value is uncertain. The books which Rafinesque left appear to have been especially the quest of the greedy purchasers who attended the sale. Some were sold at private terms, as the will directs that all should be, but most of them went at public auction. The return of the executors, appended to the will, demonstrates that the Medical Flora, pub lished in two volumes, had certain value. One man, a * Vide \"A Notice of the Origin, Progress, and Present Condition of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.\" By W. S. W. Ruschenberger, M. D., 1852, p. 27. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 61 physician, \"took eight copies\", another took \"a lot\". The books are now much sought after and possess a certain intrinsic value which did not then seem to be appreciated. The final settlement of the estate left it indebted to the administrator in the sum of fourteen dollars and forty -three cents. Rafinesque appears to have been despoiled of his rights in nomenclature while living; he was despoiled of his possessions when dead. THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF RAFINESQUE. There are living very few persons who have seen Rafinesque. But since interest always attaches to the physique of remarkable men, the attempt was made to obtain descriptive accounts from such as still might be alive. In this matter there has been a certain measure of success. The portraits which, accompany this work will disclose the rest. The published description of Rafinesque by Audubon* has long been the only source of information as to his personality, and is reproduced here because chronologic ally the first. Audubon writes as follows: \"A long loose coat of yellow nankeen, much the worse of the many rubs it had got in its time, and stained all over with the juice * Vide Ornithological Biography, Vol. I, p. 456. 62 The Life and Writings of of plants, hung loosely about him like a sack. A waistcoat of the same, with enormous pockets, and buttoned up to the chin, reached below over a pair of tight pantaloons, the lower part of which were buttoned down to the ancles. His beard was as long as I have known my own to be during some of my perigrinations, and his lank black hair hung loosely over his shoulders. His forehead was so broad and prominent that any tyro in phrenology would instantly have pronounced it the residence of a mind of strong power. His words impressed an assurance of rigid truth, and as he directed the conver sation to the study of the natural sciences, I listened to him with as much delight as Telemachus could have listened to Mentor.\" In regarding this description it should be remembered that Rafinesque had reached Henderson after a long and varied journey down the Ohio. The \"ark\", in which he last had voyaged, had not the means of polite toilet making; soiled clothing and unkempt beard, in a river village of Kentucky, -in 1818, should have excited neither comment nor wonder. A delightful and authentic account of Rafinesque, not as a rambling collector merely, but as a college pro fessor, has been furnished me by one whose mother knew Rafinesque.* The account is given exactly as it came to the writer. Says this lady: \" There are few persons now living who remember Professor Rafinesque. My mother, then a girl of ten or twelve years of age, recalls him distinctly, and describes him, as did all I have ever heard speak of him, as a most eccentric person ; his extreme ' absent- * Miss Johanna Peter, of Lexington, in litt. Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. 63 mindedness ' contributing to his foreign ways to make him pecul iar. His students were not slow to perceive that he made an excellent target for their practical jokes, and having but small esteem in those days for natural science as compared with class ical attainments, they showed him little respect. His lecture room was the scene of the most free and easy behavior, made possible by the total absorption in his subject of the lecturer, who was always totally oblivious to his surroundings when occupied with his favorite pursuits. In appearance Professor Rafinesque was small and slender, with delicate and refined hands and small feet. His features were good and his eyes handsome and dark, or apparently so from the long, dark eye-lashes. His hair, which he wore long, was dark and silky. He went into society while in Lexington and was a good dancer but had no companions, being totally abstracted, usually, with his own thoughts and having no conversation, although he spoke good English, save on his favorite topics of botany, etc. On these he was an enthusiast. He was a clever draughtsman and often made sketches of persons in his company. Mrs. Holly, the wife of the President, took a motherly supervision over this lone, friendless, little creature, while at Transylvania University, and saw that he ate his dinner, that the mud of his various expeditions was removed from his garments, that his, hair was combed and his face was washed, as often any or all of these particulars would be for gotten by the oblivious scientist. , . . For my own part I always felt sorry for poor Rafinesque, because he was a stranger and because all the young people made jokes at his expense. These he is said never to have noticed apparently, but I believe a man of his fine mind must have felt more than he showed. At any rate he appreciated kindness that was shown him although he knew none of the arts that make a man popular. He was well known to my grandmother and to my great-grandfather, Samuel Meredith, who then lived at this old country place, \"Winton,\" where I am writing. Rafinesque often walked here from Lexington, 64 The Life and Writings of seven miles, in search of specimens which he found in North Elkhorn creek and to investigate the ancient Indian forts which traverse this farm.\" A second valuable account has been furnished by General George W. Jones, of Dubuque, Iowa, who was a student in Transylvania University from 1821 to 1825. He writes : * \" I recollect the learned Professor Rafinesque perfectly well and his physiognomy and general appearance are now visible to my mind's eye. He was in personal stature about the size and appear ance of my deceased friend, the late John Quincy Adams, but I think he had a full suit of hair and black eyes. . . . Professor Rafinesque had a room in College proper, and was a man of peculiar habits and was very eccentric, but was to me one of the most interesting men I have ever known.\" And again, in a letter replying to questions con nected with the genuineness of one of the portraits of Rafinesque, which is published in connection with this memoir, General Jones writes: \"I do not think that either of the pictures of Professor Rafin esque f represents him correctly as I remember him when I knew him as Professor of Natural History in Transylvania University, in Lexington, Kentucky, from 1821 to July, 1825. The photograph is certainly a better"
