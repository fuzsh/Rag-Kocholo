        "text": "This was posted as an answer to an earlier version of the question titled\n\nDoes modern scholarship treat Samuel Rafinesque as credible?\n\n(See the question edit history for more information)\n\nIt is certainly true that Rafinesque classified native American peoples as 'Negroes'. However, I can find no evidence that Rafinesque's classification was ever widely adopted.\n\nThe quotes that you list are extracts from the first of Rafinesque's Four Letters on American History published in the Saturday Evening Post in Philadelphia (7 June 1828). Although I couldn't find the newspaper itself (except behind paywalls) I did find a transcript so you can read it in full.\n\nThe article The Primitive Black Nations of America, was published in the September 1832 issue of the journal Atlantic Journal and Friend of Knowledge, which was founded and edited by Rafinesque. He mentions that these claims were also in one of two 'memoirs' submitted to the Société de Géographie in Paris.\n\nHe tells us that the other memoir apparently rendered it\n\nprobable that all the Negroes originated in the Southern Slopes of the Imalaya [sic] Mountains.\n\nNeedless to say, neither this theory, nor his classification of Native Americans as Negroes is supported by modern scholarship.\n\nIn The life and writings of Rafinesque : prepared for the Filson Club and read at its meeting, Monday, April 2, 1894, we are told that:\n\nThe Société de Géographie gave him its gold medal, in 1832, for two memoirs on \"The Primitive Negroes of Asia and North America\", but these essays were never published.\n\np129\n\nWe are also told that:\n\nThe present whereabouts of this medal is unknown. In 1876 it was in possession of Doctor William Kent Gilbert, of Philadelphia.\n\nAnd that:\n\nAn illustration of it may be seen on page 99 of Potters American Monthly, Vol. VI, No. 50, 1876.\n\nVolume VI of Potter's American Monthly has been digitised and can be read on Google Books. The illustration appears on page 99:\n\nIt is interesting to compare the design with the first gold medal which was awarded to Captain John Franklin by the Société de Géographie in 1829:\n\nWhich does exhibit some similarities, but also some significant differences. Of course, it is possible that the design of the medal had changed.\n\nWikipedia has a list of recipients of the Grande Médaille d’Or des Explorations et Voyages de Découverte (Great Gold Medal of Exploration and Journeys of Discovery) from the Société de Géographie. However, this shows that the medal in 1832 was awarded to Jean Baptiste Douville.\n\nPerhaps Rafinesque was awarded some other gold medal by the Société de Géographie.\n\nConstantine Samuel Rafinesque is often described as an autodidact, an eccentric, or a flawed genius. He has also been described as \"complex\" and \"erratic and difficult\"!\n\nThe language in the extracts you have provided is offensively racist, even by the standards of the early nineteenth century but, as far as I can see, they do not appear to be atypical examples. This might account for some modern descriptions of him as a \"complex\" character.\n\nAn autobiographical sketch of his life and bibliography was published by T.J. Fitzpatrick in 1911, while the view of modern scholarship on his work is covered fairly well in his Wikipedia article.\n\nHowever, one well-documented example from his work - the story of Walam Olum - may give us some insight into the character and credibility of the man.\n\nIn 1836, Rafinesque published what he claimed to be an English translation of the entire text of the Walam Olum in his first volume of The American Nations. He subsequently claimed that the original tablets and transcription had been lost (although he never furnished details of how they had been lost), leaving his notes and transcriptions as the only surviving evidence."
