Or perhaps you think of the large bovines in Africa?\n\nYes, all of those are named buffalo (although bison are, technically, entirely different). But there’s also another buffalo: the buffalo fish.\n\nAnd the buffalo fish has an unusual backstory to its name.\n\nThe story starts with a French genius at (no joke) Transylvania University in the early 1800s.\n\nHello, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz\n\nIn 1783, a man named Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz was born in the Ottoman Empire, near Constantinople. He grew up in Marseilles, France, where he taught himself Greek and Latin. He never attended a formal university, but taught himself botany and zoology."
