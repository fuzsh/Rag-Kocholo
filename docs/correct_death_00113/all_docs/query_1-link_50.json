        "text": "THE PRIMITIVE BLACK NATIONS OF AMERICA\n\nProfessor Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, 1832\n\n“In none of these analyses the first Americans show any resemblance to either\n\nnortheast Asians or modern native Americans”\n\nNeves, Lapa Vermelha IB Hominid 1, morphological affinities of the earliest known American, pointed out that the aboriginals found in North America resembled what currently could be described as African-Americans, “an unresolved morphological position between modern South Pacific and Europeans.” Researchers from Spain, Mexico and Argentina wrote an article which also acknowledged that Paleo-Americans do not look like modern American Indians.\n\n\"We can no longer say that the first colonizers of the Americas came from the north of Asia, as previous models have proposed,'' said Dr. Walter Neves, an anthropologist at the University of Sao Paulo, who made the initial discovery along with an Argentine colleague, Hector Pucciarelli. ''This skeleton is nearly 2,000 years older than any skeleton ever found in the Americas, and it does not look like those of Amerindians or North Asians.''\n\nBelow are descriptions of some of the inhabitants of the Americas from the book, THE PRIMITIVE BLACK NATIONS OF AMERICA by Professor Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, printed in 1832.\n\nThe Native American Negroes or black Indians have been seen in Brazil, Guyana, Caraccas (Venezuela), Popayan (Columbia), Choco (Panama), North California and etc.\n\nThe Yamasees or Jamasi were remarkably Black people notices of Carolinas, Florida and Georgia (Note, these were ALL SLAVE HOLDING STATES)\n\nThe Spaniards were met by Black Indians in Louisiana in 1543.\n\nThe Aroras or Caroras of Cumana (Peru), were black, but with fine features and long hair, like the Jolofs and Gallahs of Africa.\n\nThe Esteros latitude 32, (Chile) are like the Hottentots and the Numuquas, Tambukis, and many other Nigritian tribes, not black, but dark brown, yet complete Negroes, with large thick lips, broad flat noses, with hair crisped or curly. All these tribes live in New California (New Mexico territory at the time)\n\nThe American Negroes of Quarenqua, in Choco, (the great level plain 900 miles long, 90 wide, separating the Andes of South America from the mountains of Panama,) were black and with woolly heads in 1506. They are mentioned by Dangleria, and all the early accurate writers.\n\nThe Ancient Caracoles of Haiti, represented as a Nation of Beasts by the Historical Songs.\n\nThe Califurnams of the Carib Islands, called Black Caribs or Guauini by others, are a black branch of Caribs. (Caribbean Islands).\n\nThe Arquahos of Cutara mentioned by Garcias in the West Indies, quite black.\n\nThe Aroras of Raleigh or Yaruras of the Spaniards, black or brown Negroes, yet existing near the Oronoco (Venezuela), The Chaymas of Guyana (South America) brown Negroes like Hottentots ( Hottentots were South African people).\n\nThe Manjipas and Porcigis of Nienhof, the Motayas of Knivet are all of Brazil, brown Negroes with curly hair.\n\nThe Nigritas of Martyr in Darien, yet existing in Choco under the name of Chuanas or Gaunas or Chinos (Dariente)- Columbia, were Black or Red Negroes.\n\nThe Manabies of Popayan (in Columbia) blackish with Negro features and hair.\n\nThe Guabas and Jaras of Tegucigalpa near the Honduras, blackish Negroes.\n\nThe Moon-eyed Negroes, and Albinos, destroyed by the Cherokees, and seen in Panama.\"\n\nThe languages of these people:\n\nThe Yarura language has 50 per cent of analogy with the Gauna, 40 per cent with the Ashanti or Fanti of Guinea, and about 33 percent with the Fulah, Bornu and Congo languages of Africa. In Asia it has 39 per cent of numerical affinity with the Samang Negroes, and 40 per cent with the Negroes of Andaman as well as those of Australia or New Holland.\n\nCreek Indians - given that name by the europeans because they lived along the Ochee Creek (today known as the Ocmulgee River).\n\nThe Ocmulgee and Lamar mounds as well as the mounds in Hawkinsville, were excavated in the 1930s’. These sites had evidence of 17,000 years of continuous human habitation. All of the artefacts and evidence of who these people really were, was shipped off to a basement somewhere in Florida. There is a museum on the grounds of the Ocmulgee Historical National Park, why not house and display them there? What are they hiding about the true Georgia Indians?\n\nPeople that look like Elizabeth Warren lied…she as well as many that look like her have no native American blood in their veins, just as many other “whitewashed” so-called native Americans of today. Europeans did not come across the waters and slaughter people that look like them. Just know that only a few of our African ancestors came here on the bottom of ships, many of them were already here and made slaves.\n\nThe above is a map of North America labeled with the names of the tribes that inhabited this land. What happened to all of these tribes of indigenous people of Turtle Island, known today as North America?\n\nWhen the european setters landed in America, they brought with them war, they raped the women and girls, killed the men, committing mass murder, many died by the thousands from the nasty diseases the europeans brought with them, i.e. Smallpox and syphilis, and mass enslavement.\n\nThe millions of the indigenous Americans, or rather Indians, who ‘disappeared’ after 1492 did not all die in the ‘holocaust’ inflicted within America. Hundreds of thousands were shipped to Europe and Africa as Indian slaves and just as many died on the journey. The whole slave trade story was given to all of us in reverse. A mass colony of Africans were not shipped from Africa to America. The truth is that Black Indians were shipped from America to Europe! They were then shipped from Spain to Africa as commodity for African resources. These Black Indians, now mistaken as African Americans, were shipped back to America and classified as “African Slaves.” This part of our history is what the school systems fail to mention in history programs.\n\nEvery European nation that colonized North America utilized Indian slaves for construction, plantations and mining on the North American continent but more frequently in their outposts in the Caribbean and in the metropolis of Europe. During the mid 1500’s and well into the 1600’s, while the trade of tobacco, corn, rice and the enslavement of some of the Indigenous people were already in progress. Spaniard colonists of Portugal were colonizing lands in Southeast and Southwest Africa, while simultaneously colonizing nearly all of South America and southern geographical locations of North America.\n\nAccording to archived records and documents by Spain, during this time period, many of the Spanish colonists dubbed the Indigenous people of the Americas as Negros and Negras based solely on their genders and the shade of their skin tones, and not their domicile of origins.\n\nThe English settler John Rolfe’s journal, currently located in full at the National Archives facilities in London, he documented the round-trip shipments of the tobacco, silver and gold, and the famously known quote “20 and Odd Negras,” which was changed by the Department of Historic Resources of Virginia three times from “20 and Odd Negras” to “20 and Odd Negros” to now officially read today as “20 and Odd Africans” commencing in 1992.\n\nAll historians note that nowhere is there more authentic documentation than in South Carolina, also known as the original English colony of Carolina, established in 1670. It is estimated that between 1650 and 1730 at least 50,000 Indians (and likely more due to transactions hidden to avoid paying government tariffs and taxes) were exported by the English alone to their Caribbean outposts. Between 1670 and 1717 far more Indians were exported than Africans were imported. In southern coastal regions entire tribes were exterminated through slavery compared to disease or war.\n\nSo now you can understand the confusion that was designed through the format of eugenics; to make it seem as if the Africans and the Indigenous people of North America, are one in the same….when they’re not. And this is where the mistake stimulated from."
