Masterson, Editor Anna Marie Kane, Assistant ,J.. ^■^•v•» UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE WASHINGTON : I952 For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office Washington 25, D. C. Price J2.00 (cloth) ^ To the Memory of GRACE GARDNER GRIFFIN Editor, 1908-1949 Preface This volume, a classified list of books and articles on United States history published during 1948, continues a series of volumes of which the latest, for 1939 and 1940, was issued in 1949. No volumes have been prepared for the years 1941-47. The first volume of this series, listing publications of 1902, was issued in 1904, and the second, for publications of 1903, in 1905. The years 1904 and 1905 were not covered. Writings published during the 3^ears 1906-40 were listed in 33 volumes edited by Grace Gardner Griffin. Miss Griffin retired from the editorship in 1949 after 41 years of service. Her achievement in American historical bibliography has never been paralleled. The present volume and a volume for 1949 were prepared by the Library of Congress between July 6, 1949, and April 2, 1951, with funds provided by the American Historical Association. The work was done under the general supervision of vSolon J. Buck as occupant of the Chair of American History. On December 12, 1951, the National Historical Publications Com- mission, at the request of the Executive Secretary of the American Historical Association, assumed responsibility for preparing the Writings and seeing the volumes through the press. It is understood that the Writings will continue to be printed as parts of the annual reports of the Association. The Commission's only responsibility for the volume for 1948 has been to complete the reading of proofs. The volume for 1949 is in press, and work on the volume for 1950 is nearing completion. No pro- vision has yet been made for preparing the volumes for 1941-47. The main differences between this volume and its predecessors are the following: (1) Only titles pertaining to the history of the United States are included. (2) Reviews are not cited. (3) Duplicate citation of titles, and cross references within the text, are discontinued; each title is cited only once. (4) Biographical titles, and titles designated as \"sources and documents,\" are not separated from other titles. (5) Titles are arranged, as far as possible, by regions, and topical classification is confined to titles that pertain to the United States in general. (6) Titles pertaining to relations of the United States with foreign powers, and to activities of American citizens, agencies, and organizations abroad, are grouped in a separate; section. (7) Titles are cited clu'onologically accord- ing to beginning date of subject matter, not alphabetically by author or by first word of title. (8) Illustrations, such as maps and portraits, are cited for articles as well as for titles published separately. (9) Footnotes or VII notes at ends of chapters or volumes, citing sources of information or of quotations, with page references, are designated by the word \"notes.\" (10) The index is expanded for the accommodation of readers who wish to pursue single topics through all regions and periods, and whose needs in this respect are not met by the present scheme of arrangement. (11) The format and typography of the volume are revised for greater compactness. This volume is designed to include every book and article, however brief, that has any considerable value for study and research in the history of the United States from prehistoric times to the end of 1945. Works mainly descriptive of present conditions, and those dealing mainly with current affairs, are cited when they present historical information that seems difficult to obtain from other sources or that may be useful as a clue to such sources. A few publications of which the texts may have little value for historical purposes have been listed because they contain illustrations of historical value. All publications cited in this volume have been examined by the editor. An attempt has been made to cite in the volume for 1949 the relevant publications issued during 1948 that were not seen while the volume for 1948 was in course of preparation. nil Contents Page The
