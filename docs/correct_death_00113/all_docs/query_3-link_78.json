        "text": "August 2, 2019\n\nI first heard of this work when the internet first began and I was in a semi-private chat room full of Indians.\n\nThey were lamenting the fact that some white man preserved more accurately and further back than any of them their extremely ancient lore and chronology. It was a shameful irony to them.\n\nAnd they also were lamenting the fact no one had ever heard of his works either or cared.\n\nI was hooked; I had to have his works, come what may, at that point and spent days looking for them online. They are there.\n\nThis author was a kind hearted man dedicated to just accurately preserving what he was told and was horrified no one in his day was wanting to learn all the vast lore of the Indians but just wanted to partake instead in “manifesting” as they say today (“manifest destiny”).\n\nWhat did he get as a result of such dedication? He had his university position and small stipend illegally stolen from him through the standard upper class shenanigans of a few sadists; done just for the kick of it when they had plenty of money. He placed a curse upon them then he died penniless and sick and alone (having never married in order to dedicate himself to such work robbed from him).\n\nMay we further his day and night tireless endeavors to save the Indians vast lore when everyone else could care less."
