        "meta_description": "The film begins by showing the introductory speaker at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. The speaker introduces the incumbent president of the United States, William F. McKinley. The remainder of the film is a straight-on moving photograph of the president during his last public speech. \"In this picture we present a wonderful and life-like likeness of President McKinley. He first walks upon the platform, escorting Mrs. McKinley, whom he very reverently shows to a seat. The President is next introduced to the audience by President Milburn, of the Pan-American Exposition, and, amid hand-clapping, cheering, and waving of hats, he at once begins his memorable speech. He is close to our camera and we secured an absolutely perfect photograph\"--Edison films catalog.",
