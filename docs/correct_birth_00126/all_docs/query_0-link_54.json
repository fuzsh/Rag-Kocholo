        "text": "For McKinley's final resting place, see McKinley National Memorial.\n\nQuick facts for kids\n\nNational McKinley Birthplace Memorial\n\nThe Memorial in 2008, undergoing renovation.\n\nLocation in Ohio\n\nShow map of Ohio\n\nLocation in the United States\n\nShow map of the United States\n\nLocation 40 N. Main Street\n\nNiles, Ohio Area Less than one acre Built 1915 Architect McKim, Mead and White Architectural style Beaux-Arts (exterior) NRHP reference No. 75001544 Added to NRHP October 31, 1975\n\nThe National McKinley Birthplace Memorial Library and Museum is the national memorial to President William McKinley located in Niles, Ohio. Also known as the McKinley Memorial Library, Museum & Birthplace Home, the Memorial is a 232 by 136 by 38 ft (71 by 41 by 12 m) marble monument with two wings. One houses the McKinley Memorial Library, which is a public library. The second wing features the McKinley Museum, with exhibits about President McKinley, and an auditorium.\n\nThe McKinley Birthplace Home and Research Center is located near the Memorial at 40 South Main Street in Niles. The historic house museum has been furnished for the period when President McKinley was in office.\n\nHistory\n\nPlanning\n\nOn March 4, 1911, President William Howard Taft as Commander-in-Chief, authorized Congressional funding for a national memorial to be located in the town of McKinley's birth: Niles, Ohio. The same act of Congress had also officially established the National McKinley Birthplace Association. Association President Joseph G. Butler, Jr., who had been a childhood friend and schoolmate of McKinley, began a $100,000 local campaign to raise funds for the Memorial in 1912. After securing nearly $200,000 for the Memorial without utilizing taxpayer funding, Butler and the Association sought public donations of $1 each to establish a permanent endowment. \"Subscribers\" (as the donors were called) would receive a book autographed by Butler \"describing the work of the Memorial\" that also contained a reproduction portrait of McKinley and \"a facsimile of the act of Congress authorizing and commending the construction of the Birthplace Memorial.\"\n\nCompetition and design\n\nThe Association had its own ideas for the Memorial's general design when they announced plans to offer a prize for the best architectural proposal in 1914. The city of Niles had already set aside a five-acre park as a location for the Memorial (purchased with municipal funds), and the Association stipulated that the design would be for a granite two-story structure with a basement, and that the structure must include a 1,000-seat auditorium (the \"main feature\"), a public library, a \"relic room\" for display of assorted effects, \"an assembly hall for meetings of the veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic, where State encampments may be held, and for Spanish–American War Veterans, and a room for the meetings of officials of the city.\" Additionally, the Association specified that the Memorial would house not only a statue of McKinley, but also \"bronze busts of men associated with him in the affairs of the nation,\" such as Theodore Roosevelt, Marcus Hanna, Butler, and Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, the latter two of whom were large contributors to the Memorial's fund. Upon publication of the Association's announcement, a competition commenced within the American Institute of Architects.\n\nEdgerton Swartout (who was once an architect at McKim, Mead and White), Charles A. Platt (American landscape architect), and Edward Brodhead Green (Albright-Knox Art Gallery)served as judges for the competition, which comprised entries from Cass Gilbert (architect of the Woolworth Building), Henry Bacon (designer of the Lincoln Memorial), Harold Van Buren Magonigle (architect of the McKinley National Memorial and Mausoleum), Palmer, Hornbostel and Jones (a partner of which worked on the Queensboro Bridge), J. L. Decker (a local architect in Niles), and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary (designers of the Detroit Institute of Arts).\n\nIn 1915, the competition was concluded, and the $1,000 prize was awarded to McKim, Mead, and White. Their design, somewhat typical of their other Beaux-Arts work, reflected Greek and Roman themes in all aspects, from architectural elements to the lettering on tablets and statuary. Indeed, the entire Memorial was described not unlike a temple of antiquity, with McKinley assuming the role of \"household god\":\n\n\"Seen from the approach on Main Street, the building will be dominated by its central feature, a colonnade or propylaea leading into a court of honor.\n\nIt is this court, the atrium of the old Roman palaces where the statue of the household god stood, which is to be the climax of the entire structure.\"\n\nThe library was divided into two stories, with space for open stacks and meeting rooms, including one reserved for McKinley memorabilia. The auditorium, notably, was originally designed with 200 fewer seats than originally called for, and was expressly not to be for \"theatrical entertainments.\"\n\nMcKinley's statue, by J. Massey Rhind, originally conceived as a bronze monument, was carved from a single thirty-five ton piece of marble.\n\nConstruction\n\nThe cornerstone of the Memorial was laid on November 20, 1915, and an inscribed plaque on it read \"Erected 1915. To Perpetuate the Name and Achievements of William McKinley, Twenty-fifth President of the United States of America. Born January 29, 1843. Died September 14, 1901.\" The United States Marine Band played \"On the Beautiful Blue Danube\" (a favorite of Mrs. McKinley's) and \"Lead Kindly Light\" (reportedly a hymn sung at McKinley's deathbed) after a parade of organizations to which McKinley belonged proceeded down Niles' Main Street.\n\nJohn H. Parker Co. of New York oversaw the site's construction.\n\nDespite the Memorial Association's specification for a granite structure, Georgia marble was used instead.\n\nDedication\n\nFormer President Taft (also an Ohio native), in a speech endorsing American involvement in World War I, praised McKinley at the Memorial's dedication ceremonies on October 5, 1917. McKinley's sister, Miss Helen McKinley, was on hand to unveil her brother's twelve-foot statue; Myron T. Herrick, George B. Cortelyou, and Butler also spoke for the program. The McKinley Birthplace Memorial gold dollar was minted to finance the construction of the memorial.\n\nCurrent status\n\nThe McKinley Memorial Library is open to the public six days a week and closed on Sundays and on certain holidays. The McKinley Memorial Museum is also open to the public Tuesday to Friday with no admission charge.\n\nRehabilitation\n\nIn 2008, the Memorial underwent renovation to clean and repair the marble façade."
