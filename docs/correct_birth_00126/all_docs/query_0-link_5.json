        "text": "President Wm. McKinley's Birthplace.\n\nLot #20 has had a long and interesting history. It was platted by James Heaton in 1834 and was 66 x 181.5 ft. At some point in the next eleven years a two-story colonial style structure with lap siding was built on the property, and it was this six-room double house that William McKinley Sr. and Nancy Allison McKinley rented as a home for their growing family. William Jr. and a younger sister, Abigail, were born in the upstairs corner bedroom.\n\nThe family moved out of this house and went to Poland, Ohio when William was nine years old in search of higher education. William saw his birthplace only once more when he was the governor of Ohio. He and his mother stopped in Niles and made a short visit to the house. He subsequently spoke to the large crowd that had gathered in front of the building from the small second-story porch.\n\nThe house existed on that site until a few years before McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Lot 20 had been divided into Lot 20A and Lot 20 B&C and had gone through several owners. In one photo of the house from 1896, a grocery store occupies part of the building. There were other reliable reports that an ice cream parlor had also rented space on the site. Niles was growing, however and Lot 20 was too valuable an asset to allow an older, smaller residence to take up the space that could be better occupied by a more modern building.\n\nSometime before 1875 the house was enlarged and converted into a store owned by J. S. Benedict. In 1890 the land upon which McKinley’s house stood on Main Street, was needed as a site for the City National Bank (later McKinley bank).\n\nIt was not known who undertook and financed the project, but McKinley’s house was cut in two and the part in which McKinley had been born was moved to Riverside Park along the Meander Creek, sometime after the park began operating, possibly as a museum attraction. The second half of the house was moved to Franklin Alley and used as a shop where the Harris rotary offset presses were made."
