        "text": "\"MRS. M'KINLEY IN ETERNAL SLEEP.\"\n\nAccording to headlines in the Sunday Repository, the passing of the mother of President William McKinley on Dec. 12, 1897, was a peaceful one.\n\n\"Mother Of the President Dies at 2 O'clock This Morning While the Children, Aged Sister and Other Relatives Are Gathered About the Couch,\" the newspaper assured its readers. \"Dissolution Comes In A Painless Manner.\"\n\nStill, the death of Nancy Allison McKinley was a lingering and likely agonizing one for the president and his family, with the days of her declining health played out for more than a week on the front pages of The Canton Repository and other newspapers throughout Ohio and the country.\n\n\"MRS. NANCY A. M'KINLEY PARALYZED,\" a bold headline in the Repository reported Dec. 2, 1897, following what was diagnosed as a stroke. \"SORROWFUL NEWS SENT TO WASHINGTON,\" another headline said about the family forwarding news of his mother's probable passing to the president.\n\n\"It is feared that her death is only a question of a short time,\" a story beneath the headlines said. \"The paralysis at present is of but a mild form, but owing to her extreme age, nearly 89 years, Dr. Phillips, the attending physician, can give but little hope to the family.\"\n\nOn the advice of Mrs. McKinley's doctor and another son, Abner McKinley, who was present when she suffered her stroke, the president was urged to wait a day for additional diagnosis before leaving Washington.\n\n\"The physician's statement to the family was that there was little doubt that the attack would ultimately result in death, but there was no indication yet as to just when the end might come,\" reported the Repository. \"The end might be in a short time or it might be in a week or even a longer interval.\"\n\nGathering of family\n\nSo there was time to gather the family of Mother McKinley to her deathbed.\n\nPatricia Scarmuzzi, curator of collections for the National McKinley Birthplace Museum in Niles, Ohio, noted that Mother McKinley had a large family, as was the custom of her day.\n\n\"Nancy Campbell Allison McKinley was born on a farm in New Lisbon (now just Lisbon) Columbiana County, Ohio,\" said biographical information that Scarmuzzi supplied. \"She was a hardy woman. She and William McKinley Sr. were married and later moved to Niles.\n\n\"Nancy and William Sr. had nine children. They wanted their children to be able to go beyond the eighth grade (which is where those attending our one-room school here in Niles ended their educations). And so Poland, Mahoning County, Ohio had the Poland Union Academy, which educated students through grade 12. The McKinley family moved to Poland, Ohio in 1852, so that their children could attend this school. ... Mrs. McKinley emphasized education and expected the children to apply themselves to their studies.\"\n\nScarmuzzi noted that McKinley's mother was patriotic to the national causes of her country, such as the Civil War.\n\n\"When young William enlisted in the Union Army in 1861, 'Mother' McKinley gave her blessing.\"\n\nAfter the children had grown up, the McKinleys relocated to Canton, said Scarmuzzi. They lived with their daughters, Anna and Helen, the museum curator said.\n\n\"Mrs. McKinley later stated that she did not believe that she had done anything to influence her son's decision to become president. She stated that honesty and loyalty were the best traits one could have when becoming president.\"\n\nWife and mother\n\nHoward Wayne Morgan similarly paints a portrait in words of Nancy Allison McKinley as a dedicated wife and mother in his book \"William McKinley and His America,\" published by Kent State University in 2003. In it, the historian notes that she was a complement to William McKinley Sr.\n\n\"Nancy Allison, whom he married in 1829, was a perfect companion for the pious, industrious, and independent McKinley,\" Morgan writes, noting that a hardiness \"was evident in everything Nancy Allison McKinley undertook\" in her life. \"Like her husband, she was descended from early immigrants, both English and Scotch Irish. Her ancestors had fled England to live in Holland, where they could better practice their Puritanism. ...\"\n\nMorgan's book notes that \"Nancy Allison McKinley profoundly influenced all her children, and especially William Jr.,\" raising them while William McKinley Sr. went about work in his furnace business.\n\n\"Her husband was often absent on business, and the duties of raising their large family fell mainly upon her,\" writes Morgan. \"She accepted the burden without comment. If she thought her lot hard she never said so. The family formed the center of her life, and she was a devoted, if often stern, mother. Her fondness never became weakness, nor did love for the children prevent her from raising them with the strict discipline that turned love into the deeper sense of responsibility that motivated her family.\n\n\"Mother McKinley, as she was affectionately called, lived to see her son successful. Her lifetime of good works and solid if prosaic loving gave her the perspective of common sense. 'Mother McKinley was the leader in Niles of much that was good,' a childhood friend of her son remembered. 'I recall her quiet dignity of manner,' another noted. 'She was just the same in the midst of common-place duties as in a palace if she had been reigning there.'\"\n\nMorgan's book notes that \"rural isolation and the need for self-help sharpened Mrs. McKinley's sense of responsibility to her family and neighbors.\"\n\n\"She tended sick friends, bore her share of the community's problems, and acted as peacemaker, for she detested strife. She boarded visiting ministers and teachers. She and her sister had charge of the Methodist Church in Niles, and swept, scrubbed, painted, and tended it with the same efficient thoroughness they applied to their own hearts and homes. According to one recollection, they 'ran the church, all but the preaching.'\n\n\"When she visited relatives in other towns, she thought nothing of the necessary horseback ride, or of perching the youngest held on her lap so that he too might see distant cousins and aunts. No amount of worldly fame could offset in her eyes anyone's failures to use all their talents. She was later proud of William's political accomplishments, but remained undemonstrative. When he was governor of Ohio, she took the train to see him, and when a fellow passenger asked if she had relatives in Columbus, she replied only: 'Yes, I have a son there.' Few who knew her at any stage in her life would suspect her of producing a president, least of all herself. 'After all, I don't believe I did raise the boy to be president,' she said in her later years. 'I tried to bring up the boy to be a good man, and that is the best that any mother can do. The first thing I knew, my son turned around and began to raise me to be the mother of a president.\n\nLife at end\n\nSo it was not only her son's position as president that garnered attention to the funeral of Mother McKinley, a service that took place on Dec. 15, 1897.\n\n\"FOLLOWED TO LAST RESTING PLACE,\" a Repository headline reported on that day. \"Remains of Mrs. Nancy Allison McKinley Interred in Westlawn Cemetery After Thousands of People Had Viewed Them At the First Methodist-Episcopal Church.\"\n\n\"A Touching Tribute From The Pastor,\" said another headline, while a grouping of smaller headlines reported such news as \"Last Sad Rites Held in Memory of a Beloved Mother and Honored Friend -- Business Suspended in the City and From All Sections of the Nation Come Distinguished Personages to Bow With the President and Other Relatives of the Family of the Noble Woman Whose Remains Are Consigned to the Tomb -- Floral Tributes of Beautiful Design Received From Many People.\"\n\nInclement weather lent an atmosphere of darkness to an already sad scene at the church and in West Lawn Cemetery. But mourners were not deterred in paying respects.\n\n\"Rain began last evening and has continued almost incessantly ever since and everything is dismal and gloomy in consequence,\" reported the Repository. \"But regardless of the weather the streets early began to fill with those who desired to attend the services.\"\n\nPresident McKinley occupied the front pew of the center section of the church, said the newspaper article, directly below the pulpit.\n\n\"The same remarkable self-possession characteristic of his whole life was manifest on this occasion. He showed little outward evidence of the sorrow he experienced in this his hour of bereavement.\"\n\nThe eulogy of minister C.E. Manchester captured the both the personal and the public mourning that took place in the wake of the passing of Mother McKinley.\n\n\"She who has gone out from our midst was a friend,\" Manchester said. \"The nation knows her as the distinguished mother; we of the home city know her as one whose kindly word and smile have been a cheer and a benediction to many a heart and home.\""
