The letter was sent October 3, 1899, and in it, they plead for a guarantee of civil rights as set forth in the U.S. Constitution to enable African Americans to rise out of poverty, ignorance and social degradation.\n\nFull Transcript of \"Open Letter to President McKinley\"\n\nTranscribed Excerpts from \"Open Letter to President McKinley\"\n\nSource-Dependent Questions\n\nUsing evidence from the open letter, explain the Colored People of Boston's understanding of the proper relationship between themselves and the president.\n\nUsing your previous knowledge, explain why the Colored People of Boston felt the need to appeal to the national government.\n\nThe Colored People of Boston referred to President McKinley's April 11, 1896, speech to Congress in which he requested a declaration of war to drive the Spanish out of Cuba. For what reasons did McKinley ask to fight the Spanish? How did the Colored People of Boston use those words to meet their purpose in writing?\n\nUse at least two passages from the open letter to explain its tone.\n\nCitation Information\n\n\"Open Letter to President McKinley,\" Colored National League, 1899.
