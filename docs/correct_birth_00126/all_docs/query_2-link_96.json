        "text": "Majestic McKinley Monument Honors 25th President\n\n“I have never been in doubt since I was old enough to think intelligently, that I would someday be made president.” These words were spoken during his youth by William McKinley, the first president to ride in an automobile while in office as well as the first to use a telephone as part of his campaign.\n\nThe resting place of William McKinley, 25th president of the United States, catches your eye over the tree tops while driving down I-77 through Canton, Ohio. The domed mausoleum is more than a mere resting place but serves as a monument to Canton’s favorite son and former governor of Ohio.\n\nThere are several reasons that McKinley is a favorite in this area even though he was born in Niles, Ohio. Canton is where he started his law career, found his true love, and ran for the highest office in the land. While attending the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, President McKinley was assassinated just seconds after giving the good luck red carnation from his label to a little girl waiting in line.\n\nIn 1905 construction began after selecting a memorial design drafted by Harold Van Buren Magonigle. This architect began his career at the age of thirteen when he worked as a draftsman for the firm that designed Central Park in New York City.\n\nThe amount being raised for the purchase of land and the mausoleum was $600,000. Local businesses and friends were large contributors. However, many school children contributed their pennies toward the building of this mausoleum, which was completed in 1907.\n\nThe front steps seem to be a real attraction for area residents as a wonderful place for exercise, either walking or running. Since there are 108 steps up to the McKinley Monument, it is a challenge to young and old alike. The front steps are fifty feet wide and are broken into four flights of twenty-four steps with the final flight having only twelve.\n\nNearing the top of the stairs, visitors are greeted by a 9 1/2′ bronze statue of William McKinley created by Charles Henry Nishaus. It depicts President McKinley delivering his final public address at Buffalo, NY in 1901.\n\nThe circular, domed mausoleum recaptured the spirit of ancient cultures and formed the center of the cross design Magonigle intended to create. The longer arm of the cross was formed by front steps and what was called Long Water.\n\nOriginally Long Water was a spectacular part of the monument with a 575-foot lagoon, consisting of five different water levels cascading downward into a reflecting pool. Unfortunately, due to stagnant water caused by poor circulation, this lagoon was filled back in the 1950’s. Both side arms of the cross were formed by shorter entry steps, and the top portion was a driveway behind the monument.\n\nMagonigle considered this shape to have a double meaning. The upper part of the cross resembled the handle of a sword, while the Long Water symbolized the blade. This seemed appropriate due to McKinley’s military career during the Civil War as well as his being commander-in-chief during the Spanish-American War.\n\nAbove ground in the pink marble memorial, President McKinley and his First Lady are entombed in two side-by-side sarcophagi of elegant green granite on a dark maroon granite base. Their two daughters have found their final resting place here also, entombed in the back wall of the memorial. Katherine died at the age of four from typhoid fever while Ida died during her first year.\n\nWreaths are constantly being placed by individuals and organizations at the foot of the granite-clad coffins. Most of the wreaths are in traditional red, white and blue.\n\nSeventy-five feet overhead is a beautiful red, white and blue skylight with a 45 star design, representing the number of states in the Union at the time of McKinley’s death. While it looks small from below, this beautiful window to the sky measures twelve feet in diameter.\n\nIf you wish to visit the memorial without climbing all those stairs, there are two possibilities. A steep road leads up the hill behind the Memorial or there is also an elevator, which operates only during museum business hours by use of a special code, which you must ask for at the museum’s admission office nearby. Admission to the McKinley Monument is free.\n\nHopefully, this monument and the life of William McKinley will be an inspiration to someone today. President McKinley had hoped for this when he said, “That’s all a man can hope for during his lifetime, to set an example, and when he is dead, to be an inspiration to history.”\n\nThe McKinley Monument is located in downtown Canton, Ohio just off I-77. Take Exit 105 for OH 172, then turn right on 7th Street NW. Take the first left onto McKinley Monument Drive and enjoy a little piece of history.\n\nZoar Village Garden’s Symbolic Design\n\nSummer time and the flowers are blooming! The beautiful garden at Zoar Village seems most spectacular during the month of July. An entire block of vegetable and flower beds will have you wanting to find a seat and enjoy the scenery, or casually stroll down the pathways.\n\nLong ago this garden began as a place for the communal village to grow their vegetables as well as brighten their life with flowers. Who tended those early gardens at Zoar? School boys and elderly men received this assignment as the female occupants all had household chores that must be done daily, while the men were either working the fields or building the Ohio and Erie Canal.\n\nThe spectacular Zoar Garden symbolized New Jerusalem to those German Separatists in the early 1800s. At its center stands a tall, slightly bent, Norway spruce, which represents Jesus. Surrounding the tall pine, twelve smaller junipers depict the twelve disciples.\n\nThese in turn are circled by an arbor vitae hedge, indicating heaven. Paths in the garden are proclaimed as pathways to paradise showing that no matter what path you take, if you look to Christ, you will be led to heaven.These people had strong religious beliefs now that they were free to worship as they pleased in the United States.\n\nAt the north end of the garden stands the Gardener’s House, which served as residence for gardener, Simon Beuter, and his family back in 1835. Shortly thereafter, a greenhouse, or hothouse, was added. Since they grew oranges, lemons and other fruit in the middle of winter in the greenhouse, it was also called the Orangerie.\n\nHothouses were unheard of in Ohio at this time. The tropical fruit trees were kept outside in large wooden tubs in the summer, but could easily be moved into the greenhouse during the cold winter months. After the Ohio and Erie Canal was built, wealthy Clevelanders would send their plants during winter to Zoar to be kept in the greenhouse, because of its unique underground heating system.\n\nResearch shows the Separatists frequently used many home remedies for ailments so grew medicinal types of herbs in their communal garden. They also grew fresh fruits and vegetables to provide strawberries and cabbages for the Zoar Hotel, where President William McKinley often dined on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nAlong the streets of town, many residents have beautiful flower gardens of their own. Baskets of flowers grace fences, and bushes bloom with beauty. There is much to see and do throughout the village with costumed guides telling about life there long ago.\n\nWhile in the area take a stroll through Zoar Wetlands Arboretum or find the Trailhead nearby for the one-hundred mile long Towpath Trail of the old Ohio and Erie Canal.\n\nPlan a visit to delightful Zoar Village on the banks of the Tuscarawas River where a guide remarked, “You could live your whole life here and never need cash. They believed cash was corrupting. It turns out they were right.”\n\nZoar Village can be reached just three miles off I-77 at Exit 93 between Dover and Canton, Ohio.\n\nMcKinley Museum Spotlights Stark County\n\nNear the foot of the McKinley Monument, Stark County Historical Society has gathered interesting information and memorabilia regarding the surrounding area. as well as the life of William McKinley. The bust of McKinley greets visitors outside the building.\n\nAs you enter the lobby of the McKinley Museum in Canton, Ohio, a sign with a quote caught my eye. It was a word of advice to young people from President William McKinley:\n\n“Young men and women, what your education will be and do for you depends upon yourselves.”\n\nWithin these walls is quite an extensive history of the Stark County area including leading enterprises, such as Belden Brick, Dueber-Hampden Watch Company, Erie Canal, Hoover Vacuum, Pennsylvania Railroad, and Timken Company just to name a few. Henry Timken founded Timken Roller Bearing Company in 1902 and his entrepeneur vision was grounded in this type of thinking:\n\n“If you have an idea which you think is right, push it to a finish. But above all, don’t set your name to anything you will ever have cause to be ashamed of.”\n\nMcKinley Museum had many interesting exhibits throughout, too numerable to mention. Here are a few things that caught my eye on a recent visit.\n\nOne fascinating display showed a clock tower made by Dueber-Hampden Watch Co with a sign “Accurate to the Second.” That was way back in 1889! By 1890 the company was producing 600 watches a day in Canton, Ohio and had over a thousand employees. They used 14 karat gold in their watch cases and had 17 jewel movement, quite advanced for their time. This company was sold to a Russian company in 1927 and twenty-one former employees went to Russia to teach them their craft. One report is that their machinery is still being used in China today.\n\nThe Hoover Vacuum provided a display that attracted lines of children. While seated in a chair, they pressed a button which created enough suction to lift them well off the floor. The Power of the Hoover! It is very fitting to be highlighted here as the first upright vacuum was invented by a department store janitor, James Spangler, in Canton back in 1906. He just happened to show it to his cousin, Susan Hoover, who in turn shared it with her husband. “Boss” Hoover bought the patent from Spangler, hired him as Superintendent, and slowly began the switch from maker of leather-goods to vacuum manufacturer. The slogan: “It beats..as it Sweeps…as it Cleans” brought the Hoover Vacuum to the forefront.\n\nThis was the original hand-sewn 45 star American flag that hung on the front porch of McKinley’s home during the 1896 presidential campaign. During his famous “Front Porch Campaign”, McKinley made himself available to the public every Sunday afternoon on the front porch of his home. Usually he was seated in his rocking chair from which he talked to 750,000 people who stopped by. Some say he shook hands with up to a million men from that front porch scene. This campaign appealed to the average voter, who found themselves drawn to a candidate that stayed true to his roots.\n\nRooms were redesigned to look very much like the ones of long ago with their Victorian furnishings. A touch of some form of music was often in evidence as that would have been one of their main means of entertainment. In the parlor, you had an opportunity to listen to talking figures of William and Ida McKinley. Notice that he does have on his symbol, the red carnation.These plastic figures are activated by sensors when you enter the room.\n\nThe Hazlett Theater is a fine spot to give your feet a rest and watch some old films from days gone by. Here you hear about the campaigns of William McKinley and get to have an inside video tour of the Memorial.\n\nThere weren’t enough hours in the day, so sadly missed the show at the Hoover Price Planetarium where visitors view the solar system and beyond. They say it is like traveling to space without leaving the ground. Unfortunately, didn’t make it to Discover World either where dinosaurs and early American Indians welcome visitors to Natural History Island, Ecology Island and the new spot, Fascination Station. Looks like a return visit is in order.\n\nThe McKinley Museum is located in downtown Canton, Ohio just off I-77. Take Exit 105 for OH 172, then turn right on 7th Street NW. Take the first left onto McKinley Monument Drive where the Museum is located to the left when facing the memorial. Enjoy a little piece of Ohio history."
