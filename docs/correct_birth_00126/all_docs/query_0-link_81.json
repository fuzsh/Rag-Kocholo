        "text": "If you‚Äôre interested in learning all about the 25th president of the United States, the McKinley sites in Niles are the places to go. There website is a wealth of information on President William McKinley himself, the holdings and the architecture, and I recommend reading them if you haven‚Äôt already. Some tidbits of information were not on the tour and you‚Äôll appreciate them more if you‚Äôve just been there.\n\nOur docents recounted fascinating McKinley facts in both the museum and the birthplace home, and we saw a number of McKinley‚Äôs own and McKinley-related artifacts, some of which are pictured below, and others of which are on their website. The birthplace home, incidentally, is not original (but its location is), nor are its contents. Nonetheless, it gave us an idea of the way things were when McKinley lived in Niles.\n\nI‚Äôm not quite sure how the ‚ÄúOhio Presidents‚Äù presentation got superseded by a tour of the library (did that happen for every group, or just mine???) but I appreciate everyone‚Äôs graciousness with that. üôÇ\n\nI do recommend a visit and as always, the sites are free and open to the public. If you‚Äôd like a guided tour, be sure to call in advance so your walk through history will really come alive."
