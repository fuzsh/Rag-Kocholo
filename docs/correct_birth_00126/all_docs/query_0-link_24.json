The building was designed by McKim, Mead and White, and built on the site of a schoolhouse McKinley attended as a child, near his birthplace. It opened in 1917, with President Taft in attendance at the dedication. Half of the building houses a museum about McKinley, with a ceremonial hall and displays along the mezzanine. The other half of the building serves as the town’s public library.",
