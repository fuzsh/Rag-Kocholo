        "text": "Family and Education\n\nWilliam McKinley’s father and mother were both of Scottish ancestry. The first McKinley to come to America, known as David the Weaver, settled in York county, Pennsylvania, in 1743. William’s father and grandfather were managers of blast furnaces for smelting iron in what is now Lisbon, Ohio. In 1829 William’s father, also named William, married Nancy Allison. They moved the following year to Niles, Ohio.\n\nThe future president was born in Niles on January 29, 1843, the seventh of nine children. His mother was a strong, energetic woman, a leader in the frontier village and active in the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was said that she and her sister “ran the church, all but the preaching.” In 1852, when William was nine, the family moved to Poland, Ohio, to enroll the children in a private school. At the Poland Academy William showed a gift for public speaking. He organized and was elected president of a debate club at the school.\n\nAt age 17 William entered Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania. He stayed only a few months, returning home because of illness. Then, feeling that he could not afford to continue in college, he taught in a country school near Poland. He lived with his family and walked two and a half miles (about four kilometers) to the school. After school hours he worked as a clerk in the Poland post office.\n\nCivil War Service\n\nThat spring, in April 1861, the American Civil War broke out. In June McKinley joined the Union Army. His commanding officer was Rutherford B. Hayes, later to become president of the United States.\n\nAt the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, McKinley was in charge of the food supplies of his unit. The battle had started at daybreak. As the morning wore on, McKinley loaded a wagon with food and coffee and drove two miles to the front. General Hayes wrote of the incident:\n\nFrom his hands every man in the regiment was served with hot coffee and warm meats, a thing that had never occurred under similar circumstances in any other army in the world. He passed under fire and delivered, with his own hands, these things, so essential for the men for whom he was laboring.\n\nFollowing the battle, the governor of Ohio promoted McKinley to the rank of second lieutenant. McKinley’s courage and good judgment were displayed on many other occasions, and when the war ended he had the rank of major.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nMcKinley was the last U.S. president who was a Civil War veteran.\n\nYoung Lawyer\n\nAfter the war McKinley studied law for two years. He began a practice in Canton, Ohio, where his eldest sister, Anna, was a well-known teacher with many influential friends. McKinley became known for his honesty and for taking up unpopular causes. For example, the Ohio constitution gave the vote to white men only. McKinley believed that this was unjust, and he often spoke on the subject, facing unfriendly audiences without fear.\n\nAt one time miners engaged in a strike were arrested and charged with burning property. No other lawyer would defend them. McKinley acted as their lawyer and proved that most of them were innocent. Knowing they were penniless as a result of the long strike, he refused to accept payment for his services.\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nIn 1871 McKinley married Ida Saxton, the daughter of a Canton banker. The young couple had a daughter, Katie, in 1871 and another, Ida, in 1873. The future seemed bright—but soon tragedy struck. Both Ida McKinley’s mother and the couple’s infant daughter died within months of each other in 1873. Then, two years later, Katie died at age three.\n\nShattered by grief, Ida McKinley became ill and never recovered. She often experienced seizures that may have been caused by epilepsy, though doctors did not understand the illness at the time. William McKinley remained devoted to her. His unfailing attentiveness earned him great admiration from the public.\n\nTo discover more about McKinley, check out these links:\n\nWilliam McKinley: Meet the President\n\nWilliam McKinley: Political Career\n\nWilliam McKinley: Presidency"
