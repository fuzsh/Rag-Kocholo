        "text": "Oluadah Equiano (1745 – 1797)\n\nInscription: In September 1767 Olaudah Equiano c.1745 -1797 African Writer and Abolitionist, Spent time in this house, then home of his friends, the Guerin Sisters.\n\nIn November 2021, Songs of Praise aired a Black History Month special featuring the temporary installation of a blue heritage plaque to Olaudah Equiano. Formally known as Gustavus Vassa, Equiano is an important 18th century figure in British history. He was a leading abolitionist, and on publishing his book as related by himself on the horrors of human trafficking, the book became one of the most important firsthand accounts of slavery.\n\nEquiano was born of Nigerian origin, although whether he was born on the continent is a point of recent debate. Aged eight, he was sold in Virginia to Michael Pascal, then a junior Royal Naval officer and became Pascal’s personal servant; Equiano first came to England in 1754.\n\nEquiano’s considerable education was gained through the early aid of the Guerin sisters, cousins of his first master, Pascal. The sisters became his patrons on his first stay in London in 1757–59. They lived in Westminster, found a schoolmaster there for him, taught him to read, promoted his Christian education and baptism at St Margaret’s Westminster in February 1759.\n\nIn Pascal’s service, Equiano became a naval seaman and began a very eventful seagoing career, which enabled him to save enough money in order to purchase his freedom.\n\nHe returned to London as a free man on 13 September 1767, at Rotherhithe. The first people he sought were the Guerin sisters. He found them living at 111 Maze Hill and spent two weeks at the house. His first choice on being reunited with them was to work as a servant or butler. Instead, they helped him with his second choice, which was to be trained as a hairdresser, introducing him to a friend near the Haymarket, London.\n\nTo commemorate Olaudah Equiano’s stay at 111 Maze Hill, a blue heritage plaque was unveiled by the Nubian Jak Community Trust on 17th December 2021. Approval for the plaque on this Grade II property was granted by English Heritage/Historic England, with support from the Greenwich Society.\n\nOlaudah Equiano Bust made by artist Christy Symington (right) At the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.\n\nhttps://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-1137555"
