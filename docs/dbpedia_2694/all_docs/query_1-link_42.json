        "text": "Parliament Square. One of London’s most famous spots. It’s where you’ll find the Palace of Westminster (aka the Houses of Parliament), Westminster Abbey, and not far away is the London Eye, 10 Downing Street, and even Buckingham Palace. It’s normally the top spot on the tourist checklist. So here are five lesser-known facts with which you can impress your friends – whether you’re a first-time visitor or a London local!\n\nIt’s the location of the world’s first traffic light\n\nNot only has Parliament Square been at the forefront of politics over the centuries, but also of technological street safety innovation (although, I should say, with mixed success…!). In 1868, in the vicinity of the Churchill statue, in the NE corner of Parliament Square was the world’s first traffic light. I know. Crazy times. It was deemed such a benchmark historic moment that there’s even a green plaque dedicated to the event by Westminster tube station.\n\nThe use of the lights and the arms was because the lights were gas-powered and so weren’t bright enough to be seen during the day. That’s when you’d rely on the semaphore arms. The traffic light also wasn’t automatic and had to be controlled from the base by a police operator.\n\nThere were only 2 discernible issues in this otherwise flawless plan:\n\nIt kept breaking down and had the unfortunate tendency to explode – often to the detriment of the poor policeman operating the light.\n\nLots of people chose to ignore the traffic light anyway.\n\nOne of my favourite stories was featured in a nineteenth-century newspaper. A journalist was in a taxi on his way towards Parliament Square from across Westminster Bridge. When they neared this new red-light-green-light-wavy-arm contraption (as I assume early models were officially named), the man asked his cabbie, his driver, what the light meant. The cabdriver simply replied, ‘Another o’ them fakements put up to vex the poor cabbies.’\n\nUnsurprisingly, the traffic light was removed within about a year, and London didn’t get traffic lights again until 1926!\n\nThere are bells in the pubs which tell MPs when they need to vote\n\nNot just any bells, but Parliamentary Division Bells, which sound very official and important – they’re basically “It’s time to vote” bells. Within the Palace of Westminster are the Houses of Parliament (consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords), where our government debate and vote on the issues of the day. When the Speaker calls a vote – known as a division – the Members of Parliament who aren’t already in the debate are notified by the bells and have eight minutes to reach the voting lobbies to cast their vote. If they don’t make it in time, then they just get a nice view of the lobbies’ locked doors.\n\nMany of these extraneous pub bells are now defunct or in various states of disrepair. To be fair, it was a system installed about 150 years ago, before the convenience of smart phones. Now, as with everything, there’s apparently an app for that, which most MPs rely on to tell them it’s time to down their drinks and rush to exercise their democratic responsibility…\n\nIf you’re interested in finding some of these old Division Bells, there’s an excellent map by Adam Dant on Spitalfields Life.\n\nThe Palace of Westminster has its own Jewel House\n\nAlthough, I should say, there aren’t actually any jewels still in it…\n\nWhat stands today is a fourteenth-century tower which was once part of the Medieval Palace of Westminster complex.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if many people found it odd that our national government is located in a palace. The name’s a tad misleading. The Palace of Westminster is no longer a royal palace, but it started as one so the name has stuck around.\n\nThere’s been a palace here for a long time too. Since the eleventh-century. By comparison, the current 150 year old structure is practically brand new! So while it’s been the site of a palace for the last 1,000-odd years, that original structure was altered, added to, and rebuilt a lot in that time. The most significant change came in 1834 when a huge fire destroyed most of the palace complex. Only a few sections of the old palace survived, most notably Westminster Hall and the Jewel Tower.\n\nThe Jewel Tower was built between 1365 and 1366 on the orders of King Edward III to store his private collection of jewels, gold and silver. An understandably valuable and enviable collection, the Jewel Tower was complete with its own moat to the south and west to dissuade curious fingers. The moat was even complete with fish! Probably not something appreciated by William Usshebourne, one of Edward III’s keepers of the Privy Palace in the fourteenth-century, who died after choking on the bone of a pike caught in said moat.\n\nFor centuries, it was also used as an archive for the House of Lords and then from 1869 as a testing facility for the Board of Trade Standards Department, often known as Weights and Measures. So basically the building stored the country’s official weights and measures, by which all other weights and measures were judged for accuracy. Yes, it might sound deathly boring, but they maintained the fine line between order and chaos. Not all heroes wear capes.\n\nThe Jewel House is now looked after by English Heritage and open to the general public.\n\nParliament Square was once an island\n\nYes. Once upon a time it was not just the river Thames which flowed through London. There were many other rivers, such as the Fleet, the Westbourne, and the Walbrook, which provided Londoners with transport, trade, a sewage system, and drinking water. I agree, some of those things should definitely be mutually exclusive, but we didn’t always know that drinking sewage water was bad… Anyway, gradually over the years those rivers have been covered up and incorporated into London’s underground sewers. They’re now affectionately referred to as the Lost Rivers of London.\n\nThe general area of Parliament Square was once called Thorney Island. I learnt only recently that the ending ‘-ey’ is actually an Old English suffix for ‘island’, meaning the way we refer to it now basically translates to ‘Thorn Island Island’ – one of those strange linguistic quirks of history, I guess. The island was formed of tributaries of the river Tyburn and it was here, in Westminster, that they flowed into the Thames.\n\nWhen Benedictine monks arrived in the area in 960 AD to build their monastery on the site, it was still an island and a wet, marshy island at that. It was subject to consistent flooding and was generally a pretty unpleasant place. It was this site which would eventually become Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe monks did an excellent job of sprucing the place up. Tenth-century gentrification, if you will, because already by the following century, the area was being described as a “delightful place, surrounded by fertile land and green fields”. It’s not clear when the island ceased to be. We have the lack of maps and written records to thank for that. Probably the only lasting reminder of this once soggy island is Thorney Street which you can find near Lambeth Bridge. Next time you’re in the area, however, and see the cars and buses racing down the roads, imagine flowing water there instead – it’s a bit surreal!\n\nFancy a joust in Parliament Square, anyone?\n\nAlthough this was behaviour more acceptable in the sixteenth-century than the twenty-first… Try showing up in Parliament Square today with armour, a horse, and a huge stick and you’ll probably get arrested.\n\nBut! Let’s go back in time to when Parliament Square played host to one of the most extravagant tournaments Europe had ever seen. The year was 1511 and the King was Henry VIII. He was celebrating the birth of his son to his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Sadly, however, little prince Henry only survived a few weeks, but at the time of the tournament on 12th and 13th February 1511, this was still a joyous, celebratory time.\n\nThe tournament was held in the rough location of Parliament Square today. It was to be two days of jousting and pageantry, feasting and dancing. In the sixteenth-century, these jousting events, or tourneys, as they were called, had an almost fairytale, chivalric quality to them. The tourney was announced in the form of a fictional challenge: the kingdom of Coeur Noble, “Noble Heart”, jousting for the honour of the Queen! Coeur Noble provided four of its best knights, including Henry VIII as Coeur Loyal (“Loyal Heart” – ironic, seeing as he was to have five more wives after Catherine).\n\nBefore the tourney, a procession made its way into the square and the statement piece was undoubtedly a huge castle made of gold paper, wheeled in by a golden lion and a silver antelope. On their backs, ladies in gowns of russet and blue damask. Encasing the castle was an entire artificial forest, 8m long and 5m wide, made of hawthorn, oak, hazel, maple, birch, fern, broom, and fir. Atop the ramparts of the castle were the four knights of Coeur Noble! It would have been a magnificent site.\n\nThis castle would have been accompanied by all manner of attendants, musicians and trumpeters, and we’re lucky to have a visual record of this event in the form of the Westminster Tournament Roll, a 18m roll of parchment, picturing different parts of the tournament. One of the trumpeters was John Blanke, and his inclusion in the Westminster Roll makes him the only identifiable Black person in sixteenth-century English art.\n\nSo there you have it – some hidden history of Parliament Square!
