        "text": "In January English Heritage had to suspend its Blue Plaque scheme because of cuts to its funding. Now, thanks to new sponsorship, the scheme will relaunch next year in association with the Evening Standard. So it’s time to vote for your favourite Londoner\n\n5 August 2013\n\nDo we begin in the late 19th century?” asks Simon Thurley, CEO of English Heritage, when we meet in his Holborn office. As the custodian of Britain’s ancient monuments and historic properties, Thurley may be rooted in the past but his vision of crowdsourcing and savvy sponsorship deals is very much 21st century.\n\nIn January this year English Heritage had to suspend its much-loved Blue Plaque scheme owing to a 34 per cent cut in government funding. Now, thanks to new sponsorship, the scheme will relaunch next year in association with the Evening Standard.\n\nThurley explains that the alarmist headlines had a galvanising effect on the public. Property developer David Pearl came forward and pledged £80,000 to the scheme, becoming its first founder supporter. His money will fund 20 plaques and has secured the future of the project. The public is also being urged to donate via the English Heritage website (english-heritage.org.uk/donate) and from next year Evening Standard readers will be able to choose a candidate to be honoured with a plaque. The Blue Plaques have become the people’s plaques.\n\n“After the cuts we thought we would have to reduce the scheme a little but we were never going to stop it,” says Thurley. “It’s one of best things we do. When it was made public that we’d got into slight financial difficulties, Mr Pearl, who really is a pearl among men, came out of the blue and said ‘I love the history of London; I love the Blue Plaque scheme. Please let me help’.”\n\nAn annual Blue Plaque dinner is now planned and more members of the Blue Plaque selection panel will be recruited in the coming months. Current members, who include former rector of the Royal College of Art Sir Christopher Frayling, writer Bonnie Greer, Barbican Centre managing director Sir Nicholas Kenyon and architectural historian Gavin Stamp, meet twice a year to decide who is worthy of commemoration.\n\nCurrently there are 882 blue plaques in London, with the first erected in honour of Lord Byron in 1867 in Cavendish Square. Other posthumous recipients include Sigmund Freud, Jimi Hendrix and Sylvia Plath. The scheme was originally mooted by MP William Ewart, who asked in the Commons whether “it may be practicable to inscribe on those houses in London which have been inhabited by celebrated persons, the names of such persons”.\n\n“Some parts of London are a bit under-presented,” Thurley concedes. “There is a huge density of plaques in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. But the East End has fewer. There are more in north London than south London.”\n\nSo will there be positive discrimination in favour of the south? “That will be up to the committee to decide,” he replies, silkily. Of the 882, only 117 are women.\n\nThe scheme got into difficulty when the panel agreed to put up more plaques than could be afforded. Pearl’s donation will clear the backlog of more than 20 plaques that have already been agreed.\n\nRead More\n\nShells from Captain Cook’s third voyage ‘lost for 40 years’ are saved from skip\n\nHow to keep your dogs and cats warm this week\n\nWhat is Lyme disease?

In our revitalised scheme we will restrict the plaques to nine or 10 a year.”\n\nEach plaque costs around £4,000. This includes the price of the plaque itself plus installation work. “A lot of people say that’s great value. But, of course, there is more to it than that. First, we have to work out whether the person actually lived at the address. It would be catastrophic for us to put up a plaque on the wrong building. It’s quite tricky. If you’re lucky, there’s census information. But quite often there isn’t and you have to go back to the rate books. And the further back you go, the more problematic it becomes.\n\n“Then you have to contact the people in the house who own it now, to ask if they would like a blue plaque on their house — some people don’t want something on their house saying ‘famous sex therapist lived here’ .”\n\nAfter this initial verification process, the panel then adjudicates on whether nominated candidates pass the illustrious person test.\n\n“Then we go away and do detailed research to make sure we’ve got it absolutely right.”\n\nEnglish Heritage employs two in-house historians to oversee this process, but in future it will ask applicants to do more of the legwork. “A lot of people who write in do masses of research anyway, so we just end up duplicating it all,” says Thurley. “We do think we can run this scheme more cheaply with outside help.”\n\nThe Government announced in June that part of English Heritage is to be split off into an independent charity, and the Blue Plaque scheme will be run under its charitable wing. That means English Heritage will be more reliant in future on philanthropy and its commercial activities.\n\nThurley, 50, who is married with four-year-old twins, has been in charge of English Heritage for 11 years (“a mere drop in the ocean compared with Nick Serota at the Tate,” he jokes) and was a former director of the Museum of London. “Everyone who loves this city loves its quirkiness,” he says. “They love the fact that you can see the Gherkin sticking up from behind a medieval church. Getting Londoners to be excited about their history, excited about other Londoners and where other Londoners lived, is what this scheme is about. To encourage people as they walk along the street just to lift their eyes from the pavement, if they dare...”\n\nNew plaques coming to a building near you\n\nKenneth Williams, Marylebone\n\nThe actor spent six-and-a-half years from 1963 at the flat in Marylebone where his plaque will be placed.
