        "text": "In Richmond they range from novelists, poets and playwrights such as Henry Fielding, Walter de la Mare and Noel Coward and politicians such as Henry Labouchere to reformers like Sir Edwin Chadwick and engineers like James Greathead.\n\nAnd while some of the buildings they lived, worked and died in are very grand, others are more ordinary.\n\nFormer Twickenham Museum treasurer and trustee Trevor Sutton, of Gothic Road, Twickenham, said: \"It's not surprising that there are a number of blue plaques in the borough because there were a lot of distinguished and creative people living here.\"\n\nTwickenham has several blue plaques including those from English Heritage as well as other organisations. Mr Sutton said there was a plaque, an unofficial one, to poet Alfred Lord Tennyson in Montpelier Row, Twickenham. This can be seen on the house where Pete Townsend lived before he moved to The Wick on Richmond Hill. The English Heritage plaque for Tennyson can be seen in Westminster.\n\nAnd poet Walter De La Mare also lived in Montpelier Row. His plaque can be seen on the outside wall of South End House where he lived from 1940 to 1956.\n\nSt James Independent School for Boys boasts a blue plaque commemorating radical MP and journalist Henry Labouchere who lived there from 1881 to 1903. As an MP, Labouchere supported Gladstone over Home Rule for Ireland.\n\nBefore he married actress Henrietta Hodson in 1877 the couple acquired the rebuilt Pope's Villa in Cross Deep, Twickenham.\n\nBut Twickenham's most famous blue plaque must be that commemorating perhaps the most famous English Romantic landscape painter, JMW Turner, RA.\n\nSandycombe Lodge in Sandycoombe Road is where John Turner lived from 1812, when the villa was completed, until he sold it in 1826.\n\nProfessor Harold Livermore, 91, bought the house in 1948 and groups can visit the former home of Turner by appointment. He said Turner painted most of his English work in Sandycombe Lodge but although he designed the house it was his only example of architecture.\n\nProfessor Livermore said Turner probably sold Sandycombe Lodge because he couldn't sell his paintings from the house. \"The aristocracy didn't come to Twickenham to buy pictures,\" he said.\n\nIn his memoir in his late wife's book Scenes from Spanish Life c1930, Professor Livermore quotes Michael Kitson in an obituary in the Turner Society News. \"He recalled visiting Turner's delightful small country villa near the Thames' in the 1970s and thought it a civilized and friendly house, as suitable for modern occupiers as it must have been for Turner'.\"\n\nProfessor Livermore also said Turner's father William had developed arthritis and could no longer look after the garden and so Turner moved to London.\n\nHe said Turner liked Richmond and enjoyed painting the River Thames which was partly why he moved to Twickenham.\n\nIt is through the professor's generosity that he is making a bequest of his house to the nation as a monument to Turner and this came about through the setting up of the Sandycombe Lodge Trust. Its patrons are the Royal Academy and Jesus College in Cambridge, which Professor Livermore attended.\n\n\"I have enjoyed Turner's hospitality for a long period,\" said Professor Livermore.\n\n\"He chose to live in Twickenham and is Twickenham's most distinguished resident,\" he added.\n\nHe said he bought the house because he needed somewhere to live. And apart from changing Turner's dark wallpaper, Professor Livermore said the house had changed little since Turner's day.\n\n\"Turner built his own memorial here,\" he said. \"It is up to the inhabitants of Twickenham to respect and preserve it.\"\n\nAnother blue plaque in Richmond borough is linked to Turner.\n\nThe Royal Hospital in Kew Foot Road in Richmond has a plaque dedicated to James Thomson, poet and author of Rule Britannia who lived and died there.\n\nProfessor Livermore said in his memoir: \"Ann's knowledge of James Thomson (himself a resident of Richmond) and his Seasons allowed her to perceive that Turner was profoundly influenced by Thomson, not only as a poet but also in his choice of subjects for his paintings.\"\n\nRichmond's most well-known plaque is probably the one in Paradise Road which commemorates Leonard and Virginia Woolf who founded Hogarth Press there in 1917. They lived in Hogarth House from 1915 to 1924.\n\nJulia Briggs in her book Virginia Woolf An Inner Life, said on Virginia's 33rd birthday the Woolfs made a decision to take the lease of Hogarth House. She said Virginia Woolf described it in her one of diaries as \"a perfect house, if ever there was one.\"\n\nBy June 1923, however, Virginia Woolf was writing in one of her diaries: \"we must leave Richmond and set up in London\".\n\nAnother Richmond blue plaque can be found in Montague Road where Sir Edwin Chadwick, a physician and social reformer who devoted his life to sanitary reform in Britain, lived from 1854 to 1869.\n\nAs commissioner of the Board of Health, he conducted a campaign that resulted in the passage of the Public Health Act of 1848.\n\nAt Clarence House in The Vineyard in Richmond is a plaque to Bernardo O'Higgins, general, statesman and liberator of Chile.\n\nO'Higgins was the illegitimate son of Isabel Riquelme, the young daughter of an aristocratic, Chilean family and an Irish engineer named Ambrose O'Higgins, who was in the service of the Spanish crown.\n\nThe present owner of Clarence House is Robert Barnfather who had already been living in the house for four years when the plaque was unveiled 12 years ago.\n\nHe said: \"This was a school during the period of time he lived in Richmond and according to some evidence found by English Heritage he came to school here.\"\n\nMr Barnfather said the main visitors to the plaque were Chileans who came to the house to take photographs.\n\nIn Teddington, actor, playwright and songwriter Sir Noel Coward lived in Waldegrave Road and a blue plaque was unveiled in 1995. But it was an occasion missed by homeowner Maureen Digby as she was at work on that day.\n\nMrs Digby, 75, had been living at the house for 15 years before the plaque was unveiled and she said: \"It was interesting to know that someone famous had lived here.\"\n\nShe said people came to the house to take photos and children from schools also visited the playwright's former house.\n\nMeanwhile, in Barnes three blue plaques can be seen. One, in Westmoreland Road, commemorates artist Kurt Schwitters who is acknowledged as the 20th century's greatest master of collage.\n\nAlso in Barnes is a plaque dedicated to English novelist Henry Fielding whose works included Tom Jones (1749) and Amelia (1751). He lived in Milbourne House in Barnes Green. The third plaque to be found in Barnes is one commemorating James Greathead, a railway and tunnelling engineer, who lived in St Mary's Grove from 1885 to 1889.\n\nHampton boasts a blue plaque commemorating actor and theatrical manager David Garrick who lived in Garrick's Villa in Hampton Court Road which he moved to in 1754 to escape the pressures of London theatrical life.\n\nA blue plaque also celebrates singer, actor and manager John Beard who lived at the property called Rose Hill, (now Hampton library) and died there in 1791.\n\nArchitect Sir Christopher Wren left a permanent mark on Hampton, in rebuilding parts of Hampton Court Palace during the reign of William and Mary. Between 1706 and 1723 he lived intermittently at the Old Court House on Hampton Court Green.\n\nRichmond Council and the Hampton Society sponsored the placing of another blue plaque in Hampton commemorating the father of computer science Alan Turing at Ivy House in High Street, where he lived from 1945 to 1947. There is also a blue plaque on the Colonnade Hotel in Maida Vale, west London where Turing was born. English Heritage says there can only be one of their blue plaques per person.\n\nKew has a plaque dedicated to pre-Raphaelite painter Arthur Hughes who lived and died at Eastside House in Kew Green while John Newman, later Cardinal Newman, has a plaque commemorating his time at Grey Court in Ham Street, Ham where he spent some of his early years from 1804 to 1807. The house was rented by his father and Newman idolised the location as a schoolboy.\n\nToday there are around 800 plaques to be found in London and the blue plaques scheme continues to grow at the rate of about 20 plaques per year.\n\nEnglish Heritage receives around 100 suggestions for blue plaques each year, all of which come from members of the public. Each nominated person has to meet basic selection criteria before they can be considered. Most importantly, they must have been dead for 20 years or have passed the centenary of their birth, whichever is the earlier.\n\nEnglish Heritage's Blue Plaques Panel - representatives of various disciplines from across the country - considers all the suggestions which meet the basic criteria and, on average, around one in three proposals are accepted.\n\nAnd Mr Sutton has a suggestion to add to the 100 made each year. He said he believed Eric Fraser, the illustrator, who was responsible for devising Mr Therm for British Gas, the cover for Lord of the Rings and the front covers of the Radio Times for about 20 years, should be commemorated. He lived almost opposite Turing and his works can be found in the Victoria and Albert museum. \"I think he should have a blue plaque,\" said Mr Sutton.\n\nEnglish Heritage's website says it takes from two to five years before a plaque is placed on a building. So, if you're plaque-hunting in the borough in a few years time, you may find the number totals 16, to include eminent illustrator Eric Fraser.\n\nSee www.blueplaque.com for more."
