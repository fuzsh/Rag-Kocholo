I will therefore seek to address your points\n\nmyself, which I trust will be acceptable to you.\n\nYou asked for a list of all the blue plaques we manage, including all the\n\ninformation printed on the plaque, and the date the plaque was put up. You\n\npointed out that there is already such a list on the English Heritage\n\nwebsite. I can confirm that this list includes all the blue plaques we\n\nmanage and is up-to-date (the latest plaque, to Sir Ralph Richardson,\n\nbeing included). It features the exact inscriptions on the plaques and the\n\ndates the plaques were erected.\n\nThe list does not include plaques erected under our national pilot\n\nschemes. Lists of these plaques are readily available by contacting the\n\nBlue Plaques Team, but I have attached them here for your convenience. I'm\n\nafraid that we are unable to provide this information in a more `easily\n\nparseable format'; the only versions we have are in MS Word.\n\nYou have also requested information on the blue plaques scheme. Thorough\n\nand up-to-date information on this is provided on our website, which I\n\nbelieve you have already visited. The answers to your specific questions\n\nregarding our pilot schemes are as follows:\n\n1. Were the pilot schemes expanded?\n\nThe pilot schemes ran between 1998 and 2005, and (as you will see from the\n\nlists) involved the installation of plaques in Liverpool & Merseyside,\n\nPortsmouth, Southampton and Birmingham. For a number of reasons, the\n\noperation of such schemes at a national level was found to be unworkable,\n\nand we now only erect plaques in London, providing advice and guidance to\n\nschemes active elsewhere.\n\n2. Are there other organisations that operate similar schemes in other\n\ncities, or in Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland?\n\nWe know that there are hundreds of plaques schemes operating across\n\nEngland and the UK. These are administered variously by local councils,\n\ncivic societies, other amenity and local interest groups, as well as by\n\nspecialist organisations. We are unable to say how many schemes are in\n\noperation, nor are we in possession of information on all schemes. You may\n\nbe interested to know, however, that there are notable schemes in\n\nManchester, Oxford, Liverpool, and Bath. In London alone several plaques\n\nschemes exist alongside our own, including the Westminster City Council\n\nGreen Plaques scheme, the Comic Heritage scheme, the Southwark Council\n\nBrown Plaques scheme, the Heath and Hampstead Society scheme, and the\n\nCorporation of the City of London's memorial tablets scheme. In addition,\n\nmany plaques are erected as `one-offs' by private (and often anonymous)\n\nindividuals, in London and across the UK.\n\nFinally, you requested a list of locations rejected for blue plaques. Blue\n\nplaque proposals are generally received in connection with a particular\n\nindividual. At the proposal stage we ask for information regarding a\n\nsingle surviving London address at which the individual lived or worked,\n\nso that we can be sure that it will be possible to proceed with the\n\nproposal should it prove successful (you will have noted that one of the\n\nselection criteria of our scheme is that a surviving London building\n\nassociated with the individual must remain intact). The actual location of\n\nthe plaque is decided at a later stage, and so there are no `rejected\n\nlocations' as such. There are only rejected individuals, and these number\n\nin the thousands.\n\nI was very interested to hear of your plans to compile a map of all the\n\nblue plaques erected in the UK, and would be pleased to discuss this idea\n\nwith you. My direct line is 020 7973 3794.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nRegards,\n\nLibby Wardle\n\nLibby Wardle | Blue Plaques Team\n\nEnglish Heritage | 1 Waterhouse Square | 138-142 Holborn |\n\nLondon | EC1N 2ST\n\nP Please do not print this email unless you really have to.\n\nE-mail Message\n\nshow quoted sections"
