        "text": "Commemorative plaques on the facades of Britain’s buildings are an unlikely source of joy. Especially during the pandemic, when urban inhabitants have been more than usually reliant on foot power to get them around, a flash of ceramic sky blue – the colour favoured by English Heritage, which runs the most authoritative and well-known plaque scheme on the streets of London – can mean a momentary invitation to consider distant lives. Passing her house in Holland Park, for instance, one can imagine Radclyffe Hall weathering the scandal of the publication of The Well of Loneliness, her (suppressed) lesbian novel. Gay film-maker and activist Derek Jarman is commemorated by a plaque erected by Islington council to mark his home in the late 1960s. He has his English Heritage blue plaque, though, in Shad Thames, Southwark, London, where he lived and worked in the 1970s – and, incidentally, won the first Alternative Miss World competition, judged by a panel that included David Hockney.\n\nOr take Ira Aldridge, the African American actor who settled in the south London suburb of Upper Norwood, we learn from his blue plaque, in the 1860s. What would he have had to say to the great composer, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who later lived not far away in South Norwood? The composer of The Song of Hiawatha was the first black person to be given a plaque under the English Heritage scheme, in 1975.\n\nCommemorating history is now, more than ever, a contentious issue. A recent analysis by the Guardian’s data team found that only 2% of the blue plaques in English Heritage’s scheme commemorate black people. That rather pitiful figure, though, may somewhat obscure the fact that the charity, which took over the then 120-year-old project in 1986 after the abolition of the Greater London Council, has made important strides towards changing the balance. A working party, set up in 2016, has been specifically encouraging nominations for plaques commemorating black and Asian historical figures, as well as women and those from working-class backgrounds. The result is that for the past two years a quarter of the plaques unveiled have commemorated notable black and Asian people. The age of an exclusive focus on dead white men is over."
