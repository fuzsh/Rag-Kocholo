        "text": "Irish political giant Daniel O'Connell has been remembered as the Nelson Mandela of his day, as the newest of London's blue plaques was unveiled in his honour.\n\nThe commemoration to O'Connell stands in Albemarle Street.\n\nThe Kerry man was known as The Liberator for his battle for the right of Catholics to sit in the British Parliament.\n\nThe plaque marks his former home in the capital's Mayfair district.\n\nAmong those already honoured by the blue plates in London are John Lennon, Florence Nightingale, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nOutside the house, Prof Martin Daunton of English Heritage, which issues the honours, said O'Connell was arguably the Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi of his age.\n\n\"His campaign for Catholic emancipation and his principled opposition to slavery was - and still is - admired around the world,\" he said.\n\n\"We are delighted to honour this towering figure in the city which formed the backdrop for much of his career.\"\n\nO'Connell lived at 14 Albemarle Street from February 1833 for up to six months, during a significant time for the groundbreaking 19th century politician.\n\nDuring that year's general election, 39 of his supporters in the campaign against the Act of Union were elected to the House of Commons.\n\nThe plaque was unveiled at the house after O'Connell's descendants proposed the idea to a panel of judges at English Heritage."
