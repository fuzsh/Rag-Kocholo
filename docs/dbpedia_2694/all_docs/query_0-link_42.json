        "text": "Despite creating two of our best-known and much-loved Englishmen, Bertie Wooster and his butler Jeeves, P. G. Wodehouse Wodehouse did not spend a day in Britain after he left the country in 1939. It has now been announced, however, that this quintessentially English writer is to be honoured with a memorial plaque in Westminster Abbey. Blue Badge Tourist Guides often take their guests through the Abbey which is used for the coronation and major royal weddings.\n\nWhy has it taken so long for P. G. Wodehouse to be honoured at our national church when he was one of the twentieth century’s most famous and best-loved writers? The answer lies in a series of ill-advised radio broadcasts he made after he and his wife had been interned by the Nazis from their home in Le Touquet in France in 1940. Wodehouse had been offered the chance to fly back to the United Kingdom but, as this would have meant leaving his wife Ethel and their dog behind in France, he declined. The couple later tried to drive to neutral Portugal but their car broke down so they were imprisoned by the Nazis and Wodehouse was sent to Berlin where he naively agreed to make a series of broadcasts to the United States which were called How to Be an Internee without Previous Training. Wodehouse was trying to be light-hearted and to show that the British could maintain their stiff upper lip in the face of adversity while gently mocking his captors. The broadcasts turned out to be more Wooster than Jeeves, however, and he was widely reviled in Britain for them, some even saying that he should be tried for treason. As a result, Wodehouse returned to the United States, where he had previously lived for several years, and never returned to Britain before he died in 1975.\n\nHe had been born in Surrey in 1881 and was christened Pelham Grenville Wodehouse. Not caring for these names, like many Englishmen of the time, he was known by a nickname, in his case ‘Plum’. His parents lived in Hong Kong and – again this was normal for the time – Wodehouse was brought up apart from them in boarding schools and by a series of aunts and uncles, many of whom were to reappear thinly disguised in his books later in his life.\n\nP. G. Wodehouse attended Dulwich College in South London, which he loved, and was set to go to Oxford University but a downturn in the family finances led to him being sent to work in a bank, which he hated. (It is interesting how many great literary careers grew out of financial misfortunes besetting the writer’s family – Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, George Eliot.) The young Wodehouse was impatient to leave the bank at the end of the day to return to his writing. He gradually gained success in publishing stories in magazines and had his first book published in 1902 when he resigned from the bank to become a full-time author."
