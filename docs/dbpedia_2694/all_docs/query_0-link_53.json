        "text": "Summary\n\nThe Chapter House and Pyx Chamber in the eastern cloister range of Westminster Abbey, south of Parliament Square, Westminster.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nThe Chapter House and Pyx Chamber formed part of the Benedictine Abbey of Westminster. A Chapter House was a building where the dean, prebendaries or monks and cannons met for the transaction of business. Westminster Abbey Chapter House is unusual in that it came into frequent use by the State. The Pyx Chamber was part of the undercroft of the monks’ dormitory before it was converted into a strong-room.\n\nFrom the time of St Augustine's mission to re-establish Christianity in AD 597 to the reign of Henry VIII, monasticism formed an important facet of both religious and secular life in the British Isles. Settlements of religious communities were built to house communities of monks, canons (priests), and sometimes lay-brothers, living a common life of religious observance under some form of systematic discipline. It is estimated from documentary evidence that over 700 religious houses were founded in England. These ranged in size from major communities with several hundred members to tiny establishments with a handful of brethren. They belonged to a wide variety of different religious orders and varied considerably in the detail of their appearance and layout. However all possessed the basic elements of church, domestic accommodation for the community, and work buildings. Monasteries were inextricably woven into the fabric of medieval society, acting not only as centres of worship, learning and charity, but also, because of the vast landholdings of some orders, as centres of immense wealth and political influence. Benedictine monasticism had its roots in the rule written about AD 530 by St Benedict of Nursia for his own abbey at Monte Cassino. Benedict had not intended to establish an order of monasteries and wider adoption of his rule came only gradually, although over 150 Benedictine religious houses were eventually founded in England.\n\nThe Chapter House and Pyx Chamber are an integral part of Westminster Abbey, a building of outstanding architectural and historic significance. The Chapter House, constructed by Henry III, has been recognised as the greatest single act of royal patronage in English medieval history and one of the finest pieces of 13th century architecture with one of the finest medieval tile pavements in England. One of the largest English chapter houses, it served as formal meeting place for the monks of Westminster Abbey but additionally was the assembly place for Henry III’s Great Court; the first secular assembly is recorded as having taken place in March 1257, representing the predecessor of English Parliament. The walls are decorated by late 14th and 15th century paintings which are unique and are a most important and remarkable survival.\n\nDespite later alterations, the Chapter House, together with the Outer and Inner Vestibules, retains a high proportion of original masonry fabric. It was carefully restored, largely faithfully to the 13th century design, by Sir George Gilbert Scott, one of the best-known and most prolific Victorian architects. The Pyx Chamber, as part of the 11th century undercroft of the monk’s dormitory, contains some of the oldest surviving fabric in Westminster Abbey. The site will also contain archaeological remains relating to the medieval construction, use and history of the Abbey.\n\nHistory\n\nSee Details.\n\nDetails"
