        "text": "\"I particular like this plaque because if you look at the satellite view you'll see that the area is laid out in the shape of a plane.\"\n\n\"I like this one because it has an unusual role on it. When I do a presentation about openplaques there is a slide showing lots of roles, and people always notice 'only twin'.\"\n\n\"This plaque is going to be fairly hard to get a photo of as it is on the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Maybe the visitors centre allows you to get close enough?\"\n\n\"There is a great back story about William \"Mole Man\" Lyttle who lived as a recluse, digging tunnels under his house in Hackney. Independent ad agency Karmarama felt honour-bound to put a plaque up to tell the world.\"\n\n\"This has to be one of _the_ best inscriptions ever. It is also quite a difficult plaque to get a photo of.\"\n\n\"This plaque has so far eluded me photographing it because it is inside the Brighton Centre. With it, I would nearly have the set of Brighton and Hove.\"\n\n\"The Pandora Gallery plaque is one that I must have walked past a hundred times and never seen. It is on Brighton seafront and has been battered by the sea winds until you can hardly see the writing. \"\n\n\"This George Orwell plaque always causes a stir as a picture shows a CCTV camera in front of it. Click on the photo to the left to see the true image\"\n\n\"Made by Leander Architecture, this plaque is the first to include a QR code which when scanned by a mobile phone will take you to a Norman Wisdom web\"\n\n\"It's not often a plaque contains an epigram from the person it commemorates, but this one does exactly that and tells us he partied at least once with a bohemian set, including George Gershwin, Dorothy Parker and Harpo Marx. Founder and first editor of the New Yorker, Harold Ross was - like most journalists - fond of name-dropping, so his plaque is quite in keeping with that tradition.\"\n\n\"Although we don't usually accept gravestones, we can sometimes turn a blind eye to the unusual ones. Pet gravestones are more likely to be where the animal lived rather than a graveyard.\"\n\n\"Born in 1895 Anna followed in her father Sigmund Freud's footsteps, adding to the newly born field of psychoanalysis. Alongside Melanie Klein, she is considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology. The house this plaque is on is now a museum featuring among its objects Freud's famous couch. http://www.freud.org.uk/\"\n\n\"On 1st December 1919, Nancy Astor became the first woman MP to take her seat in the House of Commons, Westminster. She was led into the House by Arthur Balfour and Lloyd-George, both of whom had said that they would rather have a rattlesnake in the House than her. But the first woman ever elected to Parliament was Constance Markievicz in December 1918, who didn't take up her seat (for Dublin, St Patrick's constituency) and was also in Holloway Prison at the time for her anti-conscription activities.\"\n\n\"A record of a foul deed! The Earl of Rochester must have had it in for Dryden. I wonder what he had done?!\"\n\n\"Really so sad that Rik Mayall died so suddenly. Great to see this spoof plaque go up so quickly. Now all we need is someone in Hammersmith to get us the photo!\"\n\n\"Not all plaques are for world famous people, but if someone has gone to the effort and cost of erecting a plaque then that is good enough for us. I hope that i'm not maligning 'Spider' by imagining that his 'hours of leisure' were mostly of the tramp-like variety.\"\n\n\"The Duke of Buckingham was hugely unpopular having been defeated in battle by the French. Attempts to officially try hi for incompetence had failed. So, John Fenton, a lieutenant in the English army, took matters into his own hands.\"\n\n\"It's great when plaques turn up off the beaten path in London, like this one in Bromley, South East London for Peter Kropotkin, born in 1842. Kropotkin was a Russian zoologist, evolutionary theorist, philosopher, economist, geographer, author and one of the world's foremost anarcho-communists. He moved to Bromley after being expelled from Switzerland and narrowly escaping prison in France. \"\n\n\"This is the plaque that started Open Plaques. I was reading an article about walking across the Uk latitude 50 and how he couldn't find this one in Hove...it piqued my interest, and now look where we are!\"\n\n\"This is terribly sad when you look into the story. Arthur Sullivan received a Victoria Cross for extreme gallantry in rescuing four members of his platoon in Russia in 1919. In 1937 he was attending the coronation of King George VI when he slipped and hit his head on the kerb. The blow was fatal.\"\n\n\"This was my first photo to be shown on Open Plaques. Am chuffed to help a great resource. It's just around the corner from my work in Southwark and is an incredibly tranquil spot devised by the great Victorian reformer Octavia Hill as an open space for the urban working class. It is as valued now by the local community as I'm sure it was then.\"\n\n\"This plaque was a real surprise find. Driving through the outskirts of the small, sleepy village of Chiddingly, this plaque, positioned high on a beautiful old cottage, caught my eye. Village plaques are rare, and octagonal ones even rarer.\"\n\n\"Before Twitter and text messaging there were telegrams! The first wireless transatlantic one was sent from this spot in Cape Cod to England on 18th Jan 1903, addressed to Edward VII King of England from Theodore Roosevelt President of the United States of America. Wireless traffic between the two countries is somewhat busier these days.\"\n\n\"The plaque to Ziggy was originally proposed to English Heritage as he has been 'dead' for over 20 years. This is the spot where the iconic cover shot was taken. Unveiled by Gary Kemp\"\n\n\"This plaque has an interesting design, undertaken by Danny Osborne, well known for his internationally acclaimed sculpture of Oscar Wilde in Merrion Square in Dublin. The spiral symbol on the plaques was selected for its universal and elegant form in science and engineering.\""
