        "text": "Agnes Arber (1879 – 1960) was a plant morphologist and became the third woman (and first female botanist) to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Arber was also awarded the Linnean Society gold medal. Due to the University of Cambridge administration at the time, Arber spent a large proportion of her career working in a small laboratory in her own house at 52 Huntingdon Road rather than having a formal position and space in the University.\n\nBorn Agnes Robertson, 23 February 1879, she was the first child of Agnes Turner and Henry Robertson. Aged eight, she attended the North London Collegiate School for Girls, which provided girls with a serious education, rather than a 'finishing' in social graces, and had a strong commitment to teaching science. Ethel Sargant, a plant morphologist from Girton College, Cambridge, came to read papers at the school’s science club; Agnes Robertson went on to work in Sargant's laboratory, in the garden of her home in Reigate, during vacations.\n\nShe studied for a degree at University College London (UCL), and went on to take a further degree at the University of Cambridge, in Newnham College. At this time, in 1899, women were not members of the University, admitted to practical classes in laboratories, or awarded degrees.\n\nIn 1902 Agnes returned to Ethel Sargant's laboratory in Reigate, and in 1903 published her first paper in the Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 'Notes on the anatomy of Macrozamia heteromera'. She returned to UCL as a research student carrying out research on gymnosperms, and in 1905 she was awarded a DSc. Shortly after being appointed lecturer in August 1909 Agnes left UCL and married Edward Newell Arber, moving to Cambridge.\n\nIn 1912 Agnes Arber was appointed to a one-year research fellowship at Newnham College, and published her first book: Herbals, a survey of the beautiful books that were the centre of botanical studies for several centuries, important for naming and classifying plants for medicinal purposes. In July 1912 the couple's only child, Muriel, was born.\n\nIn 1918 Newell Arber died at the age of 48. Arber did not remarry, but carried on with her research, largely unpaid, as a single parent. Muriel said of her mother, ‘She snatched time from her writing to do the necessary minimum of domestic things, not the other way round.’\n\nBefore Ethel Sargant’s death, she had asked Arber to take over the production of a book for the Cambridge Botanical Handbooks series, and in 1925 she published The Monocotyledons; this group of plants formed a strong strand of Arber's empirical research. This was followed by Water Plants, published by Cambridge University Press in 1920, and The Gramineae in 1934.\n\nFor 17 years Arber worked in the Balfour Laboratory that belonged to Newnham College. It had been established in 1884 with £1000 in donations, because although at the time they were permitted to attend University lectures, laboratory demonstrations and practical classes were generally closed to women. Teaching was provided mainly by female research fellows of Newnham and Girton Colleges, who also undertook their own biological sciences research in the Balfour Laboratory. As women gained access to University resources, the laboratory went into decline; when the space was sold to the University, they were unable to allow Arber to continue her work. Arber was offered the laboratory equipment she had used in the Balfour to use in her home at 52 Huntingdon Road, Cambridge, and thanked the Principal for the 'opportunity of quiet and independent research this afforded [her]'. Her experience of working in Ethel Sargant's garden laboratory likely opened her up to the possibilities.\n\n(Photo copyright the National Portrait Gallery)\n\nIn 1950 she published The Natural Philosophy of Plant Form, which linked her practical experience with a discussion of her ideas about the philosophy of plant morphology. The following book, The Mind and the Eye, received a favourable review in Nature: 'Mrs Arber's book stands out as a work of genuine scholarship and special timeliness. It ought to be prescribed reading for every fresh graduate who proposes to begin research'.\n\nThe obituary of Arber in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London said ‘To many she was the 'lady of botany' and young biologists should think of an acute and powerful observer wrapt in penetrating and ever more powerful philosophy, who grasped the world without travel, and how they attract into the circle of discussion such another if they are fortunate.’\n\nAgnes Arber died 22 March 1960 in Cambridge.\n\n(Photo L:R Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith (Cambridge University), Penny Heath (CambridgePPF), Lucy Pollard (Agnes great niece) and Cllr Baiju Thittala Varkey (Mayor of Cambridge) by Chris Loades copyright Cambridge University)\n\nAgnes' blue plaque was installed at 52 Huntingdon Road in 2024, which was also the 300th anniversary of the appointment of the first Professor of Botany at Cambridge, and was marked by a year of celebration for the University Department of Plant Sciences.\n\nAn unveiling event for the plaque took place on 30 May 2024 at Cambridge University Botanic Garden. During this event an Agnes Arber PhD thesis prize for comparative biology was announced, which it is hoped will support the next generation of pioneering botanists, following in the footsteps of Agnes.\n\nSam Brockington a Professor of Evolutionary Biology & Curator at Cambridge University Botanic Garden in May 2024 said, “the University’s rich legacy in botany is marked by notable discoveries across many areas of the Plant Sciences. This year of celebrations is highlighting some of our scientific achievements including the work of Agnes Arber. We are delighted to be supporting a blue plaque to recognize her work.\"\n\nLucy Pollard, Agnes’ great niece in 2024 “'our family are delighted that she is to receive this belated recognition. I remember her as a kind, quiet, unassuming person: I’m ashamed that, as a child, I had no idea that she was also a distinguished scholar”.\n\nThe plaque and unveiling event for Agnes Arber were kindly sponsored by Cambridge University and the family of Agnes Arber. The plaque was kindly installed by D J Everson.\n\nWilbert Vere Awdry (1911 - 1997) was an Anglican clergyman, railway enthusiast and hugely successful children’s author who created the enduringly popular Railway Series of books and characters, including the much-loved Thomas the Tank Engine.\n\nAwdry had just become Rector of the parish of Elsworth in 1946 when the success of his first two books led the publisher, Edmund Ward, to commission Awdry to write a new book for the Railway Series every year. He would do so for the next 24 years, writing five titles at Elsworth before moving on to serve another Cambridgeshire parish, Emneth. When Wilbert Awdry put down his pen in 1972, his son, Christopher - for whom the first stories were written - went on to write 16 more titles.\n\nWhat began as a father’s stories to amuse his three year old son, in bed with measles, became a literary, publishing, merchandising and financial phenomenon. At the time of his death in 1997, Awdry’s Railway Series books had sold in the order of 50 million copies, in a dozen languages, and inspired videos, toys, games, clothes and a popular television film series. Well known narrators of the stories include Johny Morris, Willie Rushton and Ringo Starr.\n\nImage: Rev Awdry with Ringo Starr and crew in 1984 (copyright Mattel Inc)\n\nThe success of the series is attributed to the small landscape format of the books; the striking, colourful illustrations, and the quality of Awdry’s text which captures the rhythm and repetition of rolling stock. For all their simplicity, the stories were based on real incidents: a derailment, the loss of some trucks, even a fish found in an engine’s boiler.\n\nSpeaking on Desert Island Discs in 1964, Awdry explained why railways fascinated him, giving insight into the source of his creativity:\n\n“Of all the mechanical contrivances made by man, the steam engine is the most human. The steam engine is an extrovert….He likes you to know how he’s getting on and how he’s feeling about things…On the move, locomotives, always have something to say.”\n\nWilbert was born on 15th June 1911 in Ampfield, near Romsey in Hampshire, where his father, Vere, was vicar. Wilbert’s name came from combining his father’s favourite brothers names, William and Herbert.\n\nAs a boy, Wilbert was influenced by his father’s love of railways: real and and model. He poured over his father’s copies of The Railway Magazine, and walked by the Baddesley stretch of railway line where plate-layers had their huts. The excitement when an engine or train thundered past left a deep impression.\n\nThe family moved to Wiltshire in 1917, to a house next to the Box Tunnel and the start of the Great Western line incline. Lying in bed, young Wilbert listened to the rhythmic sounds of the engine shunting trains up the incline, later drawing on this memory as inspiration for the story where Edward helps Gordon to get up the hill.\n\nAged 13, Wilbert went to Dauntsey School, and in 1929 was among the first intake of undergraduates at St Peter’s Hall (now St Peter’s College) at Oxford. Graduating with a third class degree in Modern History, Wilbert decided to become a parson, and spent a year at Oxford’s theological college, Wycliffe Hall. From 1933 - 1936, he taught in Jerusalem at St George’s School, fulfilling his Wycliffe tutor’s view that holding down a secular job was key preparation for being ordained.\n\nBack from Jerusalem, and having been ordained, Awdry took up a post as deacon in Odiham, Hampshire. In 1938, he married Margaret Wale, whom he had met in Jerusalem and the following year they moved to West Lavington in Wiltshire where Awdry was appointed curate. War was looming, and there was little peace for Awdry, whose pacifist views were out of line with seniors in the diocese.\n\nTurned out of the parish, he was offered a post by the sympathetic Bishop of Birmingham, Dr Barnes, and Wilbert and Margaret moved to King’s Norton, arriving in time for the Blitz. Their son was born in 1940, and three years later, when Christopher was in bed with measles, Awdry sought to amuse him by telling stories about a row of engines.\n\nThe stories evolved as Wilbert answered Christopher’s questions, giving each engine a name and personality. Christopher wanted to hear the stories about industrious Edward, pompous Gordon and argumentative Henry again and again, and so Awdry wrote them down, along with simple drawings.\n\nMargaret considered them better than most children’s books available during the war and persuaded him to look for a publisher. Awdry’s first three stories, written on scraps of paper, were sent to an agent who eventually found a publisher in Edmund Ward. Keen to redress the dearth of children’s books during the war, Ward accepted the manuscripts.\n\nBy the time the first book, The Three Railway Engines, was published, just days after VE day in May 1945, Awdry was already writing a second, in which he introduced Thomas - the most child-like of all his characters - based on a model tank engine he had made for Christopher at Christmas.\n\nImage: Model of Thomas the Tank Engine (copyright Mattel Inc)\n\nEdmund Ward published Thomas the Tank Engine in 1946, the year Awdry moved to Elsworth, where he would live, work and write for the next six years. By then, Wilbert and Margaret had three children: Christopher and two daughters, Veronica and Hilary. The war years had taken their toll on the upkeep of the Church, the school and the Rectory. Awdry’s first task was to make the Rectory fit for his wife and young family to live in. It was infested and primitive, with no mains water. Besides, the church was leaky.\n\nCosts for repair and maintenance were significant, and Awdry’s attempts to make the Rectory fit for tenants to help share the costs led to tedious tangles with ecclesiastical grant-giving bodies. Besides, stepping into the shoes of the previous incumbent - who had been Rector for 19 years - was not proving easy.\n\nAn unexpected boost from his publishers was timely. Edmund Ward had hired a new editor, Eric Marriott, previously with Cambridge University Press. Marriott saw the appeal of Awdry’s first two books, with their bright illustrations and “small books for small hands” format. He challenged Ward’s plan to just reprint the first titles, insisting that there should be a new book each year. Marriott’s determination paid off, and was key in the success of the Railway Series. Awdry was offered £75 to write the next book. In Brian Sibley’s 1995 biography, The Thomas the Tank Engine Man, he recalls Rev W Awdry’s reaction to this news: “To me, this was marvellous. I couldn’t get over my amazement that a publisher should actually ask me to write a book for him!” In 1948, the year that British Railways were nationalised, James the Red Engine became the third book in the series, followed the next year by Tank Engine Thomas Again.\n\nAlthough Awdry had initially parted with copyright for a flat fee, Edmund Ward offered an ex gratia payment for the fourth book of £200: a godsend for the Awdry family on their shoestring existence at Elsworth.\n\nImage: Rev Awdry (copyright Mattel Inc)\n\nAs well as helping to pay the bills, the money enabled Awdry to invest in a model railway in one of the Rectory outbuildings. He started work, finishing just in time for the Church fete in July 1949. Admission fees went to the fete, but subsequent contributions for viewings raised money for the church in the shape of an altar frontal and an oak box for communion wafers, with an engraved plaque commemorating the support of Thomas the Tank Engine!\n\nAwdry’s knowledge of railways and engines was considerable. From the outset, every story in the Railway Series was based on something that had actually happened to some engine, somewhere, sometime. However, his commitment to railway accuracy and authenticity in the text was not shared by the illustrators commissioned for the books. Notably, C Reginald Dalby, whose gem-like pictures first appeared in James the Red Engine and who helped to set the style for the series, had a disregard for detail which infuriated Awdry.\n\nInaccuracies and inconsistencies in Dalby’s illustrations led to endless correspondence from readers. Dalby’s depiction of landscape was also at odds with Awdry’s own ideas of a sense of place where his stories were set. This led Wilbert, with his brother George, to invent a new setting for the stories: the fictitious Island of Sodor. The brothers made maps and wrote a detailed history of the island, its people and railway engines, which helped shape many of the events described in later volumes.\n\nAwdry's enthusiasm for railways was not limited to his books. He built and exhibited ambitious model railways around the country and was involved in railway preservation societies, such as the TalyLlyn Railway in Wales, which inspired the Skarloey Railway on the Island of Sodor, and featured in Four Little Engines (1955) and The Little Old Engine (1959).\n\nMargaret died in 1989, and Wilbert’s health began to decline. The Reverend was awarded an Order of the British Empire in the 1996 New Year's Honours List. He died peacefully in Stroud, Gloucestershire on 21st March 1997 at the age of 85.\n\nAwdry Blue Plaque\n\nIn December 2020 a blue plaque was installed on the barn of the Old Rectory on Church Lane, Elsworth, next to where Awdry lived and wrote and next to The Holy Trinity Church where he served. The plaque was unveiled by the Revd Nigel di Castiglione, the current Rector. Elsworth Village Primary School took part in the celebration and pupils produced hand-drawn pictures which were displayed in the church. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic Awdry's daughter Veronica was unable to attend but a letter from her was read out at the event in which she said \"I am delighted and moved at the news that a Blue Plaque has been put up in tribute to my father, the man who wrote the stories about Thomas and engines with personalities, but who was also, most importantly, a very dedicated and hardworking Rector.\"\n\nWe are very grateful to global toy company Mattel for sponsoring this plaque (Mattel are the owners of Thomas the Tank Engine brand) and to the owners of the barn for allowing the plaque to be installed on their property. We are also very grateful to the teachers and pupils of Elsworth Primary School for their artwork and all those people who's efforts made this plaque happen.\n\nThe Cambridge & District Blue Plaques Scheme is run by local charity Cambridge Past Present & Future. However sometimes blue plaques are put up by other organisations that are not part of this official scheme. You can easily tell because the blue plaque won't have the crest of either the City Council or South Cambridge District Council. Whilst we are not responsible for these plaques we felt it might be helpful for people to be aware of them. The blue plaque for Syd Barrett is one of these and was put up by the BBC as part of a national initiative.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, a Blue Plaque for Syd Barrett was unveiled at Anglia Ruskin University on their original arts building by his sister, Rosemary Breen, who said that Syd would “have loved it.” The plaque is located inside the university but can be visited when the University is open. Click here for information about the plaque unveiling.\n\nRoger Keith “Syd” Barrett, was born on 6 January 1946 in Cambridge, the fourth of five children. His parents Max and Winifred Barrett actively encouraged his music and art interests from an early age. He picked up the nickname ‘Syd’ during his attendance at the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys on Hills Road, which was the name he used until the 1970s, before reverting back to his original Roger.\n\nSyd was co-founder of the rock band Pink Floyd along with Roger Waters, who he knew from his Cambridge primary school, and David Gilmour, a fellow former Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology student he had met as a teenager. During his time at the college (now part of the Cambridge School of Art and Anglia Ruskin University) Syd had become known on the local music scene, and following his move to London to attend the Camberwell Art College, Pink Floyd was formed in 1965. The band was one of the first British psychedelic groups, achieving worldwide acclaim and distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows, with Syd as their creative innovator.\n\nPink Floyd’s debut album ‘The Piper at the Gates of Dawn’ was released in August 1967. Mostly composed by Syd, it is counted as one of the greatest British psychedelic albums. However, around the same time, Syd had started to exhibit serious mental health issues, largely attributed to the use of psychedelic drugs. His behaviour became more and more erratic, and along with various particularly troublesome USA performances, Syd and Pink Floyd parted company in March 1968.\n\nSyd continued as a solo artist, releasing two albums - ‘The Madcap Laughs’ in January 1970 along with ‘Barrett’ in November the same year. Syd’s musical activity during this time was largely studio-based, with his last solo appearance on John Peel’s BBC radio programme in February 1970. In August 1974 Syd withdrew from the music industry, returning to live as a recluse in Cambridge and a life of painting.\n\nRoger ‘Syd’ Barrett died of pancreatic cancer on July 7, 2006 at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. His music has influenced scores of musicians over the years and in 2010 EMI Records released a new collection of tracks on the album ‘An Introduction to Syd Barrett’. In 2011 the book ‘Barrett, The Definitive Visual Companion’ was published by Essential Works, which provides a comprehensive study of Syd as an artist.\n\nThe destruction of the Spanish town of Guernica, which inspired Pablo Picasso to paint his masterpiece of the same name, also brought nearly 4,000 children to Britain as refugees from the Spanish Civil War.\n\nPublic opinion was outraged by the bombing of Guernica, the first-ever saturation bombing of a civilian population. The Basque government appealed to foreign nations to give temporary asylum to the children, but the British government adhered to its policy of non-intervention. The Duchess of Atholl, President of the National Committee for Spanish Relief, took up the campaign to urge the government to accept the Basque children and finally, permission was reluctantly granted. However, the government refused to be responsible financially for the children, saying that this would violate the non-intervention pact. It demanded that the newly formed Basque Children’s Committee guarantee 10s (50p, but the equivalent of about £50 in 2010 values) per week for the care and education of each child.\n\nThe children left for Britain on the steamship Habana on the 21st May 1937. Each child had been given a cardboard hexagonal disc to pin on his clothes with an identification number and the words ‘Expedición a Inglaterra’ printed on it. The ship, supposed to carry around 800 passengers, carried 3480 children, 80 teachers, 120 helpers, 15 Catholic priests and 2 doctors. The children were crammed into the boat, and slept where they could, even in the lifeboats. The journey was extremely rough in the Bay of Biscay and most of the children were violently seasick.\n\nThe steamer arrived at Southampton on 23rd May. Thousands of people lined the quayside and the children, in spite of their ordeal, were excited, thinking that the bunting that was up everywhere was to celebrate their arrival: later they learned that it had been put up for the coronation of George VI which had taken place ten days earlier!\n\nThey were sent in busloads to a camp at North Stoneham in Eastleigh that had been set up in three fields. The setting up of the camp in less than two weeks was the result of a remarkable effort by the whole community: volunteers had worked round the clock and all through the Bank Holiday to prepare it.\n\nThe children were completely unprepared for camping: the majority had lived in densely packed flats in the working class districts of one of the most industrialised city in Spain. In fact, many of the children did not stay there long: the idea was that they should be dispersed in homes or ‘colonies’ as soon as possible. (The Basque government insisted they stay in groups, to preserve their national identity.) The first to offer asylum was the Salvation Army, which undertook to take 400, followed by the Catholic Church, which committed itself to take 1,200 children. Little by little, from the end of May, the children left the provisional camp in groups to go to other homes situated all over Great Britain and staffed and financed by individual volunteers, church groups and trade unions.\n\nThe Cambridge colony was considered to be one of the most privileged. From June 1937 until January 1938, 29 children from the ‘Ayuda Social’ orphanage in Bilbao, whose fathers, militiamen, had been killed in the early stages of the war, were housed in a former derelict vicarage at Pampisford, then transferred until November 1939 to a house in Station Road Cambridge leased by Jesus College. The children had all been brought up in an intensely political atmosphere and were very receptive to and benefited from the support of local academics and students. A programme of essentially child-centred educational activities was drawn up, mornings being dedicated to schoolwork, afternoons to painting, music and handicrafts. The children produced their own magazine ‘Ayuda’, which came out monthly. Their music teacher was Rosita Bal, a pupil of de Falla, and she trained them in music and dances that were performed in concerts all over East Anglia and London. Professor Francis Cornford, whose son, the poet John Cornford, had been killed fighting with the International Brigade in Spain, invited the children for a month in the summer of 1938 to his mill at Ringstead, on the Norfolk coast. Another academic family actively involved with the children was that of the Dean of Trinity College, Dr H F Stewart, who with his wife, Jessie Stewart, offered much hospitality to the children. Their daughter Frida organised fund-raising tours all over the country for the Cambridge colony’s concert party\n\nAfter the fall of Bilbao and Franco’s capture of the rest of northern Spain in the summer of 1937, the process of repatriation began. By the late 1940s, most of the children had been reunited with their families, either in Spain or in exile. Over 250 children settled permanently here. Despite the hardships that were endured, life in the colonies was a unique experience of community living. From a practical point of view, it was a positive experience – there were undoubtedly happy times - nevertheless, the underlying sadness and anxiety of separation from their families would never be forgotten.\n\nNatalia Benjamin\n\nFor decades the Eagle was the local pub for scientists from the nearby Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. It was there on 28 February 1953 that Francis Crick and James Watson, who had been working at the laboratory that day, celebrated the discovery of the structure of DNA.\n\nThe Eagle Inn has a long history as a significant part of the Cambridge scene. Some of its timbers as well as its name go back to the 16th century. During the great era of the stagecoach, visitors rolled in underneath its arch after a long day’s journey up from London.\n\nThe property was acquired by neighbouring Corpus Christi College, and in the twentieth century the accommodation was taken over as student lodgings. The pub occupied rooms at the back of the yard, where locals, visitors and students enjoyed its traditional atmosphere. During World War II American servicemen based in the area gathered in the bar, and wrote names and service numbers on the ceiling in smoke – now preserved under varnish.\n\nBy the 1950s the University Cavendish Laboratory had long been famous for pioneering work on the structure of the atom. It had also become, in 1947, the temporary home of a Medical Research Council Unit, researching the structure of biological molecules. Francis Crick joined the Unit in 1949, having shifted his interests from physics to chemistry and thence to biology. Two years later a young American biologist, James Watson, joined the team. He had attended a conference that year, 1951, in Naples at which he had seen X-ray diffraction pictures of DNA. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) was one of the subjects of the moment for biologists looking at molecular structure. It was realised that somehow the structure of DNA was crucial to how living cells replicated. The work of Linus Pauling in America and of Maurice Wilkins at King’s College London (who had shown the X-ray picture) was moving towards identifying the precise structure: possibly a helix, but what were the components, how did they fit together and how could the form reproduce itself?\n\nCrick and Watson found themselves sharing an office in the Cavendish and an enthusiasm for this puzzle. Drawing together the clues from published research, they also made contact with Wilkins again, and the work being done by Rosalind Franklin and her research student Raymond Gosling. Franklin, a Cambridge graduate of Newnham College, was working in Wilkins’s team at King’s, but the relationship was an unhappy one, lacking the constructive collaboration that Watson and Crick enjoyed. She was concentrating on X-ray diffraction to examine the structure of DNA, and described her findings at a colloquium in November 1951. On this basis, Watson and Crick constructed a model of the structure. When they invited her to see it, Franklin pointed out a number of errors. Watson had not remembered her findings accurately enough.\n\nThere was a pause of several months until information from other experiments reached them, and they returned to considering how the chemicals in DNA - adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, or A, T, G and C could fit the information they had. Further photographs from King’s helped, in particular Photo 51, a high-quality X-ray diffraction image taken by Raymond Gosling, a graduate student working under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin, in May 1952. They showed more clearly the size of the molecules and the helical construction. Watson pursued the idea of pair bondings that might fit the two-chain helical structure deduced by Crick. With the physical aid of cardboard cut-outs a possible pattern emerged, which they constructed in a model as a double helix. Everything fitted.\n\nOn 28 February 1953 Crick announced dramatically in the Eagle pub that they had found the secret of life. The formal scientific presentation of their results, with those of Wilkins and Franklin, appeared in Nature in April 1953.\n\nIn 1962 Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine “for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material”. (Rosalind Franklin had died of cancer in 1958, and as the Prize is never given posthumously was not able to share the credit that was her due.) Their work initiated a flood of further research round the globe to read in detail the secrets of the code of life.\n\nThe MRC Unit moved out of the Cavendish to the School of Medicine where it became the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. A large model representing the double helix can be seen through its window, at the building on the Addenbrooke’s site.\n\nProfessor Watson unveiled another representation of the double helix in November 2005 in the grounds of Clare College.\n\nThe first blue plaque celebrating this event was unveiled by James Watson in 2003 but it provoked debate because it made no mention of Rosalind Franklin, whose scientific work provided data on which the discovery relied. In recent years there have been efforts to increase awareness of the role played by important female scientists, whose work has sometimes been overshadowed by their male colleagues. Rosalind Franklin was one such scientist and so the DNA plaque without her name became emblematic of this cause. To the extent it had been graffitied with ‘+ Franklin’ (see photo below). Over time the condition of the plaque had deteriorated and we decided to replace it, and this gave us the opportunity to recognise the work of Franklin, Maurice Wilkins and others, as well as that of Crick and Watson.\n\nThe new plaque was unveiled by Professor Christopher Howe at a ceremony at Corpus Christi College/The Eagle in August 2023.\n\nAnne was born into a well-to-do Essex family, the Waldegraves, and her father, a county gentleman and JP, gave her a good education, including, very unusually for women, the study of law, for he said women as well as men must live under the law and should understand it. By the time she was 18, civil war had broken out between King and Parliament, and the social, political and religious ideas of the time were all being openly challenged.\n\nShe married James Docwra, of an old landed family who by 1655 had become a supporter of the new and controversial Quaker movement, then barely ten years old.\n\nAfter James Docwra died in 1672, Anne moved to Cambridge where she welcomed Quakers, local or travelling, into her house. This was no easy course. The movement, begun by George Fox, was frequently attacked, for it rejected a number of current religious and social conventions. The Society of Friends (its formal name) had no priests or pastors and no liturgy. Adherents refused to pay tithes; the tenth of income, which traditionally was paid for the upkeep of the Church but which by this time, was often payable to laymen. George Fox insisted all men were equal, and no formal deference was due to any, not even the king. He instituted the pacifism that has also remained a tenet amongst the Friends.\n\nQuakers were teaching in Cambridge from as early as 1653, when two women were condemned to a public whipping after discussing their religious views with some students. Fox himself visited in 1655 and was heckled and harried by students, but managed to hold a meeting with Friends. It was probably in that year that the Jesus Lane site was first used for meetings, though for years after, individual Quakers were subject to assault and frequently imprisoned. In 1660 the Meeting House was attacked and completely wrecked.\n\nAnne’s first published writings date from 1682, when she issued ‘A Looking-glass for the Recorder and Justices of the peace, and Grand Juries for the Town and County of Cambridge’. In this she argued that ‘there is no law to Compel People to conform’, that there should be freedom of belief and discussion of religion should be done ‘in Truth and Righteousness’. She also strongly upheld the role of women in the Friends, to be one of active support and sometimes guidance to the men. There were differences of opinion within the early movement, but Anne supported George Fox, whom she met in London, and deplored publicly some of the divergent movements, even where her nephew was involved. She wrote a number of other pieces around both the organisational issues, and the spiritual nature of the movement. She wrote ‘I am sure I have no enmity in my Heart against any of them [churchmen], but do desire well for them: God’s love is Universal to Mankind …I heartily wish that they would understand and practise this, it would soon put an end to Differences in Religion.’\n\nAs a final gift to the Quakers of Cambridge she bequeathed her property in Jesus Lane on a thousand year lease, with other property and money to fund a graveyard. She died and was buried in Cambridge in 1710.\n\nAnne Docwra stood out in her times for her writings and her independence ‘a spirited, intelligent, articulate, educated, and wise lady’.\n\nHarold Stanley 'Jim' Ede was born on 7 April 1895 near Cardiff. He attended the Leys School in Cambridge, studied painting at Newlyn Art School and, after service in the First World War, attended the Slade School of Art in London. In 1921, Jim Ede married Helen Schlapp, the daughter of a professor of German at Edinburgh University, and found work in the photographic department of the National Gallery in London. The following year, he was appointed Assistant at the Tate Gallery, London, a change he describes as 'phenomenal': 'I gave up painting and became absorbed in the work of contemporary artists. I wrote a great deal about modern painting and sculpture, and came to know most of the leading artists of the day, and also the ones who were not yet known.'\n\nIt was while at the Tate that he formed important friendships with Ben and Winifred Nicholson, David Jones, Christopher Wood and other artists, and began collecting their work. He made trips to Paris that allowed him to meet avant-garde artists such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, and Constantin Brancusi.. He was also able to acquire the greater part of the estate of Sophie Brzeska, the partner of the sculptor, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, who had been killed in the First World War. Ede strongly believed in the quality of Gaudier-Brzeska's work, and made it his mission to promote it, including through his best-selling book, 'Savage Messiah'.\n\nIt was while living at 1 Elm Row, Hampstead, in the 1920s and 1930s, that Ede began the practice of opening his house and engaging with new visitors. His guests included a great variety of artists, musicians, actors and literary figures, such as Georges Braque, Sergei Diaghilev, Vaslav Nijinsky, Naum Gabo, John Gielgud, Henry Moore, and Ben and Winifred Nicholson.\n\nIn 1936, Ede retired due to persistent ill health, and began spending part of the year in Tangier, Morocco. He commissioned a modernist house there, called 'White Stone', where he and Helen lived until 1952. During the war years, Jim travelled to the USA, with Helen, on lecture tours to raise funds for Allied War Relief. It was during this period that he came to know Richard Pousette-Dart and William Congdon. The Edes also opened their house in Tangier to servicemen on leave from Gibraltar, providing weekend retreats. In 1952, motivated by a desire to be nearer to their children, they moved to Les Charlottières, Chailles, near Amboise in the Loire Valley, France.\n\nIt was during this time that Ede found himself ‘dreaming of the idea of somehow creating a living place where works of art could be enjoyed, inherent to the domestic setting, where young people could be at home unhampered by the greater austerity of the museum or public art gallery and where an informality might infuse and underlying formality’. In 1956, the Edes moved to Cambridge and renovated four derelict cottages to create Kettle's Yard, which was opened to the public in December 1957. Here, Ede installed his collection of art, furniture, glass, ceramics and other natural objects he had gathered during his life, including the first piece of furniture that he bought aged 12 - a bureau which visitors now pass as they enter the house. By carefully positioning each work of art and object he aimed to create a perfectly balanced whole, as he explains in the seminal book on Kettle’s Yard, 'A Way of Life' (1984).\n\nEde described Kettle’s Yard not as an art gallery or a museum, but ‘a continuing way of life from these last fifty years, in which stray objects, stones, glass, pictures, sculpture, in light and in space, have been used to make manifest the underlying stability which more and more we need to recognise if we are not to be swamped by all that is so rapidly opening up before us.\n\nEde held open house for two hours each day during term-time, inviting students of the University and other visitors to view the house and collection. Many visitors returning to Kettle’s Yard today recall being invited in as a student to enjoy tea and toast and to learn about art. An important tradition that continues today was the loan of works of art from the collection to students, to be hung in their college rooms for the academic year. Through this generous initiative, Ede enabled others to also live with and curate art and in their own domestic spaces.\n\nIt was always Ede's intention that he would give Kettle's Yard to a higher education institution, and on 30 November 1966, he officially handed over responsibility for the building and the collection to the University of Cambridge. From 1966, he devoted considerable energy to fund-raising for an extension to accommodate the growing collection, music events, and temporary exhibitions. The extension, designed by Sir Leslie Martin and David Owers, was opened in 1970 by Prince Charles with a performance by Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline du Pré. Ede continued to live there as 'honorary curator' until 1973, when he and Helen left for Edinburgh. Helen died in 1977 and Jim devoted the last years of his life to working as a hospital visitor, until his death in 1990.\n\nKettle’s Yard continues to thrive today as a unique space in which to view a world-renowned collection of twentieth century art. It also welcomes visitors to enjoy its exhibition programme of modern and contemporary art and public programme of talks and events that reflects both Jim’s support for contemporary artists and his wish that art was for everyone.\n\nHenry Fawcett, son of a Salisbury draper, came up to Cambridge in 1852. He entered Peterhouse but after a year migrated to Trinity Hall. This was a time when many students still idled their way through university, but Fawcett pursued the serious studies necessary to take the Mathematical Tripos and graduated in seventh place (Seventh Wrangler) in 1856. He was elected into a Fellowship at Trinity Hall, with the intention of going into law. His early interest in politics and economics continued to grow, and he was developing radical views, under the influence of John Stuart Mill and others.\n\nIn 1858 a tragic accident with a shotgun left him blind, but he was determined that this should make no difference to his plans in life. He returned to Cambridge to resume his studies and teaching, and in 1863 was appointed to a new chair as Professor of Political Economy. His interest was practical as well as theoretical, and two years later he entered Parliament as a member for Brighton. During his political career he advocated social reforms for factory and agricultural workers, votes for women, the abolition of religious tests at Oxford and Cambridge and reforms to aid the peoples of India. He was an impressive orator and his independence of thought made him respected by many, if not always by his own party.\n\nAs a participant in the women’s suffrage movement, he met the lively and talented Garrett sisters. Though Elizabeth turned down his proposal, to pursue a career as a doctor (against heavy odds), Millicent agreed to marry him, despite his handicap, in 1867. In partnership they supported each other’s work. Millicent gave Henry much secretarial assistance, and Henry encouraged Millicent in her writing and in public speaking. He had published a Manual of Political Economy in 1863, and encouraged Millicent to write and publish Political Economy for Beginners in 1870.\n\nAt this time the Fawcetts lived at 18 Brookside, when in Cambridge, and in Lambeth when Fawcett needed to attend parliament. (From 1874 he was member for Hackney.) The house in Brookside was host to many eminent visitors and it was here that the plans that led to the founding of Newnham College were laid. (Their daughter Philippa became a student there in 1887, and astounded conservative opinion by coming top of the University maths list in 1890, ahead of all the men.)\n\nFawcett had always been a vigorous sportsman and never allowed his blindness to limit his participation. He continued to row regularly with a dons’ boat, to swim (and dive) and even to skate. When the Cam froze over, he skated to Ely, heedless of the dangers of a plunge into the icy waters.\n\nIn 1880 Gladstone formed a Liberal government and appointed Fawcett Postmaster General. In this role he was immediately active, seeing the potential for new services that would aid small businesses in particular, and contribute to the national economy. He introduced the parcel post, postal orders and the sixpenny telegram and Post Office Savings schemes. At the same time he looked after the welfare of the Post Office’s employees, who included numbers of women. He also introduced female medical officers\n\nFawcett had not long to make improvements, for in 1882 he fell ill with diphtheria and was left much weakened. He continued to work, and to support the cause of women’s suffrage, even though Gladstone ignored the movement in the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1884.\n\nIn November of the same year Henry Fawcett died of pneumonia at his Brookside house. His funeral saw an unprecedented display of mourning from the many groups of people from very varied walks of life with whom he had worked. Mourners came from parliament and the government, from the University and Trinity Hall, from many branches of the Post Office and its employees, from his constituency and other political groups. The wreaths and flowers covered his coffin and filled another carriage. The long procession that set off for Trumpington church was a witness to the love and admiration felt for his kindliness and his strong principles, his independence and his energy.\n\nHe was buried in Trumpington churchyard. The music for the funeral service was played by Villiers Stamford.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett (1847-1929) was born in Aldeburgh in Suffolk into a family of pioneering Victorian women. Her father, Newsom Garrett, was a prosperous businessman who built the Maltings in Snape.\n\nHer older sister, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1836-1937), like virtually all the women in the Garrett Family, was an active campaigner for the vote and became the first woman to qualify as a doctor in England. Another of Millicent’s sisters, Agnes Garrett (1845-1935) and her cousin Rhoda Garrett (1841-82) were also trail blazers, setting themselves up as professional interior decorators and designers, R and A Garrett was the first design and decorating company run by women.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett was educated briefly at Miss Browning’s Boarding School at Blackheath run by an aunt of the poet, Robert Browning. At the age of 19 she heard the radical MP, John Stuart Mill make the case for votes for women. She was too young to sign the 1866 suffrage petition but dedicated her life thereafter to the struggle for the vote and in 1891 wrote a new introduction to Mary Wollstonecraft’s great feminist treatise, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Millicent joined several women’s suffrage groups which were writing letters, holding meetings, and lobbying for the vote, becoming President of the largest, the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies, from 1897 until 1919. The NUWSS had some 450 branches in towns and villages throughout the country and around 40 in the Eastern counties. 400 students from Girton College and Newnham College marched in London with their banner proclaiming ‘Better is Wisdom than Weapons of War’, which can still be seen in Newnham College.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett’s sympathies had always been with the Liberal Party but she lost patience with the attitudes of Liberal politicians to women’s suffrage. When the Labour Party adopted the policy that it would refuse to support any franchise measure that did not include votes for women on the same terms as men, the NUWSS abandoned its position of political neutrality and advised its supporters to vote Labour. She lived to see her vision of a world in which men and women would vote alongside one another on equal terms become a reality when universal adult suffrage was introduced in 1928, a year before her death.\n\nIn 1867 she married the Liberal MP for Brighton, and later Hackney, Henry Fawcett, a strong supporter of votes for women. Henry Fawcett, who had lost his eyesight in a tragic shooting accident, became Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge University. He was an innovative Postmaster-General introducing Post Office Savings Accounts, the telegram, and the parcel post. Acting as Henry’s amanuensis, Millicent Garrett Fawcett was admitted into meetings to which women were usually denied access. It was a very happy marriage and their only daughter Philippa (1868 –1948) was born in 1868. The family moved into 18 Brookside in 1874. The meetings to set up a college for women took place in their drawing room, which regrettably no longer exists. After Henry’s death from pleurisy in 1884 Millicent, widowed at thirty-seven, and bequeathed £9,535 in his will, left Cambridge to live with Philippa and Agnes in London.\n\nNewnham College was co-founded in 1871 by Millicent Garrett Fawcett and her supporter and friend, Henry Sidgwick, and other enlightened members of their social and intellectual circle who believed in higher education for women. Philippa was among its early students. She was a brilliant mathematician and Millicent had the pleasure of watching her daughter gain the highest examination marks and being declared ‘above the Senior Wrangler’ in the Mathematical Tripos in 1890. This, at a time when women at Cambridge were not awarded degrees by Cambridge University and were thought to have limited abilities in Mathematics and Science.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett believed that the vote could only be won through peaceable and lawful means. Her supporters were often referred to as the ‘constitutional suffragists’. The term ‘suffragette’ was invented by The Daily Mail to describe Emmeline Pankhurst and her supporters in the Women’s Social and Political Union which was formed in Manchester in 1903. At first, Millicent welcomed the heightened interest in ‘the cause’ achieved by the suffragettes who used such tactics as chaining themselves to railings and dropping leaflets from the top of high buildings and generously acknowledged how successful the WSPU had been in putting votes for women at the centre of the political arena where her own supporters had failed. However, she grew dismayed as the suffragettes were driven to adopt violent methods.\n\nIn What I Remember (1924) Millicent Garrett Fawcett writes; ‘we were convinced that our job was to win the hearts and minds of our countrymen to the justice of our cause, and this could never be done by force and violence’. Yet once the NUWSS had passed a conference motion unequivocally condemning all acts of arson and damage to property she refused to succumb to demands to denounce every woman who broke a pain of glass or set fire to a pillar box. Instead she spoke publicly against force-feeding, the terrible conditions in prison, and the unfairness of the draconian sentences for relatively minor public order offences.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett presided over banquets to welcome released prisoners and praised the courage of women prepared to suffer, and even to die, for their beliefs. The words ‘courage speaks to courage everywhere’ on her statue in Parliament Square are taken from a speech after the death of the suffragette Emily Wilding Davidson who threw herself under the King’s horse at the Epsom Derby in 1913. The Great Pilgrimage of 1912, in which a number of Cambridge suffragists took part, followed the same routes across the country as medieval pilgrims and women wore sashes proclaiming that they were ‘law abiding women suffragists’.\n\nWhen the First World War broke out in 1914 the NUWSS underwent its greatest internal crisis. Many members saw support for war in any form as a vio-lation of fundamental suffragist principles which were based on peace, non-violence and co-operation. Millicent Garrett Fawcett called upon her supporters to participate in ‘well-thought out plans of national usefulness’, such as the humani-tarian relief work of the Scottish Women's Hospi-tals for Foreign Service set up by the suffragist Elsie Inglis, but she was faced with mutiny. Support for women’s war work prevailed as official NUWSS policy but there were many resignations.\n\nMillicent Garrett Fawcett is remembered for her lifelong campaigns for women’s suffrage, women’s education, and for equal citizenship when women were barred from entry into the professions and subjected to discrimination in many aspects of the law. But she supported causes which still have resonances for women all over the world. She was an opponent of ‘sweated labour’ and supported Clementina Black’s fight to protect low waged insecure women workers and secure trade union rights. She was entrusted by the government to report on conditions in South Africa and wrote a damming report of the use of torture in concentration camps in the Boer War. She championed the Personal Rights Association which exposed men who were sexually abusing children and exploiting vulnerable young women. Josephine Butler (1928), written with Ethel M. Turner, tells of Butler’s valiant battle to repeal the iniquitous Contagious Diseases Acts which permitted women suspected of prostitution to be arrested arbitrarily and subjected to humiliating internal examinations.\n\nThe legacy of this remarkable woman lives on in the unique collection of books held at the Women’s Library at the LSE (formerly the Fawcett Library). It is continued in the Fawcett Society which dates its origins to Mill’s petition and campaigns to remove the disadvantages that women experience in public life including employment, pensions, and the criminal justice system.\n\nIn 2018 Millicent Garrett Fawcett became the first woman to be honoured by a statue in Parliament Square, London and a Blue Plaque in her memory was erected at 18 Brookside in Cambridge.\n\nGirton College was founded in 1869. It was the first residential establishment in Britain to provide full-time study at degree level for women.\n\nIts origins can be traced back to 1866 when Emily Davies and others interested in the higher education of women initiated a campaign to found, by public subscription, a college for women, ‘designed to hold, in relation to girls’ schools and home teaching, a position analogous to that occupied by the Universities towards the public schools for boys’.\n\nThe idea of founding a residential college for women at one of the older universities emerged from the national movement towards the emancipation of women in the mid-nineteenth century and was closely linked with the reform of education in schools and universities. In particular, the foundation of Girton was associated with the admission of girls to Local Examinations and the inclusion of girls’ schools in the schools inquiry commission (the Taunton commission), set up in December 1864.\n\nA leading figure in both these campaigns was Emily Davies whose energy, determination and vigour was instrumental in the realisation of Girton College. Other key figures, who are commemorated in the College coat of arms were Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon, Lady Stanley of Alderley and Henry Tomkinson.\n\nEmily Davies by Rudolf Lehmann, 1880. Reproduction with kind permission from The Mistress and Fellows, Girton College, Cambridge.\n\nOn 16 October 1869, the College was opened at Benslow House, Hitchin under the name of 'The College for Women'. In 1872 part of the present site, on the edge of Cambridge, was purchased and the College was renamed Girton College. The removal to new buildings, designed by Sir Alfred Waterhouse, took place in October 1873.\n\nAlso in 1872 an association was formed to ‘erect, maintain and conduct a college for the higher education of women’ and ‘to take such steps as from time to time may be thought expedient and effectual to obtain for the students of the College admission to examinations for degrees of the University of Cambridge, and generally to place the College in connection with that university’. However, it was not until 1948 that women were admitted to full membership of the University and Girton College received the status of a college of the University.\n\nUntil 1881 the position of women students was particularly fragile as they had to rely on the personal goodwill of University men to enter examinations and have them marked. Repeated applications to the University Senate for full admission failed, women had no formal right of admission to University lectures and laboratories until 1921. The first women were appointed to University lectureships in 1926. In August 1924 a Royal Charter was granted, constituting ‘The Mistress and Governors of Girton College’ as a corporate body. In 1954 a Supplemental Charter changed the title of the Body Corporate to ‘The Mistress, Fellows and Scholars of Girton College’ and constituted the Mistress and all actual Fellows of the College, Bye-Fellows excepted, being graduates, as the Governing Body of the College.\n\nMen have been Fellows since 1976 and in 1979, 110 years after its foundation, Girton enrolled its first male undergraduates.\n\nDavies, Sarah Emily, 1830-1921, pioneer for women's education\n\nSarah Emily Davies (always known as Emily), 1830-1921, was a pioneer and a leader in the campaign for women's education. Her papers reflect the work which she and her contemporaries accomplished for women in both educational and political fields and, in particular, her role in the foundation and early years of Girton College, Cambridge.\n\nEmily Davies was born in Southampton on 22 April 1830, the daughter of the evangelical Anglican clergyman, John Davies. She spent most of her youth in Gateshead, Co. Durham, where her father was Rector of St Mary's Church from 1839 until his death in 1861. However, visits to her brother, a clergyman in London, drew her into the Langham Place Group network and led her to examine the lives of women in Gateshead and to found a branch of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women in the North East.\n\nAfter her father's death she moved to London in 1862 which brought her into closer contact with friends such as Elizabeth Garrett (Anderson) and Barbara Leigh Smith (Bodichon) and enabled her to play a more active role in the women's movement. She immediately became involved with campaigns to improve women's education, including those to admit women to University of London degrees, to admit girls to the Cambridge Local Examinations and for the inclusion of girls' schools in the Schools Enquiry Commission. These campaigns led to other activities; she was a founder of the Kensington Society and of the London Association of Schoolmistresses and she was one of the first women to be elected to the London School Board. She was also active in the campaign for women's suffrage.\n\nAlthough her early successes were in securing improved secondary education for girls, Emily Davies' central concern was the provision of higher education for women, and it is for this that she is best remembered. Her vision to establish a college 'designed to hold in relation to girls' schools and home teaching a position analogous to that occupied by the universities towards public schools for boys' provided the first opportunity in the country for women to receive a university education on exactly the same terms as men and led to the foundation of Girton College in 1869.\n\nApart from periods of residence at Girton College, Emily Davies continued to live in London until her death, and after her retirement from Girton resumed her involvement in the suffrage movement. Throughout her life she was an active and vigorous committee woman. She published extensively on educational and suffrage issues and she was for a period editor of both the English Woman's Journal and the Victoria Magazine.\n\nBodichon, Barbara Leigh Smith, 1827-1891, nee Smith, artist and women's activist\n\nBarbara Bodichon by Samuel Laurence. Reproduced with kind permission from The Mistress and Fellows, Girton College, Cambridge.\n\nBarbara Leigh Smith Bodichon (1827-1891) was the eldest child of the liaison between Anne Longden and Benjamin Leigh Smith, MP for Norwich, 1838 and 1841-1847. Born in Sussex, her childhood was spent between family homes in Hastings and London. From an early age she travelled widely, including an unchaperoned European tour with Bessie Parkes in 1850, and made a first trip to Algiers, which was influential in her life and art, in 1856. She was a cousin of Florence Nightingale and a friend of, amongst others, George Eliot, Emily Davies and Bessie Parkes. In 1857 she married a French doctor, Eugene Bodichon, a resident of Algeria, and for many years thereafter divided each year between Algeria and Britain.\n\nBarbara Bodichon was an artist, a prolific painter of landscapes, her principal exhibitions taking place between 1850 and 1872 at the Royal Academy, the Society of Female Artists and the French Gallery, Pall Mall and other galleries. A leader of the campaigns for women’s work, suffrage, legal rights and education, she founded Portman Hall School and published 'A Brief Summary of the Most Important Laws Concerning Women' in 1854, published 'Women and Work' in 1857 and, with Bessie Parkes, founded the English Woman's Journal in 1858. She was also instrumental in the foundation of Girton College in 1869.\n\nGirton College Blue Plaque\n\nOn 30 June 2019 a blue plaque was awarded to commemorate the founding and founders of the college. The plaque was unveiled by The Rt Hon Baroness Hale of Richmond, President of the Supreme Court of the UK, as part of celebrations to mark the 150th anniversary of the college. The plaque was kindly sponsored by Girton College. This was also the first blue plaque to be put up in South Cambridgeshire District and marked the expansion of the blue plaque scheme beyond the boundaries of the city of Cambridge.\n\nThe plaque is located on the entrance tower to Girton College (Tower Drive), Cambridge, CB3 0JG.\n\nJack Hobbs was one of the greatest batsmen known in English cricket. He was the eldest son in a family of twelve, the children of John Cooper Hobbs and Florence (nee Berry). He grew up in Rivar Place, (near York Street) Cambridge and went to St Matthew’s School. His father was on the staff at the University cricket ground, Fenner’s, and also acted as a professional umpire. When Hobbs senior became groundsman and umpire for Jesus College, his son took immense delight in watching cricket there. During the school holidays he used to field at the nets and play his own version of cricket with the college servants, using a tennis ball, a cricket stump for a bat and a tennis post for a wicket. This primitive form of practice laid the foundations for his skill. Although only 10 years old, Jack tried to produce the strokes he had seen University men employ in college matches.\n\nHobbs was self-taught and never coached. When he was 12, he joined the church choir team of St Matthew’s and was also ‘borrowed’ by the team of Jesus College choir to bat for them. He helped to form the Ivy Boys Club, and they played both cricket and football on Parker’s Piece. During this time he had to work: on leaving school he became an errand boy for a local baker, before moving on to work for a whitesmith, in premises later demolished for the Lion Yard shopping area.\n\nHobbs was able to watch the best batsmen of the day at Fenner’s, the University cricket ground, or on Parker’s Piece, and spent all the time he could spare practising himself, getting up at six if necessary to play before he went to work. In 1901 he played a few matches for Cambridgeshire as an amateur and the following year got a job as coach and umpire for Bedford Grammar School, and played sometimes, with success, for Royston.\n\nThe same year he was first spotted by the Surrey cricketer Tom Haywood who was fielding his own Eleven against Cambridge Town. Hobbs’ style and talent attracted his attention and the following year he suggested a trial for Surrey. This was not straightforward, for Hobbs senior had recently died, leaving his widow a large family to support. Haywood assisted by organising a benefit match, making it possible for Jack Hobbs to consider leaving home and job. The trial was successful and he was engaged on a contract at 30s [£1.50] a week in the summer and £1 in the winter - more than many Cambridgeshire workmen earned.\n\nWhile he spent two years meeting the residence requirement to play for Surrey, he had ups and downs, but his best included fine innings of 86 against Guy’s Hospital and 195 against Hertfordshire. In 1905 he made his debut in first class cricket, scoring 88 in has first match and 155 in his second.\n\nThe following year he married Ada Gates of Cambridge, and they had in time 3 sons and a daughter.\n\nHis career with Surrey and then for England saw him make 61,237 runs, including 197 centuries. Between 1908 and 1930 he played in 61 Test matches. The First World War interrupted regular cricket series, and Hobbs worked in a munitions factory and then in the Royal Flying Corps as an Air Mechanic.\n\nThroughout his playing career, cricketers were divided into ‘gentlemen’ who could afford to play without pay and ‘professionals’ who couldn’t. This carefully observed distinction mirrored the social structure of the time, but after the Second World War it became impossible to maintain.\n\nIn 1949 Hobbs was amongst the first professional cricketers to be made life members of the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) and in 1953 he was the first professional cricketer to be knighted.\n\nFrank Woolley: ‘Jack was one of the greatest sportsmen England ever had, a perfect gentleman and a good- living fellow respected by everyone he met.’\n\nOver a very long life, Thomas Hobson became one of the best-known names of his time. For decades he carried the goods of Cambridge townspeople and scholars up and down the London road in his great ox-drawn wagons. The wagons set out regularly from Hobson’s yard on Trumpington Street (a site now occupied by St Catharine’s College) to take the three-day journey via Ware to the Bull at Bishopsgate. He inherited this business from his father in 1568, and by the time he died in 1631, had seen three generations bringing their goods and packages to be loaded up.\n\nThat would have given him temporary fame, but an idea for a new business project brought him immortality. He decided to branch out, and offer a regular horse hire service. There was a need. Few townspeople could afford to keep their own horse. In addition the undergraduates, mostly gentlemen’s sons, were used to riding for recreation, though only the richest of them could afford to stable their own horses in Cambridge.\n\nHobson’s second good idea, and the one that counted, was to control the hire, to preserve his valuable animals. He would hire them out strictly in rotation. Each horse would get a decent rest, and the young gentlemen who hoped for fiery steeds on which to race or show off, would have to take Hobson’s choice of horse: that is, they would have no choice at all. If the slowest nag in the stable was the next out, that was what they would get. The ploy quickly became famous, and ‘Hobson’s Choice’ entered the language to mean ‘no choice’. Probably the soberer sort of customer liked the assurance that they would get a well-rested, reliable animal rather than one ruined by careless students.\n\nHobson’s name in Cambridge is also preserved in the parts of a scheme to bring fresh water to the centre of the town. People often had cause to complain about the rubbish and foulness in the King’s Ditch, which bounded the south and east sides of the town. (It crossed under Trumpington Street where the Pitt Press and Fitzbillies now stand.) A plan to divert water from the Vicar’s Brook northwards, alongside the Trumpington Road and into the Ditch was effected in 1610. It seems that people then suggested the fresh water might also be good to drink, in preference to that from some of the wells and pumps in town. More work was done, to construct additional channels and pipes and to build an outlet, or conduit, on Market Hill. (It now stands at the corner of Lensfield Road.) Why are the new stream and the conduit named after Hobson? He was certainly a benefactor, giving property to help maintain the system, but so were other men. Perhaps in addition he was one of those ‘people’ who pushed to get the whole thing done, using his many contacts round the town to lobby for the project? The open channel in Trumpington Street, for watering animals, was a very handy feature for Hobson himself.\n\nHe used some of the profits of his business to go in for property development, which was not popular with everyone. With a rising population, there was a demand for small houses for folk coming into Cambridge from the countryside, to make their fortunes. But many of the better-off residents, gown as well as town, were worried that the new-comers would be poor people with no skills or savings, who would end up begging for support from the parish rates. Hobson and others like him were blamed for encouraging the influx and for building their new properties with thatch roofs – a great fire hazard in built-up areas.\n\nMaybe it was to redress this, that Hobson gave a particular legacy to the town: he provided land and properties in St Andrew’s Street for the building of a house (afterwards called the Spinning House) ‘as well for setting the poor people to work … as for a house of correction for unruly and stubborn rogues beggars and other poor persons who should refuse to work’. The Master was to be a weaver, who would supply wool and flax for the inmates to spin into yarn. (As time went on, the House became more and more a jail, and was used by the University to lock up town girl’s accused of prostitution. After particularly notorious cases in 1891, the University’s power was given up, and the Spinning House closed. It was demolished in 1901 and a police station built on the site.)\n\nHobson finally died in January 1631, commemorated also in a facetious poem by the poet Milton, who suggested Death had for years pursued Hobson up and down the London road, only catching him when a plague outbreak prohibited all transport. He was buried in St Bene’t’s church. There are several representations of Hobson, all showing a robust bearded figure, some clutching a bulging money-bag to symbolise the profits of his labours.\n\nThomas Hobson’s enterprise and business acumen certainly earned him a fortune and some of this he gave in charitable bequests to the town. It may be that the power of persuading others was an even more important factor in his legacy.\n\nEglantyne Jebb was born into a well-to-do country family in Shropshire. She was one of six children of Arthur Jebb and his wife Eglantyne. The couple had markedly liberal and progressive ideas and encouraged the development of all their children.\n\nAfter education at Oxford, and a short-lived attempt to teach, Eglantyne found herself in Cambridge, nursing her sick mother. Here she met Mrs Margaret Keynes, mother of Maynard Keynes, the economist . Mrs. Keynes was Secretary and driving force of the Cambridge-based “Charity Organisation Society\" (COS), which aimed to define the best ways to run charities and aid groups, through research and scientific methods.\n\nIn 1903 Mrs. Keynes employed Eglantyne in the COS, whose office was in Regent Street, giving her the first real taste of effective charity work. Eglantyne researched the conditions of life in east Cambridge and wrote a well-received book on poverty in the city called Cambridge: A Social Study (Macmillan, 1906). This set out some forward-thinking ideas and practical suggestions – laying the ground for Eglantyne’s focus on education and continuing development programmes as keys to helping the disadvantaged. The book, and her work at COS, gave her a sound understanding of how to make a charitable organization work. She worked at the COS until spring 1908.\n\nDuring 1917 Eglantyne volunteered to help her sister Dorothy, who had permission to import and republish news stories from Europe, which balanced the propaganda, put out by the British government. It became clear, as the First World War drew to a close, that there were terrible social effects from the allied blockade of Europe. The magazine served not only to increase the two sisters’ resolve to make a difference, but also made them, at the war’s end, amongst the most well-informed people on the state of European society. News was bad – there were shortages of food, linen for newborn babies and other daily necessities.\n\nThe blockade was extended after the 1918 Armistice and a \"Fight the Famine Council” was started in order to get political agreement to raise the blockade. In 1919, Dorothy succeeded in getting this largely politically oriented pressure group to agree to a separate “Save the Children Fund”. This aimed to provide real aid to children across Europe.\n\nOn May 19th, Eglantyne, aided by her sister, led a major meeting at the Albert Hall to announce the fund.\n\n“An associate of Eglantyne's describes the scene: \"The public arrived supplied with rotten apples destined to be thrown at the head of 'the traitors who wanted to raise money for enemy children'. But they did not insult Eglantyne Jebb; they were forced to listen to her. She began hesitantly, then, gaining by the fervour of her mission, her voice became louder. Did she convince you? It was not by the arguments, but by the passionate conviction for the cause that she defended.\"\n\nOn January 6th 1920, Eglantyne succeeded in starting the International Save the Children Union, in Geneva. She built up excellent relationships with other Geneva-based organizations, including the Red Cross who supported Save’s International foundation.\n\nEglantyne believed that every country should do its best to help its own people, and not just rely on aid. So as Save became a success across the British Empire - and spread to many other countries - the focus was not just on relief for war victims, but also for the disadvantaged children of each country. Whilst many other aid agencies were channelling help to adults, it was Eglantyne’s firm opinion that children had the greatest need. She wrote\n\n“Every generation of children, in fact, offers mankind the possibility of rebuilding his ruin of a world”.\n\nThrough the children she saw the best hope of lasting peace.\n\nBy August of 1921, the UK Save the Children had raised over £1,000,000, and Central European conditions were slowly getting better. However, at that time a massive famine struck the ‘bread basket’ Volga region of Russia. Eglantyne and Save needed to go to work with renewed vigour. It was this event that also forced Eglantyne and Dorothy to realise that Save the Children needed to be a permanent organization, and could not simply be disbanded once the job of repairing war damage in Europe was done. So, from 1921 to 1923 Save the Children swung into action. Press campaign and movies were made, and feeding centres set up. 157 million meals for 300,000 children were provided during the Russian famine.\n\nIn 1923, Eglantyne drafted a declaration of the Rights of the Child. These five simple statements were endorsed by the League of Nations in 1924. Eventually an extended, seven statement declaration became the UN’s ‘Rights of the Child’.\n\nAlthough her work took her interests far away from Cambridge (and she died in Geneva) her five years in the town learning how to analyse and respond to social need were a very important preparation to the later work for which she is deservedly reme."
