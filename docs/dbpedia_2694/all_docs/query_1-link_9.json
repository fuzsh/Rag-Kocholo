The brothers Adam are among the figures associated with Adelphi Terrace commemorated by an inscription into the stonework of a 1930s pier on the site made by the LCC in November 1951.[14] Additionally, Robert Adam is one of the figures commemorated by a rectangular LCC plaque of 1950 at 1-3 Robert Street.[15] Thomas Rhodes Armitage\n\n1824-1890\n\n\"Friend of the Blind Lived here\"\n\n33 Cambridge Square\n\nHyde Park W2 1935 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue glazed ware plaque to Thomas Rhodes Armitage, founder of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, at 33 Cambridge Square, Hyde Park on 20 February 1935.[16] The Hyde Park estate of which Cambridge Square forms a part was extensively redeveloped by the landowner, the Church Estate, to the plans of Anthony Minoprio starting in 1957 and completing around 1962. All of the early 19th-century houses in Cambridge Square were demolished.[17] Sir Joseph Banks\n\n1743–1820\n\n\"President Royal Society Naturalist Lived Here\"\n\n32 Soho Square\n\nSoho W1D 3QP 1911 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to Joseph Banks at 32 Soho Square on 14 February 1911.[18] The house was demolished in 1937. A stone tablet affixed to the new building by the LCC in 1938 commemorates Banks and two of his proteges, Robert Brown and David Don, and the meetings of the Linnean Society.[19][20] James Barry\n\n1741-1806\n\nNot yet determined\n\n36 Castle Street\n\nFitzrovia W1W 8DP 1881 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a plaque to the painter James Barry at 36 Castle Street (now Eastcastle Street), Fitzrovia in May 1881.[21][22] The house was demolished c1925. Westminster City Council have affixed a green plaque commemorating Barry to the building that now occupies the site.[23] Lilian Baylis\n\n1874-1937\n\nEmma Cons\n\n1837-1912\n\n\"Founders of The Old Vic lived here\"[24]\n\nSurrey Lodge, 6 Morton Place\n\nWaterloo SE1 7BJ 1952 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue plaque to Lilian Baylis and Emma Cons, the founders of the Old Vic theatre, at 6 Morton Place, Stockwell, in 1952. The house was demolished in 1971. Baylis and Cons were subsequently commemorated individually with Greater London Council plaques - Baylis at 27 Stockwell Park Road, Stockwell in 1974,[25] Cons at 136 Seymour Place, Marylebone in 1978.[26][27] William Blake\n\n1757-1827\n\n\"Poet and Painter Lived Here\"\n\n28 Broad Street\n\nSoho W1F 8JB 1907 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the poet and painter William Blake at No.28 Broad Street, Golden Square (subsequently 74 Broadwick Street[28]), Soho on 16 October 1907.[29] The house was demolished c1965 and a block of flats – William Blake House – erected in its place. A privately erected marker recording the location of Blake's former residence was affixed to a wall in Marshall Street.[30] Blake is commemorated jointly with the painter John Linnell by the scheme with an unusual oval fibreglass plaque at Old Wyldes', North End, Hampstead, this having been erected by the Greater London Council in 1975.[31] William Booth\n\n1829–1912\n\nCatherine Booth\n\n1829-1890\n\nNot yet determined\n\nNot yet determined ( ) A plaque commemorating the founders of the Salvation Army is referenced in the book 'Lived In London: blue plaques and the stories behind them'.[32] No address or date of installation is given. James Boswell\n\n1740-1795\n\n\"Biographer of Samuel Johnson Lived Here\"\n\n56 Great Queen Street\n\nCovent Garden WC2B 5AZ 1905 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to Boswell at No.56 Great Queen Street on 18 September 1905.[33] The house was demolished in 1915.[34] The Freemasons' Hall now completely covers the site. Boswell was subsequently commemorated by the scheme at two other locations - by the London County Council at 122 Great Portland Street, Fitzrovia in 1936[35] and jointly with Thomas Davies and Dr. Samuel Johnson at 8 Russell Street, Covent Garden by the Greater London Council in 1984.[36] Charles Bradlaugh\n\n1833-1891\n\n\"Advocate of free thought lived here 1870-1877\"\n\n29 Turner Street, Limehouse\n\nTower Hamlets 1961 ( ) A blue plaque was erected to commemorate the former residence of Charles Bradlaugh at 29 Turner Street, Limehouse by London County Council in 1961.[37] The street was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for Mile End Park and, since no suitable alternative former residence exists, the plaque has not been rehung.[38] Robert Browning\n\n1812-1889\n\nNot yet determined\n\n19 Warwick Crescent\n\nMaida Vale W2 6NE 1890 ( ) The appendices of the book \"Indication of houses of historical interest in London Volume I\" published by the London County Council in 1907 record the existence of a memorial to the poet Robert Browning erected by the Society of Arts at 19 Warwick Crescent, Paddington.[22] A photograph of the house from 1910 shows the plaque in situ but the inscription cannot be read.[39] The area went into decline in the 20th century and by the mid-1950s was among the worst slums in London.[40] Warwick Crescent was entirely cleared of properties by the Greater London Council in 1966 and new residences, to the design of the GLC's architect Hubert Bennett, constructed in their place. The plaque is listed in the 1952 edition of the LCC's \"Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest\" (which does not give the inscription) and absent from the 1960 edition so it is possible the plaque was removed or the house demolished before this. Westminster City Council affixed a green plaque commemorating Browning on the building that now occupies the site on 11th December 1993.[41] Francis Trevelyan Buckland\n\n1828-1880\n\n\"Naturalist lived and died here\"\n\n37 Albany Street\n\nSt. Pancras NW1 1949 ( ) The London County Council erected a plaque to the surgeon, zoologist, author and natural historian Francis Trevelyan Buckland at 37 Albany Street in 1949.[42] Denys Lasdun's Grade I listed building for the Royal College of Physicians completed in 1964 now occupies the site. Edward Bulwer Lytton\n\n1803-1873\n\n\"Novelist Born Here\"\n\n31 Baker Street\n\nMarylebone W1U 8EJ 1906 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque at No.31 Baker Street, Portman Square, the birthplace of Lord Lytton, on 9 August 1907.[43] The house, thought to have been Arthur Conan Doyle's model for Sherlock Holmes' fictional Baker Street residence,[44] was subsequently demolished. Lord Byron\n\n1788-1824\n\nNot yet determined\n\n24 Holles Street\n\nMarylebone W1G 0DB 1867 ( ) The first plaque placed by the official London-wide plaque scheme was erected by the Society of Arts at a house, rebuilt in 1852, on the site of Lord Byron's supposed birthplace in Holles Street.[45] This was blue encaustic ware, manufactured by Minton Hollins & Co. Plaques in the colour blue proved difficult to produce and, after the second plaque (the oldest surviving, erected in 1867 to Napoleon III, and only plaque in the scheme erected to a then-living person[46]) the majority of the SOAs plaques would be terracotta. 24 Holles Street was lost to demolition in 1889. No evidence supporting Lord Byron's residency at a particular house number in Holles Street has been found and it is likely that neither the SOA plaque nor the three subsequent plaques placed by other organisations on roughly the same site actually marked his birthplace.[47] Lord Byron\n\n1788-1824\n\n\"Poet Lived here\"\n\n4 Bennet Street\n\nSt James's 1925 ( ) On 22 June 1925 the London County Council erected a glazed ware plaque to commemorate Lord Byron at 4 Bennet Street, St James's, where he had taken lodgings in 1813.[48] This was one of a run of seven plaques made for the LCC between 1925 and 1926 by Doulton in the ‘Della Robbia’ style, featuring a colourful raised wreath surround, five of which survive.[49] The circumstances leading to the loss of the house and plaque are as yet undetermined. George Canning\n\n1770-1827\n\nNot yet determined\n\n37 Conduit Street\n\nMayfair W1S 2YF 1876 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a plaque to George Canning at 37 Conduit Street, Mayfair in the summer of 1876.[50][22] The house was subsequently demolished - a Hotel, The Westbury, now occupies the site. Canning is now commemorated by the scheme at 50 Berkeley Square, the Greater London Council having erected a standard blue roundel there in 1979.[51] Sir Colin Campbell Baron Clyde\n\n1792-1863\n\n\"Commander-in-Chief during the Indian Mutiny lived here\"\n\n10 Berkeley Square\n\nMayfair W1 1920 ( ) The London County Council decided in 1908 to erect a memorial to Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde, at 10 Berkeley Square but changes of ownership and the 1914-1918 war delayed matters until 8 November 1920.[52] The stone tablet was intentionally similar in design to a pre-existing plaque commemorating Horace Walpole at the adjacent No.10 (the Walpole plaque had nothing to do with the LCC or the London plaque scheme, having been erected privately by Mr Vernon Watney, chairman of Watney Combe & Reid.[53]) The houses were among 20 torn down to make way for modern shops and offices in 1937.[54] Joseph Chamberlain\n\n1836-1914\n\n\"Lived here for 31 years\"\n\n40 Prince's Gardens\n\nSouth Kensington SW7 1916 ( ) Shortly after his death on 22 July 1914 the London County Council - on 23 March 1915 - decided to adorn no fewer than three houses in the County of London with connections to the statesman Joseph Chamberlain with commemorative tablets.[55][56][57] The first and third of these, a bronze 'medallion' style tablet at 23 Highbury Place erected on 28 July 1915[58] and a Hopton Stone tablet at 188 Camberwell Grove, erected after some delay on 21 December 1920,[59] survive. The second, another 'medallion' style bronze, was erected on 14 January 1916 at No.40 Prince's Gardens where Chamberlain had lived for over 30 years. In 1956 the adjacent Imperial College of Science and Technology, needing to expand, acquired Prince's Gardens for redevelopment.[60] The Falmouth and Keogh Hall of University College London, which came into use in 1963, now occupies the site. John Constable\n\n1776-1837\n\n\"Painter Died Here\"\n\n76 Charlotte Street\n\nFitzrovia W1T 4QS 1906 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue plaque of 1906 at Constable's former residence, 76 Charlotte Street, Fitzrovia, on 6 March 1906.[61] The plaque was lost to redevelopment 60 years later.[62][63] Constable was commemorated by the LCC a second time at 40 Well Walk, Hampstead in 1923. The Hampstead plaque, the first to be manufactured by Royal Doulton after the change from encaustic ware to the better wearing and comparatively inexpensive 'glazed ware', survives.[64][65] Charles Darwin\n\n1809-1882\n\n\"Lived Here 1839-1842\"\n\n110 Gower Street\n\nBloomsbury WC1E 6AR 1906 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque at Darwin's former Gower Street residence on 26 February 1906.[66] In 1941 the house was badly damaged by fire caused by enemy action, collapsing overnight 16–17 April.[67] A new plaque to Darwin, indirectly replacing the first and commemorating his residence 'in a house on this site' was erected at the Biological Science Building, University College London, in 1961.[68] Thomas De Quincey\n\n1785-1859\n\n\"Man of Letters Lived Here\"\n\n61 Greek Street\n\nSoho W1D 3QR 1909 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the writer Thomas De Quincey at 61 Greek Street, Soho on 28 October 1909,[69] permission to install one at the preferred address, No.36 Tavistock Street, having been refused. This house was demolished c1937.[70] De Quincey would be commemorated by the scheme a second time in 1981, when the Greater London Council erected a blue roundel recording his connection to 36 Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, permission having now been given. This plaque is notorious for the misspelling of De Quincey's surname as De Quincy.[71] John Thadeus Delane\n\n1817-1879\n\n\"Editor of The Times from 1841 to 1877 Lived Here\"\n\n16 Serjeants' Inn\n\nTemple 1910 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the newspaper editor John Thadeus Delane at No.16, Serjeants' Inn, Temple on 20 April 1910.[72] The fate of the building, and the plaque, have not yet been determined. The site of Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, was redeveloped after the destruction of buildings in the vicinity by enemy action during The Blitz. Charles Dibdin\n\n1745-1814\n\n\"Song Writer Lived Here\"\n\n34 Arlington Road\n\nCamden Town W1F 8JB 1908 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the songwriter Charles Dibdin at 34 Arlington Road, Camden Town on 10 September 1908.[73] The house was subsequently demolished - the date is not yet established, but a modern building now occupies the site. Charles Dickens\n\n1812–1870\n\n\"Novelist lived here\"\n\n1 Devonshire Terrace\n\nMarylebone W2 3DR 1903 ( ) A blue encaustic ware plaque was erected by London County Council at 1 Devonshire Terrace, near Hyde Park on 10 August 1904, the house that Dickens had moved to in 1839 and lived in until 1851.[74] The plaque was identical to that erected by the LCC the year before at Dickens' previous residence, 48 Doughty Street.[75] In spite of the Dickens connection (and questions raised in parliament),[76] the house was demolished to make way for an office block (15-17 Devonshire Terrace).[77] The present site is marked by a large mural, depicting Dickens and some of the characters he created, by the sculptor Estcourt James Clack.[78] William Friese-Greene\n\n1870-1924\n\n\"Pioneer of cinematography lived here\"\n\n136 Maida Vale\n\nPaddington W9 1QB 1954 ( ) 53456 136 Maida Vale was demolished in 1997 despite local opposition.[79] The Friese-Greene plaque, an LCC example erected in 1954 was retrieved by English Heritage but, there being no alternative residence, has never been rehung[80][81] Henri Gaudier-Brzeska\n\n1891-1915\n\n\"Sculptor and Artist worked here\"\n\n454 Fulham Road\n\nFulham SW6 1BY 1977 ( ) The Greater London Council erected a blue plaque to the French artist and sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska at 454 Fulham Road in 1977.[82][83] The entire group of buildings was demolished to make way for the Fulham Broadway development c2004, the plaque being recovered by English Heritage who initially planned to re-site it.[84] This did not come to pass, Gaudier-Brzeska being commemorated with a new plaque at 25 Winthorpe Road, Putney in 2017.[85][86] Edward Gibbon\n\n1737-1792\n\nNot yet determined\n\n7 Bentinck Street\n\nMarylebone W1U 2EH 1896 ( ) A plaque had been erected the house where Gibbon wrote much of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by the Society of Arts in 1896 but it was removed when that former residence was demolished thirteen years later. A new plaque was considered in 1925, proposed again in 1949 and, after some debate and considerable delay caused by an intransigent owner, a replacement affixed to the new building by the LCC in 1964. This was a rare late instance of the 'authenticity rule' being waived - the new plaque stating that Gibbon, having no connection to the property, 'lived in a house on this site'.[87] Joseph Grimaldi\n\n1778-1837\n\nnot yet determined\n\n22 Calshot Street\n\nFinsbury N1 1938 ( ) The London County Council erected a plaque to the clown Grimaldi at 22 Calshot Street, Finsbury, in 1938. In Grimaldi's time it was 22 Southampton Street, renumbered 33 in 1889 and renamed Calshot Street in the year the plaque was put up.[88] The plaque was taken down in 1960 when the terrace was scheduled for demolition.[89] English Heritage erected a new blue plaque to Grimaldi at 56 Exmouth Market, Clerkenwell in 1989.[90] Sir John Herschel\n\n1792-1871\n\n\"Astromomer Lived Here\"\n\n56 Devonshire Street\n\nMarylebone W1G 1904 ( ) The London County Council erected a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque to the astronomer Sir John Herschel at No.56 Devonshire Street, Portman Square on 29 July 1904.[91] The house was subsequently demolished. William Hogarth\n\n1697-1764\n\nNot yet determined\n\n30 Leicester Square\n\nLeicester Square WC2H 7LA 1881 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a memorial tablet to Hogarth at 30 Leicester Square in 1881.[92] The plaque is recorded in situ in the appendices of the first bound volume of the LCC's 'Indication of Houses of Historical Interest' published in 1907.[93] It is still present in the appendices of volume five[94] but absent from the edition of 'Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest' published in 1953. Hogarth lived, and died, at 30 Leicester Square. His townhouse, latterly forming part of the Sabloniere Hotel in the south east corner of the square, was demolished in 1869 to make way for Archbishop Tenison's School which had been displaced from its former location in the 'new' churchyard of St Martin-in-the-Fields by an extension to the National Gallery.[95] An exterior photograph of the school, opened 1871 (reproduced from St John Adcock's 'Wonderful London' published in three volumes 1926-1927) shows the plaque in situ.[96] The school moved to Kennington Oval in 1928. The precise date of the vacated buildings subsequent demolition - between 1930 and 1953 - has not been determined, however the site is now occupied by 29-30 Leicester Square, a seven storey office block completed in 1953.[97] Thomas Hood\n\n1799-1845\n\n\"Poet Here wrote the Song of the Shirt\"\n\nDevonshire Lodge, 17 Elm Tree Road\n\nSt. John's Wood NW8 9JX 1908 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the poet Thomas Hood at No.17 Elm Tree Road, St. John's Wood on 11th September 1908.[98] The house no longer exists, a purpose built block of flats named 'Elm Tree Court' now occupies the site. Hood was commemorated by the scheme a second time, a Hopton Wood stone tablet being erected at 28 Finchley Road, St. Johns Wood in 1912, the LCC - having erected the Elm Tree Road plaque on the basis that this house no longer stood, only to discover in 1911 that it did - wishing to place a memorial at a more prominent location.[99] This plaque survives, but has been illegible since the 1960s. It was joined by a standard blue English Heritage roundel in 2001.[100] Thomas Henry Huxley\n\n1825-1895\n\n\"Biologist Lived Here 1841\"\n\n88 Paradise Street\n\nRotherhithe 1912 ( ) The London County Council, having already commemorated Thomas Huxley at No.4 Marlborough Place, St. John's Wood in 1910, decided in the same year to place an almost identical blue encaustic ware tablet at another of his former London residences, No.88 Paradise Street, Rotherhithe (prior to renumbering in 1873, one of two No.58s in Paradise Street) where he had worked as an assistant to a Dr. Chandler in 1841. Difficulties in manufacturing the plaque delayed its installation and it was not affixed until 11th March 1912.[101] The house no longer stands; the Pynfolds Estate constructed 1953-4 now covers the site though it is likely that the house was demolished long before this to make way for tenement housing. The St. Johns Wood house and plaque survive.[102] Edward Jenner\n\n1749-1823\n\n\"Originator of Vaccination Lived Here\"\n\n14 Hertford Street\n\nMayfair W1J 7RP 1905 ( ) The London County Council erected a green encaustic ware plaque to the originator of vaccination, Edward Jenner, at No.14 Hertford Street, Mayfair on 9 August 1905.[103] The house was demolished in the 1920s. The apartment block that replaced Jenner's former residence, Hertford Court, still occupies the site. Charles Samuel Keene\n\n1823-1891\n\n\"Caricaturist Lived Here\"\n\n112 Hammersmith Road\n\nHammersmith W6 1930 ( ) A tablet of blue glazed ware was erected to commemorate the former residence of Charles Samuel Keene at 112 Hammersmith Road by the London County Council on 17 November 1930.[104] The building was demolished to make way for the expansion of the J. Lyons & Co. Ltd. Cadby Hall office and factory complex, a replacement plaque being erected at the former site of 82 Hammersmith Road in 1937,[105] also now lost. Charles Samuel Keene\n\n1823-1891\n\n\"Artist, lived in a house on this site from 1865 to 1891\"\n\nCadby Hall (site of 82 Hammersmith Road)\n\nHammersmith W6 1937 ( ) A blue plaque was erected by the London County Council at Cadby Hall, the offices of J. Lyons & Co. Ltd., in 1937 to commemorate the site of the former residence of Charles Samuel Keene following the demolition of 112 Hammersmith Road and the loss of the memorial placed on that building by the LCC seven years previously.[105] With the decline and takeover of J. Lyons & Co. in the late 1970s, the Cadby Hall complex was scaled down until the site was finally cleared in June 1983.[106] Edward Lear\n\n1812-1888\n\n\"Artist and writer lived here\"\n\n30 Seymour Street\n\nMarylebone W1H 7JB 1960 ( ) 238 The London County Council erected a blue plaque to the artist, illustrator, musician, author and nonsensical poet Edward Lear in 1960. By 2012 the building was determined to be structurally unsound and the plaque was removed prior to a complete rebuild. The new facade of 30 Seymour Street has been made to look identical to the old one but is entirely modern[107] and the scheme 'authenticity' rule means the plaque could not be reinstated at this address. English Heritage anticipated the rehanging of the plaque at a new address in its 2016 program announcement, but this has not yet come to pass.[108] John Leech\n\n1817-1864\n\n\"Caricaturist Born Here\"\n\n28 Bennett Street, Stamford Street\n\nBlackfriars 1907 ( ) A chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque commemorating the humorous artist John Leech was erected by the London County Council at No.28 Bennett Street, Stamford Street, S.E. on 1 July 1907.[109] 28 Bennett Street was demolished in 1923.[110] The LCC erected a glazed ware plaque on the new building to record that Leech, and the engineer John Rennie, lived in a house formerly on the site, on 21 March 1929.[111] This too has been lost, the 1923 buildings being demolished in 1971.[112] Joseph Lister\n\n1827–1912\n\n\"Surgeon lived here\"\n\n12 Park Crescent\n\nMarylebone W1B 1PH 1915 ( ) 2501 One of the more 'storied' plaques in the Official London plaque scheme. This black 'medallion style'[113] bronze tablet was erected to commemorate Joseph Lister, pioneer of antiseptic surgery, who had died in 1912, by London County Council at 12 Park Crescent, Regent's Park on 20 August 1915. Park Crescent was damaged during the 1939-1945 war, and the plaque was believed to have been lost or scrapped in the aftermath. 'The Blue Plaque Guide' by Victor Burrows (published with the co-operation of the LCC in 1953) contains a line drawing by E. W. Fenton of 12 Park Crescent with the plaque shown in situ.[114] When the decision was taken by the Crown Estate to rebuild the structures (supposedly retaining the original Regency period facades by John Nash) in the 1960s, an appeal in The Lancet magazine led to the missing plaque being found, and it was ceremonially unveiled following its reinstallation in 1966.[115] Following the 1966 re-unveiling, the plaque remained in situ at 12 Park Crescent until 2018 when, during further rebuilding work it 'disappeared' again. It was formally removed from the official scheme in 2019. Lister was immediately shortlisted for a new plaque, at different location identified as a suitable alternative former residence, it having transpired that those 'original' facades - which had been Grade One listed in February 1970[116] - were in fact post war rebuilds,[117] making the site ineligible under the English Heritage scheme rules. Two more recent plaques originally affixed to houses on the western arm of Park Crescent by the Greater London Council after the 1960s reconstruction - to Dame Marie Tempest in 1972[118] and Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1981[119] - were reinstated following the demolition of these houses in 2016 to make way for another rebuilt row of new, much larger houses retaining the appearance of Nash's originals. The replacement plaque is to be at 52 Maple Street, Bloomsbury.[120] Lord Macaulay\n\n1800-1859\n\n\"Died here\"\n\nHolly Lodge, Campden Hill\n\nKensington W8 1903 ( ) The first plaque to be installed under the auspices of the London County Council, a blue encaustic ware plaque to the historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay, was unveiled at Holly Lodge, Campden Hill, Kensington by Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery at a ceremony that took place on 26 November, 1903[121] (Rosebery's speech is reproduced in full in the first volume of 'Indication of houses of historical interest in London' published by the LCC in 1907.[122]) Macaulay's former residence was demolished c1968 for an extension to Queen Elizabeth College,[123] the plaque being rescued and privately re-erected on the new building (Atkins Buildings) with a supplementary plaque recording its history in 1969.[124] Macaulay's plaque was removed for the final time in 2003, prior to the Atkins Buildings being demolished; the Tasker House development now occupies the site.[125] A later London County Council plaque commemorating Macaulay and his father, erected in 1930, can be seen at 5 The Pavement, Clapham.[126] Matthew Maris\n\n1839-1917\n\n\"Painter Died here\"\n\n18 Westbourne Square\n\nPaddington W8 1923 ( ) The London County Council erected a plaque of blue glazed ware to commemorate the Dutch painter, etcher and lithographer Matthijs Maris at No.18 Westbourne Square, Paddington, on 9 May 1923.[127] Westbourne Square no longer exists - it was all but destroyed by a V1 flying bomb in 1944.[128] Heinrich Karl Marx\n\n1818-1883\n\n\"Socialist philosopher Lived and died here\"\n\n41 Maitland Park Road\n\nBelsize Park NW3 2EX 1935 ( ) A wreathed blue plaque of glazed ware erected by London County Council on 22 February 1935,[129] the first attempt by the scheme to acknowledge Marx's time in London,[130] it was vandalised by fascist supporters[131] soon after installation.[132] After a replacement was also vandalised, the owner declined the offer of a third. Despite this, it appears in the sixth and final volume of the LCC's 'Indication of houses of historical interest in London' published three years later, with no mention made of the plaque's loss. The area incorporating 41 Maitland Park Road was badly bombed during the 1939-1945 war, and was swept away in the 1950s to make way for the Maitland Park Estate. Marx was eventually commemorated by the scheme, a Greater London Council plaque being erected at 28 Dean Street, Soho in 1967.[133] Heinrich Karl Marx\n\n1818-1883\n\n\"Socialist philosopher Lived and died here\"\n\n41 Maitland Park Road\n\nBelsize Park NW3 2EX 1935 ( ) The second London County Council plaque to Marx, installed after the first was vandalised. It too was vandalised soon after installation by fascist supporters and the owner declined the offer of a third.[131] 41 Maitland Park Road has since been demolished. Marx was eventually commemorated by the scheme in 1967, a Greater London Council plaque being erected at 28 Dean Street, Soho in that year.[133] Frederick Denison Maurice\n\n1805-1872\n\nTheologian Lived Here\n\n21 Queen Square\n\nBloomsbury 1907 ( ) A tablet of chocolate brown encaustic ware was erected to commemorate the former residence of John Frederick Denison Maurice at 21 Queen Square, Bloomsbury, by London County Council on 30 September 1907.[134] The property adjoined the Ladies Turkish Baths to the rear of the (then brand new) Imperial Hotel (1907-1967) which was owned by the hotel.[135] Part of the rebuilt (1967) hotel now occupies the site. Maurice was commemorated by the London plaque scheme for a second time by the Greater London Council, a standard blue roundel being erected at 2 Brunswick Place, Marylebone in 1977.[136] Margaret McMillan, CH\n\n1860-1931\n\n\"Pioneer of nursery education lived here\"\n\nThe Rachel McMillan College, Creek Road\n\nDeptford SE8 1985 ( ) English Heritage erected a plaque to Margaret McMillan at The Rachel McMillan College in Deptford in 1985. The plaque was removed prior to the redevelopment of the site in 2003. A new English Heritage plaque commemorating Margaret and her sister Rachel was affixed to 51 Tweedy Road, Bromley in 2009.[137] James Mill\n\n1773-1836\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\n\n1806-1873\n\n\"In this house lived James Mill 1773-1836 and here was born his son John Stuart Mill 1806-1873\"\n\n39 Rodney Street\n\nPentonville 1907 ( ) The London County Council erected a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque to James Mill and John Stewart Mill at 39 Rodney Street, Pentonville, on 18 October 1907.[138] The house was demolished for the Priory Green estate in about 1948, the plaque being destroyed in the process.[139] John Stuart Mill had, shortly prior to the unveiling of the Rodney Street plaque, been commemorated individually by the LCC at 18 Kensington Square, South Kensington, with a green encaustic ware plaque having been affixed to this address on 26 March 1907; this plaque survives.[140] One of the houses considered by the LCC for the commemoration of both men, discounted in favour of Rodney Street, was No.40 Queen Anne's gate, passed over because of its secluded position away from traffic.[138] English Heritage affixed a blue roundel, commemorating the Mills' connection to this house, in 2012.[141] John Milton\n\n1608-1674\n\n\"Site of the House in which John Milton wrote 'Paradise Lost' and died 1674.\n\nMessrs. Legrand and Sutcliffe, 100 Bunhill Row\n\nFinsbury 1901 ( ) The Society of Arts affixed an oblong memorial tablet of white terracotta commemorating the poet John Milton to the factory of Messrs. Legrand and Sutcliffe (a firm of hydraulic engineers) at No.100 Bunhill Row in 1901,[142] a street which was, at the time of Milton's residence, known as Artillery Row, and where he died on 4 November 1674. The precise fate of the plaque - the only oblong example erected by the SOA, the shape being dictated by the position in which it had to be placed [143] - is yet to be determined. Having appeared in the appendices of the first volume of \"Indication of houses of historical interest in London\" in 1907, the plaque is absent from the fifth volume published in 1930 and a plaque at 125 Bunhill Row affixed by the Corporation of London (which had begun its own plaque scheme c. 1925) is recorded instead.[144] There is no trace of this today, although a more recent 'City of London' plaque to Milton adorns a modern building in Bread Street.[145] Sir Isaac Newton\n\n1642-1727\n\nNot yet determined\n\n35 St.Martin's Street\n\nLeicester Square WC2H 7HS 1881 ( ) Sir Isaac Newton was first commemorated by the London plaque scheme in 1881 with a Society of Arts plaque at 35 St. Martin's Street, the location of his rooftop observatory, but this building was demolished c1913.[146] The site is now occupied by Westminster Reference Library. A second plaque to Newton had in the meantime been erected by the London County Council at 87 Jermyn Street on 9 September 1908; when this too was demolished, the plaque was recovered and attached to the new building with a supplementary plaque recording this history in October 1915.[147] Captain Laurence Oates\n\n1880-1912\n\n\"Antarctic explorer lived here\"\n\n309 Upper Richmond Road\n\nPutney SW15 6SS 1973 ( ) 9704 A blue Greater London Council plaque erected to the Antarctic explorer Captain Laurence Oates(the spelling \"Lawrence\" also appears on some official documents) in 1973.[148][149] The plaque was removed from 309 Upper Richmond Road prior to its demolition in 1999. The wherabouts of the plaque are unknown though it is likely to be in the possession of English Heritage[150] Sir Robert Peel\n\n1788-1850\n\n\"Statesman Died Here\"\n\n4 Whitehall Gardens\n\nWhitehall W4 3LT 1904 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the statesman, and father of modern British policing, Sir Robert Peel at No.4 Whitehall Gardens on 6 June 1904.[151] All the houses in Whitehall Gardens were demolished in 1938 to make way for the construction of the new offices of the Board of Trade and Air Ministry. Peel was commemorated by the scheme again when a plaque recording his residence at 16 Upper Grosvenor Street, Mayfair (jointly with his father, Sir Robert Peel 1750-1830) was placed by English Heritage in 1988.[152] Peter The Great\n\n1672-1728\n\n\"Czar of Russia, lived here\"\n\n15 Buckingham Street\n\nStrand WC2 1881 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a memorial tablet to Peter The Great at 15 Buckingham Street in 1881.[92] The Survey of London records the date of demolition as 1906 and goes on to say that whilst many writers have stated that Peter the Great lodged at 15 Buckingham Street during his visit to England in 1698, there does not seem to be a shred of contemporary evidence to substantiate the claim.[153] William Pitt, Earl of Chatham\n\n1708-1778\n\n\"Prime Minister Lived Here\"\n\nPitt House, North End Place\n\nHampstead 1909 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the former Prime Minister William Pitt (Pitt the Elder) at Pitt House, North End Place, Hampstead on 7 July 1909,[154] this being affixed to a stone gate pier some distance from the house where he had convalesced for a time in 1766-7.[155] The house subsequently fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1952 - all that survives of it is a classical garden arch, now Grade II listed.[156] Pitt would be commemorated by the scheme a second time, jointly with William Ewart Gladstone and Edward Geoffrey Stanley by the LCC at 10 St James’s Square, St James’s, on 4 October 1910. This memorial survives.[157] Charles Reade\n\n1814-1884\n\n\"Novelist Lived Here\"\n\n70 Knightsbridge\n\nKnightsbridge, SW1X 7LJ 1908 ( ) The London County Council erected a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque to the novelist Charles Reade at No.70 Knightsbridge on 28 February 1908.[158] The house was demolished in 1942, Bowater House (completed 1958) being built on the site.[159] Bowater House was in turn demolished in 2006 to make way for One Hyde Park. John Rennie\n\n1761-1821\n\n\"Engineer Died Here\"\n\n18 Stamford Street\n\nSouthwark SE1 9NY 1906 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the engineer John Rennie at No.18 Stamford Street, Southwark on 27 February 1906.[160] 16, 18 and 20 Stamford Street were demolished in 1923.[110] The LCC erected a glazed ware plaque to record that Rennie, and the caricaturist John Leech, lived in a house on the site, on 21 March 1929.[111] This too has been lost, the 1923 buildings being demolished in 1971.[112] John Rennie\n\n1761-1821\n\nNot yet determined\n\nWaterloo Bridge South Abutment\n\nSouthwark SE1 1951 ( ) A bronze plate was affixed to stones from the old Waterloo Bridge of 1817-1934 to commemorate its architect John Rennie by The London County Council in 1951.[161] The fate of this memorial is unknown - listed in the 1952 edition of the LCC's \"Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest\", it is absent from absent from the 1960 edition. Henry Handel Richardson\n\n1870-1946\n\n\"Australian novelist Lived in this house 1910-1934 and wrote The Fortunes of Richard Mahony here\"\n\n90 Regent's Park Road\n\nRegent's Park NW1 1957 ( ) A London County Council roundel commemorating Ethel Richardson, known by the pen name Henry Handel Richardson was unveiled by Sir Eric Harrison, Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom at 90 Regent's Park Road in 1957[162] but lost to demolition six years later. This was the first plaque manufactured by Carter's Tile Co. Ltd of Poole, Dorset, the change of supplier from Doulton necessitated by that firm's relocation from Lambeth to the Midlands.[163] Samuel Richardson\n\n1689-1761\n\nSir Edward Coley Burne-Jones\n\n1833-1898\n\n\"Samuel Richardson (1689-1761) Novelist and Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones (1833-1898) Painter Lived here\"\n\nThe Grange, 111 North End Road\n\nFulham W14 1925 ( ) The London County Council erected a plaque of blue glazed ware to two notable former residents of 111 North End Road, Fulham, the writer and printer Samuel Richardson and the painter and designer Edward Burne-Jones on 6 June 1928.[164] The omission of the usual wreath border to create space for the inscription gave the plaque a strikingly modern appearance, foreshadowing the simple blue roundel design that would be standardised in the late 1940s. A surviving plaque to Algernon Swinburne and Theodore Watts-Dunton, erected in March 1926, is of a similar design.[165] Latterly the house became derelict, the gardens being used as allotments during the 1939-1945 war. The 1952 edition of the LCC's 'Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest' records the address as 40 North End Crescent. The Grange was demolished in 1958, the Lytton Estate being built on the site.[166] Burne-Jones was commemorated by the London scheme for a second time in 1998, a plaque being erected by English Heritage at 41 Kensington Square, South Kensington - an address suggested to the LCC in 1927, rejected in favour of North End Road.[164][167] A privately erected plaque in the 'Hammersmith Red Plaques' series now marks the site of 111 North End Road.[168] Samuel Rogers\n\n1763-1855\n\n\"Poet Died Here\"\n\n22 St. James's Place\n\nSt. James's SW1A 1NH 1907 ( ) The London County Council erected a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque to the poet Samuel Rogers at No.22 St. James's Place on 31 January 1907.[169] The house, along with the adjacent No.21, was badly damaged during the 1939-1945 war. The site was subsequently purchased by the Crown Estate and an apartment block erected there between 1958 and 1960.[170] John Ruskin\n\n1819-1900\n\n\"Artist and Author born here b.1819 d.1900\"\n\n54 Hunter Street\n\nBrunswick Square 1900 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a plaque to John Ruskin in the year of his death at 54 Hunter Street.[171][172] This was one of a number of run-down Georgian houses demolished to make way for the Brunswick Centre in the late 1960s.[173] Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\n1792-1822\n\n\"Poet Lodged here\".\n\n26 Nelson Square\n\nSouthwark SE1 0PY 1932 ( ) The London County Council had considered commemorating Shelley as early as 1904, but could not find an address that qualified, the poet rarely staying in any one place for any length of time. In 1931 a three-month residence at 26 Nelson Square in Southwark came to light and a plaque of blue glazed ware was duly erected there on 26 February 1932.[174][175] The plaque, which in light of Shelly's brief residency stated that the poet 'lodged here' rather than 'lived here', these words uniquely following the curve of the wreath,[176] was lost when the house was demolished in 1950, Southwark Borough Council having acquired the bomb damaged site for redevelopment.[177] Shelley was much later commemorated by the Greater London Council at 15 Poland Street, Soho with an enamelled steel plaque in 1979, lost in 1996, replaced by English Heritage in 2000.[178] Sarah Siddons\n\n1755-1831\n\n\"Actress Lived Here\"\n\n54 Great Marlborough Street\n\nSoho W1F 7JU 1907 ( ) A chocolate brown plaque was erected by London County Council at 54 Great Marlborough Street to commemorate the actress Sarah Siddons connection to the house on 20 June 1907. The LCC had established Siddons' residence at this address when deciding what to do about an earlier plaque, erected by the Society of Arts in 1876 (the first to commemorate a woman) which had been removed from her former Baker Street residence in 1905 prior to demolition[179] (this plaque was eventually affixed to the rebuilt property and, when this too was demolished in the 1960s, gifted to the Theatre Museum. It is now part of the V&A Collection). 54 Marlborough Street was demolished in 1958[180] although this appears to have been overlooked by the LCC when preparing the list published in 1960.[181] John Snow\n\n1813-1858\n\n\"Physician and specialist anaesthetist who discovered that cholera is water-borne lived here\"\n\n18 Sackville Street\n\nSoho W1F 7JU 1949 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue plaque to the physician John Snow at 18 Sackville Street in 1949.[182][183] The house was demolished in 1965.[184] Mary Somerville\n\n1780-1872\n\n\"Scientific Writer Lived Here\"\n\n12 Hanover Square\n\nMayfair W1S 1JJ 1909 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the scientific writer Mary Somerville at No.12 Hanover Square on 26 October, 1909.[185] The house was demolished in 1968.[186] Stamford Street\n\nIn one of the houses formerly on the site of this building John Leech (1817-1864), caricaturist, was born and in another John Rennie (1761-1821) Engineer, died.\n\nStamford Street\n\nSouthwark 1929 ( ) The London County Council had erected plaques to the engineer John Rennie and the caricaturist John Leech at houses in Stamford Street in 1906 and 1907 respectively, but both were lost to demolition in 1923. Circumstances precluding the reinstatement of the original encaustic ware plaques, the LCC decided to erect a tablet of white glazed ware bearing their coat-of-arms to commemorate both men by way of a replacement, this being affixed to the new structure on 21 March 1929.[111] The tablet, one of three large plaques in this style commemorating historic sites, all of which were erected in the early part of 1929, was lost to further redevelopment in 1971.[112] The only surviving memorial of this type is in Bow Street[187] Strype Street\n\n\"Strype Street (Formerly Strype's Yard) derives its name from the fact that the house of John Strype, silk merchant, was situated there. ~ ~ ~ At that house was born in 1643 his son John Strype, Historian & Biographer, who died in 1737.\"\n\n10 Leyden Street\n\nSpitalfields E1 1929 ( ) 53457 The London County Council erected a tablet of white glazed ware bearing their coat-of-arms to commemorate Strype Street at No.10 Leyden Street - no suitable location being identified in Strype Street itself - on 8 January 1929,[188] this being one of three large plaques in this style commemorating historic sites, all erected in the early part of 1929, of which only one, in Bow Street, survives.[187] The relatively modern building to which the plaque had been affixed (Strype Street and Leyden Street were laid out in 1899-1904 on part of what had been the Halifax estate[189]) was demolished c2004. Arthur Seymour Sullivan\n\n1842-1900\n\n\"Musical Composer Lived here\"\n\n58-60 Victoria Street\n\nVictoria SW1 1928 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue glazed ware plaque to the composer Arthur Seymour Sullivan at 58-60 Victoria Street on 20 October 1928.[190] The terrace which had included Sullivan's apartment was bombed during the 1939-1945 war.[191] The street was redeveloped in the 1960s. Harry Tate\n\n1872-1940\n\n\"Music hall comedian lived here\"\n\n72 Longley Road\n\nTooting SW17 9XL 1984 ( ) A blue plaque was erected to the music hall sketch comedian Harry Tate by the Greater London Council at 72 Longley Road Tooting in 1984.[192] The house was demolished in the early 1990s, and flats now occupy the site.[193] Thomas Telford\n\n1757-1834\n\n\"Engineer Lived Here\"\n\n24 Abingdon Street\n\nWestminster SW1P 1935 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue glazed ware plaque to the engineer Thomas Telford at 24 Abingdon Street, Westminster on 20 March 1935.[194] The house was later used as the office of the National Association of Local Government Officers.[195] Abingdon Street was bombed during the 1939-45 war; the remaining derelict houses demolished in 1963-4 to create an underground car park. The College Green public park now occupies the site of Abingdon Street at ground level.[196] Sir John Tenniel\n\n1820-1914\n\n\"Artist and Cartoonist Lived here\"\n\n10 Portsdown Road\n\nMaida Vale W9 1930 ( ) The London County Council erected a light green glazed ware plaque to the illustrator, graphic humourist and political cartoonist Sir John Tenniel, most famous as the illustrator of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, at No.10 Portsdown Road, Maida Vale on 12th March 1930.[197] Portsdown Road was renamed Randolph Avenue in 1939. The house was demolished in 1959.[198] Alfred Lord Tennyson\n\n1809-1892\n\n\"Poet Lived Here\"\n\n225 Hampstead Road\n\nCamden NW1 2PY 1914 ( ) The London County Council decided to erect a medallion style bronze tablet[113] to commemorate Alfred, Lord Tennyson at 225 Hampstead Road in 1914, the plaque being affixed on 17 September of that year.[199] The house was lost to bombing during the 1939-1945 war. The bombed-out house was the site of the still-unsolved murder of Mabel Church on 13th October 1941.[200] Tennyson was not commemorated by the London plaque scheme again for over 50 years, an English Heritage blue plaque being affixed to 9 Upper Belgrave Street, Belgravia, where he had lived for a year or so in the 1880s, in 1994.[201][202] John Thurloe\n\n1616-1668\n\n\"Secretary of State to Cromwell lived here during the term of his office 1645-1659\"\n\n24 Old Square (Chancery Lane elevation)\n\nLincoln's Inn 1890 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a plaque to Oliver Cromwell's Secretary of State John Thurloe at 24 Old Square, later 24 Old Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, in 1890.[203][204][172] The circumstances by which the plaque came to be removed are yet to be determined - it is recorded as in situ in the LCC's 1960 list.[204] The site is now marked, on buildings post-dating Thurloe's residence, by a blue plaque erected by the Cromwell Society (The plaque is affixed to the Chancery Lane elevation, as was the SOAs).[205] Lokamanya Tilak\n\n1856-1920\n\nNot yet determined\n\n60 Talbot Road\n\nBayswater W2 5LE 1961 ( ) Tilak was first commemorated by the London County Council, a plaque being unveiled at 60 Talbot Road, Bayswater by Kwame Nkrumah, President of Ghana, in 1961. Tilak had only lived here for a few months but the owners of his main London residence, 10 Howley Place, Maida Vale refused consent for a plaque. The Talbot Road house was demolished by Westminster City Council to make way for flats in 1975, the plaque being returned to the Greater London Council.[206] A new English Heritage plaque was erected at 10 Howley Place - the residence where permission had been refused 27 years earlier - in 1988.[207] Charles Turner\n\n1774-1857\n\n\"Engraver Lived here\"\n\n56 Warren Street\n\nMarylebone W1T 1924 ( ) The London County Council placed a plaque of blue glazed ware to commemorate the engraver Charles Turner at No.56 Warren Street on 18 June 1924.[208] The house still stands and is Grade II listed, the official list entry recording that the house was refronted in the late 20th Century.[209] Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov\n\n1870-1924\n\n\"Lenin Founder of the U.S.S.R. lived here 1902-1903\"\n\n30 Holford Square\n\nFinsbury WC1 1942 ( ) The plaque scheme was suspended 1940-1948 as a wartime economy but this plaque was an exception, unveiled, together with a bust of Lenin to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his time in Holford Square, by Ivan Maisky, the Russian Ambassador and his wife at a time when Russia was an important ally against the Axis powers. Evidently a propaganda stunt, the event is featured in a Pathe news reel in March 1942 and the 20 April 1942 edition of Life Magazine, where the building to which the plaque is affixed is seen to be heavily bomb damaged. It would in due course be demolished, replaced by flats designed by Berthold Lubetkin in the early 1950s. The 1942 newsreel commentary states that the plaque would later be shipped to the Soviet Union, but what actually became of it is unknown.[210][211] George Frederick Watts O.M.,R.A.,\n\n1817-1904\n\n\"Painter Lived and died here\"\n\nLittle Holland House, 6 Melbury Road\n\nHolland Park WC1 1925 ( ) The London County Council erected a plaque of glazed ware to commemorate the artist, member of the Holland Park Circle and creator of the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice in Postman's Park, George Frederic Watts, on 7 July 1925.[212] This was one of a run of seven plaques made for the LCC between 1925 and 1926 by Doulton in the ‘Della Robbia’ style, featuring a colourful raised wreath surround, five of which survive.[49] Little Holland House, built in 1875-6, was designed for Watts by Frederick Pepys Cockerell with an gallery extension by George Aitchison added in 1878. It was demolished in 1964, being replaced by a block of flats (Kingfisher House) in 1965.[213] Sir David Wilkie\n\n1785-1841\n\n\"Painter Lived Here\"\n\n144 Kensington High Street\n\nKensington W8 1907 ( ) The London County Council erected a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque to the painter Sir David Wilkie at No.144 Kensington High Street (formerly No.24 Lower Phillimore Place) on 21 January 1907.[214] The house, and what else remained of Upper and Lower Phillimore Place were demolished in 1931-32, replaced by blocks of shops and flats. Phillimore Court on the corner of Campden Hill Road and Kensington High Street now occupies the site.[215] Subject Inscription Location Year installed Photo Open Plaques\n\nref Notes Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n\n1722-1834\n\n\"Poet & Philosopher Lived Here\"\n\n71 Berners Street\n\nFitzrovia W1T 3LA 1905 ( ) A chocolate brown wreathed London County Council plaque was erected to commemorate Coleridge at 71 Berners Street on 20 December 1905.[216] The house was demolished in 1908 to make way for an extension to a department store and the plaque re-erected with a supplementary tablet recording this history the same year. Both plaque and tablet were re-erected again in 1928 following the construction of a larger store. The moves contributed to the deterioration of the plaque and it was replaced under the aegis of the Greater London Council with a standard blue example, which - at the transition between the two bodies - had been manufactured on behalf of and bears the name of the LCC, in 1966.[217][218] Benjamin Disraeli\n\n1804-1881\n\n\"Earl of Beaconsfield Born Here 1804\"\n\n22 Theobalds Road\n\nHolborn WC1X 8NX 1804 ( ) Erected by the LCC in 1904, this chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque was destroyed during the 1939-1945 war and was replaced with a ceramic replica in 1948[219][220] - the material used to make the majority of plaques for the scheme having been changed to Doulton glazed ware in 1923.[221] Flying Bomb\n\n1944\n\n\"The first Flying Bomb on London fell here 13th June 1944\"\n\nRailway Bridge, Grove Road\n\nBow E3 1985 ( ) The GLC erected an enamelled steel plaque at this site on the 41st anniversary of the first V1 'Doodlebug' to fall on London, in June 1985. This was stolen in 1987. English Heritage replaced it with a traditional ceramic plaque, bearing their name along the top edge but otherwise identically worded, in 1988.[222] Sigmund Freud\n\n1856-1939\n\n\"Founder of Psychoanalysis lived here in 1938-39\"\n\nThe Freud Museum, 20 Maresfield Gardens\n\nHampstead NW3 5SX 1956 ( ) The first plaque commemorating Freud at 20 Maresfield Gardens was erected by the LCC and unveiled by his daughter Anna in 1956, the 100th anniversary of his birth. Issues with the supplier resulted in the use of an inferior surface mounted enamelled steel item. When it was decided to commemorate Anna Freud at the same address in 2002, the opportunity was taken to replace the steel LCC plaque with a matching one of the traditional ceramic type.[223][224] Thomas Gainsborough\n\n1727-1788\n\nNot yet determined\n\nSchomberg House 80 Pall Mall\n\nSt James's SW1Y 5ES 1881 ( ) The current London County Council plaque of 1951 replaced a tablet erected by the Society of Arts at 80 Pall Mall in 1881[225] which had weathered beyond the point of legibility.[226] This was not the Schomberg House of Gainsborough's time, this having been demolished in 1850. The replacement building to which the SOA tablet had been affixed was pulled down c1909.[227] The replacement for the 1909 building was largely demolished in 1956, the facades of 81-82 being retained and that of No.80 being rebuilt to its original form. John Richard Green\n\n1837-1883\n\nHistorian of the English People Lived here\n\n4 Beaumont Street, London\n\nSt James's W1G 6AA 1909 ( ) Green was first commemorated at 4 Beaumont Street by the London County Council with a chocolate brown encaustic ware plaque on 17 March 1909.[158] This house was demolished in 1924 and the plaque re-erected on the new structure, but it was damaged in the process and replaced in 1964 by another LCC plaque. A rare late example of the 'authenticity' rule being waived - Green had no connection to this property, and the replacement plaque states that he 'lived in a house on this site' - the house to which it was affixed has since been rebuilt again twice, with the current structure dating to 1988.[228] George Frederick Handel\n\n1685-1759\n\nNot yet determined\n\n25 Brook Street, London\n\nMayfair W1K 4HB 1870 ( ) Handel was first commemorated at 25 Brook Street by the Society of Arts in 1870. This brown plaque had weathered past the point of legibility by the middle of the 20th century and was replaced by the LCC with a standard blue example in 1951.[229] George Frederick Handel\n\n1685-1759\n\n\"Musician lived and died here\"\n\n25 Brook Street, London\n\nMayfair W1K 4HB 1951 ( ) The 1951 LCC plaque, a replacement for a damaged SOA plaque of 1870 was itself replaced in 2001, English Heritage taking the opportunity to correct the previous anglicisation of Handel's middle name, change his occupation from 'Musician' to 'Composer' and move it to a lower position on the facade, aligning it to their 1997 plaque to Jimi Hendrix at No.23 Brook Street in the process.[230][231] Thomas Hardy\n\n1840-1928\n\n\"Poet and novelist lived here 1878-1881\"\n\n172 Trinity Road\n\nTooting SW17 7HT 1940 ( ) The first plaque to Thomas Hardy at 172 Trinity Road was erected in March 1940,[232] shortly before wartime economies forced the closure of the London-wide plaque scheme for seven years. The plaque was one of a handful made to an experimental design, the majority of which were manufactured before - but would not be installed until after - the war. These prototypes omitted the wreath, allowing a greater space for the inscription and, although brown in colour were in most respects similar to the standard blue roundels still in use today. A notable survivor of these prototypes is the first, a plaque to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at 180 Ebury Street, erected in 1939[233]). It appears that the Hardy plaque was faulty as it quickly wore out and had to be replaced with the current blue LCC example in 1962.[234] Thomas Hood\n\n1799-1845\n\n\"Poet Died Here\"\n\nDevonshire Lodge, 28 Finchley Road\n\nSt John's Wood NW8 6ES 1912 ( ) 54218 The London County Council erected a tablet of Hopton Wood stone at Thomas Hood's former residence on 30 April 1912. This was not the first memorial erected to Hood by the LCC; in 1908, the council - believing Devonshire Lodge to have been demolished - had affixed a blue encaustic ware roundel to 17 Elm Tree Road house, since lost, in the rather out-of-the-way environs of Elm Tree Road, St. Johns Wood. Information having come to light revealing that Devonshire Lodge still stood, the LCC decided to commemorate Hood a second time in this more prominent location.[99] The stone plaque weathered badly, and was illegible by 1960. In 2001 English Heritage decided to add a standard blue roundel to supplement the LCC plaque, on the lower floor, leaving the original in situ below two upper storey windows.[235][236] A detailed drawing for the original plaque survives in the English Heritage archive, being reproduced on page 494 of 'Lived in London' Rudyard Kipling\n\n1865-1936\n\n\"Poet and story writer lived here 1889-1891\"\n\n43 Villiers Street\n\nCharing Cross WC2N 6NE ( ) Kipling was first commemorated at 43 Villiers Street by the scheme in 1940 - only four years after his death - with one of the London County Council's experimental series of brown plaques. As with the plaque commemorating Thomas Hardy in the same series, it weathered badly and was replaced with a standard blue example in 1957.[237] David Lloyd George\n\n1863-1945\n\n\"Earl Lloyd George of Dwyfor 1865-1945 Prime Minister lived here\"\n\n3 Routh Road\n\nWandsworth Common SW18 3SW ( ) The first plaque to Lloyd George at 3 Routh Road, erected by the Greater London Council in 1967, gave an incorrect date of birth - he was born in 1863, not 1865 - and was replaced by English Heritage in 1992.[238] Guglielmo Marconi\n\n1874-1937\n\n\"The pioneer of wireless communication lived here in 1896-1897\"\n\n71 Hereford Road\n\nBayswater 1952 ( ) The first London County Council blue plaque at this site, erected on 25 April 1952 (Marconi's birthday) was found to be defective and replaced in 1954.[239][240] George Moore\n\n1852-1933\n\n\"Novelist lived and died here\"\n\n121 Ebury Street\n\nBelgravia SW1W 9QU 1936 ( ) The first London County Council blue plaque at this site, erected in 1936, gave an incorrect date of birth (1851, Moore was born on 24 February 1852) and described him as a novelist rather than an author. It was replaced, after The Spectator noted these errors, the following year.[241][242][243] The plaque illustrated in 'Indication of Houses of Historical Interest in London' is the replacement. No mention is made of the error and the - usually precise - date of installation is absent from the text. Arthur Onslow\n\n1691-1768\n\nSpeaker of The House of Commons from 1728 to 1761 Lived Here\n\n20 Soho Square\n\nSoho W1D 3QW 1912 ( ) Onslow was first commemorated with a Hopton Wood stone tablet erected at 20 Soho Square by the London County Council in July 1912.[244] The plaque was recovered after the Restoration era building was demolished to make way for an eight storey office block being built for Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell in 1924–6[245] but was deemed unsuitable for re-use and a new bronze plaque was made instead, this being erected in 1927.[246][247] Sardar Vallabhbhai Javerbhai Patel\n\n1875-1950\n\n\"Indian Statesman lived here\"\n\n23 Aldridge Road Villas\n\nLadbroke Grove W11 1BN 1986 ( ) The original plaque, erected by the Greater London Council in 1986, was damaged during building work. It was replaced with an exact replica, retaining the name of the long-since-abolished GLC along its top edge, by English Heritage in 1991.[248] William Pitt the Younger\n\n1759-1806\n\n\"Lived here\"\n\n120 Baker Street\n\nMarylebone W1D 3QW 1904 ( ) A pale green encaustic ware plaque to William Pitt the Younger was installed at 120 Baker Street (then 14 York Place) by the London County Council on 15 August 1904,[249] but this disappeared when the house was remodelled in 1925. Plans were made in the late 1930s to replace it with a brown plaque in the LCC's experimental series but the war intervened before it could be made and in the end a standard blue roundel was affixed in 1949. The drawing for the original plaque survives in the English Heritage archive, being reproduced on page 412 of 'Lived in London'.[250] It was similar to the William Hazlitt plaque at 6 Frith Street,[251] which was erected in 1905. This was also pale green in colour, but has weathered to light blue over time. A drawing of the intended replacement also appears in the book, revealing it to be identical in design to the eventual replacement in every respect except colour.[221] Sir Joshua Reynolds\n\n1723-1792\n\nNot yet determined\n\n47 Leicester Square\n\nLeicester Square WC2H 7LT 1869 ( ) Reynolds was one of the earliest recipients of a memorial from the official London-wide scheme, a plaque being erected by the Society of Arts at his townhouse in Leicester Square in 1869, two years after the first. The plaque was removed when the house was demolished to make way for Fanum House, the new headquarters of The Automobile Association, in 1937. The replacement, one of the LCCs experimental series of brown plaques, was installed in 1947. It was removed in 1957 when work to extend Fanum House began, and re-affixed at first-floor level in 1960. The AA added an enamelled steel plaque duplicating the wording of the LCCs at street level in 1965.[254][255] The building at 48 Leicester Square, subsequently renamed Communications House, was extensively reconstructed and reconfigured in 2016,[256] neither plaque being disturbed in the process. John Ruskin\n\n1819-1900\n\n\"Lived Here\"\n\n28 Herne Hill\n\nHerne Hill SE24 9QS 1909 ( ) Not the first plaque in the scheme to Ruskin - a Society of Arts plaque is recorded as having been affixed to his birthplace, 54 Hunter Street, Bloomsbury,[257] demolished to make way for the Brunswick Centre in the late 1960s - the first memorial at 28 Herne Hill was a standard roundel erected by London County Council on 19 July 1909[258] which was lost when the house was demolished c1925, being replaced by two new houses, 26 and 28 Herne Hill. The replacement plaque marking the site, dated 1925 and bearing the initials LCC, was placed in 1926. It is, unusually, bronze, and affixed to a stout wooden post in the garden, the houses being set too far back from the road for a plaque to be visible to passers by from the pavement.[259][260] Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\n1792-1822\n\nNot yet determined\n\n15 Poland Street\n\nSoho SE1 0PY 1979 ( ) The London County Council had commemorated Shelley in 1931 with a plaque at 26 Nelson Square, obliterated when the house was demolished by Southwark Borough Council in 1950. In 1979 the Greater London Council erected an enamelled steel memorial at 15 Poland Street, where Shelley had lived for a typically short period (as many as 19 different London lodgings have been identified) in 1818, the material chosen in preference to ceramic due to weakened brickwork resulting from an IRA bomb that detonated nearby on 29 January 1977.[261] This plaque was mislaid during renovation work in 1996, and was replaced with an English Heritage one, also enamelled steel, in 2000.[178] Sydney Smith\n\n1771-1845\n\n\"Author and Wit Lived Here\"\n\n14 Doughty Street\n\nKing's Cross WC1N 2PL 1905 ( ) The wreathed chocolate brown plaque of 1905, placed by the London County Council at 14 (formerly No.8) Doughty Street to commemorate Sydney Smith's residence, was found to be faulty in manufacture and was replaced the following year.[262] Tyburn Tree\n\n\"Here stood Tyburn Tree Removed 1759\"[263]\n\nJunction of Edgware Road and Bayswater Road\n\nMarble Arch W2 1909 ( ) A triangular London County Council plaque from 1909 originally marked the location of the tree at ground level. Made of granolithic with the wording in brass and a depiction of the ancient gallows at the centre,[264] it was replaced with the current circular memorial by the Greater London Council in 1964, the original having been displaced by road improvements.[265][266] The London County Council does not initially appear to have considered this marker to be part if the 'Indication of houses of historical interest in London' scheme, being absent from their books on the subject. Evelyn Underhill\n\n1875-1941\n\n\"Christian philosopher and teacher lived here 1907-1939\"\n\n50 Campden Hill Square\n\nHolland Park W8 7JR 1975 ( ) The Greater London Council erected a blue plaque to the Anglo-Catholic writer and pacifist Evelyn Underhill at 50 Campden Hill Square, Holland Park in 1975.[267] Examination of the structure led the GLC to conclude that the tight space called for a different style of plaque to the usual blue roundel, so one was made - this being rectangular, surface mounted, and instead of the enamelled steel normally employed for this sort of application, was made from fibreglass. The plaque did not weather well - it was found to be damaged when inspected in 1988 and the decision made to replace it. Measurements having been taken, it transpired that a standard blue roundel would fit after all.[268] The new English Heritage plaque - a standard blue ceramic roundel, 495mm (19½ inches) in diameter, was affixed in 1990.[269] Fibreglass was used by the scheme on only one other occasion - a unique oval plaque commemorating William Blake and John Linnell at Old Wyldes', North End, Hampstead, this also being put up in 1975[270] - in this instance the material being chosen as suitable for attachment to the weatherboarded walls of the seventeenth century farmhouse.[271] Sir Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford\n\n1676-1745\n\n\"(Statesman) lived here\"\n\n5 Arlington Street\n\nSt James's SW1A 1RA 1881 ( ) The Society of Arts erected a terracotta encaustic ware plaque to Sir Robert Walpole, later Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, KG, PC, at 5 Arlington Street in 1881.[92][182] Badly weathered, it was replaced with a joint plaque to Sir Robert and his son Horace by the Greater London Council in 1976.[272] Thomas Young\n\n1773-1829\n\n\"Man of Science Lived Here\"\n\n48 Welbeck Street\n\nMarylebone 1905 ( ) The London County Council erected a light green encaustic ware plaque at Young's former Welbeck Street residence on 3 April 1905.[273] Having deteriorated, it was replaced with the present standard blue roundel[274] by the LCC in 1951.[275] Subject Inscription Location Year installed Photo Open Plaques\n\nref Notes Captain Cook\n\n1728-1779\n\n\"Circumnavigator lived here\"\n\nCaptain Cook's Landing Place\n\nSeventeen Seventy, Gladstone Region, Queensland, Australia 1907 ( ) The London County Council commemorated Captain James Cook's connection to 88 Mile End Road with a terracotta memorial tablet on 4 October 1907.[276] This was removed in 1959 when the house was demolished.[277] The plaque was shipped to Australia (with one of the chimney pots) as a gift to the Trustees of Captain Cook's Landing Place where it still resides.[278] A much larger slate plaque was erected by the Greater London Council on a wall at the site of 88 Mile End Road in 1970, the unusual choice of form and material reflecting the exceptional nature of the commemoration.[279] Charles Dickens\n\n1812–1870\n\n\"Novelist Lived Here\"\n\nCourtyard of Prudential Buildings\n\nHolborn W1W 5BR 1886 ( ) 31035 A Society of Arts plaque originally affixed to Furnival's Inn, in which Dickens resided for a time, in 1886. This building was demolished in 1897, being replaced by the Prudential Assurance buildings where the plaque can be seen today, it having been privately re-erected in the 1910s. The appendices of the book \"Indication of houses of historical interest in London Volume III\" published by the LCC records the plaque in the courtyard of Prudential Buildings, Holborn Bars in 1912.[280] Perhaps in error, it is recorded as being part of the scheme in the edition of the LCC's 'Commemorative Tablets on Houses of Historical Interest' published in 1952.[281] Only the Doughty Street plaque is listed in the 1960 edition. Charles Dickens\n\n1812–1870\n\n\"Novelist Lived Here in Boyhood\"\n\nGarden of the Charles Dickens Museum, 48 Doughty Street,\n\nKing's Cross WC1N 2LX 1911 ( ) 55907 A tablet of Hopton Wood stone was placed at No.13 Johnson Street, Somers Town to commemorate the former residence of Charles Dickens, by London County Council on 23 August 1911.[282] The building was demolished in 1932 and flats now cover the site. The tablet was presented by the LCC to the Charles Dickens museum which had opened at 48 Doughty Street in 1925. It is displayed in the back garden of the house. An earlier LCC plaque to Dickens, erected in 1903, can be seen on the front of the museum building - this plaque remains part of the official scheme. Johnson Street was renamed Cranleigh Street between 1936 and 1939. The site of the Dickens' family residence was marked by the Brook & Cranleigh House Residents Association with a blue plaque in 2011.[283] Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding\n\n1882-1970\n\n\"Leader of Fighter Command lived here 1941-1951\"\n\nNational Memorial Arboretum, Croxall Road\n\nBurton-on-Trent DE13 7AR 2000 ( ) 579 Blue plaque erected by English Heritage in 2000 at 3 St Mary's Road, Wimbledon, removed prior to the rebuilding of the house in 2009. A privately erected replacement adorns the new structure. The English Heritage plaque is currently on display at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. John Flaxman\n\n1755–1826\n\n\"sculptor lived and died here\"\n\nGreenwell Street\n\nFitzrovia W1W 5BR 1876 ( ) 235 The Society of Arts erected a plaque to commemorate the sculptor John Flaxman at 7 Greenwell Street in 1876. Scheduled for demolition in the early 1980s, efforts were made to save Flaxman's former studio[284] citing his former residency as a reason for the significance of the structure, but these were unsuccessful and the Georgian building was subsequently demolished by Westminster City Council. The plaque was privately re-erected on the block of flats built on the site. English Heritage briefly reincorporated the plaque into the scheme from around 2010 until 2016 when it was de-listed on the grounds that the location was inauthentic. Benjamin Franklin\n\n1706–1790\n\n\"Lived Here. Printer, Philosopher and Statesman\"\n\nBasement of 36 Craven Street (The Benjamin Franklin House Museum)\n\nCharing Cross W1W 5BR 1869 ( ) 54272 Benjamin Franklin was known to have lived at 7 Craven Street during his sixteen years in London and this address was an early recipient of a commemorative plaque from the 'official' London-wide plaque scheme. In 1903, research by Sir Laurence Gomme of London County Council revealed that the house was not in fact the former Franklin residence - comparison of rate books and street directories revealing that Franklin's lodgings had been renumbered twice in the intervening years and what had been No.7 in his time survived as No.36. The truth came to light in 1913 when attempts were being made to save No.7 from redevelopment due to its supposed historical significance and the Society of Arts was forced to admit its mistake.[285] The LCC erected a bronze 'medallion style' plaque at No.36 in 1914 and for a time, before No.7 was demolished, the two plaques stood on opposite sides of the street, no doubt leading to some confusion. In the 20th century No.36 was used as a hotel, then as a base for several non-profit groups (and was for a time occupied by squatters), but was in dire condition at the end of the century when the freehold was granted to the Friends of Benjamin Franklin House by the UK government. Following structural reinforcement and restoration the house opened as a museum on 17 January 2006, the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth. The SOA plaque from the long-lost No.7, which had been for many years in the possession of the Museum of London, was presented to the museum and is on display in the basement corridor. David Garrick\n\n1716–1779\n\n\"Actor Lived Here\"\n\nThe Garrick Club, 15 Garrick Street,\n\nLeicester Square WC2E 9AY 1876 ( ) 54273 This plaque was originally sited at No.5 Adelphi Terrace, one of a block of 24 unified neoclassical terrace houses built between 1768 and 1772 by the Adam brothers, incorporating a new headquarters for the Society of Arts (latterly the Royal Society of Arts). Many of these were demolished in 1936,[286] being replaced with the New Adelphi, a monumental Art Deco building, with only No.11 and the purpose-built Royal Society of Arts headquarters (expanded to incorporate two of the former houses) surviving from the old development. The plaque was assumed to have been lost or destroyed at this time, until 2015 when remarkably it resurfaced to be sold at auction.[287] Acquired by the Garrick Club, it has been put on display in the reception area of the club at 15 Garrick Street. The London plaque scheme later commemorated Garrick at Garrick's Villa, Hampton Court Road, the GLC erecting a standard blue roundel there in 1970.[288][full citation needed] Charles George Gordon\n\n1833-1885\n\n\"born here 1833 killed at Khartoum 1885\"\n\nGordons’ School, Bagshot Road\n\nWoking GU24 9PT 1959 ( ) 5330 The London County Council erected a ceramic blue plaque at 29 The Common, Woolwich SE18 to commemorate the birthplace of General Gordon in 1959, replacing an earlier memorial to Gordon erected by the Woolwich Antiquarian Society in January 1900.[182] After the house was demolished in 1971 the plaque was presented to the Gordon Boys’ School by the GLC.[289][290] Emma, Lady Hamilton\n\nc.1765-1815\n\n\"Lived Here 1803-1806\"\n\nSankeys 39 Mount Ephraim\n\nRoyal Tunbridge Wells TN4 8AA 1958 ( ) 31616 An LCC Blue Plaque erected in 1958 at 11 Clarges Street, Picadilly removed when the building was demolished five years later. It now forms part of the vintage signage collection of a public house in Tunbridge Wells.[291] Octavia Hill\n\n1838-1912\n\n\"Housing reformer lived here\"\n\n1 Millbank\n\nMillbank 1951 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue glazed ware plaque to Octavia Hill at 8 Fitzroy Street, Fitzrovia in 1951.[171] The plaque was removed when that building was demolished in 1961 and subsequently relocated to the first floor of 1 Milbank, at the time the offices of the Church Commissioners but today used by the House of Lords, for display. The building is not open to the general public.[292] Hill was commemorated again by the scheme when English Heritage erected a blue plaque at 2 Garbutt Place, Marylebone in 1991.[293] Edmund Kean\n\n1787-1833\n\n\"Actor Lived here\"\n\nVictoria & Albert Museum, Cromwell Road\n\nSouth Kensington W1J 8AE 1904 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue encaustic ware plaque to the actor Edmund Kean at No.12 Clarges Street,Picadilly on 20 October 1904.[294] The plaque was saved when the building was demolished in 1963. The V&A Catalogue records that the plaque was donated to the British Theatre Museum Association by the Greater London Council in December 1964 and subsequently passed to the V&A. It is not currently on display.[295] A photograph of the house showing the plaque in situ appears in an article about Mayfair in Picture Post magazine (No.80, published January 28 1939).[296] The Labour Party\n\n\"Site of the Congregational memorial hall the Labour Party was founded here 27 February 1900\"\n\n5 Fleet Place (Farringdon Street elevation)\n\nFarringdon EC4M 7RD 1985 ( ) 2933 This black plaque of a unique design - acknowledging, as with the equally distinct plaque to Captain Cook, the exceptional marking a 'site-of' rather than an authentic building - was affixed to a 70's office block named Caroone House in 1985, shortly before the Greater London Council was abolished. It was removed from the scheme immediately prior to the demolition of this building in 2004. The plaque was subsequently privately re-erected close to its former location, at 5 Fleet Place, part of the Ludgate West development.[297] William Charles Macready\n\n1793-1873\n\n\"Actor Born here\"\n\nVictoria & Albert Museum, Cromwell Road\n\nSouth Kensington W1J 8AE 1928 ( ) The London County Council erected a blue glazed ware plaque to the actor William Charles Macready at 45 Stanhope Street (3 Mary Street at the time of Macready's birth), Regent's Park, on 25 June 1928. The house was subsequently demolished - the date of this is undetermined, but what remains of the curtailed Stanhope street is now lined by post-war residential blocks. The plaque is now in the possession of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[143] The V&A Catalogue records that it was originally donated to the British Theatre Museum Association by the LCC and that is not currently on display.[298] George Odger\n\n1820–1877\n\n\"Labour Leader lived and died here\"\n\nSt Giles in the Fields 60 St Giles High Street,\n\nSt Giles WC2H 8LG 1949 ( ) 7586 Above the chest in the south corner of the right hand (north) lobby of St Giles in the Fields is this blue plaque recovered from 18 St Giles High Street, Holborn demolished to make way for the Centre Point office block, commemorating George Odger who was secretary of the third congress of trade unions in 1871, which established the Trades Union Congress. A sign below the plaque says 'The George Odger plaque, formerly on 18 St Giles High Street, was placed here in 1974'. It was originally put up in 1949. Mrs. Siddons\n\n1755-1831\n\n\"Actress. Lived here\"\n\nVictoria & Albert Museum, Cromwell Road\n\nSouth Kensington 1876 ( ) The first plaque in the London scheme commemorating a woman was erected by the Society of Arts to honour the actress Sarah Siddons at 17, York Place, Baker Street or No.27 Upper Baker Street - sources differ - in 1876. It was removed during demolition work to make way for an extension to the Metropolitan Railway's Baker Street station in 1905. The Metropolitan Railway Company offered to reinstate the plaque on the new building but the LCC felt this would create a false impression and proposed that it be re-erected on another of Siddons' residences, 54 Great Marlborough Street or, alternatively, placed on the new building but with a supplementary plaque making it clear that the house was not original. The latter suggestion was adopted and on 19 December 1905 the SOA plaque was affixed to the new building, beneath which was attached a smaller rectangular plaque with the wording \"Tablet fixed 1876: Premises rebuilt and tablet refixed 1905\".[299] The plaque was still listed as in-situ by the LCC in 1960.[42] At some point in the following decade the house was demolished, the plaque was rescued and given to the Theatre Museum (now part of the Victoria and Albert Museum) by the LCC.[300] The plaque remains in the possession of the V&A but is not currently on display. The LCC would erect its own memorial to Siddons at 54 Great Marlborough Street in June 1907, lost when that house was demolished in 1958.[180]"
