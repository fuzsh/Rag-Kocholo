Here we take a celebratory tour of theatre blue plaques in London including Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, David Garrick, Edith Evans and many more.\n\nAs you walk around London you will notice blue plaques on a number of buildings.\n\nLondon’s blue plaques have become tourist attractions in their own right as they mark out the former homes of some of London’s most famous, accomplished and even notorious people. There none more worthy of a blue plaque than London’s past theatre workers and artists.\n\nLondon’s blue plaques scheme is administered by English Heritage and has been running for over 140 years. The plaques help to mark places in the capital where important people in history have lived, worked and died.\n\nNaturally, there are numerous plaques celebrating theatre people and those associated with West End and West End Theatre’s long and varied cultural heritage.\n\nWe’ve attempted to summarise a number of the theatre-related plaques below and linked to Google Maps to help you find them.\n\nHave we missed some out? Got some corrections?
