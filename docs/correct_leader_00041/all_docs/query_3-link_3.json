        "text": "(1821–93). Lawyer and statesman John Abbott’s long life of public service to Canada was climaxed in 1891 when, as leader of the Conservative party, he succeeded Sir John A. Macdonald as prime minister of Canada. During his short term in office he accomplished a major revision of the jury law.\n\nJohn Joseph Caldwell Abbott was born on March 12, 1821, in St. Andrews, Lower Canada (now St.-André-Est, Quebec). He received his early education in St. Andrews and in Montreal, then entered McGill University. Abbott became a lawyer in 1847 and was made queen’s counsel in 1862. From 1855 to 1880 he was dean of the Faculty of Law at McGill University. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the then-united province of Canada in 1857 and continued to represent his native county, Argenteuil, until 1887, except during 1874–80. In 1862 Abbott served briefly as solicitor general in the government of John Sandfield Macdonald and Louis Sicotte before going over to the Conservatives after confederation in 1867.\n\nAbbott served as legal adviser to financier Hugh Allan, one of the builders of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and was implicated in the Pacific Scandal of 1873, in which Prime Minister John A. Macdonald was accused of awarding a railway construction contract to Allan in return for campaign funds. Abbott accordingly was defeated in the 1874 election and was not reelected to the House of Commons until 1880. Seven years later he was appointed to the Senate, in which he was made government leader. On the death of Macdonald in June 1891, Abbott emerged as compromise choice for prime minister, but he resigned the following year because of ill health. In 1892 he was made a knight commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. Abbott died in Montreal on Oct. 30, 1893."
