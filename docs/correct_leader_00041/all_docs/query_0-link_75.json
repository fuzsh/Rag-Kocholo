        "text": "He has been referred to as the moral compass of Genoa City by Jerry Douglas, the actor that portrayed him for nearly 25 years, and that would be appropriate for the corporate giant/husband/father, John Abbott. He started out as the founder of Jabot Cosmetics, whose wife, Dina, left him to raise three children on his own. A proud man with a big heart, John had a knack for falling for the wrong woman. Despite five marriages (although his marriage to Gloria Fisher is still in dispute) and numerous flings and affairs, he always supported his children, Ashley (who really was fathered by Brent Davis), Jack (except for the time Jack had a fling with Jill and John kicked him out of the house and Jabot) and Traci (who, at one time, battled an addiction to pills that almost took her life). They were later joined by half sibling Billy (William Foster Abbott), a son by John’s second union with Jill Foster. Through it all, John struggled with Heart Disease, suffering several heart attacks and strokes before a stroke on August 11, 2006 placed him in a permanent vegetative state. On August 18, the Abbott family, backed by a reluctant Fisher clan, decided to honor John’s &quot;Do not resuscitate&quot; request and pulled the plug.\n\nHere’s a look at the people in John Abbott’s life and events that made the man, affectionately known as &quot;the old guy&quot;, great:\n\nMarriages:\n\nDina Abbott- Though they are divorced and she lives in Paris, she has returned to Genoa City now and again, trying to win him back (can we say meal ticket?).\n\nJessica Blair- Christine’s (known as Cricket at the time) mother had come to town to make amends with her daughter before she died of AIDS. John fell in love and married her anyway. When Christine tracked down her real father, John nobly stepped aside so the family could briefly be reunited before Jessica passed. She died with all her loved ones by her side, including John.\n\nJill Abbott- John married Jill twice. The first ended in divorced after he found out, from his dear friend Kay Chancellor, that Jill and Jack had a steamy night in a mountain cabin. After much manipulation on her part, Jill left the first union with a seat on the board of directors, an executive position at Jabot that paid her $150,000 a year and 20% of Jabot’s stock. Several affairs later found Jill jilted by Victor &quot;the Mustache&quot; Newman and falling in love with John all over again. After giving birth to Billy, John suffered through a bout with impotency that drove Jill into the arms of Jed Sanders, leading to their second divorce and ugly custody battle for Billy. John won and left Genoa City for the Big Apple (New York City), where he liked to live from time to time.\n\nRomantic Liaisons:\n\nWhen John kicked Jack to the curb for his affair with Jill, John replaced him with Traci’s husband Brad Carlton, an Abbott gardener-turned-Jabot salesman. John was happily dating Joanna Manning (Lauren’s mom) and Ellen Winters, who was the director of the local Soup Kitchen (where Jack worked while on probation allegedly shooting Jill but was later vindicated when it was revealed that masseuse Sven was the triggerman). After Ashley was briefly hospitalized with amnesia caused by the trauma of aborting Victor Newman’s child and Traci had a miscarriage and divorced Brad, John hired Jack back to Jabot Cosmetics to clean up the mess that Brad had made of things.\n\nA particularly nasty day during the custody battle for Billy caused John to have a stroke that left him in a coma. Longtime housekeeper Mamie Johnson hardly left his bedside. Jill came upon John and Mamie kissing and fired her on the spot. Mamie insisted they were in love but later accepted an outrageous sum of money from Jill to get out of town when she thought John had rebuffed her affections.\n\nLater, John bonded with Gina Roma. They shared a friendship and a deep love of music. In 2003, John escorted Gina to the Art Council Gala. During the event, Gina found out that her restaurant was burned to the ground (thanks to Kevin Fisher, who was trying to get revenge against John’s granddaughter, Colleen, for interfering with his tryst with the young Lily Winters). John invited Gina to live the Abbott mansion for a time but she eventually became the manager to the Genoa City Athletic Club and their romance died a quiet death but their friendship would always be strong.\n\nSoon John found himself enraptured with the much younger Gloria Fisher, unaware at first to her connection with the ruthless attorney, Michael, and troubled younger brother, Kevin (she was their mother). Gloria started out as a gold-digger but soon found herself in love with the older Abbott and they shocked everyone by running off and getting married. Their union almost dissolved when John found out about whom her two sons were but Gloria quickly showed just how devoted she was to John when he broke his hip. Kevin found him at the bottom of the stairs and saved his life. Gloria never left his side while he recuperated from hip replacement surgery. Later, John returned the favor by shooting her abusive ex — &quot;terrible&quot; Tom Fisher, whom had been dating Ashley at one point. After witnessing her father shoot Tom, Ashley tried to take the blame but John confessed and took a plea bargain, serving time in a white collar prison, where he had his last massive stroke.\n\nGestures of Importance\n\nJohn took in Mamie’s street urchin niece, Drucilla Barber, for a short time to try and help her get on the right track. Drucilla evolved into a confident woman and world famous model. She married the rising young executive of Newman Enterprises, Neil Winters.\n\nJohn was known to pick up a mike every now and again and croon a tune or two. Old friend Gina would sometimes join him. Traci also inherited her father’s lovely vocal pipes and sometimes sang with Danny Romalotti, whom she competed with Lauren Fenmore for his affections. Traci and Danny decided they were better friends then lovers.\n\nWhen granddaughter Colleen was expelled from school, she began hanging out with the wrong crowd and smoking pot. John agreed to let her live with him to help straighten her out. He was a grounding influence for her.\n\nVictor Newman has always been an apt competitor and gained control of Jabot several times, usually underhandedly. One such incident sent a pregnant Ashley over to plead with Victor to stop, and her SUV was broadsided along the way. Ashley lost Brad’s baby and John was furious. He went to the Newman ranch and punched Victor in the face.\n\nJohn Abbott was the boss, husband and father that everyone wanted or strived to be. His presence will be missed. May his goodness and strength serve as a compass for the loved ones left behind…"
