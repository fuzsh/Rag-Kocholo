        "text": "ABOUT THE COLLEGE Named after Sir <strong>John</strong> <strong>Abbott</strong>, Canada's third prime minister, the <strong>College</strong> primarily serves Montreal's West Island community, although you can also meet students here from other parts of Quebec and Canada. Located in historic Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, on the western tip of the Island of Montreal, <strong>John</strong> <strong>Abbott</strong>’s distinctive red brick buildings and magnificent campus were originally deeded to McGill University in 1906 by Sir William Macdonald. Established in 1971, <strong>John</strong> <strong>Abbott</strong> offers five pre-university and eleven career programs, including Quebec’s only English-language CEGEP training in Pre-Hospital Emergency Care, Dental Hygiene, <strong>Information</strong> and Library Technologies, Engineering Technologies, Police Technology, and Youth and Adult Correctional Intervention. Over 6100 students are enrolled in the Day Division and another 2000 in Continuing Education. Only a half hour drive from downtown Montreal, the <strong>College</strong> is easily accessible by city bus or commuter train. MISSION AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE We Are Committed To: LEARNING QUALITY STUDENTS Foster in our students the ability to make and articulate informed intellectual, aesthetic and ethical decisions, while demonstrating skills needed for success in modern society. Cultivate a love of learning, autonomy and responsible citizenship in our students, both in the classroom and through socio-cultural, leadership, recreational and sports activities. Respect and learn from diverse world views and international perspectives, as reflected in our programs, our approach and our community. Provide well-rounded and balanced pre-university and career programs that meet high standards of quality and ethical consciousness, and respond to the requirements of universities, employers and society. Value excellence in teaching and learning as dynamic and interactive processes. Promote lifelong learning and continuous improvement in the <strong>College</strong> community, with a commitment to innovative pedagogy, effective administration and quality support services. Deliver leading-edge training, tailored to the needs of business, industry and other sectors, through our continuing education services and specialized programs. Cultivate a safe, caring and challenging learning environment that bolsters self-esteem and promotes a sense of belonging and purpose, mutual respect, and healthy lifestyles, leading students to attain academic, professional and personal success. Ensure governance that reflects the active engagement of students, staff and faculty, and places student learning at the centre of our decisions and actions. Establish effective partnerships with academic, professional and social communities, to maximize our students’ success and continued growth. ADMISSIONS <strong>General</strong> Admissions Policy <strong>John</strong> <strong>Abbott</strong> <strong>College</strong> accepts applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements as defined by the Ministry of Education, Leisure and Sport and who, in the <strong>College</strong>'s opinion, have a reasonable chance of succeeding in the program to which they apply. Permanent Quebec residents receive consideration over non-residents. Fulfillment of the minimum academic requirements does not guarantee acceptance. Program Selection Committees are responsible for admissions decisions and reserve the right to defer or refuse admission to any applicant whose qualifications are inappropriate to the demands of the program. A personal interview, audition, and/or portfolio may be required for admission to specific programs. The qualifications of applicants educated outside Quebec will be assessed on an individual basis by the appropriate selection committee."
