        "text": "Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, May 31, 2010 – John Abbott College will soon have an artificial turf soccer-football field equipped with a lighting system, today jointly announced the Honourable Denis Lebel, Minister of State for Canada Economic Development, and Geoffrey Kelly, Member of the Quebec National Assembly for Jacques-Cartier, acting on behalf of Michelle Courchesne, Quebec Minister of Education, Recreation and Sports.\n\nThis project, which will cost a total of $2,987,855, will be carried out thanks to $1,493,927 in combined government funding contributed in equal part by the governments of Quebec and Canada, with John Abbott College assuming the remainder of the expenses.\n\nThe initiative involves replacing one of the College's two natural grass sports fields with a synthetic surface, equipping the new field with a lighting system and installing bleachers to accommodate up to 800 spectators. In addition to ensuring greater safety, artificial fields with lighting make it possible to significantly increase playing time, require less maintenance and have a longer life span.\n\n\"Many of our recreational facilities are in need of renovation and improvement. However, restoring public infrastructure entails costs that cities and schools are simply unable to assume on their own. That is why the Government of Canada introduced the Recreational Infrastructure Canada Program, through which $500 million will be invested over two years in the modernization of our sports and recreational facilities across the country. I am pleased to see this project move forward in that I know it will improve the quality of life of Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue residents while meeting the needs of the sports teams at John Abbott College,\" explained Minister of State Lebel.\n\nThe new artificial turf field will be accessible to the students of the College as well as to Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue's entire population of nearly 5,400 residents. In addition to serving for the practice of soccer and football, the field will be designed to meet the playing requirements of flag football, rugby and lacrosse.\n\n\"I am pleased to be able to make this important announcement to my fellow citizens. This field is sure to satisfy the needs of our athletes and the general public alike. It will help promote the adoption of a physically-active lifestyle, particularly among our youth. I invite everyone to get moving and make full use of the sports facilities we are making available to them,\" added Geoffrey Kelly.\n\nThe governments of Canada and Quebec signed an agreement to accelerate the execution of recreational infrastructure projects in Quebec by March 31, 2011. To that end, the Government of Canada will invest $76 million and the Government of Quebec at least that amount in recreational infrastructure projects carried out in cost-sharing partnership with municipal administrations or local organizations. These investments are thus expected to generate greater financial leverage, as is the case with the other infrastructure programs.\n\nThe funding announced today has been awarded through the Programme de soutien aux installations sportives et récréatives of the Government of Quebec's Fonds pour le développement du sport et de l'activité physique and through the Government of Canada's Recreational Infrastructure Canada Program."
