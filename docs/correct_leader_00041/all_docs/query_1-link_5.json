        "text": "John Abbott College is one of five English language CEGEPs in Québec. Named after Sir John Abbott, Canada’s third Prime Minister, the College primarily serves the Greater Montreal region, though you can also meet students here from other parts of Québec and the rest of Canada. The College also has a significant number of international students as part of its community. In total, over 6,500 students are enrolled in the Day Division and about 2,000 in the Continuing Education Division.\n\nThe College was incorporated in 1970, merely two years after the Québec CEGEP system was launched in 1968. In September of 1971, John Abbott welcomed roughly 1200 young men and women as its first students. By 1980, the CEGEP was well established on a permanent campus and had a student base of about 4000 daytime and 2000 evening students. Since then, the College has grown by leaps and bounds, increasing attendance, adding and improving existing programs, and becoming one of the top rated English CEGEPs in Québec.\n\nSituated on the most western tip of the island of Montreal, in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, John Abbott enjoys a rural setting just a half hour drive from downtown Montreal. As one of 48 CEGEPs (collège d’enseignement général et professionnel) in Québec, John Abbott offers two types of programs: two-year pre-university programs that lead to university, and three-year career or professional programs designed to lead directly to the labour market."
