        "text": "Document Description\n\nThe John Street & Abbott Street Mixed Use Development Project would facilitate mixed use development on a 22.74-acre site located southeast of the John Street and Abbott Street intersection. The project would involve construction of a 70,000 square-foot hotel with 111 guest rooms, 242 residential units for 232,800 square feet of residential uses, 107,900 square feet of retail use, and 30,900 square feet of office use for a total of 478,800 square feet of new development. The project would be constructed in seven phases occur over 9 to 10 years. The 14 parcels that make up the project site would be reconfigured into 9 parcels. Construction of the hotel would occur in the first phase. Future development in remaining phases would include multi-story mixed-use buildings, retail and office buildings, and multi-family residential buildings. The project would also include upsizing of the adjacent sewer line beneath Abbott Street to provide increased capacity to the project site. Environmental impacts of this project have been analyzed in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) has been prepared for the project. Based on the environmental document, the project will not have a significant effect on the environment."
