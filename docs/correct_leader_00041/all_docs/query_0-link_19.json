        "text": "Muli Tang\n\nMontreal-based artist Muli Tang was born in Shanghai in 1947 into a family of creative artists. His brother Muhai Tang is a conductor who has led some of the worldâ€™s great orchestras. Their father Xiaodan Tang was a respected film director whose 1976 movie Unforgettable Battle once moved an aged, ailing Chairman Mao to tears.\n\nTang began painting as a child in state-run cultural centres. He was sent to a dairy-farm commune during the Cultural Revolution. The great turmoil ended his dream of being a scientist, and saw his father beaten and jailed. Tang saw painting as an escape, and today his work is celebrated around the world."
