APPLICATION PROCEDURES\n\n7. 7 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES Over the last fifty years the environment has increasingly become important to all sectors of society. Pollution, species extinctions, climate change, resource depletion, and a host of other environmental problems touch every- one now more than ever. Our basic life-support system is maintained by all the species that make-up the biosphere—from the smallest to the largest. The survival of these species are interconnect- ed and dependent on each other. The actual processes that take place between species and the environment are extremely complex and fragile. If humanity causes the extinction of one species—it inevitably means the extinc- tion of numerous species and the decline of our life-sup- port system for future generations and us. Unfortunately, our current economic models have neg- lected to factor into the equation the tremendous bene- fits nature provides. However, when economists and environmental scientists have tried to estimate in dollars what it would cost us to accomplish the services nature provides the results are staggering. Using multiple data- bases, they estimate that nature provides $33 trillion dol- lars worth of services every year—that's nearly twice the annual Gross National Product or GNP of all the coun- tries in the world combined. For example, forests pre- vent soil erosion, landslides, and flooding; maintain the purity of the air and water; affect local and global rainfall; temper climatic fluctuations; and promote watersheds and biodiversity. Other ecosystems like bogs, wetlands, grasslands, deserts, oceans, coral reefs, tundra-arctic regions, and so on similarly provide unique benefits. Learning to live in harmony with the natural environment and thinking critically about environmental issues requires an interdisciplinary approach. The Environmental Studies Certificate Option is an inter- disciplinary curriculum that seeks to improve the stu- dent’s understanding of key scientific, economic, and political issues that underlie environmental problems and their management. Students can address environmental issues from a variety of perspectives drawn from the natural sci- ences, the social sciences, physical education, the humanities, and the arts. Students in the certificate choose from a variety of courses that best suit their own personal approach to environmental studies. Perhaps the best reason for pursuing an environmental studies certificate is a student's own personal interest in learning more about the environment. In some cases, earning a certificate can also make a graduate more attractive to employers and to gaining entry into university programs. Problems encountered in the \"real-world\" often require understanding beyond that of a single academic discipline. For this reason, more and more employers seek people with interdisciplinary training. The Environmental Studies Certificate Option exposes students to a broad range of knowledge. It helps put other courses into perspective. The Environmental Studies Certificate is evidence to university departments and employers that the student has acquired not only depth in the major field, but breadth beyond that field—an out- standing combination. Students within any of the college's programs can receive an Environmental Studies Certificate. To achieve the Certificate students must take at least six courses designated as Environmental Studies courses, and complete a \"Special Project\", involving a self-designated assignment, in one of those courses. A list of eligible courses can be found semester by semester in the Schedule of Courses or on the John Abbott College web- site. Such courses can be taken as the student's General Education requirements, as well as within their program of study. The Certificate will be granted upon graduation. For more information, please contact Doris Miller, Coordinator of Environmental Studies, local 5167, or email: envirostudies@johnabbott.qc.ca CERTIFICATES Certificates can be earned with any regular DEC, without extra courses or workload. They allow students to focus on and explore topics of interest to them within “clusters” of courses. Certificates are the most self-directed learning option a student can register for at John Abbott, and they are accompanied by extra-curricular opportunities as well as academic rewards. CERTIFICATES\n\n8. 8 PEACE STUDIES Peace is multi-layered and multi-faceted. It is non-vio- lence in thought, word and act; it is radical and reac- tionary, personal and political. It is urgent. As we attend to ourselves and personal interactions we reflect global problems. The Peace Studies Certificate brings together college courses which inform students about world issues and their impacts on our personal lives. It works to empower them to take action on their own, to allow them to state clearly, “Peace matters.” We are all involved in the exploitation and distribution of resources and services, and need to be aware of what our choices as consumers and civilians entail. The potential for widespread conflict is great in the interplay of global trade, consumption and aid. War is one of the least sus- tainable activities on earth, yet conflicts of ideology can result in violent confrontations bringing incalculable immediate and long-term human tragedy. Absolutism, the belief in the superiority of one set of ideas over all others, often the refuge of the powerless and sometimes the smokescreen of the powerful, charts a course towards conflict and interference in the autonomy of others. Charters, Conventions, pressure groups, individuals and international institutions attempt to define peace. The UN and the International Court of Justice are key institu- tions. Organizations of civil society struggle to help achieve goals of social and economic justice, human rights, education, health, environmental responsibility and peace, while others work in the opposite direction toward maximum exploitation and consumption. In Canada there is a project to develop a federal Department of Peace, and many initiatives responding to the UN millennium call for a culture of peace through peace education. John Abbott is a pioneer in peace teaching: the Peace Certificate is over 30 years old, the oldest in the country. The Peace Studies Certificate helps individuals to unfold their own courses toward peace and deal with the reper- cussions of others’ violence. Students can learn to identi- fy models which promote peace, and move in that direc- tion. To complete the Certificate, register with the cer- tificate co-ordinator, take at least six Peace Studies courses from the Schedule of Classes course list, and undertake a special project, which is a self-designated assignment in one of those courses. The list of eligible courses can also be found on the JAC website: www.johnabbott.qc.ca/student_zone/departments/ peacestudiescertificate/courseofferings These courses can be chosen among the student’s General Education requirements as well as within their program of study. If you wish to learn more about Peace Studies or wish to register as a Peace Studies student, please contact the Peace Studies Coordinator, local 5448, who will help you register for Peace Studies at any time of the year before your final term, and build ideas for your special project. Peacestudies@johnabbott.qc.ca WOMEN’S STUDIES AND GENDER RELATIONS Students involved in deciding upon a career, creating or maintaining a relationship, functioning in a work place, attending classes, or simply receiving messages of the vari- ous mass media can benefit from the awareness that seemingly personal feelings, actions, decisions and prob- lems are subtly influenced by society’s concepts of male and female. The Certificate in Women’s Studies and Gender Relations helps students attain this understanding, work carefully through its implications for their own lives, and thus increase their personal freedom, power, and ful- fillment. By providing a dynamic and comprehensive study of gender issues and women’s accomplishments placed within psychological, social, political, and historical contexts, the courses help students achieve personal growth and they promote their awareness of and partici- pation in social issues and change. Women’s Studies and Gender Relations courses span a wide variety of disciplines and include such offerings as Gender and Communication, Male/Female, Women in Film, Women and Literature, Human Relations, La Condition Féminine, Sociology and Philosophy of Sexuality, Physical Education, and Sociology of Women. Many courses are available for Women’s Studies and Gender Relations credit. This certificate is offered to both female and male students. Students choose a minimum of five specially designated courses. These courses fulfill the requirements of both the student’s diploma and the Women’s Studies and Gender Relations Certificate at the same time, and may also meet the requirements of the Environmental Studies Certificate, and/or the Peace Studies Certificate. For specific course offerings, please consult the Women’s Studies and Gender Relations Certificate course listing in the Schedule of Classes. For more information, please contact the Co-ordinator for Women’s Studies and Gender Relations, at feminism@johnabbott.qc.ca .\n\n9. 9 PRE-UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS / OPTIONS and PROFILES PROGRAM NAMES SPECIFIC PREREQUISITES PROGRAMS OFFERED AND ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 200.12 Science and Social Science – Double-DEC Math 536 70% Physics 534 70% Chemistry 534 70% 700.B0 Liberal Arts No specific prerequisites 510.A0 Fine Arts No specific prerequisites 500.67 Creative Arts Literature & Languages Theatre Profile No specific prerequisites 500.48 Creative Arts, Literature & Languages Arts and Culture with Languages Profile No specific prerequisites 500.57 Creative Arts, Literature & Languages Languages Option No specific prerequisites 500.47 Creative Arts, Literature & Languages Arts and Culture Profile No specific prerequisites 500.27 Creative Arts, Literature & Languages Media Arts Profile No specific prerequisites 300.A2 Commerce Profile Math 526 or 536 300.A1 Social Science with Math Profile Math 526 or 536 300.A0 Social Science No specific prerequisites 200.B0 Science Math 536 70% Physics 534 70% Chemistry 534 70% PROGRAMSOFFEREDANDENTRANCEREQUIREMENTS 700.A0 Arts and Sciences Math 536 70% Physics 534 70% Chemistry 534 70% PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS and OPTIONS CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE\n\n10. 10 TRANSITION PROGRAM 081.03 The Transition Program is a one-semester program designed to give students an opportunity to pick up missing prerequisites to enter a selected program.

PRE-UNIVERSITY PROGRAM STRUCTURE Each pre-university program is made up of two components: GENERAL EDUCATION and CONCENTRATION courses. (Note: The Liberal Arts Program and Arts and Sciences does not have any complementary courses.) Please refer to the Diploma Requirement charts on the following pages to determine the diploma requirements for your program. GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS GENERAL EDUCATION The compulsory subjects common to all CEGEP programs are English, French, Humanities, Physical Education and complementary. These subjects are referred to as GENERAL EDUCATION courses. General Education requirements are as follows: English (four courses); French (two courses); Humanities (three courses); Physical Education (three courses). The courses and requirements are listed in the course description section of the Calendar. Complementary courses, which also make up a part of the General Education requirements, provide an opportunity for students to explore subjects outside their field of concentration. For example, Science students may choose a Film course. CONCENTRATION COURSES Concentration courses are those courses which are directly related to your field of study. In the Science, Social Science, Creative Arts, Literature and Languages and Liberal Arts programs, the concentration component of the program is made up of both compulsory and optional credits. The Fine Arts Program is composed of compulsory concentration courses only. Please refer to the Diploma Requirement charts on the following pages for more details. COURSE TITLES AND NUMBERS Every course in the Course Description section of the Calendar is identified with a number, title and ponderation. For example: PONDERATION Ponderation specifies the weekly learning activities of the course. In the above example, ponderation is listed as: HOW TO CALCULATE CREDIT VALUE A credit is equal to three hours of learning activities (teaching, laboratory, stage or workshop and homework) per week. Credits for every course are determined by adding the total number of hours in the ponderation and dividing by three. For example: 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 hours ÷ 3 = 2-2/3 credits Understanding the pre-university program structure while trying to choose courses can be confusing. Academic Advisors are available throughout the year to provide assistance with course selection and diploma requirements. Make an appointment well before registration by dropping in to Herzberg, Room 148 or by calling, local 5290.

The Science Program at John Abbott College provides a solid grounding in mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology and geology. The approach is competency-based and interdisciplinary, emphasizing the ways in which scientific problem-solving techniques can be applied to many other disciplines. It prepares students for a number of university science and professional programs. Students select their option courses according to their intention to enter either a Pure and Applied or Health Science program at university. Admission into the program requires a strong overall average and a minimum of 70% in the prerequisite courses, Math 536, Chemistry 534 and Physics 534. The John Abbott College Science Program graduate masters the knowledge and skills of a basic general education as detailed in the objectives of the General Education courses. The goals of general education are to provide students with a common cultural core, to help them acquire and develop generic skills and to foster desirable attitudes. As well, gradu- ates master the knowledge and skills of a basic scientific education as listed in the outcomes below. The program is organized according to objectives to be attained in each course. The following is a list of the Ministerial program objectives linked with Science courses. • To analyze the organization, functioning and diversity of living beings. • To analyze chemical and physical changes in matter using concepts associated with the structure of atoms and mole- cules. • To analyze the properties of solutions and reactions in solutions. • To apply the methods of differential calculus to the study of functions and problem solving. • To apply the methods of integral calculus to the study of functions and problem solving. • To apply the methods of linear algebra and vector geometry to problem solving. • To analyze various situations and phenomena in physics using the basic principles of classical mechanics. • To analyze various situations and phenomena in physics using the basic laws of electricity and magnetism. • To analyze various situations or phenomena associated with waves, optics and modern physics using basic principles. • To apply acquired knowledge to one or more subjects in the sciences. • To apply the experimental method in a scientific field. • (Optional) To analyze the structure and functioning of multi-celled organisms in terms of homeostasis and from an evolutionary perspective. • (Optional) To solve simple problems in organic chemistry. Agriculture Architecture Astronomy Biology Biochemistry Chemistry Computer Science Dentistry Dietetics Education Engineering Environmental Science Forestry Geology Mathematics Medicine Nursing Nutrition Occupational Therapy Optometry Pharmacy Physical Education Physics Physiotherapy Veterinary Medicine Graduates from the Science Program may pursue further studies at university in: PRE-UNIVERSITYPROGRAMS\n\n18. 18 COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT AND INTEGRATION IN THE SCIENCE PROGRAM The Ministry of Education requires every student to pass a “program comprehensive assessment” and a program “inte- grating activity” (Exit Profile Competency 14: “to apply what has been learned to new situations” and Ministry objective 00UU: “To apply acquired knowledge to one or more sub- jects in the sciences”). The Ministry introduced these requirements because it recognized the importance of con- necting the various components within each program. Rather than impose a major exam or paper at the end of the program, or requiring a single course to fulfill these requirements, John Abbott College has integrated them into the ‘option’ courses taken late in the program. These cours- es have been designed so that by passing any three option courses a student will have met the above requirements of the program. The various competencies taught and assessed in the Science Program are outlined in the outcomes and stan- dards of the Science Program Exit Profile and listed below. They are divided into two groups: those competencies that are taught and assessed in virtually every course in the pro- gram, and those that will be the primary focus of the option courses. It is recognized, of course, that many of the former will also be included in the option courses. The following competencies are taught and assessed in most courses of the program: 3. To Apply (the) a scientific method. 4. To Apply a systematic approach to problem solving. 5. To Use appropriate data processing techniques. 6. To reason with rigour, i.e. with precision. 8. To learn in an autonomous manner. 13. To display attitudes and behaviour compatible with the scientific spirit and method. The following competencies will be the special focus of the option courses of the program: 7. To communicate effectively. 9. To work as a member of a team. 10. To recognize the links between science, technology and the evolution of society. 11. To develop a personal system of values. 12. To put into context the emergence and development of scientific concepts. 14. To apply what has been learned to new situations. Most, though not all, of these six competencies will be addressed in each option course. The requirement is that a combination of any three option courses will address them all. It is the responsibility of the Science Program that this requirement be met. Each option course will clearly state in its course outline which competencies are to be taught and how they are to be assessed. To prepare the student for formal assessment of the compe- tencies assigned to the option courses, these competencies will be introduced in the compulsory courses of the program according to the following grid: GRID OF COMPETENCIES TAUGHT AND ASSESSED IN COMPULSORY COURSES NNoottee:: 7a Written communication (reading/writing scientific material) 7b Oral communication of scientific material In these courses, the assigned competencies will be taught and assessed a grade as part of the course grade, but this grade will not be part of the formal assessment of the com- petency. The course outline for each of these courses will clearly outline how the competency is to be taught and assessed. HONOURS SCIENCE (200.16) The Honours Science Certificate program is designed for students interested in pursuing science-related careers and it focuses on interdisciplinary learning and student develop- ment. In their first year, Honours students take their required science courses as a group and share a common meeting time for science-related field trips and invited speakers. They also work on individual and team projects. To be considered for Honours Science, students must graduate from high school with an overall grade average of 85% or higher, and minimum marks of 80% in chemistry, mathematics and physics. In addition to the SRAM application, students must also submit a separate written application to Honours Science. For further information about John Abbott’s Honours Science program, please contact the John Abbott College Admissions Office, local 5355, 5361 or 5358; or the Honours Science Coordinator at: honours.science@johnab- bott.qc.ca.

ANTHROPOLOGY INTRODUCTION TO ANTHROPOLOGY 381-100-AB (3.0.3) Anthropology is the study of all aspects of human life from the distant past to the present and throughout all areas of the world. In this course you will be introduced to the methods and concepts of physical anthropolo- gy, archaeology, and cultural anthro- pology. Through lectures and labs you will learn about human evolution, the prehistory and history of ancient civi- lizations, and the diversity of cultures in the world today. This introductory course will provide you with general knowledge of anthropology as well as prepare you for more specialized courses in the field. FIRST CIVILIZATIONS 381-250-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Archaeology as a sub-dis- cipline of Anthropology and will learn about the transition from hunting- gathering to food production. The development of early civilizations in both the Old and New Worlds will be examined through a variety of case studies from Mesopotamia, Asia, Africa, Mesoamerica, and South America. Topics to be covered in this course will include the economic bases of early civilizations, the role of religion in early civilizations, the development of social stratification, and monumental architecture and art. PEOPLES OF THE WORLD 381-251-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Cultural Anthropology and of the diversity of cultures in the world. Studying others encourages us to look more critically at ourselves. In this way, cultures come to serve as mirrors in which we can perceive our own images, past and present. This, in turn, should foster critical thinking and a broader understanding of our- selves and the world we live in. Selected cultures from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and elsewhere will be used as case studies illustrating field- work techniques, aspects of culture, and adaptation. Topics to be covered in the course will include adaptation, exchange and economic systems, domestic life, gender, anthropology and the modern world, and selected aspects of culture theory. HUMAN EVOLUTION 381-252-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Physical Anthropology as a sub-discipline of Anthropology and will learn about human evolution from the early Primates through to modern Homo sapiens as well as about contemporary human biologi- cal diversity. Topics to be covered include mechanisms of evolution, Primates and Primate behaviour, the Australopithecines, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, the Neanderthals, early modern Homo sapiens, contem- porary human diversity, and the con- cept of race. RACE AND RACISM 381-253-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Anthropology as these address the concept of race and the sociocultural phenomenon of racism. We will look at the history and usage of the concept of race since it first came to prominence in the 18th cen- tury and how it is linked to the devel- opment of systems of racial stratification. The course has a theo- retical as well as a vital personal dimension: as we seek to understand the social meaning of race and racism we want to continually examine and reassess our own beliefs. Topics to be considered in this course include the Anthropological perspective on race relations, the contemporary Anthropological critique of traditional racial classifications, explanations of contemporary variation, case studies (including South Africa under Apartheid, Nazi Germany and Canada) to help explain the historical, social, economic, and political forces that create and sustain racism, and concepts of ethnicity, prejudice, stereotype, discrimination, and the multiple forms that racism takes. AMERINDIANS 381-254-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Cultural Anthropology and Archaeology in the study of Native Americans. This course will give students a better understanding of the history and contemporary sta- tus of aboriginal cultures. Topics to considered include the earliest peo- pling of the Americas, the cultural prehistory of North America, the diversity of cultures during the colo- nial period, the effects of coloniza- tion, and the contemporary issues facing Canadian Indians and Inuit. ANTHROPOLOGY AND CONTEMPORARY ISSUES 381-255-AB (3.0.3) P: 381-100-AB In this course, students will further their knowledge of the methods and concepts of Anthropology in the study of a variety of contemporary issues. The course may address a different issue whenever it is offered. Topics which may be considered in this course include human sexuality in cross-cultural perspective, the anthro- pology of war and peace, and com- parative religion, among others. The specific description of the course will be available from the department each time the course is scheduled. NNoottee:: Some Anthropology courses are offered as complimentary courses. Consult the complimentary course section of the course calendar for a list of available courses. BIOLOGY HUMAN BIOLOGY 101-901-RE (2.1.3) Human Biology is a concentration course for Social Science students in the psychology profile. Focusing on cell physiology, human reproduction genetics and on the regulation of homeostasis by the nervous and endocrine systems, this course offers an opportunity to develop an under- standing of the biological concepts which play an important role in human behaviour. 32"
