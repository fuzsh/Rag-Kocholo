        "text": "DRUMMONDS, Tenn. (WMC) - A support group in Collierville had a surprise for a man who put his life on the line for our country. 101-year-old John Abbott is a WWII veteran who lives in Tipton County and had damage to his roof after storms this past winter, so the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association stepped up to fix up his house all for free.\n\n“It wasn’t leaking but in one place, but you could see the rest of it was getting old, you know,” Abbott said.\n\nAbbott moves well for 101; he mows his lawn, lives by himself, but obviously can’t replace his own roof. Jason Franklin with the CVMA said they were able to bring in contractors from all over to help rebuild the roof.\n\n“It is beyond awesome, and it is hard to put into words and it shows the testament of who are as a society and what we do to help veterans and what we do as an organization,” Franklin said.\n\nAs the work started, Abbott said if he could, he would be jumping for joy.\n\n“If I had been in a jumping position, I would have jumped around three feet high. I was excited, and man I did not have any idea they were going to make this thing this big,” Abbott said.\n\nFranklin said one of the toughest parts of their job is finding these vets who need the help, and that this is just the beginning.\n\n“Right here when we get Mr. Abbott taken care of, we will move on to our next veteran in need and we will put all of our focus and efforts into helping the next veteran,” Franklin said.\n\nClick here to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nClick here to report a spelling or grammar error.
