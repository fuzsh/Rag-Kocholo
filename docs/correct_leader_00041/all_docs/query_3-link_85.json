        "text": "The Texas governor was joined by his counterpart from Oklahoma were they met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott arrived in Israel early Thursday where he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed support for the country's battle with Hamas that began with the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\"There is a deep, enduring bond between Texas and Israel, with the blessings of freedom and burdens of vigilance embedded in the histories of both our people,\" Abbott said in a statement from his office. \"Unfortunately, never has freedom in Israel been more threatened than it is right now — and the people of Israel are vigorously fighting to defend it.\"\n\nThis marks the three-term Republican's third visit to Israel since he took office in 2015. The trip, taken with Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, was intended to be kept under wraps but was reported by the Austin American-Statesman and the Daily Oklahoman, of the USA TODAY Network, on Tuesday. It was billed as a gesture of \"Texas’ enduring and unwavering support\" for one of the United States' closest allies.\n\nAbbott's office said the visit will be brief, but the governors were planning to tour Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, where they will meet with people injured in the attacks and confer with Israeli officials. This trip was made in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel and the Consulate General of Israel to the Southwest.\n\nStitt's spokesperson Abegail Cave said the trip is \"an opportunity to discuss future partnerships between Israel and our states as they rebuild.\" Abbott and Stitt also plan to meet with Israeli President Herzog and Foreign Minister Cohen, she said.\n\nAbbott's office also released photographs taken Wednesday with he, Stitt and Netanyahu.\n\nMore: Dozens killed in Israeli airstrike on Gaza refugee camp, including Hamas commander: Updates\n\n\"I look forward to gaining a deeper understanding of this horrific war and how we can continue to help Israel safeguard their freedom during this trip. Texas stands ready to offer our complete and total support to Israel in their fight against brutal terrorist organizations like Hamas,\" Abbott said in the news release from his office.\n\nThe governors' trip comes as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza intensified and the war’s death toll reported by Palestinian and Israeli authorities climbed above 10,000. USA TODAY on Wednesday reported that Israeli airstrikes pounded the Jabaliya refugee camp for the second day in a row and killed a key Hamas figure, while ground troops engaged in heavy fighting with militants in several locations.\n\nHamas’ armed wing posted video purporting to show its fighters emerging from tunnels and firing rockets at Israeli tanks east of Gaza City.\n\nThis is a developing report. Please check back for updates."
