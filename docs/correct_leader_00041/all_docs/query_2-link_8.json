In 2016 I moved to Tuscaloosa and joined the UA Museums team as the Director of Museum Research and Collections. My research career has focused around many aspects of entomology from the ecology of stoneflies to endangered beetles. My current interests include the biogeography, systematics, and conservation of dragonflies and damselflies throughout the New World. I have incorporated citizen science and crowd-sourcing initiatives as a way to help collect data on a variety of odonate topics from presence/absence of species to trying to unravel the mysteries of dragonfly migration.Some of my current projects include the conservation of two rare southeastern dragonflies using population genetics, conserving the endangered American Burying Beetle (Nicrophorus americanus) by understanding its environmental constraints, using citizen science to promote education and generate otherwise unobtainable datasets, writing a field guide to the Common Insects of Texas, and creating a new Peterson Field to the Insects of North America. I serve as Editor-in-Chief for the International Journal of Odonatology and Associate Editor for Odonatologica. I enjoy engaging with others about nature and the topics in science that excite me. My wife and I are involved in numerous outreach activities and are nature photographers as well.
