        "text": "On April 17, 1974, the Central Identification LaboratoryÂ–Thailand (CILT, now DPAA) identified the remains of Captain John Abbott, missing from the Vietnam War.\n\nCaptain Abbott entered the U.S. Navy from California and was a member of Light Attack Squadron 113, Carrier Air Wing 11. On April 20, 1966, he piloted an A-4 Skyhawk (bureau number unknown) that took off from the USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) on a mission over North Vietnam. During the mission, he was hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire while over the Song Ca River, just northwest of Vinh. The aircraft's wing caught fire and CAPT Abbott was forced to eject; he was taken as a prisoner of war and died in enemy captivity on April 27. The Vietnamese government later handed over his remains to U.S. custody."
