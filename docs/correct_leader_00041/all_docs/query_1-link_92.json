        "text": "NO, McGill is not the only English speaking university where you can do your undergrad in the province of Quebec.\n\nThere is Bishop's University in the Eastern Townships and there is Concordia University, downtown Montreal, a walk to McGill and with their beautiful Loyola campus in N.D.G., a lovely resdiential part of Montreal.\n\nMany premeds select the university where they take thier UG based upon what is perceived to be the best, our Ivy Leagues, where they have bragging rights b/c of prestige and reputation. However, the reputation is not based upon undergrad, and you face a highly competive situation where the cream of the crop go. So, it is only natural that they are not only highly competitive but that 50% are in the botom half of the class. However, if you go toa smaller or lesser known, a so-called no-name university, there is less competition and provided you are prepared to work hard, you can do much better than at McGill for the same effort. And to get into med school, GPA is king.\n\nIf you are born in Quebec, you are good to go and Cegep and a Quebec university is the way to go into medicine. FFirstly, you have a shot of getting into med-pre directly from Cegep. Additionally, as a Quebec resident who obtains her bachelor's degree from a Quebec university, McGill does not require writing the MCAT. THirdly, as a Quebec resident, you take advantage of the IP (In Province) pool, and you have an amazing shot @ McGill.\n\nAnd as regards the French speaking med schools, you can apply. However, you will need to write their French exam and do well in order to be entitled to an interview if you are selected. And it would be wise for you to look up this teest, gather all the information possible about and see where you are in terms of being able to do well. If you need tutoring, then get it b/c if you are accepted fro an interview when in 2nd year Cegep, you will need to write the test and you want to be ready.\n\nYou can and may well decide to write the MCAT say during the summer after you complete 2 years of UG. This will potnetially allow you to widen the net to apply to med schools across Canada. You will do your prerequisites for the Quebec med schools in Cegep by entering the health sciences stream. And there are other courses to take so that you can apply to U/Ottawa (that does not rerquire MCAT), Alberta, UBC ,etc such as statistics and chem courses, including organic. In due courses, you will do your own research for each med school across Canada so that you can take the courses they require and be able to apply across Canada.\n\nYour decision to come to Quebec is wise not only in terms of finance but in terms of plann ig out a future. And, of course, you need a Plan B, b/c so many excellent candidates are routinely not accepted - and you need to be ready for another career. Luck plays a critical role in the process."
