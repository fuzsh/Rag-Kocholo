        "text": "By Michael Baadke\n\nCanada’s fourth prime minister, Sir John Joseph Caldwell Abbott, was born March 12, 1821, at St. Andrews East, Lower Canada (now Quebec). He studied law at University of McGill College and became an authority on commercial law.\n\nAbbott had a successful practice in Montreal and taught law at McGill for many years, also serving as dean of the law faculty.\n\nAbbott was elected to the legislative assembly of the province of Canada in 1857, though a dispute over the election took two years to resolve. He would later serve as attorney general, mayor of Montreal, and in the House of Commons.\n\nConnect with Linn's Stamp News:\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nKeep up with us on Instagram\n\nHe was a Conservative Party member of the Senate when Prime Minister John A. MacDonald died 1891, and Abbott was chosen to succeed him.\n\nHe served in the office for less than a year and half before stepping down for health reasons. He died Oct. 30, 1893.\n\nSir John J.C. Abbott was honored on a 3¢ rose lilac stamp issued Nov. 3, 1952 (Canada Scott 318)."
