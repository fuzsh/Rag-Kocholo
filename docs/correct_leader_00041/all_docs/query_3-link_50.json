        "text": "Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) first took shape at the conference called by President Roosevelt at Hot Springs, Virginia, 18 May to 3 June 1943. Chinaâ€™s re-joining of FAO in 1973 was a major event for the organization. Since 1978 FAO has had its own Technical Cooperation Programme. The governing bodies of FAO are its Conference of member governments which meets every second year and its Council of forty-nine government representatives selected regionally. The Development Department is responsible for the FAO country representatives and the preparation or review of technical assistance or investment projects. The Administration and Finance Department manages the finances of the FAO, recruits and terminates staff, determines their allowances, and pays them. A handicap for FAO in mobilizing the full weight of the developing countries behind the conquest of hunger has been that it addressed only their ministers of agriculture."
