        "text": "At the time, Canada did not exist yet as a country. The provinces were separate territories ruled by Great Britain. Each of these had its own legislature, and Abbott was elected to the legislature of the Province of Canada in 1857. The Province of Canada included what are now Ontario and Quebec. In 1867 that province was combined with two others to form the Dominion of Canada. The process was known as Confederation. After Confederation Abbott served in the House of Commons for the Dominion for many years.\n\nAbbott was also a businessman. He was involved with several railroads, including the Canadian Pacific Railway. When the railway became the center of a scandal in 1873, however, Abbott was connected with the scandal. He lost his seat in the House of Commons in 1874 as a result. Seven years later he was elected again. In 1887 he was appointed to the Senate."
