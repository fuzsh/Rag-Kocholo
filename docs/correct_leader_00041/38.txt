The third Prime Minister of Canada was John Abbott. A man who didn’t even like politics, he took over the leadership when Sir John A. died during his time in office.

Although there isn’t a lot of information about him, he appears to have been a strong leader who managed to pull together a country that still wasn’t completely settled.

His term only lasted 17 months, when he resigned due to failing health.
