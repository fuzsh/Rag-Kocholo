        "text": ".\n\n15 hours 45 minutes 26 seconds. This is the piece of information that better describes the Halloween 77 Costume Box Set that celebrates the concert run’s 40th anniversary.\n\nIt is a six full blown shows long journey through material that Zappa condensed in Sheik Yerbouti (with overdubs) and Baby Snakes, and that has been scattered somewhere else (namely YCDTOSA 6 and Trance-Fusion, with its special case Bowling on Charen).\n\nAudio quality is excellent and derives from 24-bit WAV audio files carried by a candy bar-shaped USB drive in punky yellow (consider the use of an appropriate external Digital/Analog Converter for your hi-fi set). Patrick O’Hearn is particularly clear on these recordings.\n\n.\n\nAfter a first show by show listen, that demands some planning (if you can, think about three hours sessions, 6 of them), it could be convenient to focus on the material, that of course has some redundancy.\n\nSince time is still of affliction nowadays, it could be useful to go straight to the crux of the biscuit when you do not have a three hour space available.\n\nThe set lists of the first four shows (an average length of 2:20, 2 each day, October 28th and 29th) are quite similar, while for the October 30th and 31st Zappa delivered three hours programs with some special treats. 158 tracks, 25 songs (including 3 “audience episodes”) played 5 or 6 times, 11 songs (2 “audience episodes”) performed once or twice on the 30th and the 31st only.\n\n.\n\nThe 11 songs set is 1h17min long, it can be easily managed. Here it is (in brackets: sum of the durations, number of performances):\n\nA Halloween Treat with Thomas Nordegg (06:17; 1)\n\nBlack Napkins (09:19; 1)\n\nDancin’ Fool (World Premiere) (04:50; 1)\n\nDirty Love (02:32; 1)\n\nI Have Been In You (08:35; 1)\n\nJewish Princess (Prototype) (04:41; 1)\n\nKing Kong (08:45; 1)\n\nSan Ber’ dino (11:21; 2)\n\nStink-Foot (07:45; 1)\n\nThe Demise Of The Imported Rubber Goods Mask (08:33; 1)\n\nThe Poodle Lecture (05:10; 1)\n\nThe first one is a stage number featuring Roy Estrada, Peter Wolf and Thomas Nordegg, the Austrian guitar tech, video cameraman and personal acquaintance of Peter Wolf that was in the Zappa crew for a long time. For recollected memories of the episode, refer to ZappaCast Episode 34 (A Halloween Treat with Thomas Nordegg!).\n\nIn this ZAPPAWEEN Podcast Scott Parker interviews Joe Travers and Thomas Nordegg around the subject of this release, and gives a preview of the NYC Palladium Halloween concerts.\n\nAs for some of the other items on this 11 songs list: Black Napkins is the movie version; Dirty Love features a short Belew solo; I Have Been In You includes Is That Guy Kidding or What? (YCDTOSA 6); for King Kong there is room for Phil Kaufman (the road manager) as human trombone and for Roy Estrada with his Gas Mask (solos: Mann and Mars); Stink Foot takes in a short FZ solo; The Demise Of The Imported Rubber Goods Mask, a Roy Estrada stage feature; The Poodle Lecture has been previously released on YCDTOSA 6.\n\n.\n\nThe 25 songs set is 14 hours and half long, you need some criteria to go through it.\n\nFor my convenience I have further divided those 25 songs set into two different groups, those which take in some improvisation (9 numbers that you may want to focus on), and those that deliver more or less a standard version or a routine (that you eventually will listen to in complete show sessions). Here is the first group (in brackets: sum of the durations, number of performances; in order of duration):\n\nLather (22:39; 6)\n\nTerry’s Solo (26:42; 6)\n\nMuffin Man (32:46; 6)\n\nConehead (Instrumental) (39:17; 5)\n\nCity Of Tiny Lites (44:13; 6)\n\nPound For A Brown (58:38; 6)\n\nPunky’ s Whips (1h:02:27; 6)\n\nThe Torture Never Stops (1h:16:54; 6)\n\nWild Love (2h:36:00; 6)\n\nThis group is 8 hours and 40 minutes long, and probably most of the crux of the biscuit is here.\n\nLather is in this group even though it includes a very short FZ solo. However it is the first officially released version after the original, most probably you will go for it often. Also, it features a different coda if confronted with the Zappa in NY original.\n\nTerry Bozzio solos are always worth a listen, and these 6 are no exception. In the economy of the Palladium shows they do function as Terry’s Firma does in Hammersmith Odeon, which presents live recordings captured few months later in the same tour (Jan-Feb 1978). The structure of these solo has been very well synthesized by zappateer pbuzby:\n\nBozzio’s solos from fall 77/winter 78 were similar from show to show as well, always with the Syndrum bit, the bit where he plays phrases on the toms and then the same phrases on the double bass drums, and the closing explosive cymbal crash bit. Kind of a composed piece with some varied bits rather than the entirely improvised solos FZ played.\n\nAs for Muffin Man, every hard-core maniac knows all about that, and if he wants more, well here is more!\n\nConehead enters in the Zappa repertoire in late ’77 as an instrumental from 6 to 9 minutes long, a number much different than the song with lyrics as has been performed from late ’78 on. In its early stage, it works as a vehicle for a Zappa guitar solo, the main theme can be also heard during the Baby Snakes movie (namely Conehead/”All You Need To Know”, as featured in AAAFNRAA – Baby Snakes – The Compleat Soundtrack), however this version has been released in Halloween 77 for the first time in its complete form. And these five Zappa solos are great guitar time (Conehead is out in the October 30th setlist). On a steady rhythmic pulse, FZ builds his improvisation as an instant composition, a musical event where there is nor before neither after (note how these solos sort of abruptly finish). As remarked by Brett Clement: “Zappa’s solos seem often to begin “in the middle,” and, even more importantly, their endings are often heard as arbitrary” (from “A Study of the Instrumental Music of Frank Zappa”, see also “In control of garlic, moment to moment“).\n\nFor City Of Tiny Lites I would like to quote Foggy G, “The Songs That Were Played,” We’re Only In It For The Touring.\n\nFrank’s solos were usually a bit longer than the one we have on SY, but they were not yet quite the tour-de-force solos that this tune would deliver on later tours. Note the written guitar part to close the solo section, and the little piano break before the return to vocals—two aspects of this song that would disappear in the ’80’s.\n\nShort solos (1 to 3 minutes) with great moments of Bozzio-Zappa interplay (go for 28 show 2 and Halloween, the most long).\n\nPound For A Brown works as an improvisation vehicle for Patrick O’Hearn, Tommy Mars and Peter Wolf. Bass solos feature a tight interplay between O’Hearn and Bozzio who sometimes recalls some The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution workouts. Also, O’Hearn occasionally quotes rock classics, such as Aerosmith Walk This Way on Oct 29, second show (shortly thereafter Mars quotes Inca Roads). Notably, Mars improvisations are often enriched by his typical scats. And the short rhythm guitar preamble to the solo section is also to be noted.\n\nTorture is a special case. In spite of the fact that the song is richly documented throughout the discography/filmography, these 6 versions are a must. FZ did like the song and published a lot of live versions covering all the touring bands (sometimes as solos on guitar albums, or as improvised sections on the YCDTOSA series), and so did ZFT who added some relevant episodes. For a full list please refer to and remain impressed at IINK. The Halloween 77 band already had three entries in this list (the ’78 versions: SY (as Rat Tomago), YCDTOSA 1, Hammersmith Odeon) however the structure of these 6 late ’77 solos is slightly different: FZ starts slowly then the tension gradually rises, and 2 or 3 minutes later the listener loses the sense of time: again, before and after make no sense anymore. For the Halloween solo, FZ delivers a shorter slow preamble, then he enters in the timeless realm of his improvisation. Instead, in the released ’78 solos he enters straight (no chaser) to the timeless point. A perfect example of such a thing is Rat Tomago, a solo that has been slightly edited to increase the effect.\n\nOh, by the way, did you know that Rat Tomago was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1979?\n\nBack to October 1977 Tortures there is one last tiny detail to be pointed out: this is the last version that does not include a quote of Chattanooga Choo Choo that was used by FZ in Torture from the beginning of 1978 onward (at 3:20 in the Hammersmith Odeon version). For this tortured matter, the cleaner the better to me. And if after these 6 versions you need more, here is more: 30 The Torture Never Stops live guitar solos (1976-1988).\n\n.\n\nPunky’s Whips is the Bozzio vocals/drums showcase to be fully enjoyed in its visual movie epitome. Punky is in this list because of the final short FZ solo, less than 2 minutes for the first 4 shows, a little bit longer for last two. The hard way, as expected.\n\nWild Love, 6 performances, an average of 25 minutes each, with a special 30 minutes Halloween number. Solos for everyone but Bozzio, the Zappa workout being known as Bowling on Charen (Trance-Fusion) which is an edited version of the October 28th early show solo. For a piece previously unreleased in this monstre form, the complete Halloween 77 set let the listener know a lot about it and brings 5 different unreleased takes of Bowling on Charen. These solos, the solos to Torture and Conehead probably are most of the crux of the Halloween 77 biscuit, or of the Oh Punky USB stick! Three more facts to be reported here: Wild Love shares its coda with Lather (it is the same previously unreleased short piece of music); on October 31st FZ delivers a different finale as a further guitar solo; as noted by zappateer pbuzby “in 10/28 show #2 Wild Love, they sing the second verse (“Mama stroked his dinger…“) twice”, “it seems like an editing mistake“.\n\nFor a sample of the 9 numbers just described, refer to the above mentioned ZappaCast Episode 34 (direct link below).\n\nhttps://www.podcastgarden.com/login/audio-13/13900/Episode34FINAL.mp3\n\n.\n\nNamely: The Torture Never Stops (October 29th early, starts at 00:35:47), Lather (October 28th late, 00:56:33), Conehead (October 28th late, 01:07:02).\n\nTo complete the USB stick program, the last group of songs (standards/routines, 5h 48 min) is to be mentioned (in brackets: sum of the durations, number of performances; in order of duration):\n\nBig Leg Emma (09:14; 5)\n\nEncore Audience (11:01; 6)\n\nEnvelopes (15:20; 6)\n\nPeaches En Regalia (16:10; 6)\n\nJones Crusher (17:19; 6)\n\nThe Black Page #2 (18:12; 6)\n\nFlakes (18:38; 5)\n\nStart/Introductions (19:59; 6)\n\nCamarillo Brillo (21:01; 6)\n\nTryin’ To Grow A Chin (21:31; 6)\n\nBroken Hearts Are For Assholes (23:08; 6)\n\nDisco Boy (23:34; 6)\n\nAudience Participation (26:41; 6)\n\nBobby Brown Goes Down (29:16; 5)\n\nDinah-Moe Humm (33:14; 6)\n\nTitties ‘N’ Beer (43:44; 6)\n\nWith the exception of Big Leg Emma (and counting out the audience interaction tracks), these songs are already available through Hammersmith Odeon exactly in the same versions. No great news here, even though the intros to Bobby Brown are to be mentioned: they all include variations on a story about “three assholes” (but also “crumpet munchers”) that wanted to interview Frank and brought their girlfriend along to impress them, letting them know that they were into the Woman Liberation Movement. Zappa acid Fun!\n\nAlso to be mentioned is this version of Envelopes with Tommy Mars on vocals, released for the second time here after Hammersmith Odeon.\n\nThe USB stick includes also a “28-page digital booklet featuring never-before-seen photos and liner notes from Vaultmeister Joe Travers, co-producer of the box alongside Ahmet Zappa, and personal firsthand accounts from many of Zappa’s bandmates, crew and fans who were there, including guitarist Adrian Belew, percussionist Ed Mann, keyboard tech Thomas Nordegg, tour manager Phil Kaufman, and fan Janet “The Planet” Walley (from zappa.com, “keyboard tech” should be probably corrected in “guitar tech”).\n\nAnd of course the box set also include the FZ Halloween mask & costume, an artwork by David Calcano of Fantoons, who also contributed to the illustration of the cover of The Crux Of The Biscuit: An Fz Audio Documentary Project/Object.\n\n.\n\nIf you are not willing to deal with this more than 15 hours audio trip, you may want to go for the 3 cd reduction (3h28min), that consists of the October 31st complete concert plus a few bonus tracks from the 30th (King Kong, A Halloween Treat With Thomas Nordegg, Audience Participation #5, The Black Page #2). If you already know Hammersmith Odeon, such a choice would bring you Wild Love and Conehead as main news, on the other hand if you don’t know both and you want to choose one only, I would go for Halloween 77, it is the same band but the program is slightly more interesting. However, with such “physical” options you are going to miss the big amount of the assorted improvisations included in the 8 hours and 40 minutes 9 songs group outlined above, and a chance to immerse yourself in a memorable Zappa Halloween week.\n\n.\n\nFor detailed images of the Costume Box Set, refer to kompaktkiste.de.\n\nFinally, for really obsessed hard-core fanatics, click HERE to get the Excel file used to sum Halloween 77 durations.\n\n.\n\nA late November update\n\nOn November 21st 2017 Zappa Records confirmed through zappa.com that the track Wild Love from Show 2, 10-28-77 has an error. Zappa Records lets acquirers of Halloween 77 Box Set download the correct track if they send an email with a picture of of the box number (those who purchased the box through the zappa.com store received an email with a download link).\n\nThe corrected track is 24:57 long while the previous one lasts 26:01 (in the latter the band sings the second verse twice, as noted above).\n\n.\n\n.\n\nUncle Meat is a milestone, the landmark where The Mothers of Invention reached the highest point, but also the time when the project termination phase began. This double LP set was recorded between October 1967 and February 1968, it was released on April 1969, the following summer Zappa would have disbanded the MOI.\n\nAfter such recording sessions the MOI become almost only a live band. Of course Zappa used a lot of 68/69 live material to mold two further “posthumous” MOI album, namely Burnt Weeny Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh (and much later, YCDTOSA Vol.5 disc 2 and Ahead of Their Time), however the studio MOI era closed with Uncle Meat, as often with FZ, an unfinished project, since it should have been a movie also (somehow completed almost 20 years later in 1987).\n\nThe “audio vérité” tracks included in the album testify of the economic difficulties of the band that eventually brought his leader to close the project the next year (probably economics was not the only issue, but it was a crucial one). Nevertheless until February 1968 Zappa conceived the MOI as a studio band also.\n\nIn the original liner notes FZ emphasizes on technology and studio procedures he was particularly fond of: Uncle Meat is a peak also as a sonic 60’s object, being a balanced mix of electric and acoustic music, often manipulated in speed and through other electronic filters.\n\n[An extract of the original liner notes as it has been included into the Meat Light booklet, a complete set of images of this new edition of Uncle Meat is available through kompaktkiste.de]\n\nUncle Meat was in fact one of the projects entirely produced at Apostolic Studios (together with Ruben & The Jets), a sonic engine that gave Zappa new opportunities:\n\nBy late 1967, Apostolic Studios had installed a prototype Scully 12-track recorder, and the overdubbing opportunities it afforded, together with a variable-speed oscillator used to modify the machine’s 30 ips tape speed, allowed for the creation of a completely new sound palette.\n\nChris Michie, “We Are The Mothers . . . And This Is What We Sound Like!“, Mix, January 1, 2003\n\nFor a detailed account of those Apostolic times, please refer also to: The story of the recording studio that became Frank Zappa’s New York downtown playground!\n\nPrevious Michie quote and Apostolic link via Uncle Meat notes at IINK, a must to go in deep into the album, which was a seminal one.\n\nIf you look at the track lists of previous MOI albums to pick songs and compositions that would have traveled time and space, you’ll find for sure some (e.g. Trouble Every Day, Brown Shoes Don’t Make It or The Idiot Bastard Son’s), but if you skim the Uncle Meat list you’ll be amazed to find music that participated to essential future FZ projects, such as Hot Rats (Mr. Green Genes) or Yellow Shark (Dog/Meat, Exercise #4, Pound for a Brown). You will also find King Kong, the perfect embodiment of the matter that kept the Project/Object alive for 25 years. Moreover Uncle Meat features Nine Types of Industrial Pollution, one of the first examples of a completely xenochronized piece, and Project X, a composition that would have fit Jazz From Hell too (at least from 1:35 on).\n\nForward to 2016, ZFT released Meat Light, the fifth Project/Object in the series of 40ieth Anniversary Audio Documentaries, the second in 2016, after The Crux Of The Biscuit.\n\nIt’s a 3 cd set, and its main features are:\n\nthe original album restored for the first time on cd to the sonic palette of the ’60s (Original 1969 Vinyl Mix, cd 1)\n\nan early album sequence (Original Sequence, cd 2 and part of cd 3)\n\n20 sessions outtakes (From the Vault, part of cd 3)\n\n.\n\nHere are the main credits from the Meat Light zappa.com page (track list is below the post):\n\nRecording Engineers: Dick Kunc, Jerry Hansen\n\nStudios: Apostolic Studios, NYC; Sunset Sound, Los Angeles\n\nOriginal package designed by Cal Schenkel, NT&B\n\nTHE MOTHERS at the time of this recording were:\n\nFRANK ZAPPA: guitar, low grade vocals, percussion\n\nRAY COLLINS: swell vocals\n\nJIMMY CARL BLACK: drums, droll humor, poverty\n\nROY ESTRADA: electric bass, cheeseburgers, Pachuco falsetto\n\nDON (Dom De Wild) PRESTON: electric piano, tarot cards, brown rice\n\nBILLY (The Oozer) MUNDI: drums on some pieces before he quit to join RHINOCEROS\n\nBUNK (Sweatpants) GARDNER: piccolo, flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, soprano sax, alto sax, tenor sax, bassoon (all of these electric and/or nonelectric depending)\n\nIAN UNDERWOOD: electric organ, piano, harpsichord, celeste, flute, clarinet, alto sax, baritone sax, special assistance, copyist, industrial relations & teen appeal\n\nARTIE (With the Green Mustache) TRIPP: drums, timpani, vibes, marimba, xylophone, wood blocks, bells, small chimes, cheerful outlook & specific enquires\n\nEUCLID JAMES (Motorhead/Motorishi) SHERWOOD: pop star, frenetic tenor sax stylings, tambourine, choreography, obstinance & equipment setter-upper when he’s not hustling local groupies\n\nSpecial Thanks to:\n\nRUTH KOMANOFF who plays marimba and vibes with Artie on many of the tracks,\n\nand\n\nNELCY WALKER the soprano voice with Ray & Roy on Dog Breath & The Uncle Meat Variations.\n\nThe Uncle Meat Project/Object Audio Documentary\n\nCompiled & Produced by Gail Zappa & Joe Travers\n\nMastering:\n\nDisc One – Chris Bellman, Bernie Grundman Mastering 2013\n\nDisc Two & Three – John Polito, Audio Mechanics 2013\n\nCover and Interior Paintings: Theo Holdt\n\nPhotography: Michael Ochs Archive; Additional Photos Courtesy of: The Vault\n\nPackage Design: Michael Mesker\n\nProduction Manager: Melanie Starks\n\nSpecial Thanks: Ahmet & Diva, Holland Greco, Kurt Morgan\n\nVaultmeister Notes:\n\nAll material for this release was taken entirely from 1/4” mono & stereo analog tapes except Disc Three, Track 24, taken from the original 12 track analog master (Mixed by Joe Travers, UMRK 2013). All transfers by Joe Travers at UMRK 2012-2013, 96K 24B .WAV (except Disc One- transferred 2005). The original analog tape edit master for Uncle Meat unfortunately suffers in sections from oxide loss due to tape age and bad storage conditions. A new hi-res digital patchwork edit master was created in 2013 with all damaged sections restored from safety tapes found in the vault for best sonics!\n\n.\n\nUncle Meat now sounds near to the original vinyl for the first time on cd. All the digital reverb of the UMRK 1987 version is not there anymore (as it is in all the other cd releases, including the 2012 UMe), and this version does not include the “bonus tracks” featured in the other cd editions (two excerpts from the Uncle Meat movie, and Tengo ‘na Minchia Tanta, a song recorded in the 80’s with Massimo Bassoli). From a sonic point of view, there is the same difference between the Hot Rats 2012 UMe edition and all the other cd versions released before: no digital reverb, maybe a little less brilliant but with a way better response at low frequencies. For instance the bassoon prolonged low note at the beginning of Uncle Meat: Main Title Theme sounds different here! Also, the 2016 soundscape is that of a small hall, which is more appropriate for the sort of chamber music featured in the album.\n\nThe early album sequence has a lot in common with cd 1 (many tracks are exactly alike), but includes also two unreleased underground, freak-out instrumentals (Whiskey Wah, The Whip) and a few reworked items (eg. King Kong as a single 10:46 episode at the end of an imaginary LP 1). In spite of the repetitions, this sequence (divided in four parts – four LP sides? – in the liner notes) has a lot to speak as far as FZ “compulsive editing”, to adhere to a Don Preston remark:\n\nI always liked to say that he was a compulsive editor. I saw him three months after an album was released, put that same album together in different ways, and re-editing the album when it’s not even going to come out. He used to love to sit there and edit anything.\n\nDon Preston, quoted by Billy James, Necessity Is . . . , 2001, p. 79\n\n(quoted in the IINK Uncle Meat notes page)\n\nThe Uncle Meat listening experience is slightly different with this sequence, particularly interesting is the position of the shortened King Kong, here is in part 2 (side 2?), which is the only full instrumental one. The King loses his status (his full side majesty), but here he is in the flow of the discourse, right in the center. As reported by Vaultmeister Joe Travers at ZappaCast, Episode 30 (October 31, 2016, the Meat Light chat starts approximately at 1:16), this sequence could represent the transition between No Commercial Potential (an earlier project, supposedly 6 sides log) and Uncle Meat.\n\nThe Vault section of disc 3 deserves a detailed account such as that given by zappateer Galeans (dig it here!). It features about 50 minutes of music (+4 minutes of spoken words and a beer scream!), a trip into alternate mixes, extended versions, further variations and used and unused building blocks.\n\nTango, 1/4 Tone Unit, Sakuji’s March, No. 4 are short unreleased nuggets that sounds like sketches of something that never happened, archetypal Zappa, not to be missed.\n\nBlood Unit has an interesting background:\n\nThere is some music in [The World’s Greatest Sinner] which actually resides in the Uncle Meat album. I remember the cue is something with a lot of sixteenth notes in it, sextuplets that had something to do with, uh, it’s been so long since I saw the movie, it was for a plane taking off, and that part was used, and also, the trail of blood sequence in World’s Greatest Sinner, where the guy stabs the host and there’s supposed to be a trail of blood on the lawn. That was called “Blood Unit”, in the scoring list, and that whole unit was done with electric instruments for Uncle Meat, but I can’t remember what I called it. I know it’s in the album. I can’t remember what I called it.\n\nFZ on Society Pages (USA), April, 1990\n\n(Quoted in the IINK Uncle Meat notes page)\n\nBlood Unit of course found his way (in a different mix) in Dog Breath, In The Year Of The Plague (incidentally, the opening number of The Original Sequence).\n\nBoth Electric Aunt Jemima and Mr. Green Genes mix outtakes include new guitar parts, those at the beginning of the latter are really short but delightful.\n\nPrelude To King Kong is extended by an unreleased FZ solo, about 2:00 long, a super add-on!\n\nExercise 4 Variant is self-explanatory: a sequence of variations of the Exercise 4 / Uncle Meat themes with various orchestrations, a great 4 minutes sort of trailer!\n\nMy Guitar (Proto I—Excerpt) is another underground, freak-out episode (as noted by Galeans “Frank’s solo sounds a bit treated: a sped up overdub?”), the more you have, the more you want!\n\nFor Uncle Meat (Live at Columbia University 1969), again I would like to quote eminent zappateer Galeans notes, truly appropriate:\n\nSomeone has suggested that FZ plays drums on this and I think he is definitely right: there are two drums and someone is playing marimba, likely Art Tripp, “FZ/JCB Drum Duet” on YCDTOSA5 comes from an “Uncle Meat” performance and, as shown on the Roxy video, Zappa did play percussion on this song in 1973/4.\n\nThe Vault section includes the normal speed guitar track of Nine Types Of Industrial Pollution, a lot of fun and, as already noted at zappateers.com, Stucco Homes comes into mind.\n\nFinally, Echo Pie needs a mention because it is FZ proposing the band to tour without him keeping the MOI moniker, he says there’s a lot of studio work to be done, in general another account of the difficulties suffered by the band.\n\nFor a complete report of all the differences between the original album and the music included in cd 2 and 3, do not miss the Meat Light notes page at IINK, it is also the evidence of that compulsive editing!\n\nMeat Light is of course a hard-core item, it is neatly constructed like this. If you are one of those cool people, go grab it. However if you are a newcomer you will probably refer to the main UMe catalog, as released in 2012, but if you do you will get the “digital reverb affected” edition. It would have been the opposite, like it happens with We’re Only in it for the Money: the main catalog single cd edition is the one that sounds like the original vinyl, while the “digital reverb affected” + new bass and drums is available through The Lumpy Money Project/Object.\n\nThere is a similar issue with Cruising With Ruben & The Jets: the “regular edition” is “digital reverb affected” and has 80’s bass and drums, while Greasy Love Songs includes the one that should be considered the reference. Luckily enough, they are both single cd editions. Hey newcomer, it won’t be easy, ask for help!\n\nA further note about the cover and the graphics project in general. The gorgeous painting by Theo Holdt on the front cover fits perfectly the theme. A matter of teeth, but also that abstract cow makes it. The other paintings (cds and inner cover art) are also interesting and they would have been probably of interest of FZ too. However the use of such a large amount of graphics external to the original project could be questionable.\n\nIn such a case you don’t have to judge the album by its cover, Meat Light gives Uncle Meat the treatment it deserved since a long time, at last!\n\nFor a closing remark, I would like to quote Ian Underwood from his concise liner notes (that includes some FZ relevant quotes too):\n\nListen carefully and in a focused manner.\n\nRead Frank’s own words which are readily available in books or the internet. Here are a few.\n\n~ Ian Underwood, August 2016\n\nYou can count me in!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn the following, more photos from the Getty Images Michael Oches Archives from the recording sessions at Apostolic Studios (New York, February 15, 1968).\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn January and April 2002, Jon Naurin and Charles Ulrich interviewed trumpet player Gary Barone about the Petit Wazoo tour (Gary now lives in Germany and teaches at the Jazz & Rock Schule Freiburg). The interview is available through the main web resource for the matter: The Petit Wazoo Tour by Charles Ulrich. The quote that follows perfectly depicts that band concept and gives some useful context information (more about the jazz scene related to Zappa and this tour elsewhere in this blog: That funny smell):\n\nThe repertoire consisted of three “sets” of songs: the first was the Grand Wazoo arrangements cut down for the smaller band–these were rehearsed and definitive versions. The second group of songs was rehearsed, but not set in stone–they evolved somewhat as we played them. The third group were “jams”–mostly entirely improvised (blues, grooves, etc.). I would have to hear the pieces again to say “how much” they were improvised.\n\nThis was probably one of the “jazziest” of Franks bands. He would come and play at the jam sessions in some of the cities on the tour. He seemed to get off playing with the “jazzers”. He was amazing. Although he didn’t come from the jazz idiom, he wanted to learn more–and sounded good doing it. I really respected him: his ability to put out so much music and so many ideas.\n\nAs well as Imaginary Diseases (Zappa Records, 2006) did, Little Dots (Zappa Records, 2016) freshly released 10 years after the former, equally explores the three sets mentioned by Gary.\n\nFirst of all, main credits:\n\n– ;- {= –\n\n1 Cosmik Debris 5:40\n\n2 Little Dots (Part 1) 11:00\n\n3 Little Dots (Part 2) 12:59\n\n4 Rollo (includes: Rollo / The Rollo Interior Area / Rollo Goes Out) 9:04\n\n5 Kansas City Shuffle 6:46\n\n6 “Columbia, S.C.” (Part 1) 8:58\n\n7 “Columbia, S.C.” (Part 2) 16:40\n\nOfficial Release #109\n\nCatalog Number: ZR 20026\n\nOriginal Recordings And Mixes Produced By Frank Zappa\n\nProduced For Release By Ahmet Zappa & Joe Travers\n\nPlayers:\n\nFrank Zappa – Conductor, Guitar, Vocals\n\nMalcolm McNab – Trumpet\n\nGary Barone – Trumpet\n\nTom Malone – Tuba/Saxes/Piccolo Trumpet/Trumpet\n\nEarl Dumler – Woodwinds\n\nGlenn Ferris – Trombone\n\nBruce Fowler – Trombone\n\nTony Duran – Slide Guitar\n\nDave Parlato – Bass\n\nJim Gordon – Drums, Steel Drum\n\nMaury Baker – Drums, Steel Drum (“Columbia, SC”)\n\n1972 4-Track 1/2-inch analog tape show masters recorded by Barry Keene\n\nMix Engineers: FZ, Michael Braunstein, Kerry McNabb\n\nMastering: Gavin Lurssen & Reuben Cohen at Lurssen Mastering, 2016\n\nAudio Transfers and Compilation by Joe Travers, UMRK 2016\n\nLiner Notes by Malcolm McNab and Maury Baker\n\nPhotos by Bernard Gardner\n\nPackage Design by Michael Mesker\n\nProduction Management by Melanie Starks\n\nSpecial Thanks: Ahmet, Diva, Holland Greco, Charles Ulrich\n\nThanks Forever: Frank & Gail\n\n– ;- {= –\n\n(that’s fantastic Charles!!, I’d also like to thank you!)\n\nGoing back to the Barone sets of songs, let’s try it, also considering Imaginary Diseases (the 2006 album) and Trudgin’ Across The Tundra (a single Petit Wazoo episode from One Shot Deal with a great trumpet solo by Gary Barone):\n\nrehearsed and definitive\n\nRollo (ID, LD)\n\nFarther O’Blivion (ID)\n\nCosmik Debris (LD)\n\nrehearsed, but evolving\n\nImaginary Diseases (ID)\n\nLittle Dots (LD)\n\njams (blues & groves)\n\nOddients (ID)\n\nBeen To Kansas City In A Minor (ID)\n\nD.C. Boogie (ID)\n\nMontreal (ID)\n\nKansas City Shuffle (LD)\n\nColumbia, S.C. (LD)\n\nTrudgin’ Across The Tundra (OSD)\n\nOfficial discography showcase of definitive Petit Wazoo arrangements is therefore limited to such three pieces, that is good but a few more deserves to surface, I for one would go for Waka/Jawaka and Duke of Prunes at least (please refer to the repertoire page of Charles’ site). Hopefully Frank Zappa “mixed, edited & tweaked” (see Imaginary Diseases liner notes) more of them.\n\nThe “evolving” sections of set two could be considered part of set three: set two is built of rather short arranged parts as intro or outro to improvised segments. Also, Imaginary Diseases and Little Dots are the only two “songs” peculiar to the Petit Wazoo: performed in 1972 only, between October and December (see repertoire again).\n\nSet three is actually two kind of jams: based on a canon (blues, boogie, etc.) or events based on an open, sometimes truly elaborated, structure.\n\nFrank Zappa introducing Columbia, S.C.:\n\nSuppose we’re in to just sort of make something up right here on the stage, would that be offensive to you?\n\nBlues, Jazz? Suppose it was none of the above.\n\nSuppose some of those other things creep into it periodically.\n\nAll we’d like to do is just extend our imagination a little bit up here and see what happens.\n\nLet’s start up with the steel drums, and the bass and the baritone oboe.\n\n[…]\n\nIf it’s too crappy we will quit.\n\nColumbia, S.C. starts with a sort of chamber intro followed by trumpet and tuba solo episodes, the latter with Zappa to counterpoint at it also with the Peter Gunn Theme. Then some full orchestra figures, that sound like conducted improvisations (à la Everything Is Healing Nicely), bring to a trombone solo (I bet it’s Bruce) with improvised (probably conducted) full orchestra figures scattered into it. Part 1 suddenly ends and, incredibly enough, frenzy perfectly melts into a relaxed intro to a new improvised section based upon some melodic material vaguely recalling of the James Bond Theme. FZ solo slowly raises tension, then orchestra enters to serve an intro to Tony Duran for a second guitar solo, with FZ at rhythm guitar. Frenzy is back again but a little over everything goes down once more for a gentle start of a short drum solo that brings to a second Zappa solo combined with a lot of orchestra blasts. Then the initial sort of Bond Theme enters (guitar, clarinet, trumpet and brass) to perfectly calm everything down for a “thank you very much” finale. Zappa: “And now for the truly conclusion of that invented song …” As to confirm that it was a one time only event that could be also originated by an incident occurred shortly before that night:\n\nNovember 5, 1972—Township Auditorium, Columbia, SC\n\nGamecock, University Of South Carolina, November 6, 1972\n\nTownship arrests\n\nTwo members of Frank Zappa’s “Mothers of Invention” band were arrested last night at Township Auditorium for possession of cocaine.\n\nHorn player Gary Barone and drummer James B. Gordon were arrested during an intermission in the show between 10:45 and 10:55 according to Sgt. Galvin of the Columbia Police Department narcotics squad.\n\nBoth musicians posted $5,000 bond and were released to their attorney.\n\nWhen the mothers appeared on stage Frank Zappa prefaced the performance with “Our regular drummer couldn’t be here tonight because he has a peculiar malady.”\n\nAt the end of the performance the crowd at the auditorium began screaming more, more as is the custom for requesting an encore. Zappa, however, cut the show short saying that circumstances beyond his control prevented extending the performance for another number.\n\nsource: 1972—Chronology Sources, Notes & Comments at Information Is Not Knowledge.\n\nMaury Baker was the second drummer for this band and entered the stage that night to participate to this amazing performance that also gives a perfect example of what an awesome musical architect Zappa was.\n\nThere must be a criteria for the titles to the jams (Barone set three). Those named after a place with no reference to a canon (boogie, shuffle, etc.) should be one-time only, with blues and jazz to “creep into it periodically”.\n\nAs far as we know, all Petit Wazoo issued material has been “handpicked and worked on by the Maestro himself” (from the Little Dots liner notes), Kansas City Shuffle for instance has been cutted down from about 12 minutes to less than 7 (solos by Tony Duran solo and Tom Malone (alto) as been edited out), hopefully there’s more of such pre-produced material chosen from 21 dates and 27 shows, fully packed with gorgeous arrangements, bluesy improvisations and on-time only events such as Columbia, S.C..\n\nBack to the Barone remarks about the repertoire (and to the above tentative subdivision), Joe Travers has carefully compiled the two released 1972 titles giving each one a good balance of the three sets.\n\nWe now have Farther O’Blivion (ID) and Rollo (ID, LD), probably the most important “rehearsed and definitive” 1972 renditions, furthermore the Little Dots Rollo arrangement is unreleased in this form, complete with the first two parts with lyrics and with a few breaks later used for Zomby Woof.\n\nThe “evolving” set includes the two cornerstones of the tour, and Little Dots perfectly represents the Petit Wazoo approach to music: part 1 is improvisation wide-open, while part 2 gives the audience that “old thing” in a boogie form, with a weird finale. Introducing this performance of this piece, Frank Zappa gave a perfect description of such a structure, that probably also is a comprehensive picture of his whole opus, if you think at it as a fractal thing:\n\nNow we’re gonna play something that contains within it its own devious little boogie, but before you get to the boogie there’s a bunch of weird stuff on either side of it.\n\n“Jams” is the larger set, and “blues and grooves” were in fact a large portion of these shows. Between those picked by Joe, Columbia, S.C. surely push the audience beyond. Hopefully there is more of “mixed, edited & tweaked” by FZ to come from the Vault. Just to give an example I have just ended up listening to the December 9 Portland late show that includes an 18 minute improvisation (the open-wind kind of) with great sections and weak moments, it would be great if FZ had handpicked it for some of his legendary tweaks!\n\nIn short, Columbia, S.C., Little Dots and Rollo can be considered the highlights of the second Petit Wazoo release while Farther O’Blivion, Imaginary Diseases and D.C. Boogie were probably those of the first. Handpick both and cross your fingers for a third one!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNovember 16 – Post Scriptum\n\nToday I got the physical CD in my mailbox and I finally managed to read the liner notes. Both Malcom McNab and Maury Baker share their memories of the Columbia incident/concert that eventually brought Zappa to conceive a very special night as far as improvisation was concerned. Maury Baker recalls how he joined the band at the very last minute, he was the drummer in Tim Buckeley’s band that was the opening act for Frank that night. Because of the Barone/Gordon incident, Zappa asked Baker to play drums with the Petit Wazoo right before the beginning of the concert in Columbia! Malcom McNab:\n\nWith the drummer from Tim Buckeley’s band, Maury Baker, and was was left the Zappa band, we proceeded to make up the entire performance, improvising along with Frank’s unique conducting and creative influence and of course, great guitar solos.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOut of the blue, on June 9, while many had been pondering about trustees and beneficiaries of the Zappa integrity and of his overwhelming and strangely managed output, ZFT trustees announced the world, including beneficiaries of any sort, two new releases due to July 15.\n\nFrank Zappa for President? You betcha! We know at various times he wanted to run for office. In the spirit of the dramatic 2016 presidential election adventures comes a release that gives us a glimpse into what could have been. This album is comprised of unreleased compositions realized on the Synclavier, along with other relevant tracks mined from the Vault, with a political thread tying it all together. Don’t forget to register and vote!\n\nThe Crux of the Biscuit was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Frank Zappa’s 1974 album Apostrophe(‘). As part of Zappa Records’ ongoing Frank Zappa Project/Object Audio Documentary Series, it contains rare alternate mixes, live performances, and studio session outtakes. This release celebrates Zappa’s iconic, Gold-certified album, which landed in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nsource: zappa.com\n\n.\n\nUnreleased synclavier compositions, never heard before mixes of ’60s and ’70s classics, nuggets that shed new light on the studio compositional process, live episodes relevant to two basic themes: the President of the USA and 42 years of trudging across the tundra.\n\nIn summary: succulent!\n\nHowever from the outer FZ space perspective, I can’t help feeling still scary of the future, and I do hope the Zappas will be able to continue digging the vault, and I also hope the “cease and desist” nightmare will not happen as it does in the darkest canyons of my mind.\n\nBut forget about this mess for a couple of hours, take a deep breath and immerse in these two albums.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit\n\n1 Cosmik Debris 4:21\n\n2 Uncle Remus (Mix Outtake) 3:59\n\n3 Down In De Dew (Alternate Mix) 3:16\n\n4 Apostrophe’ (Mix Outtake) 9:07\n\n5 The Story Of “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast” 2:25\n\n6 Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast (Live) 19:26\n\n7 Excentrifugal Forz (Mix Outtake) 1:34\n\n8 Energy Frontier (Take 4) 3:04\n\n9 Energy Frontier (Take 6 With Overdubs) 4:15\n\n10 Energy Frontier (Bridge) 8:23\n\n11 Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) 5:11\n\n12 Don’t Eat The Yellow (Basic Tracks-Alternate Take) 2:12\n\n13 Nanook Rubs It (Basic Tracks-Outtake) 0:42\n\n14 Nanook Rubs It (Session Outtake) 0:48\n\n15 Frank’s Last Words . . . 0:16\n\nProduced by Gail Zappa and Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment and audio transfers by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Bob Ludwig\n\nNew mixes: Craig Parker Adams, 2014\n\nCover photograph: Yoram Kahana (probably) [uncredited]\n\nOther photography: Emerson/Loew, Mark Aalyson, Jeffrey Mayer, Michael Mesker\n\nIllustration: David Calcano/Christian Garcia\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nPackage design: Michael Mesker\n\nLiner notes: Simon Prentis\n\nProduction Manager: Melanie Starks\n\n.\n\nFor most listeners, Apostrophe(‘) is mainly the place where snow is yellow and feet stink. Also, the Bromhidrosis epic is where THE question arises: “What is your Conceptual Continuity?” Since the easy to be seen answer is “The crux of the biscuit is the Apostrophe(‘)”, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the best known FZ albums without Stink-foot – hence without Fido who will eternally bring those stink-fated slippers and gives THE answer – is like giving praise to Don Quixote not mentioning Sancho.\n\nLet’s commemorate such conspicuous absence with the commercial that inspired a distinguished dog-man relationship (relevant scene at 0:17):\n\n.\n\nThat said, The Crux Of The Biscuit is a must for hard-core fanatics due to plenty exquisite episodes, and may have a lot of interest for the rest of the world, for instance for the main Yellow Snow celebration, almost 20 minutes live from Hordern Pavillon, Sydney, June 1973, a tape that should become road, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe album, possibly the last produced by Gail and Joe, starts with a proto Apostrophe(‘) side A (tracks 1-4) whose main interest is the dynamic duo Down in the Dew/Apostrophe’, new to mankind as a dual system. Simon Prentis, who delivered a truly relevant piece of zappology as liner notes, gives information and his own view about Energy Frontier, the original title of such a double jam sessions. Simon quotes a well-known Zappa statement:\n\nQ: What about playing with (bass guitarist) Jack Bruce on Apostrophe?\n\nFZ: Well, that was just a jam thing that happened because he was a friend of (drummer) Jim Gordon. I found it very difficult to play with him; he’s too busy. He doesn’t really want to play the bass in terms of root functions; I think he has other things on his mind. But that’s the way jam sessions go.\n\n“Frank Zappa”\n\nBy Steve Rosen\n\nGuitar Player, January, 1977\n\n.\n\nThen he reports (via joe Travers) that those Dew/Apostrophe’ jams were all recorded on November 8, 1972, also with an unknown flute player on tracks 8 and 9. As effectively remarked by Prentis, the subsequent work has been an editing matter, that night after night shortened Jack Bruce contribution and brought Down in the Dew out (later to emerge for Läther without Jack Bruce in a version near to track 3). What is presented here (proto tracks 3 and 4, and jam tracks 8-10) is the evidence of a process that started with a jam session, continued with a proto dual system (with Bruce in Apostrophe’ only) and ended as we know it simply as Apostrophe’. Thanks to this album, now we know better why Zappa said that Bruce was “busy”, it seems that such a one-day encounter didn’t give what could be theoretical expected in terms of interplay, but the way the bass guitar of Jack Bruce sounds in these unreleased jams is gorgeous (a FZ post-production?) and some of his lines are truly remarkable (like those delivered into the first minute of the original Apostrophe’ – and of track 4 – that give a clear mark to that jam).\n\nSo editing as a major Zappa craft and practice, and “omission” as a keyword to guide the transition from the on-field recorded matter to the edited recorded object to be released. That is one the main subjects of the liner notes, fully available through simonprentis.net, a must read!\n\nAnd omission is at work within lyrics too, significance is often hidden or lies on a metaphoric level, or may be even almost faint in cases when information is delivered for conceptual continuity purpose only.\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit, and its liner notes, brought this blog to closely consider the mysterious and elliptic lyrics for Excentrifugal Forz (a Mix Outtake belongs to this album too) and hopefully get nearer to some of the omitted points. See what you think:\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nThe clouds are really cheap\n\n[Reality is not so interesting]\n\nThe way I seen ’em thru the ports\n\n[That’s how it looks to me]\n\nOf which there is a half-a-dozen\n\n[A little part of it]\n\nOn the base of my resorz\n\n[Is what I have been doing]\n\nYou wouldn’t think I’d have too many\n\n[From everyone point of view, a very little part]\n\nSince I never cared for sports\n\n[Because I’m an outsider]\n\nBut I’m never really lonely\n\n[But I don’t care to be seen/understood]\n\nIn my Excentrifugal Forz\n\n[My nature is to escape from what is accepted by most people]\n\nThere’s always Korla Plankton\n\n[And if I feel too much out of reality (as Korla Pandit do!)]\n\nHim ‘n me can play the blues\n\n[I can always play the blues]\n\nAn’ then I’ll watch him buff that\n\n[And I will enjoy shining every single blues canon]\n\nTiny ruby that he use\n\n[… canon …]\n\nHe’ll straighten up his turban\n\n[… canon …]\n\nAn’ eject a little ooze\n\n[… canon …]\n\nAlong a one-celled Hammond Organism\n\n[The blues is an archetypal culture, as one-celled organisms are archaic forms of life]\n\nUnderneath my shoes\n\n[And it is part of me, deeply]\n\nAn’ then I’ll call PUP TENTACLE\n\n[I can also get inspiration from cheap monsters]\n\n[The monster in Cheepnis, a “pup tent affair”, seems to be recalled here, as noted elsewhere by Simon Prentis, it may represent one of those “clouds”, or reality as constructed/perceived by most people]\n\nI’ll ask him how’s his chin\n\n[I can image further mutations]\n\nI’ll find out\n\n[And doing so]\n\nHow the future is\n\n[Time as everyone knows it]\n\nBecause that’s where he’s been\n\n[Loses in significance]\n\nHis little feet got long ‘n flexible\n\n[And I found myself on a spherical time constant]\n\nAn’ suckers fell right in\n\n[Far from what is accepted by most people]\n\nThe time he crossed the line\n\n[That’s where my mutations live]\n\nFrom LATER ON to WAY BACK WHEN\n\n[Because when I deal with my favorite mutations, before and after do not make sense anymore]\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nA few more remarks are needed to close the not yellow side of this album, discussion is open at zappateers and other FZ loci. Cosmik Debris (track 1) opens with an unheard before brass intro. This version of Uncle Remus includes new and not to be missed Ikettes embroideries, but also further gorgeous George keyboard treatments. Apostrophe’ (mix outtake) shares the drum intro with Stink-foot (the only link discovered so far with the Fido song). The two Energy Frontier takes are two different Down in Dew versions with Jack Bruce, Energy Frontier (Bridge) is actually an early version of Apostrophe’. Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) includes a new bluesy FZ solo and is a no vocals version to be sang to!\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit starts dealing with Yellow Snow with the words of FZ introducing this new piece in 1973. He tells how he was also inspired by an Imperial Margarine commercial, “Good morning, your highness!” comes from it. Unfortunately only a bad quality recording of such a promotional feature survives into the Internet, but it is worth watching anyway (the “black gentleman” commercial starts at 01:02).\n\n.\n\nMargarine inspired also the 1973 Mar-Juh-Rene routine, well-known but officially released only in 2008 in One Shot Deal as part of Australian Yellow Snow. This routine is also included here in track 6 which is an extended version of the Yellow Snow suite, also including Rollo and part of the Steno Pool section of Greggery Peccary. Both versions derive from the June 24-26, 1973 Sydney concerts, once again, road one please!\n\nIn his Zappa dissertation, Tomasz Michalak digs into significance and symbols related to the apostrophe and hyphen (“something that might be used for erotic gratification by a very desperate stenographer”) signs. He also quotes FZ who recalls a linguistic inspiration for Yellow Snow in two different interviews:\n\nI had a conversation in approximately 1972 with a schoolteacher in Kansas. She taught English. And she was talking about the way language works. And her point was that any language develops for a culture based on the things that the culture needs to talk about. And as an example she said in Eskimo language they have, you know, a whole number of different words for snow because snow is their life. And she was the one who said maybe they even have something for yellow snow, which you wouldnít want to eat it. And thatís what gave me the idea. (FZ, interviewed by Jim Ladd, August 1, 1989)\n\nAnd:\n\nas an example she talked about the Eskimo language, which she said had twenty words for snow because it was so important to them. And she actually made the comment that probably in the Eskimo language there was some sort of warning for children not to eat yellow snow. And thatís where the idea came from. (FZ, interviewed by Allan Handelman, East Coast Live, June 6, 1993)\n\nQuoted (P.293) into\n\n“THE MEGAPHONE OF DESTINY-” COMPOSITION, VOICE, AND MULTITUDE IN THE AUDITORY AVANT-GARDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: GERTRUDE STEIN, SAMUEL BECKETT, JOHN CAGE, AND FRANK ZAPPA\n\nTomasz Zbigniew Michalak\n\nA THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (English Literature) THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (Vancouver)\n\nDecember 2013\n\n.\n\nThe album closes with three early snippets from the Yellow Snow suite and a last brief track with Frank stopping the tape. Very hard-core maniac type stuff with no commercial potential at all, enjoyable for a limited audience such as Rne who noticed in his “rudimentary notes” that “the marimba figure and the laughs that were inserted at the very end of “Father O’Blivion” in the Apostrophe (‘) album” are included in Frank’s Last Words… .\n\nFor the full story of the Yellow Snow suite I would recommend a brief article by Charles Ulrich hosted on the ARF web site: “Some notes on the Yellow Snow suites permutations”\n\nFinally the original artwork for the back of the CD inlay deserve to be mentioned. It’s a Zappa cereal box probably illustrated by David Calcano of Fantoons Animation Studio in Los Angeles. Here it is with some details (click the images to enlarge them).\n\n.\n\nFor further notes on the cover of the album refer to the Information Is Not Knowledge (IINK) web site, at the beginning of the Apostrophe (‘) notes page.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nFrank Zappa For President\n\n1 Overture To “Uncle Sam” 15:16\n\n2 Brown Shoes Don’t Make It (Remix) 7:27\n\n3 Amnerika (Vocal Version) 3:10\n\n4 “If I Was President” 3:43\n\n5 When The Lie’s So Big 3:38\n\n6 Medieval Ensemble 6:31\n\n7 America The Beautiful (Bates/Ward; Traditional) 3:36\n\nProduced for release by Ahmet Zappa & Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment, transfers and compilation by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Gavin Lurssen & Reuben Cohen\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nArt, layout: Keith Lawler\n\nProduction management: Melanie Starks\n\nCover art details available at the proper IINK web page.\n\n.\n\nIf The Crux of the Biscuit objective as an Audio Documentary is very well stated and accomplished (including omissions), with the support of informative and in-depth liner notes, Frank Zappa for President appears like an unglued sequence of nuggets and lush unreleased pieces joined together by a political thread that ends up to be too weak in absentia.\n\nAlso, from a hard-core fanatic perspective the album is full of interest beside the basic theme, but such material would have deserved more informative liner notes.\n\nTake Overture To “Uncle Sam” for instance, since this piece is in the repertoire of Ensemble Ascolta for the never released project Ascolta Plays Zappa, it would have been very interesting to hear their point of view about this composition dated 1993. And why not take them for a note to the other synclavier material included?\n\nPart of Overture To “Uncle Sam” has been premiered by the Ascolta ensemble at Radialsystem, Berlin, July 14, 2007 (the 0:00 – 4:49 section). An excerpt (2:35 – 4:49) is available through their web site.\n\nhttp://www.ascolta.de/_obj/698E13B0-FE70-4A57-A5DA-A9DF78121C89/inline/Uncle-Sam.mp3\n\n.\n\nThe version included here is ten minutes longer than the Ascolta one and features the sonic palette typical of the late FZ synclavier works that can be heard in Civilazion Phase III and Dance Me This. Also, Overture To “Uncle Sam” should have a close relationship with the Wolf Harbor suite. No link instead with Dio Fa (the abandoned FZ opera project) as elsewhere stated in this blog (the notes to the Berlin, July 14, 2007 Ascolta ensemble concert program led to this probably false conjecture: “planned as an overture to an opera for La Scala in Milan, world premiere”).\n\nTo focus on the right Uncle Sam / Wolf Harbor setting you should go back to the liner notes to Dance Me This:\n\nOver the years I had seen Frank jump from project to project often shelving one indefinitely to focus on another. There was an elaborate stage piece titled Dio Fa; An opera titled Uncle Sam (about a dystopian future America with a ludicrously polluted New York Harbour); A music notation book with accompanying audio disc titled The Rhythmic Sadist’s Guide to Drum Patterns for the 21st Century.\n\nTodd Yvega–\n\nIn his vision for a staged presentation for modern dance [FZ] described how he wanted to represent Wolf Harbor (do the research on this place which really does exist): Groups of dancers side by side would hold long rolled out lengths of black trash bags (think Hefty) and “wave” them at waist (waste) height to signify the dark and murky polluted waters of sludgy Wolf Harbor.\n\nGail Zappa–\n\n.\n\nA sort of unresolved melancholy in a suspended time environment is a feeling common to both compositions. The difference resides in how the tension ends up to be unresolved. In Wolf Harbor tension is low and everywhere, time is suspended, no resolution allowed.\n\nOverture To “Uncle Sam” features a main melodic (and melancholic) material used as opening and with some variations at 02:02, 05:58 and 11:08. Right after every variation tension grows and its resolution seems to happen when the listener recognizes the melodic material, but relief is denied when he realizes that melancholy is still there. The finale is true Zappa: tension grows again and closes with a sort of brief broadway hoopla!\n\nThe illusion of a resolution results to be more effective than no resolution at all!\n\nHoopla! back to 1966/1969, Frank Zappa for President brings the listener to a never heard before remixed version of Brown Shoes Don’t Make It, a pleasure for everyone, especially for those who spent countless time with this 1966 sonic movie and will recognize all details changed in this remix. Acoustic ensemble is often clearer and the overall sound image results spatially enriched. In this case also it would have been much interesting to know what was the purpose of such a 1969 remix. Rejected for the 1969 Mothermania (which included the 1966 mix)?\n\nNo particular questions to ask for Amnerika (Vocal Version), a well-known (for FZ tape traders) and beautiful unreleased Thing-Fish outtake that needed to be released. Maybe one: why it has been rejected?\n\n“If I Was President” is Zappa explaining in 1990 why he “wouldn’t campaign” but “file as a candidate of no party” with a 1985 synclavier background (for the full text transcript please refer to the relevant IINK web page). Was it a Zappa produced audio object?\n\nAn unreleased 1988 When The Lie’s So Big take follows, politics is of course the rationale for the inclusion, however the hard-core fanatic (the main audience for this album) attention declines, this version does not add zappology elements (except for some slight changes in the lyrics) and it does not give particular help to the flow of the program.\n\nFor the next Medieval Ensemble, an unreleased 1985 synclavier composition, attention is back. It sounds like a Jazz From Hell outtake, a long march with no resolution with a medieval flavor, could be used for the eternally postponed Terry Gilliam Don Quixote!\n\nThe album closes with another 1988 episode. The America The Beautiful version digitally (mp3 only) released in The Frank Zappa AAA·FNR·AAA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2008 Nice to have it in a good audio quality (but strangely different from the official 1988 releases), relevant to the main theme, but in an album of unreleased material and with a surprising 1969 mix of a classic, the role of this song is simply to close the curtain.\n\nNow I’m wondering, in an album like this, where politics in America is a theme sometimes loose (Medieval Ensemble?!?), why do not take advantage of the lines:\n\nCould result in the end\n\nTo a worrisome trend\n\nIn which every American\n\nNot “born again”\n\nCould be punished in cruel and unusual ways\n\nBy this treacherous cretin\n\nWho tells everyone\n\nThat he’s Jesus’ best friend\n\nto include another bundle nugget that unethically still remains unreleased in a lossless audio standard? I’m thinking to Treacherous Cretins from The Frank Zappa AAA·FNRAA·AA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2010, a killer version that needs to expand its audience.\n\nMoreover, can you spot any treacherous cretins somewhere in this 2016 USA campaign?\n\n."
