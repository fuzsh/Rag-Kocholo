        "text": "OK, Great Effort! But, some errors.....First Spelling:\n\na. \"The Mothers of Invetion\" is missing an 'n' in 'Invention'\n\nb. \"Feeding the Monkies at Ma Maison\" not \"Ma Mansion\"\n\nc. There might be one or two more typos, but I lost track of them.\n\n2nd - Exclude Non-Official releases:\n\nI suggest that you limit the content to OFFICIAL FZ numbered titles only and omit the: The *** of the Mothers, The Mothers of Invention, Worst of The Mothers, Guitar World, Strictly Commercial and Genteel, Cucamonga, Cheap and Son of Cheap Thrills, and all of the Birthday Bundle downloads (except for that horrid Baby Snakes Compleat S/T abortion...what was Gail thinking). Also, remove the Joe's Garage Box as that is already covered by Vol 1 and Vol 2/3.\n\n3rd: Missing: Where is London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 2 (1986)?;\n\nMore later....thanks!\n\nSome more annoying suggestions:\n\n4th: Relocate: Mystery Disc, Joe's X-msg Lumpy Money, Greasy Love Songs, Finer Moments, Joe's Camouflage, Crux of the Biscuit and Meat Light should go in Posthumous Albums. They are not comps in the true sense but mostly outtake collections (example: see MOFO).\n\nLastly Live Albums (or nearly live): Just Another Band From LA is 95% live (FZ tweaked it a bit for release); Them or Us is 75% live, Weasels is 75% live, Burnt Weeny is 60% live, Sheik Yerbouti is about 75% live, Shut Up an Play Guitar and \"Some More\" are ALL live (except for segues) and Return Of the Son is 50% live (side 2 are studio outtakes). SATLTSADW is 50% live, & The Yellow Shark is 100% live. I know that this is a grey area (yes I am nit picking :0).\n\nNow to look at that other FZ LP quiz........ Good luck and Thanks!"
