        "text": "Boo… no concert photos this time around… they wouldn’t allow cameras into the venue at all. :(\n\n(Dweezil = rock)\n\nThis was my 3rd time seeing the Zappa Plays Zappa tour (aka Tour de Frank)… each one being different (set lists, lineup, promotions). This time was at Portland’s Hawthorne Theater as the “You Can’t Fit On Stage Anymore” variation of the tour. The venue had a small capacity (~300), you get a download code at the venue to get the entire recorded show after they mix it down (about a month?), you have a chance to win a free Hagstrom guitar (at each show), and you get to help choose the set list for the night. Of the 68 available tunes in the ZPZ band’s repertoire, here were my selections: Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, Inca Roads, Montana, Peaches En Regalia, and Sofa. They played two of my choices. I was really hoping for “Montana,” though. Eh, choosers shouldn’t be beggars.\n\nDweezil came out first and talked about the download code and how it wouldn’t quite be ready within 8 days, but that it’d be worth the wait. I’m sure it will, as it’s gonna be 3 CDs of professionally recorded audio for “free.” Free in that it’s part of the pricey ticket. But, it’s not like I have to pay for it again, eh? :)\n\nThe band was very similar (if not the same) as when I saw the 2007 tour at Moonlite Gardens in Cincinnati, OH. Different set list, of course. They had a few technical difficulties during the show, but veryveryvery minor, and they rolled with the punches very well. Outside of Ray White, they were all pretty much playing for the entire show, and even Ray only had a few breaks when he wasn’t needed to sing.\n\nThe ZPZ Band this time around is:\n\nDweezil Zappa: Guitar\n\nAaron Arntz: Keyboards\n\nScheila Gonzalez: Saxophone, Flute, Keyboards & Vocals\n\nPete Griffin: Bass\n\nBilly Hulting: Marimba, Mallets & Percussion\n\nJamie Kime: Guitar\n\nJoe Travers: Drums & Vocals\n\nSPECIAL GUEST… Ray White: Guitar & Vocals\n\n(Ray White is the pimp)\n\nSetlist: (any help in filling in the blanks is appreciated)\n\nPeaches En Regalia(a fave of the set)\n\nCity of Tiny Lights\n\nInca Roads(a fave of the set)\n\nI’m Not Satisfied\n\nPygmy Twylyte\n\nIdiot Bastard Son\n\nCheepnis (partial) then back to Inca Roads (??)\n\nHagstrom Guitar Giveaway Jam (I didn’t win… boo…)\n\nChunga’s Revenge with solos\n\nBilly the Mountain (28 minutes)(a fave of the set)\n\nAndy\n\nDirty Love(a fave of the set)\n\nUncle Remus\n\nWillie the Pimp(a fave of the set)\n\nWind Up Workin’ in a Gas Station\n\nSan Ber’dino\n\nYo Mama\n\nBlack Napkins\n\nEncore:____________ (missing name, more guitar solos)\n\nMuffin Man(a fave of the set)\n\nAll in all… fantastic show… 2 hours and 40+ minutes of amazing musicianship… the only things to make it better? My own pictures perhaps… oh, and winning the guitar would have been nice. :)\n\nI hope they come around again in the fall… I’ve seen all three of the ZPZ tours. And this was technically the “2008” tour, even though it was in 2009 (obviously). Seeing as I wasn’t into Frank’s music before he died, this is the next best damn thing. Thanks, Dweezil and Co.!\n\nThe Appropriate Linkage:\n\nhttp://www.zappa.com/zpz/index.html\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dweezilzappa\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/zappaplayszappa\n\nhttp://www.hawthornetheater.com/\n\n~Dan – np: Ryan Adcock – Finished -LP-\n\nBefore I start… happy 68th birthday to Frank Zappa. You are missed. Ya Hozna!\n\nThis is sort of a precursor to my “official” Favorites of 2008 blog. Up later this coming week or two, I’ll post my favorite vocal and favorite instrumental albums of 2008. I’m still making my way through the re-listening phase. Yeah, I know, I’m slow (or dedicated? or certifiable?). I was waiting on a few to show up in my mailbox. Anyway, on with the music pimping…\n\nMy Other Favorites of 2008 Recaps:\n\nFave Concerts of ‘08 are recapped *HERE*\n\nFavorite EPs of 2008 (coincidentally all indie artists)\n\n1 Ellery You Did Everything Right – http://www.ellerymusic.com/\n\n2 Estradasphere The Pegasus Vault – http://www.estradasphere.com/\n\n3 Glen Phillips Secrets of the New Explorers – http://www.glenphillips.com/\n\n4 Kim Taylor The Greatest Story – http://www.kim-taylor.net/\n\n5 Wussy Rigor Mortis – http://www.wussymusic.com/\n\nFavorite Vinyl of 2008\n\n1 Holy Fuck Lovely Allen 19″ single (7″+12″) – http://www.holyfuckmusic.com/\n\n2 God of Shamisen The Science Fiction of Ray Bradbury Attack! 7″ single – http://www.godofshamisen.com/\n\n3 Puscifer Dozo 7″ single – http://www.puscifer.com/\n\n4 David Bazan (of Pedro the Lion) Jingle Bells / All I Want for Christmas (Christmas 7″) – http://www.davidbazan.com/\n\n5 Puscifer Queen B 7″ single\n\nFavorite Live Albums of 2008\n\n1 Dave Douglas & Keystone Live at the Jazz Standard, April 2008 – http://www.greenleafmusic.com/ (this was 4 nights, 2 sets each night, 8 hours of music released as “instant live” within 24 hours of each performance… and fantastic)\n\n2 Porcupine Tree We Lost the Skyline EP – http://www.porcupinetree.com/\n\n3 David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd) Live in Gdańsk – http://www.davidgilmour.com/\n\n4 Ani DiFranco Hamburg Germany, 10.18.07 – http://www.righteousbabe.com/\n\n5 Tori Amos Live at Montreux 1991 & 1992 – http://www.toriamos.com/\n\nFavorite Comedy Albums of 2008\n\n1 Flight of the Conchords Flight of the Conchords\n\n2 George Carlin It’s Bad For Ya\n\n3 Mitch Hedberg Do You Believe in Gosh?\n\nFavorite Reissues in 2008\n\n1 Jurassic 5 – Jurassic 5 11th Anniversary\n\n2 John Zorn, Bill Frisell & George Lewis – News for Lulu\n\n3 John Coltrane – The Impulse Albums, Vol 2 (including John Coltrane & Johnny Hartman, Impressions, Live at Birdland, Crescent, and A Love Supreme)\n\n4 Ahleuchatistas – The Same and the Other\n\n5 Beck – Odelay (deluxe edition)\n\nFavorite Debut of 2008\n\nGod of Shamisen‘s Dragon String Attack! -and- Ashes Divide‘s Keep Telling Myself It’s Alright\n\nFavorite Internet Only Releases in 2008\n\nGlen Phillips had his hand in both of them… and they’re both free…\n\nPlover – Plover -and- RemoteTreeChildren – Veteran of the Loudness Wars\n\nFavorite Internet Leaks in 2008\n\nBen Folds – Way to Normal (fake version of the album leaked by Ben himself) -and-\n\nSufjan Stevens – Songs for Christmas, Vol VIII: Astral Inter Planet Space Captain Christmas Infinity Voyage (he made it for family & friends… luckily one of those also let it loose for the rest of us)\n\nFavorite Artwork in 2008\n\nNIN – Ghosts I-IV – each song in the download version had it’s own unique artwork attached to it. Whether studio or nature or electronic, it worked well with this release.\n\nFavorite Packaging / Design in 2008\n\nSigur Rós – Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust (deluxe edition)\n\nSteven Wilson – Insurgentes (deluxe edition) – Both Sigur Rós and Steven Wilson came out with lush coffee table-sized books that housed the music.Call it an incentive to somewhat combat the illegal downloaders. I call it great art.\n\nAni DiFranco – Red Letter Year – Always a packaging visionary, this one was more subtle than recent efforts… the glow in the dark moon was a nice touch.\n\nMetallica – Death Magnetic – Not necessarily breaking new ground musically, their packaging for the return to form metal album evokes digging through 6 feet of fresh dirt to see if Lars Ulrich’s drumming sounds better than beating on a metal folding chair. Thankfully it does… this time.\n\nSecret Chiefs 3 plays John Zorn‘s Masada Book Two: Xaphan – I love what Chippy does for Tzadik Records. The Masada Book Two series artwork and die-cut Star of David with offset colors that poke through is some of her best work.\n\nFavorite “Local” Album of 2008\n\nOK, they’re from Cincinnati and Portland (respectively)… but local enough for me… I’ve got my ears in two locales (the Cincinnati/Dayton scene will probably always have a shot at winning in this category).\n\nNoctaluca‘s Still the Wicked Rest -and- Talkdemonic‘s Eyes at Half Mast\n\nFavorite Soundtrack or Score\n\nJoss Whedon‘s Dr Horrible’s Sing-along Blog -and- Mike Patton‘s A Perfect Place\n\nFavorite Concept Album\n\nNoctaluca‘s Still the Wicked Rest -and- Zakarya‘s The True Story Concerning Martin Behaim\n\nThat’s all for now… more coming in the next week…\n\n~Dan – np: Celldweller – Soundtrack for the Voices in My Head\n\nnew music alert\n\nVladimir Bozar ‘n’ Ze Sheraf Orkestar‘s Universal Sprache is one of those albums that is hard to define. Vladimir Bozar started as an offshoot from a French Frank Zappa cover band, The Children of Invention. Their last gig was Vladimir Bozar’s first gig. The music on this debut CD is a great mix of the insanity that comes from artists like Frank Zappa, Mr. Bungle, Secret Chiefs 3, and to some extent John Zorn.\n\nClearly not for the purveyor of “pop” music, this is a very imposingly hard to digest collection of great sounds that I wouldn’t necessarily call “songs.” With that being said… I love it. It jots and tittles across your mind, and right when you start getting into the groove… it slaps you upside the mouth, buzzes up your leg, claws through your pant leg and sits down like a puppy who wants to be petted, then zooms off for an espresso.\n\nMetal, punk, classical music, jazz, movie sound, Tzigane music, electronic, and spoken word. This Ritalin-side effect gang of misfits has toured in Europe with Trey Spruance’s Secret Chiefs 3, as well as the stripped down Estradasphere Trio. Trey Spruance said of Vladimir Bozar ‘n’ Ze Sheraf Orkestar that “obviously, this music is composed of lunatics hopelessly.” :)\n\nThe album, Universal Sprache, was recorded in Estradasphere’s Seattle studio with Tim Smolens recording, Tim Smolens and Jason Schimmel* mixing, and Timb Harris contributing trumpet, TIm Smolens contributing bass & vocals, and Jason Schimmel contributing mandolin.\n\n*– Speaking of Jason Schimmel, I’m stoked for his amazing Orange Tulip Conspiracy tour coming through Eugene, Oregon, next week… November 17th @ Samurai Duck.\n\nVladimir Bozar ‘n’ Ze Sheraf Orkestar are planning to tour Europe and (hopefully) the US in 2009. In the meantime, you can hear clips of the album on MySpace and order it from iTunes, EMusic, Rhapsody, et cetera… or physical CDs via Estradasphere’s Lobefood mail order should be coming soon (not yet, though).\n\nThe band is:\n\nDjé de Vence (Jérome Simond)-Clavier/Sequencer/Accordion\n\nB’hz (cédric Benard)-Drum\n\nCyro (Cyril Torres)-Guitar/back vocal/kazoo\n\nMina (Jasmina Barra)-Bass/vocal\n\nPedral (Pierre Lacasa)-Lead vocal/mandolin\n\nOn the web:\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/vladimirbozar\n\nhttp://www.sonicbids.com/epk/epk.aspx?epk_id=179208\n\nhttp://www.estradasphere.com/ (their recording buddies)\n\n~Dan – np: Frank Zappa – One Shot Deal\n\nNo, this isn’t about magicians pulling rabbits out of hats… or scientists (pulling habits out of rats?). This post is all about Mr. George Hrab (aka “Geo”).\n\nI found Geo’s podcast last October. It quickly shot up to being one of my favorite podcasts, then I got his CDs from CDBaby (I♥CDBaby), and I loved his music even more. He’s got a love for Frank Zappa and the Talking Heads, interesting fauna, science, skepticism (of woo-woo and other things), big band arrangements, great drumming, humor in music, seriousness in music, constant learning / teaching (reading through his liners, that’s apparent), and maintaining all around professionalism as a musician. He has his own music plus he drums (& conducts the bidness end of things) for the Philadelphia Funk Authority.\n\nAnyway, via his podcasts, he puts out about an album’s worth of comedy & rockin’ gold every week… for free. Every Thursday morning, it’s on my “must listen now” rotation, no matter how big my backlog of other podcasts may be.\n\nGeo’s Podcast RSS:\n\nGeo’s Podcast on iTunes (FYI… podcasts are free):\n\nGeo’s also a big dork. I say that in the good way. He recently wrapped up his “Occasional Songs for the Periodic Table” songs… 118 elements… 75 minutes (or so). Some great stuff… the songs / the lyrics\n\nHis CDs are great… and his packaging on them is superb. He puts a lot of thought into the unique way that he packages each one. From the sprawling art of Minutæ, the tin case and prescription look and feel of Vitriol, the textbook / field study guide arrangement of Coelacanth, and the sleek dualism of Interrobang?!.\n\nA clever, Brady Bunch-ish video for “The Assumption” from Interrobang?! “The Assumption” is sort of indicative of his pop music side, but he also gets funky, rocky, proggy, instrumental and vocal songs, et cetera on his records.\n\nSample some of his other songs on iTunes or CDBaby (samples in both venues). Some of my favs from each album…\n\n[sic] (1996) “[sic]” (#10)\n\nMinutiæ (1999) “Minutiæ (Sheer Brick AM)” (#12)\n\nVitriol (2001) “Monkey Hip Dysplasia” (#1)\n\nCoelacanth (2003) “The Coelacanth Sighs” (#8 )\n\nInterrobang?! (2006) “Who Dogs the Outlet” (#12)\n\nHis book, called Non-Coloring Book, is compiled from blog posts, podcast bits, and additional new material is also quite funny. I got it on Lulu.com via the PDF version for only $3.95. It’s also available as a physical book (for slightly more).\n\nAnyway, this is my “I love George Hrab” post. Soon, you’ll write your own “I love George Hrab” post, I’m sure.\n\nhttp://www.geologicrecords.net/ (his record company)\n\nhttp://www.geologicpodcast.com/ (his podcast)\n\nhttp://www.georgehrab.com/ (his blog)\n\nhttp://www.phillyfunk.com/ (his funk band)\n\nenzi savant ian,\n\n~Dan – np: Stan Getz – Big Band Bossa Nova\n\nI usually head down early to Eugene’s Farmers’ Market / Saturday Market for good local veg… then sometimes, if there’s good music scheduled, I make my way back in the afternoon…\n\nHere are my 2008‘s catches, in descending chronological order (updated as they happen -or- as I remember to write about them)…\n\n▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫\n\nMay 17th: Pojama People (http://www.myspace.com/glennleonard) Good thing they had a tagline on the poster at Saturday Market; otherwise, there’s no way I’d head back out in the heat (it was bloody hot today). The tagline was something along the lines of “the music of Frank Zappa.”\n\nI found a spot in the shade (thankfully)… I bought an ice cream sandwich (which ended up being a totally messy pile of yum)… I sat down and took in some Zappa and Zappa-inspired tunes (a not as messy pile of yum). They are made up of Alli Bach on percussion, winds, vocals; Glenn Leonard on drums (and a 13-yo student, Spencer Ewing, very capably sat in a few tunes, too); Brian Casey on bass; Ted Clifford on keys; and B-Bo on guitar. Per some webpages, they also sometimes have Ike Willis sing with them sometimes, too… cool.\n\nThey played a lot of instrumental songs, and they also played some Zappa tunes with lyrics with “liberty taken to them” — almost all politically bent (which is fine with me… and likely Zappa). Here’s what they played (thanks to Glenn for the setlist corrections)…\n\nZoot Allures\n\nArrogant Dubya Son (new lyrics to FZ’s “Idiot Bastard Son“)\n\nHelp, I’m Iraq (new lyrics to FZ’s “Help, I’m a Rock“)\n\nRDNZL\n\nDuke of Prunes\n\nEat That Tin Kong (a mashup of “Eat That Question” & “King Kong“)\n\nSofa\n\nIf I Fell (Beatles)\n\nYou Are What You Is / Dupree’s Paradise / Improv\n\nAlien Orifice / Tribute to American Idol (new lyrics to FZ’s “Tinsel Town Rebellion“)\n\nMcCain (new lyrics to Clapton’s “Cocaine“)\n\nLet’s Make Blackwater Turn Back (new lyrics to FZ’s “Let’s Make the Water Turn Black“)\n\nVillage of the Sun / Achidna’s Arf / Don’t You Ever Wash That Thing? (with “13“)\n\nThey’re playing at Sam Bonds Garage on June 28th. If I’m free, I hope to see them again. They were good (ie- not your usual cover band).\n\n▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫◊○●◘◦◘●○◊▫\n\nMay 3rd: Big Roy and the Twigs (http://www.myspace.com/bigroyandthetwigs) I went to see Big Roy because I know him via the head of the accounting department at UofO, Steve Matsunaga (Roy is Steve’s son). I heard some of their tunes on MySpace, and figured, “what the hell.” I showed up, and they had already started their set. It was hot (not bloody hot), but I caught 4 or 5 songs. They had some decent chops, alas, all I really remember is that they seemed to play a lot of alt-rock covers (Red Hot Chili Peppers’ songs appeared at least twice). It would have been nice to hear some of their originals, too. I was melting; so I headed back to the car. Nice set, though. Hopefully I can catch ’em again sometime…\n\n~Dan"
