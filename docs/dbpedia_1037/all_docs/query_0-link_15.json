        "text": ".\n\nAfter a first listen of Little Dots, I already have the feeling that it will remain in my audioscape for a long time. And listening to the Petit Wazoo band back again after a few years, I recalled a 2011 Italian press article: Luca Conti, Frank Zappa: lo strano odore del jazz, Musica Jazz n. 5 (maggio 2011). Or FZ: the funny smell of jazz.\n\nLuca Conti, now director of the Italian monthly magazine Musica Jazz, has been so kind the let this blog share his article that gives interesting context information related to the early seventies jazz scene, and properly focuses on the relatioship between Zappa and his musicians, and between Zappa and jazz.\n\nPlease click THIS LINK for the Italian version, an English translation follows.\n\n.\n\nLuca Conti\n\nFrank Zappa: lo strano odore del jazz\n\nMusica Jazz n. 5 (maggio 2011)\n\nZappa had a dream and he probably ended up confessing it in one of his various interviews too: he could do without musicians, a human category that he despised with all his might since 1969 – that is since the disbanding of the Mothers of Invention – making use of them just because, in a very Ellingtonian way, he needed someone to perform his compositions. Judging from the direction he had taken for some time at the time of his death (1993), and considering the huge progress that information technology applied to music was going through, such a course was widely feasible.\n\nZappa has always been obsessively pursuing absolute perfection, uncompromising to the point of self-destructiveness when dealing with performance mistakes (his own, but also and especially those of his musicians), relentless in demanding hundred and ten percent from those who wanted to play with him (as handed down through dozens of anecdotes about his legendary auditions), and above all convinced that music that cannot be performed does not exist: when the human element fails machines enter the stage.\n\nAll this could not obviously come out in favor of an untroubled and easygoing relationship with the musicians he hired to perform extraordinarily difficult scores, enough to convince him that in the long run he could probably do without musicians, flesh and blood. In 1982, the purchase of a Synclavier – a truly expensive system that served as a digital synthesizer and sampler – allowed him to implement his old plan: to do everything by himself replacing the human element with technology (or even better: making technology human; so to eliminate every mistake, absolutely).\n\nSuch an approach would seem, at least in theory, the exact antithesis of that commonly used in jazz, although since 1941 – in The Sheik Of Araby – Sidney Bechet certainly did not hesitate to overdub clarinet, soprano and tenor saxophone, piano, bass and drums, just as Lennie Tristano career long tape manipulations are well-known.\n\nAnd it is quite remarkable that Zappa has decided to name his first full Synclavier album (apart from a song, and excluding an implausible baroque divertissement such as Francesco Zappa) precisely Jazz From Hell as to highlight such a dichotomy even more. There is not much jazz in Jazz From Hell actually, at least not much jazz as usually taken: however we find the evident intention to tame the machine, to bend its sound characteristics to an outcome as much natural as possible, with no need to deal with idiosyncrasies of real musicians, mostly source of problems if not trouble from his point of view.\n\nThe comparison with Tristano is not as out of place as it might appear: in a totally surprising way, theoretically too. We know the diatribes that occurred at that time between the pianist – who claimed the creative legitimacy of his editing interventions with pre-recorded rhythm tracks – and the critics who quite explicitly accused him to “cheat”: people do not care much to listen to music, rather to compete with it, that was the Tristano bitter conclusion. Almost identical words to those used by Zappa in 1990, after he overdubbed new rhythm sections for some of his historical album for their reissue on CD: “I’m actually flattered that people are listening that closely to the albums, but what’s disturbing me is that they’re listening to the production more than the music.” (Frank Zappa Discusses Upcoming CD Projects by Pete Howard, ICE, September & October, 1990).\n\nOne example among many: Rubber Shirt released in ’79 in Sheik Yerbouti, perhaps the most selling Zappa album. Undoubtedly a typical jazz performance: a dialogue less than three-minute long between bass (Patrick O’Hearn) and drums (Terry Bozzio) defined by Zappa himself an example of “sensitive, interesting interplay.” Remarkably, such a duet never took place, although Bozzio and O’Hearn had been in Zappa’s touring band for a long time.\n\nAccording to the album liner notes, the song have been created starting from a live 1974 4/4 guitar solo, upon which O’Hearn overdubbed a new bass part (“not completely an improvised “bass solo”,” Zappa hastens to point out). After that, the new bass line has been used with the drums track of a completely different song, a piece in 11/4 that had nothing to do with the previous one. Therefore the guitar solo is disappeared, and we can listen to O’Hearn and Bozzio simultaneously improvising on different pieces (and at different times).\n\nAs a matter of fact, Tristano pursued the same procedure on his first Atlantic album, where Peter Ind and Jeff Morton rhythm section came from different performances from those later completed with the piano (Ind himself relates about it in his book Jazz Visions: Lennie Tristano and his Legacy, Equinox Books 2005). Of course, we can ask ourselves what was Zappa purpose while undertaking such an operation. Perhaps Bozzio and O’Hearn, musicians with a strong jazz background (the bass player had been a Gary Peacock student for many years and together with Bozzio had extensively played with the likes of Joe Henderson and Julian Priester), would have been able to simultaneously improvise each one at a different tempo, however Zappa was convinced of the contrary. “You can ask [your musicians] for it, but it won’t happen,” he said to Bob Marshall in 1988, “Suppose you were a composer […], there’s only one way to hear that, and that’s to do what I did.” As we can see, it is the same philosophy of Tristano.\n\nAnother significant example of the Zappa poetics concerns Inca Roads, one of the cornerstones of his entire career. The original version (different from the one included in 1975 in One Size Fits All) has been released in 1996 in The Lost Episodes and has been recorded 1973 with Jean-Luc Ponty, George Duke, Ralph Humphrey, Bruce and Tom Fowler, Ian and Ruth Underwood. After a long exposition, a truly complicated theme leaves room for trombone, flute and marimba solos; if it is not jazz pure and simple, we would like to know what it is. In fact, the first signs of this piece begin to appear since 1969, in the guitar solo of Holiday In Berlin, Full Blown; however, what is truly unique is how the solos performed on Inca Roads during the February 1979 London concerts then become, in the hands of Zappa, the starting material for at least three songs with different titles, all included in the double CD Shut Up ‘N Play Yer Guitar (originally three different vinyl records). And we can go on and on.\n\nApparently the relationship between Zappa and jazz seems to have always been intermittent, concentrated in periods in which the jazz component has been really emphasized, reduced instead when rock has been the main language (for instance with the bands of the first half of the eighties). We suspect that such an understanding has been pursued and induced by Zappa himself by releasing, while alive, a deliberately confusing official discography.\n\nThanks to the advent of the CD, to the Rykodisc reprint of Zappa’s entire opus as “approved by the artist” versions – as already mentioned, often with new mixes and overdubs coming from historical material – and also thanks to the publication of a series of studio and live unreleased recordings, it has finally begun clear that the jazz practice has belong to the entire career of the Master from Baltimore, not really in a concealed way, making it impossible not to consider him also a jazz musician, among his various qualifications. Indeed we believe that, in some respects, Zappa has always wanted to conceal the most obvious features of his interest for jazz, not that much in terms of habits, rather for specific jazz characteristics, to avoid being locked into a cage destined to stay around him tightly. So his jazz incursions have always been seeded sparingly throughout his albums, dropped as Hop-o’-My-Thumb stones to indicate one of many possible paths within a monumental and largely to be explored opus.\n\nFor a long time it has been believed that very well-known albums such as Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, both from 1972, represented the most clear point of contact between Zappa and jazz. In September of that year (confined to a wheelchair having being thrown in an orchestra pit by a deranged man) Zappa had left on tour with a remarkably large band: six brasses, six winds, keyboards, vibraphone and marimba, two guitars, cello, bass, drums and percussion. After the Hollywood Bowl opening concert, the band had flown to Europe for four shows (one of which was canceled) before returning to the US for other performances. The last concert, on September 24 in Boston, has been released on CD as Wazoo in 2007 only, it is an impressive document of the group sound and performance power (why it has remained unreleased for thirty-five years remains a mystery).\n\nAlso, we would say that it should be a must for any serious big band fan, since it completely belongs to those contemporary experiments conducted by Don Ellis and composers-arrangers like Hank Levy during that very period. Among other things, in those times, most of the musicians that play in Wazoo went in and out from Ellis Orchestra, but also from those of Stan Kenton and Gerald Wilson, as well as some of them would have been part of Blood Sweat & Tears, for example: Tom Malone, Glen Ferris, Mike Altschul, Jay Migliori, Earle Dumler, Ray Reed, Charles Owens, Ken Shoroyer and still others.\n\nHaving concluded this tour (economically disastrous), Zappa instantly left again for a second round of concerts, much longer – three months – and with a “portable” version of the former monstrous band: ten musicians, including him, all from the Grand Wazoo band plus trumpeter Gary Barone, yet another veteran from the California jazz scene and an old Shelly Manne pal. The new group had been re-baptised, no doubt, Petit Wazoo (however in retrospect, or so it seems) and a selection of their performances has been released on CD a few years back only (Imaginary Diseases, 2006).\n\nBarone himself recalls that – during that tour – Zappa used to go to any jam session in the city after the concerts, right because, according to him, he was interested into diving – in his way – into the jazz environment, precisely as he had done in 1969 when, invited to Belgium to present the Actuel Festival organized by Byg, he found himself playing – as well as with Pink Floyd and the Caravan – with the Art Ensemble Of Chicago, with the Archie Shepp group (which included, among others, Philly Joe Jones and Grachan Moncur) and with the rhythm section of the Chris McGregor Group, namely Johnny Dyani and Louis Moholo.\n\nThe Grad Wazoo band will appear again in 1975, under the deranged moniker of Abnuceals Emuukha Electric Orchestra, for a series of studio recordings and, in September, for a notorious concert at the Royce Hall in Los Angeles; in December 1976 Zappa will perform live in New York with his regular band augmented with the likes of Randy and Michael Brecker, Ronnie Cuber, Lou Marine and Dave Samuels, while in 1988 he will focus on his last world tour – that would bring him close to an economic meltdown – with one of the most versatile and phantasmagorical bands of his whole career, that could face any genre and any arrangement with supreme ease. A band well represented on disc (Broadway the Hard Way, Make a Jazz Noise Here, The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life), but seriously undermined by relationship problems between some of the members.\n\nApparently, Zappa was so disappointed by the pugnacity and the infantilism of many of his musicians to convince himself once and for all that he could do without musicians, sure he had to. And we will always remain curious to know if two of the greatest manipulators of men in the history of modern music, that is Ellington and Zappa – who met in person in 1969 during a festival organized by George Wein – they had never discussed such an issue. Perhaps they would have agreed.\n\n.\n\nThe 1988 Bob Marshall interview is available through Wiki Jawaka, while the Gary Barone interview mentioned by Luca Conti has been conducted by Charles Ulrich: An Interview with Petit Wazoo Trumpeter Gary Barone. This latter interview is part of the The Petit Wazoo Tour web pages, a nice place to raise your FZ in 1972 knowledge up!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFrom the facebook “About” page of “The Broadcast Adventures of HowieZowie”:\n\n“Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie” is a weekly two hour Zappa radio show broadcasting Thursday night at 10pm PST on Blue Mountain Radio KQBM-LP 103.7FM in West Point, California & KQBM 90.7FM in San Andreas, California – streaming live at http://www.kqbm.org. Saturday night at Midnight EST on WERU 89.9FM in Blue Hill, Maine/99.9FM in Bangor, Maine – streaming live/archiving at http://www.weru.org. Encore Saturday night at 11pm PST on Blue Mountain Radio KQBM-LP 103.7FM in West Point, California & KQBM 90.7FM in San Andreas, California – streaming live at http://www.kqbm.org.\n\nHere is the WERU Community Radio direct link to the Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie archive page (only the last two episodes are available): click here.\n\nHowie Zowie, aka Howie Kittelson, is a London (Ontario) based radio personality with a taste for audio editing. He accurately selects music for the talk over sections of his shows, and with Zappa the result is remarkable! A two hours radio show like Conceptual Continuity with HowieZowie conveniently flows and you may get some CC clue.\n\nOn July 28, 2016 such an all Zappa show got 5 years old, Howie Zowie had Joe Travers as a guest and Spastic Droopers as secret word.\n\nJoe talked about The Crux of Biscuit / Frank Zappa for President new FZ releases and gives some cool hints for the releases to come, such as a Waka/Wazoo box set!\n\nWhat follows is a transcript of some parts of the conversation Howie and Joe had (thank you Howie for the accurate editing of my raw transcript!).\n\n29:47 (part 1) – Overture to Uncle Sam\n\nJoe Travers: It was for and in an Opera, and definitely was one of the later synclavier pieces of Frank’s – very very late in fact. We found some footage of Todd Yvega and Spencer Chrislu being interviewed for the American Composer radio documentary that happened in 1995.\n\nAnd they used that piece as a demonstration for the Synclavier at the time, so it was definitely one of the later pieces. And we founded it on a reel of Ensemble Modern rehearsals and performances that ended up becoming Everything is Healing Nicely.\n\nBut Frank put together a 40 minutes collage of that that audio, lot of stuff on the rehearsals and I think Spence based most of what he, what Frank put together for Everything is Healing Nicely, but also on it it was the Overture to Uncle Sam.\n\nI always kept that thing in my back pocket for some kind of release. Gail and I have talked about various different releases including that piece and then when Frank Zappa for President was offered to me as a project I really thought like that it would be a good thing to put it on there. And so that’s how ended up happening!\n\n46:43 (part 1) – If I was a President\n\nHowie Kittelson: I see that the musical track and the spoken words were done in different times, were they meant to go together from the beginning or is that something that you combined?\n\nJT: No, that’s something I combined.\n\nHK: In that aspect it is very reminiscent of Drooling Midrange Accountans in Easter Hay.\n\nJT: That was something Dweezil put together, obviously the same concept was used for the If I was a President thing.\n\n1:56 (part 2) – Brown Shoes Don’t Make It\n\nHK: I see that was a remix done in ’69 by Dick Kunk, correct?\n\nJT: Yes\n\nHK: Now, what was the purpose of that remix, what is that associated with?\n\nJT: We’ll never know. It is not listed as such, although my opinion is that it was probably remixed for some kind of film project.\n\nHZ: Gotcha.\n\nJT: But we don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it was Uncle Meat – I don’t know what that film project would be. But there’s a couple of other classic songs on that reel that were remix as well, so Brown Shoes is not the only one. But considering the theme of that song, I thought that it would be a good thing to put it on that album, because it’s an older Mothers song in a remixed form that nobody has ever heard before. So I figured that it would tie in with that record.\n\n3:27 (part 2) – Amnerika\n\nJT: It was recorded during the Thing-Fish sessions – and all I can say is that piece, the vocal version of that song was intended for one of the volumes of The Lost Episodes project, because The Lost Episodes one time was kind of worked into a three volume project. Ans since Frank brought The Lost Episodes down to one disc, then there was a bunch of leftovers and that happened to be one of the leftovers. We do have the ability to do another Lost Episodes volume from those leftovers, but Gail was basically using a lot of stuff from that for other projects, or at least wanted me to. So, I figured – well this is the perfect time for this song for this project. I have to come up with content somehow, even if we kind of repeat things maybe once in a while in future releases, at least I was able to do what I was told and putting together that Frank Zappa for President record, so that’s where that song ended up!\n\n19:23 (part 2) – The Crux of the Biscuit\n\nHK: I have always wondered to myself: was the use of apostrophe in so many blues song titles, could that have been an inspiration on Frank when he came to the apostrophe?\n\nJT: Hmmmm, I don’t know – I’m not sure. I wish I could answer that (laughs).\n\nHZ: Do you have your own theory about the apostrophe?\n\nJT: I really don’t know (laughs), Dweezil kind of explains The Crux of the Biscuit on dweezilzappaworld.com – I think, as far as like the term, what that means, what the apostrophe stands for – so you can check that out.\n\n29:20 (part 2) – Apostrophe (‘) early side one – Cosmik Debris\n\nHK: The version of Cosmik Debris that opens that – the new 2016 intro, is that your doing?\n\nJT: No, that was found that way and the mix of the song is the exact same mix that’s on the Apostrophe(‘) album, Frank took up that intro, and so when I found that early sequence of side one, that intro was on the version of Cosmik Debris on that tape, so I left it. Anything different applies to those kind of releases, that was Frank – that was recorded that way!\n\n34:38 (part 2) – work mixes\n\nHZ: So, when we’re looking at the tracks that are labeled as mix outtakes. Those are just working mixes from the process of doing the record?\n\nJT: Yeah, exactly. Like you have a mix session and during the mix session you run off various work mixes or mixes in progress, or mixes that might be used as a master – or might not be. Anything that was mixed and was going to be on master at one point would be an alternate mix, because that was alternate to what was used. But anything that was mixed that wasn’t going to be used for any kind of a master, but it was a work mix or an outtake for the mix session, I just labelled as such.\n\n35:26 (part 2) – Uncle Remus\n\nJT: Yeah, that’s pretty great! Because you get to hear a piano solo and an extra bit of vocals and stuff like that, it was pretty cool!\n\nHZ: And some cool organ – I don’t know if that was a B-3, but there was some really tasty, traditional organ going on there that I am not used to hearing in that song.\n\nJT: Yeah – well, that song was recorded during demo sessions of George Duke during the Paramount Studio time period in April of ’72. The Grand Wazoo and Waka- Jawaka have just been recorded and Frank produced about four tunes for George Duke around that time and Uncle Remus was one of those songs – and then Frank obviously used Uncle Remus in Apostrophe(‘). Then George Duke went on to re-record the other songs that were recorded for that demo session on two other albums. Psychosomatic Dung is one of them, and For Love (I Come Your Friend) – that’s another one that’s one of those songs that was recorded during that demo session.\n\n36:41 (part 2) – Waka-Jawaka / Grand Wazoo box set\n\nJT: I’m going to be working on a Hot Rats/Grand Wazoo box set, I guess you might want to call it – or a CD release of all the alternates and all the stuff that was recorded during that time period. And I am hoping to get those George Duke tunes on there as well, so that would be something cool. Yeah, it’s Waka Jawaka and Grand Wazoo, sorry – Hot Rats was not recorded during that same time. You know, obviously that was ’69. But Waka and Grand Wazoo that was all recorded at the same time, and along with those George Duke songs it kind of captures the same musicians, the same time period and the same sound. So, all that stuff would be a good companion release.\n\n41:50 (part 2) – Energy Frontier flute\n\nJT: I tried to track down who would have been, but nobody knows! Maybe the fans somehow can get that information – because they’re so hard core. I was unable to determine it because there were no session sheets, and so it’s hard for me to know. And I had a conversation with Dave Parlato. Dave Parlato played bass in the Petite Wazoo time period, and The Grand Wazoo – and recorded some stuff with Frank. And he is the guy who is playing stand-up bass on those songs – or at least on one version of that song. And so Dave and I had a conversation, and he is the one that identified himself on there. And he talked about the Jack Bruce session, talked about how Jack Bruce had a rented…I think it was a cello, and it sounded horrible and he couldn’t make the thing work at all, so they kind of ditched that idea of having Jack Bruce play cello. But, Dave didn’t know who played flute either. And first thing I thought of was it had to have been maybe somebody who was touring with Frank at the time. But in the Petite Wazoo the only person that maybe could have done that was Earl Dumler, and we’re not really sure he was him or not. And I didn’t get a chance to get in touch with Earl before the release of the record. So – maybe he is him, maybe he is not. Who knows!\n\n43:31 (part 2) – bass lines\n\nHZ: I found it pretty interesting listening to Dave Parlato’s bass line on take four of Energy Frontier because I’ve gotten quite used to a lot of brass bands using the tuba to do bass lines and they kind of emulate the phrasing of a stand-up bass – but he sounded like he was playing tuba lines on the stand-up bass! So it was a very interesting part of the spectrum and part of the mix that he was in and that stood out to me. I read somewhere that Dave Parlato is the originator of the “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow” phrase – that he looked out the window of the tour bus and he saw a dog peeing in the snow and he yelled out, “Don’t eat the yellow snow!”\n\nJT: Well I don’t know if that’s true – that could be very true. I don’t know. But, I do know that the bass line if you listen very close to the song called Trudging Across Tundra which is on One Shot Deal, that is an improvisation that happened during a concert in the Petite Wazoo time period… and if you listen to the bass line of that, and if you listen to the early version of Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow that was released on Crux, you’ll notice that it’s almost the same! So the root of the bass line to the opening of Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow come from an improvisational jam from the Petite Wazoo time period, which we released.\n\n49:02 (part 2) – Vaultmaster since 1995\n\nJT: I love my job, I’m very grateful for it. I spent so much time in my life just studying the music and being part of the music – so I’m happy that I can share the things that I find with people that appreciate it, you know? It’s really a special thing that I do and I realize that. I was a fan first before any of this stuff, so I come from a fan point of view and I think about the things that people would love to hear and would really want to hear.\n\n51:28 (part 2) – Uncle Meat Project/Object and vinyl reissues\n\nJT: The Uncle Meat Project/Object is gonna be coming right around the corner pretty soon, so that’s very exciting. And also there’s going to be a lot of vinyl reissues this year, starting next month in August Hot Rats is going to be re-released on vinyl. But we’re going to be doing a lot more this year. We usually do about one to two releases – reissues on vinyl for the past few years, along with little exclusive stuff that we’ve done for the Record Store Days. But this year we’re gonna be doing a lot more – and that does include the Record Store Day stuff. So, we’ll be doing something really cool for Black Friday Record Store Day and we’re gonna be doing a number of other vinyl reissues this year before the year’s over with. So that’s something that’s gonna be exciting…for the audiophile world, you know, that loves the vinyl.\n\n54:40 (part 2) – just one Zappa piece of choice for The Vaultmaster\n\nJT: Rat Tomago\n\n.\n\nThe 1995 Radio documentary mentioned by Joe was available at the zappa.com and was described as: “a two hour Radio Documentary produced by Steve Rowland and Gail Zappa for “The Music Makers” Series on Public Radio International, originally aired on U.S. radio in the summer of 1996.”\n\nWhat follows is a direct link for the first hour of the show, the first minute of Overture to Uncle Sam starts at 08:08.\n\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/483513/1995TheMusicMakers_FZ/zappa_americancomposer01.mp3\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOut of the blue, on June 9, while many had been pondering about trustees and beneficiaries of the Zappa integrity and of his overwhelming and strangely managed output, ZFT trustees announced the world, including beneficiaries of any sort, two new releases due to July 15.\n\nFrank Zappa for President? You betcha! We know at various times he wanted to run for office. In the spirit of the dramatic 2016 presidential election adventures comes a release that gives us a glimpse into what could have been. This album is comprised of unreleased compositions realized on the Synclavier, along with other relevant tracks mined from the Vault, with a political thread tying it all together. Don’t forget to register and vote!\n\nThe Crux of the Biscuit was created in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of Frank Zappa’s 1974 album Apostrophe(‘). As part of Zappa Records’ ongoing Frank Zappa Project/Object Audio Documentary Series, it contains rare alternate mixes, live performances, and studio session outtakes. This release celebrates Zappa’s iconic, Gold-certified album, which landed in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart.\n\nsource: zappa.com\n\n.\n\nUnreleased synclavier compositions, never heard before mixes of ’60s and ’70s classics, nuggets that shed new light on the studio compositional process, live episodes relevant to two basic themes: the President of the USA and 42 years of trudging across the tundra.\n\nIn summary: succulent!\n\nHowever from the outer FZ space perspective, I can’t help feeling still scary of the future, and I do hope the Zappas will be able to continue digging the vault, and I also hope the “cease and desist” nightmare will not happen as it does in the darkest canyons of my mind.\n\nBut forget about this mess for a couple of hours, take a deep breath and immerse in these two albums.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit\n\n1 Cosmik Debris 4:21\n\n2 Uncle Remus (Mix Outtake) 3:59\n\n3 Down In De Dew (Alternate Mix) 3:16\n\n4 Apostrophe’ (Mix Outtake) 9:07\n\n5 The Story Of “Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast” 2:25\n\n6 Don’t Eat The Yellow Snow/St. Alphonzo’s Pancake Breakfast (Live) 19:26\n\n7 Excentrifugal Forz (Mix Outtake) 1:34\n\n8 Energy Frontier (Take 4) 3:04\n\n9 Energy Frontier (Take 6 With Overdubs) 4:15\n\n10 Energy Frontier (Bridge) 8:23\n\n11 Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) 5:11\n\n12 Don’t Eat The Yellow (Basic Tracks-Alternate Take) 2:12\n\n13 Nanook Rubs It (Basic Tracks-Outtake) 0:42\n\n14 Nanook Rubs It (Session Outtake) 0:48\n\n15 Frank’s Last Words . . . 0:16\n\nProduced by Gail Zappa and Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment and audio transfers by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Bob Ludwig\n\nNew mixes: Craig Parker Adams, 2014\n\nCover photograph: Yoram Kahana (probably) [uncredited]\n\nOther photography: Emerson/Loew, Mark Aalyson, Jeffrey Mayer, Michael Mesker\n\nIllustration: David Calcano/Christian Garcia\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nPackage design: Michael Mesker\n\nLiner notes: Simon Prentis\n\nProduction Manager: Melanie Starks\n\n.\n\nFor most listeners, Apostrophe(‘) is mainly the place where snow is yellow and feet stink. Also, the Bromhidrosis epic is where THE question arises: “What is your Conceptual Continuity?” Since the easy to be seen answer is “The crux of the biscuit is the Apostrophe(‘)”, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of one of the best known FZ albums without Stink-foot – hence without Fido who will eternally bring those stink-fated slippers and gives THE answer – is like giving praise to Don Quixote not mentioning Sancho.\n\nLet’s commemorate such conspicuous absence with the commercial that inspired a distinguished dog-man relationship (relevant scene at 0:17):\n\n.\n\nThat said, The Crux Of The Biscuit is a must for hard-core fanatics due to plenty exquisite episodes, and may have a lot of interest for the rest of the world, for instance for the main Yellow Snow celebration, almost 20 minutes live from Hordern Pavillon, Sydney, June 1973, a tape that should become road, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe album, possibly the last produced by Gail and Joe, starts with a proto Apostrophe(‘) side A (tracks 1-4) whose main interest is the dynamic duo Down in the Dew/Apostrophe’, new to mankind as a dual system. Simon Prentis, who delivered a truly relevant piece of zappology as liner notes, gives information and his own view about Energy Frontier, the original title of such a double jam sessions. Simon quotes a well-known Zappa statement:\n\nQ: What about playing with (bass guitarist) Jack Bruce on Apostrophe?\n\nFZ: Well, that was just a jam thing that happened because he was a friend of (drummer) Jim Gordon. I found it very difficult to play with him; he’s too busy. He doesn’t really want to play the bass in terms of root functions; I think he has other things on his mind. But that’s the way jam sessions go.\n\n“Frank Zappa”\n\nBy Steve Rosen\n\nGuitar Player, January, 1977\n\n.\n\nThen he reports (via joe Travers) that those Dew/Apostrophe’ jams were all recorded on November 8, 1972, also with an unknown flute player on tracks 8 and 9. As effectively remarked by Prentis, the subsequent work has been an editing matter, that night after night shortened Jack Bruce contribution and brought Down in the Dew out (later to emerge for Läther without Jack Bruce in a version near to track 3). What is presented here (proto tracks 3 and 4, and jam tracks 8-10) is the evidence of a process that started with a jam session, continued with a proto dual system (with Bruce in Apostrophe’ only) and ended as we know it simply as Apostrophe’. Thanks to this album, now we know better why Zappa said that Bruce was “busy”, it seems that such a one-day encounter didn’t give what could be theoretical expected in terms of interplay, but the way the bass guitar of Jack Bruce sounds in these unreleased jams is gorgeous (a FZ post-production?) and some of his lines are truly remarkable (like those delivered into the first minute of the original Apostrophe’ – and of track 4 – that give a clear mark to that jam).\n\nSo editing as a major Zappa craft and practice, and “omission” as a keyword to guide the transition from the on-field recorded matter to the edited recorded object to be released. That is one the main subjects of the liner notes, fully available through simonprentis.net, a must read!\n\nAnd omission is at work within lyrics too, significance is often hidden or lies on a metaphoric level, or may be even almost faint in cases when information is delivered for conceptual continuity purpose only.\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit, and its liner notes, brought this blog to closely consider the mysterious and elliptic lyrics for Excentrifugal Forz (a Mix Outtake belongs to this album too) and hopefully get nearer to some of the omitted points.

Cosmik Debris (track 1) opens with an unheard before brass intro. This version of Uncle Remus includes new and not to be missed Ikettes embroideries, but also further gorgeous George keyboard treatments. Apostrophe’ (mix outtake) shares the drum intro with Stink-foot (the only link discovered so far with the Fido song). The two Energy Frontier takes are two different Down in Dew versions with Jack Bruce, Energy Frontier (Bridge) is actually an early version of Apostrophe’. Cosmik Debris (Basic Tracks-Take 3) includes a new bluesy FZ solo and is a no vocals version to be sang to!\n\nThe Crux Of The Biscuit starts dealing with Yellow Snow with the words of FZ introducing this new piece in 1973. He tells how he was also inspired by an Imperial Margarine commercial, “Good morning, your highness!” comes from it. Unfortunately only a bad quality recording of such a promotional feature survives into the Internet, but it is worth watching anyway (the “black gentleman” commercial starts at 01:02).\n\n.\n\nMargarine inspired also the 1973 Mar-Juh-Rene routine, well-known but officially released only in 2008 in One Shot Deal as part of Australian Yellow Snow. This routine is also included here in track 6 which is an extended version of the Yellow Snow suite, also including Rollo and part of the Steno Pool section of Greggery Peccary. Both versions derive from the June 24-26, 1973 Sydney concerts, once again, road one please!\n\nIn his Zappa dissertation, Tomasz Michalak digs into significance and symbols related to the apostrophe and hyphen (“something that might be used for erotic gratification by a very desperate stenographer”) signs. He also quotes FZ who recalls a linguistic inspiration for Yellow Snow in two different interviews:\n\nI had a conversation in approximately 1972 with a schoolteacher in Kansas. She taught English. And she was talking about the way language works. And her point was that any language develops for a culture based on the things that the culture needs to talk about. And as an example she said in Eskimo language they have, you know, a whole number of different words for snow because snow is their life. And she was the one who said maybe they even have something for yellow snow, which you wouldnít want to eat it. And thatís what gave me the idea. (FZ, interviewed by Jim Ladd, August 1, 1989)\n\nAnd:\n\nas an example she talked about the Eskimo language, which she said had twenty words for snow because it was so important to them. And she actually made the comment that probably in the Eskimo language there was some sort of warning for children not to eat yellow snow. And thatís where the idea came from. (FZ, interviewed by Allan Handelman, East Coast Live, June 6, 1993)\n\nQuoted (P.293) into\n\n“THE MEGAPHONE OF DESTINY-” COMPOSITION, VOICE, AND MULTITUDE IN THE AUDITORY AVANT-GARDE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: GERTRUDE STEIN, SAMUEL BECKETT, JOHN CAGE, AND FRANK ZAPPA\n\nTomasz Zbigniew Michalak\n\nA THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies (English Literature) THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (Vancouver)\n\nDecember 2013\n\n.\n\nThe album closes with three early snippets from the Yellow Snow suite and a last brief track with Frank stopping the tape. Very hard-core maniac type stuff with no commercial potential at all, enjoyable for a limited audience such as Rne who noticed in his “rudimentary notes” that “the marimba figure and the laughs that were inserted at the very end of “Father O’Blivion” in the Apostrophe (‘) album” are included in Frank’s Last Words… .\n\nFor the full story of the Yellow Snow suite I would recommend a brief article by Charles Ulrich hosted on the ARF web site: “Some notes on the Yellow Snow suites permutations”\n\nFinally the original artwork for the back of the CD inlay deserve to be mentioned. It’s a Zappa cereal box probably illustrated by David Calcano of Fantoons Animation Studio in Los Angeles. Here it is with some details (click the images to enlarge them).\n\n.\n\nFor further notes on the cover of the album refer to the Information Is Not Knowledge (IINK) web site, at the beginning of the Apostrophe (‘) notes page.\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nFrank Zappa For President\n\n1 Overture To “Uncle Sam” 15:16\n\n2 Brown Shoes Don’t Make It (Remix) 7:27\n\n3 Amnerika (Vocal Version) 3:10\n\n4 “If I Was President” 3:43\n\n5 When The Lie’s So Big 3:38\n\n6 Medieval Ensemble 6:31\n\n7 America The Beautiful (Bates/Ward; Traditional) 3:36\n\nProduced for release by Ahmet Zappa & Joe Travers\n\nVaultmeisterment, transfers and compilation by Joe Travers\n\nMastering: Gavin Lurssen & Reuben Cohen\n\nArt direction: Ahmet Zappa\n\nArt, layout: Keith Lawler\n\nProduction management: Melanie Starks\n\nCover art details available at the proper IINK web page.\n\n.\n\nIf The Crux of the Biscuit objective as an Audio Documentary is very well stated and accomplished (including omissions), with the support of informative and in-depth liner notes, Frank Zappa for President appears like an unglued sequence of nuggets and lush unreleased pieces joined together by a political thread that ends up to be too weak in absentia.\n\nAlso, from a hard-core fanatic perspective the album is full of interest beside the basic theme, but such material would have deserved more informative liner notes.\n\nTake Overture To “Uncle Sam” for instance, since this piece is in the repertoire of Ensemble Ascolta for the never released project Ascolta Plays Zappa, it would have been very interesting to hear their point of view about this composition dated 1993. And why not take them for a note to the other synclavier material included?\n\nPart of Overture To “Uncle Sam” has been premiered by the Ascolta ensemble at Radialsystem, Berlin, July 14, 2007 (the 0:00 – 4:49 section). An excerpt (2:35 – 4:49) is available through their web site.\n\nhttp://www.ascolta.de/_obj/698E13B0-FE70-4A57-A5DA-A9DF78121C89/inline/Uncle-Sam.mp3\n\n.\n\nThe version included here is ten minutes longer than the Ascolta one and features the sonic palette typical of the late FZ synclavier works that can be heard in Civilazion Phase III and Dance Me This. Also, Overture To “Uncle Sam” should have a close relationship with the Wolf Harbor suite. No link instead with Dio Fa (the abandoned FZ opera project) as elsewhere stated in this blog (the notes to the Berlin, July 14, 2007 Ascolta ensemble concert program led to this probably false conjecture: “planned as an overture to an opera for La Scala in Milan, world premiere”).\n\nTo focus on the right Uncle Sam / Wolf Harbor setting you should go back to the liner notes to Dance Me This:\n\nOver the years I had seen Frank jump from project to project often shelving one indefinitely to focus on another. There was an elaborate stage piece titled Dio Fa; An opera titled Uncle Sam (about a dystopian future America with a ludicrously polluted New York Harbour); A music notation book with accompanying audio disc titled The Rhythmic Sadist’s Guide to Drum Patterns for the 21st Century.\n\nTodd Yvega–\n\nIn his vision for a staged presentation for modern dance [FZ] described how he wanted to represent Wolf Harbor (do the research on this place which really does exist): Groups of dancers side by side would hold long rolled out lengths of black trash bags (think Hefty) and “wave” them at waist (waste) height to signify the dark and murky polluted waters of sludgy Wolf Harbor.\n\nGail Zappa–\n\n.\n\nA sort of unresolved melancholy in a suspended time environment is a feeling common to both compositions. The difference resides in how the tension ends up to be unresolved. In Wolf Harbor tension is low and everywhere, time is suspended, no resolution allowed.\n\nOverture To “Uncle Sam” features a main melodic (and melancholic) material used as opening and with some variations at 02:02, 05:58 and 11:08. Right after every variation tension grows and its resolution seems to happen when the listener recognizes the melodic material, but relief is denied when he realizes that melancholy is still there. The finale is true Zappa: tension grows again and closes with a sort of brief broadway hoopla!\n\nThe illusion of a resolution results to be more effective than no resolution at all!\n\nHoopla! back to 1966/1969, Frank Zappa for President brings the listener to a never heard before remixed version of Brown Shoes Don’t Make It, a pleasure for everyone, especially for those who spent countless time with this 1966 sonic movie and will recognize all details changed in this remix. Acoustic ensemble is often clearer and the overall sound image results spatially enriched. In this case also it would have been much interesting to know what was the purpose of such a 1969 remix. Rejected for the 1969 Mothermania (which included the 1966 mix)?\n\nNo particular questions to ask for Amnerika (Vocal Version), a well-known (for FZ tape traders) and beautiful unreleased Thing-Fish outtake that needed to be released. Maybe one: why it has been rejected?\n\n“If I Was President” is Zappa explaining in 1990 why he “wouldn’t campaign” but “file as a candidate of no party” with a 1985 synclavier background (for the full text transcript please refer to the relevant IINK web page). Was it a Zappa produced audio object?\n\nAn unreleased 1988 When The Lie’s So Big take follows, politics is of course the rationale for the inclusion, however the hard-core fanatic (the main audience for this album) attention declines, this version does not add zappology elements (except for some slight changes in the lyrics) and it does not give particular help to the flow of the program.\n\nFor the next Medieval Ensemble, an unreleased 1985 synclavier composition, attention is back. It sounds like a Jazz From Hell outtake, a long march with no resolution with a medieval flavor, could be used for the eternally postponed Terry Gilliam Don Quixote!\n\nThe album closes with another 1988 episode. The America The Beautiful version digitally (mp3 only) released in The Frank Zappa AAA·FNR·AAA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2008 Nice to have it in a good audio quality (but strangely different from the official 1988 releases), relevant to the main theme, but in an album of unreleased material and with a surprising 1969 mix of a classic, the role of this song is simply to close the curtain.\n\nNow I’m wondering, in an album like this, where politics in America is a theme sometimes loose (Medieval Ensemble?!?), why do not take advantage of the lines:\n\nCould result in the end\n\nTo a worrisome trend\n\nIn which every American\n\nNot “born again”\n\nCould be punished in cruel and unusual ways\n\nBy this treacherous cretin\n\nWho tells everyone\n\nThat he’s Jesus’ best friend\n\nto include another bundle nugget that unethically still remains unreleased in a lossless audio standard? I’m thinking to Treacherous Cretins from The Frank Zappa AAA·FNRAA·AA Birthday Bundle 21.Dec.2010, a killer version that needs to expand its audience.\n\nMoreover, can you spot any treacherous cretins somewhere in this 2016 USA campaign?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIn today’s rapidly changing world, ziblings appear almost every day with some new promotional device.\n\nSome of these devices have been known to leave irreparable scars on the minds of foolish old consumers.\n\nOne such case is seated behind this pages, yes, The Resentment Listener.\n\nThere is only one possible relief for scars such that: music. And I do hope there will be a lot of music from now on, before that Jabberwocky day when some sordid lawyer will suggest a cease and desist whatchamacallit that will silence the Big Note.\n\nIn the hope of a truly different outcome, let us get some blessed relief with a little known live period: Flo & Eddie, the 1970 embodiment.\n\n.\n\nThe Flo & Eddie Band, the so called FZ’s Vaudeville Band, is mainly known for two early 70’s releases (Fillmore East – June 1971, and Just Another Band From L.A.). For those who are familiar with the whole official discography, the body of such works grows with Playground Psychotics (a 1992 release). Also, you may want (and you should) consider posthumous releases, hence Carnegie Hall (a 2011 release). To complete the picture some tracks from YCDTOSA Vol.6 should be mentioned. However, with some very little exceptions (one of them strictly related to this release, later on this), all official recordings are from the 1971 Flo & Eddie Band, that was slightly different from that of the previous year: in 1971 Jim Pons and Don Preston replaced Jeff Simmons and George Duke.\n\n.\n\nCharles Ulrich’s “FZ’s Vaudeville Band” pages are a good place to focus on differences between 1970 and 1971 in terms of repertoire. As it can be seen in the “repertoire by tour” chart, in 1971 vocal numbers increased (Magdalena, the Sofa suite, Billy The Mountain, etc.) while listening to concert tapes you will realize that in 1970 instrumental material had larger room and included one grand instrumental more: Chunga’s Revenge (originally known as The Clap). Mudshark is an example of a piece of music that in 1970 was an instrumental section of Little House, while in 1971 become a Vaudeville number (Fillmore East – June 1971). Flo & Eddie 1970 should be seen as a transition period, the missing link between the 60’s Mothers and Billy the Mountain, with echoes of the short lived Hot Rats Band (Feb-Apr 1970).\n\nUntil the release of Road Tapes, Venue #3, the only way to appreciate such 1970 live shows were the zappateers archive (sing praise to them) or the following titles from the Beat the Boots series (all of them with fair to good audio quality):\n\nFreaks & Motherfuckers (BTB I, Fillmore East, NYC, November 13, 1970)\n\nTengo na Minchia Tanta (BTB II, Fillmore East, NYC, November 13, 1970)\n\nDisconnected Synapses (BTB II, Palais Gaumont, Paris, France, December 15 1970, featuring Jean-Luc Ponty)\n\nAs for concert tapes, go for instance for 18-Jun 1970, Uddel, Netherlands (Live at the “Piknik” show, VPRO, Dutch Television, good audio quality).\n\nSo this Tyrone Guthrie Theater, 5 July 1970, set is highly welcome to fill such a gap.\n\n.\n\nRoad Tapes, Venue No. 3\n\nDisc One\n\nShow 1\n\n1 Tyrone Start The Tape… (1:59)\n\n2 King Kong (3:37)\n\n3 Wonderful Wino (Zappa/Simmons) (4:47)\n\n4 Concentration Moon (2:34)\n\n5 Mom & Dad (3:25)\n\n6 The Air (3:46)\n\n7 Dog Breath (2:01)\n\n8 Mother People (2:06)\n\n9 You Didn’t Try To Call Me (4:10)\n\n10 Agon – Interlude (Stravinsky) (0:36)\n\n11 Call Any Vegetable (7:59)\n\n12 King Kong / Igor’s Boogie (20:25)\n\n13 It Can’t Happen Here (3:05)\n\n14 Sharleena (4:59)\n\nShow 2\n\n15.

Thanks to zappateer Ed Organmax, here is the deconstruction (RT3 timings):\n\nKing Kong 8:12-9:51 (sax + drum solos)\n\nThe Clap (Chunga’s Revenge):\n\n7:20-8:21 (guitar solo)\n\nKing Kong:\n\n10:06 – 13:09 (more drums, slightly more sax, second guitar solo)\n\n15.19-19.04 (electric piano solo, vocal-drum and assorted screams)\n\nReasoning about King Kong, one more from Ed Organmax:\n\nThe two minutes in King Kong/Igor’s edited off “The N&M” between Guitar Solo 2 and the Electric Piano Solo (13:09-15.18 or so) are really driven by Aynsley who swings like a bad motherfucker! Stick in some horns and it would have sounded like The Grand Wazoo! So Dunbar had the chops from the outset!\n\nAynsley Dumbar drumming is in fact one the most remarkable elements of this recordings, also because drums are often clearer than other instruments and quite in front of the mix (especially in show 2). The overall audio quality is fair as the other Road Tapes releases. The Nancy and Mary Music is a good reference, even though show 1 (most of cd 1) audio quality is not as good as show 2, because of tape quality. Liner notes states that the first 35 minutes have been recorded over a previous used tape. During some songs (The Air and Call Any Vegetable) some other sounds can be heard far back in the mix.\n\nAs stated by zappateer pbuzby:\n\nI can only guess that FZ may have thought of the first half hour of the first show as time to check the mix and perform material from the albums, before using better tape for the rest.\n\nA huge thanks should be given to the persons at the control knobs, audio source often changes, there should had been a lot of mixing work behind this release.\n\nAudio quality apart, this double set has a lot of appeal of course for the Vaudeville era fans, but also for those who are not in the mood of groupies entertainment.\n\n(Almost) full instrumental numbers as King Kong (3:27+20:26), Pound for a Brown (4:57), Sleeping in a Jar (3:37), The Return of the Hunchback Duke (10:00), Oh No/Orange County Lumber Truck (11:01), Chunga’s Revenge (13:01) amount to about half the program (about 1h:12min of 2h:26min) and include fiery solos by Zappa, Underwood (especially on woodwinds), Duke and Dumbar.\n\nIn the rest of the program there still room for further Zappa solos (Wondeful Wino, Call any Vegetables (2 takes), Sharleena (a short solo in both takes)).\n\nAs for Sharleena, interesting to note that in his intro to the song Zappa explains (at about 1:05 into It Can’t Happen Here): “a song that we recorded in London a couple of weeks ago […] it will probably be released under the pseudo-name of Bognor Regis”. It should be a reference to the Chunga’s Revenge recording sessions. On the other hand Bognor Regis became the b-side of the unreleased Sharleena single.\n\nBognor Regis, from the Hot Rats sessions, August-September, 1969)\n\nBack to the instrumental side of Road Tapes, Venue #3, “A Piece Of Contemporary Music” is a conducted improvisation episode that sounds like the 60’s Mothers of Invention (with a funny quote of Duke Ellington’s Caravan).\n\nMoreover, Agon – interlude and Igor’s Boogie are brief nuggets also reminiscent of the MOI.\n\nAll the other Zappa songs feature great vocal performances of the Flo & Eddie duo, namely:\n\nConcentration Moon\n\nMom & Dad\n\nThe Air\n\nDog Breath\n\nMother People\n\nYou Didn’t Try To Call Me\n\nCruising For Burgers\n\nLet’s Make The Water Turn Black\n\nHarry, You’re A Beast\n\nThey all are from the 60’s catalog, no groupies on the scene!\n\nThe surf/rockabilly number Justine, and the Mondello routines are that bit of previously unreleased folklore that gives further interest to the set.\n\nAdrian Lloyd & the Sunsets, Justine (Harris/Terry)\n\nZappa told about the Mondello folklore in an “interview happened in Minneapolis on Sunday, July 5, 1970. The Mothers had gigs in Indianapolis in July 3 and 4, and then two shows in Minneapolis in July 5 at the Guthrie Theater”\n\nHF: Didn’t one of them used to be on “Leave it to Beaver?”\n\nZ: That’s the ‘Larry Mondello case.’ [2] They’ve been both mistaken for Larry Mondello for six years. It used to be Corky, the fat little kid that took care of Lassie between Jeff and Timmy. [3] At every concert for six years one of them has been mistaken for that kid on Beaver. Their real names are Mark Volman and Howie Kaylan.\n\n“Frank Zappa Speaks” by Hundred Flowers, Hundred Flowers, July 10, 1970\n\nFinally, tough posthumous, this album includes the first official release (not counting Beat the Boots) of Holiday in Berlin with lyrics, here as a section of The Return of the Hunchback Duke.\n\nLive long and prosper, Road Tapes!\n\n.\n\nWe’ve been recording our shows here, at Tyrone Power Theater, and put them in a time capsule.\n\nFrank Zappa, Tyrone Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis, MN, 5 July 1970 (The 23rd “Mondellos”)\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOn April 23, 2016 an orchestral/electric, Napoleon driven Zappa tribute took place at Teatro Studio Borgna, at the Rome Auditorium. A remarkable event if you consider the effort needed to blend an all flutes orchestra (50 elements) with and electric big band (11 elements), although with the great help of Napoleon Murphy Brock (on his real birthday! more about this later).\n\nHowever in this case it seems that size didn’t matter and such a large band performed in one of the rehearsal rooms of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, and very little promotion preceded the concert.\n\nNonetheless the performance was effective, some flutes arrangements were particularly colorful, the electric band was tight and Napoleon body and soul on stage were exactly what such a large ensemble needed to complete the picture, mainly focused on the Roxy era.\n\nHere are the main credits:\n\nTribute to Frank Zappa\n\nI Virtuosi dal Pianeta Talento\n\nUgo Maccari: keyboards, minimoog\n\nCarlo Amberti: guitar\n\nGianluca Marchetti: hammond organ, lead vocals\n\nFrancesco Pititto: bass\n\nPier Paolo Ferroni: drums\n\nMatteo Flori: vibraphone, marimba, glockenspiel, percussion\n\nMassimo Muratori: trumpet\n\nFrancesca Menchini: flauto\n\nMonika Wolf: alto sax\n\nDamiano Fabbrini: tenor sax\n\nGiorgio Parri: baritone sax\n\nAngelo Adamo: harmonica\n\nOrchestra di Flauti del Conservatorio di Musica Santa Cecilia\n\n(Flutes Orchestra of the Santa Cecilia Music Conservatory)\n\nwith\n\nDeborah Kruzansky, Francesco Baldi, Eugenio Colombo, Catia Longo, Francesco Leonardi, Monica Limongelli\n\n(for the full flute players list, see the concert program here)\n\nFranz Albanese: director\n\nspecial guest\n\nNapoleon Murphy Brock: vocals, tenor sax, flute\n\nProgram\n\nPenguin in Bondage\n\nPygmy Twylyte\n\nPeaches en Regalia\n\nSon of Orange County\n\nMore Trouble Every Day\n\nVillage of the Sun\n\nEchidna’s Arf (of You) (with drum solo)\n\nSofa\n\nStrictly Genteel\n\nUncle Meat Suite (Uncle Meat/Dog Breath/Pound for a Brown)\n\nFlorentine Pogen\n\nAndy\n\nInca Roads (includes Bolero)\n\nEncores\n\nMontana\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTwo videos are available via YouTube, outstandingly low-fi, flutes galore is too far into the wall of sound, but with good headphones and some imagination, you’ll be able to get the picture. Here they are, Echidna’s Arf (of You) and Inca Roads, featuring a nicely transplanted Bolero.\n\nFlutes Galore – Echidna’s Arf (of You) / drum solo\n\nFlutes Galore – Inca Roads / Bolero\n\n.\n\nIt would have been nice to hear their rendition of Strictly Genteel again, the flutes arrangement was rich, especially for “the majestic section towards the end”, as Steve Vai paraphrased the composer in the Frank Zappa: 200 Motels – The Suites booklet, referring about the answer of the composer to what was his favorite thing he ever wrote.\n\nThe right night to honour Napoleon Murphy Brock on his birthday!\n\nIn fact Napoleon wrote a moving facebook post for the occasion reported by Zappateer TPS (thank you!). Here is his zappateers post.\n\nTPS\n\nNapi wrote this last night and posted it on his facebook page. I thought i would share it here for those that wouldn’t see it. (The ‘real’ birthday reference I presume come from the wiki/google ‘fact’ that he was born June 7, 1945 (age 70). Actually it’s April 23, 1943.)\n\nNMB\n\nTO ALL OF YOU ANGELS OUT THERE, WHO HAVE WRITTEN ME TODAY, AND YESTERDAY, AND YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, PLEASE LET ME TRY, AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DONE FOR ME.\n\nThose of you who took the time out of your busy lives, to write and send me such heart felt greetings on this day, my real birthday, I want to say thank you, and to say that I love you more than what the words were meant to express.\n\nYour timing was such that I know you all had to be touched by the spiritual gods that surround us all. This last year for me has probably been the most difficult, and trying that I can ever remembering experiencing in all of my lives combined. And your reaching out to me, probably without even knowing that I was having such difficult times right now, causes me to view you all as angels that have come to my rescue.\n\nWithin the last year, I have lost seven close blood family members, Aunt Bertha Brock Nelson, Bernadine McCoy, Milton Brock, Aunt Ruth Murphy Harper, Uncle James Murphy, Gary Murphy Harper, and maybe one of my most beloved family member to whom I owe my present physical life, Richard Lewis. And two years ago three extended family members, George Duke, Corine Duke, and Ricky Lawson. Seven very close musician friends from when I was a teenager, Bobby Ingram, Billy Ingram, Douglas Ingram, Art Chavez, Ray Guzman, Vic Beam last week, and the beloved George Pezzolo. I don’t mean to make this seem too heavy, but it has been deeply disturbing to me, and I consider myself a very ultra positive, and happy human being. But this many, in this short span of time?\n\nSo for the Mariani’s Resturant Dancers who threw me two surprise birthday parties for the last two weeks that I performed there, because they knew that I would be performing in Europe on April 23rd, and I don’t know how they found out, because I didn’t tell them. Let me say Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, and I love you very much.\n\nAnd for the organizers of last nights performance, with the Orchestra di Flauti del Conservatorio “Santa Cecilia”, who created last nights performance a TRIBUTE TO FRANK ZAPPA, with also Ugo Maccari, and “I Virtuosi dal Pianeta Talento”, Deborah Kruzansky, Direttore Franz Albanese, and 70 of the finest musicians that I have ever had the pleasure to create love through music, with at least 50 of them all playing every type of flute that exist, with me as the featured artist. Your presence last night in my life, and those lives to follow, will never be forgotten. And to top it off, when they scheduled the concert for last night almost a year ago, Saturday April 23rd, 2016, had no idea the it was my birthday, until I had to submit my passport to them so that they cold pay me for the performance.\n\nAnd last by not least, to all my friends, that I have not kept in contact with over the past year, I ask you to please understand my situation, and forgive me for my not contacting you. But this has brought me back, and you will soon be hearing from me, I promise. Blessings to all of you. And may the love of God and life shine on you forever. And remember what Frank said, “MUSIC IS THE BEST”, AND SO ARE YOU!!!\n\n– ;- {= –\n\nAlso, at spaziofermo photo-blog: Napoleon.
