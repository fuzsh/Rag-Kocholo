        "text": "Well, I wanted to get this down on record… hey, any brewers, feel free to steal my ideas. I’m gonna try to make these eventually, but you’ll likely make the better beer than I would… :)\n\nI got an idea whilst listening to Frank Zappa‘s 1978 Hammersmith Odeon show, and post-watching the Brew Masters show on the Discovery Channel which covered Dogfish Head‘s creation of the Bitches Brew tribute beer (to Mile Davis).\n\nMy idea:\n\nWe need more Zappa beers!!\n\nLagunitas Brewing did an amazing job on their 40th Anniversary tributes to the first five FZ albums. Upright Brewing made “Billy the Mountain” (a traditional English-style Old Ale, having undergone over five months of oak barrel aging and another several months in the bottle). I hear Upright is about to go into Billy round 2. I have a bottle of the 2009, but I haven’t popped it yet. Rogue Ales has “Yellow Snow” – which may or may not be a FZ tribute. I mean, FZ didn’t invent the term.\n\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on potential Frank Zappa theme beers…\n\n‎’Amarillo Brillo IPA: 100% use of Amarillo hops. I envision this being a bold, citrus-y hop forward IPA. This is probably the one I could pull off easiest, even in an extract brew setting.\n\nSour Peaches En Regalia (sorry, Reg-ale-yuh was too corny): I’ve been really digging sour Belgian-style beers. I’m fully blaming my friend and fellow beer-making Zappa head Aaron for that. He turned me on to sours, and it’s mainly what I crave now. I envision this Peaches En Regalia sour to be similar to Cascade Brewing‘s Apricot… but with peaches (duh!). Cascade’s approach is “slow-ripened before being introduced to the beer. Based on a Belgian Tripel, this beer went through 16 months lactic fermentation and aging in French oak wine barrels, then rested on the fruit for four months before finishing.”\n\nWatermelon Ale in Easter Hay: Frank’s guitar solo for “Watermelon in Easter Hay” is one where I distinctly recall stopping what I was doing to skip back to the beginning of the track and re-listening immediately (from the Guitar record). I love it! For the beer… maybe a wheat beer with watermelon added in secondary (a la 21st Amendment‘s “Hell or High Watermelon” wheat). I’ll admit, I loved 21st’s watermelon the first time I had it (KLCC brewfest 2009). It has sunk on my priority list on 2nd and 3rd tastes (KLCC 2010, Sasquatch, etc)… so, some reworking of that for the FZ tribute.\n\nPound for a Brown Ale: This one would have to be a hoppy brown ale. To not ruin your pallet, I’d suggest fresh (wet) hops to come up with the required pound of hops. At a rough 5 to 1 ratio, that’s still a big hop build for a 5 gallon beer recipe (3.2 ounces dry hop equivalent).\n\nThe inspiration (first appeared on)…\n\nAny other homebrewers wanna tackle recipes? I’m still new to the craft. Let’s just put these on my long-term pipeline for now…\n\nYa Hozna!\n\n~Dan – np: Frank Zappa – Hammersmith Odeon\n\nDweezil Zappa is taking his Zappa Plays Zappa tour de Frank out again… this time, they’re going to tackle Apostrophe in its entirety. This one of my favorite records by Frank Zappa… featuring tale of Nanook wandering through the tundra, urged “Don’t Eat the Yellow Snow.” Other absolute faves are “St. Alfonzo’s Pancake Breakfast,” “Cozmic Debris,” and the groove-tastic instrumental title track jam.\n\nNo PacNW dates yet… I’m hoping a few are added as things get rolling along…\n\nNov 06, ’10 London, UK London Roundhouse\n\nNov 07, ’10 Belgium, BE Leuven Het Depot\n\nNov 08, ’10 Paris, FR Olympia\n\nNov 09, ’10 Hengelo, NL Hengelo Metropool\n\nNov 11, ’10 Oslo, NO Sentrum Scene\n\nNov 12, ’10 Stockholm,SE Filadelpia Church\n\nNov 13, ’10 Gothenburg,SE The Concert House\n\nNov 14, ’10 Malmo, SE The Concert House\n\nDec 1, ’10 San Francisco, CA Warfield\n\nDec 2, ’10 Reno, NV The Knitting Factory\n\nDec 3, ’10 Hollywood, CA The Music Box\n\nDec 4, ’10 Hollywood, CA The Music Box\n\nDec 5, ’10 San Diego, CA House of Blues\n\nDec 6, ’10 Phoenix, AZ Comercia Theatre\n\nDec 8, ’10 St. Louis, MO The Pageant\n\nDec 9, ’10 Indianapolis, IN The Vogue\n\nDec 10, ’10 Milwaukee, WI Turner Hall\n\nDec 11, ’10 Chicago, IL Congress Theater\n\nDec 13, ’10 Quebec City, QC Grand Theatre\n\nDec 14, ’10 Montreal, QC Metropolis\n\nDec 15, ’10 Toronto, ON Queen E Theatre\n\nDec 16, ’10 Albany, NY The Egg\n\nDec 17, ’10 New York, NY Beacon Theatre\n\nDec 18, ’10 Philadelphia, PA Keswick\n\nDec 19, ’10 Boston, MA House Of Blues\n\nFind out more info at:\n\nhttp://www.zappaplayszappa.com/tourdates.html\n\nIn related Frank Zappa news, the Zappa Family Trust is releasing another legendary Halloween show from the Vault in memory of FZ’s 70th birthday. It’s the 1978 Hammersmith Odeon show (3 CDs), and it features some pretty cute FZ cover art…\n\n~Dan – np: dredg – The Pariah, The Parrot, The Delusion\n\nFYI… PHOTOS of the SHOW at the BOTTOM\n\nFive years running, Dweezil Zappa and his precision-cut Zappa Plays Zappa band have toured the world bringing us a different slice of Frank’s music to our ears. Past tours have featured players from Frank’s own classic ’70s and ’80s band arsenals: Steve Vai, Terry Bozzio, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ray White and more. There are no “old guard” members present in the 2010 incarnation — but regardless of which musicians surround Dweezil’s guitar mastery, the fact remains that the genius, adventurous spirit birthed in Frank’s songs is still alive.\n\nThe ZPZ band this time around is Dweezil Zappa: Guitar; Scheila Gonzalez: Saxophone, Flute, Keyboards & Vocals; Pete Griffin: Bass; Billy Hulting: Marimba, Mallets & Percussion (and lead vocals for a bit); Jamie Kime: Guitar; Joe Travers: Drums & Vocals; Ben Thomas on lead vocals; and introducing Chris Norton on Keyboards & Vocals.\n\nWith no opener, the band kicked into their long set a little after 9pm… they played a super tight, super long set. Having seen the ZBZ band with Napoleon Murphy Brock and Ray White in the past, I was skeptical of this “new guy” Ben Thomas. He joined the ZPZ band after Ray White left the tour last year. After the first vocal belt, there was no more skepticism… Ben can sing (and plays a mean trumpet, harmonica and cow bell, too). He handled the lows and highs, and carried the tunes in a way that would have made Frank proud.\n\nThroughout the set, each band member got their time to shine… “Echidna’s Arf” was probably the tightest song the band played… lightning fast, and spot on. Dweezil had killer solos on “Florentine Pogen” and “Pick Me, I’m Clean.” “Big Swifty” & “Mystery Roach” showed off great solos from Billy on marimba, Scheila on sax, and Jaime on guitar. Joe’s drum solo at the end of “Latex Solar Beef” could have ended the show, but (lucky for us) they stayed out and finished the main set with “Apostrophe” that featured Pete’s fuzzy, dirty bass groove and solo.\n\nHere’s what they played:\n\nSetlist: about 2 & 1/2 hours\n\nPurple Lagoon\n\nStinkfoot\n\nDaddy Daddy Daddy\n\nWhat Kind of Girl Do You Think We Are?\n\nFlorentine Pogen\n\nBig Swifty\n\nMystery Roach\n\nAdvance Romance\n\nThe Blue Light\n\nPick Me, I’m Clean\n\nBlessed Relief\n\nEchidna’s Arf\n\nKeep It Greasey\n\nEasy Meat\n\nThe Little House I Used To Live In\n\nLatex Solar Beef (with hints of Willie the Pimp)\n\nApostrophe\n\nEncore: Lonely Little Girl\n\nCity of Tiny Lites\n\nCosmik Debris\n\nI’m the Slime\n\nAs in the past, amazing musicians this time out. Some of the highlights were the aforementioned tight “Echidna’s Arf,” “Florentine Pogen,” and the more gentle “Blessed Relief.” The only song I was craving that wasn’t played was “Peaches En Regalia,” but it was nice to hear some older, rarer Frank songs being trotted out in lieu of the “fan fave” Peaches. As far as sound quality, near the front it was OK, but I heard from people in the middle and back that it was a bit muddy. Regardless of that downside, the evening showed off a super tight band who gave their all! ZPZ band, Eugene loves you!

This time was at Portland’s Hawthorne Theater as the “You Can’t Fit On Stage Anymore” variation of the tour. The venue had a small capacity (~300), you get a download code at the venue to get the entire recorded show after they mix it down (about a month?), you have a chance to win a free Hagstrom guitar (at each show), and you get to help choose the set list for the night. Of the 68 available tunes in the ZPZ band’s repertoire, here were my selections: Broken Hearts Are For Assholes, Inca Roads, Montana, Peaches En Regalia, and Sofa. They played two of my choices. I was really hoping for “Montana,” though. Eh, choosers shouldn’t be beggars.\n\nDweezil came out first and talked about the download code and how it wouldn’t quite be ready within 8 days, but that it’d be worth the wait. I’m sure it will, as it’s gonna be 3 CDs of professionally recorded audio for “free.” Free in that it’s part of the pricey ticket. But, it’s not like I have to pay for it again, eh? :)\n\nThe band was very similar (if not the same) as when I saw the 2007 tour at Moonlite Gardens in Cincinnati, OH. Different set list, of course. They had a few technical difficulties during the show, but veryveryvery minor, and they rolled with the punches very well. Outside of Ray White, they were all pretty much playing for the entire show, and even Ray only had a few breaks when he wasn’t needed to sing.\n\nThe ZPZ Band this time around is:\n\nDweezil Zappa: Guitar\n\nAaron Arntz: Keyboards\n\nScheila Gonzalez: Saxophone, Flute, Keyboards & Vocals\n\nPete Griffin: Bass\n\nBilly Hulting: Marimba, Mallets & Percussion\n\nJamie Kime: Guitar\n\nJoe Travers: Drums & Vocals\n\nSPECIAL GUEST… Ray White: Guitar & Vocals\n\n(Ray White is the pimp)\n\nSetlist: (any help in filling in the blanks is appreciated)\n\nPeaches En Regalia(a fave of the set)\n\nCity of Tiny Lights\n\nInca Roads(a fave of the set)\n\nI’m Not Satisfied\n\nPygmy Twylyte\n\nIdiot Bastard Son\n\nCheepnis (partial) then back to Inca Roads (??)\n\nHagstrom Guitar Giveaway Jam (I didn’t win… boo…)\n\nChunga’s Revenge with solos\n\nBilly the Mountain (28 minutes)(a fave of the set)\n\nAndy\n\nDirty Love(a fave of the set)\n\nUncle Remus\n\nWillie the Pimp(a fave of the set)\n\nWind Up Workin’ in a Gas Station\n\nSan Ber’dino\n\nYo Mama\n\nBlack Napkins\n\nEncore:____________ (missing name, more guitar solos)\n\nMuffin Man(a fave of the set)\n\nAll in all… fantastic show… 2 hours and 40+ minutes of amazing musicianship… the only things to make it better? My own pictures perhaps… oh, and winning the guitar would have been nice. :)\n\nI hope they come around again in the fall… I’ve seen all three of the ZPZ tours. And this was technically the “2008” tour, even though it was in 2009 (obviously). Seeing as I wasn’t into Frank’s music before he died, this is the next best damn thing. Thanks, Dweezil and Co.!\n\nThe Appropriate Linkage:\n\nhttp://www.zappa.com/zpz/index.html\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dweezilzappa\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/zappaplayszappa\n\nhttp://www.hawthornetheater.com/\n\n~Dan – np: Ryan Adcock – Finished -LP-\n\nWell, there are still some 2007 CDs that may or may not arrive in my hands before the year’s over (specifically Eyvind Kang, Dave Douglas, Greydon Square, Radiohead, Doug Pinnick & La Mar Enfortuna — all of which have Top 20 potential); so I’m not ready to post my “Best CDs of 2007” list, yet. Look for that one sometime in early 2008…\n\nThis blog is for my favorite concerts of 2007. I went to too many to recount in detail, but these are the tip-top ones…\n\nMusic Now Festival 2007 (Pedro Soler, Bryce Dessner, David Cossin, the Clogs, the Havels, Osso, Amiina, My Brightest Diamond, Sufjan Stevens) at the Memorial Hall, Cincinnati-OH (4/5/07 to 4/7/07) my review\n\nMasada (John Zorn, Dave Douglas, Greg Cohen, Joey Baron) at the Rose Theatre at the Lincoln Center, New York-NY (3/10/07) my review\n\nNellie McKay at the Shedd Institute, Eugene-OR (10/5/07) my review\n\nSilverchair at the Fillmore @ the TLA, Philadelphia-PA (7/28/07) review snippet\n\nSecret Chiefs 3 at the Bowery Ballroom, New York-NY (3/15/07) my review\n\nJohn Zorn’s Moonchild (Mike Patton, Trevor Dunn, Joey Baron) at the Moore Theatre, Seattle-WA (11/4/07) my review\n\nHoly Fuck at the Southgate House, Newport-KY (4/1/07) my review\n\nAntibalas at the Southgate House, Newport-KY (4/29/07) review snippet\n\nNoctaluca at the Taste of Cincinnati, Cincinnati-OH (5/28/07)\n\nBlackfield (Steven Wilson & Aviv Geffen) at the Bowery Ballroom, New York-NY (3/16/07) my review\n\nOK, I guess I’ve still got coming up in 2007 Iron & Wine in Portland (12/2) and maybe David Bazan (Pedro the Lion) in Eugene (12/14); but the above concerts were my favorites of 2007…\n\nHappy thanksgiving, yo! One thing I’m thankful for is definitely music… :-)\n\n~Dan – np: npr jazz profiles (podcast) – duke ellington: the bandleader, pt. 1\n\n12/24 Update: wow… I totally forgot the kick ass Zappa Plays Zappa show at Moonlite Gardens in Cincinnati, OH on 7/24/07. I think I forgot because I didn’t blog about it when it happened (gettin’ ready to quit my job and pack up and head west at the time)… but now reading this week’s CityBeat, tons of people listed it as a favorite, and man, I was at that show, too… Dweezil = awesomes! Ray White = awesomes! Frank on a big screen behind the band, singing and soloing with the live band = awesomes! 2nd time seeing the ZPZ tour in 2 years (completely different setlist, too). I think it needs to be a once-a-year thing… in perpetuity."
