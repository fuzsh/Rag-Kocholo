It also included a lesson (also on the DVD) by Mike Keneally.\n\nBelow is a picture of how the MK lesson looks like on the computer screen.\n\nrandom notes\n\n\"mike is a multifaceted musical giant. he allows us to audibly witness him bathing naked in the oceans of his inspired, harmonious intellect. you don't usually get this kind of honesty in the realm of contemporary music\"\n\n steve vai\n\nfrom: kristian kier (krkier@rocco.wupper.de)\n\nat the time zappa planned his ´88 tour and started the auditions for new musicians mike phoned zappa´s hotline for an appointment for audition. two days later frank´s secretary called back that he has to come to audition the same night. unfortunately he had a gig at that night with his then band \"drop control\", so he had to cancel this appointment, and this went really hard with him. then he found out that the club hired another band for this night, so no gig for him either. that´s from an interview in a german musician magazine (fachblatt)\n\nabout the 1988 zappa tour.\n\nsolo stuff, released hat. helped organize zappa's universe back in 91 and probably was involved in the post production of the cd/video. currently working on a second solo album, when not on tour with 'z'. unfortunately it won't be finished until august 94. if it's as good as 'hat.', it'll be fab and worth all your pennies.\n\nmike keneally is currently touring with z & is a columnist for \"guitar player\". (source: late show last monday/ guitar player mag.)\n\nsubject: mike keneally in japan it was a small studio. 8th floor of the shinjuku disc union building. there's only 30+ people there but the space was almost packed. both the store and the record company virtually no advertising about this event. i think there is dead-line problem, probably. maybe his schedule is very tight. and this trip is mainly for promotion, doing interviews for press. so i have to thank them just giving us a chance to see him perform. mr. keneally appeared at 5:00 pm. everyone welcomed him with huge applause. after brief introduction by the staff, mike took (his?) guitar. it was an ovation acoustic. he performed in completely 'unplugged' mode. \"open up\", \"idiot bastard son\" and a few songs from boils that dust speck. the performance was short but strong. sometimes he play very fluid like ones on zappa's universe. and there's the moment he went rough, hard-strumming style. and his singing was very emotional.\n\nsometimes he suddenly burst into screaming! i was surprised. because being an acoustic set, i expected kind of sweet songs, played tenderly. but anyway, i was massively impressed. that's for sure. then next, audience participation time (not really). nobody even try to ask him a question so i was only questioner. here's mike said to me:\n\nz's second album, music for pets, will be out this year.\n\nscott thunes is no longer with z.\n\nmike apparently not happy with zappa's universe cd. when i asked about touring of zu, mike said that joel thome might be thinking of it but he do not want to take part in it. no zu anymore.\n\nabout a rumor that mike is new 'vaultmaster' for the frank zappa archive. this is not true. mike is helping gail for some projects but never been in such a role. he already knows such a rumor has been around in internet. after two concerts with shankar, mike took participated in his album recording. it was completed but unreleased. anyway 'that's not good, so you can forget about it,' mike says.\n\nparis tribute show is just postponed. it seemed not being completely canceled. in conversation about his current activities, mike revealed that he has recorded with henry kaiser. i couldn't believe it so i had to repeat asking. yes, henry kaiser! i have confirmed it. it was quartet; mike, kaiser with a bass and a drum. it was not very improvisational nor noise-oriented. '(the recording is) very interesting and henry is a very good guy', mike says. this is also 'out this year.' mike is very generous, kindly answered my questions.\n\nand then, people got signed, took photograph with him. some people got signed on their 'hat.' i, personally, said to him that you should refrain from zappa-cover doing things and concentrate on your own music.\n\ni just want to listen more your stuff. --- that's what i really like to say to him and i made it. who knows what he think about my comment...\n\nanyway, it was memorable experience, indeed. thanks, mr. keneally.\n\nkeneally here. i finally managed to sneak enough time away from my day job at the multi-colored aquarium-pebble factory to cobble together another solo opus... boil that dust speck - a cornucopia of moods, rhythms & snide comments.you'll smile & hop, your brow will furrow, your cranium walls will be a vivid emerald green.\n\nmike keneally's second solo album cam out late '94, it's called 'boil that dust speck'. it is phenomenal. he has a solo band that he will be touring with sometime after the next 'z' tour is over with. his band is called \"mike keneally and beer for dolphins\", if my memory serves me correctly, tass panos plays drums and 'z''s current bassist also is in beer for dolphins.\n\nmike's newest album, \"boil that dust speck\" is out on immune records - it is a total heavy rocking guitar fest - 30 tracks of great stuff. not as kooky as _hat_, but still an excellent album.\n\nboth mike and bryan are no longer members of z. they left and are concentrating their creative energies on beer for dolphins. they recently completed a two month tour with frank briggs(teacher and master clinician) on drums in place of toss panos(who lured away to do a corporate rock project).\n\na live cd is be released in the near future and mike and co. will possibly start work on a follow up to \"boil that dust speck\" this summer.\n\ndid you know mike keneally and beer for dolphins are currently touring? see if they're headed for your town:\n\nhttp://www.keneally.com/\n\njeremy sarna sez:\n\nmike recently finished recording a zappa tribute album with the ed palermo big band. the release date is not yet known. mike will also be touring with steve vai's band this fall.\n\nfrom: patrick neve\n\nmike has released \"sluggo!\", arguably his strongest album yet. also \"the tar tapes is/was available in a very limited autographed run of 500, with one lucky customer winning the privelage (or curse) of having mike write a song especially about them. while mike has announced that the ticket holder has come forward, their identity remains secret thus far.\n\nfrom: mikew2112@aol.com (mikew2112)\n\ncleveland g3 tour stop 6/24/97: satriani, vai and kws jammed \"my guitar wants to kill yo mamma\". keneallly sang, it was fabulous. the jam was incredible, even fripp gave a lengthy solo.\n\nfrom: \"ken meyerkorth\" (kenm@rwlynch.com) - date: wed, 8 oct 1997\n\ni don't know how many have seen theg3 concert, but if you haven't, better try to!\n\nhere at the concord pavilion, in california, mike keneally was there and totally jammed with vai a la zappa. mike was basically the funny man in the band while steve mastered his axe with rifts and methodology that just reeked zappa teachings. and then, mike did his own little guitar stunt work at the end when joe satriani, steve vai, kenny wayne sheppard, and robert fripp all jammed to my guitar wants to kill your mama. mike k. was the singer for that jam. he walked up behind joe satriani and took over his fret work while joe mastered the pick. not a single missed note or error.\n\ntremendously impressive!\n\noh yeah, almost forgot. mike k. did do one thing spectacular. during robert fripp's masterful midi work at the beginning of the show, he walked on-stage, picked up his guitar and proceeded to jam amidst the beautiful background stuff robert was playing. the jam was about 10 minutes long and if you closed your eyes, for just a bit, you could hear frank playing. it was scary!\n\nfrom: \".\" (plainsongs@aol.com)\n\nregarding mike keneally, he has just finished recording his new solo record, \"nonkertompf\", which is to be released on his own new label, exowax records, in august 1999. it's an all-instrumental feast with every sound emitted by mike himself. he continues to play and record with his band mike keneally & beer for dolphins.\n\n2004/01\n\nMike Keneally's next album will be called \"Dog\". As you might know, the latest Mike Keneally albums have been presented in two different editions: limited, special ones, including extra material on an extra disc, or regular ones.\n\nThis will also be true for 'Dog'. The special edition will included a DVD with a lot of extra footage.\n\nThose who signed in for the extra edition before 2003/12/31, will receive another bonus as well: a 35-minute cdr preview of Mike Keneally's upcoming Internet Radio Broadcast Service.\n\nMore on this (and on the new Mike Keneally Band) on: www.keneally.com\n\n2004/02\n\nJust wanted to let you know, the new season of NoneRadio starts Feb 9, at http://www.noneradio.com\n\n-- NoneRadio is hosted by Rich Pike & Mike Keneally, with special guest co-hosts Joe Travers & Kent Huffnagle. (Keneally played guitar w/FZ, Joe is the FZ Vaultmeister AND drummer for Z, Dweezil etc, and Kent worked with him on the 'Baby Snakes' DVD. Rich is just Canadian.)\n\nAs one might suppose, there will be much talking about the 'Baby Snakes' DVD, plus some fun rare FZ, and a lot of other music as well. Shows are 3 to 4 hours in length, often start late, and repeat 24/7 throughout the week. Thanks! Check it out if you can and bookmark it while you're there.\n\nhttp://www.noneradio.com\n\n-- rp\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Exowax Recordings\"\n\nTo: \"List Member\"\n\nSent: Friday, February 27, 2004\n\nTHE KENEALLIST: BAKED POTATO\n\nHi all!\n\nSorry for not writing more frequently lately - we're diligently preparing for the releases of Dog, the Dog Special Edition and The Universe Will Provide and it's kept us real busy.\n\nBig news for this weekend, though, is this:\n\nMike Keneally Band\n\nSaturday, February 28, 2004\n\nThe Baked Potato\n\n3787 Cahuenga Blvd.\n\nNorth Hollywood, CA 91604\n\n(818) 980-1615\n\nOpen at 7:00 PM\n\nShows: 9:30 and 11:30\n\nWe haven't gigged in quite some time, and we won't be able to gig for a little while after this (our ever-busy drummer Nick D'Virgilio is going to be playing with the reformed Tears For Fears on the road this year (more delightful scheduling problems for us, but many congrats to Nick). So if you can possibly make it to this show please do. We'll be premiering a number of new songs from Dog at this gig.\n\nMore soon! Thanks!\n\n-- Mike\n\nTHE KENEALLIST\n\nMarch 28 2004\n\nHello everyone\n\nWe must thank everyone who is patiently waiting for the release of Dog, the new Mike Keneally Band album. We're deep into the production of the DVD for the special edition and when that's completed, we're ready to manufacture and ship to those of you who pre-ordered. (And those who pre-ordered before January 1 will be getting their copy of the limited edition CD Pup along with their order.) The album itself, and the artwork for the CD package is complete and I've never been happier with one of my albums. Of the whole bunch of them this comes the closest to my long-time fantasy of what a basically insane rock album should sound like. If it recalls any of the past albums it's mostly Dust Speck with a bit of Sluggo! in there too, but in reality it's a whole other thing, mainly thanks to amazing sounds made by my ridiculous band, Bryan Beller, Rick Musallam and Nick D'Virgilio. Thanks you freaks. You outdid yourselves.\n\nAnyhoo if we don't get battered by fate we're still on target for a late Spring release, but forgive us if we're not foolish enough to specify a definitive release date at this point. We have a group of amazing people helping us to make the DVD a reality and it's going to be something special and worth your while. Soon after the limited editions begin shipping, the single-CD version will hopefully appear in stores and with online CD merchants. We have big plans but the pieces are still being put in place, as we've been necessarily preoccupied with the construction of the actual products\n\nMore details about all that soon. I think you'll dig Dog. Oh, that was too cute by at least 30%.\n\nMeanwhile, The Universe Will Provide is scheduled for an upcoming release on NPS Output, distributed worldwide by Favored Nations. This is the studio recording of my composition for guitar and orchestra featuring myself and the Metropole Orkest. Plans call for me to do some promotional appearances and hopefully some gigs in Holland around the time of the release. Bryan Beller will also be in Holland (he'll be performing with Steve Vai and the Metropole Orkest at the live debut of Steve's own night of music with the Metropole) and there are hopes that BB and I can do some playing when he's not furiously rehearsing Steve's thing. We shall see how it all pans out.\n\nIn other album news, the album of piano arrangements of Vai music I did a few years ago will hopefully see release before too much longer, and the Yo Miles! Sessions I did with Henry Kaiser, Wadada Leo Smith, Michael Manring, Steve Smith, Greg Osby, Zakir Hussain and many others will see release on a 2-CD set from Cuneiform, supposedly in May.\n\nAnd there's a gig in London next week\n\nMike Keneally\n\nwith Kristjan Järvis Absolute Ensemble,\n\nNapoleon Murphy Brock,\n\nthe X-ecutioners and Django Bates\n\nAbsolute Zappa\n\nLive Remixes of Frank Zappa Originals\n\nThursday, April 1, 2004\n\nBarbican Centre\n\nSilk Street\n\nLondon EC2Y 8DS\n\n(Barbican tube station)\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nTickets £12.50, £15, £20, £25\n\nInfo: 44 (0)20 7638 8891\n\nShould be fun! Come on over if you can.\n\nWe'll also be playing at NEARfest in Bethlehem, PA on July 10, but the tickets have sold out. However we are currently attempting to book a short East Coast tour right next to that date, stay tuned for details.\n\nPlease listen to www.NoneRadio.com whenever you can. It's playing now! I co-host it with Richard Pike whenever I've got a Monday free to drive to LA. and it's always fun. 3 to 4 hours of music and frequently absurd conversation, aired live on Monday night and subsequently replayed throughout the week until the next new show. I won't be on the next episode 'cause I'll be on a plane to London, but listen anyway, I say.\n\nWhat else. Here's the song listing for Dog if you haven't seen it at keneally.com:\n\nLouie\n\nBober\n\nSplane\n\nPride Is A Sin\n\nSimple Pleasure\n\nPhysics\n\nRaining Sound\n\nChoosing To Drown\n\nGravity Grab\n\nThis Tastes Like A Hotel\n\nPanda\n\nGo to www.keneally.com right now actually, if you haven't lately, and download Dog Bites, a montage of sound clips from Dog.\n\nThose of you who have a copy of Pup already will know that at one time the song Li'l was scheduled for Dog, but ultimately we decided that it wasn't the right song for this album. We recorded a number of additional tracks during the sessions which may see the light of day on yet another new CD before the end of the year, but that's only if all of you folks manage to cajole at least 100 of your friends into buying a copy of Dog when it comes out. Thanks in advance.\n\nOkay, be good, downsize unnecessary executives when the time comes, treat yourself and a loved one to a showing of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" and listen to Neil Young as much as possible. His tour bus runs on vegetable oil you know.\n\nSeacrest out!\n\nMK\n\nTHE KENEALLIST\n\nMay 2 28 2004\n\nToday is Jesse's tenth birthday!\n\nContents\n\n1. Baked Potato Gig May 8\n\n2.

BAKED POTATO GIG MAY 8\n\nA gig in LA this Saturday:\n\nMike Keneally, Doug Lunn, Rick Musallam & Nick D'Virgilio\n\n(Set One: Acoustic Keneally * Set Two: Electric Covers)\n\nSaturday, May 8, 2004 - The Baked Potato - 3787 Cahuenga Blvd. - North Hollywood, CA 91604 - (818) 980-1615\n\nOpen at 7:00 p.m. - Shows: 9:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\n\nBryan Beller is unable to do this gig, because he's on his way to Holland to rehearse and perform with Steve Vai and the Metropole Orkest, so Doug Lunn kindly answered my call. Reeves Gabrels will hopefully sit in as well, although he hasn't returned my calls since we were on NoneRadio together last week. If you're reading, Reeves, call me back for freak's sake.\n\nAnyway, the first set this Saturday is acoustic songs written by me, and the second set is going to be all covers. Do you want to know what the covers are going to be? You do? The titles will be listed at the bottom of this missive.\n\n2. NONERADIO\n\nThis week's NoneRadio show (premiering Monday May 3) features Shankar and Gingger along with Rich Pike and myself. I'm going to make Rich play \"That's All You Need\" by The Faces. Go to http://www.noneradio.com. Last week's show with Reeves Gabrels and Doug Lunn featured probably the best in-studio improvs we've done on the show yet, almost an hour's worth.\n\n3. REGARDING ENGLAND\n\nI really enjoyed the gig with the Absolute Ensemble at the Barbican on April 1. More gigs with the ensemble are planned later in the year. Also, after the Absolute gig, I went to Swindon for a few days and wrote six songs or partial songs with Andy Partridge, and started working up yet another song at Dave Gregory's place. These are baby songs in the early days of their babyhood but they do exist. What will happen to them? I don't know. Stay tuned.\n\n4. A TRIP TO HOLLAND\n\nOn May 15 I'm going to Holland to do some promotional appearances for the launch of new record label NPS Output (distributed worldwide by Favored Nations) and the coming release of the Mike Keneally/Metropole Orkest release \"The Universe Will Provide.\" We don't yet have a specific release date to report for the album, but we'll have that info for you soon. At some point, when Beller isn't buried in sheet music for Vai's piece, he and I will sneak away and record some music for the radio. More details coming on that too.\n\n5.

WHAT'S UP WITH \"DOG\"?\n\nThe album itself is finished, the material for the special edition DVD is completed and is now being made into a DVD in NYC by New York DVD. Those of you who pre-ordered, we're on target to begin shipping to you starting late May/early June. Barring any currently unforeseen technical issues, all the current pre-orders should be fulfilled by mid-June. Both the single-CD version, and the CD/DVD limited edition set, will be available for sale at www.moosenet.com and other online merchants as soon as the products are in hand. Street date at retail? Still being worked out, but probably not until August.\n\n7.

I'll be playing with Jaan Wessman and Schroeder again, and writing a couple of new pieces for an ensemble of about 17 or so brilliant performers. Napoleon Murphy Brock is supposed to be involved as well. Like I say, more specifics very darn soon.\n\n9. MIKE KENEALLY BAND GIGS!\n\nWell, my hope was to book some other East Coast gigs around the sold-out NEARfest, but scheduling issues, not to mention the impracticality of us trying to book a tour on our own when we've got sixteen zillion other things going on, plus the fact that \"Dog\" won't be on record store shelves until August (assuming there are still record stores by then), means that we're taking a deep breath, working the phones to find a booking agent who understands us, and doing the real touring a little later in the year.\n\nBleeve me, I will promote the heck out of \"Dog\" (not to mention \"The Universe Will Provide\") by any and all means possible. So we're going to gig, and gig some more.\n\nAnd here's the first two:\n\nMike Keneally Band\n\nSaturday, July 3, 2004 - CalProg 2004 - The Center Theater Stage - Whittier Community Center - 7630 S.

We'll be playing all of \"Dog\" and a very spicy selection of past occurrences. Sorry the NEARfest is sold out, but if you're on the left coast please make it to CalProg 2004.\n\nHere's the full lineup for CalProg:\n\nMIKE KENEALLY BAND\n\nENCHANT\n\nIZZ\n\nERIK NORLANDER\n\nNEAL MORSE\n\nand for more info, please visit http://www.calprogday.com.\n\nKnow any booking agents whose life won't be complete 'til they're getting us gigs?

Thanks Doug and Neil.\n\nDOG UPDATE\n\nBoy, have we learned a lot about making DVDs these past few months the good news is work is officially truly so outrageously close to done on the Dog DVD and we will really truly be shipping the special edition very very freakin' soon. I know a lot of you have been waiting to hear the music and check out the DVD, and your wait is so nearly over you can taste it.\n\n\"Dog\", the special edition and the standard single-CD edition, begins shipping this month, and will be available for sale online. It will be available at retail outlets a bit later, though, probably October, to make way for the worldwide release of \"The Universe Will Provide\" on September 7 (\"TUWP\" will be available in the Benelux countries this month). Scott and I had a wonderful week in Holland last month  thanks to Co de Kloet, Steve Vai, Bryan Beller, J, Pieter van Hoogdalem and all our friends.\n\nThanks!\n\n-- Mike Keneally\n\nTHE KENEALLIST June 30 04\n\nhttp://www.keneally.com - http://www.RadioKeneally.com - alt.music.mike-keneally\n\nWe finally managed to get \"Dog\" out the door, and the response has been truly outrageous. I'm humbled and grateful for the kind words I've been reading so far --- thank you everybody.\n\nYou can see what people are saying about the album in the new \"Doggerel\" section at http://www.keneally.com/doggerel01.html, and of course if you haven't yet ordered \"Dog\" or the \"Dog\" CD+DVD Special Edition, get on over to http://www.moosemart.com and see what the hubbub's about. Bub. (I had to say it.)\n\nSincere thanks to everyone who pre-ordered --- your support allowed this album to exist in a very real way and our appreciation for you is immense. By the way, about half of the 2500 Special Editions are gone already (in addition to the pre-order, this is by far our fastest selling disc yet), so if you've been waiting, I wouldn't wait too much longer.\n\nHowdy all! For the moment, Dog is exclusively available at live gigs, at http://www.moosemart.com and at other selected sites (including Lou's Records in Encinitas, CA, which in addition to being Exowax's mail-order fulfillment angel is also a full-time and fully rocking record shop - everyone at Lou's is doing a great job getting Dogs into your hands - thanks Lou's!).\n\nDog will officially hit the streets at retail outlets around late October, after the September 7 release of The Universe Will Provide, my album with the Metropole Orkest. This will be released on the new NPS Output label in association with Steve Vai's Favored Nations records. We're currently arranging with Favored Nations to get advance copies of TUWP to sell at Moosemart several weeks prior to the retail release date.\n\nScott and I are highly energized by the response to \"Dog\" and you'll be seeing some more updates at http://www.keneally.com soon (I'm finally working on the discography again!, and we'll be posting the lyrics to \"Dog\" and \"Wooden Smoke\" soon), plus the launch of http://www.RadioKeneally.com in July. I spent a few hours today recording some bizarre voice IDs for the radio station, and I'm having a lot of fun choosing loads of unreleased material to play. 24 hours a day of streaming Keneally. It's the natural thing to do.\n\nAnd you know what else? Digital downloads of all Exowax Mike Keneally albums (including the currently-unavailable Pup and Dancing With Myself) will be available at iTunes, eMusic, Napster and other online music communities within a few weeks. We'll provide you with more details as they accure.\n\nBut I guess the main reason I wrote right now is to encourage anyone who can possibly make it to come to Whittier, California this weekend...to wit:\n\nFIRST POST-DOG-RELEASE CONCERT!\n\nTICKETS STILL AVAILABLE\n\nMike Keneally Band - Saturday, July 3, 2004 - CalProg 2004\n\n<http://www.calprogday.com>\n\nThe Center Theater Stage - Whittier Community Center - 7630 S. Washington Avenue - Whittier, California 90602\n\nTickets $55 & $65\n\nAlso on the bill are Neal Morse, Enchant, IZZ, and Erik Norlander. A great, full day of music and we'll play \"Dog\" in its entirety for the first time (will we devise a performable version of \"This Tastes Like A Hotel\"? I say yes! Come watch!), plus some of the more wicked Keneally oldies and one \"prog classic\" cover (I think it's classic, anyway). The band is champing at the bit, this should be a crazy show.\n\nNEARfest is sold out the following week. Here's the info for that show, just to annoy you.\n\nMike Keneally Band - Saturday, July 10, 2004 - NEARfest - Zoellner Arts Center - Lehigh University\n\n420 East Packer Avenue - Bethlehem, PA 18015-3006 - Phone: (610) 758-2787\n\nSorry.\n\nAnd! And! I'll be playing with Oppy at the release party for his new album Concepts of Non-Linear Time. As Oppy is likely to say at any moment, here's the dealio:\n\nMike Keneally guests with Special Opps\n\nChris Opperman CD Release Party\n\nFriday, July 16th - 11 pm - $7, $5 for Oppy and Keneally mailing list members - Room 5 Lounge\n\n143 N. La Brea, 2nd floor (Between Beverly & 1st) - Los Angeles, CA 90036\n\nJust want to mention briefly that the Bryan Beller debut gig last week was completely mindblowingly wonderful, and I sure hope we can do it again sometime - how's about a double bill tour? I'd show up for that. And the festival in Sweden a couple of weeks ago was intense and pleasurable as well -- thanks very much to the musicians who did such a spirited, superb job on the premieres of my chamber pieces \"Madge\" and \"Crumb\" (thanks again to Oppy for his mighty orchestrating as well), and feverish thanks forever to Schroeder, Jaan Wessman, the completely unreasonably amazing Napoleon Murphy Brock, Erik Palm, Andrew Jones and all my great new friends in Sweden.\n\nI'm out of superlatives, it's late, I'm a woozy grateful person and I'm going to bed. See y'all soon. Thanks again -\n\nMK\n\nTHE KENEALLIST\n\nJULY 26 2004 12:41 Pm\n\nby Mike Keneally\n\nI wanted to say hi to every one of you who've been hanging in with us for the past few years of music and things. Y'know (he said, loosening his tie Paul Anka-style), time can take its toll and hardly anyone has the time anymore to listen to and think about music the way they did when they were younger. <Paul Anka mode off> The fact that you've been enjoying the work we're doing and spreading the word about it is really significant to us. It's fantastic. Thanks for the time and energy and good feelings, everybody.\n\nIn our lurching way Exowax is gearing up for our concentrated promotional efforts on behalf of \"Dog\" and \"The Universe Will Provide.\" We've had a lot of consecutive uninterrupted creative projects (\"Parallel Universe,\" which is the companion album to \"The Universe Will Provide,\" has just been completed and it's, to use a Fripp expression, a hummer) and we are now fully realigning our aim in preparation for the promotion of said efforts. God help us all.\n\nRadioKeneally.com will launch soon. We have a lot of new friends helping us to catalyze our efforts, so we're feeling good. The air is buzzing in general these days so it's a good time to get some new things done.\n\nMaybe we'll be organizing some kind of street team again? We'll talk about that.\n\nThanks everyone, seriously --- we love you......and now, a series of promotional messages from Exowax, to you ~~~~~ Mike Keneally\n\n*********************************\n\nOh, another SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MIKE KENEALLY BAND gig - this SATURDAY July 31 at the BAKED POTATO\n\nThis is going to be a good show - the first Potato gig since our recent festival gigs so we're really in a playing mood. I just got a new Rivera amplifier which sounds fantastic. Long solos, ho. (I use 'ho' in the 'land, ho' sense, of course; I didn't just call you a ho.) For anyone frustrated that we keep playing in California and not in your town, we feel the pain brother and/or sister, and we're going to be touring again in a few months from now, and there'll some other special shows before then (many of which will involve Europe and the east coast of the US). But for now, we're here, so:\n\nMike Keneally Band - Saturday, July 31, 2004 - The Baked Potato - 3787 Cahuenga Blvd. - North Hollywood, CA\n\n91604 - (818) 980-1615 - Open at 7:00 p.m. - Shows: 9:30 p.m. and 11:30 p.m.\n\nWe surely hope that you can make it. Signed, Uncle Pa.\n\n***************************************\n\nA blast of new merchandise will claw its way towards you in a little while from now:\n\nKeneally + Metropole Orkest\n\n'THE UNIVERSE WILL PROVIDE'\n\nMike Keneally's 52-minute composition for guitar and orchestra\n\nPlus limited edition companion CD\n\n'PARALLEL UNIVERSE'\n\nOnly 20 Dollars for both CDs.\n\nLimited quantity, only from www.Moosemart.com\n\nComing very soon!\n\nWe'll be making this two-CD deal available online a few weeks BEFORE the worldwide retail release of \"The Universe Will Provide\" on September 7. And \"Parallel Universe\" won't be available in stores.\n\nYou know how happy we are with \"The Universe Will Provide,\" and we're just as pleased with the new album \"Parallel Universe.\" I edited this together from studio outtakes from the \"Provide\" sessions, excerpts from the Holland Festival show at the Paradiso, and Finale/synthesizer demos of the compositions in early stages, with a lot of additional music not on the other album. Plus a few moments from peoples' houses, studio hallways, hotel rooms, parking lots etc. This is a solid presentation of studio and live sounds, a streaming vessel of otherwise unavailable music served in a tart forty-minute cup. I'm having trouble believing I just wrote that. You can see more information about this album at www.keneally.com.\n\nAnd!\n\nAND!\n\nSHIRTS FOR 'DOG' and 'THE UNIVERSE WILL PROVIDE.'\n\nComing really soon.\n\nFor you see - there is haunting new clothing on the horizon including the assertive new \"Dog/PLAY LOUD\" T-shirt, and the beautiful new \"Universe Will Provide\" shirts for both ladies and men. Declare your dogged faith in the universe in spite of troubling odds with these luxurious garments, or things.\n\nStill only 20 dollars a shirt (23 for XXL) and they're really nice. Have you seen how much T-shirts cost as most bands' gigs these days? Insanity. I'd buy two of these instead if I were you.\n\nIN THE NEXT KENEALLIST - we'll tell you exactly when this material will go on sale at www.moosemart.com. Thanks for your kind attention, signed David Cross*\n\n*****************************************\n\n*not really\n\n*****************************************\n\nI just realized that we're getting The Movie Channel. \"Lord, Love A Duck\"! Sweet!! Now if they show \"The Impossible Years\" too I'll be in heaven.\n\n(not a promotional message)\n\n*****************************************\n\nThe Fripp reference above wasn't an accident - I've been steeping myself in all eras of King Crimson lately. Funny how one band or artist will take over all your listening time every once in a while. I think I'm heading on a Miles Davis binge next. Place your order for the next binge I should go on after that at the Usenet newsgroup alt.music.mike-keneally. (Hi everyone at ammk - I haven't been posting lately because I changed my ISP and haven't decided on the best way to access Usenet, but I'll figure that out soon. Hi!) There's a recording of the Larks' Tongue-era Crimson with Jamie Muir playing an improv called \"The Rich Tapestry Of Life\" on one of the Collectors' Club releases. Boy it's good.\n\n(not a promotional message)\n\n******************************************\n\nI'll be doing a solo gig in LA in August:\n\nMike Keneally SOLO - Tuesday, August 17th, 2004 - Level One - 6311 Wilshire (near Crescent Heights) - Los Angeles, CA 90048\n\nI'm getting some ideas about putting together some strange backing tracks to play along with at this show. There may be props. This could be weird. I'll tell you some more about it in the next Keneallist.\n\nThis has been a proper promotional message from Exowax Recordings. Exowax.

We sincerely hope you are, too.\n\nRADIO KENEALLY GOES LOW-FI!\n\nIf you surf to http://www.radiokeneally.com, you'll notice a new page when you hit the \"Listen Now!\" button-it gives you a choice of applications to listen with and now you can listen to RK with your dialup internet connection at 24k in addition to our semi-hi-fi 56k stream. Hopefully, this improvement will solve most of the connection difficulties some of you have been experiencing since we launched this puppy.\n\nA day or so after Mike and the band's September 5 concert at Lestat's in San Diego, Radio Keneally aired the show in its entirety. Songs from the show are still being featured, and we plan to do a lot more special stuff like that. As you may have noticed, we're also adding more cool songs, live versions, demos and nonsense all the time.

This is a quick hello,  just me checking in after a very busy September with a lot of touring activity. The Universe Will Provide has been in stores for a few weeks and is getting outrageous press response, and Dog will be in stores November 16. There'll be an article about me and the new albums in the January issue of Guitar Player - there was a fantastic review of TUWP in the last issue - and plenty of other upcoming press as well. Hooray!\n\nAnd, soon, yet another new album!: Vai - Piano Reductions Vol. 1 will finally see release in November. This is the solo piano album of Steve Vai compositions which I recorded in 1999. I'm pretty profoundly thrilled with the album. Copies will be available for sale from our merchandising site, http://www.moosemart.com, starting in November, and tracks from the album will be previewed at http://www.radiokeneally.com before the end of October.\n\nIn fact, now that I'm off the road for a little bit, I should be coming up with a lot more new RadioKeneally content, including more recent live tracks and another batch of insane promos, within the next few weeks. Thank you for the great response to the site. I'm also in hot-to-trot writing mode right now and will probably be writing a lot of the next MKB album over the next couple of months.\n\nI've written a very brief essay about politics and energy, an idea which I know is not thrilling to some of you, so I've opted not to force it upon you in this Keneallist missive, but rather to simply to inform you of its existence. If you are interested in my opinions about the current presidential campaign, no one can stop you from clicking this link: http://www.keneally.com/mkopinion01.html\n\nStill available! Dog signed, numbered special edition featuring DVD! And The Universe Will Provide with exclusive second album Parallel Universe! Only available at http://www.moosemart.com! And I hear it's the holiday season!\n\nIf you haven't been listening to a lot of Jeff Buckley lately, listen to more Jeff Buckley, and don't forget those frequent walks. And America - The Book from the Daily Show writers made me laugh hard at least 150 times. And, and, Mr. Show's fourth season on DVD! Yay!\n\nEnough rambling! Let's paint a house!\n\n-- MK\n\nTHE KENEALLIST: October 21, 2004\n\nnewsgroup: alt.music.mike-keneally\n\nA GIG THIS WEEKEND IN L.A.\n\nCrikey!

Let's ah, gee, my golf appointment is in twenty minutes! Sorry, folks! I leave the remainder of the announcements to Mike! Hi, Mike! Bye!\n\nYeah, thanks for basically nothing, rodent. Hey folks, Mike here. Hope you're all doing OK. Here's things ---\n\nCONTENTS\n\nVai Piano Reductions Vol. 1\n\nDOG in stores November 16\n\nTUWP/PU still available\n\nRadio Keneally\n\nDave, Shelly and Chainsaw Movie\n\nTaylor Tour\n\nCool new ads\n\nVAI PIANO REDUCTIONS VOL. 1\n\nThis is pretty exciting. I recorded those solo piano arrangements of Steve Vai material around five years ago and had forgotten how most of them sounded - Steve has done an incredible job with the mixing and sequencing. Bernie Grundman (who mastered hat. and Boil That Dust Speck) mastered the final version and it really does sound phenomenal. The whole package is very beautiful - you'll like it. Here's the song list:\n\nAll About Eve * Die To Live * Salamanders In The Sun * Bledsoe Bluvd * Ballerina 12/24 * Touching Tongues * Dyin' Day * Kill The Guy With The Ball/The God Eaters * Sisters * Pig * Junkie\n\nThe album is available only from http://www.moosemart.com and http://www.vai.com. Copies purchased from moosemart.com will be personally autographed by me.\n\nSteve, who I love a lot, wrote the following in the liner notes for this package, which modesty almost forbids me to - oh, what the heck:\n\n\"I believe that Mike Keneally is one of the most creative and gifted musicians God has graced us with. I have witnessed him do things on various instruments (at the same time occasionally) that defy reality, and though his technical command of his instruments is extraordinary, it's the profound voice of his inner ear that is truly the trump card of his brilliance. How could I have been so fortunate that he accepted to take on this project?\"\n\nUnbelievable. I feel very fortunate my own damn self. Thank you Steve.\n\nDOG IN STORES NOVEMBER 16\n\nFinally the album makes it to retail. Press coverage of the album, advertisements, features/interviews etc. will blossom like things in the dew (check January issue of Guitar Player for feature and full-page ad) [see below for a sneak preview]. Maybe even radio airplay, jeez, imagine that. We'll try anything. Look for me/us on the road a lot next year, for that is how I feel. I want to be out there banging on things and making a lot of noise. So we'll just see how much noise we can make. Yopp! (12-point reference)\n\nStill available from http://www.moosemart.com - the special edition of Dog with DVD, signed and numbered by me. A limited edition of 2500 and most of them have been sold, and I always get really sad emails from people angry at themselves for not buying limited editions while they're available and then they're suddenly unavailable and they write to me Oh Mike! I waited too long and now <fill in the blank highly desirable currently unavailable thingy> is no longer available, what should I do? Yeah! Cry me a river, grape nut! Anyway, please buy your very own Dog CD/DVD special edition while you still can, and next time I see you we'll nod at each other knowingly because you have got it going on. Dog shirts available at Moosemart too! We must be inSAAAAANE!\n\nTHE UNIVERSE WILL PROVIDE/PARALLEL UNIVERSE STILL AVAILABLE\n\nIt's true, you know. The Universe Will Provide (my instrumental composition for guitar and orchestra, recorded by the Metropole Orkest and myself) plus Parallel Universe (audio CD documentary of the making of TUWP featuring outtakes, live recordings, computer demos, and what have you) are still available as a 2-CD special edition for a mere twenty bucks at http://www.moosemart.com. I hasten to remind you, Skeezitz, that Moosemart is the ONLY place you can find Parallel Universe. And find it? You should. Also TUWP shirts still available, in regular design and ladies' design, which is proving to be very popular. Guys, you know the special woman in your life is seriously needing one of these shirts for the holidays. Women, you should obviously buy the regular TUWP shirt for your man. Walk around together, ostentatiously clinging to the notion that no matter what anyone may think, the Universe does continue to provide! Hoo boy!\n\nRADIO KENEALLY\n\nAn internet radio station playing nothing but Mike Keneally music? Can this be allowed?\n\nYeah, it's allowed if WE SAY IT IS! THIS IS IT!! The music THEY don't want you to hear! Voted most controversial website which plays nothing but Mike Keneally music by Zimbawee.com! Don't let your guard down people! Listen to nothing but RADIO KENEALLY! http://www.radiokeneally.com\n\nSeriously - soon we'll be adding lots of new songs and radio ID's. Next week I've got a few days to devote to programming Radio Keneally and I will, I will.\n\nSAN DIEGO RADIO LEGENDS DAVE, SHELLY AND CHAINSAW RELEASE NEW DVD WITH MUSIC FROM MIKE KENEALLY\n\nDave, Shelly and Chainsaw are the morning team on San Diego radio station KGB-FM. Each year they release a compilation CD of their best radio bits to raise funds for charities at Christmas. This year their CD is being bundled with a DVD, a comedy film called The JK Conspiracy written and directed by Cookie Chainsaw Randolph and featuring the music of me, Mike. It's songs from my last three albums, in some cases mixed differently (like there's a cool instrumental remix of I Was Not Ready For You, for instance). Guest stars in this production include Bob Costas and Don Rickles - it's a really ambitious production and pretty freakin' hilarious. It'll be available at local chain stores in San Diego (they're pressing 25,000 of them!), but for more information check out the KGB-FM website, http://101KGB.com/main.html.\n\nANOTHER TAYLOR TOUR!\n\nI will once again be on the road, playing and singing the praises of Taylor Guitars.

The snazzy covers have taken a bit longer to fabricate than originally thought, but worth it they will certainly be. Copies bought at www.keneally.com will be personally autographed by Mike, don't you know.\n\nDon't forget, \"Dog,\" \"The Universe Will Provide\" with \"Parallel Universe,\" and every other Exowax CD and T-shirt are awaiting new homes at http://www.keneally.com.\n\n\"DOG\" IN STORES TUESDAY!\n\nEven though it's been available online at www.keneally.com for a few months, Mike Keneally Band's acclaimed \"Dog\" officially has its day in the stores this Tuesday, November 16. If you're thinking of buying one for yourself or as a holiday gift, now it's as close as your quaint neighborhood record emporium.\n\nMIKE'S MUSIC IN SAN DIEGO COMEDY FILM\n\nMike provided the music for \"The J K Conspiracy,\" a film created by San Diego radio's top-rated Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw morning show at 101.5 KGB-FM. The theatre premiere is this Thursday, November 18 in San Diego-- tickets can be won by listening to DSC on KGB. The trailer for the comedy, starring Bob Costas, Don Rickles and many more (including a bit part by me, Scott) is viewable online now at http://www.101kgb.com/features53.html. A DVD will be available for purchase soon, with profits going to good causes.\n\nUK \"GUITARIST\" READERS LIKE MIKE\n\nThe readers of England's \"Guitarist\" magazine saw fit to include Mike in their list of \"101 Unsung Guitar Heroes.\" Mike's in good company among John Lennon, Neil Young, Andy Partridge, The Edge, Jan Akkerman, Tommy Bolin, Lowell George, Danny Gatton, Michael Hedges, Bill Frisell and dozens more.\n\nThe Mike Keneally entry reads:\n\n\"Think of the best player you're aware of. Now, look up a bit higher and the soles of the shoes you spy 50 feet above you are those of Keneally, the man who Frank Zappa called 'a genius'. And he was right.\n\nDid you know? Keneally prefers to describe himself as a keyboard player. D'oh!\n\nGuitarist pick: Nonkertompf (1999)\n\nYou say: 'The only guitarist to share a stage with Vai and blow him away!' - Don Seigler\"\n\nGeez! Mike's not sure Frank ever said he was a genius, and he doesn't actually prefer to be called a keyboardist, but the honor is richly appreciated by Mike. \"Guitarist\" is on newsstands now. Future issues will include a CD track from \"Dog\" and video from \"Dog DVD.\"\n\nAlso, Mike's feature article in \"Guitar Player\" (and full-page ad, see http://www.keneally.com/promo/mkb04promo.html) will be out next month.\n\nGUEST VERSE BY P.D EASTMAN\n\nDog.\n\nBig dog.\n\nLittle dog.\n\nBig dogs and little dogs.\n\nBlack and white dogs.\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Hello!\"\n\n\"Do you like my hat?\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"Good-by!\"\n\n\"Good-by!\"\n\nTHE KENEALLIST: December 2, 2004\n\nAnother San Diego show to announce --- please bring everyone you've ever met to this:\n\nAN EVENING WITH MIKE KENEALLY AND THE ELECTRIC NOTEBOOK\n\nMike Keneally: guitar, keyboards, vocals\n\nRick Musallam: guitar, vocals\n\nWes Wehmiller: bass\n\nJoe Travers: drums\n\n8:00 p.m. Wednesday, December 15, 2004\n\nBELLY UP TAVERN - 143 South Cedros Avenue - Solana Beach, CA 92075 (just north of San Diego) - 858-481-8140\n\n$15 at the door\n\nThis was going to be a Mike Keneally Band gig, but Beller and Nick were unavailable, so I got in touch with two of the most frightening musicians known to man, Joe Travers and Wes Wehmiller. Those of you who attended our Baked Potato show with Joe a few weeks ago can attest to his unbelievableness (tracks from the show can be requested at http://www.radiokeneally.com so you can hear the magic for yourself). Joe, of course, has been tremendously busy as the Zappas' Vaultmeister for the past several years, and has worked on all of the recent, wonderful Zappa archive audio and video releases (he is the \"Joe\" of \"Joe's Corsage\" and \"Joe's Domage\"). But never forget that this jewel of a man is first and foremost a beast of a drummer, who did a lot of superb damage on stage with Beer For Dolphins in the mid-nineties. Wes Wehmiller is a long time member of our musical family - he attended Berklee way back when with Travers and Beller, took part in Bryan Beller's \"View\" album and live performance, engineered my recording of \"No God's A Man\" for the Gentle Giant tribute CD, toured for years with Joe Travers in Duran Duran etc. etc. - he's been around for many a year, but this marks his first performance playing Keneally music, and all of us are seriously jazzed to hear this.\n\nWe want a lot of people at this show, please! We'd love to play bigger shows in my hometown more often, so drag whomsoever you can, by the scruff of the neck, over to the Belly-Up on Dec. 15. Remember, that's capital \"B,\" followed by \"elly Up.\"\n\nThank you to those among you who made it to last night's Lestat's acoustic gig - Rick Musallam and I had a good time very severely. The two-acoustic guitar format is rare for us and a lot of fun to do. The weirdest thing about Lestat's is that the stage lights are REALLY bright, so even though the audience is RIGHT THERE you still can't see anyone from the stage (I was only just about able to see Bob Tedde's face, and he was about a foot and a half away from me in the front row). And the audience was so attentive (thank you) that they hardly ever made a sound - so it kind of felt like Rick and I were just playing away in some remote ball of light. It actually worked real well, we had a nice show.\n\nUh-oh! Watch out for ----\n\nE X C I T I N G G I F T S F O R T H E H O L I D A Y S E A S O N F R O M M O O S E M A R T .

Delivery begins the moment smudge-free copies exist and are delivered to us (a printing error in the artwork doomed the first run of CDs, unfortunately). Only copies ordered from Moosemart will have a gen-yoo-wine Mark Keneally autograph (sorry, I mean Mike) rendered in lovely golden rendering.\n\nAvailable now for immediate purchase at Moosemart!\n\nDOG Special Edition - CD/DVD set, numbered and autographed by me!\n\nWooden Smoke Special Edition - not many left of these signed 2-CD sets, I say!\n\nThe Universe Will Provide/Parallel Universe double CD extravagazna - only $20 brings you orchestral fulfillment!\n\nPlus the marvelously black DOG/PLAY LOUD shirt, the beauteous UNIVERSE WILL PROVIDE shirt in both standard shirty-shirt and comely ladies' T, and many other items you can shake a stick at, if you choose!\n\nSo that's MOOSEMART......this HOLIDAY....for YOU!!!!\n\n(Stridently):\n\nFA LA LA LA LAAA, and HIIIIII DEEEEEEE HOOOOOOOOO.\n\nThanks everyone! Good night! Drive safely!\n\nMike\n\nHonk! Honk! Why, it's Wobbles, the goose!\n\n*\n\nTHE KENEALLIST: December 15, 2004: Mike Live at the Belly Up Tonight!\n\nJust a reminder about our show tonight--- please bring everyone you've ever met to this:\n\nTONIGHT!\n\nRARE HOMETOWN APPEARANCE!\n\nA Real Fun Evening With Mike Keneally and the Electric Notebook\n\nHosted by 101 KGB-FM's Cookie \"Chainsaw\" Randolph\n\nfeaturing\n\nMike Keneally: guitar, keyboards, vocals\n\nRick Musallam: guitar, vocals\n\nWes Wehmiller: bass\n\nJoe Travers: drums\n\n8:00 p.m. Wednesday, December 15, 2004\n\nBelly Up Tavern - 143 South Cedros Avenue - Solana Beach, CA 92075 (north of San Diego) - 858-481-8140 - $15 at the door\n\nThis was going to be a Mike Keneally Band gig, but Beller and Nick were unavailable, so I got in touch with two of the most frightening musicians known to man, Joe Travers and Wes Wehmiller.

Here's a special message for you music industry types --- and to those of you lucky enough NOT to be in the music industry, we will have other exciting news for you soon about touring and things like that.\n\nBut for now --\n\nHear ye, all you NAMM revelers --- if you're going to be attending this week's NAMM convention in Anaheim, CA, here's my performance schedule for Taylor Guitars:\n\nThursday January 20 - 1:20 PM - Mike Keneally & Rick Musallam - Taylor Guitars performance room\n\nFriday January 21 - 12:45 PM - Mike Keneally & Bryan Beller - Taylor Guitars performance room\n\nSunday January 23 - 1:20 PM - Mike Keneally & Bryan Beller - Taylor Guitars performance room\n\nAlso I'll be helping Taylor unveil a new instrument onstage, each morning of NAMM at 10:30. On Saturday night I'll be jamming at the Guitar Player Magazine party in one of the hotels, don't know which one (I'm guessing either the Marriot or the Hilton) but you can find out at their booth or via the white hot buzz of partymonger word of mouth.\n\nTo all of my friends reading this who will be at the convention, I hope we can find time to hang, in the midst of it all.\n\nMy current music fixations  Pavement and Glenn Gould. Never say I'm not a man of extremes.\n\nWebsite to check out  http://www.bradblog.com.\n\nQuick update: All last week I played on sessions for the debut album by a tremendous songwriter, Brian Judah. Also playing were Matt Chamberlain, Viktor Krauss, Tommy Simms and Dan Phelps  an assemblage built to glitter. The tracks are severely powerful and this will be an album to hear. The day I got home I went right into the studio with Jon Kanis, a San Diego songwriter whose album I've been producing and collaborating on for a good long time now. We had a very creative and satisfying day in the studio and Jon's album, Cult Of One,' will be something else you'll want to check out. Both these albums should be released this year. I'm also continuing work on the new sadhappy album featuring Evan Schiller and Michael Manring, and writing and demoing for the next solo releases.\n\nIt's taking, as usual, a while to firm up touring plans but when everything aligns it'll be a good thing, worth the wait.\n\nI was hanging laundry so I'd best get back to it. More power to you.\n\nSteathily,\n\nMike\n\nTHE KENEALLIST - March 1 2005\n\nHey! Hi! It's Mike.

It's all requestable, go there now!\n\nMany thanks to Which One's Pink's Dan Johnson for setting up a cozy spot for Keneally friends at MySpace.com [http://www.myspace.com/mikekeneally].\n\nMore news so soon you can taste it --- have a great week!\n\nYour love puppy,\n\nMike Keneally\n\nTHE KENEALLIST - april 22, 2005\n\nHey!
