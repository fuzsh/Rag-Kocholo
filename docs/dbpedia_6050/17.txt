This film is nothing really special, and it telegraphs what is going to happen from miles away. The story is about four teen girls in a Catholic high school who are outcasts for different reasons - one lives in poverty with a semi-abusive stepfather, another has a scarred arm and back, another is the victim of boiler plate racism, and the fourth - well, I could never really figure out her problem other than she was the new girl in school.

They are all beautiful, but all are bullied by girls and gals who - IMHO - weren't as good looking as they were. So they dabble in witchcraft to get out of their bad situations. Only two actually wish bad things to happen to their tormentors. The other two just want their bad circumstances to be gone, and in one situation that results in unexpected and unwished for death. But, absolute power corrupts absolutely, and soon the leader of our gang of four is drunk with power.

Am I a bad person because I liked seeing the cool guy make a fool of himself in front of his friends over the girl he trash talked? Well, so be it. The film is mainly good for its special effects and for a look back at the teen stars of the 90s. Fairuza Balk is very good at playing a very bad girl. She has the exotic yet scary facial features for the role, but she couldn't have done anything with it without talent.
