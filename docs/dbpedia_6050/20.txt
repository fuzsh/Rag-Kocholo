'Cause it's kinda hard to tell. Granted, I've only seen that one OLP video, the one where the girl climbs the stack of amps, but the song was unlistenable!!

Both bands have overwrought, self-absorbed, moderately talented singers, slow-ass melodies, and awfully Important lyrics.

Enlighten me. Tell me that's OLP's worst song.

creed are a bunch of no-talent ass clowns and should NEVER be compared to olp.

I agree with Screaming Flower, comparing both of these groups is like comparing butter and apples. They really arent very much alike at all. I also think Our Lady Peace is decent band, where I think Creed is Satan's gift to music. Check out OLP's song, Life. It's a fav. of mine.

not a huge fan of olp, but i certainly dont mind them. comparing them to creed is not fair at all.

the song you probably heard is somewhere out there. if anything that song resembles beautiful day too much, other than that its a beautiful song. the background guitar during the verses is primo stuff.

theyre not a bad band.

creed is the worst band in the world.

where did my thread go about timberlake being better than rock music?

I think this is the song. I tried to find some Real Audio of OLP, but all I could find was this song. I'm starting to think the Creed comparison was a little off, but I really don't hear what the big deal is about these guys. Somewhere Out There sounds very generic and common. They sound like others that are played on Adult Contemporary stations.

Martha, I agree with you on the fact that there really isnt that big of a deal about Our Lady Peace. They arent "the next big thing" or anything. They were just a decent alt. rock band, this new album is a little more mainstream I think. I prefer some of their older stuff. I'm sick of that "Somewhere Out There" song too, but comparing them to Creed? Ouch. hehe.

What is this?

Is it compared to rock? I don't understand this category of music.

Wasn't there a thread devoted to Our Lady Peace, and in that thread someone pointed out, more like exposed the fact that the song "Somewhere Out There" was pretty much ripped off from the animated movie "An American Tail?"

I've heard the Creed comparison before, actually. martha isn't the first and only person to make the comparison.

But I have no opinion on them.

OLP used to be good

Remember their song "Life" ???

That was awesome

Then the lead singer got a Johnny Rzeznik makeover

It's like the "punk" bands like Good Charlotte....you know they get their mohawks done professionally and iron their punk clothes before wearing them and they buy pre-ripped designer clothing...

ANYWAY

carry on

It's interesting you say that about Life...most of the people on OLP's message board don't like that song. I love it. Gravity is alright, it's not my favorite album, but I still like the band for the most part and have enjoyed all of their previous work.

I have Clumsy, the album. It's pretty decent, but the singer takes some time to adjust to.

I've heard somewhere OLP actually supported Creed on one tour or something. This is completely unconfirmed by me, of course.

if you want to give OLP a fair go of it, d/l a few of these songs:

The Wonderful Future

In Repair

Right Behind You

4 a.m.

Naveed

Made to Heal

Middle of Yesterday

Potato Girl

Blister

Starseed

Car Crash

Waited

Thief

those are some good songs...

OLP went down post-Naveed.

Stuff before that album was OK - nothing special, but most certainly not this insipid.

...good choices Wanderer (Thief is my favourite), but you forgot:

Clumsy

Annie

Automatic Flowers

One Man Army

Is Anybody Home

Please, please don't EVER compare Creed and OLP. I plead, for the love of god, don't do that. It gives me heart trouble, anyurisms, etc.

Listen to "With arms wide open' and then listen to Clumsy. You'll see the difference.

Creed is a bunch of zero-talent hacks, lead by Scott Stapp - a guy who thinks he's god.

I'm not saying OLP is much better (I'm a bigger fan of their old stuff, but hey. Veryone wanst the $$ and the $$ are in the mainstream).
