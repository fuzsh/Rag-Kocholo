        "text": "Why Major in Commercial Music?\n\nThe meteoric rise of digital media has dramatically expanded career opportunities in the music industry. Everything from movies to video games to advertising needs a soundtrack, boosting demand for studio musicians, composers, arrangers and managers.\n\nAnd there’s no better place than Belmont to prepare for a career in this growing industry. Our state-of-the-art studios in the heart of Nashville’s legendary Music Row give you access to some of the industry’s top performers, record companies and producers.\n\nOur program – the first of its kind in the nation – builds on a strong foundation of classical music, jazz and blues to equip you for a career in any genre. Whether your passion is bluegrass, pop, R&B, rock, gospel or Christian contemporary, you’ll prepare to thrive on stage or in the studio.\n\nWhat You'll Learn\n\nAs a commercial music student at Belmont, you'll get a thorough grounding in the building blocks of music, including theory, aural skills and the history of music. You'll learn the fundamentals of music business and audio engineering and explore topics such as digital musicianship.\n\nYou'll also have the flexibility to pursue your passions. You’ll choose an area of emphasis from five options:\n\nPerformance\n\nPrepare for a career on stage, on the road or in the studio concentrating on any genre, including country, pop, contemporary Christian, Jazz, Bluegrass and more. The performance emphasis gives you the chance to study with established musicians in the studio and beyond. You'll study theory, ear training, harmony, ensemble orchestration, applied lessons, studio techniques and piano. You'll also have many opportunities to perform, including both a junior and senior recital in Massey Concert Hall.\n\n*Performance emphasis must be confirmed by the applied faculty in the performance area after the student completes their first commercial jury at the end of the fourth semester.\n\nComposition and Arranging\n\nThis program prepares you to write and arrange music for orchestras, choirs, bands and other music organizations as well as for films, TV, gaming and much more. In this emphasis, you'll build skills in commercial arranging and orchestration for small and large ensembles. Many of our graduates have become influential composers and arrangers for the music industry in Nashville and beyond.\n\n*Composition and Arranging emphasis must be confirmed after submission and approval of required material—typically by mid-term of the second semester.\n\nMusic Business\n\nThis emphasis leads to careers in tour promotion and management, publishing, copyright, artist development/A&R and much more. Graduate with a well-rounded understanding of the music industry and the capabilities of a performing musician. In addition to core music courses such as applied lessons, music theory and ear training, you'll take courses in entertainment industry studies and the business of music.\n\nSongwriting\n\nCreate original lyrics, instrumental accompaniment and often demo recordings. You’ll learn from award-winning Nashville songwriters and prepare for a dynamic career as a singer-songwriter. This emphasis includes courses in commercial songwriting and lyric writing. Songwriting students become top-notch songwriters in a variety of genres, including pop, rock, country, folk and R&B. The degree culminates in a recital in Massey Concert Hall.\n\nAfter admission as a Commercial Music Major, you must submit songwriting materials for approval to be accepted in the Songwriting Emphasis program. Learn more about the songwriting application process.\n\nMusic Technology\n\nThe use of the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and “cloud-based” music libraries has opened many new possibilities for music professionals, including sound technician, producer, audio-visual specialist and more. Explore a rapidly changing discipline with massive career potential. In this emphasis, you'll gain a broad knowledge of audio and MIDI-based programming and a portfolio of self-produced Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)-based productions. As a culminating project, you'll incorporate sequenced tracks into your senior recital.\n\nWhichever option you choose, you'll build the skills you need to take your career to the next level."
