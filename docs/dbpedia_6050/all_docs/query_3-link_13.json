        "text": "In the Songwriter Of The Year, Non-Classical category, the submission guidelines were amended to allow a wider representation from the songwriter community.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThis Category recognizes the written excellence, profession and art of songwriting.\n\nThis Category is for songwriters whose body of work released for the first time during the current eligibility year represents artistic excellence in the area of songwriting.\n\nSongwriters must have written a minimum of four songs in which they are credited as a songwriter or co-writer. Songs in which the songwriter was also credited as a Primary or Featured Artist or Producer do not qualify to achieve a minimum song threshold for consideration.\n\nIn addition, songwriters may enter up to five more songs in which the songwriter has songwriting credits as well as additional credits such as Primary or Featured Artist, Producer, or any other supporting role.\n\nThe maximum number of songs cannot exceed nine. In the event that over nine titles are entered for a given songwriter, the final determination of which songs will appear on the ballot will be made by the songwriter or the songwriter’s representatives.\n\nSongs from albums released in a previous year are not eligible, even if released as a single or added to a new album released during the current eligibility year. Rereleased, covered, remixed, reissued, and historical recordings of songs are not eligible.\n\nThe Best Remixed Recording Category moved from the Production, Engineering, Composition & Arrangement Field into the Pop & Dance/Electronic Field to make the category more accessible to Dance/Electronic voting members.\n\nConjunto music was moved from the Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano) Category to the Best Regional Roots Music Album Category to be recognized as a Roots music genre separate from its descendant, Tejano music.\n\nThe Best Pop Dance Recording category was renamed to Best Dance Pop Recording to align with the established sub-genre of Dance.\n\nThe Best Dance/Electronic Music Album category was renamed to Best Dance/Electronic Album and the category criteria was amended to ensure the category correctly reflects Dance/Electronic recordings rather than a majority of Dance Pop tracks.\n\nAmendment:\n\nAlbums must be made up of at least 50% Dance/Electronic recordings to qualify.\n\nThe Best Score Soundtrack for Video Games and Other Interactive Media category was amended to include a qualification for released material, specifically new DLC (downloaded content in-game) and Seasonal Expansions.\n\nAmendment:\n\nGreater than 50% of the music on an otherwise eligible Video Game Soundtrack or Interactive Media soundtrack must be derived from new episodes or new programming that is released during the GRAMMY eligibility year for which it is entered. This will apply to new DLC (downloaded content in-game) and Seasonal Expansions as well as brand new content.\n\nThe Best Traditional R&B Performance category criteria was amended to more accurately represent recordings that embody the classic elements of R&B/Soul music, distinguishing them from contemporary interpretations of the genre.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThis Category recognizes excellence in traditional R&B performance and is intended for recordings that contain classic R&B/Soul vocal, instrumental and compositional elements in a style that distinctly sets its artistic intention apart from a contemporary approach to the genre.\n\nThe Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album category criteria was amended to expand the category by broadening its scope and welcoming more entries from the Musical Theater community outside of the standard cast recording criteria for the Best Musical Theater Album category.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThis category recognizes excellence in albums consisting of a type and style of song and/or performance that cannot properly be intermingled with present forms of pop music. This includes new performances of songs from sources such as the Great American Songbook and classic forms of popular music of any era. Additionally, this category includes albums of musical theatre songs that, unlike cast albums, are independent of a unifying narrative or underlying dramatic theme. Recordings eligible for this Category include: - contemporary pop songs performed in a traditional pop style – the term ‘traditional’ being a reference, equally, to the style of the composition, vocal styling and the instrumental arrangement, without regard to the age of the material. - songs defined by one or more of the following qualities inherent in musical theater: a theatrical style of composition, vocal/instrumental performance, and/or arrangement. - benefit, tribute, concert, and cabaret albums featuring performances of repertoire as defined above.\n\nAdditional eligibility criteria:\n\nAlbums in this category must contain more than 75% of newly recorded (previously unreleased) performances.\n\nThe Best Children’s Music Album category criteria was amended to include a requirement that lyrics and English language translations must be included with entry submissions. Additionally, an intended audience age range for this category was defined as infant to twelve years old.\n\nAmendment:\n\nThis category recognizes excellence in children’s music recordings that utilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of children’s music. Because these albums must be created and intended specifically for children, lyrics and English language translations are required with entry submissions.\n\nAll children’s music recordings belong in this category, including those with musical style rooted in Latin music, gospel, rock, rap, etc. Instrumental only albums must show a stylistic intention, song structure, content and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of children’s music. The word “children” is used with a specific age range defined as infant to twelve years old, differentiating between a child and a teen.\n\nChildren’s spoken word albums are eligible in Best Spoken Word Poetry Album and Best Audio Book, Narration, and Storytelling Recording. Soundtrack albums of children’s movies are eligible in Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media.\n\nEligibility Requirements Updates:\n\nAll eligibly-credited Featured Artists with under 50% playtime are awarded a Winners’ Certificate for all genre album categories (except Musical Theatre Album, General Field categories and Craft categories).\n\n66th GRAMMY Press List Changes\n\nEach year the Recording Academy makes adjustments to the nominations list as necessary after the list is first published. Common changes are often the result of updated credits and may include spelling corrections, title modifications and the addition of nominees who were not included in the original submission, among other revisions. We are making these updates public to ensure transparency and accessibility to the most up-to-date and accurate information.\n\n3/7/24\n\nCATEGORY 73/BEST MUSIC VIDEO/RUSH/TROYE SIVAN\n\nAdd the following video producers: Josefine Bothe, Amelie Fleur, Kevin Kloecker.\n\n2/21/24\n\nCATEGORY 11/BEST POP/DANCE RECORDING/ONE IN A MILLION/BEBE REXHA & DAVID GUETTA\n\nAdd Timofey Reznikov as a producer.\n\n2/12/24\n\nCATEGORY 52/BEST CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC PERFORMANCE/SONG/YOUR POWER/LECRAE & TASHA COBBS LEONARD\n\nRemove the following nominees: Patrick Darius Mix, Jr. & Justin Pelham\n\n1/8/24\n\nCATEGORY 21/BEST R&B SONG/BACK TO LOVE/ROBERT GLASPER FEATURING SiR & ALEX ISLEY\n\nAdd Riley Glasper as songwriter\n\n12/19/23\n\nCATEGORY 74/BEST MUSIC FILM/DEAR MAMA/TUPAC\n\nAdd Jody Gerson as a Producer\n\nCATEGORY 78/ BEST HISTORICAL ALBUM/ FRAGMENTS- TIME OUT OF MIND SESSIONS/BOB DYLAN\n\nAdd Restoration Engineer : Michael H.

The new Field structure is:\n\nGeneral\n\nPop & Dance/Electronic Music\n\nRock, Metal & Alternative Music\n\nR&B, Rap & Spoken Word Poetry\n\nJazz, Traditional Pop, Contemporary Instrumental & Musical Theater\n\nCountry & American Roots Music\n\nGospel & Contemporary Christian Music\n\nLatin, Global, African, Reggae & New Age, Ambient, Or Chant\n\nChildren's, Comedy, Audio Book Narration and Storytelling, Visual Media & Music Video/Film\n\nPackage, Notes & Historical\n\nProduction, Engineering, Composition & Arrangement\n\nClassical\n\nThe Best Improvised Jazz Solo category was renamed to Best Jazz Performance and the criteria was amended. The award goes to all musicians who share in the creation of a single jazz recording.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis category recognizes excellence in a performance by a jazz solo artist, collaborating artists, established duos, or groups, with emphasis on jazz improvisation and ensemble interaction. Jazz instrumental and jazz vocal tracks are both eligible.\n\nThe category Best Regional Mexican Music Album (Including Tejano) was renamed to Best Música Mexicana Album (Including Tejano) and the criteria was amended.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis category recognizes excellence in recordings of Música Mexicana including all the styles: banda, norteño, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, rancheros, sierreño, jarocho, huasteco and huapango, as well as Tejano music. Eligible albums utilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of música Mexicana and Tejano music styles and cultures. Albums with lyrics that are greater than 50 percent in Spanish or albums with music content that is primarily of a traditional Mexican music genre in style are eligible. The musical style is determinative not the ethnicity of the performer(s).\n\nThe category criteria for Best Music Film was amended by removing the greater than 50 percent performance-based material requirement, and a National Craft Committee was created to adjudicate the categories of Best Music Video and Best Music Film.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis Category recognizes excellence in concert/performance films or music documentaries released for sale to the public for the first time or first appearing on television or online during the current eligibility year. This Category includes music-focused and individual music videos that together create a visual album (if videos are packaged and entered together as one cohesive film). While dramatic feature films and biopics are not eligible, films with fictional elements are eligible.\n\nEpisodes from television/online series, award shows, music competition shows, fictional music films, and musical biopics are not eligible as music films. Nor are re-edited or repackaged old (more than five years from release date) programs compilations of music videos by various artists, or any video films or promotional clips that were eligible in a previous eligibility year or compilations of such. The addition of bonus material to an otherwise ineligible music film does not make the release eligible.\n\nA new category was created in the Pop & Dance/Electronic Music Field: Best Pop Dance Recording\n\nCriteria:\n\nPop Dance is generally uptempo, danceable music that follows a pop arrangement, featuring strong rhythmic beats, significant electronic-based instruments with an emphasis on the vocal performance, melody and hooks. Pop Dance is highly eclectic, borrowing influences from other genres and is generally suitable for a contemporary pop audience. Additionally, it is common for Pop Dance to be inspired by many sub genres of Dance & Electronic music, but be differentiated by vocals that are generally present throughout and high in the mix.\n\nThe category criteria was amended for Best Dance/Electronic Music Album.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis Category recognizes excellence in recordings from established Dance and Electronic genres such as House, Techno, Trance, Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Electronica, as well as other emerging Dance and Electronic genres, with production and sensibilities distinctly different from a Pop approach. The Category is open to recordings specifically and originally targeted to the Dance and/or Electronic market, with significant electronic-based instrumentation generally based around a rhythmic dance beat.\n\nThe category criteria were amended for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis Category recognizes excellence in recordings from established Dance and Electronic genres such as House, Techno, Trance, Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Electronica, as well as other emerging Dance and Electronic genres, with production and sensibilities distinctly different from a Pop approach.\n\nThe Category is open to recordings specifically and originally targeted to the Dance and/or Electronic market, with significant electronic-based instrumentation generally based around a rhythmic dance beat.\n\nA new category was created in the Latin, Global, African, Reggae & New Age, Ambient, Or Chant Field: Best African Music Performance\n\nCriteria:\n\nEligible recordings include vocal and instrumental performances with strong elements of African cultural significance that blend a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content and/or musical representation found in Africa and the African Diaspora. The African Diaspora is the worldwide collection of communities descended from native Africans or people from Africa, predominantly in the Americas.\n\nA new category was created in the Jazz, Traditional Pop, Contemporary Instrumental & Musical Theater Field: Alternative Jazz Album\n\nCriteria:\n\nThis category recognizes artistic excellence in Alternative Jazz albums by individuals, duos, groups/ensembles (large or small), with or without vocals. Alternative Jazz may be defined as a genre-blending, envelope-pushing hybrid that mixes jazz (improvisation, interaction, harmony, rhythm, arrangements, composition, and style) with other genres, including R&B, Hip-Hop, Classical, Contemporary Improvisation, Experimental, Pop, Rap, Electronic/Dance music, and/or Spoken Word. It may also include the contemporary production techniques/instrumentation associated with other genres. (Instrumental albums in the well-established Smooth Jazz style will remain in the Contemporary Instrumental category.)\n\nThe category criteria were amended for Best Jazz Vocal Album.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis Category recognizes excellence in albums by jazz vocal soloists, duos, or jazz vocal groups (including small or large jazz vocal ensembles), and/or large ensembles featuring voice, with specific attention to the differentiating elements of the vocal performance/interpretation itself, and without limitations to language (Portuguese and Spanish included). Solo jazz vocal elements include improvisational phrasing, melodic-based improvisation (lyric, word, or scat), jazz style, and utilization of harmonic/melodic vocabulary found within the jazz genre. Ensemble jazz vocal elements may include rhythm/feel, harmony, inflection, improvisation, arrangement/writing, and phrasing.\n\nThe vocal performance may be by a solo performer, duo, group (including large jazz vocal ensembles), or collaboration and may be in any language (including Portuguese and Spanish).\n\nIf a vocalist(s) and an instrumentalist(s) are billed equally, both (or all) may be eligible for a GRAMMY. This determination, as with cases in which the co-billing involves a band as a whole, will be at the discretion of the Academy.\n\nAn entire album entered in the Jazz Vocal Category may not be entered again in a Jazz Instrumental Category, even if the artist is shifted. If the vocalist(s) and instrumentalist(s) are billed equally, the Academy will determine the appropriate Category based on number of vocal tracks versus instrumental tracks; or, if the number of tracks is equal, the total playing time of the vocal versus instrumental tracks.\n\nThe category criteria were amended for Best Latin Jazz Album.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nThis category recognizes excellence in Latin Jazz albums by ensembles of any size or orchestration (with added vocals or not), representing the blending of Jazz and improvisation with any Latin and Iberian-American music, Brazilian, and Argentinian tango music.\n\nThe category criteria were amended for Best Classical Compendium.\n\nNew Criteria:\n\nFor an album developed and united by an artist, composer, tribute, thematic idea, musical, or other unifying concept. Classical crossover projects and albums of at least 50 percent playing time of music that intersects various genres with Classical Music are also eligible in this category. Albums may embody historic, spoken, and/or documentary material, if those portions do not exceed 49 percent total playing time. Albums entered in Classical Compendium may not be entered in other classical categories, but individual tracks/pieces may be entered in other categories. Award to the artists, conductors, composers, and producers with 50 percent or more playing time.\n\nEligibility Requirements Update\n\nAll eligibly credited Immersive Producer(s) and Immersive Engineer/Mixer(s) are awarded with a certificate in every category where a producer or engineer would be honored (genre album categories, performance categories, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Historical Album).\n\nThe GRAMMY Award recognizes creative excellence. Only human creators are eligible to be submitted for consideration for, nominated for, or win a GRAMMY Award. A work that contains no human authorship is not eligible in any Categories. A work that features elements of A.I. material (i.e., material generated by the use of artificial intelligence technology) is eligible in applicable Categories; however: (1) the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful and more than de minimis; (2) such human authorship component must be relevant to the Category in which such work is entered (e.g., if the work is submitted in a songwriting Category, there must be meaningful and more than de minimis human authorship in respect of the music and/or lyrics; if the work is submitted in a performance Category, there must be meaningful and more than de minimis human authorship in respect of the performance); and (3) the author(s) of any A.I. material incorporated into the work are not eligible to be nominees or GRAMMY recipients insofar as their contribution to the portion of the work that consists of such A.I material is concerned. De minimis is defined as lacking significance or importance; so minor as to merit disregard.\n\nOnline Entry Process & Nominations Change Requests Update:\n\nFor each entry in the Awards’ Online Entry Process, the entrant is required to provide the UPC or ISRC number for the recording being submitted for GRAMMY consideration and to upload and confirm full track listing and final crediting of the recording.\n\nAt the time of submission, the submitter will receive a list of names they have submitted as eligibly credited.

Pop Dance is highly eclectic, borrowing influences from other genres and is generally suitable for a contemporary pop audience. Additionally, it is common for Pop Dance to be inspired by many sub genres of Dance & Electronic music, but be differentiated by vocals that are generally present throughout and high in the mix.\n\nA new category was created in the Latin, Global, Africa, Reggae & New Age, Ambient, Or Chant Field: Best African Music Performance\n\nCriteria:\n\nEligible recordings include vocal and instrumental performances with strong elements of African cultural significance that blend a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content and/or musical representation found in Africa and the African Diaspora. The African Diaspora is the worldwide collection of communities descended from native Africans or people from Africa, predominantly in the Americas.\n\nA new category was created in the Jazz, Traditional Pop, Contemporary Instrumental & Musical Theater Field: Alternative Jazz Album\n\nCriteria:\n\nThis category recognizes artistic excellence in Alternative Jazz albums by individuals, duos, groups/ensembles (large or small), with or without vocals. Alternative Jazz may be defined as a genre-blending, envelope-pushing hybrid that mixes jazz (improvisation, interaction, harmony, rhythm, arrangements, composition, and style) with other genres, including R&B, Hip-Hop, Classical, Contemporary Improvisation, Experimental, Pop, Rap, Electronic/Dance music, and/or Spoken Word. It may also include the contemporary production techniques/instrumentation associated with other genres.\n\nProducer Of The Year, Non-Classical and Songwriter Of The Year, Non-Classical were added to the General Field and the number of final nominees for each of these categories is five."
