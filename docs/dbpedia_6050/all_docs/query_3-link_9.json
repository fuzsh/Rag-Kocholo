        "text": "About Aladdin Trouble\n\nThe hit team of Johnson and Langwade have done it again with another bestselling, bright and shiny panto for you to get your audience up on their feet and cheering for!\n\nTHE SONGS\n\nWhile these 11 songs have such breadth in musical variety and character expression, they all have one thing in common – they are simply unbelievably catchy and enjoyable! Jasmine has a song of independence and girl power, Widow Twankey and her Wishy Washy crew have a cheeky, laugh-out-loud washing song, and there’s a bustling market song, a heartwarming ballad and SO much more – there is truly something for everyone!\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThis has all the adventure of the original Aladdin story, but with enough witty banter and wow factor to keep you smiling long after the curtain call. This is a story of belonging, identity, friendship, magic and of course, good conquering evil!\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\n\nFollow an independent princess finding her identity, the cheeky chappy Aladdin trying to stay out of trouble and win the girl of his dreams, and of course, a wish-granting Genie who happens to be in the right place at the right time! We've made sure to include all the essential panto villians too- so get practising your boos and hisses!\n\nTHE EXTRAS\n\nThis musical comes with all the expected resources for a seamless rehearsal process, from performance tips to staging notes, props and costume ideas – we’ve got you covered. Fancy a peak behind the curtain? Check out our behind-the-scenes video here in this tab!\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\n‘Brilliant. There are hardly any words to describe it it’s so good.’\n\n‘When every parent tells you it was the best show ever and that their faces hurt from laughing & smiling so much you know it's an absolute winner! Wish I could give it 6 stars!!’\n\n‘An amazing production as usual! Cannot recommend this highly enough! Great score and script!’"
