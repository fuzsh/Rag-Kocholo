They really arent very much alike at all. I also think Our Lady Peace is decent band, where I think Creed is Satan's gift to music. Check out OLP's song, Life.

I tried to find some Real Audio of OLP, but all I could find was this song. I'm starting to think the Creed comparison was a little off, but I really don't hear what the big deal is about these guys. Somewhere Out There sounds very generic and common.

They arent \"the next big thing\" or anything. They were just a decent alt. rock band, this new album is a little more mainstream I think. I prefer some of their older stuff. I'm sick of that \"Somewhere Out There\" song too, but comparing them to Creed?
