Such a disappointment. I love the first one so much.

This one had ZERO character development for three of the girls and only concentrated on one. You learned zip about the other three. The original movie, with a back story for each girl, made you root for them. This one decided character development didn't matter.

It had its interesting moments and threw in a twist, but once the twist happened, they had a horrible score behind it that detracted from the scene so much, I thought, "Ugh, who decided on this crappy music?"

What a shame. I still never get sick of the original.
