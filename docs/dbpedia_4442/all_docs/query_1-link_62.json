Since then, the brewery has grown to be one of the largest independent craft brewers in the country, with our beer available in all 50 states and Mexico. But every drop of our award-winning beer is still brewed right here in Shiner, TX, where it all started over 100 years ago. For more, visit www.shiner.com."
