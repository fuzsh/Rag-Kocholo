        "text": "I live and work in the country. A small Texas town similar to Shiner. When I give directions to folks from a big city, referencing a Farm to Market road is often met with a confused question mark. FM? What‚Äôs that? Always makes me giggle. üôÇ\n\nThis ale is named after FM 966 located in Shiner, TX. I‚Äôd never tried a Farmhouse Ale before, but I really enjoyed this special Spring brew. This ale is super drinkable and delicious ‚Äì smooth, refreshing, and perfect to sip on a warm Spring day in Texas!\n\nFrom the label: ‚ÄúA few centuries ago, during the cold winter months, farmhands in Europe brewed a ‚Äòseasonal provision‚Äô Farmhouse Ale to be enjoyed once spring rolled around. In the farmlands of Shiner, TX that tradition lives on which is why our tribute to this style uses Golding, Sterling and Meridian hops for a sweet yet lightly spiced flavor. Our incredibly refreshing farmhouse ale bears the name of the farm to market road just to the south of where our brewery has proudly stood for over 100 years.‚Äù\n\nHey everyone! So, this is the last post regarding my lovely trip to Shiner. My awesome husband recorded a few video clips during our time there and complied them into a short video if you‚Äôre interested in watching:\n\nAlso, there is a sweet Shiner giveaway! One lucky reader will receive a Shiner cookbook and a set of Shiner coasters ‚Äì woohoo! Straight from Shiner, TX!\n\nHere‚Äôs the name of the game:\n\nTo enter, you HAVE to leave a comment on this blog post and make sure your email is somehow attached. Here‚Äôs what you need to comment on:\n\n1. Visit www.shiner.com and tell me what your favorite brew is ‚Äì or ‚Äì if you‚Äôve never had Shiner beers, tell me which one you‚Äôd most like to try!\n\n2. Additional Entry: Subscribe to my blog and leave a comment saying that you‚Äôve done so (if you‚Äôre a current subscriber, simply comment saying so)\n\nIt‚Äôs easy as that! The giveaway will be closed on Tuesday, July 12 at 12:00 midnight. I‚Äôll use a random number generator to pick the winner and post the info on Wednesday, July 13th. Good luck! And as they say in Shiner‚Ä¶Prosit! üôÇ\n\nSo after the group tour, Anne took the three of us on an extended private tour of the brewery. It was awesome getting to see the whole process up close. We got to see everything we viewed from afar upstairs; the bottles going in for filling, capping, labeling, and packaging.\n\nSome cool production facts:\n\n-They have 80 tanks for fermenting\n\n-85% of their production is Shiner Bock\n\n-They make 600,000 barrels a year\n\n-635 bottles are filled a minute\n\n-They produce 1000 kegs a day\n\n-Less than 3% of the bottles are damaged in production\n\nThe brewery is very good about being economical and resourceful ‚Äì if a bottle has a label error, it‚Äôs taken to be cleaned and then reused. If a bottle breaks in the process, the glass is kept and sent back to their manufacturer to be recycled. We got to see the bottle graveyard‚Ä¶rest in pieces‚Ä¶\n\nThen we were taken to the packaging area, where the bottles are placed into 6 packs, then put into cases.\n\nThen after a pallet of cases is ready, they are stacked and sent to get wrapped in shrink wrap for safe transporting.\n\nThen we were taken to another section of the brewery where the kegs are produced and stored. It was a very happy place. üôÇ\n\nThe kegs are highly monitored for quality and quantity standards, and once they‚Äôre up to par, are sent to packaging and meet the shrink wrap machine too. Anne was telling us how they used to do that part by hand and it was very time consuming, as one can imagine. They would also play around sometimes and a poor brewery employee would end up like a shrink wrapped mummy. üôÇ\n\nThen we wandered through the shipping/receiving area and headed back towards the gift shop. When guests are done with the tour, they‚Äôre given four wooden coins to trade for a small cup of their choice of brew. (don‚Äôt worry, they have kid-friendly options too!) So we perused the gift shop and picked up some goodies while enjoying a fresh taste of our favorite beers.\n\nThen, we had a nice surprise ‚Äì Anne had asked Jimmy, the current brewmaster, to come over and meet us! Jimmy was a pleasure to speak with‚Ä¶he‚Äôs been working at the Spoetzl Brewery since he was a teenager. He started at the bottom of the food chain and has steadily worked his way to becoming the brewmaster. That was such a great thing to hear ‚Äì knowing that hard work pays off and now, he knows all the different aspects of the brewery from experience. He was such a kind man and after asking about any upcoming special brews, we were told of one that‚Äôs in the works. I won‚Äôt spill the beans, but folks, it sounds amazing!\n\nJimmy then introduced us to an awesome man named T-Bone, the shipping supervisor. He directed us to bring our car around to the loading area for a special treat. Let‚Äôs just say we had several extra passengers for the drive home! üôÇ\n\nFun fact: You‚Äôll see a cute little white house on the property too ‚Äì this is where Cecile Spoetzl, Kosmos‚Äô daughter also known as ‚ÄúMiss Celie‚Äù, lived while she ran the brewery after her father‚Äôs death.\n\nThen we went back inside to finish our sampling and relaxed in the hospitality room, where they show a video about the history of the brewery. There‚Äôs also this cool artwork on the wall, featuring Kosmos Spoetzl wearing that purple and green tie!\n\nWe went outside to take some more photos and finally had to say goodbye to the lovely town of Shiner. (I really want one of those benches, by the way!)\n\nThank you again to everyone we encountered on our trip ‚Äì yall made it a truly unforgettable experience! An extra special thanks to Anne, Jimmy, and T-Bone: your generosity, kindness, and obvious love of Shiner beers has not gone unnoticed. I hope to visit yall again in the future! Prosit!\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing finer than an ice cold Shiner‚Äù ‚Äì while this slogan stands true, I think visiting the place where the magic happens is rather fine too. üôÇ Last week, I had the chance to finally visit Shiner, TX ‚Äì home of the Spoetzl Brewery and motherland of Shiner beers. This will be a two-part post, because I have A LOT to share! Let me start by saying that the hospitality, kindness, and generosity experienced on this trip were extraordinary. Thanks to everyone we encountered who made it a truly wonderful experience.\n\nJason, myself, and our friend Jessica headed out bright and early to beat the North Texas traffic as we headed south to Shiner. We jammed to Relient K‚Äôs new EP and chatted the whole way, enjoying views of the Texas countryside as we headed to our destination. After arriving an hour early (woo! lack of traffic!) we headed inside to meet up with Anne, who was our guide for the day and a sweetheart from the beginning.\n\nShe pointed us in the right direction for a quick lunch before our tour, so we headed to Friday‚Äôs Fried Chicken, a local joint just up the road from the brewery. Friday‚Äôs was such a homey small town eatery where the locals and visitors alike converged. With a wide selection of sandwiches, homemade baked goods, and of course, fried chicken, we definitely enjoyed our lunch.\n\nWe got back to the brewery just in time for the 1:30 tour which Anne was leading. She was the perfect combination of Southern hospitality and professionalism ‚Äì keeping everyone interested and answering questions like a pro. Anne allowed us to take pictures on the tour (thanks!) but sadly our nice camera was accidently left at home, so iPhone photos will have to suffice. We started on the lower level as a group and were given a brief history of the Spoetzl Brewery. There were some neat photos of Kosmos Spoetzl, the first brewer and namesake of the Shiner brewery. Besides being an excellent brewmaster who was handpicked for the job by the local Germans and Czechs, he was known to be a fun and colorful man, wearing a purple and green tie in this famous image.\n\nThen the group was led upstairs to where the brew kettles and the brewery‚Äôs laboratory are located. (Beckster was pretty excited to see the ‚ÄúLaboratory‚Äù sign, as one can imagine) The brews are seriously tested and monitored for quality levels ‚Äì only the best!\n\nCups of hops were passed around so we could see and smell the different kinds used for different brews. Love the hands on aspect! Interesting fact: their hops are from Germany, the Czech Republic, and Washington.\n\nThen we moved on to another section where you could peek into the brewery and see all the action happening, from bottling to capping, labeling to packaging. We got to see the crew at work and even witnessed them fixing a jam in the machinery. Thanks for your hard work, Shiner employees. üôÇ\n\nAnne walked us through the brewing process and discussed each of the current Shiner brews. She even shared some favorite recipes and stories of her own, like brownies made with the Shiner Bohemian Black Lager.\n\nSide note: To any readers living in states with more strict alcohol laws (like Oklahoma), to find your favorite beers with higher than 3.2% alcohol content by weight (rather than the low-point versions), visit liquor stores to find what you seek. Good to know!\n\nPS: If you‚Äôre ever on this tour yourself, check out the ‚ÄúKing of Beers‚Äù chair. You‚Äôll know what I mean üôÇ\n\nTurnover is very low at the brewery, and understandably so! The employees are well taken care of ‚Äì benefits are wonderful and there‚Äôs no forced retirement. Fun fact: the longest working employee at the brewery was there for 63 years! While the brewery has seen its ups and downs, they‚Äôve recently expanded to 90 employees after adding extra shifts. A very good sign ‚Äì business is growing as more people fall in love with Shiner‚Äôs spectacular brews!\n\nFrom here, the group was led down to the gift shop for shopping and sampling. But more on that later ‚Äì the three of us were lucky enough to then go on an extended tour with Anne. Can‚Äôt wait to share more!\n\nStay tuned for part two where you‚Äôll get a glimpse of what happens behind the scenes at the Spoetzl Brewery! üôÇ"
