        "text": "Shiner is one of Texas' most historic and famous beer brands, but if you want to tour the Spoetzl Brewery where it's made, you have to go on a weekday. That changes soon.\n\nBeginning June 16, the brewery is offering Saturday tours on the hour between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.. Tours are free and do not require a reservation. This is the first time Spoetzl has offered weekend tours following years of requests from visitors, according to a statement. Visitors can also expect live music, beer tastings and food trucks onsite.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inaugural weekend coincides with Father's Day, so if dear old dad loves a cold Shiner Bock, consider treating him to a tour. Dads walk away with a special edition pint glass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpoetzl Brewery was founded in 1909 in Shiner, Texas.\n\nEat Drink D-FW\n\nThe latest food and drink reviews, recipes and info on the D-FW food scene.\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nh/t San Antonio Express News"
