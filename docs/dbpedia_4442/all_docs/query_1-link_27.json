        "text": "“Don’t mess with Texas” is an age-old slogan that brings a lot of feelings and sentiment to those who read it … or so I thought. A handful of years ago, I visited Texas and learned it was an anti-littering slogan that has been turned into much, much more. Besides learning all about Texas during my stay, I also enjoyed the beers I was able to get my hands on, especially those from Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, TX. I wasn’t lucky to visit Shiner, but I got a taste of it recently when I enjoyed Shiner 1909.\n\nThe back of each bottle states that “1909” is “our founding year” followed by “Since 1909, the expert brewers in Shiner, TX have been crafting exceptional beers inspired by our German and Czech founders. To honor their legacy, we’ve brewed this heritage lager using only the same simple ingredients they used in 1909. Heritage 2-row barley is paired with noble hops for a delightfully flavorful and perfectly balanced lager with a smooth, refreshing finish – a fitting tribute to over a century of brewing tradition. PROSIT!”\n\nWhen I saw and read that Shiner 1909 is a Heritage Lager with the history lesson on the back, I was all in. I’m a sucker for brewers and breweries who brew beers that follow original recipes or ones that only use ingredients used during the time period. Sounded like Spoetzl Brewery was doing both with Shiner 1909.\n\nThe Heritage Lager smelled, tasted, and finished like a solid American Lager. I agreed with the detailed description on how the beer was well balanced yet light and smooth. Even though it’s getting chilly and cold up in Michigan right now, I believe this beer could be enjoyed year round. It is perfect to accompany a hearty bowl of chilly on a cold winters day, out in the sun during the summer and everywhere in between.\n\nIf you’re looking for an amazing light beer and an interactive history lesson, give this one a try!\n\nCheers!\n\nDisclaimer: Ed received complementary beers of Shiner 1909 from Spoetzl Brewery for this review! Thank you!"
