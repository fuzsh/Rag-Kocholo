        "text": "Shiner TexHex Bruja's Brew\n\nIPA - 7% ABV\n\nPete\n\nSolid IPA - came off a little malty for me and some weird flavor too - maybe that was the cactus.\n\n​Ratings: Pete - 3 Shyoh's\n\nShiner 101 Czech Style Pilsner\n\nPilsner - 4.6% ABV\n\nPete\n\nThis is a solid, smooth, easy to drink pils. Not a ton of flavor, but it's not meant to have a ton of flavor.\n\nRatings: Pete - 4 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Bock\n\nBock - 4.4% ABV\n\nPete\n\nThis is a pretty good beer. It has some good sweetness to it going down and a very clean finish.\n\nRatings: Pete - 4 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Bohemian Black Lager\n\nDark Lager - 4.9% ABV\n\nPete\n\nThis is a pretty solid beer. It has the drinkability of a European lager, plus some nice dark malty flavors. The first sip was pretty bland for me, but it grew on me as it went down and those malts kicked in.\n\nRatings: Pete - 5 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Kosmos Reserve\n\nLager - 4.98% ABV\n\nPete\n\nI can't figure out this beer. When you take a sip, it feels like a bunch of flavor is about to hit you, but it just never shows up. It's a bit disappointing.\n\nRatings: Pete - 3 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Premium Beer\n\nGolden Lager - 4.5% ABV\n\nPete\n\nThis one looks and tastes like a crappy light beer. Skip it.\n\nRatings: Pete - 2 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Ruby Redbird\n\nFruit Beer - 4.01% ABV\n\nPete\n\nI don't taste grapefruit at all in this beer, but I sure do taste ginger. It is more ginger-y than ginger ale for sure. It is incredibly easy to drink, and quite good if you like ginger.\n\n​Ratings: Pete - 5 Shyoh's\n\nShiner Sea Salt & Lime\n\nLight Lager - 4% ABV\n\nPete\n\nWould be the ideal drink to chase a shot of tequila with. Hint of lime, easy drinking, not much flavor. Probably better options if you're not doing the tequila with it, but to each their own.\n\n​Ratings: Pete - 4 Shyoh's\n\nShiner White Wing\n\nBelgian Witbier - 4.7% ABV\n\nPete\n\nThis is a pretty solid wit. It's more flavorful than a Blue Moon, but not nearly as much as, say Allagash. Still, quite good.\n\nRatings: Pete - 5 Shyoh's"
