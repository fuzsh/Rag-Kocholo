We believe in transparency, and we’re committed to being upfront about our privacy practices, including how we treat your personal information. We know you care about your privacy too; this policy explains our privacy practices for KattsCurioCabinet.net (Pattern Site) and etsy.com/shop/KattsCurioCabinet (Etsy Shop). We will refer to KattsCurioCabinet.net and etsy.com/shop/KattsCurioCabinet collectively as the \"Site\").\n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share information when you purchase an item from us, contact us, or otherwise use our services through Etsy.com or its related sites and services.\n\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including Etsy or any third party services you access through Etsy. You can reference the Etsy Privacy Policy to learn more about its privacy practices.\n\n1. Information we Collect:\n\nTo fulfill your order, you must provide us with certain information (which you authorized Etsy to provide to us), such as your name, email address, postal address, payment information, and the details of the product that you’re ordering. You may also choose to provide us with additional personal information, if you contact me directly.\n\n2. Why We Need Your Information and How We Use It:\n\nWe rely on a number of legal bases to collect, use, and share your information, including:\n\n• As needed to provide our services, such as when we use your information to fulfill your order, to settle disputes, or to provide you customer support;\n\n• When you have provided your affirmative consent, which you may revoke at any time, such as by signing up for our mailing list;\n\n• If necessary to comply with a legal obligation or court order or in connection with a legal claim, such as retaining information about your purchases if required by tax law; and\n\n• As necessary for the purpose of our legitimate interests, if those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests, such as 1) providing and improving our services. We use your information to provide the services you requested and in our legitimate interest to improve our services; and 2) Compliance with the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use. We use your information as necessary to comply with our obligations under the Etsy Seller Policy and Terms of Use.\n\n3. Information Sharing and Disclosure:\n\nInformation about our customers is important to our business. We share your personal information for very limited reasons and in limited circumstances, as follows:\n\n• Etsy: We share information with Etsy as necessary to provide you my services and comply with our obligations under both the Etsy Seller Policy and Etsy Terms of Use.\n\n• Service providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to our shop, such as delivery companies (USPS). We will share your personal information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these services.\n\n• Business transfers: If we sell or merge our business, We may disclose your information as part of that transaction, only to the extent permitted by law.\n\n• Compliance with laws: We may collect, use, retain, and share your information if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to: (a) respond to legal process or to government requests; (b) enforce our agreements, terms and policies; (c) prevent, investigate, and address fraud and other illegal activity, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect the rights, property, and safety of our customers, or others.\n\n4.

However, we may also be required to retain this information to comply with my legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements. We generally keep your data for the following time periods: 7 years.\n\n5. Your Rights:\n\nIf you reside in certain territories, including the EU, you have a number of rights in relation to your personal information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below:\n\n• Access: You may have the right to access and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us using the contact information below.\n\n• Change, restrict, and delete, you may also have rights to change, restrict our use of, or delete your personal information. Absent exceptional circumstances (like where we are required to store data for legal reasons) we will generally delete your personal information upon request.\n\n• Object: You can object to (i) our processing of some of your information based on our legitimate interests and (ii) receiving marketing messages from us after providing your express consent to receive them. In such cases, we will delete your personal information unless we have compelling and legitimate grounds to continue using that information or if it is needed for legal reasons.\n\n• Complain: If you reside in the EU and wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local data protection authority.\n\nHow to Contact Me:\n\nFor purposes of EU data protection law, I, Katherine & Clifton Camp, am the data controller of your personal information.
