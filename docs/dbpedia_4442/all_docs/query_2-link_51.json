        "text": "Nothing chills you to the bone like suddenly seeing those red and blues in your rearview mirror while driving down a Texas highway.\n\nThis is especially true if you've got something in your car that police find less-than-desirable. If you've never experienced that sort of fear, it's butt-puckering and heart-dropping, and you were probably a MUCH better-behaved teenager than I was...\n\nIf you need a refresher, or you have a new teen driver in the family who's busy raising hell on Texas roads, it's a good idea to review this list of 7 things you do NOT want to get pulled over with in the Lone Star State. It might save you from extra trauma and expensive therapy in the future!\n\nI'd also like to point out an obvious no-no that seems to be missing from this list...\n\nYou don't want to get pulled over with a body...haha, but really. No dead bodies in the trunk, Mister, and I mean it!\n\nSide note: I had a nightmare I was driving around looking for somewhere to hide a body. It was 10/10 the most stressful dream I've ever had. When I woke up, I knew for certain that I was not cut out for a life of crime. I'm too much of a nervous Nelly. Nope.\n\nDo you have any other good ones to add to the list? Let me know in a comment below this article wherever you come across it!\n\nNow, keep scrolling for more silly, informative, and weird Texas-based content in the galleries below..."
