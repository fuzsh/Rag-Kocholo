        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are different types of vodka?\n\nThere is really just one type of vodka: a clear spirit that can be distilled from pretty much anything, from wheat to corn to grapes to potatoes to whey. It’s often distilled many times over and filtered to remove impurities, which traditionally resulted in a spirit without much flavor or odor other than alcohol. As mentioned in the intro, that has changed in recent years, and you will now find that certain vodkas do indeed have their own unique character–although some people still just want a truly neutral spirit.\n\nHow should you drink vodka?\n\nThe short answer is however you like it. There is no wrong or right way to enjoy vodka. That being said, while it’s a good idea to at least taste a vodka neat to really discover its character, this spirit is most often used in cocktails ranging from classics like the Martini, Moscow Mule, and Cosmpolitan to modern creations. Some people like to store vodka in the freezer so they can sip it ice cold–go ahead and try that if you like, but it will likely reduce the flavor.\n\nHow did we choose the vodka on this list?\n\nWe considered different factors when picking these vodka, with the emphasis being on taste. Because after all, despite a bottle’s availability or the hype surrounding it, that is the most important thing. Tasting vodka involves a combination of sensations, including the nose, palate, mouthfeel, and finish. And each category has different characteristics, so part of the process is to consider how an individual pick fits into its style overall. The bottles on this list represent the best vodka brands based on all of these options, providing a good overview of selections you can easily purchase in person or online that are good examples of each individual category.\n\nWhy should you trust us to pick the right vodka?\n\nJonah Flicker has been writing about whiskey and other spirits for a decade, visiting distilleries around the world to meet the people behind the bottles and find out more about their stories. He is a judge for the John Barleycorn Awards and New York World Wine and Spirits Competition, and his work has appeared in many national other lifestyle outlets besides Robb Report, including Esquire, Food & Wine, Men’s Journal, CNN, USA Today, and more."
