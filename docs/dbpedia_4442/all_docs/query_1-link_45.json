        "text": "While, technically, it may not have been totally gone from our market, it was almost invisible for several years. Now, Shiner brand beers again fill retailer shelves and tap handles in the Charleston WV region.\n\nEarlier this year, beer distributor Capitol Beverage Co. (The Beverage Market) re-established the line in its territories. We hear it was Nick Ashworth, who heads their craft beer operations, that had a lot to do with bringing Shiner back to the region. Joining venerable Shiner Bock in the Charleston market this past winter were brands like:\n\nStrawberry Blonde\n\nCandied Pecan\n\nTex Hex Bruja’s Bru IPA\n\nWeisse N Easy\n\nLight Blonde\n\nWicked Juicy IPA\n\nToasted Amber Lager\n\nReports from the market say that the new Shiner draft and can sales did well in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nShiner since 1909\n\nAll in all, it’s great to see the historic Shiner line being featured in the state. It’s one of the oldest craft breweries in America, and I find it has a special charm due to its long and storied history. The beer is very competitive in quality and price with the other regional and national craft brands we get in WV.\n\nI also like that the beer is attractively priced, with 6 packs going for around $10 or less in our market.\n\nThe beer we call Shiner is made by the Spoetzl Brewery located in Shiner, Texas. It was originally founded in 1909 by Czech and German immigrants. While it’s gone through several ownership groups, the brewery says that, to this day, every drop of their beer is brewed in Shiner, Texas.\n\nToday, it’s one of the country’s larger craft brewers, logging in an annual production of around a half million barrels. It now ranks 5th among domestic craft brewing companies.\n\nSince 1989, it has been owned by The Gambrinus Company, an independent, family-owned firm out of San Antonio, TX, which also owns Trumer Pils of Berkeley, California.\n\nThe Gambrinus family made its fame and fortune as one of the two U.S. importers of Corona Mexican beer. Beginning in 1986, it had the rights to sell Corona in Texas and 24 eastern states. It’s efforts were a large part of helping Corona sales skyrocket to become the best selling imported beer in the country.\n\nIn 2007, with Grupo Modelo (maker of the Corona brand beers) then 50% owned by InBev, Gambrinus lost its contractual rights to import Corona. Needing to focus elsewhere, Gambrinus invested heavily in modernizing and expanding the Spoetzl Brewery and enlarging its distribution.\n\nA modern, welcoming brewery operation\n\nThe Spoetzl Brewery is a beautiful, modern brewery operation that I had the opportunity to visit last November with the Beer Now group. I found it to be one of the most pleasant brewery visits I’ve ever made to a larger craft brewery.\n\nThe people there were so welcoming and friendly. The facilities were shiny, bright and spotless. Our hosts were informative and entertaining. And most importantly, the beer was very good. If you are ever in their part of Texas, definitely stop in for a tour or a beer. They also have a super merchandise shop full of an incredible array of Shiner branded goods.\n\nThe highlight for craft beer fans is the brewery tasting room. It is a don’t-miss treat, featuring around 20 different products. You’ll find a bunch of Shiner beverages you have never seen before. Do not shy away from trying them. I was impressed with the quality across the board, including with the seltzers.\n\nSpoetzl Brewery Tour Gallery\n\nClick on photo to enlarge\n\nMore About Shiner @ brewery link\n\n.\n\nThe author in front of a Shiner Bock wall at the Spoetzl Brewery during his visit with a group from the Beer Now Conference."
