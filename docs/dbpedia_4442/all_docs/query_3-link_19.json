        "text": "I know Christmas is over, but this is one of my favorite things about this past holiday season! I can hardly keep up with all of Shiner’s seasonal beers – they’re definitely keeping me on my toes and producing lots of tasty new brews. The Holiday Cheer is definitely on my list of top 5 favorite Shiner beers…I’m so sad that only one is left in the fridge and I have to wait another year for more! The subtle flavors of pecans and peaches make for a might good southern beer in my opinion. Though the guys might consider it a little too “girly”, it hits the spot for me. And how cute is this cap? Thanks for the gift, Shiner : )\n\nLets pretend I remembered to post this in October and not the beginning of December, ok? : )\n\nSorry, I procrastinated with the Shiner Oktoberfest. I actually still have a few in the fridge and have really enjoyed this seasonal brew. The amber colored beer has a very smooth taste. It’s full of malt flavor and a hint of sweetness in my opinion. (probably due to the caramel malts mentioned on the label)\n\nApparently this is the same beer as the Shiner 96th Anniversary brew and will now become a seasonal staple! I know you can’t find them at the store anymore, but next fall, be sure to try a Shiner Oktoberfest! Now to try the Shiner Holiday Cheer and maybe write about it in March : )\n\nI wasn’t sure what to expect from this beer…the name honestly intimidated me. I’m not a huge dark beer fan, so Bohemian Black Lager sounded pretty intense. But, I was pleasantly surprised! It wasn’t nearly as “dark” tasting as I’d expected and had a great deep flavor. The roasty aroma and malty taste delivered a very delicious beer that I’d love to have again!\n\nFrom the Shiner Site: “Bohemian Black Lager, crafted according to exacting old-world standards with imported Czech Saaz, Styrians Hops and selected roasted malts, is the darkest beer we brew. Initially added to the Shiner family as our 97 Anniversary Brew, the unique and complex flavor of this rare brew found such a following among our customers that we brought it back for good!”\n\nThe next beer in The Shiner Series is the Shiner Light! I enjoy a good light beer just as much as the next guy (or girl) and this one did not disappoint. Now, it was nothing life changing, but it sure is a good high quality light beer and I definitely recommend it. And one cool thing about the Shiner Light, the back of each bottle has the signature of a Shiner, TX resident to show that they approve of the quality and call it their own. What a neat way to add some personality to your product : )\n\nThe next beer in the Shiner Series is the Shiner Hefeweizen. This has quickly become a favorite in our house! The Hefeweizen is an unfiltered Bavarian style wheat beer brewed with lemon and orange zest. Then honey and yeast are added before it’s bottled, so it undergoes a second fermentation right in the bottle. We got to bust out our fancy beer glasses for this one, because to get the best flavor from the beer, you need to pour half of it into a glass, swirl the bottle a bit to activate the yeast, and then pour the rest in. The beer is a bit cloudy since it’s unfiltered and the yeast is in action, but it goes down so smoothly and the hint of citrus and honey makes it incredibly delicious! Definitely a keeper in my opinion.\n\nThe first in the Shiner series is the Kosmos Reserve. Apparently the first Kosmos beer was released many years ago, and this is the re-released version. It can only be found in the Family Reunion packs, so if you like it, sorry you can’t buy a whole six-pack! The Kosmos beer is named after Kosmos Spoetzl, the brewmaster who started the Spoetzl brewery in Shiner.\n\nIn college, I took a beverage survey class where we learned about the ins-and-outs of alcohol. One day when we studied beer, we got to play with an actual hop plant and see, smell, and even taste it. The smell is the most distinguishable aspect…I remember my hands smelled like hops all day! (and it wasn’t the best smell) Anyways, as for the taste of the Kosmos Reserve, if you like “hoppy” beers, you will LOVE this! The bold flavor kicks you in the mouth from the first sip to the last. I’m not a huge fan of strong hop flavored beers, so the Kosmos isn’t my first choice. But I’m definitely “hoppy” I tried it! (lame joke alert)\n\nBack label: “Kosmos Spoetzl knew how to brew great beer. Born in Bavaria, Kosmos’ mastery of German brewing carried him as far as Egypt before he found his way to the small Texas town of Shiner. Our proud brewery still carries his name and commitment to excellence in brewing. This full-flavored, hop-jacked lager is every bit as unique as the man himself and our way of saluting the brewmaster who started it all.”\n\nCheck out this beautiful genius item I just HAD to buy!\n\nOh boy. It makes my Shiner-loving heart happy. For those who might not know, like many Texans, Shiner beer is my absolute favorite. So when I saw this at the store, I did a little happy dance because it means I get to try some more flavors without committing to a whole six pack of one kind. They sell the Family Reunion in six packs too, just FYI, but my hubby definitely wanted in on this action so we opted for the twelve pack.\n\nIn the weeks to come, I’ll be tasting and reviewing each one. So stay tuned! Oh so exciting : )"
