Whisky at its best triggers an emotional response, it is more than a drink. It shares that with landscape. If you strip it back to basics what you need for a new distillery is access to lots of cold, clean water, space for storing the casks, and access to market. You could make whisky anywhere these requirements are met. What makes you choose the place, speaks of the person THE LAKES EXERTS A PULL ON THE SOUL This pull has been the same for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years. Poets, artists, novelists, sculptors, have been drawn here, its fells and waters make people settle down and stay, draw more in. So it was with the Currie family. Paul may have worked in Scotch whisky, but holidays were taken back home in England, in the Lakes. He may have had whisky in his veins, but why not an English distillery in the Lake District? He could tick off all the requirements: water, land, old farm buildings suitable for conversion, potential visitor numbers; but most importantly it felt right. This is a good place to make whisky. It is a good place to be. It changes perspective, gets into your bones. EMBEDDED IN PEOPLE'S LIVES People stay in the Lakes because that ‘truth’ speaks to them, but they have to eat, and support their families. A distillery becomes part of a community, something which is especially important in rural communities where jobs can be hard to find. Its presence ripples out across the region. Working in distillation, maturation, guiding tourists, serving food, delivering goods. It embeds itself in people’s lives. The distillery now employs over 40 local people, and has opened up new career possibilities: distiller, chef, warehouseman. It becomes part of the glue which deepens a sense of place. https://lnkd.in/eH8ESx-u\n\nIt has been a little bit since I last visited with Marcia, and A LOT has been happening in the interim. To say that it has been a crazy, great, busy year for both her and the Ironroot Republic team would be a vast understatement. This dynamo of a human was just awarded the Icons of Whiskey Distillery Manager of the Year award by World of Whiskey. AND, building on a history of award-winning liquids, the Ironroot Republic team and brand have launched and been lauded for their recent creations as well. 2024 World of Whiskey - Ironroot Republic Hubris Straight Corn Whiskey - Gold 2024 World of Whiskey – Ironroot Republic Apotheosis Finished Bourbon – Bronze 2024 World of Whiskey – Ironroot Republic Harbinger Single Barrel Bourbon - Bronze 2023 USA Today 10 Best Craft Whiskey Distilleries - Readers’ Choice Award 2023 World of Whiskey - Icons of Whiskey Master Blender/Master Distiller – Jonathan Likarish - Highly Commended World of Whiskey 2023 - Ironroot Republic Apotheosis - World's Best Finished Bourbon World of Whiskey 2023 - Ironroot Republic Hubris - World's Best American Corn Whiskey Marcia attributes these accomplishments to a strongly held belief that \"we do not achieve life's goals alone\". She encourages team building with people from diverse backgrounds and life experiences. She also advocates for the suspension of personal ego in the pursuit of knowledge. Her favorite quote explains her philosophy and it is hard to argue with her when her family’s operation demonstrates the results achieved with the application of it. “Opinion is really the lowest form of human knowledge. It requires no accountability, no understanding. The highest form of knowledge… is empathy, for it requires us to suspend our egos and live in another’s world. It requires profound purpose larger than the self kind of understanding.” ― Bill Bullard Her words of wisdom for us all? Do not underestimate yourself or your teammates. Much can be achieved with the suspension of ego and the drive to achieve.

We’ve thrown away the jargon and the prestigious/exclusivity aura often associated with whisky and independent bottlers, and instead are using The Heart Cut and our bottlings to educate on both the category and specific distilleries in a welcoming, all-inclusive way. Why? Because we know that there are consumers out there who come without the whisky hangups and stereotypes of yesteryear, and are poised with an open mind and empty glass ready to explore the world, one whisky at a time. And also because it's what excites us! That’s why we’re loving this updated whisky white paper - The New World of New World Whisky - by Distill Ventures. Whether you work in the whisky industry or have a passion for it, it’s a great read that will open your mind up to the breadth and excitement that new world whisky brings. https://lnkd.in/eY8_zWD8 #whisky #whiskey #newworldwhisky\n\nWhisky is more than a spirit, it is a tale told by the distiller that captures centuries of tradition in each golden drop. It embodies culture, heritage and the meticulous artistry of those who have dedicated their lives to sharing expressions of sheer excellence with the world. Throughout whisky’s venerable history, a few select bottles have emerged that surpass mere enjoyment, elevating to become landmarks in a storied tradition, legacies immortalized in glass. The Glenfarclas Pagoda Series is one such monumental creation, weaving together the threads of impeccable craftsmanship, family legacy and unrivaled quality. It is not merely a whisky; it is a tribute to the profound depths of distillation and a celebration of the prolific history of a distillery that has graced the world with exceptional spirits since 1836. Each exquisite bottle showcases the pursuit of excellence that is a cornerstone at Glenfarclas, a manifestation of unparalleled mastery in whisky creation.
