        "text": "This content has been archived. It may no longer be relevant\n\nThat is what the label reads on Shiner Bohemian Black Lager. I had been wanting to try this particular beer for quite awhile but my searches had always come up empty. But on a recent trip to a Total Wine & More store I spotted the elusive creature. Before it could hide behind its brewery mate, Shiner Bock, I corralled the dark prize and trapped it safely in my shopping cart.\n\nBlack Lager, also known as Schwarzbier, has always been one of my favorite beer styles. I blame it on Kostritzer, which has been brewed in Germany for 465 years. Years ago, one of our shopping malls had a Mr. Dunderbaks German deli which always had Kostritzer on draft. Needless to say mall afternoons weren’t too bad after several Kostritzers.\n\nShiner Bohemian Black Lager does not disappoint. It was so good we almost drank all 6 before getting the photo shoot done. I typically do the photo shoot with the first beer from the six pack, but this time I couldn’t wait. Before I new it, we were down to the last bottle for the shot I took above. (Oh the pressure of this blogging thing….)\n\nSome people see the darkness of the beer and expect it to be a heavier beer like a porter or stout. But that is not the case. I find the taste to be more maltier than a regular lager, but without the heaviness of a porter or stout. Just a great everyday beer. If I could find it on a more regular basis the world would be so much better."
