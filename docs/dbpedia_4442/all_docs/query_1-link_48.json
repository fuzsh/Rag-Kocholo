This is a pretty festive looking beer, perfect for a Christmas Advent Calendar!\n\nAroma and Appearance: This pours a dark clear red-brown amber colour with a bit of foam and some small side bubbles. The aroma is all peaches, toffee and raisins.\n\nFlavour: You can taste the peaches and pecans up front quite easily with some boozy cherries and dates in the middle and a rum soaked fruitcake like finish (think liqueur).\n\nOverall Impression: It reminded me of a brandy to be honest, it has a liqueur like booziness to it.\n\nRating: Decent at 6.5/10, I think this would be even better it they backed away from things like caramel colour in the ingredients.\n\nFood Pairing: Would match up nicely with a slice or two of Stollen loaf."
