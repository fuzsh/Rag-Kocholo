We stopped at a 1919 Restaurant and Bar that was an old Pharmacy and Soda shop - still sporting the Medicine trays all along the walls and the soda shop/bar still showcases the early 1900's Corinthian Column Bar and Mirrors imported from Germany. They told us they couldn't sell us any beer but they would give us all of the Shiner Blonde's we wanted. From then on I loved the Blondes~!!!\n\nAttachments\n\nDSC00369.JPG\n\nDSC00367.JPG\n\nDSC00370.JPG\n\nThe brewery is closed on WEEKENDS - yep.\n\nBrewery Tours: (Monday - Friday)\n\n10:00 a.m. (in the summer only)\n\n11:00 a.m.\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\n2:30 p.m. (in the summer only)\n\nSpoetzl Brewery Gift Shop Hours of Operation:\n\nMonday – Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday, from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\n\nNice collection there!\n\nI have that Shiner Population sign.\n\nLocated on the right of my car.\n\nThinking of getting some neon signs too.\n\nThe brewery is closed on WEEKENDS - yep.\n\nBrewery Tours: (Monday - Friday)\n\n10:00 a.m. (in the summer only)\n\n11:00 a.m.\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\n2:30 p.m. (in the summer only)\n\nSpoetzl Brewery Gift Shop Hours of Operation:\n\nMonday – Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday, from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.\n\nNice collection there!\n\nI have that Shiner Population sign.\n\nLocated on the right of my car.\n\nThinking of getting some neon signs too.\n\nHey that's awesome - I may ride out there early one morning (in the cool of the morning...) do the 10am tour - then have Lunch at the Shiner Restaurant and Bar... Sounds like a good ride.\n\nI became a huge fan of shiner bock after living in New Braunfels Tx for a while... I now live in Alaska, and FINALLY found a liquor store that sells shiner bock. It costs me just under $9 for a sixer, but that's the price I gotta pay to enjoy my favorite beer. Only ever had the bock and blonde, didn't realize they made so many different types....\n\nNot really a dark beer fan, but Shiner did used to make a special brew around the Holidays that was kick-ass! I don't recognize it in the lineup, in fact, I did not know they had such a lineup; but now I'm curious. What is the name of their special brew they only do in the fall?\n\nshiner makes a \"Family Reunion\" case with Bock, Blonde, Black lager, Light and Hefweizen. Didn't like the Hefwez but the rest is great. They put out a few commemrative brews for different seasons. Last one I tried was a shiner \"smoke house\" tasted like bock with liquid smoke in it. A bit nasty for my taste.\n\nThe town of shiners about a 45 minute ride for us so we get over their fairly regular. They put on a music festival thats pretty kickass too.\n\nshiner makes a \"Family Reunion\" case with Bock, Blonde, Black lager, Light and Hefweizen. Didn't like the Hefwez but the rest is great.

I'd like to have that \"Family Reunion\" in my Garage!!!\n\nWell here's a little tribute to my Dad and I's first ever stop in Shiner, TX to enjoy a brew together on our first ever 3day run together on the Bikes a few years back.

If there was more father-son time like that in this world, it would be a better place.\n\nEdit: Had to look up Friendswood....for some reason I thought it was in East Texas futher North. I was in the DFW area all last week.....God it was hot and humid.....Houston.....ALWAYS hot and humid....\n\nUSMC......what is more important is that you were spending time with your dad.....and your dad time with you.

Me and my Dad were big enemies when I was growing up - now we're really close and I love it. Every ride I look at him going down the road and know that one day I will no longer have the opportunity and I hope that day is MANY years away!! Thanks for the post!"
