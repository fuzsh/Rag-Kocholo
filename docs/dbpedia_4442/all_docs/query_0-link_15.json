This brewery has quick a remarkable output compared to many of the others features on these pages. We approached the gleaming white walls, American flag waving above the structure, under wide-open Texas skies. Shiner is a pretty small town so the brewery is definitely a big deal here. Interior Photograph: Spoetzl has a tasting room at the end of their tour so you can try out their entire product line. Logically, it's decorated in a German beerhall motif. You can linger here basically as long as you like. We collected all of the promotional material on this page as a result of the tour.

Soon, folks all around Shiner were enjoying Shiner Premium and Shiner Bock beer from his Spoetzl Brewery. And now, in the tradition of Kosmos Spoetzl's brewing excellence, the Spoetzl Brewery brings you Kosmos Reserve Lager. A flavorful beer, Kosmos Reserve Lager is a 100% malt brew with a unique balance of flavors, foam retention, and deep golden color. Its selected hops offer just the right blend of body, flavor, and up-front character. Try Kosmos Reserve Lager for yourself and enjoy.
