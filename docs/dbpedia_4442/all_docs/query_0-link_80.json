Shiner Amber Bock, from the Spoetzl Brewery in the town of Shiner Texas, has been around since 1909 and is the oldest brewery in the Lone Star State. I think of Shiner as an ‘everyday’ beer, much like you would have a go-to wine. Extraordinarily crisp and refreshing, I have never found another beer like it. It’s now available all across the NY area. Try one today!"
