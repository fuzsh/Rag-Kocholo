        "text": "Holy Motors has been ascribed with multiple interpretations. Speculation about the meaning behind the film has emerged since its debut at the Cannes film festival, 2012. These revolve around the baffling storyline and the context technology holds in, not just cinema but, contemporary society. By shifting from genre to genre, Carax purposefully tries to confuse his audience: the French director protects his film from distinct definition with what appears to be a lack of narrative and, instead, creates a highly allegorical and illusory film. This seemingly irrelevant sequence is what makes the film so captivating and has scholars trying to dissect its illusive meaning. The film won twenty-eight awards and gained sixty-seven nominations. Protagonist, and long-time collaborator of the director, Denis Lavant won four awards for ‘Best Actor’. At the Chicago International Film Festival, he won the award ‘for breathing life into a character who is alternately tragic, hilarious, shocking, profound, hideous, beautiful, wise - but always human - and, quite simply, unlike anything we've ever seen before’. The film can be interpreted in many different ways, but these facts cannot be repudiated. So, how did the tarnished director thwart early criticism with this ‘Island of Cinema’? The inquisitive viewer might find Holy Motors leaves them questioning existence and the future of technology as machines are replaced just as much as people. In addition, the art of cinema is enveloped in this illustration of cinematography. Whether it provokes philosophical contemplation or not, the film is an extension of the cinematic universe, according to Carax. In essence, this dissertation seeks to broaden, as well as provide sufficient evidence to support, interpretation.\n\nThis book presents the bold and original proposal to replace the general appellation of ‘world cinema’ with the more substantive concept of ‘realist cinema’. Veering away from the usual focus on modes of reception and spectatorship, it locates instead cinematic realism in the way films are made. The volume is structured across three innovative categories of realist modes of production: ‘non-cinema’, or a cinema that aspires to be life itself; ‘intermedial passages’, or films that incorporate other artforms as a channel to historical and political reality; and ‘total cinema’, or films moved by a totalising impulse, be it towards the total artwork, total history or universalising landscapes. Though mostly devoted to recent productions, each part starts with the analysis of foundational classics, which have paved the way for future realist endeavours, proving that realism is timeless and inherent in cinema from its origin.\n\nOlivier Assayas's 1996 film Irma Vep is a comedy about French filmmaking in an era when first-world conceptions of ‘film auteurs’ and ‘national cinemas’ had long since been destabilized by the complexities of postcolonial nationalisms, television coproductions, and unprecedented global flows of people and capital. The film's comedy pivots on the casting of a Hong Kong star in the lead role in a highly disunified remake of Louis Feuillade's silent serial Les Vampires (1915–1916), which had just been restored and released on video in tandem with the 1995 centenary of French cinema. New-wave director René Vidal (Jean-Pierre Léaud) asks his star Maggie (Maggie Cheung) to keep her performance simple, not to act so much as to be herself, echoing Assayas's own direction that Cheung ‘just play herself’ in his film. This article addresses the implications of the direction to ‘play’ oneself by focusing on a nexus of three overlapping problematic issues: Irma Vep and Musidora as national icon, classical female actors as cinematic archetypes, and Cheung as a transnational star. Rather than placing the onus of bearing meaning (in the sense of national identity as it is mediated by cinema) on woman - whether she is icon, archetype, or star, the article argues that Irma Vep places this onus on the male Français de souche (Franco French) director, and that the film is less about remaking the past than it is about acknowledging the present, specifically the effects of emerging global orders on France and other first-world film industries.\n\nIn November 1968, Jack Valenti, then president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), created the Rating System so that theater owners could indicate to families which films were suitable for children. New and talented young producers such as Bert Schneider took great advantage of the new opportunities this system offered. Orson Welles, still self-exiled in Europe, himself wanted to take advantage of the changed climate in Hollywood. Thanks to the support of his new partner, Oja Kodar, Orson Welles decided that his films would explore sexuality in a more explicit way. Nudity, corporeity, and sex (though already appearing in his previous films) are copiously dealt with in The Other Side of the Wind, whose initial conception and realization was largely due to Oja Kodar. One of the film's most iconic sequences, the \"car sex scene\", features well-known Wellesian techniques as applied to the depiction of dominant female sexuality."
