        "text": "128th-final, round 14: 3F16 vs. 7G09.\n\n3F16: “The Day the Violence Died” (Season 7 / March 17, 1996)\n\nWritten by John Swartzwelder. Directed by Wesley Archer\n\nShowrunners: Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein\n\nvs.\n\n7G09: “The Call of the Simpsons” (Season 1 / February 18, 1990)\n\nWritten by John Swartzwelder. Directed by Wesley Archer\n\nShowrunners: James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Sam Simon\n\nTwo great Swartzwelder/Archer episodes in this round. While there are certainly many differences in the look and feel and even the characters between seasons 1 and 7, the writer and director have undeniably put their stamp on either episode. Swartwelder’s crazy one-liners and out-there references are present in both of these, as is Archer’s lovingly detailed and beautifully drawn animation.\n\n“The Day the Violence Died” has great voice performances from guests Kirk Douglas, Alex Rocco, and Phil Hartman (and singing from Jack Sheldon!), while in “The Call of the Simpsons” we get a wonderful scene with Albert Brooks as the sleazy RV-salesman, who kinda reminded me of Walton Goggins’ character in “The Hateful Eight” this time around.\n\nI always think that Season 1 doesn’t really stand much of a chance in this tournament because it can be so different from what the show would become later, but watching these two back-to-back I have to say that I enjoyed 7G09 a lot more than I would have expected. So, in what might be considered kind of an upset, …\n\n… the winner is: 7G09, “The Call of the Simpsons.”\n\n128th-final, round 12: 7F03 vs. 1F09.\n\n7F03: “Bart Gets an F” (Season 2 / October 11, 1990)\n\nWritten by David M. Stern. Directed by David Silverman\n\nShowrunners: James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Sam Simon\n\nvs.\n\n1F09: “Homer the Vigilante” (Season 5 / January 6, 1994)\n\nWritten by John Swartzwelder. Directed by Jim Reardon\n\nShowrunner: David Mirkin\n\nAnother close one. As many second season episodes do, “Bart Gets an F” starts out as a rather conventional family sitcom plot, but of course even back then The Simpsons couldn’t help but elevate the material. I am again and again impressed by the sophisticated and artful animation of the early seasons, and this one is just full of beautiful shots.\n\n“Homer the Vigilante” is obviously a much more polished product, and I like the episode a lot, but “Bart Gets an F” has a certain charm that, at least for me, puts it ahead in this contest.\n\nThe winner: 7F03, “Bart Gets an F.”\n\n128th-final, round 9: 8F06 vs. 1F04.\n\n8F06: “Lisa’s Pony” (Season 3 / November 7, 1991)\n\nWritten by Al Jean & Mike Reiss. Directed by Carlos Baeza\n\nShowrunners: Al Jean & Mike Reiss\n\nvs.\n\n1F04: “Treehouse of Horror IV” (Season 5 / October 28, 1993)\n\nWritten by Conan O’Brien, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Greg Daniels, Dan McGrath, Bill Canterbury\n\nDirected by David Silverman. Showrunner: David Mirkin\n\n(Every time I come on here and apologize for not posting anything for so long and then vowing to do a better job from now on it only gets worse, so I’m not even gonna do that today.)\n\nWhenever a Halloween special comes up on the tournament I go in thinking, well, even if it’s good I’m not gonna pick it over a decent regular episode, right?\n\nRight. But this was a close one. “Treehouse of Horror IV” really is that good, and if I’m ever to rank the Treehouses o. H. I’m sure it will be near the very top. But I’m not doing that today.\n\nThe winner: “Lisa’s Pony,” of course.\n\n128th-final, round 8: 2F12 vs. 2F04.\n\n2F12: “Homie the Clown” (Season 6 / February 12, 1995)\n\nWritten by John Swartzwelder. Directed by David Silverman\n\nShowrunner: David Mirkin\n\nvs.\n\n2F04: “Bart’s Girlfriend” (Season 6 / November 6, 1994)\n\nWritten by John Collier. Directed by Susie Dietter\n\nShowrunner: David Mirkin\n\nI watched these two back to back on the projector the other day. Usually I watch ’em on my computer but a friend was over for a movie and afterwards we put in the good old Simpsons DVDs. So my main observation for both of these season 6 episodes is how great they look on the big screen. I know I say this every week but back in its prime the show was so cinematic! You’ve got low angles and elaborate action scenes and dramatic close-ups and all that kind of stuff. Sitcoms are usually not the most sophisticated, visually speaking. They all look kinda… flat. These don’t.\n\nI laughed way more during “Homie the Clown” than the other one. I think under David Mirkin they had figured out the sweet spot between Homer being a lovable goof you want to root for and him causing trouble and injury to those around him and himself, not through malice but kinda just by being there. There’s a moment here where he beats up the guy in the Hamburglar costume half to death that I wish they had toned down a bit, or even taken out completely. I get why it’s funny and maybe it’s so out there with its violence that it becomes okay again? I don’t know.\n\n(I’m extra rambly today for reasons. Sorry if none of this is coherent.)\n\n2F12 is like a mini masterclass in comedic timing, too. Three fantastic moments rely entirely on pauses: when Homer falls into the burger props outside the Krusty Burger, when he is ejected out of his car after crashing it in front of the Van Houten place, and when Flanders repeatedly gets shot. They all involve silences or a few seconds of nothing happening, and they’re made exponentially funnier because of that.\n\n“Bart’s Girlfriend” is a very different kind of episode. It doesn’t rely on the loud, funny moments as much, but instead focuses on what Bart’s going through, giving his story enough room to resonate with us and feel more true to life. (I guess “falling in love with a troublemaker and having your heart broken” IS more relatable than “enrolling in clown college and getting kidnapped by the mafia”?)\n\nYou know what? Up until a minute ago I was gonna let 2F04 win this one but now that I’ve written all this and looked through the episodes again I’m going with “Homie the Clown.” They’re pretty much equally great and last night I would have picked “Bart’s Girlfriend.” But this isn’t last night. Sorry, Meryl Streep. You were great, though.\n\nThe winner: 2F12, “Homie the Clown.”\n\n128th-final, round 7: 8F08 vs. 4F13.\n\n8F08: “Flaming Moe’s” (Season 3 / November 21, 1991)\n\nWritten by Robert Cohen. Directed by Rich Moore, Alan Smart\n\nShowrunners: Al Jean & Mike Reiss\n\nvs.\n\n4F13: “My Sister, My Sitter” (Season 8 / March 2, 1997)\n\nWritten by Dan Greaney. Directed by Jim Reardon\n\nShowrunners: Bill Oakley & Josh Weinstein\n\nThe winner: 8F08: “Flaming Moe’s.”\n\nI like “My Sister, My Sitter” a lot, and especially Lisa’s story. Her struggle to prove herself a responsible and reliable babysitter feels very true to her character, and Bart makes the perfect foe. Homer and Marge’s visit to the Springfield waterfront promenade offers some fun sight gags, but this really is Lisa’s episode to carry, and she does it well. The way the episode wraps up is a tiny bit clunky, but that can be said of “Flaming Moe’s” as well, I suppose.\n\nIt’s easy to overlook (or even embrace) the lack of a perfect resolution in “Flaming Moe’s,” because everything leading up to it is just so masterfully constructed. I love that you really don’t need to know anything about the characters and their relationships going in – the episode flawlessly sets up Homer and Moe’s friendship and then rivalry. And of course the acting and animation is on a level that is so much higher than anything else on television then. Or now."
