        "text": "Radioactive Man was part of the fall lineup of the 1995-1996 US TV schedule. It first aired September 24, 1995 at 8pm on Fox following “Space: Above and Beyond” and was followed by “Too Something”, both of which remain top notch examples of quality television, well worth clearing your Sunday nights to watch on the family TV. Radioactive Man was seen by over 15 million people when it first aired according to Nielsen ratings."
