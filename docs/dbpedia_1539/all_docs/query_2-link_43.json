        "text": "Original airdate: May 11, 1999\n\nWritten by Lewis Morton; Directed by Susie Dietter\n\nThe first season’s Emmy nominee,* “A Big Piece of Garbage” is another iconic piece of Futurama. It’s packed sky-high with countless moments that, years on, still made me laugh out loud so much I had to pause the DVD and take on some more oxygen before continuing. This episode has always had a special place in my heart and brain as the first real Farnsworth-centric. The Professor is without doubt my favourite character and watching the first seven episodes back, his insane diatribes have provided me with my heaviest laughs. But Farnsworth isn’t just a one-note character. He’s an angry, incredibly old, senile and at least partially mad scientist. But with that, he has a deep desire for at least some form of credit and respect, and after his many decades this desire is all the more greater. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, Futurama – despite being set 1000 years in the future with a cast including a hideous lobster doctor, a robot criminal and a Jamaican bureaucrat – is one of the best character-based sitcoms I’ve ever seen. The writing, and the heart, is always so smart and so accurate. And this from an episode about a big piece of garbage.\n\nSo what of the garbage ball? And what of the Professor? Well the latter is where we start. It’s time for the annual Academy of Inventors symposium and the Professor is sure he’ll win this time, with his fantastic new invention, the death clock, a machine which tells you exactly when you’re going to die. But unfortunately, the Professor already invented that for the previous year’s ceremony – and it didn’t go down well with Academy’s ‘younger’ members, chief among them, his long-term rival and former student Ogden Wernstrom. The Professor’s hastily sketched new invention – the Smelloscope, which can smell distant odours – similarly bombs. To prove he’s not a failure, the Professor decides to build the Smelloscope – although he soon realizes that he already built one last year.\n\nWith the character of the Professor now better set up, we move into the main plot, which is fantastic in every aspect. To solve their garbage problem, the residents of Old New York fired their excess waste off Earth on a rocket. Through the Smelloscope, the Professor discovers that the garbage ball is heading back to Earth, and will smush New New York into a stinky crater. He proposes destroying the ball by dropping a bomb into its core. Luckily, he has a crew moronically suicidal enough for the job… (“Ah crap”) But the crew bail on planting the bomb, because the Professor put the timer on upside down, giving them just 52 seconds to avoid death. All looks lost, but the Professor and Fry realize that another equal-sized ball of garbage will be enough to knock the incoming one into the sun, without raining garbage over the Earth.\n\nIn New New York, garbage no longer exists as everything is recycled. Thus, it’s up to Fry to show everyone how to produce enough. (“This picture of your wife? Pure garbage.”) Soon enough New York is back to its old self, tossing literally everything out the window and into the streets. A sufficient ball of garbage is amassed, the plan succeeds, the Earth is saved and the Professor truly does get the respect he has yearned for. While the attempted garbage ball-bombing is a parody of Armageddon, the episode as a whole serves to parody the tropes of the environmental disaster genre in general, in typical Futurama fashion. The danger is entirely man-made, but rather than dwelling on any actual environmental message, the episode turns it on its head, using the problem as a short-term solution, and nuts to the consequences. It’s funny, it’s absurd, it’s a real Futurama classic.\n\n*It lost to the King of the Hill episode “And They Call it Bobby Love”, which I haven’t seen, but I can guess from the title that Bobby falls in love. I assume the staff were going for a non-alien but sufficiently spacey episode for the nomination, but given the dinosaur ways of the Emmy voters, the more trad-sitcomy “I, Roommate” may have fared better. This is totally undermined by the ones which eventually did win the Emmy, but the Emmys have never made sense.\n\nTrivia and Quotes"
