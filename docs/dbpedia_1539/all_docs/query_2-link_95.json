        "text": "Bart Gets Famous was part of the winter lineup of the 1993-1994 US TV schedule. It first aired February 3, 1994 at 8pm on Fox following “local/syndicated programming” and was followed by “The Sinbad Show”, both of which remain top notch examples of quality television, well worth clearing your Thursday nights to watch on the family TV. Bart Gets Famous was seen by over 20 million people when it first aired according to Nielsen ratings."
