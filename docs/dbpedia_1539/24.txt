I'll go as far as to compare it to great animated comedies like Family Guy and South Park(I absolutely love both of them). Brickleberry really knows how to push the boundaries.

Each episode centers around the hilarious misadventures and mishaps of Five distinctly funny Rangers in the fictional Brickleberry National Park . There is also a rude talking little bear immediately comparable to Stewie and Cartman.

It's a brilliantly written show with hilarious characters, dialogues and situations. It can be extremely politically incorrect with its out of the world jokes and situations, which is why some people may Hate it with passion. But you have to understand that's what makes the show Great . Without developing a certain taste you can not appreciate the hilarity of Brickleberry.

I hope this show continues on for long. I highly recommend it to everyone.

Brickleberry gets a perfectly deserved 10/10 from me.
