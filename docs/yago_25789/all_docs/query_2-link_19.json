        "text": "The curly hair did not meet the standards for the breed, but the judges did not want to offend the king so they wrote the Latin word for king, Rex, beside the rabbits' names.\n\nThe Cornish Rex is an intriguing breed, and it's one that you may want to investigate a little more if you're looking for a new feline companion.\n\nSometimes getting a solid chuck that resembles a broken sunflower seed that stank worse than Rex the dog's breath on a hot and humid day in Maywood, Illinois in the month of July.\n\nThe special effects in King Kong were second to none and now you can relive the epic battle between Kong and the T-Rex (Tyrannosaurus Rex) on your computer with KingKong Online.\n\nOver that time some of the original toys have been sold in yard sales, but Woody, Buzz Lightyear, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Jessie and Bullseye, Rex, Slinky, the Army Men, Hamm and the aliens are still together.\n\nThrough a harrowing sequence of events, Rex eventually left Salem for good on July 26, 2005, after he discovered that his girlfriend Mimi Lockhart aborted their baby without informing him of it.\n\nGeorge Williams (the pharmacist) was in love with Bree and he wanted to get rid of Rex so she would be free for him.\n\nRex struggled with this revelation as he'd grown to despise Roman Brady and did not want to be related to him in any way.\n\nShe was also with Victor for a time before marrying Stefano, and is the mother of Austin, Billie, Lucas, Philip, Rex, and Cassie, and the grandmother of many.\n\nThe familiar charge, repeated in Shakespeare, of having written Ego et meus rex, while true in fact, is false in intention, because no Latin scholar could put the words in any other order; but it reflects faithfully enough Wolsey's mental attitude.\n\nHe then got himself crowned by St Boniface, a ceremony which was new to France and which gave the sovereign immense prestige; henceforth the king of the Franks called himself Gratia Dei rex Francorum.\n\nThe broad lower end of the symbol is rather an accidental pit in the stone than an attempt at a diacritic mark - the word is regei, in all probability the early dative form of rex, \" king.\"\n\nThe most highly coveted office at this time was not that of BaotXEbs, which, like that of the rex sacrorum in Rome, had been stripped of all save its religious authority, but that of the Archon; soon after the legislation of Solon repeated struggles for this office between the Eupatridae and leading members of the other two classes resulted in a temporary change.\n\nThis writer states that when at the papal court in 1145 he met with the bishop of Gabala (Jibal in Syria), who related how \"not many years before one John, king and priest (rex et sacerdos), who dwelt in the extreme Orient beyond Persia and Armenia, and was, with his people, a Christian but a Nestorian, had made war against the brother kings of the Persians and Medes, who were called Samiards (or Sanjards), and captured Ecbatana their capital.\n\nHe permitted free study of the Aristotelian writings, and issued (1234), through his chaplain, Raymond of Pennaforte, an important new compilation of decretals which he prescribed in the bull Rex pacificus should be the standard text-book in canon law at the universities of Bologna and Paris.\n\nThe king, in fact, both in Greece and in Rome, was the acting head of the state religion, and when the regal power came to an end his sacred functions were not transferred to the ordinary priests, but either they were distributed among high officers of state, as archons and prytanes, or the title of \" king \" was still preserved as that of a religious functionary, as in the case of the rex sacrorum at Rome and the archon basileus at Athens.\n\nSpecial interest attaches to this trace of their earlier origin, because of the famous cult of Diana Nemorensis, whose temple in the forest close by Aricia, beside the laces Nemorensis, was served by \"the priest who slew the slayer, and shall himself be slain\"; that is to say, the priest, who was called rex Nemorensis, held office only so long as he could defend himself from any stronger rival.\n\nThe rounded form ofy is found with the value of G in R EC E I, which is probably the dative of rex.\n\nHe aimed a further blow at Fustel's system by showing that the Frankish kings had never borne the Roman title of vir inluster, and that they could not therefore be considered as being in the first place Roman magistrates;

and when, after the overthrow of the Lombard kingdom by the Franks, Arichis II.\n\nThe work was finished in 1234, and was at once sent by the pope to Bologna with the bull Rex pacificus, declaring it to be official.\n\nDuring the next few years they maintained their hold on Mercia, and we have at this time coins minted in London with the inscription \"Alfdene rex,\" the name of the Danish leader.\n\nThe term Rig (reeh = rex, king) was applied to four classes or grades of rulers, the lower grades being grouped, each group being subject to one of their number, and all being subject to, and owing tribute and allegiance to the Ard-Rig (= supreme king of Erinn).\n\nOff a had to win back by long wars what his kinsman had lost; he became so powerful that we find the pope calling him Rex Anglorum, as if he were the only king in the island.\n\nBut its overlordship he never lost, and since he also maintained the supremacy which his father had won over the Welsh and Scots, it was not without reason that he called himself on his coins and in his charters Rex totius Britanniae.\n\nHis successor Ladislaus of Poland (1490 - I 516) added Slavonia to the kingdoms named in the royal title, which now included the words \"King of Dalmatia and Croatia and Slavonia\" (Rex Dalmatiae et Croatiae et Slavoniae).\n\nThe college existed under the monarchy, when its members were probably three in number; they may safely be considered as legal advisers of the rex in all matters of religion.\n\nUnder the republic they emerge into prominence under a pontifex maximus, who took over the king's duties as chief administrator of religious law, just as his chief sacrificial duties were taken by the rex sacrorum; his dwelling was the regia, \" the house of the king.\"\n\nIn the same way the adoration of living human beings, the deification of living kings - whose title survives in our king or queen of the May, and in the rex nemorensis, the priest of Diana in the grove of Aricia - has been most fruitful in myths of divine beings.\n\nAlbertus Magnus was the first to state that arsenic contained a metal-like substance, although later writers considered it to be a bastard or semi-metal, and frequently called it arsenicum rex.\n\nThe REX format allows independent control of tempo and pitch, as well as complete reorganization of the music phrases in Dr. Rex.\n\nThe discovery, unveiled in the journal Nature, might reveal how early tyrannosaurs evolved into the T rex 100 million years later.\n\nAt once the malcontents presented their demands in a document known popularly as the Articles of the Barons, more strictly as Capitula quae barones petunt et dominus rex concedit.\n\nThe Vesta of the state is in fact the king's hearth, standing in close proximity to the Regia, the king's palace; the Vestal Virgins, who have charge of the sacred fire, are the \"king's daughters,\" and as such even in republican times were in the manus of the pontifex maximus, who was the successor of the king on the legal side of his religious duties, as the rex sacrorum was on the sacrificial side.\n\nThese were the inauguration of the rex sacrorum and the flamens, and that abjuration of hereditary worship (detestatio sacrorum) which was made by a man who passed from his clan (gens) either by an act of adrogation (see Roman Law and Adoption) or by transition from the patrician to the plebeian order.\n\nAmong the other noticeable plants may be mentioned Betula (3 species), Alnus (2 species), Carpinus, Fagus (4 species), Salix (4 species), Populus (2 species), Platanus, Liquidambar, Planera, Ulmus (2 species), Ficus (2 species), Persoonia, Laurus (5 species), Persea, Sassafras, Cinnamomum (5 species), Oreodaphne, Diospyros (2 species), Andromeda, Magnolia, Acer (3 species), Sapindus, Celastrus (2 species), Rex (4 species), Rhamnus (3 species), Juglans (5 species), Carya (2 species), Rhus, Myrtus, Crataegus, Prunus, Cassia (3 species).\n\nI hope this T. rex specimen will enthrall, educate and entertain our visitors and students for generations to come.\n\nRex's associates indulge in a second spate of unintelligent comments on the current political situation, two years after we first heard them.\n\nThe Devon Rex, the Cornish Rex and the LaPerm Rex have fewer coat hairs, providing less area for the Fel D 1 proteins to become trapped."
