        "text": "ABC Daytime hit pay dirt when it hired John-Paul Lavoisier to play ONE LIFE TO LIVE’s Rex Balsom. Not only is he a fine young actor who fits the requisite cute/hunky profile, he’s so personable and fun that he is often sent out to do various fan/charity events. Fans love him. The press loves him. Being a stickler for the truth, I had to ask him:\n\nSoap Opera Weekly: Are you always so chipper?\n\nJohn-Paul Lavoisier: I’m a relatively positive person. I don’t pick fights with anyone. It’s really really hard to get me bent out of shape, because I sort of take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nWeekly: That’s really nice.\n\nLavoisier: I have a great job. I’m surrounded by nice people. I don’t let things really get to me. I don’t have a very stressful life. I try to keep the stress off my heart. I care about things — it’s not like I don’t care — but I don’t let things get me really angry, because it’s just not worth it. I’m happy to be alive. Listen, I’m very lucky. Bottom line: There are 6 billion people on this planet; the world does not owe me anything, including life. I’m just happy to wake up every day and do something.\n\nWeekly: You must be happy that the weather is turning nice for golf. (Note: On the actual day of this conversation, it was pouring rain.)\n\nLavoisier: Are you joking?\n\nWeekly: I am serious. I’m not talking about today. Spring is coming, and that is perfect golf weather.\n\nLavoisier: Yeah, when I played a few weeks ago in Florida, I hit the ball pretty well. Which is surprising, because I haven’t really played since Thanksgiving and Christmas, when I went home to Pennsylvania. I can’t really count that because I didn’t play very well. The conditions were terrible. It was wet, and it was cold and gross. I cannot wait [to play again]. I didn’t even look at my clubs until I got to the golf course, and they were caked with mud because I hadn’t cleaned them. I was like, “You guys don’t deserve this.” This is terrible.\n\nWeekly: Does one get golf clubs professionally cleaned, or is it pretty much wipe what you can yourself?\n\nLavoisier: I like cleaning them, and I like getting them dirty. I take them all and put them in my sink. I let the water run, I take a brush and I scrub them all. Then I take a golf tee and get in the grooves of all the heads of the clubs. Then I dry them. I enjoy cleaning them.\n\nWeekly: Happy golfing!\n\nWhat else is there to say about a guy who loves life and loves cleaning his golf clubs?"
