        "text": "Phillip is coming back to Salem, but with a new face… which is actually an old face! John-Paul Lavoisier is returning to DAYS OF OUR LIVES as Philip Kiriakis!\n\nLast seen in December 2021, Philip will be back this August, played again by Lavoisier, according to Soap Opera Digest. He previously played the role from 2015-2016 and is well known to ABC soap fans for portraying Rex Balsom on sudser ONE LIFE TO LIVE from 1999-2012.\n\nAfter a series of child actors, the character of Philip was aged in October 1999 and played by Brandon Tyler. Jay Kenneth Johnson took over in December 1999, remaining until December 2002. In May 2003, the role was recast again with Kyle Brandt, who exited in October 2006. Johnson stepped back into the role from 2007-2011, and Lavoisier took over in 2015, last airing in December 2016.\n\nWhen Philip returned for the DAYS streaming spinoff LAST BLAST REUNION in 2019, the role was once again played by Johnson, who then rejoined the cast of DAYS proper in August 2020. He was last seen in December 2021, when the character disappeared.\n\nPhilip’s rivalry with Brady over Chloe escalated to the point where he framed his rival for his “murder” and skipped town with the help of his mother, Kate. A lot has changed while he’s been away — Chloe is now with Xander — so he’ll have him to contend with as well as Brady… and that’s after he wriggles out of the trouble of having faked his own death!\n\nStay tuned to see what twists and turns lay ahead!"
