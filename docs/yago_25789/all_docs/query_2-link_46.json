Soon he had a love interest in the TV talk show host Pat Ashley. In 1983 he had a new love, Delila Ralston, but they stopped the relationship from going any further because on Bo's mother's deathbed, she said Yancy Ralston was Bo's father not Asa. That would make Delila and Bo cousins. When Asa found out Bo and Delila weren't together any more, Asa married Delila. Bo then started sleping with Becky Lee Abbott, who became pregnant with their son Drew. They split up, and then Delila and Bo found out they weren't related and they got married. Later in 1984, they got divorced.\n\nWanting to get away from his family for a while, Bo went to work at the Lord-Manning factory using the fake name of Bill Brady. He lived with the O'Neill family and fell in love with one of the daughters, Didi O'Neill. Didi was injured by an explosion at the factory and went blind. She and Bo got married in 1985. Later in 1985, Bo took off for Vietnam in search of MIA's.\n\nThree years later in 1988, while Bo and Didi were in England being held hostage, Patrick London transformed himself by cosmetic surgery and pretended to be Bo in Llanview. During the hostage situation, Didi was electrocuted and died in Bo's arms. In 1990, Bo fell in love with and married Sarah Gordon. But soon after the wedding, Sarah was kidnapped by Carlo Hesser, and she was presumed dead in a plane crash. Later in 1991 he married Cassie Callison, but he still couldn't forget his feelings for Sarah. After their wedding, Sarah returned from the dead surprisingly. Out of obligation, Bo stayed with Cassie, but before long, he and Sarah reunited. Cassie and Bo annulled their marriage.\n\nIn 1992 Sarah was killed by a hit-and-run accident on the day that she was supposed to re-marry Bo. After her death, Bo tried to commit suicide, but was talked out of it by Sloan Carpenter and a new attorney in town, Nora Hanen Gannon, helped Bo to get over his loss. They got engaged in 1993, but they couldn't get married yet, because Nora had a had a brain tumor and needed surgery. After they surgery, Nora went temporarily blind, and was stalked at her beach house by her client, and convicted rapist Todd Manning. Bo rescued Nora and they went back to Llanview together where she was operated on again, and her eyesight was restored. Finally in 1995 Bo and Nora married.\n\nLater Bo's son, Drew Buchanan, arrived in Llanview. Drew soon became a cop just like his father. He was on an investigation and got in the way when Barbara Graham was trying to shoot Kevin Buchanan and was shot. He died, and Bo was devastated.\n\nIn 1998, Nora and Bo were trying to have a baby. Lindsay Rappaport changed the test results so that they said that Bo couldn't have children, because she wanted him for herself. After Nora found out that Bo was not able to have children she asked Sam Rappaport to have with her a baby with her, and then they would say it was Bo's. Nora soon told Bo that the baby was not Bo's, it was Sam's. Then Bo and Nora separated. Later in 1999 Nora had the child, and she and Sam named him Matthew. Later, Nora found out that Bo really could have children. In the meanwhile, Bo and Lindsay had gotten very friendly. Then she thought that the baby might really be Bo's so they had a test to see who the father was. Lindsay paid the lab technician, Jeff Barnes, $500,000.00 to change the test results. He ran away somewhere, so she didn't know if he changed the results or not. When they got the results it said Sam was the father, but it might have been changed, so we didn't know. After that Nora and Bo got a divorce, and Bo and Lindsay got together.\n\nBo's niece Jessica Buchanan was pregnant and got hit by a car in a hit-in-run accident by Dorian Lord Hayes. She lost her baby Megan. Bo investigated the accident and started finding different evidence that would lead to his girlfriend, Lindsay. At her birthday party he arrested her, even though he didn't believe she was guilty. Eventually, Dorian came forward and confessed that she was the one who had hit Jessica and Lindsay was released.\n\nLindsay confessed to Bo that she tried to have Matthew's DNA test altered, but changed her mind at the last minute. Bo forgave her, but what she didn't tell Bo at the time was that she didn't know whether Barnes changed the results or not. Bo also didn't know that Lindsay was the one who originally changed his sperm test results, making Nora think that Bo is sterile. When Lindsay and Bo were dating, Bo was often frustrated with Lindsay's inability to let go of the past and to stop worrying about Nora. Bo insisted that's he's over Nora and ready to get on with his life. Bo asked Lindsay to marry him and she accepted. Around the same time, Lindsay also found out that she was pregnant with Bo's child.\n\nOn his wedding day to Lindsay, Nora interrupted it when she announced in front of the whole church that Lindsay was the one who changed Bo's fertility tests, and Bo walked out on Lindsay. When Will Rappaport was set up and arrested, Bo investigated his father setting him up, and when Asa admitted nothing, Bo no longer considered him to be his father. Not too long after the interrupted wedding, Bo ended up assaulting R.J. at Rodi's and took off to Cherryvale where he met Melanie, and later that night ended up sleeping with her. When Bo came back to town, R.J. had brought assault charges against him and he was suspended from being police commissioner. Bo agreed to let Nora defend him.\n\nOn the train taking Will to Statesville, Nora asked Bo to forgive her, but he didn't. When the train crashed, Nora told Bo the truth about Lindsay's pregnancy and asked him to forgive Lindsay. Bo was devastated when the train exploded and he couldn't get Nora out.\n\nAfter the train wreck, R.J. dropped the assault charges against Bo. When Lindsay told Bo the truth that Matthew could be his Bo took it very well and did not push a new DNA test right away. Eventually the test was done, however, and Matthew turned out to be Sam's son. Bo helped Nora when she returned to town after being presumed dead and had lost her memory. Bo gently broke the news to her that they are divorced and they have decided to be good friends. Bo asked Melanie to marry him. She refused at first because she is hiding a secret from Bo, that she helped her terminally ill father to die, but she finally did agree to marry him.\n\nThen Colin MacIver, Melanie's ex-husband died, and Melanie was one of the suspects in his murder. When a hair sample taken from Colin's fingernails matched Melanie's hair, Bo was forced to take Melanie into custody. She admitted to hitting Colin with a poker the night he died and also revealed the secret she'd been keeping, that she'd killed her father. Melanie broke off her engagement to Bo, but Bo wasn't convinced that she was the one who actually killed Colin. Later it was revealed Nora had actually killed him.\n\nBo and Lanie got back together, but Bo took his time in wedding preparations. Melanie was impatient, and bought a wedding present she pretended was from \"Aunt Louise\" to prod him into marrying her. Bo found out and was upset about her lying, and Melanie schemed to get him back by faking she had leukemia. Bo fell for it, and sent a sample of Melanie's blood to be tested. Just as they were about to have the ceremony, Bo found out Melanie wasn't sick, and it was over between them. Melanie left Llanview.\n\nBo was upset about this, and to make matters worse, his father Asa decided to fake his own death to frame Max Holden and Gabrielle Medina for murder. Bo went on a wild goose chase, trying to incarcerate Max and Gabrielle, only to discover Asa was alive after all. He is currently trying to reconcile with his father, and somewhat reluctantly housing Gabrielle, since she has nowhere to live and also because Bo wanted to keep an eye on her. One evening, Gabby overheard Todd Manning talking to David Vickers on the docks about giving away Blair's real baby and then bringing it back as an adopted child. Gabby used this to her advantage and blackmailed Todd into giving her a job as style editor at the Sun. Gabrielle tried to use her salary to help pay off Al's hospital bills (he was accidentally pushed off a cliff by Cristian Vega). Asa attempted to manipulate Gabrielle into taking a payoff, but Gabrielle alerted Bo and they busted Asa. Bo made Gabrielle calmer and more loved, while Gabrielle made Bo feel young and excited. They became lovers.\n\nSeveral months later, Gabrielle found a letter from Sam Rappaport which revealed that Bo was the father of his ex-wife Nora's young son, Matthew. Gabrielle kept quiet for a few weeks, even stealing another copy of the letter from Nora's house, but finally came clean. Bo forgave her, and they were truly happy until fall 2003, when Al came down with a serious infection. Gabrielle donated a kidney, but nothing could save him. Destroyed, she began drinking and no longer felt worthy of love. Gabrielle was finally starting to enjoy life again as the New Year dawned. She accepted Bo's marriage proposal and put Al's death behind her. Unfortunately, at a party to ring in 2004, Gabrielle was left alone for a few moments. The Music Box Killer snuck up on her. Before she could react, he snapped her neck. Bo found her and held her lifeless body in his arms\n\nBo turned to Nora to help get over his grief over Gabrielle, and the two were devastated when Troy MacIver, the main suspect in the Music Box killings, kidnapped Matthew. They finally managed to get him back (and clear Troy of the murders), but although the two were getting closer romantically, Bo had never been able to forgive Nora for cheating on him with Sam. The two finally broke things off and began moving on with their lives; Bo with Paige Miller, a new doctor in town, and Nora with Daniel Colson, the local district attorney. On the anniversary of Gabrielle's death, Bo prepared to move on in his life with Paige. At the same time, Bo was enmired in the 'Who killed Paul Cramer?' mystery, one of the few who did not believe in Jen Rappaport's guilt. After reluctantly accepting Rex's help, he began to investigate 'Ted', a mysterious man that Paul had been blackmailing. When Jen was found dead, Bo soon agreed with Rex that it was a suicide, and he and Rex soon realized Daniel Colson was the murderer.\n\nBo's ultimate arrest of Daniel as he was about to be sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor caused a rift between Bo and Nora. He got closer to Paige, who moved into the apartment with him and Matthew, but was upset to learn that Paige had formerly been married to Dr. Spencer Truman and had never told him. When Nora ended up in a coma after a brain aneurysm, it was Paige who helped Matthew and Bo deal with the pain. The two became engaged to be married, and even learning of Paige's long ago son with Spencer that she had given up for adoption didn't sway Bo. Unfortunately, their relationship could not survive her final secret -- that she had been the doctor in the operating room the night that Thomas McBain died, and she had been drunk.\n\nPaige redeemed herself a little in Bo's eyes when she tried frantically to stop Todd Manning's execution, knowing he was innocent. She was badly injured in a car accident, and her brush with death was all it took for Bo to realize that he wasn't ready to let her go, and the two began tentatively rebuilding their relationship."
