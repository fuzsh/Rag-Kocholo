        "text": "Grammy-winning band Maroon 5's frontman Adam Noah Levine was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of Patsy (Noah), an admissions counselor, and Fredric Levine, who founded the retail chain M. Fredric. Adam's father's family is Jewish, while Adam's mother is of half Jewish (her own father) and half German and Scottish (her own mother) ancestry. His uncle, Timothy Noah, is a journalist. Adam began playing music with his junior-high friends guitarist, rather than the keyboardist (for which he is known in the band Maroon 5) Jesse Carmichael and bassist Mickey Madden. Their first gig was at a school dance and Levine was terribly shy so he played with his back to the audience. Ryan Dusick joined the band as drummer and the alternative rock band Kara's Flowers were born (1994). They released an album called \"The Fourth World\" (1997). Then, he headed to New York City with Carmichael to study music at Five Towns College on Long Island. While they were there, he was surrounded by new music scenes and influences which give him whole new perspective on songwriting and singing. He dropped out of school after a semester and headed back to California with Carmichael to reunite with their pals and develop their band. He began writing a bunch of songs that were inspired by his recently failed relationship. After adding in new guitarist James Valentine (moving Carmichael over to keyboards) Maroon 5 was officially born. The band released their debut album \"Songs About Jane\", which included international hits \"This Love\", \"Sunday Morning\" and \"She Will Be Loved\" (2002).\n\nStunning pop culture icon, Hollywood leading lady and three-time NAACP award winner Nia Long returns to the big screen this fall in the highly anticipated Universal Pictures sequel The Best Man Holiday (in theaters November 15th) where she reunites with original castmates Taye Diggs (\"Private Practice\"), Terrence Howard (Hustle & flow), Morris Chestnut (The brothers) and Harold Perrineau (\"Lost\"). Additionally in Spring 2014, Long will star in Tyler Perry's Single mom's club alongside Wendi McLendon- Covey (Bridesmaids), Tyler Perry (Madea) and Amy Smart (Crank).\n\nEarly this year, Long joined the all-star cast of Showtime's \"House of Lies\" alongside Golden Globe Award winner Don Cheadle & Kristen Bell as \"Tamara,\" a business school classmate and former flame of Marty's (Don Cheadle) who has been hired by the same consulting firm Galweather Stearn after taking time off to raise a family.\n\nLong made her film debut in the poignant film portraying the social problems in inner-city Los Angeles, Boyz n the hood , and continued on to star in Friday, alongside Ice Cube and Chris Tucker, as well as Love Jones, which won the prestigious Audience Award at Sundance. Other notable film roles include Soul Food, Alfie opposite Jude Law, The Best man, Are We There Yet?, Big Momma's House 1 & 2 opposite Martin Lawrence, Stigmata, the Broken Hearts Club and Made in America.\n\nOn the small screen, Long's portrayal of \"Officer Sasha Monroe\" on NBC's hit crime drama \"Third Watch\" awarded her two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Actress in a Drama series. Long's other TV accomplishments include \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" \"Boston Legal,\" \"Judging Amy,\" and \"Big Shots.\" Long also voiced \"Roberta\" in the first season of the Fox hit \"the Cleveland Show.\"\n\nMaking her directorial debut on Ashanti's music video \"Baby\" and Yolanda Adam's \"This Too Shall Pass,\" Nia continues her work behind the camera and is developing a feature film that centers on renowned world champion boxer and trainer Ann Wolfe.\n\nIn addition to her film and TV work, Long's passion lies in serving her community. With her family roots planted in Trinidad, Grenada, and Barbados, Long's long term goals are to connect women in the US to those of the islands and to mentor young girls to regain their self-esteem. Additionally, Long lends her support to Black Girls Rock, an organization that promotes the arts for young women of color and encourages dialogue on the ways women of color are portrayed in the media. In 2012 she was named an official surrogate to the Barack Obama reelection campaign.\n\nNia was born in Brooklyn, to Talita (Gillman), a teacher and printmaker, and Doughtry Long, a high school teacher and poet. She now calls Los Angeles home where she lives with her 12 year old son, Massai, 14 month old son, Kez and partner Ime Udoka, an Assistant Coach for the San Antonio Spurs. Long loves to cook organic farmers market fresh meals adding a twist of her Trinidadian heritage. When she's not juggling between her career and motherhood, she enjoys staying active by doing pilates, boxing, hiking, and horseback riding. Long also finds pleasure in traveling and experiencing different cultures throughout the world. One of her favorite locations to visit is Jamaica, a place she calls her second home where she can reflect and refuel.\n\nA likable, boyish-looking actor with thick eyebrows and a friendly smile, Justin Long is a native of Connecticut.\n\nHe was born and raised in Fairfield, the second of three sons. His father, R. James Long, is a Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, and his mother, Wendy Lesniak, is a former Broadway actress. He is of German, Sicilian, and Polish descent. He attended Fairfield Prep, and after graduating, he attended Vassar College. He first really showed his promise as a member of the comedy troupe \"LaughingStock.\" His performing talent garnered favorable notices and he won roles in some independent productions, notably Galaxy Quest - Planlos durchs Weltall (1999). However, he refused to act full time until after he graduated, which he did in 2000. He first gained notice when he played the nervous teenager Warren Cheswick in the TV series Ed - Der Bowling-Anwalt (2000). The following year, he starred in the offbeat horror film Jeepers Creepers - Es ist angerichtet (2001). The film, with its ghoulish ending, was a major hit on the horror circuit and raised his profile.\n\nHe played the boyfriend of Britney Spears in Not a Girl (2002), and won a supporting role in the Vince Vaughn comedy Voll auf die Nüsse (2004). He had high-profile roles in some offbeat independent films, most notably Raising Genius (2004) and Abserviert (2005), and scored commercial success again when he played Lindsay Lohan's boyfriend in Herbie Fully Loaded - Ein toller Käfer startet durch (2005). In 2007, he appeared as second lead in the fourth \"Die Hard\" film, Stirb langsam 4.0 (2007).\n\nHe continues to win acclaim and fans. He scored commercial success again with a role in the Jennifer Aniston romantic comedy Trennung mit Hindernissen (2006). He is private about his personal life and does not make a point of attending nightclubs and parties. However, his personal life did get scrutiny in 2008, due to his romance with actress Drew Barrymore that year.\n\nIn addition to his film appearances, he is a spokesman for the Apple Mac computers, appearing with John Hodgman in its commercials.\n\nBorn in Portland, Maine to a musically inclined family (her mother was once an opera singer) and on stage from the age of 5, singer/actress Linda Lavin graduated from The College of William and Mary with a theatre degree.\n\nLinda pounded the New York pavements in the early 1960s searching for work following some stock roles in New Jersey, and gradually made a dent within the New York musical comedy scene with roles in \"Oh, Kay!\" (1960), \"A Family Affair,\" (1962), \"It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman\" (1966) (her standout number was \"You've Got Possibilities\") and \"On a Clear Day, You Can See Forever\" (1966). She also won kudos for her straight acting roles in \"Little Murders\" (1969 Drama Desk award) and \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" (1969 Tony nomination). A one-time member of Paul Sills' Compass Players comedy troupe back in the late 1950s, she served as a replacement in Sills' \"Story Theatre\" Broadway production in 1971.\n\nTelevision beckoned in the 1970s and utilized her singing talents in a small-screen version of Damn Yankees! (1967) starring Phil Silvers and Lee Remick. After a one-season false start as Detective Janice Wentworth on the sitcom Barney Miller (1975), it did not take long for the talented lady to become a household name in another. As the titular waitress/mother in the sitcom Imbiß mit Biß (1976), based on the award-winning film Alice lebt hier nicht mehr (1974) starring Oscar winner Ellen Burstyn, Lavin won deserved stardom. During the nine seasons (1976-1985) the show was on the air, she nabbed two Golden Globe awards and an Emmy nomination. Ever the singer, she even warbled \"There's a New Girl in Town\" over the opening credits of the show to the delight of her fans.\n\nFollowing this success, Linda lavished her attentions once again on the stage. She earned renewed respect, in addition to several critic's awards, for her diversified Broadway work in \"Broadway Bound\" (1987 Tony award), \"Death Defying Acts\" (1995 Obie award), \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1998 Tony nomination: as the high-strung Mrs. Van Daan) and \"Tales of the Allergist Wife\" (2000 Tony nomination). She later appeared in a PBS-TV version of Collected Stories (2002) and in 2010 revived it on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination for her efforts. She has also occasionally directed for the stage.\n\nLinda was married and divorced twice to actors -- Ron Leibman and Kip Niven -- and in 2005 married her third husband, actor Steve Bakunas, who is also an artist and musician. After her \"Alice\" heyday, the actress would again return to series work, albeit the short-lived Room for Two (1992) and Conrad Bloom (1998).\n\nMillennium credits include penetrating/amusing TV work on \"The Sopranos,\" \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent,\" \"The O.C.,\" \"Madame Secretary,\" \"Santa Clarita Diet\" and \"Room 104,\" plus regular roles on three comedy series -- Sean Saves the World (2013), 9JKL (2017) and Yvette Slosch, Agent (2020) (title role). As for stage work, Linda returned to Broadway where she received fine reviews for her starring role in Carol Burnett's autobiographical play \"Hollywood Arms\" (2002) portraying Burnett's grandmother. The piece was co-written by Burnett's late daughter, Carrie Hamilton. Linda also received excellent reviews in \"Collected Stories\" (2010). Subsequent Broadway shows included brief runs of \"The Lyons\" (2012) and \"My Mother's Brief Affair.\"\n\nNew Zealand icon Lucy Lawless is most known for her role as \"Xena the Warrior Princess.\" Lucy is married to producer Rob Tapert (Robert Gerard Tapert) and resides in New Zealand.

His parents are Lisa (Goldman), who worked as his manager, and Larry Lerman, an orthotist and businessman. He has two siblings, Lindsey and Lucas, both older. His family operate the orthotics and prosthetics company Lerman & Son, which was founded by his great-grandfather, Jacob Lerman.\n\nWhen he was two and a half years old, Logan told his mother that he wanted to be an actor. At the age of four, Logan had an agent and was booked for two commercials. He made his big screen debut as William, the youngest son of Mel Gibson's character, in Roland Emmerich's war drama Der Patriot (2000), and then appeared as the younger version of Gibson's character Nick Marshall in Nancy Meyers's romantic comedy Was Frauen wollen (2000).

The next year, he played the son of Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) in the dark thriller Nummer 23 (2007), and co-starred with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in James Mangold's critically-acclaimed Western remake Todeszug nach Yuma (2007). His next two roles were a foul-mouthed private school student in the comedy Meet Bill (2007) and actor George Hamilton in the period drama My One and Only - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Right (2009). Both were independent films that received limited releases. Also in 2009, Logan appeared with Gerard Butler in the R-rated action thriller Gamer (2009), as a foul-mouthed teenager who controls Butler's character in a real-life video game.\n\nIn 2010, Logan starred as Percy in the fantasy adventure Percy Jackson: Diebe im Olymp (2010), based on the best-selling young adult book series of the same title. The film gave him notice among a wider audience. Subsequently, he starred as D'Artagnan in a remake of Die drei Musketiere (2011), which was Logan's grandfather's favorite childhood book. Lerman then headlined the coming-of-age indie drama Vielleicht lieber morgen (2012), alongside Emma Watson, Paul Rudd and Ezra Miller, based on the 1999 novel of the same name. Perks garnered numerous nominations and wins at the People's Choice Awards, The Independent Spirit Awards and the Teen Choice Awards, and Logan received a 2013 Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor in a Drama.

The Chinese Civil War (1927-1949) ended with a Communist victory. While the new regime financially subsidized China's theaters for most of the 1950s, it started withdrawing its support by the end of the decade and shut them down during the 1960s. Lu migrated to the United States by the late 1950s, in search of more career opportunities.\n\nIn 1960, Lu had her first notable film role as Madame Su-Mei Hung, the widow of a Chinese officer, in Der Kommandant (1960), set during World War II. She joins an American unit in an anti-Japanese mission in the Pacific War, and engages in a brief romance with their leader Major Baldwin (played by James Stewart). The relationship ends when Baldwin burns down an entire Chinese village, and creates thousands of casualties among the innocent civilians he treats as collateral damage. The conflict between the two lovers is based on Baldwin's idea that the end (his mission) sanctifies the means, and on her disagreement with his indiscriminate killings.\n\nIn 1961, she played the character of Chinese slave girl Su Ling, in an episode of Bonanza (1959). In 1962, she appeared in the Western film Rider on a Dead Horse (1962) and in the crime-drama Womanhunt (1962). She had a hand-full of television appearances for the rest of the decade. In the late 1960s, Lu found more work in Hong Kong films, most notably Die Rache der Gelben Tiger (1972), in which she played the semi-legendary She Saihua, a female general in the army of Emperor Taizong of Song (who reigned from 976-997).\n\nIn 1973, Lu appeared in the American horror film Der Bucklige vom Horror-Kabinett (1973).
