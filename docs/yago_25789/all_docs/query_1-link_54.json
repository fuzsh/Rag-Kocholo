        "text": "Short Capsule Reviews: Alexandre O. Philippe's Lynch/Oz (2022)\n\nA journey through the history of film, narrative, and genre through connections between Lynch's filmography and Victor Fleming's The Wizard of Oz (1939) . Sometimes academic and historical (Amy Nicholson, Karyn Kusama, and many of the six chapters) and other times humorous and self-referential (John Waters), the documentary has something for film fans, Lynch obsessives, and everyone in between.\n\nYasujiro Ozu Explorations\n\nI am going to start a new series on Yasujiro Ozu's films in the upcoming weeks where I rank and write capsule reviews for fifteen of his films. I have started watching a representative portion of his filmography, ranging from the silent comedies to his later works that deal with family, marriage, and society in the post war years, including the Noriko trilogy ( Late Spring , Early Summer , and Tokyo Story ) and all the movies he made with the incomparable Setsuko Hara. So far this project has been fun, and I cannot wait to share the results. Prepare for a discussion surrounding culture, dialogue, and the ever-present tatami shots.\n\nCoen Brothers Ranking\n\nI just watched all of the Coen Brothers movies on which they collaborated. Almost all of their films are good, and rating them was harder than I expected. I hope to eventually get around to their newer projects and those they scripted. A few of the later films could move up with additional viewings. 18. The Ladykillers 17. Intolerable Cruelty 16. Burn After Reading 15. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs 14. The Man Who Wasn't There 13. The Hudsucker Proxy 12. A Serious Man 11. Hail, Caesar! 10. Inside Llewyn Davis 9. O Brother, Where Art Thou? 8. True Grit 7. No Country for Old Men 6. Raising Arizona 5. Barton Fink 4. Blood Simple 3. The Big Lebowski 2. Fargo 1. Miller's Crossing\n\nQuick Capsule Reviews: Greg Renoff's Van Halen Rising\n\nGreg Renoff's compelling biography takes readers on a comprehensive trip through Van Halen's early years as a backyard party band that performed under names like Trojan Rubber Co. and Mammoth. It also covers their initial club gigs through their first stadium tours with luminaries like Black Sabbath. A good read for Van Halen fans and music biography fans alike, Renoff's narrative covers the tough life of a young band on the rise. I'm not a big hard rock fan and do not care much about their later music, so this one was perfect for me, but there is something for most music fans here. I found the section on David Lee Roth worming his way into the band particularly compelling. Since Eddie and Alex did not like his glam style or singing, he started his band to compete in the party scene, the aptly named Red Ball Jets, which focused more on pure entertainment. Once he convinced the Van Halen brothers to let him join, his marketing chops were integral in helping them become\n\nQuick Capsule Reviews: Jeff Tweedy's World Within A Song\n\nJeff Tweedy's newest book contains short and sometimes pithy discussions of songs that influenced his life and music. He intersperses them with memories and events that augment his thinking. Generally fun, often astute, occasionally maddening, but always entertaining, the book often goes in unexpected directions. Tweedy finds new life within the grooves and the stories that surround his musical discoveries. The most eye-opening moments to me happen when Tweedy finds something in each song that might relate to any of us. However, I also loved his discussions of early SST punk and lesser-known songs, and he often changed my mind or gave me new perspectives to ponder. He might also influence your approach to some popular tunes that he covers."
