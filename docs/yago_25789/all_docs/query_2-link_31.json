        "text": "On Friday, September 9, 1949, at 10:25 A.M., an eastbound Canadian Pacific Airline DC-3 left Ancienne Lorette, the airport of Quebec, on a scheduled run more or less following the course of the St. Lawrence River. The flight, known as Flight 108, had started at nine that morning in Montreal, and its ultimate destination was Seven Islands, a fishing village on the north shore of the St. Lawrence, opposite the Gaspé Peninsula and three hundred miles from Quebec. (Seven Islands has since become a much more thriving community, for it is being made ready to serve as a port for iron ore extracted from the Ungava region, to the north.) On board were nineteen passengers, including three small children, and a crew of four, all of them Canadians except for three men from New York—E. Tappan Stannard, Arthur D. Storke, and Russell J. Parker, who were the president, the president-designate, and a vice-president, respectively, of the Kennecott Copper Corporation.\n\nThe next scheduled stop on Flight 108 was Baie Comeau, a paper-pulp center two hundred and twenty miles northeast of Quebec. Several of the passengers planned to get off there, among them Mrs. J. Albert Guay, a twenty-nine-year-old Quebec housewife whose husband, a jewelry salesman, had asked her to pick up two suitcases containing rings and watches that he had put in storage there three weeks earlier, and to bring them back to Quebec. On occasion, Flight 108 also put down at Forestville, a lumber town halfway between Quebec and Baie Comeau, but this was just a flag stop. Ten minutes out of Quebec, the pilot, Captain Pierre Laurin, who was a veteran of seven years’ flying and whose wife was expecting a baby at any moment, was advised by radio-telephone from Ancienne Lorette that he could skip Forestville. Laurin acknowledged receipt of the message. That was the last word ever heard from him. Ten minutes afterward, at ten-forty-five, while the plane was cruising serenely, in fair weather, it was ripped by an explosion. The sound was audible to some people in and near Sault au Cochon, a fishing village forty miles northeast of Quebec, and also to an officer aboard the St. Laurent, a Canada Steamship Line boat en route from Montreal to Bagotville. Those who heard it looked up and saw a puff of white smoke billow out of the left side of the air liner. Then the plane veered sharply to the north and, within a few seconds, went out of control and plummeted almost straight down onto the spruce-and-balsam-covered side of a steep hill called Cap Tourmente. Everybody on board was killed instantly. In the number of fatalities, the accident was the third worst in the history of Canadian aviation, and because of this, as well as the fact that three of the victims were prominent industrialists from the United States, the incident attracted considerable attention. “What made it crash?” mused a reporter for the Montreal Star. He added, referring to the pilot, “The man who can best answer is among the dead.”\n\nThe man who could best have answered, and who, along with two accomplices, was to hang by the neck until dead in consequence of this knowledge, was at the moment of the disaster wandering around Quebec—just where, no one is certain, but there is reason to believe that he was on Dufferin Terrace, which adjoins the Château Frontenac and from which there is a magnificent view of the St. Lawrence to the east. If the man was there, he was undoubtedly gazing intently toward Cap Tourmente, for he expected the plane to blow up and had a pretty good notion when and where this would happen. He was J. Albert Guay, the thirty-one-year-old husband of the housewife on the plane, and a man who, though fond enough of his wife—“The last thing between us was a kiss,” he said later while recounting how he had ushered her into an airlines limousine at the Château Frontenac on the fatal morning—had no compunction about murdering her, as well as twenty-two people who were strangers to him, because he felt she complicated an affair he was having with a teen-age waitress.\n\nA French Canadian and a Roman Catholic, like the big majority of the inhabitants of the Province of Quebec, Guay was born on September 22, 1917, in Charny, on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, just across the river from Quebec City. He was the youngest of five children of a brakeman who had worked for the Canadian National Railways and who had been killed in a train accident when the boy was five. Nearly all French-Canadian children are given two Christian names, the first of which is frequently Joseph or Marie, as the case may be; to avoid confusion, the usual thing is to drop the Biblical name and use only the middle one. But Guay didn’t do this. Although his family and friends called him Albert, when he grew up he insisted on prefacing this with the initial “J.”—a just slightly out-of-the-ordinary touch, designed to help give him the stature he always aspired to. Short, slim, and nervous, with handsome features, curly black hair, and an engaging smile, Guay was a flashy dresser, and his ambition was to become a singer and orchestra leader. To be sure, he had no musical aptitude and a commonplace voice, but he was forever whistling the latest hit tunes, as though this might somehow lead him closer to his ambition. Guay went out of his way to act like a charming fellow. Whenever he had any money to spare, he was ostentatiously generous with it. His manners were good, and he was courteous to old ladies. At the time he was planning to murder his wife, he took several strolls with his parish priest, during which he discoursed eloquently on the decaying moral standards in their community. He clearly had no realization of people’s inclination to talk, for though he lived in a close-knit, gossipy neighborhood and kept the girl with whom he was fascinated in an apartment only a few blocks from the house occupied by his wife and their only child, a four-year-old girl, he endeavored to pose in church as a righteous family man, and after he had decided that murder was the answer to his problem, he was by no means discreet about discussing the subject with casual acquaintances. “He had the gall of a canal horse, that guy,” said a detective who was assigned to investigate the explosion. When Guay was arrested, it was recalled that ten days after the plane crash a Great Lakes steamer had mysteriously caught fire at its pier in Toronto, resulting in the death of a hundred and thirty-two passengers, and sardonic Quebecois went around saying that J. Albert Guay had probably hired someone to set the ship ablaze in order to get rid of a pet dog.\n\nAfter Guay’s father died, the family moved across the river to Limoilou, a suburb of Quebec. Albert didn’t have much formal education, but he was clever and quick and cocky. At sixteen, he was a familiar figure in pool halls, where he earned a dollar here and a dollar there by selling watches and jewelry, on commission, to other hangers-on. Early in 1941, at the age of twenty-three, he got a job at the St.-Malo Arsenal, in Quebec. Guay’s assignment didn’t require any special skill—he tended a grinding machine—but it appears to have got him deferred from military service. (French Canadians have traditionally been reluctant to fight what they consider British wars, and it was not difficult to obtain draft deferments in Quebec.) He amplified his wages, which were forty dollars a week, by selling jewelry to other employees in the arsenal; he did well enough to buy a car, and he was considered a dashing figure by the young ladies in the factory. Presently, he singled out one of them—a plump, attractive brunette, with large brown eyes and nice teeth, named Rita Morel. In August, 1941, they were married, and they moved into a modest apartment in the Lower Town section of Quebec. Lower Town is the part of the city that lies along the river, overshadowed by the towering cliffs of the Citadel behind it, and its residential section, which is as near as anything in Quebec to being a slum, is inhabited chiefly by people, most of them French Canadians, who figuratively as well as literally have been unable to rise above it.\n\nAmong the other employees at the arsenal was a woman, later to become Guay’s close friend and fellow-murderer, who had been born Marguerite Ruest, in 1908, at St.-Octave, in the southeastern part of the Province of Quebec. Her father was a cook in a lumber camp, and she grew up in a rough-and-tumble atmosphere. She became rather rough-and-tumble herself. She was a dark-complexioned, dark-haired, broad-faced, dumpy woman with a caustic tongue, and she was always willing to do someone a favor. At the age of twenty-two, she spent two months in jail for selling alcohol illegally. She was so agreeably disposed toward men that, although the statistics are not well authenticated, she is thought by the Provincial Police to have given birth over the years to fourteen children by a variety of fathers. Whatever the precise total, she brought up only two—both sons. One was by a man named Michaud, whom she married around the time she moved to Quebec, at the start of the Second World War. The other was by a man named Pitre, with whom she began living while she was still married to Michaud. Five or six years after she left Michaud, he died, and in May, 1949, she married Pitre, who worked as a handyman in a Quebec factory.\n\nMrs. Pitre was as industrious as she was agreeable. After the war, she worked on and off as a waitress, took in boarders, and, as a favor to her friends—she had a wide acquaintance among the shadier elements of Lower Town society—occasionally performed abortions. Shortly after she was publicly identified as somebody who might have had something to do with the plane crash, a rather stout young woman representing a Canadian newspaper went around to interview her. The girl presented herself at Mrs. Pitre’s home, and was surprised when the lady of the house, upon opening the door, scrutinized her carefully and said, before any introductions could be made, “How many months?” Mrs. Pitre was voluble and amiable during the long proceedings that finally led her to the gallows, and got on splendidly with the various detectives who questioned her. At one appearance in the grim, stately Quebec courthouse, the Palais de Justice, she passed close by the chief detective of the Municipal Police, a man of marked dignity, and astonished him, and a lot of spectators, by reaching out playfully and pinching his right ear. At another, while she was being escorted into the courtroom by a custodian, she began singing a suggestive ditty to him entitled “Quand Nous Sommes Tous les Deux.”\n\nMrs. Pitre was very fond of Guay, nine years her junior. Though his social standing was not much, even in Lower Town, it was a cut or two above hers, and it flattered her to think that so promising a young gentleman should pay any attention to her. “I am like a mother to him,” she once said. According to residents of Quebec who knew them both, she may have been more than that. Her husband, it is known, once accused her of having an affair with Guay—a charge she denied, maintaining that Guay was a business associate of hers. (He lent her money from time to time.) Guay himself declared to a friend, after Mrs. Pitre and he had become implicated in the murder, that the husband’s charge was baseless. “Have you seen her?” Guay asked. “Impossible!” But the feeling persists among many residents of Lower Town that where Guay and Mrs. Pitre were concerned nothing was impossible.\n\nMrs. Pitre was the link between Guay and the third person who was to be hanged for helping to bring down the airplane—her older brother, Généreux. Généreux Ruest, in 1949, was a thin-lipped, gray-haired, dark-browed bachelor of fifty-one who had been afflicted for years with tuberculosis of both hips and could walk only with the aid of crutches. The crippled man was a watchmaker, and a good one. As in the case of many other physically handicapped people, the strength he had lost in one set of limbs seemed to have been transferred to another. He had powerful arms and hands, and deft fingers. Ruest was governed by a moral code not notably more elevated than his sister’s. While he was a patient in a Catholic hospital one time, he persuaded a nun who was his nurse to let him entertain a prostitute in a private room by telling the nun that the woman was his wife.\n\nToward the end of the war, Guay left the arsenal and became a full-time jewelry salesman, moving, with his wife, to Seven Islands, where their daughter, Lise, was born in 1945. Using his home as a base of operations, he travelled from one river town to another, impressing the unworldly residents by his fluent sales talk and his twinkling line of goods. He sold engagement rings, crucifixes, and watches, mostly on the installment plan, and he picked up watches in need of repair and sent them to Quebec to be fixed by Ruest, who had a workshop in his apartment there.\n\nIn the summer of 1947, while on a visit to Quebec, Guay dropped in at a Lower Town café—he was not much of a drinker, but he liked a beer or two now and then—and struck up a conversation with a waitress in the place named Marie-Ange Robitaille. The two hit it off fine. Marie-Ange was a tall, lanky, well-built, not very bright girl with a pleasant voice, jet-black hair, plucked eyebrows, a turned-up nose, and large, dark eyes that frequently looked as if she hadn’t been getting enough sleep. She was seventeen when she met Guay, but she told him she was nineteen. This deception was trivial compared to what she and Guay subsequently told her parents about him. Marie-Ange knew who he was and that he had a wife and child, but as far as her parents were concerned, he was an earnest young bachelor named Roger Angers (he borrowed the name from a popular singer he envied) and a promising match for their daughter. Guay gave Marie-Ange a ring, a gesture that it was relatively easy for a jewelry salesman to make. Early in 1948, he moved his family and his business to St.-Sauveur Street, in Lower Town, where he rented most of the ground floor—a store in front and living quarters in the rear—of a fairly modern apartment house. For a time, he advertised his business on the early-morning show of a Quebec disc jockey; listeners were facetiously advised that if they wanted their watches broken forever, they should bring them to Guay’s place, across the street from the Church of St. Joseph. The last check Guay sent to the disc jockey bounced.\n\nA year or so after Guay met Marie-Ange, he began calling on her at her family’s home two or three nights a week and paying formal court. This interlude was brought to a dramatic end one evening in November, 1948, when Guay’s wife, who had finally learned what other residents of Lower Town had been gossiping about for months, showed up at the Robitailles’ herself and informed Marie-Ange’s parents that Roger Angers was J. Albert Guay and ineligible as a suitor. The Robitailles turned their daughter out of the house a few hours later. She got in touch with Guay, and he called Mrs. Pitre, who was still legally Mrs. Michaud, although she had been living with Pitre for some time. At the moment, she and Pitre were a trifle out of their element, for, as a result of some windfall, they were occupying an apartment on Richelieu Street, in Upper Town—only three doors away, as it happened, from the home of the mayor of Quebec. Guay asked Mrs. Pitre if she would take in the homeless Marie-Ange, and, in her usual helpful manner, she agreed to. Marie-Ange moved in at five that morning. A week later, Pitre and his mistress moved to St.-Valier Street, which is in Lower Town and had lost the distinction of being the center of Quebec’s red-light district only a few years before, when it was closed down to protect the morals of service men during the war. Marie-Ange stayed on in the Richelieu Street apartment, and Guay paid the rent.\n\nMarie-Ange’s parents soon changed their minds and wanted her to return home, but they found it difficult to communicate with her. Afraid that they would make trouble for her if they found out where she was, she pretended she was living in Montreal and sent them a postcard to that effect in the course of a two-day visit she and Guay paid there. Early in 1949, she resolved to go home and have nothing more to do with Guay. Presumably with the idea of substantiating her story by having her parents meet her at the station, she decided she would return to them by way of Montreal. Accordingly, she borrowed fifty dollars from the proprietor of a restaurant she had worked in and bought a round-trip railroad ticket to Montreal. She booked space on a night train one cold evening and, while she was waiting for her berth to be made up, went into the ladies’ washroom of the sleeping car. Presently, there was a knock on the door. It was Guay, who had followed her, and who told her that if she didn’t get off the train right away, he’d make a scene. He took her back to the Richelieu Street apartment, where, as a precaution against her trying to escape again, he threw her gloves into a stove and went to bed with her coat wrapped around him. The next morning, in an effort to embarrass her into staying put, he bit her in the face several times. Then he went off and cashed in her unused train ticket.\n\nIn April, with a display of ingenuousness that set the pace for the conduct of all three principals in the crime, Guay approached a twenty-one-year-old friend of the family named Lucien Carreau and blandly offered him five hundred dollars to murder Mrs. Guay. His proposal was that Carreau call on her, taking with him a bag of poison and a bottle of cherry wine, both of which Guay would provide. Carreau was to chat with Mrs. Guay for awhile and then offer her a glass of the wine after surreptitiously putting some of the poison in it. Her husband was sure she would accept it. French Canadians drink wines the way other people drink highballs, and Mrs. Guay was especially partial to cherry wine. Carreau heard Guay out, told him he was crazy, and dismissed the matter then and there.\n\nOn May 7th, a Philippine Air Lines plane blew up and fell into the sea near Manila, killing thirteen people. It was ascertained that an admirer of a woman whose husband was aboard had hired a couple of former convicts to conceal a time bomb in the plane. The crash and its aftermath were briefly described in the Canadian press, and it seems probable that the story came to Guay’s attention, for by the following month he was riding in a plane, watch in hand, above the St. Lawrence, carefully noting when he was over the river and when over land. His reasoning, it later developed, was that when a plane blows up in the air it is far more difficult to reconstruct what happened if the plane plunges into water than if it crashes on land.\n\nLeading up to this ghoulish flight was a new series of domestic and extramarital wrangles of the sort in which Guay was constantly becoming embroiled. Early in June, his wife, unaware of his overture to Lucien Carreau but generally fed up, moved, with their child, from the St.-Sauveur Street apartment into the nearby home of her mother, Mrs. Wilfred Morel. At about the same time, Marie-Ange deserted Guay, returned to her parents, and got a job as a waitress in a Lower Town restaurant. After being beset for so long by at least one too many women, Guay now found himself without any. As Marie-Ange was walking to work one evening in June, he accosted her, pulled a gun, and declared that if she didn’t return to him he’d shoot himself, and maybe her, too. She told him to leave her alone or she’d he late to work. He persisted, but a policeman, hearing them arguing, walked up, and Guay ran off. The policeman escorted Marie-Ange to the restaurant and hung around, waiting to see if Guay would show up again. He did, and was taken to Municipal Police Headquarters, at City Hall, where he was booked for attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Guay telephoned Mrs. Pitre (she had married Pitre by this time) and she got him a lawyer, who succeeded in having the charge reduced to one of carrying a gun illegally. The next morning, Guay was fined twenty-five dollars and set free.\n\nTwo days later, Guay telephoned Marie-Ange and told her it was vital that they meet. The mercurial girl agreed to see him, and when they got together, Guay told her that his wife was going to have her arrested for besmirching the Guay name by having had him arrested. He said Marie-Ange had better go to Montreal at once and hide out there until things blew over. “Every time he came into my life, there was disorder,” Marie-Ange said later. She never seems to have tried very hard to prevent or tidy up the disorder. On this occasion, she meekly left at once for Montreal—with Guay. In Montreal, he bought her some new clothes and was so attentive to her that she consented to fly with him to Seven Islands and set up housekeeping there. During the lap between Quebec and Baie Comeau, Guay, who had been occupying an aisle seat next to Marie-Ange, moved to a vacant window seat and began keeping his watch-in-hand vigil to compile his mental timetable. Marie-Ange paid little attention to her companion’s interest in the landscape, for she was violently airsick most of the way.\n\nAt Seven Islands, Guay and Marie-Ange were quarrelling again within a week. Then they stopped speaking, and at the end of July she left him and returned to Quebec. As she walked out, he handed her a note. “I love you terribly,” it read. “We’ll be together again very soon.” A postscript instructed her to destroy the note after reading it, but she didn’t.\n\nAt that juncture, Guay concluded that the only way to be happy with Marie-Ange was to marry her. His wife was unlikely to grant him a divorce, and he was hardly in a position to sue for one. Besides, everybody concerned was a Catholic. However transitory Guay’s scheme to poison his wife may have been, he now began to think seriously about killing her. This time, he gave the matter much careful consideration. He was well aware that his unfaithfulness to his wife was a matter of common knowledge; if, then, there was any suspicion that she had been murdered, there would also be suspicion that he was the murderer. Besides, the idea of a forthright slaying simply did not appeal to him. He didn’t want to be present when his wife died, and he didn’t want to have a direct hand in the murder. He apparently discussed his predicament with several people, one of whom wrote an anonymous letter to Mrs. Guay early in August, saying, “Watch out, because something is going to happen to you.” Another person he consulted was Mrs. Pitre, who amiably apprised Marie-Ange of his intention. By the middle of the month, Mrs. Pitre and her brother Généreux Ruest had agreed to help Guay dispose of his wife. Why they agreed to has puzzled a number of students of their destinies. Guay’s own motivation is understandable enough—as understandable, at least, as that behind many crimes of passion. But while, as he saw it, he stood to gain Marie-Ange, his cronies stood to gain very little. When the brother and sister were tried for murder, the prosecution never attempted to establish a motive for either of them. Speculative residents of Quebec have sought to fill in this gap. The most widely held theory is that Mrs. Pitre and Ruest were a pair so dominated by Guay and so basically amoral that they did not need what the ordinary person might consider a compelling motive. Mrs. Pitre did, however, owe Guay six hundred dollars, a debt that he promised to cancel if she would assist him. It is also thought not improbable that she hoped to blackmail him after the crime. Some people who followed the case closely have suggested that she may even have had the notion of alienating Marie-Ange from Guay by telling her that he had murdered his wife, and of thus getting Guay entirely for herself. As for Ruest, he, too, was in financial difficulties. A woman he was friendly with had just informed him that she was pregnant, thanks to him, and was nagging him for three hundred dollars to see her through her dilemma. Guay offered to put up the money in return for Ruest’s help, and, as an added inducement (Ruest’s demands were not exorbitant), to knock fifty per cent off the price of a twelve-dollar ring Ruest wanted for another woman he knew. There was also some talk of buying Ruest a new car if things worked out right. And Ruest had still another reason for being disposed to murder Mrs. Guay; he had tried to take her out one night while her husband was away, and she had turned him down.\n\nEarly in August, Guay travelled to Baie Comeau by river boat, lugging along two suitcases full of jewelry he hoped to sell. He found business in the summer doldrums, however, so he stored the suitcases in a warehouse and sailed back to Quebec, arriving on August 17th, and went to stay with his wife and child at Mrs. Morel’s. The next day, he got together with Ruest and Mrs. Pitre, and discussed making a bomb. Ruest, skillful with his hands, volunteered to put together a detonating mechanism in his workshop, and Mrs. Pitre was assigned the job of buying some dynamite and detonating caps and a length of fuse. She went to a hardware store and found that it is impossible to buy dynamite in Canada without signing for it, so she signed a fictitious name, telling the clerk that she was making the purchase on behalf of a woman who lived at Rivière-aux-Pins and wanted to blast some tree stumps. She bought twenty half-pound sticks of dynamite, fifteen detonating caps, and a thirty-foot length of fuse, and took them that evening to a restaurant she was working in. She wrapped the dynamite in a piece of plain brown paper that had enclosed some bags of potato chips and gave it to Guay when he stopped by. “I didn’t have time to wrap it properly,” she explained later. “You see, I had to serve a little girl who wanted ice cream.” Guay took the package to Ruest and, late that night, headed back to Seven Islands, taking his wife with him, for a week’s holiday. She understood it was to be a reconciliation, and he put himself out to be kind to her.\n\nThe couple returned to Quebec after a week, and Guay went at once to Ruest’s apartment to see what progress he had made with the bomb. It appeared he hadn’t made any. While they were pondering the problem, a customer stopped in to leave a watch for repair. “Here’s a man who can tell us about dynamite!” exclaimed Ruest, displaying his full share of naïveté. The customer could indeed; he was a retired miner. Guay and Ruest explained to him that they wanted to use dynamite to kill fish in a lake, and began asking him questions. The customer wasn’t much help. He said it was dangerous for amateurs to fool around with dynamite, and recalled the case of a man he knew who had lost a hand that way. Anyhow, he declared, lime would do a job on fish just as effectively, and much more safely. While Guay and Ruest pretended interest, he told them at some length how to kill fish with lime, and then departed.\n\nLeft thus to their own devices, Guay and Ruest decided to rig up a time bomb, consisting principally of an alarm clock, a dry-cell battery, a detonator, and a detonating cap. As a preliminary step, Ruest produced an experimental bomb that lacked only dynamite and put it in a cardboard box, and while he and Guay cowered in the next room, the alarm clock set off the detonator and this exploded the detonating cap. At this point, the conspirators were sidetracked by an idea that, had they gone through with it, would have saved twenty-two lives. It being Mrs. Pitre’s turn to be ingenuous, she proposed that they enlist the aid of a taxi-driver who lived in an apartment above hers and with whom she was on better than friendly terms. She would invite him into her apartment some evening, she said, and tell him that she wanted to hire him to take the Guays for a ride in the country in his taxi. She would explain to him that there would be a time bomb in the trunk of his cab. At a certain point, the driver would pretend that something had gone wrong with his engine, and he and Guay would get out and ostensibly go for help, leaving Mrs. Guay sitting there. In five minutes or so, the bomb would explode. Mrs. Pitre’s scheme struck Guay and Ruest as a masterpiece of devilish cunning, and they encouraged her to go ahead with it. She invited the taxi-driver to her apartment and, while Guay listened in from behind a curtain, outlined the plan. The taxi-driver said he had no intention of destroying his cab, and went back upstairs. A few minutes later, Mrs. Pitre, evidently sensing that she might have been a bit indiscreet, rushed up to the driver’s apartment with the idea of covering her elephantine tracks by informing the driver that she had been only joking about the time bomb and that what she had really meant to say was that she wanted to hire the cab to take an illegitimate child to another city. Guay could hardly have been pleased with his accomplice’s performance that evening.\n\nUp to the time Mrs. Pitre put on her babbling act, Guay had been thinking of an airplane as only one of a number of conveyances in which to place his wife and a bomb. A plane was the least likely one to leave any damaging evidence, but a plane was also the least likely one for Mrs. Guay to be inclined to board by herself. Musing over this problem, Guay recalled his two suitcases at Baie Comeau and decided to send his wife for them. She wasn’t particularly eager to undertake this packhorse mission, but, heartened by her husband’s recent show of solicitude for her, she consented to go. On the afternoon of Tuesday, September 6th, Guay went to the Canadian Pacific Airlines ticket office in the Château Frontenac and made a reservation for his wife on the ten-twenty plane to Baie Comeau on the morning of the ninth, the earliest date space was available. To allay suspicion, he bought a round-trip ticket. Then, not one to shun betting on a sure thing, he invested fifty cents in a ten-thousand-dollar flight-insurance policy on his wife, naming himself as beneficiary. That night, he escorted his wife to the theatre.\n\nEarly on the morning of the seventh, the airline telephoned Mrs. Guay, at her mother’s home, to advise her that a reservation had been cancelled on that day’s flight to Baie Comeau, and that if she hurried, she could have the vacant seat. Guay, who was still staying there, answered the phone, and said that his wife couldn’t change her plans so quickly. He certainly couldn’t have changed his, because the bomb wasn’t ready. On the eighth, he considerately spent practically the entire day with his wife and child, leaving them only to telephone Mrs. Pitre and ask her to meet him at the Gare du Palais, the principal railroad station in Quebec, at a quarter after eight o’clock the next morning; and to drop in on Ruest and help him put the finishing touches on the bomb. Guay instructed Ruest to adjust the bomb so that it would explode at ten-forty-five the following morning, at which time—or so he believed, on the basis of his reconnaissance three months before—the plane would be over the first wide stretch of the St Lawrence.\n\nIt was Guay’s habit while staying at his mother-in-law’s, to hang his trousers behind the bathroom door when he went to bed. A brother-in-law of Mrs. Guay’s, who was also living there, with his wife, arose at seven-twenty on the morning of Friday, the ninth, to dress for work, and was surprised to notice that Guay’s trousers were missing from their usual place, for Guay wasn’t normally an early riser. Shortly after seven, Guay had appeared at Ruest’s to pick up the bomb. Ruest had it ready for him, packed in a cardboard carton and set to go off at ten-forty-five. The two men wrapped it in brown paper, tied it with string, scrawled “FRAGILE” on the package in bold letters, addressed it to a nonexistent Alfred Plouffe, at Baie Comeau, and, picking another name at random, identified the sender as Delphis Bouchard, of St.-Siméon, a town a hundred miles from Quebec. Guay took the bomb in a taxi to the railroad station, where he checked it in a ten-cent public locker and went to the station cafeteria for breakfast. There he encountered a railroad employee who knew him and wanted to talk about an engagement ring his prospective son-in-law had ordered. An indifferent salesman at that moment, Guay shook him off in time to meet Mrs. Pitre when she arrived, at eight-fifteen. He got the package for her, and she took it by taxi to the airport, twelve miles out of town, where she arranged to have it shipped out on Flight 108 that morning. Then she returned to Quebec in the same taxi.\n\nGuay, meanwhile, had hurried back to his mother-in-law’s. He explained to her that he had been unable to sleep and had gone out for a cup of coffee. His wife was up by then, preparing for her trip. At nine-thirty, the Guays took a taxi to the Château Frontenac, and Mrs. Guay left from there for the airport. A few minutes later, Mrs. Pitre got back from the airport and went to her brother’s. Guay telephoned her there, and was pleased to learn that there had been no hitches in their plan—or so they both thought. Actually, there was one. Flight 108 was five minutes late out of Quebec. Guay’s determination of the most propitious moment for the explosion had been based on a simple-minded faith in the dependability of airline timetables. Because of its late departure, the plane fell not into water but onto the side of Cap Tourmente.\n\nGuay walked the twisting streets of Quebec for nearly an hour after the bomb had been set to go off, and then returned to his mother-in-law’s house. He told Mrs. Morel he had a headache, and she went to a neighborhood drugstore to get him some medicine. The first news of the crash came over the radio at one o’clock. It was a flash, without names of passengers. By three-thirty, Mrs. Morel was getting telephone calls from various relatives, inquiring if her daughter had survived. She asked Guay to try to find out. He went, with his daughter, to the ticket office in the Château Frontenac and asked a girl on duty there if it was true that his wife’s plane had crashed. The girl nodded. Then Guay began to sob and moan. He collapsed in an armchair in the lobby and bawled so uncontrollably that a sympathetic airline official summoned a priest from the nearby Basilique de Québec to comfort him.\n\nThe spot where the plane fell was about an hour’s walk up a steep mountain trail from some tracks of the Canadian National Railways that run along the north bank of the St. Lawrence. An even longer walk down the mountain confronted those who tried to reach the place by car. By the end of the day, only a handful of people had got anywhere near it. Among them was Guay, who, in the best tradition of murderers, had been drawn to, if not precisely the scene of his crime, the gruesome evidence of it. With three companions, two of them the husbands of Mrs. Guay’s sisters and the third an acquaintance who went along for the ride, Guay drove from Quebec to Cap Tourmente, and they all walked down until they were turned back by police guarding the wreckage against looters or souvenir hunters. Guay did not, therefore, get near enough to see how horribly mutilated the victims were and to become aware that, of them all, the only body with a recognizable face was his wife’s. Nor did he learn until later that among the passengers’ few possessions that were left intact were two claim checks in Mrs. Guay’s purse for the two suitcases full of jewelry at Baie Comeau.\n\nAt first, no one suspected that the crash was anything but accidental. However, the Canadian Pacific Railway, a billion-dollar, worldwide enterprise of which the airline is a relatively modest subsidiary, was profoundly dismayed. There had not been a passenger fatality on any of its air routes since 1942, and it was dismayed at what apparently could be explained only as a failure of either its manpower or its equipment. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway Investigations Department, a placid, shrewd man named Jean E. Bélanger, had looked into countless accidents of one kind or another, but until then he had never—to his great satisfaction—had occasion to investigate a plane crash. Guay and his two accomplices had thought that after an initial flurry of excitement the incident would be dismissed as just one of those things. What they didn’t reckon on was that Canadian Pacific would react emotionally, like the mother—a large and powerful and angry one—of an assaulted child, and, perplexed and outraged at what had befallen its offspring, would stay with the case no matter how baffling it seemed. On a less emotional level, the company was, of course, not unaware that if it was held responsible, substantial damage suits would certainly be filed against it by relatives of the victims. One relative who was already thinking along such lines was Guay. Two days after the crash, he telephoned his lawyer to inquire what legal steps he should take against Canadian Pacific in the event that the company was found negligent.\n\nBy mid-afternoon Friday, the head of Canadian Pacific Airlines, Grant W. G. McConachie, a veteran bush pilot turned executive, was flying East from his headquarters in Vancouver with a youthful but expert aeronautical engineer named Frank M. Francis, who was employed by the same line. By nightfall, representatives of quite a few interested agencies were mobilizing to investigate the disaster—the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Department of Transport, and the Provincial Police of Quebec. Over the weekend, most of the authorities concerned with the crash busied themselves with gathering up the bodies, or parts of bodies, and conveying them to Quebec for a coroner’s inquest. At the urging of Canadian Pacific Airlines, the bodies of the four members of the plane’s crew were autopsied, to find out if, by chance, they had lost control of the plane because of son1e sudden, freakish mass disability. The answer was no. (The grim task of dealing with the corpses was enlivened by a scrap between two firms of undertakers, one engaged by the airline and one by the provincial government. Both thought they had a right to all the bodies, but a compromise was finally arrived at, with half the dead going to each. ) Guay’s behavior at the city morgue, where the victims were laid out for identification, was consistent with his behavior at the Château Frontenac. Trembling and crying, he declined to look at his wife, saying that he wanted to remember her as she had been, and left the distressing chore of identifying her to a brother-in-law. Guay gave her a lavish funeral. He ordered an eight-hundred-dollar casket, bought a wreath in his daughter’s name, and as his own tribute purchased a five-foot cross of red roses with a heart of white roses at the center, which bore the inscription “From your beloved Albert.” He acted extremely distraught at the funeral parlor and at the cemetery, and some of his friends and neighbors, who knew that for two years he had been behaving irresponsibly toward his wife, marvelled at the fervor of his anguish. But grief is contagious, and many of the people at the funeral soon felt sorry for the sobbing young father of a motherless child.\n\nDuring the first weekend after the disaster, Bélanger, whose headquarters are in Montreal, sent one of his staff, Andrew H. Stott, out to the scene of the crash. Bélanger did not think it was necessary to go himself, having no suspicion that anything extraordinary had taken place. On Monday morning, he sent two more of his assistants to Quebec to work on the case. One of them, Jules Perrault, telephoned him that afternoon. “All he told me was ‘I don’t like this,’ ” Bélanger recalled recently. “But Perrault has the faculty of conveying whole ideas in a few words, so I knew something was up.” Bélanger left for Quebec at once, and established himself in a suite at the Château Frontenac, which his company owns and operates. By then, Francis, who had arrived from the West Coast, and a number of other investigators had poked through the wreckage and had become convinced that the plane had blown up before it crashed. They had talked to a couple of the local folk who had heard what sounded like an explosion while the plane was still in flight, and had seen objects tumble from it before it fell to earth. There was evidence that the plane’s engines were still turning over when they struck the ground; the tips of both propellers were bent forward, which to engineers meant that they had been spinning when they hit. Furthermore, although the plane had gone down nose first, which would normally have flung the people in it toward the front, bits of flesh had been spattered against the back of the passenger compartment, indicating that there had been some violent rearward thrust.\n\nSo the question was: What had made the plane explode? There were still traces of gasoline in its battered tanks and there had been no fire, which eliminated its own fuel as the cause. Could it have been a defect in some piece of the plane’s accessories—radio batteries, carbon-dioxide fire extinguishers, and so on? Enough traces of each were discovered to make it fairly certain that none had exploded. One thing that particularly confounded the investigators was that the first people to reach the spot reported having smelled something that reminded them of dynamite, which was most certainly not an accessory on any plane, and which, indeed, the Aeronautics Act of Canada forbids any plane to carry as cargo, except under very rare and controlled circumstances. No authorization to carry dynamite had been granted for Flight 108.\n\nThe condition of the wreckage left little doubt as to where the explosion had occurred—in the forward baggage section, known as the No. 1 compartment, on the left side of the aisle leading from the cabin to the control room. The seat closest to this compartment was found a quarter of a mile from where the plane crashed, a fact leading to the inescapable conclusion that it had been hurled out while the plane was still in the air. Bélanger and his men began checking on the contents of No 1. Their task was fairly simple, owing to the fact that the compartment had been emptied at Quebec, after the first leg of the flight, and that everything in it had been put aboard there. The airline’s cargo manifest showed that in No. 1 there had been eight pieces of hand luggage belonging to passengers who had been killed in the crash; three valises and two typewriters belonging to passengers who had made the same flight two days earlier, when there was not enough space for all the baggage; and three air-express packages. One of these contained automobile parts, another contained lingerie, and the third was a twenty-five-pound parcel, contents unspecified, that had been shipped, according to the manifest, from Delphis Bouchard, of St.-Siméon, to Alfred Plouffe, of Baie Comeau.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the investigators to focus their interest on this last parcel. Nobody named Alfred Plouffe was known in Baie Comeau. A man named Delphis Bouchard, who was a resident of St.-Siméon and a night watchman on a bridge, said he didn’t know anything about any such shipment. Nor did Mrs. Delphis Bouchard, a resident of Montreal who summered at St.-Siméon and who was no relation to the night watchman. Neither of them could throw any light on the identity of the person the baggage clerk at the Quebec airport said had brought the parcel there—a dark-haired woman in her forties, who had arrived by taxi shortly before the plane was scheduled to take off and had departed in the same taxi. The baggage clerk recalled that the taxi-driver had lugged the parcel into the terminal for the woman, and then—proving himself a singular example of his species—had broken a ten-dollar bill for her when it developed that the clerk had insufficient change.\n\nConcurrently, as the evidence piling up indicated that a crime might have been committed, the passenger manifest was being carefully checked. At first, attention centered on the three Kennecott Copper executives. Although no logical motive for murdering them was unearthed, the mere fact that they were men of affairs made some of the investigators conjecture that they might have had determined enemies. While not discarding this possibility, Perrault, Bélanger’s laconic operative, systematically proceeded to inquire into the background of all the other passengers, too, and by the time he finished, he had found that only in the case of a relatively obscure one, Mrs. Guay, was there a credible motive.\n\nBélanger was not put off the track when, on September 14th a coroner’s jury convened to consider the crash handed down a verdict of “accidental death due to an explosion of undetermined origin.” Nothing was said in the verdict about the possibility of criminal intent. To be sure, the coroner’s jury had concluded that the explosive agent, whatever its nature, was not an integral part of the aircraft, but although this apparently absolved Canadian Pacific of responsibility, the company was far from satisfied. Bélanger passed Perrault’s disclosures along to the Municipal Police of Quebec, and they, recalling Guay’s sidewalk fracas with Marie-Ange, went to see the girl. They described the dark-haired woman to her, and asked if that sounded like anyone Guay knew. Why, of course, said Marie-Ange; that must be Mrs. Pitre. Bélanger was also working closely with the Mounted Police, and they were instrumental in, for one thing, turning up the taxi-driver who had so impressed the baggage clerk at the airport. All Quebec taxi-drivers keep detailed records of their trips, and from these it was possible to establish that on the morning of September 9th only one had made a round trip to the airport carrying a woman with a package. He was Paul-Henri Pelletier, who remembered the trip well: The passenger had been a dark-haired woman with a heavy parcel marked “FRAGILE;” he had barely avoided running into a potato truck on the way to the airport; his passenger must have been a Quebec woman, because on her way back to town she had directed him to “the Château,” as a resident of the city would, rather than to “the Château Frontenac;” she had tipped him fifty-five cents on a three-forty-five fare; after hearing of the crash, he had remarked to an acquaintance, “That lady I took to the airport is sure going to lose her parcel.” Pelletier had no idea who the woman was.\n\nThe next step was to identify Mrs. Pitre as the woman who had delivered the package to the airport, and since the baggage clerk had only a hazy recollection of her appearance, Pelletier seemed to be the man to do it. At this time, as far as Guay and the rest of the public knew, the crash of the airliner had been written off as an inexplicable mystery, and the investigators, not wanting to arouse apprehensions that might prompt suspects to disappear, were working in secrecy. Therefore, instead of taking Mrs. Pitre into custody and confronting her with Pelletier, they instructed the driver to hang around outside her apartment house and get a good look at her when he came out. After Pelletier had spent many hours in front of the building without a glimpse of her, the investigators decided she was not going to come out, so they told him to knock at her door and pretend that someone there had phoned for a cab. He did, but a friend of Mrs. Pitre’s answered and said nobody had phoned for a cab. Then a police official recalled that Mrs. Pitre’s son by her first husband, Michaud, had once been brought up for a hearing in juvenile court. The situation was explained to a judge of that court, and he agreed to telephone Mrs. Pitre and ask her to come to see him about her son. Maternal anxiety and fear of the law combined to lure her from her apartment. As she stepped outside, Pelletier was waiting in his cab, and he took a good look at her. However, she was wearing dark glasses, which she had not done on the ride to the airport, and he was therefore unable to identify her unequivocally. The investigators decided to continue biding their time.\n\nPelletier was less patient. Unable to keep his exciting adventures to himself, he got in touch with an elderly reporter he knew who worked for Le Canada, a French-language morning paper published in Montreal, and tipped him off. The reporter wrote a story that, without mentioning names, said the police were hot on the trail of a woman who had delivered an unusual package to the airport.\n\nThe story appeared on September 15th, but Guay apparently did not see it at once. On September 18th, he got together with Mrs. Pitre for the first time since the crash, visiting her at her apartment, to which, at his request, she had invited Marie-Ange. In the course of this little rendezvous, Guay told Marie-Ange he hoped that after he had observed a decent period of mourning the two of them would be able to live happily together. By the next day, he definitely had read the story in Le Canada. He returned to Mrs. Pitre’s in a considerably less sentimental mood and told her they were in serious trouble. But, he added resourcefully, he had an excellent solution: Mrs. Pitre should commit suicide, and while she was at it, she might as well leave a note behind explaining that she had put the bomb in the airplane because she thought Guay would be a passenger on it.\n\nObliging though Mrs. Pitre was by nature, she evidently felt that this would be going too far. Instead, that night, after telling Thérèse Noël, the fiancée of another brother of hers, what Guay had proposed, she called her doctor, complained of suffering from a recurrence of an old abdominal ailment, and asked him to get her admitted to a hospital. He did so the next day. She took along a bottle of sleeping pills and, once installed in a bed, swallowed enough of them to make her drowsy—simply because she felt the staff physicians were not showing enough interest in her case and wanted to attract their attention to her condition, she later said. In the meantime, Thérèse Noël had told the owner of a restaurant where she worked about Guay’s proposal to Mrs. Pitre, and he had told a Canadian Pacific man he knew. On September 21st, Guay telephoned Marie-Ange and invited her out the following evening to help him celebrate his thirty-second birthday. She declined. On September 23rd, Mrs. Pitre returned home and was questioned by the authorities. She readily admitted that she had taken a package to the airport on September 9th. She said that she had done it as a favor to Guay, and that he had told her the package contained a statue. She was held on a charge of attempting suicide with the sleeping pills, and news of this was immediately broadcast. Guay, his plans for a birthday outing frustrated, was morosely having dinner at his mother-in-Iaw’s, where he had continued to live, when word of what Mrs. Pitre had told the police came over the radio. He stood up, banged his hand on the table, and shouted, “Damned slut!” Then he departed hastily, saying that he was going to his mother’s house, in Limoilou. At about the same time, the attorney general of the Province of Quebec issued a warrant for his arrest. He was picked up shortly after he reached his mother’s, and the following morning he was arraigned on a charge of murdering his wife. All his astonished mother-in-law could think to say when she heard the news was “He’s a boy with big dreams.”\n\nNow that the case was out in the open, the Canadian Pacific investigators, who felt they had carried things about as far as unofficial operatives could, turned the job of gathering supporting evidence over to Captain J. A. Matté, the chief of detectives of the Provincial Police. Noël Dorion, the Chief Crown Prosecutor of the Province, was assigned to handle the government’s case. Dorion is a short, squat, round man who looks like a Gallic version of Fiorello H. LaGuardia and has a courtroom manner that has earned him the nickname of Monsieur le Tornade. He is Quebec’s most celebrated criminal lawyer, and he already had twelve hangings to his credit.\n\nGuay was locked up in the Quebec Men’s Jail, on the Plains of Abraham. A stool pigeon was planted in his cell and presently reported that Guay had said Ruest had made the mechanism of a time bomb for him. The police at once went around to see Ruest, who admitted that he had made such a machine for Guay, and told them how, but insisted he had been under the impression that it was to be used to blast stumps. That evening, Captain Matté dropped in on a friend of his—Dr. Lucien Gravel, a professor of chemistry at Laval University, who lives across the street from him in Quebec. They had become acquainted some time before, when the detective expressed admiration for the professor’s garden. Matté now asked Gravel if, given an alarm clock, batteries, a fuse, and other simple equipment, it would be possible to construct a device that would set off dynamite. Gravel drew a diagram of how it might be done, and suggested that Matté really ought to use more fertilizer in his garden if he wanted it to flourish. A few days later, Matté asked Gravel to make a detonating device like the one in the diagram and demonstrate it in court at a preliminary hearing before a lower-court judge, who, in accordance with Canadian law, would decide whether the Crown had enough of a case to justify a trial in the Court of Assizes. Gravel demurred, saying that he thought it was a bad thing to show people the details of how to make bombs. Matté replied that this was no time for humanitarian scruples. Gravel shrugged his shoulders, made the device, and in court, on October 14th, with the Dean of Sciences at Laval present and crying out, “Don’t miss your shot, Dr. Gravel!,” the reluctant professor lighted a fuse with an alarm clock and a dry-cell battery. After this performance and the introduction of the evidence assembled against Guay, the judge declared the Crown had a case.\n\nThe Crown had established that a dynamite time bomb could have been used to blow up the plane; now it had to prove that it actually had been. Through the rest of that fall and halfway through the winter, detectives and scientists searched for and studied conceivably significant fragments of wreckage from the explosion. The Medico-Legal Laboratories of the province, in Montreal, made more than two thousand analyses—chemical, spectrographic, spectrophotometric, and X-ray—of various rags and tatters of clothing. “By the time we were finished we could even tell that someone on that plane was eating peanuts at the moment of the explosion,” Bernard Peclet, one of the laboratory scientists, said recently. After determining the chemical structure of deposits found on some of the bits of clothing, the scientists went out and bought similar clothes, packed them in suitcases, and blew them up with dynamite. This produced identical deposits. Then they used gasoline, black powder, white powder, and TNT to blow up other suitcases full of clothing. The results were different.\n\nSlow though his enthusiasm had been to kindle, Gravel was now rapidly developing into a zealous amateur detective. Hoping to find some indication of the presence of an alarm clock or a dry-cell battery, he went to the scene of the crash and crawled over it on his hands and knees. He came upon a metal plate torn from the bulkhead that separated the No. 1 baggage compartment from the cabin of the plane. There was a curious circular dent in the plate, which looked as if it had been caused by being struck by the metal top of a dry-cell battery, and it was splotched with bits of black and white stuff. The black was found by chemical analysis to be the residue of the paste inside a dry cell, and the white to be ashes resulting from the combustion of dynamite. Moreover, there were two small holes in the plate, and it was established that these could have been made by the passage through the metal, at high speed, of a wheel and a bell from an alarm clock.\n\nTwo more important clues turned up. One was the discovery, in the shoulder of a sweater caught in the branches of a tree several hundred feet from the main mass of wreckage, of two slivers of blue-enamelled metal. They proved to be fragments of a disc used on the seal of an Eveready No. 6 dry cell, a type of battery that was not part of the plane’s equipment. The other discovery was made in Ruest’s workshop, which Gravel and Peclet, the government-laboratory man, who had also been bitten by the bug of crime detection, searched together five months after the crash. On a dusty shelf, hidden behind a religious statue, they found a tiny triangular piece of cardboard with traces of copper, lead, and aluminum on it in exactly the proportions in which those elements are present in the copper wires that are attached to a popular type of Canadian-made detonator. In tidying up after their experimental detonation, Guay and Ruest had neglected to look behind the statue.\n\nGuay’s trial began on February 24, 1950. By then, he had become a celebrated figure. (The son of one of his Kennecott Copper victims had added to the furore by holding up a liquor store in Plainville, Massachusetts, while temporarily deranged, in order to obtain enough money to fly to Canada and try to kill him.) The trial lasted two and a half weeks, and was Quebec’s most exciting event since Roosevelt and Churchill conferred there in 1944. The weather was icy cold, the temperature dropping to twenty-five below zero for a time, but that didn’t prevent would-be spectators from lining up outside the old gray provincial courthouse, across the street from the Château Frontenac, hours before the doors were opened. (On the stone façade of the building, near the entrance, someone chalked a large broken heart, with “MARIE-ANGE” written across it.) Early, frostbitten arrivals sold their places in line to late-comers, at speculators’ prices. Americans staying at the Château gave up skiing to take in the show. Guay was tried by an all-male jury, since in Quebec the rights of women, like those of drunkards and the criminally insane, are circumscribed. He seemed unperturbed almost from start to finish, and dozed off at one point during the testimony, much of which was rather technical, since rarely has a court gone more thoroughly into the intricacies of what makes an airplane work, and what might make one cease to. Guay did not testify in his own defense. His only display of emotion came toward the end of the trial, when Marie-Ange took the stand and declared that she didn’t love him any more. That clearly hurt him. Guay was convicted on March 14th. The jury, which heard the case against him while seated under a twelve-foot-high white crucifix that conspicuously ornaments the courtroom, took a mere seventeen minutes to reach a verdict. The judge, sentencing him to hang, burst into tears and cried, “Your crime is infamous! It has no name!”\n\nGuay decided not to appeal—“for reasons known only to myself,” he said. It is widely believed in Quebec that his principal reason was that if he could not live with Marie-Ange, whom, according to Dorion, he had courted “tenaciously and assiduously,” he did not care to live at all. A good deal of effective testimony against him had been supplied by Mrs. Pitre and Ruest, and Guay now paid them back in kind. While being moved to the Montreal Jail, at Bordeaux, just outside Montreal, where capital sentences imposed in the province are executed, he dictated a long statement implicating the brother and sister in the crime; later, in the death house, he amplified it. A few days after Guay’s second bout of reminiscence, Ruest was arrested and charged with murder, as the willful manufacturer of the time bomb. “This man took into his own hands the prerogatives of the Creator by fixing the moment life was to be taken away from twenty-three people,” Dorion told the jury hearing Ruest’s case. The jury was impressed, and on January 3, 1951, declared him guilty. Nine days after that, Guay was hanged. He never got to see Marie-Ange again after she renounced him. Following his trial, she ran a lunch counter, called Au Petit Cœur, in Lower Town for a while, but it didn’t do well, and when last heard of she was working in a factory in Quebec that makes girls’ clothing.\n\nMrs. Pitre was charged with murder during Ruest’s trial. She got into all kinds of other difficulties with the law in connection with the case, and, at one point, she found herself simultaneously charged with murder, attempted suicide, perjury (this charge arose from a conflict in her testimony concerning Ruest during the Guay trial), and intimidating witnesses (during Ruest’s trial she was overheard telling one prospective witness against her brother, “Keep your mouth shut. I have struck before and I can strike again”). Mrs. Pitre seemed to feel she was being persecuted. In the course of one of the many set-tos she had with Dorion in court, she said, “You are mixing me all up. The police and you are always after me.” “I would rather say society is after you,” Dorion replied.\n\nSociety never got around to passing judgment on the perjury and intimidation charges against Mrs. Pitre, but two months after convicting her brother it convicted her of murder and, in passing, acquitted her of attempting suicide. On being asked by the court if she had anything to say when sentence was about to be passed upon her, she unhesitatingly compared herself to Jesus Christ and the judge to Pontius Pilate.\n\nBoth Ruest and Mrs. Pitre appealed their convictions, first to the provincial Court of Appeal and then to the Supreme Court of Canada. The appeals were denied, and the brother and sister were hanged, he on July 25, 1952, and she on January 9th of this year. A few days after Mrs. Pitre was executed, the Canadian Pacific Railway, which for nearly three and a half years had cautiously watched over the remains of its crumpled plane, decided that the case was closed and had the wreckage shipped to a scrap heap. In a sense, though, the case may not be closed even yet. In at least two other parts of the world, people have tried to emulate Guay since he went to the gallows. In Los Angeles, in April, 1951, a technician employed in an airplane-parts factory insured the lives of his wife and two children and then attempted to put a suitcase containing a homemade gasoline bomb on a plane they were boarding. A clumsy cargo handler dropped the suitcase, and it harmlessly burst into flames on the ground. More recently, the scheme has been tried twice in Mexico. The first time, the bomb went off in midair but caused only minor damage, and the plane kept flying. The second time, the package containing the bomb was put on the wrong plane, which flew uneventfully to its destination. There the bomb exploded on the ground, killing three airport employees who hadn’t been planning to fly anywhere at all. Guay’s kind of murder is very indiscriminate. ♦"
