        "text": "Over the past few weeks, One Life to Live fans have been watching the story unfold and masterfully written as Rex Balsom is faced with a horrific decision.. to give his father, Clint Buchanan, the man he hates the most in this world, the heart of his beloved Gigi Morasco, who lies brain-dead in the hospital, thanks to the skullduggery of Jack Manning. As Rex struggled with the decision and yet was defiant at the same time that he would not allow Clint to have his much-needed heart transplant, he came to realize that he had no money and no power to fight the Mannings, once Todd got Jack off the hook for Gigi’s death. So he had to come up with a plan.\n\nFans have watched as John-Paul Lavoisier gave great performance after great performance, and truly the finest moments of his soap opera acting career. He made all of us at home, just want to reach out to Rex and give him a hug! JP’s Rex valiantly tries to hold it together for his son, Shane, while at the time crumbling with the unfathomable loss of the woman he was about to marry.\n\nBut it was on yesterday’s episode that he made us all grab for the hankies as we witnessed the sad ending of the long-storied romance of Rex and Gigi. JP Lavoisier was magnificent as he had to say goodbye to the woman he loves as it was time for her to be taken into surgery to remove her heart and give it to Clint. For this, On-Air On-Soaps has named John-Paul Lavoisier this week’s Power Performance of the Week. And we also applaud everyone else in this storyline – namely, Austin Williams as Shane for his heartbreaking final scenes with his mother, and Farah Fath as Gigi for the beautiful moments where she dances with Rex as closure for the duo. And we would be remiss without mentioning the fantastic Jerry verDorn, who has made Clint through all of his heinous acts someone we don’t want to see kick the bucket, either!\n\nKudos to OLTL for soap opera at its best, and to you, Mr. Lavoisier! Watch the heart-tugging moments and this week’s Power Performance here!\n\nIt was 35 years ago on this day, August 20th, 1989, that Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents Kitty and Jose Menendez in their home in Beverly Hills.\n\nNow on August 20th, 2024, the highly-anticipated limited series Monsters season two from Ryan Murphy, unveils the premiere date for the story centering around the brothers and the murder case along with its first trailer.\n\nGeneral Hospital fans are extremely excited and intrigued for the upcoming series, and to see Nicholas Chavez (ex-Spencer Cassadine) in one of the leading roles as Lyle Menendez.\n\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story drops on Netflix beginning on September 19th. Chavez took to his Instagram account and posted the trailer accompanied by his words in the post, “So excited holy heck!”\n\nSeptember will be a busy month for Chavez fans as not only can he be seen on Monsters, but also as previously revealed, Nicholas is part of the cast of another Ryan Murphy series, Grotesquerie in which he plays Father Charlie. The horror drama will air on Wednesdays starting September 25 on FX and then the next day on Hulu.\n\nChavez finished his three-year run as GH’s Spencer Cassadine back at the beginning of 2024 when on-screen the character went overboard while trying to save the love of his life Trina (Tabyana Ali) and is presumed dead.\n\nIn ‘Monsters,’ the series delves into how the Menendez Brothers, who were aged 21 and 18 when they committed the crime. claimed they acted in self-defense, after years of physical and sexual abuse. However, the prosecution argued that their motive was greed and the desire to inherit their parents’ fortune. The trials lasted for months and the brothers were charged for their actions. They are currently at the R J Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.\n\nAlong with Chavez, the cast includes: Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny as parents Jose and Kitty Menendez, and Cooper Koch as Erik Menendez. The series also stars: Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne, Ari Graynor as Leslie Abramson, Leslie Grossman as Judalon Smyth, Dallas Roberts as Dr. Jerome Oziel, Jason Butler Harner as Les Zoeller, Enrique Murciano as Carlos Baralt, Michael Gladis as Tim Rutten, Drew Powell as Detective Tom Linehan, Charlie Hall as Craig Cignarelli, Gil Ozeri as Dr. William Vicary, Jeff Perry as Peter Hoffman, Tessa Auberjonois as Dr. Laurel Oziel, Tanner Stine as Perry Berman, Larry Clarke as Brian Andersen, Jade Pettyjohn as Jamie Pisarcik, and Marlene Forte as Marta Cano.\n\nYou can check out the official trailer/date announcement for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story below.\n\nNow let us know, if you are excited to finally see Nicholas Chavez in his starring role via the comment section.\n\nOn Monday, during a press conference held by Los Angeles County prosecutors, two of the four suspects in the death of Johnny Wactor (ex-Brando Corbin) have now been officially charged with the murder of the beloved General Hospital actor.\n\nThe charges were announced by L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Barceleau, Estrada and Gutierrez remain in custody in lieu of $2 million bail each, while Olano must post a $1 million bail.\n\nWactor was killed May 25 in the early morning hours in downtown Los Angeles after his shift as a bartender at the Level 8 bar/restaurant. He, and co-worker, Anita Joy were walking to their cars, when Wactor came upon the thieves trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle and was shot in the chest and died in Joy’s arms.\n\nNow that Johnny’s murderers have been charged, share your thoughts via the comment section below.
