        "text": "It’s a pity I didn’t take more notice of John-Paul Lavoisier when I was still watching ABC’s One Life to Live.\n\nThis 30-year-old blond beauty plays Rex Balsom on the show and from the looks of the pics I found on the Internet, he’s shirtless a lot.\n\nI’d like to check him out sometime but I have not forgiven the show for what it did to its gay characters earlier this year, just jettisoning off Kyle and Oliver and Nick in one fell swoop because of a ratings drop.\n\nBut anyway, back to John-Paul since this is about him. He’s been on the show since 2002 but also has stage chops. He is a member of the advisory board of the theater production company Streetlight Productions, Inc, and has performed in various off-Broadway plays including Discordant Duets and Counterfeit Garden.\n\nJohn-Paul has also had guest roles on Gossip Girl and Sex and the City and appeared in the film Wolves of Wall Street."
