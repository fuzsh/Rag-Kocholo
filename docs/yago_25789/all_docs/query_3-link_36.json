        "text": "Let me start this off by listing the kind of women I pursued in the past:\n\n. Smokin' body and all around hottie\n\n. Large bank account or able to sponge off rich parents\n\n. Willing to lend (without actually expecting payback) large amounts of cash\n\n. Generous (read: likely to shower me with expensive gifts)\n\n. Loves to party (after a few drinks we can rent a room at the Palace Hotel, charged to your credit card)\n\n. Loyal (will defend me to those that say I'm a sleazy opportunist)\n\nJen was that complete package. At first it was lust, which turned to love. Not sure how that happened. I realized that she was more than a meal ticket. I started to view the world in a different way. After Jen's death, I had to take a look at myself and reflect on the past. I want to change. This means that I will eventually have to move on.\n\nSo, when I'm ready to open my heart again, this is what I'd look for in a romantic partner:\n\n. Someone who doesn't know about my past or will not judge me for it\n\n. A sense of humor (willing to be silly, laugh and goof off)\n\n. Age is not a factor. Anywhere between 18 to 40-something would be okay.\n\n. Attractive (Hey, there has to be chemistry!)\n\n. Adventurous\n\n. Beautiful smile\n\n. Kindness\n\n. Able to accept me for who I am, as well as my strange family\n\nThere's really no definitive list, however. I'd be content to meet someone who can make me smile and forget about the past for a while.\n\nCrossposted to: theatrical_muse\n\nFrom: _ohgreatone\n\n2005-07-05 10:37 pm (UTC)\n\n*snickers*\n\nFrom: rex_balsom\n\n2005-07-06 02:31 am (UTC)\n\n*glares* Okay humor me, why are you laughing?\n\nFrom: _ohgreatone\n\n2005-07-06 02:35 am (UTC)\n\nYou made a little list.
