        "text": "One Life to Live hasn’t wasted any time replacing Nathaniel Martson. It’s time to meet the new Michael McBain, fans:\n\nChris Stack.\n\nYou probably don’t recall, but Stack actually appeared in an episode of One Life to Live in 2003, portraying the character Brad White, a man who went to the same school as Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier), Jennifer Rappaport (Jessica Morris) and Marcie Walsh (Kathy Brier).\n\nThe actor also played a role in three As the World Turns episodes in 2006.\n\nLook for Stack to premiere on December 3, as he had the following to say about the unfortunate way he’s earned the gig:\n\n“This is a bittersweet way to get a job. I remember Nathaniel very fondly and was sorry to hear of the circumstances that led to my hiring. At the same time, it’s my hiring. I’m really thrilled to have a job.”"
