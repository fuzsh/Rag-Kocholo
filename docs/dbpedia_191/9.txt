Dothideomycetes is the largest and most diverse class of fungi (Kirk et al. 2008; Schoch et al. 2009a, b; Hyde et al. 2013), comprising 32 orders, 191 families, 1495 genera (242 genera incertae sedis) and over 19,000 known species (Kirk et al. 2008; Schoch et al. 2009a, b). The class largely corresponds to what has been circumscribed earlier as Ascoloculares (Nannfeldt 1932), “Bitunicatae” (Luttrell 1951), Loculoascomycetes (Luttrell 1955), and Loculoascomycetidae (Luttrell 1955). The name Loculoascomycetes was originally suggested for all fungi with ascolocular development (Ainsworth 1966), referring to the formation of asci in locules (Nannfeldt 1932; Luttrell 1955). Dothideomycetes typically produce flask-like structures called pseudothecia, though other different shapes exist (e.g. the hysterothecial and apothecial shape in Hysteriales) (Bisby 1923; Valenzuela‐Lopez et al. 2019). The ascolocular development begins with the accumulation of somatic hyphae into an ascostroma, which subsequently forms locules which are finally surrounded by generative hyphae that develop into asci. This process results in the development of an ascocarp that often appears as apothecioid, perithecioid or cleistotheciod (Hessen and Jahns, 1973) (Fig. 1). It is difficult to distinguish the flask, sphaerical or disk-shaped fruiting bodies of Dothideomycetes from other groups of Ascomycota, but they are defined by a unique pattern of development (Schoch et al. 2006) (Fig. 2). The bitunicate or double-layered ascus is one of the significant delineating character in dothideomycete taxonomy (Von Arx and Müller 1975). Bitunicate asci comprise a thick extensible inner layer known as endotunica and a thin inextensible outer layer known as an ectotunica (Damm et al. 2008). Most bitunicate asci release ascospores by extending the inner ascus wall through a split of the outer wall, known as a ‘jack-in-the-box’ or fissitunicate mechanism, but variations exist (Zhang et al. 2012) (Figs. 3, 4). Another significant character is the centrum which includes the tissues and cells subjugating the cavity of the sexual structure (Hongsanan et al. 2020a, b). The type of hamathecium, the sterile hyphae present between the asci, is the most consistent character used to demarcate ordinal classifications within Dothideomycetes (Yacharoen et al. 2015). Asexual reproduction is frequent and involves the production of branched or unbranched conidiophores that release haploid conidiospores (Fig. 5). The development of conidia is commonly seen among pathogenic genera such as Camarosporidiellaceae, Cladosporiaceae, Coniothyriaceae, Pleosporaceae, Microsphaeropsidaceae, Mycosphaerellaceae and Tubeufiaceae, which comprise a great amount of only anamorphic species (Hyde et al. 2013; Wanasinghe et al. 2018; Hongsanan et al. 2020a, b). The conidiophores are usually solitary or in groups developing into an elongated spore-bearing structure or synnema, plural synnemata (Guarro et al. 1999; Thambugala et al. 2017). In other groups, the conidia are formed inside flask-shaped structures called pycnidia or acervuli, lined with conidiophores, such as in the families Lophiostomataceae, Melanommataceae amongst others (Thambugala et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2015). Conidia and conidiophores may also be borne around sporodochia such as in Thyrostroma (Pem et al. 2019d; Senwanna et al. 2019). Some species also produce chlamydospores (Pem et al. 2018; Jones et al. 2019a, b).

The objectives of this paper are: (1) discuss the ecology and taxonomic history of the class Dothideomycetes; (2) debate the taxonomic importance and biases of morphology-based studies; (3) assess the applicability and utility of existing species recognition criteria for defining species boundaries, and (4) critically assess the problems and challenges that have been encountered to date. We also provide a set of guidelines for classifying species especially at higher taxonomic level.

Ecology and distribution

It is believed that fungi facilitated the evolution of early terrestrial ecosystems, by aiding plants to acquire nutrients, playing a significant role in plant’s colonization of the land (Vincent et al. 2020). Dothideomycetes are cosmopolitan in distribution and occur in a wide variety of environments including terrestrial, freshwater, marine and extreme environments (Suetrong et al. 2009; Hyde et al. 2013; Egidi et al. 2019; Dayarathne et al. 2020). Terrestrial fungi occur on or in a variety of substrata, from soil to rocks and on/in plants and animals (Verkley et al. 2004; Trakunyingcharoen et al. 2014; Taylor and Sinsabaugh 2015; Egidi et al. 2019). Soil fungi, for example, Ascochyta, Calophoma, Didymocyrtis, Paraboeremia, and Parathyridaria, play fundamental roles in the ecosystem processes, such as carbon and nitrogen cycles and nutrient uses in terrestrial ecosystem (Das et al. 2019; Hou et al. 2020). Rock-inhabiting fungi (e.g., Catenulomyces, Constantinomyces) can resist extreme circumstances on rock surfaces (Ruibal et al. 2009).

Rock-inhabiting fungi are slow-growing, characterized by asexual morphs with meristematic or micro colonial growth and usually have melanin in the cell wall (Egidi et al. 2014, 2019). In Dothideomycetes, rock-inhabiting taxa occur in at least three different orders, namely Dothideales, Capnodiales, and Pleosporales (Sterflinger et al. 1999; Selbmann et al. 2013; Ruibal et al. 2009), mainly in the genera Hortaea, Coniosporium, Capnobotryella, Pseudotaeniolina, and Trimmatostroma (Sterflinger 2010; Onofri et al. 2012, 2014). However, many lineages need to be discovered. Some taxa occur in freshwater (e.g., Aquimassariosphaeria, Aquatospora, Aquihelicascus, Fusiformiseptata, Jahnula, Neohelicascus, Neojahnula, Pseudojahnula) or marine (e.g., Halomassarina, Testudina, Manglicola) environments (Hongsanan et al. 2020a, b; Dong et al. 2020). Aquatic Dothideomycetes are found in or on marine algae, sea weeds, and decaying wood, but most commonly in intertidal areas and mangroves where they play significant role in breakdown of cellulose and can cause diseases of plants and animals (Hyde et al. 1998; Wong et al. 1998; Suetrong et al. 2009; Dong et al. 2020). Most aquatic species possess abundant pseudoparaphyses embedded in a gelatinous matrix to safeguard them from dehydration during dry conditions (Suetrong et al. 2009). Aquatic Dothideomycetes are distributed all over the class including Pleosporomycetidae, Dothideomycetidae or the uncertain family Minutisphaeraceae, Acrogenosporaceae and the order Patellariales (Shearer et al. 2009), but numerous aquatic lineages remain to be explored according to recent phylogenetic analyses (Shearer et al. 2009; Suetrong et al. 2009; Dong et al. 2020). The order Jahnulales comprises two families, Aliquandostipitaceae and Manglicolaceae, which are only freshwater taxa, but it has been speculated that marine species may also occur in this group (Suetrong et al. 2010, 2011).

Many Dothideomycetes survive in extreme environmental conditions. For example, the extremely halotolerant black, yeast-like fungus Hortaea werneckii is tolerant of extreme temperatures, solar radiation, aridity and has attracted attention in studies on bioremediation, effect of ionizing radiations in polluted areas, and biodeterioration of materials, amongst others (Cabañes et al. 2012; Zalar et al. 2019). Some genera such as Baudoinia and Zasmidium are tolerant to ethanol vapour that forms in the vicinity of distillery aging warehouses and commercial bakeries (Ewaze et al. 2008; Kong et al. 2014). Dothideomycetes also exhibit a range of other lifestyles, including saprotrophs, plant pathogens, mycoparasites, and lichenized and lichenicolous fungi. Saprobic Dothideomycetes are frequently reported from woody debris, decaying leaves or dung, or in more extreme environments (Pem et al. 2018, 2019a, b; Senwanna et al. 2019; Doilom et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018; Jayasiri et al. 2019; Hyde et al. 2020; Huanraluek et al. 2020). Many Dothideomycetes occur as pathogens or parasites causing diseases to their hosts (Hofmann and Piepenbring 2014; Crous et al. 2007; Wikee et al. 2011, 2013; Manamgoda et al. 2012a; Hyde et al. 2018; Jayawardena et al. 2019).

Several basal lineages of Dothideomycetes have evolved as insect-pathogenic lineages. These include species on scale insect, such as in the genera Alternaria and Myriangium (Christias et al. 2001; Araújo et al. 2018). Dothideomycetes have also been reported as pathogens of humans and animals, such as Neodactylaria causing infection of human bronchoalveolar lavage (Crous et al. 2017a, b), Endosporium causing mycotic diseases in humans (Tsuneda et al. 2008), Piedraia on hair (Sharma et al. 2021). Some are allergens, such as species of Alternaria, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Epicoccum, and Stemphylium (Gabriel et al. 2016; Bensch et al. 2018).

Dothideomycetes comprise a variety of non-pathogenic life styles, most of which have evolved several times (Trillas and Segarra 2009; Eydoux and Farrer 2020). Dothideomycetes have significant roles as endophytes (e.g., Curvularia, Plenodomus, Phyllosticta, Spissiomyces), ectophytes (e.g., Asterina, Ramichloridium), and epiphytes (sooty molds) (e.g., Antennulariella, Capnodium) (Kirschner 2009; Chomnunti et al. 2014; Nair and Padmavathy 2014; Hongsanan et al. 2014a, b; Suwannarach et al. 2018; Haridas et al. 2020). Epiphytic, ectophytic and endophytic members play critical roles in plant development by protecting the host from stress conditions and supplying biofertilizers, phytostimulators and biopesticides through production of chemical compounds (Yao et al. 2019). Notably, only one species in the class Dothideomycetes have mycorrhizal associations, in the genus Cenococcum (de Freitas Pereira et al. 2018), being commonly found in xeric environments. Dothideomycetes also occur on other fungi as mycoparasites (e.g., Sphaerellopsis, Paraconiothyrium) and endure extreme stress conditions (Gordon and Pfender 2012; Trakunyingcharoen et al. 2014; Dao et al. 2016). Mycoparasites have a significant role for biocontrol of plant pathogens and contribute to the release of nutrients from dead fungal biomass through the action of chitinase (Sun et al. 2015). Few Dothideomycetes lineages are lichenized or lichenicolous, concentrated among the orders Capnodiales, Eremithallales, Monoblastiales, Strigulales, and Trypetheliales (Nelsen et al. 2009; Lücking et al. 2017). Around 800 species of Dothideomycetes are lichen-forming, and 266 represent lichenicolous fungi (Lücking et al. 2017; Lawrey and Diederich 2003; Diederich et al. 2018). Lichenized forms fungi (e.g., Anisomeridium, Astrothelium, Racodium, Strigula, Trypethelium) live in a symbiotic association with a photosynthetic alga (Tripathi and Joshi 2019). Lichenicolous fungi (e.g. Zwackhiomyces) reside on the thalli or ascomata of lichenized fungi and are highly specific to their hosts, acting as commensals or mycoparasites or phycoparasites). For example, Lichenoconium (L. usneae) is parasitic on ascomata of Abrothallus (A. usneae) (Diederich and Christianse 1994; Lawrey and Diederich 2003). Numerous lichenicolous Phoma species were reported in the Phaeosphaeriaceae (Lawrey et al. 2012). These taxa indicate that unexplored environments can harbour many more undescribed Dothideomycetes.

Brief history of the classification of Dothideomycetes

Traditionally, ascomycete classification was largely based on morphological characters such as shape and position of ascoma, ascus, arrangement and septation of ascospores, and structure and organization of the centrum (Table 1). The order Ascoloculares was established by Nannfeldt (1932) based on asci forming in cavities in a preformed stroma. The first taxonomic publication of the group now recognized as Dothideomycetes is attributed to Fries (1818a, b) who published the genus Dothidea but without designation of a type species. Theissen and Sydow (1915) reviewed the nomenclatural status of Dothidea and provided an ineffective typification of Dothidea, with Dothidea caespitosa and effective typification with Dothidea moriformis but none of them was followed by other authors. Later, Clements and Shear (The Genera of Fungi. 1931) suggested another lectotypification which was also incorrect because D. sambuci was not among the species originally included by Fries. Desmazieres (1843) provided the first descriptions of a distinctive bitunicate ascus and De Bary (1887) reviewed asci structure and the fissitunicate action of ascospore discharge, termed as ‘jack in the box’ mechanism. Fuckel (1870) considered the formation of the ascoma as a significant character when they adopted the family name Dothideaceae to accomodate taxa characterized by the formation of asci in locules within a stroma instead of a true perithecial wall. Subsequently, Lindau (1897) maintained the family Dothideaceae and introduced a new order Dothideales. Few years later, von Höhnel (1909) expanded Lindau’s concept to accommodate species with monascous and polyascous locules and provided the first description of the group that somewhat approximated the modern class Dothideomycetes. Nannfeldt (1932) rejected Dothideales and placed the ascolocular members of this group in Pseudosphaeriales and Hemisphaeriales and highlighted the significance of ascomatal development and its relationship with ascus characters. Santesson (1952) included a distinct arrangement of lichenized fungi in a combined classification and classified members of Arthoniomycetes with other nonlichenized bitunicate taxa. Reynolds (1991) concluded that the loculoascomycetes are not monophyletic by carrying out an extensive analysis on lichenized taxa representing main ascostromatic and fissitunicate families such as Opegraphaceae and Trypetheliaceae. Berbee and Taylor (1992a, b) divided the fungi into two groups and correlated the class Dothideomycetes (at that time known as Loculoascomycetes) based on fruiting-body type and ribosomal DNA sequence data. Luttrell (1955) officially described Loculoascomycetes, which comprised mainly bitunicate taxa formerly classified in Pyrenomycetes. These taxonomies became unstable with the increasing information of the morphological multiplicity of these taxa. For instance, bitunicate asci were shown to exist in lichen-forming taxa, which has an ascohymenial type of ascoma development, such as Arthoniales, Pyrenulales, and Verrucariales (Doppelbaur 1960; Hessen and Jahns 1973). The concern of morphological characterization of these classes became even more complex, after species with bitunicate asci and ascohymenial ascoma development, such as Pyrenulales and Verrucariales have been shown to belong to Eurotiomycetes (Lumbsch et al. 2004; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007). It is unclear which morphological characters can differentiate between Dothideomycetes and some other classes such as Arthoniomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and due to lack of molecular data many families are currently listed as Dothideomycetes incertae sedis. Eriksson and Winka (1997) formally described 21 supraordinal taxa and established the class Dothideomycetes in their journal Systema Ascomycetum. Other significant works that have influenced dothideomycete taxonomy in the twenty-first century are those of Ainsworth and Bisby’s Dictionary of the Fungi (9th edn: Kirk et al. 2001), the Mycota VII (McLaughlin et al. 2001; Knudsen and Rosendahl 2002) (see Barr and Huhndorf (2001) and Hawksworth (1985) for further detailed taxonomic history). Several phylogenetic studies using nuSSU rDNA sequences supported three main characters (ascoma-type, ascoma development, ascus-type) used to separate main clades in ascomycetes, but these characters were reported to be homoplasious (Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007). Tehler et al. (2000, 2003) performed phylogenetic analyses using nuSSU rDNA sequence data and showed that the single gene dataset is inadequate to determine higher-level relationships of euascomycete clades. Eventually, other genes such as nuLSU, mtSSU and RPB2 were sequenced and used in single and combined analyses (Lumbsch 2000, Lumbsch et al. 2002, 2004; Lutzoni et al. 2001, 2004). Schoch et al. (2006) demonstrated that Dothideomycetes is a monophyletic group and divided the class into two subclasses Dothideomycetidae (pseudoparaphyses absent) and Pleosporomycetidae (pseudoparaphyses present) using multigene analysis, incorporating protein sequence data. McLaughlin et al. (2009) emphasized the poorly resolved nodes in the DNA-based phylogeny in the class Dothideomycetes. With time, new barcoding projects started to emerge using more taxon sampling and Schoch et al. (2009a, b) provided a broad phylogeny at class and lower taxonomic levels for Dothideomycetes. With the advances in molecular techniques and increased accessibility to fossil calibration data, some studies incorporated molecular clock approaches to establish the divergence estimates for the orders and families of the class Dothideomycetes (Liu et al. 2017; Prieto and Wedin 2013; Hongsanan et al. 2020a, b). Mapook et al. (2016) used it to support the introduction of the new family Palawaniaceae, while Phookamsak et al. (2016) provided further evidence for the introduction of the family Longipedicellataceae using divergence times. Liu et al. (2017) provided a case study in the class Dothideomycetes using divergence times estimates and consequently, Liu et al. (2018) used it to introduce the new Pleosporalean family Lentimurisporaceae. Recently, Bhunjun et al. (2021) provided evidence for the establishment of the new family Anastomitrabeculiaceae using divergence time estimates. Abdollahzadeh et al. (2020) introduced five new orders in Capnodiales with Cladosporiales, Comminutisporales, Neophaeothecales, Phaeothecales and Racodiales in Capnodiales s. str and concluded that Capnodiales s. lat. is polyphyletic. Many classification systems in the class Dothideomycetes comprise non-monophyletic taxa, and many species are synonyms, suggesting revisions and highlights the need for continuous updates in morphological as well as phylogenetic reconstructions within the class Dothideomycetes (Shearer et al. 2009; Suetrong et al. 2009; Jayasiri et al. 2018; Hyde et al. 2019a, b; Hongsanan et al. 2020a, b).

Application of species recognition criteria in the class Dothideomycetes

Species is one of the basic units of biological classification (Sharma et al. 2015; Jeewon and Hyde 2016; Peintner et al. 2019). Different species recognition criteria were introduced by mycologists to define and delineate species in Dothideomycetes, including morphological, biological, ecological and phylogenetic criteria (Harrington and Rizzo 1999; Wang et al. 2007; Liu et al 2010, 2016; Cai et al. 2011; Jayasiri et al. 2019). The definitions and the criteria for species delimitation are discussed in Chethana et al. (2021). In this section, we are going to briefly assess the application of these criteria in Dothideomycetes and how they developed over time using specific examples.

The concept of species in biology began with Linnaeus (1758) who believed that species were stable entities (Mayr 1957). The early proponent of the Morphological species criterion (MSC) is Cronquist (1978) but was first introduced in the fungal taxonomy by Lindau (1897) who attempted to classify ascomycetes, mainly based on gross morphological characters where he proposed three types of ascocarps a) Cleistothecium, b) Perithecium and c) Apothecium. The most commonly used criteria for any fungal lineage has long been the morphological species recognition (Zhang et al. 2008; Cai et al. 2011; Hyde et al. 2013; Wanasinghe et al. 2017a, b). This criterion has been applied to sexual and asexual taxa and fossil records in Dothideomycetes (Cronquist 1978). For example, a fossil from British Columbia known as Margaretbarromyces dictyosporus, a species belonging to Pleosporales, was identified based on morphological criteria (Mindell et al. 2007). Similarly, Chitaley and Patil (1972) identified a fungus morphologically similar to the extant genus Phoma from the Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene Deccan Intertrappean beds of India. Le Renard et al. (2020) reported scutellum characters of a fly-speck fungus from the Early Cretaceous Potomac Group of Virginia (125–112 Ma) similar to those of extant Aulographaceae (Dothideomycetes), using morphological species recognition. Previously many books, monographs and protologues have used morphology alone to describe and illustrate new species, separate families, genera, and existing species (Saccardo 1883; Fuckel 1872; Spegazzini 1881; Boerema et al. 1996). ‘A Century of Mycology’ (Sutton 1996), ‘Dematiaceous Hyphomycetes’ (Ellis 1971), ‘Marine Mycology’, ‘the Higher Fungi’ (Kohlmeyer 1969), ‘A Re-evaluation of the Bitunicate Ascomycetes with Keys to Families and Genera’ (von Arx and Müller 1975) and ‘Modern Mycology’ (Deacon 1997) are conventional manuscripts published using morphology alone. However, morphological species recognition also causes overestimation or underestimation of species numbers in Dothideomycetes. Furthermore, endophytic, epiphytic and parasitic dothideomycete species are underestimated in significant low numbers (Hawksworth 1991; Blackwell 2011). This is because morphological characteristics are subjective, depends on the ‘expert’ views to determine key characters and sometimes morphologically indistinguishable as in species of Lophiostoma, Lophiotrema and Massarina (Zhang et al. 2008). Furthermore, the simple morphology of fungi sometimes limits the number of potential characters available (e.g., Xiliomyces lacks a well-defined morphology; Kiskunsagia is characterized only by yellow to white aerial mycelium; Constantinomyces has only hyphal morphology (Harrington and Rizzo 1999; Egidi et al. 2014; Bezerra et al. 2017; Crous et al. 2019). In Dothideomycetes, morphometric characters such as spore size are often used to define species despite being highly criticized as these can be influenced by environmental factors as seen in Cladosporium (Bensch et al. 2012) or culture conditions (Vinayaka et al. 2016; Muggia et al. 2016). Even though morphological criteria are subjective, they represent a powerful and often the only available tool. The more evidence or differences in characters we provide to delimit a taxon, the more chance it has to be accepted by taxonomists. Hence, careful consideration should be given to the morphological criteria, which can subsequently be strengthened with other available data.

In 1686, John Ray familiarized the biological concept that species were differentiated by constantly producing the same species even though significant difference was possible within a species. This concept was first mentioned in loculoascomycetes taxonomy by Von Arx and Muller (1975) where he considered the biological characters to provide keys to families in two suborders Dothideineae and Pseudosphaeriineae. Studies on biological species recognition in the class Dothideomycetes is scarce but should not be neglected. It has been successfully applied to legume-associated Ascochyta and Phoma species (Kim and Chen 2019). The use of biological species recognition is problematic in asexual genera such as Alternaria, Bipolaris, Embellisia, as they do not produce sexual spores in nature or culture but, it can be assessed molecularly by checking for past recombination events (Ware 2006; Cai et al. 2011; Manamgoda et al. 2012b; Stewart et al. 2013; Bhunjun et al. 2021). Biological criteria can be considered and in cases where mycelium compatibility tests are not available, the biological species criteria can be indirectly assessed through molecular markers.

Valen (1976) first provided an account on the ecological species concept stating that a species is a lineage sharing a niche containing same biotic and abiotic interacting factors and this concept was first used in the loculoascomycetes by von Arx and Müller (1975) to provide family keys where they classified the sooty molds with ostiolate ascomata in a single family Capnodiaceae. The ecological species criterion has also been used to distinguish species in the class Dothideomycetes. Most studies have incorporated ecological data together with morphological and phylogenetic data (Domsch et al. 2007; Suetrong et al. 2009; Quaedvlieg et al. 2014). In the case of Dissoconium species, the ecological criteria and ecological distinctiveness from other members of the Capnodiales were powerful in the establishment of the new family Dissoconiaceae to accommodate this group (Crous et al. 2009a).

The phylogenetic species concept initially proposed by Cracraft (1982), was first applied to the loculoascomycetes by Reynolds (1991) who used parsimony and character compatibility methods on a morphological data matrix signifying major ascostromatic and fissitunicate families such as Opegraphaceae and Trypetheliaceae and orders using 30 characters but could not find much support for the monophyly of these taxa. Since then, species identification in the Loculoascomycetes as defined by Luttrell (1951, 1955) incorporated molecular data (Berbee 1996; Lindemuth et al. 2001; Liu et al. 1999; Lumbsch 2000; Lutzoni et al. 2001, 2004; Silva-Hanlin and Hanlin 1999; Spatafora et al. 1995; Untereiner 1995; Winka et al. 1998; Winka 2000). The phylogenetic species recognition criteria have been used in most modern Dothideomycetes studies to define species boundaries (Ariyawansa et al. 2015a, b; Videira et al. 2017; Wanasinghe et al. 2017a, b; Senwanna et al. 2019). Several families in Dothideomycetes (e. g., Camarosporidiellaceae, Dothidotthiaceae, Pleosporaceae, Mycosphaerellaceae) include only anamorphic species (Ariyawansa et al. 2015a, b; Videira et al. 2017; Wanasinghe et al. 2017a, b; Senwanna et al. 2019). Most anamorphs produce asexual spores or conidia and have limited morphological characters (e.g., Alternaria, Phoma) (Guarro et al. 1999; Aveskamp et al. 2008; Levetin et al. 2015). Hence, molecular data, specifically DNA sequences, are useful for species definition (Stielow et al. 2015; Stajich 2017; Leitch et al. 2018). The phylogenetic species recognition has been responsible for the discovery of a number of previously unrecognized cryptic species in recent years in Dothideomycetes (Damm et al. 2010; Aveskamp et al. 2010; Summerell et al. 2010). Recent changes in the taxonomy of some coniothyrium-like and camarosporium-like taxa are amongst the examples (Wijayawardene et al. 2017; Wanasinghe et al. 2017a, b). Consequently, the phylogenetic species recognition is one of the core methods for recognizing dothideomycete species. In most of the recent taxonomic studies, a polyphasic approach has been favoured, combining morphological, ecological and phylogenetic criteria wherever possible (Cruywagen et al. 2017; Crous et al. 2013). In the following section, we will discuss this further using selected examples from Dothideomycetes.

Development of species criteria in some Dothideomycetes genera—examples from Ascochyta, Cercospora and Neofusiccocum

Previous incongruent and unstable classification based on subjective and changing concepts have led to some confusion among mycologists. The taxonomic histories of Ascochyta, Cercospora and Neofusiccocum are used as examples to show how concepts and criteria used to delimit and identify species have changed. Through these examples we compare the different species criteria and show which one provides a better discrimination for demarcating species in each case.

Ascochyta

The history of the taxonomy of Ascochyta has been unstable. In the first century after the genus was established, over 200 species were defined based on shapes of the ascoma and spore and host association (Libert 1830). Currently, over 700 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (2021a, b). The instability in Ascochyta classification has resulted from the lack of clear morphological characters to define species (De Gruyter et al. 2009; Aveskamp et al. 2010; Valenzuela‐Lopez et al. 2019). Previously, Ascochyta classification was based only on the morphological species criterion. During the 1990’s, the practical criterion for delimitation of species in Ascochyta was the ratio of septate conidia produced on artificial medium and Ascochyta produced mainly septate conidia both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 6) (Boerema and Bollen 1975; Onfroy et al. 1999; Rai 2000). Chilvers et al. (2009) used the biological species criterion and induced the sexual morph of Ascochyta under laboratory conditions through a heterothallic mating system. Several studies on the genus Ascochyta have shown that the phylogenetic species criterion and biological species criterion lead to congruent results (Faris-Mokaiesh et al. 1996; Woudenberg et al. 2012). Different lineages recognized by the phylogenetic species criterion may act as a diagnostic tool to identify morphological or ecological differences among Ascochyta taxa, which may not be obviously visible (Cai et al. 2011). The most frequently used gene for species recognition and phylogenetic analysis in Ascochyta is the β-tubulin gene. Other useful loci include the translation elongation factor 1 α gene (EF-1α) (Peever et al. 2007). LSU sequences are least successful in resolving species, followed by ITS (Chen et al. 2015). All Ascochyta species have nearly identical ITS sequences (Peever et al. 2007) while translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF) and β-tubulin (tub2) genes proved to be more suitable for the resolution of species (Peever et al. 2007; Aveskamp et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015). An example of the benefits of contemporary phylogenetic species criterion based systematics in Ascochyta can be seen in Ascochyta blight and pod spot (Bretag et al. 2006; Gossen et al. 2011), a disease occurring in legume tribes all over the world. Peever et al. (2007) used the phylogenetic species criterion based on ITS sequences and three protein-coding genes of Ascochyta species on Leguminosae. Multiple gene sequence analyses enabled discovery of a diversity of taxa, leading to the identification of different species of Ascochyta (Padder et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2016). The use of the phylogenetic species criterion with sequence data of protein-coding genes provide reliable data for species delimitation in Ascochyta (De Gruyter et al. 2009, 2013).

Cercospora

The genus Cercospora was erected by Fresenius (1863) with C. apii as the type species and consists of plant pathogens (Fig. 7). Species of Cercospora are distributed world-wide and are responsible for causing leaf spots on both dicotyledons and monocotyledons, and on some Acrogymnospermae and ferns (Meghvansi et al. 2013; Bakhshi et al. 2015; Park et al. 2017). Species of Cercospora were conventionally identified based on the ecological species criterion namely after the host from which they were isolated (Chupp 1954; Ellis 1971; To-anun et al. 2011). Chupp (1954) accepted 1419 Cercospora species and suggested a general concept based on the size and characters of the conidia (length, breadth, base and tip; if conidia were pigmented, single or produced in chains) and conidiophores (size, ornamentation, fasciculation; whether hila were thickened or not). Pollack (1987) published more than 3 000 Cercospora taxa based on a combination of characters namely conidiomatal arrangement, mycelium, conidiogenous cells, conidiophores and conidia. In other studies, some species were transferred to other genera such as Cercosporella, Cercosporidium, Paracercospora, Pseudocercospora, Pseudocercosporella, Pseudocercosporidium (Deighton 1967, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979) based on the morphology of the mitosporogenous loci and basal scars of the mitospores. Crous and Braun (2003) recognized 659 epithets in the genus Cercospora, and an additional 281 epithets were referred to as C. apii s. lat. based on the arrangement of conidiogenous loci and hila. The large group of Cercospora is referred to as the Cercospora complex (Goodwin et al. 2001). The C. apii complex comprises Cercospora taxa that were morphologically similar to C. apii (Crous and Braun 2003). Crous and Braun (2003) also presented the concept of “compound species” which comprise morphologically similar taxa with different host ranges for a complex of plurivorous species, which were morphologically identical. Bakhshi et al. (2018) carried out an eight-gene analysis (TEF1, act, cal, his, tub2, RPB2, gapdh) on 170 Cercospora isolates which resulted in numerous new clades in the C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. flagellaris and Cercospora sp. G. complexes. Many Cercospora species lack a sexual morph (Goodwin et al. 2001).

Several molecular phylogenies incorporating ITS gene showed that Cercospora species are monophyletic in Mycosphaerellaceae (Stewart et al. 1999; Crous et al. 2000; Goodwin et al. 2001; Videira et al. 2017). The ITS region is not useful to differentiate between Cercospora taxa (Groenewald et al. 2010). Only few studies using gene sequences other than ITS are available (Tessmann et al. 2001; Crous et al. 2004; Groenewald et al. 2005, 2006, 2010; Montenegro-Calderón et al. 2011; Videira et al. 2017; Bakhshi et al., 2018). Groenewald et al. (2010) and Montenegro-Calderón et al. (2011) used multigene phylogeny of ITS, translation elongation factor 1-alpha, actin, calmodulin and histone H3 sequence data to identify taxa in Cercospora. ITS and translation elongation factor 1-alpha were least successful in resolving Cercospora species followed by histone H3, actin and calmodulin (Groenewald et al. 2013, 2010; Montenegro-Calderón et al. 2011). Calmodulin gene was more useful in differentiating C. rodmanii from C. piaropi (Montenegro-Calderón et al. 2011). These evidences show that the phylogenetic species recognition using multi-gene sequences is most useful to identify Cercospora taxa but problematic for cryptic taxa. Vaghefi et al. (2018) reported that other methods such as multi-species coalescent analysis and BFD supported separation of cryptic species namely C. apii and C. beticola into different species and confirmed evolutionary independent lineages within C. beticola. Hence, ideal species recognition within Cercospora may need a combination of morphological, phylogenetic studies together with other methods such as Genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition, GMYC, PTP, multi-species coalescent analysis, BFD (Albu et al. 2016; Vaghefi et al. 2018).

Neofusicoccum

Neofusicoccum was introduced by Crous et al. (2006) with N. parvum as the type species. Neofusicoccum is accommodated in Botryosphaeriaceae based on morphology and phylogeny (Figs. 8, 9). The morphological criterion of Neofusicoccum was based on conidial sizes, patterns of septation, coloration in mature conidia and pigmentation of the culture media (Crous et al. 2006). Species of Neofusicoccum are morphologically similar to Botryosphaeria, the type genus of Botryosphaeriaceae hence difficult to identify based on morphology alone (Abdollahzadeh et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2013). Species delimitation in the genus Neofusicoccum was improved with the Phylogenetic Species Criterion (Crous et al. 2006; Pavlic et al. 2009). Sequences of the β-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-α (EF 1-α) gene regions have usually been used together with the ITS region for better resolution of species limits (Abdollahzadeh et al. 2013; Phillips et al. 2013). In the case of Neofusicoccum, the ITS has the least resolving power followed by translation elongation factor 1-α (EF 1-α) and β-tubulin (tub2) gene (Slippers et al. 2017). In the study of Pavlic et al. (2009), RNA polymerase II subunit (RPB2) was the most informative to differentiate between Neofusicoccum taxa. Cryptic species in the Neofusicoccum parvum–N. ribis species complex have lately been defined (Crous et al. 2006; Sakalidis et al. 2013). These taxa are found in their asexual stages and are difficult to differentiate based on morphological, ecological and geographical criteria (Pavlic et al. 2009). Cryptic taxa in Neofusicoccum cannot be identified with confidence based on ITS sequence data alone (Slippers et al. 2005). Lately, Pavlic et al. (2009) used the Genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) and reported three cryptic species within the N. parvum-N. ribis complex from S. cordatum (Myrtaceae). The biological species criteria have also been used to study species boundaries between N. parvum and N. ribis (Lopes et al. 2016). According to Lopes et al. (2016), biological studies to study sexual reproduction in Neofusicoccum taxa is scarce due to lack of mating type markers capable of amplifying a wide range of species (Lopes et al. 2017). These studies show that the phylogenetic species recognition using multi-gene locus is most useful to identify Neofusicoccum taxa, however, genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition is more useful for cryptic species delineation within the genus Neofusicoccum.

Problems and Challenges

Single-gene phylogeny vs. multi-gene phylogeny

The classification of Dothideomycetes using molecular data has evolved from single gene phylogenies when this was all that was available, to multigene phylogenies as more genes were recommended (Schoch et al. 2006; Schoch et al. 2009a, b; Ametrano et al. 2019; Chethana et al. 2021). The most studied loci are the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) because rDNA is a multiple copy gene that is easily isolated and amplified, and different regions of rDNA evolve at different rates, making it suitable to resolve taxa at various taxonomic levels (Flavell et al. 1986; Hibbett 1992). ITS, LSU and SSU of rDNA have been mostly used in fungal molecular phylogenetics (White et al. 1990). The proper placement and relationships of species in the class Dothideomycetes have first been made possible by analyses of the nuclear ribosomal small subunit DNA sequences (SSU) (Berbee and Taylor 1992a, b; Berbee 1996). Later, Liu et al. (1999) demonstrated strong support for the monophyletic Dothideomycetes using the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase gene (RPB1 and RPB2). Multilocus (generally less than six loci) phylogenies started to become very familiar after the year 2000 and showed better support compared to single-gene trees (Blackwell et al. 2006; Spatafora et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2009; Hyde et al. 2013). Sequencing of nuclear RNA gene (ITS, LSU, SSU) as well as protein-coding genes, such as RNA polymerases II (RPB1 and RPB2), β-tubulin (BTUB), translational elongation factor 1α (EF-1α), etc. became in high demand for species identification (Hyde et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2017). Phylogenetic analyses using genes from several independent evolving regions throughout the genome, capitalize on the informativeness, reduce stochastic errors, and hence improve phylogenetic accuracy. In the Assembling the Fungal Tree of Life (AFTOL) project, LSU and SSU of rDNA as well as numerous protein-coding genes, including RPB1, RPB2, TEF1, mtSSU, and ATP6, were chosen to explore the fungal phylogeny (http://aftol.org/about.php), which was used as the basis for the classification of the kingdom Fungi (Lutzoni et al. 2001; James et al. 2006; Miadlikowska et al. 2006; Schoch et al. 2006, 2009a, b). Most of the recently published fungal monographs have also used multilocus phylogenies, such as the monographs on Alternaria (Woudenberg et al. 2015), Diademaceae (Zhang et al. 2011), Didymellaceae (Chen et al. 2017), freshwater Dothideomycetes (Shearer et al. 2009; Dong et al. 2020), Massarineae (Tanaka et al. 2015), Trypetheliaceae (Lücking et al. 2016) amongst others. In these publications, the number of genes examined ranged from 1 to 6 (ITS, SSU, LSU, B-Tub, EF-1, RBP2 are commonly used). Single or few genes generate different phylogenies which result in poorly supported nodes or very weak bootstrap support because of inadequate phylogenetic information (Ebersberger et al. 2011). Some fungi are phylogenetically identified by only ITS sequence data like Pseudofusicoccum, Strigula etc. (Pavlic-Zupanc et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2020) whereas others are not distinguished like Didymella, and multi locus phylogeny is needed for the latter. A summary of different gene regions commonly used to delimit Dothideomycetes taxa are listed in Table 2. Due to the resolution power of combining multiple molecular markers, multigene phylogeny has become a primary tool and is more preferred for characterizing fungal taxa (Figs. 10, 11).

Prospects of using DNA barcode

Generally, in ‘DNA barcoding’, species are identified based on small segments of DNA sequences (Kress and Erickson 2008). The notion of using a short segment of a single gene to classify species from a comprehensive taxonomic range is quite controversial (Hebert et al. 2004b). Traditional taxonomists used several morphological characters to delineate species in the class Dothideomycetes (Barr 1976, 1979; Batista 1959; Boise 1985). Currently, these characters are useful and progressively being complemented with DNA-based data (Sakai et al. 2006; Zamora et al. 2018). Barcode sequences are, generally, short (around 500–1000 bp) and this restricts their usefulness in phylogenetic studies (Ali et al. 2014; Purty and Chatterjee 2016). Using short DNA sequences to differentiate species was suggested in early 1982 (Nanney 1982) and had consequently been tested on several species from nematodes to Dothideomycetes. From a short sequence of the rDNA or protein gene, dothideomycete taxa have been identified down to species level successfully worldwide (Hibbett et al. 2016). Apart from recognizing known species, several possibly cryptic species (e.g. Cryptocoryneum, Halobyssothecium) have also been recognised within what was formerly considered as a single morphological species (Bandarupalli et al. 2019; Schoch et al. 2009a, b; Hashimoto et al. 2017; Obase et al. 2016). The main disadvantage from a taxonomic perspective, however, is that only resorting to DNA barcode has led to speculation that precise species identification can be done by anybody who have access to DNA sequencing even though they do not have the taxonomic skill (Hebert and Gregory 2005; Kahvejian et al. 2008). The word ‘DNA barcode’ suggests that individual species is described by a unique sequence, however, there is some genetic variation within each species along with between species (Gross 2012). Interesting publications which show the effectiveness of DNA barcoding to recover biologically important dothideomycete taxa are those of Crous et al. (2009b), Phillips et al. (2013), Obase et al. (2016), and Hashimoto et al. (2017) amongst others. So far, the ITS region has been considered as the universal barcode and has been useful in several fungal groups such as edible mushrooms (Raja et al. 2017), basidiomycota (Badotti et al. 2017), lichens (Marthinsen et al. 2019) as well as with Dothideomycetes. There has obviously been concerns about the use of ITS alone and some taxonomists have also started working on other gene, such as TEF1 as potential barcode (Meyer et al. 2018). Along the same line, mycologists started exploiting the reliability of protein coding genes to better understand fungal taxonomy and in view of anticipating whether any of them could be potential barcodes. In the study of Phillips et al. (2013), the placement of Auerswaldia which was uncertain within Botryosphaeriaceae has been resolved with an appropriate DNA barcode (e.g. EF1-α and β-tubulin sequences). The addition of TEF1 together with ITS sequences resulted in a stronger separation, and was regarded as useful in some genera such as Diplodia, Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum (Phillips et al. 2013). Within a single morphologically known Cenococcum geophilum species, DNA barcoding (TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2) revealed several cryptic species and the latter differ in cultural characteristics and ecological information (Obase et al. 2016). In another latest study, morphologically similar Cryptocoryneum species were reported to comprise groups of distinct host-specific cryptic species based on phylogenetic analysis of ITS and TEF1 sequences (Hashimoto et al. 2017). Identification of species using DNA barcoding depend on the group, context and how the markers are selected (Hebert et al. 2004a, b). On the other hand, DNA barcodes may not be totally reliable. DNA-based species identification relies on differentiating intraspecific from interspecific genetic variation and since some barcodes are short, it may not be totally reliable (Meyer and Paulay 2006).

There has been considerable debate about the necessity for longer DNA barcode sequences, particularly when these sequences are used to build molecular phylogenies within the class Dothideomycetes (Moritz and Cicero 2004; Min and Hickey 2007; Xu et al. 2016). The feasibilities of a universal barcode for dothideomycete species is problematic and it is uncertain if the usefulness of DNA barcoding is restricted to species identification or if it can be used for species detection and delimitation (Gao and Zhang 2013; Lücking et al. 2020). In addition, there is no concrete system to deal efficiently with the huge amount of data generated by DNA barcoding (Liu et al. 2013). As reported from published studies, the obvious ‘failure’ of DNA barcoding to recognize dothideomycete species is generally due to a shortage of complete reference libraries (Radulovici et al. 2010; Lücking et al. 2020). Lots of barcodes will shortly be available and new species within the class Dothideomycetes will be discovered, needing correct taxonomic description (Coleman and Radulovici 2020). Effective DNA barcoding needs comparing newly generated sequences to an elementary reference database (Kress et al. 2014). Two significant challenges are: first, only a small percentage of dothideomycete species have protein coding genes data in the public databases, such as GenBank, which is a member of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) (Yahr et al. 2016; Lücking et al. 2020). Second, is the buildup of misidentified and undetermined sequences of dothideomycete taxa in public sequence databases, leading to problematic identifications (Xu et al. 2016). The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and ecological genomics is already leading in the field of molecular biology by making speedy access to entirely sequenced genomes possible (Ma and Fedorova 2010; Kulski 2016; Haridas et al. 2020), however there are problems related to the nomenclature of those DNA sequences (Hongsanan et al. 2018; Lücking et al. 2021). Despite some disadvantages of using DNA barcoding, the reported achievement of using the barcoding region in differentiating dothideomycete species from a variety of taxa and to disclose cryptic species is noteworthy (Collins and Cruickshank 2012). Nevertheless, it is recognized that species identification built on a single DNA sequence will every time yield some incorrect results (Liu and Ma 2011). The utility of using DNA barcodes is not without problems. There is a need to properly look into the methods of assessing the reliability of specific DNA barcodes, propose statistically supported intraspecific divergences (a minimum and a maximum especially where crytic species are involved) and consider a broader taxon sampling when assessments are made.

Major phylogenetic problems

Considering the difficulties with species delimitation using morphology, phylogenetic species criteria are becoming the standard for demarcating species (Rehner et al. 2011). The principal aims of evolutionary studies is to recover correct chronological relationships between group of species (Philippe et al. 2011; Nater et al. 2015). Despite immense progress in recent years, many challenges need to be overcome when dealing with phylogenetic reconstruction to delimit species within the class Dothideomycetes (Delsuc et al. 2005; Young and Gillung 2020). Some major phylogenetic problems discussed herein are a) the problem with missing data, b) taxon sampling and c) bootstrap support.

(a) The problem with missing data

The issue of “missing data” in phylogenetic studies of the class Dothideomycetes is an important one because it may indirectly affect the placement of a particular taxon. For example, researchers may exclude taxa that lack data for some genes or even not consider analyzing sequence data from a gene if some taxa do not have appropriate sequences under investigation (Wiens 2006). An alignment with existing sequences is essential to place a DNA sequence in a phylogenetic framework (Sun and Buhler 2012; Young and Gillung 2020). In some studies of the class Dothideomycetes, the presence of highly incomplete taxa (greater than 50% missing data) affect the overall topology of the phylogenetic tree and consequently, tree topologies tend to be unresolved (Wiens 2003a, b; Schoch et al. 2006; Nelsen et al. 2009; Wiens and Tiu 2012; Som 2015). Theoretically, greatly incomplete taxa also control phylogenetic inferences on the more comprehensive or existing taxa (Nabhan and Sarkar 2012). Missing characters are coded as a question mark in the alignment (Kitching et al. 2014; Dissanayake et al. 2020). Most of the time, missing data for one taxon are excluded from the analysis (Wiens 2003a, b; Wiens and Tiu 2012 For example, Ametrano et al. (2019) excluded Rachicladosporium from their phylogenetic analyses due to high amount of missing data. Another option is the careful addition of alignment sections with comprehensive data across all taxa (Tuimala 2004). Few arguments pertaining to the problems of ‘missing data’ in the class Dothideomycetes are discussed below. Many studies reported missing and indeterminate characters in the alignments. For example, Schoch et al. (2009a, b) tried to study the role played by missing data and taxon sampling and reported that most nodes produced similar patterns of support irrespective of the data set analyzed. Schoch et al. (2009a, b) also reported 52% missing and unspecified characters in their phylogenies after all introns and 379 uncertain character positions were removed. In a study by Suetrong et al. (2009), even where all genes were not present in their multi-locus matrix, absent genes were coded as missing data and formed 30% of the total characters. This study also reported that familial definitions in Dothideomycetes is problematic and missing data might be a probable reason for this. Jiang et al. (2014) reported that adding incomplete genes in phylogenetic analyses increases the accuracy of the analyses as opposed to excluding them. This was particularly true when there is a high number of incomplete genes in the overall dataset, but they reported no evidence that missing data biased branch length estimates. Song et al. (2020) reported an important protein-coding atp8 gene was missing and that the complete mtDNA sequences for this gene in Dothideomycetes are scarce which makes studies difficult.

Hence, in the case of missing data, it would be interesting to address two main questions: (1) Should we study or disregard sequences containing missing data in the phylogenetic analysis? (2) Is it compulsory to consider positions with undetermined entries? It is important to use genes or regions which are present in all the taxa to be analyzed as far as possible. The problematic regions (indels/partially covered regions) can be removed during analysis or may be removed in a pairwise and acceptable manner (Diallo et al. 2006). And last but not the least it is more instructive to construct a phylogenetic tree from each gene and then compare the trees, than to attempt to build one tree based on a concatenated dataset.

(b) Taxon sampling

One problem in introducing new genera or species of Dothideomycetes is that the wrong taxa are often used in phylogenies (Hofstetter et al. 2019; Dong et al. 2020). Improper taxon sampling can lead to erroneous classification, which can be detrimental for taxonomists or plant pathologists, given that they rely on DNA sequence data to identify species. Including more species or taxa enable better exposure of numerous substitutions since it reduces the quantity of non-phylogenetic signal, while maintaining phylogenetic signal (Philippe et al. 2011; Kamilar and Cooper 2013). A low number of species produces sufficient non-phylogenetic signal to remove the genuine phylogenetic signal existing in the phylogeny, due to short internal branches as well as heterogeneous proportions among species (Planet 2006; Wägele and Mayer 2007). Taxon sampling is however, not just about the number of species (Rannala 1998; Heath et al. 2008; Jantzen et al. 2019). The presence of both slowly evolving species as well as closely related ones is important (Venditti and Pagel 2008; Hey and Pihno 2012; Nater et al. 2015). Discarding very distant taxa certainly increases accuracy (Milne 2009; Caetano-Anollés et al. 2018; Schoch et al. 2006). Spatafora et al. (2017) reported that some dothideomycete taxa in their study are problematic because of inadequate taxon sampling which often shows as a polytomy. Likewise, Jones et al. (2019a) suggested that the phylogenetic positions of Salsugineaceae and its related genus Acrocordiopsis were not stable in their phylogenetic analyses due to inadequate taxon sampling. Ebersberger et al. (2011) reported that the backbone of the Dothideomycetes phylogeny is not yet completely resolved due to limited gene and taxon sampling. In some studies of the class Dothideomycetes, phylogenetic analyses were done based on a larger set of genes but the analyses were limited to relatively few taxa which increased branch support values but gave rise to some misleading conclusions due to insufficient taxon sampling (Philippe et al. 2005; Cornell et al. 2007; Hyde et al. 2013; Wijayawardene et al. 2017; Qiao et al. 2020). Kodsueb et al. (2006a, b) mentioned that the placement of Wettsteinina species within the Pleosporaceae need re-consideration because, in all phylogenetic analyses, Pleomassaria siparia cluster as a sister lineage with Wettsteinina species but a broader taxon sampling including more taxa from Pleomassariaceae is essential. Similarly, Ruibal et al. (2009) could not accommodate several groups of rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) in correct taxonomic placement and some genera such as Cryomyces, Coniosporium and Sarcinomyces remained as Dothideomycetes incertae sedis due to limited taxon and gene sampling. Heath et al. (2008) clearly suggested that increased taxon sampling is the most practical and realistic method for improving phylogenetic estimations. Increased taxon sampling has clear and favorable consequences for model parameter estimation and tests linked to phylogenetic analyses (Cummings and Meyer 2005). As evidenced, incomplete taxon sampling occurs for a number of reasons. Firstly, data may not be available from every existing species because of restraints of time, money, or paucity (Rosenberg and Kumar 2001). In most circumstances, the number of possible species rises rapidly hence if one is concerned about taxa above genus or family level, it may be unreasonable, if not impossible, to sample all species from the clades of interest. Rather, as far as possible, representative species from each clade can be selected and the phylogenetic relationships of these species should be considered.

(c) Statistical support derived from phylogenies

Another problem often encountered in taxonomic studies of the class Dothideomycetes is the issue of ‘statistical support’ especially when it is too weak to support a relationship. In multigene phylogenetic analyses, low statistical support values are sometimes encountered for many critical parts of the inferred phylogenetic tree. This poses a dilemma for taxonomists about whether to use or not to use results with low support values when making phylogenetic interpretations. In a few studies dealing with dothideomycete taxa, new species or strains had low bootstrap support. For example, the new species Paraconiothyrium camelliae clustered in a distinct clade sister to P. archidendri with no support in maximum likelihood analysis (Ariyawansa et al. 2020). Jayasiri et al. (2019) reported that a new strain (MFLUCC 15–0183), defined as a new host record, clustered with Vargamyces aquaticus with low support. Phookamsak et al. (2015b) provided sequence data for the reference specimen of Astrosphaeriella tornata which clustered in Astrosphaeriellaceae with no statistical support. In several other studies, low (nearly non-existent) support values were not considered important in the findings (e.g. in genus Pseudocercospora) (Crous et al. 2013), while in some, no support lead to other results in higher taxonomic classification. For example, Bezerra et al. (2016) reported that phylogenetic inferences produced no support for the taxonomic status of two formerly known orders, viz. Bezerromycetales and Wiesneriomycetales which were then treated as synonyms of another order, Tubeufiales. Some families within Dothideomycetes always have moderate or low statistical support such as the Leptosphaeriaceae, Pleosporaceae, Tubeufiaceae (Kodsueb et al 2006a; Zhang et al 2008; Schoch et al. 2009a, b; Wanasinghe et al. 2017a, b; Luo et al. 2017a). Similarly, Lepidopterella is a singleton freshwater lineage, which forms a sister clade to Mytilinidiales with low support (Shearer et al. 2009). Kruys and Wedin (2009) reported that the backbone structures of their phylogenetic trees had low or no support in their analyses in spite of adding sequence data from more than two loci. Pratibha et al. (2014) could not deduce the possible sexual connection of the freshwater genera Aquaticola and Cancellidium because of low statistical values. In a study by Voglmayr et al. (2016), multigene phylogenetic analyses showed placement of several collections within Dothideomycetes, but without a supported familial or ordinal affiliation. In another study, although a monophyly of the whole class Dothideomycetes was found in which the order Trypetheliales are currently classified, the latter received a low statistical support (39% ML) (van Nieuwenhuijzen et al. 2016). Some of the major reasons as to why there is consistently low statistical support for several Dothideomycetes are presumably because of incomplete taxon sampling, different evolutionary trajectories of different genes used (or conflicting signals) and ambiguous alignment (Schoch et al. 2009a, b; van Nieuwenhuijzen et al. 2016).

Proposal for a standardized Dothideomycetes taxonomy based on morphology and DNA phylogeny

As seen in recent years, the class Dothideomycetes has received much attention, and numerous studies have emphasized its significance to fungal taxonomy, based on its diversity and on new research published to improve the classification of dothideomycetous taxa (Schoch et al. 2009a; Hyde et al. 2013; Hongsanan et al. 2020a; b). In this section, we provide some general guidelines that can be used to establish new orders, families, genera and species in an attempt to encourage a standardized dothideomycete taxonomy (see Fig. 12):

For orders

A description of the main characters shared by all members of the order must be provided when defining a new order while fulfilling the morphological recognition criteria (e.g. ascomatal/conidiomatal feature, position of ascoma/conidioma on the host, or hyphal morphology in case of lack of complete sexual characters). If no morphological characters are shared among families in the order, the author must provide a statement to make sure that he considered the morphological recognition criteria when proposing the new order.

The morphological description should be substantiated by other information related to the ecology, host/substrate, as well as geographical data of the type of the order.

A proper justification for the new order must be provided using the molecular data based on combined gene analysis (e.g. rDNA and protein-coding gene).

The order must form a distinct and monophyletic lineage with acceptable statistical support (≥ 70% bootstrap and 95% posterior probability) (Liu et al. 2016).

In case there is no bootstrap support, taxa belonging to the new order constitute a distinct clade with sufficient evidence from morphology, a new order can be established.

For families

The genera in the family must be morphologically distinguishable and at a minimum share common features.

Establishment of a new family can be supported using additional evidence from divergence times estimates whenever possible such as in Phookamsak et al. (2016), Liu et al. (2017), Liu et al. (2018), Zhang et al. (2019), Bhunjun et al. (2021).

From a nomenclatural point of view, a new family must be defined according to the rules of Art. 18 − 19 of ICN (https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/pages/main/art_18.html).

For genera

A genus is a collection of species and should possess at least 1 recombination of morphological characters observed under the microscope and phylogenetic characters. In case no morphological characters are shared among species in the new genus, the author must provide a statement to make sure that he considered the morphological recognition criteria when establishing the new genera.

The genus must form a distinct and monophyletic lineage with acceptable statistical support (≥ 70% bootstrap and 95% posterior probability) based on phylogenetic analyses of at least two genes (e.g. rDNA and protein-coding gene) (Liu et al. 2016).

In case there is no bootstrap support, species belonging to the new genus constitute a distinct monophyletic clade with sufficient evidence from morphology, a new genus can be established.

For a genus, it is better to consider a suite of morphological characters which is phylogenetically significant and separates it from other similar genera.

From a nomenclatural point of view, a new genus must be defined according to the rules of Art. 20 − 22 of ICN (https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/pages/main/art_20.html).

For species

The new species must be defined based on morphological criteria and substantiated with molecular phylogenetic data followed by other species criteria. If no morphological characters are available, a statement must be provided. Authors must mention the species criteria used to delimit the new species (Lücking et al. 2020).

As far as possible, the new taxa must be cultured and phenotypes should be characterized. If no culture is obtained, other methods such as direct DNA extraction should be considered.

The establishment of the new species ideally must include a multi-gene phylogeny based on at least two core genes which have strong phylogenetic signals (e.g. ITS regions and at least one protein gene).

The new species must form a distinct lineage with acceptable statistical support (≥ 70% bootstrap and 90% posterior probability).

From a nomenclatural point of view, a new species must be defined according to the rules of Art. 23 of ICN (https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/pages/main/art_23.html).

Expanded guidelines for species delimitation in the fungi are provided in Jeewon and Hyde (2016), Aime et al. (2021) and Chethana et al. (2021).
