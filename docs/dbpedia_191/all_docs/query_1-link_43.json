David\n\nCABI Bioscience UK Centre (Egham),\n\nBakeham Lane, Egham, Surrey, TW20 9TY, UK\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper lists for the first time many of the names that have been used for fungal groups above the rank of order. Full bibliographic references are provided for the location where the name was first introduced together with comments on ranks, orthography, typification and the provision of descriptions or diagnoses. More general remarks are made about the nomenclature of higher taxa and the need for a more rigorous approach to the use of these names.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe introduction of names for groups of organisms at the higher ranks (Class, Division/Phylum and Kingdom) is traditionally regarded as being outside of the normal requirements of the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). Moreover, in the past many new names have been introduced in tables of classification or in text headings without any description or diagnosis although some descriptive information may be found in the text. Increasingly some authors of names and compilers of classifications have been applying the Articles of the ICBN to higher taxa, citing authors and proposing combinationes novae and status novi (for example, Cavalier-Smith, 1998). The adoption of a strictly nomenclatural approach to the names of higher taxa will give rise to problems that could require the validation of some well-known names. The absence of a list such as that provided below has resulted in the proposal of names for higher taxa at ranks where names already exist. The compilation of this information has revealed the wide variety of purposes for which such citations are used.\n\nFew names of higher taxa in the fungi are included in Kirk et al. (2001), who have provided publication information for taxa up to and including the rank of order. The following list provides a basis for extending this treatment to all ranks. In presenting this list of published examples of higher taxa in the mycological literature, the present author hopes to indicate how the nomenclatural considerations dealt with by Silva (1980) might be used to apply to taxa of the class-group and higher. A further purpose is to make available a list of published names of fungi in the broadest sense for those who need to cite higher taxa (such as in textbooks, review articles etc.). Some of the groups delineated have long since ceased to be recognized as meaningful or reflecting natural classifications. They are listed here for their historical value. That said, it is not anticipated that this list is complete - if anything, the process of putting it together has revealed the peculiar places in which these names can be found. Since this list must be regarded as an interim compilation, the author would welcome any omissions and corrections. These will be fully acknowledged when added to the list.\n\nNames for higher taxa of fungi were rare in the 18th and 19th centuries. Persoon (1794) appears to be the first to propose classes in the fungi but it is likely that the rank constituted little more than our own idea of Order. His two classes were named Angiothecium and Gymnothecium corresponding to whether the fruit-bodies were open or enclosed. These subsequently became Angiocarpi and Gymnocarpi (Persoon, 1801). Elias Fries, the founding father of so much of taxonomic mycology, was the first to provide a classification (Fries, 1821) that included classes along the lines of what we recognize today. He proposed four classes (Coniomycetes, Hyphomycetes, Gasteromycetes and Hymenomycetes). It is perhaps a tribute to his foresight that three of the four classes continue to have currency (even if they are not phylogenetically natural) up to the present day. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that that other great patriarch of mycology, Anton de Bary (in Streinz, 1862), advocated the use of more familiar class names (Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes etc.) and these became enshrined in the arrangement used by Saccardo (1882 onwards) with few additions. Thus it has been the 20th century that has seen the greatest increase in names of higher taxa, indeed of the ranks themselves. The elevation of fungi to a kingdom in their own right (Whittaker, 1969) has lead to a wholesale expansion of the hierarchy with the consequent proliferation of names. A glance at any of the main groups will show the rate of inflation from Class to Subkingdom. Today the impact of molecular biology and cladistics has brought about the recognition of small orphan groups at high levels as well as the introduction of new ranks (infrakingdom, superclass etc.).\n\nNOMENCLATURAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe following notes indicate the Articles of the Code which are relevant to names of higher taxa. The status of higher taxa is not a primary concern of the Code and it could be said that these nomenclatural considerations are an extrapolation of the Articles as they are applied to names at family level and below. Also included is some comment on currently unresolved problems in the nomenclature of higher taxa.\n\nHigher taxa constitute names under the ICBN. See Silva (1980: 12). Art. 6.6 states that a name is a name that has been validly published... Art. 6.2 states that valid publication of names is publication in accordance with Art. 32-45.\n\nThis means that a name must be:\n\neffectively published; As determined by Art 29-31.\n\nhave a form which complies with Art. 16-27; In the case of taxa above the rank of family this is governed by Art. 16 and 17. The proper ending for an order is -ales and sub-order is -ineae; the proper ending for a class of fungi is -mycetes (subclass -mycetidae) and for phyla is -mycota (subphylum -mycotina). Moore (1974) proposed the recognition of super ranks which, for fungi, would have the endings -mycia, for superclasses and -mycotera, for superphyla (superdivisions). These ranks have enjoyed limited use but more recently Barr (1983) used the superdivision; Eriksson and Winka (1997) used the superclass (as -myceta) and Cavalier-Smith (1998) has used a range of ranks including subkingdom, superdivision and superclass (as -mycetia). If these ranks are needed then, for consistency, I suggest that Moore (1974) is followed, as has generally been the case, and the ending -mycetia is adopted for the subkingdom.\n\nThe question of standard endings was discussed at the St. Louis Congress and the proposal (Prop. 25) by Reveal (1998) has been referred to the Special Committee on Suprageneric Names. Article 16.3, added in the St. Louis Code (Greuter et al., 2000), makes names of higher taxa with non-Latin terminations invalid; those with incorrect endings are to be treated as orthographic errors and corrected.\n\nA further problem arises when there is a discrepancy between the ending given and the stated rank of the taxon. It is not clear from the ICBN which takes precedence. Current practice seems to favour the ending, with the stated rank being regarded as less important. However, under the Code the rank given by the author must be accepted whereas the ending is correctable as an orthographic error, as long as it is Latin in form.\n\nA more abstruse question is the gender of endings. All taxa above the rank of family are plural and most are adjectives which agree with the kingdom in which the taxon is included. For further information on the implications of this see note (1) at the end of this paper.\n\nArt. 16, Note 2 is also significant: The principle of priority is not mandatory for names of taxa above the rank of family. However, Reveal (1998) proposed (Prop. 26) that, in choosing among typified names for a taxon above the rank of family, authors should generally follow the principle of priority. There are problems with a strict appplication of priority at higher taxon level and this proposal should, at best, be seen as a recommendation of good practice. The St. Louis Congress referred it to the Special Committee on Suprageneric Names.\n\naccompanied by a description or diagnosis or by a reference to a previously .. published description or diagnosis; For higher taxa this is a requirement that is commonly lacking since many such names are introduced in tables of classification without explanation.\n\ncomply with the special provisions of Art. 33-45; Those that apply to higher taxa are - Art. 35 (need to state the rank of the name, after 1 Jan. 1953), Art. 36 (need a Latin diagnosis, after 1 Jan. 1935) and Art 45 (date of publication of a name is that when the last condition for valid publication is fulfilled). Recently it has become more common for new taxa to be introduced with a brief Latin diagnosis but Cavalier-Smith (1998) has taken it to an extreme by providing Latin diagnoses of only a few words. While such brevity is not ruled out by the ICBN, it remains to be seen if this is acceptable to the botanical or mycological community.\n\nReveal (1998) has proposed (Prop. 31) an amendment to Art. 41.1 to cover the requirements for valid publication of names above the rank of family but this was not included in the St. Louis Code (Greuter et al., 2000) but has been referred to the Special Committee for Suprageneric Names.\n\nOne further question is the treatment of ambiregnal groups: those taxa that can be considered under both the ICZN and the ICBN. This affects groups traditionally included among the fungi but now known to belong in the protozoa. In such cases, if the taxon is described under the ICZN, its validity dates from the point at which it fulfils the requirements of the ICBN (Art. 45.4). Typically this means that a Latin diagnosis is provided. The alteration of zoological endings to the corresponding botanical ending can be considered as an orthographic correction.\n\nHigher taxa above the rank of family are typified by names that are ultimately based on generic names (Art. 7.1). Arts. 10.7 and 16.1 explicitly state that all taxa at the rank of family or above whose names are formed from generic names are typified by those genera. Silva (1980) also states that descriptive names (ones not ultimately based on generic names) do not have types. This is not apparent in the Tokyo Code (Greuter et al., 1994) where descriptive names are not mentioned. Traub (1971) believed that the earlier custom of not typifying names of taxa above the rank of family was logical as long as the features on which the ranks were based were obscure. However in his his publication he regarded the nomenclatural type of a phylum or any taxon between phylum and family is a family, that of a kingdom or any taxon between kingdom and phylum is a phylum.\n\nChanging ranks. The practice has grown up of citing a basionym where relevant when changing the rank of a suprafamilial taxon. This is not explicitly endorsed by the ICBN. Indeed the rapporteurs to the St. Louis Congress (see Taxon 48: 113, 1999), in discussing Reveals proposal to add this principle to the Code as an amendment to Art. 49, state that the practice has varied depending upon whether suprageneric names are to be treated as potential basionyms or as potential replaced synonyms. This, too, remains to be resolved. It also needs to be decided if a family can be elevated to a class or phylum in one step or if new diagnoses should be required for critical ranks and that status novi should only be proposed within certain rank-groups.\n\nFORMAT OF ENTRIES\n\nEach name is followed by the rank at which it has been published with a bibliographic reference to either (1) the earliest valid publication of the name or (2) the earliest invalid publication of the name if there is no valid publication. Within square brackets are comments on orthography, typification (T.:) and whether a description (no dscr.) or a Latin diagnosis (no Lat. diagn.) are provided. Also given are references to earlier invalid publications if relevant or the historical origin of a particular name. The type genus has been given for those names clearly based on a genus, even though a type may not have been mentioned in the cited publication. For higher taxa with descriptive names published after 1958 I have marked the type as not designated. Author name abbreviations follow those given in Kirk and Ansell (1992). Journal titles are abbreviated (where possible) according to the World List and book titles follow the shortened (but not abbreviated) titles in Taxonomic Literature.\n\nEntries in bold are those which meet the criteria for valid publication under the ICBN. Entries not emboldened fail in one way or many to meet the requirements for valid publication. It is not intended to recommend that these names are not used or should necessarily be validated but to demonstrate the implications of a strict application of the ICBN to higher taxa.\n\nCONSPECTUS TAXORUM SUPRAORDINALIUM FUNGORUM (SENSU LATO)\n\nAcrasiomycetidae, as subclass: L.S.

DE BARY (Bot. Zeit. 1887, p. 176) queritur quod dicamus Pyrenomyceteae, Discomyceteae etc. nec, more solito, Pyrenomycetes, Discomycetes etc. Respondo: quia universim classes, familiae etc. plantarum e genere feminino habentur (Ranunculaceae nec Ranunculacei). Hinc male audiret e.g., Cohors Pyrenomycetes, Fam. Perisporiaceae). This scholarly argument was taken up by Copeland (1956: 9) where he comments that, Names of groups higher than genera are in the plural. Some are proper nouns; the remainder are adjectives used as proper nouns, agreeing in gender with the names of the kingdoms in which they are included. On the strength of this Copeland changed the endings of all families and orders in his phylum Inophyta (which included fungi) to -alea and -acea, to agree with the neuter gender of kingdom Protoctista. The earlier mycological authors certainly were aware of this as the endings of their higher taxa were all masculine plurals to agree with Fungi (masc. nom. pl.). For instance in Fries (1821) most of the taxa end in -i, with a few exceptions, thus Classis Gasteromycetes; Ord. Uterini Veri; subord. Pyrenomycetes; † Xylomacei, †† Cytispori, ††† Sphaeriacei, †††† Phacidacei. These forms have subsequently been corrected to end in -ae, in agreement with Kingdom Plantae, to which fungi were considered to belong. The recognition of the Kingdom Fungi should theoretically result in all the endings being changed back to -i.\n\n(2) Class names of fungi derived from genera ending in -myces. The class Saccharomycetes, based on the genus Saccharomyces, was introduced prior to the standardization of rank endings in the ICBN, which requires that class names of fungi take the termination -mycetes. Thus the class name for Saccharomyces should technically be Saccharomycomycetes and similar cases arise for classes based on Allomyces and Schizosaccharomyces. This form is clumsy and not euphonious. When discussed recently it was suggested that Art. 16.4 (shortened names) could be expanded to cover these cases. In anticipation of a proposal to be made to the next Congress, these names are retained here in their original form. This also applies to other terminations derived from -myces, namely -mycotina and -mycota.\n\n(3) Author citation of Class Ascomycetes: The earliest mention of the name (at an unspecified rank but above class) is von Schweinitz (1832: 143) but his concept included both basidiomycetes and ascomycetes although the diagnosis is quite clear, Gerentes Sporidia ascis inclusa, nempe. The concept of a group of fungi with the shared characteristic of spores borne in asci is attributed to Léveillé (1846: 105133) but there the term Thécasporés is used. The first clear usage of the term corresponding to a modern interpretation of the name occurs in Berkeley (1857: 269, 270) but the rank is not stated but is given as a subdivision of fam. Fungales. De Bary (1862: 724) uses the term, but again without rank in a classification that has been regarded as the origin of many of the modern groups of the fungi. However, Copeland (1956: 125) and Kreisel (1969: 84) attribute this name to Sachs (Lehrbuch der Botanik, ed. 4: 248, 1874) where the name is given as Ascomyceten without rank as a subdivision of Klasse Carposporeen. This then is given in the English edition (Bennett and Thistleton-Dyer, 1875; as Group IV. Ascomycetes, although it should be noted that the classification given there is explicitly stated to be based on that of De Bary (1862) and definitively stated to be at the rank of class by Winter (1881). Winter (1879) does not state the rank of Ascomycetes. This is given by Copeland as (Sachs ex Bennett & Thistleton-Dyer) Winter and by Kreisel as (Sachs) Winter. Winter (1881) does refer back to de Bary as well and so it could be argued that de Bary should be cited as the author of the basionym but, given that Berkeley was earlier and it could be argued that von Schweinitz has priority, either of these could be cited in stead. It is therefore simpler to base the name on Winter (1881) alone since only there do all the requirements for valid publication at that rank occur.\n\n(4) On the name for the kingdom of heterokont organisms.\n\nChromista, as Kingdom: first proposed by Cavalier-Smith (1981), but also as Kingdom Chromophyta on p. 467 where the name Chromista is not mentioned. The name Chromophyta was first introduced by Bourrelly (1957: 106). The name is introduced without a given rank, …lidée dun grande ensemble des Chromphytes opposé aux Chlorophytes… sest scindé en phylums indépendants ne descendant pas les uns des autres par filiation directe.\n\nStramenopila, as Kingdom: Alexopoulos et al. (1996: 62). This name, incorrect in form, is derived from the original proposal of the term Stramenopile for a group of protists with tubular hairs on their flagella, by Patterson (1989: 358). The form of the term was corrected by Vørs (1993) fide Corliss (1994) to straminopile. This was further corrected in Hawksworth et al. (1995: 442) to straminipila and straminipile ; where Dicks proposal to recognize it as the name for the kingdom Chromista is noted. This correction is based on the fact that the genitive of stramen (required for the correct formation of a compound) is straminis and the connective used, since both parts are latin is i. The use of the kingdom name in Alexopoulos et al. (1996) refers back to a presumed reference to the Dictionary of the Fungi (as Hawksworth et al., 1994) anticipating the acceptance of the name in that work and Dicks publication of it in a Mycological Paper. The name has been formally published by Dick, Straminipilous Fungi: 275 (2001). Patterson and Sogin (1992) delineate a natural lineage which they refer to as Stramenopiles, broadly similar to the Chromista but also including some taxa more commonly included in the Protista.\n\n(5) On the spelling of higher taxa based on Chytridium A. Braun and Hyphochytrium Zopf. The latter name has been incorrectly formed into the Class name Hyphochytridiomycetes, presumably by analogy to the Chytridiomycetes. However, the stem is Hyphochytri- and not Hyphochytridi-. The class Chytridiomycetes is based ultimately on Chytridium and is therefore correctly formed with the -di- as the third syllable. The apparent correction to Chytriomycotina by Cavalier-Smith, T. (1987: 340), possibly based on the correction of Hyphochytriomycetes by Dick (1983), is ill-founded.\n\n(6) The correct form of names of higher taxa based on the generic name Glomus. The paper by Schüßler et al. (2001) corrected the orthography of names based on Glomus which had hitherto been spellt as if the stem were Glom- rather than Glomer-. The latter stem should be used since Glomus is a neuter noun with a genitive singular Glomeris. To adopt the former stem would imply that Glomus is a masculine noun with a genitive singular Glomi and consequently many of the species epithets in the genus would have to be altered.\n\n(7) The Hydromyxomycetes/Hydromyxales are based on the Vampyrellaceae, now considered to be a protistan group.\n\n(8) Copeland (1956: 8) notes that the next category below that of kingdom was originally termed embranchement by Cuvier in 1812. More recent usage of this term can be found in past editions of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature where they have been translated into French. While the 1910 Code (Briquet, 1912) cites in Article 10 that the rank between Kingdom and Class is un division (= Divisio), the 1930 Code (Briquet, 1935) gives the rank name in French as embranchement and this is continued through subsequent Codes. Effectively, then, the more modern use of the term is for a division or phylum and it is in this sense that its use by Moreau (1953) and Manier (1955) should be interpreted. Certainly both use the term for a rank above that of class.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis compilation would "
