        "text": "3 RESULTS\n\n3.1 Phylogeny\n\nML and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted using an aligned sequence dataset comprising 572 nucleotide positions from ITS, 1,277 from LSU and 274 from rpb2. The alignment contained a total of 72 taxa, which consisted of 69 taxa in ITS (95.8%), 70 in LSU (97.2%) and 57 in rpb2 (79.2%) (Tables 1, S1). The combined data set provided higher confidence values for the genera and species levels than the individual gene trees (Figure 1, Supporting Information Figure S1). Of the 2,123 characters included in the alignment, 627 were variable and 1,460 were conserved. The ML tree with the highest log likelihood (−17 618.731) is shown in Figure 1. The Bayesian likelihood score was −17 167.525. The topology recovered by Bayesian analysis was identical to that of the ML tree. The six isolates of Collapsimycopappus styracis formed a robust clade (100% ML BP/1.00 Bayesian PP), separate from the other genera in Mycosphaerellaceae (Figure 1) on the tree.\n\n3.2 Inoculation experiment\n\nSymptoms of the disease caused by inoculation with mycelial agar were identical to those of the natural infection (Figure 2b). A conspicuous brown zonate leaf spot spread within 4 months, and numerous propagules developed in necrotic areas on the upper leaf surface (Figure 2e–h). The pathogens, which were reisolated from the necrotic areas (Table 1), were morphologically and phylogenetically identical to the inoculated fungus.\n\n3.3 Taxonomy\n\nCollapsimycopappus A. Hashim., Y. Harada & Kaz. Tanaka, gen. nov. — MycoBank MB824336.\n\nEtymology: From the Latin word collapsus meaning “collapse” in reference to the collapsed appendages of the mature propagules.\n\nSexual morph: Unknown. Asexual morph: Propagules epiphyllous, brown to dark brown, cheiroid; main bodies doliiform, composed of pale brown to brown, globose to subglobose cells. Hyphal appendages unbranched, flexuous, cylindrical, collapsed when mature; part spores rectangular, brown, smooth or verruciform, phragmosporous or sometimes dictyosporus, one- to multiseptate, guttulate when young.\n\nNotes: Collapsimycopappus is established to accommodate C. styracis. This genus is characterized by brown propagules with hyphal appendages that collapse at maturity.\n\nCollapsimycopappus is closely related to three Mycodiella species and “Mycosphaerella” polygoni-cuspidati (100% ML BP/1.00 Bayesian PP, Figure 1), but these four species are known to have only sexual morphs in common (Crous, Verkley, & Groenewald, 2006; Crous, Wingfield, Burgess et al., 2016; Crous, Wingfield, Richardson et al., 2016; Ito, Sato, & Ota, 1957; Kurose et al., 2009, 2016). Collapsimycopappus is similar to Polythrincium in having sporodochial conidiomata and melanized conidia (Simon, Groenewald, & Crous, 2009), but differs in its lack of sympodially growing conidiophores with a spiral appearance. In addition, no genera with mycopappus-like propagules have been reported in Mycosphaerellaceae (Videira et al., 2017). Therefore, Collapsimycopappus is introduced as a new genus in Mycosphaerellaceae.\n\nCollapsimycopappus styracis A. Hashim., Y. Harada & Kaz. Tanaka, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB824337; Figure 2.\n\nEtymology: Refers to the generic name of the host plant.\n\nSexual morph: Unknown. Asexual morph: Propagules epiphyllous, brown, with dark brown basal cells firmly united together, with 6–15 arms ( , n = 54); main bodies doliiform, 32–55 μm wide, 11–20 μm high, composed of pale brown to brown, globose to subglobose cells, 4–15 × 5–8 μm. Hyphal appendages 14 to 51, unbranched, flexuous, cylindrical, obtuse at the apex, 6–28-septate, 40–167.5 × 7–12.5 μm ( = 89.9 × 8.1 μm, n = 38), collapse at maturity and divided into part spores; part spores rectangular, 7.5–38 × 7–10 μm ( = 18.5 × 8.3 μm, n = 40), l/w 1.1–3.8 ( = 2.2, n = 40), brown, smooth or verruciform, phragmosporous or sometimes dictyosporous, with 1–7 transverse and rarely one vertical septa, truncate at the base, guttulate when young.\n\nSpecimens examined (all on living leaves of Styrax obassia): Japan, Aomori, Fukaura, near Sasanai river, 22 Oct 2011, K. Tanaka, KT 2938 (HHUF 30606; ex-paratype culture JCM 32505); ibid., KT 2939 (HHUF 30607; ex-paratype culture JCM 32506); ibid., 23 Sep 2010, Y. Harada, HH 30066 (HHUF 30066; ex-paratype culture JCM 32503); ibid., 17 Oct 2010, Y. Harada & K. Tanaka, HH 30067 (HHUF 30067 holotype designated here; ex-holotype culture JCM 32504 = MAFF 246433); artificial inoculation using HH 30066, 6 Oct 2011, Y. Sasaki, YS 3 (HHUF 30089, ex-paratype culture JCM 32507); artificial inoculation using HH 30067, 17 Oct 2011, Y. Sasaki, YS 4 (HHUF 30090, ex-paratype culture JCM 32508).\n\nNotes: The symptoms of disease appeared in autumn (Figure 2a, c, d). Many propagules occurred on necrotic areas of the upper leaf surface in late summer (Figure 2g–i). The hyphal appendages of propagules were collapsed and divided into part spores in early autumn (Figure 2k, o–r). Mycelial agar inoculated artificially onto leaves of the plant in early summer (June 3, 2011) caused the development of symptoms identical to those of the natural disease in autumn (Oct 6, 2011 and Oct 17, 2011). Inoculations in August failed to generate disease (data not shown). A sexual morph of the species was found neither in the nature nor in overwintered (4°C) diseased leaves or in any agar media (data not shown).\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nThe phylogenetic analyses suggested that Collapsimycopappus is a member of Mycosphaerellaceae. A clade comprising three species of Mycodiella and “Mycosphaerella” polygoni-cuspidati is a sister to Collapsimycopappus (Figure 1). Mycodiella was introduced to accommodate three species previously known as Mycosphaerella (Crous, Wingfield, Richardson et al., 2016). Mycodiella eucalypti is the type species of the genus and is known to be a leaf pathogen of Eucalyptus diversicolor F. Muell. in Australia. The other two species were originally described as Mycosphaerella sensu lato and transferred to Mycodiella. Other Mycodiella species are leaf pathogens; Mycod. sumatrensis, occurs on Eucalyptus sp. in Indonesia (Crous et al., 2006), and Mycod. laricis-leptolepidis is the cause of needle cast in Japanese Larch [Larix kaempferi (Lamb.) Carrière] in Japan (Ito et al., 1957). “Mycosphaerella” polygoni-cuspidati is known to cause leaf spot disease in Fallopia japonica (Houtt.) Ronse Decr., and its life cycle involving a sexual morph and spermatial stage has been described (Kurose et al., 2009, 2016). “Mycosphaerella” polygoni-cuspidati is related to Mycod. eucalypti according to a BLAST search with ITS sequences, but the generic position of this organism remains unresolved (Crous, Wingfield, Richardson et al., 2016). By bad luck, we could not compare the morphological characteristics between Collapsimycopappus and the four species mentioned above because no sexual morph was observed for Collapsimycopappus, and asexual morphs have not been reported for Mycodiella spp. or “M.” polygoni-cuspidati. However, we conclude that they are distinct genera because Collapsimycopappus has mycopappus-like brown propagules atypical for Mycosphaerellaceae. Therefore, it should be treated as a novel genus Collapsimycopappus within Mycosphaerellaceae.\n\nA mycopappus-like propagule may have evolved at least three times in the Ascomycota: Mycosphaerellaceae (Capnodiales, Dothideomycetes; this study), Pseudodidymellaceae (Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes; Funk & Dorworth, 1987; Gross et al., 2017; Hashimoto et al., 2017; Wei et al., 1997, 1998) and Sclerotiniaceae (Helotiales, Leotiomycetes; Redhead & White, 1985; Suto & Kawai, 2000; Suto & Suyama, 2005; Takahashi et al., 2006). This appears to have resulted from convergent evolution of a similar ecological function, such as rain-splash dispersal across the leaf surface. The mycopappus-like propagules of these fungi have been considered as contributors to secondary infection on host leaves due to their high inoculum potential. Therefore, they play an important role in disease development (Hashimoto et al., 2017; Wei et al., 1998). The hyphal appendages of mycopappus-like propagules often separate into part spores when they mature, and the spores are able to germinate individually (Figure 2u). The numerous melanized part spores may contribute to additional infection of host leaves and to the survival of the fungus during overwintering, but further studies are needed to elucidate an ecological role. In addition, it is important to confirm the mechanism of the fungal infection whether through the stomata or wounds of the host plant in nature.\n\nRecent molecular studies on Mycosphaerellaceae have promoted the taxonomic revision of major pathogenic groups, such as Cercospora, Septoria and Ramularia-complex (e.g., Crous et al., 2013; Marin-Felix et al., 2017; Quaedvlieg, Groenewald, de Jesús Yáñez-Morales, & Crous, 2012; Quaedvlieg et al., 2011, 2013; Verkley, Quaedvlieg, Shin, & Crous, 2013; Videira, Groenewald, Braun, Shin, & Crous, 2016; Videira et al., 2017). Although the present study revealed an unexpected lineage within Mycosphaerellaceae, we could not further resolve the circumscription of the family. To bridge the gap of missing lineages and resolve the heterogeneity of Mycosphaerellaceae, additional phenotypic and molecular studies on existing genera as well as hidden lineages will be required."
