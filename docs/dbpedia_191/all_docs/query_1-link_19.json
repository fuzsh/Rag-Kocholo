        "text": "3.1.1. Taxonomy\n\nStrain KNU-JJ-1827 showed different morphological characteristics compared with other allied Didymocyrtis species. Therefore, it is proposed as a new species.\n\nDidymocyrtis septata K. Das, S.Y. Lee and H.Y. Jung, sp. nov. ()\n\nCultural and morphological characteristics of KNU-JJ-1827. The colony on potato dextrose agar (A); malt extract agar (B); oatmeal agar (C); synthetic nutrient agar (D) incubated for 14 days at 25 °C. Conidiomata on SNA (E,F); Conidiogenous cells (G–I); Conidia (J). Arrows indicated conidiogenous cells. Scale bars: E,F = 500 μm; G–J = 10 μm.\n\nMycoBank: MB 835967\n\nEtymology: The specific name “septata” refers to the number of septa in the conidia.\n\nTypus: Jeju Island (33°25′22.9″N 126°33′01.6″E), isolated from soil. The stock culture (NIBRFGC000502248) was deposited in the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR), as a metabolically inactive culture.\n\nEcology and Distribution: Several members of this genus were isolated from the hard, leathery leaves of Banksia and from the surface of the leaves. Some of the species were found on Brachylaena discolor from South Africa and Cladonia cervicornis from Spain. Moreover, several members were also isolated from Cladonia arbuscula, C. uncialis, and C. uliginosa from Finland and Russia. The proposed novel species, namely D. septata, was isolated from soil obtained in Jeju Island. The soil contained plant debris, was sandy, and had a lower moisture capacity.\n\nCultural characteristics: The colonies were flat, spreading with moderate aerial mycelium, with round, smooth, lobate margins, reaching 31.3 to 34.2 mm in diameter after 7 days at 25 °C. Reverse colonies were brown to dark olive-green associated with white mycelia growing on the edge of the Petri dish containing PDA medium (). On MEA, the colony surface was brown to olive green reaching 30.1 to 34.2 mm in diameter after 7 days at 25 °C with reverse dirty white to irregular brown patches (). On OA, the colony surface was brown, measuring 31.2 to 36.3 mm in diameter after 7 days at 25 °C with reverse brownish patches (). On SNA, the colonies were white to light brown and measured 12.2 to 15.1 mm in diameter after 7 days at 25 °C; the reverse colonies were also white to light brown ().\n\nMorphological characteristics: The micromorphological structures were studied using the colonies and conidiomata abundantly produced on SNA media. The conidiomata were pycnidial, immersed, dark brown to black, sparse, irregular, solitary, or aggregated, and measured up to 500 μm. The vegetative mycelium was immersed, hyaline to light brown, smooth-walled, and mostly 1.8–2.0 μm thick (). There were also conidiogenous cells lining the inner wall of the pycnidial cavity, globose to subglobose, also ampulliform to doliiform, hyaline, non-proliferating, aggregated, smooth-walled, and measuring 7.0–10.9 × 2.2–3.3 μm (). Conidia were abundant, arising singly, hyaline, greenish to light yellowish, blunted at both apices, fusiform, clavate to subcylindrical, (0–)1 septate, guttulate, diameter of 7.0–9.5 × 1.9–2.9 μm (n = 100), with an average size of 8.2 × 2.3 μm ().\n\nNote: Conidiomata of the strain KNU-JJ-1827 were pycnidial, immersed, dark brown to black, sparse, irregular, solitary, or aggregated, and with a diameter of up to 500 μm. However, the closest type strain, Didymocyrtis brachylaenae, produced conidiomata that were pycnidial, globose, brown, measuring 200–350 μm in diameter, with central ostiole (). Moreover, another closest strain, D. cladoniicola, produced conidiomata that were immersed in pale necrotic areas of the thallus or partially erumpent, black, subspherical to pyriform, with a diameter of 50–100 μm (). Furthermore, the conidiomata were larger than those of strains D. xanthomendozae (140–160), D. slaptoniensis (80–120), and D. banksiae (200–300). The size of the conidiogenous cells also differed from that of the closest species, with the larger diameter (7.0–10.9 × 2.2–3.3 μm) than the closest species D. brachylaenae (5.0–7.0 × 2.5–3.5). The conidiogenous cells were also larger than those of D. cladoniicola (2.5–4.5 × 2.5–4.0 μm), but very close in size to D. xanthomendozae (5.0–10.0 × 2.5–3.5 μm) and D. slaptoniensis (8.0–10.0 × 5.0–6.0 μm; ). The strain, D. banksiae produced larger (5.0–13.0 × 3.0–4.0) conidiogenous cells than strain KNU-JJ-1827. The diameter of conidia of the strain KNU-JJ-1827 was 7.0–9.5 × 1.9–2.9 μm, whereas D. brachylaenae produced conidia with diameter of 9.0–10.0 × 2.0–3.0 μm. The conidia were also comparatively larger than those of D. xanthomendozae (5.6–7.1 × 3.3–4.3 μm), D. cladoniicola (4.7–5.9 × 2.4–3.0), and D. slaptoniensis (6.0–8.0 × 2.5–3.5 μm; ). The strain, D. banksiae, produced larger conidia (10.0–11.0 × 3.0–4.0), whereas the proposed novel strain KNU-JJ-1827 produced conidia 7.0–9.5 × 1.9–2.9 μm in diameter. Furthermore, there was a difference in the number of septate conidia with that of the closest species. Moreover, the closest species, D. brachylaenae, produced 1(–3) septate conidia, but strain KNU-JJ-1827 developed (0–)1 septate conidia. A comparison with the nearest certain species of the genus showed a lower number of septate conidia, larger size of conidiogenous cells and conidomatal size, and different conidial size. Thus, the morphology of strain KNU-JJ-1827 is totally different from previously identified closest species of Didymocyrtis.\n\n3.2.1. Taxonomy\n\nStrain KNU-JJ-1829 showed different morphological characteristics compared with the other species of Parathyridaria. Therefore, it is proposed as a new species.\n\nParathyridaria ellipsoidea K. Das, S.Y. Lee and H.Y. Jung, sp. nov. ()\n\nCultural and morphological characteristics of KNU-JJ-1829. The colony growing on potato dextrose agar (A); malt extract agar (B); oatmeal agar (C) for 14 days incubation at 25 °C. Conidiomata on PDA after 8 weeks (D,E); Conidiogenous cells (F,G); Conidia (H). Scale bars: D,E = 500 μm, F–H = 10 μm.\n\nMycoBank: MB 835968\n\nEtymology: The Latin word “ellipsoidea” refers to the shape of the conidia.\n\nTypus: Jeju Island (33°25′22.9″N, 126°33′01.6″E), isolated from soil. The stock culture (NIBRFGC000502247) was deposited in the National Institute of Biological Resources (NIBR), as a metabolically inactive culture.\n\nEcology and Distribution: Members of this genus are known to be saprobes and human pathogens. Recently, the members of this genus were isolated from Robinia pseudoacacia in Italy and from twigs of Philadelphus coronarius (Hydrangeaceae) in Germany, and also as a saprobic fungus on dead twigs of Ribes rubrum and Sambucus nigra in France and Germany. The isolated species proposed as a novel species, namely P. ellipsoidea, was isolated from soil in Jeju Island. The soil contained plant debris, was sandy, and had lower moisture capacity.\n\nCultural characteristics: The colonies were flat, with moderate aerial mycelia, irregular fungal growth, and reached 26.3 to 28.1 mm in diameter after 14 days at 25 °C. The reverse colonies were brown to blackish on PDA media (). On MEA, the colonies were white to brown reaching 29.3 to 31.1 mm diameter after 14 days at 25 °C, with the reverse colonies brown to yellowish at the center (). On OA, the colonies were brown, appearing as thick white patches around the edges to center reaching 32.2 to 34.3 mm in diameter after 14 days at 25 °C, with the reverse colonies brownish ().\n\nMorphological characteristics: The pycnidial conidiomata cultured on PDA were separate, pycnidial, brown, globose, black, solitary, spherical to subspherical, with thin wall, with pycnidia observed after 8 weeks, and measuring up to 500 μm (). The hyphae were branched, septate, hyaline becoming dark brown with age, and 1.8–2.4 μm wide. The conidiophores were limited to the conidiogenous cells lining the inner cavity, and were hyaline, smooth, round, oval to ampulliform, proliferating percurrently near the phialidic apex, and measuring 4.5–5.7 × 2.5–3.7 μm (). The conidia were aseptate, solitary, with obtuse apex and base bluntly rounded, broadly ellipsoidal to ellipsoidal, brown, smooth, at times slightly granular, measuring 3.4–4.8 × 1.7–3.6 μm (n = 100), with an average diameter of 4.0 × 2.3 μm ().\n\nNote: Strain KNU-JJ-1829 developed pycnidial conidiomata cultured on PDA and measured up to 500 μm after 8 weeks, whereas the closest type strain, Parathyridaria percutanea, produced 59–102 × 54–96 μm. Type strain, P. philadelphi, developed smaller conidiomata (on OA media), 250–300 μm in diameter, but the condiomatal structures were not detected in the closest type strains determined by phylogeny, such as P. ramulicola, P. robiniae, and P. rosae (). The conidiogenous cells of the strain KNU-JJ-1829 were hyaline, smooth, round, oval to ampulliform, with a diameter of 4.5–5.7 × 2.5–3.7 μm. However, the conidiogenous cells of the closest species, P. rosae, were not detected (). Even other closest species, P. ramulicola and P. percutanea, did not produce any conidiogenous cells either, whereas P. philadelphi produced cells with a diameter measuring 4.0–7.0 × 3.0–4.0 μm (). Strain KNU-JJ-1829 produced numerous conidia, with diameter of 3.4–4.8 × 1.7–3.6 μm. Conversely, the closest species, P. rosae and P. ramulicola, did not produce any conidia, and another nearest species, P. philadelphi (4.0–6.0 × 2.0 μm), was larger but P. percutanea (1.2–2.0 × 0.7–0.9) produced smaller conidia (). A comparison of the nearest certain species within the genus showed the production of conidiogenous cells and conidia, because the production of any asexual morph was not detected in the closest type strain P. rosae. The next closest type strain produced very similar conidiogenous cells and conidia, and it is not clustered together phylogenetically with strain KNU-JJ-1829. Therefore, the morphology of strain KNU-JJ-1829 is distinct from previously identified species of Parathyridaria."
