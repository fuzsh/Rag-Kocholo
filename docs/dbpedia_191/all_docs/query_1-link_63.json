Introduction\n\nFungi are a diverse group of ubiquitous organisms present in almost all ecosystems on Earth, including aquatic habitats [1]. Several fungal taxa have been isolated from freshwater environments, which offer a wide range of organic substrates for fungal colonization [2]. The most important role of fungi in freshwater is the recycling of dead organic matter, typically submerged plant debris [3]. Freshwater fungi complete (at least one part of) their life cycle into the water, and disperse their propagules through the water. Freshwater fungi are generally classified into different sorts of morphological and ecological groups: the “Ingoldian”, producing submerged star-like (stauro-) or worm-like (scoleco-) asexual spores (or propagules) in lotic habitats (moving waters) [2,4]; the aero-aquatic, forming helical, net-like or globose conidia above the surface of lentic (standing) waters [5]; and members of the Ascomycota reproducing by the formation of conidia or sexual propagules (ascospores) into fertile bodies (conidiomata and ascomata, respectively). Members of the Ascomycota reproducing by ascospores seem to be less exclusively adapted to life in aquatic environments than the other sort of previously cited fungal groups [6]. These fungi produce unitunicate asci with apical structures, or these are fissitunicate (bitunicate) and the ascospores are mostly ornate with mucilaginous sheaths or appendages which facilitate the attachment to submerged substrates [7].\n\nThe freshwater Ascomycota (FWA) are one of the least studied groups of fungi but they are taxonomically diverse and have representatives in a wide spectrum of families and orders. Approximately one third of the FWA with sexual reproduction belongs to the class Dothideomycetes [8]. Four lineages of the class Dothideomycetes have been recently described from this habitat: the order Jahnulales [9], the family Lindgomycetaceae [10,11], the family Natipusillaceae [12] and the family Amniculicolaceae [13,14]. The latter was established by Zhang in 2009 [15] to accommodate the genera Amniculicola, Murispora and Pseudomassariosphaeria [15]. Although all species of those three genera grow and produce a purple pigment on submerged wood, they differ in the morphology of the ascospores, which vary in color (hyaline in Amniculicola, and brown in Murispora and in Pseudomassariosphaeria) and septation (1-septate in Amniculicola, transversely multiseptate in Pseudomassariosphaeria, and with multiple transversal, longitudinal and oblique septa (muriform) in Murispora) [15,16]. Most of the Amniculicolaceae have been reported from freshwater habitats in Italy, France, Germany, Denmark and China [15,16,17,18].\n\nDuring a survey on fungi living on decaying plant material in freshwater habitats in Spain, several strains that are morphologically compatible with members of the family Amniculicolaceae have been isolated in pure culture. The objectives of this study were to characterize phenotypically and to identify such fungi by phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of informative molecular markers.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Sample Collection and Specimen Examination\n\nA total of 105 samples of submerged plant material were collected: three in Les Guilleries (Barcelona province), 50 in Cascadas del Huéznar (Cazalla de la Sierra, Sevilla province), 22 in Capafonts (Tarragona province) and 30 in Serra del Montsant (Tarragona province), Spain. These were placed into sterile self-sealing plastic bags to be transported to the lab and stored until processing. The specimens were rinsed twice with tap water, placed into Petri dishes or appropriate plastic containers lined inside with filter paper and moistened with sterile water with diehldrin® (20 drops of a solution of 20 mg diehldrin in 20 mL of dimethyl-ketone/L of water), incubated at room temperature (20–25 °C), and examined periodically under stereomicroscope for up to 2 months. Several ascomata or asexual propagules were taken and transferred using sterile disposable tuberculin-type needles to 55 mm diam. Petri dishes containing oatmeal agar (OA; 30 g of filtered oat flakes, 15 g agar-agar, 1 L tap water [19]), then incubated at room temperature. All isolates were stored in the culture collection of the Faculty of Medicine at Universitat Rovira i Virgili (FMR; Reus, Spain). Type specimens and ex-type cultures of the novel fungi were deposited in the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands (Table 1).\n\n2.2. Phenotypic Study\n\nMacroscopic characterization of the colonies was performed on OA, 2% malt extract agar (MEA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) [19] and potato dextrose agar (PDA; Pronadisa, Madrid, Spain) [20] into 90 mm diam. Petri dishes, after incubation for three weeks at 15 °C in the dark for species of the genus Murispora [16], and in similar conditions but at 20 °C for other taxa. Color notations were according to Kornerup and Wanscher (1978) [21]. The ability of the isolates to grow at cardinal temperatures was determined on PDA after 7 d in the dark, ranging from 5 to 35 °C, at 5 °C intervals, but also at 37 °C. Measurements and descriptions of microscopic structures were taken from specimens mounted in Shear’s mounting medium (3 g potassium acetate, 60 mL glycerol, 90 mL ethanol 95% and 150 mL distilled water) [22], using an Olympus BH-2 bright field microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Photomicrographs were taken using a Zeiss Axio-Imager M1 microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) with a DeltaPix Infinity × digital camera using Nomarski differential interference contrast.\n\n2.3. DNA Extraction PCR Amplification and Sequencing\n\nThe strains were cultured on PDA for 7 days at 25 °C in the dark. Total DNA was extracted using the FastDNA kit protocol (Bio101, Vista, CA, USA), with a FastPrep FP120 instrument (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was quantified by using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Madrid, Spain). The following loci were amplified and sequenced: LSU (28S nrRNA gene), with the primer pair LR0R [23] and LR5 [24]; ITS (internal transcribed spacer region), with the primer pair ITS5 and ITS4 [25]; and tef1 with EF1-983F and EF1-2218R [26]. The PCR amplifications were performed in a total volume of 25 µL containing 5 µL 10 × PCR Buffer (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.5 µL of each primer, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase and 1–10 ng genomic DNA. PCR conditions for LSU and ITS were set as follows: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing and extension, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. For the LSU and ITS amplification, the 35 cycles consisted of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 53 °C and 2 min at 72 °C; and for the tef1 an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min 20 s at 57 °C and 1 min 30 s at 72 °C. PCR products were purified and stored at −20 °C until sequencing. The same pairs of primers were used to obtain the sequences at Macrogen Spain (Macrogen Inc., Madrid, Spain). The consensus sequences were obtained using the SeqMan software v. 7 (DNAStar Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA).\n\n2.4. Phylogenetic Analysis\n\nThe sequences generated in this study were compared with those of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Alignment for each locus was performed with the MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software v. 7.0. [27], using the ClustalW algorithm [28] and refined with MUSCLE [29] or manually, if necessary, on the same platform. The alignment included our sequences, together with those available at the NCBI databases, of all genera and species belonging to the family Amniculiculaceae, and representatives of the families Lindgomytaceae, Teratospharriaceae, Lophiostomataceae and Sporormiaceae (Table 1). The phylogenetic analyses were carried out using Maximum-Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) with RAxML v. 8.2.10 [30] using the Cipres Science gateway portal [31] and MrBayes v. 3.2.6 [32], respectively. For ML analyses, the best nucleotide substitution model was General Time Reversible with Gamma distribution. Support for internal branches was assessed by 1000 ML bootstrapped pseudoreplicates. For the BI phylogenetic analysis, the best nucleotide substitution model was determined using jModelTest [33]. For ITS, we used the symmetrical model with gamma distribution (SYM + G), for LSU, we used the symmetrical model with proportion of invariable sites and gamma distribution (SYM + I + G), and for tef1, we used the General Time Reverse with proportion of invariable sites and gamma distribution (GTR + I + G). The parameter settings were two simultaneous runs of 5M generations, four Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), sampled every 1000 generations. The 50% majority-rule consensus tree and posterior probability values were calculated after discarding the first 25% of the samples. Leptosphaeria dolium (CBS 125,979 and CBS 505.75) served as outgroup taxa. Confident branch support was defined as Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) ≥ 0.95 and ML bootstrap support (BS) ≥ 70%. Sequences generated in this study were deposited in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA).\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Phylogenetic Analyses\n\nThe final concatenated ITS-LSU-tef1 sequence dataset using both ML and Bayesian analyses contained 37 ingroup strains from five families (Amniculicolaceae, Lindgomytaceae, Lophiostomataceae, Sporormiaceae and Teratospharriaceae). The alignment comprised a total of 1936 characters including gaps (815 for LSU, 399 for ITS and 722 for tef1), of which 435 were parsimony informative (125 for LSU, 173 for ITS and 137 for tef1). The individual sequence datasets did not show any conflicts in the tree topologies for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, which allowed the three genes for the multi-locus analysis to be combined. The ML analysis showed similar tree topology and was congruent with that obtained in the Bayesian analysis. For the BI multi-locus analysis, a total of 2706 trees were sampled after the burn-in with a stop value of 0.01. The support values were slightly different with the two analysis methods: with BI, posterior probabilities being higher than the ML bootstrap support values. In our phylogenetic analysis, the family Amniculicolaceae formed a well-supported main clade (99% BS/1 PP) (Figure 1). All taxa in this family were split into two well-supported clades. The first one (99% BS/1 PP) included two accepted genera (Amniculicola, 96% BS/1 PP and Vargamyces, 91% BS/1 PP), plus another genus (81% BS/0.98 PP). We propose this one as the new Fouskomenomyces, comprising Fouskomenomyces cupreorufescens (basionym Spirosphaera cupreorufescens) and two of our strains (FMR 17,151 and FMR 16,958). The second main clade, corresponding to the genus Murispora (94% BS/1 PP), was represented by all previously described species (including the type species of the genus, M. rubicunda). Our strains FMR 17,248, FMR 17,251 and FMR 17,838 were placed into independent terminal branches, each one representing a new species for the genus and two new combinations, M. bromicola (basionym Pseudomassariosphaeria bromicola) and M. triseptata (basionym P. triseptata). Surprisingly, Pseudomassariosphaeria grandispora (formerly included in the Amniculicolaceae) fell into the Lopiostomataceae (96% BS/1 PP).\n\n3.2. Taxonomy\n\nAmniculicolaceae Y. Zhang ter, C.L.

However, in our phylogenetic study P. bromicola is clearly placed into the family Amniculicolaceae (transferred by us to the genus Murispora as M. bromicola earlier in this manuscript), whereas P. grandispora was located in the family Lophiostomataceae, phylogenetically close to Lophiostoma macrostomum and L. arundinis. The placement of P. grandispora into the Lophiostomataceae was previously suggested by Wang in 2007 [36], based on a molecular analysis using 28S rDNA, 18S rDNA and rpb2 gene. Consequently, we resurrected the name Massariosphaeria grandispora for this fungus.\n\nMassariosphaeria grandispora (Sacc.) Leuchtm., Sydowia 37: 172 (1984).

Discussion\n\nOf the three morpho-ecological groups of freshwater fungi (Ingoldian’s, aero-aquatic and facultative) only the latter two were addressed in this study. In our phylogenetic analysis, all of the Amniculicolaceae species clustered in a distinct sister clade to Lindgomycetae, which is similar to previous studies [16,17,18]. Most Aminiculicolaceae species are reported from freshwater habitats and are widely distributed across Austria, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, China, Hungary and Spain [15,16,17,18,34,37]. However, with exception of Murispora aquatica and M. triseptata (basionym Pseudomassariospaheria triseptata), all species of Murispora were isolated from terrestrial habitats such as dead terrestrial stems and dead and fallen twigs [14,15,16,17,18,35]. In this study, we have introduced three new species of Murispora collected from Spain in freshwater habitats. Thanks to the phenotypic characterization of several fungal isolates and to the subsequent phylogenetic analysis based on a concatenate database of the ITS-LSU-tef1 sequences, we have erected three new species of Murispora: M. asexualis, the unique species of the genus because it lacks a sexual morph; M. fissilispora, the first species of this genus to produce a holomorph in vitro, and M. navicularispora, which produces cinnamon-colored, broadly fusiform to navicular ascospores, features never seen in the genus before. In addition, we have proposed the new combinations M. bromicola (formerly P. bromicola) and M. triseptata (formerly P. triseptata), demonstrating that this genus is monophyletic. Consequently, we have enlarged the current concept of Murispora, including species with hyaline, navicular and transversally septate ascospores, or lacking a sexual morph. Our results also indicate that some morphological features, such as the size and shape of the ascospores, have less phylogenetic significance than previously proposed by other authors. Despite Spirosphaera cupreorufescens displaying features considered as typical of that genus, it was phylogenetically distant in our phylogeny (in the class Dothideomycetes) from the type species of the genus (Spirosphaera floriformis, in the class Leotiomycetes), and because S. cupreorufescens formed a strongly supported clade together with two of our strains, we have proposed the erection of the new genus Fouskomenomyces, to include Fouskomenomyces cupreorufescens (the type species of the genus) and the new species Fouskomenomyces mimiticus, both aero-aquatic conidial fungi. Finally, we have also resurrected Massariosphaeria grandispora, because in our phylogeny it was placed into the Lopiostomataceae instead of the Amniculicolaceae. To date, there have been few reports of fungi isolated from freshwater habitats in Spain, therefore this work represents an important contribution to the knowledge of the Spanish mycobiota in aquatic environments.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nV.M.-D. performed the experimental work, the phenotypic characterization of the isolates, as well as the DNA extraction and purification, gene sequencing and data processing for phylogenetic analysis, being one of the major contributors of this manuscript. A.M.S., because of their experience with fungal biology and taxonomy, supervised all steps of the experimental work by V.M.-D., collaborating in the description of the novel fungi and in the writing of chapters “Introduction” and “Discussion”, reviewing the draft several times. J.F.C.-L. supervised the experimental work too, especially those steps related to nucleotide sequencing of the molecular markers employed in this study, but also the nucleotide sequence alignment and the phylogenetic reconstructions, took the pictures that appear in the figures, contributed actively in the identification and the taxonomy of the fungal strains, gave useful suggestions to write the manuscript and reviewed the draft several times.
