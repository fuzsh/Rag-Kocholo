However, nearly all fungal cell walls contain chitin, which is also found in the exoskeletons of many invertebrate animals. In addition, both chytrid zoospores and animal sperm share in common the presence of a single posterior flagellum. As a result of these differences and extensive molecular sequence comparisons, animals and fungi are considered to be sister groups. Some scientists include animals and fungi in a common ancestor clade, called the opisthokont clade (opistho meaning posterior and kont meaning flagellum). The classification presented above reflects the division of fungi on the basis of phylogenetic relationships and is generally agreed upon. However, there remain many orders for which no general consensus has been reached regarding inclusion in classes, subclasses, or subphyla.\n\nDavid Moore"
