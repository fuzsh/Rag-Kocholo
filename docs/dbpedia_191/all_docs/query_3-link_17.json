Peridium 250–310 μm thick, to 600 μm thick near the apex, thinner at the base, comprising three types of cells; outer cells pseudoparenchymatous, small heavily pigmented thick-walled cells of textura epidermoidea, cells 0.6–1 × 6–10 μm diam., cell wall 5–9 μm thick; cells near the substrate less pigmented, composed of cells of textura prismatica, cell walls 1–3(−5) μm thick; inner cells less pigmented, comprised of hyaline to pale brown thin-walled cells, merging with pseudoparaphyses (Fig. 1c, d and e). Hamathecium of dense, long trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, ca. 1 μm broad, embedded in mucilage, hyaline, anastomosing and sparsely septate. Asci 140–220 × 13–17 μm (\\( \\bar{x} = { 165}.{3 } \\times { 15}.{6 }\\mu {\\text{m}} \\), n = 10), 8-spored, bitunicate, fissitunicate, cylindrical, with short pedicels, 15–25(−40) μm long, with a large and conspicuous ocular chamber (Fig. 1f and g). Ascospores 17.5–25 × 12.5–15(−20) μm (\\( \\bar{x} = { 21}.{5 } \\times { 13}.{6 }\\mu {\\text{m}} \\), n = 10), uniseriate to partially overlapping, ovoid or ellipsoidal, hyaline, 1-septate, not constricted at the septum, smooth-walled (Fig. 1h and i).\n\nAnamorph: none reported.\n\nMaterial examined: INDIA, Indian Ocean, Malvan (Maharashtra), on intertidal wood of Avicennia alba Bl., 30 Oct. 1981 (IMI 297769, holotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology Acrocordiopsis was formally established by Borse and Hyde (1989) as a monotypic genus represented by A. patilii based on its “conical or semiglobose superficial carbonaceous ascomata, trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical, bitunicate, 8-spored asci, and hyaline, 1-septate, obovoid or ellipsoid ascospores”. Acrocordiopsis patilii was first collected from mangrove wood (Indian Ocean) as a marine fungus, and a second marine Acrocordiopsis species was reported subsequently from Philippines (Alias et al. 1999). Acrocordiopsis is assigned to Melanommataceae (Melanommatales sensu Barr 1983) based on its ostiolate ascomata and trabeculate pseudoparaphyses (Borse and Hyde 1989). Morphologically, Acrocordiopsis is similar to Astrosphaeriella sensu stricto based on the conical ascomata and the brittle, carbonaceous peridium composed of thick-walled black cells with rows of palisade-like parallel cells at the rim area. Ascospores of Astrosphaeriella are, however, elongate-fusoid, usually brown or reddish brown and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath when young; as such they are readily distinguishable from those of Acrocordiopsis. A new family (Acrocordiaceae) was introduced by Barr (1987a) to accommodate Acrocordiopsis. This proposal, however, has been rarely followed and Jones et al. (2009) assigned Acrocordiopsis to Melanommataceae.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nAcrocordiopsis patilii nested within an unresolved clade within Pleosporales (Suetrong et al. 2009). Thus its familial placement is unresolved, but use of the Acrocordiaceae could be reconsidered with more data.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAcrocordiopsis, Astrosphaeriella sensu stricto, Mamillisphaeria, Caryospora and Caryosporella are morphologically similar as all have very thick-walled carbonaceous ascomata, narrow pseudoparaphyses in a gelatinous matrix (trabeculae) and bitunicate, fissitunicate asci. Despite their similarities, the shape of asci and ascospores differs (e.g. Mamillisphaeria has sac-like asci and two types of ascospores, brown or hyaline, Astrosphaeriella has cylindro-clavate asci and narrowly fusoid ascospores, both Acrocordiopsis and Caryosporella has cylindrical asci, but ascospores of Caryosporella are reddish brown). Therefore, the current familial placement of Acrocordiopsis cannot be determined. All generic types of Astrosphaeriella sensu stricto, Mamillisphaeria and Caryospora should be recollected and isolated for phylogenetic study.\n\nAigialus Kohlm. & S. Schatz, Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 85: 699 (1985). (Aigialaceae)\n\nGeneric description\n\nHabitat marine, saprobic. Ascomata mostly subglobose in front view, fusoid in sagittal section, rarely subglobose, scattered, immersed to erumpent, papillate, ostiolate, ostiole rounded or slit-like, periphysate.

Schatz, Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 85: 699 (1985). (Fig. 2)\n\nAscomata 1–1.25 mm high × 1–1.3 mm diam. in front view, 250–400 μm broad in sagittal section, vertically flattened subglobose, laterally compressed, scattered, immersed to semi-immersed, papillate, with an elongated furrow at the top of the papilla, wall black, carbonaceous, ostiolate, ostiole filled with branched or forked septate periphyses (Fig. 2a). Peridium 70–100 μm thick laterally, up to 150 μm thick at the apex, thinner at the base, comprising two cell types, outer layer composed of small heavily pigmented thick-walled pseudoparenchymatous cells, cells 1–2 μm diam., cell wall 2–5 μm thick, inner layer thin, composed of small hyaline cells (Fig. 2b). Hamathecium of dense, very long trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, 0.8–1.2 μm broad, embedded in mucilage, anastomosing and branching above the asci. Asci 450–640 × 22–35 μm (\\( \\bar{x} = 505 \\times 30\\mu m \\), n = 10), 8-spored, bitunicate, fissitunicate, cylindrical to cylindro-clavate, with a long furcate pedicel, 90–180 μm long, with a low truncate ocular chamber and a refractive apical apparatus (to 12 μm wide × 4 μm high) (Fig. 2e and f). Ascospores 75–95 × 15–26 μm (\\( \\bar{x} = 84.3 \\times 17.5\\mu m \\), n = 10), obliquely uniseriate and partially overlapping, broadly fusoid to fusoid with narrowly rounded ends in front view, flat on one side from side view (14–20 μm thick), yellowish brown, apical cells usually hyaline, muriform, with 14–17(−18) transversal septa, 1–3 longitudinal septa in most cells, slightly constricted at the septa, with a gelatinous cap at each end (Fig. 2c and d).\n\nAnamorph: none reported.\n\nMaterial examined: BELIZE, Wee-Wee Cay, on submerged wood of roots and branches of Rhizophora mangle L., Mar. 1983, leg. J. Kohlmeyer (NY, J.K. 4332b, isotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology Aigialus was formally established by Kohlmeyer and Schatz (1985) based on its immersed or semi-immersed ascomata with periphysate ostiole, trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, cylindrical and fissitunicate asci, and distinctive muriform ascospores with gelatinous sheath or caps. There are five accepted species in the genus, namely A. grandis, A. mangrovei Borse, A. parvus S. Schatz & Kohlm., A. rhizophorae Borse and A. striatispora K.D. Hyde (Jones et al. 2009). Aigialus was first assigned to the Melanommatales, but its familial status was uncertain (Kohlmeyer and Schatz 1985). Barr (1990b) included Aigialus in Massariaceae based on its conspicuous apical ring in the asci and ascospore characters, and this has subsequently been widely followed (Eriksson 2006; Hawksworth et al. 1995; Kirk et al. 2001; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007).\n\nPhylogenetic study The generic type of Aigialus (A. grandis) together with other three marine species, i.e. A. mangrovei, A. parvus as well as A. rhizophorae form a robust clade on the phylogenetic tree. Thus a new family, Aigialaceae, was introduced to accommodate Aigialus together with Ascocratera and Rimora (Suetrong et al. 2009).\n\nConcluding remarks The pleosporalean status of Aigialus has been phylogenetically verified, and the single branch containing Aigialus, Ascocratera and Rimora represents a familial rank of Aigialaceae (Suetrong et al. 2009).\n\nAmniculicola Yin.

Gaertn., 23 Jul. 2006 (HKU(M) 17515, isotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nAmniculicola is a freshwater genus which stains the woody substrate purple (Zhang et al. 2008c, 2009a, c). This genus appears only to be reported from Europe. A detailed description of the generic type was provided by Zhang et al. (2008c).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nThree species of Amniculicola cluster together with Anguillospora longissima, Spirosphaera cupreorufescens and Repetophragma ontariense as well as Pleospora rubicunda Niessl (current name Murispora rubicunda (Niessl) Y. Zhang ter, J. Fourn. & K.D. Hyde) and Massariosphaeria typhicola (P. Karst.) Leuchtm. (current name Neomassariosphaeria typhicola (P. Karst.) Yin. Zhang, J. Fourn. & K.D. Hyde). A new family, i.e. Amniculicolaceae, was introduced to accommodate these taxa (Zhang et al. 2008c, 2009a, c).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAll of the five teleomorphic taxa within Amniculicolaceae are from freshwater in Europe and their ascomata stain the woody substrate purple. Purple staining makes taxa of this family easily recognized in the field.\n\nAnomalemma Sivan., Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 81: 328 (1983).

Warbright? (K(M):143936, syntype, ex herb. C.E. Broome).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nSphaeria epochnii was first described and illustrated by Berkeley and Broome (1866) from Britain and the anamorphic stage is the hyphomycetous Epochniella fungorum. Sphaeria epochnii has subsequently been transferred to Melanomma (as M. epochnii (Berk. & Broome) Sacc.; Saccardo 1878a), Byssosphaeria (as B. epochnii (Berk. & Broome) Cooke; Massee 1887) and Chaetosphaeria (as C. epochnii (Berk. & Broome) Keissl.; Keissler 1922). The deposition of Sphaeria epochnii in Chaetosphaeria is obviously unacceptable, as Chaetosphaeria has unitunicate asci. Melanomma has been reported having Aposphaeria or Pseudospiropes anamorphs, which differs from Exosporiella (Sivanesan 1983). In addition, the presence of well developed prosenchymatous stroma in Sphaeria epochnii can also readily distinguish it from Melanomma (Sivanesan 1983).\n\nThe gregarious ascomata and formation of prosenchymatous stroma of Anomalemma resembles those of Cucurbitaria, but the pleosporaceous dictyosporous ascospores of Cucurbitaria readily distinguish it from Anomalemma epochnii. In addition, the pseudoparenchymatous peridium, fungicolous habitat and brown 1-septate ascospores, which later becoming 3-septate differ from any other pleosporalean genus. Thus a new genus, Anomalemma, was introduced to accommodate it (Sivanesan 1983). Anomalemma is presently monotypic.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAnomalemma epochnii certainly resembles Byssosphaeria in its ascomata clustering together in groups on closely intertwined hyphae and brown ascospores, and may well be included in this genus. Its fungicolous habitat, however, distinguishes it from Byssosphaeria.\n\nAppendispora K.D. Hyde, Sydowia 46: 29 (1994a). (?Didymellaceae)\n\nGeneric description\n\nHabitat terrestrial, saprobic.

L. Cai, CAI-1H31 (HKU(M) 10859, holotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nAscorhombispora was introduced as a monotypic genus from freshwater by Cai and Hyde (2007), and is characterized by superficial, coriaceous, non-stromatic ascomata, large, saccate asci; lack of interascal filaments and trapezoid (rhombic), 3-septate, dark brown to black ascospores with smaller end cells which are subhyaline to pale brown. Ascorhombispora is most comparable with Caryospora and Zopfia. But the globose to subglobose ascomata and thin peridium, saccate asci lacking interascal pseudoparaphyses, and the 3-septate, rhomboid ascospores with the paler end cells of Ascorhombispora differs from those of Caryospora (Cai and Hyde 2007).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on either SSU or LSU rDNA sequences indicated that Ascorhombispora aquatica belongs to Pleosporales, but its familial placement was left undetermined (Cai and Hyde 2007).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe sac-shaped asci and absence of pseudoparaphyses are uncommon in Pleosporales, especially among those from freshwater.\n\nAsteromassaria Höhn., Sber.

Petrak (L, 1004).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nIn this study we were unable to obtain the holotype, so we used a collection of Petrak’s. The main morphological characters of Asteromassaria are the medium- to large-sized, globose to depressed ascomata opening with a pore, clavate to oblong asci, narrowly cellular pseudoparaphyses, pale to dark brown, bipolar symmetric, mostly fusoid, distoseptate or euseptate ascospores (Barr 1993a). The bipolar symmetric ascospores of Asteromassaria can readily be distinguished from other genera of this family (Barr 1993a; Tanaka et al. 2005). Currently, it comprises 12 species (Tanaka et al. 2005; http://www.mycobank.org, 28-02-2009).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nAsteromassaria pulchra (Harkn.) Shoemaker & P.M. LeClair is basal to Morosphaeriaceae in the phylogenetic tree based on four genes, but its placement is influenced by taxon sampling that was different in several analyses.\n\nConcluding remarks Asteromassaria can be distinguished from other comparable genera, i.e. Pleomassaria and Splanchnonema by 1-septate and pale brown ascospores, thick-walled textura angularis peridium and Scolicosporium anamorphic stage (see under Pleomassaria).\n\nAstrosphaeriella Syd. & P.

Peridium 40–70 μm thick, carbonaceous and crisp, 1-layered, composed of very small dark brown thick-walled pseudoparenchymatous cells, cells 2–5 μm diam., cell wall 2–6 μm thick, in places at the base composed of hyaline cells of textura prismatica, cells 5 × 8 μm diam.

Kopf & Rogers, det. Miller (BISH 145726, as Astrosphaeriella fusispora Syd. & P. Syd.).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nAstrosphaeriella has been treated as a synonym of Microthelia (von Arx and Müller 1975), but the large conical ascomata, numerous trabeculate pseudoparaphyses and 1-septate and elongated ascospores of Astrosphaeriella all disagree with those of Microthelia (Hawksworth 1981). It was assigned to Platystomaceae by Barr (1990a) in Pleosporales or Melanommataceae by Kirk et al. (2001). Following a systematic study of Astrosphaeriella, only four species were accepted, i.e. A. aosimensis I. Hino & Katum., A. stellata, A. trochus (Penz. & Sacc.) D. Hawksw. and A. venezuelensis M.E. Barr & D. Hawksw. (Hawksworth 1981), and it was defined as a tropical genus, occurring exclusively on palms or bamboo. Astrosphaeriella stellata was selected as the type of Astrosphaeriella, and A. fusispora was regarded as a synonym of A. stellata (Hawksworth 1981). More taxa were subsequently added (Barr 1990a; Hawksworth and Boise 1985; Hyde and Fröhlich 1998), and the generic concept extended to include three elements: 1. typical semi-immersed to superficial ascomata with flattened base, cylindro-clavate asci with fusoid ascospores and trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, i.e. Astrosphaeriella sensu stricto (e.g. A. fusispora and A. vesuvius (Berk. & Broome) D. Hawksw. & Boise); 2. Trematosphaeria-like with rounded ascomata (e.g. A. africana D. Hawksw.); and 3. Massarina-like species with immersed ascomata (e.g. A. bakeriana (Sacc.) K.D. Hyde & J. Fröhl.) (Chen and Hsieh 2004; Tanaka and Harada 2005a; b). Currently, a broad generic concept of Astrosphaeriella is accepted, and 47 taxa are included in Astrosphaeriella.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on LSU and SSU nurDNA sequence data indicates that Astrosphaeriella is polyphyletic, and located in the basal region of the Pleosporales between Testudinaceae and Zopfiaceae/Delitschiaceae (Tanaka et al. 2009), or basal to Aigialaceae (Schoch et al. 2009). The genus is, however, clearly not related to Trematosphaeria as previously understood (Boise 1985).\n\nConcluding remarks Astrosphaeriella is currently polyphyletic and new collections of the different elements listed above are needed in order to understand the placement of various species. We suggest that some immersed bambusicolous species may belong in Tetraplospheariaceae.\n\nAsymmetricospora J. Fröhl. & K.D. Hyde, Sydowia 50: 183 (1998).

Because of the immersed ascomata, ostiole and peridium morphology, fissitunicate asci and trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, Asymmetricospora was assigned to Melanommataceae (sensu Barr 1990a; Fröhlich and Hyde 1998).\n\nMorphologically Asymmetricospora can be distinguished from its most comparable genus, Astrosphaeriella, by its ostiole, which is a simple opening without tissue differentiation, asymmetric ascospores, and the usually multi-loculate fruiting body (Fröhlich and Hyde 1998).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe placement of Asymmetricospora under Melanommataceae remains to be confirmed.\n\nBarria Z.Q.

Yuan (NY 92003, isotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nBarria was established by Yuan (1994) as a monotypic genus represented by B. piceae according to its “two-celled, pigmented ascospores, pseudoparenchymatous peridium and narrowly cellular pseudoparaphyses” thus differing in its combination of characters from all of the morphologically related dothideomycetous genera, such as Didymosphaeria, Didymopleella or Stegasphaeria. The taxon was considered to belong in Phaeosphaeriaceae. Ascomata and colour or shape of ascospores, however, readily distinguish it from other 1-septate Phaeosphaeriaceae genera, i.e. Didymella, Lautitia and Metameris (Yuan 1994). Barria piceae causes blight of spruce needles.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe status of Barria with its unusual verrucose ascospores and thick gel coating is uncertain. In many ways it resembles Belizeana, with its cylindrical asci, 1-septate, ellipsoid ascospores with sheath and verruculose surface (Kohlmeyer and Volkmann-Kohlmeyer 1987). However, the latter is a marine genus while Barria causes leaf blight of terrestrial Picea (Yuan 1994). The placement in Phaeosphaeriaceae seems logical based on the parasitic life style, thin and simple peridium, wide cellular pseudoparaphyses and brown ascospores. However, molecular data are needed to confirm this.\n\nBelizeana Kohlm. & Volkm.-Kohlm., Bot. Mar. 30: 195 (1987).

Kohlmeyer No. 4209, paratype).Notes\n\nMorphology\n\nBelizeana was formally established to accommodate B. tuberculata, an obligate marine fungus, which is characterized by verrucose ascospores (Kohlmeyer and Volkmann-Kohlmeyer 1987). Belizeana tuberculata can be assigned to Pleosporaceae (Pleosporales) according to Luttrell’s (1973) treatment and keys of von Arx and Müller (1975), but cannot resolve a proper family based on Barr (1979a, 1983). The unique morphology together with obligate marine habitat makes B. tuberculata readily distinguishable from all other taxa of Pleosporaceae.\n\nPhylogenetic study None.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe ascospores of Belizeana tuberculata are most comparable with those of Acrocordiopsis patilii, but the superficial conical ascomata of A. patilii are distinct from B. tuberculata. Thus, the familial placement of Belizeana is still undetermined.\n\nBiatriospora K.D. Hyde & Borse, Mycotaxon 26: 263 (1986).

Polar refractive chambers can also occur in other marine fungi, such as Lulworthia and Aigialus. The chambers have been proposed as important for spore attachment to substrates in a liquid environment (Hyde and Borse 1986).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nMultigene phylogenetic analysis indicated that Biatriospora marina forms a separate branch, sister to other families of Pleosporales (Suetrong et al. 2009), and maybe related to species in Roussoella (Plate 1).\n\nConcluding remarks The familial status of Biatriospora can not be determined.\n\nBicrouania Kohlm. & Volkm.-Kohlm., Mycol.

Jones et al. (2009) agreed that it cannot be placed in Didymosphaeria based on its superficial ascomata, but that it does have many similarities with Didymosphaeria.

Sheridan (CBS 107.79, isotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nBimuria novae-zelandiae was first isolated from soil of a barley field in New Zealand (Hawksworth et al. 1979). Based on B. novae-zelandiae, the genus is characterized by a very thin peridium, mostly 2-spored and fissitunicate asci as well as the muriform, dark brown, verrucose ascospores (Hawksworth et al. 1979). Because of its unique morphological characters, the familial placement of this genus has been debatable and it has been placed in Pleosporaceae (Hawksworth et al. 1979), in Phaeosphaeriaceae (Barr 1987b) and in Melanommataceae (Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007).\n\nMorphologically, Bimuria is most comparable with some superficially similar or allied genera, in particular Montagnula (Hawksworth et al. 1979). However, the thick carbonaceous peridium distinguishes Montagnula from that of Bimuria (Hawksworth et al. 1979). In addition, the ascospores of Montagnula are discharged forcibly through the ostiole instead of forming a mass outside of the ostiole as in Bimuria (Hawksworth et al. 1979). Ascomauritiana lignicola V.M. Ranghoo & K.D. Hyde has somewhat similar ascospores in 4-spored asci, but this taxon has unitunicate asci (Ranghoo and Hyde 1999). The morphological characters of Bimuria, such as ascospore release and large, thick-walled ascospores may be an adaptation to its soil-borne habitat (Hawksworth et al. 1979).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nBimuria novae-zelandiae was found to be closely related to Phaeodothis winteri (Niessl) Aptroot (syn. Didymosphaerella opulenta (De Not.) Checa & M.E. Barr) and Montagnula opulenta (De Not.) Aptroot in analysis of combined sequences, i.e. SSU rDNA, LSU rDNA, RPB2 and TEF1 sequences (Schoch et al. 2006, 2009). These two species had been included by Barr (2001) in her new family Montagnulaceae.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe agree with Barr (2001) and include the genus in Montagnulaceae based on both morphological and phylogenetic characters.\n\nBricookea M.E.

Bricookea was morphologically assigned to Phaeosphaeriaceae. Holm (1957) checked the authentic collections from North America and type material from Europe, and observed that the ascospores of collections from North America were significantly larger than those from the type material from Sweden. Thus, Shoemaker and Babcock (1989a) considered that the collections from North America represented a new species, which they introduced as B. barrae Shoemaker & C.E. Babc. Although the short slit-like ostiole has previously been reported (Shoemaker and Babcock 1989a), it is inconspicuous in the type specimen from Sweden. Currently, only two species are accommodated in this genus.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe knob-shaped pedicel, slit-like ostiole, hyaline ascospores as well as the herbaceous substrate all disagree with any current pleosporalean family.

Keit (K(M):108784, holotype, as Sphaeria keitii Berk. & Broome).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nByssosphaeria was introduced by Cooke and Plowright (1879) based on its superficial ascomata seated on a “tomentose subiculum of interwoven threads”, which includes various species in Sphaeria and Byssisedae, and was validly typified by B. keitii (Cooke 1878). Byssosphaeria keitii was treated as a synonym of B. schiedermayeriana (Fuckel) M.E. Barr by Sivanesan (1971), and B. schiedermayeriana exclusively occurs in tropical regions or greenhouse environments in temperate regions (Barr 1984). Morphologically, B. keitii is characterized by its large ascomata with orange to reddish plain apices, and is closely related to B. rhodomphala (Berk.) Cooke (Barr 1984).\n\nFor a long time, Byssosphaeria was assigned to Herpotrichia sensu lato, and Byssosphaeria schiedermayeriana was renamed as H. schiedermayeriana Fuckel (von Arx and Müller 1975; Bose 1961; Luttrell 1973; Müller and von Arx 1962; Sivanesan 1971). After studying Herpotrichia in North America, Barr (1984) accepted a relatively narrow generic concept, Herpotrichia sensu stricto, and revived Byssosphaeria; this proposal is supported by phylogenetic study (Mugambi and Huhndorf 2009b). Currently Byssosphaeria comprises 32 species (http://www.mycobank.org, 08-01-2009).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nThe monophyletic nature of Byssosphaeria is well demonstrated, as well as its familial status in Melanommataceae (Mugambi and Huhndorf 2009b).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nOrange and greenish plain apices exist in the specimen we examined, which is different from records as “orange, bright or dull reddish plain apices” by Barr (1984). This might be because different specimens have different colours, or there may be a variation of apical colour within a single species, as both orange and green can coexist on the same ascoma (see Fig. 17a). The coloured apical rim, together with the trabeculate pseudoparaphyses as well as the presence of subiculum make Byssosphaeria readily distinguishable from other morphologically comparable genera, e.g. Herpotrichia and Keissleriella (Hyde et al. 2000).\n\nCalyptronectria Speg., Anal.

Müll., Sept. 1906, Spegazzini (LPS 1209, holotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nCalyptronectria is a relatively poorly studied genus, which was formally established based on C. argentinensis Speg. and C. platensis, with C. platensis being chosen as the generic type (Spegazzini 1909). Morphologically, Calyptronectria is characterized by its immersed ascomata, trabeculate pseudoparaphyses and hyaline, muriform ascospores as well as its peridium that turns reddish brown in KOH (Rossman et al. 1999) (not shown here). Subsequently, C. indica Dhaware was introduced from India, and Barr (1983) transferred Teichospora ohiensis Ellis & Everh. to Calyptronectria as C. ohiensis (Ellis & Everh.) M.E. Barr. However, this proposal is inappropriate as the type specimen of T. ohiensis is “unitunicate” (Barr 1983; Rossman et al. 1999). Subsequently, Rossman et al. (1999) transferred Calyptronectria ohiensis to Thyridium (as T. ohiense (Ellis & Everh.) Rossman & Samuels).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe immersed ascomata, trabeculate pseudoparaphyses, bitunicate asci, hyaline and muriform ascospores as well as the reaction of peridium to KOH (turns reddish brown) make it distinguishable from all other reported genera (Rossman et al. 1999). Thus Calyptronectria is a morphologically well defined genus.\n\nCarinispora K.D. Hyde, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 110: 97 (1992).

Caryosporella was originally assigned to Massariaceae despite several major differences, such as the superficial ascomata, reddish brown ascospores (Kohlmeyer 1985). Subsequently, Caryosporella was assigned to Melanommataceae (Eriksson 2006; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nSuetrong et al. (2009) showed that a single isolate of Caryosporella rhizophorae does not reside in Pleosporales, but is related to Lineolata rhizophorae (Kohlm. & E. Kohlm.) Kohlm. & Volkm.-Kohlm. and placed in Dothideomycetidae incertae sedis.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nAs an obligate marine fungus, the familial placement of Caryosporella rhizophorae is uncertain but it may not belong to Pleosporales.\n\nChaetomastia (Sacc.)

P.A. Karsten (H, FFE 825, kleptotype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nChaetomastia was introduced by Saccardo (1883) as a subgenus of Melanomma, and five species were included, i.e. M. canescens Speg., M. cucurbitarioides Speg., M. hirtulum (P. Karst.) Sacc., M. hispidulum Sacc. and M. pilosellum P. Karst. Berlese (1890) promoted it to genus rank. Subsequently, Chaetomastia hirtula (P. Karst.) Berl. was selected as the lectotype species of the genus (Clements and Shear 1931). Chaetomastia has been regarded as having unitunicate asci (Eriksson and Hawksworth 1986, 1998; Eriksson 1999). However its bitunicate status was confirmed by Holm (1957). Holm (1957) treated C. hirtula as Melanomma hirtulum (P. Karst.) Sacc., and Leuchtmann (1985) transferred this species to Montagnula sensu lato based on the ascospore morphology and the hyphae surrounding the ascomata. Barr (1987b) suggested that ascoma, peridium structure and ascospore characters pointed Montagnula sensu stricto to Phaeosphaeriaceae, while the characters of ascomata and peridium structure of Chaetomastia were thought to fit the definition of Dacampiaceae (Barr 1987b). In particular, the peridium and ascospore characters of C. hirtula are comparable with those of the generic type of Massariosphaeria (M. phaeospora). Thus, Barr (1989c) accepted Massariosphaeria sensu stricto and assigned the phragmosporous species of Massariosphaeria sensu lato to Chaetomastia.\n\nBarr (2002) later assigned Chaetomastia to Teichosporaceae based on its saprobic or hypersaprobic lifestyle, occurring on woody stems and peridium structure, and this is widely followed (Eriksson 2006; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007). Currently, 11 species are accepted in this genus (http://www.indexfungorum.org/).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nFamilial placement of Chaetomastia is undetermined currently but has been included in the Teichosporaceae by authoritative sources (Eriksson 2006; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007) or the Dacampiaceae (http://www.indexfungorum.org/).\n\nChaetoplea (Sacc.)

Based on the differences in ascomata, peridium structure, pseudoparaphyses as well as its anamorphic stage, Chaetoplea was maintained as a separate genus (Barr 1990b; Yuan and Barr 1994). Chaetoplea sensu lato was accepted by Barr (1990b), which included some species of Teichospora as well as the subgenus Pleospora subg.

A relatively narrow concept of Pleospora was accepted by Crivelli (1983), and four species was assigned under the separate genus Cilioplea, viz. C. coronata, C. genisticola (Fautrey & Lambotte) Crivelli, C. kansensis (Ellis & Everh.) Crivelli and C. nivalis (Niessl) Crivelli. Subsequently, another six species were added (Barr 1990b, 1992b). Currently, ten species are included under Cilioplea.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nNone.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe most striking character of Cilioplea is its setose papilla, which has been shown to have no phylogenetic significance in Lentitheciaceae (Zhang et al. 2009a). Cilioplea was assigned under Lophiostomataceae (Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007), but there is little morphological similarity with the Lophiostomataceae sensu stricto (Zhang et al. 2009a). Thus its familial placement needs further study.\n\nCrivellia Shoemaker & Inderb., in Inderbitzin, Shoemaker, O’Neill, Turgeon & Berbee, Can. J. Bot. 84: 1308 (2006).

Jaklitsch (UBC F14995, epitype).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nCrivellia was separated from Pleospora and introduced as a new genus by Inderbitzin et al. (2006) based on their differences in ascospore morphology and anamorphic stages. Crivellia is characterized by having small- to medium-sized ascomata, and yellow, 3-septate ascospores with one or two vertical septa in central cells. Its Brachycladium anamorphic stage with phragmosporous conidia also differs from that of Stemphylium, which is the anamorphic stage of Pleospora (Inderbitzin et al. 2006). Currently, two species are included within Crivellia, i.e. C. homothallica Inderb. & Shoemaker and C. papaveracea.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nCrivellia papaveracea was shown to be closely related to some species of Alternaria, and its pleosporaceous status was confirmed following molecular studies (Inderbitzin et al. 2006).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nCrivellia seems to belong to Pleosporaceae, and may be closely related to Pleospora.\n\nDecaisnella Fabre, Annls Sci.

Peridium 70–90 μm thick at sides, thicker near the apex, comprising two types of cells; part immersed in host tissue, outer layer pseudoparenchymatous, 55–65 μm thick, pigmented, inner layer composed of lightly pigmented to hyaline thin-walled compressed cells, 15–23 μm thick, cells 3.5–7 μm diam., part above host tissue heavily pigmented covered by clypeus tissues (Fig. 25b). Hamathecium of dense, long, cellular pseudoparaphyses, 1.5–3 μm broad, rarely septate, embedded in mucilage. Asci 150–200 × 15–25(−33) μm (\\( \\bar{x} = 181 \\times 20.6\\mu m \\), n = 10), (2-)4-spored, bitunicate, fissitunicate, broadly cylindrical, with a short, thick, furcate pedicel which is 20–40 μm long, no apical apparatus observed (Fig. 25e). Ascospores 37–45 × 12–17 μm (\\( \\bar{x} = 43 \\times 15\\mu m \\), n = 10), uniseriate and sometimes slightly overlapping, oblong with broadly rounded ends, dark brown, verrucose or smooth, 7–9 transverse septa and 1–3 longitudinal septa in some of the cells, no constriction at the septa (Fig. 25c and d).\n\nAnamorph: none reported.\n\nMaterial examined: GERMANY, Valsalpe in der Ramsau, Bayer, Alpen, on Rhamnus pumila Turra., Jul. 1913, Karl Arnold (NY2082, syntype as Teichospora megalocarpa Rehm).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nDecaisnella was formally established by Fabre (1879), but was treated as a synonym of Teichospora by Saccardo (1883). This was followed by several mycologists over a long time. The main morphological differences between Decaisnella and Teichospora include the size and septation of ascospores, shape of ascomata, structure of peridium and type of pseudoparaphyses (Barr 1986). Thus Barr (1986) revived Decaisnella and assigned it to Massariaceae based on the shape of ascomata and large, distoseptate ascospores. Currently, 15 species are accepted under Decaisnella (http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx). Neither the size of ascomata nor the ascospore characters have proven sufficient to place taxa at the family level in Pleosporales (Zhang et al. 2009a), and therefore familial placement of Decaisnella remains uncertain.\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nDecaisnella formosa resided in the clade of Lophiostomataceae and in proximity to Lophiostoma macrostomoides De Not. (Plate 1).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe muriform ascospores, saprobic life style and 4-spored asci point Decaisnella spectabilis to Montagnulaceae, but this can only be confirmed following a molecular phylogenetic study.\n\nDelitschia Auersw., Hedwigia 5: 49 (1866).

Krieger (L, 1950).\n\nNotes\n\nMorphology\n\nDelitschia was established by Auerswald (1866), and assigned to Sphaeriaceae. It was considered to be closely related to Sordariaceae and Amphisphaeriaceae. Winter (1887) assigned Delitschia under Sordariaceae, and this placement is followed in several subsequent studies (Griffiths 1901; Kirschstein 1911). Cain (1934) suggested that Delitschia might belong in Pleosporaceae, and this proposal was supported by Moreau (1953) and Dennis (1968). Finally, Munk (1957) established Sporormiaceae (Pseudosphaeriales), and Delitschia was assigned therein. Luck-Allen and Cain (1975) reviewed and redefined the genus as having bitunicate asci, pigmented and 1-septate ascospores with an elongated germ slit in each cell and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, and in particular, the coprophilous habitat. Luck-Allen and Cain (1975) accepted 46 species. Subsequently, some wood-inhabiting species were also described (Hyde and Steinke 1996; Romero and Samuels 1991). Three genera, i.e. Delitschia, Ohleriella and Semidelitschia were separated from Sporormiaceae, and a new family, Delitschiaceae, was introduced by Barr (2000) to accommodate them. Delitschiaceae is characterized by a periphysate ostiole, wide endotunicate asci with a wide ocular chamber and ascospores having cells with germ slits. Delitschiaceae has been subsequently accepted (Eriksson 2006; Lumbsch and Huhndorf 2007).\n\nThe genus comprises 83 names (Index Fungorum) and is estimated to comprise 51 species (Kirk et al. 2008). Keys to Delitschia can be found in Luck-Allen and Cain (1975) and Hyde and Steinke (1996).\n\nPhylogenetic study\n\nDelitschia didyma and D. winteri (W. Phillips & Plowr.) Sacc. form a robust phylogenetic clade within Delitschiaceae, which is basal to other members of Pleosporales (Kruys et al. 2006; Schoch et al. 2006) except for Massariaceae (Voglmayr and Jaklitsch 2011). This might indicate its early derivation (Zhang et al. 2009a).\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nMorphologically, Delitschia is a well defined genus, and each cell of the ascospore has a full length germ slit. Currently, most species of this genus are coprophilous, although a few species are reported from wood (Hyde and Steinke 1996; Luck-Allen and Cain 1975). Whether the lignicolous habitat is an important character that might separate these taxa from the main coprophilous group, needs to be addressed, however, the morphological characters are similar.\n\nDidymosphaeria Fuckel, Jb. nassau.
