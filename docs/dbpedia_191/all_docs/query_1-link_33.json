This has been necessary because each new system or each modification proved to be, or was thought to be, inadequate after a more or less short period of time. The inadequacies have been of two general classes, those inherent in the employment of unsound principles of classification and those that automatically came into being when new kinds of microsporidia were discovered or old taxa were recharacterized."
