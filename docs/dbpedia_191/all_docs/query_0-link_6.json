Cercospora zeina is one of the causative pathogens, but population genomics analysis of C. zeina is lacking. We conducted whole-genome Illumina sequencing of a representative set of 30 C. zeina isolates from Kenya and Uganda (East Africa) and Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa (Southern Africa). Selection of the diverse set was based on microsatellite data from a larger collection of the pathogen. Pangenome analysis of the C. zeina isolates was done by (1) de novo assembly of the reads with SPAdes, (2) annotation with BRAKER, and (3) protein clustering with OrthoFinder. A published long-read assembly of C. zeina ({\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467) from Zambia was included and annotated using the same pipeline. This analysis revealed 790 non-shared accessory and 10,677 shared core orthogroups (genes) between the 31 isolates. Accessory gene content was largely shared between isolates from all countries, with a few genes unique to populations from Southern Africa (32) or East Africa (6). There was a significantly higher proportion of effector genes in the accessory secretome (44%) compared to the core secretome (24%). PCA, ADMIXTURE, and phylogenetic analysis using a neighbor-net network indicated a population structure with a geographical subdivision between the East African isolates and the Southern African isolates, although gene flow was also evident. The small pangenome and partial population differentiation indicated recent dispersal of C. zeina into Africa, possibly from 2 regional founder populations, followed by recurrent gene flow owing to widespread maize production across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nKeywords: crop pathogen, pangenome, gray leaf spot, population genomics, Cercospora, maize, corn\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of agriculture has shifted the co-evolution of plants and pathogens. In large parts of the world, diverse environments containing a variety of plant species have been replaced with dense, near identical monocultures in similar, artificially maintained environments across different continents (McDonald and Stukenbrock 2016; Corredor-Moreno and Saunders 2020). This has favored crop pathogens to evolve more rapidly and with more virulence than in wild systems, and each time host resistance is overcome, they more easily spread through the largely homogeneous and interconnected global agricultural systems (McDonald and Stukenbrock 2016; Möller and Stukenbrock 2017; Corredor-Moreno and Saunders 2020). This makes pathogen evolution an increasingly important consideration for crop disease management.\n\nGray leaf spot (GLS) is considered as one of the top 3 maize foliar fungal diseases globally, however, it has remained an understudied plant-pathosystem (Ward et al. 1999; Savary et al. 2019). GLS was first identified in the USA as a maize fungal disease where infection by the Dothideomycete fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis causes rectangular tan lesions in the maize leaves (Tehon and Daniels 1925). Through AFLP profiles and ITS sequencing, it was determined that C. zeae-maydis represents a species complex: C. zeae-maydis groups I and II (Wang et al. 1998). These groups were confirmed to be sister species using a multigene phylogeny, and subsequently, C. zeae-maydis group II was described as a distinct species, renamed as Cercospora zeina (Dunkle and Levy 2000; Crous et al. 2006). Both C. zeina and C. zeae-maydis are present in the USA (Wang et al. 1998), Brazil (Brunelli et al. 2008), and China (Liu and Xu 2013), but in African countries, only C. zeina has been identified as a causal pathogen (Meisel et al. 2009; Nsibo et al. 2021). Having first been reported in Africa in 1988 from South Africa (Ward et al. 1999), GLS has since been reported in Cameroon, DR Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (Ward et al. 1999; Dunkle and Levy 2000).\n\nDespite the global impact of GLS, little has been resolved about the evolutionary history of C. zeina. Early population genetic studies found highly similar AFLP results between C. zeina isolates from African countries and from the USA (Dunkle and Levy 2000). Similarly, AFLP analysis of C. zeina isolates from Africa, the USA, and Brazil also found very low levels of genetic diversity within and between those regions (Brunelli et al. 2008). Low genetic diversity is expected after a genetic bottleneck, which would be the case if the population on a new continent was founded by a limited number of invasive isolates. This lack of differentiation between C. zeina genotypes on separate continents suggested that they shared a recent origin (Dunkle and Levy 2000), but it is unresolved whether the ancestral population was from the African continent or the American continent. In contrast, a large-scale microsatellite analysis with better resolution of genetic variation among 964 African isolates of C. zeina found that the African population, overall, had high levels of genetic diversity and was structured in distinct geographical clusters (Nsibo et al. 2021). However, no significant difference between the level of genetic diversity in each African cluster was found that could indicate an ancestral population (Nsibo et al. 2021). Alternatively to a bottleneck in invasive isolates, there could have been an earlier bottleneck in the ancestral population of C. zeina if its progenitor made a single shift to the maize host, as has occurred with the shifting of Magnaporthe oryzae to the rice host from Setaria millet (Couch et al. 2005).\n\nThe population structure found between isolates of C. zeina from different regions could be further investigated using whole-genome comparisons and evaluating gene presence–absence variation. The first whole-genome sequence for C. zeina was determined from an African isolate {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 using Illumina technology (Wingfield et al. 2017), and improved upon with a PacBio assembly (Wingfield et al. 2022). The genome of a C. zeina isolate from China is also now available and was determined with a nanopore assembly (Cheng et al. 2023).\n\nThe presence–absence variation of chromosomal fragments and genes represents an important component of the genomic diversity of many filamentous plant pathogens (Badet and Croll 2020). In fungal species exhibiting such presence–absence variation, each individual genome contains “core” genes, shared by all members of the species, and “accessory” genes, which are variable among genotypes (McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2019). The complete genome content of the species, defined as the “pangenome”, then consists of the core genes and the set of accessory genes present among the individual isolates in the pangenome (McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2019). Assembling pathogen pangenomes to capture this component of the genomic diversity can therefore give informative insight into the evolutionary potential of a species.\n\nSeveral methods have been developed to capture the pangenome variation of fungal pathogen species: either by alignment of de novo genome assemblies or by mapping reads to a reference genome followed by de novo assembly of unmapped reads to build a pangenome (Potgieter et al. 2020; Tettelin and Medini 2020). While more computationally expensive, the former approach using individual de novo assemblies has the advantage of resulting in more complete sequences, especially in genomes which contain many repetitive elements, as is the case in C. zeina (Wingfield et al. 2022).\n\nThe functions of the accessory component in a pathogen are shaped by its particular evolutionary history (Badet and Croll 2020). This is often host adaptation, but could also be environmental adaptation. There are many examples of accessory regions contributing to pathogenicity of fungal plant pathogens and being enriched for effectors (Möller and Stukenbrock 2017; Bertazzoni et al. 2018). Examples in the Dothideomycetes are the T-toxin biosynthesis cluster in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Condon et al. 2013), and the AvrLM11 effector of the Brassica pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans (Balesdent et al. 2013). The pangenome of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis had a greater proportion of accessory genes in the nonpathogenic isolates than in the pathogenic isolates (Gourlie et al. 2022). The relative size of the accessory component in a pathogen is associated with increases in overall genetic diversity, e.g. sexual recombination, or decreases, e.g. population bottlenecks (Badet and Croll 2020). In the higher range, the percentage of accessory genes in the pangenome of the wheat pathogens, P. tritici-repentis and Zymoseptoria tritici, was 56% (Gourlie et al. 2022) and 42% (Plissonneau et al. 2018), respectively. On the lower range of accessory genes, the percentage of accessory genes ranged from 10 to 20% in the model fungal species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans (McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2019). Exceptionally low proportions were found in the nonagricultural pathogens Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae (2% accessory) and Microbotryum silenes-dioicae (0.5% accessory) (Hartmann et al. 2018).\n\nThere is currently a lack of population genomics analysis of C. zeina at the whole-genome level. Whole-genome data will facilitate informative genome comparisons in terms of polymorphisms and gene content variation within C. zeina subpopulations in Africa. Conducting a pangenome study of C. zeina will produce a useful resource by identifying and functionally annotating the currently unknown accessory genes. As reviewed above, functions related to C. zeina's adaptation, such as effectors, are expected to be enriched in the accessory genes and can be captured by this resource. This study will focus on the C. zeina population in Africa. The GLS disease burden is especially relevant in Africa, as the maize host is a staple food crop and measured yield losses can be up to 65% (Ward et al. 1999). Previous resources created with the African population, namely the comprehensive isolate collection and microsatellite data (Nsibo et al. 2021) and access to a high-quality C. zeina reference genome assembled with long-read data (Wingfield et al. 2022), can now be built on for a population genetics comparison using whole-genome data. In this study, we set out to characterize variation in genome content and SNP-based population structure among isolates of C. zeina isolated from maize fields in the East and Southern African geographical regions.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nSelection of C. zeina isolates\n\nA subset of 30 diverse C. zeina isolates were selected from a total of 1,002 isolates previously isolated from 5 African countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, and Kenya) (Muller et al. 2016; Nsibo et al. 2021). To facilitate the selection, the R package, poppr (Kamvar et al. 2014), was used to estimate the pairwise genetic distance between the isolates based on Bruvo's distance (Bruvo et al. 2004) using previously generated microsatellite data (Supplementary Table 2 of Nsibo et al. (2021)). The pair of isolates with the largest pairwise genetic distance was used as a starting point for the selection. The isolate with the greatest distance to the previously selected isolates was found by taking the pairwise distances between a potential addition and each of the previous selected isolates, and then using a numpy array (van der Walt et al. 2011) to find the isolate where the minimum of the pairwise distances was greater than the minimum of other potential isolates. This would also ensure that no clones were selected. The numpy loop was repeated until 30 isolates were selected across the geographical regions.\n\nTo ensure all geographical regions were represented, a maximum of 6 isolates were considered for each country of origin, namely Uganda, Kenya, Zambia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. The exception was Zambia, as the Zambian isolates consisted of a single phylogenetic cluster with a greater proportion of clones (Nsibo et al. 2021). Therefore, only 3 Zambian isolates were selected, and the isolate set was complemented with an additional 2 South African isolates and 1 Kenyan isolate (the countries which provided the most migrants in Nsibo et al. (2021)). There were no clones (based on microsatellite data) in the final set of C. zeina isolates. A “reference genome”, determined previously with PacBio sequencing (Wingfield et al. 2022), for the C. zeina isolate {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 (Meisel et al. 2009) from Zambia, was also included in this study bringing the total number of isolates to 31. The C. zeina PacBio reference genome (NCBI Accession # MVDW02) consisted of 17 nuclear contigs, which were used in this study, and 5 small contigs of nonprotein coding and mitochondrial sequences, which were excluded from further analyses.\n\nGenome sequencing, assembly, and annotation\n\nAll C. zeina isolates from Nsibo et al. (2021) were maintained as glycerol stocks. The glycerol stocks of the selected isolates were revitalized on V8 media and maintained until sufficient biomass was obtained for DNA extractions. DNA was extracted from freeze-dried mycelium using the protocol described in Duong et al. (2013) and quantified with a Qubit 4 fluorometer. DNA libraries were constructed and 150 bp paired-end Illumina sequencing was done by the Max Planck-Genome-centre (Cologne, Germany). The sequenced reads were assessed for quality using FastQC (RRID:SCR_014583) (Andrews 2019). Low quality bases below a QV of 20 were masked instead of trimmed as a quality control measure (Yun and Yun 2014). No singleton reads were used.\n\nIndividual de novo assemblies were made from the selected 30 C. zeina isolates using SPAdes (RRID:SCR_000131) (Prjibelski et al. 2020). SPAdes was set to use the default k-mer sizes and to run its optional MismatchCorrector module. The quality and completeness of each genome assembly was assessed with QUAST (RRID:SCR_001228) (v5.0.2) (Gurevich et al. 2013) and BUSCO using the Dothideomycetes lineage dataset (RRID:SCR_015008) (v5.4.3) (Simão et al. 2015), respectively.\n\nThe 30 de novo assembled genomes and the C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 reference genome were, for the sake of consistency, annotated using the same BRAKER (RRID:SCR_018964) (v2.1.6) pipeline (Hoff et al. 2019; Brůna et al. 2021). The pipeline used SAMTOOLS (Li et al. 2009), BAMTOOLS (Barnett et al. 2011), and GENEMARK (Ter-Hovhannisyan et al. 2008). The parameters for AUGUSTUS (Stanke et al. 2006) were trained using RNA alignments as extrinsic evidence (Stanke et al. 2008; Lomsadze et al. 2014). The RNA-seq data (Swart et al. 2017) was obtained from in planta samples of field-grown maize infected with C. zeina ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE94442\",\"term_id\":\"94442\"}}GSE94442) and in vitro samples of {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 C. zeina cultures grown on various media ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE90705\",\"term_id\":\"90705\"}}GSE90705).\n\nGene content comparison\n\nThe gene content of the 31 C. zeina isolates were compared by using Orthofinder (Emms and Kelly 2015) to group the predicted proteins from each isolate into orthologous groups of genes (orthogroups). For genes which had more than 1 transcript predicted, the protein from the longest transcript was used. Orthogroups which were present in all 31 isolates were classified as containing the core sequences, and orthogroups which were absent from 1 to 29 genomes were classified as containing the accessory sequences.\n\nThe sets of isolates sharing present/absent orthogroups were visualized as an UpSet plot (Lex et al. 2014) using the R package, UpSetR (Conway et al. 2017). The pan- and core-genome accumulation curves were calculated using the R script from Méric et al. (2014). A custom GNU Awk (RRID:SCR_018211) script was used to convert the orthogroup table produced by ORTHOFINDER into a presence/absence matrix to use as input for the R scripts. The median values of the accumulation curve iterations were fitted to a power law regression in R to determine whether the pangenome was open or closed (Tettelin et al. 2008).\n\nThe orthogroups were annotated with protein domains and GO terms using InterProScan v5.29 (RRID:SCR_005829) (Jones et al. 2014). One protein sequence from each orthogroup was selected. Putative protein identities and functions of each orthogroup representative was determined by BLASTP with Diamond (Buchfink et al. 2015) against the NCBI nr database, which also included C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 proteins (NCBI Assembly MVDW01; Wingfield et al. (2017)).\n\nGO terms enriched in the accessory orthogroups compared to the core orthogroups were determined using topGO (RRID:SCR_014798) (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer 2021). The weight01 algorithm was used to make the GO graph, and the Fisher test was used to test for significance.\n\nThe InterProScan THHM and signal-P databases also allowed the identification of secreted proteins, defined as having been annotated with a eukaryotic signal-P domain, but without a transmembrane domain. Effectors present in the orthogroups of secreted proteins were predicted with EFFECTOR-P (Sperschneider and Dodds 2022). The proportion of the effectors in the core orthogroups and the proportion in the accessory orthogroups were compared in R with a 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction.\n\nThe distance between the predicted genes and the nearest transposable elements (TEs) annotated in the C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 reference genome (Wingfield et al. 2022) were calculated with the “closest” tool in BEDTools (RRID:SCR_006646) (Quinlan and Hall 2010). Using R, the median distance of the core genes to the nearest TE and the median distance of the accessory genes to the nearest TE were calculated, and the significance of the difference between the core and accessory was calculated using a 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test.\n\nSNP calling\n\nPaired alignments of the Illumina reads from each C. zeina isolate were made against the C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 PacBio reference genome with BWA MEM (Li and Durbin 2009). SNPs and indels were called using GATK (RRID:SCR_001876) HaplotypeCaller. This was done by implementing the GVCF workflow, and the parameters were set to use a ploidy of 1.\n\nDue to the lack of pre-existing C. zeina SNP data, SNP calls were hard-filtered using GATK SelectVariants to remove low quality SNPs of SOR > 3, MQ < 45, DP < 10, and DP > 2006. The distributions of these metrics were visualized to assess the filtering. The indels were likewise filtered to remove sites of QUAL < 30, FS > 100, and SOR > 6. The SNPs were further filtered to retain only the biallelic sites without missing data. This filtered SNP dataset was used for the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC) analysis (see below).\n\nThe SNP dataset was further filtered for the PCA with Eigensoft, ADMIXTURE, and phylogenetic analyses (see below) to remove SNPs that were present in only 1 isolate, by applying a minimum allele frequency of 0.067 and a maximum allele frequency of 0.967. This was done to avoid over-fitting (Linck and Battey 2019).\n\nFor downstream analyses affected by linkage disequilibrium (PCA and ADMIXTURE analyses; see below), the SNP dataset was also LD pruned with PLINK (RRID:SCR_001757) (Chang et al. 2015) in 50 SNP variant windows with a sliding window of 10 variants, to remove SNPs above 0.1 correlation.\n\nPopulation structure analyses\n\nThe relationships between the C. zeina isolates based on variation in the biallelic SNPs were visualized using DAPC (Jombart et al. 2010) with the ADEGENET (Jombart 2008) package in R (RRID:SCR_001905). The positions and effect of the SNPs were determined using SnpEff (Cingolani et al. 2012). The threshold for selecting SNPs that had a major effect on the observed DAPC clusters was taken as the 0.995 quantile on the DAPC loading plot.\n\nAn additional PCA analysis was done with the methods and utilities provided in the Eigensoft (RRID:SCR_004965) software package (v 8.0.0) (Price et al. 2006). The LD-pruned SNP files from PLINK were converted into the EIGENSTRAT format using the Eigensoft convertf utility. The Eigensoft smartpca perl wrapper was used to run the principal component analysis and then apply the EIGENSTRAT stratification correction method to the PCA plot. The corrected PCA plot was plotted using the Eigensoft ploteig utility, and was labeled to show the countries of origins.\n\nADMIXTURE (RRID:SCR_001263) (Alexander et al. 2009) was used to analyze the LD-pruned SNPs for admixture between the 31 C. zeina isolates and subpopulations between them. Convergence between runs of the admixture analysis were visualized with PONG (Behr et al. 2016).\n\nTo determine the phylogenetic relationships between the C. zeina isolates, biallelic SNPs that were present in 2 or more isolates were imported into R using vcfR (Knaus and Grünwald 2017). The R package, POPPR (Kamvar et al. 2014), was used to construct a bitwise distance matrix from the SNPs, which was then used to produce a neighbor-joining tree with 1,000 bootstraps. The R package PHANGORN (Schliep et al. 2017) was used to create a neighbor net (Bryant 2003) from the distance matrix and to add confidence values to the neighbor net from the bootstrap tree. The network was visualized using SPLITSTREE v4 (Huson and Bryant 2006).\n\nResults\n\nSequencing and assembly of African C. zeina isolates\n\nA subset of 30 C. zeina isolates representing a broad spread of genetically distant genotypes from the 5 African countries in Eastern and Southern Africa were selected for Illumina sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 1) ( ). This was made up of 8 isolates from South Africa, 7 isolates from Kenya, 6 isolates from Uganda, 6 isolates from Zimbabwe, and 3 isolates from Zambia ( ). C. zeina is a heterothallic fungus (Muller et al. 2016), and the diversity of mating type alleles was previously assessed for these fungal populations. We selected representative isolates of both mating types, including 13 MAT1-1 and 17 MAT1-2 isolates ( ). The number of filtered Illumina read pairs obtained for each isolate ranged from 3,653,040 to 9,385,376 ( ).\n\nTable 1.\n\nIsolateCountryDistrictMating typeaRead pairsRead pairs mapped to reference genome (%)bAverage read depthReference genome covered by reads (bp)c (%)KE.KAK.344KenyaKakamegaMAT1-19,235,1238941.941,249,360 (99%)KE.KER.468KenyaKerichoMAT1-17,091,5409031.041,210,329 (99%)KE.KER.511KenyaKerichoMAT1-17,984,2929035.641,204,784 (99%)KE.KIS.232KenyaKisumuMAT1-18,068,5949036.341,300,563 (99%)KE.KIT.758KenyaKitaleMAT1-15,287,1318922.741,148,040 (99%)KE.SIA.288KenyaSiayaMAT1-14,989,0949022.341,071,763 (98%)KE.TRS.520KenyaTrans-NzoiaMAT1-14,793,7088820.841,138,073 (99%)UG.FTP.009UgandaFortportalMAT1-28,234,7249037.441,283,179 (99%)UG.GYZ.032UgandaWakisoMAT1-27,927,1998933.841,247,497 (99%)UG.KPC.038UgandaKapchorwaMAT1-18,025,4428933.541,215,743 (99%)UG.LIR.101UgandaLiraMAT1-29,385,3768942.241,278,896 (99%)UG.MSK.001UgandaMasakaMAT1-26,906,1978931.141,159,959 (99%)UG.NML.092UgandaWakisoMAT1-18,233,2338937.541,234,210 (99%)ZA.BZN.009South AfricaMbizanaMAT1-26,179,7518927.041,227,006 (99%)ZA.BZN.007South AfricaMbizanaMAT1-26,614,7528928.441,467,018 (99%)ZA.CED.V02.124South AfricaCedaraMAT1-18,719,9448837.841,378,025 (99%)ZA.CED.V05.074South AfricaCedaraMAT1-18,055,0008835.641,395,899 (99%)ZA.CRG.097South AfricaHlangananiMAT1-28,142,9808937.241,271,764 (99%)ZA.EST.017South AfricaNtabamhlopheMAT1-23,653,0408815.541,132,557 (99%)ZA.NTB.069South AfricaNtabankuluMAT1-18,035,5048833.641,259,132 (99%)ZA.NXM.079South AfricaKwaNxamalalaMAT1-16,127,1759126.941,265,685 (99%)ZM.CHS.019ZambiaChisambaMAT1-28,019,4538835.441,332,640 (99%)ZM.CHS.045ZambiaChisambaMAT1-16,044,0138926.641,280,858 (99%)ZM.CHS.092ZambiaChisambaMAT1-25,704,2279226.441,235,589 (99%)ZW.AFR.270ZimbabweMutareMAT1-16,512,6639128.841,265,177 (99%)ZW.ART.151ZimbabweHarareMAT1-26,006,8788524.341,299,810 (99%)ZW.CHN.315ZimbabweChinhoyiMAT1-28,216,3639037.741,346,000 (99%)ZW.CMH.326ZimbabweHarareMAT1-28,264,2998937.341,362,442 (99%)ZW.RRS.263ZimbabweKweKweMAT1-18,233,3818937.041,354,564 (99%)ZW.STP.133ZimbabweHarareMAT1-18,221,6989037.841,366,302 (99%)\n\nWe hypothesized that geographic separation between the Eastern and Southern African regions or countries may have resulted in local adaptation possibly reflected in distinct gene contents. To this end, we addressed the composition of accessory genes in the C. zeina populations and conducted de novo genome assemblies to obtain the gene content in each isolate. Summary statistics of the de novo assemblies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. In brief, the de novo assemblies of the 30 genomes of C. zeina resulted in genome sizes of approximately 30 Mb, ranging from 29.2 Mb to 29.9 Mb suggesting a conserved genome composition among the isolates (Supplementary Table 1). N50 values of the de novo assemblies ranged from 74,006 to 90,244 bp (Supplementary Table 1), and the assemblies were similar in size to the non-repetitive component which made up approximately 2/3 of the 42 Mb C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 reference genome generated with PacBio sequencing (Wingfield et al. 2022). As expected, the Illumina sequencing could not resolve the repetitive components of the genome as fully as in the reference genome assembly generated by long-read sequencing (Wingfield et al. 2022). BUSCO annotations however indicated that the short-read genome assemblies had captured most of the protein-coding gene content since 97% of the Dothideomycete conserved gene set was present in each isolate (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nGene content comparison of African C. zeina isolates\n\nThe BRAKER annotation pipeline predicted 11,071 protein-coding genes from the reference genome (Supplementary Table 1) and was thus more conservative than the annotations made in the previous study where 11,570 genes were predicted (Wingfield et al. 2022). The number of genes annotated in the 30 C. zeina isolates ranged from 11,135–11,194 (Supplementary Table 1), which were more than were predicted in the previous Illumina version of the reference genome (10,193) (Wingfield et al. 2017).\n\nCore and accessory genes in C. zeina were identified in the 31 isolates by comparison of orthogroups (listed in Supplementary Table 2). First, genes were clustered into (1) 10,677 core orthogroups (93% of the orthogroups), of which 10,306 had a BLAST hit and 5,749 could be annotated with a GO term, and (2) 790 accessory orthogroups (7% of the orthogroups), of which 433 and 401 had a BLAST hit and GO term, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). Based on these analyses, we found that the number of accessory orthogroups in each isolate ranged from 394 to 517 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).\n\nSince more than 700 genes can be considered accessory, we further investigated the pangenome structure of C. zeina. The first step was to determine if we had sequenced sufficient C. zeina isolates to capture the accessory gene content. The exponent of the C. zeina pangenome accumulation curve was very close to 1 (0.99) ( ), indicating a very small accumulation of new genes with the successive inclusion of genomes from additional isolates. We therefore concluded that with 31 isolates, we had captured a representative pangenome of C. zeina isolates from the major maize producing countries in the Eastern and Southern African geographical regions.\n\nWe had hypothesized that there may be regional (East vs Southern Africa) or country-specific accessory genes on account of local adaptation. We evaluated the distribution of the orthogroups between the regions and countries to determine whether there were any orthogroups specific to a region or country. The overlaps of the 790 accessory orthogroups between each country were visualized using an UpSet plot ( ). The majority of the accessory orthogroups (586 out of 790) were present in all 5 countries, and the rest of the orthogroups were randomly distributed between the countries and regions ( ). There were 32 orthogroups in total found only in at least one of the Southern African countries ( ). Of these, we could assign a GO term for 2; protein binding and sphingolipid metabolism ( ). Three of the 6 orthogroups found in only at least 1 East African country had GO terms (oxidoreductase activity, mitochondrial associated amino acid catabolism, protein binding) ( ). Overall, out of the orthogroups with GO terms that were common between the core and accessory, there were several GO terms related to transcription and kinase activity that were significantly enriched in the accessory genes compared to the core genes (P < 0.05) ( ).\n\nTable 2.\n\nRegionRegion-specific orthogroupsGO IDGO annotationSouthern AfricaOG0011401GO:0005515Protein bindingOG0011461GO:0004348, GO:0006665Glucosylceramidase activity; sphingolipid metabolic processEast AfricaOG0011402GO:0005506; GO:0016705; GO:0020037; GO:0033566; GO:0004497Iron ion binding; oxidoreductase activity, acting on paired donors, with incorporation or reduction of molecular oxygen; heme binding; gamma-tubulin complex localization; monooxygenase activityOG0011385GO:0005515Protein bindingOG0011444GO:00038603-Hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase activity, mitochondrial\n\nTable 3.\n\nGO IDTermGenes with termAccessory genes with term P-value (Fisher test)Biological processGO:0031503Protein-containing complex localization930.001GO:0006468Protein phosphorylation15890.01GO:0006355Regulation of transcription, DNA-templated287140.01GO:0032502Developmental process820.02Molecular functionGO:0008757S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity3340.003GO:0004672Protein kinase activity17090.01GO:0000981DNA-binding transcription factor activity, RNA polymerase II-specific17790.01GO:0016289CoA hydrolase activity820.01GO:0008270Zinc ion binding352120.04GO:0003700DNA-binding transcription factor activity221120.04\n\nThere were a total of 888 secreted orthogroups, which were sub-classified as 223 effectors (149 apoplastic and 74 cytoplasmic), and 665 non-effectors (Supplementary Table 2). The accessory secretome had a significantly higher proportion of effectors (44%) than the core secretome, which only had 24% effectors (the 2 proportion z-test, P-value < 0.05) ( ). The opposite was true for the proportion of non-effector secreted orthogroups, which was significantly higher in the core secretome (the 2 proportion z-test, P-value < 0.05) ( ).\n\nTable 4.\n\nCore + accessoryaCorebAccessorycSignificant difference in proportions (P-value)dTotal orthogroups (secreted)888854 (100%)34 (100%)Non-effector orthogroups (secreted)665646 (76%)19 (56%)0.02*Effector orthogroups (secreted)223208 (24%)15 (44%)0.02*Effector orthogroups (secreted)—apoplastic149139 (16%)10 (29%)0.08Effector orthogroups (secreted)—cytoplasmic7469 (8%)5 (14%)0.29\n\nIn addition, we aimed to determine whether accessory genes were associated with genomic regions containing repetitive and mobile elements. We made use of the well-assembled PacBio genome of the reference C. zeina isolate {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467, which contained the 10,677 core genes and 394 accessory genes. In a comparison of the median distance of the genes to the nearest TE, the accessory genes were significantly closer to a TE than the core genes were (mean 1.7 Kb) (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P-value = 0.018) (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nPopulation differentiation between East and Southern African C. zeina isolates\n\nA further goal of this study was to determine the population genetic structure of C. zeina isolates from the 5 African countries based on genome-wide SNP data. To this end, we conducted genome-wide SNP calling based on a reference assembly to identify variable sites along the pathogen genomes ( ). We hypothesized that differences in environment or farming practices between East and Southern Africa could result in population differentiation and local adaptation. For example, Kenya and Uganda are on the equator, whereas the maize growing region of KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa is at a latitude of 30° South. Furthermore, maize is grown continuously in East Africa, whereas there is a single summer season in South Africa (Nsibo et al. 2021).\n\nBased on the SNP calling results of the 30 African C. zeina isolates compared to the reference genome of C. zeina {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 ( ), we identified a total of 151,074 SNPs (after quality filtering, see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we called 8,226 indels, but these were not used in our downstream analyses.\n\nWe employed 3 methods to explore the population structure among the C. zeina populations. First, we conducted a DAPC using the complete SNP dataset to identify patterns of population clusters. The analyses revealed a clear separation along the first principal component (x-axis) between isolates from East Africa (Kenya and Uganda), and isolates from Southern Africa (Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa) ( ). Interestingly, DAPC analysis did not differentiate the isolates from Kenya and Uganda, whereas there was differentiation on the second principal component (y-axis) between Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa ( ). We conducted an additional PCA analysis with correction for stratification to explore the population structure of the 31 C. zeina isolates. This analysis was carried out with a subset of 2,157 Linkage Disequelibirum (LD)-pruned SNPs [minor allele frequency (MAF) > 6.6%] in the software Eigensoft (Price et al. 2006). Again, the East African (Uganda and Kenya) C. zeina isolates clustered together and were differentiated from the isolates from the Southern African countries ( , Eigenvector 1 on x-axis).\n\nNext, we explored the ancestry of the 31 C. zeina isolates (including also the reference isolate) using the program ADMIXTURE with the subset of 2,157 LD-pruned SNPs. The analysis provided highest support for 2 groups of shared ancestry (K = 2, ) with 1 from East Africa (Kenya and Uganda) and the other from Southern Africa (Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa). A clustering model of K = 3 indicated some differentiation between the Zambian isolates and the Zimbabwean and South Africa isolates ( ) as seen for the DAPC analysis. Higher clustering models (K = 4 to K = 6) did not consistently resolve the populations.\n\nFinally, we explored the relationships between the African C. zeina isolates with a phylogenetic approach using 88,023 biallelic genome-wide SNPs with MAF > 6.6%. The neighbor-net network based on whole-genome distances showed an overall separation of East African isolates from Southern African isolates ( ). However, there is a large amount of reticulation evident in the splitstree indicating recurrent and recent recombination and gene flow between isolates in both regions. Furthermore, there was little evidence of country-specific clusters, since there is little differentiation between Kenyan and Uganda isolates, or between Zambian, Zimbabwe, or South African isolates ( ).\n\nTaken together, the population genomic analyses point to population differentiation between C. zeina isolates from East and Southern Africa, but also gene flow between countries of the regions. We speculate that this pattern reflects a recent introduction of 2 founder populations of this pathogen into East and Southern Africa followed by dispersal and recurrent gene flow between countries, and insufficient isolation time for divergence of country-specific lineages. These findings are consistent with a hypothesis that C. zeina was introduced to Africa together with maize within the last 500 years (McCann 2007).\n\nDiscussion\n\nAssembly of the African C. zeina pangenome\n\nThe accessory genome of the C. zeina population in Africa sampled in this study was relatively small compared to some other fungal plant pathogens known to have accessory genomic compartments (Möller and Stukenbrock 2017). Here, based on 31 genomes, we show that the C. zeina pangenome has only 7% accessory gene content compared to the 10 to 57% found in other fungal pathogens (Plissonneau et al. 2018; McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2019; Gourlie et al. 2022). This was not due to the sample size as, based on the accumulation curve, we showed that adding more African isolates did not add significantly more accessory genes.\n\nBased on previous work done on the microsatellite data of the same African C. zeina collection, we hypothesized to find a considerable variation in gene content. This hypothesis was built on the fact that the C. zeina population has a high level of genetic diversity and a high level (approximately a third of the genome) of TEs (Nsibo et al. 2021; Wingfield et al. 2022). We did, however, find evidence that the accessory genes were slightly but significantly closer to these mobile elements in the reference isolate than the core genes, suggesting that TEs play a role in the presence–absence variation of accessory genes. Future work could include other species to allow phylogenetic information to be used to validate whether any of the accessory genes originated through genome rearrangements, as in the pipeline developed by Zabelkin et al. (2022).\n\nThe low amount of accessory gene content of C. zeina in Africa could reflect a genetic bottleneck in the pathogen's evolutionary history in Africa (Badet and Croll 2020). A potential reason could be that only a few genotypes of the pathogen entered Africa when maize was introduced in the past 500 years (McCann 2007). An alternative hypothesis is that C. zeina made a host jump from an African grass onto maize after this host was introduced into the continent (Crous et al. 2006). However, this is not consistent with the widespread distribution of C. zeina globally (Wang et al. 1998). Furthermore, a host jump would be expected to occur from a narrow genetic base, which in the timeframe of maize introduction to Africa, would be expected to have a higher level of clonality than we have observed (Nsibo et al. 2021). Finally, the lack of large differences in effector gene content between isolates in East and Southern Africa may be due to the distribution of maize germplasm with similar QTLs for GLS resistance between breeding programs (Berger et al. 2014).\n\nC. zeina is also present as a causal agent of gray leaf spot disease in the center of origin of maize (Mexico), and large-scale maize production on 3 other continents, especially the USA, China, and Brazil (Wang et al. 1998, Brunelli et al. 2008, Liu and Xu 2013). Therefore, expanding the study to C. zeina populations from other continents could be a valuable future research strategy. For example, a larger C. zeina pangenome on another continent could indicate that there was a bottleneck after introduction to the African continent. Signatures of selection related to a host shift could then be investigated to potentially resolve the ancestral C. zeina population. Bottlenecks lower genetic diversity in general, which would include shared gene presence or absence, but not necessarily overall genome size. For example, a bottleneck occurred in Z. tritici after its introduction to Australia, but subsequently, the pathogen underwent a genome expansion and the Australian isolate actually had a larger accessory component compared to the isolates from countries with older populations (Plissonneau et al. 2018). A difference in pangenome size would therefore not directly indicate whether the bottleneck was due to an ancestral host shift or invasion into Africa, but phylogenetic approaches including a global collection of isolates could potentially resolve the question of where C. zeina originated.\n\nAccessory genes in C. zeina are enriched with effector candidates\n\nIn total, we identified 790 accessory genes, several of which could not be assigned a functional relevance. However, for 401 genes we could either classify the genes under a GO term, or we could identify them as genes encoding secreted proteins (34 in total). Although mating type genes cannot be defined as “accessory” in a heterothallic fungus such as C. zeina, the GO term “developmental process” was enriched due to presence of either MAT1-1 (OG0011054) or MAT1-2 (OG0011238) in each of the 31 isolates ( ). This provided an internal validation that our pipeline was able to identify genes present in only some isolates.\n\nThe top 2 enriched GO terms in the accessory gene set were protein-containing complex localization and protein phosphorylation. These terms have also been found to be significantly enriched in the accessory genes of other fungal species (McCarthy and Fitzpatrick 2019). Out of the accessory genes annotated with the protein phosphorylation terms, 1 (OG0010814) contained protein domains characteristic of a tyrosine kinase, and another 2 (OG0010691, OG0011136) contained serine/threonine-protein kinase domains. Serine/threonine-protein kinases have been shown to play a role in mating and pathogenicity in other fungal plant pathogens (Zhao et al. 2007).\n\nOne of the accessory genes (OG0011402) annotated with GO term “protein-containing complex localization” contains protein domains characteristic of a group IV cytochrome P450 ( ). This type of protein plays a variety of roles in fungi, including mycotoxin biosynthesis, detoxification, and gibberellin biosynthesis (Črešnar and Petrič 2011). Gaining this gene potentially strengthens a C. zeina genotype's ability to compete against other plant pathogens present in the host. This cytochrome P450 was the only enriched accessory gene which was regionally restricted. It was found in only 4 isolates from East Africa and was not present in any Southern African isolates including the reference genome isolate.\n\nRegulation of transcription was also significantly enriched among the accessory genes. There is precedent for accessory transcription factors playing a role in pathogenicity in Fusarium (van der Does et al. 2016) and Aspergillus flavus (Fountain et al. 2020). Four (OG0010726, OG0011289, OG0011377, OG0010745) accessory genes annotated with this term contained protein domains characteristic of the same kind of transcription factor, a Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type DNA-binding domain profile. One of them (OG0010745) also contained an aflatoxin biosynthesis regulatory protein signature. Additionally, a Zn(2)-C6 fungal-type transcription factor (OG0000043) was one of the core genes which contained structural SNPs in the coding region. Despite these transcription factors being annotated with similar protein domains, the amino acid sequences were very dissimilar overall between the genes and they were found in different groups of isolates. There was also another enriched accessory gene transcription factor (OG0011345), which contained a different domain for a fungal-specific transcription factor. This is a promising candidate to investigate adaptation in C. zeina.\n\nOne of the accessory genes with a potential role in local adaptation was a magnesium transporter (OG0000038; Supplementary Table 2). Such a gene has been shown to increase aluminum resistance in S. cerevisiae (MacDiarmid and Gardner 1998). Aluminum toxicity is a significant factor in maize fields in East Africa (Lal and Singh 1998; Matonyei et al. 2020). Soil acidity (including aluminum toxicity) tends to occur in tropical climates (Von Uexküll and Mutert 1995). The allele in the Eastern African isolates therefore likely reflects adaptation to local abiotic conditions in the Eastern African population.\n\nThe accessory component of C. zeina contained a greater proportion of predicted effectors than in the core, as has been previously observed in fungal pathogens (Möller and Stukenbrock 2017; Bertazzoni et al. 2018). For example, the accessory component was enriched for effector genes in the pangenome of a global collection of 19 Z. tritici strains (Badet et al. 2020). Accessory effectors are sometimes localized on an accessory chromosome, such as the SIX effectors in Fusarium oxysporum (Ayukawa et al. 2021) or the AvrLm11 effector in L. maculans (Balesdent et al. 2013). Here, in C. zeina, the alternate case was observed, where effectors were interspersed in the core chromosomes, such as in Cochliobolus (Condon et al. 2013). It was previously observed in the {\"type\":\"entrez-protein\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"CMW25467\",\"term_id\":\"892301607\",\"term_text\":\"CMW25467\"}}CMW25467 PacBio assembly that effectors were not associated with specific genome compartments (Wingfield et al. 2022), and the same pattern of genomic locations was observed for the effectors for the other African C. zeina isolates sequenced in this study. In ongoing work, knowledge of the C. zeina effector candidates should be used to select isolates for pathogenicity trials to investigate which genes are causing a C. zeina isolate to be virulent or avirulent on particular maize genotypes.\n\nPopulation differentiation between East and Southern African C. zeina isolates\n\nGenome-wide SNP marker analysis of the 31 C. zeina isolates revealed that there was a level of population differentiation between isolates from East African countries compared to Southern African countries ( – ). These analyses included 13 isolates from East Africa and 17 isolates from Southern Africa. However, there was strong evidence for recombination and recurrent gene flow between countries and regions. These results are consistent with a previous study of 964 C. zeina isolates from the same countries analyzed with microsatellite markers (Nsibo et al. 2021). A level of regional population differentiation between East and Southern Africa was also seen in this study, but considerable evidence for gene flow and migration was seen between countries and regions (Nsibo et al. 2021). No clones were included in the 31 isolates used in this study, however, there is considerable evidence for asexual reproduction in the African population with clonal fractions of 7–20% per country for the 964 C. zeina isolates (Nsibo et al. 2021).\n\nSeveral hypotheses can be suggested to explain the current population structure of C. zeina in Africa. First, the differentiation between East and Southern African populations could be explained by (1) recent but separate introduction of genetically distinct founder populations; or (2) different environmental or maize genotype selection pressures in each region. In support of the first explanation, records indicate that the earliest introductions of maize into West Africa from the Caribbean included whole plant material (McCann 2007). C. zeina is not known to be seed-borne, and therefore, introductions would need to be on infected leaf or ear sheath material. Breeding programs, which rely on the introduction of maize germplasm, have generally operated separately in East Africa compared to Southern Africa (Smale et al. 2013). This implies that maize material from different sources could have been introduced separately to the East and Southern African regions. In support of this, the population genetics study with microsatellite markers showed that C. zeina populations from Kenya and South Africa showed different but high diversity indicating the possibility of 2 founder populations (Nsibo et al. 2021).\n\nFarming practices can impact the genetic diversity of plant pathogens. For example, the diversity of rice blast pathogen was greater in fields planted to mixtures of rice genotypes compared to monocultures (Zhu et al. 2000). In the maize-C. zeina pathosystem, this has also been seen with greater genetic diversity in small-holder farms than large-scale commercial farms in South Africa (Nsibo et al. 2019). In the current study, the production practices differ between East and Southern Africa with continuous maize production in East Africa in contrast to a single summer season in South Africa. Furthermore, farmers plant a variety of genotypes, such as open pollinated varieties as well as hybrids in Kenya and Uganda, in contrast to South Africa where hybrids dominate (Berger et al. 2020).\n\nHost genotype can influence the genetic diversity of pathogen populations, as was seen in the potato-late blight pathosystem (Stellingwerf et al. 2018). Our study showed a slight enrichment of pathogenicity effector genes in the accessory gene content of the African C. zeina isolates, although there was not a regional influence. Nevertheless, this points to the effect of host genotype on the C. zeina genetic diversity in Africa. It is highly likely that maize germplasm and resistance sources could differ in East and Southern Africa, due to different breeding programs (Smale et al. 2013). Currently, breeders rely on quantitative disease resistance to C. zeina, and many QTL have been identified in diverse germplasm sources (Berger et al. 2014). Maize breeding in East Africa has generally been carried out by National programmes and institutes of the Consultative Group in International Agriculture (CGIAR) such as CIMMYT and IITA, and has made use of tropical maize germplasm with a focus on white maize for human consumption (Worku et al. 2020). In contrast, maize production in South Africa and Zimbabwe has been built on breeding with sub-tropical maize germplasm by local companies, national programs, and multinationals (Berger et al. 2020). Much of the production in South Africa is yellow maize for animal feed.\n\nFinally, the clustering of C. zeina isolates that was determined with a neighbor-net network of C. zeina in the 5 African countries shows reticulation indicative of recurrent gene flow and recombination ( ). Maize production is essentially geographically continuous from East to Southern Africa since it is the staple crop in all sub-Saharan African countries from Ethiopia to South Africa (Smale et al. 2013). Spores of C. zeina can disseminate from field to field by wind (Ward et al. 1999), and due to overlapping seasons, it is feasible for the pathogen to move incrementally from country to country. There are no major mountainous geographic barriers since the Rift Valley runs from North to South. The Zambezi valley between Zambia and Zimbabwe is a West–East barrier, however, it is not devoid of maize production. This may explain why there are shared alleles throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, rare events of human mediated dispersal may have occurred, as inferred by the presence of the same microsatellite genotypes in Kenya, Uganda, and a maize disease resistance breeding station (Cedara) in South Africa (Nsibo et al. 2021).\n\nFurther genetic evidence for recombination in African populations of C. zeina is forthcoming from this study and a previous study utilizing microsatellite markers (Nsibo et al. 2021). Although the sexual stage of C. zeina has not been observed (Crous et al. 2006), several lines of evidence support the occurrence of cryptic sex in populations of C. zeina. Isolates with both mating types are generally found in all fields surveyed, and mating type ratios are predominantly close to 1:1 in populations at different spatial scales (province or country) in Africa (Muller et al. 2016, Nsibo et al. 2019, 2021). The clonal fraction of C. zeina isolates from small-holder and commercial farms in South Africa were only 11 and 32%, respectively (Nsibo et al. 2019).\n\nThe signal of recurrent gene flow seen from our genome-wide SNP data from 31 C. zeina isolates in the 5 African countries ( ) may also reflect an intra-specific hybrid swarm, considering that there is evidence for cryptic sex (Nsibo et al. 2021). This hypothesis may be difficult to test without knowledge of the 2 or more original parental lineages. This may be forthcoming from sequencing of C. zeina populations from other continents. However, 2 factors argue against a hybrid swarm as a complete explanation of population structure observed in this study. First, it is difficult to reconcile how, in the short period of maize cultivation in Africa, that a single intra-specific hybridization event in 1 region and subsequent radiation could result in the observed signal of 2 regional population groups in East and Southern Africa. Second, there is a significant level of clonality in the African population of C. zeina (Nsibo et al. 2021), invoking considerable asexual reproduction.\n\nIn summary, we here provide a comprehensive analysis of genomic variation in an important maize pathogen on the African continent. We find evidence for East and Southern African population structure with some gene flow between countries based on genome-wide polymorphisms. The pangenome of C. zeina in Africa moreover comprises several hundred genes exhibiting presence–absence variation. Future studies should aim to unravel the functional relevance of virulence-related candidate genes in this important pathogen.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\njkad214_Supplementary_Data\n\nClick here to view.(6.5M, zip)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe acknowledge the Max Planck-Genome-centre Cologne (MP-GC), Germany for conducting the Illumina genome sequencing of the C. zeina isolates.\n\nContributor Information\n\nTanya Welgemoed, Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, University of Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield 0028, South Africa.\n\nTuan A Duong, Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, University of Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield 0028, South Africa.\n\nIrene Barnes, Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, Forestry and Agricultural Biotechnology Institute, University of Pretoria, Private Bag X20, Hatfield 0028, South Africa.\n\nEva H Stukenbrock, Environmental Genomics, Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Am Botanischen Garten 1-11, Kiel 24118, Germany.
