        "text": "Introduction\n\nFungi are an essential and indispensable component of the ecosystem (Hawksworth, 2001; Gafforov, 2017; Hernandez-Restrepo et al., 2017; Purahong et al., 2017; Field and Pressel, 2018; Hyde et al., 2018a,b). They perform irreplaceable functions in the ecosystem such as nutrient cycling, responding to plant growth, maintaining plant diversity, and organic matter decomposition (Osono, 2017; Purahong et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018). Fungi are regarded as “key players” in the decomposition of litter due to their capability of secreting different kinds of enzymes (Promputtha et al., 2017; Tennakoon et al., 2021). The lignocellulose matrix of litter, which cannot be broken down by most species, is degraded by these enzymes (Romaní et al., 2006; Osono, 2007; Zhang et al., 2018; Tennakoon et al., 2021). Fungi have different lifestyles, such as biotrophs, endophytes, hemi-biotrophs, necrotrophs, and saprotrophs (Barelli et al., 2016; Hyde et al., 2018a; Tang et al., 2018; Tennakoon et al., 2021). They also differ greatly in terms of morphological characteristics, phylogeny characteristics, reproduction modes, and life cycles (Drinkwater et al., 2008; Purahong et al., 2017; Willis, 2018; Phookamsak et al., 2019). Therefore, identification of fungi is crucial to understanding their diversity and roles in the ecosystem. However, proper identification of fungal species is challenging. Despite challenges, mycologists have put considerable effort to identify fungal species worldwide (Lumbsch et al., 2011; Błaszkowski et al., 2013; Csata et al., 2013; Hyde et al., 2013; Giraldo et al., 2019).\n\nDidymosphaeriaceae, one of the Dothideomycetes families, is an interesting taxonomic group of fungi in Pleosporales (Hyde et al., 2013; Hongsanan et al., 2020). Munk (1953) reported this family to contain Didymosphaeria. Didymosphaeriaceae members are morphologically diverse, and most of the sexual morphs have uni-septate, brown ascospores (Hongsanan et al., 2020). Asexual morph can be either coelomycetes (e.g., Alloconiothyrium, Letendraea, Paraconiothyrium, and Paraphaeosphaeria) or hyphomycetes (e.g., Spegazzinia) (Ariyawansa et al., 2014a,b; Thambugala et al., 2017; Hongsanan et al., 2020). The members of this family are cosmopolitan, and most of them have been recognized as saprobes. Meanwhile, some have been found as pathogens or endophytes in diverse plant substrates (e.g., leaves and twigs) in different ecosystems (e.g., marine, terrestrial, and mangroves) (Ariyawansa et al., 2013; Hyde et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Wanasinghe et al., 2016; Hongsanan et al., 2020). Recently, numerous genera have been introduced in Didymosphaeriaceae. For instance, during the past 2 years period, four genera have been introduced, namely, Cylindroaseptospora (Jayasiri et al., 2019), Neptunomyces (Gonçalves et al., 2019), Vicosamyces (Phookamsak et al., 2019), and Chromolaenicola (Mapook et al., 2020). Hongsanan et al. (2020) added 32 genera in this family. Of them, some are highly diverse (e.g., Didymosphaeria, Kalmusia, Paraphaeosphaeria, Pseudocamarosporium, Pseudopithomyces, and Spegazzinia), and some genera have a few number of species (e.g., Alloconiothyrium, Austropleospora, Barria, Bimuria, Cylindroaseptospora, Deniquelata, Didymocrea, Kalmusibambusa, Lineostroma, Vicosamyces, and Xenocamarosporium) (Hongsanan et al., 2020).\n\nAs a part of the fungal diversity study, we have identified nine taxa from plant litter substrates (China and Thailand), which belong to the family Didymosphaeriaceae. Their taxonomic positions were established through morphology combined with phylogenetic analyses.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nSample collection, morphological studies, and isolation\n\nPlant litter (dead leaves and stems) samples were collected from China and Thailand. All the collected samples were examined under a stereo-microscope (AXIOSKOP 2 PLUS Series, Göttingen, Germany). Squash mount preparations were prepared to determine fungal microscopic features (e.g., asci, ascospores, conidia, and pseudoparaphyses). All the images were captured under an Axioskop 2 Plus (Göttingen, Germany) compound microscope equipped using a Canon Axiocam 506 color digital camera (Hanover, Germany). Lactoglycerol and nail polish were used to prepare the permanent slides. All the photo plates were prepared by Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended version 10.0 software (Adobe Systems, USA), and measurements were taken by ZEN2 (blue edition).\n\nDNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification\n\nThe isolation process was used for the single spore isolation, as described by Senanayake et al. (2020). Potato dextrose agar (PDA) was used to transfer germinated spores, which were then incubated at 25°C. Following that, careful sub-culturing was carried out to obtain pure cultures. After 3 weeks, culture characteristics (on PDA) were observed. All the type specimens were deposited in the herbariums of Mae Fah Luang University (MFLU) and National Chiayi University (NCYU). The culture collections of Mae Fah Luang University (MFLUCC) and National Chiayi University (NCYUCC) were used to deposit the living cultures. Numbers for Faces of Fungi and Index Fungorum were used as mentioned in Jayasiri et al. (2015) and Index Fungorum (2022).\n\nThe fungal colonies growing on PDA (3 weeks) were used for genomic DNA extraction. Liquid nitrogen was used to grind the mycelium into a fine powder, and the DNA was extracted using the DNA extraction kit (E.Z.N.A Fungal DNA Mini Kit, D3390-02, Omega Bio-Tek) following the manufacturer's instructions. Montagnula jonesii (MFLU 18-0084) was subjected to direct DNA extraction using a DNA extraction kit from BioFlux®, Hangzhou, P.R. China, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA products were stored for a long period of time at −20 °C and retained at 4°C for DNA amplification. DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for obtaining the five genes: the large subunit (28S, LSU), small subunit (18S, SSU), internal transcribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2), translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (tef1-α), and β-tubulin (tub2). The LSU gene was amplified using the primers LR0R (5′-TCCTGAGGGAAACTTCG-3′) and LR5 (5′-ACCCGCTGAACTTAAGC-3′) (Vilgalys and Hester, 1990; Rehner and Samuels, 1994); the SSU gene was amplified using the primers NS1 (5′-GTAGTCATATGCTTGTCTC-3′) and NS4 (5′-CTTCCGTCAATTCCTTTAAG-3′) (White et al., 1990); nuclear ITS was amplified using the primers ITS5 (5′-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (White et al., 1990); tef1-α gene was amplified using the primers EF1-983F (5′-GCYCCYGGHCAYCGTGAYTTYAT-3′) and EF1-2218R (5′-ATGACACCRACRGCRACRGTYTG-3′) (Rehner, 2001); and beta-tubulin (tub2) gene was amplified using the primers BT2a (5′-GGTAACCAAATCGGTGCTGCTTTC-3′) and BT2b (5′-ACCCTCAGTGTAGTGACCCTTGGC-3′) (Glass and Donaldson, 1995). Sterilized water (9.5 μl), 2 × Power Taq PCR MasterMix (Bioteke Co., China) (12.5 μl), each forward and reverse primers (1 μl), and DNA template (1 μl) were used for amplification reactions. The PCR thermal cycle program for ITS, LSU, SSU, tef1-α, and tub2 was performed, as described by Conforto et al. (2019) and Tennakoon et al. (2020). PCR products were sent to Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology and Services Co., Ltd, China, for the purification and sequencing. All the obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (Tables 1–4).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nTABLE 2\n\nTABLE 3\n\nTABLE 4\n\nPhylogenetic analyses\n\nA combined gene dataset of ITS, LSU, SSU, tef1-α, and tub2 was used for the phylogenetic analyses. The newly attained sequences were initially subjected to BLASTn searches in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) to identify the taxa that shared the most similarities with our strains. The additional sequences included in the analysis were from previous publications (Phookamsak et al., 2019; Samarakoon et al., 2020; Boonmee et al., 2021; Tennakoon et al., 2021). MAFFT v.7 web server (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server) was used to make multiple alignments (Katoh and Standley, 2013). The alignment was corrected manually using BioEdit v.7.0.5.2 (Hall, 1999), where necessary.\n\nThe CIPRES Science Gateway platform (Miller et al., 2010) was used to create maximum likelihood trees using the GTR + I + G model of evolution and RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE (8.2.8) (Stamatakis et al., 2008; Stamatakis, 2014). MrModeltest v.3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) was carried out to check the evolutionary models for phylogenetic analyses under the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Model test results revealed “GTR + I + G” as the best-fit model for each locus for Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses. MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001) was used for Bayesian analysis (Rannala and Yang, 1996; Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2002). The number of generations used in Bayesian analysis were 1,000,000 to 5,000,000, and trees were sampled every 100th or 1,000th generations. The FigTree v1.4.0 (Rambaut, 2012) program was used to view the phylogenetic trees and was reorganized by using Microsoft PowerPoint (2010). All the final alignments were deposited in TreeBASE (http://www.treebase.org/) (Submission ID: 29615).\n\nResults\n\nPhylogenetic and taxonomic results of Montagnula\n\nMontagnula Berl\n\nNotes: Berlese (1896) established this genus to include M. infernalis as the generic type. Montagnula members mostly have globose, spherical, immersed, or semi-immersed ascomata, clavate to cylindrical asci, and multi-septate, fusoid, or ellipsoid ascospores (Ariyawansa et al., 2014a; Pitt et al., 2014). Montagnula species serves a crucial role in the environment as saprobes, which generally grow on the wood and bark of dead plants but also rarely on dead leaves (Hongsanan et al., 2020; Mapook et al., 2020). This genus has a vast range of species all around the world. In addition, given the number of new species revealed through recent investigations, Montagnula appears to be phylogenetically diverse as well (Mapook et al., 2020). Up to date, 39 accepted Montagnula species are listed in Index Fungorum (2022). In this study, we introduce Montagnula acaciae as a new species and new host record of M. jonesii from Ficus benjamina.\n\nMontagnula acaciae Tennakoon and S. Lumyong, sp. nov. (Figure 1).\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nEtymology: Name reflects the host genus Acacia.\n\nIndex Fungorum Number: IF559599.\n\nFacesoffungi number: FoF 10801.\n\nHolotype: MFLU 18-2569.\n\nSaprobic on dead stem of Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. (Fabaceae). Sexual morph: Ascomata 140–180 μm high × 150–200 μm diam. (x̄ = 160 × 175 μm, n = 10), solitary or scattered, coriaceous, immersed to semi-immersed, partly erumpent, unilocular, globose to obpyriform, brown to dark brown, ostiolate, with minute papilla, filled with hyaline cells. Peridium 10–20 μm wide, outer layer comprising light brown to dark brown, thick-walled, cells of textura angularis, inner layer comprising hyaline, flattened, thin-walled cells of textura angularis. Hamathecium comprising 1.3–2.4 μm wide, cylindrical to filiform, branched, septate pseudoparaphyses. Asci 50–90 × 8–10 μm (x̄ = 72 × 9 μm, n = 20), 8-spored, bitunicate, fissitunicate, clavate to cylindrical, with a long pedicel, slightly curved, rounded at the apex and with a shallow ocular chamber. Ascospores 10–15 × 4–7 μm (x̄ = 12 × 6 μm, n = 30), overlapping, 1–2-seriate, fusiform to ellipsoid, initially hyaline or pale brown, becoming light brown to dark brown, 1-septate, constricted at the septum, upper cell slightly wider, tapering toward ends, slightly curved. Asexual morph: Undetermined.\n\nCulture characteristics: Colonies growing on PDA, 15–20 mm diam. after 3 weeks at 25°C, colonies circular, dense, flattened, surface slightly rough, entire edge, velvety; from above: dark brown at margin, gray to slightly greenish at center; reverse: dark brown to black at the margin and center, mycelium greenish to greenish gray.\n\nMaterial examined: Thailand, Chiang Mai, on dead stem of Acacia auriculiformis (Fabaceae), 25 March 2016, D.S. Tennakoon, TD001A (MFLU 18-2569, holotype); ex-type living culture, MFLUCC 18-1636. ibid. 28 March 2016, TD001B (NCYU 19-0255, Paratype); ex-paratype living culture, NCYUCC 19-0087.\n\nNotes: The morphological characteristics of Montagnula acaciae agree well with those described for Montagnula species (immersed to semi-immersed or erumpent ascomata; clavate to cylindrical, long pedicellate asci; and light brown to dark brown, 1-septate ascospores) (Hyde et al., 2013; Hongsanan et al., 2020; Mapook et al., 2020). The generated phylogeny (LSU, SSU, ITS, and tef1-α) shows that M. acaciae forms a distinct sister lineage to the clade formed by M. chromolaenicola, M. donacina, M. graminicola, M. puerensis, M. saikhuensis, and M. thailandica with strong statistical support (96% ML, 1.00 BYPP, Figure 2). Morphologically, M. acaciae differs from M. saikhuensis and M. puerensis in having smaller ascomata (140–180 × 150–200 μm), whereas M. saikhuensis and M. puerensis have larger ascomata (400–450 × 400–500 and 300–600 × 230–380 μm). Montagnula donacina differs from M. acaciae in having carbonaceous ascostromata with a flat bottom (Pitt et al., 2014). In addition, M. graminicola can be differentiated from M. acaciae in having verrucous ascospores, not constricted in the middle, and surrounded by obvious sheaths (Liu et al., 2015). Interestingly, we found that the morphological characteristics of M. acaciae share similarities with M. thailandica, but they are phylogenetically distinct (Figure 2). We compared the base pair differences of the ITS (+5.8S) gene region of M. acaciae and M. thailandica, and there were 12 base pair differences (2.18%) across 550 nucleotides. In addition, there were 22 base pair differences (2.51%) across 880 nucleotides of tef1-α gene region as well. The main morphology differences of Montagnula species are provided in Table 5.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nTABLE 5\n\nMontagnula jonesii Tennakoon, Wanas., Phook. and K.D. Hyde, Mycosphere 7: 1350 (2016) (Figure 3).\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nIndex Fungorum Number: IF552577.\n\nFacesoffungi number: FoF 02719.\n\nSaprobic on dead stem of Ficus benjamina L. (Moraceae). Sexual morph: Ascomata 150–200 μm high × 175–275 μm diam. (x̄ = 175 × 210 μm, n = 10), scattered to clustered, solitary, immersed to semi-immersed, erumpent, globose to sub-globose, glabrous, dark brown to black, uniloculate, ostiolate. Peridium 10–20 μm wide, thin-walled with equal thickness, composed of several layers of hyaline, pseudoparenchymatous cells, arranged in a textura angularis. Hamathecium comprising 1.5–2.5 μm wide, cylindrical to filiform, cellular pseudoparaphyses, septate, not constricted at the septum, anastomosing at the apex, embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Asci 60–72 × 8–10 μm (x̄ = 65 × 9 μm, n = 20), bitunicate, 8-spored, clavate, apically rounded, with a long pedicel, with an ocular chamber. Ascospores 13.5–16 × 4.5–5.5 μm (x̄ = 15 × 5 μm), overlapping 1–2-seriate, ellipsoidal to fusiform with rounded ends, hyaline or pale brown when immature, brown to reddish-brown when mature, mostly 1-septate at immature, 3-septate at mature, constricted at the septa, slightly curved, second cell enlarge from apex, guttulate, smooth-walled. Asexual morph: Undetermined.\n\nKnown hosts: Fagus sylvatica and Ficus benjamina (Tennakoon et al., 2016; This study).\n\nKnown distribution: Italy and China (Tennakoon et al., 2016; This study).\n\nMaterial examined: China, Taiwan region, Chiayi, Dahu Forest, on a dead stem of Ficus benjamina (Moraceae), 26 August 2018, D.S. Tennakoon, D008 (MFLU 18-0084).\n\nNotes: Tennakoon et al. (2016) introduced Montagnula jonesii from Fagus sylvatica in Italy. The morphological characteristics of our collection (MFLU 18-0084) resemble M. jonesii (MFLU 16-1363) in having globose to sub-globose, immersed to semi-immersed, erumpent ascomata; clavate, apically rounded, long pedicellate asci; and brown to reddish-brown, ellipsoidal to fusiform, 3-septate ascospores with enlarge second cell from apex (Tennakoon et al., 2016). Our phylogeny also shows that our collection cluster with M. jonesii (MFLU 16-1363), and it is supported by phylogenetic data (100% ML, 1.00 BYPP, Figure 4). We therefore consider MFLU 18-0084 as a new host record of M. jonesii from Ficus benjamina.\n\nFIGURE 4\n\nPhylogenetic and taxonomic results of Paraconiothyrium\n\nParaconiothyrium Verkley\n\nNotes: Paraconiothyrium is a diverse genus, which was introduced by Verkley et al. (2004). Members of this genus play a crucial function as saprobes on dead plants, particularly dead wood, and occasionally on dead leaves (Verkley et al., 2004; Hyde et al., 2013; Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Hongsanan et al., 2020; Boonmee et al., 2021). In addition, since the species has been found in both temperate and tropical countries (e.g., Australia, China, India, Iran, Laos, Myanmar, Poland, Thailand, the United States, and Uzbekistan), Paraconiothyrium appears to have a global distribution (Verkley et al., 2004, 2014; Budziszewska et al., 2011; Ariyawansa et al., 2014b, 2020; Crous et al., 2017; Gafforov, 2017; Hongsanan et al., 2020; Boonmee et al., 2021). Paraconiothyrium has diverse morphology characteristics, such as eustromatic to pycnidial conidiomata, phialidic or annelidic conidiogenous cells, and hyaline to brown conidia (Verkley et al., 2004, 2014). Currently, 19 Paraconiothyrium species are accepted in Index Fungorum (2022). In this study, we introduce Paraconiothyrium zingiberacearum as a new species, and P. archidendri, P. brasiliense and P. fuckelii as new host records. In addition, P. rosae was synonymized under P. fuckelii based on strong morphological similarities and phylogeny data.\n\nParaconiothyrium archidendri Verkley, Göker and Stielow, Persoonia 32: 37 (2014) (Figure 5).\n\nFIGURE 5\n\nIndex Fungorum Number: IF800761.\n\nFacesoffungi number: FoF 05243.\n\nSaprobic on dead twigs of Magnolia sp.

(2014) described Paraconiothyrium archidendri, which was associated with leaf spots of Pithecellobium bigeminum in Myanmar. Phylogenetic analyses show that a new strain (MFLUCC 19-0043) clustered with other strains of P. archidendri, in particular close to the isolate MFLUCC 17-2429 with 85% ML and 0.98 BYPP statistical support (Figure 4). The new collection (MFLU 18-2653) morphologically fits with the description of P. archidendri (CBS 168.77 and MFLUCC 17-2429) in having globose to sub-globose pycnidia, globose to doliiform conidiogenous cells and olivaceous-brown, sub-globose or ellipsoid, aseptate conidia (Verkley et al., 2014; Jayasiri et al., 2019). Thus, we report this new collection as a new host record of P. archidendri from dead twigs of Magnolia sp. in China.\n\nParaconiothyrium brasiliense Verkley, Stud.

(Magnoliaceae), 27 March 2017, N.I. de Silva, NI270 (MFLU 18-2649), living culture, MFLUCC 19-0040.\n\nNotes: Phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated LSU, ITS, and tub2 sequence data show that our strain (MFLUCC 19-0040) forms a well-supported clade, grouping with several strains of Paraconiothyrium brasiliense (80% ML, 0.99 BYPP, Figure 4). In particular, our strain provides a close phylogenetic relationship (87% ML, 0.95 BYPP) with the type of P. brasiliense (CBS 122851) and another strain of P. brasiliense (CBS 1223200). Paraconiothyrium brasiliense was described from fruits of Coffea arabica in Brazil (Verkley et al., 2014). This species shows widespread distribution and found on a wide range of host plants (Damm et al., 2008). Paraconiothyrium brasiliense was isolated as endophytes from Ginkgo biloba (Damm et al., 2008), Acer pentaphyllum in Korea (Paul and Lee, 2014), and healthy twig of Cinnamomum camphora in Japan (Nakashima et al., 2019). P. brasiliense was found associated with necrotic symptoms on Prunus salicina in South Africa (Damm et al., 2008). In this study, we identify our saprobic strain (MFLUCC 19-0040) as P. brasiliense and report its occurrence on Magnolia sp. in China for the first time.\n\nParaconiothyrium fuckelii (Sacc.)

Conidiogenous cells 4–8 × 3–5 μm (x̄ = 5.2 × 4 μm, n = 20), discrete or integrated in short, simple, broadly ampulliform to globose, holoblastic, often annellidic, hyaline.

(De Gruyter et al., 2006; Verkley et al., 2014; Gafforov, 2017; Jamali, 2020; this study).\n\nKnown distribution: China, Denmark, Germany, Iran, Netherlands, Thailand and Uzbekistan (De Gruyter et al., 2006; Ariyawansa et al., 2014a,b; Verkley et al., 2014; Gafforov, 2017; this study).\n\nMaterial examined: China, Taiwan region, Chiayi, Ali Shan Mountain, on dead leaves of Dimocarpus longan (Sapindaceae), 05 September 2018, D.S. Tennakoon, TAP020 (MFLU 18-2605); living culture, MFLUCC 19-0067.\n\nNotes: Paraconiothyrium fuckelii was first introduced by Saccardo (1876) from cane lesions on raspberry, similar to Coniothyrium fuckelii. Subsequently, C. fuckelii was synonymized under Paraconiothyrium by De Gruyter et al. (2006), based on morphology combined with phylogeny data. The morphological characteristics of our collection (MFLU 18-2605) resemble previously introduced authentic P. fuckelii isolates in having pycnidial, immersed, light brown to dark brown, globose to sub-globose conidiomata, ampulliform to globose, holoblastic conidiogenous cells and sub-globose to ellipsoid or obovoid, hyaline to light brown, aseptate conidia (Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Verkley et al., 2014). Multi-gene phylogeny also directs that our collection (MFLU 18-2605) groups with other P. fuckelii isolates in a highly supported clade (97% ML, 0.99 BYPP, Figure 4). In particular, our isolate shows a close phylogeny relationship (99% ML, 1.00 BYPP) with the isolate MFLUCC 13-0073, which was introduced by Ariyawansa et al. (2014b) from Thailand (Figure 4). Hence, we consider MFLU 18-2605 as a new host record of P. fuckelii from Dimocarpus longan (Sapindaceae). Paraconiothyrium fuckelii seems to have a cosmopolitan distribution since it has been reported from different plant families, such as Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Pinaceae, and Sapindaceae worldwide (Kuter, 1986; De Gruyter et al., 2006; Mułenko et al., 2008; Kowalski and Andruch, 2012; Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Verkley et al., 2014). Many researchers have identified the asexual morph of this species and a sexual morph introduced by Ariyawansa et al. (2014b), which has immersed to erumpent, globose or sub-globose, coriaceous, ostiolate ascomata; clavate asci; and pale brown, 3-septate, narrowly ovoid to clavate ascospores.\n\nIn addition, P. rosae was introduced by Wanasinghe et al. (2018) from dead aerial spines of Rosa canina (Rosaceae) without statistical support. In the present phylogenetic analyses, P. rosae groups well with P. fuckelii isolates in a highly supported clade (97% ML, 0.99 BYPP, Figure 4). The morphological characteristics of P. rosae also agree well with P. fuckelii in having pycnidial, immersed or semi-immersed, globose to sub-globose conidiomata and sub-globose to ellipsoid or obovoid, hyaline to light brown, aseptate conidia (Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Verkley et al., 2014; Wanasinghe et al., 2018). Therefore, we treat P. rosae as a synonym of P. fuckelii in this study.\n\nParaconiothyrium zingiberacearum Tennakoon and S. Lumyong, sp. nov.

Koenig (Zingiberaceae). Sexual morph: Ascomata 100–170 μm high × 120–220 μm diam. (x̄ = 150 × 180 μm, n = 10), solitary or clustered, coriaceous, immersed to semi-immersed, erumpent, globose to sub-globose, unilocular, brown to dark brown. Peridium 20–30 μm wide, outer layer containing light brown to dark brown, thick-walled, tightly packed cells of textura angularis, inner layer containing flattened, hyaline, thin-walled, loosely packed cells of textura angularis. Hamathecium comprising 1.5–3 μm wide, cylindrical to filiform, septate, cellular pseudoparaphyses. Asci 50–60 × 5.5–7 μm (x̄ = 53 × 6.5 μm, n = 20), bitunicate, 8-spored, fissitunicate, clavate to cylindrical, apex rounded, short pedicel, with a shallow ocular chamber. Ascospores 11–14 × 2.5–4 μm (x̄ = 12.5 × 3 μm, n = 30), overlapping, 1–2-seriate, light brown, broadly fusiform with acute ends, 1-septate, slightly curved, rough-walled, guttulate, without a mucilaginous sheath. Asexual morph: Undetermined.\n\nCulture characteristics: Colonies growing on PDA, 10–12 mm diam. after 3 weeks at 25°C, colonies circular, slightly dense, surface smooth, crenate edge, cottony; from above: white to cream at the margin, cream to gray in the center; reverse: white at the margin, light brown to yellowish in the center.\n\nMaterial examined: China, Taiwan region, Chiayi, on a dead stem of Hedychium coronarium (Zingiberaceae), 05 August 2017, D.S. Tennakoon, NSP002a (NCYU 19-0320, holotype); ex-type living culture, NCYUCC 19-0230. ibid. 08 August 2017, NSP002b (MFLU 18-0091, Paratype); ex-paratype living culture, MFLUCC 18-0559.\n\nNotes: Phylogenetic analyses indicate that our collection (MFLU 18-0091 and NCYU 19-0320) is grouped with Paraconiothyrium estuarinum with high statistical support (89% ML, 0.96 BYPP, Figure 4). The asexual morph of P. estuarinum was introduced by Verkley et al. (2004) from an estuarine sediment polluted with industrial discharges in Brazil. However, we were unable to compare our collection with the asexual morph of P. estuarinum (CBS 109850) because it failed to sporulate even after 2 months of the incubation period (Verkley et al., 2004). Therefore, we compared the base pair differences between our collection and P. estuarinum. There are 10 base pair differences (2.21%) across 451 nucleotides across the tub2 gene region and 11 base pair differences (2.17%) across 506 nucleotides across the ITS (+5.8S) gene region. Phylogeny also indicates that the clade containing our collection and P. estuarinum provides sister lineage to P. cyclothyrioides (Figure 4). The sexual morph of P. cyclothyrioides differs from our collection in having olive-brown, 3-septate, cylindrical to ellipsoidal ascospores with obtusely rounded ends, whereas our collection has light brown, 1-septeate, broadly fusiform ascospores with acute ends (Hyde et al., 2020a). Hence, based on significant differences, we present our collection as a novel species, P. zingiberacearum from dead stems of Hedychium coronarium (Zingiberaceae).\n\nPhylogenetic and taxonomic results of Paraphaeosphaeria\n\nParaphaeosphaeria O. E. Erikss\n\nNotes: Paraphaeosphaeria was established by Eriksson (1967) to include four species, which have oblong-cylindric ascospores. The sexual morphs of Paraphaeosphaeria have immersed or semi-immersed ascomata, short pedicellate asci, and broadly elliptical, yellowish brown, multi-septate ascospores (Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Hongsanan et al., 2020). Asexual morphs have pycnidial conidiomata and aseptate or 1-septate conidia (Wanasinghe et al., 2018; Hongsanan et al., 2020). Ariyawansa et al. (2014b) verified the phylogenetic placement of this genus in Didymosphaeriaceae. Currently, 30 species epithets are listed under Paraphaeosphaeria in Index Fungorum (2022). In this study, we introduce a new species (P. brachiariae) from dead leaves of Brachiaria mutica.\n\nParaphaeosphaeria brachiariae Tennakoon and S. Lumyong, sp. nov.

Peridium 10–20 μm wide, comprising light brown to dark brown, thick-walled, loosely packed cells of textura angularis. Hamathecium comprising 1.5–2.5 μm wide, cylindrical to filiform, branched, septate, pseudoparaphyses. Asci 58–65 × 11–13 μm (x̄ = 62 × 12.5 μm, n = 20), bitunicate, 8-spored, fissitunicate, clavate to cylindrical, apex rounded, short pedicellate, with a shallow ocular chamber. Ascospores 14–20 × 4–6 μm (x̄ = 16 × 5 μm, n = 30), overlapping, 1–2-seriate, light brown, fusiform with rounded ends, straight or slightly curved, with 1–2-septate, guttulate, rough-walled, without a mucilaginous sheath. Asexual morph: Undetermined.\n\nCulture characteristics: Colonies growing on PDA, 12–15 mm diam. after 3 weeks at 25°C, colonies circular, smooth surface, crenate edge, cottony; from above: light brown to greenish at the margin, gray in the center; reverse: light brown to yellowish at the margin, brown in the center, mycelium greenish to whitish gray.\n\nMaterial examined: China, Taiwan region, Chiayi, on dead leaves of Brachiaria mutica (Poaceae), 10 July 2019, D.S. Tennakoon, PC058A (NCYU 19-0058, holotype); ex-type living culture, NCYUCC 19-0342. ibid. 18 July 2019, PC058A (MFLU 19-2799, Paratype); paratype living culture, NCYUCC 19-0343.\n\nNotes: The morphological characteristics of our collection (MFLU 19-2799 and NCYU 19-0058) agree well within the species concept of Paraphaeosphaeria in having immersed or semi-immersed ascomata, short pedicellate asci, and broadly elliptical, multi-septate, yellowish brown ascospores (Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Hongsanan et al., 2020). Phylogeny (LSU, SSU, ITS, and tub2) shows that our collection (MFLU 19-2799 and NCYU 19-0058) grouped with P. angularis with high statistical support (99% ML, 1.00 BYPP). The asexual morph of P. angularis was introduced by Verkley et al. (2014) from Saccharum officinarum in Brazil. A comparison of 539 nucleotides across the ITS (+5.8S) gene region of P. angularis (CBS 167.70) and our collection (MFLU 19-2799) shows 11 base pair differences (2.04%). We compared 452 nucleotides across the tub2 gene as well, and there were 12 base pair differences (2.65%). Thus, we present our collection as a new species, P. brachiariae from Brachiaria mutica.\n\nPhylogenetic and taxonomic results of Spegazzinia\n\nSpegazzinia Sacc\n\nNotes: Saccardo (1880) established Spegazzinia to include S. ornata as the type species. This genus was previously placed in Apiosporaceae (Sordariomycetes) by Hyde et al. (1998), based on its morphological characteristics. Subsequently, its phylogenetic placement was revealed by Tanaka et al. (2015) and accommodated in Didymosphaeriaceae (Dothideomycetes). Spegazzinia has a diverse distribution worldwide as saprobes on dead materials of vascular plants (Leão-Ferreira and Gusmão, 2010; Manoharachary and Kunwar, 2010; Thambugala et al., 2017; Samarakoon et al., 2020; Tennakoon et al., 2021), endophytes from lichens, and plant leaves (Crous et al., 2019), and even they have been recorded from soil (Ellis, 1971). The conidial morphology and basauxic conidiogenesis of Spegazzinia differentiate it apart from other dematiaceous hyphomycetes. The majority has distinct morphological characteristics in the shapes of α and β conidia (Hongsanan et al., 2020). A total of 14 Spegazzinia species are currently listed in Index Fungorum (2022). In this study, we introduce two new host records of Spegazzinia deightonii and S. tessarthra from Hedychium coronarium and Acacia auriculiformis, respectively.\n\nSpegazzinia deightonii (S.

Phylogenetic analyses of this study indicate that our collection is nested with other S. deightonii isolates in a well-supported clade (92% ML, 0.95 BYPP) (Figure 11). As well as, our collection (MFLU 18-2564) shows a close phylogenetic relationship with the isolate yone 212, which was introduced by Tanaka et al. (2015) from Japan. Both isolates share similar morphological characteristics, such as 8-celled, disked-shaped, dark brown, spiny conidia (Tanaka et al. 2015). Spegazzinia deightonii has previously been recorded from many host species (e.g., Areca catechu, Cocos nucifera, Musa sp., and Panicum maximum), and this is the first host record from Hedychium coronarium (Zingiberaceae) in Thailand.\n\nFIGURE 11\n\nSpegazzinia tessarthra (Berk. and M.A. Curtis) Sacc., Syll.

Conidia solitary, two types, α conidia stellate, 15–20 × 14–18 μm (x̄ = 17 × 16 μm, n = 20), globose to sub-globose, 4–6-celled, deeply constricted at the septa, conspicuously spinulate, 4–6 spines, each spine 2–8 μm long. β conidia 10–15 × 8–12 μm (x̄ = 12 × 11 μm, n = 20), disc-shaped, initially hyaline, becoming light brown to dark brown at maturity, 4-celled, rough-walled, crossed septate, smooth-walled, somewhat obovoid, deeply constricted at the septa, dark brown in constricted areas, flat from side view.\n\nCulture characteristics: Colonies growing on PDA, 10–12 mm diam. after 3 weeks at 25°C, colonies circular, dense, smooth surface, entire edge, cottony; from above: light brown to yellowish at the margin, dark brown to black in the center; reverse: yellowish brown at the margin, dark brown to black in the center, mycelium dark brown to dark gray.\n\nKnown hosts: Acacia auriculiformis, Ochroma pyramidale and Zea mays (Berkeley and Curtis, 1869; Tanaka et al., 2015; Farr and Rossman, 2022; this study).\n\nKnown distribution: Cuba, India, Japan, and Thailand (Berkeley and Curtis, 1869; Tanaka et al., 2015; Farr and Rossman, 2022; this study).\n\nMaterial examined: Thailand, Ching Rai, a dead stem of Acacia auriculiformis (Fabaceae), 15 July 2018, D.S. Tennakoon, DP003 (MFLU 18-2557); living culture, MFLUCC 18-1624.\n\nNotes: New collection (MFLU 18-2557) resembles Spegazzinia tessarthra (SH 287), which was introduced by Tanaka et al. (2015) from balsa wood in Japan. Both isolates have two types of conidia (α conidia: 4–6-celled, globose to sub-globose, 4–6 spines; β conidia: disc-shaped, 4-celled, light brown to dark brown) (Tanaka et al., 2015). Multi-gene (LSU, SSU, ITS, and tef1-α) phylogenetic analyses also indicate that our collection (MFLU 18-2557) groups with S. tessarthra isolates (NRRL 54913, SH 287) in a well-supported clade (93% ML, 0.99 BYPP, Figure 11). Hence, we consider MFLU 18-2557 as a new host record of S. tessarthra from Acacia auriculiformis (Fabaceae) in Thailand. This species has previously been recorded from Acacia auriculiformis, Ochroma pyramidale, and Zea mays (Berkeley and Curtis, 1869; Tanaka et al., 2015; Farr and Rossman, 2022).\n\nDiscussion\n\nDidymosphaeriaceae species has a great variation in morphologies, phylogenies, ecologies, and nutritional modes (Hyde et al., 2013; Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2015; Gonçalves et al., 2019; Htet et al., 2021; Suwannarach et al., 2021). It has a diverse range of nutritional modes, such as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes in plant substrates (Zhang et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2015; Gonçalves et al., 2019; Suwannarach et al., 2021). Researchers have referred this family into several higher taxa due to the uncertainty of the taxonomic placement (von Arx and Müller, 1975; Lumbsch and Huhndorf, 2007; Crous et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). For instance, this family was a synonym of Pleosporaceae (von Arx and Müller, 1975), and Barr (1990) referred Didymosphaeriaceae in Melanommatales. Aptroot (1995) assigned this as a separate family within Pleosporales, and Lumbsch and Huhndorf (2007) treated Didymosphaeriaceae members to the Montagnulaceae in their outline of Ascomycota. However, the confusion surrounding the genera of Didymosphaeriaceae and Montagnulaceae was debated by Ariyawansa et al. (2014a), and they pointed out Didymosphaeriaceae as a distinct family in Pleosporales upon morphology, but phylogenetically, it fits well with Montagnulaceae. Thus, Ariyawansa et al. (2014b) synonymized Montagnulaceae under Didymosphaeriaceae and accepted 16 genera in this family. Over time, numerous genera have been introduced, and currently, 32 genera are accepted in Didymosphaeriaceae (Hongsanan et al., 2020).\n\nVarious approaches have been used to identify Didymosphaeriaceae species over the years. Earlier, morphology-based species recognition was the key method for identifying Didymosphaeriaceae species, and most studies have been used drawings with descriptions (von Arx and Müller, 1975; Sutton, 1980; Barr, 1990). However, morphology-based species identification suffered various issues, including phenotypic plasticity, which may lead to countless misinterpretations. However, by using molecular techniques for species delineation, identification, and taxonomic classifications, this fungal taxonomy undergone a revolution (Ariyawansa et al., 2014a; Das et al., 2014; Chethana et al., 2020). Therefore, most of recent studies have integrated morphology and phylogeny data for Didymosphaeriaceae species identification, taxonomic classification, and phylogenetic inferences (Ariyawansa et al., 2014a,b; Wanasinghe et al., 2016; Mapook et al., 2020; Htet et al., 2021; Suwannarach et al., 2021). Apart from morphology and phylogeny classifications, some researchers have been carried out to estimate the divergence time of this family using molecular clock analyses (Khodaei et al., 2019), and some have investigated the secondary metabolites or biological functions of Didymosphaeriaceae species (Wang et al., 2021).\n\nThe phylogeny recovered in this study agrees well with previous Didymosphaeriaceae studies within Pleosporales (Ariyawansa et al., 2014b; Wanasinghe et al., 2018; Phookamsak et al., 2019; Mapook et al., 2020; Phukhamsakda et al., 2020). The morphological characteristics of the novel species (Montagnula acaciae, Paraconiothyrium zingiberacearum, and Paraphaeosphaeria brachiariae) fit well with the respective genera, are phylogenetically distinct from other species, and group with high statistical evidence (Figures 2, 4, 11, 13). Also, the morphology of the new host records (Montagnula jonesii, Paraconiothyrium archidendri, P. brasiliense, P. fuckelii, Spegazzinia deightonii, and S. tessarthra) also agrees with their respective type species (Saccardo, 1876; Ariyawansa et al., 2014a,b; Tanaka et al., 2015; Tennakoon et al., 2016). Overall, this work offers fascinating taxonomic insights into Didymosphaeriaceae species. In particular, the findings provide evidence to show the vast range of fungal diversity in litter substrates (e.g., dead leaves and dead stems), even within a single family, Didymosphaeriaceae. But, to determine whether these fungal species are generalists or specialists, more ecological studies are required. Furthermore, it is worthy to note that several Didymosphaeriaceae genera still lack molecular data to determine the phylogenetic placement (e.g., Barria and Lineostroma). Therefore, it is necessary to collect, isolate, and retrieve sequence data for more Didymosphaeriaceae species in future studies.\n\nFIGURE 13\n\nConclusion\n\nStudies on fungal species in plant litter are particularly pertinent in the current climate change scenario since climate plays a crucial role in decomposition and, ultimately, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, and the global carbon cycle. This study revealed plant litter inhabiting three new fungal species (Montagnula acaciae, Paraconiothyrium zingiberacearum, and Paraphaeosphaeria brachiariae) and six new host records (Montagnula jonesii, Paraconiothyrium archidendri, P. brasiliense, P. fuckelii, Spegazzinia deightonii, and S. tessarthra) from China and Thailand. In addition, Paraconiothyrium rosae was synonymized under P. fuckelii based on morphology and phylogeny data. We believe that this study sheds light on the plant litter-dwelling fungal communities, which are diverse and astonishing.\n\nData availability statement\n\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
