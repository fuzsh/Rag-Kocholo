        "text": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is one of the important root crops in tropical and subtropical countries. In Fiji, cassava is cultivated for both food and income. However, cassava is vulnerable to incidence of multiple diseases caused by different pathogens and fungus. In this particular study cassava brown leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora heningsii is investigated to determine its incidence and prevalence in three different villages in Vanua Levu (Mani Road, Boca, and Anuve). A Z (Zigzag) transect was employed to determine both prevalence and incidence. Percentage of disease prevalence and incidence are calculated using two separate equations. Results revealed its incidence in all three villages, where Anuve (42.9%) records the highest incidence, followed by Mani road (38.2%), and lowest in Boca (36.4%). Its prevalence is 100% in all three villages. Assessment of the Cercospora heningsii disease is fundamental to predicting crop yield as basis for smooth running of market, financ...\n\nBackground: Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) is one of the major diseases causing a major loss in production of mung bean of up to 60%. Although it is cultivated all round the world, its major contribution is attributed to the Asian continent especially the countries of Indian subcontinents which accounts for about 90% of the world’s mungbean production. Due to its high nutritional content, mung bean is a major contributor to the Nation’s economy. The present study was to isolate and characterize the new isolates of Cercospora canescens collected from coastal belts of Odisha, India. Methods: Surveys were conducted in the mung bean growing fields of Bhubaneswar (20.26°N, 85.8°E) and Berhampur (19.36°N, 84.77°E), coastal regions of Odisha during 2018-20. New Cercospora canescens isolates were collected and characterised through morphological, biochemical and molecular basis. Result: New Cercospora isolates were characterized on the basis of morphological, biochemical and molecular analysis ...\n\nDiseases of soybean caused byCercospora spp. are endemic throughout the world’s soy-bean production regions. Species diversity in the genusCercospora has been underesti-mated due to overdependence onmorphological characteristics, symptoms, and host associations. Currently, only two species (Cercospora kikuchii andC. sojina) are recognized to infect soybean;C. kikuchii causes Cercospora leaf blight (CLB) and purple seed stain (PSS), whereas C. sojina causes frogeye leaf spot. To assess cryptic speciation among path-ogens causing CLB and PSS, phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed with isolates from the top three soybean producing countries (USA, Brazil, and Argentina; col-lectively accounting for ~80 % of global production). Eight nuclear genes and one mitochon-drial gene were partially sequenced and analyzed. Additionally, amino acid substitutions conferring fungicide resistance were surveyed, and the production of cercosporin (a polyke-tide toxin produced bymanyCe..."
