        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe genus Cercospora comprises more than 700 accepted species (Bánki et al., 2021), which are widely distributed and may be pathogens, saprophytes, endophytes, or mycoparasites (Jayawardena et al., 2020; To-Anun et al., 2011). Species of Cercospora can infect various plants, including cereals, grasses, field crops, vegetables, ornamentals and trees, commonly resulting in leaf spots (Groenewald et al., 2013).\n\nCercospora spp. are capable of infecting plants across many families, including members of the Araceae. The family Araceae encompasses a large and diverse group of plants, including many cultivated plants, some of which have great economic importance for various uses, including as ornamentals (Mayo et al., 1997). Tropical ornamental aroids include popular houseplants such as anthuriums (Anthurium spp.), calla lilies (Zantedeschia spp.), Chinese evergreens (Aglaonema spp.), dumb canes (Dieffenbachia spp.), monsteras (Monstera spp.), philodendrons (Philodendron spp.) and pothos (Epipremnum spp.), which are grown and sold commercially and are among the most important foliage and flowers in the cut flower market (Chen et al., 2007; Henny, 1988; Mayo et al., 1997; Pedralli, 2002).\n\nAmong the aroids, about 25% of species are affected by at least one Cercospora species (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024). Nevertheless, reports of Cercospora spp. attacking aroids in Brazil are few. Only seven records of Cercospora spp. on Araceae in Brazil have been published. These were members of the following genera: Caladium, Montrichardia, Pistia and Zantedeschia (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024).\n\nEpipremnum aureum (Linden & André) G. S. Bunting and Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng. are two popular ornamental aroid species in the tropics, including in Brazil. Epipremnum aureum, commonly known as golden pothos, money plant, devil's vine (jiboia in Brazil) is a native vine from the Pacific Islands. Despite its use as an ornamental plant, it is considered a noxious invasive species in Hawaii, South Africa, parts of Asia (Moodley et al., 2017) and Florida (FISC, 2019). Zantedeschia aethiopica is an African species, popularly known as calla lily or arum lily (copo-de-leite in Brazil). Similarly to E. aureum, it has both the status of a desirable and broadly cultivated ornamental and that of a less welcome invasive species in parts of Australia (Scott & Neser, 1996) and Greece (Galanos, 2015). The latter is of significant economic importance for the cut flower industry in Brazil (Lorenzi & de Souza, 2008).\n\nThe knowledge of pathogenic fungi associated with these two aroids is somewhat limited. In the case of E. aureum, 26 fungal species have been reported on that host in eight countries (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024), although in most cases, the demonstration of a pathogenic status for those fungi is lacking. A longer list of fungi has been documented on Z. aethiopica, with 41 associated with this host in 20 countries (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024).\n\nRecently, in July–August of 2022, E. aureum and Z. aethiopica plants grown on the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) were observed bearing leaf spots. In general, circular to elongated irregular lesions were observed on the leaves of infected plants. These lesions had a grey centre and were surrounded by necrotic brown tissue, followed by a yellow halo. Over time, lesions expanded and coalesced, leading to the yellowing and premature senescence of leaves. Both diseases were readily recognized as being caused by cercosporoid fungi. Here, a taxonomic and pathological study was performed to investigate the possibility of those two hosts being attacked by the same pathogenic fungus.\n\n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n2.1 Field collection and pathogen isolation\n\nPlants of E. aureum and Z. aethiopica bearing leaf spots were observed at two nearby localities within the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV), Viçosa, state of Minas Gerais (Brazil), namely: the University ornamental plant nursery (E. aureum) and the Infectarium – the plant disease demonstration garden (https://www.infectario.ufv.br/) (Z. aethiopica).\n\nLeaves exhibiting leaf spot symptoms were collected and taken to the laboratory for further examination under a stereoscopic microscope (SZX7, Olympus, Japan). Similar dematiaceous hyphomycete fungi were observed sporulating in the centre of the lesions on the two hosts. Representative samples of diseased material of each species were dried in a plant press and deposited in the Herbarium of UFV (acc. n° VIC 49389 for E. aureum and VIC 49409 for Z. aethiopica). Fungal structures were taken from fresh sporulating lesions of each specimen with a sterile fine-pointed needle and transferred onto potato dextrose-agar (PDA) plates, which were maintained in an incubator at 25 ± 2°C, for 5 days under a 12–h daily light regime. Pure cultures were obtained and a representative isolate of each host was deposited in the culture collection of UFV (COAD 3510 from E. aureum and COAD 3597 from Z. aethiopica).\n\n2.2 Morphological characterization\n\nThe fungi were identified through a combination of morphological and molecular characteristics following the polyphasic approach. Fungal structures were scraped from lesions on leaves, mounted in lactoglycerol and observed with a light microscope (BX-51, Olympus, Japan) equipped with a digital image capture system (Q-Colour 3™ camera, Olympus, Canada). In order to assess biometric data, fungal structures including conidiophores and conidia from each sample were measured, with a minimum of 30 structures being analysed. Samples from three separate plants bearing similar disease symptoms of each species were collected and examined and found to have the same cercosporoid fungus consistently associated with the necrotic tissues. Isolates growing on plates obtained from the three different plants had the same colony morphology. One typical isolate from each host (COAD 3510 and COAD 3597) was selected for further study. For colony description, isolates were transferred to PDA plates and kept in the dark for 15 days in an incubator adjusted to 25 ± 2°C. The colonies were described according to the guidelines provided by Crous et al. (2019) and colour terminology followed Rayner's colour chart (1970).\n\n2.3 Molecular characterization\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from 15-day-old cultures of COAD 3510 and COAD 3597 using a Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For DNA amplifications, fragments of three informative genes for the genus Cercospora were adopted (Jayawardena et al., 2020), namely: actin (act), calmodulin (cal) and histone3 (his3), with the primers pairs ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn, 1999), CAL-228F/CAL2Rd (Carbone & Kohn, 1999) and CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al., 2004), respectively, and following conditions provided by the authors.\n\nThe quality of PCR products was evaluated on 1% agarose electrophoresis gel stained with GelRed (Thermo Fisher Scientific), then amplicons were purified with ExoSAP-IT™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced by Macrogen Inc., South Korea (http://www.macrogen.com).\n\nThe resulting sequences were analysed using SeqAssem software ver. 07/2008 (Hepperle, 2021), ambiguities were adjusted manually and generated consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) (Table 1).\n\nSpecies Straina GenBank accession numbersb,c, b,c act cal his3 C. alchemillicola CPC 5259 JX143033 JX142787 JX142541 C. althaeina CBS 248.67 JX143038 JX142792 JX142546 C. apii CBS 116455 AY840450 AY840417 AY840384 C. apii CCTU 1215 KJ885929 KJ885768 KJ886090 C. beticola CBS 116456 AY840458 AY840425 AY840392 C. beticola CBS 116.47 AY752196 AY752227 AY752258 C. celosiae CBS 132600 JX143080 JX142834 JX142588 C. convolvulicola CCTU 1083 KJ885958 KJ885797 KJ886119 C. cylindracea CCTU 1081 KJ885966 KJ885805 KJ886127 C. fagopyri CBS 132623 JX143106 JX142860 JX142614 C. iranica CCTU 1137 KJ886030 KJ885869 KJ886191 C. kikuchii CBS 128.27 DQ835107 DQ835134 DQ835161 C. malayensis KUS-F27687 KY082664 KY082665 KY082666 C. cf. malloti MUCC 575 JX143138 JX142892 JX142646 C. cf. malloti MUCC 787 JX143139 JX142893 JX142647 C. plantaginis CBS 252.67 DQ233368 DQ233394 DQ233420 C. cf. richardiicola CBS 132627 JX143153 JX142907 JX142661 C. rodmanii CBS 113123 DQ835122 DQ835149 DQ835176 C. rumicis CPC 5439 JX143161 JX142915 JX142669 C. rumicis CCTU 1123 KJ886038 KJ885877 KJ886199 C. samambaiae CPC 24673 KT037596 KT037463 KT037555 C. cf. sigesbeckiae CBS 132675 JX143168 JX142922 JX142676 Cercospora sp.

(2022), Groenewald et al. (2013) Jayawardena et al. (2020) and the GenBank database (Table 1). Sequences of Septoria provencialis CBS 118910 were used as an outgroup. All sequences were aligned with the MUSCLE tool present in MEGA version 11 (Tamura et al., 2021) and alignments were combined using the SequenceMatrix ver. 1.8 software (Vaidya et al., 2011). Phylogenetic analyses were based on two methods: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). For this, tools implemented within the CIPRES Science Gateway Portal (Miller et al., 2010) were used.\n\nThe ML analysis used RAxML-HPC ver. 8.2.12 (Stamatakis, 2014). The best phylogenetic tree was obtained after sampling 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values (BS) higher than 70% were maintained in the resulting tree.\n\nFor the BI analysis, initially, the best substitution model for each genic region was obtained through ModelTest2 ver. 2.1.6 (Darriba et al., 2012), also present within the CIPRES portal. The model K80 + G was selected for the act and cal alignments, and HKY + G was used for the his3 region. Then, the phylogenetic tree was obtained using MrBayes ver. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al., 2012), employing the substitution models obtained and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Two simultaneous and independent analyses were conducted, each with four chains. In each analysis, trees were produced for 5,000,000 generations, and sampled every 500th generation, resulting in 10,000 trees. The first 25% of trees were discarded in the burn-in phase. Posterior probability values (PP) were obtained from the consensus tree generated from the remaining 7500 trees of each run. In the resulting tree, only PP values higher than .90 were maintained.\n\nThe resulting trees were visualized in TreeGraph 2 ver. 2.15.0-887 (Stöver & Müller, 2010), ML and BI topologies were compared and were similar, then BI topology was chosen and BS values were added.\n\n2.4 Pathogenicity and cross-pathogenicity tests\n\nInoculum of COAD 3510 and COAD 3597 was produced by following the methodology described in Zivanovic et al. (2021) with modifications. Isolates were transferred to plates containing PDA and maintained in an incubator under the same conditions described above for 21 days. The resulting colonies were transferred to beakers containing 300 mL of deionized water and triturated with a rotary homogenizer (model MA 102, Marconi, Brazil). Next, the suspensions of each isolate were filtered through household plastic sieves and two layers of cheesecloth before being used for inoculations.\n\nIn order to confirm the pathogenicity of the two selected isolates, two inoculation methods were employed. Initially, three 15- to 20-cm-long plants of E. aureum, grown from selected healthy cuttings (golden pothos) obtained from a local nursery and left in the greenhouse until well rooted and bearing 10 healthy fully expanded leaves, were brush inoculated with crude mycelial suspensions (produced as described above). However, this method did not yield symptoms on this host. Subsequently, another set of three plants, also having 10 healthy fully expanded leaves, had their leaves superficially wounded with sterile needles and brush inoculated with a mycelial suspension of COAD 3510. Additionally, three other plants with superficially wounded leaves were sprayed with COAD 3597 to assess a possible cross-pathogenicity of this isolate. Another plant, also superficially wounded prior to inoculation, was brushed with sterile water and served as the control.\n\nSimilarly, COAD 3597 was applied on three 15- to 20-cm-tall potted Z. aethiopica plants having at least seven fully expanded leaves. The first procedure described above for golden pothos (brushing without woundings) was used as no need for wounding in that case proved necessary. Also, in order to evaluate the cross-pathogenicity of COAD 3510, three additional Z. aethiopica plants were inoculated with this mycelial suspension. Another plant, with superficially wounded leaves, was treated with sterile water, serving as control.\n\nFollowing the treatments, all plants included in the test were maintained in a humid chamber for 72 h (provided by wrapping each vase containing a plant in a transparent plastic bag wetted internally and having a water-soaked cotton pad at the plant base) and then transferred to a greenhouse bench at ca. 25°C, under natural sunlight, irrigated twice a day. Plants were observed daily for the development of disease symptoms. When symptoms appeared, leaves were examined for sporulation of the dematiaceous fungus on the lesions. Slides were prepared with fungal structures for microscopic observation and isolation of the sporulating fungus was conducted, whenever those were detected, following the procedure described earlier.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we obtained Cercospora isolates from E. aureum and Z. aethiopica, two popular ornamental aroids in Brazil and worldwide. Based on multi-locus DNA sequence analyses and morphological and cultural characteristics, the isolates grouped within two ‘infraspecific taxa’ or candidate species to be segregated from C. apii – and referred to under provisional letter codes by Bakhshi et al. (2018) and Groenewald et al. (2013). The isolate obtained from E. aureum (COAD 3510) fell into the Cercospora sp. Q clade, whereas the isolate from Z. aethiopica (COAD 3597) fell into Cercospora sp. G clade.\n\nCercospora spp. are commonly recognized as the aetiological agents of leaf spots, but they can also induce necrotic lesions on flowers, fruits, bracts, seeds and pedicels across diverse plant families (Crous & Braun, 2003; Jayawardena et al., 2020). Some species are host specific, limited to a specific host genus or family. In contrast, other species are capable of infecting a variety of hosts (Chen et al., 2022; Groenewald et al., 2013).\n\nSince its establishment by Fresenius (in Fuckel, 1863), Cercospora has undergone extensive reviews. Initially, efforts to reassess and provide identity for cercosporoid fungi relied on morphological features, ecology and host range (Chupp, 1954; Crous & Braun, 2003; Pollack, 1987). However, due to the morphological similarity and difficulty in distinguishing Cercospora spp. (Chen et al., 2022), a polyphasic approach became critical for delimiting the taxa in the genus. This remains a ‘work in progress’.\n\nBased on partial sequences of distinct loci, namely ITS, act, cal, his3, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) (Groenewald et al., 2013), β-tubulin (tub2), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) (Bakhshi et al., 2018), researchers have sought an effective barcode for the genus. Although the gapdh locus was suggested as a potential candidate for improved species delimitation in this genus, none of these genes has been broadly accepted as DNA barcode for Cercospora until now (Bakhshi et al., 2018; Groenewald et al., 2013).\n\nThe phylogenetic species delimitation applied to our dataset, based on a three-gene analysis (combining act, cal and his3), resulted in COAD 3510 from E. aureum belonging to Cercospora sp. Q, and COAD 3597 from Z. aethiopica fitting into Cercospora sp. G.\n\nThe large assemblage of similar forms of Cercospora in C. apii s. lat. remains challenging to mycologists and appears inadequate for fungal taxonomy users, namely plant pathologists. In the case of Cercospora sp. G and Cercospora sp. Q, evidence from pathological associations could be interpreted as suggesting that they are conspecific. Both Cercospora sp. G and Q have an extensive list of hosts, affecting plants from diverse families, including Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Cannabaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Plantaginaceae and Poaceae (Bakhshi et al., 2018; Groenewald et al., 2013). Cercospora sp. G has been reported on Lolium multiflorum (Asteraceae) in Brazil (Arellano et al., 2021). On the campus of the Universidade Federal de Viçosa, the occurrence of Cercospora sp. Q was reported on Dioscorea cayennensis (Dioscoreaceae) (Torres et al., 2016) and later, in the same area in the Infectarium, on Humulus lupulus (Cannabaceae) (Pereira et al., 2023). Additionally, the same species was observed on Erythrina poeppigiana (Fabaceae) seedlings in a forest nursery in the city of Viçosa (Azevedo et al., 2017).\n\nNow, the occurrence of Cercospora sp. Q on E. aureum (at a close locality to the Infectarium on the university campus) and Cercospora sp. G on Z. aethiopica in the Infectarium, together with the results of the cross-inoculations complicates the distinction of those taxa even further. Some minor morphological and cultural differences between the specimens and cultures from the two aroids were noted, namely: dense compact tufts of conidiophores in VIC 49409 versus the less dense fascicles seen in VIC 49389; cultures of COAD 3510 and COAD 3597 had similar appearance, but COAD 3510 produced a sienna pigment in the medium, whereas COAD 3597 did not. Biometric data for the most relevant characters more or less overlapped and fell, as expected, within the boundaries of C. apii s. lat. (Crous & Braun, 2003). This is in opposition to the topology of the tree presented in Figure 1.\n\nRegardless of the pending elucidation of the taxonomy of the C. apii complex, no C. apii s. lat. has been recorded previously on the two hosts until now.\n\nOur observations also suggest that the leaves of E. aureum's leaves are more resistant to Cercospora leaf spot than Z. aethiopica leaves – as indicated by the need for wounding for infection to occur either by Cercospora sp. G or Q on E. aureum. This resistance could be attributed to inherent structural factors in plants, such as the presence of wax on the leaf surface, thickness of the cuticle and cell wall, distribution of stomata and tissue lignification (Király et al., 2007; War et al., 2012); as well as antimicrobial compounds produced by the plant (War et al., 2012). Such compounds are produced by E. aureum and are effective at inhibiting the growth of some bacteria, as demonstrated by Mehta et al. (2013).\n\nThe U.S. National Fungal Databases (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024) include a record of Cercospora richardiicola-infecting E. aureum in the USA. This is a species originally described on ‘Richardia africana’ (a synonym for Z. aethiopica) in the USA (Atkinson, 1891). The name, under the same grammatically mistaken name used by Atkinson ‘C. richardiaecola’ appeared later in Chupp (1954) for a series of specimens he examined. Much later this species has been reported on Z. aethiopica in Brazil (Vieira & Barreto, 2004), but under the same mistaken original orthography of Atkinson. Morphology of C. richardiicola as presented in the original description of Atkinson and the Brazilian report fits well into C. apii. Most likely, C. richardiicola is yet another late synonym for C. apii.\n\nNo cercosporoid fungus has been previously reported from Brazil on E. aureum. The sole fungal pathogen reported on E. aureum in Brazil is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Mariano et al., 1989; Paz et al., 1998). However, these records require verification since the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides complex has undergone major changes (Cannon et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012) and those are old records that did not include molecular-based identifications. Unfortunately, neither Mariano et al. (1989) nor Paz et al. (1998) indicated representative cultures in culture collections or even cited sample deposits in fungaria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of C. apii s. lat. causing leaf spots on E. aureum in Brazil and worldwide.\n\nOnly two fungal diseases have been reported in Brazil on the economically important arum lily: basal rot caused by Agroathelia rolfsii (Mesquita et al., 2007) and leaf spots caused by ‘C. richardiaecola’ (Vieira & Barreto, 2004). Besides the Brazilian record of C. richardiicola on Z. aethiopica, this fungus has been reported on this host in other countries, including China, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, South Africa and the USA (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024). Additionally, there are reports of C. apii and C. callae on Z. aethiopica in Iran, as well as in Spain and the USA, respectively (Castlebury & Dominick, 2024). It is likely that all such records represent occurrences of various populations of C. apii s. lat. (possibly Cercospora G).\n\nThe number of publications reporting the occurrence of pathogens in E. aureum and Z. aethiopica is limited, particularly in Brazil. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of fungal pathologies in such important plants for the Brazilian cut flowers and ornamental foliage industry. In parallel, they indicate that mycologists and plant pathologists need to search for a consensus nomenclature for C. apii s. lat. and its segregates towards serving better the end users of taxonomy and also serving the ideal of a polyphasic approach to taxonomy."
