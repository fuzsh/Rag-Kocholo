        "meta_description": "Background The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily is one of the largest, ubiquitous and diverse protein families in nature. Categorized into nine subfamilies, its members are important to most organisms including fungi, where they play varied roles in fundamental cellular processes, plant pathogenesis or fungicide tolerance. However, these proteins are not yet well-understood in the class Dothideomycetes, which includes several phytopathogens that infect a wide range of food crops including wheat, barley and maize and cause major economic losses.   Results We analyzed the genomes of 14 Dothideomycetes fungi (Test set) and seven well-known Ascomycetes fungi (Model set- that possessed gene expression/ functional analysis data about the ABC genes) and predicted 578 and 338 ABC proteins from each set respectively. These proteins were classified into subfamilies A to I, which revealed the distribution of the subfamily members across the Dothideomycetes and Ascomycetes genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of Dothideomycetes ABC proteins indicated evolutionary relationships among the subfamilies within this class. Further, phylogenetic relationships among the ABC proteins from the Model and the Test fungi within each subfamily were analyzed, which aided in classifying these proteins into subgroups. We compiled and curated functional and gene expression information from the previous literature for 118 ABC genes and mapped them on the phylogenetic trees, which suggested possible roles in pathogenesis and/or fungicide tolerance for the newly identified Dothideomycetes ABC proteins.   Conclusions The present analysis is one of the firsts to extensively analyze ABC proteins from Dothideomycetes fungi. Their phylogenetic analysis and annotating the clades with functional information indicated a subset of Dothideomycetes ABC genes that could be considered for experimental validation for their roles in plant pathogenesis and/or fungicide tolerance.",

        "text": "Phylogenetic relationships among Dothideomycetes and Ascomycetes ABC proteins\n\nThe ABC protein sequences identified from the Dothideomycetes and Ascomycetes genomes together with those from S. cerevisiae were divided into subfamilies A, BFT, BHT, C, D, E & F, G and I subsets (Table 1, S8 Table) and individually subjected to phylogenetic analysis (Figs 4â€“11). For each subfamily, the repertoire of ABC proteins in the fungi analyzed, their phylogenetic relationships together with patterns in gene expression and functional roles of the members in each clade is presented and discussed below."
