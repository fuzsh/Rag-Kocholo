discloses new antimicrobial compositions to control plant diseases and to prevent microbial spoilage of crops.\n\nPhenylpyrrole fungicides have not been immune to challenges in their development and maintenance. A large concern has been resistance development. Resistance to phenylpyrrole fungicides has been observed on several diseases now (see lacomi-Vasilescu et al., 2004; Kanetis et al., 2006; Kinay et al., 2007).\n\nthe polyene macrolide antimycotic natamycin has been used to prevent fungal growth on food products such as cheeses and sausages.\n\nThis natural preservative which is produced by fermentation using Streptomyces natalensis, is widely used throughout the world as a food preservative and has a long history of safe use in the food industry. It is very effective against all known food spoilage fungi.\n\nnatamycin has been applied for many years in e.g. the cheese industry, up to now development of resistant fungal species has never been observed. Consequently, it can be concluded that there is a severe need for more effective antimicrobial compositions, e.g. antifungal compositions, for the treatment of fungal growth in and on plants and crops.\n\nthe present invention solves the problem by providing a new synergistic antimicrobial, e.g. antifungal, composition comprising a polyene antifungal compound and at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides.\n\na new synergistic antimicrobial e.g. antifungal\n\ncomposition comprising a polyene antifungal compound and at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides.\n\nthe term \"synergisticâ means that the combined effect of the antifungal compounds when used in combination is greater than their additive effects when used individually.\n\nsynergistic activity of two active ingredients can be tested in for example the analysis of variance model using the treatment interaction stratum (see Slinker, 1998).\n\nRelative efficacy can be calculated by means of the following formula: ((value of evolution status of untreated control - value of evolution status of composition) / (value of evolution status of untreated control)) * 100.\n\nAn interaction coefficient can then be calculated by means of the following formula: ((relative efficacy of combination compound A + compound B) / (relative efficacy of compound A + relative efficacy of compound B)) * 100.\n\nAn interaction coefficient larger than 100 indicates synergy between the compounds.\n\nsynergy can be calculated as follows: the antifungal activity (in %) of the individual active ingredients can be determined by calculating the reduction in mould growth observed on products treated with the active ingredients in comparison to the mould growth on products treated with a control composition.\n\nthe expected antifungal activity (E in %) of the combined antifungal composition comprising both active ingredients can be calculated according to the Colby equation (Colby, 1967):\n\nE X + Y - [(X â Y) / 100], wherein X and Y are the observed antifungal activities (in %) of the individual active ingredients X and Y, respectively. If the observed antifungal activity (O in %) of the combination exceeds the expected antifungal activity (E in %) of the combination and the synergy factor O/E is thus > 1 .0, the combined application of the active ingredients leads to a synergistic antifungal effect.\n\nthe at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides is selected from the group consisting of fludioxonil and fenpiclonil.\n\nthe compositions may also contain two or more different antifungal compounds from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides. It is to be understood that derivatives of antifungal compounds from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides including, but not limited to, salts or solvates of antifungal compounds from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides or modified forms of antifungal compounds from the family of phenylpyrrole fungicides may also be applied in the compositions of the invention.\n\nExamples of commercial products containing phenylpyrrole fungicides such as fludioxonil are products with the brand names MaximÂ®, CelestÂ® and SwitchÂ®.\n\nExamples of commercial products containing phenylpyrrole fungicides such as fenpiclonil are products with the brand names BeretÂ®, GalbasÂ® and GambitÂ®. Said commercial products can be incorporated in the present invention.\n\nthe polyene antifungal compound is selected from the group consisting of natamycin, nystatin, amphotericin B, trienin, etruscomycin, filipin, chainin, dermostatin, lymphosarcin, candicidin, aureofungin A, aureofungin B, hamycin A, hamycin B and lucensomycin.\n\nthe polyene antifungal compound is natamycin.\n\nthe compositions may also contain two or more different polyene antifungal compounds.\n\nderivatives of polyene antifungal compounds including, but not limited to, salts or solvates of polyene antifungal compounds or modified forms of polyene antifungal compounds may also be applied in the compositions of the invention.\n\nexamples of commercial products containing natamycin are the products with the brand name DelvocidÂ®. Such products are produced by DSM Food Specialties (The Netherlands) and may be solids containing e.g. 50% (w/w) natamycin or liquids comprising between e.g. 2-50% (w/v) natamycin.

The treated strawberries were incubated in a closed box in the dark at 20Â°C for 19 days.\n\nmould growth on the strawberries was assessed in a twofold manner: (i) the number of moulded strawberries per total of 12 strawberries was counted; and (ii) the antifungal activity (in %) of the individual and combined active ingredients was determined by calculating the reduction in mould growth observed on the strawberries treated with the antifungal composition in comparison to the mould growth on the strawberries treated with the control composition.\n\nthe expected antifungal activity (E in %) of the combined antifungal composition comprising both active ingredients was calculated according to the Colby equation (Colby, 1967):\n\nthe observed antifungal activity exceeded the expected antifungal activity with approximately 9 to > 60% between 7 and 19 days of incubation. Consequently, the synergy factor was always > 1 .0 and increased from 1 .1 on day 7 to even 12 on days 18 and 19 (see Table 2).\n\nExample 5 The experiment was conducted as described in Example 5, except for the fact that each wounded and inoculated strawberry was dipped individually for 1 minute in a freshly prepared aqueous antifungal composition comprising either 250 ppm natamycin (DSM Food Specialties, Delft, The Netherlands), 250 ppm fludioxonil or both.

These pineapples were selected based on uniformity in color and size. Furthermore, they were free from visual mold growth or any other visual damage caused by plagues or diseases.\n\nthe surface of the pineapples was first disinfected by immersion of the fruits for one minute in a solution comprising 150 ppm sodium hypochlorite. Next, the fruits were dried and thereafter the antimicrobial compositions were applied on the fruits using a modified watering can. This shower, to simulate the wax cascade used in pineapple packing plants, covered the rind of the fruits with a thin film of wax. The crown of the pineapple was not treated. The following antimicrobial compositions were applied on the fruits:\n\nComposition A aqueous composition comprising 20% v/v wax (STA FRESH 2952);\n\nComposition B aqueous composition comprising 200 ppm of natamycin (DSM Food Specialties, Delft, The Netherlands) and 20% v/v wax (STA FRESH 2952);\n\nComposition C aqueous composition comprising 250 ppm of fludioxonil and 20% v/v wax (STA FRESH 2952);\n\nComposition D aqueous composition comprising 200 ppm of natamycin, 250 ppm of fludioxonil and 20% v/v wax (STA FRESH 2952).\n\nthe experiment was done in forty fold (5 boxes per composition, each box comprising 8 pineapples). All compositions had a pH of 7.2. In addition, the respective compositions were sprayed onto the peduncle (the wound) of each of the treated fruits at a rate of 1 ml per fruit. After application of the compositions, the pineapples were dried.\n\nthe pineapples were stored in a cold chamber at a temperature of 7.5Â°C for 21 days. After 21 days, the temperature was raised to 18 to 20Â°C to simulate shelf-life in a supermarket. The pineapples were stored for another 7 days at 18 to 20Â°C. Thus, the total storage time was 28 days.\n\ncompositions B, C and D The antifungal activity of compositions B, C and D was determined by calculating the reduction in mould incidence observed on the pineapple rind compared to composition A.\n\nthe observed antifungal activity of composition D was compared to the expected antifungal activity of composition D according to the Colby method (Colby, 1967) as described in Example 5.\n\nnatamycin and fludioxonil synergistically reduces mould growth on pineapples.\n\nTable 1 Number of moulded strawberries incubated at 20Â°C after treatment with compositions comprising either 500 ppm natamycin, 500 ppm fludioxonil or both.\n\ncompositions comprising either 500 ppm natamycin, 500 ppm fludioxonil or both on strawberries after incubation at 20Â°C.\n\nTable 3 Number of moulded strawberries incubated at 20Â°C after treatment with compositions comprising either 250 ppm natamycin, 250 ppm fludioxonil or both.\n\nTable 5 Number of moulded oranges incubated at 20Â°C after treatment with compositions comprising either 500 ppm natamycin, 300 ppm fludioxonil or both.\n\ncompositions comprising either 500 ppm natamycin, 300 ppm fludioxonil or both on oranges after incubation at 20Â°C.\n\nTable 7 Number of moulded oranges incubated at 20Â°C after treatment with compositions comprising either 250 ppm natamycin, 100 ppm fludioxonil or both.\n\nTable 9 Number of moulded oranges incubated at 20Â°C after treatment with compositions comprising either 500 ppm natamycin, 400 ppm fenpiclonil or both.\n\nAntifungal composition Number of moulded oranges / total number of 8 oranges during incubation time (in days)\n\nTable 1 1 Antifungal activity (%) of compositions comprising either 400 ppm natamycin, 600 ppm fenpiclonil or both on sweet peepers after incubation at 20Â°C.\n\ncompositions comprising either 200 ppm natamycin, 250 ppm fludioxonil or both on pineapples after 28 days of storage (21 days at 7.5Â°C and subsequently 7 days at 18 to 20Â°C).\n\nLandscapes\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nAgronomy & Crop Science (AREA)\n\nPest Control & Pesticides (AREA)\n\nPlant Pathology (AREA)\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nDentistry (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nWood Science & Technology (AREA)\n\nZoology (AREA)\n\nEnvironmental Sciences (AREA)\n\nAgricultural Chemicals And Associated Chemicals (AREA)\n\nPharmaceuticals Containing Other Organic And Inorganic Compounds (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nLa prÃ©sente invention concerne des compositions antifongiques inÃ©dites et leur utilisation dans le cadre du traitement de produits agricoles.\n\nEP14700591.2A 2013-01-14 2014-01-13 Nouvelles compositions antifungals Active EP2943068B1 (fr)\n\nPriority Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP14700591.2A EP2943068B1 (fr) 2013-01-14 2014-01-13 Nouvelles compositions antifungals\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (4)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP13151116 2013-01-14 EP13165085 2013-04-24 PCT/EP2014/050443 WO2014108527A1 (fr) 2013-01-14 2014-01-13 Compositions antifongiques inÃ©dites EP14700591.2A EP2943068B1 (fr) 2013-01-14 2014-01-13 Nouvelles compositions antifungals\n\nPublications (2)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date EP2943068A1 true EP2943068A1 (fr) 2015-11-18 EP2943068B1 EP2943068B1 (fr) 2017-07-12\n\nFamily\n\nID=49989698\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date EP14700591.2A Active EP2943068B1 (fr) 2013-01-14 2014-01-13 Nouvelles compositions antifungals\n\nCountry Status (8)\n\nCountry Link US (1) US9468212B2 (fr) EP (1) EP2943068B1 (fr) CN (1) CN104936452B (fr) CR (1) CR20150352A (fr) ES (1) ES2637778T3 (fr) MX (1) MX360885B (fr) WO (1) WO2014108527A1 (fr) ZA (1) ZA201504931B (fr)\n\nFamilies Citing this family (1)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title US20150157021A1 (en) * 2012-05-01 2015-06-11 Dsm Ip Assets B.V.
