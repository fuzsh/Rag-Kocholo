        "text": "A new monotypic coelomycetous genus, Loculosulcatispora (type species L. thailandica) is introduced in Pleosporales from woody litter in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of combined non-translated loci (SSU, LSU, ITS) and protein-coding regions (tef1-α, rpb2) shows the genus is a distinct lineage in Sulcatisporaceae. Loculosulcatispora is distinguished from other genera in the family, by having 1-celled, oblong, hyaline, smooth-walled conidia with guttules. Comprehensive morphological descriptions and illustrations are provided for the new genus and species.\n\nThe website http://outlineoffungi.org, is launched to provide a continuous up-to-date classification of the kingdom Fungi (including fossil fungi) and fungus-like taxa. This is based on recent publications and on the outline of fungi and fungus-like taxa published recently (Mycosphere 11, 1060-1456, doi 10.5943/mycosphere/11/1/8). The website is continuously updated according to latest classification schemes, and will present an important platform for researchers, industries, government officials and other users. Users can provide input about missing genera, new genera, and new data. They will also have the opportunity to express their opinions on classifications with notes published in the ‘Notes’ section of the webpage following review and editing by the curators and independent experts. The website will provide a system to stay abreast of the continuous changes in fungal classification and provide a general consensus on the systematics of fungi. © 2020, Guizhou Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biotechnology.\n\nRoussoella guttulata sp. nov. (Roussoellaceae) was found on bamboo culms collected in the northeast of Thailand. Roussoella guttulata differs from other species in having immersed, gregarious, black pseudoascostromata, single and central ostiole with periphyses, thin-walled peridium composed of cells of textura angularis to textura prismatica and yellowish brown ascospores. The multigene phylogenetic analysis shows that the new species forms a distinct lineage basal to R. hysterioides, R. japanensis, R. scabrispora and R. verrucispora. The new species is compared with closely related Roussoella species. A full description, color photo plates and a phylogenetic tree to show the placement of the new species are provided.

The taxon was discovered with its sexual and asexual specimens on Camponotus japonicus (Formicidae) under the bark of humid and decayed wood of Picea schrenkiana. With irregularly distorted stromata and distributed in the cold and high-altitude Tianshan Mountains, the species can be separated from other extant Ophiocordyceps species. Morphological and multigene phylogenetic analyses support its novelty. We provide additional ecological data on this cordyceps species from northwestern China. © 2020 Magnolia Press\n\nPhosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF) play an important role in increasing the bioavailability of phosphorus in soils for plants. Thirteen fungal strains, one collected from air and 12 from soil, were screened and described here in detail. These fungal strains were tested for their ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate (TCP) on both solid and liquid Pikovskaya (PVK) media in vitro. The airborne fungal strain KUMCC 18-0196 (Aspergillus hydei sp. nov.) showed the most significant phosphate solubilizing activity on a solid PVK medium with the solubilization index (SI) (2.58 ± 0.04 cm) and the highest solubilized phosphates (1523.33 ± 47.87 μg/mL) on a liquid PVK medium. To the best of our knowledge, A. hydei sp. nov. is the first phosphate-solubilizing fungus reported from air. We also provide the identification especially for Aspergillus, Penicillium and Talaromyces, generally reported as PSF. It is important to not only screen for PSF but also identify species properly so that researchers have a clearer taxonomic picture for identifying potential taxa for future plant growth-promoting applications. Herein, A. hydei (section Nigri), Gongronella hydei, Penicillium soli (section Lanata-Divaricata) and Talaromyces yunnanensis (section Talaromyces) are fully described and introduced as new to science. These four new species are identified based on both morphological characteristics and multigene phylogenetic analyses, including the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition method where necessary. Penicillium austrosinense is considered to be a synonym of P. guaibinense. © Copyright © 2020 Doilom, Guo, Phookamsak, Mortimer, Karunarathna, Dong, Liao, Yan, Pem, Suwannarach, Promputtha, Lumyong and Xu.\n\nThis is the twelfth contribution to the Fungal Diversity Notes series on fungal taxonomy, based on materials collected from many countries which were examined and described using the methods of morphology, anatomy, and strain culture, combined with DNA sequence analyses. 110 taxa are described and illustrated, including five new genera, 92 new species, eight new combinations and other taxonomic contributions (one new sequenced species, one new host and three new records) which are accommodated in 40 families and 1 incertae sedis in Dothideomycetes.

Both morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and nrLSU regions showed that the bioluminescent fungus belongs to the genus Roridomyces and is a new species to science, as well as the first report of the genus, Roridomyces, in India. Full descriptions, colour photographs, phylogenetic trees to show the position of the novel bioluminescent taxon, and comparisons with its morphologically and phylogenetically similar species are provided. © 2020 Magnolia Press\n\nIn this paper, we described and illustrated a new species of lignicolous fungi, Distoseptispora hydei, found on decaying bamboo in Phitsanulok Province, Thailand. According to the phylogenetic results from combined sequence data (LSU, ITS and RPB2), the new species is distinct from other Distoseptispora species. Distoseptispora hydei is characterized by obpyriform to fusiform conidia with 7-9 distosepta and a hyaline, gelatinous sheath around the tip. Phylogenetic analyses and morphological comparisons with other species of Distoseptispora are provided in this study. © 2020 Magnolia Press\n\nThe class Dothideomycetes is the largest and most ecologically diverse class of fungi, comprising endophytes, epiphytes, saprobes, human and plant pathogens, lichens, and lichenicolous, nematode trapping and rock-inhabiting taxa. Members of this class are mainly characterized by bitunicate asci with fissitunicate dehiscence, and occur on broad range of hosts in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Since the last monograph of families of Dothideomycetes in 2013, numerous novel species, genera, families and orders have been discovered. This has expanded information which has led to the modern classification in Dothideomycetes. In this paper, we provide a refined updated document on families of Dothideomycetes with emphasis on Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae. We accept three orders with 25 families and four orders with 94 families in Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae, respectively. The new family Paralophiostomataceae is introduced in Pleosporales. Each family is provided with an updated description, notes, including figures to represent the morphology, list of accepted genera, and economic and ecological significances. We also provide an overall phylogenetic tree of families in Dothideomycetes based on combined analysis of LSU, SSU, rpb-2 and tef1 sequence data, and phylogenetic trees for each order in Dothideomycetidae and Pleosporomycetidae. Family-level trees are provided for the families which include several genera such as Mycosphaerellaceae and Teratosphaeriaceae. Two new genera (Ligninsphaeriopsis and Paralophiostoma) are introduced. Five new species (Biatrisopora borsei, Comoclathris galatellae, Ligninsphaeriopsis thailandica, Paralophiostoma hysterioides and Torula thailandica) are introduced based on morphology and phylogeny, together with nine new reports and seven new collections from different families. © 2020, Guizhou Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biotechnology.\n\nThis paper reviews and determines the fungi growing on seeds and fruits of wild plants in various habitats. Such fungi colonise a wide range of substrates with most reported from cones, cupules, and leguminous pods that are high in cellulose and lignin content. There are 1348 fungal species (belonging to 230 families and 609 genera) reported from wild seeds and fruits in 84 countries, listed in this paper. Of these, 300 fungi were described from wild seeds and fruit substrates. Members of the Fabaceae support the highest number of taxa, namely 19% of the novel wild fruit fungi. Twenty-eight genera, including 5 fossil fungal genera have been described from wild seeds and fruits: Agarwalomyces, Amorocoelophoma, Anisogenispora, Archephoma, Centrolepidosporium, Cylindroaseptospora, Cylindromyces, Davidhawksworthia, Delonicicola, Discotubeufia, Glaxoa, Kionocephala, Leucaenicola, Naranus, Neolindgomyces, Pleohelicoon, Quercicola, Remotididymella, Repetoblastiella, Restilago, Soloacrosporiella, Strobiloscypha and Tainosphaeria. Archephoma, Meniscoideisporites, Palaeodiplodites, Palaeopericonia and Xylohyphites are the new fossil fungal genera. Fungal asexual morphs predominate on wild seeds and fruits rather than the sexual morphs. The dominant fungal genera on wild seeds and fruits include Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Diaporthe, Drechslera, Fusarium, Mucor, Penicillium, Pestalotiopsis, Restiosporium, Rhizopus, Talaromyces, Trichoderma and Xylaria. Certain assemblages of fungi have specific and distinct relationships with their hosts, especially Xylaria species (e.g., Xylaria magnoliae on Magnolia fruits; X. xanthinovelutina (= X. ianthino-velutina) on Fabaceae pods; X. carpophila on Fagus cupules; X. persicaria on liquidambar fruits). Whether these species occur as endophytes and become saprobes following fruit fall requires further investigation. In this study, we also made several sexual morph collections of sordariomycetous taxa from different seed and fruit substrates mainly from Thailand, with a few from the UK. These include 15 new species, 13 new host records and 1 new geographical record. The new species are described and illustrated. © 2020, Guizhou Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biotechnology."
