        "text": "In the past two decades, the taxonomy and systematics of tropical lichens have received increased attention. Tropical lichen biotas are dominated by crustose microlichens, particularly Arthoniaceae, Caliciaceae, Graphidaceae, Lecanoraceae, Malmideaceae, Opegraphaceae, Pertusariaceae, Porinaceae, Pyrenulaceae, Ramalinaceae, Roccellaceae, and Trypetheliaceae (Cáceres Reference Cáceres2007; Rivas Plata et al. Reference Rivas Plata, Lücking and Lumbsch2008; Lücking et al. Reference Lücking, Rivas-Plata, Chavez, Umaña and Sipman2009). Whereas Graphidaceae, by far the largest family, are by now relatively well-known (Staiger Reference Staiger2002; Frisch et al. Reference Frisch, Kalb and Grube2006; Rivas Plata et al. Reference Rivas Plata, Lücking and Lumbsch2012) and identification tools exist for families such as Malmideaceae and Pyrenulaceae (Aptroot Reference Aptroot2012; Breuss & Lücking Reference Breuss and Lücking2015), most have no comprehensive treatments available.\n\nHere, we present a first attempt at a global revision of Trypetheliaceae, the second most important component in tropical regions after Graphidaceae. In analogy to the latter, generic concepts in Trypetheliaceae were long based on ascoma organisation and ascospore septation, resulting in artificial entities. Molecular phylogenetic studies contributed to a more natural generic concept, with surprising results and dramatic changes. While the number of genera now recognized remained almost unchanged, the inclusion of species previously classified in Arthopyrenia and Mycomicrothelia in the family and the fusion of Astrothelium, Campylothelium, Cryptothelium, and the bulk of species previously classified in Trypethelium, into what is now recognized as a single, megadiverse genus Astrothelium, is in stark contrast with the previous classification and delimitation of Trypetheliaceae.\n\nGlobalization has long entered the scientific world and the combination of different expertise with broad geographic coverage makes it possible to cover a taxon from every possible angle, bringing together traditional taxonomy, type studies, and nomenclature, with molecular phylogenetics and other quantitative tools. The core of this work is based on long ongoing taxonomic revisions of pyrenocarpous groups by the first author, a comprehensive molecular phylogeny enthusiatically assembled by M.P. Nelsen as part of his PhD thesis work at the University of Chicago and The Field Museum, and ongoing inventories of tropical crustose microlichens spearheaded by both authors and H.J.M. Sipman, who placed numerous specimens at our disposal. Access to biodiversity in tropical areas, facilitated through international collaborations, has been crucial and also resulted in the training of local students and professionals (Fig. 1). Another important component is the ongoing digitization of herbarium specimens, in particular types, through projects such the Global Plants Initiative [http://gpi.myspecies.info; https://plants.jstor.org], which made it possible to track down even some of the most obscure names and elucidate their status. Last but not least, the outstanding editorial team of The Lichenologist helped to assemble this collaborative treatment into a special issue."
