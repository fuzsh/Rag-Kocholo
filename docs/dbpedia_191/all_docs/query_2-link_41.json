This phenylamide was introduced in 1977 by Ciba-Geigy. Further phenylamide fungicides were introduced over the next two decades. They brought a completely new level of control to the Oomycetes through their systemic properties.\n\nPhenylamide fungicides however have not been immune to challenges in their development and maintenance. A large concern has been resistance development, Resistance to phenylamide fungicides has been observed on several diseases now (see Goodwin et al., 1996; Albourie et al., 1998; Diriwaechter et al., 1987).\n\nthe polyene macrolide antimycotic natamycin has been used to prevent fungal growth on food products such as cheeses and sausages.\n\nThis natural preservative which is produced by fermentation using Streptomyces natalensis, is widely used throughout the world as a food preservative and has a long history of safe use in the food industry. It is very effective against all known food spoilage fungi.\n\nnatamycin has been applied for many years in e.g. the cheese industry, up to now development of resistant fungal species has never been observed.\n\nantimicrobial compositions e.g. antifungal compositions\n\nantifungal compositions for the treatment of fungal growth in and on plants and crops.\n\nthe present invention solves the problem by providing a new synergistic antimicrobial, e.g. antifungal, composition comprising a polyene antifungal compound and at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylamide fungicides.\n\na new synergistic antimicrobial e.g. antifungal\n\ncomposition comprising a polyene antifungal compound and at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylamide fungicides.\n\nthe term \"synergisticâ means that the combined effect of the antifungal compounds when used in combination is greater than their additive effects when used individually.\n\nsynergistic activity of two active ingredients can be tested in for example the analysis of variance model using the treatment interaction stratum (see Slinker, 1998).\n\nRelative efficacy can be calculated by means of the following formula: ((value of evolution status of untreated control - value of evolution status of composition) / (value of evolution status of untreated control)) * 100.\n\nAn interaction coefficient can then be calculated by means of the following formula: ((relative efficacy of combination compound A + compound B) / (relative efficacy of compound A + relative efficacy of compound B)) * 100.\n\nAn interaction coefficient larger than 100 indicates synergy between the compounds.\n\nsynergy can be calculated as follows: the antifungal activity (in %) of the individual active ingredients can be determined by calculating the reduction in mould growth observed on products treated with the active ingredients in comparison to the mould growth on products treated with a control composition.\n\nphenylamide fungicides includes acylalanine fungicides, oxazolidinone fungicides and butyrolactone fungicides.\n\nthe at least one antifungal compound from the family of phenylamide fungicides is selected from the group consisting of benalaxyl, benalaxyl-M (also called kiralaxyl), furalaxyl, metalaxyl, and metalaxyl-M (also called mefenoxam), ofurace and oxadixyl.\n\ncompositions may also contain two or more different antifungal compounds from the family of phenylamide fungicides.

After incubation for 2 hours at 20Â°C, the mandarins are dipped individually for 1 minute in a freshly prepared aqueous antifungal composition comprising either natamycin (DSM Food Specialties, Delft, The Netherlands), benalaxyl or both.\n\nDSM Food Specialties, Delft, The Netherlands benalaxyl\n\nphenylamide fungicides benalaxyl-M, fluralaxyl, metalaxyl, metalaxyl-M, ofurace, and oxadixyl alone or in combination with natamycin are tested.\n\nthe antifungal compositions comprise 3.1% (w/w) beeswax, 0.76% (w/w) glycerol, 0.66% (w/w) polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), 0.03% (w/w) methylhydroxyethylcellulose (MHEC), 0.02% (w/w) xanthan gum, 0.02% (w/w) anti-foaming agent, 0.15% (w/w) citric acid and 0.01% (w/w) potassium sorbate.\n\nthe pH of the composition is 4.0.\n\na composition without natamycin or a phenylamide fungicide is used as control.\n\nthe treated mandarins are incubated in a closed box in the dark at 20Â°C and assessed on mould growth after 25, 28, 31 and 34 days of incubation.\n\nthe antifungal activity (in %) of the individual and combined active ingredients is determined by calculating the reduction in mould growth observed on the mandarins treated with the antifungal composition in comparison to the mould growth on the mandarins treated with the control composition according to the Colby method (Colby, 1967) described in Example 1 and 2.\n\nthe antifungal composition comprising natamycin and a phenylamide fungicide is superior to the compositions comprising natamycin or a phenylamide fungicide alone in preventing mould growth on mandarins.\n\nnatamycin and a phenylamide fungicide synergistically reduces mould growth on mandarins.\n\nthe active ingredient(s) are added from separate stock solutions prepared in PCB medium or methanol, which resulted in an intermediate volume of 100 â l per well.\n\n100 â l of a Botrytis cinerea suspension prepared in PCB medium is used to inoculate each well with 2.5 x 10 3 spores/ml.\n\nEach well thus contains a final volume of 200 â l and â 1% of methanol, which does not affect growth of Botrytis cinerea (data not shown).\n\nthe in vitro antifungal activity (%) of the individual active ingredients is assessed by calculating the reduction in mould growth observed in the presence of the active ingredient in comparison to the mould growth observed in the absence of the active ingredient.\n\nnatamycin and a phenylamide fungicide synergistically inhibits growth of Botrytis cinerea.\n\nLandscapes\n\nLife Sciences & Earth Sciences (AREA)\n\nAgronomy & Crop Science (AREA)\n\nPest Control & Pesticides (AREA)\n\nPlant Pathology (AREA)\n\nHealth & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nDentistry (AREA)\n\nGeneral Health & Medical Sciences (AREA)\n\nWood Science & Technology (AREA)\n\nZoology (AREA)\n\nEnvironmental Sciences (AREA)\n\nAgricultural Chemicals And Associated Chemicals (AREA)\n\nEP12166259.7A 2012-05-01 2012-05-01 Antifungal compositions Withdrawn EP2659775A1 (en)\n\nPriority Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP12166259.7A EP2659775A1 (en) 2012-05-01 2012-05-01 Antifungal compositions\n\nApplications Claiming Priority (1)\n\nApplication Number Priority Date Filing Date Title EP12166259.7A EP2659775A1 (en) 2012-05-01 2012-05-01 Antifungal compositions\n\nPublications (1)\n\nPublication Number Publication Date EP2659775A1 true EP2659775A1 (en) 2013-11-06\n\nFamily\n\nID=46045927\n\nFamily Applications (1)\n\nApplication Number Title Priority Date Filing Date EP12166259.7A Withdrawn EP2659775A1 (en) 2012-05-01 2012-05-01 Antifungal compositions\n\nCountry Status (1)\n\nCountry Link EP (1) EP2659775A1 (zh)\n\nCited By (2)\n\n* Cited by examiner, â Cited by third party Publication number Priority date Publication date Assignee Title WO2015124330A1 (en) * 2014-02-21 2015-08-27 Basf Se Aqueous agroformulation comprising suspended pesticide, cellulose ether and thickener WO2019011630A1 (en) 2017-07-10 2019-01-17 Dsm Ip Assets B.V.
