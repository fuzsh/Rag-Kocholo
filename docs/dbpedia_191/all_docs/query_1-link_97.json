        "text": "Intent and Purpose\n\nBe yourself; Everyone else is already taken.\n\n‚Äî Oscar Wilde.\n\nI am a high function ASD person in the late 60‚Äôs. I am a data scientist, artificial intelligence engineer, former high school science teacher etc. Needless to say, the term autism or ASD was unknown while I was growing up. The classic delay in speech (I did not start talking until I was almost 9 y.o.) and other characteristics were ascribed to some form of brain damage. Three causes were speculated: forceps delivery, German Measles at 18 months and the medication that my mother was give to keep from miscarrying (she had 6 miscarriages before me).\n\nToday, I know that I was high risk because my father was 44 when I was born (Parental Age at Conception and the Relationship with Severity of Autism Symptoms. 2019). My childhood was not fun, because I understood enough about my situation that I was in terror for most of it. The terror caused me to work hard and I found success in a very non-social activity: mathematics and mathematics competitions. I placed in the top 3 repeatedly in both my Province and in Canadian Mathematics Competitions. That‚Äôs enough of my story.\n\nPurpose of this Blog\n\nOver the last few years I have became focused (the typical uber focus of an ASD person) on the microbiome to deal with family health issues. My primary focus has been on myalgic encephalomyelitis on which I have written some 1300 posts here. Out of that, I developed an analysis site using reference site and citizen science site called Microbiome Prescription. I have also became active in a Facebook group The Gut Club: Stool Test Discussion Group. This group had resulted in contact with many mothers with autistic children. Needless to say, I have both empathy for the mother and for the children (been there myself before there was support!).\n\nThis site is very open to guest posts. I do request that they be well researched with links to source studies. I hate to be ‚Äòanti-social‚Äô and ignoring chat-board opinions and consensus ‚Äî but what do you expect from someone with ASD? üòâ\n\nAs interesting notes comes across my desktop, I will explore and attempt to write up posts on what we know today.\n\nI will start this blog by copying across some blog posts that I have done on Autism elsewhere.\n\nSuggested watching and subscribing to: https://www.youtube.com/c/AutismResearchCoalition\n\nTwo Supplements of Note for Autism\n\nI am doing a normalization and update of data on Microbiome Prescription. There are many items to review and items that have been reviewed have { } in their name. The pattern is:\n\nScientific Name\n\n{Common Name}\n\nOther Information\n\nand not reviewed (YET)\n\nSo far in this review, I have come across two substances (more likely to come) where there has been many or interesting studies for Autism\n\nSulforaphane\n\nThis is found in broccoli sprouts,cauliflower, kale, cole crops, cabbage, collards, mustard, and cress\n\nSulforaphane Treatment in Children with Autism: A Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Study.\n\nTherapeutic efficacy of sulforaphane in autism spectrum disorders and its association with gut microbiota: animal model and human longitudinal studies\n\nCurrent understanding and future directions of cruciferous vegetables and their phytochemicals to combat neurological diseases.\n\nExploring sulforaphane as neurotherapeutic: targeting Nrf2-Keap & Nf-Kb pathway crosstalk in ASD.\n\nA Review on Autism Spectrum Disorder: Pathogenesis, Biomarkers, Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Interventions.\n\nEmerging drugs for the treatment of irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nZinc\n\nDietary zinc supplementation rescues fear-based learning and synaptic function in the Tbr1(+/-) mouse model of autism spectrum disorders.\n\nPotential importance of supplementation with zinc for autism spectrum disorder.\n\nThe Assessment of Selenium, Aluminum, and Zinc in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nDifferential effectiveness of dietary zinc supplementation with autism-related behaviours in Shank2 knockout mice.\n\nZinc Water Prevents Autism-Like Behaviors in the BTBR Mice.\n\nxploring potential mechanisms for zinc deficiency to impact in autism spectrum disorder: a narrative review.\n\nZinc deficiency and supplementation in autism spectrum disorder and Phelan-McDermid syndrome.\n\nZinc Status and Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review.\n\nThe association of vitamin A, zinc and copper levels with clinical symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorders in Jilin Province, China.\n\nNeurodevelopmental Consequences of Dietary Zinc Deficiency: A Status Report.\n\nThe Role of Zinc and NMDA Receptors in Autism Spectrum Disorders.\n\nZinc is a key regulator of gastrointestinal development, microbiota composition and inflammation with relevance for autism spectrum disorders.\n\nImpact of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles on the Composition of Gut Microbiota in Healthy and Autism Spectrum Disorder Children.\n\nThe role of zinc supplementation on the metallothionein system in children with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nIn vitro zinc supplementation alters synaptic deficits caused by autism spectrum disorder-associated Shank2 point mutations in hippocampal neurons.\n\nDietary Zinc Supplementation Prevents Autism Related Behaviors and Striatal Synaptic Dysfunction in Shank3 Exon 13-16 Mutant Mice.\n\nand more studies‚Ä¶\n\nGlyphosate\n\nStudies from US National Library of Medicine\n\n‚ÄúFurthermore, it has been reported that most infant formulas are contaminated with glyphosate. One study reported levels between 0.03 mg kg‚àí1 and 1.08 mg kg‚àí1. This could potentially further exacerbate the problem of Bifidobacterium reduction in the infant gut.‚Äù This may be a factor for increasing Autism and ADHD rates.\n\nImpact of glyphosate (RoundupTM) on the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome\n\nIs autism a PIN1 deficiency syndrome?

The draft feature used brain trauma as a test case. This caused me to think of Autism.\n\nThe draft report is designed to be a document to be used by Medical Doctors and to educate them on the latest studies.\n\nAll data contributed will be freely available for personal use on Microbiome Prescription, in keeping with its open data policy.\n\nCurrent Studies for Brain Trauma\n\nCurrent Studies for Autism\n\nExample Report\n\nExample for a (real) person with Autism, OCD and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\n\nBacteria Identification\n\nThe person‚Äôs sample is examined and compared to the literature\n\nValidated Suggestions\n\nThere are suggestions that the literature reports that some people in studies improved taking.\n\nNot Validated Suggestions\n\nThese are items that will improved the microbiome but do not have any studies for them being tested with brain trauma / Autism. Conceptually, some researchers should conduct trials with them.\n\nHow Can You Help\n\nWe need to get a comprehensive list of items that help autism. This means YOU DOING RESEARCH, FILL OUT A SPREADSHEET and then send to me Ken@lassesen\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nExcel Spread Sheet below:\n\nBest Lab for Autism Microbiome?\n\nUsing the five methods described in Technical Note: The Four Winds of Microbiome Analysis, I ran these method on all of the data on the citizen science site of Microbiome Prescription testing for all symptoms that have been self-reported from users of Ombre Labs and Biomesight retail microbiome tests. The data from each lab was done is insolation (you cannot mix data from different processions flows, see The taxonomy nightmare before Christmas‚Ä¶ for how the results from the same FASTQ files are reported by 4 different processing flows).\n\nMy criteria for deeming a genus significant was:\n\nAt least one method reported P < 0.01\n\nAt least two methods reported P < 0.05\n\nThe 2 @ P < 0.05 is a bit of shooting from the hip; I expect some correlation between methods but not sufficient to have that adjusted P value to be outside of the range 0.0025 and 0.01. Looking at the statistics on significant genus, we found the 2 @ P < 0.05 produce only a small contributions,\n\nSee Citizen Science Symptoms To Genus Special Studies\n\nWhen I looked at associations for autism, I noticed a striking contrast between the two most common labs.\n\nThere are two possible causes:\n\nLess annotated samples on Biomesight uploads\n\nThe algorithm being used on Biomesight is a poor match for the RNA used in 16s that are associated with autism (and other neurocognitive issues).\n\nLooking at some other neurocognitive issues, we see the same pattern ‚Äî Ombre identifies more significant genus.\n\nHow to Fix This Issue\n\nThe first issue may disappear if all biomesight samples with autism are annotated. HINT HINT\n\nThe second issue would be addressed by having the 16s FastQ files processed by OmbreLabs (At one time they offered that for free).\n\nExample of Using\n\nIn the sample below, we see for Bifidobacterium that average amount is 2.6 x of the values of people without this symptom. The percentile rankings are 36% higher, and this genus is seen 3% more often.\n\nPending Work\n\nIntegrating this data with the algorithms on Microbiome Prescription to generate suggestions to reduce these shifts.\n\nAlso see Technical Note: Yield of Applying Different Statistical Methods for more information\n\nTool for getting suggestions for your specific Autism Symptoms\n\nAfter I posted List of Bacteria significant for ME/CFS from the shared samples uploaded to Microbiome Prescription, several readers asked ‚ÄúHow do I use this‚Äù. This person has a child with autism. This took me a few days to come up with, code and implement an answer.\n\nI wanted this to go beyond just one condition because there is a huge variety of symptoms and co-morbidity seen with different conditions. After testing and tuning the algorithm, I am pleased with the current results.\n\nThe process is show below.\n\nThe Steps\n\nReturn to ‚ÄúMy Profile‚Äù\n\nA new button will appear\n\nClicking it will move to the page below. YOU MAY FIND THAT IT TAKES UP TO A MINUTE (We are doing a massive number of computation)\n\nThis will show a tree of the bacteria involved. The Species are under the genus they below to. In the example below we see the ENTIRE phylum that Bifidobacterium is in are low (none found) of 9 species whose presence would likely reduce your symptoms.\n\nElsewhere you may see highs with certain bacteria species desired to higher. Often the symptom key is at the species level.\n\nAt the bottom you will see a button to get suggestions\n\nThe next page shows the symptoms being targeted to and choices of what you want to consider.\n\nMake any changes desired and click show suggestions\n\nREMEMBER these are suggestions for ONE person using their Symptoms and their microbiome profile. It is intended for them only. Your own suggestions may be very different with many items exchanged between ADD and REMOVE.\n\nTechnical Methodology Details are described here Technical Note: Prevalence, Average and Not Reported.\n\nPost-Script\n\nThis approach sidestep the proforma process often drilled into researchers (you must have a health control group and a verified, criteria matching target population) and keeps to rigorous statistical analysis while ignoring these constraints which are philosophical in nature. We used the available data and set our significance level to P < 0.005; instead of the typical research level of P < 0.05. In other words, we are 10 times more certain about our results.\n\nAutism and Fungi\n\nThis is intended to be used with reports from Thorne or Xenogene. A shotgun microbiome report is needed that reports Fungi. Most microbiome do not report fungi in detail.\n\nMost microbiome reports use 16s technology that do not report on fungi. Fungi produces mycotoxins\n\nCase Study: Rapid Complete Recovery From An Autism Spectrum Disorder After Treatment of Aspergillus With The Antifungal Drugs Itraconazole And Sporanox [2020]\n\nCould Candida Overgrowth Be Involved in the Pathophysiology of Autism? [2022]\n\nDysbiotic microbiota in autistic children and their mothers: persistence of fungal and bacterial wall-deficient L-form variants in blood [2019]\n\nRole of mycotoxins in the pathobiology of autism: A first evidence [2017]\n\nMycotoxin Exposure and Autism: A Systematic Review of the Molecular Mechanism [2021]\n\nEffects of Mycotoxins on Neuropsychiatric Symptoms and Immune Processes [2018]\n\nNew evidences on the altered gut microbiota in autism spectrum disorders [2017]\n\n‚ÄúWe also observed that the relative abundance of the fungal genus Candida was more than double in the autistic than neurotypical subjects,‚Äù\n\nSee also: CDC provides a list of known fungal diseases: Types of Fungal Diseases.\n\nFungi are listed from lowest taxonomy level upwards.\n\nFungi: Agaricales / Agaricomycetes ‚Äì Eating button and baby bella before the test may result in a false high.\n\nFungi: Aspergillus / Aspergillaceae / Eurotiales\n\nFungi: Chaetomiaceae / Sordariales / Sordariomycetes\n\nFungi: Clavicipitaceae / Hypocreales / Sordariomycetes\n\nFungi: Debaryomycetaceae / Saccharomycetales / Saccharomycetes\n\nFungi: Exophiala / Herpotrichiellaceae / Chaetothyriales ‚Äì Loves Dishwashers!\n\nFungi: Leotiomycetes / Ascomycota\n\nFungi: Malassezia / Malasseziaceae / Malasseziales / Malasseziomycetes / Basidiomycota ‚Äì associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Crohn‚Äôs\n\nFungi: Nectriaceae Fusarium / Hypocreales / Sordariomycetes ‚Äì Loves garlic!\n\nFungi: Pleosporales / Dothideomycetes\n\nFungi: Saccharomycetaceae / Saccharomycetales / Saccharomycetes\n\nFungi: Synchytrium / Synchytriaceae / Synchytriales / Chytridiomycetes / Chytridiomycota\n\nFungi: Trichosporonaceae / Trichosporonales / Tremellomycetes / Basidiomycota\n\nCAUTION: Some test results may reflect foods (mushrooms) or supplements that you are consuming and could result in false high levels.\n\nAs a personal note, I am a high function autism; the first three years of my life I lived in an area known as ‚ÄúAsthma flats‚Äù and this early life exposure to high level of fungi may have been a factor for me.\n\nDiagram from World Health Organization fungal priority pathogens list to guide research, development and public health action\n\nPossible Medical Plants are covered in this article: A Review: Antifungal Potentials of Medicinal Plants [2015] . e.g. Garlic and other wonder herbs do not work on all fungi.\n\nSmoking Guns of the Autism Microbiome\n\nThis post presents solid evidence of items that are statistically significant based on 226 samples of people with Autism. The intent of this post is show the guns. Getting fingerprints and other ‚Äúwhy‚Äù detective work is not included. This is just the statistical facts‚Ä¶ painting a narrative is for others to do.\n\nWhat we know about Autism Microbiome and Related issues ‚Äì YouTube\n\nThe Excel File used above\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?\n\nSimple, develop a suggestion algorithm that is a superior match for this data than the default on Microbiome Prescription.\n\nBacteria Associated with Autism\n\nThe following bacteria association with Autism is P < 0.01 or more significant. This is using the current 218 contributed samples.\n\nWhen the Frequency seen is higher than Control, then there is too many. Additionally, the average amount seen in the list below is also higher than that seen in the Control. Same logic applies to those that are lower.\n\nThe probability of significance is using Chi2. A value of 6 is about P < 0.01, higher values are even more significant. As you will quickly note: Bifidobacterium for many species is too high.\n\nCoagulation and Autism\n\nI am a high functioning autistic person (which is a major factor in microbiome prescription being created ‚Äî some autism characteristics allowed me to be super focused and not bored creating it), I know part of my issues was low grade coagulation issues ‚Äî not usually deemed clinical significant usually. Coagulation impacts oxygen flow to the brain‚Ä¶ which impacts behaviors. Hypoxia (low oxygen ‚Äì i.e. from being at altitude without oxygen) have the following symptoms:\n\nEuphoria\n\nHeadache\n\nIncreased response time\n\nImpaired judgment\n\nDrowsiness\n\nConfusion or foggy decision making\n\nAnd also speed of acquiring learning.\n\nI did a little searching and found most of the items were very recent publications:\n\nA Systematic Investigation of Complement and Coagulation-Related Protein in Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Multiple Reaction Monitoring Technology [2023]\n\n‚ÄúThe complement and coagulation pathways may be activated in the peripheral blood of children with ASD and play a key role in the pathogenesis of ASD.‚Äù\n\nThe use of data independent acquisition based proteomic analysis and machine learning to reveal potential biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder [2023]\n\n‚Äú45 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified between the ASD group and the control group. They mainly were associated with platelet degranulation, ECM proteoglycar, complement and coagulation cascades, selenium micronutrient network, ‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n[Paired and partial correlations of immune parameters of neuro-immuno-test and coagulation parameters of thrombodynamics test in children with children‚Äôs autism] [2022]\n\n‚ÄúIt was shown that there is a statistically significant positive correlation (R=0.369, p=0.018) between the acquired immunity parameter: the level of serum antibodies to myelin basic protein (BMP): abBMP parameter, and the main parameter of platelet hemostasis ‚Äì the time of appearance of spontaneous clots (Tsp).‚Äù\n\nEvaluation of Platelet Parameters in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Elongated Collagen-Adenosine Diphosphate and Collagen-Epinephrine Closure Times [2019]\n\n‚ÄúMoreover, in terms of platelet functions, the elongation in collagen-ADP and collagen-EPI closure times were significantly higher for the ASD group (P = 0.044). These results may suggest an impairment in platelet functions rather than in platelet morphology for children with ASD. Considering these results, further investigation of thrombocyte functions in the ASD may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD‚Äù\n\n[Thrombodynamic parameters of hypercoagulation of blood in children with childhood autism and schizophrenia] [2019]\n\n‚ÄúIt was shown for the first time that clotting (hypercoagulability) of the blood plasma in patients with autism and childhood schizophrenia was increased. ‚Äú\n\n[Thrombodynamic correlates of catatonia severity in children with autism] [2019]\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nIf you can get piracetam ‚Äî it could be an experiment to try (800 mg with each meal for a few days). see https://cfsremission.com/2021/04/20/piracetam-for-me-cfs-long-haul-covid-brain-fog-2/ . It works extremely well for me (but your mileage may vary)\n\nFor more items, see my old post in a different context for Thick Blood Supplements easily available.\n\nRemember, systematic (one at a time) trials with (hopefully ) some way of objectively evaluating changes.\n\nOne possible way to evaluate, is to monitor Saturated O2 levels. There are [cheap] smart watches that will do that constantly.\n\nAn Autistic Child‚Äôs Microbiome\n\nAutism is a variety of conditions caused by DNA mutations, environmental influences and a host of other factors. A significant contributor can be the microbiome. This impact can be further amplified because many children with autism are picky eaters shifting the microbiome further. What is discussed in this post applies to this child and not autistic children in general.\n\nBack Story\n\nA son with autism. He had COVID in April 2021. With autism, it can be challenging to identify long COVID symptoms from autism symptoms. ‚ÄúWe have seen marginal improvements in his receptive language and command following. His social skills and emotional understanding is poor . His diet has largely remained the same , vegetables and chicken , lamb, beef or fish and spices. He is verbal but not conversational, does not sleep well at night, does stimming throughout the day, his understanding is minimal He has very good energy levels and is playing till he sleeps on most days. He has very good memory and learn preferred topics quickly but is unable to focus on any task , he is unable to write or hold pencil for long . He cannot always reply to questions and has ecolalia[unsolicited repetition of utterances made by others] . ‚Äù\n\nAnalysis\n\nLookin at Percentages of Percentiles, I see a different pattern than seen with ME/CFS and Long COVID ‚Äî my most frequent analysis types. He has statistically (between 2 and 5%) significant abnormalities, but far less than people with ME/CFS and Long COVID.\n\nLooking at Potential Medical Conditions Detected we see that ADHD and Mood Disorders patterns are there. Everything is reasonably in range for Dr. Jason Hawrelak Recommendations with two significantly out of range (too low) is Akkermansia (which is available as a probiotic) and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is too high (27%). This pattern is seen across all of his samples.\n\nGoing over to our Citizen Science Special studies, the top three pattern matches are for:\n\nCOVID19 (Long Hauler)\n\nAutism\n\nBrain Fog\n\nThese also are seen with an earlier sample from 2020.\n\nPlan for Suggestions\n\nSince this is a persistent state with reasonable continuity across samples, I am going to go the Uber-Consensus route. By this I mean we will do for Each Sample:\n\n‚ÄúJust Give Me Suggestions‚Äù which executes 4 algorithms\n\nCitizen Science using Autism\n\nThen we combine the suggestions from each sample into one, an uber suggestion consensus. The advantage of this approach is to minimize minor fluctuations of the microbiome over time. This means that we have 20 sets of suggestions combined.\n\nI was disappointed with the results ‚Äî nothing was consistently suggested. I experimented and found that the last two samples gave more consistent results. This implies that there has been significant changes in the microbiome over the last two years.\n\nThe top suggestions from the PDF are below\n\nAs a FYI, in terms of how many times things were suggested:\n\nblackcurrant ‚Äì all 10\n\nlow-fat diets ‚Äì all 10\n\nred alga Laurencia tristicha ‚Äì all 10\n\nlard ‚Äì all 10\n\nMethionine ‚Äì all 10\n\nfat ‚Äì all 10\n\nglycyrrhizic acid (licorice) was 9 for and 1 against\n\nI should talk a bit about the apparent contradiction with low-fat diets vs lard and fat. These come from the terms that clinical studies used. Low fat diet tends towards fish and poultry, lard is a pork product ‚Äì I speculate that the type of fat may be significant.\n\nOn the flip side, we have these avoids. One item seems to be to suggest gluten free (despite wheat being a to-take):\n\nAs an experiment/learning activity ‚Äî I looked at some of the suggested prescription items and checked if any are used for autism. We are matching these items impact on the microbiome and the shifts that this person has (autism as a diagnosis was not considered).\n\ncycloserine ‚Äì D‚Äêcycloserine for autism spectrum disorder [2019]\n\nBumetanide ‚Äì Bumetanide for autism: Open‚Äêlabel trial in six children [2021]\n\ncefixime ‚Äì Beta-Lactam Antibiotics as A Possible Novel Therapy for Managing Epilepsy and Autism, A Case Report and Review of Literature [2015]\n\nchlorpromazine hydrochloride ‚Äì The Pharmacological Treatment of Autistic Spectrum Disorders [2014]\n\nSince the non-prescription items above should cause similar shifts (and likely with less risk of side effects), it appears that the algorithms are making reasonable suggestions.\n\nThe process of checking suggestions derived exclusively from the microbiome against clinical studies for a condition is called cross-validation. When there is a high percentage of agreement, it implies that the mechanism may be via the microbiome and generating candidate substance from the microbiome may produce good results.\n\nKEGG Based Suggestions\n\nThese use data from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to try to identify substances that the microbiome and the body may be short of which can be obtain via supplements or probiotics.\n\nProbiotics (in decreasing priority)\n\nEscherichia coli ‚Äì which can be Mutaflor (recommended above) or Symbioflor-2 (which is easier for people in the US to get).\n\nThere were several items that are counter-indicated from the suggestions ‚Äì when there is disagreement, don‚Äôt gamble ‚Äî ignore\n\nAkkermansia muciniphila ‚Äì low positive score but also identify as low on Dr. Jason Hawrelak Recommendations\n\nSupplements (again double checking across suggestions and keeping only that both agree with)\n\nBiotin, Vitamin B7\n\nArginine\n\nGlutamine\n\nN-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC),\n\nQuestions\n\nQ: His gut according to the test is in good condition. I have heard in the past from one of his doctors that his Gut results were one of the best that he has seen in Autistic children, but we have not been able to make a considerable shift in his symptoms in the last few years.\n\nA: My working hypothesis is simple: symptoms are associated to microbiome shifts. He has bacteria shifts that are matches to autism drugs (see above); so I believe further improvement of the gut and behaviors are possible and probable. He may be good; I believe he can be better.\n\nQ: Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is high in my son , I have read it works as anti-inflammatory , but on the contrary I have heard that children with ASD have an inflamed Brian ,I would have thought this would have worked in his favor.\n\nA: Excellent question! Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is anti-inflammatory for Crohn‚Äôs disease[2008], colitis [2013]. I was unable to find any clear literature on its effect on the brain. I did found some information that cause me to suspect that it does not impact the brain significantly.\n\n‚ÄúA 15kDa protein with anti-inflammatory properties is produced by F. prausnitzii, a commensal bacterium involved in CD pathogenesis. This protein is able to inhibit the NF-Œ∫B pathway in intestinal epithelial cells and to prevent colitis in an animal model.‚Äù [2017] ‚Äì the size of this is very important.\n\n‚ÄúMost proteins in the plasma are not able to cross the blood‚Äîbrain barrier because of their size and hydrophilicity.‚Äù [Basic Neurochemistry]\n\n‚Äúdoes not have a barrier against molecules less than 1 kDa.. may form a barrier against molecules larger than 4 kDa‚Äù [2020]\n\nBottom Line ‚Äî it appears the chemical produced by Faecalibacterium prausnitzii may be too big to reach the brain.\n\nWe also find the following reported, suggesting we want to reduce it to a normal range, you should independently research this\n\n‚ÄúFaecalibacterium predicted social deficit scores in children with ASD‚Äù [2018]\n\n‚ÄúFaecalibacterium prausnitzii ‚Ä¶ were also found to be highly correlated with Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (a measure of Autism severity )‚Äù\n\nOn the flip side, it reduces abdominal pain and improved bowel movement in ASD [2018].\n\n‚ÄúGut microbiome data revealed Akkermansia sp. and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii to be statistically lower in abundance in autistic children than their neurotypical peers with a five and two-fold decrease‚Äù [2021] ‚Äî which may account for the gut issues.\n\n‚ÄúCompared with healthy controls, Faecalibacterium,..were more abundant in ASD patients‚Äù [2021]\n\nYour son‚Äôs range is thus very atypical being many, many times higher than expected.\n\nI have caution here, Faecalibacterium and cognitive issues have inconsistent reports [2021, 2023 ], Faecalibacterium is implicated in cognitive issues[2018]. IMHO, encouraging it to the normal ranges may be the wisest course.\n\nQ: ‚ÄúHis results are over all satisfactory ,same as last year about ‚Äì Gut wellness score ‚Äì 89.52. I have noticed that Clostridia is about 79.7 % could this be the reason, would appreciate your help.‚Äù\n\nA: Clostridia has been high in most samples, I drilled down into it‚Äôs main components\n\n2023-08-21: 80% of the microbiome, 88%ile ‚Äî Oscillospiraceae 89%ile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 96%ile\n\n2022-07-11: 86% of the microbiome, 92%ile ‚Äî Oscillospiraceae 94%ile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 95%ile\n\n2021-11-29: 80% of the microbiome, 88%ile ‚Äî Oscillospiraceae 79%ile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 79%ile\n\n2020-10-14: 83% of the microbiome, 98%ile ‚Äî Oscillospiraceae 100%ile, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 100%ile\n\nSearching for Faecalibacterium + autism on PubMed resulted in 29+ studies. There was nothing found for Oscillospiraceae + autism. Looking at the latest sample, only 10% of the organisms in Oscillospiraceae could be identified in the sample ‚Äî no smoking gun for which genus. Doing a Metagenomic Shotgun Sequencing test would like provide more information (for example, Thorne) ‚Äî but it is unlikely that will produce more actionable item ‚Äî just give names.\n\nLooking at what reduces Oscillospiraceae, we see Bumetanide, cycloserine, cefixime and chlorpromazine in that list (as well as many of the above suggestions).\n\nSome visuals: Clostridia is not that extreme, but two of it‚Äôs children are.\n\nMicrobiome Suggestions for Autism ‚Äî Cross Validation\n\nMicrobiome Prescription uses over a million rules to generate suggestions on improving the microbiome and hopefully reduce or moderate autism behavior. All of the sources of the rules are studies on the US National Library of Medicine. Microbiome Prescription also can provide the complete evidence trail for every suggestion! That is, where ‚Äî precisely‚Äì is all of the information coming from ‚Äî none of it is private personal opinion or speculation.\n\nCross Validation\n\nCross validation is the process of taking one set of information to generate forecasts or suggestions and then look at a totally independent source of information to see if the forecasts and suggestions are valid, reasonable, and appear to help individuals with the condition. I have done that for several conditions with very good results. NOTE: Everything is generated by code ‚Äî code that I prefer to improve or correct. I have no personal stake in the suggestion, nothing to defend.\n\nSource of Suggestions\n\nSimple, ü•£ Candidates which is based on bacteria shifts reported from studies for autism: ü¶† Taxons.

We have 5 such items above.\n\nRemember these are GENERIC Suggestions for GENERIC Autism\n\nThe results of an individuals microbiome will be different ‚Äî there are many variants and subsets for Autism. Each variant will tend towards their own set of variations for the microbiome. Using an individual‚Äôs microbiome sample will get suggestions unique for them.\n\nPostscript ‚Äì and Reminder\n\nI am not a licensed medical professional and there are strict laws where I live about ‚Äúappearing to practice medicine‚Äù. I am safe when it is ‚Äúacademic models‚Äù and I keep to the language of science, especially statistics. I am not safe when the explanations have possible overtones of advising a patient instead of presenting data to be evaluated by a medical professional before implementing.\n\nI cannot tell people what they should take or not take. I can inform people items that have better odds of improving their microbiome as a results on numeric calculations. I am a trained experienced statistician with appropriate degrees and professional memberships. All suggestions should be reviewed by your medical professional before starting.\n\nThe answers above describe my logic and thinking and is not intended to give advice to this person or any one.
