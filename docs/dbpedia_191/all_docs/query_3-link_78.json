        "text": "Highlights of the Didymellaceae: A polyphasic approach to characterise Phoma and related pleosporalean genera\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAveskamp, M.M.; de Gruyter, J.; Woudenberg, J.H.C.; Verkley, G.J.M.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFungal taxonomists routinely encounter problems when dealing with asexual fungal species due to poly- and paraphyletic generic phylogenies, and unclear species boundaries. These problems are aptly illustrated in the genus Phoma. This phytopathologically significant fungal genus is currently subdivided into nine sections which are mainly based on a single or just a few morphological characters. However, this subdivision is ambiguous as several of the section-specific characters can occur within a single species. In addition, many teleomorph genera have been linked to Phoma, three of which are recognised here. In this study it is attempted to delineate generic boundaries, and to come to a generic circumscription which is more correct from an evolutionary point of view by means of multilocus sequence typing. Therefore, multiple analyses were conducted utilising sequences obtained from 28S nrDNA (Large Subunit - LSU), 18S nrDNA (Small Subunit - SSU), the Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 & 2 and 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), and part of the Î²-tubulin (TUB) gene region. A total of 324 strains were included in the analyses of which most belonged to Phoma taxa, whilst 54 to related pleosporalean fungi. In total, 206 taxa were investigated, of which 159 are known to have affinities to Phoma. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the current Boeremaean subdivision is incorrect from an evolutionary point of view, revealing the genus to be highly polyphyletic. Phoma species are retrieved in six distinct clades within the Pleosporales, and appear to reside in different families. The majority of the species, however, including the generic type, clustered in a recently established family, Didymellaceae. In the second part of this study, the phylogenetic variation of the species and varieties in this clade was further assessed. Next to the genus Didymella, which is considered to be the sole teleomorph of Phoma s. str., we also retrieved taxa belonging to the teleomorph genera\n\nRedisposition of phoma-like anamorphs in Pleosporales\n\nPubMed Central\n\nde Gruyter, J.; Woudenberg, J.H.C.; Aveskamp, M.M.; Verkley, G.J.M.; Groenewald, J.Z.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe anamorphic genus Phoma was subdivided into nine sections based on morphological characters, and included teleomorphs in Didymella, Leptosphaeria, Pleospora and Mycosphaerella, suggesting the polyphyly of the genus. Recent molecular, phylogenetic studies led to the conclusion that Phoma should be restricted to Didymellaceae. The present study focuses on the taxonomy of excluded Phoma species, currently classified in Phoma sections Plenodomus, Heterospora and Pilosa. Species of Leptosphaeria and Phoma section Plenodomus are reclassified in Plenodomus, Subplenodomus gen. nov., Leptosphaeria and Paraleptosphaeria gen. nov., based on the phylogeny determined by analysis of sequence data of the large subunit 28S nrDNA (LSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacer regions 1 & 2 and 5.8S nrDNA (ITS). Phoma heteromorphospora, type species of Phoma section Heterospora, and its allied species Phoma dimorphospora, are transferred to the genus Heterospora stat. nov. The Phoma acuta complex (teleomorph Leptosphaeria doliolum), is revised based on a multilocus sequence analysis of the LSU, ITS, small subunit 18S nrDNA (SSU), Î²-tubulin (TUB), and chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1) regions. Species of Phoma section Pilosa and allied Ascochyta species were determined to belong to Pleosporaceae based on analysis of actin (ACT) sequence data. Anamorphs that are similar morphologically to Phoma and described in Ascochyta, Asteromella, Coniothyrium, Plectophomella, Pleurophoma and Pyrenochaeta are included in this study. Phoma-like species, which grouped outside the Pleosporineae based on a LSU sequence analysis, are transferred to the genera Aposphaeria, Paraconiothyrium and Westerdykella. The genera Medicopsis gen. nov. and Nigrograna gen. nov. are introduced to accommodate the medically important species formerly known as Pyrenochaeta romeroi and Pyrenochaeta mackinnonii, respectively.

The conventional system of identification is functional but it has its limitations. Besides morphological studies, chemotaxonomy, secondary metabolite and protein profiling have been assessed for the classification and identification of these fungi. Molecular datasets have provided a better outlook towards the phylogenetic and evolutionary trends of Phoma. Molecular markers such as ITS-rDNA, tubulin, actin, translation elongation factor have been widely used by the taxonomists to demarcate species. However, outcomes gained up till now represent preliminary step towards the study of Phoma systematics and a combined approach would be beneficial in the understanding of this polyphyletic group members. Lately, on the base of molecular phylogeny of the type species of the seven Phoma sections a new teleomorph family, Didymellaceae has been established, besides the Phaeosphaeriaceae related to sect. Paraphoma anamorphs, and the Leptosphaeriaceae to sect. Heterospora anamorphs. The estimated ratio is about 70Â % of the recognized Phoma-like species can be associated with the Didymellaceae ascomycetous family.\n\nWasalexins A and B, new phytoalexins from wasabi: isolation, synthesis, and antifungal activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nPedras, M S; Sorensen, J L; Okanga, F I; Zaharia, I L\n\n1999-10-18\n\nThe chemical structure determination of two phytoalexins from wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi), a plant resistant to virulent isolates of the blackleg fungus [Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not., asexual stage Phoma lingam (Tode ex Fr.) Desm.], as well as their synthesis and antifungal activity towards isolates of P. lingam and P. wasabiae is reported.\n\nResolving the Phoma enigma\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Q.; Jiang, J.R.; Zhang, G.Z.; Cai, L.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe Didymellaceae was established in 2009 to accommodate Ascochyta, Didymella and Phoma, as well as several related phoma-like genera. The family contains numerous plant pathogenic, saprobic and endophytic species associated with a wide range of hosts. Ascochyta and Phoma are morphologically difficult to distinguish, and species from both genera have in the past been linked to Didymella sexual morphs. The aim of the present study was to clarify the generic delimitation in Didymellaceae by combing multi-locus phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tub2, and morphological observations. The resulting phylogenetic tree revealed 17 well-supported monophyletic clades in Didymellaceae, leading to the introduction of nine genera, three species, two nomina nova and 84 combinations. Furthermore, 11 epitypes and seven neotypes were designated to help stabilise the taxonomy and use of names. As a result of these data, Ascochyta, Didymella and Phoma were delineated as three distinct genera, and the generic circumscriptions of Ascochyta, Didymella, Epicoccum and Phoma emended. Furthermore, the genus Microsphaeropsis, which is morphologically distinct from the members of Didymellaceae, grouped basal to the Didymellaceae, for which a new family Microsphaeropsidaceae was introduced.

A hybrid endochitinase gene under a constitutive promoter was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into a winter-type oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera) inbred line. Progeny from transformed plants was challenged using three different fungal pathogens (Cylindrosporium concentricum, Phoma lingam, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) in field trials at two different geographical locations. These plants exhibited an increased tolerance to disease as compared with the nontransgenic parental plants. 31 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.\n\nOutbreaks of phaeohyphomycosis in the chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) caused by Phoma herbarum.\n\nPubMed\n\nFaisal, Mohamed; Elsayed, Ehab; Fitzgerald, Scott D; Silva, Victor; Mendoza, Leonel\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPhoma herbarum has been associated with two outbreaks of systemic mycosis in hatchery-reared chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fingerlings. Affected fish exhibited abnormal swimming behavior, exophthalmia, multiple rounded areas of muscle softening, protruded hemorrhagic vents, and abdominal swelling. In all affected fish, swimbladders were filled with whitish creamy viscous fungal mass, surrounded by dark red areas in swimbladder walls, kidneys, and musculature. Clinical and histopathological examinations suggest that the infection may have started primarily in the swimbladder and then spread to the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and surrounding musculature. Consistent microscopical findings included broad septate branched fungal hyaline hyphae, 5-12 microm in diameter within the swimbladder, stomach, and often within and adjacent to blood vessels. Profuse growths of woolly brown fungal colonies were obtained from swimbladders and kidneys on Sabouraud medium. On corn meal agar the formation of pycnidia, characteristic of Phoma spp., was detected within 10 days of incubation. Morphological and molecular analyses identified this fungus as Phoma herbarum. This report underscores systemic fungal infections as a threat to raceway-raised salmon.\n\nThe isolation of Phoma eupyrena from a human lesion.\n\nPubMed\n\nBakerspigel, A; Lowe, D; Rostas, A\n\n1981-06-01\n\nA strain of the soil-borne fungus Phoma eupyrena was isolated from the skin of an 18-month-old boy who had a crusting, erythematous, perioral eruption of one month's duration. Treatment with clotrimazole, 15% zinc oxide paste, and dimethicone resulted in eradication of the fungus and in complete healing of the lesions in eight weeks.\n\nThree Phoma spp. synthesised novel silver nanoparticles that possess excellent antimicrobial efficacy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRai, Mahendra; Ingle, Avinash P; Gade, Aniket K; Duarte, Marta Cristina Teixeira; Duran, Nelson\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe authors report extracellular mycosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by Phoma capsulatum, Phoma putaminum and Phoma citri. The AgNPs thus synthesised were characterised by UV-visible spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Nanosight LM20 and transmission electron microscopy, which confirmed the synthesis of mostly spherical and polydisperse nanoparticles capped with proteins. The size of AgNPs was found in the range of 10-80 , 5-80 and 5-90 nm with an average size of 31.85, 25.43 and 23.29 nm by P. capsulatum, P. putaminum and P. citri, respectively. Further, potential antimicrobial activity was reported against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The lowest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (0.85 Âµg/ml) was reported for AgNPs synthesised from P. citri against S. choleraesuis. However, AgNPs synthesised from P. capsulatum showed the highest MIC (10.62 Âµg/ml) against S. choleraesuis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (clinical isolate). The same MIC values (10.62 Âµg/ml) were also reported against P. aeruginosa and both clinical and standard isolates of E. coli for AgNPs synthesised from P. citri. It was also observed that all the silver nanoparticles showed remarkable antifungal and antibacterial activity against these tested pathogens as compared with the commercially available antifungal and antibacterial agents.\n\nPolyphasic taxonomy of Aspergillus section Fumigati and its teleomorph Neosartorya\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSamson, R.A.; Hong, S.; Peterson, S.W.; Frisvad, J.C.; Varga, J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe taxonomy of Aspergillus section Fumigati with its teleomorph genus Neosartorya is revised. The species concept is based on phenotypic (morphology and extrolite profiles) and molecular (Î²-tubulin and calmodulin gene sequences) characters in a polyphasic approach. Four new taxa are proposed: N. australensis N. ferenczii, N. papuaensis and N. warcupii. All newly described and accepted species are illustrated. The section consists of 33 taxa: 10 strictly anamorphic Aspergillus species and 23 Neosartorya species. Four other Neosartorya species described previously were not available for this monograph, and consequently are relegated to the category of doubtful species.

Distinct differences were observed in genetic variation among nine species of the genus Phoma. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) revealed the presence of intraspecific genetic variation among the isolates of P. macrostoma, with the isolates being used for biological weed control being distributed in a distinct phylogenetic cluster. Additional variation within the biocontrol isolate cluster in P. macrostoma was revealed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), which showed that biocontrol isolates generated two different chromosomal profiles, however the profiles did not relate to their Canadian ecozone origin. Mating studies showed that biocontrol isolates of P. macrostoma from Canada did not produce sexual reproductive structures and were incapable of crossing. These studies also confirmed that no obvious differentiation exists among the biocontrol isolates of P. macrostoma from Canadian Ecozones 3 and 4.\n\nRecovery Plan for Red Leaf Blotch of Soybean Caused by Phoma glycinicola\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nRed leaf blotch (RLB) of soybean is caused by the fungal pathogen Phoma glycinicola, formerly known in the plant pathology literature as Pyrenochaeta glycines, Dactuliophora glycines, and Dactuliochaeata glycines. The disease presently occurs in only a few African countries on soybean and a wild leg...\n\nOgataea pignaliae sp. nov., the teleomorph of Candida pignaliae.\n\nPubMed\n\nPÃ©ter, GÃ¡bor; Tornai-Lehoczki, Judit; Dlauchy, DÃ©nes\n\n2010-10-01\n\nSix ascosporulating Candida pignaliae strains were isolated from epigeal plant parts in Hungary. They share identical D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene sequences with the type strain of C. pignaliae, and the physiological characteristics investigated are also very similar to that of the type strain. The only substantial difference compared to the type strain of C. pignaliae is their ability to assimilate Î²-glucosides (cellobiose, salicin and arbutin). The majority of the isolation sources of the strains reported in this study have the common feature of containing tannic acid, while the type strain of C. pignaliae was recovered from tanning fluid. We were able to induce ascosporulation also in the type strain of C. pignaliae. Therefore, Ogataea pignaliae PÃ©ter, Tornai-Lehoczki & Dlauchy sp. nov. is proposed as the teleomorph of C. pignaliae (F. H. Jacob) S. A. Meyer & Yarrow. The type strain is CBS 6071(T).\n\nA disseminated infection with the antifungal-multiresistant teleomorphic fungus Neocosmospora vasinfecta in a patient with acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabriel, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; D'Almeida, Mahussi; Albert, Olivier; Fitton-Ouhabi, ValÃ©rie; NoÃ«l, Thierry; Accoceberry, Isabelle\n\n2013-02-09\n\nWe report on a fatal invasive infection due to the ascomycetous fungus Neocosmospora vasinfecta, in a 20-year-old European patient suffering from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The infection could not be controlled by a bitherapy combining liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole. This is the second case of disseminated infection reported with this unusual fungus, which develops under its teleomorphic state, is fully resistant to all systemic antifungals, and which is known to live in tropical countries.\n\nA disseminated infection with the antifungal-multiresistant teleomorphic fungus Neocosmospora vasinfecta in a patient with acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGabriel, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; DâAlmeida, Mahussi; Albert, Olivier; Fitton-Ouhabi, ValÃ©rie; NoÃ«l, Thierry; Accoceberry, Isabelle\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe report on a fatal invasive infection due to the ascomycetous fungus Neocosmospora vasinfecta, in a 20-year-old European patient suffering from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Tricyclazole, a specific inhibitor of pentaketide melanin biosynthesis, blocked the biosynthesis of melanin in Curvularia lunata and caused the accumulation of the melanin metabolites flaviolin and 2-hydroxyjuglone. This showed that melanin in Curvularia lunata is produced by a pentaketide pathway from 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene. The 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (3HNR) gene, associated with the melanin pathway of Curvularia lunata, was identified and characterized. An alignment of 3HNR sequences enabled the design of primers covering conserved regions. A PCR-amplified fragment of Curvularia lunata genomic DNA was used for screening the cDNA library. Three independent cDNA clones revealed an 801-bp open reading frame encoding a 267 amino acid protein. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The predicted amino acid sequence of the 28.6-kDa protein demonstrated homology to other fungal 3HNR and other members of the short-chain dehydrogenase super family. Northern analyses revealed that 3HNR from Curvularia lunata is expressed synchronously with melanization after 3 days of Curvularia lunata growth in malt extract medium. No 3HNR reductase gene expression nor melanization was observed when Curvularia lunata was grown in yeast nitrogen base medium.\n\nLaccase production by the aquatic ascomycete Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 and the white rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus DSM 1833 during submerged cultivation on banana peels and enzyme applicability for the removal of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.\n\nPubMed\n\nLibardi, Nelson; Gern, Regina Maria Miranda; Furlan, Sandra Aparecida; Schlosser, Dietmar\n\n2012-07-01\n\nThis work aimed to study the production of laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus DSM 1833 and Phoma sp. UHH 5-1-03 using banana peels as alternative carbon source, the subsequent partial purification and characterization of the enzyme, as well the applicability to degrade endocrine disruptors. The laccase stability with pH and temperature, the optimum pH, the K (m) and V(max) parameters, and the molar mass were determined. Tests were conducted for assessing the ability of degradation of the endocrine disruptors t-nonylphenol, bisphenol A, and 17Î±-ethinylestradiol. Laccase production of 752 and 1,117 UâLâ»Â¹ was obtained for Phoma sp. and P. ostreatus, respectively. Phoma sp. laccase showed higher stability with temperature and pH. The laccase from both species showed higher affinity by syringaldazine. The culture broth with banana peels induced the production of two isoforms of P. ostreatus (58.7 and 21 kDa) and one of Phoma sp. laccase (72 kDa). In the first day of incubation, the concentrations of bisphenol A and 17Î±-ethinylestradiol were reduced to values close to zero and after 3 days the concentration of t-nonylphenol was reduced in 90% by the P. ostreatus laccase, but there was no reduction in its concentration by the Phoma sp. laccase.\n\nThe novel gluconeogenesis inhibitor FR225654 that originates from Phoma sp. no. 00144.

In this report, S.apiospermum infection in a 62 year old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia was presented. During remission-induction chemotherapy, piperacillin-tazobactam therapy was started for febrile neutropenia. Since fever had continued, treatment was switched to imipenem and also amphotericin B deoxycholate was added to the treatment protocol. Because of allergic reaction to amphotericin B, caspofungin was started at the fifth day of neutropenic fever. Following imaging studies with high resolution computerized thorasic tomography, antifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole due to findings suggestive of invasive aspergillosis. Since galactomannan antigen was found negative at the first day of voriconazole therapy, bronchoalveolar lavage material from apical segment of the left lower lobe was cultured onto various microbiologic media. S.apiospermum (Teleomorph: Pseudallescheria apiosperma) was isolated on the fourth day of cultivation. According to CLSI M38-A2 microdilution procedure, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of voriconazole, caspofungin, amphotericin B and posaconazole were found as 0.06, 2, 8 and 4 Âµg/ml, respectively. Since neutropenia was resolved, the patient was discharged with continued voriconazole therapy. It was concluded that antifungal susceptibility tests should be performed for Scedosporium species and the results should be compared to the clinical response. The determination of MIC breakpoints may provide useful information for the recommendation and use of optimal choices for the treatment of Scedosporium infections.\n\nPathogenicity and ultrastructural studies of the mode of penetration by Phoma strasseri in peppermint stems and rhizomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nZimowska, Beata\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPathogenicity and ultrastructural investigation of the inoculation of peppermint stems and rhizomes with Phoma strasseri conidia was undertaken using scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine the host-parasite relationship. Pathogenicity experiments demonstrated that all tested P. strasseri isolates had infected the stems and rhizomes of peppermint. Of all inoculation methods, direct placement of colonized agar plugs on damaged epidermis and soaking stems and rhizomes in conidial suspension were the most effective. The behavior of the conidia deposited on the stems and rhizomes was investigated at different time intervals after inoculation: 6, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h. Conidia produced an appressorium directly at the end of a short germ tube. Appressoria were formed over the cuticle, but never over stomata. Direct penetration to host tissue through the cuticle was observed. The spore and hyphae were covered with a mucilaginous sheath.\n\nRecent advances in genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, hyphal development, energy metabolism and pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae).\n\nPubMed\n\nGeng, Zongyi; Zhu, Wei; Su, Hao; Zhao, Yong; Zhang, Ke-Qin; Yang, Jinkui\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe ascomycete fungus, Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae), is the most common causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a devastating disease for cereal crops worldwide. F. graminearum produces ascospores (sexual spores) and conidia (asexual spores), which can serve as disease inocula of FHB. Meanwhile, Fusarium-infected grains are often contaminated with mycotoxins such as trichothecenes (TRIs), fumonisins, and zearalenones, among which TRIs are related to the pathogenicity of F. graminearum, and these toxins are hazardous to humans and livestock. In recent years, with the complete genome sequencing of F. graminearum, an increasing number of functional genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites, hyphal differentiation, sexual and asexual reproduction, virulence and pathogenicity have been identified from F. graminearum. In this review, the secondary metabolite synthesis, hyphal development and pathogenicity related genes in F. graminearum were thoroughly summarized, and the genes associated with secondary metabolites, sexual reproduction, energy metabolism, and pathogenicity were highlighted.

YN02-P-3.\n\nPubMed\n\nSang, Xia-Nan; Chen, Shao-Fei; Tang, Ming-Xu; Wang, Hai-Feng; An, Xiao; Lu, Xiao-Jie; Zhao, Dan; Wang, Yu-Bo; Bai, Jiao; Hua, Hui-Ming; Chen, Gang; Pei, Yue-Hu\n\n2017-08-15\n\nFour new Î±-pyrone derivatives phomones C-F (1-4) together with four known compounds (5-8) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Phoma sp. YN02-P-3. Compound 1 is the first example of 6-Î±,Î²-unsaturated ester-2-pyrone dimers via intermolecular symmetrical [2+2] cycloaddition. The chemical structures of these compounds were determined from spectroscopic data (1D/2D NMR, MS and IR). The acetylated product (9) of 1 along with compounds 1-8 were then tested for their cytotoxicity against HL-60, PC-3 and HCT-116 cell lines. Compounds 2, 3, 5 and 9 with acetyl groups showed significant inhibitory activities against the three cell lines with IC 50 values in the range 0.52-9.85Î¼M. while compounds 1, 4 and 6-8 that possess no acetyl group showed no inhibitory activity (IC 50 >50Î¼M), indicating that the acetyl group at 10- or 12- are essential for their cytotoxic activities. The structure-activity relationships of these phomones were also reported. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-5.8S and D1/D2 domains of the large subunit of the rRNA gene showed that this species belongs to the genus Hyphopichia and its closest relative is Candida homilentoma. These species differ by 44 nucleotide substitutions in D1/D2 sequences. A new species Hyphopichia buzzinii f. a., sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these isolates. The type strain of Hyphopichia buzzinii sp. nov. is CLIB 1739 T (=CBS 14300 T Â =Â UFMG-CM-Y6121 T ; MycoBank number is MB 815609). In addition, we isolated 11 strains of C. homilentoma from rotting wood, leaf surfaces, and water bodies in Brazil, and these strains when crossed among one another and with the type strain (CBS 6312 T ) of this species, produced hat-shaped ascospores typical of the genus Hyphopichia. We describe the teleomorph of C. homilentoma as a new combination, Hyphopichia homilentoma comb. nov. (type strain CBS 6312 T ; MycoBank number is MB 820009). We also propose to transfer the other six Candida species of the Hyphopichia clade to this genus as new combinations. Hyphopichia homilentoma produced ethanol and xylitol from D-xylose whereas H. buzzinii was only able to convert this pentose to xylitol.\n\nDevelopment of a rapid and sensitive HPLC method for the identification and quantification of cavoxin and cavoxone in Phoma cava culture filtrates.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasi, Marco; Moeini, Seyed Arash; Boari, Angela; Cimmino, Alessio; Vurro, Maurizio; Evidente, Antonio\n\n2018-07-01\n\nCavoxin is a tetrasubstituted phytotoxic chalcone and cavoxone is the corresponding chroman-4-one, both produced in vitro by Phoma cava, a fungus isolated from chestnut. Cavoxin showed biofungicide potential against fungal species responsible for food moulding. Therefore, cavoxin has potential to be incorporated into biopolymer to generate 'intelligent food packaging'. To reach this objective, large-scale production of cavoxin by P. cava fermentation needs to be optimized. A rapid and efficient method for cavoxin analysis, as well as of cavoxone, in the fungal culture filtrates and the corresponding organic extracts is the first experimental step. Thus, a HPLC method was developed and applied to quantify cavoxin and cavoxone production in two different fungal culture conditions. The analysis proved that cavoxin production in stirred culture filtrates is significantly higher than in static ones.\n\nProduction of Gentisyl Alcohol from Phoma herbarum Endophytic in Curcuma longa L. and Its Antagonistic Activity Towards Leaf Spot Pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, Suruchi; Kaul, Sanjana; Singh, Baljinder; Vishwakarma, Ram A; Dhar, Manoj K\n\n2016-11-01\n\nEndophytes from medicinal plants represent a potential source of bioactive compounds. During the present investigation, fungal endophytes were isolated from turmeric (Curcuma longa), an important medicinal plant. A total of 207 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from the rhizome of C. longa L. They were grouped into seven genera based on morphological and molecular data. The fungal endophytes of C. longa were evaluated for antifungal activity against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, the causal organism of leaf spot of turmeric. The disease is a major cause for economic loss in turmeric cultivation. Endophytic Phoma herbarum showed significant activity against C. gloeosporioides and was therefore selected for further studies. A compound gentisyl alcohol was isolated from P. herbarum which showed effective antagonism against C. gloeosporioides. The organism could therefore be used as a biocontrol agent against C. gloeosporioides.\n\nAnalysis of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Plant Growth-Promoting Fungus Phoma sp. GS8-3 for Growth Promotion Effects on Tobacco\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNaznin, Hushna Ara; Kimura, Minako; Miyazawa, Mitsuo; Hyakumachi, Mitsuro\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe extracted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by a plant growth-promoting fungus (PGPF) Phoma sp. GS8-3 by gas chromatography and identified them by mass spectrometry. All of the identified compounds belonged to C4-C8 hydrocarbons. Volatiles varied in number and quantity by the culture period of the fungus (in days). 2-Methyl-propanol and 3-methyl-butanol formed the main components of the volatile blends for all the culture periods of fungus. Growth-promoting effects of the identified synthetic compounds were analyzed individually and in blends using tobacco plants. We found that the mixture of volatiles extracted from 3-day-old culture showed significant growth promotion in tobacco in vitro. The volatile blend showed better growth promotion at lower than higher concentrations. Our results confirm the potential role of volatile organic compounds in the mechanism of growth enhancement by GS8-3.

The lignin remaining after cultivation was shown to have a lower molecular weight. The reduction in the numbers of ether linkages of the extracted lignins was also observed by derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC) in combination with (31)P NMR studies. The fungal strain showed an ability to degrade synthetic lignin by extracellular catalysts. GC-MS was applied to study the evolution of low molar mass adducts, e.g., monolignols and it was shown that a reduced coniferyl alcohol product was produced from DHP in a cell-free environment. The work has demonstrated the ability of soil microbes to grow on lignin as sole carbon source. The potential impact is in the production of low molar mass renewable phenols for material application.\n\nWhere Should We Look for Life?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKohler, Susanna\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe first challenge in the hunt for life elsewhere in our universe is to decide where to look. In a new study, two scientists examine whether Sun-like stars or low-mass M dwarfs are the best bet for hosting exoplanets with detectable life.Ambiguity of HabitabilityThe habitable zones of cool M-dwarf stars lie much closer in than for Sun-like stars, placing habitable-zone planets around M dwarfs at greater risk of being affected by space weather.Most exoplanet scientists will freely admit frustration with the term habitability its a word that has many different meanings and is easily misinterpreted when it appears in news articles. Just because a planet lies in a stars habitable zone, for instance, doesnt mean its necessarily capable of supporting life.This ambiguity, argue authors Manasvi Lingam and Abraham Loeb (Harvard University and Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), requires us to take a strategic approach when pursuing the search for primitive life outside of our solar system. In particular, we risk losing the enthusiasm and support of the public (and funding sources!) when wefocus on the general search for planets in stellar habitable zones, rather than specifically searching for the planets most likely to have detectable signatures of life.Illustration of the difference between a Sun-like star and a lower-mass, cooler M-dwarf star. [NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center/S. Wiessinger]Weighing Two TargetsSo how do we determine where best to look for planets with detectable biosignatures? To figure out which stars make the optimal targets, Lingam and Loeb suggest an approach based on standard cost-benefit analyses common in economics. Here, whats being balanced is the cost of an exoplanet survey mission against the benefit of different types of stellar targets.In particular, Lingam and Loeb weigh the benefit of targeting solar-type stars against that of targeting stars of any other mass (such as low-mass M-dwarfs, popular targets of many current\n\nThe stem canker (blackleg) fungus, Leptosphaeria maculans, enters the genomic era.\n\nPubMed\n\nRouxel, T; Balesdent, M H\n\n2005-05-01\n\nSUMMARY Leptosphaeria maculans is the most ubiquitous pathogen of Brassica crops, and mainly oilseed brassicas (oilseed rape, canola), causing the devastating 'stem canker' or 'blackleg'. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the pathogen, from taxonomic issues to specific life traits. It mainly illustrates the importance of formal genetics approaches on the pathogen side to dissect the interaction with the host plants. In addition, this review presents the main current research topics on L. maculans and focuses on the L. maculans genome initiative recently begun, including its main research issues. Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. & de Not. (anamorph Phoma lingam Tode ex Fr.). Kingdom Fungi, Phylum Ascomycota, Class Dothideomycetes (Loculoascomycetes), Order Pleosporales, Genus Leptosphaeria, Species maculans. cultivated Brassicas such as Brassica napus (oilseed rape, canola), B. rapa, B. juncea, B. oleracea, etc., along with numerous wild crucifers species. Arabidopsis thaliana was recently reported to be a potential host for L. maculans. Primary disease symptoms are greyish-green collapse of cotyledon or leaf tissue, without a visible margin, bearing tiny black spots (pycnidia). The fungus then develops an endophytic symptomless growth for many months. Secondary symptoms, at the end of the growing season, are dry necroses of the crown tissues with occasional blackening (stem canker or blackleg) causing lodging of the plants. Pseudothecia differentiate on leftover residues. Seedling damping-off and premature ripening are also reported under certain environmental conditions.

The producer was taxonomically characterized as Phoma sp. FL-41510. TAN-1813 inhibited rat brain farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I activity with IC50 values of 23 microg/ml and 47/microg/ml, respectively. TAN-1813 showed mixed-type inhibition with respect to farnesylpyrophosphate and noncompetitive inhibition with respect to a K-Ras C-terminal peptide. It also inhibited the in situ farnesylation of cellular Ras proteins in a K-ras transformant (NIH3T3/K-ras) of mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. TAN- 1813 inhibited the proliferation of various human cancer cells, some of which harbor activated ras alleles, with IC50 values of 15 approximately 110 ng/ml as well as that of NIH3T3 and NIH3T3/K-ras cells with IC50S of 540 and 310 ng/ml, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that TAN-1813 arrests NIH3T3/K-ras cells at both G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. In addition, TAN-1813 was found to induce morphological reversion of NIH3T3/K-ras cells from the transformed phenotype. Antitumor activity of TAN-1813 against human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 and NIH3T3/K-ras tumors in nude mice was also verified.\n\nOn the reclassification of species assigned to Candida and other anamorphic ascomycetous yeast genera based on phylogenetic circumscription\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nMultigene phylogenies have been instrumental in revising the classification of ascosporic (teleomorph) yeasts in a natural system based on lines of decent.

The result is an extensive revision of taxonomic concepts, typification, and nomenclatural details of many anamorph- and teleomorph-typified genera of the Nectriaceae, most notably Cosmospora and Fusarium. The combined phylogenetic analysis shows that the present concept of Fusarium is not monophyletic and that the genus divides into two large groups, one basal in the family, the other terminal, separated by a large group of species classified in genera such as Calonectria, Neonectria, and Volutella. All accepted genera received high statistical support in the phylogenetic analyses. Preliminary polythetic morphological descriptions are presented for each genus, providing details of perithecia, micro- and/or macro-conidial synanamorphs, cultural characters, and ecological traits. Eight species are included in our restricted concept of Cosmospora, two of which have previously documented teleomorphs and all of which have Acremonium-like microconidial anamorphs. A key is provided to the three anamorphic species recognised in Atractium, which is removed from synonymy with Fusarium and epitypified for two macroconidial synnematous species and one sporodochial species associated with waterlogged wood. Dialonectria is recognised as distinct from Cosmospora and two species with teleomorph, macroconidia and microconidia are accepted, including the new species D. ullevolea. Seven species, one with a known teleomorph, are classified in Fusicolla, formerly considered a synonym of Fusarium including members of the F. aquaeductuum and F. merismoides species complex, with several former varieties raised to species rank.

Ten of these are described as new, including teleomorphs for two previously known anamorphic species. In two species the teleomorph has been found in nature and in three others it was obtained in culture; only anamorphs are known for the rest. None of the studied tropical collections belongs to the common temperate species H. rosellus and H. odoratus to which the tropical teleomorphic collections had previously been assigned. Instead, taxa encountered in the tropics are genetically and morphologically distinct from the nine species of Hypomyces/Cladobotryum producing red pigments known from temperate regions. Besides observed host preferences, anamorphs of several species can spread fast on soft ephemeral agaricoid basidiomata but the slower developing teleomorphs are mostly found on polyporoid basidiomata or bark. While a majority of previous records from the tropics involve collections from Central America, this paper also reports the diversity of these fungi in the Paleotropics. Africa appears to hold a variety of taxa as five of the new species include material collected in scattered localities of this mostly unexplored continent. In examining distribution patterns, most of the taxa do not appear to be pantropical. Some species are known only from the Western Hemisphere, while others have a geographic range from southeastern Asia to Africa or Australia. The use of various morphological characters of anamorphs and teleomorphs as well as culture characteristics in species delimitation is evaluated. For detecting genetic segregation, partial sequences of the two largest subunits of the ribosomal polymerase perform the best in terms of providing informative sites and the number of well-supported groups recognised in the phylogenies. These are followed by the sequence data of the translation-elongation factor 1-alpha, while the ribosomal DNA\n\nFungal dimorphism: the switch from hyphae to yeast is a specialized morphogenetic adaptation allowing colonization of a host.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoyce, Kylie J; Andrianopoulos, Alex\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe ability of pathogenic fungi to switch between a multicellular hyphal and unicellular yeast growth form is a tightly regulated process known as dimorphic switching. Dimorphic switching requires the fungus to sense and respond to the host environment and is essential for pathogenicity. This review will focus on the role of dimorphism in fungi commonly called thermally dimorphic fungi, which switch to a yeast growth form during infection. This group of phylogenetically diverse ascomycetes includes Talaromyces marneffei (recently renamed from Penicillium marneffei), Blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph Ajellomyces dermatitidis), Coccidioides species (C. immitis and C. posadasii), Histoplasma capsulatum (teleomorph Ajellomyces capsulatum), Paracoccidioides species (P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii) and Sporothrix schenckii (teleomorph Ophiostoma schenckii). This review will explore both the signalling pathways regulating the morphological transition and the transcriptional responses necessary for intracellular growth. The physiological requirements of yeast cells during infection will also be discussed, highlighting recent advances in the understanding of the role of iron and calcium acquisition during infection.

Z.; Braun, U.; Dijksterhuis, J.; Starink, M.; Hill, C.F.; Zalar, P.; de Hoog, G.S.; Crous, P.W.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe Cladosporium herbarum complex comprises five species for which Davidiella teleomorphs are known. Cladosporium herbarum s. str. (D. tassiana), C. macrocarpum (D. macrocarpa) and C. bruhnei (D. allicina) are distinguishable by having conidia of different width, and by teleomorph characters. Davidiella variabile is introduced as teleomorph of C. variabile, a homothallic species occurring on Spinacia, and D. macrospora is known to be the teleomorph of C. iridis on Iris spp. The C. herbarum complex combines low molecular distance with a high degree of clonal or inbreeding diversity. Entities differ from each other by multilocus sequence data and by phenetic differences, and thus can be interpreted to represent individual taxa. Isolates of the C. herbarum complex that were formerly associated with opportunistic human infections, cluster with C. bruhnei. Several species are newly described from hypersaline water, namely C. ramotenellum, C. tenellum, C. subinflatum, and C. herbaroides. Cladosporium pseudiridis collected from Iris sp. in New Zealand, is also a member of this species complex and shown to be distinct from C. iridis that occurs on this host elsewhere in the world. A further new species from New Zealand is C. sinuosum on Fuchsia excorticata. Cladosporium antarcticum is newly described from a lichen, Caloplaca regalis, collected in Antarctica, and C. subtilissimum from grape berries in the U.S.A., while the new combination C. ossifragi, the oldest valid name of the Cladosporium known from Narthecium in Europe, is proposed. Standard protocols and media are herewith proposed to facilitate future morphological examination of Cladosporium spp. in culture, and neotypes or epitypes are proposed for all species treated.

Probably, the most studied biocontrol agents are species of the genus Hypocrea/Trichoderma. Results Here we report an analysis of the genome sequences of the two biocontrol species Trichoderma atroviride (teleomorph Hypocrea atroviridis) and Trichoderma virens (formerly Gliocladium virens, teleomorph Hypocrea virens), and a comparison with Trichoderma reesei (teleomorph Hypocrea jecorina). These three Trichoderma species display a remarkable conservation of gene order (78 to 96%), and a lack of active mobile elements probably due to repeat-induced point mutation. Several gene families are expanded in the two mycoparasitic species relative to T. reesei or other ascomycetes, and are overrepresented in non-syntenic genome regions. A phylogenetic analysis shows that T. reesei and T. virens are derived relative to T. atroviride. The mycoparasitism-specific genes thus arose in a common Trichoderma ancestor but were subsequently lost in T. reesei. Conclusions The data offer a better understanding of mycoparasitism, and thus enforce the development of improved biocontrol strains for efficient and environmentally friendly protection of plants.

A.; Vaillancourt, Lisa J.; Souza, Elaine A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAnthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum is an important disease of common bean, resulting in major economic losses worldwide. Genetic diversity of the C. lindemuthianum population contributes to its ability to adapt rapidly to new sources of host resistance. The origin of this diversity is unknown, but sexual recombination, via the Glomerella teleomorph, is one possibility. This study tested the hypothesis that Glomerella strains that are frequently recovered from bean anthracnose lesions represent the teleomorph of C. lindemuthianum. A large collection of Glomerella isolates could be separated into two groups based on phylogenetic analysis, morphology, and pathogenicity to beans. Both groups were unrelated to C. lindemuthianum. One group clustered with the C. gloeosporioides species complex and produced mild symptoms on bean tissues. The other group, which belonged to a clade that included the cucurbit anthracnose pathogen C. magna, caused no symptoms. Individual ascospores recovered from Glomerella perithecia gave rise to either fertile (perithecial) or infertile (conidial) colonies. Some pairings of perithecial and conidial strains resulted in induced homothallism in the conidial partner, while others led to apparent heterothallic matings. Pairings involving two perithecial, or two conidial, colonies produced neither outcome. Conidia efficiently formed conidial anastomosis tubes (CATs), but ascospores never formed CATs. The Glomerella strains formed appressoria and hyphae on the plant surface, but did not penetrate or form infection structures within the tissues. Their behavior was similar whether the beans were susceptible or resistant to anthracnose. These same Glomerella strains produced thick intracellular hyphae, and eventually acervuli, if host cell death was induced.

But, two specimens with chasmothecia on the indigenous Senecio glossanthus did not agree with published descriptions of N. cumminsiana. The teleomorph of the S. glossanthus mildew differed from that of N. cumminsiana in the morphology of its peridial cells, the pigmentation of its appendages, and the morphology and pigmentation of some secondary hyphae. Ribosomal DNA ITS sequences from the two S. glossanthus mildew specimens and five other specimens of Senecio mildews from south-eastern Australia demonstrated that all Australian Senecio mildews are conspecific and distinct from the northern hemisphere Senecio mildew (N. cumminsiana) and from other Neoerysiphe taxa. Based on morphological characters and rDNA sequence data, the Australian Senecio mildew is described as a new species, Neoerysiphe kerribeeensis. This is the first native teleomorphic powdery mildew described from Australia. Copyright Â© 2010 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These fungal isolates were molecularly identified based on ITS sequnces and 28S sequences distributed to 12 genera, including Phoma, Chaetosphaeronema, Fusarium and Leptosphaeria, etc. Among them, the dominant genus was Phoma. Extracts of all strains were evaluated for anti-HIV-1 integrase activity by using soluable integrase expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The results showed that seven samples from five fungal endophytes PHY-24, PHY-38, PHY-40, PHY-51, PHY-53, which belonged to genus Chaetosphaeronema, inhibited strand transfer reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 integrase with IC50 values, of 6.60, 5.20, 2.86, 7.86, 4.47, 4.56 and 3.23 microg x mL(-1) respectively. In conclusion, the endophytic fungi of Phlomis younghusbandii Mukerjee are valuable for further screening anti-HIV-1 integrase agents.\n\nAecidium kalanchoe sp. nov., a new rust on Kalanchoe blossfeldiana (Crassulaceae).\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡dez, JosÃ© R; Aime, M Catherine; Newbry, Brad\n\n2004-07-01\n\nA rust fungus found on cultivars of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana (Crassulaceae) is described as a new species, Aecidium kalanchoe sp. nov., and compared to the other described rusts on members of the Crassulaceae.

Selected nonfertile isolates showed significant DNA relatedness (greater than 90%) to representatives of both mating types. Phenotypic physiological characteristics, such as cellobiose fermentation and rhamnose assimilation, proved insufficient for separation of Clavispora lusitaniae and Clavispora opuntiae.

Resistance of fungal infections has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. Here, we report the extracellular biosynthesis of Ag-NPs using a common fungus, Alternaria alternata. Also in this study, these nanoparticles were evaluated for their part in increasing the antifungal activity of fluconazole against Phoma glomerata, Phoma herbarum, Fusarium semitectum, Trichoderma sp., and Candida albicans. The antifungal activity of fluconazole was enhanced against the test fungi in the presence of Ag-NPs. Fluconazole in combination with Ag-NPs showed the maximum inhibition against C. albicans, which was confirmed from the increase in fold area of inhibition, followed by P. glomerata and Trichoderma sp., which showed less increase in the fold area, whereas no significant enhancement of activity was found against P. herbarum and F. semitectum. The antifungal activity of fluconazole was enhanced in presence of silver nanoparticles against the test fungi. Fluconazole in combination with Ag-NPs showed the maximum inhibition against C. albicans, followed by P. glomerata and Trichoderma sp.

L.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUsing cultivar resistance against pathogens is one of the most economical and environmentally friendly methods for control of crop diseases. However, cultivar resistance can be easily rendered ineffective due to changes in pathogen populations or environments. To test the hypothesis that combining R gene-mediated resistance and quantitative resistance (QR) in one cultivar can provide more effective resistance than use of either type of resistance on its own, effectiveness of resistance in eight oilseed rape (Brassica napus) cultivars with different R genes and/or QR against Leptosphaeria maculans (phoma stem canker) was investigated in 13 different environments/sites over three growing seasons (2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013). Cultivar Drakkar with no R genes and no QR was used as susceptible control and for sampling L. maculans populations. Isolates of L. maculans were obtained from the 13 sites in 2010/2011 to assess frequencies of avirulent alleles of different effector genes (AvrLm1, AvrLm4 or AvrLm7) corresponding to the resistance genes (Rlm1, Rlm4 or Rlm7) used in the field experiments. Results of field experiments showed that cultivars DK Cabernet (Rlm1 + QR) and Adriana (Rlm4 + QR) had significantly less severe phoma stem canker than cultivars Capitol (Rlm1) and Bilbao (Rlm4), respectively. Results of controlled environment experiments confirmed the presence of Rlm genes and/or QR in these four cultivars. Analysis of L. maculans populations from different sites showed that the mean frequencies of AvrLm1 (10%) and AvrLm4 (41%) were less than that of AvrLm7 (100%), suggesting that Rlm1 and Rlm4 gene-mediated resistances were partially rendered ineffective while Rlm7 resistance was still effective. Cultivar Excel (Rlm7 + QR) had less severe canker than cultivar Roxet (Rlm7), but the difference between them was not significant due to influence of the effective resistance gene Rlm7. For the two cultivars with only QR, Es-Astrid (QR) had less severe stem\n\nSporothrix brunneoviolacea and Sporothrix dimorphospora, two new members of the Ophiostoma stenoceras-Sporothrix schenckii complex.\n\nPubMed\n\nMadrid, H; GenÃ©, J; Cano, J; Silvera, C; Guarro, J\n\n2010-01-01\n\nSporothrix inflata is a saprobic member of the Ophiostoma stenoceras-Sporothrix schenckii species complex, reported mainly from soil. Ophiostoma bragantinum, an ascomycete described from Brazil, has been proposed as its possible teleomorph. Previous studies revealed that Sporothrix inflata is phenotypically and genetically variable, suggesting the existence of cryptic species. During a continued survey on the biodiversity of microfungi from different countries, seven isolates morphologically similar to S. inflata were obtained from soil samples collected in Spain and USA. In this study their phenotypic features and phylogenetic relationships were assessed. DNA sequence data of two nuclear loci revealed that these isolates correspond to two unnamed clades in S. inflata s.l., one of which also included the type strain of Humicola dimorphospora, a species that traditionally has been considered a synonym of S. inflata. These two groups are proposed herein as Sporothrix brunneoviolacea sp. nov. and Sporothrix dimorphospora comb. nov. S. brunneoviolacea is characterized phenotypically by the production of a diffusible violet-brown pigment in culture and mostly globose, pigmented, lateral blastoconidia. On the other hand S. dimorphospora lacks diffusible pigments and shows mostly subglobose to obovoid pigmented lateral blastoconidia. In contrast to the type strain of S. inflata S. brunneoviolacea and S. dimorphospora assimilate raffinose. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the proposed anamorph-teleomorph connection between S. inflata and O. bragantinum might not be correct.\n\n[Toxocara canis eggs as bait for soil fungus in a subtropical city].\n\nPubMed\n\nBojanich, MarÃ­a Viviana; Sarmiento, MarÃ­a Mercedes; Giusiano, Gustavo; Mangiaterra, Magdalena; Basualdo, Juan Ãngel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe use of different isolation techniques allows the recovery of fungi based on their ability to use selective substrates. The sprinkle method is a technique for the recovery of nematophagous fungi in the soil. These fungi are natural predators of nematodes and are widely distributed in nature. To detect possible fungi with nematophagous ability in the soil of city parks in Corrientes (Argentina). The soil samples were taken from an area of ground between two trees and to no more than 2cm deep. The isolation was performed according to the sprinkle method with Toxocara canis eggs as bait. Eighteen soil samples were collected, and 6 genera and 8 species of fungi were isolated. The sprinkle method, simple and efficient, has the advantage of using a small amount of untreated soil for the isolation of fungi that can grow on the eggs of geohelminths. The genera Bipolaris, Fusarium, Purpureocillium, Curvularia, Phoma and Scytalidium were isolated in this study. No other studies describing the interaction between the genera Curvularia, Phoma and Scytalidium with nematode eggs have been found in the literature, thus more studies are required to determine what is their real action on these eggs.

C.; Filipek, Matthew; Desai, Rushvi; Bickford, Wesley A.; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Clay, Keith\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground and aimsWe characterized fungal endophytes of seeds of invasive, non-native Phragmites from three sites in the Great Lakes region to determine if fungal symbiosis could contribute to invasiveness through their effects on seed germination and seedling growth.MethodsField-collected seeds were surface sterilized and plated on agar to culture endophytes for ITS sequencing. Prevalence of specific endophytes from germinated and non-germinated seeds, and from seedlings, was compared.ResultsOne-third of 740 seeds yielded endophyte isolates. Fifteen taxa were identified with Alternaria sp. representing 54% of all isolates followed by Phoma sp. (21%) and Penicillium corylophilum (12%). Overall germination of seeds producing an isolate (36%) was significantly higher than seeds not producing an isolate (20%). Penicillium in particular was strongly associated with increased germination of seeds from one site. Sixty-three isolates and 11 taxa were also obtained from 30 seedlings where Phoma, Penicillium and Alternaria respectively were most prevalent. There was a significant effect of isolating an endophyte from the seed on seedling growth.ConclusionsThese results suggest that many endophyte taxa are transmitted in seeds and can increase seed germination and seedling growth of invasive Phragmites. The role of fungal endophytes in host establishment, growth and invasiveness in nature requires further research.\n\nPhylogenetic Identification of Fungi Isolated from the Marine Sponge Tethya aurantium and Identification of Their Secondary Metabolites\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWiese, Jutta; Ohlendorf, Birgit; BlÃ¼mel, Martina; Schmaljohann, Rolf; Imhoff, Johannes F.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFungi associated with the marine sponge Tethya aurantium were isolated and identified by morphological criteria and phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. They were evaluated with regard to their secondary metabolite profiles. Among the 81 isolates which were characterized, members of 21 genera were identified. Some genera like Acremonium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Phoma, and Trichoderma are quite common, but we also isolated strains belonging to genera like Botryosphaeria, Epicoccum, Parasphaeosphaeria, and Tritirachium which have rarely been reported from sponges. Members affiliated to the genera Bartalinia and Volutella as well as to a presumably new Phoma species were first isolated from a sponge in this study. On the basis of their classification, strains were selected for analysis of their ability to produce natural products. In addition to a number of known compounds, several new natural products were identified. The scopularides and sorbifuranones have been described elsewhere. We have isolated four additional substances which have not been described so far. The new metabolite cillifuranone (1) was isolated from Penicillium chrysogenum strain LF066. The structure of cillifuranone (1) was elucidated based on 1D and 2D NMR analysis and turned out to be a previously postulated intermediate in sorbifuranone biosynthesis. Only minor antibiotic bioactivities of this compound were found so far.

Several species occur on mangoes, and these are identified mainly on the morphology of the anamorphs. Common taxa include Dothiorella dominicana, D. mangiferae (= Natrassia mangiferae), D. aromatica and an unidentified species, Dothiorella 'long'. The genus name Dothiorella, however, is acknowledged as a synonym of Diplodia. This study aimed to characterize and name the Botryosphaeria spp. associated with disease symptoms on mangoes. To achieve this isolates representing all four Dothiorella spp. mentioned above were compared with the anamorphs of known Botryosphaeria spp., based on conidial morphology and DNA sequence data. Two genomic regions were analyzed, namely the ITS rDNA and beta-tubulin regions. The morphological and molecular results confirmed that the fungi previously identified from mango as species of Dothiorella belong to Fusicoccum. Dothiorella dominicana isolates were identical to isolates of F. parvum (teleomorph = B. parva). A new epithet, namely F. mangiferum, is proposed for isolates previously treated as D. mangiferae or N. mangiferae. Isolates of D. aromatica were identified as F. aesculi (teleomorph = B. dothidea). A fourth Fusicoccum sp. also was identified as those isolates previously known as Dothiorella 'long'. A key is provided to distinguish these species based on anamorph morphology in culture. This study provides a basis for the identification of Botryosphaeria species from mango, which is important for disease control and to uphold quarantine regulations.\n\nDescription of Taphrina antarctica f.a. sp. nov., a new anamorphic ascomycetous yeast species associated with Antarctic endolithic microbial communities and transfer of four Lalaria species in the genus Taphrina.\n\nPubMed\n\nSelbmann, Laura; Turchetti, Benedetta; Yurkov, Andrey; Cecchini, Clarissa; Zucconi, Laura; Isola, Daniela; Buzzini, Pietro; Onofri, Silvano\n\n2014-07-01\n\nIn the framework of a large-scale rock sampling in Continental Antarctica, a number of yeasts have been isolated. Two strains that are unable to grow above 20 Â°C and that have low ITS sequence similarities with available data in the public domain were found. The D1/D2 LSU molecular phylogeny placed them in an isolated position in the genus Taphrina, supporting their affiliation to a not yet described species. Because the new species is able to grow in its anamorphic state only, the species Taphrina antarctica f.a. (forma asexualis) sp. nov. has been proposed to accommodate both strains (type strain DBVPG 5268(T), DSM 27485(T) and CBS 13532(T)). Lalaria and Taphrina species are dimorphic ascomycetes, where the anamorphic yeast represents the saprotrophic state and the teleomorph is the parasitic counterpart on plants. This is the first record for this genus in Antarctica; since plants are absent on the continent, we hypothesize that the fungus may have focused on the saprotrophic part of its life cycle to overcome the absence of its natural host and adapt environmental constrains. Following the new International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants (Melbourne Code 2011) the reorganization of Taphrina-Lalaria species in the teleomorphic genus Taphrina is proposed. We emend the diagnosis of the genus Taphrina to accommodate asexual saprobic states of these fungi. Taphrina antarctica was registered in MycoBank under MB 808028.\n\nThe Trichoderma harzianum demon: complex speciation history resulting in coexistence of hypothetical biological species, recent agamospecies and numerous relict lineages\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground The mitosporic fungus Trichoderma harzianum (Hypocrea, Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Hypocreaceae) is an ubiquitous species in the environment with some strains commercially exploited for the biological control of plant pathogenic fungi. Although T. harzianum is asexual (or anamorphic), its sexual stage (or teleomorph) has been described as Hypocrea lixii. Since recombination would be an important issue for the efficacy of an agent of the biological control in the field, we investigated the phylogenetic structure of the species. Results Using DNA sequence data from three unlinked loci for each of 93 strains collected worldwide, we detected a complex speciation process revealing overlapping reproductively isolated biological species, recent agamospecies and numerous relict lineages with unresolved phylogenetic positions. Genealogical concordance and recombination analyses confirm the existence of two genetically isolated agamospecies including T. harzianum sensu stricto and two hypothetical holomorphic species related to but different from H. lixii. The exact phylogenetic position of the majority of strains was not resolved and therefore attributed to a diverse network of recombining strains conventionally called 'pseudoharzianum matrix'. Since H. lixii and T. harzianum are evidently genetically isolated, the anamorph - teleomorph combination comprising H. lixii/T. harzianum in one holomorph must be rejected in favor of two separate species. Conclusions Our data illustrate a complex speciation within H. lixii - T. harzianum species group, which is based on coexistence and interaction of organisms with different evolutionary histories and on the absence of strict genetic borders between them.

The oil-bearing seeds exhibited rich fungal diversity. High Shannon-Index H' was observed with pongamia seeds (2.847) while a low Index occurred for coconut kernel-associated mycoflora (1.018). Maximum Colonization Frequency (%) was observed for Lasiodiplodia theobromae (176). Dominance Index (expressed in terms of the Simpson's Index D) was high (0.581) for coconut kernel-associated fungi, and low for pongamia seed-borne fungi. Species Richness (Chao) of the fungal isolates was high (47.09) in the case of neem seeds, and low (16.6) for peanut seeds. All 1279 fungal isolates were screened for lipolytic activity employing a zymogram method using Tween-20 in agar. Forty isolates showed strong lipolytic activity, and were morphologically identified as belonging to 19 taxa (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chalaropsis, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Drechslera, Fusarium, Lasiodiplodia, Mucor, Penicillium, Pestalotiopsis, Phoma, Phomopsis, Phyllosticta, Rhizopus, Sclerotinia, Stachybotrys and Trichoderma). These isolates also exhibited amylolytic, proteolytic and cellulolytic activities. Five fungal isolates (Aspergillus niger, Chalaropsis thielavioides, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Phoma glomerata) exhibited highest lipase activities, and the best producer was Lasiodiplodia theobromae (108Â U/mL), which was characterized by genomic sequence analysis of the ITS region of 18S rDNA.\n\nNon-Gaussian Methods for Causal Structure Learning.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimizu, Shohei\n\n2018-05-22\n\nCausal structure learning is one of the most exciting new topics in the fields of machine learning and statistics. In many empirical sciences including prevention science, the causal mechanisms underlying various phenomena need to be studied. Nevertheless, in many cases, classical methods for causal structure learning are not capable of estimating the causal structure of variables. This is because it explicitly or implicitly assumes Gaussianity of data and typically utilizes only the covariance structure. In many applications, however, non-Gaussian data are often obtained, which means that more information may be contained in the data distribution than the covariance matrix is capable of containing. Thus, many new methods have recently been proposed for using the non-Gaussian structure of data and inferring the causal structure of variables. This paper introduces prevention scientists to such causal structure learning methods, particularly those based on the linear, non-Gaussian, acyclic model known as LiNGAM. These non-Gaussian data analysis tools can fully estimate the underlying causal structures of variables under assumptions even in the presence of unobserved common causes. This feature is in contrast to other approaches. A simulated example is also provided.\n\nAcremonium phylogenetic overview and revision of Gliomastix, Sarocladium, and Trichothecium\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSummerbell, R.C.; Gueidan, C.; Schroers, H-J.; de Hoog, G.S.; Starink, M.; Rosete, Y.

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that within the Hypocreales, there are two major clusters containing multiple Acremonium species. One clade contains Acremonium sclerotigenum, the genus Emericellopsis, and the genus Geosmithia as prominent elements. The second clade contains the genera Gliomastix sensu stricto and Bionectria. In addition, there are numerous smaller clades plus two multi-species clades, one containing Acremonium strictum and the type species of the genus Sarocladium, and, as seen in the combined SSU/LSU analysis, one associated subclade containing Acremonium breve and related species plus Acremonium curvulum and related species. This sequence information allows the revision of three genera. Gliomastix is revived for five species, G. murorum, G. polychroma, G. tumulicola, G. roseogrisea, and G. masseei. Sarocladium is extended to include all members of the phylogenetically distinct A. strictum clade including the medically important A. kiliense and the protective maize endophyte A. zeae. Also included in Sarocladium are members of the phylogenetically delimited Acremonium bacillisporum clade, closely linked to the A. strictum clade. The genus Trichothecium is revised following the principles of unitary nomenclature based on the oldest valid anamorph or teleomorph name, and new combinations are made in Trichothecium for the tightly interrelated Acremonium crotocinigenum, Spicellum roseum, and teleomorph Leucosphaerina indica.

Its anamorph, T. viride, the type species of Trichoderma, is re-described and epitypified. Eidamia viridescens is combined as Trichoderma viridescens and is recognised as one of the most morphologically and phylogenetically similar relatives of T. viride. Its teleomorph is newly described as Hypocrea viridescens. Contrary to frequent citations of H. rufa and T. viride in the literature, this species is relatively rare. Although both T. viride and T. viridescens have a wide geographic distribution, their greatest genetic diversity appears to be in Europe and North America. Hypocrea vinosa is characterised and its anamorph, T. vinosum sp. nov., is described. Conidia of T. vinosum are subglobose and warted. The new species T. gamsii is proposed. It shares eidamia-like morphology of conidiophores with T. viridescens, but it has smooth, ellipsoidal conidia that have the longest L/W ratio that we have seen in Trichoderma. Trichoderma scalesiae, an endophyte of trunks of Scalesia pedunculata in the Galapagos Islands, is described as new. It only produces conidia on a low-nutrient agar to which filter paper has been added. Additional phylogenetically distinct clades are recognised and provisionally delimited from the species here described. Trichoderma neokoningii, a T. koningii-like species, is described from a collection made in Peru on a fruit of Theobroma cacao infected with Moniliophthora roreri.

Susceptibility to amphotericin B was 100%, fluconazole 90%, itraconazole 40%, ketoconazole 88%, 5-flucytosine 98% and voriconazole 98%.\n\nAn endophytic fungus isolated from finger millet (Eleusine coracana) produces anti-fungal natural products\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMousa, Walaa K.; Schwan, Adrian; Davidson, Jeffrey; Strange, Philip; Liu, Huaizhi; Zhou, Ting; Auzanneau, France-Isabelle; Raizada, Manish N.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nFinger millet is an ancient African cereal crop, domesticated 7000 years ago in Ethiopia, reaching India at 3000 BC. Finger millet is reported to be resistant to various fungal pathogens including Fusarium sp. We hypothesized that finger millet may host beneficial endophytes (plant-colonizing microbes) that contribute to the antifungal activity. Here we report the first isolation of endophyte(s) from finger millet. Five distinct fungal species were isolated from roots and predicted taxonomically based on 18S rDNA sequencing. Extracts from three putative endophytes inhibited growth of F. graminearum and three other pathogenic Fusarium species. The most potent anti-Fusarium strain (WF4, predicted to be a Phoma sp.) was confirmed to behave as an endophyte using pathogenicity and confocal microscopy experiments. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the WF4 extract identified four anti-fungal compounds, viridicatol, tenuazonic acid, alternariol, and alternariol monomethyl ether. All the purified compounds caused dramatic breakage of F. graminearum hyphae in vitro. These compounds have not previously been reported to have anti-Fusarium activity. None of the compounds, except for tenuazonic acid, have previously been reported to be produced by Phoma. We conclude that the ancient, disease-tolerant crop, finger millet, is a novel source of endophytic anti-fungal natural products. This paper suggests the value of the crops grown by subsistence farmers as sources of endophytes and their natural products. Application of these natural chemicals to solve real world problems will require further validation.

As many as 18 anamorph genera have been associated with Botryosphaeria, most of which have been reduced to synonymy under Diplodia (conidia mostly ovoid, pigmented, thick-walled), or Fusicoccum (conidia mostly fusoid, hyaline, thin-walled). However, there are numerous conidial anamorphs having morphological characteristics intermediate between Diplodia and Fusicoccum, and there are several records of species outside the Botryosphaeriaceae that have anamorphs apparently typical of Botryosphaeria s.str. Recent studies have also linked Botryosphaeria to species with pigmented, septate ascospores, and Dothiorella anamorphs, or Fusicoccum anamorphs with Dichomera synanamorphs. The aim of this study was to employ DNA sequence data of the 28S rDNA to resolve apparent lineages within the Botryosphaeriaceae. From these data, 12 clades are recognised. Two of these lineages clustered outside the Botryosphaeriaceae, namely Diplodia-like anamorphs occurring on maize, which are best accommodated in Stenocarpella (Diaporthales), as well as an unresolved clade including species of Camarosporium/Microdiplodia. We recognise 10 lineages within the Botryosphaeriaceae, including an unresolved clade (Diplodia/Lasiodiplodia/Tiarosporella), Botryosphaeria s.str. (Fusicoccum anamorphs), Macrophomina, Neoscytalidium gen. nov., Dothidotthia (Dothiorella anamorphs), Neofusicoccum gen. nov. (Botryosphaeria-like teleomorphs, Dichomera-like synanamorphs), Pseudofusicoccum gen. nov., Saccharata (Fusicoccum- and Diplodia-like synanamorphs), âBotryosphaeriaâ quercuum (Diplodia-like anamorph), and Guignardia (Phyllosticta anamorphs). Separate teleomorph and anamorph names are not provided for newly introduced genera, even where both morphs are known. The taxonomy of some clades and isolates (e.g. B. mamane) remains unresolved due to the absence of ex\n\nImmunomodulatory Polyketides from a Phoma-like Fungus Isolated from a Soft Coral.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Yi-Zhe; KurtÃ¡n, Tibor; MÃ¡ndi, Attila; Tang, Hua; Chou, Yalan; Soong, Keryea; Su, Li; Sun, Peng; Zhuang, Chun-Lin; Zhang, Wen\n\n2017-11-22\n\nFourteen new polyketides with a trans-fused decalin ring system, libertalides A-N (3-16), together with two known analogues, aspermytin A and its acetate (1, 2), were isolated from the fermentation extract of a coral-derived Libertasomyces sp. fungus. Their relative configurations were elucidated on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configurations were determined by TDDFT-ECD and optical rotation (OR) calculations. The OR of 1 and 2 were found to have opposite signs in CH 3 CN and CHCl 3 , which was in agreement with the OR calculations producing alternating signs for the optical rotation depending on the applied conditions. Because the signs of the OR for 1 and 2 showed high solvent dependence, they may not be used alone to correlate the absolute configurations. Compound 16 displayed structural novelty characterized by an Î±-enol ether bridge conjugated with an aldehyde group. In in vitro immunomodulatory screening, compounds 1, 4, and 10 significantly induced the proliferation of CD3 + T cells, while compounds 2, 7, 11, and 14 significantly increased the CD4 + /CD8 + ratio at 3 Î¼M. A preliminary structure-activity analysis revealed a crucial role of Î 7 and"
