        "text": "TAXONOMY\n\nIn this paper, a polyphasic approach was taken and species are discussed and/or described with consideration to the following factors:\n\nPhylogenetic analyses: Based on the clustering and support in the Bayesian tree obtained from the combined ITS, TEF, ACT, CAL and HIS alignment ( ). All genes were also assessed individually (data not shown; discussed where applicable in the species notes).\n\nMorphological characteristics: A few morphological characteristics effectively distinguished species ( ). These are: conidiophores (uniform, irregular, attenuated, truncate, long or short obconically truncate), conidiogenous cells (terminal, intercalary), loci (apical, lateral, circumspersed (all around the conidiogenous cell; Hennebert & Sutton 1994); uni-local (single, terminal locus), multi-local (multiple loci); thickness, absence of protuberant loci), and conidia (dimensions, shape, hilum morphology).\n\nA diagnostic characteristic of species with wide host ranges was circumspersed loci on tenuous conidiophores, whereas the species with narrow host ranges had a few distinct apical or lateral loci on moderately thick-walled to thick-walled conidiophores. These characteristics were preserved, even when the fungus was cultivated on agar medium.\n\nThe Bayesian analysis resulted in 73 species clades mapped onto the phylogenetic tree ( ); 34 of these were assigned to an existing species name, 15 more were morphologically similar to existing species but names could not be applied without doubt (indicated with “cf.” in the species name, see species notes below), a further 19 could not be named unequivocally (“Cercospora spp. A-S”) and novel species are introduced below for the remaining five clades.\n\nCercospora achyranthis Syd. & P. Syd., Ann. Mycol. 7: 171. 1909.\n\nCaespituli amphigenous, mainly hypophyllous. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or composed of a few brown cells, intraepiderimal or substomatal. Conidiophores thick-walled, dark brown, arising from internal hyphae or a few brown cells, solitary, or in loose fascicles (2-5), straight, sinuous to distinctly geniculate, flexuous, almost uniform in width, somewhat wider at the apex, often constricted at septa and proliferating point, conical at the apex, simple, sometimes branched, 31-340 × 4.5-6 μm, 2-20-septate. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, proliferating sympodially, multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened, slightly to distinctly protuberant, apical or formed on shoulders caused by geniculation, 2-3 μm diam. Conidia solitary, subhyaline, acicular, cylindrical to cylindro-obclavate, straight to slightly curved, long obconically truncated and thickened at the base, obtuse at the apex, rarely constricted at the septa, 33-172 × 3.5-8 μm, 3-20-septate.\n\nSpecimens examined: South Korea, Jeju, on Achyranthes japonica (Amaranthaceae), 14 Sep. 2002, H.D. Shin, CBS H-20983, CPC 10088-10091; on A. japonica, 13 Nov. 2003, H.D. Shin, CBS H-20984, CBS 132613 =CPC 10879, CPC 10880-10881.\n\nNotes: This species is characterised by conidiophores with a thickened, dark brown wall, vary in shape, often constricted at septa, and conical at the apex, sometimes branched, and longer than in most other species (31-340 × 4.5-6 μm, 2-20-septate). The conidia of C. achyranthis are not hyaline, but subhyaline to pale olivaceous and have rather small hila (ca. 2 μm wide), which are reminiscent of the genus Passalora. Nevertheless, it is a true Cercospora. Cercospora achyranthis is supported by ACT. The TEF and CAL phylogenies fail to discriminate C. sojina (also with subhyaline conidia and small hila) from C. achyranthis. On the HIS phylogeny, it is indistinguishable from C. polygonaceae, to which it is also a sister taxon in the combined tree ( part 2). The name C. achyranthis is based on Japanese material, and fresh collections from Japan would be required to designate an epitype for this taxon.\n\nCercospora agavicola Ayala-Escobar, Mycotaxon 93: 117. 2005.\n\nSpecimen examined: Mexico, State of Guanajuato, Penjamo, on Agave tequilana var. azul (Agavaceae), Jan. 2003, V. Ayala-Escobar and Ma. de Jesús Yáñez-Morales, holotype CHAPA # 166, isotype HAL 1839 F, culture ex-type CBS 117292 =CPC 11774.\n\nNotes: Cercospora agavicola is characterised by large stromata and consistently cylindrical conidia, often with swollen tips (Ayala-Escobar et al. 2005). In this study using a larger dataset, it is also clear that C. agavicola, which is supported by TEF, ACT, CAL and HIS regions, is genetically distinct from the other Cercospora species studied. In the combined tree ( part 1), it is a sister taxon to C. cf. coreopsidis.\n\nCercospora alchemillicola U. Braun & C.F. Hill, Mycol. Progr. 1: 19. 2002.\n\nSpecimens examined: New Zealand, Auckland, Western Springs Gardens, on Alchemilla mollis (Rosaceae), 23 Jul. 2000, C.F. Hill, Lynfield 236 (holotype HAL, isotype PDD 73031); on A. mollis, C.F. Hill, Lynfield 564, epitype designated here CBS H-20985, culture ex-epitype CPC 5259.\n\nNotes: Sequences from New Zealand on hosts of Onagraceae (Gaura, isolate CPC 5127, and Oenothera, isolate CPC 5126) are slightly distinct from that derived from Alchemilla (Rosaceae). The collections on Onagraceae (C. cf. alchemillicola) are also morphologically different from C. alchemillicola, and represent an undescribed species. The three isolates are identical to one another on the TEF, ACT, CAL and HIS phylogenies but also to some other species, e.g. to Cercospora sp. I, C. cf. physalidis and C. celosiae based on the TEF phylogeny, and Cercospora sp. I and C. cf. physalidis based on the ACT phylogeny. A similar mix is observed in the HIS phylogeny with Cercospora sp. I and C. celosiae and in the CAL phylogeny with Cercospora spp. M, O, P, Q and C. cf. sigesbeckiae. In the combined tree ( part 4), the three isolates represent sister taxa."
