        "text": "HOSTS\n\nSwiss Chard\n\nLettuce\n\nSpinach\n\nBeets\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nCercospora leaf spot is caused by the fungus Cercosporabeticola. It most commonly affects beets but can also infect lettuce, spinach, and weeds that can act as alternative hosts.\n\nBIOLOGY\n\nCercospota beticola can be introduced to an area through infected seeds, contaminated plant debris, or weeds. The fungi overwinters in infected plant debris, and when the weather warms, release spores to infect new hosts.\n\nA spore enters through the plantâ€™s stomata when it reaches a host. Once within the host, the fungus will rapidly reproduce, colonizing the inner tissue. C. beticola will release toxins that destroy host cells, causing foliar lesions. At the center of the lesions, the fungus will develop spore-producing bodies, called pseudostromata. These spores will spread the disease short distances using wind and splashing water.\n\nThe spread and development of C. beticola is heavily impacted by temperature and humidity. Warm day and night temperatures, high humidity, or wet leaves are optimal conditions for disease development.\n\nSYMPTOMS\n\nSmall, tan circular lesions with brown or purple borders\n\nLesions will merge together over time, impacting large sections of foliage\n\nLesions first appear on older leaves before progressing to newer growth\n\nBlack dots in the center of lesions, visible with a hand lens (X10)\n\nYellowing or wilting foliage\n\nGENERAL MANAGEMENT\n\nUse certified disease-free seeds\n\nRotate crops with non-susceptible crops\n\nAvoid watering practices, such as overhead irrigation, that result in wet soil and foliage for prolonged periods\n\nRemove weeds and volunteer plants that can serve as alternative hosts for the disease"
