        "text": "Species of Passalora s. lat. are eminent phytopathogenic fungi that cause generally leaf spot diseases on a broad variety of plants throughout the world. During our investigations exploring cercosporoid fungi associated with leaf spot symptoms of fruit and forest trees in northern and north-western Iran, several passalora-like infections were isolated from symptomatic leaves of different trees belonging to the Fabaceae , Malvaceae , Rosaceae and Ulmaceae . A polyphasic taxonomic approach by applying molecular data, morphological features and host data, was employed to identify the isolates. In a multi-gene phylogenetic analysis (LSU, ITS and RPB2 ), these isolates clustered in four clades in the Mycosphaerellaceae . The revealed taxa encompass Paracercosporidium microsorum on Tilia platyphyllos , Prathigadoides gleditsiae-caspicae gen. et. sp. nov. on Gleditsia caspica , Pruniphilomyces circumscissus on Prunus avium and Prunus cerasus , and Sirosporium celtidis on Celtis australis. The new genus Prathigadoides and its type species Prathigadoides gleditsiae-caspicae are molecularly distinct from all phylogenetically related genera, and some characteristics of the conidiophores and conidia differs from those of the morphologically similar species Prathigada condensata on the North America Gleditsia triacanthos .\n\nSpecies of Passalora s. lat. are phytopathogenic fungi that generally cause leaf spot diseases on a broad variety of plants throughout the world.

During our investigation of fungi associated with leaf spot diseases in northern and northwestern Iran, several Septoria isolates were recovered from symptomatic leaves on different herbaceous and woody plants in the Asteraceae, Betulaceae, and Salicaceae families. These isolates were studied by applying a polyphasic approach including morphological and cultural data and a multigene phylogeny using a combined data set of partial sequences of the 28S nuc rRNA gene (large subunit [28S]), internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nuc rRNA gene (ITS) of the nuc rDNA operon, actin (actA), translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1), calmodulin (cmdA), β-tubulin (tub2), and DNA-directed RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2). Four novel species are proposed, namely, Septoria eclipticola on Eclipta prostrata, Septoria firouraghina on Cirsium arvense, Septoria guilanensis on Populus deltoides, and Septoria taleshana on Alnus subcordata. All species are illustrated, and their morphology and phylogenetic relationships with other Septoria species are discussed.\n\nCercosporoid fungi or Cercospora s. lat. belonging to Mycosphaerellaceae, comprising many important plant pathogens, causing generally leaf spots on a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants. In recent years, molecular studies have clarified multiple genera of cercosporoid fungi being poly- and paraphyletic. Among these genera, the genus Cercospora has always been supposed as monophyletic taxon. During the course of the present study, two isolates of cercosporoid fungi morphologically resembling species of the genus Cercospora were recovered from Bishop's flower (Ammi majus L.). However, a subsequent phylogenetic study based on partial gene sequences of the LSU, ITS, ACT, TEF1-α and HIS loci, elucidated these isolates to represent an undescribed genus, cluster in a clade in Mycosphaerellaceae, apart from Cercospora s. str. Consequently, we introduce the new genus and species, Neocercospora ammicola to accommodate the taxon occurring on A. majus. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the sole reliance on morphological features for delineating of cercosporoid fungi, are not only insufficient at species level, but also at genus level.\n\nIn recent years, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plants in the north of Iran exhibit symptoms resembling Cercospora leaf spot (CLS) disease. This study was initiated to elucidate the taxonomy and pathogenicity of cercosporoid taxa associated with leaf spot diseases of these two legume crops in Iran. A total of 138 samples with CLS symptoms were collected from cultivated bean species in the north of Iran and subjected to microscopic examination, resulting in a total of 98 Cercospora and 59 Pseudocercospora samples. A six‐locus phylogenetic analysis (ITS, actA, tef1, gapdh, his3 and cmdA) coupled with morphology of 42 representative isolates revealed that several cercosporoid fungi occur on common bean and cowpea in Iran. Five Cercospora species including C. iranica, C. cf. flagellaris, Cercospora sp. G, Cercospora sp. T, and C. vignigena, and two Pseudocercospora species including P. griseola f. griseola and P. cf. cruenta were found associated with legume crops in Iran; of these, C. cf. flagellaris was the dominant species, occurring on both common bean and cowpea. Pathogenicity tests confirmed that all seven species could infect leaves of common bean and/or cowpea. This is the first report of C. iranica, Cercospora sp. G and Cercospora sp. T associated with common bean and/or cowpea in the world. In addition, C. vignigena is recorded for the first time in Iran. Results achieved in this study will assist the management strategies of the CLS disease of common bean and cowpea."
