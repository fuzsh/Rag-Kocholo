WSLR-LP is an innovative, listener-supported, non-profit, non-commercial FM radio station dedicated to serving the Sarasota community.

WSLR features locally produced programming and events that offer cultural, artistic, and political perspectives currently underrepresented in the media. Our goal is to inform and empower listeners to play an active role in WSLR and in their community.

WSLR’s programming promotes equality, peace, sustainability, democracy, and social and economic justice.

We have over 100 community volunteers programming at the station. Many of our programmers are low-income, currently unemployed, and in danger of losing their homes. A number of radio programs serve the interests of traditionally underserved communities in our area, including “Newtown and Beyond”, “Recovery Radio” and “Perspectives”. We offer opportunities to ex-felons and those who need community service hours to satisfy their parole requirements. We strive to reach out to poor and homeless populations to give them a voice in their community. WSLR covers stories that other local news outlets do not. We have participated in the Homelessness Marathon for the past three years putting homeless people on the air to tell their stories. We also partner with All Faiths Food Bank to collect canned goods for hungry families.
