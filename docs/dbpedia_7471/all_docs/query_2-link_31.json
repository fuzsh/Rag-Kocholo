        "text": "Greetings LinkedIn Family, My name is Yoleidy Rosario-Hernandez, and I am the Founder and President of Mosaic Justice. With over 15 years of experience as an interdisciplinary artist, educator, and diversity consultant, I have dedicated my career to advancing justice and equity in both educational and organizational settings. Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege of working with diverse communities and institutions, helping them navigate complex social justice issues through innovative DEI strategies. My approach is deeply informed by JEDAII principles (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Accessibility, Inclusion, and Interconnection), integrating critical discourse and arts education to foster meaningful change. I am passionate about collaborating with organizations to enhance their DEI initiatives and create inclusive environments. Whether you're seeking a dynamic speaker, a facilitator for transformative workshops, or strategic guidance for organizational development, I am eager to discuss how my expertise can support your goals.

Warm regards, Yoleidy Rosario-Hernandez\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!!! Hello everyone! I hope you're having a wonderful day. I wanted to share some exciting news with you - Mosaic Movements is participating in the Giving Challenge! This 24-hour event allows people to donate and support local nonprofits, like ours. As many of you know, I founded Mosaic Movements, an arts organization dedicated to promoting diversity and empowerment through various artistic expressions. Our goal for the Giving Challenge is to raise $5,000 to sustain and enrich the arts in our community. Your contribution would greatly support our mission, and I would be truly grateful if you would consider donating. Additionally, thanks to The Patterson Foundation, donations between $25-$100 are matched, and some generous donors are tripling their contributions! You can donate through this link: https://lnkd.in/eDrJfjVN Let's come together and make a difference through the power of the arts! Thank you for your support.\n\nFortuitously, I had the privilege of capturing captivating portraits at the Leonard Reid House, a historical gem with a rich past. Originally situated in the Rosemary District, this single-story frame vernacular-style house, dating back to 1926, holds significant historical value. Named after Leonard Reid, an esteemed early pioneer who played a crucial role in establishing Sarasota's first Black community, Overtown (now known as the Rosemary District), the house boasts a locally historic designation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In a noteworthy move, the Leonard Reid House found a new home at 2529 N. Orange Ave. in Newtown, a city-owned property. This relocation marks a pivotal moment in Sarasota's history, as the house now serves as the inaugural location for the Sarasota African American Art Center and History Museum. The Sarasota City Commission, recognizing its cultural significance, unanimously approved a lease agreement with the Sarasota African American Cultural Coalition. This agreement allows the Leonard Reid House to be utilized as a cultural arts center, hosting lectures, programs, and exhibits that celebrate the rich African American heritage embedded in the city's roots. As an interdisciplinary artist and photographer capturing these historic moments, it was a unique experience blending artistry with history. The intersection of visual storytelling and cultural heritage was particularly compelling, uniting the past and present through the lens. #CapturingMoments #LeonardReidHouse #Photography #Photographer # #HistoricPreservation #PhotographyMagic #CulturalHeritage #MemorableMoments #PortraitPerfection #HistoricSites #SarasotaHistory #SRQ #Newtown #Overtown #RosemaryDistrict #HistoricSitesSnapshot #ArtfulHistory #SarasotaHistory #CaptureTheLegacy #LensCulture #Storytelling #PlaceNarratives"
