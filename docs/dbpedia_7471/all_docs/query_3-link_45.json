        "text": "[Nonprofit News] Q&A with Earl Young, President and CEO of Booker Promise Foundation\n\nBarbie Heit, barbie.heit@srqme.com\n\nBooker Promise Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering Booker High School students with essential skills and resources for post-secondary success, has named Earl Young as its new president and CEO. With over 15 years of experience in the nonprofit sector, Young brings valuable expertise to lead the Foundation's mission of providing students with the essential skills and resources needed for postsecondary success. This week, Young took some time to talk with us about his new role.\n\nWhat has inspired your deep dedication to education?\n\nAs a first-generation college student, I understand the challenges and obstacles that can arise when coming from a background where higher education is not the norm. Growing up with parents who were both factory workers, and at times being raised by a single mother who had limited educational opportunities, I witnessed firsthand the determination and hard work required to overcome such circumstances. My mother's story, immigrating from Mexico with an eighth-grade education and working tirelessly to provide for me, serves as a constant reminder of the transformative power of education. I've personally experienced the way education can shift the trajectory of one's life, opening doors to opportunities and perspectives that were once unimaginable to me.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to accomplishing in your new role?\n\nThe opportunity to foster meaningful connections with our donors and the community as we work together to break down the unique barriers that Booker High School students overcome on their journey toward post-secondary success. I am looking forward to leveraging the strength of our partnerships, engaging our donors, and mobilizing the community to join forces in helping students reach their full potential. One of my primary goals is to provide students with the tools and resources to determine their own path, discover their unique potential, envision their future, and set ambitious objectives for their lives.\n\nWhat are some of the greatest obstacles to success you see young people facing and how do you think they can overcome these challenges?\n\nSome of the greatest obstacles to success, especially for limited-resource, first-generation students, include a multitude of distractions, a lack of clear guidance, and the struggle to define their true selves amid the constant noise and influences of the world. The modern landscape is filled with numerous distractions, from social media and technology to the fast-paced nature of today's society which can divert their focus and hinder their ability to stay on a path toward success. Deciphering who they truly are and determining their authentic aspirations can become a real challenge for young individuals, and the process of self-discovery can be particularly daunting amidst the constant bombardment of societal expectations and peer pressures. Ultimately, creating a network of reliable mentors and resources, combined with fostering self-awareness and resilience, can empower young people to overcome these obstacles and chart a path to success amidst the challenges of the modern world.\n\nTell us what drives your philanthropic spirit?\n\nFrom the outset of my career as an AmeriCorps VISTA, serving with the Community Foundation of Sarasota County, I was provided with a remarkable opportunity to embark on my philanthropic journey and begin believing in myself. The leaders at the Foundation took a chance on me, a recent college graduate without significant corporate or philanthropic experience, and believed in my potential. Their trust in my abilities and their recognition of the value I could bring to the organization were incredibly empowering. As I reflect on the support and opportunities I've received, I am driven by a strong desire to \"pay it forward.\" I am committed to extending that same hand to others, working to give them a fighting chance to rewrite their own stories and realize their full potential.I can personally attest to the impact of these principles. The people who supported me were instrumental in helping me get to where I am today.\n\nPictured: Earl Young, Booker Promise president and CEO.\n\n[New Hire] Child Protection Center Welcomes Capital Campaign Manager\n\nThe Child Protection Center, Inc. (CPC) has announced the appointment of Elizabeth K. Topp as the Capital Campaign Manager for the nonprofit’s ongoing expansion on their Campus of Healing. The Child Protection Center, which was established in 1980, provides essential services in the prevention, intervention, and treatment of child abuse in both Sarasota and DeSoto Counties. In the years since its inception, CPC has expanded its staff and services to better meet the needs of the children and families within the community. However, the demand for child abuse services has continued to steadily increase, an issue exacerbated by a population growth of over 200% since 2000 in North Port alone. To meet these rising needs, CPC closed on a new building and property in North Port in December of 2021- the Campus of Healing, which started services in its existing building in early 2022. Elizabeth joined the organization as it launched the next phase of expansion- breaking ground on a new 6,000 sq. ft. building on the Campus of Healing. “I grew up in North Port,” says Elizabeth. “I have seen the growth firsthand and understand the need for CPC’s Campus of Healing serving South County.” This endeavor is financially supported in part by a three-million-dollar federal grant thanks to the leadership and support of Congressman Greg Steube. Elizabeth is bringing 12 years of nonprofit fundraising experience to her new role with campaigns ranging from $2,500 into seven figures. Members of the community can support the campaign via a naming opportunity, purchasing a dedicated walkway brick, joining the Champions for Children Circle, or a general donation.\n\nTo learn more, visit\n\n[Board of Directors] All Star Children's Foundation Welcomes Karen A. Holbrook to its Board of Directors\n\nAll Star Children’s Foundation has welcomed Karen A. Holbrook, PhD., to its board of directors. Dr. Holbrook is the regional chancellor at the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee campus (USFSM). A noted scientist, administrator, corporate director and strategic planner, Dr. Holbrook brings a wealth of expertise, including a longstanding connection with the Sarasota-Manatee community. Graci McGillicuddy, chair of the board, said: “Dr Holbrook brings an exceptional\n\nlevel of knowledge, skill and experience to the Board of All Star that will significantly enhance our ability to transform the foster care system through innovation, science and compassion. I am so deeply grateful to her for her commitment to our most vulnerable children and their families.” Dr. Holbrook served as president of the Ohio State University from 2002-2007 and has served in leadership positions at the University of Georgia (provost and academic vice president), the University of Florida (vice president for research and dean of the graduate school), and the University of Washington School of Medicine (associate dean for research and professor of biological structure and medicine). Before serving in her current position as regional chancellor at USFSM, Dr. Holbrook was the executive vice president and senior advisor to the interim regional chancellor at USFSM. She also spent a year as the interim president for Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.\n\n[Grant] Sixteen Hands Horse Sanctuary Awarded $10,000 Grant\n\nTucked away off of State Road 64 in Hardee County is a hidden gem, Sixteen Hands Horse Sanctuary. It is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to rescuing unwanted, abused, and neglected horses and burros. Founded in 2007 by Robin Cain, Sixteen Hands started out as a sanctuary where horses with no other option could come to heal mentally, emotionally, and physically. It is a safe place where they can go and live out their lives. There are 33 horses presently residing on the property. In 2019, Sixteen Hands established an adoption program for the horses who have graduated from the sanctuary’s services to find their forever home. The program enables the sanctuary to rescue more horses over time. It is a very special year for Sixteen Hands as it celebrates its sixteenth anniversary on September 27th. Thanks to the generous grant from the Community Foundation of Sarasota County, Sixteen Hands can now expand its efforts to raise awareness of the organization and its capabilities. It relies strictly on donations and volunteers. This year Sixteen Hands is looking to expand its services to more horses than ever. Those funds granted allow for a variety of events and initiatives, such as the following: A newly enhanced website, an investment of time and efforts into optimizing the sanctuary’s social media platforms, an open house celebration on Saturday, September 30th, 2023 for the 16th anniversary, Club 16: individuals can gift Sixteen Hands $16 on the 16th day of each month, custom merchandise for volunteers and to support the organization, such as t-shirts, December matching challenge where any donation will be matched throughout the whole month of December, preparation for the 2024 Giving Challenge: each donation $25-$100 will be matched by The Patterson Foundation, which has partnered with the Community Foundation to strengthen giving over the past eight challenges. If you would like to get involved, please visit sixteenhandshorsesanctuary.org. There you will find ways to donate and volunteer.\n\n[Arts & Entertainment] Suncoast Black Arts Collaborative Welcomes Two New Team Members\n\nThe Suncoast Black Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that uses the unifying power of the arts to nurture inclusion and diversity across the regional arts and cultural landscape, welcomes two new team members. Sharon Preston-Folta will serve as program manager for SBAC’s Arts and Racial Justice Discovery Series, and Jaiden Johnson is the new community outreach manager for the Syllabus of Color of Color initiative. Michéle Des Verney Redwine, the founder and executive director of the Suncoast Black Arts Collaborative, says she’s delighted to welcome Preston-Folta and Johnson. “Each brings a strong work ethic, passion for our mission, and a longstanding commitment to community. We look forward to the innovative approaches they will bring to SBAC.” Jaiden Johnson is a vision-driven, market-savvy professional with a keen eye for detail and a passion for streamlining processes and identifying efficiencies. Johnson previously served as director of development and communications for the United Way South Sarasota County, and as special events manager and community outreach/marketing manager for the Suncoast Humane Society. She is also the founder and designer of Social Serenity, a bespoke branding and marketing agency, andgraduated with a BS in organizational leadership from Southeastern University in 2021. As the community outreach manager for SBAC’s three-year Syllabus of Color initiative, Johnson will work in concert with area nonprofits, community centers, schools and institutions of higher learning to engage middle and high school students of color to become more involved in arts education initiatives and opportunities. “Advocates have long established the power of the arts in education,” says Johnson. “Art is critical to a young person’s personal and educational development. But data shows that area-based Black and Latino students are less likely to be consistently involved in arts activities and instruction than their white counterparts—and that’s something we hope to change.” Sharon Preston-Folta has spent a 40-plus-year career in advertising sales and marketing, predominantly as an account executive in radio. She’s worked with such companies as Fairchild Publications and WLNY TV in Long Island, and ABC/Disney and CBS Radio and Emmis Communications in New York City. She recently retired as a senior account executive with WUSF Public Media in Tampa. Preston-Folta’s memoir, “Living in The Shadow of my Father, Louis Daniel Armstrong,” made public the private family life of Louis Armstrong, Lucille “Sweets” Preston, his mistress for 21 years, and their child, Sharon. She’s also the executive producer and narrator of the Emmy Award- winning documentary, “Little Satchmo,” based on her memoir. Preston-Folta received her AA from Westchester Community College and BA in Communication Arts from Iona College. She also earned two degrees from the Institute of Culinary Education. Preston- Folta is a volunteer programmer at WSLR 96.5 LP FM in Sarasota and a member of the Suncoast Women of Action. The Arts and Racial Justice Discovery Series brings artists, arts and civic leaders together for courageous conversations about inclusion and diversity in the arts.\n\nTo learn more, visit\n\n[Fundraising Event] New College of Florida Foundation Announces Elizabeth Moore and Don Patterson as Co-Chairs for the 44th Annual Clambake, Soiree on the Bay\n\nNew College of Florida (NCF) will celebrate its 44th annual Clambake fundraising event Soiree on the Bay, hosted by the New College of Florida Foundation on Thursday, November 2, at 6 p.m. Local philanthropists Elizabeth Moore and Don Patterson are co-chairing the event. Held on NCF’s scenic bayfront campus in Sarasota, the Clambake will raise money to support three new master’s degree programs slated to launch in 2024. Moore has been a civic activist notably in environmental initiatives such as Mote Marine Aquarium and Research, Conservation Foundation of the Gulf Coast, Lemur Conservation Foundation, Tree Foundation, Southface Institute, Climate Adaptation Center, Gulf Shellfish Institute and, recently, Roger Williams College President’s Taskforce on the Blue Economy. She owns Triangle Ranch in Myakka, Florida, and is also a member of the Manatee County Cattlemen’s Association. In addition to hosting many community events at her ranch, she also runs an Airbnb to showcase her “Florida Cracker” cottages and land conservation initiative. In 2021, Elizabeth was featured as “The Woman Who Wants to Save Florida” in Sarasota Magazine. An avid tennis fan, Moore is the title sponsor of the Elizabeth Moore Sarasota Open. Patterson spent 40 years in the communications industry, culminating in his role as co-founder and CEO of Ascend Wireless Networks, taking the business from startup to acquisition by a private equity firm in less than 10 years. Passionate about helping the underserved, Don has held numerous high-level roles with Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Suncoast. He led the creation of “Stay Safe” in partnership with the Salvation Army, an initiative that serves as an emergency alternative for women victims of abuse as a result of being homeless. He was invited to attend the first conference by the Department of Justice to address the emerging Human Trafficking crisis, and “Stay Safe” continues to work in Sarasota to this day. As a community leader, he funded the creation of the “Thursday Night Market” in the Rosemary District, reviving traffic flow to businesses in the area post-pandemic. He is also an accomplished Marathoner and Ironman. NCF recently revealed plans to add three new master’s degree programs, including the nation’s first Master’s of Marine Mammal Science. This new research-intensive program will be complemented by the establishment of the Florida Institute of Marine Mammal Science (FIMMS). Additionally, NCF will establish programs to offer a Master’s of Environmental Economics and a Master’s of Educational Leadership. Funds raised will support the necessary financial aid for student recruitment, faculty hiring, and facility improvements that will launch these programs successfully.

Monda Gallery for Contemporary Art. Her artwork first and foremost encourages us to indulge in the pleasures of looking and discovering anew the details of the visual world. Her artistic practice is grounded in appropriating, recycling, and manipulating imagery. The work reminds us of the image world that inundates our daily existence. Our experience of reality is mediated through a barrage of photographic digital images that supplants our connection to the natural world. Yet, Bieber is less interested in a critique of this condition than she is in offering her work as an antidote, a way to inspire viewers and reconnect with our shared sense of wonder. Included with museum admission.
