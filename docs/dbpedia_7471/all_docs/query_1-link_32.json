View the library schedule here.\n\nThe Cracker Fair is the culmination of the Lemon Bay Fest, a week of celebrating Englewood’s history produced by the 2 Englewood libraries. The Fair is also a fund-raiser for our community programs and our mission to preserve the fascinating history of the Lemon Bay area.\n\nWe are pleased to present the following line-up of live entertainment on the new Dignam Family Stage at Pioneer Plaza:\n\nA unique experience will be on hand when James Hawkins performs songs about our rich local history.\n\n“I am a singer/songwriter from Venice, Florida. For about 10 years I have knocked around the Florida Folk scene performing in many different venues from coffee houses to a couple of concert halls.\n\n“Some folks have described my music as a mix of Woody Guthrie and Harry Chapin but I leave that judgment up to you. I have a new radio called “Acoustic Waves” on WSLR 96.5.” James’ major project is called “Turn Back Time” which deals with Florida History through stories and songs and brings traditional Folk music and stories to the classroom.\n\nGottfried Creek is Bob Kinsley and Bill Keehne who hail from Ohio and Michigan and bring to us an eclectic mix of folk, bluegrass and 60s and 70 rock. They have performed at the Englewood Farmers Market, Lemon Bay Park and the Englewood Museum.\n\nThe name Gottfried Creek comes from pioneer settlers Otto and Ferdinand Gottfried who arrived here from Milwaukee in 1893 and lived in a palmetto shack located where New Comfort Road now intersects S.R. 776. Nearby they planted two acres of pineapples, cabbages and potatoes. Other family members soon joined them and circa 1900 they built a fine 2-story house on the creek that today bears their name.\n\nGet ready to lift your spirits and travel back to the good old days. John Tuff & Friends started out over ten years ago. They performed all over Southwest Florida in a variety of venues featuring classic country music: music of legends, such as Johnny Cash, Hank Snow, Ernest Tubb, George Jones, Johnny Horton, and more, the kind of music many of us grew up with on the family radio.\n\nWe are pleased to have the wonderful talent of John Tuff and Friends return this year.\n\nEstablished in 2020 Vinyl Recall is a three piece Eclectic Classic Rock band.\n\nPaul Quinn has played guitar and sung for a number of years, and lives locally after having spent time in other states. Of necessity, he blends rhythm and lead playing, and tends to use his fingers, rather than a pick, for a different sound.\n\nJeff Dillon is a native Floridian and born in Venice. Jeff has been involved in the Performing Arts for 50 years. Drumming since his teens, he plays in a broad set of styles. He is pleased to be working with John, Paul, and Vinyl Recall.\n\nJohn Munn has lived in Englewood since 2016. Love of music started early in this one in choirs and musical theatre. He picked up bass at age 13. He created Groovin’ In The Gallery open mic in 2018 at the Englewood Art Center that ran for a year and a half. Vinyl Recall is his first band and only band, so far.\n\nRecall has played at Pop’s Sunset Grill, Tomahawk Tiki Bar @ CoolToday Park, Englewood Moose, Englewood Eagles Club, Englewood VFW, The Back Yard, Libby’s Sports Bar and Grill, Rumours Wine Bar, AllStar Bar and Grill, Salty Jim’s Bar and Grill. We are pleased to feature Vinyl Recall at this year’s CRACKER FAIR.\n\nSPONSORS:\n\nKey AgencyJeff Joyce ASB Dog Trainer Michael J.

She will be representing People for Trees, a grass-roots effort that began in 1997 and grew into a 501©3 non-profit organization and is celebrating 25 years of promoting the many benefits of trees.\n\nThese include providing oxygen, shade, noise and light buffers, controlling storm water runoff, and soil erosion and cooling our ever increasing temperatures since the presence of trees can reduce outside temperatures by as much as 15 degrees.\n\nSamantha Gentrup is a local teacher and environmental advocate. She is originally from Ohio, but moved to Florida in 2015 because of her love of wildlife and water.\n\nWhen SWFL experienced the red tide ecological crisis in 2018, Samantha co-led a statewide demonstration in which close to 10,000 people simultaneously stood in solidarity from coast to coast in an event called Hands Along the Water in order to bring awareness to Florida’s failing ecosystems.\n\nHands Along the Water continued as a grassroots movement to engage local communities in education and outreach in order to promote reverence and respect for Florida’s most valuable resource: ecosystems.\n\nSamantha enjoys teaching her students about environmental protection and empowering her students to make a difference.\n\nIn her free time, she enjoys gardening, kayaking, paddle boarding, sand volleyball, and her dogs and cats (all rescues).\n\nShe has converted her lawn to a butterfly garden that is over seventy percent native plants and hosts numerous species of butterflies and birds as well as bees, rabbits, and more.\n\nOver the course of 25 years, People for Trees has continually provided opportunities for people to interact with and embrace the natural world with events such as the annual Tree Fair since 1999 and the annual Tour de North Port bicycle ride since 2012, kayak outings and hikes featuring “The Hidden Jewel of North Port”, the Myakkahatchee Creek, and providing educational “Florida-friendly Yard” workshops.\n\nJoin us Tuesday, October 4 at 7pm at the Historic Green Street Church, 510 Indiana Ave., Englewood.

She owned Rhoda’s Swimwear for 30 years.\n\nWe asked her how she became an Aquamaid:\n\n”When I was 16, I was invited to spend a week at Beautiful Cypress Gardens to see if I was photogenic and had any Water skiing abilities (I had learned to ski on Lake Dora in Mt. Dora, Fl. Where I attended school.) I was asked to come back and work there after high school, but went on to the University of Florida. I eventually agreed to accept the position of water skier and model at Cypress Gardens.\n\n“I married their head photographer, Trammell Pickett and moved to Sarasota and then Englewood.\n\n“I have two wonderful sons who never left Englewood (Tram Pickett (co-owner of Berlin Sign Co) and Travis Pickett (Owner of Native Charters in Englewood). I have 4 grandchildren and 3 great grands.”\n\nRhoda appeared along with Esther Williams in the 1953 film “Easy To Love.”\n\nJoin us Tuesday, April 26 at 7pm at the Historic Green Street Church, 510 Indiana Ave., Englewood.\n\nAll are invited.\n\nAdmission is FREE but your tax-deductible contributions are always greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\nAbout Cypress Gardens:\n\nWhen Dick Pope Sr. opened his Cypress Gardens in 1936, the park in Winter Haven became Florida’s first large-scale tourist attraction. Pope turned marshland into a garden showplace for 8,000 varieties of plants and trees. By 1943, Cypress Gardens became known as the water ski capital of the world, attracting Hollywood stars and providing the setting for many movies. Cypress Gardens closed in 2009, becoming Legoland Florida Resort. Cypress Gardens remains as part of the attraction."
