        "text": "The historic flooding in Sarasota County put our plumbing to the test. The stormwater system, that is. The county's plumber-in-chief is Spencer Anderson. WSLR reporter Mark Warriner had a chance to interview the public works director.Â More plumbing: The City of Sarasota has been the poster boy of good behavior when it comes to wastewater treatment. But two weeks ago, that advanced treatment plant spilled close to 18 million gallons during Tropical Storm Debby. We have the story.Â Staying with the City of Sarasota: Three key figures in the city government just announced their resignations. Ramon Lopez reports.Â Finally: Three professors teaching at Florida universities sued the state legislature over what they say is overreach into the public higher education system. A Sarasota group and a New College teacher are playing key roles in that lawsuit, as Florence Fahringer reports.\n\nThe historic flooding in Sarasota County last week put the spotlight on neighborhoods with homes knee-deep under water.Â Ramon Lopez pays close attention to one community where the water barely reached the doorsteps. Even though those experiences were less traumatic, the challenges arising even from them look daunting.Â Then: The questions and outrage prompted by the Sarasota flood coincide with the primary elections next week. We have a close look at the political ripples of the disaster.Â Â Next: More elections: Florence Fahringer reports from the last candidate forum before voters pick the next commissioner in the City of Sarasota's majority minority district.Â Finally: Staying with the elections - one of the highest-profile school board races in the nation could be decided next week in Sarasota. We have a close look at the three candidates.Â\n\nRingling College of Arts is an engine of the Culture Coast. But that engine has been sputtering lately, and that has to do with the Culture Wars emanating from Tallahassee. Florence Fahringer had a conversation with the president of that college.Â Â Then: When flooding happens, the first thought is about people and their homes. But cars are another big casualty, as Tyler Oldano reports.Â Next: The re-developer of a 63-year old mall in Sarasota convinced city commissioners that more than 10% attainable housing is not feasible in that project. That, in turn, raises questions about the private sector's ability to make a dent in the affordable housing crisis.Â Finally: Dr. Nik's bikes are not scrap! When a long-time friend of the recently passed Sarasota artist spotted his iconic bikes on a scrap metal trailer, she - and the WSLR community - jumped into action. We have that story.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Debby. Our Johannes Werner tells you the stories of residents experiencing rising waters just outside of Philippi Creek.Â Then: A former Sarasota Commissioner talks about the countyâs development plan. Our report tells you whatâs going wrong, and how it even plays into the damage caused by Hurricane Debby.Â Â Next:Â We give you an Update on the 6 New College Students whoâre potentially facing punishment for their support of Palestine during graduation. WSLRâs Florence Fahringer spoke to one of the students about what the last few months have looked like for them.Finally: Our Johannes Werner Spoke to Bacardi Jackson, the new executive director of the ACLU in Florida. She tells us whatâs next for the civil rights organization in the state.\n\nTheÂ public hospital board is hotly contested electoral terrain, as \"Medical Freedom\" activists are trying to gain control of Sarasota Memorial Hospital in these upcoming elections. In the middle of all this, one of four Democratic candidates passed away last week. Ramon Lopez looked at the ripple effects.Â Next: Plans for a new Performing Arts Center are creeping forward, and it could become the most expensive project in the history of the City of Sarasota. The city is on the hook for half of the cost, and that has some people worried, as Tyler Oldano reports.Â Then: It is rare in this area that Democrats are battling each other in primary elections. That's the case in the race for U.S. House, where two Democrats are vying to challenge Republican incumbent Greg Steube.\n\nAt a rally this weekend at Robarts Arena, the Sarasota Republican Party chief expelled two Republicans - one candidate, and one activist. Ramon Lopez has that story.Â Next: Mike Moran has raised his profile as a defunder of childcare programs, an emergency helpline, public housing, and arts organizations, and by professing to be a good steward of taxpayer money. Now, an investigative report revealed that as the head of a state agency, he oversaw $36,000 in spending on entertainment, meals and travel in just 18 months.Â Â Then: Book bans and new state rules for history classes have caused controversy and anxiety. A state association of history teachers met in Sarasota this weekend, and we were there to watch and listen.Â Finally: Dark money is paying for mudslinging against political candidates. Those PACs and their contributors are hard to track, but one local researcher is doing her best to drag them to the light. Mark Warriner has her story."
