        "text": "County in Florida, United States\n\nU.S. county in Florida\n\nSarasota County is a county located in Southwest Florida. At the 2020 US census, the population was 434,006.[2] Its county seat is Sarasota[3] and its largest city is North Port. Sarasota County is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, FL metropolitan statistical area.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Sarasota, Florida\n\nThe area that is now known as Sarasota County has been inhabited by humans for some 10,000 years. Evidence of human remains as well as a burned out log at the Warm Mineral Springs, in North Port, were discovered that date to the early Archaic period.[4]\n\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts, the origin of the name \"Sarasota\" is unknown. In the early twentieth-century, a fanciful story was created to go hand-in-hand with a pageant held in Sarasota. The story held that the town was named after the daughter of famous explorer Hernando de Soto's daughter Sara.[5]\n\nAn early map of the area from 1763 shows the word \"Zarazote\" across present day Sarasota.[6]\n\nFollowing exploration, the area was occupied by fishing camps, called ranchos.[7] In 1842, the Armed Occupation Act was passed, which deeded land to settlers who were willing to cultivate land in Florida. The act brought settlers to Sarasota but also led to the Second Seminole War.[8][9] During the war, the area was occupied by the U.S. army and Fort Armistead was built.[10]\n\nSarasota County was created in 1921 from the southern part of Manatee County. After acquisition by the United States as a territory, the area now included in Sarasota county had been part of St. Johns County (1821), Alachua County (1824), Hillsborough County (1834), and Manatee County (1855) as new counties were created from older counties to accommodate population growth and settlement in new areas.[11]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 725 square miles (1,880 km2), of which 556 square miles (1,440 km2) is land and 169 square miles (440 km2) (23.4%) is water.[12]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nManatee County – north\n\nDeSoto County – east\n\nCharlotte County – south\n\nParks and preserves\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSarasota County has a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate, with hot, humid summers and warm, drier winters. The high temperatures and high humidity in the summer regularly push the heat index over 100 °F (38 °C). There are distinct rainy and dry seasons, with the rainy season lasting from March to November and the dry season from December to February.\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nSarasota County is one of only 20 Florida counties with its own charter, adopted in 1971. Sarasota County is governed by a five-member county commission. Each commissioner serves a four-year term and resides in and represents a single district.[15]\n\nLike most of Southwest Florida, Sarasota County has been a stronghold for the Republican Party. It was one of the first parts of Florida to begin to favor the Republicans over the Democrats. The last Democratic presidential candidate to carry the county was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. The closest any Democratic candidate has come since was Barack Obama in 2008, who lost in the county by just 211 votes.[16] The Republican edge has narrowed somewhat since the 1990s, however; Democrats have managed at least 40 percent of the vote in every election since 1996.\n\nRepublicans have historically dominated the county commission and all but two countywide elected positions. Democratic strength is concentrated in Sarasota, which has an all-Democratic city commission.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Sarasota County, Florida[17] Year Republican Democratic Third party(ies) No. % No. % No. % 2020 148,370 54.71% 120,110 44.29% 2,689 0.99% 2016 124,438 53.79% 97,870 42.30% 9,045 3.91% 2012 110,504 53.14% 95,119 45.74% 2,338 1.12% 2008 102,897 49.47% 102,686 49.37% 2,422 1.16% 2004 104,692 53.51% 88,442 45.20% 2,518 1.29% 2000 83,117 51.63% 72,869 45.27% 4,991 3.10% 1996 69,213 46.46% 63,665 42.73% 16,108 10.81% 1992 66,855 42.76% 54,552 34.89% 34,945 22.35% 1988 84,602 66.40% 42,099 33.04% 708 0.56% 1984 87,771 74.15% 30,525 25.79% 69 0.06% 1980 68,065 68.57% 25,621 25.81% 5,579 5.62% 1976 44,157 61.78% 26,293 36.78% 1,028 1.44% 1972 48,939 79.95% 12,235 19.99% 36 0.06% 1968 30,160 63.73% 10,127 21.40% 7,041 14.88% 1964 21,917 61.13% 13,937 38.87% 0 0.00% 1960 19,995 70.70% 8,287 29.30% 0 0.00% 1956 13,937 73.40% 5,052 26.60% 0 0.00% 1952 9,538 70.74% 3,945 29.26% 0 0.00% 1948 3,559 49.95% 2,302 32.31% 1,264 17.74% 1944 2,109 37.99% 3,443 62.01% 0 0.00% 1940 1,672 30.71% 3,773 69.29% 0 0.00% 1936 1,055 30.38% 2,418 69.62% 0 0.00% 1932 667 25.86% 1,912 74.14% 0 0.00% 1928 1,603 56.46% 1,181 41.60% 55 1.94% 1924 187 40.48% 204 44.16% 71 15.37%\n\nPublic safety\n\n[edit]\n\nAside from the typical law enforcement and fire departments, Sarasota County also utilizes an Emergency Management agency. The agency's main area of focus is disaster preparedness and response. The agency is responsible for what are called Community Emergency Response Teams as well as the county emergency evacuation shelters.[18]\n\nFire/EMS\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sarasota County Fire Department (SCFD) provides fire services to the City of Sarasota and all unincorporated areas of the county with the exception of areas covered by the Nokomis and Englewood fire districts. Additionally, SCFD provides EMS service to the City of Sarasota, all unincorporated areas of the county (including areas covered by the Nokomis and Englewood fire districts) plus the city of Venice.[19]\n\nLaw enforcement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Sarasota County Sheriff's Office (SSO) is the county's primary law enforcement agency. It is responsible for patrolling the unincorporated areas of the county along with operating the county's jail and providing courtroom security. SSO also operates the county's primary 911 center. The cities of Sarasota, North Port, and Venice along with the Town of Longboat Key each have their own police departments. The Florida Highway Patrol is responsible for patrolling FDOT maintained roads in the county (Florida State Highway System) and investigating motor vehicle accidents that occur in unincorporated areas.[20]\n\nThree specialist law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the county: the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport Police Department,[21] the New College/USF Sarasota-Manatee Campus Police Department,[22] the Seminole Gulf Railway (SGLR) Police Department[23] and the Sarasota County Schools Police Department.[24] Each agency, except for the SCS Police Department, has jurisdiction in neighboring Manatee County as well, as each agency's properties extend into that county.\n\nVoter registration\n\n[edit]\n\nAll voter information is since July 14, 2023 and provided by Florida Department of Elections:[25]\n\nParty statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nParty Registered Voters Percentage Republican 156,746 44.01% Democratic 99,398 27.91% No party affiliation 92,723 26.03% Minor parties 7,299 2.05% Total Voters 356,166 100.00%\n\nGovernment officials\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Senate\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Senator Party Class 3 Senator Marco Rubio Republican Class 1 Senator Rick Scott Republican\n\nUnited States House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Representative Party Florida's 17th Congressional District Greg Steube Republican\n\nFlorida State Senate\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Senator Party 23 Joe Gruters Republican\n\nFlorida House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Representative Party 73 Fiona McFarland Republican 74 James Buchanan Republican 75 Michael Grant Republican\n\nSarasota County Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Board of County Commissioners include the following:[26]\n\nPosition Incumbent District 1 Michael Moran District 2 Mark Smith District 3 Neil Rainford District 4 Joe Neunder District 5 Ron Cutsinger\n\nSarasota County School Board\n\n[edit]\n\nThe School Board members include the following:<[27]\n\nPosition Incumbent District 1 Bridget Ziegler District 2 Karen Rose District 3 Tom Edwards District 4 Robyn A.
