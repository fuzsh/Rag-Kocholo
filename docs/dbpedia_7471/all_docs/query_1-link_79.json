        "text": "\"Don't you dis-respect Ronnie James like that... You fucked it up\" said the drunk man as he pushed the microphone into my face nearly chipping one of my bottom teeth. In a high pitched metal falsetto scream I called the guy out and suggested: \"next time you sing it brother.\" and added “Ronnie James Dio, rest in peace.” I did screw up the end but I started off strong with Dio's \"Holy Diver\" at Rain dogs’ (a bar in the 5 Points area of Jacksonville, Florida) karaoke night. I paid five bucks to support a metal band called Cringe from Ohio who was playing in the back. Cringe was tight so I purchased a split cassette they were selling. Their side is titled MEMENTO MORI and includes three songs: \"Searing Sin\", \"Tribulation\", and \"Flesh Famine\". Crypt Rot fills the other side of the tape with a two song offering entitled NOCTURNAL DETERIORATION including \"Butchered Slumber\" and \"Serpentine Atonement\". Perhaps when my ears stop ringing I'll listen to the cassette. I missed the three opening bands as I was eating nachos, smoking a joint, and singing Peter Tosh's \"Legalize It.\"\n\nEarlier from 6 to 8:30 PM I played 12 string acoustic guitar and sang for mostly elderly women in a model home in some sort of gated golf community in Fernandina Beach. I heard that their husbands were all drinking scotch and playing putt putt. For some reason I decided to film the process of my dog Chaka and I driving to Earth Fare to fill our 5 gallon BPA free water container, purchase Kombucha's, and fuel up the Prius. The entire process took 55 minutes, and I later deleted the footage.\n\nSwimming in a pool, walking along the freshly eroded gulf coast in Lido Key. At 1 AM Rob Demperio, Jen Sandwich, and myself all left WSLR in Sarasota, Florida. Rob was kind enough to invite us to partake in his radio show Lumpytunes! Definitely Difficult Listening 420 edition. The show airs every Tuesday evening from 11 PM til 1 AM and has for the last ten years. He talked to us about the experimental/noise scene in Florida and spun the live sets of Hal McGee, Fiver's Stereo, Dylan Houser, and Tom Miller from the Apartment Music 28 CD. The performances were recorded onto a type II chrome cassette at Hal McGee's apartment on March 24, 2018. I was happy to introduce Rob to the music of Ahleuchatistas from Asheville, North Carolina and had a blast hanging out during his radio show. Listen to Lumpytunes from 4/17/2018 at the WSLR archive link. Editor's Note: on the WLSR Archive page, SEARCH for \"Lumpytunes\".\n\nNarrow Carolina coastline\n\nEroding into the Atlantic\n\nWinds shift and sand stings the skin\n\nThe state released rattlesnakes to kill the rabbits\n\nDisplaced coyotes now roam the streets during the off season\n\nIt was the state who turned them loose\n\nAlong with the acid rain in the 1980s\n\nShortly after the dye plant killed off most of the Herring population\n\nThey now charge one hundred dollars per fish\n\nTo protect the environment in their wallets and purses\n\nThey ask why the building is not the proper distance from the road\n\nWhen it was them who paved the error long after the fishery was built\n\nThey ask who gave permission to pile sand on the marshy ground\n\nWhen it was they who put it there to clear the road after a major storm\n\nThe transplanted diamond backs remain protected\n\nWho is really endangered by their stealthy presence?\n\nThe devil's pocket book stinks\n\nAs do the rotting Portuguese man 'o war tentacles\n\nBut not nearly as bad as the bureaucrats and tax collectors\n\n- Jay Peele"
