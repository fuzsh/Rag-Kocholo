        "text": "In response to COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home orders, WSLR Community Radio has added some new cultural and educational programming to their lineup. The Asolo Rep and the Sarasota Opera are both producing ½ hour shows for the radio station to help keep their supporters engaged. A syndicated children’s program has been added to the Sunday schedule. The station has also stepped up its local news and public affairs programming to make sure people have the information they need to stay engaged and make informed decisions. WSLR welcomes community feedback on all of its programming. Listeners can email the station management at info@wslr.org or call 941-894-6469.\n\nEngage: On Air – Wednesdays at 6pm\n\nEngage: On Air is 30 minutes of Asolo Rep like you've never heard it before. Listen to the artists responsible for making the theatre you love as they discuss their creation process. Hear brand new content created for a radio audience and stay up to date on all the fantastic work going on throughout the year. Hosted by Associate Artistic Director Celine Rosenthal, the program will feature weekly guests from the staff of Asolo Rep as well as the world class artists they work with. Our Audit-orium has room for everyone!\n\nAt Home with Sarasota Opera – Alternating Wednesdays at 6pm\n\nExecutive Director Richard Russell and Artistic Director Victor DeRenzi will share some insights and updates about Sarasota Opera. They’ll also discuss their favorite art form and entertain you with some of the things that make it special.\n\nThe Children’s Hour – Sunday at 4pm\n\nThe Children’s Hour is produced by a New Mexico based non-profit organization which believes children are entitled to broadcast media that is educational, entertaining and engaging, and also includes their participation in its creation. Kids deserve a voice in broadcasting, and The Children’s Hour is the only program in the entire nation that allows kids to be full participants in live radio, and that involves kids in all aspects of the show’s production. The program themes focus on four areas: STEM education, civics, cultural education and performance. Each week listeners hear educational programming that’s also engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe Beat Goes On – Tuesdays at 9am\n\nWSLR Managers Arlene Sweeting and David Beaton host this informal talk show and converse with community members about how they are dealing with the social distancing, economic challenges, stress and other issues that are part of the Covid-19 crisis. They also give updates about what is happening in our community and around the state.\n\nHeadline News\n\nWSLR is now airing locally-focused Headline News daily at the following times: 9am, 1pm, 4pm and 7pm.\n\nWSLR has been broadcasting non-commercial, locally-produced programming in Sarasota for 15 years. All of the community programmers on the air at WSLR are volunteers. The WSLR studios are currently shut down, but programmers are still producing their shows remotely and you can still hear all the music and talk shows you’ve come to appreciate. WSLR is a low power community radio station. If you are within the broadcast range (7-10 mile radius from Downtown Sarasota) you can listen to the station at 96.5FM. In West Bradenton you can listen on WBPV-LP 100.1. The station also livestreams from their website at WSLR.org and has mobile apps for both Android and I-Phones available."
