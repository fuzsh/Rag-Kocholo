She seemed to be having a religious experience. Now I know why”\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nUIC Pavilion, Chicago, IL\n\nApril 10, 1987\n\nUltra Matrix SBD > Cassette Master (TDK MA-R90)\n\nAll Transfers and Mastering By Charlie Miller\n\nDisc 1 – Set 1:\n\n1. tuning\n\n2. Shakedown Street\n\n3. Little Red Rooster\n\n4. Candyman\n\n5. Me And My Uncle >\n\n6. Mexicali Blues\n\n7. Brown Eyed Women\n\n8. Cassidy >\n\n9. Don’t Ease Me In\n\nSet 2:\n\n10. tuning\n\n11. Iko Iko >\n\n12. Looks Like Rain\n\nDisc 2 – Set 2 cont’d.:\n\n1. Box Of Rain >\n\n2. He’s Gone >\n\n3. Drums >\n\n4. Space >\n\n5. The Other One >\n\n6. Black Peter >\n\n7. Around And Around >\n\n8. Turn On Your Lovelight\n\nEncore:\n\n9. encore break\n\n10. It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue\n\nREVIEW: dig it\n\nsounds great….\n\nREVIEW: Chi Town Dead\n\nWooo! Amazing performance and quality for the ’87 revival period for Grateful Dead. Jerry has\n\nnew life in him and he’s peeling away on Tiger. Right out the gate w/ a smoking Shakedown.\n\nThese three nights have some really good highlights.\n\nREVIEW: Billy and Mick\n\nThe finest Rooster ever? not my favorite song, but by far my favorite version. the band is\n\nSSSSmoking,tight interplay and extended jamming in the standards. After a couple of doozies\n\nthe crowd is going wild and phil redirects the applause to the drummers …….. “Billy and Mick”\n\nREVIEW: Yes It Was An Amazing Night!\n\nThe set list does not begin to capture this very memorable night. This brought me back to the\n\nDead, after a few years of thinking the band had lost it, which, during some shows in the\n\nmid-80s, was clearly true. A great night!\n\nREVIEW: excellent show\n\nthis rips start to finish with an amazing lovelight and great encore of baby blue this is easily one\n\nof the best of 1987.and yes this is without a doubt the best rooster ever.\n\nREVIEW: Smile, Smile, Smile\n\nI remember Jerry seeming very happy, animated and somewhat footloose during this, my first\n\nshow at the age of 16. 21 years ago? How is that possible? I think I am still there as the first\n\nchords of Shakedown rearrange my synapses. Leaving the quaint UIC Pavillion that evening,\n\ncovered in afterbirth, I was changed for good. . . and I mean good.\n\nREVIEW: One of the Great Underrated Shows\n\nA cooker from start to finish, including the best version of Looks Like Rain ever performed. I\n\nwas there, loved it when it was going on, and think it still stands the test of time today. Don’t let\n\nthis one slip past your radar.\n\nREVIEW: –\n\nFirst set starts sounding a bit rushed, but the band soon warms up to the pace they set for themselves; by\n\nMexicali, the jamming is really getting interesting. The He’s Gone & Other One are smokin’, and Black Peter is\n\nvery good…instrumentally. The boys are not singing that well: always rough, the harmonies are even more harsh\n\nand discordant than usual. Overall, a standard rather than great show.\n\n“Today’s Dead Tomorrow”, Upcoming Gig Events\n\nAs always, verify with the venue…\n\nRemember, folks, to call the venue to see if they are indeed open in the\n\nfirst place, and the event is going on as scheduled, and what protocols are in place.\n\nDead Set Florida:\n\nBig Top Brewing Company, Fri., Apr. 14th, 7:00 – 10:00 p.m.\n\n975 Cattlemen Road, Sarasota, 371-2939\n\nKettle Of Fish:\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar, Wed., Apr. 12th, 7:00 – 11:00 p.m.\n\n5238 Ocean Blvd, Sarasota, 346-5443\n\n“Music in The Park Series”:\n\nBradenton Mosaic Amphitheater, Fri., Apr. 14th, 6:00 – 8:00 p.m.\n\n452 3rd Ave. W., Bradenton, 621-6471\n\nStottlemyer’s Smokehouse, Sun., Apr. 16th, 4:00 – 7:00 p.m.\n\n19 East Rd., Sarasota, 312-5969\n\nDana Lawrence:\n\nCaptain Curt’s, Wed., Apr. 12th, 12:00 – 4:00 p.m.\n\n1200 Old Stickney Point Rd., Sarasota, 349-3885\n\n“Acoustic Solo Series”:\n\nRingling By The Bay, Wed., Apr. 12th, 6:00 – 9:00 p.m.\n\n5401 Bayshore Rd., Sarasota, 941-359-5700\n\nSiesta Key Oyster Bar, Thurs., Apr. 13th, 2:00 – 6:00 p.m.\n\n5238 Ocean Blvd, Sarasota, 346-5443\n\nSchmitz Brothers Band:\n\nLinger Lodge, Sat., Apr. 15th, 6:00 – 9:00 p.m.\n\n7205 85th St. Ct.
