She seemed to be having a religious experience. Now I know why”\n\nWSLR’s Fall ‘22 On-Air Membership Drive!\n\nFrom Wednesday, October 19th, through Tuesday, October 25th, WSLR 96.5 LPFM\n\nSarasota is holding our Fall ‘20 On-Air Membership Drive. We only come to you, the\n\nlistener and supporter, two weeks a year to ask you to keep us up and running for\n\nanother six months, and that much of those two weeks is still plenty of music. My\n\nshow is Monday, October 24th, and since our upcoming Annual “Very Merry Jerry\n\nDay”, on November 6th will be featuring not one but two trios, I have in the studio\n\nwith me tonight one of the featured players, Turner Moore, mandolinist/vocalist for\n\nThe Ship Of Fools, as well as The Ship Of Fools Trio, and now the same for this\n\nyear’s VMJD hybrid trio, with Alan Gilman of Uncle John’s Band, and Michael\n\nPandiscio from Dead Set Florida, along with the greater Florida area group, The Joint\n\nChiefs.\n\nEven though we now have returned to our pre-Covid membership drive practices, with\n\npeople in the station as need be, it is far easier to go to www.wslr.org to safely and\n\nsecurely donate online. Alternatively, you can call 941-894-6469 and speak directly\n\nwith a phone answerer.\n\nOne does not need to donate to a specific show; one can split one’s support amongst\n\nseveral. One does not need to be listening, either, to pledge; one simply goes to\n\nwww.wslr.org and clicks on the “Donate” button that is set up.\n\nAnd many thanx for your continuing support!
