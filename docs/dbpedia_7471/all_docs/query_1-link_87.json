Its 2020 population was 434,006.[1] Its county seat is Sarasota and its largest city is North Port.[2] Sarasota County is a part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota Metropolitan Statistical Area and along with Manatee County and other counties to the north is often considered part of the Tampa Bay Area.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSarasota County was created in 1921. After acquisition by the United States as a territory and once Florida obtained state status, the area now included in the county had been governed by Hillsborough County, then Manatee County as the state was divided into smaller and smaller governmental organization. Manatee County was carved up to allow the creation of three more counties as well.\n\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts the origin of the name, Sarasota, is unknown. It may be named for a word in the indigenous Calusa language, whose meaning may be Point of Rocks or Place of the Dance. Some believe a fanciful story created for a popular early twentieth-century pageant held in Sarasota, that it was named after the daughter of famous explorer Hernando de Soto's daughter Sara.\n\nAccording to the Florida League of Cities FLC, the name first appeared in print as \"Zarazote\" on a 1763 land grant map.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the county has a total area of 725.18 square miles (1,878.2 km2), of which 571.55 square miles (1,480.3 km2) (or 78.81%) is land and 153.63 square miles (397.9 km2) (or 21.19%) is water.[3]\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nManatee County, Florida - north\n\nDeSoto County, Florida - east\n\nCharlotte County, Florida - south\n\nPlaces[]\n\nIncorporated[]\n\nCity of Sarasota\n\nCity of North Port\n\nCity of Venice\n\nTown of Longboat Key\n\nUnincorporated[]\n\nBee Ridge\n\nDesoto Lakes\n\nEnglewood\n\nFruitville\n\nGulf Gate Estates\n\nKensington Park\n\nLake Sarasota\n\nLaurel\n\nNokomis\n\nNorth Sarasota\n\nOsprey\n\nPlantation\n\nRidge Wood Heights\n\nSarasota Springs\n\nSiesta Key\n\nSouth Gate Ridge\n\nSouth Sarasota\n\nSouth Venice\n\nSouthgate\n\nThe Meadows\n\nVamo\n\nVenice Gardens\n\nWarm Mineral Springs\n\nParks and preserves[]\n\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n\nBayonne Parcel\n\nCircus Hammock\n\nCurry Creek Preserve\n\nDeer Prairie Creek\n\nJelks Preserve\n\nManasota Scrub Preserve\n\nMyakka Islands Point\n\nOld Miakka Preserve\n\nPinelands Reserve\n\nPocono Trail Preserve\n\nRed Bug Slough\n\nSleeping Turtles South\n\nSleeping Turtles North\n\nSouth Lemon Bay Preserve\n\nT.

He established his homestead in the Forked Creek area in 1886 and became an early leader in what now is southern Sarasota County (having been Manatee County from 1855 until 1921).\n\nThe following is a transcript from a Sarasota County historical marker that was erected in a park dedicated to Anderson on Manasota Key.\n\n\"After the Civil War, many Georgians moved their families to Southern Florida. Joseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson, born in Georgia in 1867, was a child when his father moved to the Tampa/Sara Sota area. In 1884, Joseph became the head of the Anderson family. Two years later, he moved his family to Southern Manatee County. He homesteaded the land in the Mystic River (Forked Creek) Valley. In 1890 he married Helen Alice Johnson of Sarasota. They had eleven children. Eight survived.\n\nWith only hand tools, Anderson converted the Florida wilderness into an agricultural industry. This fertile land produced vegetables, sugar cane and citrus. In the vast Myakka/Pinedale area, he raised his cattle and swine. He and brother Moses \"Lee\" prospered in ranching until the Range Law Act curtailed the right to use this land for grazing.\n\nSleds (later wagons) were used to move the farm produce, fruit and cattle to Lemon Bay where they were transferred to draft boats and transported to ships at Boca Grande. Some of the wagons were rafted across the bay to Manasota Beach where the produce was ferried to Cuban smacks and later to American schooners.\n\nAnderson pioneered commercial fishing in North Lemon Bay which teemed with schools of mullet and other fish. The Andersons fished with nets made of cotton and flax twine over which they poured a heavy lime solution to prevent rot. Their base of operation included land storage facilities on the shore and on the beach (Manasota) to salt, dry and pack the fish in barrels. Upon the arrival of run boats with ice from Tampa, the Andersons could ship fresh fish and produce.\n\nJoseph Daniel \"Jody\" Anderson was a quiet family man who never sought publicity. However, before Sarasota County was organized, he served as deputy sheriff and game warden in the Pinedale/Manasota area. The Anderson family built the area's first school (Pinedale) of which Jody was trustee. He also organized the first church in the area. Anderson actively supported the creation of Sarasota County from Manatee County and in 1922, became the first elected county commissioner from District 4. After the death of his first wife, he married Mary Ethel Morgan with whom he raised four more children. Joseph Daniel Anderson died in 1939.\"\n\nSee also[]\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sarasota County, Florida\n\nReferences[]"
