        "text": "Radio DJ: Charly \"Gumbo Charly\" Lukhardt\n\nRadio station: WSLR 96.5 LP-FM (wslr.org)\n\nName of program: \"Hot Tea with Gumbo,\" \"Radio Gumbo\"\n\nWhen to listen: Wednesdays 7-9 a.m.; 3-5 p.m.\n\nWhen started: 2006\n\nStyle/genre: Blues/rock mixes\n\nBio: Despite a love of radio since childhood, native Virginian Charlie Lukhardt came into deejaying late in life. The retired construction project manager found his new calling after sitting in on a bygone WSLR show. Nearly five years later (the anniversary's in August), the blues aficionado still shares his vast musical knowledge with listeners via two programs on Sarasota's low-powered WSLR. \"Radio Gumbo\" began as a blues show but has morphed, by listener demand, into what Lukhardt calls \"blues-based eclectic,\" combining a high- energy mix of blues rock, Delta and contemporary blues, R&B, funk, Cajun, zydeco and straight-ahead rock music -- nothing below mid-tempo -- and the epitome of what Lukhardt calls a \"musical gumbo.\" Conversely, \"Hot Tea with Gumbo\" airs early morning and is appropriately programmed with more moderate- and low-tempo'd fare. Lukhardt shares helming duties on this one, alternating weeks with Bryan Osgood. Fans may email requests to Lukhardt at Radiogumbo325@aol.com.\n\n-- Dawn Scire, dawnzig@hotmail.com"
