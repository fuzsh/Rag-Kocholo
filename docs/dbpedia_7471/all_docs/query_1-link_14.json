Sarasota County is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, FL metropolitan statistical area.\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Sarasota, Florida\n\nThe area that is now known as Sarasota County has been inhabited by humans for some 10,000 years. Evidence of human remains as well as a burned out log at the Warm Mineral Springs, in North Port, were discovered that date to the early Archaic period.\n\nAlthough the name was associated with the area from the beginning of European contacts, the origin of the name \"Sarasota\" is unknown. In the early twentieth-century, a fanciful story was created to go hand-in-hand with a pageant held in Sarasota. The story held that the town was named after the daughter of famous explorer Hernando de Soto's daughter Sara.\n\nAn early map of the area from 1763 shows the word \"Zarazote\" across present day Sarasota.\n\nFollowing exploration, the area was occupied by fishing camps, called ranchos. In 1842, the Armed Occupation Act was passed, which deeded land to settlers who were willing to cultivate land in Florida. The act brought settlers to Sarasota but also led to the Second Seminole War. During the war, the area was occupied by the U.S. army and Fort Armistead was built.\n\nSarasota County was created in 1921 from the southern part of Manatee County. After acquisition by the United States as a territory, the area now included in Sarasota county had been part of St. Johns County (1821), Alachua County (1824), Hillsborough County (1834), and Manatee County (1855) as new counties were created from older counties to accommodate population growth and settlement in new areas.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 725 square miles (1,880 km2), of which 556 square miles (1,440 km2) is land and 169 square miles (440 km2) (23.4%) is water.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nManatee County – north\n\nDeSoto County – east\n\nCharlotte County – south\n\nParks and preserves\n\nIn addition to local parks there are several preserve areas including:\n\nClimate\n\nSarasota County has a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a tropical savanna climate, with hot, humid summers and warm, drier winters.
