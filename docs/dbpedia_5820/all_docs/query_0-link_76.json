        "text": "If there is one Hollywood legend who definitely has a lot of “baggage” in his biography, it would be Charles Chaplin. A true giant in the history of cinema, he created what is probably the most iconic and famous character in all of film: The Little Tramp. The majority of today’s audiences have probably never even seen a Charlie Chaplin film. But show them a silhouette of The Tramp, and they’ll easily recognize the character. He might just be the most recognizable fictional figure of the 20th Century. No mean feat. Especially when you consider the hundreds of thousands of movies that have been made since the silent era. And the fact that it’s been 75 years since the little guy made his last appearance on screen.\n\nBut despite his fame and success, Chaplin didn’t live a picture-perfect life. He often struggled creatively, and made more than his fair share of enemies. Both in the film industry, and at the highest levels of the U.S. Government. His private life was repeatedly dogged by controversy. To the point that for many of his contemporaries, it was easy to forget what a bona fide genius he really was. His story offers a cautionary tale of the abuse of power, and the extreme difficulty of balancing one’s personal and professional life.\n\nCharles Chaplin was born in London, England in 1889. Both of his parents worked in various music halls, exposing young Charlie to the stage at an early age. But his formative years were especially harsh. His father was a hard core alcoholic who died when the boy was only 12. His mother was committed to an insane asylum, and Chaplin ended up residing in a workhouse for orphaned boys. The young performer spent his teenage years as part of small dancing and acting troupe. He lived a day to day existence, and at one point, his place of residence was listed in the census as a local theater. For a while, he even shared a boardinghouse with a young Stan Laurel.\n\nChaplin’s big break came in his early 1900s when his acting troupe went on tour to America. There, he was noticed by Mack Sennett, one of the early pioneers of film comedy. He hired Chaplin as a bit player, and soon he was clowning around with the likes of Mabel Normand and Fatty Arbuckle.\n\nBack in those days, the film industry was in its infancy. Short, improvised comedy routines were the norm, with little thought given to scripting and planning, much less rehearsals. Everything revolved around visual gags. Movies were cranked out in record time, and it wasn’t uncommon for a “one-reeler” to be in the can before the day’s lunch break. (Note: the terms one-reeler, two-reeler etc. came from these early efforts. They referred to the length of film stock in a single canister, which translated to about 8 mins per reel. Three Stooges shorts, for example, were referred to as two-reelers, because they usually ran about 16 mins in length.)\n\nOne day, while working on a short called “Mabel’s Strange Predicament,” Chaplin was asked by Mack Sennett to simply “get into a comedy makeup.” Chaplin went to the dressing room by himself and surveyed what props and costumes he had available to use. Years later he remembered those pivotal moments in Film History:\n\nI had no idea of what makeup to put on…I thought I would dress in baggy pants, big shoes, a cane, and a derby hat…I added a small mustache, which I reasoned would add age without hiding my expression. I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed…I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage, he was fully born.\n\nWhile the character never had a formal name, he quickly became recognized by moviegoers as “The Little Tramp.” Mack Sennett and his Keystone Cops were famous for their rough and tumble sight gags, but Chaplin’s character added a large dose of humanity to the proceedings.\n\n“The Tramp” always existed at the bottom of the American social scale. Penniless, poor, and ostracized by those around him, he nevertheless never gave in to despair. He inevitably poked fun at and triumphed over those in higher positions of authority. Something that wasn’t lost on the lower classes of Americana at the time. Many immigrants who otherwise didn’t speak English found “The Tramp” to be a silent hero they could instantly relate to. And within a year, Chaplin was the most popular member of Sennett’s stock company.\n\nAfter making dozens of films for Sennett, in 1916 Chaplin accepted a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation. He was given almost complete creative freedom and responded by making a dozen two-reel comedies which became very profitable. A year and a half later, after the contract ended, Chaplin changed homes again, signing with First National Studios. At first, his new bosses expected him to keep churning out popular shorts just like he had been. But Chaplin now had his own personal studio at his disposal. And armed with a contract which guaranteed him complete artistic control, he began to expand into longer fare.\n\nIn 1921 he made The Kid, his first classic feature-length film. It starred a young Jackie Coogan (who later grew up to play Uncle Fester on The Addams Family.) While full of sight gags and comedy bits, most audiences respond to the scene in which the authorities pull the crying child away from The Tramp in order to send him to an orphanage. The images of the distraught child, matched with the anguish of The Tramp as he scampers over rooftops trying to save his young friend broke hearts in 1921. In addition to being the first full length film to combine comedy with heart wrenching tears, “The Kid” was one of the biggest moneymakers of the silent era.\n\nIt was also around then that Chaplin formed an alliance with three other giants of the silent screen: Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith. What they all had in common was a resentment of the power that was being consolidated in the hands of film corporations at the time. As well as a fear of what control that economic clout would give the studios over their creative aspirations. In response, the four filmmakers formed United Artists. The new studio would be a mainstay in Hollywood until the early 1980s–when the production of Heaven’s Gate finally destroyed it. But at the time, United Artists assured Chaplin not only of the guaranteed distribution of his films, but also the financial resources to do whatever he wanted.\n\nIt was now that Chaplin launched into his most successful creative period. In 1925, he made The Gold Rush. It contains a classic and often imitated scene in which The Tramp puts forks into two dinner rolls and makes them dance. Followed by another in which while stranded in a snowbound cabin, Chaplin cheerfully attempts to eat a shoe using a knife and fork. The movie also contains a heartbreaking sequence in which the Tramp is ridiculed by several women who pretend to accept an invitation to dine with him. To prepare for the big night, The Tramp uses up all his meager savings to prepare the best meal he can, only to to be stood up and later find his would-be dates dancing the night away at the local bar.\n\n“The Gold Rush” remains one of the most famous of all silent films. And was hugely popular with the movie-going public. Chaplin claimed several times it was the one movie he most wanted to be remembered for. But it was also around this time that Chaplin’s personal life began to intrude on his professional persona.\n\nChaplin had always been attracted to young girls. And while making “The Gold Rush,” he met a 16 year old actress named Lita Grey. (Chaplin later claimed she had lied about her age). The two started a relationship, which led to Grey becoming pregnant. To avoid a scandal, Chaplin and the young girl eloped to Mexico, where they married in secret. But as one might imagine, their relationship was doomed from start. The two had little in common, and Chaplin felt he had been “tricked” into the arrangement. The couple began to argue, and the director began to look for ways to stay away from home.\n\nIt was under this shadow that Chaplin began production on his next film: The Circus. Another classic in the Chaplin film library, it contains several inventive set pieces. The most famous of which has Charlie on a tightrope being besieged by monkeys. Chaplin had no tightrope walking experience, and had to train rigorously in order to do the stunt himself. There’s also a tear-inducing scene at the very end when the young lovers ask The Tramp to join them in their wagon when it rolls out of town. The Tramp, realizing that he can never be part of a “normal” world, politely declines, and wanders off by himself as the camera’s black iris closes in on him.\n\nBut back then, the most amazing thing about the film was that it was ever completed at all. It took over two years to finish, was beset by an unbelievable amount of problems, and turned out to be the most challenging experience of Chaplin’s professional career. At one point the studio set completely burned down. Another time, a group of college students stole all the circus wagons used in the production. And the film lab damaged several reels, which meant that over a month of painstaking work was completely lost.\n\nBy this time, Chaplin had developed a very peculiar–some would say perfectionist–approach to his work. Often the script would contain the barest of descriptions (for example…The Tramp walks into a barber shop…). From there, Chaplin would develop comedy “bits.” He would shoot for days, or even weeks. And wait for another idea to come into his head. But sometimes the idea didn’t match what was shot before. And he would start all over from scratch. It was an extremely time intensive and costly way to make a movie. And highly unlikely that any other filmmaker in the world who would be indulged in this fashion. Unless your name was Charlie Chaplin and you owned your own studio.\n\nMeanwhile, Chaplin’s home life had descended into a living hell. He and Grey fought constantly until she finally walked out. When the divorce papers were served a few weeks later, Chaplin knew he had a huge problem on his hands. Most divorce papers of the time were three to four pages in length. The page count on these came to 52. Spurred on by her lawyers, Grey made it abundantly clear that she was going to play hardball. She wanted half of all of Chaplin’s assets. Which included his studio, and all the work that had been done so far on “The Circus.” To show she meant business, the papers Grey submitted included the most intimate details of Chaplin’s sex life, as well as names of other prominent women he had dated…many from years before. Grey and her lawyers contacted several of them (including William Randolph Hearst’s mistress Marion Davies) to persuade them to put pressure on Chaplin to cough up the dough…or face having their names dragged through the mud.\n\nGrey and her lawyers were counting on the fact that Chaplin wouldn’t let the affair go to court. But that’s exactly what he chose to do. And the resulting proceedings became one of the biggest scandals of the 1920s. Humorist Will Rogers quipped at the time that he was leaving town just to avoid being named in the Chaplin divorce suit. And if that wasn’t enough, during the trial Chaplin was hit with another lawsuit from the IRS who claimed he owed Uncle Sam over a million dollars in unpaid taxes. His hair literally went white during this time period (some say overnight).\n\nChaplin eventually settled with Grey and gave her $600,000 in what became the largest divorce settlement up until that time. Her divorce claim, with all of the juicy bedroom details contained therein was also publicly sold. Chaplin’s personal life and sense of privacy had been shattered. But at least he was free to finish working on “The Circus”.\n\nChaplin’s personal troubles only seemed to fuel his perfectionist streak. He struggled to complete the film. And when it was released, it was another huge smash. The public loved it. In their praise for the film, they seemed to completely forget the sordid details from the recent trial.\n\nBut Charles Chaplin had a new challenge ahead of him. A few months before “The Circus” was released, Warner Brother’s production of The Jazz Singer had come out. Silent films were dying and “talkies” were all the rage. If actors didn’t speak, moviegoers wanted no part of them.\n\nThis presented a huge dilemma for Chaplin. His signature character worked in pantomime. He communicated to a universal audience through gestures and visual cues. Chaplin had spent over a decade perfecting his delivery. If he opened his mouth to talk, the illusion would be destroyed. And even if he chose to go this route, what would “The Tramp” say? Chaplin instinctively knew that if he gave into commercial pressures, there was no way he could avoid the disappointment. So, he put on his game face and publicly claimed that “talkies” were just a fad. But privately, he knew his career stood on the edge of an abyss.\n\nChaplin then made a courageous decision. At the height of the conversion to sound, he announced that his next film was going to stay silent. Most everyone at the time thought he was crazy. It’s extremely doubtful there was any other filmmaker at the time who could have gotten the backing to embark on such a venture. But the final result two years later was City Lights. And most film critics consider it Chaplin’s masterpiece. The ending alone is felt by many to be among the most moving in the history of cinema.\n\nIn “City Lights” The Tramp meets and falls in love with a blind flower girl. In his efforts to get money to pay for an operation to restore her sight, he takes a series of odd jobs. None of them end well (to put it mildly). He also meets a drunk and suicidal millionaire who is only too happy to give him the money. The problem being that after the millionaire sobers up, he can never remember the promises he previously made. A series of misadventures ensue.\n\nFinally, The Tramp gets the money that’s needed to restore the girl’s sight. She assumes her benefactor is some rich, handsome, accomplished man. But at the end of the film, the disheveled Tramp meets her again, and helps her pick up a fallen flower. She recognizes his touch and looks into his eyes. “You?” she asks. The Tramp nods. “You can see now?” he asks. “Yes, I can see now” she replies. The film fades out on a closeup of The Tramp, as the audience is left to wonder if the girl can ever truly accept him or the sacrifices he has made on her behalf.\n\nLife Magazine film critic James Agee once called this simple scene “the greatest piece of acting ever committed to celluloid.” More recent viewers may remember Jack Lemmon tearing up while describing it as part of the American Film Institute’s 2007 countdown of the top 100 films of all time. (“City Lights” placed 11th on the list. AFI also chose it as the best Romantic Comedy ever made). No less a person than Orson Welles once said that “City Lights” was his favorite movie of all time.\n\n“City Lights” also holds the distinction of having what is perhaps the most lavish “premiere” in Hollywood history. The crowds who attended it in 1931 quite simply got out of control. Several city blocks in downtown Los Angeles had to be closed off, and most of the department store windows which fronted the surrounding streets were destroyed by the surging crowds. You’ve probably seen footage from the debut of “City Lights” but never realized it. The newsreel footage shot from the rooftops formed the background plates a year later when RKO technicians made the movie “King Kong.” The scenes of a frenzied crowd mobbing the streets below while Kong holds Fay Wray in his hands atop New York skyscrapers weren’t staged. You’re really watching actual footage from the premiere of “City Lights.”\n\nOnce again, Chaplin’s artistic and perfectionist sensibilities had been vindicated. “City Lights” was another huge financial and critical success. But it took him another five years to make his next film. Modern Times also featured The Tramp in a silent movie. But by this time Chaplin knew that sound films were here to stay. While still technically a silent film, “Modern Times” features many synchronized sound effects, including some indecipherable metallic “speech” designed to mimic the technical inadequacies of early sound recordings. Less structured than other Chaplin films, it nevertheless features multiple funny bits as “The Tramp” attempts to grapple with the changes brought on by industrialization. For decades afterward, many scholars have noticed how prescient some of its themes are. Especially when describing the loss of humanity to the cause of “progress.” The film closes as The Tramp and Paulette Goddard (Chaplin’s girlfriend at the time) walk down a country road toward an unknown future. It marked the last time “The Tramp” was to be seen on the silver screen.\n\n“Modern Times” was the last important silent feature ever made. Chaplin knew that era had come and gone. And four years later, he decided to make his first all talking picture. It was also the first one in which he worked off a finished script. But for his subject matter, he chose a target which was anything but conventional. The Great Dictator was designed to be an obvious skewering of Adolf Hitler. And was honest when it came to depicting the Nazi persecution of Jews. In the late 30s, this was an area where other Hollywood studios still didn’t dare tread. Other than The Three Stooges, (You Nazty Spy, I’ll Never Heil Again) it was taboo for the studio system to tackle such obvious political subjects.\n\nIndeed, “The Great Dictator” was banned in Great Britain because the authorities felt it was too inflammatory. It wasn’t until after war was declared that it was allowed to be shown. The film was also banned in Germany. But Hitler’s curiosity was piqued. He ordered a print smuggled in through Portugal so he could view it himself. Although history doesn’t record his reaction, he reportedly sat through it twice. (In one of the quirks of history, many people have noticed the similarities between Chaplin and Hitler. Aside from the obvious mustache, they were both born four days apart, loved Richard Wagner, came from broken families, and had endured extreme poverty in their youths. “Just think,” Chaplin once mused, “he’s the madman. I’m the comic. But it could have been the other way around.” )\n\nIn the film, Chaplin plays two characters. One is a Jewish barber very similar to The Tramp character. The other is Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomainia. (There’s a very famous sequence in which Hynkel performs a ballet in his office with a floating globe that represents the world.) Through a series of mix-ups, the barber ends up being mistaken for the egotistical dictator and is forced to give a speech in his stead at the end of the film. But instead of speaking about persecution and world domination, the barber instead gives an impassioned speech arguing for reason, tolerance, and democratic values.\n\nThe ending speech was so effective, that it was later played at patriotic pep rallies during World War II. Chaplin also allowed other people to recite it as part of various radio programs in order to support the war effort. Some thought the politics of “The Great Dictator” too serious. Others thought them not serious enough. But regardless, the film ended up being the biggest moneymaker of Chaplin’s entire career.\n\nBut after the war ended, the country’s mood changed. And Chaplin had inadvertently set himself up as a target. The speech at the end of “The Great Dictator” contained references to “equality” and the need for compassion. This was construed by some as being too far left and anti-capitalist. Many people began to paint Chaplin as a Communist. While never making a secrecy of his liberal leanings and identification with the lower strata of society, Chaplin had no connections whatsoever to any political party. But his unorthodox working style, huge income, earlier tax problems, and the fact that he had never become a U.S. citizen hadn’t earned him many friends in Tinseltown. His marriage to Oona O’Neill (the daughter of playwright Eugene O’Neill) in 1943 didn’t help matters either. At the time she was 18 and he 54. (They remained married for the rest of Chaplin’s life). Even though he had never actively supported Communism, or broken any laws, Chaplin’s years of success had made others in the film community quite envious. They regularly spread gossip about him without any facts whatsoever to base it on.\n\nChaplin’s next film, Monsieur Verdoux, did little to silence his critics. It was a black comedy in which his character marries and murders wealthy women in order to earn their inheritance. At the end, before being taken to the guillotine, he gives a small speech in which he shrugs off his crimes, stating that when an individual kills a few people, it’s called murder. But when thousands of others die in war, it’s called progress.\n\nSuch sentiments didn’t go over well during the McCarthy era. J. Edgar Hoover ordered the FBI to beef up their file on Chaplin. Back in the 1980s, the FBI documents on Chaplin were made public. What astounded film historians was how detailed and extensive they were. There were over 1900 pages contained therein. And almost all of it full of essentially baseless information. The FBI seemed to start from the assumption that Chaplin was guilty of being un-American, and threw in everything except the kitchen sink in a vain attempt to find proof. But there was no smoking gun to be found.\n\nJust to give you an idea of how ludicrous the type of information the FBI collected on Chaplin was…in one section the files contained the testimony of an unrelated army officer who was being disciplined for a security violation. At one point during his briefing, the officer sarcastically sneered “Yeah, I’m a Communist. And so is Charlie Chaplin!” This went into the file. As did a positive review of a Chaplin film in Pravda from 1923. Hoover ordered the latter be given to Hollywood gossip columnists 24 years later in an attempt to smear Chaplin as a Soviet agent.\n\nIn fact, the majority of Chaplin’s files seemed to be pulled from the tabloids of the day. Almost all of the FBI “documentation” could be described as “he said that she said that he said that she knew someone decades ago who thought they might have heard something.” The files were also full of unsubstantiated innuendo about Chaplin’s personal life, including intimate conjecture about women he previously had relationships with. Again, without any evidence whatsoever to back it up.\n\nHoover himself was reportedly personally frustrated at his bureau’s inability to get the goods on Chaplin. Finding nothing he could arrest the man on, the FBI Director got his chance in 1952 when Chaplin traveled to England in order to promote his latest film Limelight. Knowing that the film icon still wasn’t officially a U.S. citizen, Hoover had his re-entry permit revoked without notice after he left the country. Chaplin thought he was merely taking a short trip. But Hoover’s actions essentially left him stranded overseas with no home to live in and without any of his personal belongings.\n\nDisgusted and weary of being harassed by the FBI, Chaplin chose not to fight his exile. He eventually settled in Switzerland, where he would spend the final 25 years of his life. Although no longer officially part of the Hollywood film industry, Chaplin continued to compose music for his classic films, and oversee their re-release. He also made two final movies, A King in New York, and A Countess From Hong Kong. Film screenings and festivals around the world continued to keep his work alive in the public eye.\n\nBut then, as the 1970s dawned, Chaplin’s health began to fail. And word began to circulate that the comic icon was mortal after all. In 1972, The Academy of the Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited him to return to Hollywood in order to present him with an honorary Oscar for his lifetime of achievements. Chaplin accepted. And when he strode onto the stage that year, he was met with a 12 minute standing ovation. To this day, it remains the longest one in the history of the Academy Awards. The film industry was acutely aware of the terrible injustice that had been done to Chaplin. It just took them 20 years to acknowledge it. And this was their way of doing so. Watching the elderly man fight back tears has often been described as the most moving moment in Oscar history.\n\nAfterward, Chaplin returned to Switzerland where his health continued to decline. He died on Christmas Day, 1977. Not unexpectedly, retrospectives and remembrances began to pour in from around the globe. In introducing a biographical book on Chaplin, reviewer Martin Sieff wrote:\n\nChaplin was not just big. He was gigantic. In 1915 he burst onto a war-torn world bringing it the gift of comedy, laughter, and relief, while it was tearing itself apart…(and) over the next 25 years, he stayed on the job…It is doubtful any individual has given more entertainment, pleasure, and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most.\n\nHowever, when Chaplin passed away, we thought one of the most elegant tributes of all was also one of the shortest. It came from Bob Hope of all people. Who, upon hearing of Chaplin’s death, said simply:"
