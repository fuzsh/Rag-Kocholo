        "text": "Only jokes that have a purpose run the risk of meeting with people who do not want to listen to them.-Sigmund Freud, Jokes and their Relation to the U~zconscious (London, lW), p. 90. Chaplin's comedy was unique. His wide-ranging jabs at institutions and authority as well as his propensity for crude, even dirty jokes were allowed no other comedian of his time. His humor was so effective that it vanquished its opposition. When audiences were under the spell of his comedy, almost anything became permissible. And yet this shattering of respect was not without risks, particularly once Chaplin's humor waned-as it did later in his career. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, as Chaplin came under attack for his politics as well as his personal life, sympathetic American critics tried to rescue his reputation and his films. After briefly surveying the already substantial writings on Chaplin, Theodore Huff concluded that the screen character he created was a little man buffeted by life. The comedian \"worked out a common denominator of fun and feeling that accords with something in every age, class, and race of people the world over. Chaplin is universal and timeless.\" This strain of criticism was prominently and adeptly amplified, though in a more ironic mode, by Walter Kerr. For him, The secret of Chaplin as a character is that he can be anyone. That is hi pmblem. The secret is a devastating one. For the man who can, w i t h a flick of a finger or the blink of an eyelash, instantly transform himself into absolutely anyone is a man w h o must, i n his heart, remain no one2 These efforts to defend Chaplin's integrity as an artist severed him not only from the very social, economic and cultural context in which he worked, but also from the context in which his films were initially seen. While intended as a defense, or at least a sympathetic reading of Chaplin's comedies, these writings might more aptly be seen as efforts to bowdlerize them, to make his humor safe for that universal audience. In contrast, this article seeks to resituate RADICAL HISTORY REVIEW 41 1988\n\nThis chapter explores how duality plays out within and across Chaplin’s screen comedy. As a means identifying what is specific about Chaplin’s handling of duality, I contrast the use of this trope within Chaplin’s films with how it operates within the films of other Hollywood comedians such as Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, and Jim Carrey. As I suggest, duality is a recurring technique within comedian comedy, but the various performers deploy and interpret in very different ways. For Kaye and Lewis, for example, duality frequently has a psychological rationale, while Chaplin persistently uses it to address and expose social inequality. I map out the diverse senses in which the concept of duality can be seen to apply to Chaplin’s work and image, arguing that within the films it points towards the way his comic character is identified as a figure who straddles social boundaries (exemplified most tellingly, perhaps, in the ending of The Pilgrim). I connect this to broader operations of comedian comedy, where the comedian figure is frequently a conduit for channelling otherness. I am not proposing that the later comedians are explicitly influenced by Chaplin in this respect, as I suggest that this function is a foundational principle of performer-centred comedy. In The Art of Charlie Chaplin, John Kimber goes so far as to proclaim “compulsive doubleness” as “the most important single clue to his (ie. the Charlie figure’s) spirit”. Kimber identifies Chaplin’s duality as an inheritance of the fool tradition, and I draw upon critical work on the fool and the carnivalesque to scrutinize the manifestations and significance of duality. Following on from Kimber, I explore the various ways in which duality informs Chaplin’s films, focussing in particular on Police and The Pilgrom – but I will also suggest how it characterises the relations between director and performer, performer and role, and the contradictions within Chaplin’s public image.\n\nSir Charles (Charlie) Spencer Chaplin was comedic actor, film director, composer and musician. He was born in the United Kingdom and moved to the United States of America (USA) in 1913 and eventually became one of the most creative and influential personalities of the silent-film era. His working life in entertainment spanned over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the Music-hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer until his death at the age of 88. Chaplin’s most prolific creative activity occurred in the USA from 1914 to the mid 1940s. His most well-regarded movies were made with United Artists and include City Lights (1931), Modern Times (1936), The Great Dictator (1940) and Monsieur Verdoux (1947), although he made many other classic movies. Chaplin was critical to the development of film as an art form and he showed the potential of the medium to communicate complex themes. Chaplin, in his mature period, made intricate films, and provided an abrasive exploitation of p..."
