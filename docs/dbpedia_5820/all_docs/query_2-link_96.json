        "text": "CHARLIE CHAPLIN VANISHES AN EGG\n\nA genius filmmaker and comedian, Charlie Chaplin was also fascinated with magic.\n\nIn fact, he created a character named Prof. Bosco, a magician who appeared in his movie The Circus in 1928.\n\nThe character was based on a real-life magician, Leotard Bosco, who was an English performer and music hall owner in the late 1800s.\n\nCharles Chaplin Sr. performed at Bosco's theater, which probably gave Charlie Chaplin the idea for the character.\n\nEnjoy this rare film footage of Charlie Chaplin performing an impromptu Vanishing Egg routine at an Easter celebration at his home."
