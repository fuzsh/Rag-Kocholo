        "text": "Chaplin is considered the first world star of the cinema and is one of the most influential comedians in film history. His most famous role is that of the “tramp”. The figure invented by him with a mustache (also called Chaplin beard), oversized pants and shoes, a tight jacket, bamboo stick in hand and a small melon on his head, with the manners and dignity of a gentleman, became a movie icon. Characteristic of his films was the close connection between slapstick comedy and serious to tragic elements. The American Film Institute chose Chaplin at of the largest male American film legends.\n\nHe began his career as a child with appearances in the Music Hall. As a comedian in the early silent comedies he soon celebrated great successes. As the most popular silent comedian of his time, he developed artistic and financial independence.\n\nIn 1919 he founded together with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and David Wark Griffith the film company United Artists.\n\nCharlie Chaplin was one of the founding fathers of the American film industry – the so-called dream factory Hollywood. Suspected of being close to communism, he was denied return to the United States following a stay abroad in 1952 during the McCarthy era. He continued his work as an actor and director in Europe.\n\nIn 1972 he received his second honorary Oscar: The first he had received in 1929 for his work in the film The Circus, the second he received for his life’s work.\n\nIn 1973 he received the first “real” Oscar for best movie score on limelight."
