She also appeared films like L’odeur des fauves (1972), Daniel Petrie’s The Bay Boy (1984), and with Klaus Kinski in a German-language version of Jack the Ripper (1976).\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Josephine Chaplin was a longtime resident of Paris, Chaplin did most of her acting in French features, among them Nuits rouges (1974) and À l’ombre d’un été (1976).\n\nJosephine managed the Chaplin office in Paris on behalf of her siblings for years. Her father died in December 1977 at age 88. Variety reported at the time that Oona and seven of their children were at his bedside when he died.\n\nJosephine was married to Greek businessman Nikki Sistovaris from 1969 until their 1977 divorce, then lived with French actor Maurice Ronet until his 1983 death.
