        "text": "Keystone - 1914Mabel NormandMabel Normand was Chaplin's first leading lady. She was already a well-known silent film star by the time Chaplin started at Keystone.\n\nMabel was born to a music hall family on November 9, 1892. Her film work with Mack Sennett at Keystone is what she is most remembered for.\n\nIt was at Keystone where Mabel directed Charlie in a few of his first films. But Chaplin was not one to have anyone direct him, and soon would be directing himself.\n\nCharlie and Mabel did 12 films together at Keystone in 1914, including the popular 'Tillie's Punctured Romance'.\n\nMabel Normand and Chaplin in 'Dough and Dynamite'\n\nKeystone - 1914Marie DresslerMarie Dressler starred with Chaplin in Mack Sennetts Tillie's Punctured Romance along with Mabel Normand.\n\nThis was the very first full length feature comedy ever made and the only film Chaplin played with Marie.\n\nMarie was a popular stage star and was touring in stage plays in the many different cities as Chaplin did with Karno. Dressler visited Chaplin many years later at the Chaplin Film Studios and both worked on the War Bond tours.\n\nDressler won the Best Actress Oscar in 1931 for 'Min and Bill', and will always be remembered for her role in 'Dinner at Eight'.\n\nChaplin, Marie Dressler and Mabel Normand in 'Tillie...' Here is a 1910 recording of Dressler.\n\nEssanay - 1915 Mutual - 1916 and 1917\n\nFirst National - 1918 to 1923\n\nUnited Artists - 1923Edna PurvianceEdna Purviance was Chaplin's leading lady for 34 films with Essanay, Mutual, First National Films and Chaplin's United Artists film\n\nA Woman of Paris.\n\n'Paris' was her first starring role, but her last film working with Chaplin.\n\nEdna was at the top of her career when she and Mabel Normand were present at the Dine's shooting on New Year's Day 1924. The shooting was done by Mabel's chauffeur, but it marked that started the end for both of their careers.\n\nEdna made two more films, 'AWoman of the Sea' (also known as The Sea Gull) in L.A. and 'Education de Prince' in France during the mid-1920's.\n\nShe lived a very active, but quieter life at her Los Angeles home, with her many friends and family around. She was married for a few years, but her husband died suddenly in San Francisco.\n\nShe was asked to do a TV interview in the 1950's, but didn't, remarking she belonged to the silent era.\n\nEdna Purviance and Charlie Chaplin in 'Work'\n\nUnited Artists - 1925The Gold Rush\n\nGeorgia HaleAfter Edna, Chaplin had several leading ladies over the next 29 years. The first leading lady after Edna was Georgia Hale, who played the dance hall girl in The Gold Rush.\n\nGeorgia Hale was not the first choice for the dance hall girl. Lita Grey, who played the vamp in the dream sequence of 'The Kid', originally had the role, but became Chaplin's wife instead.\n\nThis was not Miss Hale's first film, but one of\n\nseveral she did in the 1920's.\n\nMiss Hale wrote the book 'Charlie Chaplin: Intimate Close-up' in 1995. She played in 22 films during her career.\n\nGeorgia Hale and Chaplin in 'The Gold Rush'\n\nUnited Artists - 1928The Circus\n\nMerna KennedyMerna Kennedy was the equestrienne in The Circus.\n\nMiss Kennedy's career started as a dancer in musical comedies. She was a friend of Lita Grey who suggested Merna for 'The Circus'.\n\nLita and Merna were childhood friends. It was Lita who first introduced Chaplin to Merna in 1924. It was that meeting that lead to Lita Grey being signed as Chaplin's first leading lady after Edna Purviance for 'The Gold Rush'. But it is Merna who would become Chaplin's leading lady instead a couple of years later.\n\n'The Circus' insured Merna's place in film history. She would make a few mores films before retiring in the mid-1930's. She married Busby Berkeley after leaving her film career.\n\nMerna Kennedy and Chaplin in 'The Circus'\n\nUnited Artists - 1931City Lights\n\nVirginia CherrillVirginia Cherrill did a stunning job portraying\n\nthe blind girl in City Lights.\n\nThis was Miss Cherrill's first film. She will always be remembered for her role, but the relationship between Cherrill and Chaplin off screen was cool at best. Cherrill nearly lost the role and was fired for a short period, but won the role back after a 'talk' and 'rethink' from Chaplin.\n\nIt was a difficult film for Chaplin to make with everyone else doing 'talkies' in the early 1930's. It turned out to be is one of his best!\n\nCherrill's performance as the blind girl did capture the heart of Cary Grant, and they were married. Cherrill can be seen in an interview talking about her role in the 1983 'Unknown Chaplin' Series Part II.\n\n'City Lights' with Virginia Cherrill\n\nUnited Artists - 1936Modern Times\n\nPaulette GoddardOnly Mabel and Edna did more leading lady roles with Chaplin. Paulette Goddard did two films with Chaplin in 1936 and 1940.\n\nCharlie met Paulette at a party after returning from his World Tour in 1932. He saw in Paulette the perfect girl for his next picture. They became very close and worked hard on Chaplin's last silent film 'Modern Times'. This was Paulette's first leading role in a film.\n\nPaulette Goddard received praise for her role as the gamine in Modern Times.\n\nShe would continue her own rather successful film career in the late 1930's and 1940's. more>\n\nPaulette Goddard with Chaplin in 'Modern Times'\n\nUnited Artists - 1940The Great Dictator\n\nPaulette GoddardPaulette Goddard's second and last film with Chaplin was the role of Hannah in The Great Dictator.\n\nPaulette was Chaplins wife in real life during most of the 1930s until June 1942. But there is still some question about that marriage.\n\nMiss Goddard played in several films during her career including 'Women' and 'Unconquered'. She nearly won the role for the lead in 'Gone With the Wind', but the question over her marriage to Chaplin haunted that chance for the role.\n\nIn later years, they both lived in Switzerland and remained friends.\n\nPaulette Goddard in 'The Great Dictator'\n\nUnited Artists - 1947Monsieur Verdoux\n\nMarilyn Nash*Marilyn Nash play the girl in Monsieur Verdoux. Nash met Chaplin while at a tennis party at his Hollywood home.\n\nChaplin soon had a screen test and signed her for his leading lady in 'Monsieur Verdoux'.\n\nMiss Nash has been listed as a leading lady but Martha Raye was really the shining leading lady as 'Annabella Bonheur' in 'Monsieur Verdoux'. (*pictured below)\n\nMarilyn Nash with Chaplin in 'Monsieur Verdoux'*October 2011 - Marilyn Nash has died (1926-2011)"
