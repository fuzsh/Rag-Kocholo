Diabetes\n\nPreface Public Health & Preventive Medicine is in its ninth decade of existence since being ﬁrst published in 1913, and it therefore contains much of the lore of public health and preventive medicine over the twentieth century. With each edition, selecting the appropriate information to include has become increasingly difficult for several reasons. Nearly all the same public health and prevention themes and issues continue to be with us, and new knowledge, research, and practice information for public health and preventive medicine grow at a rapid rate. New diseases are being discovered and our knowledge of existing ones is constantly being reﬁned and expanded. New microorganisms of public health import continue to be discovered and new conditions of public health importance have emerged. Behavioral science has helped us better understand how to promote healthful, hygienic behaviors and better educate our citizens and patients. Science and engineering have created occupational and other environmental exposures never before experienced. The increased survivorship of the populations of industrialized nations has heightened the importance of degenerative diseases, complex medical care programs, and the opportunities for prevention of disease. The population growth of our ﬁnite and frail planet may be causing present and future public health dilemmas that are not, yet, completely understood. There has been increasing attention to\n\nthe social and “unnatural” causes of human suffering and the recognition of human conﬂict as a public health problem. The increased convergence of public health practice and the delivery of clinical health services has created and elevated several topics that must be given some prominence. Every attempt has been made to update the information and acquire new knowledge in this ﬁfteenth edition of Public Health & Preventive Medicine. Although several new topics have been introduced in this edition, inevitably certain issues could not be fully considered. In particular, to keep this textbook at a reasonable size, there is somewhat less emphasis on the issues of developing countries and some topics worthy of extended length have been shortened. Some of the chapters have been adapted from those in the fourteenth edition, usually in situations where the previous author was unable to participate again. Full credit for the preserved portions of previous editions is not possible, but can be found by perusing those editions. Although the majority of the more than 200 contributors to this textbook are from North America, most of the themes presented here have universal application and the lore comes from scientists and practitioners worldwide.

The scientific contributors were most responsive to comments and editorial suggestions, and many had colleagues, too numerous to mention, who skillfully gave of their time in facilitating manuscript preparation and in communicating with the section editors and the editorial office. Particular appreciation is noted for Julie Bobitt, Linsey Abbott, and\n\nNicole Schmidt who provided high-quality logistical and editing support for assembling the many contributions to this volume. Michael Brown and Maya Barahona of the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company also gave invaluable support, advice, and assistance in the assembly of this book. Finally, John M.

His successor, Kenneth Maxcy, moved to Johns Hopkins University. When Maxcy was in turn succeeded as editor by Philip E. Sartwell and the size of the writing team began to grow, the center of gravity of “MaxcyRosenau” was decisively located in Baltimore: twenty of the thirty-nine contributors to the tenth edition were on the Johns Hopkins staff, and all but two or three contributors were associated with schools of public health. In 1976, the Publisher invited the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine (ATPM) to assume responsibility for the eleventh and subsequent editions. After a search, John M. Last, from the University of Ottawa, was selected as editor. Under his leadership,\n\n“Maxcy-Rosenau-Last” evolved in several ways, becoming more comprehensive and international and with an increased number of contributors. Under the auspices of the ATPM, the thirteenth edition was coedited by Last and Robert B. Wallace, from the University of Iowa. Wallace became the editor for the fourteenth edition. The current ﬁfteenth edition has been edited by Wallace with the capable assistance of Neal Kohatsu, now at the California Department of Public Heath. More than 200 authors from diverse disciplines and geographic situations have contributed to this edition. John Last continues to be an active contributor to this volume and to public health in general. Robert B.

Recent volumes from the U.S. Institute of Medicine have addressed the deﬁnitions and functions of public health1,2 in a careful and thoughtful way, and described several pathways to healthier communities. The ﬁeld of preventive medicine, the interface between public health and medical practice, is also critical to the health of populations, but is in a faster transition as the roles traditionally performed by physicians in population medicine are reconsidered and the structure of public health evolves. In the meantime, the health needs of the public are as acute as ever and demand all of the energy, skill, and science that public health and preventive medicine can muster. Fortunately, there have been rapid and important advancements in public health and preventive medicine. Some have come as a result of inexorable achievements in productive science, and others were prodded by special public health emergencies and problems, or organizational changes in the delivery of preventive and curative health services. Many advancements in both practice and knowledge have been evolutionary, but in a few instances, there have been fundamental enhancements to our knowledge of the universe and their applications to the public health sciences. While there may be disagreements about what these achievements have been, and indeed some may not yet be fully recognized, the past several years have witnessed several striking and rapidly advancing trends. The following are some of the important trends that have shaped public health and preventive medicine, particularly within industrialized countries. • Increased incorporation of business and administrative practices into prevention and public health service delivery. While general administrative principles and practices have long been a part of public health education and program delivery, the administrative and business emphasis that has swept through most sectors of Western society has also had a clear impact on public health practice. The further application of “industrial standards,” quality improvement techniques, outcome measures, and complex accounting practices have changed the vocabulary and skills requisite for modern public health practice.3,4 With this has come more emphasis on outcome measures. The emphases on both practice guidelines and evidence-based practice have yielded a further orientation toward both traditional and new outcome measures as indicators of community health. More sophisticated measures are in development, and more comprehensive attempts at program performance monitoring are occurring. As more sophisticated, detailed, and measurable outcomes are developed, this monitoring may not only evaluate speciﬁc public health or community programs, but may also work toward\n\nassessing the entire public health, health education, and clinical service structure within a community. • Changes in the deﬁnition of the group or population, the fundamental unit of public health. In general, “the population” that is both the target of preventive and public health programs and interventions has been historically deﬁned as referring to geographic boundaries, due to their encompassing nature and concordance with governmental jurisdictions. That is, of course, still the case, but there has also been a trend toward increasing delivery of comprehensive clinical services to large groups of individuals deﬁned administratively rather than geographically, often referred to as “managed care.” With the health and programmatic information available on these groups and the increasing ability to apply and evaluate public health and preventive services to them, the fundamental public health target group is no longer solely deﬁned in the spatial sense. This has led to the need and opportunity for new partnerships among various private and public health organizations and agencies in order to deliver more effective and efficient public health services.5 In certain respects, this phenomenon has further blurred the boundaries between community-based programs and clinical, preventive, and curative services, thus increasing the need to update and redeﬁne the tasks necessary for complete public health and prevention service delivery. However, the emergence of these new groups that are programmatically important and for whom health information is available has probably served to heighten public health program accountability to a higher proportion of the general population than ever before. • Enhanced conceptualization and measurement of personal health status. This has taken several forms and, while not totally new, has been increasingly incorporated into health status assessment. Perhaps the most important is the increased use of the so-called “quality-of-life” (QOL) measures.6 While the scope and measures of QOL techniques are not consensual, the supplementation of traditional measures of morbidity and mortality with measures and indices of symptoms and syndromes, less well-deﬁned clinical conditions and entities, physical function and disability, affective states and the behavioral manifestations of mental diseases, social functions within and outside the family, and economic well-being and risk status irrespective of health status have added importantly to the understanding of health and optimization of health status. This has changed the meaning and benchmarks for “healthy communities.” 3\n\nCopyright © 2008 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Click here for terms of use.\n\n4\n\nPublic Health Principles and Methods\n\nIn keeping with the theme of enhanced administration in public and preventive services, health status measures for groups and individuals increasingly have become intertwined with the “health” status of preventive and curative programs and service delivery units. That is, the health of members (consumers) of various administered health-care units (providers) can be partially assessed or inferred by process measures of the programs themselves, such as rates of vaccine delivery or early disease detection programs. • Increased codiﬁcation and interpretation of scientiﬁc ﬁndings relevant to prevention and public health. One of the early important and continuing exercises in deﬁning the scientiﬁc and evidentiary basis for clinical preventive practice was performed by what is now the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care7, followed by the continuing reports of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force8, and many others. Making explicit the scientiﬁc basis for preventive practices and interventions and using this evidence to structure practice guidelines has had many important effects, including (a) placing greater priority on effective interventions, (b) educating health practitioners on the strengths and limitations of various interventions, (c) providing one basis for program evaluation of these effective interventions, and (d) identifying the research gaps in these preventive and public health interventions. Parallel tracks of creating guidelines for curative medicine, often called “evidence-based medicine”9 have made similar and important contributions. More recently, a similar effort has been developed under the banner of “evidence-based public health.”9 • Establishment of goals for communities to attain improvement in health status. This exercise has been a part of strategic program planning for a long time, but in the past decade it has been elevated to explicit goal setting for communities and larger jurisdictions. While national goals for health status improvement10 may be useful at the local level, most public health officials and community organizations would rather have goal setting performed at the local level. This allows engagement of local professionals and other citizens and takes greater account of local priorities, needs, and perceptions of the most compelling health problems to which limited resources should be allocated. • Application of more advanced community health information systems.\n\nThis takes many forms, but accurate, comprehensive, and timely community health data are an essential requisite of goal setting and program performance monitoring. Clinical and public health information are both essential and interrelated, raising special issues of ethics and privacy, as well as access. However, the information revolution should allow better program management and assessment, and with appropriate controls should serve the prevention and public health communities in ways not previously possible.11 In summary, the current era has been a time of clear change for both preventive medicine and public health. This book attempts to capture and review these changes for the practitioner and student of these strategically important disciplines. 䉴 REFERENCES\n\n1. Institute of Medicine. Informing the Future.

Wallace\n\nEpidemiology is the basic science and most fundamental practice of public health and preventive medicine. We can study health and disease by observing their effects on individuals, by laboratory investigation of experimental animals, and by measuring their distribution in the population. Each of these ways of investigating health and disease is used by the epidemiologist. Epidemiology is therefore the scientiﬁc foundation for the practice of public health. The word “epidemiology” comes from epidemic, which translated literally from the Greek means “upon the people.” Historically, the earliest concern of the epidemiologist was to investigate, control, and prevent epidemics. This chapter deals with the scientiﬁc principles that are the foundation of epidemiology. We then address the sources and characteristics of information used to assess the health of populations. Next, we discuss the ways this information can be analyzed. Finally, we show how to use epidemiology in controlling and preventing health problems. 䉴 HISTORY\n\nEpidemiology has roots in the Bible and in the writings of Hippocrates, as does much of Western medicine. The Aphorisms of Hippocrates (fourth to ﬁfth century BC) contain many generalizations based on prolonged and careful observation of large numbers of cases. The introductory paragraph of Airs, Waters, Places offers timeless advice on good environmental epidemiology: Whoever would study medicine aright must learn of the following subjects. First he must consider the effect of each season of the year and the differences between them. Secondly he must study the warm and the cold winds, both those that are common to every country and those peculiar to a particular locality. Lastly, the effect of water on the health must not be forgotten. When, therefore, a physician comes to a district previously unknown to him, he should consider both its situation and its aspect to the winds. Similarly, the nature of the water supply must be considered …. Then think of the soil, whether it be bare and waterless or thickly covered with vegetation and wellwatered, whether in a hollow and stiﬂing, or exposed and cold. Lastly consider the life of the inhabitants themselves, are they heavy drinkers and eaters and consequently unable to stand fatigue or, being fond of work and exercise, eat wisely but drink sparely?1\n\nEpidemics of infection seriously concerned physicians in ancient times, although often they could do little more than observe\n\nNote: This is a revision of a chapter from the 14th edition, originally written by Carl W. Tyler, Jr., and John M. Last; revised by the editor.\n\nthe victims and record mortality. Their limited knowledge rarely permitted effective intervention. Until the Renaissance, physicians based their approach more on impressions than real numbers. John Graunt is often regarded as the founder of vital statistics. He ﬁrst published his numerical methods for examining health problems in Natural and Political Observations on the Bills of Mortality in 1662. He was the ﬁrst to attempt this approach. Epidemiology was ﬁrst applied to the control of communicable diseases and public health through quarantine and isolation, even though ideas about disease transmission and microbiology and epidemiology were rudimentary. Johann Peter Frank, a physician who became “director-general of public health” (in modern terminology) to the Hapsburg Empire, systematized and codiﬁed many rules for personal and communal behavior in the eighteenth century. His work contributed to public health and is published in System einer vollstandigen medicinischen Polizey (1779). Careful clinical observation, precise counts of well-deﬁned cases, and demonstration of relationships between cases and the populations in which they occur all combine in the method upon which epidemiology depends. This method was ﬁrst developed in the nineteenth century. Modern epidemiologists hold John Snow2 in high esteem. He painstakingly collected the facts about sources of drinking water that he related to mortality rates from cholera in London. This proved a classic demonstration of the mode of transmission about 30 years before Koch isolated and identiﬁed the cholera Vibrio. Snow’s great contemporary, William Farr,3 deﬁned and clariﬁed many basic ideas of vital statistics and epidemiology. Among his most important contributions were the following: (a) the scope of epidemiology, (b) the concept of person-years, (c) the relationship between mortality rate and probability of dying, (d) standardized mortality ratios, (e) dose-response relationships, (f) herd immunity, (g) the relationship between incidence and prevalence, and (h) the concepts of retrospective and prospective study. He also developed the ﬁrst effective classiﬁcation of disease, the direct ancestor of the nosology that we still use today. Vital Statistics (1885), an edited volume of excerpts from Farr’s annual reports to the registrar-general, is perhaps the best textbook of epidemiology ever written, graced by beautiful writing and well-chosen tables to illustrate the text. Methods of epidemiological investigation have evolved since the mid-nineteenth century. The case-control study reentered medicine from the social sciences in the third decade of the twentieth century. The cohort study came into use after World War II, as a means of identifying risks associated with heart disease, lung cancer, and other emerging public health problems. Epidemiological “experiments” as now conducted in randomized trials are essentially modern innovations. Statistical methods and electronic computation have greatly improved epidemiological analysis. Present indications suggest expanding potential and an exciting future for epidemiology. Populationbased medicine makes community assessment and diagnosis important for determining the need for health services. An increasingly broad 5\n\nCopyright © 2008 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.

Molecular epidemiology promises to let epidemiologists link genetic and many other biological markers to health conditions, thereby creating new potential approaches to intervention. Case-control studies are adding rapidly to our understanding of causeeffect relationships in many chronic and disabling disorders. Epidemiological methods can also help in evaluating health services. What does this brief history of epidemiology teach? First, the community and environment inﬂuence the health of humans, as do our own inherited characteristics. Second, knowing how a disease is transmitted permits us to control and prevent it, even though we may not know the causal agent. Third, even the simplest information about vital events, illnesses, and populations can detect and analyze epidemiological problems. Finally, epidemiology can help ﬁnd, investigate, analyze, control, and prevent a wide range of health problems.\n\n䉴 DEFINITION\n\nEpidemiology is both the basic science of public health and its most fundamental practice. Therefore, we need to examine both aspects of its meaning.\n\nCharacteristics of individuals or populations, identiﬁed by the term “lifestyle,” may include such factors as use of tobacco, alcohol, and automobiles. Past and present environment—including the period of intrauterine life—may inﬂuence exposure and susceptibility to disease.\n\nPractice The practice of a science is best deﬁned by what the scientist does. Langmuir points out that, “the basic operation of the epidemiologist is to count cases and measure the population in which they arise.”5 The practice of epidemiology, therefore, is the scientiﬁc process that detects, investigates, and analyzes health problems, followed by applying this information to the control and prevention of these problems. This practice requires health problems to be the subject of public health surveillance, epidemiological investigation, and analysis. The ﬁndings of this analysis linked to health policy can lead to the control and prevention programs intended to resolve health problems. Evaluation of control and prevention is also the responsibility of the practicing epidemiologist as is the clear and persuasive communication of the scientiﬁc ﬁndings to the public, policy makers, and program staff.\n\nUses of Epidemiology Science Epidemiology was originally deﬁned as the scientiﬁc study of epidemics. An epidemic is the occurrence in excess of normal of an illness, health event, or health-related behavior that occurs in a speciﬁc place or among a group. Reports of cholera by John Snow and childbed fever by Holmes are among the classic examples. In recent years, excessive use of tobacco, called by some “the brown plague,” and the acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS) are examples of modern epidemics. Because the word “epidemic” may lead to chaotic, unreasoned responses to health problems, journalists use the term more often than epidemiologists. Other words, such as outbreak and cluster, are employed by practicing public health professionals to avoid unreasoned public response. In current use, however, the deﬁnition of epidemiology is broader and recognizes the application of this basic science of public health to the control and prevention of health problems. The following deﬁnition, recently agreed upon by an international panel, is widely accepted: Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states and events in speciﬁed populations and the application of this study to the control of health problems.4\n\nSome terms in this deﬁnition require discussion. Distribution relates to time, place, and person. The relevant population characteristics include location, age, sex, and race; occupation and other social characteristics; living places; susceptibility; and exposure to speciﬁc agents. In addition, the distribution of the exposed cases needs to examine time as a factor. Relationships in time reveal information about trends, cyclic or secular patterns, clusters, and intervals from exposure to inciting factors to the onset of disease. Determinants include both causes and factors that inﬂuence the risk of disease. Many diseases have a single necessary cause. When the agent of disease causes a single, speciﬁc condition, as occurs with the tubercle bacillus or the lead in lead-based paint, we know the necessary cause. In addition, there are usually many other determinants. They fall into two broad groups: (a) host factors that determine the susceptibility of the individual and (b) environmental factors that determine the host’s exposure to the speciﬁc agent. Host factors include age, sex, race, genetic or constitutional makeup, physiologic state, nutritional condition, and previous immunological experience. Environmental factors include all conditions of living. Among these factors are family size and composition; crowding; hygienic conditions; occupation; and geographic, climatic, and seasonal circumstances.\n\nThe most important use for epidemiology is to improve our understanding of health and disease—a goal shared by all the disciplines and branches of the biomedical sciences. Morris6 deﬁned seven uses of epidemiology: historical study, community assessment, working of health services, individual risks and chances, completing the clinical picture, identiﬁcation of syndromes, and the search for causes (Table 2-1). Each deserves brief comment.\n\nHistorical Study The classic question “Is health improving?” can be answered only by comparing experience (rates) over time; this is one essential routine activity in all health services. Sometimes when the data are closely examined, unexpected trends appear. For example, asthma deaths increased unexpectedly in children and young adults in Britain and other countries in the 1950s, and continued to increase into the mid1960s, before the cause—self-use of isoprenaline nebulizers—was discovered. Removing the offending product from the market halted the unfortunate trend.\n\nCommunity Assessment What are the health problems? This question can be answered in many ways. For example, what proportion of school children have become regular cigarette smokers by various stages of their progress through school? Or what proportion of people always or never use seat belts when driving or riding in cars? Answers to such questions TABLE 2-1. USES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY Historical study: is community health getting better or worse? Community assessment: what actual and potential health problems are there? Working of health services Efficacy Effectiveness Efficiency Individual risk and chances Actuarial risks Health hazard appraisal Completing the clinical picture: different presentations of a disease Identiﬁcation of syndromes: “lumping and splitting” Search for causes: case-control and cohort studies Evaluation of presenting symptoms and signs Clinical decision analysis\n\n2 have prognostic and also diagnostic value. Community assessment makes it possible to predict the impact of future health problems by known effects of many risk factors.\n\nThe Search for Causes This is the most obvious use for epidemiology. Most hypothesistesting studies (discussed later) have the primary aim of identifying causal factors, or at least of risk factors for disease. This chapter cites many examples of such studies.\n\nWorking of Health Services Are all needed services available, accessible, and used appropriately? Are children receiving necessary immunizations? Can pregnant women begin prenatal care before the end of the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy? Do known contacts of persons with sexually transmitted diseases receive follow-up and treatment? Information on these and many other questions is often gathered routinely or by special survey. Health service administrators should not only always think of these simple routine questions, but should be alert to less obvious potential gaps in coverage. For example, the census will state the numbers of elderly persons who live alone. Is all or only a small portion of these known to the public health nurses and others who provide home surveillance and care?\n\nIndividual Chances What is the risk that a person will die before the next birthday? Actuaries who evaluate the risks for persons seeking life insurance have calculated answers based on probabilities derived from experience. This has become a prominent activity of epidemiologists who work on risk assessment and has led to many new insights, for example, about occupational and environmental risks and the hazards associated with immunizations.7\n\nIdentiﬁcation of Syndromes Epidemiologists are called “lumpers and splitters” because epidemiological investigations sometimes make it possible to group together several differing manifestations of a condition or to separate seemingly identical diseases into more than one category. The latter are more common than the former; examples include the differentiation of hepatitis A from hepatitis B and the distinction between several varieties of childhood leukemia. Examples of “lumping” include the identiﬁcation of many manifestations of tuberculosis. At one time, each group of symptoms and signs had a different name, such as phthisis, consumption, or pleurisy. Addiction to tobacco is the underlying cause of a variety of outcomes. Among them are respiratory cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a portion of the risk of coronary heart disease. All these conditions could result from “tobaccoism.”\n\nCompleting the Clinical Picture One of Morris’ original illustrations of this use for epidemiology was the demonstration that myocardial infarction occurs commonly in women as well as in men. An important difference is that this condition occurs in women at older ages and presents more often as “ruptured ventricle”; this causes sudden death. Last used the technique of “completing the clinical picture” to construct a model8 of what might occur in the average general practice population. In the course of a year, facts known and seen by the physician may be ampliﬁed by epidemiological study even though they might be unidentiﬁed, undiagnosed, or in a single practitioner’s experience and only the submerged part of the iceberg of disease.\n\nOther Uses Clinical epidemiologists have deﬁned other uses for epidemiology that do not ﬁt any of Morris’s original seven uses. One important use is the evaluation of presenting symptoms and signs of disease. Analyzing the data in hospital charts and relating symptoms and complaints to ﬁnal diagnoses makes it possible for an epidemiologist to\n\nEpidemiology and Public Health\n\n7\n\nstudy clinical outcomes, including assessing the adverse effects of therapy. A related use is clinical decision analysis.9 This technique is a rigorous quantitative method used to decide the best method of managing patients with particular diseases. This procedure involves the use of decision trees. Decision trees are algorithms in which the probability of an outcome for each different decision is predicted based on clinical experience.\n\nEpidemiological Method Epidemiologists use a wide range of scientiﬁc information, including clinical ﬁndings, laboratory data, and ﬁeld observations. In the end, it is the reasoning of the epidemiologist that ties these facts together. This reasoning is the logic behind disease control and prevention measures. Epidemiological reasoning is fundamental and straightforward. First, we deﬁne events or clinical cases using careful, speciﬁc, and objective observations. Next, we count these events or cases and orient them to time, place, and person. Then we determine the population at risk and calculate rates of occurrences for the events or clinical cases. This requires the use of nothing more complicated than long division. We put the events or cases in the numerator according to their relevant characteristics. The next step involves using a denominator of the portion of the population at risk and characterizing this group in the same way as those in the numerator are characterized. At this point, we calculate rates of occurrence in the group of cases. These rates are then compared with the rates of occurrence in other population groups. Finally, using this information, we draw inferences about the events that deﬁne the health problem and the agent or agents that cause it. These rates also provide information about the host and the environmental factors that inﬂuence the risk of occurrence and the transmission of the health problem. Using this information and collaborating with other health professionals, we propose control measures and then continue the observations required to assess the control program. In identifying a health problem or case, many kinds of clinical examination may be employed. The patient’s history may reveal information about exposure to risk, incubation period, susceptibility, occupation, residence, course "
