CROWELL & CO., 13 AsTOR Place, 1886. z Copyright by THOMAS T. CBOWELL & 00» 1885. J. S. CusHnro & Co., Printebs, 115 HiOH Stbbbt, Boston. ' .\" ^ PREFACE § -•o*- THIS work is designed as a Dictionary of American and Eng- lish Initials and Pseudonyms employed from the beginning of the 18th century to the present time; to which have been added some of the more recent and important Continental ones, and a few false-names, which, by a strict definition of words, would be called soubriquets. A similar work by Mr. Albert R. Frey, of the Astor Library, New York City, was placed by the publishers at the writer's disposal, from which about two thousand titles were taken, and added to his own compilation, making an aggregate of twelve thousand initials and pseudonyms, and eight thousand real names of authors. Attention is called to the very complete article, by Mr. Frey, on '^ Junius,\" to be found in the first part. For the convenience of those using this dictionary, it may be well to state that the first part gives the initials and pseu- donyms, followed by the real names, of the authors, together with some representative literary performance; and the method used in indexing, with some exceptions, is to treat the literary disguises as real names, and arrange them as is customary with the latter. I.e., the last member of the initial or pseudonym is put first, and determines the alphabetical order. The second part contains the real names of authors, followed by the initials and pseudonyms, and short biographical notices. The writer has endeavored to make this work both compre- hensive and correct, and, in order to do this, has availed him- self of the Harvard University Library, and every other source IV PBEFAGE. of information to which the kindness of those interested in the undertaking has given him access, and believes he has been enabled to produce a volume that will be useful to librarians and of interest to the general reader. Notification of errors or omissions, or any information that would add to the value of the work, will be gladly received by the undersigned. WILLIAM GUSHING. Oct. 1, 1885. 18 Wendell Street, Caxbbioge, Mam. IKITIALS AND PSEUDOJSTMS. Part I. EXPLANATORY NOTE. In order to avoid confusion in regard to the method of indexing the Initial Letters, the reader will notice that when Initials are used that represent the real names of authors, the last Initial is placed first in the Index. See page 2, where A., A. H. is used for Andrew Milliard Atteridge. When Initials are used that do not represent real names, they are placed in their regular order. See page 2, where A. C. I. G. is used for A Cornishman in Gloucestershire. 1818. \" ****, Rev. John Lewis. A dissertation -on the antiquity and use of seals in England . . . L. 1740. **•*, The Late Ix>rd.
