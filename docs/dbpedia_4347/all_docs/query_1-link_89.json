The past few decades have witnessed a deluge of infectious diseases, many of which involve novel pathogens with umimaginable morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, knowledge of public health equips the public with well articulated opinions regarding crucial health issues that appear daily in the media. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular imperils the public health arena globally. This book, Pandemics and Global Health, portrays the history of pandemics, the current realm and future outlooks.

In March 2020 World Health Organization declared Covid-19 as a pandemic, which has become a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The disease has spread throughout the world mainly due to the inadequate preparedness for the global health security. Increased population mobility, rapid urbanization, climate change, weak surveillance and limited laboratory diagnostic capacity and increased human-animal interaction are also contributed to the emergence and rapid spread of pandemics which also exposed the pitfalls in the current \n\nCorresponding Author’s Email: [email protected].\n\n2\n\nNitha Balan and Manuel Thomas public health global caricature. COVID 19 pandemic revelaed the clear picture of the failure of our global helath infrastructure.The diseases demonastrates that helath security is a collective response which need adequate technical capacity, improve current global security we need a proper authority, responsiveness, expertise, evaluation, finacing etc. The currenr pandemic situation opens an opportunity to combine knowledge and skills together to rejuvenate global public health system.\n\nKeywords: pandemics, global health, epidemics, outbreaks, public health\n\nINTRODUCTION Disease outbreaks and associated drastic aftermaths have wreaked havoc since the beginning of mankind. Throughout the history, poverty, inequality and social determinants of health paves the way for the transmission of infectious diseases and existing health disparities or inequalities can further contribute to unequal burdens of morbidity and mortality irrespective of geographic region (Quinn and Kumar, 2014). The past few decades have witnessed rapid emergence of infectious diseases, creating a serious threat to global public health where Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Human Influenza A (H5N1), Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1), Ebola virus and Hanta virus are the major agents (Oswalia and Vasdev 2021). It should be noted that the human and economic toll of these and future agents are quite uncertain and unimaginable and thus a reinforcement of global public health system are pivotal for a better future.\n\nREASONS BEHIND EMERGENCE AND REEMERGENCE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES An emerging infectious disease (EID) is one that has appeared and affected a population for the first time, or has existed previously but is rapidly increasing, either in terms of the number of new cases within a\n\nPandemics and Global Health in the 21st Century\n\n3\n\npopulation, or its spread to new geographical areas (WHO, 2005). The reappearance of a previously known infection after a period of disappearance or decline in incidence is known as re-emergence (Ranga et al., 1997). The major predisposing factors in the emergence and reemergence of diseases are human, environmental, ecological and pathogen factors which play a vital role in perpetuating novel emerging pathogens. Moreover, changes in vector populations, human association with reservoir hosts and appearance of new pathogen variants with high potential in transmission are also considered as keyfactors. According to Bedford, et al., (2019) emergence of epidemics will become more tragic, frequent, complex, harder to prevent and contain rapidly changing ecology, urbanization, climate change, increased travel and fragile public health systems prevailing in lion-part of the countries. Microorganisms are talented in infecting and causing diseases among humans facing a significant and concerted threat to public health from time immemorial. These threats are amplified due to an array of factors like climate change, increased international travel, immune host response, changes in vector population etc. Constant mutation and adaptation make the microbial world drug resistant which results in many disease outbreaks. The past few decades have witnessed an overwhelming increase in the incidence of endemic diseases, epidemics, and pandemics.\n\nENDEMIC (GREEK EN MEANING IN AND DEMOS MEANING PEOPLE) Endemic diseases are diseases present permanently in a region or population. Generally, it is used to describe a disease that is present at an approximately constant level within a society or country. Each country may have a disease that is unique like Caribbean Dengue in Caribbean region (Brandling-Bennett and Penheiro, 1996) and Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) in Karnataka, India (Murhekar et al., 2015).\n\n4\n\nNitha Balan and Manuel Thomas\n\nEPIDEMIC (GREEK EPI MEANING UPON OR ABOVE AND DEMOS MEANING PEOPLE) Epidemic disease is an outbreak that affects many people at one time and can spread through one or several communities within a short span of time. When the term epidemic is used in connection with infectious diseases it is due to the sudden rise of cases usually resulting from a new infectious agent or an existing agent with mutation or expansion of geographic range (Chakrabort, 2015). The term epidemic is similar to outbreak but is commonly used to describe an unusual frequency of illness in a group of people that is not explained by expected seasonal increases (TELL ME, 2014). On the other hand, epidemics can follow predictable patterns and these trends among population.\n\nPANDEMIC (GREEK PAN MEANING ALL AND DEMOS MEANING PEOPLE) A pandemic occur when a new infectious agent, or a reemerging one, spreads across multiple continents, or even worldwide. According to the classical epidemiological definition, a pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people” (Last, 2001). Significant features of a pandemic are given below:     \n\nAffects a wider geographical area, often global Infects a very large number of people Often caused by a new pathogen or a new strain of a pathogen that has been dormant for many years Spreads quickly in humans as there is little to no existing immunity Can cause a high number of deaths\n\nPandemics and Global Health in the 21st Century \n\n5\n\nBecause of the need to control the spread of the disease, there is often social perturbation, tempestuousness, anarchy, and crippling impact on economy\n\nSTAGES OF A PANDEMIC WHO has acknowledged six phases that should be followed before declaring a disease as pandemic (WHO 2009). Phase 1 represents a low risk and phase 6 is a full-blown pandemic:   \n\n  \n\nPhase 1 - a virus is seen in animals but has not been shown to infections in humans Phase 2 - a known animal virus has caused an infection in humans Phase 3 - scattered or isolated incidence of cases or small clusters of the disease occurring in humans; possible cases of human-tohuman transmission but not at a level to cause community-level outbreaks Phase 4 - human to human transmission at a rate that causes an outbreak in communities Phase 5 - the spread of the disease between humans is now evident in more than one country Phase 6 - community-level outbreaks are in at least one additional country other than that seen in phase 5\n\nOnce Phase 6 is reached preparation should be made for a global pandemic. Each phase has an array of actions needed to be followed to facilitate transparency and awareness among public health professionals and general public.\n\n6\n\nNitha Balan and Manuel Thomas\n\nPANDEMICS AND GLOBAL HEALTH The global history of emerging or re-emerging infectious disease pandemics has proclaimed that they have appeared every decade but now, the frequency between epidemics/pandemics are alarmingly shorter as evident with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, Influenza A H1N5 (bird flu) in 2007, H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and Ebola in 2014 and the most recent member COVID 19 (Jones et al., 2008; FAO, 2020). Lion part of the developing countries has difficulties in improving public health systems at par with developed countries. Gostin and Friedman (2015) have suggested a new global health framework with vigorous and dynamic national health systems as its cornerstone and a sceptered WHO at its vertex. The establishment of UN Mission for Emergency Ebola Response (UNMEER) in 2014 is the first UN mission to respond to public health emergencies (Ebola Response, 2021). The global health architecture is increasingly under deep strain, largely due to recent, ongoing, and potential global health crises like the COVID 19. The Ebola crisis has revealed serious flaws in the capability of the national and international system to prevent and respond to these junctures. It should be noted that the health, development, and security challenges are tightly interwoven nexus and thus a multilateral system anchored in the United Nations will address these issues without any discrepancy among fellow members.\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE AND DISEASE EMERGENCE Climate is considered as an epitope of health and any climate constrains has resulted in shifts in pattern, range and intensity of infectious diseases, while weather affects the timing and power of outbreaks. Epstein et al., (1998) reported that longterm warming trend boosts geographic expansion of several diseases, while extreme weather events are engendering ‘clusters’ of disease outbreaks. A warming and\n\nPandemics and Global Health in the 21st Century\n\n7\n\nunstable climate paves the way for global emergence, resurgence and redistribution of infectious agents with epidemic proportions (Leaf, 1989). The emergence and re-emergence of neglected tropical diseases are expected in several countries where the lives of millions of people especially in developing countries will be at risk. El-Sayed and Kamel (2020) amalgamated the role of climate change in the spread of infectious agents and their vectors including viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases. Nava et al., (2017) noted that environmental changes have a deluge of impact on the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases, mostly in countries with high biodiversity and severe dissonant socio-economic and environmental issues.\n\nCONCLUSION Recent COVID 19 pandemic portrayed the hindrances in institutional silos for sound and holistic policymaking, smooth implementation, and operational capacity among national and international public health arena. The national and international developments in managing the pandemic clearly depicted an international system that is insufficiently prepared for an outbreak and reacts sluggishly to an outbreak which steps up to a global health security threat. From the beginning of mankind itself episodes of ailments outraged mankind and COVID 19 is a recent member. Thus, mounting an effective and rapid response mechanism to pandemics is the need of the hour to leapfrog not only local and national efforts but also international cooperation which embodies global solidarity and collective responsibility for forbidding and combating pandemic disease threats.\n\n8\n\nNitha Balan and Manuel Thomas\n\nREFERENCES Bedford, J., Farrar, J., Ihekweazu, C.

Epidemic involves not only infectious diseases but all that deteriorates the health of a society and can follow predictable patterns and these trends are often used to monitor, predict, and control the spread of the infection. A pandemic is an epidemic that moves across the borders of different nations. Pandemic affects the wider geographical area and affects people around the world. The causative agent, probably a virus might infect people, spread faster among communities, and may result in a huge global death toll. The world since December 2019 is in the grips of the Covid-19 virus. In this paper, an attempt has been made to pinpoint and highlight the efforts made by the state of Kerala in tackling the pandemic of all times, Covid 19.\n\nKeywords: COVID-19, epidemic, pandemic, Kerala\n\nPANDEMICS AND EPIDEMICS: AN INTRODUCTION Pandemics have always shaped civilizations. An epidemic becomes a pandemic when it moves across the boundaries of a place or a country (Physiopedia, 2020). Starting from the smallpox epidemic, moving through plague, SARS, Ebola, Zika and finally Covid-19 outbreaks, man has always been fighting with the microorganisms. Each epidemic helps mankind redefine the limits of technologies and medical science and develop novel methods of immunisation and treatment strategies. More and more pandemics keep evolving along with the changing lives of human lives. Smallpox and the Spanish Flu had the most Global death tolls. Each time a pandemic outbreak occurs; mankind finds a way to beat the causative organism. Though a pandemic is always disheartening, it brings the world together to fight. Today we have invented vaccines for Covid-19 infections, but still, the battle of mankind and the microbial world will continue forever. This chapter portrays the efficient strategies adopted by the state of Kerala that drew the appreciation of the global community.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n13\n\nCOVID-19 VIRUS: ORIGIN AND CHARACTERISTICS COVID-19 was declared a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' by World Health Organization on 30th January 2020 (WHO, 2020). The novel coronavirus infection was first reported in China's Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province in the People’s Republic of China on 31st December 2019. After that, the disease started to spread across the globe. Though the government took measures to contain the spread, the disease became a pandemic. The causative agent of this novel coronavirus infection is SARSCov2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus 2) of genus beta-corona virus. It is characterized as a mild to severe respiratory droplet infection, transmitted chiefly by contact with infectious material (such as respiratory droplets, or with objects or surfaces contaminated by the causative virus). The droplets from the respiratory tract of an infected individual are transmitted onto a mucosal surface (e.g., mouth, nose) or conjunctiva of a susceptible person, or transmitted onto environmental surfaces (Aarathi et al., 2020). The disease spread through person to person transmission. The major symptoms of the disease include severe fever, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, loss of taste and smell, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea (Cascellaet al., 2020). The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection (Huang et al., 2019). The transmission of COVID-19 occurs in four phases, namely first appearance through travellers who tested positive, then local spread, followed by community spread and finally, widespread outbreak of a pandemic (Upadhyay, 2020). Since the first occurrence of COVID-19 outside China in Thailand on 13th January 2020, even nations with effective health care systems and elaborate health care administration like the UK and the USA have quickly slipped from the stage of local spread to community transmission. Analysis of data from many countries shows extremely rapid escalation from the second stage of transmission to the third, often within weeks (Choolayil et al., 2021).\n\n14\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nKERALA: DEMOGRAPHY AND LOCAL SETTING Kerala, God's own country, the land of coconut and spices, is the thirteenth largest state in India in terms of population has 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 census (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2011; MoHFW, 2017). Simply Population density, affluent non-resident Keralites and thriving tourism all raise the risk for an outbreak in Kerala (Sulaiman et al., 2020). Kerala's airports cater to the travel needs of millions of passengers annually, in and around the world. The situation was crucial for Kerala as it is a small state with a dense population. It homes 35 million people makes it 819 people per square kilometre, eight most densely states in India. Kerala is known for its social development indicators like infant mortality rate, literacy rates, sex ratio and human development indices even though it is having a low per capita income. International travelling is a part of Kerala culture, which is connected to the rest of the world through four airports that serve around 17 million passengers annually.\n\nEPIDEMICS IN KERALA Back in the 1800s appeared one of the most alarming epidemics in Kerala history, Cholera. The then ruler of Travancore, Maharani GouriParvathyBayi started preparing for containment of the disease right when it started wreaking havoc in Bengal in the year 1819. Maharani had managed to distribute preventive medicines among the statesmen before the epidemic came to Kerala. Along with Cholera, the people of Kerala were also fighting Malaria and Smallpox during those days. The rulers of Travancore realized that local treatment methods were ineffective against the combined effects caused by the three epidemics. They then started offering allopathic treatment to the people along with local methods. During Kerala's fight with the Coronavirus, a shigella virus outbreak was reported in Kozhikode district in the third week of December 2020.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n15\n\nShigellosis, or more commonly referred to simply as a shigella infection, is an acute invasive enteric infection caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Shigella. It is “clinically manifested by diarrhoea that is frequently bloody,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The state had managed to contain the disease even though it created panic among the people.\n\nNIPAH OUTBREAKS: A LEARNING EXPERIENCE TO KERALA Kerala survived two Nipah virus outbreaks in the recent past which gave Kerala an upper hand in tackling the situation. The first reports came from the district Kozhikode, of a person with symptoms of encephalitis. Nipah virus infection (NiV), which belongs to Henipavirus, is a pathogenic zoonotic disease. (WHO, 2018). The natural reservoirs of the virus are fruit bats of the genus Pteropus, and the virus has been isolated from bat urine and partially eaten fruits in Malaysia (Chua et al., 2002). Some patients present with acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality ranges from 40% to 70%. Eighteen cases were confirmed from the districts of Kozhikode and Malappuram. The disease had a high mortality rate and spreads through person-to-person contact. Two outbreaks of the Nipah Virus gave the state a learning experience.It managed to train people to manage an immediate crisis, identify and mitigate threat situations. The skills of tracing and tracking, supportive management of highly infective critical patients, analysis of data to determine how the epidemic is progressing, prevention of healthcare-associated infections, psychosocial support to persons who are under quarantine or on treatment, working with media to avoid panic, and managing misinformation campaigns were picked up by the system during the first outbreak and rehearsed during the second. The results of the hard works of the health care system made people trust them. The ample experience during the Nipah times equipped the authorities to\n\n16\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nmanage the first wave of COVID-19 effectively (Sadanandan, 2020). Early identification, isolation of suspected people and laboratory confirmations helped the healthcare system in containing the outbreak.\n\nNOVEL CORONAVIRUS IN KERALA In India, Kerala was the first state affected by Covid-19, and the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the Thrissur district on 30th January 2020 (Jayesh et al., 2020). Two students who returned from China were identified infected. All those infected people recovered and were tested negative by 20th February 2020. Kerala successfully managed to treat the infected efficiently. Six new cases were reported in Kerala by the beginning of March 2020. This became the second wave of Covid-19 infections in Kerala. By the second wave, the number of infections in Kerala began to rise as the authorities expected. The state had already prepared for addressing the situation.\n\nHOW DID KERALA TACKLE THE PANDEMIC? Kerala Government strategized various measures to be adopted including the operating procedures for aggressive testing, contact tracing, quarantining and treatments.\n\nClose Monitoring and Screening Kerala anticipated the threat because of the Keralites living across the world that keeps travelling in and around. Kerala started its preparations when the disease was reported in China and Southeast Asia. A strict system was enforced for close monitoring and screening of people coming into the state by all means from abroad and within India.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n17\n\nEarly Diagnosis of Passengers from Abroad Kerala has around 2.4 million of its people living as emigrants in different countries, especially in Middle Eastern Countries (Economic Review, 2016). Most of the Covid-19 cases reported in Kerala were among those returned from abroad and other states, and the rest were through person-to-person transmission. People coming from abroad were screened for Covid-19 symptoms at the airports as a preliminary step. Those with symptoms were immediately shifted to Covid-19 specialised hospitals for proper treatment. Asymptomatic passengers were advised to remain on home quarantine and avoid travelling until the period of quarantine ends. They were strictly monitored through phone calls. In case they needed immediate attention; they were shifted to appropriate treatment centres, tested for infection and treated if found positive. A ‘sanitised corridor’ protocol was followed for the travellers arriving at the portal of entry to their concerned quarantine destinations with special double-chambered taxis. People found with symptoms were identified and moved to Covid-19 speciality hospitals for further treatment. They were also tested for infection and observed until they are free from the symptoms. The government created a portal call “Covid-19 Jagratha,” a comprehensive solution for real-time surveillance, care and support for people affected/quarantined by Covid-19. Covid-19 Jagratha portal provides all services for the public in case of emergency and provides information related to Covid-19 in a streamlined manner.\n\nScreening at State Borders Once the nationwide lockdown was revoked and cross border movement was initiated, natives of Kerala those who were stranded across the country were asked to register in the Covid-19 Jagratha portal to obtain travel passes. Multiple screening teams were deployed along the state borders to monitor the entry of people. Each team comprised of a\n\n18\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nsenior police official, a paramedical staff and a local volunteer. Every vehicle was monitored, details of passengers were collected and their body temperatures were recorded. This was also done at railway stations and airports (Times of India, 2020).\n\nQuarantine System and Testing Along with the world, Kerala started practising social distancing, quarantine, and self-isolation. According to CDC, social distancing also called physical distancing meaning to keep space between yourself and other people outside of your home (at least two metres). Quarantine ensures strict isolation of infected and people suspected of symptoms. Isolation is effectively done either by self-isolation at home or Government authorised Quarantine centres (CDC, 2020).\n\nSentinel Surveillance Sentinel surveillance is the monitoring of the rate of occurrence of a disease in a population in collaboration with doctors, laboratories, public health departments etc. A sentinel surveillance system was instituted in Kerala. The population was stratified into 5 categories: Group 1 – Patients in the general population with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) but NOT a COVID suspect. Group 2 – Health Care Workers in Non-COVID settings Group 3 – Persons with high social exposure: These persons were further categorized into the following; Food delivery persons, Community Volunteers for COVID, police personnel in enforcement of lockdown, provisions shop vendors ration shop, wholesale fruits or vegetable vendors. Group 4 – Category A COVID -19 Suspects: These categories of persons are those COVID suspects having sore throat or cough or rhinitis\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n19\n\nor diarrhoea and do not require testing unless there is a change in their category. Group 5 – Guest workers: Generally, are those persons from other states who have come to Kerala for labour (Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Kerala). Sentinel surveillance included random testing done in the community. It was done using RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) test (GoK Dashboard, 2020). Kerala Police and other local bodies were entrusted with this duty.\n\nIncessant Treatment Facilities for the Needy The Government of Kerala took extra efforts to provide treatment facilities to patients suffering from diseases other than Covid-19 infection, like haemophilia, thalassaemia and haemodialysis and so on. A triage system, a method of prioritizing patients' systematically according to how urgent they need care and treatment, was set up at all hospitals. Those patients showing symptoms of Covid-19 were isolated and tested.\n\nEducating the Society The major challenge the government faced was to educate the general public about the epidemic and how to go through it. The government launched a campaign called “Break the Chain” to practice social distancing and maintain personal hygiene to limit the spread of the disease to the community level. All the institutions, ATMs, buses etc were asked to maintain sanitary precautions. People were encouraged to use sanitisers, wash their hands frequently to stop the spread of the virus. The Government of Kerala implemented a lockdown even before the Central government announced the nationwide lockdown. Public gatherings including religious and non-religious gatherings were banned.\n\n20\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nAll schools and colleges except for medical colleges were closed. All festival gatherings were banned. Movie theatres and shopping malls were closed down. Only those shops selling essential items were allowed to open within the prescribed time duration, the rest of them were kept closed. All government functions were postponed. All inter-state, interdistrict, international travel was stopped (Anilkumar, 2020). People were compulsorily asked to wear face masks and avoid travel unless otherwise, it is an emergency. Inter-district travel was restricted. Emergency travel was allowed only with authorised travel passes from authorities. All the educational institutions were asked to remain closed. Offices were asked to work with minimal staff and work from home was encouraged wherever possible. The public transport system was stopped across the state.\n\nPrint, Visual and Social Media Campaigns The print, visual and social media played a pivotal role in dispersing the messages, instructions, releasing route maps of Covid-19 cases among common people. Relevant and accurate information was shared by the authorities through media to reach the public. Messages regarding the spread and prevention were made caller tune by the Telecom companies so that we would hear a message while we make a call. The Government of Kerala published many training videos for health workers on YouTube and also to promote public awareness about handwashing techniques, social distancing norms, home quarantine etc. The Kerala police also played a crucial role in campaigns and awareness by making and socialising awareness videos to circulate the message “Stay home” via the \"Break the chain\" campaign. Videos in languages other than Malayalam were also made to provide awareness messages among the guest workers. The government also took measures to counteract the spread of false information.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n21\n\nManaging Guest Workers Kerala houses about 2.5 million migrant labourers from other states of India. They are officially designated as Guest workers. Several labour camps were set to accommodate all the guest workers of the state. Camps were set up by the Kerala government to accommodate more than 3.5 lakh guest workers. Guards with multilingual knowledge were posted in labour camps for effective communication with migrant labourers. Committees were constituted to take note and address the grievances and make necessary arrangements for all basic amenities and food in collaboration with CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), LSG (Local Self Government) and other Non-Governmental Organisations. The camps were provided with all basic amenities and recreation facilities. As the guest workers disliked the traditional Kerala food provided by ‘Kudumbashree’, the desired choice of food like chapati, pickle, North Indian Dal curry and Khichdi was provided along with milk supply daily (Economic Times, 2020). A helpline number was also created to address the grievances of the guest workers. Awareness messages in all languages were given to the guest workers to ensure their safety. Timely checking was done to monitor the health of the people by the healthcare workers in collaboration with the labour department. Tele-counselling services were arranged for highly stressed workers by counsellors from TISS (Tata Institute of Social Sciences) (Official Website of Kerala Police, 2020).\n\nINFRASTRUCTURES ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM COVID Specialised Treatment Centres The State Government had converted most of the government hospitals into Covid hospitals. There were 28 hospitals exclusively dedicated for the treatment of Covid- 19 patients. Hospitals were advised\n\n22\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nto postpone all surgeries unless otherwise they are of utmost importance and people were asked to visit hospitals only in emergencies. Covid-19 isolation wards were separated so that there will be no contact between those infected and the general public. Covid First-Line Treatment Centres were set up to manage the outbreak regionally. All mild and moderate cases are treated in these centres and severe cases are referred to Covid hospitals (Health & Family Welfare Dept., 2020). Covid-care centres were also established to provide a home for people who do not have facilities for quarantine at home. These centres were provided with ample security and all basic amenities.\n\nDisha and Norka District Intervention System for Health Awareness or DISHA is a 24x7 helpline number launched in 2013 under the National Health Mission and Government of Kerala. The 16-member team is called in during crises. They had been actively involved in the outreach work of the recent floods in Kerala, the Nipah outbreak, the Ockhi cyclone and so on (\"DISHA,\" 2013). Disha team played a crucial role in managing distress calls from the people. They managed to provide 24x7 psychosocial support to the people in need. The team also had doctors who were available to answer the queries of the people. Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs (NORKA), the division managing the affairs of Keralites staying outside the state, has been in the process of bringing expatriates back with priority given to pregnant women, people who need medical assistance, the elderly and people with an expired visa. Over 3 lakh non-resident Keralites have registered on Norka so far (Mathrubhumi, 2020).\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n23\n\nMANPOWER SUPPORT SYSTEM INVOLVED Kerala Police The lockdown, containment, and surveillance actions imposed by Kerala Police were noteworthy. To monitor lockdown enforcement, drones and exclusive women police bullet patrol teams have been deployed. Active monitoring was enforced at railway stations and airports. To confine the movement of the general public, a geo-fencing app was set up and checkpoints were set up along with mobile and foot patrolling. Interstate and inter-district borders were sealed off. Police were accountable for supplying essential travel passes through an online pass system. Kerala Police developed a \"Road Vigil app for monitoring the movement of vehicles during lockdown period (Official Website of Kerala Police, 2020).\n\nAsha Workers and Kudumbashree Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), who are community health volunteers, approximate one for every 1000 to1500 population (Menon et al., 2020). ASHA workers were entrusted with the duty of informing if anyone violated the quarantine regulations. They, along with the health workers, conducted regular household surveys. Also, they were entrusted with communicating information to the public. ‘Kudumbashree’ units are part of women empowerment programmes of the Government of Kerala. The programme was launched in the year 1997. ‘Kudumbashree units’ in Kerala, a women self-help group under the leadership of Local Self Government, is one of the largest women empowering projects in the country. They were involved in the production of safety equipment, cook and provide food for the needy, serve the elderly and other needy persons. Community Kitchen initiative is regarded as one of the notable services rendered by Kudumbashree units.\n\n24\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nVolunteering Services People with experience in relief operations during the flood and other crises joined hands even during the covid-19 emergency. Volunteers were catered with proper directions through registered apps and videos (GoK Dashboard, 2020). They were involved in supplying food, medicines, groceries and also assisting people in need.\n\nPRESENT SCENARIO OF THE STATE During the early stages, the state had received international acclaim in controlling the virus. The number of infections began to rise in July and reached a peak almost by October. Despite the hard work, the state reported the highest number of cases in India with a high-test positivity rate during February 2021. As the test positivity rate keeps vacillating, the Government have decided to ramp up the testing through Government laboratories to achieve 1 lakh Covid-19 tests per day, in which 75,000 tests should be RT PCR (GoK, Heath & Family Welfare (F) Department, 2021). Infection transmissions occurred mainly through the intermingling of people. To slow down the rate of transmission, the Government had initiated a “Back to the Basics” campaign in response to the current context of the upward trend of positive cases. The campaign entails strategies for the prevention and control of Covid-19 in a renewed manner. The campaign aims to revive and adhere to all the Covid-19 prevention measures laid down by the Government. The ‘OttakallaOppamundu’ is a program launched by the government for providing Psychosocial support to the people in quarantine, isolation, school children and other categories of the population as well as to the community in general. The test positivity rate in the state is 10.6 per cent as of 1st February 2021 (Weekly Bulletin, 2021). The rate has dropped to 3.05 per cent by the second week of March 2021. This reduction is achieved by the diligent efforts of the Government, including the increase in testing those suspected with symptoms.\n\nEpidemics and Pandemics: The Kerala Model\n\n25\n\nThe Government of India almost completed the mission of Vaccination drive across India for its 3 crore Health workers and Frontline workers starting from 16th January 2021. The next set of people in queue is the 27-crore people who are of age above 50 and those below 50 years of age and co-morbidities. Covishield from Serum Institute of India which is based on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech is being administered to the people (The Hindu, 2021). The Government of Kerala constituted the State Steering Committee, State task Force, District Task Force and Block Task Force for policy initiatives and coordination and implementation of COVID-19 vaccine introduction (GoK, HFW, 2021). The State began its second phase of COVID-19 vaccination on 1st March 2021. The Health Department has communicated that those aged 60 years and above and others aged between 45 and 59 years with co-morbidities can register during this phase. Private hospitals are also included in administering the Covid vaccine to the General Public. Those who are eligible for the vaccination in this phase can register themselves on the government's portal, Co-WIN (a digital platform that was formed for real-time monitoring of COVID19 vaccine delivery) for the same (Times Now news, 2021). In Kerala, around 300 private hospitals have been identified for the second phase. These hospitals can charge up to Rs 250 for a single dose. Government authorisedcentres will provide the vaccine to the public free of cost.\n\nCONCLUSION Kerala is like any other state and has nothing extraordinary. The state has managed and coordinated all the available facilities to tackle the situation. Kerala's efficient health care system, the Police, the Local selfGovernment bodies, NGOs, self-help groups and voluntary workers, all joined hands for the state to fight the Covid-19 virus. Also, the learning experience from the past floods and Nipah outbreak aided the state in managing the scenario. Till the beginning of the second wave, Kerala was successful in containing the disease. But at a later stage, the authorities\n\n26\n\nRogimon P. Thomas, Sreeja Raj, V. Vinod et al.\n\nand the public were less vigilant of the preventive measures, and it resulted in the heightening of Covid cases. The present situation in Kerala has implications for the nation at large. Hence it is the nation’s responsibility, not just of the state, to launch all possible measures in controlling the COVID- 19 situations in Kerala. The Union health ministry and other relevant ministries must back up the Kerala government in a big way to bring down the number of cases. The state requires re-defining its past strategies and scheming and fashioning new plans and strategies to go back to normal. Kerala has always maintained a position of leadership in the vaccine compliance list of the universal immunisationprogramme. Vaccination must be done in a priority-based manner such as; the maximum number of at-risk individuals, which includes health care workers, other front line workers, and individuals older than 50 and those below 50 years who have comorbidities. A collaborative effort of all the current strategies will show a decline in the number of COVID cases in a controllable manner.\n\nREFERENCES Aiyappa, V (2020). ‘Kerala Police: A Model Policing Paradigm in Handling COVID-19’.

Is there any satisfactory technological advancement to identify the pandemic diseases of international travelers in the context of the developed stage of diaspora? 2. How the advanced technological development catalyzed the intensity and speed of dispersal mechanism of pandemic disease outbreaks like COVID-19? 3. Is there any apt security against pandemics among nations and how will it be formed? It was observed that, during the COVID-19 period, the immediate response of science and technology was not sufficient to ensure the security of the people in the context of diaspora. Even though nations had successfully developed bio-weapons through technological advancement, they had failed to guarantee security consciousness to their people. The diaspora of the present century is facing the extreme challenge of pandemic diseases because of the poor predictive mechanism on the evolution of microbes in the climatic changing scenario.\n\nKeywords: pandemic, technological advancement, diaspora, virtual vector\n\nINTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (WHO) has alarmed the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a global pandemic (Lau et al. 2020). All nations were frightened due to its accelerated dispersion among the continents. It could make a drastic decline in the social and economic development of the world. Medical technology advancement has been stressful to stop the transboundary dispersal but in contrast, aviation technology acted as a ‘virtual vector’ of coronavirus. As a result of the lack of intelligent measure and policies, migrants of different countries turn to panic and that lead to the rush return to the homeland which ultimately leads to the diffusion of the virus in every continent literally. The attack of the virus named COVID-19 started in Wuhan in December 2019 and it spread to the rest of China and then to the whole world (Kraemer et al. 2020). The causative organism of this pandemic is Coronavirus, distributed in humans, mammals, and birds can cause\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n33\n\nrespiratory, intestinal, hepatic, and nervous system diseases (Perlman et al. 2020). Due to its variable incubation period, it was difficult to identify its rapid spreading (Poletto et al. 2014) and it overrides the age barriers of people. Due to its virulence and air transmission mechanism, approximately 119,609,831 people were infected and a death toll of 2,651,700 lives around the world as of 13th March 2021. The period of COVID-19 is historically relevant in the context of Human diaspora because this pandemic affected adversely in all levels of migration and its allied sector especially, low-income job migrants. Around the spreading range, the highest number of migrants including countries affected this pandemic in the high level of range and due to this fall down the international migrants and remittances such as 31% and 37% respectively by this pandemic (GMDAC analysis based on UN DESA, 2020; World Bank, 2020a; WHO, 2021). COVID 19 pandemic affected the transboundary migrants and the international migrants account for 3.4% of the world population, especially the international migrants of these 20 nations, between 11 March 2020 to 22 February 2021 (IOM, 2021). The economic emergency induced by COVID‐19 could be long, bottomless, and inescapable when observed through an emigration lens. An exponential development happened in the case of law and policies making against COVID-19 such as lockdown breakage of transboundary journey distancing etc were led to an economic depression in worldwide. Host nations faced supplementary challenges in many sectors, such as health and agriculture that depended on the obtainability of migrant workers. Migrants faced the threat of infection and also the possible loss of employment, wages, and health insurance coverage (World Bank, 2020). India is an important nation of origin for international immigrants with about 17 million emigrants according to the latest assessments released by the United Nations (2019). Every year a large number of people from India go abroad for overseas employment and study purposes. This chapter analyses the migration status of international and national scenario, state-level accounts in the context of COVID-19 and\n\n34\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\nalso try to point out the connection of aviation and COVID-19 spread. This analysis elucidates a clear virtual connection among migrants, aviation, and covid-19.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IN THE WORLD The ability to spread the pattern of the coronavirus can hold 210 nations of the world and hit around two million people worldwide [Appendix -1]. Without following covid prevention measures like social distancing and lack of abdicating instruments leads to more adverse conditions among migrants in the United States of America (Tharoor, 2020). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the key challenge that healthcare systems around the world are presently facing (WHO 2021). The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and pathogenic viral infection caused by unembellished acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China, and blow-out around the world (Shereen et al. 2020). The novel coronavirus (termed 2019-nCoV) was testified in December 2019 from the genomic screening of clinical samples from patients with viral Pneumonia in Wuhan, China. The primary viral pneumonia patients were found to be epidemiologically linked to the Huanan seafood marketplace in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, where other non-aquatic animals, such as bats, pangolins, and rabbits, were on sale before the outbreak (Dietz et al. 2019, Tan et al. 2020, Zhu et al. 2020, Sofi et al. 2020). Through the use of next-generation sequencing, a new human infecting coronavirus, provisionally called the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019nCoV), was identified. Subsequently, on February 11, 2020, an outbreak or disease previously known as “novel coronavirus” or 2019-nCoV was officially renamed as C-O-V-I-D-19 or COVID-19, and the causal virus was named as “severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2” or SARS-CoV-2 (Sofi et al. 2020, WHO 2020) and this virus spread around the world (210 nations) by the movement of human and a drastic decline happened in the all-developmental sectors in the world.\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n35\n\nCORONAVIRUS HIT INTENSITY INDUCED BY POPULATION DISPERSAL INTENSITY Migration, urban population growth, and high population density are considered major factors (Connolly et al. 2020) for the spreading of pandemics. China has experienced large-scale migration in recent decades (Shen 2018; Chan 2014). Return migration range of early 2020 can assume to assess the migration to the Hubai province between 20102015 (Jianfa, 2020). Many travelers came back to their native place by the declaration of lockdown by the Chinese government before the spring holiday. Within 30 days coronavirus spread over from Wuhan to every province in China in 2019 (Gao et al. 2020). After that, it was confirmed outside on 13th January 2020 in Bangkok (Thailand) (WHO, 2020, Gennaro et al, 2020) On the 2nd March 2020, 67 territories outside mainland China had reported 8565 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 132 deaths, as well as substantial community transmission were seen in several countries worldwide, including Iran and Italy and it was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on the 11th March 2020 (Hsu, et al. 2020, Gennaro et al. 2020). The number of confirmed cases has been constantly increased worldwide and after Asian and European regions, a steep increase was being observed in low-income countries (WHO, 2020). Based on the migration status, Wuhan had verboten all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23, 2020, this is maybe the largest quarantine/movement constraint in human history to avert infectious disease spread (Tian et al. 2020). It could maintain control over hundreds of millions of Chinese residents, including 9 million Wuhan residents’ reduction of inter and intra-city movements. Due to the Wuhan lock-down (Yuan et al. 2020), Read et al. (2020) proposed that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel led to reducing 24.9% on February. There they had a 10-day delay in between infection and detection, which means that about a 5-day incubation period and an average 5- day delay from symptom commencement to\n\n36\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\ndetection of a case (Imai et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020). Around five million migrants turn back to their native destination before lockdown and they consider as potential disease spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in the early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreaks (Chen et al. 2020). The outbreak in China was largely under control by the end of March 2020. Kraemer et al. (2020) found a positive correlation between the COVID-19 cases and the population flow from Wuhan.\n\nPRESENT SCENARIO OF COVID-19 IN THE WORLD The sum of confirmed cases is increasing every day with the obtainability of swift testing kits. This pandemic is going to impact harshly in the socio-economic and psychological aspects. COVID-19 is being considered as overwhelming as the World influenza epidemic of 1918 (Jahangir et al. 2020). The light of the above table can illustrate the following contents about the spread of this disease from one nation to another. According to the following table, 118852593 cases were reported in the world while this time and 94379293 recovery cases were also reported by WHO but 2635511 deaths were reported all over the world on 8thMarch 2021 (Table 1).

The majority of countries in the world implemented travel restrictions, lockdowns and other measures to prevent the spreading of corona virus (Monmousseau et al. 2020, Suzumura et al., 2020, White House, 2020, European Council,\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n43\n\n2020, Iacus et al. (2020). Italy was the first country to enforce a national lockdown (World Atlas, 2020) from March 9th, 2020 to February 21st, 2020 an initial measure confining only the northern region of Lodi (Monmousseau et al. 2020). Followed by the EU officially closed the external borders of 26 of its member states to nearly all non-EU residents on March 17th, 2020 (New York Times 2020, Monmousseau et al. 2020). The top five nations with the largest number of infected people were the USA, Brazil, Russian Federation, India and UK (WHO, 2020. Bindu and Indu, 2020). Airports Council International (ACI) prophesied that COVID-19 can wipe out two-fifths of passenger traffic and half of the airport incomes in 2020 (ACI, 2020). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assessment that during the first half of 2020, compared to their original forecast, showed an overall reduction of 47% to 58% of seats offered by airlines and face loss of around 112 to 135 billion USD (ICAO, 2020. Sanchez et al. 2020). Comprehensive information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively authenticating and prospectively envisaging case emergence in other countries. For the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, 24 countries had authoritatively described cases by the first week of February 2019. All of the first reports in these countries had travel antiquity to China (mostly to Wuhan city of Hubei province) and also, they assess the global importation risk of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for other countries based on travel to China (Adiga et al. 2020). Brockmann (2020), clearly demonstrated the risk factor of COVID-19 in the context of pandemic disaster by the aviation industry of the world and they consider the time and distance from the epicenter of COVID-19. According to Adiga et al. (2020) COVID-19 pandemic spread induced by the aviation sector could be simply imagined by the transportation network of around 4000 airports in the world (Adiga et al. 2020). Brockmann (2020) observed the potential of this pandemic by using 2019 data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and identified all cities in China that received at least 100000 airline passengers from Wuhan during February through April 2019. In a\n\n44\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\nscenario where these cities might experience local epidemics, analyzed the volumes of airline passengers to international destinations from February to April 2019 and reported that around 50 international cities contribute the number of migrants to the mainland of China. And another necessary observation is that the analyzed international airline passenger trips from the following 10 cities: Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Kunming, Chengdu, Xiamen, Haikou, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. The migrants return from the city by using connecting flights e.g., Taipei (1359253), Bangkok (1232307), Tokyo (1086105), Seoul (1008960) and Singapore (751 064). 90% of the passengers were received by Asia, with London, the UK ranked 10th in volume (252 127). Other nations include Paris (142724 passengers) and Moscow (114925 passengers). Sydney (242577) passengers, while Los Angeles (184808), New York (148133) and San Francisco (140556) received the highest volumes to North American destinations. Cairo (62470) is the one and only migrants received nation in Africa (50 destinations). Table 2.

Because the topmost affected countries have more potential to spread disease to the other region\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n45\n\nbecause of the high number of airport and air services. Good health incorporates mental, social and physical comfort. The field of migration and health encompasses health apprehensions arising from human agility, such as the transmission of transferrable diseases, and should engross with all aspects of well-being in the framework of migration and with totally who are affected, including families of migrants and the public fitness of communities with whom migrants interrelate during all phases of the migration journey (World migration report 2020) (Table 2).\n\nA VIRTUAL RELATIONSHIP OF COVID-19, AVIATION AND MIGRATION IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT Epidemic in India Epidemic waves affected people and also their humanity. The return of migrants may bring disease into the native region and the same occasion happened in the 1980s in the case of HIV/AIDs and the population became risk (Maharatna, 2014, BBC, 2020, Bhagat et al. 2020). In a different period, pandemic disease adversely affected people’s life as well as the global economy. Migrants may be the carriers of diseases or a part of a disease outbreak because of their borderless long journey. Different period’s pandemic diseases adversely affected migration and also the global economy. Such examples of the pandemic are Smallpox epidemic (1974), Cholera (1910-1911, Death- 8,00,000), Spanish Flu (1918 – 1920, Death-17-18 million Indians), Plague in Surat (1994), SARS (2002- 2004), Dengue and Chikungunya Outbreak (2006), Swine flu outbreak (2014-2015, Death-2000 Indians), Nipah Virus outbreak (2018) and the very end of 2019 COVID, 19 emerged. COVID19 has rapidly spread worldwide by travelers or migrants coming from the epicentre of the outbreak or countries with reported cases. COVID-19 has been confirmed on all continents, including in the European Union\n\n46\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\n(EU) countries and has already caused victims in the EU. European Centre for Prevention and Control assessed the risk for people travelling within the EU as high, especially from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The world spread of COVID19 pandemic disease also largely affected the workers due to the shutdown of factories and workplaces in India. Millions of migrant workers also faced issues like loss in their income, food scarcity and uncertainty about the future. However, necessary steps have been taken by the government with the support of citizens and are trying to reduce socioeconomic impact.\n\nLockdown and Interstate Migration Lockdown is essential to prevent pandemics and pollution but before the implementation necessary apt arrangements should cover otherwise it will badly affect poor people. According to the Shahas (2020) study revealed that migrants from north-central India show that the majority of the workers were the daily wage earners and they faced many adverse conditions such as lack of food, shelter, no identity card and angry from police and local people because of a notion of feeling against the covid spread. (India Today, 2020). In India, mass return migration to the homeland could be seen by challenging all difficulties. The very effort to stave off the pandemic turned into one of the greatest human tragedies in India’s recent history (Bhagat et al. 2020). Migrant workers stood as the backbone of the Indian economy. There were permanent and semi-permanent workers (15 million and 194 million) among the migrants (482 million) in India (Keshri and Bhagat, 2012). For life sustenance, many of them came to the urban sector for employment and contribute a significant account in urban population (50%) and interstate migrants also have an essential role in it (1/5 of the urban population). Around 53 million came from the rural sector and tried to take part in urban development. Out of 53 million-plus cities, eight of them are mega-cities with a population of 5 million and more\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n47\n\n(Bhagat et al. 2020). In general, in-migration rates were higher in highincome states such as Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Punjab, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka, whereas low-income states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Odisha reported relatively higher rates of outmigration (Bhagat et al. 2020). Due to the absence of transportation facilities, millions of migrant labours started their exodus to their native places. States like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Bihar have looked into the situation and had arranged transport buses to help the workers reach their homes. But this massive transportation had resulted in a problematic situation and increased misunderstanding between the states. As this was a violation of and a threat to the benefits of lockdown and was risky for them and people in the villages, the Government of India gave a licensed order to seal all borders and make necessary arrangements like temporary shelters, food, clothes etc. (Press Trust of India, 2020; Government of India, 2020).\n\nThe Indian Diaspora According to the United Nations (2019), there have 17 million international migrants from India and also the top remittance (USD 78.6 billion) received nation (World Migration Report 2020). Indian migrants mainly focused on the United States of America, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E, United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Singapore, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Thailand, and New Zealand. But some skilled, semiskilled and students focused on USA, UK, Canada, Australia etc., where labour and employment laws are well defined and emigrants’ interests are well protected under the local law, a considerable proportion of the emigrants from India are less educated and less or semi-skilled workers migrating to Gulf countries. According to the United Nation, around 3% of the world population migrated from poor to rich countries, poor to poor countries, rich to rich countries and rich to poor countries by political and economic existence.\n\n48\n\nShaibu Jacob, P.

The Indian diaspora has a promoter for economic development in both within India as well as the migrated nations. Indian diaspora has its own scope; an expatriate is migrated to the foreign land from their own territories. Around 20 million Indian people are spread over the globe, and it constitutes an important strengthening of the world culture.\n\nHow Is COVID-19 Hitting India? The first case of COVID-19 surfaced in India on January 30, 2020, and following out-break the lockdown in the entire country was announced on 24th March for a period of 21 days (Bhagat et al. 2020). Kerala has the top migration rate among other Indian states (Bhagat et al. 2013). The lockdown directly affects the migrants and states economies of all nations (The Indian Express, 2020). To mitigate the effect of the lockdown on the vulnerable groups, the Government of India on 26 March 2020, announced a 70-lakh crore package under the Pradhan Mantri Gareeb KalyanYojana. Both governments decided to spend 52000 crores of the Building and Construction Workers Welfare Fund for relief work. (DBT) (DHNS, 2020; Government of India, 2020). The Ministry of health and family welfare (08 March 2021) had revealed a clear picture of the COVID-19 affected states/UT and its range. According to this 188747, active cases and 10882798 people of India were affected by COVID-19. By coronavirus attack 157853 life was lost in India. All details are illustrated in the following Table 3.\n\nCOVID-19 and Return Migration in the Indian Context Considering the COVID-19 affected countries, India stands on the top 5 infected nations in the world. However, India has taken effective measures to regulate the pandemic and boost the economy. However, the\n\n50\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\nsudden stoppage of movements of people and the suspension of travel has drastically influenced the tourism and aviation industry in India (Bindu and Indu, 2020). The government of India has taken necessary precautions for preventing the COVID-19 outbreak so the nationwide lockdown was implemented on 25th March that was extended to 7th June 2020 and on 13 March 2020, all visas were suspended except diplomatic and other official visas (Chanana, 2020). In India, the borders were sealed to break down borderless travel by lockdown (Bindu and Indu, 2020). As the initiative of central and states governments, many of the migrants came back to their home land. In this mission, two- way approach was done by concerned governments with the help of the Indian navy and airlines. The first mission was taken by the Indian navy named ‘SamudraSetu’ and the second mission is Vande Bharath Mission (VBM).\n\n‘Samudra Setu’ and Return Migration In India ‘Samudra Setu’ is the first program to initiate for evacuating Indian migrants from other nations and it was completed on May 5, 2020. By this attempt around 3992 Indian migrants were reached their homeland. In this operation participated four ships of the Indian Navy named Shardul, Magar, Jalashwa and Airavat and travelled around 23,000 km. The details are given in the table (Table 4). Table 4.

Air India, Air India Express, and Indigo became part of it. As per MoCA, by June 23rd, 2020, a total of 681 inbound flights brought back 1, 29,339 passengers to India while a total of 686 outbound flights carried 45,095 passengers to their respective countries. On March 22, the international flights were suspended by India, followed by domestic air transport services on 24th March (Table 5). Table 5.

Globalization, demographic alterations, conflicts, earnings inequalities and climate change encourage many workers, and their\n\n52\n\nShaibu Jacob, P. S. Ajith, M. B. Arya et al.\n\nfamilies to cross boundaries in search of employment and safety. India is a foremost country of origin and transit, as well as a popular terminus, for workers crossways international borders. There are 30 million Indians migrants but 9% of the Indian migrants were focused on the gulf region. In the context of eligibility90% of the migrants are included in low and semi-skilled workers but limited data is available in this sector. That is, labour migration data is available mostly for workers who have to register for emigration clearance (Wadhawan 2018). As far as the majority of Indian migrants are concerned, they depend on the pull factor in that point of view, the Indian migrants have specific corridors.\n\nDiaspora of Kerala towards COVID-19 and Vande Baharat Mission COVID-19 in Kerala Context The first case of coronavirus was reported in Kerala on January 30, 2020. Only three were reported in the first phase. The patients were properly quarantined in the hospital and treated. No other persons were affected by them. The second phase of COVİD-19 was started by Italian migrants who allegedly escaped from the airport testing facility. By the end of March, the number of active cases crossed a hundred. Kerala then resorted to complete lockdown. The next day, the Government of India also pronounced country-wide lockdown until April 15 which later extended multiple times until May 31 (Jayesh and Sreedharan 2020). On March 23, Kerala announced a state-wide lockdown until March 31 (India Today, 2020). A day later, the central government announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown until April 15 (CGO 2020). And also extended the lockdown until May 3, which further extended until May 31 (Jayesh and Sreedharan 2020). Kerala government makes prevention against COVID-19 through social mobilization under the leadership of Kerala health ministry. This process can be done in light of the experience of Nipa outbreaks in 2018 (Sadanandan 2020). Kerala became the model for a comprehensive\n\nHuman Diaspora and Pandemics\n\n53\n\nstrategy made and implemented against COVID-19 pandemic, in this context world attention initially turned to Kerala. (Issac & Sadanandan, 2020; Rajan, 2020c; Vijayan, 2020). Around 5 million migrants work outside the state among these 2.5 million works in COVID-19 affected nations like gulf countries (Jalan and Sen 2020). The way of approach of the Kerala government against COVID-19 can be considered as a benchmark for how the public health department can be utilized properly (Jayesh and Sreedharan 2020). Kerala captured the attention of Worldwide Media and was appreciated for the efficient management of COVID-19 (Jayesh and Sreedharan 2020, CGO 2020, KGO 2020). The present situation of Kerala in the context of COVID-19 is illustrated in the following table. According to it, there are 37150 active cases, and the total case reported in Kerala is 1081055. The efficient health work could cure 1116281 no: of persons and the total number of persons in quarantine are 166107. Unfortunately, 4328 deaths were reported by COVID-19. The following statics are based on the Kerala government updates until 09-03-2021. The district-wise details are illustrated in Table 6. Table 6.
