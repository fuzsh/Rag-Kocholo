To date, this page goes back to 1961, and we will continue to build the content of this page to include earlier graduates (all 125 years back, as much as will be possible). Please return occasionally to monitor our progress. If you want to be added without any delay, please email the S&T Chemistry Department with your information (name, degree and year) and you will be added in a jiffy and on the double. And here is an important point: We will highlight your name on this page in bold face if you provide us with your current contact information (which we will not post) and information about your current employment (which we would like to post if you allow us to do so). If you want to update us on what you are up to, fill out the form here."
