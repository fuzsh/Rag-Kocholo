Patient-reported outcomes (PRO), consisting of responses to single questions about TJ global status on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; TJ global score), function on a 100-mm VAS (TJ function score), and pain on a 5-point Likert scale (TJ pain score) were piloted in 66 inflammatory arthritis subjects in a phase 1/2 clinical study of an intraarticular gene transfer agent and compared to physical examination measures (TJ swelling, TJ tenderness) and validated function questionnaires (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scale, Rheumatoid Arthritis Outcome Score, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire). Construct validity was assessed by evaluating the correlation between the single-joint outcome measures and validated function questionnaires using Spearman's rank correlation. Responsiveness or sensitivity to change was assessed through calculating effect size and standardized response means (SRM). Reliability of physical examination measures was assessed by determining interobserver agreement. The single-joint PRO were highly correlated with each other and correlated well with validated functional measures. The TJ global score exhibited modest effect size and modest SRM that correlated well with the patient's assessment of response on a 100-mm VAS. Physical examination measures exhibited high interrater reliability, but correlated less well with validated functional measures and the patient's assessment of response. Single-joint PRO, particularly the TJ global score, are simple to administer and demonstrate construct validity and responsiveness in patients with inflammatory arthritis.

C.; Poolman, R. W.; Scholtes, V. A. B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjectives Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are often used to evaluate the outcome of treatment in patients with distal radial fractures. Which PROM to select is often based on assessment of measurement properties, such as validity and reliability. Measurement properties are assessed in clinimetric studies, and results are often reviewed without considering the methodological quality of these studies. Our aim was to systematically review the methodological quality of clinimetric studies that evaluated measurement properties of PROMs used in patients with distal radial fractures, and to make recommendations for the selection of PROMs based on the level of evidence of each individual measurement property. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMbase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases to identify relevant clinimetric studies. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies on measurement properties, using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Level of evidence (strong / moderate / limited / lacking) for each measurement property per PROM was determined by combining the methodological quality and the results of the different clinimetric studies. Results In all, 19 out of 1508 identified unique studies were included, in which 12 PROMs were rated. The Patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) and the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) were evaluated on most measurement properties. The evidence for the PRWE is moderate that its reliability, validity (content and hypothesis testing), and responsiveness are good. The evidence is limited that its internal consistency and cross-cultural validity are good, and its measurement error is acceptable. There is no evidence for its structural and criterion validity. The evidence for the DASH is moderate that its responsiveness is good. The evidence is limited that its reliability and the\n\nDevelopment, reliability, and validity of the Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project Parental Outcome Measure.\n\nPubMed\n\nBemister, Taryn B; Brooks, Brian L; Kirton, Adam\n\n2014-07-01\n\nPerinatal stroke is a leading cause of cerebral palsy and lifelong disability, although parent and family outcomes have not yet been studied in this specific population. The Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project Parental Outcome Measure was developed as a 26-item questionnaire on the impact of perinatal stroke on parents and families. The items were derived from expert opinion and scientific literature on issues salient to parents of children with perinatal stroke, including guilt and blame, which are not well captured in existing measures of family impact. Data were collected from 82 mothers and 28 fathers who completed the Parental Outcome Measure and related questionnaires (mean age, 39.5 years; mean child age, 7.4 years). Analyses examined the Parental Outcome Measure's internal consistency, test-retest reliability, validity, and factor structure. The Parental Outcome Measure demonstrated three unique theoretical constructs: Psychosocial Impact, Guilt, and Blame. The Parental Outcome Measure has excellent internal consistency (Cronbach Î± = 0.91) and very good test-retest reliability more than 2-5 weeks (r = 0.87). Regarding validity, the Parental Outcome Measure is sensitive to condition severity, accounts for additional variance in parent outcomes, and strongly correlates with measures of anxiety, depression, stress, quality of life, family functioning, and parent adjustment. The Parental Outcome Measure contributes to the literature as the first brief measure of family impact designed for parents of children with perinatal stroke. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Defining and validating a measure of safety contributes to further validation of clinical measures. The objective was to define and examine the psychometric properties of the outcome âincidents of harm.â Methods. The Incident of Harm Caregiver Questionnaire was administered to caregivers of older adults discharged from hospital by telephone. Caregivers completed daily logs for one month and medical charts were examined. Results. Test-retest reliability (n = 38) was high for the occurrence of an incident of harm (yes/no; kappa = 1.0) and the type of incident (agreement = 100%). Validation against daily logs found no disagreement regarding occurrence or types of incidents. Validation with medical charts found no disagreement regarding incident occurrence and disagreement in half regarding incident type. Discussion. The data support the Incident of Harm Caregiver Questionnaire as a reliable and valid estimation of incidents for this sample and are important to researchers as a method to measure safety when validating clinical measures.

Methods Recruitment of an osteoarthritis sample and a comparison general population (GP) through an Internet survey panel. Pain intensity, pain interference, physical functioning, and fatigue were assessed for 4 consecutive weeks with PROMIS short forms on a daily basis and compared with same-domain Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) instruments that use a 7-day recall. Known group validity (comparison of OA and GP), ecological validity (comparison of aggregated daily measures with CATs), and test-retest reliability were evaluated. Results The recruited samples matched (age, sex, race, ethnicity) the demographic characteristics of the U.S. sample for arthritis and the 2009 Census for the GP. Compliance with repeated measurements was excellent: > 95%. Known group validity for CATs was demonstrated with large effect sizes (pain intensity: 1.42, pain interference: 1.25, and fatigue: .85). Ecological validity was also established through high correlations between aggregated daily measures and weekly CATs (â¥ .86). Test-retest validity (7-day) was very good (â¥ .80). Conclusion PROMIS CAT instruments demonstrated known group and ecological validity in a comparison of osteoarthritis patients with a general population sample. Adequate test-retest reliability was also observed. These data provide encouraging initial data on the utility of these PROMIS instruments for clinical and research outcomes in osteoarthritis patients.

This study examined the validity and reliability of the newly developed Brighton musculoskeletal Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (BmPROM) within physiotherapy outpatient settings. Two hundred twenty-four patients attending physiotherapy outpatient departments in South East England with an MSK condition participated in this study. The BmPROM was assessed for user friendliness (rated feedback, NÂ =Â 224), reliability (internal consistency and test-retest reliability, nÂ =Â 42), validity (internal and external construct validity, NÂ =Â 224), and responsiveness (internal, nÂ =Â 25). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that a two-factor model provides a good fit to the data. Factors were representative of \"Functionality\" and \"Wellbeing\". Correlations observed between the BmPROM and SF-36 domains provided evidence of convergent validity. Reliability results indicated that both subscales were internally consistent with alphas above the acceptable limits for both \"Functionality\" (Î±Â =Â .85, 95% CI [.81, .88]) and 'Wellbeing' (Î±Â =Â .80, 95% CI [.75, .84]). Test-retest analyses (nÂ =Â 42) demonstrated a high degree of reliability between \"Functionality\" (ICCÂ =Â .84; 95% CI [.72, .91]) and \"Wellbeing\" scores (ICCÂ =Â .84; 95% CI [.72, .91]). Further examination of test-retest reliability through the Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the difference between \"Functionality\" and \"Wellbeing\" test scores did not vary as a function of absolute test score. Large treatment effect sizes were found for both subscales (Functionality dÂ =Â 1.10; Wellbeing 1.03). The BmPROM is a reliable and valid outcome measure for use in evaluating physiotherapy treatment of MSK conditions.

Method Participating families' children (n=97; 68 males, 29 females; mean age 2y 8mo; SD 1.04y, range 10moâ4y 11mo) were recruited through eight Canadian organizations. The children were on a waiting list for speech and language intervention. Parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire â Social/Emotional (ASQ-SE) and the FOCUS three times: at assessment and at the start and end of treatment. A second sample (n=28; 16 males 12 females) was recruited from another organization to correlate the FOCUS scores with speech, intelligibility and language measures. Second sample participants ranged in age from 3 years 1 month to 4 years 9 months (mean 3y 11mo; SD 0.41y). At the start and end of treatment, children were videotaped to obtain speech and language samples. Parents and speechâlanguage pathologists (SLPs) independently completed the FOCUS tool. SLPs who were blind to the pre/post order of the videotapes analysed the samples. Results The FOCUS measured significantly more change (p<0.01) during treatment than during the waiting list period. It demonstrated both convergent and discriminant validity against the ASQ-SE. The FOCUS change corresponded to change measured by a combination of clinical speech and language measures (Îº=0.31, p<0.05). Conclusion The FOCUS shows strong construct validity as a change-detecting instrument.

There is no treatment for any form of CMT although clinical trials are increasingly occurring. Patients usually develop symptoms during the first two decades of life but there are no established outcome measures of disease severity or response to treatment. We identified a set of items that represent a range of impairment levels and conducted a series of validation studies to build a patient-centered multi-item rating scale of disability for children with CMT. Methods As part of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium, patients aged 3â20 years with a variety of CMT types were recruited from the USA, UK, Italy and Australia. Initial development stages involved: definition of the construct, item pool generation, peer review and pilot testing. Based on data from 172 patients, a series of validation studies were conducted, including: item and factor analysis, reliability testing, Rasch modeling and sensitivity analysis. Results Seven areas for measurement were identified (strength, dexterity, sensation, gait, balance, power, endurance), and a psychometrically robust 11-item scale constructed (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Pediatric Scale: CMTPedS). Rasch analysis supported the viability of the CMTPedS as a unidimensional measure of disability in children with CMT. It showed good overall model fit, no evidence of misfitting items, no person misfit and it was well targeted for children with CMT. Interpretation The CMTPedS is a well-tolerated outcome measure that can be completed in 25-minutes. It is a reliable, valid and sensitive global measure of disability for children with CMT from the age of 3 years.

Contemporary validity theorists define validity not as a statistical property of the test but as the extent to which empirical evidence supports the interpretation of test scores for an intended use. However, validity testing theory and methodology are rarely evident in the PROM validation literature. Application of this theory and methodology would provide structure for comprehensive validation planning to support improved PROM development and sound arguments for the validity of PROM score interpretation and use in each new context. This paper proposes the application of contemporary validity theory and methodology to PROM validity testing. The validity testing principles will be applied to a hypothetical case study with a focus on the interpretation and use of scores from a translated PROM that measures health literacy (the Health Literacy Questionnaire or HLQ). Although robust psychometric properties of a PROM are a pre-condition to its use, a PROM's validity lies in the sound argument that a network of empirical evidence supports the intended interpretation and use of PROM scores for decision making in a particular context. The health sector is yet to apply contemporary theory and methodology to PROM development and validation. The theoretical and methodological processes in this paper are offered as an advancement of the theory and practice of PROM validity testing in the health sector.\n\nPROMIS GH (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health) Scale in Stroke: A Validation Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKatzan, Irene L; Lapin, Brittany\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recently included the 10-item PROMIS GH (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health) scale as part of their recommended Standard Set of Stroke Outcome Measures. Before collection of PROMIS GH is broadly implemented, it is necessary to assess its performance in the stroke population. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of PROMIS GH in patients with ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. PROMIS GH and 6 PROMIS domain scales measuring same/similar constructs were electronically collected on 1102 patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes at various stages of recovery from their stroke who were seen in a cerebrovascular clinic from October 12, 2015, through June 2, 2017. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to evaluate the adequacy of 2-factor structure of component scores. Test-retest reliability and convergent validity of PROMIS GH items and component scores were assessed. Discriminant validity and responsiveness were compared between PROMIS GH and PROMIS domain scales measuring the same or related constructs. Analyses were repeated stratified by stroke subtype and modified Rankin Scale score <2 versus â¥2. There was moderate internal reliability (ordinal Î±, 0.82-0.88) and marginal model fit for the 2-factor solution for component scores (root mean square error of approximation, 0.11). Convergent validity was good with significant correlations between all PROMIS GH items and PROMIS domain scales ( P <0.001 for all). There was excellent discrimination for all PROMIS GH items and component scores across modified Rankin Scale levels. Good responsiveness (effect size, >0.5) was demonstrated for 8 of the 10 PROMIS GH items. Reliability and validity remained consistent across stroke subtype and disability level (modified Rankin Scale, <2 versus â¥2). PROMIS GH exhibits acceptable performance in patients with stroke. Our findings\n\nWhy Measure Outcomes?\n\nPubMed\n\nKuhn, John E\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe concept of measuring the outcomes of treatment in health care was promoted by Ernest Amory Codman in the early 1900s, but, until recently, his ideas were generally ignored. The forces that have advanced outcome measurement to the forefront of health care include the shift in payers for health care from the patient to large insurance companies or government agencies, the movement toward assessing the care of populations not individuals, and the effort to find value (or cost-effective treatments) amid rising healthcare costs. No ideal method exists to measure outcomes, and the information gathered depends on the reason the outcome information is required. Outcome measures used in research are best able to answer research questions. The methods for assessing physician and hospital performance include process measures, patient-experience measures, structure measures, and measures used to assess the outcomes of treatment. The methods used to assess performance should be validated, be reliable, and reflect a patient's perception of the treatment results. The healthcare industry must measure outcomes to identify which treatments are most effective and provide the most benefit to patients.\n\nMeasurement tools and outcome measures used in transitional patient safety; a systematic review.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Melle, Marije A; van Stel, Henk F; Poldervaart, Judith M; de Wit, Niek J; Zwart, Dorien L M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPatients are at risk for harm when treated simultaneously by healthcare providers from different healthcare organisations. To assess current practice and improvements of transitional patient safety, valid measurement tools are needed. To identify and appraise all measurement tools and outcomes that measure aspects of transitional patient safety, PubMed, Cinahl, Embase and Psychinfo were systematically searched. Two researchers performed the title and abstract and full-text selection. First, publications about validation of measurement tools were appraised for quality following COSMIN criteria. Second, we inventoried all measurement tools and outcome measures found in our search that assessed current transitional patient safety or the effect of interventions targeting transitional patient safety. The initial search yielded 8288 studies, of which 18 assessed validity of measurement tools of different aspects of transitional safety, and 191 assessed current transitional patient safety or effect of interventions. In the validated measurement tools, the overall quality of content and structural validity was acceptable; other COSMIN criteria, such as reliability, measurement error and responsiveness, were mostly poor or not reported. In our outcome inventory, the most frequently used validated outcome measure was the Care Transition Measure (n = 9). The most frequently used non-validated outcome measures were: medication discrepancies (n = 98), hospital readmissions (n = 55), adverse events (n = 34), emergency department visits (n = 33), (mental or physical) health status (n = 28), quality and timeliness of discharge summary, and patient satisfaction (n = 23). Although no validated measures exist that assess all aspects of transitional patient safety, we found validated measurement tools on specific aspects. Reporting of validity of transitional measurement tools was incomplete. Numerous outcome measures with unknown measurement properties are used in current studies on\n\nValidation of the Italian version of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM).\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmieri, Gaspare; Evans, Chris; Hansen, Vidje; Brancaleoni, Greta; Ferrari, Silvia; Porcelli, Piero; Reitano, Francesco; Rigatelli, Marco\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation--Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) was translated into Italian and tested in non-clinical (n = 263) and clinical (n = 647) samples. The translation showed good acceptability, internal consistency and convergent validity in both samples. There were large and statistically significant differences between clinical and non-clinical datasets on all scores. The reliable change criteria were similar to those for the UK referential data. Some of the clinically significant change criteria, particularly for the men, were moderately different from the UK cutting points. The Italian version of the CORE-OM showed respectable psychometric parameters. However, it seemed plausible that non-clinical and clinical distributions of self-report scores on psychopathology and functioning measures may differ by language and culture. *A good quality Italian translation of the CORE-OM, and hence the GP-CORE, CORE-10 and CORE-5 measures also, is now available for use by practitioners and anyone surveying or exploring general psychological state. The measures can be obtained from CORE-IMS or yourself and practitioners are encouraged to share anonymised data so that good clinical and non-clinical referential databases can be established for Italy.\n\nValidating Measures of Real-World Outcome: The Results of the VALERO Expert Survey and RAND Panel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLeifker, Feea R.; Patterson, Thomas L.; Heaton, Robert K.; Harvey, Philip D.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground: People with schizophrenia demonstrate considerable discrepancy between self-reported functioning and informant reports. It is not clear whether these discrepancies originate from the instruments used or from the perspectives of different informants. The goal of the Validation of Everyday Real-World Outcomes (VALERO) Study is to enhance the measurement of real-world (RW) outcomes in the social, residential, and vocational domains through selection of optimal scales and informants using a multistep process similar to the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative. Methods: Forty-eight experts provided their opinion regarding the best scales measuring RW outcomes. Fifty-nine measures were nominated. The investigators selected the 11 scales that were the most highly nominated, had the most published validity data, and best represented the domains of interest. Information was provided to other experts who served as RAND panelists. Panelists rated each measure for its suitability across multiple a priori domains. Discrepant ratings were discussed until consensus was reached. Results: Following the RAND Panel, the 2 scales that scored highest across the various criteria for each of the classes of scales (hybrid, social functioning, and everyday living skills) were selected for use in the first substudy of VALERO. The scales selected were the Quality-of-Life Scale, Specific Levels of Functioning Scale, Social Behavior Schedule, Social Functioning Scale, Independent Living Skills Schedule, and Life Skills Profile. Discussion: The results show that although there are significant limitations with current scales used for the assessment of RW outcome in schizophrenia, a consensus is possible. Further, several existing instruments were rated as useful for measuring social, residential, and vocational outcomes.

Cross-sectional study. Fifty participants performed the WBLT to determine dorsiflexion ROM using four different measurement techniques: dorsiflexion angle with digital inclinometer at 15cm distal to the tibial tuberosity (Â°), dorsiflexion angle with inclinometer at tibial tuberosity (Â°), maximum lunge distance (cm), and dorsiflexion angle using a 2D motion capture system (Â°). Outcome measures were recorded concurrently during each trial. To establish concurrent validity, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) were conducted, comparing each dependent variable to the 2D motion capture analysis (identified as the reference standard). A higher correlation indicates strong concurrent validity. There was a high correlation between each measurement technique and the reference standard. Specifically the correlation between the inclinometer placement at 15cm below the tibial tuberosity (44.9Â°Â±5.5Â°) and the motion capture angle (27.0Â°Â±6.0Â°) was r=0.76 (p=0.001), between the inclinometer placement at the tibial tuberosity angle (39.0Â°Â±4.6Â°) and the motion capture angle was r=0.71 (p=0.001), and between the distance from the wall clinical measure (10.3Â±3.0cm) to the motion capture angle was r=0.74 (p=0.001). This study determined that the clinical measures used during the WBLT have a high correlation with the reference standard for assessing dorsiflexion range of motion. Therefore, obtaining maximum lunge distance and inclinometer angles are both valid assessments during the weight-bearing lunge test. Copyright Â© 2016 Sports Medicine Australia.

This systematic review was conducted to critically evaluate pediatric evidence on frequency of occurrence, validity of outcome measures, and prognostic indicators of post-thrombotic syndrome. Design and Methods A comprehensive literature search of original reports revealed 19 eligible studies, totaling 977 patients with upper/lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Calculated weighted mean frequency of post-thrombotic syndrome was 26% (95% confidence interval: 23â28%) overall, and differed significantly by prospective/non-prospective analysis and use/non-use of a standardized outcome measure. Results Standardized post-thrombotic syndrome outcome measures included an adaptation of the Villalta scale, the Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathologic classification, and the Manco-Johnson instrument. Data on validity were reported only for the Manco-Johnson instrument. No publications on post-thrombotic syndrome-related quality of life outcomes were identified. Candidate prognostic factors for post-thrombotic syndrome in prospective studies included use/non-use of thrombolysis and plasma levels of factor VIII activity and D-dimer. Conclusions Given that affected children must endure chronic sequelae for many decades, it is imperative that future collaborative pediatric prospective cohort studies and trials assess as key objectives and outcomes the incidence, severity, prognostic indicators, and health impact of post-thrombotic syndrome, using validated measures.

Our study aimed to: i. develop a PROM for recovery from drug and alcohol dependence that has good face and content validity, acceptability and usability for people in recovery; ii. evaluate the psychometric properties and factorial structure of the new PROM ('SURE'). Item development included Delphi groups, focus groups, and service user feedback on draft versions of the new measure. A 30-item beta version was completed by 575 service users (461 in person [IP] and 114 online [OL]). Analyses comprised rating scale evaluation, assessment of psychometric properties, factorial structure, and differential item functioning. The beta measure had good face and content validity. Nine items were removed due to low stability, low factor loading, low construct validity or high complexity. The remaining 21 items were re-scaled (Rasch model analyses). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed 5 factors: substance use, material resources, outlook on life, self-care, and relationships. The MIMIC model indicated 95% metric invariance across the IP and OL samples, and 100% metric invariance for gender. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were granted. The 5 factors correlated positively with the corresponding WHOQOL-BREF and ARC subscales and score differences between participant sub-groups confirmed discriminative validity. 'SURE' is a psychometrically valid, quick and easy-to-complete outcome measure, developed with unprecedented input from people in recovery. It can be used alongside, or instead of, existing outcome tools. Copyright Â© 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

PROMIS measures have not been validated for surgical patients with cervical spine disorders. The objective of this project is to evaluate the validity (e.g., convergent validity, known-groups validity, responsiveness to change) of PROMIS computer adaptive tests (CATs) for pain behavior, pain interference, and physical function in patients undergoing cervical spine surgery. METHODS The legacy outcome measures Neck Disability Index (NDI) and SF-12 were used as comparisons with PROMIS measures. PROMIS CATs, NDI-10, and SF-12 measures were administered prospectively to 59 consecutive tertiary hospital patients who were treated surgically for degenerative cervical spine disorders. A subscore of NDI-5 was calculated from NDI-10 by eliminating the lifting, headaches, pain intensity, reading, and driving sections and multiplying the final score by 4. Assessments were administered preoperatively (baseline) and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 3 months. Patients presenting for revision surgery, tumor, infection, or trauma were excluded. Participants completed the measures in Assessment Center, an online data collection tool accessed by using a secure login and password on a tablet computer. Subgroup analysis was also performed based on a primary diagnosis of either cervical radiculopathy or cervical myelopathy. RESULTS Convergent validity for PROMIS CATs was supported with multiple statistically significant correlations with the existing legacy measures, NDI and SF-12, at baseline. Furthermore, PROMIS CATs demonstrated known-group validity and identified clinically significant improvements in all measures after surgical intervention. In the cervical radiculopathy and myelopathic cohorts, the PROMIS measures demonstrated similar responsiveness to the\n\nThe Premature Ejaculation Profile: validation of self-reported outcome measures for research and practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatrick, Donald L; Giuliano, FranÃ§ois; Ho, Kai Fai; Gagnon, Dennis D; McNulty, Pauline; Rothman, Margaret\n\n2009-02-01\n\nTo evaluate the reliability and validity of the Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP), a self-reported outcome instrument for evaluating domains of PE and its treatment, comprised of four single-item measures, a profile, and an index score. Data were from men participating in observational studies in the USA (PE, 207 men; non-PE, 1380) and Europe (PE, 201; non-PE, 914) and from men with PE (1238) participating in a phase III randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of dapoxetine. The PEP contains four measures: perceived control over ejaculation, personal distress related to ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation, each assessed on five-point response scales. Test-retest reliability, known-groups validity, and ability to detect a patient-reported global impression of change (PGI) in condition were evaluated for the individual PEP measures and a PEP index score (the mean of all four measures). Profile analysis was conducted using multivariate analysis of variance. All PEP measures showed acceptable reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.66 to 0.83) and mean scores for all measures differed significantly between PE and non-PE groups (P < 0.001). Men who reported a reduction in PE with treatment in the phase III trial had significantly greater scores on each of the four measures. The PEP profiles of men with and without PE differed significantly (P < 0.001) in both observational studies; higher levels of PGI were associated with higher PEP profiles (P < 0.001). The PEP index score also showed acceptable reliability and was significantly different between the PE and non-PE groups (P < 0.001). Men who reported an improvement in PE with treatment in the phase III trial had significantly greater PEP index scores. In the phase III trial, nausea was the most common adverse event with dapoxetine. The PEP provides a reliable, valid, and interpretable measure for use in monitoring\n\nMontreal Accord on Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) use series-Paper 7: modern perspectives of measurement validation emphasize justification of inferences based on patient reported outcome scores.\n\nPubMed\n\nSawatzky, Richard; Chan, Eric K H; Zumbo, Bruno D; Ahmed, Sara; Bartlett, Susan J; Bingham, Clifton O; Gardner, William; Jutai, Jeffrey; Kuspinar, Ayse; Sajobi, Tolulope; Lix, Lisa M\n\n2017-09-01\n\nObtaining the patient's view about the outcome of care is an essential component of patient-centered care. Many patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for different purposes have been developed since the 1960s. Measurement validation is fundamental in the development, evaluation, and use of PRO instruments. This paper provides a review of modern perspectives of measurement validation in relation to the followings three questions as applied to PROs: (1) What evidence is needed to warrant comparisons between groups and individuals? (2) What evidence is needed to warrant comparisons over time? and (3) What are the value implications, including personal and societal consequences, of using PRO scores? Measurement validation is an ongoing process that involves the accumulation of evidence regarding the justification of inferences, actions, and decisions based on measurement scores. These include inferences pertaining to comparisons between groups and comparisons over time as well as consideration of value implications of using PRO scores. Personal and societal consequences must be examined as part of a comprehensive approach to measurement validation. The answers to these three questions are fundamental to the the validity of different types of inferences, actions, and decisions made on PRO scores in health research, health care administration, and clinical practice.

Many commonly used PROMs have no evidence of reliability, validity, and responsiveness in a hand and wrist trauma population. This systematic review examines the PROMs used in the assessment of hand and wrist trauma patients, and the evidence for reliability, validity, and responsiveness of each measure in this population. A systematic review of Pubmed, Medline, and CINAHL searching for randomized controlled trials of patients with traumatic injuries to the hand and wrist was carried out to identify the PROMs. For each identified PROM, evidence of reliability, validity, and responsiveness was identified using a further systematic review of the Pubmed, Medline, CINAHL, and reverse citation trail audit procedure. The PROM used most often was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire; the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), Gartland and Werley score, Michigan Hand Outcomes score, Mayo Wrist Score, and Short Form 36 were also commonly used. Only the DASH and PRWE have evidence of reliability, validity, and responsiveness in patients with traumatic injuries to the hand and wrist; other measures either have incomplete evidence or evidence gathered in a nontraumatic population. The DASH and PRWE both have evidence of reliability, validity, and responsiveness in a hand and wrist trauma population. Other PROMs used to assess hand and wrist trauma patients do not. This should be considered when selecting a PROM for patients with traumatic hand and wrist pathology.\n\nValidation of a Measure of College Students' Intoxicated Behaviors: Associations with Alcohol Outcome Expectancies, Drinking Motives, and Personality\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nWestmaas, Johann; Moeller, Scott; Woicik, Patricia Butler\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObjective: The authors aimed to develop a measure of college students' intoxicated behaviors and to validate the measure using scales assessing alcohol outcome expectancies, motives for drinking, and personality traits.

S.; Wu, Winona; Becherer, Babette E.; Medin, Caroline\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: Rhinoplasty is 1 of the most common aesthetic and reconstructive plastic surgical procedures performed within the United States. Yet, data on functional reconstructive open and closed rhinoplasty procedures with or without spreader graft placement are not definitive as only a few studies have examined both validated measurable objective and subjective outcomes of spreader grafting during rhinoplasty. The aim of this study was to utilize previously validated measures to assess objective, functional outcomes in patients who underwent open and closed rhinoplasty with spreader grafting. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive rhinoplasty patients. Patients with internal nasal valve insufficiency who underwent an open and closed approach rhinoplasty between 2007 and 2016 were studied. The Cottle test and Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation survey was used to assess nasal obstruction. Patient-reported symptoms were recorded. Acoustic rhinometry was performed pre- and postoperatively. Average minimal cross-sectional area of the nose was measured. Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients were reviewed over a period of 8 years. Thirty-eight patients were included in this study. Of those, 30 patients underwent closed rhinoplasty and 8 open rhinoplasty. Mean age was 36.9âÂ±â18.4 years. The average cross-sectional area in closed and open rhinoplasty patients increased significantly (P = 0.019). There was a functional improvement in all presented cases using the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation scale evaluation. Conclusions: Closed rhinoplasty with spreader grafting may play a significant role in the treatment of nasal valve collapse. A closed approach rhinoplasty including spreader grafting is a viable option in select cases with objective and validated functional improvement.

The French version of the LupusPRO and the MOS SF-36 were administered; demographic, clinical and serological characteristics were obtained. Disease activity (SELENA-SLEDAI and the Lupus Foundation of America definition of flare) and damage (SLICC/ACR SDI) were assessed. Physician disease activity and damage assessments were ascertained using visual analog scales. Internal consistency reliability (ICR), test-retest reliability (TRT), convergent and discriminant validity (against corresponding domains of the SF-36), criterion validity (against disease activity, damage or health status) and known group validity were tested. A total of 99 French-Canadian SLE patients participated (97% women, mean (SD) age 45.2 (14.5) years). The median (IQR) SELENA-SLEDAI and SDI were 3.5 (6.0) and 1.0 (2.0), respectively. The ICR of the LupusPRO domains ranged from 0.81 to 0.93 (except for lupus symptoms, procreation and coping), while TRT ranged from 0.72 to 0.95. Convergent and discriminant validity, criterion validity and known group validity against disease activity, damage and health status measures were observed. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit. The LupusPRO has fair psychometric properties among French-Canadian patients with SLE.

On the basis of their findings, the Department of Defense recommended a comprehensive pain management strategy that included development of a standardized pain assessment system that would collect patient-reported outcomes data to inform the patient-provider clinical encounter. The result was the Pain Assessment Screening Tool and Outcomes Registry (PASTOR). The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and response burden of the patient-reported outcome measures in PASTOR. Data for analyses were collected from 681 individuals who completed PASTOR at baseline and follow-up as part of their routine clinical care. The survey tool included self-report measures of pain severity and pain interference (measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System [PROMIS] and the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating scale). PROMIS measures of pain correlates also were administered. Validation analyses included estimation of score associations among measures, comparison of scores of known groups, responsiveness, ceiling and floor effects, and response burden. Results of psychometric testing provided substantial evidence for the validity of PASTOR self-report measures in this population. Expected associations among scores largely supported the concurrent validity of the measures. Scores effectively distinguished among respondents on the basis of their self-reported impressions of general health. PROMIS measures were administered using computer adaptive testing and each, on average, required less than 1 minute to administer. Statistical and graphical analyses demonstrated the responsiveness of PASTOR measures over time.

The aim of the present study is to translate the COMI into Dutch and validate it for use in native Dutch speakers with low back pain. The COMI was translated into Dutch following established guidelines and avoiding region-specific terminology. A total of 89 Dutch-speaking patients with low back pain were recruited from 8 centers, located in the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. Patients completed a questionnaire booklet including the validated Dutch version of the Roland Morris disability questionnaire, EQ-5D, the WHOQoL-Bref, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, and the Dutch translation of the COMI. Two weeks later, patients completed the Dutch COMI translation again, with a transition scale assessing changes in their condition. The patterns of correlations between the individual COMI items and the validated reference questionnaires were comparable to those reported for other validated language versions of the COMI. The intraclass correlation for the COMI summary score was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.94). It was 0.75 and 0.70 for the back and leg pain score, respectively. The minimum detectable change for the COMI summary score was 1.74. No significant differences were observed between repeated scores of individual COMI items or for the summary score. The reproducibility of the Dutch translation of the COMI is comparable to that of other validated spine outcome measures. The COMI items correlate well with the established item-specific scores. The Dutch translation of the COMI, validated by this work, is a reliable and valuable tool for spine centers treating Dutch-speaking patients and can be used in registries and outcome studies.\n\nValidity of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test as a cognition performance outcome measure for multiple sclerosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBenedict, Ralph HB; DeLuca, John; Phillips, Glenn; LaRocca, Nicholas; Hudson, Lynn D; Rudick, Richard\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCognitive and motor performance measures are commonly employed in multiple sclerosis (MS) research, particularly when the purpose is to determine the efficacy of treatment.

There are limited data, however, regarding their validity (e.g., convergent validity, responsiveness to change). To provide such data, we conducted a prospective study with 225 outpatients being treated for substance abuse. Assessments were completed shortly after intake and at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. The alcohol item banks were administered as computerized adaptive tests (CATs). Fourteen CATs and one six-item short form were also administered from eight other PROMIS domains to generate a comprehensive health status profile. After modeling treatment outcome for the sample as a whole, correlates of outcome from the PROMIS health status profile were examined. For convergent validity, the largest correlation emerged between the PROMIS alcohol use score and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (r=.79 at intake). Regarding treatment outcome, there were modest changes across the target problem of alcohol use and other domains of the PROMIS health status profile. However, significant heterogeneity was found in initial severity of drinking and in rates of change for both abstinence and severity of drinking during follow-up. This heterogeneity was associated with demographic (e.g., gender) and health-profile (e.g., emotional support, social participation) variables. The results demonstrated the validity of PROMIS CATs, which require only 4-6 items in each domain. This efficiency makes it feasible to use a comprehensive health status profile within the substance use treatment setting, providing important prognostic information regarding abstinence and severity of drinking.

A Validation Process by the OMERACT Ultrasound Working Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerslev, Lene; Gutierrez, Marwin; Schmidt, Wolfgang A; Keen, Helen I; Filippucci, Emilio; Kane, David; Thiele, Ralf; Kaeley, Gurjit; Balint, Peter; Mandl, Peter; Delle Sedie, Andrea; Hammer, Hilde Berner; Christensen, Robin; MÃ¶ller, Ingrid; Pineda, Carlos; Kissin, Eugene; Bruyn, George A; Iagnocco, Annamaria; Naredo, Esperanza; D'Agostino, Maria Antonietta\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo summarize the work performed by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) Ultrasound (US) Working Group on the validation of US as a potential outcome measure in gout. Based on the lack of definitions, highlighted in a recent literature review on US as an outcome tool in gout, a series of iterative exercises were carried out to obtain consensus-based definitions on US elementary components in gout using a Delphi exercise and subsequently testing these definitions in static images and in patients with proven gout. Cohen's Îº was used to test agreement, and values of 0-0.20 were considered poor, 0.20-0.40 fair, 0.40-0.60 moderate, 0.60-0.80 good, and 0.80-1 excellent. With an agreement of > 80%, consensus-based definitions were obtained for the 4 elementary lesions highlighted in the literature review: tophi, aggregates, erosions, and double contour (DC). In static images interobserver reliability ranged from moderate to almost perfect, and similar results were found for the intrareader reliability. In patients the intraobserver agreement was good for all lesions except DC (moderate). The interobserver agreement was poor for aggregates and DC but moderate for the other components. These first steps in evaluating the validity of US as an outcome measure for gout show that the reliability of the definitions ranged from moderate to excellent in static images and somewhat lower in patients, indicating that a standardized scanning technique may be needed, before testing the responsiveness of those definitions in a composite US score.\n\nMeasuring voice outcomes: state of the science review.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarding, Pau N; Wilson, J A; MacKenzie, K; Deary, I J\n\n2009-08-01\n\nResearchers evaluating voice disorder interventions currently have a plethora of voice outcome measurement tools from which to choose. Faced with such a wide choice, it would be beneficial to establish a clear rationale to guide selection. This article reviews the published literature on the three main areas of voice outcome assessment: (1) perceptual rating of voice quality, (2) acoustic measurement of the speech signal and (3) patient self-reporting of voice problems. We analysed the published reliability, validity, sensitivity to change and utility of the common outcome measurement tools in each area. From the data, we suggest that routine voice outcome measurement should include (1) an expert rating of voice quality (using the Grade-Roughness-Breathiness-Asthenia-Strain rating scale) and (2) a short self-reporting tool (either the Vocal Performance Questionnaire or the Vocal Handicap Index 10). These measures have high validity, the best reported reliability to date, good sensitivity to change data and excellent utility ratings. However, their application and administration require attention to detail. Acoustic measurement has arguable validity and poor reliability data at the present time. Other areas of voice outcome measurement (e.g. stroboscopy and aerodynamic phonatory measurements) require similarly detailed research and analysis.\n\nSystematic review of systemic sclerosis-specific instruments for the EULAR Outcome Measures Library: An evolutional database model of validated patient-reported outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nIngegnoli, Francesca; Carmona, Loreto; Castrejon, Isabel\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe EULAR Outcome Measures Library (OML) is a freely available database of validated patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of validated PROs specifically developed for systemic sclerosis (SSc) to feed the EULAR OML. A sensitive search was developed in Medline and Embase to identify all validation studies, cohort studies, reviews, or meta-analyses in which the objective were the development or validation of specific PROs evaluating organ involvement, disease activity or damage in SSc. A reviewer screened title and abstracts, selected the studies, and collected data concerning validation using ad hoc forms based on the COSMIN checklist. From 13,140 articles captured, 74 met the predefined criteria. After excluding two instruments as they were unavailable in English the selected 23 studies provided information on seven SSc-specific PROs on different SSc domains: burden of illness (symptom burden index), functional status (Scleroderma Assessment Questionnaire), functional ability (scleroderma Functional Score), Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's condition score), mouth involvement (Mouth Handicap in SSc), gastro-intestinal involvement (University of California Los Angeles-Scleroderma Clinical Trial Consortium Gastro-Intestinal tract 2.0), and skin involvement (skin self-assessment). Each of them is partially validated and has different psychometric requirements. Seven SSc-specific PROs have a minimum validation and were included in the EULAR OML. Further development in the area of disease-specific PROs in SSc is warranted. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this review we provide a summary of the outcome instruments used most frequently in spine trauma research, identify the unique challenges of studying outcomes of spine trauma patients, and propose an integrated approach that may be beneficial for future studies. We reviewed the use of outcome instruments applicable to spine trauma research, including generic health measures, inventories of back-specific function, pain scales, health related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments, and radiographic determinants of outcome. Several inventories have been utilised to measure clinical outcomes following spinal trauma. Excluding measures of neurological function (e.g. ASIA motor score), none have been specifically validated for use with spine fractures. The SF-36, RMDQ, and ODI are amongst the most commonly used instruments. Importantly, the use of validated functional outcome measures in spine trauma research is hampered by the fact that the pre-morbid state of patients who sustain spine trauma may not be accurately represented by normative values established for the general population. The VAS is used most frequently to assess degree of neck and back pain. Most studies have relied on non-validated measures to determine radiographic results of treatment, although more elegant radiographic metrics exist. Functional outcome measurement of traumatically injured spine patients is challenging because available generic and spine-specific instruments were not designed for or validated in this population. Furthermore, no single inventory is capable of capturing global data necessary to evaluate results following these injuries. Investigations seeking to quantify outcomes following spine trauma should consider the use of a combination of existing surveys in a complementary fashion that should include a\n\nReliability and validity of the Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale-2.\n\nPubMed\n\nResnick, Barbara\n\n2005-10-01\n\nDevelopment of a reliable and valid measure of outcome expectations for exercise for older adults will help establish the relationship between outcome expectations and exercise and facilitate the development of interventions to increase physical activity in older adults. The purpose of this study was to test the reliability and validity of the Outcome Expectations for Exercise-2 Scale (OEE-2), a 13-item measure with two subscales: positive OEE (POEE) and negative OEE (NOEE). The OEE-2 scale was given to 161 residents in a continuing-care retirement community. There was some evidence of validity based on confirmatory factor analysis, Rasch-analysis INFIT and OUTFIT statistics, and convergent validity and test criterion relationships. There was some evidence for reliability of the OEE-2 based on alpha coefficients, person- and item-separation reliability indexes, and R(2)values. Based on analyses, suggested revisions are provided for future use of the OEE-2. Although ongoing reliability and validity testing are needed, the OEE-2 scale can be used to identify older adults with low outcome expectations for exercise, and interventions can then be implemented to strengthen these expectations and improve exercise behavior.\n\nLC-PROM: Validation of a patient reported outcomes measure for liver cirrhosis patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Ying; Yang, Yuanyuan; Lv, Jing; Zhang, Yanbo\n\n2016-05-10\n\nThe aim of the study is to develop a specific patient-reported scale of liver cirrhosis according to the Patient Reported Outcome guidelines of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and to examine its capacity to fill gaps in this field. A conceptual framework was developed and a preliminary item pool developed through literature review and interviews of 10 patients with liver cirrhosis. With the preliminary items, we performed a pilot survey that included a cognitive test with patients and interviews with experts; the focus was on content and language of the scale. In the item selection stage, seven statistical methods including discrete trends method, discrimination analysis, exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's Î± coefficient, correlation coefficient, test-retest reliability, Item-Response Theory were applied to survey data from 200 subjects (150 liver cirrhosis patients and 50 controls). This produced the preliminary Liver Cirrhosis Patient-reported Outcome Measure (LC-PROM). In the next stage, we conducted the survey with 620 subjects (500 patients and 120 controls) to validate reliability, validity and acceptability of this scale. The 55 items and 13 dimensions addressed four domains: physical, psychological, social, and therapeutic. Cronbach's Î± coefficients were 0.921 for the total scale; the confirmatory factor analysis, t-tests and ANOVA supported scale validity; the model fit index as Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Root Mean Square Residual (RMR), Normed Fit Index (NFI), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Incremental Fit Index (IFI) met the criterion generally. The acceptance ratio and response rate indicated good feasibility.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a new stroke patient-reported outcome measure (Stroke-PROM) instrument for capturing more comprehensive effects of stroke on patients participating in clinical trials of new drugs. A conceptual framework and a pool of items for the preliminary Stroke-PROM were generated by consulting the relevant literature and other questionnaires created in China and other countries, and interviewing 20 patients and 4 experts to ensure that all germane parameters were included. During the first item-selection phase, classical test theory and item response theory were applied to an initial scale completed by 133 patients with stroke. During the item-revaluation phase, classical test theory and item response theory were used again, this time with 475 patients with stroke and 104 healthy participants. During the scale assessment phase, confirmatory factor analysis was applied to the final scale of the Stroke-PROM using the same study population as in the second item-selection phase. Reliability, validity, responsiveness and feasibility of the final scale were tested. The final scale of Stroke-PROM contained 46 items describing four domains (physiology, psychology, society and treatment). These four domains were subdivided into 10 subdomains. Cronbach's Î± coefficients for the four domains ranged from 0.861 to 0.908. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the final scale, and the model fit index satisfied the criterion. Differences in the Stroke-PROM mean scores were significant between patients with stroke and healthy participants in nine subdomains (Pâ<â0.001), indicating that the scale showed good responsiveness.

The objectives of the present work were to identify the most useful items and assess their psychometric properties. Stage 1: One hundred fifty-five participants completed a prototype 36-item Vestibular Rehabilitation Benefit Questionnaire (VRBQ). Statistical analysis demonstrated its subscale structure and identified redundant items. Stage 2: One hundred twenty-four participants completed a refined 22-item VRBQ and three established questionnaires (Dizziness Handicap Inventory, DHI; Vertigo Symptom Scale short form, VSS-sf; Medical Outcomes Study short form 36, SF-36) in a longitudinal study. Statistical analysis revealed four internally consistent subscales of the VRBQ: Dizziness, Anxiety, Motion-Provoked Dizziness, and Quality of Life. Correlations with the DHI, VSS-sf, and SF-36 support the validity of the VRBQ, and effect size estimates suggest that the VRBQ is more responsive than comparable questionnaires. Twenty participants completed the VRBQ twice in a 24-hour period, indicating excellent test-retest reliability. The VRBQ appears to be a concise and psychometrically robust questionnaire that addresses the main aspects of dizziness impact.\n\nValidation of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Computerized Adaptive Tests Against the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score for 6 Common Foot and Ankle Pathologies.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoltsov, Jayme C B; Greenfield, Stephen T; Soukup, Dylan; Do, Huong T; Ellis, Scott J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe field of foot and ankle surgery lacks a widely accepted gold-standard patient-reported outcome instrument. With the changing infrastructure of the medical profession, more efficient patient-reported outcome tools are needed to reduce respondent burden and increase participation while providing consistent and reliable measurement across multiple pathologies and disciplines. The primary purpose of the present study was to validate 3 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System computer adaptive tests (CATs) most relevant to the foot and ankle discipline against the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and the Short Form 12 general health status survey in patients with 6 common foot and ankle pathologies. Patients (n = 240) indicated for operative treatment for 1 of 6 common foot and ankle pathologies completed the CATs, FAOS, and Short Form 12 at their preoperative surgical visits, 1 week subsequently (before surgery), and at 6 months postoperatively. The psychometric properties of the instruments were assessed and compared. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System CATs each took less than 1 minute to complete, whereas the FAOS took 6.5 minutes, and the Short Form 12 took 3 minutes. CAT scores were more normally distributed and had fewer floor and ceiling effects than those on the FAOS, which reached as high as 24%. The CATs were more precise than the FAOS and had similar responsiveness and test-retest reliability. The physical function and mobility CATs correlated strongly with the activities subscale of the FAOS, and the pain interference CAT correlated strongly with the pain subscale of the FAOS. The CATs and FAOS were responsive to changes with operative treatment for 6 common foot and ankle pathologies. The CATs performed as well as or better than the FAOS in all aspects of psychometric validity. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System CATs show tremendous potential for improving the study of patient\n\nReliability and Construct Validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Instruments in Women with Fibromyalgia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMerriwether, Ericka N; Rakel, Barbara A; Zimmerman, Miriam B; Dailey, Dana L; Vance, Carol G T; Darghosian, Leon; Golchha, Meenakshi; Geasland, Katherine M; Chimenti, Ruth; Crofford, Leslie J; Sluka, Kathleen A\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was developed to standardize measurement of clinically relevant patient-reported outcomes. This study evaluated the reliability and construct validity of select PROMIS static short-form (SF) instruments in women with fibromyalgia. Analysis of baseline data from the Fibromyalgia Activity Study with TENS (FAST), a randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Dual site, university-based outpatient clinics. Women aged 20 to 67 years diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Participants completed the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) and 10 PROMIS static SF instruments. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach alpha. Convergent validity was examined against the FIQR using Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. PROMIS static SF instruments had fair to high internal consistency (Cronbach Î±â=â0.58 to 0.94, P â<â0.05). PROMIS 'physical function' domain score was highly correlated with FIQR 'function' score (râ=â-0.73). The PROMIS 'total' score was highly correlated with the FIQR total score (râ=â-0.72). Correlations with FIQR total score of each of the three PROMIS domain scores were râ=â-0.65 for 'physical function,' râ=â-0.63 for 'global,' and râ=â-0.57 for 'symptom' domain. PROMIS 'physical function,' 'global,' and 'symptom' scores explained 58% of the FIQR total score variance. Select PROMIS static SF instruments demonstrate convergent validity with the FIQR, a legacy measure of fibromyalgia disease severity. These results highlight the potential utility of select PROMIS static SFs for assessment and tracking of patient-reported outcomes in fibromyalgia. Â© 2016 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

On the basis of ratings from 168 older drivers and 168 family members-caregivers, we calculated receiver operating characteristic curves. The drivers' area under the curve (AUC) was .620 (95% confidence interval [CI] = .514-.725, p = .043). The family members-caregivers' AUC was .726 (95% CI = .622-.829, p â¤ .01). Older drivers' ratings showed statistically significant yet poor concurrent criterion validity, but family members-caregivers' ratings showed good concurrent criterion validity for the criterion on-road driving test. Continuing research with a more representative sample is being pursued to confirm the SDBM's concurrent criterion validity.

Once established, this measure can be used to facilitate the development of interventions to strengthen outcome expectations and improve adherence to regular exercise in older adults. Building on initial psychometrics of the Outcome Expectation for Exercise (OEE) Scale, the purpose of the current study was to use structural equation modeling to provide additional support for the reliability and validity of this measure. The OEE scale is a 9-item measure specifically focusing on the perceived consequences of exercise for older adults. The OEE scale was given to 191 residents in a continuing care retirement community. The mean age of the participants was 85 +/- 6.1 and the majority were female (76%), White (99%), and unmarried (76%). Using structural equation modeling, reliability was based on R2 values, and validity was based on a confirmatory factor analysis and path coefficients. There was continued evidence for reliability of the OEE based on R2 values ranging from .42 to .77, and validity with path coefficients ranging from .69 to .87, and evidence of model fit (X2 of 69, df = 27, p < .05, NFI = .98, RMSEA = .07). The evidence of reliability and validity of this measure has important implications for clinical work and research. The OEE scale can be used to identify older adults who have low outcome expectations for exercise, and interventions can then be implemented to strengthen these expectations and thereby improve exercise behavior.\n\nPredictive validity of callous-unemotional traits measured in early adolescence with respect to multiple antisocial outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcMahon, Robert J; Witkiewitz, Katie; Kotler, Julie S\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThis study investigated the predictive validity of youth callous-unemotional (CU) traits, as measured in early adolescence (Grade 7) by the Antisocial Process Screening Device (APSD; Frick & Hare, 2001), in a longitudinal sample (N = 754). Antisocial outcomes, assessed in adolescence and early adulthood, included self-reported general delinquency from 7th grade through 2 years post-high school, self-reported serious crimes through 2 years post-high school, juvenile and adult arrest records through 1 year post-high school, and antisocial personality disorder symptoms and diagnosis at 2 years post-high school. CU traits measured in 7th grade were highly predictive of 5 of the 6 antisocial outcomes-general delinquency, juvenile and adult arrests, and early adult antisocial personality disorder criterion count and diagnosis-over and above prior and concurrent conduct problem behavior (i.e., criterion counts of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (criterion count). Incorporating a CU traits specifier for those with a diagnosis of conduct disorder improved the positive prediction of antisocial outcomes, with a very low false-positive rate. There was minimal evidence of moderation by sex, race, or urban/rural status. Urban/rural status moderated one finding, with being from an urban area associated with stronger relations between CU traits and adult arrests. Findings clearly support the inclusion of CU traits as a specifier for the diagnosis of conduct disorder, at least with respect to predictive validity.

We used the bootstrap to establish the statistical significance of the RV and to identify key factors affecting its significance. Methods Based on responses from 453 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients to 16 CKD-specific and generic PRO measures, RVs were computed to determine how well each measure discriminated across clinically-defined groups of patients compared to the most discriminating (reference) measure. Statistical significance of RV was quantified by the 95% bootstrap confidence interval. Simulations examined the effects of sample size, denominator F-statistic, correlation between comparator and reference measures, and number of bootstrap replicates. Results The statistical significance of the RV increased as the magnitude of denominator F-statistic increased or as the correlation between comparator and reference measures increased. A denominator F-statistic of 57 conveyed sufficient power (80%) to detect an RV of 0.6 for two measures correlated at râ=â0.7. Larger denominator F-statistics or higher correlations provided greater power. Larger sample size with a fixed denominator F-statistic or more bootstrap replicates (beyond 500) had minimal impact. Conclusions The bootstrap is valuable for establishing the statistical significance of RV estimates. A reasonably large denominator F-statistic (Fâ>â57) is required for adequate power when using the RV to compare the validity of measures with small or moderate correlations (râ<â0.7). Substantially greater power can be achieved when comparing measures of a very high correlation (râ>â0.9).

Since its inception in 1999, there has been debate over the reliability and validity of the OASIS as a research tool and outcome measure. A systematic literature review of English-language articles identified 12 studies published in the last 10 years examining the validity and reliability of the OASIS. Empirical findings indicate the validity and reliability of the OASIS range from low to moderate but vary depending on the item studied. Limitations in the existing research include: nonrepresentative samples; inconsistencies in methods used, items tested, measurement, and statistical procedures; and the changes to the OASIS itself over time. The inconsistencies suggest that these results are tentative at best; additional research is needed to confirm the value of the OASIS for measuring patient outcomes, research, and quality improvement.

An extensive literature search was done on PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to identify articles that described or used at least one questionnaire to assess refractive surgery outcomes. The information on content quality, validity, reliability, responsiveness, and psychometric properties was extracted and analyzed based on an extensive set of quality criteria. Eighty-one articles describing 27 questionnaires (12 refractive error-specific, including 4 refractive surgery-specific, 7 vision-but-non-refractive, and 8 generic) were included in the review. Most articles (56, 69.1%) described refractive error-specific questionnaires. The Quality of Life Impact of Refractive Correction (QIRC), the Quality of Vision (QoV), and the Near Activity Visual Questionnaire (NAVQ) were originally constructed using Rasch analysis; others were developed using the Classical Test Theory. The National Eye Institute Refractive Quality of Life questionnaire was the most frequently used questionnaire, but it does not provide a valid measurement. The QoV, QIRC, and NAVQ are the three best existing questionnaires to assess visual symptoms, quality of life, and activity limitations, respectively. This review identified three superior quality questionnaires for measuring different aspects of quality of life in refractive surgery. Clinicians and researchers should choose a questionnaire based on the concept being measured with superior psychometric properties. [J Refract Surg. 2017;33(6):416-424.].

Research Approach Cross-sectional, prospective, qualitative design. Setting Six outpatient oncology clinics within the University of Michigan Health Systemâs comprehensive cancer center in Ann Arbor. Participants 25 adults with multiple myeloma or breast, gynecologic, gastrointestinal, or head and neck malignancies experiencing peripheral neuropathy caused by neurotoxic chemotherapy. Methodologic Approach Cognitive interviewing methodology was used to evaluate the content validity of a 16-item version of the QLQ-CIPN20 instrument. Findings Minor changes were made to three questions to enhance readability. Twelve questions were revised to define unfamiliar terminology, clarify the location of neuropathy, and emphasize important aspects. One question was deleted because of clinical and conceptual redundancy with other items, as well as concerns regarding generalizability and social desirability. Interpretation Cognitive interviewing methodology revealed inconsistencies between patientsâ understanding and researchersâ intent, along with points that required clarification to avoid misunderstanding. Implications for Nursing Patientsâ interpretations of the instrumentâs items were inconsistent with the intended meanings of the questions. One item was dropped and others were revised, resulting in greater consistency in how patients, clinicians, and researchers interpreted the itemsâ meanings and improving the instrumentâs content validity. Following additional revision and psychometric testing, the QLQ-CIPN20 could evolve into a gold-standard CIPN patient-reported outcome measure.

ABC Children's Medical Center is challenged with developing comprehensive outcome measures for an employed physician group. An extensive literature review validates that physician outcomes must move beyond revenue production and measure all aspects of care delivery. The proposed measurement model for this physician group is a trilogy model. It includes measures of cost, quality, and service. While these measures can be examined separately, it is imperative to understand their integration in determining an organization's competitive advantage. The recommended measurements for the physician group must be consistent with the overall organizational goals. The long-term impact will be better utilization of resources. This will result in the most cost effective, quality care for the health care consumer.\n\nPatient-Reported Outcome Measures in Dysphagia: A Systematic Review of Instrument Development and Validation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPatel, Dhyanesh A.; Sharda, Rohit; Hovis, Kristen L.; Nichols, Erin E.; Sathe, Nila; Penson, David F.; Feurer, Irene D.; McPheeters, Melissa L.; Vaezi, Michael F.; Francis, David O.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nObjective Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are commonly used to capture patient experience with dysphagia and to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Inappropriate application can lead to distorted results in clinical studies. A systematic review of the literature on dysphagia-related PRO measures was performed to 1) identify all currently available measures and 2) to evaluate each for the presence of important measurement properties that would affect their applicability. Design MEDLINE via the PubMed interface, the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Health and Psychosocial Instrument database were searched using relevant vocabulary terms and key terms related to PRO measures and dysphagia. Three independent investigators performed abstract and full text reviews. Each study meeting criteria was evaluated using an 18-item checklist developed a priori that assessed multiple domains: 1) conceptual model, 2) content validity, 3) reliability, 4) construct validity, 6) scoring and interpretation, and 7) burden and presentation. Results Of 4950 abstracts reviewed, a total of 34 dysphagia-related PRO measures (publication year 1987 â 2014) met criteria for extraction and analysis. Several PRO measures were of high quality (MADS for achalasia, SWAL-QOL and SSQ for oropharyngeal dysphagia, PROMIS-GI for general dysphagia, EORTC-QLQ-OG25 for esophageal cancer, ROMP-swallowing for Parkinsonâs disease, DSQ-EoE for eosinophilic esophagitis, and SOAL for total laryngectomy-related dysphagia). In all, 17 met at least one criterion per domain. Thematic deficiencies in current measures were evident including: 1) direct patient involvement in content development, 2) empirically justified dimensionality, 3) demonstrable responsiveness to change, 4) plan for interpreting missing responses, and 5) literacy level assessment.

A fundamental aspect in the pursuit of high-quality care is the development of valid and reliable performance measures in surgery. Colon resection is associated with appreciable morbidity and mortality and therefore is an ideal quality improvement target. From 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data, patients were identified who underwent colon resection for any indication. A composite outcome of death or any serious morbidity within 30 days of the index operation was established. A 6-predictor, parsimonious model was developed and compared with a more complex model with more variables. National caseload requirements were calculated on the basis of increasing reliability thresholds. From 255 hospitals, 22,346 patients were accrued who underwent a colon resection in 2010, most commonly for neoplasm (46.7%). A mortality or serious morbidity event occurred in 4461 patients (20.0%). At the hospital level, the median composite event rate was 20.7% (interquartile range: 15.8%-26.3%). The parsimonious model performed similarly to the full model (Akaike information criterion: 19,411 vs 18,988), and hospital-level performance comparisons were highly correlated (R = 0.97). At a reliability threshold of 0.4, 56 annual colon resections would be required and achievable at an estimated 42% of US and 69% of American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program hospitals. This 42% of US hospitals performed approximately 84% of all colon resections in the country in 2008. It is feasible to design a measure with a composite outcome of death or serious morbidity after colon surgery that has a low burden for data collection, has substantial clinical importance, and has acceptable reliability.\n\nThe Chinese version of the Outcome Expectations for Exercise scale: validation study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Ling-Ling; Chiu, Yu-Yun; Ho, Chin-Chih; Wu, Shu-Chen; Watson, Roger\n\n2011-06-01\n\nEstimates of the reliability and validity of the English nine-item Outcome Expectations for Exercise (OEE) scale have been tested and found to be valid for use in various settings, particularly among older people, with good internal consistency and validity. Data on the use of the OEE scale among older Chinese people living in the community and how cultural differences might affect the administration of the OEE scale are limited. To test the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Outcome Expectations for Exercise scale among older people. A cross-sectional validation study was designed to test the Chinese version of the OEE scale (OEE-C). Reliability was examined by testing both the internal consistency for the overall scale and the squared multiple correlation coefficient for the single item measure. The validity of the scale was tested on the basis of both a traditional psychometric test and a confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modelling. The Mokken Scaling Procedure (MSP) was used to investigate if there were any hierarchical, cumulative sets of items in the measure. The OEE-C scale was tested in a group of older people in Taiwan (n=108, mean age=77.1). There was acceptable internal consistency (alpha=.85) and model fit in the scale. Evidence of the validity of the measure was demonstrated by the tests for criterion-related validity and construct validity. There was a statistically significant correlation between exercise outcome expectations and exercise self-efficacy (r=.34, p<.01). An analysis of the Mokken Scaling Procedure found that nine items of the scale were all retained in the analysis and the resulting scale was reliable and statistically significant (p=.0008). The results obtained in the present study provided acceptable levels of reliability and validity evidence for the "
