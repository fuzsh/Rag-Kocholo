There was no explicit provision for an interim head of state until the new constitution was to take effect on 29 Dec 1937. The domestic functions of the sovereign were exercised in part by the chairman of Dáil Éireann (Frank Fahy) and in part by the president of the Executive Council (Eamon de Valera).\n\nMinistries, etc.\n\nIsle of Man\n\n8 Jun 1333 English fiefdom 1 Jun 1765 British possession Lords of Man 21 Dec 1672 - 5 Nov 1702 William Stanley, Earl of Derby (b. 1654 - d. 1702) 5 Nov 1702 - 1 Feb 1736 James Stanley, Earl of Derby (b. 1664 - d. 1736) 1 Feb 1736 - 8 Jan 1764 James Murray, Duke of Atholl (b. 1690 - d. 1764) 8 Jan 1764 - 1 Jun 1765 Charlotte Murray, Baroness Strange (f) (b. 1731 - d. 1805) 8 Jan 1764 - 1 Jun 1765 John Murray, Duke of Atholl (b. 1729 - d. 1774) (acting for Charlotte) Governors 1696 - 1701 Nicholas Stanley 1701 - 1702 James Cranstoun 1703 - 1713 Robert Mawdesley 1713 - 1718 Charles Z.
