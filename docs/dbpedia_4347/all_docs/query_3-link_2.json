This was in effect an 'invasion' of the Azores, carried out at the invitation of the Portuguese government. The aim of the operation was to take over previously prepared facilities on the island and to set up No 247 Group of Coastal Command. The purpose of this group was the control of operations by long range Fortresses and Liberators over the central Atlantic area, thereby effectively closing the 'Atlantic Gap' to German U-boats.\n\nEducated at Bradfield College and the RN College, Osborne before entering the RN College, Dartmouth, he gained Royal Aero Club Certificate No 714 on 22 December 1913. He flew the first air reconnaissance of the disastrous Dardanelles campaign in a Wight seaplane on 17 February 1915 and later took part in the Battle of the Somme with No 8 (Naval) Sqn.\n\nHe was married twice, his first wife dying in 1961. Four years later, he married Commandant Dame Jean Conan Doyle, daughter of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Director of the WRAF from 1963 to 1966. He retired at his own request.\n\nAfter WW2 he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Man and as the founding CO of 'Naval 8' in 1916, it was fitting that he should present the Squadron Standard to No 208 Squadron RAF at Abu Sueir on 18 November 1955.\n\nCitation for award of DSO: -\n\nSqn.-Cdr. Geoffrey Rhodes Bromet, R.N.\n\nThis officer commanded a squadron of the R.N.A.S., attached to the Flying Corps, with conspicuous ability and success. Under\n\nhis command the squadron developed into a most efficient and formidable fighting force, which has brought great credit to the Royal Naval Air Service.\"\n\n(London Gazette - 12 May 1917)\n\nThis page was last updated on 15/10/22"
