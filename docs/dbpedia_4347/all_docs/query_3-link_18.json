We bought this along with Geoffrey Rhodes Bromet's senior RAF officers sword and his diplomatic sword from his family (at auction). The sword, made by Wilkinson, is a replica of the original state sword of 1422.\n\nThe 29 7/8 inch lightly etched blade is in good condition and firm in the hilt. The hilt all good, as is the original polished wooden grip ."
