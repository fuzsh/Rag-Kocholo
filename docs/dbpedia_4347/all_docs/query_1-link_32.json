In\n\nthe rest of the school the traditional form of\n\nclass meets everyday with the teacher for\n\ndiscussion, lecture, and lab. The \\\"old school\\\"\n\nis based on the track system, where students' ability to grasp a subject determines\n\ntheir class and work. In the new method\n\nthere is one weekly large group lecture for\n\neach course which provides a basic background for that week. Seminars of ten students meet twice a week, when, while\n\nlearning to work with a group, the students\n\nattempt to provide their own answers to\n\nquestions. The remainder of students' time\n\nis spent in teacher conferences, the study\n\nhalls, the labs, the library, or the testing\n\nroom. Testing in the \\\"new school\\\" is on an\n\nindividual sign-up basis, while in the other\n\ntwo-thirds of the school each subject has its\n\nown testing day. But here the school's contrast ends.\n\nAlthough students seem separated because of the two educational programs,\n\nthere is still a feeling of unity that links all\n\nindividuals together into one large group.\n\nIt is this one large unified group that pushes,\n\nshoves, and yells down the halls each day;\n\ncheers at the games, builds the floats, and\n\nbugaloos at the Ramsdens. Homerooms\n\ncomposed of both old and new students\n\nelect representatives to the class legislatures and the Student and Social Councils,\n\noffering one more opportunity for all students to work closer together.\n\nP:18\n\n14\n\nJ HE students are unified,\n\nbut each remains\n\nan individual\n\nin his values,\n\naccomplishments,\n\nand goals.\n\nP:19\n\n15\n\nP:20\n\n16\n\nP:22\n\nT HIS year we were fortunate to have three foreign students attending Ladue High School.

Going into the Webster game the\n\nRams were 3-0 and ranked seventh in the area, but the\n\nloss of Glenn Patrick and Jerry Vouga due to injuries\n\nresulted in a 13-7 Statesmen victory, and the first loss\n\nfor the Blue and White.

Acid Rock, the Funkie Broadway, the\n\nBlues and wild stockings were the rage ... we were the guinea\n\npigs for Innovation and enjoyed it ... the Debate Team was dynamic ... recent returnees from Europe and other such places\n\ncalmed down after a hot summer ... Vincent Price Studio was a\n\nhome away from home ... SAT's and Achievement Tests were\n\nendured but not without setbacks ... Bonnie and Clyde forever\n\n... and Senior Grub Days were here to stay .. senior class\n\nprojects were headed by \\\"FOOF,\\\" W.C. Fields, and The Little\n\nRascals ...
