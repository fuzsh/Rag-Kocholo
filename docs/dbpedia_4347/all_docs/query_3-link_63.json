        "text": "Pals,\n\nOn 17 February 1915 an unusual ship arrived off Tenedos Island, base of the Allied Fleet blockading the Dardanelles. The 'Ark Royal' had been a merchant steamer. Acquired by the Admiralty in late 1913, the ship had been completely redesigned.The deck had been converted into a runway for aircraft and the hold converted into a hangar, capable of accommodating ten seaplanes.\n\nWith one exception, the seaplanes that came with the 'Ark Royal' were unsuitable for the work they were called upon to do. Most of them were unable to take off from seas that were too calm or too choopy. Four flights were attempted on the day of arrival, but three were unsuccessful.\n\nThe successful flight was made by a Wright seaplane flown by Flight Lieutenant Geoffrey Rhodes Bromet, with Flight Commander H.A. Williamson as observer.\n\nI would be very grateful if any Pal could come up with Williamson's first name/s, please.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPhilip"
