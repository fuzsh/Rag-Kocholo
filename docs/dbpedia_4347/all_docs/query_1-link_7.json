        "text": "The Isle of Man (Manx: Ellan Vannin), otherwise known simply as Mann (Manx: Mannin), is a self-governing British Crown Dependency, located in the Irish Sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor, but its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of the British Government. The official language of the Isle of Man is English, while Manx Gaelic has also had official status since 1985. Manx language has traditionally been spoken but is now considered \"critically endangered\". Isle of Man has an area of 572 km2 (221 sq mi). Capital: Douglas (Castletown to 1874).

In that year, King Edward III invested local feudal authority to the Montague family. The Isle of Man had never surrendered its local traditions, including the regality invested in the leadership of the island, and thus the Montagues and their successors were granted the style \"King of the Isles of Man\". Here is a list of these later monarchs remembered as such because they were recognized as such by the English Crown, and because they form a succession of the last petty kingdom in Britain to survive into near modern times.\n\nJohn Randolph, Earl of Moray (2nd time)........09 Aug 1333 - 29 Sep 1333\n\nMONTAGUE\n\nWilliam I de Montacute (Earl of Salisbury).....29 Sep 1333 - 30 Jan 1334\n\nHe became Earl of Salisbury from 16 Mar 1337.\n\nWilliam II Montague (Earl of Salisbury)........30 Jan 1344 - 03 Jun 1397\n\nLeSCROPE\n\nWilliam III....................................03 Jun 1397 - 13 Oct 1399\n\nFrom 29 Sep 1397, he was known as Earl of Wiltshire.

Born Lady Charlotte Murray, she was the daughter of the 2nd Duke of Atholl. On 23 October 1753, she married her first cousin, John Murray at Dunkeld, Scotland. They had nine children. On 8 January 1764, Charlotte's father died. Her husband, John, should have been heir to the dukedom, which was only able to descend through the male line; but he was ineligible since his father had fought in the Jacobite Rising and consequently been attainted in the blood. Charlotte, however, had succeeded to her father's title of Baron Strange (which could descend through the female line) and consequently held a higher position in society than her husband. The duchess died on her 74th birthday in 1805 at Barochey House, near Glasgow, and was buried at Dunkeld.\n\nJohn III (Duke of Atholl)......................08 Jan 1764 - 11 Jul 1765 d.1774\n\nJohn 3rd Duke of Atholl, died on 05th November 1774, aged 45, after drowning himself in the River Tay in a fit of delirium and was buried at Dunkeld.\n\nUnited Kingdom.................................11 Jul 1765 - date\n\nIn 1765, John Murray was successfully pressured by the government into accepting a large cash payment in return for surrendering his title to the Crown, and transferring authority on the island to direct control by Great Britain. Charlotte Murray inherited the sovereignty of the Isle of Man from her father on his death but sold it to the British government in 1765 for £70,000 and an annuity of £2,000 per year (£5,235,000 and £150,000 respectively, in early-2000s). This was done because the British government was finding the island's thriving smuggler's trade between Britain and Ireland, and the subsequent loss of considerable revenue, intolerable. Thus ended the semi-independent Kingdom of Man. Even so, the Isle of Man to this day retains considerable local autonomy, and British law enacted in London is not considered binding on the island unless the island is specifically named in the Act. Local authority is vested in a legislature, the House of Keys, one of the oldest legislative bodies still in existence.\n\nMonetary standard: British Pound = 20 British Shilling = 280 Manx pence.

The first Manx coinage was issued privately in 1668 by John Murrey, a Douglas merchant, consisting of pennies equal to their English counterparts. The 'Murrey Pennies' of 1668 were the first to depict the 'triskeles' symbol and the Island motto \"Quocunque Gesseris Stabit\" (sic), both of which would continue to feature on Manx coinage until the present day (the motto was corrected to \"Quocunque Jeceris Stabit\" in the early 18th Century). These 'Murrey Pennies' were made legal tender by order in 1679, when the Court of Tynwald outlawed the unofficial private coinage that had been circulating prior to and alongside John Murrey's pennies (English coinage was also allowed by this Act). Due to the difficulty of maintaining the supply of coins on the island, in 1692, the value of the Manx coinage was decreased, with English crowns circulating at 5 shillings 4 pence, half crowns at 2 shillings 8 pence and guineas at 22 shillings. At this time, Tynwald also forbade the removal of money from the island, in an attempt to maintain supply. In 1696, a further devaluation occurred, with all English silver and gold coins valued at 14 pence for every shilling. Between 1696 and 1840, Manx copper coins circulated alongside first English, and later British silver and gold coins at the rate of 14 pence to 1 shilling. As in England, there were 20 shillings to the pound. Thus, after 1696, £100 sterling was worth £116 13s 4d Manx. In 1708, the Isle of Man Government approached the Royal Mint, and requested that coinage be issued for the island. The then Master of the Mint, Sir Isaac Newton, refused. As a result, the first Government issue of coins on Man took place in 1709. In 1709, pennies (£300 in total) and halfpennies (£200 in total) were introduced. This coinage was made legal tender on 24 June 1710. In 1733 Tynwald took the opportunity to prohibit the circulation of any 'base' (not silver or gold) coinage other than that issued by the Government. An additional issue of these coins occurred in 1733 (£250 in pennies, £150 in halfpennies). These issues of coins have the crest of the Stanley family, Lords of Mann, on the obverse (an eagle and child on a cap), together with the Stanley family motto, \"Sans Changer\". The 1709 issue was a poor quality casting produced in England; the 1733 issue was a higher-quality struck coin produced in Castletown. An updated issue of Manx coinage was produced in 1758, totalling £400. It replaced the crest of the Stanley family with a depiction of the Ducal coronet of the Duke of Atholl above the monogram letters A.D. (for the Latin, Atholl Dux). In 1786, a new design of coinage was issued, with the head of King George III (now the Lord of Mann) and the English state motto on the obverse and the triskeles and Manx motto on the reverse. The standard Lewis Pingo portrait of the King was used, the same as on the British coinage, which showed the King with a laurel wreath instead of a crown. Further issues occurred in 1798 and 1813. As with the previous coins, they were the same size and material (copper) as the English coins and would easily pass for them, however as Manx pennies were 14 to the shilling they were worth less than their English counterparts. Because of the similarity between Manx and British coins, it was profitable to change shillings to Manx coinage and export them to Great Britain, making a profit of £2 for every £12 in Manx coinage so transferred. This happened on such a scale that by 1830 the island was almost totally deprived of copper coinage. In an attempt to resolve this problem, a proposal was introduced to abandon the separate Manx coinage in favour of British coins. This was rejected by the House of Keys in 1834 but they were overruled by the British Government in 1839. An Act was passed declaring that \"... the currency of Great Britain shall be and become, and is hereby declared to be, the currency of the Isle of Man\", and this remains Manx law to this day. There was resentment on Man to this change, with some islanders feeling defrauded, and serious rioting took place in Douglas and Peel. These were known as the 'Copper Row' riots, and were put down by the Manx militia.\n\nIn 1839, following the revaluation to 12 pence per shilling, the Royal Mint issued copper farthings, halfpennies and pennies which were similar to the previous designs but updated with the head of Queen Victoria. The Royal Mint issued a total of £1,000 in copper coins. Following an Act in 1840, these were valued at 12 pence to the shilling. All coins issued before 1839 were declared by this law to no longer be 'current' and were recalled by the Board of Customs and exchanged by the Royal Mint at their original nominal value for the new coinage. After 1839, no further Manx coins were issued, and they gradually became scarce and were replaced in general circulation on the island by the coinage of the United Kingdom. They did not cease to be legal coinage on Man until decimalisation in 1971. Banknotes had been privately issued for the island since 1865. These were the last coins issued for the Isle of Man until 1971. In 1971 the United Kingdom moved to a decimal currency with the pound subdivided into 100 pence. The Isle of Man Government, having issued its own banknotes for ten years, took the opportunity to approach the Royal Mint and request its own versions of the decimal coins, which were introduced in 1971. In 1971, ½, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 new pence coins were introduced. All had the same composition and size as the corresponding British coins. From 1972 onwards, production of the coinage and commemorative crowns was transferred from the Royal Mint to Pobjoy Mint. The word \"new\" was removed from the coins in 1976. A one pound coin was introduced in 1978, five years before a similar coin was issued in the UK. A 20 pence coin was introduced alongside its UK counterpart in 1982. Similarly, a bimetallic 2 pound coin was introduced alongside the UK version in 1998. The obverse of Manx coins bears the same portrait of Elizabeth II as UK coins, with the words ISLE OF MAN to the left. Unlike the UK equivalent, the Manx one pound coin does not bear an edge inscription; instead, the edges are partly milled and partly plain in alternating bands.

Mintage: N/A. Minted Years: 1976-1978, 1979 AA(t) and 1979 AB(t). Engravers: Barry Stanton (Value side) and Arnold Machin (Elizabeth portrait side).\n\nNote: KM#36.1 has \"PM\" written on both sides of the coin.\n\n1979 From 1979 onwards, the Pobjoy Mint issues coins with different mintmarks, such as \"AA\", \"AB\", etc., in an attempt to make them more collectable. The dieletters are only ever found on the Value side of the coins. Coins with dieletters have either one dieletter only OR a pair of dieletters next to one another. The uppercase letters used take their distinctive style from Hiberno-Norse runes. A to H, the main letters used are illustrated below. These are production batch codes. Uncirculated base metal coins gets \"AA\", \"AB\", \"AC\", \"AD\", \"AE\", \"AF\", \"AG\" and \"BA\". Base metal proof will be \"BB\", \"BC\", etc. Platinum proof gets \"B\", gold proof has \"C\", while \"D\" and \"E\" are for silver proof, and \"F\" means silver BU, so one can easily distinguish the different materials and finishes even if their colour is similar and the gross weight is the same. \"BA\" was introduced in 1988 for circulation quality base metal coins produced for collectors. The \"BB\" in fact is considered as base metal Proof (Diamond Finish). \"PMM\" which combines the mintmark \"PM\" with the year date \"MM\" as the roman numerals are seen on 2000 coins. There are many more codes with special meanings such as \"CC\", \"CD\", \"CE\", as well as \"DD\", \"DE\", and finally \"CB\". Note that the bullion sovereigns, angels and nobles use their own \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"X\" series.\n\nVariations in Dietletters: The dieletter pairs of this series are of course found on the normal strike pieces of very many types including (of course) the series KM-207, 208, 209.1, 209.2, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215. However, of note is the fact that for this particular series the dieletter pairs are known to wander. On the 1 Penny (KM-207) there are three positions/orientations, all three of which occur on the 1991 pieces (the dieletters are titled right downwards, straight side by side or straight but the right one slightly below). This wandering sees the dieletter pair in two very distinct places on the 2 Pences (KM-208) with both positions known for the1991AA (the dieletters are on the left, below the jug stand but in some coins above the jug stand). There are also two distinct positions on each of the 50 Pence (KM-212). On the 5 Pence (KM-209.2) and the 1 Pound (KM-213) there are three positions, two of which are a little similar. On the 20 Pence (KM-211) the variation in dieletter position is negligible. In KM#902.2, 5 pence, the position of the dieletters and mint mark \"PM\" are on opposite direction of coins dated 1998 and 1999. In 1998, the dieletters are at center right side, near the trouser of the golfer while in 1999, the dieletter are at the left side, above the hole. Similarly KM#1039, 10 pence, the position of the dieletters and mint mark \"PM\" are on opposite direction of coins dated 2002 and 2003.\n\nNote: (t) - The coins of the circulation types of 1979 (year of the Millennium of Tynwald) have on them a small stylised triskelion in addition to the dieletters.\n\nSame as KM#33 One Penny mentioned above, but...\n\nYear: 1979 PM(t).

A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 piano concertos, 1 violin concerto, 32 piano sonatas, 16 string quartets, his great Mass the Missa solemnis, and one opera, Fidelio. Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and by composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe. At the age of 21 he moved to Vienna, where he began studying composition with Joseph Haydn, and gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. By his late 20s his hearing began to deteriorate, and by the last decade of his life he was almost totally deaf. In 1811 he gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from these last 15 years of his life.\n\nKM#81 One Crown. Year: 1981.
