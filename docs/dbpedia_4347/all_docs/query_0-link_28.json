In June, 1940, during an offensive mission over France, six Messerschmitt 109's were destroyed, two of them by Wing Commander Beamish himself, and twelve driven off. One day recently he assisted in the destruction of a Messerschmitt no, whilst leading the escort to a convoy, and three days later he shot down a Dornier 17. This officer's outstanding leadership and high courage have inspired all those under his command with great energy and dash.\n\n** Group Captain Beamish commanded a Royal Air Force Station from October, 1940, to March, 1941, and during that period carried out 71 operational sorties in which he destroyed an enemy fighter, probably destroyed three other hostile aircraft and damaged others. Since his appointment to Group headquarters he has taken part in further sorties and has probably destroyed two more enemy aircraft. The courage and devotion to duty displayed by Group Captain Beamish are of the highest order and he has set a magnificent example.\n\n*** The work of this station commander has been outstanding. He has displayed exceptional keenness in his engagements against the enemy and has recently destroyed one and possibly a further seven enemy aircraft.

He joined the RAF as an Aircraft Apprentice at Halton in January 1929 (563057) and passed out as an LAC Engine Fitter in December 1931. Later recommended for a cadetship at Cranwell, Bennions was given his ab initio flying training there but the cadetship did not eventuate. In 1935 Bennions continued his flying training at 3 FTS, Grantham and in January 1936 he was posted to 41 Squadron at Khonnaksar, Aden, as a Sergeant-Pilot. Promoted to Flight Sergeant in November 1938, he was commissioned in April 1940. Bennions was with 41 Squadron at the start of the Battle of Britain. On July 28 and 29 1940 he claimed Bf 109s destroyed. On the 29th Bennions was himself shot down over Dover and he made a crash-landing at Manston with damaged flaps. On August 15 Bennions claimed a Bf 110 and another damaged, on September 5 a Ju 88 destroyed, a Bf 109 probably destroyed and a Ju 88 damaged On the 6th Bennions claimed two Bf 109s shot down and on the 7th his undercarriage collapsed on landing at Rochford after combat. Another Bf 109 was claimed on the 9th and a Bf 110 damaged on the 11th. On this day Bennions landed at Homchurch with a shell splinter in his heel and a shoe full of blood. A Bf 109 was claimed as destroyed and a Do 17 damaged on the 15th, a Bf 109 shot down on the 17th and a Bf 109 destroyed, two more probably destroyed and one damaged on the 18th. Bennions destroyed another Bf 109 on the 23rd, probably two more on the 28th and another Bf 109 on October 1 1940. On this day, in combat with Bf 109s over Henfield, Bennions had a cannon shell explode in his cockpit, blinding him in one eye and wounding his right arm and leg. He baled out, landing at Dunstalls Farm, and after emergency treatment at Horsham Hospital, he was transferred to Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead. His Spitfire crashed on Heatonthome Farm, Albome. Bennions underwent plastic surgery by Archie McIndoe, becoming a Guinea Pig. His DFC (1.10.40) was gazetted on the day he was shot down. When fully recovered, Bennions was anxious to fly again and after a test at CFS he was given a A2B non-operational category, which allowed him to fly only by day and with a passenger who could look out. In 1943 Bennions was posted to North Africa, where he was appointed Liaison Officer to an American Fighter Group, which had recently received Spitfires. In Sicily he flew Spitfires on convoy patrols but took no part in combat. In October 1943 Bennions suffered shrapnel wounds when the landing craft he was in at Ajaccio, Corsica was sunk by enemy action. After release from the RAF in 1946, as a Squadron Leader, Bennions became a school teacher. Became head of department at Hipswell County School (now Risedale School) at Catterick before he retired after 28 years.\n\nLiterature: Nick Thomas, Ben Bennions DFC : Battle of Britain fighter ace (2011) Berkeley,\n\nArthur Pakenham Fitzhardinge Murray\n\n\"Boy\"\n\nThird son of the Arthur Pakenham Berkeley (1862-1938), Bishop of Barbados, and the Windward Islands and Emily Berkeley Murray (1874-1947). 10.08.1907\n\nBarbados\n\n-\n\n04.08.1941\n\nKings Field near Parks-Lane Woodchester, Stroud district, Gloucestershire(flying accident)\n\nP/O 30.07.1927 [26006] F/O 30.01.1929 F/Lt. 01.06.1933 Sq.Ldr. 01.06.1938 (retd 18.01.1940; ill-health)\n\nOrder of Naval Merit (Spain)\n\nEducation: RAF Cadet College, Cranwell (1925-1927).\n\n30.07.1927 commissioned, RAF (General Duties Branch) ... - ... ... 01.02.1929 - (03.1931) No. 402 Flight FAA [HMS Eagle (aircraft carrier)] ... - ... ... 05.11.1936 - 09.1939 Deputy Directorate of Intelligence (S), Department of the Chief of the Air Staff 1938 - 1941 production test pilot with Gloster's\n\nBertram,\n\nFrederick Clifford\n\nSon of Frederick A. and Lucy Bertram, of Hillingdon, Middlesex; husband of Doris Mary Bertram.\n\n(09?).1912\n\nFermoy district, Ireland\n\n-\n\n01.05.1943\n\n[age 30]\n\n[Reichswald Forest War Cemetery, 17.E.5]\n\nSgt.\n\n?

Reduction to take effect from 29.03.1944.\n\n** Since he was appointed to command this squadron, Wing Commander Blackburn has completed 300 hours operational flying nearly all of which have been at night. His sorties have involved very long nights over difficult and mountainous country when he has displayed skill, endurance and courage of a high order. The success of the operations completed by his squadron has been largely due to this officer's personal example and masterly leadership.\n\n*** This officer has an outstanding record. He has completed five tours of operational duty. He has commanded this squadron for the past few months and during the period has participated in a number of bombing attacks and several mine-laying missions. During these operations, despite very bad weather not once has he failed to attack his allotted target. Both in the air and on the ground his example has proved inspiring. His genius for leadership, great skill and fine fighting spirit have contributed in good measure to the high standard of efficiency of the squadron he commands.\n\n**** This officer has completed 44 operational missions over enemy territory, involving 335 hours flying. Within the past four months, Flight Lieutenant Blackburn has completed 25 sorties, the majority of which have been made from advanced landing grounds, with an average of 11 hours flying time per sortie. Throughout he has displayed great skill and efficiency and set an excellent example. He is always ready to carry out any duty and his experience has proved invaluable.\n\n***** This officer is engaged on his second tour of operational flying. As flight commander he has displayed outstanding enthusiasm and keenness, which has proved a source of inspiration. Undeterred by enemy opposition, he always presses home his attacks with the utmost skill and determination. Recently, over Benghazi, his aircraft was held in searchlight beams and subjected to accurate anti-aircraft fire. Despite this, he made another run over the area and released his bombs alongside a ship moored in the outer Mole. On another occasion, in similar circumstances, at Martuba, Squadron Leader Blackburn bombed the landing ground, starting three fires. His efficiency is of a high standard.\n\nEducation: Wellington College, Berkshire; Oxford University\n\n22.12.1936\n\ncommissioned, Reserve of Air Force Officers, Royal Air Force Reserve (General Duties Branch)\n\n57 Squadron RAF\n\n?\n\n-\n\n(11.1941?)\n\n70 Squadron RAF\n\n05.1942\n\n-\n\n08.1942\n\nCommanding Officer, 104 Squadron RAF\n\n09.1942\n\n-\n\n11.1942\n\nsurvived the torpedoing of the troop ship Laconia, was captured, escaped & made his way back to American lines in Morocco\n\n?\n\n-\n\n(10.1943?)\n\nCommanding Officer, 148 Squadron RAF\n\n03.1944\n\n-\n\n07.1944\n\nCommanding Officer, 227 Squadron RAF\n\n?\n\n-\n\n(12.1944?)\n\nCommanding Officer, 159 Squadron RAF\n\n08.01.1946\n\n-\n\n?\n\nCommanding Officer, 196 Squadron RAF\n\nallegedly the only RAF officer to complete 5 tours of operations during WW II\n\nProbably court-martialled in 1944 for losing some 'top secret' documents.\n\nBlair,\n\nKenneth Hughes\n\nSon of ...

He has led large formations of aircraft on many missions far into enemy territory. Much of the success obtained can be attributed to Wing Commander Brothers brilliant leadership. He has destroyed 13 enemy aircraft.\n\n** During an offensive patrol in August, 1940, this officer's flight encountered about one hundred enemy aircraft. He led the flight in attack against them, but before this could be pressed home, he was himself attacked by a number of Messerschmitt 110's. Turning to meet them, he found himself in a stalled position; he spun out of it and immediately sighted and engaged a Dornier 215 which he shot down. Later in the day he destroyed a Messerschmitt 109. Altogether Flight Lieutenant Brothers has destroyed seven enemy aircraft. He has at all times displayed great courage and initiative.\n\n*** This officer has displayed outstanding keenness and efficiency. Within recent months he has led a wing in many operations and, by his skilful work and personal example, has contributed in a large measure to the high standard of operational efficiency of the formation. He has displayed great devotion to duty.
