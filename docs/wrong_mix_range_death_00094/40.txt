Benjamin and Joseph Rankin married sisters Letticie and Elizabeth Jane Johnston in New Jersey after their arrival in America.

History of Clarion County Pennsylvania by A. J. Davis Published 1887, Reprinted 1997 Page 538

Joseph Rankin, afterwards for a number of years justice of the peace, then assemblyman, and later associate judge of the county, was one of the early settlers. He and his brother Benjamin settled in what is now Toby Township, but some time after he moved into Madison township. These two brothers married two sisters, which was not so remarkable as the fact that the two families lived amicably in the same house, strictly observing the following peculiar arrangements: Joseph, being the eldest brother, did all the managing of affairs in which the male portion of the household had any part; on the other hand, Mrs. Benjamin, being the elder of the two wives, had absolute control of the female portion of the family, their cares, and their belongings, even to chastising all the daughters of both families, while Mr. Joseph did the whipping that was needed by the boys on both sides of the house.

According to Roy Rankin, son of Heber Ivo Rankin, Benjamin and his brother Joseph had to leave Ireland because they had been caught poaching rabbits on the Kings land and had to flee the country for their lives. I subsequently found this same story on a website about the Somerville family from which Roy also descends so I don't know for sure which family this story applies too.

Letter from Elva Glenn to Ronna Dumas says in part:

"These two brothers (Benjamin and Joseph Rankin) always stuck together. Their farm's in Toby township, Clarion Co., PA adjoined each other. They were always very close friends too, for brothers."

A letter from Heber Rankin says:

"Joseph and Benjamin Rankin came to America together, landing at Boston, Mass., on June 18, 1798. They entered Penna. on April 14, 1802 and settled in Armstrong Co. and later (1805) moved to Toby Twp., Clarion Co., Penna. Joseph was County Commissioner for Armstrong Co., and Associate Judge of the same Co. in 1829 and a member of the Penna. Legislature from Armstrong Co. for one term. Joseph and his cousin James M. Rankin, were very well educated. It must have been some school in Ireland." 9 16 27 28
