        "text": "1600 Â· The Honourable East India Company\n\nThe Honourable East India Company, a British joint-stock company, was established in 1600 for trade in the Indian Ocean region. At its height, the British East India Company had a private army which was twice the size of the British Army, ruled large sections of India, and revenues in the millions.\n\n1606\n\nOn December 6, 1606, the journey to Virginia began on three ships: the Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery. In 1607, 104 English men and boys arrived in North America to start a settlement. On May 13 they picked Jamestown, Virginia for their settlement, which was named after their King, James I. The settlement became the first permanent English settlement in North America... In 1698, fire struck Jamestown. The fire was evidently started by a prisoner awaiting execution in the nearby prison. The fire destroyed the prison and the statehouse, though many of the public records were saved. In 1699, the government and capital were moved from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, renamed Williamsburg. People continued to live on Jamestown Island and owned farm lands, but it ceased to be a town.\n\n1620 Â· The Pilgrims Board the Mayflower\n\n\"The Pilgrims boarded the Mayflower in search of religious freedom in the New World in September 1620. The Mayflower set sail from Plymouth, England, with 102 passengers, 40 of whom called themselves \"\"Saints.\"\" After two stormy months at sea, the ship reached the New World. Nearly half of the group died during their first winter due to malnutrition and the harsh New England winter.\""
