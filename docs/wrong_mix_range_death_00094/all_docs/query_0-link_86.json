        "text": "Biographical Timelines\n\nResearched, compiled and written by CNP\n\nMusco W. Boulware\n\nMusco W. Boulware was a son of Benjamin J. Boulware and Sarah Barber Richmond and a grandson of Musco William Boulware, Sr. and Nancy Pickett.\n\nMusco W. Boulware may be the same as M. Boulware who served in Company A, 10th Battalion, South Carolina Cavalry, CSA. He is not to be confused with his cousin, also named Musco Boulware (born 1820), who removed to Florida before 1860 and may have served in Company C, Florida 2nd Cavalry Regiment and removing to Waller Co.,Texas before 1880.\n\nThe will of his father, Benjamin J. Boulware, was signed and dated on the 3 February 1860. It was presented for Probate on 27 Feb 1860. Musco W. Boulware and James R. Boulware were named Executors. It was Benjamin Boulware's wish that his property remain as is and \"worked during the present years as we have commenced, and that the proceeds of the crop\" be applied toward his just debts. This would be the reason why the 1860 Federal Census has that household listed as \"Est. B. J. Boulware\" (meaning the Estate of B. J. Boulware). Benjamin Boulware's will states he has 6 children, mentioned by name are: Musco W. Boulware, Sarah A. Boulware, James R. Boulware, Eliza Jane \"wife of William Stokes\", and Benjamin F. Boulware. No mention by name is made of his daughter Nancy Ann Boulware Hall, but she is living in Georgia with her husband, Nathaniel Barber Hall. (1860 Federal Census, enumerated 11 & 12 July 1860) However, Benjamin Boulware made allowances and included her (\"the remainder, if any, to be equally divided among my six children, share and share alike\") in Item 10 of his Will which directs the executors to sell off his land in Georgia. His son-in-law, Nathaniel B. Hall, presented on 4 February 1861 in the Court of Ordinary in Stewart County, Georgia as administrator for the Estate of Benjamin J. Boulware late of South Carolina.\n\n(South Carolina, Wills and Probate Records, 1670-1980, Name: Benjamin Boulware; Probate Date: 27 Feb 1860; Probate Place: Fairfield, South Carolina; Case Number: 41)\n\nHis grandfather's (Musco W. Boulware, Sr.) will is dated 15 December 1824. (It was recorded in Book 10, Pg. 137 on April 30, 1828 in Fairfield District, South Carolina.) It mentions by name: wife Nancy, and eldest son Thomas, and other sons Benjamin, Musco Jr., William R., and Rueben P. Boulware. It mentions Kisanah, Musco, and Micajah Pickett - the children of his deceased daughter Elizabeth Pickett. It also mentions his other daughters by name: Nancy Pickett, Sarah Pickett, Catherine Rains, and Eliza Ann Boulware.\n\nHis grandmother's (Nancy Pickett Boulware) will is dated 15 November 1836. (It is found in Book 11, Pg. 255-259. It was proved on 23 January 1837 in Fairfield District, South Carolina.) It mentions by name: her son Thomas Boulware and his two children Musco and Nancy Boulware. Also Benjamin Boulware and his two children Musco and Nancy Boulware. It also mentions her \"daughter Sarah Pickett wife of John B. Pickett\", \"daughter Catherine Rains wife of William G. Rains\" and her grandchild Nancy Rains, \"daughter Eliza Barber wife of John G. Barber\", grandchildren Micajah Pickett, Nancy Pickett, Musco Pickett, Kezannah Feaster, Nancy Allen. It also mentions grandchildren Elizabeth Ford, Sarah Pickett, Catherine Pickett, Kesannah Pickett, Reuben Pickett, and Jephtha Pickett who are all children of her daughter Nancy Pickett, dec'd. Her will also mentions: Thomas and Nancy Boulware, children of her son Musco Boulware, dec'd.\n\nMusco Boulware's obituary, dated 8 March 1897, Ocala Evening Star, contains errors made in the spelling of his name and his age. The article mentions that 'Mr. Boulwan' died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Milling. Musco Boulware's daughter Marion married William N. Milling on 3 May 1893 in Marion Co., Fla. Mrs. Marion Milling named one of her sons James Musco Milling after his grandfather. Sadly, this child died in 1898 at the age of 3 and was laid to rest near his grandfather. Census records show Musco was born in or about 1832 in Fairfield District, South Carolina. The birth year of 1832 would make him the son of Benjamin J. Boulware, not Thomas Boulware whose son Musco was born in 1820.\n\nMusco W. Boulware married Mary J. Pickett.\n\nTimeline:\n\n1850 United States Federal Census (enumerated 6 October 1850)\n\nFairfield, South Carolina, USA\n\nFamily Number: 942; Household of Benjamin J.

Crowson was born sometime between 1819 and 1824. He died on 1 Jan 1869 in Ocala, Marion Co., Florida, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Ocala, Marion Co., Florida.\n\nJ.W.S. Crowson was a tailor and he owned considerable real estate and other properties in Ocala. After his death, his probate took almost 6 years to finalize.\n\nJames W. S. Crowson married at least 3 times. His first wife was Nancy S. [LNU] whom he married before 1857. Nancy was born in 1831, she died on 24 Oct 1857 at age 26, within a month of giving birth to a daughter, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Ocala, Marion Co., Florida. The child from this marriage was: Nancy Adella CROWSON who was born on 28 Sep 1857 in Ocala, died on 25 Jan 1895 at age 37. Nancy married Albert Stephens MEARES in 1874 in Hillsborough Co., Florida. Albert was born on 21 Apr 1846, died on 28 Sep 1923 at age 77. Both are buried in Seminole Cemetery, Pinellas Co., Florida.\n\nHis second wife was Emily E. McCAIN whom he married on 28 Mar 1859 in Randolph Co., North Carolina. Emily was born circa 1839 in North Carolina. They had a son only known at this time as H. M. CROWSON who was born circa Mar 1860 in Florida. (No other information is available at this time.)\n\nOn September 18, 1863, when in his 40's, James enlisted into the Confederate Army at Ocala, Florida as a private in Company K, 9th Florida Infantry. At the time of his enlistment, his physical description was described as light complexion, eyes blue, hair gray, and height 5 ft, 8Â½ inches tall. He was wounded in the left leg at Petersburg, Virginia on February 5, 1865 while assigned to the Ambulance Corps. He was captured while at the hospital in Richmond, Virginia on April 3, 1865. April 10, 1865 he was confined at Point Lookout, Maryland. When the war was over, James was released from Point Lookout upon his Oath of Allegiance on June 26, 1865 and was able to return home.\n\nJames married a third time on 18 Feb 1868 in Marion Co., Florida, to Sue F. HARRISON, daughter of William T. HARRISON and Sarah A. MITCHELL. Sue was born on 4 Mar 1844. She gave birth to a daughter, Josie Jessie CROWSON in about March of 1869, only a few months after James died. Josie married Daniel M. SINCLAIR on 1 May 1889 in Marion Co., Florida. Josie died in 1950 in West Palm Beach, Florida at about the age 81, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Ocala, Marion Co., Florida.\n\nOn 6 January 1869, Sue F. Crowson appeared in Probate Court of Marion County, Florida to administer her Oath of Administatrix on behalf of the estate of her late husband, James W. S. Crowson.\n\n\"... personally came Sue F. Crowson, applicant for Letters of Administrator on the estate of J.W.S. Crowson, deceased, late of said county, who being duly sworn says J.W.S. Crowson departed this life at his residence, at Ocala in said county and State, on or about the 1st day of January A.D. 1869, leaving a family consisting of the widow Sue F.

He was a son of William Davenport and Ann Hutchinson. His parents were married 5 Dec 1830. Ann Hutchinson Davenport was buried on 29 May 1849 at Holy Trinity, Chester, Cheshire, England. His father remarried on 21 Nov 1850 to Mary Whitting, daughter of Abraham Whitting, and sometime between 1861 and 1863 he married a third time to another Mary.\n\nWilliam's siblings were:\n\nâ Harriot Davenport - Born on 13 Jun 1832; Baptized 28 Jun 1832 at Holy Trinity,Chester,Cheshire,England; Married Samuel George Webb on 9 Sep 1850 at Liverpool, St John, Lancashire, England.\n\nâ Sarah Dale Davenport - Born on 30 Mar 1834; Baptized 20 Apr 1834 at Holy Trinity, Chester, Cheshire, England; Married 1st James Jackson Schofield on 18 Dec 1858 at Ardwick, St Thomas, Lancashire, England; Married 2nd Joseph Whitehead on 8 Mar 1868 at Manchester, St John, Lancashire, England.\n\nâ Priscilla Davenport - Born on 12 Mar 1836; Baptized 1 Apr 1836 at Holy Trinity, Chester, Cheshire, England.

His 1st wife was Wilhelmina Caroline Duglass Roker, daughter of George Chalmos Roker and Elisa Young. Wilhelmina was born in Nassau, Bahamas on 24 Aug 1845. William and Wilhelmina had at least 5 sons. Wilhelmina died on the Dutch Caribbean island of CuraÃ§ao on 26 Aug 1881, just a day after giving birth to her son Albert.\n\nChildren born to William Davenport and Wilhelmina Roker:\n\nâ¦ A son born on 26 Aug 1864 in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas.\n\nâ¦ Alfred Charles Davenport born on 9 Oct 1871 or 1872 in Nassau, New Providence, Bahamas; died 10 Jan 1882 in Aruba. Translated from Dutch: Deceased: Alfred Charles Davenport; Sex: man; Age: 9; Father: William Davenport; Mother: Wilhelmina Carolina Douglas; Event: Passing away; Date: 10-01-1882 (10 Jan 1882); Event place: Aruba; Document type: BS Death; Heritage institution: National Archives; Place setting: the Hague; Collection area: Netherlands Antilles; Act number: 3; Registration date: 01-01-1882 (1 Jan 1882?); Act place: Aruba; Note: Born in Nassau (Bahamas) on 09-10-1872 (9 Oct 1872); Action type: Death certificate.\n\nâ¦ Samuel G. W. Davenport born on 12 Jun 1874 in New Providence, Bahamas. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 21 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua. The 1910, 1920, 1930, and 1940 US Census Records show Samuel is an patient/inmate at the Florida Hospital for the Insane (Florida State Hospital) at Chattahoochee, Gadsden Co., Florida. He may have been admitted as early as 1900 under the name Webster Davenport as listed on the 1900 Census. The 1940 Census lists A-341 in the 'Relationship' column as a hospital case number for Sam Davenport. On 12 Sept 1918, Samuel registered for the Draft (WW1) while a patient at the Florida Hospital for the Insane. I'm not sure if he was a continuous patient or if he spent periods of time out of the hospital. Samuel died in 1943 in Gadsden Co., Florida.\n\nâ¦ A son born on 8 Aug 1877 in Western District, Bahamas.\n\nâ¦ Albert Marcial Davenport born on 25 Aug 1881 in CuraÃ§ao. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 12 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua. On his draft registration form for WW1 he states his birth date as 27 Aug 1883. He died in 1954, Duval Co., Florida.\n\nAccording to Dutch marriage records, William Davenport's 2nd wife was Elisa Mauricia Oldenburg, born 22 Sept 1857 in Aruba(?), the daughter of Johanna Leonora. Her birth record does not list a father's name. The 1900 Census has her name as Eliza G. (Davenport) and states they were married for 20 years. The application for delayed birth certificate of James Reed Davenport states that his mother was Elicia Grafenhorst, born in Amsterdam, Holland and that she married William on 13 Jan 1882 in Aruba, Dutch West Indies. William sailed from Antigua on the ship Albert Shultz into New York with his wife Eliza and 6 of his children. They arrived on 18 June 1895. William is listed as being 56 years old and Mrs. Wm. Davenport (Eliza) is listed as being 35 years old on the Passenger Manifest.\n\nChildren born to William Davenport and Eliza:\n\nâ¦ George A. W. Davenport born 4 Nov 1884, West Indies; died Feb 1963. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 10 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua.\n\nâ¦ Henry P. \"Harry\" Davenport born in April 1886, Trinidad, West Indies. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 9 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua. Died of Malarial Fever on 21 Aug 1900 in Ocala, Florida.\n\nâ¦ John Frederick Lionel Davenport born 24 Mar 1888, Port of Spain, Trinidad, West Indies. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 7 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua. He married Florence May Downs, a daughter of George Miller Downs from Georgia. In 1945, Frederick and Florence were florists in Pinellas County, Florida. Frederick died in 1956 and Florence in 1957, both are buried at Crest Lawn Cemetery in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nâ¦ James Reed Davenport born 28 Jul 1890 in Kingstown, Saint Vincent, West Indies; died in Jun 1965. On 18 June 1895 he's listed as being 5 years old on the Passenger Manifest of the ship Albert Shultz which sailed from Antigua.\n\nâ¦ Leo Victor Davenport born in Mar 1898 (according to the 1900 census) in the state of Florida, possibly Gainesville.\n\nWilliam died of pneumonia on 11 Feb 1901 in Ocala, Florida. His wife, Eliza, died just a few months later on 3 Aug 1901, her funeral taking place on 4 Aug 1901. Both are buried in the old Evergreen Cemetery, along with their young son, Harry. On 9 Aug 1901, at the meeting of the Board of County Commissioners, it was recommended that Fred, James, and Leo Davenport be admitted to the poor farm. (Upon recommendation of the committee it was ordered that Fred, James, and Leo Davenport, orphan children, be admitted to the poor farm. ~ The Ocala Banner, August 9, 1901, Page 5.)\n\nIt's probable that they are buried close to each other. I've walked this cemetery many times and am unable to locate grave markers for them, yet I continue my search.\n\nInformation from the application for delayed birth certificate of James Reed Davenport was supplied by his grandson, Billy Davenport.\n\nOther Sources:\n\nNetherlands, Death Index, 1795-1969: Name: Wilhelmina Caroline Duglass Davenport; Age: 36; Birth Year: abt 1845; Death Date: 26 aug 1881; Death Place: CuraÃ§ao\n\nFather: George Chalmos Roker; Mother: Elisa Young; Note: Died in the City district.
