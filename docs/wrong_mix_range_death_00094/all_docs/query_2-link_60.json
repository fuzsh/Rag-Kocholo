        "text": "Benjamin Harrison Walby, a beloved son, brother, and friend, passed away unexpectedly on Thursday, April 4, 2024, at the age of 22. His departure has left a void in the hearts of all who had the pleasure of knowing him.\n\nBorn to David and Patricia (Dantzer) Walby on May 1, 2001, in West Branch, MI, Ben was a beacon of kindness and adventure. He lived a life filled with passion for board games, nature, geocaching, and helping others whenever he could. Every morning he'd get up and play with his cat, Mike, with her special string. Later, he'd set up the heated blanket for her to sit on or make caves for her to curl up in, whatever Mike wanted.\n\nBen's love for board games was infectious. Family gatherings were synonymous with marathon gaming sessions curated by Ben himself. Patiently explaining the rules to all while occasionally feigning annoyance at their forgetfulness brought joy to those around him. Even when the family couldn't all be there in person, he'd set everyone up to play online games together. His dedication to helping others extended beyond games; whether assisting Adrienne with AP Comp Sci or troubleshooting technical issues late into the night, Ben was always there with unwavering support.\n\nIn his pursuit of adventure, Ben tried out any and everything from spelunking to snowboarding. His friends and family knew to invite Ben to anything involving the outdoors, especially if it involved trying something new.\n\nAs a Valedictorian of the Ogemaw Heights High School Class of 2020 and a student on the dean's list at Michigan Technological University, Ben's academic achievements were only surpassed by his unwavering commitment to those he cared for.\n\nSurvived by his parents Dave and Patty Walby of West Branch; siblings Zachary Walby of Grand Rapids, MI, Kelby Walby, Madison Walby, and Adrienne Walby all of West Branch; girlfriend Alyssa; his beloved cat, Mike; grandmother Mildred Walby of St. Clair Shores, MI; along with numerous aunts, uncles, cousins - Ben leaves behind a legacy of love and compassion that will be forever cherished.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his grandparents Leonard Walby and Adrian & Maxine Dantzer, and uncles Jerry Dantzer and Stephen Walby.\n\nVisitation will begin at Steuernol & McLaren Funeral Home in West Branch on Friday, April 19, 2024 from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. with a rosary at 4:00 p.m. Services to celebrate Ben's remarkable life will be held at St. Joseph Catholic Church in West Branch on Saturday, April 20, 2024 starting with visitation at 10:00 AM followed by a Memorial Service at 11:00 AM. Father Emmanuel Finbarr will officiate.\n\nIn honor of Ben's memory - a soul who touched countless lives with his generosity and spirit - may we find solace in our treasured memories as we bid farewell to a remarkable individual who will be deeply missed but never forgotten.\n\nMemorial contributions can be made to a scholarship fund set up in Benâ€™s memory. Checks can be made payable to: Benjamin Harrison Walby Memorial Scholarship Fund.\n\nArrangements were handled by Steuernol & McLaren Funeral Home in West Branch, MI. www.steuernolmclaren.com\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Benjamin Harrison Walby, please visit our flower store."
