WILLIAM6 CHADBOURNE (William5-4 Humphrey3-2 William1), baptized Berwick ME 6 Sep 1744 (NEHGR 82:216); died Frelighsburg Quebec 23 Apr 1816; married Berwick (int) 12 Sep 1767 (BVR, 5) SARAH WEYMOUTH, born Berwick circa 1748, died 13 Apr 1828 (Frelighsburg Quebec Church and Burial Records) or 25 Apr 1828 (gs), probably daughter of Benjamin and Elizabeth (Rollins) Weymouth.\n\nAccording to a petition of his mother Phebe and uncle Benjamin, William had enlisted in the Army in 1762 for the Canadian Expedition, remained with the Army until it broke up, and was taken ill at Westmoreland NH. His mother petitioned for repayment of sums used to send a man and a horse to bring him home (MA State Archives, 80:394, 537). William was a farmer and laborer. He lived on what is known as Moultonborough Neck, near the old Brawn Cemetery in Moultonborough NH, from the late 1770s until about 1802. He was there in the 1790 and 1800 censuses and in the 1800 and 1801 Moultonborough tax books. Some time after 1801 he removed with his family to St Armand, Canada East, and settled in Slab City, the present village of Frelighsburg.

FRANCIS6 CHADBOURNE (William5-4 Humphrey3-2 William1), baptized Berwick ME 5 or 6 June 1755 (NEHGR 40:126); died N Berwick 22 Oct 1831, age 76 (BVR, 649; 2nd Church of Berwick, NEHGR 74:252); married first Berwick 14 Aug 1777 (BVR, 198) OLIVE NEAL, born 10 June 1761, died N Berwick 3 (GS) or 23 Sep 1822 (BVR, 296), believed to be daughter of Johnson and Sarah (Furbish) Neal of Kittery (YP, 17 Mar 1817, #14041, will of Johnson Neal); married second 30 Nov 1823 ELIZABETH STAPLES (BVR, 157), a widow, perhaps the Elizabeth Chadbourn, age 84, in the household of Samuel Groven in N Berwick (1850 US Census, 347). Emery stated in error that the first wife was Olive Morrell; research by John Carleton Chadbourne has given us the proper information on this marriage as well as much of the information about the descendants.\n\nFrancis' family home was on Maple St, N Berwick, west of Rte 4 and across from Goodwin's Greenhouses. In 1816 he was taxed for 200 acres, 1 dwelling and 3 and 1/22 outbuildings (1816 YCPO). Francis and Olive are buried in the family graveyard behind the homestead amid pine trees about 100 yards from the road. Francis' estate carries a long inventory of goods, a substantial amount of furnishings, kitchenware, looms, edibles, and a good supply of livestock and feed and gear for their use. In addition, he had about 140 acres of land in N Berwick and a part interest in Hobbs' Mill (YP #2615, 14 Dec 1831, Elizabeth made her mark).\n\nChildren, surname CHADBOURNE:\n\ni.

HUMPHREY6 CHADBOURN (William5-4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born probably circa 1756-60; died before July 1793 (his heirs' settlement of his portion of his uncle's 1792 estate); married, probably in Nova Scotia, wife's name unknown.\n\nVery little is known about this man, as he moved to Annapolis County, Nova Scotia (perhaps Halifax). He was under 14 when his father died circa 1761 (Francis Chadbourne letter), and at about that age he was apprenticed to an Edward Foster of Boston. In 1776, his master moved to Nova Scotia, taking Humphrey with him (possibly part of the Loyalist evacuation). The heirs wrote a letter concerning the estate in Maine in 1789, requesting postponement of settlement for lack of proof of his death (YP #2634, letter written by his brother Francis and uncle Humphrey).\n\nBerwick, Sept. 19, 1789\n\nHonored Sir:\n\n\"This is to inform you that there was lad by the name of Humphrey Chadbourn son to one William Chadbourn of this town; his father died while this Humphrey was but a child. He was when about fourteen years old put apprentice to Mr. Edward Foster of Boston. In the year 1776 his master moved to Halifax and carried Humphrey with him and served out his time with him and we have heard from him since the peace took place, but for several years past have not heard from him. He (has) a small estate in lands left him by uncle Humphrey Chadbourn-perhaps it may be worth $100.00. He left two brothers and five sisters, since which two of his sisters have died. We hear that his brother William and one of his brothers-in-law whose wife is dead is about administering upon the Estate which we think is premature as there never has been any account of Humphrey's death and we doubt wither even he has heard that was left him upon his uncle's will. Therefore we desire that no administration may be granted till we can hear wither he is dead or alive which will be in perhaps in a few months time.\n\nFrancis Chadbourn\n\nHumphry Chadbourn\n\nP.S. I dont know but that I may come under damage as I was executor to my uncle's will and never had a receipt that he received his part of said estate. I expect the young man home soon.\n\nJoseph Simpson, Superior Judge at York\"\n\n(See Nova Scotia Immigrants to 1867, 347. \"Edward Foster, Loyalist; plus 7; Boston to Halifax 1776,\" citing 434:90 \"The Sandomanian Loyalists,\" Coll of the Nova Scotia Hist Soc 29:62-123).\n\nOn 2 July 1793, the younger brother Francis, was appointed administrator. At this time Humphrey was called \"the 4th\" (MPA #2636).\n\nIn Apr 1985, a Mr Noble wrote to George Sanborn concerning the identity of a Mary Chadbourn who married Donald Logan and died along with her first child in Feb 1808. He quoted two mentions of a Humphrey Chadbourne in Annapolis County:\n\nSupplement to the History of Annapolis County, Briggs [Toronto, 1913].

Humphrey and Elizabeth are buried in a private cemetery on Oakwoods Rd, Berwick (Cemetery records of Richard and Barbara Day, privately held).\n\nHumphrey served in the Revolution in Capt Pray's Company, 1780. He and his family lived in N Berwick or at Oak Woods, Berwick. The census of 1790 lists 3 males over 16, 3 males under 16, and 6 females in the household. The late Richard Day and his wife Barbara of N Berwick were an invaluable source of help with this branch of the family. Humphrey's will, written 20 Feb 1792 and proved 30 Mar 1792 (YP #2635) lists all of his children, with the bulk of his real and personal estate going to his son Daniel, and 5 shillings to all other children. (The Oxford Democrat, March 19, 1872, erroneously says Capt Simeon, below, was son of Humphry and Mary Libby Chadbourne.)\n\nChildren (1st 7 baptized 2nd Church of Berwick 17 Apr 1781 [NEHGS 74:221,230], last 4 baptized there 7 Feb 1792 [ibid, 223, 247]), surname CHADBOURNE:\n\n111 i.

Both are buried on Paul's old homestead at N Waterborough on property now owned by descendant Earle Ahlquist. We are grateful to Earle for completing the genealogy of Paul's descendants beyond Emery's account, and to Nancy Maze for her work assisting Earle.\n\nMany of the Chadbournes were of enormous size, and Paul was no exception. Three hundred pounds was the norm rather than an exception with his children, including some of his daughters. An article in a Portland paper talks of the two tons of Chadbournes and includes some of Paul's family as well as three from Lake Sebago. The 1790 Census for Coxhall lists 3 males over 16, 4 males under 16, and 4 females in this household.

JAMES HOBBS6 CHADBOURNE (Humphrey5 William4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born Berwick ME 15 Feb 1766; died Harrison ME 12 Sep 1841, age 75 yrs 7 mos (gs); married Gorham ME 4 Jan 1789 (Gorham VR, 76) DORCAS WHITMORE, born Gorham 7 Mar 1770, died Harrison 8 or 18 Nov 1846, age 75 yrs 8 mos (gs, Centennial H-Harrison, 417), daughter of Capt Samuel5 and Mary (Whitney) Whitmore (Gorham VR, 169). When the Whitmores moved to Gorham, it was known as Narragansett #7. They lived on Main St in a house later owned by Edwin Gamman (McLellan, H-Gorham, 427). James and Dorcas lived in Falmouth and Gorham, with her parents at least part of the time before her father died in 1808.\n\nOn 25 Jan 1810 James, of Gorham, purchased in Harrison for $800 the 100 acre Lot 4 in Range 4 including buildings built between 1806-9 by Moses Whitney Jr. That small dwelling was moved down hill and became the ell (not visible in the photo, including the present kitchen) of a larger house shown below. It is on the north side of the Haskell Hill Rd in Harrison, across the street from the New England Horse Supply building, which was given recently to the Harrison Historical Society for its museum. Carved into the mantel are the initials of James' son Humphrey. As his father had been before him, James was a tailor. He was also the first deacon in the Congregational Church of Harrison when it was organized in 1826, in spite of his family's being Baptist. For several years James was town clerk as well as justice of the peace, earning him the title of \"Squire Chadbourne.\" About thirty years after his death, James was described as \"a man of candor, practical sense, executive ability, and firmness; a real gentleman of the old school, and was highly esteemed by his towns-people.\" He is buried at Maple Ridge Cemetery in Harrison. The 1790 U S Census for Gorham lists 1 male over 16, 1 male under 16, and 1 female. Ted and Dori Chadbourne have expanded the records of Fred Babson Chadbourne to give us the account of this family.\n\nChildren (Gorham VR, 111; H-Harrison, 417-22), surname CHADBOURNE:\n\ni.

Samuel was a saddler. A memorial stone in the Free Will Baptist Cemetery bears the following inscription:\n\n\"Samuel W. Chadbourne, who was cast away on Campobello Island, and perished on the night of Feb. 14, 1817, aged 27 years. He was an amiable man, esteemed and lamented by all who knew him; he had been happily united in marriage five months when it pleased God to separate them, but not forever, having given them a lively hope that thru the sufferings and righteousness of Christ, they should meet to part no more.\"\n\nThe curious free stone monument that had been erected at his grave on Campobello was brought into Harrison and re-erected in Maple Ridge Cemetery where it now stands.\n\nii.

A widow Lydia Chadbourn died in Lebanon Oct 1859 (Records of Lebanon). Madam Chadbourn is mentioned in the Lebanon deaths 4 June 1790. A contrary report has Comfort (Weeks) Chadbourne married 31 May 1792 Joseph Clark (Greenland NH VR).\n\nBenjamin was a major in the militia, and one map calls his house, on Vine St in S Berwick, late Col Chadbourn's. He was one of the incorporators of Lebanon ME, owned several acres of land there, and was Lebanon's representative in 1781. Benjamin's estate was administered 2 May 1809 (Essex Co MA Probate #4835). Blaisdell Marsh Land, granted Benjamin by the proprietors of the town, has always been known as Chadbourne's Grant. Benjamin also owned Bagley's Grant, where he built a sawmill in Oct 1786. He lived in town, engaged in the lumbering business, but was not active in public affairs. He lived with Enoch Blaisdell and moved from town.\n\nChildren with second wife (NEHGR 82:506), surname CHADBOURNE:\n\ni.

JOSEPH6 CHADBOURNE Esquire (Joseph5 William4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born Berwick, baptized 26 June 1748 (NEHGR 82:315); died Little Falls after 1803 (Emery), probably 1810-20 (listed in 1810 US census, but not in 1820); married first 19 Nov 1762 (Bushman, Peter Grant of Berwick ME) OLIVE HAMILTON; married second 12 Sep 1771 (BVR, 118) Olive's sister MARTHA HAMILTON, died probably Somersworth NH Nov 1832, daughter of his step-mother Mary (Grant) Hamilton Chadbourne. She may have been the \"widow of Joseph Chadburn of Hollis died Thursday in Somersworth\" (DG&SA, 27 Nov 1832, 3). A woman over age 80 was living with Joseph Jr in Hollis in 1830.\n\nJoseph served from Berwick in the Revolution as a 2nd Lt in Capt Edward Grow's Co for six months in 1775; as a 2nd Lt in Capt Benjamin Hooper's Co, stationed at Falmouth in 1776; and as a 1st Lt in Col Lemuel Robinson's Regt in 1776 (Emery). Ridlon's Saco Valley Settlements and Families says he died of wounds received in the Revolution, but he seems to have lived for some years after the war. The 1790 US Census lists him in Little Falls, with 2 males over 16, 2 males under 16, and 5 females.\n\nHe settled in Little Falls-Phillipsburg (Hollis), in the part known as Dayton in later years. He was elected moderator and assessor at the first plantation meeting of Little Falls, and often held public office thereafter (York Co Session Recs, 12:140). In Oct 1784 he was ordered to be Clerk of the Plantation. In 1797, he was the first signer of a petition to separate the southern part from the rest of Hollis--it became Dayton in 1840.\n\nThe only clue to his family listed in Emery was that he had a son who married Lucy Berry, never proved. The remainder of his family has been reconstructed by other researchers from scant records and census records. The confusion between his father Joseph, Capt Joseph, his son Joseph, and various nephews named Joseph make this family extremely difficult to identify.\n\nNOTE: Old correspondence of Seth Chadbourne's, written in 1885, provides us with a proper list of the children of Joseph and Martha. This list was given to him by Howard Locke, grandson of Joseph, son of his daughter Olive. We are pleased to include, possibly for the first time in print, the names of those children. Unfortunately, no dates were given. There seems to be no record of probate in York County.\n\nChildren (see note above), surname CHADBOURNE:\n\n146 i. THOMAS7, b Hollis before 1774.

He is listed without family in the 1810 census, and with another female of equal age and a woman over 70 in 1820 census, as well as 1830. He lived in Hollis through the 1830 census.

Polly Hackley was his widow on his pension claim allowed 30 July 1833 when she was aged 77. Stackpole's Old Kittery says Scammon married second widow POLLY HODGDON? although this marriage is not included in the Hodgdon/Hodsdon Genealogy.\n\nScammon's unusual name came from his maternal grandmother's maiden name. He served in Capt Ebenezer Sullivan's Co, Col James Scammel's Regt, May-Aug 1775, was at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and subsequently served a year in Cols Scammell and Robinson's NH Regts. He was placed on pension rolls 4 Mar 1837, age 79 (Rev Pension Rolls I:148). Scammon was the major heir of his father's property by will (YP #2660). He was taxed in S Berwick for 40 acres, 1 dwelling, 1 out-building (1816 YCPO). He lived on a small farm near his father's in Berwick (now S Berwick), near the Welches. Scammon's proof of death was filed in York County, #2373, but no will seems to have been probated.\n\nPolly Hackley, Scammon's 2nd or 3rd wife, had a daughter, Mary Ann Hackley, by an earlier marriage.\n\nChildren with first wife, born (S) Berwick, surname CHADBOURNE:\n\n147 i.

BENJAMIN6 CHADBOURNE (Joseph5 William4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born circa 1757; died \"in the South\" (Emery) by 1790 (Census); married first Portsmouth NH 7 Aug 1774 (NH Gazette, 12 Aug 1774, Portsmouth NH \"last Sunday evening, Mr. Benjamin Chadbourn to Miss Polly Walker, both of this town\") MARY WALKER, died 25 June 1778 (Meteorological Record, handwritten, Portsmouth Athenaeum), daughter of William and Mehitable (Fabyn) Walker (Agnes Bartlett, Portsmouth Genealogies, handwritten, NH Hist Soc); married second Portsmouth Oct 1779 SARAH BOWLER, born 1736/7, died Portsmouth NH or Newburyport MA (Cecil Hampden Cutts Howard, \"The Silver of Portsmouth,\" Portsmouth Historical Notes, NH Hist Soc) 8 Apr 1814 (St Johns Church). Sarah married second as Sarah Chatbourn July 1796 (Lebanon ME Marriages and Deaths) Samuel Jackson (guardianship papers, Rockingham County NH, for son). We are indebted to the research of Patricia Roney for the information found about these marriages.\n\nBenjamin was baptized as an adult 2 Mar 1777 with his daughter Prudence at the South Church of Portsmouth (NEHGR 15:103). The 1790 census of Portsmouth NH lists widow Sarah, Head of Household, and 2 males under 16.\n\nA large silver piece, a vase or pitcher, was presented to Benjamin Chadbourne, as the \"King's Master ship builder\" in Portsmouth NH (Howard, op cit). This vase, along with a family Bible, was said to have been taken by his second wife, Mrs Sarah (Bowler) Chadbourne Jackson, and no trace of it can be found. It would be invaluable to The Chadbourne Family Association to learn more about its whereabouts, if it was not destroyed. As this Benjamin was of Portsmouth, and it is known that his son followed the sea, and he has an unexplained death \"in the South,\" we can conjecture with some assurance that he was the ship builder mentioned. (from the article about \"the king's silver\" in a newspaper from Portsmouth to which Seth Chadbourne had contributed information).\n\nChildren with first wife, surname CHADBOURNE:\n\ni. daughter7, b 31 July 1775; d in infancy.\n\nii.

JOSEPH6 CHADBOURNE (John5 Joseph4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born 1768; died 28 July 1852, age 78 (gs, Gate House Cem, Sebago Lake); married (int) 23 Oct 1790 LUCY GRANT (Windham TR), born 1768, died 21 July 1846, age 78 (gs). Although their stones are destroyed or hidden in the family cemetery at routes 237 and 35, they were buried in that spot. Their stones are recorded on a list taken in 1899 at the Steep Falls Library, but not on the Maine Old Cemeteries Association's list.\n\nThis is a new interpretation of the line descended from John 5, as he wasn't followed in Emery, and subsequent searches have assumed that #85 Joseph 6 was the progenitor of the line. The discovery of this second Joseph changes that. His mother, Lucy (Riggs) Chadbourne had married in 1776 Robert Hilborn of Minot, and Joseph may have stayed with his grandfather Riggs who was a merchant and innholder of Stroudwater. Quoting Windham in the Past by Samuel T Dole:\n\n\"Joseph Chadbourne came here about the year 1790. He was a descendant of Humphrey Chadbourne who was a native of York County. He settled on a farm on the Duck Pond Rd., about 1 mile from the old Province Fort, and here he built a large 2 story house which stood deserted and decayed as late as 1845.\"\n\nBy deeds of Cumberland Co ME, Vols 29, 33, and 38, we have found that Joseph, cordwainer of Falmouth in 1790, bought two separate halves of the first division of 100 acre lots in Windham, which he subsequently sold by 1802. He was listed also as a yeoman and trader in the deeds. He was in the U S census of Windham 1800-1820, and of Standish 1830-40. A deed shows that his son Joshua purchased 320 acres in Standish at the Baldwin line in 1828, so this may have been his home. This would account for his other son Benjamin saying in an 1829 diary that he went \"'over the ice' to his father's\". By deeds of Cumberland Co, his son Benjamin then purchased the Ira Hilborn (Joseph's step-brother's) farm in Minot in 1848, and Joseph was there in the 1850 U S census. His death place is not known, but he is buried with his wife and son at the Gate House of Sebago Lake. He has not been found in the 1790 U S census, but may have been with his grandfather Joseph Riggs of Falmouth, Stroudwater, and Windham (he witnessed a deed for Riggs in 1785). Dole says he was also a lumberman and, from a peculiar mark which he placed on his logs, was always known as 'old crowfoot.' He appears to have been an active, energetic man and accumulated a considerable fortune. In \"Two Tons of Chadbournes\" (Portland Sunday Telegram, 15 Jan 1911), G T Ridlon wrote that Joseph Chadbourne married Lucy Berry, which he may have found in Emery, but the following entry on the Windham records contradicts this statement. \"Mr. Joseph Chadburn and Miss Lucy Grant, both of Windham, intend marriage,\" Abraham Osgood, town clerk, 23 Oct 1790. Lucy was buried as Lucy G (gs). The final proof that Joseph was the son of John was obtained by Robert Taylor among pension papers of Zebulon Harmon in the ME Historical Society (see #67 John 5). A second document states:\n\n\"To the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusettes:\n\nThe subscriber, Joseph Chadbourne, son of John Chadbourne requests the Secretary of State of Massachucetts to furnish from the rolls and other documents in his office proof of the service of said John Chadburne in the War of the Revolution.\n\nHe believes that his father served in the year 1775 at least eight months and that at the expiration of that term of service he again enlisted and served in the year 1776 to sometime in October of that year when he was mortally wounded on board a galley as he believes on Lake George. This applicant is unable to state under what Captains he served but he thinks he was enlisted by an officer by the name of Reese who resided in the County of Lincoln in part of Mass., now Maine.\n\nHe requests therefore that the Secretary will make a thorough examination of all the rolls in his office for the service of said John Chadbourne.\n\nAnd for the purpose of this application I hereby appoint F....

Zebulon's grandson's SAR application would identify Zebulon as the son of Joseph #85.iii and Lucy Berry, but we believe this was based on false information taken from Emery.\n\n155 v.

ZEBULON6 CHADBOURNE (John5 Joseph4 Humphrey3-2 William1), born 30 Aug 1772 (King, Annals of Oxford); died Pigeon Hill 30 Mar 1857, age 84; married 24 Aug 1800 (Lapham, H-Norway) MARY (POLLY) STAPLES, born 1779, died 4 May 1854, age 74, daughter of Tobias and Catherine Staples of Oxford. Their names are spelled \"Chadbourn\" on their stones in the Pigeon Hill Cemetery. A Bible, published 1831, possibly belonging to a daughter-in-law, gives Zebulon's birth as 1773 (Bible in possession of Gordon Chadbourne, Louisville KY). King wrote that Zebulon was from Kennebunk, although his parents were married in Falmouth. He was probably the son under 16 living with his step-father Robert Hilborn's family in 1790. Zebulon is believed to have been a veteran of the War of 1812 (DAR 9:113). It is not known if there is a probate record in Oxford County.\n\nNote: An interesting sidelight to the study of Zebulon has revealed two others of the name, father and son, in NY State.

JAMES6 CHADBOURNE (James5-4-3 Humphrey2 William1), baptized First Church Wells 11 Feb 1756 or as an adult 12 Oct 1780; died on the Ohio River Spring 1794; married (int) 9 Oct 1784 MARTHA ABBOTT, died on the Ohio River near Pittsburgh Winter 1793 (H-Warren Co). He was listed as head of house in the 1790 census with 1 male under 16 and 3 females. In 1793 they left Boston with Abbott relatives headed for Cincinnati. They stocked up for the trip in Philadelphia, then hauled everything on wagons to Brownstown PA, where they bought a flat boat for the river trip. At Pittsburgh the river froze over. Martha died during the winter, while they waited for the river to thaw. They continued their journey down the Ohio River in the Spring of 1794. At the head of B___ Island, Indians stopped them and killed the boat crew. James also died here. An uncle, James Abbott, took the three children to Cincinnati in 1794 and on to Warren County OH about 1803 (Wright Family ts, Warren Co Gen Soc, Lebanon).\n\nWarren County papers say that James was one of the men at the Boston Tea Party and in the Revolution. The children believed they were born in MA, but they may have been born in Wells ME, where they were in the 1790 census.

He preached in Cornish, Lebanon, Buxton, Limington, Bethel, Harrison, and Dixmont ME. He was pastor of the Baptist Church at N Limington 1799-1802, a missionary in Etna and Carmel and vicinity 1807 to 1808, pastor at Dixmont 1809-1811, supplied them occasionally 1816-1826, and became their pastor again in 1827 until his death in 1831. In Sanford he was known as Elder John Chadbourne, First (to distinguish him from the other John).\n\nHe was of Cornish in the 1790 census with 1 male over 16, 3 males under 16, and 5 females. His first six children were born in Sanford, three in Cornish, and the last one in Bethel (TR). In Bethel he lived at the lower part of town. He was one of the founders of Dixmont and, with his sons, built the first grist-mill and made their own mill-stones in 1807 on Folsome Brook. He was in the 1810 census of Dixmont with 3 boys and 4 girls and in 1820 with 2 boys and 1 girl, so it seems one married son or daughter was still with him.\n\nChildren, surname CHADBOURNE:\n\n159 i.
