        "text": "23rd President of the United States\n\nBorn in 1833 on a farm by the Ohio River west of Cincinnati in North Bend Ohio, as the second of 8 children of John Scott Harrison. His grandfather was William Henry Harrison, and his great-grandfather was Benjamin Harrison, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nHarrison attended Miami University in Ohio and read law in Cincinnati. He later moved to Indianapolis, where he practiced law and campaigned for the Republican Party. He married Caroline Lavinia Scott in 1853.\n\nBenjamin Harrison volunteered to raise a regiment. He was immediately commissioned a Lieutenant and 2 weeks later was promoted to captain. By August 8, 1862 the newly appointed Colonel Harrison had raised 1000 men known as the 70th Indiana Regiment. After the Civil War, he was a Colonel of the 70th Volunteer Infantry.\n\nUnder President Harrison, domestic policy was created for the conservation of America's national forest including authorization of American's first forest reserve at Yellowstone, Wyoming. His administration supported the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 which was the first federal law to regulate corporations. As commander in chief, he ordered the expansion of the Navy into a world-class fleet.\n\nBenjamin Harrison ran against Grover Cleveland in 1888 and received fewer popular votes, but carried the Electoral College to win the Presidency. Harrison ran for re-election 4 years later again against Grover Cleveland, and this time was defeated in both the popular vote and the electoral college.\n\nBenjamin Harrison's Birthplace: noted by a historical marker, the home remains a private residence."
