        "text": "By the President of the United States of America\n\nA Proclamation\n\nEXECUTIVE MANSION.\n\nWashington March 14, 1901.\n\nTo the People of the United States.\n\nBenjamin Harrison, President of the United States from 1889 to 1893, died yesterday at 4:45 P.M., at his home in Indianapolis. In his death the country has been deprived of one of its greatest citizens. A brilliant soldier in his young manhood, he gained fame and rapid advancement by his energy and valor. As a lawyer he rose to be a leader of the bar. In the Senate he at once took and retained high rank as an orator and legislator; and in the high office of President he displayed extraordinary gifts as administrator and statesman. In public and in private life he set a shining example for his countrymen.\n\nIn testimony of the respect in which his memory is held by the Government and people of the United States, I do hereby direct that the flags on the Executive Mansion and the several Departmental buildings be displayed at half staff for a period of thirty days; and that suitable military and naval honors, under the orders of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, be rendered on the day of the funeral.\n\nDone at the city of Washington this 14th day of March, A.D. 1901, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and twenty-fifth.\n\nWILLIAM MCKINLEY\n\nBy the President:\n\nJOHN HAY,\n\nSecretary of State."
