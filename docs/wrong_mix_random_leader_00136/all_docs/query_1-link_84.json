        "text": "Mindscape, Inc. was an American video game publisher based in Novato, California. Founded in March 1983, its most notable contributions to the James Bond video game series were two interactive fiction, text-based video games titled James Bond 007: A View to a Kill (1985) and James Bond 007: Goldfinger (1986). Based on their namesakes, the EON Productions films, the games were developed by Angelsoft, Inc. and written by 007 author Raymond Benson. The company was acquired and sold several times during its lifespan before shutting down their last studio and retreating from the gaming industry in 2011.[1]\n\nReferences[]"
