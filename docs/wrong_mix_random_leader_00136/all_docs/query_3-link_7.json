        "text": "The cultural attributes of architecture in touristic cities are vital to city image building, city branding, and rebranding, as well as generating more economic profits for sustainable urban development, and protecting cultural sustainability. However, many studies on this theme focus on the singularity of architecture referring to its stylistic or morphological definitions, lacking attention to visitors' cultural experiences in the architectures. Considering the importance of personal experience involved in cultural activities as a process of spatial narration through which architecture makes sense to visitors and generates cultural values, the aim of this paper is to reveal the respective correlations between different types of architecture regarding the cultural experience it imparts and the non-positive dimensions of the city image. This research builds a categorization system of three cultural types of architecture, and designs a questionnaire to collect tourists' personal opinions concerning architectures and the city image of Amsterdam's waterfront in order to calculate such correlations statistically. The results associate architectures with 'tourism-oriented', 'present/process-based', and 'mass' cultural types with non-positive dimensions of city image, which leads to further discussions of 'authenticity', 'identity', and 'mass culture', suggesting the significance of urban cultural policies and local communities in terms of city rebranding.\n\nStudies on place image have predominantly focused on the tourists’ destination image and have given limited attention to other stakeholders’ perspectives. This study aims to address this gap by focusing on the notion of residents’ place image, whereby it reviews existing literature on residents’ place image in terms of whether common attributes can be identified, and examines the role of community-focused attributes in its measurement. Data collected from a sample of 481 Kavala residents (Greece) were subjected to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The study reveals that the existing measurement tools have typically emphasized destination-focused attributes and neglected community-focused attributes. This study contributes to the residents’ place image research by proposing a more holistic measurement, which consisted of four dimensions: physical appearance, community services, social environment, and entertainment opportunities. The study also offers practical insights for developing and promoting a tourist place while simultaneously enhancing its residents’ quality of life.\n\nA site like Crapolla leads us to recognize the special complexity of the issue and we have to underline several aspects that are inherent in the interventions but, above all, in their interpretative dimension. This means that it is essential that the debate on the landscape and its conservation, protection and enhancement must be based on a rigorous theoretical approach. We cannot forget that the quality of interventions depends on the depth of the notions’ considerations, because the foundations and groundings coincide. So, just a few considerations will be made as regards those associations between the landscape and the elements that make up the entity of the cultural landscape. However, we have to consider the landscape as an inclusive dimension. In particular, it seems to be, and this is especially true in the twentieth century, a big box where different elements take place. But we could understand this changing and inclusive significance through documents, recommendations and conventions too.\n\nThis paper discusses how landscape transformations and uses redefine the features of urban and non-urban (sub-extra-urban, or rural) contexts in collective imaginaries, and their role as a key element in planning policies. More specifically, the study investigates landscape transformation processes by discussing changes in the perception of the territory among inhabitants and visitors. As argued in this paper, due to its use as a cultural, economic, and political tool, landscape strongly in fluences territorial marketing strategies and individual living choices, contributing to the rise of new issues on the urban question. This argument is based on research into the social perception of landscape in the mountain area of Montagnoli, near Madonna di Campiglio, in the Trentino Province (Northern Italy), where a project for a water storage basin for artificial snowmaking caused significant material and cultural changes to the territory. Using this case study, the paper discusses the role of nature in the evolution of the founding myths of an urban environment.\n\nIn the article photographs presenting the natural landscape of various areas of Poland: lowlands, highlands, lake districts, mountains, cliffs and dune coastlines, have been analyzed. Moreover, photographs presenting diverse natural landscapes in a single image were selected too. The purpose of this article is to answer to the following questions: Do tourists appreciate diverse natural landscapes more highly?; Is there any difference between men and women?; Do national tourists differ from foreign tourists? The study was conducted among a group of 174 students of Geography and Spatial Development as well as among foreign students who had come to Poland on the Erasmus program. The research took place between October 2015 and May 2016."
