But carriers including All Nippon Airways insisted that the highly fuel-efficient 787 Dreamliner was still a safe bet, despite several incidents that have prompted investigations by US and other aviation regulators. ANA - the world’s first carrier to receive the Dreamliner from Boeing after years of delays - said smoke possibly connected to a faulty battery forced the pilots to land the passenger plane in Takamatsu, southwestern Japan. The airline said cockpit instruments had detected the smoke inside a forward electrical compartment, and Japanese Transport Minister Akihiro Ota said it was a “serious incident that could have led to a serious accident”. One of the 129 passengers on the Tokyo-bound domestic flight was quoted by broadcaster NHK as saying he “smelled something strange” after take-off and feared the plane was going to crash. Nobody was seriously injured when the passengers and eight crew members evacuated via emergency chutes. ANA and its rival Japan Airlines (JAL) - among Boeing’s biggest customers for the Dreamliner - said they would ground their entire 787 fleets through today at least, pending safety checks. ANA has 17 Dreamliners in its fleet and JAL has seven - half the total of 49 planes in operation worldwide. Boeing has orders for nearly 850.

Welcoming a <strong><strong>Kuwait</strong>i</strong> media delegation currently visiting the region at the Salahuddin Resort in Irbil, <strong>Barzani</strong> expressed his happiness at the visit and termed it a good gesture by ‘a group of highly educated <strong><strong>Kuwait</strong>i</strong> elite’ who wish to have a closer look at the region. “Relations between <strong>Kuwait</strong> and Kurdistan region are very strong and we have a lot in common - as peoples, we both suffered from the Baath regime of Saddam Hussein. For three decades, the <strong>Kurdish</strong> people went through what the <strong><strong>Kuwait</strong>i</strong> people suffered during the Iraqi invasion,” he underlined. <strong>Barzani</strong> also recalled that when the former Iraqi president Abdul Kareem Qassim erred against <strong>Kuwait</strong> in the 1960s, Mulla Mustafa <strong>Barzani</strong>, his father, rejected and opposed his claims. He also noted that he had always felt closely related to <strong><strong>Kuwait</strong>i</strong> politicians and has utmost respect for HH the Amir. <strong>Barzani</strong> also called for a direct flight from <strong>Kuwait</strong> to the Kurdistan region to help boost both peoples’ communications. On the opportuni<strong>ties</strong> that the region offers to foreign investors, <strong>Barzani</strong> stressed that the region’s investment law is one of the best worldwide. On the rise of Islamist movements in Kurdistan, <strong>Barzani</strong> stressed that they formed no more than 16 percent of the region’s population and enjoy freedom and democracy to a great extent as long as they remain within the limits of democracy and law. “We have no problem with either the Islamist blocs or any other movements,” he reiterated, reminding that, at the same time, a policy of zero tolerance towards any security threats or calls to spread anarchy in the region. On yesterday’s Kirkuk blasts that claimed many innocent lives, <strong>Barzani</strong> stressed that terrorism was a dangerous phenomenon threatening everybody in Iraq. However, he assured that the security situation was relatively stable in Kurdistan.

The list of priori<strong>ties</strong> will have to be worked out by the Assembly and the government and later fixed dates will be set for the debate on these issues. The Assembly will also submit its own set of priori<strong>ties</strong> HIV is turned against itself in AIDS ‘cure’ SYDNEY: An Australian scientist said yesterday he had discovered a way to turn the HIV virus against itself in human cells in the laboratory, in an important advance in the quest for an AIDS cure. David Harrich from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research said he modified a protein in HIV that normally helps the virus spread, into a “potent” inhibitor. The protein was introduced to immune cells targeted by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), where it slowed the reproduction of the virus after infection. The experiments were conducted in a lab dish, and thorough testing on lab animals is needed before any human trials can begin. “I have never seen anything like it. The modified protein works every time,” said Harrich. Harrich’s team, whose study is published in the journal Human Gene Therapy, said the modified protein dubbed Nullbasic inhibited virus replication about eight- to ten-fold in some cells. “If this research continues down its strong path, and bear in mind there are many hurdles to clear, we’re looking at a cure for AIDS,” the researcher said. Commenting on the study, Frank Wegmann, an Oxford University HIV vaccine researcher, told AFP a Nullbasic-based drug was “quite far from application”. Continued on Page 13 and then the two sides will agree on a united list. The government’s list includes a draft law stipulating the imposition of VAT for the first time in <strong>Kuwait</strong>. Details of the proposed legislation were not provided. Also on the list is a government proposal to amend a 1995 law that bans the imposition of charges on public services or raising them without a law that must be passed by the Assembly.

After days of airstrikes on Islamist positions in the northern territory the rebels seized in April, French and Malian troops battled the insurgents in the small town of Diabaly, some 400 km north of the capital Bamako. In a dramatic development over the border in Algeria, Islamists claimed to be holding 41 foreigners hostage, including seven Americans, after an attack on a gas field in the country’s east. “Forty-one westerners including seven Americans, French, British and Japanese citizens have been taken hostage,” a spokesman for the Islamists told the Mauritanian News Agency as TAKAMATSU, Japan: An All Nippon Airways flight sits at Takamatsu airport after it made an emergency landing yesterday. — AP Islamists seize hostages in Algeria gas field raid France launches ground campaign in Mali well as Sahara Media. The attack was the first reprisal by the Islamists for the French air and ground assault that began on Jan 11. It comes after Algeria threw its support behind the Mali offensive and opened its airspace to French fighter jets. Algerian state media said two foreigners, including a Briton, had been killed and six wounded, in the dawn raid on a bus carrying engineers near a gas field. “We are members of Al-Qaeda and we came from northern Mali,” an Islamic militant told AFP by telephone in claiming responsibility for the attack. He said his group belonged to a fighting unit led by renowned one-eyed jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a former Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) leader. Continued on Page 13 Mokhtar Belmokhtar"
