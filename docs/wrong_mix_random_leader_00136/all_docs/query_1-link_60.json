        "text": "Mindscape Fermentations co-owner and brewer Lauren Price and Home Brew Chef Sean Paxton are our guests today on Brew Ha Ha with Harry Duke and Herlinda Heras. Sean Paxton has been a guest on Brew Ha Ha thrice since this first appearance in April of 2018. He was back in November of that year in time for this episode. His last time on the show was this show in November of 2019 which was all about turkey.\n\nLauren Price is the co-owner and brewer at Mindscape Fermentations, whih does all things fermented so that means Kombucha, Kimchee, Sauerkraut and more.\n\nSean Paxton the Home Brew Chef is in to talk about cooking with beer again. He has had the number one Beer Brine Turkey recipe online.\n\nMindscape Fermentations\n\nThe Mindscape Fermentations mission of uniting fermentation across all cultures, including foods and beverages that are fermented. Her title is Microbe Manager. She describex how we have a relationship with the microbes. They opened about six months ago and are located in Rocklin right off Hwy 80, just outside Sacramento on the way towards Reno. Lauren did the Master’s program at UC Davis when Charlie Bamforth “The Pope of Foam” was teaching there. She has brought Alligator Teeth pale ale and a Kombucha with cotton candy grapes, for tasting. They also have some Knuckleballs, which are stuffed pizza dough balls, to snack on.\n\nSean has of course been on a few times before Thanksgiving. His chef uses spelt and whole wheat flour and a special culture to make his pizza dough. They use local organic ingredients.\n\nLauren has poured the Mindscape Fermentations pale ale called Alligator Teeth. It uses special hops, Bravo and Idaho Seven. Mindscape Fermentations allows outside food at their location and they also have panini and cured meat platters. Their place is a hybrid between a taproom and a very low-key restaurant.\n\nThe Home Brew Chef\n\nSean’s website Home Brew Chef has several beer bring turkey recipes. The doppelbock beer is Sean’s favorite for cooking but it is a style that is not easy to come by these days. He also mentions that the Russian River Brewing Co. beers are all very food-friendly because of their intense flavors. Hoppy beers should not be cooked unless you are adding a lot of extra sugars. The hop oils intensify and make harsher flavors.\n\nHerlinda remembers a salad dressing that Sean made with a Bear Republic Racer 5. He mentions that his website is an online cookbook and the recipes are set up to help cooks that are cooking for groups of all sizes, not just four servings.\n\nSean was in a movie called Beers of Joy which is available on various streaming services.\n\nLater we get to the Kombucha from Mindscape Fermentations, which is a kind of fermented tea. It is called Gypsy Games."
