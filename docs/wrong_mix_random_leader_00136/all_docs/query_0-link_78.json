In December 2000, the following question was posted on the Usenet Stephen King newsgroup alt.books.stephen-king: What do you all read...the hardcovers or paperbacks? Within minutes the following response was posted: Stephen King = Hardcover All others = Paperback Before we get started, I might as well admit that I am probably the wrong guy to be writing this book. Why? Because I am a passionate Stephen King fan and, thus, you will not find much negative bias here regarding King’s works. In fact, the most difficult thing I have ever had to do in my career so far was pick 100—and only 100—Stephen King works for ranking and review. Until the day I turned this book in, I was rereading, rearranging, reconsidering, and rethinking my choices and where each work belonged on the list.\n\n1 8 1\n\nHow Stephen King’s Fans Feel About His Work\n\n9\n\nNow, I think I’m happy with the results ... I think. Sometimes I would just move a story or novel up a notch because I appreciated it so much more after rereading it. Other times, I moved things down because they were not as impressive as I had remembered them to be. In any case, I am finished with second-guessing. The list is the list. For better or worse. I’m sure you will not agree with all my choices. So be it. But do know that I tried to be fair and rational, but in the end, sometimes I just really liked a piece and promoted it for no other reason. Keep in mind what King told Bryant Gumbel on The Early Show in March 2001 when the interview shifted to King’s thoughts on retiring: “I wouldn’t publish stuff that I thought was substandard.” Also keep in mind that you would be hard pressed to name another American writer about whom a book like this could be written. If a writer is as prolific as King, he or she may not be as talented. If a writer is profoundly talented, he or she may not be as prolific. One writer that does come to mind is Isaac Asimov. But the list of possibilities is darned small, thus emphasizing the special qualities of King’s work. Most forms of human creativity have one aspect in common: the attempt to give some sense to the various impressions, emotions, experiences, and actions that fill our lives, and thereby to give some meaning and value to our existence. —Victor Weisskopf The Essential Stephen King is a very important book. No, not because I wrote it (wiseass), but because Stephen King is a very important American writer, and this book looks at what I consider to be his 100 greatest works from the past forty years. The earliest work reviewed in this book dates from 1960 (“The Thing at the Bottom of the Well”); the most recent, 2001 (“All That You Love Will Be Carried Away” and Dreamcatcher). Counting my two Stephen King Quiz Books, this book—The Essential Stephen King—is my fifth, and probably the last, book I will write about the work of Stephen King. Putting aside the two quiz books though, (which were fun spin-offs of my other books) the other two of my previous books about King’s writings – The Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia and The Lost Work of Stephen King—required intensive research and enormous amounts of reading. The Essential Stephen King required comparable amounts of study, but the book’s primary objective also added another element to my workload: the comparative judgment of King’s works. The premise of The Essential Stephen King is for me to rank Stephen King’s one hundred greatest works, in order, from 1 to 100. The idea of ranking King’s writings came to me after completing my book The Italian 100, in which I ranked the most influential Italians and Italian-Americans in world history. It occurred to me that Stephen King’s enormous body of work lent itself to this kind of evaluation, simply because not every artist hits a home run every time they come up to bat. And also because Stephen King’s bedazzling prolificacy over the past quarter century has resulted in a catalog of works that are mostly hidden to his average fan.\n\n10\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nHidden? “But Steve, How can that be?” I hear you asking. “King’s books are all over the bookstores and the best-seller lists (and lately, the Internet), and the movie adaptations of his tales hit the cineplexes on a fairly regular basis.” All true. Stephen King has officially published over three dozen novels, a score of novellas, and more than 100 short stories. He has also done two books of nonfiction, Danse Macabre (1981) and On Writing (2000) and a handful of oddities, like the comic book Creepshow, bound volumes of his screenplays, and the e-books Riding the Bullet and The Plant. Yet the master pool of Stephen King writings from which I drew the top 100 consists of an astonishing 550 or so individual works, which included rare and unpublished works, as well. This treasure trove of creative output includes novels, novellas, short stories, screenplays, poetry, nonfiction essays, Introductions, Afterwords, album liner notes, letters to newspapers and magazines, recipes, and even crossword puzzle clues. Like I said ... King’s output bespeaks an astonishing level of creativity that is also, in many, many instances, literature of the highest order. King is the Poe, Twain, Dickens, and Salinger of our time. Personally, I find King’s work to be more accessible than Poe; more exciting than Twain; less long-winded than Dickens; and considerably more prolific than Salinger. A 2000 review on Indigo.com included the following trenchant praise: Two years ago, upon the release of King’s Bag of Bones, people started to say that the guy could write. You know, really write—not like [John] Grisham or [Dean] Koontz, but like [John] Irving or [Don] DeLillo. Robert McCrum said in London’s The Observer that King has “a well-focused literary sensibility. He is not only a much better writer than he’s willing to admit, but his work anatomizes, with folksy charm, the social fabric of small-town American life. ... It also plumbs, with unnerving accuracy, the hopes and fears of an entire nation.” Even Mordecai Richler went on record in a review of his own to say that King had been unfairly overlooked, “punished for being too accessible.” Even more intriguing is this September 2000 suggestion by Citynet writer Andrew Ervin in his essay “Nobel Oblige” that Stephen King be awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature (and he’s serious): Because of his immense popularity, King has earned the ire of literary elitists the world over. While popularity doesn’t necessarily equal greatness (see Crichton, Michael), one of the many wonders of democracy is that every once in a while, the masses get it right. King’s genius can be found in many places, particularly in his ability to take the metaphorical and make it literal. It’s a literary device that, in our time, only Franz Kafka and Dr. Seuss managed to pull off so well. ... Just this once, the Academy should bestow the award upon someone people actually read.\n\nHow Stephen King’s Fans Feel About His Work\n\n11\n\nKing is—at one time—a popular, paperback-at-the-beach writer; a writer respected by academia and studied at the high school and college levels; and a “collectible” writer whose works are also published in gorgeous, elaborately-designed limited editions often costing hundreds of dollars or more. Stephen King is popular with the average reader looking for a few hours respite. He is highly regarded by the many professors of American literature and fellow writers who are all hard-wired to recognize fine writing. He is sought after by book collectors, some of who have collections valued in the six-figure range and who are often dubbed “supercollectors” for their penchant for completeness and their willingness to pay whatever it costs to add to their Stephen King collection. If Stephen King were not as prolific as he has been for the past 25-plus years, a book like The Essential Stephen King would not be possible. There simply would not be enough works to choose from, and a book looking at less than one hundred works would not be commercially feasible. Perhaps a magazine or journal article could be written, but a book ranking 100 works (or people, as in the case of my Italian 100) requires an enormous bibliographic or historical landscape to use as a basis for evaluation. And Stephen King’s body of work is extensive enough to warrant such a critical analysis and deconstruction. But there is something perilous about presuming to know which of an artist’s works are better than others. I know this, and it was with some trepidation that I decided to take on the task of ranking King’s 100 greatest works. I knew that I would piss off some fans, frustrate others, and that my conclusions would be debated and contested for as long as the book is in print. A fan’s opinion is usually emotion-based. A fan will state with conviction that he or she “loves” a novel or short story or movie, yet if pushed to explain why, they will often fall back on emotional platitudes that do not really explain their passion for the work. “I just love it,” is often the vague response to a request for an explanation. But “favorite” doesn’t always mean “best” and, as fragile, indefinable, and ethereal art is, the creation of art is a craft and thus, the materials and tools needed to produce a work of art can be identified, evaluated, and, yes, ranked. I tried to use specific criteria to evaluate the work of Stephen King and, yes, even though the judgment of these criteria is mine and mine alone, these are still effective parameters with which to judge individual works. My criteria included:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nAn exciting, irresistible storyline. Memorable, intriguing, and above all, honest characters. The beauty, grace, and power of King’s use of language. Pulse-pounding suspense and a palpable sense of fear. An engaging narrative voice.\n\n12\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\n1 1\n\nHumor and wit. The significance of the work’s themes.\n\nIn addition to these basic guidelines, though, I also factored in whether or not I felt an intangible appeal emanating from the work; a visceral “something” that just made the work so much fun to read that I couldn’t stop turning pages. This delicate, nameless, and compelling allure of the “essence” of a work allowed me some slack in judging the other elements of the piece in question. Please do not misunderstand the purpose of this book: I will not provide detailed plot summaries of King’s novels, short stories, and essays. No synopsis can do judgement to the vision — and the execution of that vision—that Stephen King had for each tale or piece. Rather, I will try to place each work in a context and highlight what is best about it and why it belongs where it does on my Top 100 list. But as with any attempt to quantify the unquantifiable, the opinions expressed in this book are mine and mine alone, are defiantly subjective, and may or may not jibe with your ideas about Stephen King’s work. Sorry, but that’s just the way it is. That said, though, you will find that, paradoxically, I am a little more expansive when it comes to talking about some of the short stories and short essays than I am for the novels. The reason for this is simple: space. This book contains approximately 130,000 words. I allowed a thousand words or so for each of the “Top 100” essays and there is no way I could do justice to a novel’s plot in that small a space. Short stories, on the other hand, lend themselves to a succinct summary and so I sometimes talk at length about a short story’s plotline, while treating the novels differently. I hope you do not find this somewhat schizo appproach too jarring. So with all that said, I will keep my concluding remarks short and sweet. 1. Stephen King: I’m a big fan. (But you probably figured that one out already.) 2. Stephen King is a far better writer than he is perceived to be by many elitist critics and academics. 3. Stephen King is one of the most important and influential writers of the 20th century. 4. The day is coming (it may even already be here) when literary elitists who delight in dismissing genre fiction as drek will realize that Stephen King may be known as a horror writer, but, in reality, has far more mainstream work than genre. Much of his work will stand the test of time. Ultimately, it will be viewed as terrific American Literature, which it most definitely is. Now let’s move on to the essential work of one of the true creative, literary giants of the 20th century. (And if reading through this book makes you want to go back and reread some (or all) of King’s works, don’t say I didn’t warn you!)\n\nPRELUDE\n\nWhat You’ll Find in Each Chapter\n\n—Stephen J. Spignesi January 2001 I followed a template while writing about each of the top 100 Stephen King works, and here is what I used as my blueprint, with a brief explanation of what to expect from each section. (Note: The 100 works reviewed in The Essential Stephen King cover a time span ranging from 1960, when King was 13 years old, through 2001, with King now 54 years old.)\n\n1 1 1\n\nRanking: This is where I believe the work ranks on the top 100 listing of Stephen King’s works. Title. Date: This is the date of first publication, as well as the date of subsequent publication in a revised version. (For instance, The Stand has both dates listed, the original 1978 publication, and the unexpurgated edition in 1990. The\n\n1 13 1\n\n14\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\n1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nPlant has five dates listed; some short stories get the same treatment.) Quote: This is a brief, pithy extract from the work that I believe perfectly sets the stage for the story King goes on to tell. Why it made the top 100: In this section I discuss the work, including why the work made it into the top 100; notable instances in the work of writing excellence, and connections with other King works and/or King’s life. C. V.: This heading (“C. V.”) is an homage to Stephen King’s use of this acronym (which stands for “Curriculum Vitae”) in On Writing. I wanted to indicate that I would be providing a “C. V.” of the work being discussed, i.e. a summary of the story’s story, its history, etc. Main characters: The primary characters whose stories are told in the tale, as well as certain people King mentions in the work (even if they do not actually appear in the narrative). Did you know? Something unusual or little-known about the work being discussed. The King speaks: If King said something specific about the work, I tried to cite a remark or two that helps further illuminate the novel, story, or essay. What I really liked about it: A specific element or overall manifest appeal of the work that makes it memorable to me personally. Film adaptations: Movie versions of the work, with the occasional commentary.\n\nNUMBER\n\n1 It (1986)\n\nThe clown seized his arm. And George saw the clown’s face change. What he saw then was terrible enough to make his worst imaginings of the thing in the cellar look like sweet dreams; what he saw destroyed his sanity in one clawing stroke.\n\nWhy It belongs in the number 1 spot: It is more than just a novel. I know, I know...that sounds like fan hyperbole, but truth be told, It is undeniably a contemporary literature event. I remember finishing reading It and feeling the way I did when I turned the last page of Dickens’s Great Expectations: unabashed awe at the storytelling talents of the author. It is not only one of King’s longest works (only the uncut The Stand is longer and then only by a few thousand words), but It is the book I and many other King researchers and fans consider to be his magnum opus. It is the greatest manifestation of his many narrative gifts, and the book that may very well be the definitive, quintessential “Stephen King” novel—if we make the questionable leap that such a thing can even be defined.\n\n1 15 1\n\n16\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nPepperdine English professor and Stephen King authority Dr. Michael Collings feels that It and The Stand are interchangeable as holders of the number 1 spot on the list of King’s top 100 works. He told me that he considers both novels “contemporary epics” (and, he specified, “in the true, literary sense of the term, not the facile commercial sense”) and admitted to now and then surrendering to this belief and stating that both novels are his “top pick.” I decided to grant It the hallowed rank of number 1, however, because I believe wholeheartedly that the novel is a literary performance of the highest caliber; yes, even more accomplished than The Stand. In his gargantuan epic, King juggles multiple characters, parallel and overlapping timelines, a ghoul’s parade of monsters, plus several complex sociocultural themes. These include childhood and coming of age, child abuse, spousal abuse, homophobia, bigotry, the nature of existence, the eternal nature of good and evil, and the power of faith, trust, and love. Longtime King fans (King calls them his “Constant Readers”) can intuitively sense when Stephen King was in “the zone” (not the Dead Zone!) while writing a specific work. The story seems to emanate a narrative confidence and flow that seems to transcend the mere words with which it is being told. I have often described this experience as being pulled through the book; being dragged through the story at breakneck speed; the tale being absorbed by the brain almost by osmosis, seemingly without actually reading the words. This is a feeble way of describing a transcendent experience, but I think you Constant Readers have an understanding of this phenomenon. It happens with The Stand, The Shining, ‘Salem’s Lot, Misery, The Green Mile, Pet Sematary, and many other works, but never more so than with It. King was in the aforementioned zone when he wrote It (as I am sure J. R. R. Tolkien was likewise inspired when he wrote his The Lord of the Rings trilogy) and he has never been better. You want proof? In lieu of rereading the entire novel (which King fans have been known to do on a regular basis...likewise, The Stand), open It anywhere, and read an excerpt for a taste of just how good Stephen King can be. The story told in It is truly epic. The haunted town of Derry, Maine has a dark soul. In 1958, seven friends—dubbed The Losers Club—fight an apocalyptic battle with It, a monster from “outside” who has been feeding on Derry’s children in 27-year cycles for centuries. It is gravely wounded in the 1958 battle and returns to its subterranean pit beneath the town to heal. The Losers promise to return to Derry if It ever resurfaces and, in 1985, they must come together to honor their vow and try and defeat and destroy It for the final time. King confidently interweaves the dual stories of all seven Losers, plus the stories of an array of myriad secondary characters, using only italic typeface to indicate flashbacks to 1958, all the while managing to keep everyone’s story clear in the reader’s mind at all times. It—It—is truly a virtuoso performance.\n\nNumber 1: It (1986)\n\n17\n\nI do not recommend It to first-time King readers. The novel is daunting and may scare off readers who are not used to novels over 50,000 words, let alone 550,000 or so words. It requires effort and concentration, yet it pays off in amazing ways, and thus, It should be “prepared for,” for lack of a better term. I usually suggest newcomers to King begin with something more accessible like The Dead Zone or ‘Salem’s Lot; then move on to The Shining and The Stand; then to the stories in Skeleton Crew; and then, finally, to It. They can then go back and fill in the holes in their Stephen King reading list, but by that time they will have experienced a healthy, heaping dose of Stephen King’s imaginative powers and storytelling genius. Both scholars and fans now perceive It alike as the completion of the “monster” phase of King’s career as a novelist. From It on, for the most part, King has focused on the “monster within” (as opposed to from the outside). Such works include Misery, The Dark Half, Gerald’s Game, Dolores Claiborne, Rose Madder, and other diverse works; in addition to novels that ponder the existence of God and his involvement (or lack thereof) in human events, as in Desperation, The Green Mile, and others. The Mummy, the Werewolf, and the other classic denizens of the horror genre are of less interest to King in his post-It works. It may be his final word on childhood and its mythic hold on the adult. There will be child characters in later works, but It marks a turning point in King’s treatment of childhood: We get the sense that the underlying message at the conclusion of It is that childhood can once again be remembered with nostalgia, rather than fear. So there you have it: I consider It the best thing Stephen King has ever written. “So far.”\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Bill Denbrough, Ben Hanscom, Eddie Kaspbrak, Beverly Marsh, Mike Hanlon, Richie Tozier, Stanley Uris, Pennywise the Clown.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nStephen King’s middle name is “Edwin,” and in It, there is character named “Eddie King,” described as “a bearded man whose spectacles were almost as fat as his gut.” Eddie King was one of the guys who were playing poker in the Sleepy Silver Dollar the day Claude Heroux went nuts and killed everyone in the game. Eddie King’s demise was particularly grisly. When Claude began his rampage, Eddie tried to flee but ended up falling out of his chair and landing flat on his back on the floor. Claude straddled King (who was screaming to Claude that he had just gotten married a month ago) and buried an axe in Eddie King’s\n\n18\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “Sometime in the summer of 1981 I realized that I had to write about the troll under the bridge or leave him—IT—forever. Part of me cried to let it go. But part of me cried for the chance; did more than cry; it demanded. I remember sitting on the porch, smoking, asking myself if I had really gotten old enough to be afraid to try, to just jump in and drive fast. I got up off the porch, went into my study, cranked up some rock ‘n’ roll, and started to write the book. I knew it would be long, but I didn’t know how long. I found myself remembering that part of The Hobbit where Bilbo Baggins marvels at how way may lead on to way; you may leave your front door and think you are only strolling down your front walk, but at the end of your walk is the street, and you may turn left or you may turn right, but either way there will be another street, another avenue, and roads, and highways, and a whole world.” [Note: King was 34 when he started writing It; he was 38 when he finished it.] —From “How IT Happened” (1986)\n\nample belly. Claude then wiggled the axe out, and swung again, this time putting an end to Eddie’s screaming, and to Eddie. “Claude Heroux wasn’t done with him, however; he began to chop King up like kindling-wood.”\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It The flawless evocation of childhood summers, plus a slew of too-many-to-mention elements of the novel that I greatly enjoyed. There really isn’t anything I did not like about It. In fact, like The Lord of the Rings, I actually wished it were longer! Perhaps we can hope for It: The Second Millennium one of these years?\n\nFilm Adaptations Stephen King’s It (TV-miniseries, 1990); starring Tim Curry, Richard Thomas, Annette O’Toole, John Ritter, Tim Reid, Harry Anderson, Dennis Christopher, Richard Masur, Olivia Hussey, Seth Green; directed by Tommy Lee Wallace; screenplay by Lawrence D.

(Grade: B+.)\n\nNUMBER\n\n2 The Stand (1978, 1990) Randall Flagg, the dark man, strode south on US 51, listening to the nightsounds that pressed close on both sides of this narrow road that would take him sooner or later out of Idaho and into Nevada.\n\nWhy it made the top 10: Even though I think It is a “better” book, The Stand—amazingly in both the original and unexpurgated versions—still retains its exalted status as the fans’ favorite Stephen King novel. The Stand holds a unique place in Stephen King’s body of work: It is his first epic. The Dark Tower and The Talisman and, I suppose, even It, would follow, but after Carrie, ‘Salem’s Lot, and The Shining, all of an easily identified (and, unfortunately, pigeonholed) genre, King published the multigenre The Stand and turned fans’ expectations for his work on its head. Here was a science fiction/horror/fantasy tale told in a voluminous 823 pages in hardcover (complete with the only official author photo of Stephen King holding a lit cigarette) that was as multifaceted in locale and character as The Shining was the exact opposite.\n\n1 19 1\n\n20\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe story is now the stuff of legend: A superflu wipes out 99.4 percent of the world’s population. The survivors (all of whom are somehow immune to the flu, known as Captain Trips) are psychically called to either the light (the centenarian Mother Abagail in Nebraska) or the dark (Randall Flagg in Las Vegas). There are fascinating characters galore in the novel and God has a cameo in the story’s confrontational finale. King has always been intrigued with the question of the existence/presence of an empirical evil in the affairs of mankind, and Randall Flagg (and many of his “RF” characters throughout King’s entire canon) is the manifestation of this primal evil reality. In The Stand, we first meet Mr. Flagg and learn that not only is he legion, but that he is indestructible (as the coda to the uncut edition of The Stand unequivocally tells us). King is at the peak of his creative powers in The Stand. Understanding how important The Stand is relative to King’s complete body of work, it makes total sense that he would want his readers to experience his full vision of the story. This is why he chose to release the uncut version of the epic a dozen years after the expurgated edition was published.\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Nick Andros, Nadine Cross, Tom Cullen, Mother Abagail Freemantle, Randall Flagg, Frannie Goldsmith, Lloyd Henreid, Harold Lauder, Stu Redman, Trashcan Man, Larry Underwood, The Kid.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nWhen Stephen King completed writing The Stand in 1977, he did not have the power he does now. Today, King can publish two hardcovers at once (Desperation and The Regulators); six individual novellas in a row (The Green Mile); a novel and novella available only on the Internet (Riding the Bullet and The Plant), and everything sells. Everything sells. Publishers don’t balk anymore or fear Stephen King overexposure. Back in 1977, it was a different story. King was required to cut almost 150,000 words from the manuscript of The Stand (bringing it down to around 400,000 words) before Doubleday would publish it. King reissued the novel with the cut material restored (plus some minor editorial changes) in 1990 as The Stand: The Complete & Uncut Edition. (See my Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia for details on the restored characters and scenes.)\n\nNumber 2: The Stand (1978, 1990)\n\n21\n\nThe King Speaks “I wrote ‘A dark man with no face’ and then glanced up and saw that grisly little motto again: ‘Once in every generation a plague will fall among them.’ And that was that. I spent the next two years writing an apparently endless book called The Stand. It got to the point where I began describing it to friends as my own little Vietnam, because I kept telling myself that in another hundred pages or so I would begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.” —From an interview with Mel Allen in the March 1979 issue of Yankee magazine\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It The epic, Tolkienesque quality to the narrative (set in an instantly recognizable American landscape); the characters of Mother Abagail and Frannie Goldsmith; the Lincoln Tunnel scene (of course).\n\nFilm Adaptations Stephen King’s The Stand (1994, ABC-TV miniseries), starring Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Ruby Dee, Miguel Ferrer, Laura San Giacamo, Rob Lowe, Adam Storke, Matt Frewer, Corin Nemec, Ray Walston, Bill Fagerbakke, Ossie Davis, Shawnee Smith, Rick Aviles, Joe Bob Briggs, Michael Lookinland, Ed Harris, Kathy Bates, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Stephen King, Sam Raimi; directed by Mick Garris, screenplay by Stephen King.

His writing in this novel is superb and the book is structured as a five-part tragedy (it was originally conceptualized as a play), Prefatory Matters, Closing Day, The Wasps’ Nest, Snowbound, and Matters of Life and Death. Each section has several titled chapters and King pulls you through the story with amazing deftness and skill. Since The Shining is a brilliantly rendered, contemporary Gothic horror novel, it is one of the few Stephen King novels that professors of literature are not averse to teaching in class. The Shining is also one of the King works that most experts and fans believe will still be read 50 years from now.\n\n1 22 1\n\nNumber 3: The Shining (1977)\n\n23\n\nThe King Speaks “When I was writing The Shining there was a scene I was terrified of having to face writing. Writing is a pretty intense act of visualization. I won’t say it’s magic, but it’s pretty close to magic. There was this woman in the tub, dead and bloated for years, and she gets up and starts to come for the boy who can’t get the door open ... The closer I got to having to write it, the more I worried about it. I didn’t want to have to face that unspeakable thing in the tub, any more than the boy did. Two or three nights running, before I got to that section, I dreamed there was a nuclear explosion on the lake where we lived. The mushroom cloud turned into a huge red bird that was coming for me, but when I finished with the scene, it was gone.” —From a March 1979 interview with Mel Allen in Yankee magazine\n\nJack Torrance, an alcoholic writer and disgraced teacher takes a caretaker’s job at a huge hotel in the Colorado Mountains and moves his wife and son into the hotel for the winter. Jack and Wendy’s son Danny has the gift of “the shining,” the ability to see possible futures as well as the spirits of the dead. It turns out that the huge and ominous Overlook Hotel houses sentient, evil spirits who pursue Danny and his powers through the failings and weaknesses of his father. The Overlook uses Jack Torrance as a tool in its attempt to ultimately kill Wendy and take control of Danny. A chef at the hotel, Dick Hallorann, is also psychic and ultimately becomes Danny’s ally in his battle against his father and the spirits of the Overlook. The Overlook pulls out all the stops in its malevolent quest, though, including bringing to life the huge animal topiary that sits on the grounds of the hotel and providing Jack with the opportunity to fall off the wagon—in a hotel that always removes all the adult beverages at the end of each season. As Jack descends into madness, Wendy and Danny find themselves in a battle for their lives—a battle that ends in a fiery inferno and the apparently inevitable death of Jack. King’s strong use of interior monologues for Jack Torrance reflects the claustrophobia of being locked up in a hulking, haunted hotel all winter. As Wendy and Danny are trapped in the Overlook, so are Jack and we (the reader) trapped in the nightmare landscape of Jack’s mind. This is a very effective device and one that King uses for maximum shudders. King’s first two novels, Carrie and ‘Salem’s Lot, were the books that served as the genesis of his spectacular, “brand name” mega-career. The Shining (King’s first universally acknowledged masterpiece) elevated him to the perch he still sits in today, that\n\n24\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nof the world’s King of Horror (although he is now becoming more vocal about his displeasure at being pigeonholed into such a niche). The Shining is about as important as it gets. It is one of those rare books about which a book—The Shining Reader by Dr. Anthony Magistrale—has been written. The undeniable gravitas of the novel has also spawned some fairly serious literary critique, including such essays as “The Redrum of Time: A Meditation on Francisco Goya’s ‘Saturn Devouring His Children’ and Stephen King’s The Shining” by Greg Weller, and “The Red Death’s Sway: Setting and Character in Poe’s ‘The Mask of the Red Death’ and King’s The Shining” by Leonard Mustazza. In The Shining, King tackled his own personal feelings regarding occasional anger towards his children and he used the writing of the novel and the development of the Jack Torrance character as a means to try and understand those inexplicable outbursts of rage we all have felt towards our children from time to time. Born of frustration, impatience, and exhaustion (as well as, for some people—like Jack—liberal doses of alcohol), these episodes need to be handled so things don’t get out of hand and result in a child getting hurt. In The Shining, Jack Torrance breaks his son’s arm when he comes home and finds that Danny had made a mess of his papers. Jack was drunk at the time and when he pulled Danny up off the floor, he used just a wee bit too much strength and little Danny ended up in a cast. This was one of the primary catalysts for Jack to give up drinking. As Jack explores the hotel’s basement, King interweaves the history of the Overlook into the story, dramatically illustrating the hotel’s sordid past and setting us up for Jack’s complete surrender to the evil powers running the show. King’s use of “redrum” as a totemic portent sent to Danny by his alter ego Tony is clever and has become an oft-cited part of the culture. The Shining was Stephen King’s first bestseller and today, more than 20 years later, it is still in print and has been translated into dozens of languages.\n\n1 C.

In the mid-1970s, King and his wife Tabitha checked into the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado—exactly when the hotel was\n\nNumber 3: The Shining (1977)\n\n25\n\npreparing to close for the season. King and his wife ended up essentially alone in the hotel (along with a skeleton crew—sorry) and since King’s mind works the way it does, the story of the Torrances came to him and—lucky for us—he decided to write it down. Many of the elements of the novel—the fire hose, the long corridors, the ballroom, etc.—are derived from King’s stay at the Stanley.\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It The Shining was the first Stephen King novel I ever read and it is the book that got me hooked. I had always enjoyed reading and there had been many books that thoroughly engaged me. However, The Shining was an entirely different experience for me: It was the first book I literally could not put down; could not stop turning the pages; and the first book that went beyond simply scaring me. The Shining terrified me in a way no book before ever had.\n\nFilm Adaptations 1. The Shining (1980), starring Jack Nicholson, Shelly Duvall, Danny Lloyd, Scatman Crothers; directed by Stanley Kubrick, screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson. (Grade: A.) 2. Stephen King’s The Shining (1997 ABC-TV miniseries), starring Steven Weber, Rebecca DeMornay; directed by Mick Garris; screenplay by Stephen King. (In his June 1983 Playboy interview, King said, “I’d like to remake The Shining someday, maybe even direct it myself if anybody will give me enough rope to hang myself with.”) (Grade: B+.)\n\nNUMBER\n\n4 The Dead Zone (1979) She drew her breath in raggedly, her back straightening, her eyes going wide and round. “Johnny...?”\n\nWhy it made the top 10: The way King’s 1999 Hearts in Atlantis is a story of the 1960s; his The Dead Zone—published 20 years before Hearts—is a story of the decade of the 1970s, and was Stephen King’s first New York Times number 1 bestseller. King was in his early 30s when he published this amazing novel. The Dead Zone appeared after a span of extraordinary creativity, the five-year period that included the publication of Carrie, ‘Salem’s Lot, The Shining, The Stand, plus the stories of Night Shift. Any writer would be proud of even one of these volumes; King published them at a rate of one a year. The Dead Zone speaks to political vagaries; those fateful flukes of events that can often change the path of history in this country. In the novel, Johnny Smith, King’s American Everyman, awakens from a 55-month coma with an inoperable brain tumor and the ability to see into the future. Cursed with a gift he never wanted, Johnny one days shakes\n\n1 26 1\n\nNumber 4: The Dead Zone (1979)\n\n27\n\nthe hand of Greg Stillson, a third-party candidate for President, witnesses a nuclear Armageddon caused by Stillson, and realizes that he must sacrifice himself for the greater good. Fulfilling the mandate of the literary school of naturalism (fate rules man but we have the power to make moral decisions) often used by King, Johnny was given prescience by a twist of fate. He was given a turn of the Wheel of Fortune (a powerful symbol throughout the novel), but then makes the morally correct decision to do what is necessary for the many, instead of the one (my nod to Mr. Spock in Star Trek; The Wrath of Khan, of course). King’s writing in The Dead Zone is superb and powerful, and the novel contains elements of suspense while serving as both a political thriller and a poignant love story. The Dead Zone is the novel to recommend to people who have never read King or those who proclaim, “I never read that horror stuff!”\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Johnny Smith, Greg Stillson, Sarah Bracknell, Frank Dodd, Vera Smith, Herb Smith.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nDuring the period when Johnny was in his coma, Sarah Bracknell lived in Veazie, Maine...on Flagg Street. (Hmmm.)\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It Everything...but especially the final scene in the graveyard. This scene ranks with King’s absolute best.\n\nFilm Adaptations The Dead Zone (1983), starring Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Anthony Zerbe, Colleen Dewhurst; directed by David Cronenberg; screenplay by Jeffrey Boam. (This is by far one of the all-time best adaptations of a Stephen King work.) (Grade: A.)\n\n28\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “What always happens for me—with a book—is that you frame the idea of the book or the ‘what if.’ And little by little, characters will take shape. Generally as a result of a secondary decision about the plot. ... In the case of The Dead Zone, it was simply what if a man was able to have this ability to see the future. What if you were to explore that idea in the book, if he was just an ordinary guy that could really do it? The secondary thing was the visualization of this guy taking a test paper from a student, and saying, ‘You gotta go home right away. Your house is burning down.’ That never actually appears in the book, but it set the thing of him as a teacher; there were some other decisions that were made, and then it was time to pick the book up and begin to go.” —From a July 1984 interview with David Sherman in Fangoria magazine.\n\nTV Adaptations In January 2001, it was announced that Michael Piller (Star Trek: Voyager) was developing a series based on King’s novel The Dead Zone for the UPN television network. The series was tentatively scheduled for UPN’s 2001-2002 season.\n\nNUMBER\n\n5 The Green Mile (1996) Consisting of 6 installments:\n\nThe Two Dead Girls; The Mouse on the Mile; Coffey’s Hands; The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix; Night Journey; Coffey on the Mile This happened in 1932, when the state penitentiary was still at Cold Mountain. And the electric chair was there, too, of course.\n\nWhy it made the top 10: The sheer excellence and overwhelming success of Frank Darabont’s film adaptation of King’s The Green Mile has somewhat overshadowed this novel. This tends to happen when a film version is so good that it becomes a presence unto itself and is the first thing people think of when they hear the title of the book. But the film would not have been as good as it is without Stephen King’s superb source novel. The Green Mile is in the top five of Stephen King’s works because it is Just That Good. It compares with King’s finest novels—The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, etc.—and it is King giving us what all those other tales likewise provided. Memorable characters, a thrilling story, elegant writing, and a theme that tackles the biggest issues of all: The existence (or nonexistence) of God, and an exploration of the possibility that Jesus Christ has been returning to our world repeatedly over the centuries—patiently waiting for the moment when we recognize him and embrace him...instead of killing him again and again.\n\n1 29 1\n\n30\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe installment format seems to have galvanized King. He had to turn out a complete “chapter” (although each of the books was a hefty 25,000-30,000 words) in a very short time in order for his publisher to be able to get a new book out each month for six months in a row. Added to the deadline pressures, King also had to be sure that each installment concluded with a climax of sorts and he also had to clearly summarize the previous installments to refresh readers’ memories. (Some readers did not like the installment program and “saved up” all six books to read at one sitting. I read them as they were published. Either way worked, since King’s synopses were built into the first chapter of the new book and allowed narrator Paul Edgecombe to reminisce about NEW JERSEY STATE POLICE what had gone before.) Interestingly, the lack of an actual section The electric chair called “Synopsis” apparently spurred Signet, King’s publisher, to include capsule summaries of the previous books on the first page (opposite the inside cover) of each new installment. The story is immediately engrossing: A giant black man named John Coffey (“J.C.”...get it?) is found with the bodies of two dead white girls. A conclusion is leapt to, Coffey is convicted of the murders, and he is sentenced to death by electrocution. He is placed in the custody of Paul Edgecombe and his team on the Green Mile (death row) at Cold Mountain penitentiary. We are told Coffey’s story decades later by Paul Edgecombe, writing from his retirement home. But there is much more to John Coffey than initially believed—including the miraculous power to heal with his touch—and Paul Edgecombe comes away from his time with Coffey a changed man. As are we, the readers of his profound story. The Green Mile film turned a lot of people on to the (written) work of Stephen King (as did Darabont’s previous King film The Shawshank Redemption). To many moviegoers, Stephen King was suddenly much more than just a horror writer.\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Paul Edgecombe, John Coffey, Brutus “Brutal” Howell, Warden Moores, Percy Wetmore, Billy “The Kid” Wharton, Eduard Delacroix...and Mr. Jingles\n\nNumber 5: The Green Mile (1996)\n\n31\n\nThe King Speaks “As far as The Green Mile (the movie) goes, I told Frank about the idea for the story before the first part was published and while I was still working on it. He was really excited by it and I told him I’d send him the parts. I told him that if he liked it could he do it. He was very cautious and said, ‘Well, let me read it.’ Well, he loves it and wants to do it. He jokes and says that he’s now carving out the world’s smallest film niche, which is a maker of Stephen King prison stories set in the 50s. There isn’t a script yet and the negotiations are ongoing. As far as I’m concerned, it’s Frank’s for the doing and nobody else’s.” —From a 1996 World of Fandom interview with Joseph Mauceri\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nAt one point there was a rumor going around that Tom Hanks was slated to play the John Coffey role in the film. Hanks explains this in an excerpt from Tyson Blue’s book, The Making of the Green Mile: While rumors on the Internet and other sources had at least some rational basis, one went so far as to suggest that [Hanks] had even wanted to play John Coffey(!), the rationale being that he enjoyed taking roles which gave him a chance to expand the horizons of his acting. Hanks could easily understand how these rumors could begin. “That’s the other thing that’s really miraculous about this story is that they’re all good roles,” he said. “It’s that kind of ensemble piece. You know, the only thing that makes me Number One on the call sheet is that Paul’s the narrator! Other than that, all the guys have great parts. I certainly would have jumped at the chance to play, say, Wild Bill, or even Percy, although I’m not short enough to be Percy. It’s such a key thing.”\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It Everything...but especially the idea that Coffey was a manifestation of Jesus...and that he was just one of possibly many avatars of Christ that have been visiting us over the past two thousand years. (Oh, and I liked Mr. Jingles, of course.)\n\n32\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “I wrote like a madman, trying to keep up with the crazy publishing schedule and at the same time trying to craft the book so that each part would have its own mini-climax, hoping that everything would fit, and knowing I’d be hung if it didn’t.” —From the Introduction to the single-volume edition of The Green Mile\n\nFilm Adaptations The Green Mile (1999); starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, Michael Clarke Duncan, James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Patricia Clarkson, Harry Dean Stanton; directed by Frank Darabont; screenplay by Frank Darabont. (Grade: A.)\n\nNUMBER\n\n6 Bag of Bones (1998) I’ve lost my taste for spooks.\n\nWhy it made the top 10: Stephen King has always liked British writers. His list of recommended books in the back of On Writing lists several Brits. In 1977, King even began writing a “Lord Peter Wimsey” novel (Wimsey is a detective character in series of mystery novels by British writer Dorothy Sayers) that he never published, but may have completed for his own gratification. This penchant for British fiction directly influenced King’s first novel for Scribner’s, Bag of Bones, a masterful work that echoes Daphne du Maurier’s 1938 classic, Rebecca, and which King describes as a “haunted love story.” Add to that the references to British writer Thomas Hardy and King’s literary influences (for this novel anyway) are blatant. But Bag of Bones is not set in England, nor during the period in which Rebecca takes place. It is most assuredly an American novel, with American characters, set in 20th century America.\n\n1 33 1\n\n34\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nGEORGE BEAHM\n\nAt a signing at Betts Bookstore, Stephen King signs Bag of Bones for a local reader who lives in nearby Orono. (Bookstore owner Stuart Tinker is in the background.)\n\nBag of Bones was Stephen King’s first authentic ghost story since Pet Sematary. It revisits Castle Rock and Derry (the setting of It, Insomnia, and Dreamcatcher), and centers on a best-selling writer’s grief over his wife’s death, a tragedy which is somehow related to some strange doings at their summer lakeside place, Sara Laughs, in western Maine. Bag of Bones boasts an ancient curse, dazzling sequences of mind-boggling and horrifying paranormal activity, as well as a couple of the most memorable villains with which King has ever blessed us. Again (as in The Dark Half, Misery, “Secret Window, Secret Garden,” Desperation, The Tommyknockers, The Shining, etc.), King has as his main character a writer, this one a best-selling author of mysteries who has been a fixture on the best-seller list for years. Michael Noonan and his wife Jo had a wonderful life: His books made them wealthy, and their love fulfilled them in ways neither of them could have possibly ever dreamt was possible. Then one day, while running across a shopping center parking lot to help an accident victim on the hottest day of the year, Jo Noonan suffers a brain aneurysm that kills her instantly, making Mike Noonan one of the youngest widowers in Maine. Jo Noonan’s death saddles Mike with one of the worst cases of writer’s block imaginable. He has immediate and paralyzing panic attacks whenever he sits down to write following Jo’s death. But this fixture on the best-seller list Mike Noonan is no fool: Even though he published one book a year, he wrote one-and-a-half books, resulting in a bank safe deposit box containing five unpublished novels, labeled simply, I, II, III, etc.\n\nNumber 6: Bag of Bones (1998)\n\n35\n\nThe King Speaks “I hope Bag of Bones gave you at least one sleepless night. Sorry ‘bout that; it’s just the way I am. It gave me one or two, and ever since writing it I’m nervous about going down into the cellar—part of me keeps expecting the door to slam, the light to go out, and the knocking to start. But for me, at least, that’s also part of the fun. If that makes me sick, hey, don’t call the doctor.” —From King’s May 1999 letter to reviewers of Hearts in Atlantis, included with review copies of the book\n\nOut of necessity, Mike begins plundering his stash, providing his publisher—and his bottom-line fixated agent—with their one blockbuster a year, keeping his career alive temporarily, while trying to cope with being suddenly alone. Michael Noonan decides to move to his lakefront house, Sara Laughs, and see if a change of scenery inspires him. As soon as he arrives in town, he meets a divorced young girl, Mattie Devore, and her three-year-old daughter, Ki. Mattie’s wealthy fatherin-law, William Devore (whose name should, as Dr. Michael Collings has so astutely noted, remind us of the verb “devour”), is conspiring to wrest custody of the little girl away from her mother. Michael Noonan is inexorably drawn into the struggle, during which he learns some dark secrets about the old man—and about the town and its past, a horror story that involves ferocious racism, rape, murder, and buried secrets. According to King, “Bag of Bones contains everything I know about marriage, lust, and ghosts.” The novel is King at the top of his game and the last 300 pages contain some of the best writing King has published. In The Stephen King Universe by Stanley Wiater, Christopher Golden, and Hank Wagner, the authors write, “Simply stated, [Bag of Bones] ranks amongst the four or five best novels the author has written in his entire career.” Okay, so Messrs. Wiater, Golden, and Wagner and I disagree on the ranking of this brilliant novel: I place it at number 6 in King’s Top 10. This picayune difference does not, however, diminish our joint message: Bag of Bones is evidence of a master at the peak of his craft.\n\n1 C. V. 1\n\n36\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nGeorge Beahm Speaks “In Bag of Bones, King has, to my mind, deliberately written a mainstream novel that will appeal to a greater audience, perhaps gaining him part of the readership long denied him, as he attempts to shake off his reputation as America’s best-loved boogeyman.” —From Stephen King From A to Z\n\nMain Characters Michael Noonan, Mattie Devore, Kyra “Ki” Devore, William Devore, Johanna Noonan, Rogette Whitmore, Sara Tidwell, Lance Devore, George Footman, Richard Osgood, John Storrow, The Red Tops.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe title of the novel comes from something British author Thomas Hardy (a King favorite) reportedly once said: “Compared to the dullest human being actually walking about on the face of the earth and casting his shadow there, the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones.” King’s final reference to Hardy’s remark (of several in the novel) occurs in the book’s second to last paragraph when he writes, “Thomas Hardy, who supposedly said that the most brilliantly drawn character in a novel is but a bag of bones, stopped writing novels himself after finishing Jude the Obscure and while he was at the height of his narrative genius.”\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It It’s a page-turner, from the opening paragraph until the astonishing conclusion.\n\nFilm Adaptations None.\n\nNUMBER\n\n7 Misery (1987) “My name is Annie Wilkes. And I am — “I know,” he said. “You’re my number-one fan.” “Yes,” she said, smiling. “That’s just what I am.”\n\nWhy it made the top 10: Some Stephen King fans perceived Misery as a Stephen King “Scream Heard ‘Round the World”; a not-so-veiled purging of King’s worst thoughts about his fans and the nature of celebrity and the mechanics of the writing process. The Dedication didn’t help: “This is for Stephanie and Jim Leonard, who know why. Boy, do they.” At the time Misery was published, Stephanie Leonard was editor of Castle Rock: The Stephen King Newsletter and dealt with Stephen King’s fan mail on a daily basis. Thus, many fans believed that the Annie Wilkes character in the novel was Stephen King’s spin on the worst elements of his multitude of fans. [See “Stephanie Leonard speaks” for more on the meaning of this dedication.] Was this interpretation accurate? Yes and no.\n\n1 37 1\n\n38\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “I wrote most of Misery by hand, sitting at Kipling’s desk in Brown’s Hotel in London...Then I found out he died at the desk. That spooked me, so I quit the hotel.” —From a 1998 interview with journalist Peter Conrad\n\nAnnie Wilkes is the worst manifestation of a “Number One Fan,” but the scenario of a writer being held captive and forced to write a book “to order” is simply an imaginative writer asking “What if?” and then putting on paper the results of his speculative musings. Misery was one of five books King published during a 14-month period of astonishing creativity. This span also included the publication of It (Chapter 1). Plus the second Dark Tower novel, The Drawing of the Three (Chapter 10), the fantasy The Eyes of the Dragon (Chapter 18) (which is connected in ways to the Dark Tower series), and the science fiction novel, The Tommyknockers (Chapter 72). Of this group, It was the most important book, but Misery—one of Stephen King’s 10 best novels—was undoubtedly the most terrifying. Paul Sheldon, a world-famous, best-selling author, completes the novel that kills off Misery Chastain, the heroine of his popular Misery series of romances. Sheldon has also written a contemporary novel called Fast Cars that he thinks might win him an American Book Award, and he is thrilled that he is finally free from writing books that made him a fortune, but which he hated writing. While on his way to the airport during a snowstorm, he goes off the road and is rescued by a psychotic nurse named Annie Wilkes who, he soon learns, happens to be his number one fan. Annie takes Paul to her isolated farmhouse where she nurses him back to health. Sheldon soon realizes that he is most assuredly not a guest, but instead a crippled captive. All hell breaks loose when Annie buys Paul’s “Misery dies” novel and learns that her favorite character is no more. Annie then forces Paul to write a novel in which he resurrects Misery Chastain and the tortured writer obliges—because his very life is the penalty if he does not satisfy his Number One Fan. King deftly inserts Paul’s actual Misery novel in typescript in Misery, and the overall effect is one of King’s most frightening and well-written novels. If there is such a thing as a contemporary suspense classic, Misery is it.\n\n1 C. V. 1\n\nNumber 7: Misery (1987)\n\n39\n\nThe King Speaks Q: SK:\n\nQ: SK: Q: SK:\n\nQ: SK:\n\nQ: SK:\n\nHave you had any bad experiences with a “Number One Fan” yourself? I haven’t directly, but my wife has. There was a guy who broke into our house when she was home alone. It was about six o’clock in the morning, and she had just got up when she heard glass breaking downstairs. And she went down to investigate? Yes. What did he look like? He looked like Charles Manson with long hair, and he had a rucksack in his hands. He said that he was my biggest fan. Then he stopped suddenly and said he actually hated me because I’d stolen the novel Misery from his aunt. Then he held up the rucksack and said that he had a bomb and was going to blow her up. Jesus! What did your wife do? She ran out in her bare feet and nightgown, man! The police came round and he was still there. It turned out that all he had in the bag was a load of pencils and paperclips in a box. What was up with him, then? It turned out he was from Texas. His aunt was a nurse who’d been fired from some hospital, and he made a connection with the nurse in Misery. —From a 1998 interview with journalist Ben Rawortit\n\nMain Characters Paul Sheldon, Annie Wilkes, Constant Reader, Misery Chastain, Charlie Merrill, assorted townsfolk and law enforcement personnel.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nStephen King originally planned on publishing Misery as a “Richard Bachman” novel. He apparently felt it fit more neatly into old Dickey’s body of work than into his own.\n\n40\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nStephanie Leonard Speaks (In an interview in my Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia, I asked Stephanie, “What does the dedication mean?”) Her response: “For some reason, maybe the way it was phrased, people assume there’s a secret there, or an in-joke. What this means—“Boy, do they [know]”—is just that we’ve been party to his life for a long time and we’ve seen the fan mail and the people who hang around in front of his house snapping pictures, and the way the fame and the money has affected his life. Basically, we know all the little things that inspired Misery.” —From The Complete Stephen King Encyclopedia\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It The total immersion into Paul Sheldon’s psyche; Annie’s murderous backstory (revealed slowly); and the jaw-dropping climax (which is then amplified by Paul’s experience of seeing Annie’s ghost...or does he?)\n\nFilm Adaptations Misery (1990), starring James Caan, Kathy Bates; directed by Rob Reiner; screenplay by William Goldman. Best Actress Academy Award to Kathy Bates. (This is one of the all-time best adaptations of a King novel to date. Bates won an Academy Award for her portrayal of psychonurse (and Constant Reader) Annie Wilkes.) (Grade: A.)\n\nNUMBER\n\n8 ’Salem’s Lot (1975)\n\nThe house itself looked toward town. It was huge and rambling and sagging, its windows haphazardly boarded shut, giving it that sinister look of all old houses that have been empty for a long time.\n\nWhy it made the top 10: The history of popular culture is replete with second-time failures: writers, actors, directors, musicians, etc., who have an enormous hit with their first effort, and then completely bomb with their sophomore project. Knowing this, then, the brilliance and success of Stephen King’s second published book, ‘Salem’s Lot, is all the more impressive. Granted, part of the reason for ‘Salem’s Lot assured style and exemplary writing is that, even though it was Stephen King’s second book, it wasn’t really Stephen King’s second book. It was his sixth. Carrie may have been King’s first published novel; but he had written four complete novels prior to its publication, followed by book six, ‘Salem’s Lot. There is no better experience than doing it, and by the time King published ‘Salem’s Lot, he had paid his dues and passed the audition. ‘Salem’s Lot is one scary volcano of a book. Ben Mears returns to Jerusalem’s Lot to write a book and discovers that “the town”—as the back jacket of the paperback tells us—“knew darkness.” The novel is flawless in its depiction of small-town life in Maine,\n\n1 41 1\n\n42\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “The dinner conversation that night was a speculation on what might happen if Dracula returned today, not to London with its ‘teeming millions’ (as Stoker puts it with such purely Victorian complacency), but to rural America....I began to turn the idea over in my mind, and it began to coalesce into a possible novel. I thought it would make a good one, if I could create a fictional town with enough prosaic reality about it to offset the comic-book menace of a bunch of vampires.” —From “On Becoming a Brand Name”\n\nwith its isolation and guardedness, an atmosphere, King deftly illustrates, that could allow evil to take root and grow. This is a symbolic object lesson, of course (pedophiles, rapists, domestic abusers and other lowlifes thrive in a climate of secrecy), but King uses it as a tool to show how a card-carrying, bloodsucking, coffin-sleeping member of the undead could also set up shop and use such a place as his own Hometown Buffet. ‘Salem’s Lot is also noteworthy for being the first Stephen King novel with a writer as its protagonist. As Constant Readers know, writer characters are abundant in King’s body of work, but ‘Salem’s Lot’s Ben Mears deserves special recognition as King’s first. ‘Salem’s Lot is one of King’s most accessible novels, is easily teachable, and, when read in conjunction with Bram Stoker’s Dracula, could actually make high school Contemporary American Literature classes a pleasure to attend!\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Ben Mears, Mark Petrie, Kurt Barlow, Susan Norton, Danny Glick, Richard Throckett Straker.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nKing once gave serious though to writing a sequel to ‘Salem’s Lot. In a 1982 interview with Fangoria magazine, King actually revealed how such a sequel would begin: “I think about a sequel a lot. I even know who would be in it and how it would launch...it’s\n\nNumber 8: ’Salem’s Lot (1975)\n\n43\n\nGeorge Beahm Speaks “’Salem’s Lot stands today as one of the finest treatments of the traditional vampire since Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) and one of the last serious treatments of the mythos surrounding the vampire that had developed over the course of the preceding century.” —From George Beahm’s The Stephen King Companion (revised edition)\n\nFather Callahan. I know where he is....He went to New York City and from New York he drifted across the country and he landed in Detroit. He’s in the inner city and he’s running a soup kitchen for alcoholics...and he’s been attacked a couple of times and...people think he’s crazy. He doesn’t wear the turned-around collar anymore, but he’s...trying to get right with God. So one day this guy comes in. He’s dying and he says, ‘I have to talk to you, Father Callahan.’ And Callahan says, ‘I’m not a Father anymore and how did you know that?’ [As the guy dies], the last thing he says as he grabs Callahan by the shirt and pulls him down into this mist of beer and whiskey and puke...is, ‘It’s not over in the Lot, yet.’ Then he drops dead.”\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It As one of King’s most viscerally frightening works, ‘Salem’s Lot is perhaps even more engrossing when reread.\n\nFilm Adaptations Salem’s Lot (TV-miniseries, 1979); starring David Soul, James Mason, Lance Kerwin, Bonnie Bedelia, Lew Ayres, Julie Cobb, Elisha Cook Jr., George Dzundza, Ed Flanders, Clarissa Kaye-Mason, Geoffrey Lewis, Barney McFadden, Kenneth McMillan, Fred Willard, Marie Windsor; directed by Tobe Hooper; screenplay by Paul Monash.

A man grows what he can...and he tends it.”\n\nWhy it made the top 10: The death of a child. To a parent, it is the ultimate horror. I have heard countless parents say—immediately and with absolutely no qualms—that if they were faced with the choice of their child dying or themselves dying, they would selflessly sacrifice themselves to save the life of their child. But what happens if the parent is not given that choice, and the child is simply taken from them, by illness or accident? If that was the case, and the parent had a way of reversing tragedy; of bringing their child back...what would mom or dad do? And what would be the consequences? This horror is the subject of Pet Sematary. Even the bare bones plot of Pet Sematary, spoken plainly, has not-so-subtle intimations of dread: A grieving father buries his son in a graveyard that can resurrect the dead...except that when the dead come back, they’re changed.\n\n1 44 1\n\nNumber 9: Pet Sematary (1983)\n\n45\n\nLouis Creed and his wife Rachel (the Biblical names are not accidental) have two children, Ellie and Gage. Ellie’s cat Church (again, the religious reference is significant) is killed by a truck on the road in front of their home. (This incident was based on the similar death of King’s daughter Naomi’s cat, Smucky.) The death of Church is so traumatizing to Ellie that her father decides to use the secret information given him by his neighbor, Jud Crandall. There is a Micmac burial ground off in the woods where anything that’s buried comes back to life. But this power comes with a price: The resurrected are not the way they were in life. Louis Creed is willing to do anything to ease Ellie’s pain, and so he buries Church there, and the cat does, indeed, come back. Except that he’s a mean, vicious hellcat instead of the lovable kitty Ellie had cherished. Does this teach Louis a lesson? Of course not. And when his son Gage is killed on the same road, he buries his boy in the same ground and he too comes back. A demonic childmonster, he first kills Jud, and then his mother. By this time Louis is completely insane and, yes, also buries his dead wife in the unholy place. The novel concludes with Rachel coming back to visit her hubby...who is, by now, as doomed as doomed can be. Pet Sematary is one of King’s powerful works and is unquestionably one of his finest literary achievements.\n\n1 C. V. 1 Main Characters Louis Creed, Jud Crandall, Rachel Creed, Victor Pascow, Irwin Goldman, Gage Creed, Ellie Creed, Missy Dandridge, Marcy Charlton, Steve Masterton, Dory Goldman, Zelda Goldman, Church.\n\n?\n\nDid You Know?\n\nPet Sematary is the novel Stephen King felt was too horrific to publish. In fact, when he finished it in 1979, he put it in a drawer and refused to offer it for publication. As fulfillment of a contract with Doubleday, though, King eventually relented and allowed publication in 1983, but he refused to participate in the promotion of the book. (The jacket flap copy of the Doubleday hardcover edition of Pet Sematary began, “Can Stephen King scare even himself? Has the author of Carrie, The Shining, Cujo, and Christine ever conceived a story so horrifying that he was for a time unwilling to finish writing it? Yes. This is it.”)\n\n46\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe King Speaks “When ideas come, they don’t arrive with trumpets. They are quiet— there is no drama involved. I can remember crossing the road, and thinking that the cat had been killed in the road...and [I thought], what if a kid died in that road? And we had had this experience with Owen running toward the road, where I had just grabbed him and pulled him back. And the two things just came together—on one side of this two-lane highway was the idea of what if the cat came back, and on the other side of the highway was what if the kid came back—so that when I reached the other side, I had been galvanized by the idea, but not in any melodramatic way. I knew immediately that it was a novel.” —From an interview with Douglas E. Winter, from Stephen King: The Art of Darkness\n\nWhat I Really Liked About It I suppose it is kind of twisted to admit actually “liking” anything about a book so dark, so pessimistic, so sad...but I still think Pet Sematary—King’s aversion to it even to this day notwithstanding—is a masterful horror story. It is superbly written, and, yes, I “enjoyed” reading it. The novel looks death—and our ways of dealing with it—straight in the face. I personally try not to look away while I’m reading it.\n\nFilm Adaptations Pet Sematary (1989); starring Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne, Denise Crosby, Brad Greenquist, Michael Lombard, Miko Hughes, Blaze Berdahl, Susan Blommaert, Mara Clark, Kavi Raz, Mary Louise Wilson, Andrew Hubatsek, Liz Davies, Kara Dalke, Matthew August Ferrell; directed by Mary Lambert; screenplay by Stephen King.

That right?\n\nWhy it made the top 10: Before we begin, I’d like to make a statement which I think speaks volumes (pun intended) about Stephen King, and it is this: For countless other writers past and present, The Dark Tower epic alone would be a life’s work. I thought long and hard about how to rank King’s Dark Tower stories in The Essential Stephen King. I even consulted a number of King authorities (many of whose names you would immediately recognize) for opinions on whether the individual novels should be ranked as separate books/stories, or as part of an overall, inclusive ranking that considered The Dark Tower epic a single work. The cohorts and colleagues I palavered with had varying opinions on what I should do. Many believed The Dark Tower books should be ranked and reviewed individually.\n\n1 47 1\n\n48\n\nThe Essential Stephen King 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 1\n\n1\n\nA screenwriter who has adapted King told me, “I think each book is too distinctive and unique to be lumped together as one collection...especially since that ‘collection’ is not yet complete. I know this means more work for you, but, hey, you wanted my opinion!” A well-known writer who has written several books about King advised, “If these were all fairly short books, such as The Gunslinger, I’d say rank them as a single work. But since the later volumes have been huge, and since each stands alone as a unit, and (partially due to their having been issued at such widely-spaced intervals) also reflect different stages of King’s career, I think they would more properly be considered as individual works, particularly the last three. I’d go with individuality.” An indefatigable King bibliographer and friend of mine told me, “Definitely rank them all separately. I believe that they all have a distinctive feel, especially The Gunslinger....The Gunslinger has a dark feel to it, The Drawing of the Three has a weird ‘80s America’ feel to it, The Waste Lands has a dark fantasy feel, and Wizard and Glass has a kind of western/romance/ fantasy feel. My point is, they should be ranked separately, because they all have their own distinct sensibility.” But then there were those who made strong arguments not to treat the books as separate entities. A well-known King dealer wrote, “They are individual novels...which is why you ask the question...but I believe they shouldn’t be split up. They are part of ‘one picture’ and in one vein. I say keep them together.” A well-respected King supercollector wrote, “I believe you should treat it the same way you would treat Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy and for much the same reasons. I vote for one series. I am sure you are treating The Green Mile as one story. The Dark Tower is one story told in many large parts over a long time frame but it is one long story.” A writer and acknowledged King expert wrote, “Are you treating The Green Mile as six books or one? I think you should follow your lead by how you treat The Green Mile. If someone was discussing Tolkien, I don’t think that anyone would rank the three component releases of The Lord of the Rings trilogy separately. Or would they? I wouldn’t at least. So, bottom line, my decision is to treat The Dark Tower as a single entity, which, ironically, is still quite incomplete as of this writing. However, I wish there was a way to treat The Gunslinger separate from the others because it’s my favorite of the four!”\n\nI decided to go with a single ranking for the complete Dark Tower epic. I do acknowledge the individuality of each book, however, by looking at each one separately, in chronological order, but without ranking them within the context of The Dark Tower epic. Like Tolkien’s oft-compared-to Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Dark Tower is one story. You may like The Fellowship of the Ring better than the The Two Towers (or vice versa, etc.), but they are each still part of one big tale. That rule also\n\nNumber 10: The Dark Tower Epic (1982, 1987, 1997, 2002[?])\n\n49\n\napplies to The Dark Tower, and, truth be told, King’s completed Dark Tower series will probably become as important and beloved as Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. It would not surprise me if, like The Lord of the Rings, King’s series survives in boxed sets, single-volume editions, commemorative editions, etc. And don’t dismiss the possibility of a one-volume edition of this enormous series. Think of those gigantic, oversized Complete Works of William Shakespeare editions. That format is what I think could be used quite effectively for The Dark Tower series. King has projected the complete series at seven or eight volumes. The most recent (as of this writing) installment, Wizard and Glass, runs approximately 300,000 words. Extrapolating from this (and this is, of course, pure speculation) we’re talking about a complete series in excess of 2 million words, but easily fit into a single (albeit huge) volume. (And you thought the gorgeous boxed edition of the Uncut Stand was the ultimate King edition!) The Dark Tower epic is a multi-layered, multi-timeline, multi-character, multi-genre saga that, for all its complexity, is really about only one person, Roland Deschain of Gilead and his sacred quest to find the Dark Tower. Since it would be impossible to adequately summarize the complex narrative events of the four books currently comprising The Dark Tower series in the very limited space available here, I will be succinct when talking about each volume and not attempt a “Cliff’s Notes for The Dark Tower Series.” No such summation could do justice to the brilliance of King’s vision. (It would be like asking someone to briefly summarize The Lord of the Rings. “Well, there was this Hobbit...”) (Note: I do not include The Dark Tower story “The Little Sisters of Eluria” in this overall “Dark Tower Epic” chapter. I ranked and reviewed it separately. As we Constant Readers know, The Dark Tower mythos is intertwined in many of Stephen King’s works. I decided that only books released specifically as part of The Dark Tower series belonged in this chapter. Thus, “Little Sisters,” Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, and even “Paranoid: A Chant,” all of which are part of Roland’s story, were not included under the “Epic” umbrella.)\n\nThe Dark Tower: The Gunslinger (1982) This is a collection of five independently published short stories, all of which are episodic, somewhat prefatory contributions to The Dark Tower mythos. These stories are now perceived as five long chapters of the first Dark Tower novel. They are: 1. “The Gunslinger” 2. “The Way Station” 3. “The Oracle and the Mountains” 4. “The Slow Mutants” 5. “The Gunslinger and the Dark Man” The Gunslinger referred to, or introduced us to, several key characters in the epic, including Roland of Gilead, Jake Chambers, Walter the Man in Black, Susan, Maerlyn/\n\n50\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nMarten/Flagg, Sylvia Pittston, Roland’s mother Gabrielle, Roland’s father Steven (also at times referred to as Roland), Cort, and Cuthbert. “The Gunslinger” begins with a line that fits Stephen King’s own description of an opener that works: it’s a great hooker. (See King’s nonfiction essay “Great Hookers I Have Known” in his collection Secret Windows for more on what makes a killer opening sentence.) “The Gunslinger” begins, “The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.” The man in black is Walter; the gunslinger is Roland of Gilead. We soon learn that Roland is on a quest to find the Dark Tower, the nexus of all existence, and he knows that Walter will play a key role in his journey. At this point in the story, Roland is not sure why the Tower calls him, but find it, he must. It is his ka, his fate. During his journey, Roland arrives at Tull, where Walter had previously visited and resurrected a dead man. Walter has planted a trap for Roland, putting into the minds of the townsfolk the suggestion that the gunslinger that would soon visit was a demon, an antichrist, and when Roland is subsequently attacked, he slaughters everyone in town— 58 men, women, and children—before moving on. At a way station in the desert, Roland meets Jake Chambers, a young boy from 20th century New York, who, he will soon learn, is also a key player in Roland’s quest for the Tower. Jake and Roland continue pursuing the Man in Black, at one point confronting hideous creatures known as Slow Mutants. Jake is ultimately sacrificed for Roland’s quest for the Tower (embracing his own death, Jake tells Roland, “Go then. There are other worlds than these.”) and the gunslinger meets up with the Man in Black on a beach where Roland’s fortune is told and the set up for Book II, The Drawing of the Three is established.\n\nMain Characters Roland of Gilead, Jake Chambers, Walter the Man in Black, Susan, Maerlyn/Marten/ Flagg, Sylvia Pittston, Roland’s mother Gabrielle, Roland’s father Steven (also at times referred to as Roland the Elder), Cort, Cuthbert.\n\nThe Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three (1987) The Drawing of the Three may have been one of the most eagerly awaited Stephen King novels of his prolific career. Fans were excited: King’s legendary Dark Tower series would continue, and with a full-blown novel, not just a series of connected short stories. The Drawing of the Three begins where The Gunslinger left off, on the beach with Roland, who is now 10 years older. Roland is continuing his quest for the Tower (the nexus of all creation), and while walking north on a beach, he is attacked and injured by a lobstrosity. A giant lobster who bites off two of his fingers and a toe, including his right index finger, his trigger finger, and infects him with a strange poison.\n\nNumber 10: The Dark Tower Epic (1982, 1987, 1997, 2002[?])\n\n51\n\nFurther up the beach Roland comes upon three freestanding doors labeled The Prisoner, The Lady of Shadows, and The Pusher. These doors open onto other worlds and deliver Eddie Dean, Odetta Holmes, and Detta Walker to Roland—the drawing of the foretold three. Ultimately Detta and Odetta merge into a single personality—Susannah Dean. This installment concludes with Roland affirming to the others his pledge to find the Dark Tower—no matter what it takes.\n\nMain Characters Roland, Eddie Dean, Odetta Holmes, Detta Walker, Susannah Dean, Jake Chambers, The Man in Black, Jack Mort, Flagg.\n\nThe Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands (1991) The Waste Lands (the title is a reference to T. S. Eliot’s seminal poem “The Waste Land”) is a complex and layered novel. In it, King deftly utilizes multiple time frames, multiple narrative viewpoints, false histories, premonitions, and also introduces exotic new characters like Gasher, Oy the Billy-Bumbler, the Tick-Tock Man, and Blaine the sentient and insane train that promises to kill the Three unless they can solve his riddles. The intricately plotted story sets up threads that will be expanded on in future volumes (including the appearance of the Turtle), and also offers some of King’s most intense scenes of the series. Scenes such as Eddie and Susannah’s walk down the Street of the Turtle in the city of Lud, following the Path of the Beam. In this scene, there are countless corpses hanging from speaker poles—most of them mummies, but some still in the putrefying stages of decay. Ugh. Another interesting element of the story is the fact that in Lud the two warring factions are the Pubes and the Grays. Is it significant that the infectious, marauding aliens in Dreamcatcher are called “Grayboys” and that the alien that possesses Jonesy is identified as “Mr. Gray”? And how does this all connect to The Turtle and the Dark Tower itself? Obviously, there are many connections between The Dark Tower story and the stories told in other King works and there may be a great deal yet to be learned about the origins of many of the beings and peoples in the series. The Waste Lands is yet another chapter—another step forward—in what is clearly one of King’s most important (and transcendent) works.\n\nMain Characters Roland, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Oy, Little Blaine, Richard Fannin, Tick-Tock Man, Shardik, The Guardians, Cuthbert, Alain, The Pubes, The Grays.\n\n52\n\nThe Essential Stephen King\n\nThe Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass (1997) This installment—the fourth of The Dark Tower epic—tells of Roland’s desperate proposal to the insane Blaine the Mono of a bargain and its consequences. Following their escape from Blaine, Roland’s ka-tet—Roland, Susannah, Eddie, Jake, Oy—lose their way and must recover the path to the Dark Tower. King also reveals to his readers something he had not yet written about until this volume: Roland’s past and his tragic, absolutely Shakespearean act that explains a great deal about Roland’s state of mind throughout his quest. (Some other reviews have revealed this critical event involving Roland’s mother, but I think it best for the reader to come upon it in his or her own good time. If you’ve read Wizard and Glass, then you know; if you haven’t read it yet, then “no spoilers here.”) The one and only Randall Flagg makes an appearance in this chapter of the epic and his presence further establishes the connections not only among the different worlds that coexist as Roland travels the Path of the Beam, but also of the myriad connections between many of King’s works. A newspaper article that the group sees shortly after fleeing Blaine makes even more concrete and blatant a specific connection with another King epic. We also learn of Roland’s relationship as a younger man with his one true love, Susan Delgado. King takes great pains to tell their story, to emphasize Roland’s love for Susan, and, following yet another horrific tragedy, lead the reader to even more conclusions regarding Roland’s psyche. King deftly uses Wizard of Oz elements and references (many from the movie version) to establish a metaphorical subtext in this volume. Also, it is learned that Susannah is pregnant with the child of either Eddie or a demon that raped her. Will her baby be human or demon? Stay tuned. We also learn what Thinnies are (which explains a lot) and we are introduced to the character of Sheemie who could be considered a foreshadowing of the character with Down’s syndrome, Duddits, in King’s 2001 novel Dreamcatcher. ‘Salem’s Lot rears its head here. It seems as though The Stand (Captain Trips is mentioned), The Eyes of The Dragon, Insomnia (The Crimson King is referred to), J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, and The Wizard of Oz all seem to be a part of the increasingly epic and engrossing Dark Tower epic. King uses the phrase “essential weirdness” to describe the writing of The Dark Tower series and also admits that Roland’s story is his “Jupiter”—his biggest story in a universe of imagination. Volume 5 and the Dark Tower are now closer.\n\nMain Characters Roland Deschain, Eddie Dean, Susannah Dean, Jake Chambers, Oy, Blaine, Little Blaine, Steven Deschain, Susan Delgado, Cuthbert Allgood, Alain Johns, Rhea of the Coos, Eldred Jonas, Sheemie, John Farson, Walter.\n\nNumber 10: The Dark Tower Epic (1982, 1987, 1997, 2002[?])\n\n53\n\nThe Dark Tower V: The Crawling Shadow (2002[?]) King has revealed that the working title for this fifth Dark Tower installment is, in fact, The Crawling Shadow, but he also said (during a September 19, 2000 AOL chat) that the title will “probably change, as that’s sort of corny.” (Personally, I kind of like it...it has kind of a “Sauron” feel to it, don’t you think?) There was talk that this installment (still unpublished (and unstarted?) as of spring 2001) was originally to be called The Dark Tower V: Thunderclap, referring to the dark place where, King tells us, Father Callah"
