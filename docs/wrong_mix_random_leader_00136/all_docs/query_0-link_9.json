        "text": "Fair warning, this will be like most of my vacation race reports which means it’s part travel guide, part race report, part journal. If you only care about the race go ahead and scroll down.\n\nThis was my second time running the spartathlon. In case you haven’t heard of it, it’s a 153 mile race in Greece run at the end of September recreating the historical run of Pheidippides from Athens to Sparta to ask for help in battling the Persians at Marathon. It happened over 2500 years ago and we follow what historians think is the route he took. Of course the ancient roads he was on are now paved for the most part. I go into the history of the run and the race much more in my last race report from 2021 here. I know it sounds kinda douchy to say it’s not the 153mile distance that’s hard (especially with a mountain pass to climb at 100 miles into the race) but it’s not. The unrelenting time cut offs and heat are the issue. You have 36 hours for the whole race but the first 50 miles you only have 9.5 hours. In fact, the tightest cutoff is at around 40 miles. It’s the reason you have to qualify with a fast time to even apply for the race. Since they made the qualifying times faster about 6 years ago, about 60% of people finish now instead of 50%.\n\nI think the word epic is used way too often, but for this race it’s use would be appropriate in my opinion. First off, it’s in Greece! I love it there. It’s spendy to get there but once you’re there, it’s cheap. It’s beautiful both on and off the course. Second, you are running in the footsteps of a man who 2500 years ago not only ran for his country’s safety but I’d like to think his family as well. Perhaps he had small children at home. This is of course all made up in my head but I like to bring history to life and put myself in his situation. Thirdly and part of the reason I ran it again, there is an Olympic spirit at this race that I don’t think exists anywhere else. We run as individuals but are very much a part of our countries team. It’s almost family-like and very similar to the winter racing ultrarunning scene. Everyone there wants everyone else to finish and will help each other out to accomplish that. I’m talking more that just the usual “ultrarunner code” you see at every race. This is full on going out of your way to help others out both before the race and during. There were 49 countries there this year so you get to meet people from all over.\n\nThis was the first year the race was started on a Saturday. The reason I heard was that Athens was tired of closing the road Friday morning for the race and demanded it be moved to Saturday. That seems like it’s probably true but I don’t know that for sure.\n\nThe other big change for me this year was that my wife didn’t come to crew me and I’d be on my own. With the kids in school and all their activities, it’s too hard to take them with. It was also very hard for her to crew by herself last time. In fact, even though it was difficult to do all the kid stuff by herself (I’m not allowed to die and leave her with them), she said it was still much easier than crewing at Spartathlon. I have a feeling it would’ve been much easier this time around for her though. Looking at the crews that have been there year after year, they are so relaxed and on top of things. At least they look that way to me as a runner, perhaps they’re panicking inside.\n\nI was hoping I’d be able to get some “crewing” from other people’s crew teams since everyone helps out so much but you can’t count on it because you never know how fast other people will be. I planned to use my drop bags for everything and if some race emergency happened, I hoped I could get help from someone’s crew.\n\nSo since I wasn’t going there to vacation like we did last time, I left on Sunday and arrived Monday morning of race week. It’s an 8 hour time difference for me which is big and it takes about 5 days to really get used to the difference. There’s no time to sleep during the race and even if there was, the honking cars wouldn’t let you sleep anyway. Because of that, you need to be well rested to stay up for the 36 hours of running and the few hours pre-race as well. I stopped taking caffeine for this race more than last time since I had such an issue with being tired the first evening last time.\n\nI once again brought a checked bag filled with food and race stuff. I could barely fit everything I needed. I was lucky I had done this race before and kept my packing lists from last time. Things were very hectic the month before the race at home with contractors finally doing work that was supposed to be done months before so I had no time to do any planning for the race this year. I even had to take a day off of work so I could pack I was so behind. 2 days before the race I realized I had forgotten to get an international drivers permit! Luckily my teammates knew that they just changed the law in Greece and my American driver’s license would be good enough for the cops. I called the car rental place in Greece to confirm they were OK with that, and they were as well. Last time we were there, the people next to us got denied a car because they didn’t have one so you can see why I was worried.\n\nThe flights there were pretty good and I arrived early Monday morning. I got my car without incident and got ready to drive by myself with a pretty crappy car that sounded like it would die at any moment. I drove towards Delphi were I had a place booked on Airbnb for a couple nights. I had slept on the plane some so I was nice and awake. We had never gone North of Athens last time. It’s much prettier to the North I think. I drove through farmland where cotton was being harvested. There were trucks hauling it everywhere and the ditches had a fair amount of cotton that had blown off the trucks in them.\n\nThere were solar and wind farms in this area as well. I had always wondered why I didn’t see any solar or wind turbines last time I was Greece. I’m not sure if they’re new or I just didn’t visit the correct area. The ditches had way less garbage than anywhere I’ve seen in Greece before as well. I assume farmers don’t want all that crap blowing in their fields and so something actually gets done about all the littering in that area.\n\nI like driving in Greece. No one really follows the lanes so you have to watch out but at the same time it’s super easy to pass people. The slow people just drive on the shoulder and you can pass even in a no passing zone. It’s pretty common that you will be in the exact middle of the road passing someone (that is halfway on the shoulder) and a car is coming from the other direction but they move over as well so you can finish passing. I still never tried it on the winding mountain roads though. I’m not as brave as the locals in that regard.\n\nI stopped and pulled off the road once to pee and look at the cotton field (I’m a farm kid). I thought about just leaving the car run, but I turned it off. I got back in once I was finished and the car wouldn’t start. Crap! It wouldn’t even turn over. I thought it through about how the car was at the airport when I started it the first time and remembered the parking brake was on. I pulled the hand brake and then it started. It seemed weird since it was an automatic and not a manual transmission but at least I figured it out.\n\nDelphi is in a mountain area. Not Rocky Mountain type mountains but still pretty steep and they are a few thousand feet above the surrounding area. Just before Delphi there is the Temple of Athena which is free to look at. There isn’t much parking so I parked down by the Castalia Spring which is just down the road. The spring is still running although much less than in ancient times. They used to cleanse themselves in a pool below the spring before going to the oracle or Temple of Apollo nearby. There is a empty pool visible now but I’m not sure how old it is. There is a fountain nearby that is always flowing and is drinkable. You can see an area of water flowing in a rock formed aqueduct as well. I filled up my water bottle since it was getting pretty hot and walked to the Temple of Athena.\n\nThere isn’t much for descriptions of what you’re looking at. It was the same all throughout Greece last time I was there and nothing has changed. The signs usually just describe what the buildings looked like and give little to no descriptions of their use or stories about them. All around this area and also the Temple of Apollo area there were huge irrigation jets for fire suppression. There really isn’t much of anything that could burn but I guess it makes sense to protect something so old and special.\n\nI finished looking around and decided to check into the Airbnb which was an old pension. I didn’t know what that was but basically it’s what some would probably call a boarding house. A small family run hotel where they live in the same building. The rooms were like any other hotel room in Greece. It had a great view of the valley below and I could see all the way to the Gulf of Corinth from my balcony. All this for $50 a night.\n\nSince there is a 8 hour time difference, I did a video chat with the family since they would be up and getting ready for school. It was short but sweet.\n\nI changed into my spartathlon shirt from 2021 since it was getting so hot and walked over to the Delphi Archeological Museum which also gets you into the ruins area where the Temple of Apollo and Oracle would’ve been. I thought it would be warm but huge clouds started to roll in and it was pretty cool and windy.\n\nThe Museum itself was OK and the archeological area was pretty awesome. I had learned a fair amount before I went there so it was cool to now see these ruins in person. It would’ve been quite the sight to see when all the spires and buildings were still up. Reviews always complained about it being so steep and all the climbing but it didn’t bother me at all. Everything is very close together so you don’t walk that much at all. I went up to the stadium at the top knowing that they don’t allow you to run it anymore. I have no idea why they don’t let you in the stadium anymore. Somewhere I read it was due to rockfall risk but that’s a load of crap. The entire town is in a rockfall risk area. They have guards up there watching the entire area as well.\n\nI really wanted to run on it since I ran at the stadium at the Archaeological Site of Olympia where the Olympic Games were first held. The stadium at Delphi was where the Pythian Games were held. You may not know this but the reason the Olympics were held every 4 years is because there were 4 locations where games were held in ancient Greece. So the Olympic games were one year and the Pythian games were the next year, etc. The other locations are Nemea (which we run past during the race) and Isthmia. I was hoping to run all 4 stadiums but since I couldn’t run at Delphi, I didn’t even try to go to Nemea. The stadium at Isthmia isn’t really there anymore so it’s impossible to run that one as well. Isthmia is right by the Corinth canal but the race course doesn’t go by it so I haven’t seen it in person. The stadium at Delphi is slightly shorter than the Olympic stadium as well but they all are very close to 200 meters long.\n\nIt was starting to thunder in the distance now so I figured I best be going. I played with the cute stray dogs as I walked home. The other thing that happened on the way back to the hotel was a French guy stopped his car in the road and started to talk to me since I had my spartathlon shirt on. He was also going to the spartathlon although I’m pretty sure I found out he was crewing someone this year.\n\nOnce I got back to the hotel room it started to rain and storm all night. Luckily I had brought my raincoat with. I also had an umbrella packed but didn’t remember that. I didn’t open the one suitcase since it was just food and race stuff but it was in there. Oh well. I did find a letter from my daughter in the other suitcase that she had hidden before I left. It was very encouraging. While my kids are never that impressed with what I do, they are at the same time positive I can do them. I took a nap and waited for the restaurants to open.\n\nI of course had to have moussaka on my first night in Greece. All the restaurants in Delphi serve it so it was easy to find and I also got saganaki as well. I can’t believe I didn’t have that last time I was there. It wasn’t as good as I was expecting though. Give me warm out of the vat cheese curds over it any day. It’s not bad by any means but not amazing.\n\nI had hoped to run in the heat of the day to maintain the heat training I had been doing at home but the rain ruined those plans. It looked like it was supposed to rain everyday up until the race according to the forecast. I really didn’t want to lose all the heat tolerance I had built up since it can get really hot during the race. I should’ve tried to find a place with a tub so I could take a hot bath but I’m not sure there are any hotels with tubs in Greece. I’ve never seen one but maybe in an expensive place they’d have one. Usually you’re lucky to even get an actual shower and not just a small area with a hand held sprayer with or without a shower curtain.\n\nThe forecast for the next day was rain, rain and more rain. I tried to sleep in as much as possible but was still on the road by 9am I think. I drove to Thermopylae to have a look at that area. When I was at Spartathlon 2 years ago they were celebrating the 2500th anniversary of the battle there. The drive there was beautiful but also very twisty going over a couple mountain passes.\n\nWhen you look online it seems like there’s not much to see at the site but there was quite a bit I thought. There is a museum that has a 3D movie that did a good job of explaining the multi-day battle against the Persians there. They also had a bunch of interactive display monitors to go through the history in more detail. Lots of information on the sea battles as well. Worth the 4 euros I thought.\n\nI tried to time my exploration of the actual battle area to the breaks in the rain. First off, don’t expect the cliffs along the sea to be there. There are 2 rivers that flow into the sea there and after a couple millennia they have filled in the area completely with deltas. The cliffs used to be around 50 feet above the water and you can still kinda tell how it would’ve looked but the seashore itself is now a couple miles away. They have dikes built up around the rivers to prevent flooding now and farm the deltas. I crossed both rivers while driving and they were really brown so there’s definitely still a lot of silt going into the sea.\n\nAnyway, it was nice to hear and see the actual history and not the 300 movie version. It’s not completely different but different enough as you might expect. I didn’t even know about the hill that the last remaining Spartans went on top of during the end of the last battle. They made their last stand there completely surrounded. There is a plaque there that you’ve probably heard of, I just never knew it was on a hill. It’s not a huge hill but it’s still there and when you are on top you can see much better the outline of where the cliffs and shoreline used to be.\n\nI did a little shopping in a bigger town nearby and then drove back. I decided to go through this small town called Eleonas on a hillside that looked really pretty from the highway. I would strongly suggest not driving completely through this town. In a country where all the village roads are narrow, this one was crazy narrow. I had about as small of a car as they make and I had barely inches on either side of my car as I went down very very steep hills and hairpin turns. It was way too steep to even think about backing up a hill, no way the car could do it. I’m not even sure how I got out of there without getting stuck.\n\nIt was getting to be late afternoon by the time I got back to Delphi and the sun had just come out so now was my chance to finally run and try to maintain my heat training. If you are the sort of person that wonders how many miles of roads there are in Delphi, then you would’ve loved running with me because I ran all of them to find out. It’s just under 4 miles. There’s a fair amount of elevation and lots of stray dogs to play with along the way. You can even see parts of the archeological area from the higher parts of town that border it. There is a trail that goes up to the top of the mountain above town and I was really tempted to do it but there were big clouds coming again. Probably not the best idea to go hiking up mountains right before the race as well.\n\nI once again had some amazing food that night. It was a whole pork tibia/fibula that must’ve been cooked for hours. Awesome! I finished shopping for gifts as I didn’t want to have to do that later.\n\nThe next day I packed up and drove to ancient Corinth to see the sights there. Surprisingly I didn’t hit any traffic having to go past Athens to get there. I didn’t have time to dig into the Corinth Canal history this visit either but I’m always impressed by it every time I cross it. I did learn that before the canal was dug, the Corinthians had a road that was there and they transported goods and small vessels over the land on it from one body of water to the other. They of course charged for this.\n\nI resisted the temptation to go into the Temple of Apollo store right off the highway even though I could see one of the sculptures I’ve always wanted through the window. Okay, it’s a replica obviously but I don’t even want to know how much it costs. I’ll admit I looked at their website and luckily they have very little listed there. There were over 100 statues I could see in the windows so clearly they don’t update the website much. Most parents want their kids to be doctors, etc. Once mine were born, I secretly hoped one would become a world class sculptor just so I could have some amazing ones for cheap someday.\n\nI went into the archeological site and I have to admit, I was somewhat let down by it. You can honestly see all the cool things from the fence around it. I mean if you’re really into looking at stone foundations, then you’ll be in heaven. I know I know, most of the sites are just foundations but they at least have drawings of what it would look like and you can get a sense of it. Here, everything just looked like a jumbled mess and there was only one drawing of what it looked like at the peak of the city under roman control. I was very impressed by what it looked like then! It would’ve been extremely impressive to anyone visiting at the time. Probably the best part was just thinking about how many important people throughout history had been in the same spot as I was now.\n\nI left the site and walked around the town a little. I had some ice cream from the shop that Jessie ate at last time while she was crewing and looked up the cobblestone road I’d be running down in a few days. Somehow it seems so much more special to be running on that road in a recreation of a historic run than if I was to just go and run it right then. It’s the same road, same shops, same crowds of people, and yet having on the American racing shirt and running it during Spartathlon is surreal.\n\nI noticed there was a tall hill not that far from the site and there was a wall all around on the top of it. Of course I had never noticed it last time as I ran past it since I hadn’t even noticed the Temple of Apollo columns that were much closer. I saw on the brochure that you can go up there so I decided to go there next instead of Nemea.\n\nIt’s called Acrocorinth. I’m sure you usually have to pay to get in as there was a ticket booth but no one was there. I think it was all included in the same ticket I had anyway. There weren’t many parking spots up there but I found one. This place was the fort that protected the city and area around it. At one point it had stone walls that went all the way to the water surrounding the city as well. I’m not sure how much it’s changed over thousands of years but I know it’s changed some as it looked like there were cannon mounts in a couple spots. There is a lot of climbing there but I had to see this place. There is even a spring up there that still has water in it. I really don’t know where it comes from as it’s on top of a hill but there it was and has been for thousands of years. I ended up going along the wall on a trail that probably isn’t a real trail and is only there to maintain the lights along the wall. It was fun to look out at the canal and city below which is the whole reason the fort was there.\n\nI was running out of time as I still needed to check in to my hotel. I kinda still wanted to go to Nemea but knew it would be dark by the time I got to the hotel and I wanted to go swim a little bit and relax before I went into complete race mode tomorrow. Being a tourist is much more fun than being a runner without a crew, I’ll tell you that much.\n\nI stayed at Hotel Cokkinis which is actually an aid station along the course (about 31 miles into the race). It’s on the water in a beautiful spot. I would highly recommend this hotel. Even the restaurant there was good. The beach is rocky like most places but I managed to still enjoy the water and mostly just sat there with the waves crashing over my legs. It was getting somewhat hot and despite climbing up and down the Acrocorinth area, I decided to go run along the course.\n\nIt was a little weird dodging cars even though I’d be doing it during the race all the time in a few days. There was occasionally a road that would turn off going towards the water side so I’d go on those as far as they’d take me. They always ended at what everyone in Greece seemed to think was a great place to dump garbage of course.\n\nThe last one I went down ended at a tunnel that was gated off. The tunnel was big enough to drive a semi-truck into it and was lit up so I wanted to see what the deal was. The gate was locked of course but it also was solid for most of it so the only way to see in would be to lay on the ground or climb up it a foot to peer over the solid part. I chose the later and the second I touched the gate an super loud alarm went off. That was my cue to not stick around and was thankful I never looked into the security camera although I highly doubt it would be hard to know it was me since I doubt many people are there with running outfits on. The alarm didn’t stop, like at all. I could hear it going until I was over half a mile away which was over 10 minutes since I had to climb back up the hill. I never even heard it stop, it just faded away with distance. I was really hoping anyone that was looking for me started in the other direction so I could get back to the hotel and out of sight. In reality I’m sure no one was looking for me.\n\nI ate at the restaurant while watching the sunset. It was a nice day and I really wished Jessie could’ve been there with me. When I talked to her that day I made the mistake I made several times this trip and said “If we go to Greece again, we should stay here.” She would quickly correct me and say “WHEN we go back to Greece you mean.” Yes, we will definitely have to go to Greece again without the race.\n\nThat brings up a thought about Chris that you’ll meet later in the story. He and his wife were originally planning on doing their touring after the race but he said if he didn’t finish the race, he’d be no fun at all so they better tour before the race. I just like touring before the race so I adjust to the time difference but I guess that’s another reason. I will say that many of the people that unfortunately time out early in the race do take advantage of the extra time and tour more sights. When I dropped out in Andorra that’s what I did, but I would definitely not recommend dropping just to see more stuff! I don’t think I was grumpy but if you ask my wife you might hear a different story. I’m sure I probably brought it up every 30 minutes thinking about things I could’ve done different, etc.\n\nRace Stuff, Stop Scrolling\n\nThe next day (Thursday) was packet pick up for the race at the Oasis Hotel which is where it usually is. I drove there before dropping off my car because I figured the hotel the American team was staying at wasn’t ready for us in the morning and it was over a mile away from the Oasis so I wanted to drive my luggage there and not haul it on a tram.\n\nIt was supposed to open at 9:30 AM but with this being Greece I knew that wouldn’t happen. I still got there before then because again traffic wasn’t bad at all. I don’t know how I was so lucky with traffic this year. I talked to other people in line. I found out more from an American running for the French team about the guy in Delphi that stopped me on the street. Small world. I think just after 10AM they opened up and by then I was first in line as the other people in front of me had given up on waiting by that point. That was kinda fun in a way I guess. I noticed someone filming things and found out later he was doing a documentary on Karl Hubert who would go on to finish the race for the 25th time at age 65 this year (and beat me)!\n\nI got my packet of information, bib, etc and then went to the hotel to check in. I wasn’t able to go in to the room which wasn’t surprising and they would store my bags. What was surprising was there were going to be 3 or 4 people in my room and I didn’t know any of them. They weren’t sure if there was going to be a 4th or not. There’s not supposed to be more than 2 people in a room from what I’ve been told by those with much more knowledge of the race than me. I didn’t care about having roommates I didn’t know. I cared that instead of only having 1 chance of being paired with a snorer, I now had at least 2 or 3 chances of having a snorer in my room. I really can’t handle snoring! Since I told them I didn’t know any of them, they were going to have the staff disconnect the beds. Basically they had 2 single beds tied together to make a king since they were under the impression that we all knew each other. I wouldn’t want to sleep in the same bed even if I knew them.\n\nI returned my rental car in downtown Athens and took the tram back to Glyfada which worked out pretty good. It just took a while. I noticed they were finally developing the old airport in Glyfada which hasn’t been used in decades. I’m not sure what it’s going to be but the photos of the “what’s coming” looked like it would even go across the highway to the ocean and be shops, housing, etc. There were 7 cranes working on it and huge piles of broken up concrete.\n\nI got to the room and no one else was there yet so I grabbed a bed and went through the packet of race stuff. They had copies of the road book which I had already printed off before leaving home so I didn’t really look at it since I had notes in mine. The road book has all the checkpoints in it and which ones crew are allowed at, which ones have food, medical, etc. In general it’s not that accurate as far as what food is really there at those checkpoints (what we’d call aid stations so I use them interchangeably in this report). Last time they changed it even 2 days before the race. They also had a few pages of the rules of the race. I’d think they’d print all of them off but whatever. They also had a technical letter which was to replace the pre-race meeting. In there they said you couldn’t litter but I still don’t see it in the actual rule book so who knows where the race really stands on the issue of littering.\n\nThere also wasn’t a timing chip to put on your foot like they have always had. Now the timing chip was in the bib like every other race I’ve ever been in. They do still have the small tracker devices that you have to carry that uses cell towers to track you in real time. So the zip ties I brought were not needed like last time to change the chip from one pair of shoes to another.\n\nAll of that said, I definitely should’ve looked much closer at the road book they had printed off as they had changed it without saying anything. I double checked the file I downloaded a week before the race and it says nothing about which checkpoints would take drop bags but this new one did! Normally this race allows drop bags at all but the first couple checkpoints and I think they never allowed them at the top of the mountain either. Now all of a sudden the drop bag locations were drastically reduced. I DIDN’T KNOW THAT!\n\nOn Friday (I know I’m skipping ahead a day for this part) I spent a couple hours carefully going over my race plan, time of day, time between drops, past race knowledge, etc all for the purpose of figuring out what checkpoints I would have drop bags at and what to put in them. The energy it takes to plan what you’ll want to eat at specific times for a 153 mile race is quite large. Plus all the other stuff you need at the right time. I’d never count on the food at the aid stations at this race. It’s sparse and not at all what we have here. Then I spent a couples hours making said drop bags. All together it took most of the day on Friday.\n\nLater that afternoon I went to the Oasis Hotel to drop off my bags and noticed I couldn’t find the bins for a bunch of my drop bags. Then I saw a sign that says which check points allow drop bags. Out of my 25 drop bags, 11 of them weren’t allowed! I didn’t have time to go back the 1.5 miles to the hotel to get a marker or my notes to make informed decisions so I just had to guess at which checkpoint I should put them in instead. Luckily one of my teammates had a marker so I could change the numbers on the bags. I think it was Julie but I was so freaked out I hardly remember anything. Thank you to whomever it was! I just took a picture of the bags with the new numbers so I could adjust my laminated race notes later. Everyone else seemed to know about the change or had a crew so they didn’t care about drop bags. Pay attention, especially if you don’t have a crew to double check stuff for you!\n\nAnyways, back to Thursday. The hotel we were at was called the Golden Sun. It was pretty nice but they had never hosted anyone from the race before so they didn’t know anything about how things were supposed to go. Things like them assuming we wanted to sleep in the same bed was just the tip of the iceberg we’d discover later. Usually we find out what hotel we were staying at about 3-4 weeks before the race. Teams are placed together in a hotel with several other countries. Once we got the news, I checked out their website and noticed their restaurant was permanently closed and very small to begin with. The race fee includes all the meals and they are usually fed at the hotel you are in. They were going to feed us breakfast (and their breakfasts were AMAZING!) but we had to go to the Oasis Hotel 1.5 miles away for lunch and dinner. That meant wasting an hour every meal just getting there and back. I was quite aware even Thursday at noon that I was running out of time to get stuff ready for the race. Having a crew to share the load of preparing things is so helpful. I remember last time we had time to go swimming and walk and shop around the town. I had zero free time this year.\n\nI met a couple American friends from last time checking into the hotel and we went to lunch at the Oasis. A lot of Americans got their own hotels or Airbnbs this year so there never were many people at lunch or dinner at the same time. In fact the first time I met a couple of the Americans was after the race. I really liked getting to know the people that I hadn’t met before. So many awesome runners with diverse running histories. Some are awesome at short distance (well if you call less than 100 miles short like I do) and some really start to excel at 3 days or more. All in all I got to know my teammates more after the race than before it.\n\nI got back to the hotel and met my roommate Franco Soriano. The third roommate was staying somewhere else we had heard. Franco had attempted the race once before and didn’t finish so he was nervous about it this year. It’s hard to give someone else words of wisdom to calm them when you’re nervous and freaking out a little yourself but I tried.\n\nThis year I was all over the place as far as how I felt about my chances to finish this race. I had some small niggles as far as injuries but nothing as worrisome as last time. I dropped weight like last time. 2 more pounds than last time as I got down to 151 before I left for Greece but I think those 2 pounds were lost muscle 😦 . I had the experience of finishing and what could go wrong on the course. Those were all good things. BUT. I was 2 years older and I barely finished the last time. I didn’t get the training in that I did last time (best week this year was 62 miles and I only did 2 a days for a week). I was without a crew. Sometimes finishing a race a second time is harder mentally because you get this idea that I already did it once, so I don’t have to finish again.\n\nAll those things went through my head over the summer which was race free for me this year. Finally around the end of August I remember telling my son I felt pretty confident. No idea why but I did. I kept that up for the most part until the day before the race. That day my legs felt dead and I wasn’t near as confident anymore.\n\nYou will hear this from everyone that’s done this race; This race is way more mental than a usual ultramarathon, which is pretty mental to begin with. Sure you need some speed and experience but that won’t get you to the finish in this race. Even the elites DNF this race because of mental issues and they have the luxury of time to fix issues that come up.\n\nIf you want the best advice I can give for Spartathlon, it’s this. Train a lot (especially 2 a days) and don’t quit. It seems like such a dumb thing to say don’t quit but it’s something you have to constantly keep in your mind. Quitting just isn’t an option that should be allowed to enter your mind in this race. If you keep it out of your mind, you’re much more able to fix or deal with whatever the issue is that you are currently having. Also, ask for help, even if they aren’t on the American team. Everyone is willing to help you! Seriously, they are. Did I say don’t quit yet? OK good. Don’t quit!\n\nI went for a run that afternoon while it was somewhat hot and got back to the hotel just as it started to rain. I talked to the family at 3pm as usual. Had supper somewhere in there. Later that evening Franco said his friends from the Philippine team weren’t using their room as they had an Airbnb so he used theirs and now we both had rooms by ourselves. No snoring!\n\nI slept great as I had pretty much been doing the whole trip. As stated before the breakfast was amazing with a bunch of different eggs, meats, cheeses, yogurt, desserts disguised as breakfast foods. I’d have like 4 croissants and load them up with jelly and honey, definitely more of a dessert than breakfast. I tried to charge my watch for the race and it wouldn’t charge. This race more than most I really want my real time pacing information, time, distance, etc. The race signs are all in kilometers and it’s so much easier to do math in miles when I’m tired. Luckily Amy has the same type watch and her charger worked. Another thank you to Amy!\n\nThen the whole drop bag set up and failure happened. I didn’t run as my legs felt dead and I didn’t really have time anyway. About half the American team took a picture after we dropped off our drop bags and before we headed off to eat together. A few of them I hadn’t met yet. I had talked to Jasmine’s husband Vince a little in the summer along with my wife since he was crewing her and he had some questions about it. Hopefully we helped. Here’s her crew report that could be some help to other crew. I’ll just put it here as well that there is usually a What’s App group for the crew and runners which is super helpful. I even get on the British teams group as well. The combined experience of that group is insane and very helpful. I think a bunch of them travel to this area multiple times a year so they seem to know where anything and everything is.\n\nSupper went well. Really I wish we did more of a lupper type thing. My wife and I have used that word for over 20 years but I’m not sure how common it is. It’s the meal you eat at 3pm to replace both lunch and supper and we absolutely love it! It would work so well at this race to give you time after the meal to digest and get prepared for the race. Eating in Europe takes forever and goes late which is the opposite of what I want the night before a race. I wanted to be in bed by 9pm but of course that’s not going to happen when you can’t even eat until 7pm.\n\nThere was very good conversation that eventually turned to the topic of the race at hand. Specifically about luggage. Yep! Something you’ve probably never had to worry about at any other race. As I said before, the hotel we were in was new to the race. They were very adamant that they weren’t keeping our luggage for us until we got back and had no idea if any bus was coming to bring us to the starting line. Part of the package with the race is that they keep your luggage in Glyfada during the race and give it back to you after the race when you get back to Glyfada. Those are stored in the hotel somewhere. Also they transport a small bag of necessities to the finisher hotels in Sparta for you. Those are picked up the morning of the race. Of course the most basic thing provided is a bus to get you to the starting line. Now we were being told by our hotel that they had no idea what we were talking about for all 3.\n\nWe weren’t sure if we were expected to walk the 1.5 miles to the Oasis hotel with our luggage or if there was very bad communication between the race and the hotel. Bob knew some race organizers and reached out to them to find out what we were supposed to do. Having to go to Oasis certainly would suck but if we knew that now, we could deal with it much better than right before the race. No one got back to him.\n\nI think we finished eating around 8pm and went back to the hotel. They had put breakfast in our refrigerators for race morning. I did my usual night time list of things to do. Taping feet, nipple band aids, etc. I don’t remember how long I talked to the family but I’m sure it was short. I laid out what to wear for the race and my waist pack. I already had my race bibs pinned on my shirt. Since they had the embedded chip in them, I couldn’t find a way to put it on my shorts without bending it or it flopping around so I put one on each side of my shirt. I wasn’t worried about changing shirts since I didn’t have a crew anyway. I dropped off a bag of food and items to Chris’ crew in case they were able to help me during the race. I had everything I absolutely needed already in my drop bags but having extra of a few things and my shoes with them gave me more confidence.\n\nThe previous night I slept just fine in my room and it was quiet. Tonight being Friday night was much different. Our hotel and specifically my room faced the busy road and there was a stoplight there. So of course there was the constant revving up of motorcycles and cars trying to act all macho. Being Friday I knew it would never stop until 2am at the earliest. My sound machine app did nothing to overcome the noise. I had earplugs along so I put them in and they actually worked. Then I remembered I’d have to wake up the next morning and I’d never hear it with ear plugs in! This is where a crew would’ve helped me more than anything. They’d be miserable trying to sleep without earplugs but would hear the alarm to get me up. Super sucky for them but good for me.\n\nI took out the ear plugs and tried to figure out my next move. It was almost 10:30pm already. I looked at my phone and saw a message from Bob that he never heard back from anyone at the race about the luggage yet and said we should expect to be scrambling on race morning to get our luggage figured out. My heart rate jumped! My mind raced to figure out what to do the next morning to deal with this crap. I pretty quickly decided us Americans would just rent a hotel room and put our luggage in there and offer it to any other countries who needed it so that issue was solved. I still set my alarm earlier in case a bus wasn’t coming.\n\nThe noise was still super loud. I went to all different parts of the pretty large hotel room trying to find a quiet spot. I almost was going to put the extra mattresses against the balcony window but I noticed the bathroom was quieter than anywhere else. I took all the pillows and laid them on the floor in the bathroom, then put towels on top of the pillows. I also put some under my arms to keep them off the cold ground. My head was beside the toilet and under the sink countertop. My feet were against the closed door. It actually wasn’t all that bad. I could still hear the traffic but it was enough that I thought I’d at least have a chance to sleep. I checked my phone again when I turned on the sound machine app and noticed Bob had messaged again. Someone had finally gotten back to him and said things would be as they should be. Bus picking us up, luggage, etc. It was after 11PM now. I set my alarm clock back to the original time which I think was 4AM.\n\nI finally “slept”. It was one of those nights that I remembered everything I dreamed which usually just means I didn’t really sleep much at all. 4 hours of crappy sleep is far from ideal when you’ll be running for 36 hours. Andrei literally got no sleep he said. I got up and starting going through my checklist of stuff to do. Checklists are awesome to help me not to forget something. Some people think it’s anal but there’s no reason to leave things to chance. Make a checklist!\n\nI brought my stuff down to the lobby. We weren’t really sure when the bus would show up (it’s Greece) but they were supposed to get us to the start line by 6AM so I went down around 5:15. The hotel gave us a key card for a room to put our luggage in (kinda funny their solution was the same one I came up with). Our bags for Sparta we were told to leave outside and someone would pick them up later. Just the kind of thing you want to hear, right? The bus eventually picked us up and then went to 2 more hotels before finally going to the starting line at the Acropolis.\n\nWe got there about 6:30AM so not much time to spare. The bathroom was the same trailer bathroom as 2 years ago with only 2 stalls for 600 people. Most people probably don’t know they’re even there as there wasn’t a line. Let’s just say I wouldn’t want to be a tourist to the Acropolis on the last Saturday in September. Especially don’t hang around any bushes along the paths! I used the bathroom right away for dump number 2 of the morning. Being I didn’t have a crew, I didn’t have my usual ziplock bag of toilet paper, butt wipes, and lube because I’d not have anyone to give it to when the race started. To no surprise, the bathroom was out of toilet paper which is the reason I usually bring my own. Following my own advice from the last time I did this race, I had brought the pillow I got on my flight to Greece with me. I took the weird plastic pillow cover off of it and tore it into strips to use as toilet paper. It worked OK. I have toilet paper kits in my race waist belt but I didn’t want to waste one here in case I needed them during the race. I was already planning on throwing the pillow away after I sat on it before the race.\n\nI never really got to sit on it for long though. We did another team photo at the starting line and had more people in it this time. After that it was pretty much time to get to the starting area where we stand around with probably every emotion other than sadness going through us. I was much calmer this year, not positive I’d finish but positive I wouldn’t quit. I missed my wife. I wanted her there, wanted to kiss her as tradition before a race. It really is hard to crew this race so I was glad she didn’t have to do that again. She was likely still up and watching my tracker that I turned on while still on the bus so I wouldn’t forget in the chaos of the starting area. I had talked to them very briefly when I got up. For most of the race they’d be sleeping, especially the hardest part in the beginning. Would anyone even know if I quit? Weird, stupid thoughts like that flicker through your head while waiting around, making brief conversation with other runners.\n\nI got my watch started up. Soon after the gun went off. Well I think there was a gun. Maybe just a countdown. Everything leading up to a race I can seem to remember perfectly but never the actual start. I often have to look at videos of the start itself. Once I’m moving, then I remember things again.\n\nThe temperature was pretty good and it was supposed to be mostly cloudy which was a good sign for getting through the first day under the cutoffs. I really didn’t want to waste the downhill like last year so I stayed over to the side so that I could more easily pass people. I knew they’d all pass me later but for how close I was to cutoffs last year, I wasn’t going to waste even 1 minute going downhill slowly!\n\nLike last year, I had a song I planned on playing on repeat in my head throughout the race. It was Sia’s “Unstoppable”. It was harder for me to put it to memory than last years song though. In the end I hardly ever had any song in my head. I wasn’t even in conversation with people that often. Much less than last time until later in the race as you’ll see. I just enjoyed the views and cruised along to my pacing chart.\n\nBeing early on a Saturday, the traffic was greatly reduced compared to prior years. There were a few people out cheering but that was much reduced as well, not surprisingly. By mile 6 nature was calling. Much earlier than I’d like! There were trees on the right side of the road so I went up the hill a little bit and went behind one of them. I hoped it wasn’t some sort of ancient site I was crapping on at the time. It turns out it was a park called Dafni Grove so that’s good to know. I was pretty fast and got back to running. Just about then I saw some Americans coming. One of them was Bob Hearn which I never try to be in front of because that’s probably a good sign I’m going too fast.\n\nI brought all the food I’d need with me and I was happy with my choices. I started putting water on myself and using the ice bandana sooner than I did last time because I had it from the start and didn’t feel like ever getting hot. The clouds were nice. Most things looked familiar from last time but I was clearly more in the moment now and paying attention to areas around me. It helped that there weren’t as many vehicles to worry about hitting me and I could actually hear things besides traffic.\n\nCheckpoint 4 is 12 miles into the race and nature called again. This is one of the few aid stations that I ever saw a porta potty so I used it (I didn’t even have to wait for anyone!) I didn’t have more poop kits until my checkpoint 24 (mile 54) drop bag so I was glad the bathroom had toilet paper and I could spare my second kit in case I needed it again. The big decision after crapping twice in just 12 miles is to take Imodium or not. Taking it will assure I’ll stop having to stop (unless I had some actual infectious cause), but there’s a real chance that I won’t absorb as many calories as well since everything shuts down. I really need to consume and absorb calories the first day to make the time cutoffs. Nothing hurt so I decided to skip taking anything. Plus I had only gone twice before the race start instead of my usual 3 so I wasn’t very concerned. Again, I was quite mellow and relaxed this year.\n\nI cruised along enjoying the views. Well, when they were enjoyable. The areas of the oil refinery are bearable but not something you want to take pictures of (actually you’re not supposed to take pictures in that area due to security). The race didn’t have any detours this year. The first thing about a Saturday start I didn’t like was that there weren’t many people out cheering in the towns. No school children to high five and sign books since there wasn’t school today.\n\nI noticed after a couple hours that my urine was red. It was just bladder slap so I needed to make sure not to completely empty my bladder for a while. I could’ve freaked out worrying about myoglobinuria, kidneys, etc but I knew I was fine. Instead I was calm and steady. Having finished the race once before really made a difference in my attitude. I think not having a crew in some ways helped as well. I was on my own. The stuff I put in drop bags should be there and I didn’t have to worry about Jessie getting lost or the car breaking, etc. Plus I had seen how helpful everyone is at this race last time and had weird confidence that I could get help if I REALLY needed it. After a few hours my urine was normal as expected.\n\nI reached the marathon distance I think around 4:25 or so race time. The tracker didn’t record a time and I can’t find the timing mat time anywhere online. Anyway, I was a little behind last time’s pace. Nothing major although I was only 20 minutes ahead of the cutoff. The next checkpoint is the first one you can see crew so I saw some of the American crews there.\n\nIt’s somewhere around here that I almost got run over. I don’t remember what town it was in but it was around noon. Some teenagers in a car thought it would be funny to almost hit me and cut right in front of me, laughing the whole time. It was definitely on purpose. Too bad I didn’t have time to chase them down. Luckily flipping the bird means the same in Greece as here so I settled for that.\n\nLater on in the same town a friendly stray white dog started running with me. She was very nice and would spend some time with other runners as well. Other dogs that were in their yards went berserk as she ran past. As they were tied up or behind a fence it wasn’t a big deal and she seemed oblivious to their wanting to kill her. Eventually though we started getting into other stray dogs territory. There were 3 larger dogs hanging out by a gas station that saw us coming and immediately started barking. I knew what was coming next. They came after her and she took off! 2 of them briefly got a hold of her tail or leg but she always managed to get away. Once she was far enough away from them, they lost interest and laid down to rest. I’m glad all this took place away from me. She had run with us for a few miles already at that point and I saw her again about an hour later. I’m not sure how long she followed the race. Dogs have been known to run 40 miles or more at this and other races. The longest I’ve ever had a stray run with me is 17 miles.\n\nI was feeling much better than last time while running along the sea, likely since it was much more cloudy. I was still behind my time from 2 years ago but I wasn’t worried. I knew I’d do much better in the evening than last time. I was falling asleep by 7PM that year which slows me way down and I knew I’d do much better this year and make up the time. I got to the 49km marker on the highway that I took a photo of on my run while staying at the Cokkinis hotel. The dog in the house next to it that tried to eat me while taking the photo wasn’t there now.\n\nNow while I felt better than last time, I was far from feeling great or even normal. This race pushes you out of your comfort zone. My quads were hurting for some reason. I’m sure it had nothing to do with climbing all around Acrocorinth and my legs feeling dead yesterday :) It was one of those things where there wasn’t really anything to do about it other than try to ignore it. I just reminded myself that I had strict cutoffs to get to for the next 20 miles before I’d have time to do anything. My goal was to not have it get any worse before that. I kept the mountain at mile 100 out of my thoughts completely. I needed to get to the next checkpoint first, then the next, etc for many hours before that.\n\nThe other issue I had was caused by my shoes. I pretty much only wear Altra Olympus shoes for races. They now make a road version of the shoe called Via that is supposed to have the same upper and just a road shoe bottom. It’s the shoe I chose to wear for the race this year. Since I didn’t have a crew I had to wear them from the beginning of the race. They are significantly heavier than the shoes I wore for the first 50 miles last time. Over 4 ounces per shoe! That definitely had something to do with the slower time in the beginning as well. The biggest problem was they were super hot shoes. I actually got heat rash the first day in these shoes that wasn’t a particularly hot day at all. Because of the heat, I got major blisters that luckily were under my toenails so not painful at all unless I touched them. In a trail race where you stub your toes a lot it would’ve really sucked!\n\nThe aid stations seemed to have even better volunteers than last time, although that’s hard to accomplish. They still didn’t have much for food I’d like but there were some potato chips occasionally this time. Somewhere in the heat of the day I got the last of the ice at one check point. I saw about 0.25 miles later someone had set out ice in a cooler so clearly it wasn’t the first time that station had run out of ice. I was happy the people behind me would still get some ice.\n\nCheckpoint 19 is my opinion the most difficult time cutoff of the race. I got there with 16 minutes to spare. I was no longer too worried about cutoffs after that. I knew I’d get to the 50 mile checkpoint later than last time but I wouldn’t be there near as long since I wouldn’t be changing shoes, etc like last time.\n\nCheckpoint 22 (mile 50) is the end of the difficult time cutoffs for the most part. It’s a major aid station and all the crews are there. The bridge over the canal is before it but I didn’t take a picture of myself this year. Time was always looming in my mind. I got there at 9:02 race time (4:02PM). 15 minutes later than my “ideal” but still 28 minutes ahead of the cutoff. I saw the American crews and they were willing to help. The main thing was my quads and I’d have to try to do something about it. Vince told me to “go to the tent, there are a couple of big dudes there that can double team you.” Now I of course knew that he meant the massage tent and double teaming meant they’d each massage a leg. Once I laid down though, I kind of wondered if he phrased it that way on purpose and I laughed.\n\nAmy came over with noodles and I propped myself up with my elbows a little as she shoved some in my mouth. The noodles tasted fine but Greeks seem to think runners like dry plain noodles. It was a recurring theme. There was never any kind of sauce that I could see at any aid stations, and the finish line meal at the hotel was just plain dry noodles as well. I only ate one mouthful as that’s all I could get down.\n\nThe dudes were indeed big and put oil all over my quads and started rubbing them (sounds like something from a book my wife reads). It wasn’t really helping to take the tightness away. Instead of trying to explain I needed knots pushed on and worked out, I just thanked them and got ready to keep going. I’m pretty sure I did my first sock change here and popped a couple blisters through the tape on my feet.\n\nAll 19 American runners made it past this checkpoint by the way. It’s pretty rare for everyone to make this cutoff. I think the entire British team did as well. If you’ve been in the race, you know this is pretty rare and significant. If you didn’t know anything about it, well now you do.\n\nAfter a quarter mile or so I stopped to work on my quads myself. It really helped that they were oiled up and I was able to get the knot out of the worst leg completely. The other leg had a very small knot, to the point that it didn’t seem worth the risk to fix it. Most runners will completely understand what I mean by that. You can sometimes make upper leg muscles worse by trying to work them out or stretching them during a race. I had no time to spend 15 minutes fixing one thing after I tried to “fix” something else. Therefore, not worth the risk at this time.\n\nIt was cooling some now that the sun was lower. I really enjoyed this part of the race. I passed Otto Lam somewhere between here and ancient Corinth. He wasn’t looking so great and is definitely a better runner than me so I was worried for him. In general there weren’t as many runners around me as last time. Not sure why.\n\nCheckpoint 24 I had my first extra poop kit. I was glad I hadn’t taken an Imodium earlier.\n\nI knew now to look around more in ancient Corinth a few aid stations later (CP26). Otto’s crew Jurgen was there waiting for him and he got my drop bag for me. All the other crews had left already as their runners were further ahead and their next helping point was only 6 miles away. I saw in someones picture that there was free pizza for runners at a shop down the road a block or so. That would’ve been awesome! Oh well, gels and snack foods for me. I got my headlamp and backup flashlight here. I changed out my hat for a headband as the sun would be gone in less than an hour.\n\nAround mile 60 or so I had to use another poop kit. It was hard to find a spot without a house. I finally found an area off the small but surprisingly busy road. Soon after I saw a few others looking for spots. Guess we all had the same GI timing. Probably we all ate the super dry plain noodles!\n\nAs expected I wasn’t getting tired like last time. I was keeping a good pace and catching up to where I wanted to be. By the time it was dark I was 42 minutes ahead of the cutoffs. Things were looking and feeling much better so I started preparing for the night ahead.\n\nIt seemed hard both years to know where I was the first night before the mountain. It was dark until the moon came up which helped a little. It was close to being full this year. I talked to a man from Israel. I never got his name but it was his first time at the race. He was very energetic and talked about another American he had talked to earlier (Chris). He was very aware of how mental this race was and seemed confident. He was sure I would finish.\n\nThis is around the time I really started to notice the documentary crew always being around me. I’d see them drive past throughout the day with him filming from the back of the car. After a while he’d start calling out my name. The race bibs have your name on them which is kinda nice but I’d always seem to forget to look at other racers bibs. To be fair, most had them on their legs which makes them impossible to read as it’s moving all over the place constantly. Other than about 4 hours in the middle of the night, I’d see him every hour or so. He’s from Germany originally I think but I swear he sounds French. He lives in California now. Anyway, I looked forward to hearing him yell “Nathan Marti I will see you at the finish line and you will talk to me.” Presumably, talk to him about the race for the documentary. Also presumably because I got to the finish line by myself and not the bus of despair.\n\nI have mixed emotions about other people telling me I’ll finish. It’s encouraging for sure but hard to know how much weight to put to the statement. Like do I really look that good and strong in my running that they know I’ll finish? Have they followed this race enough to know when someone will finish or not? Do they have some algorithm that predicts my time? That would seriously be super useful. Or, are they just shouting words of encouragement because that’s who we are: people who encourage others to do difficult things? Something in the way they said it made it seem more like a guarantee though.\n\nCheckpoint after checkpoint, I continued. Most of them I remembered from last time. I caught up to Franco around CP 32. He seemed nervous about our time. We were up about 45 minutes on the cutoffs. I told him we were the exact same time as I was 2 years ago when I finished so we should be OK. 2 years ago I would’ve been right with him in my nervousness, but this year I was glad to have caught up to the time I was at 2 years ago. I felt fairly confident and certainly wasn’t going to waste energy worrying. I’d save that until the second day if necessary.\n\nI got to checkpoint 35 at almost the exact same time as 2 years ago. I was at my lowest at that point that year with my full-on pity party in a ditch. This year I was feeling fine and not worried at all. I wasn’t in any better position this year and knew how much was left to go, but I had done it before so why not again? This is the halfway point of the race as far as distance goes. I was actually looking forward to the mountain. I knew I’d get up it fast and I had already decided days ago that I was going to go down it much faster than last time. I’d take the risk and run down fast.\n\nUsually there is a dirt road section after checkpoint 35. I had forgotten exactly where the dirt road section was other than it was somewhere before the mountain. So most of the night I was constantly wondering where the dirt road was. I even wondered if I had taken a wrong turn somewhere but then so had everyone else if that was to be true. Well, it had been paved and no one I talked to knew about that ahead of time. It wasn’t too bad 2 years ago on the dirt road but I’ve heard it’s miserable when wet so it’s nice that it’s now paved.\n\nThere weren’t the gunshot sounds like there were 2 years ago. The cars weren’t near as bad at night either. They were still there and annoying but the honking of the horn when they are right behind you didn’t happen near as often this year! With that said, most first timers commented how annoying they were so perhaps I just got used to them somewhat.\n\nI was still occasionally putting water on my head to keep cool. I think it was making my headlamp not so happy as occasionally it would start flashing or turning itself up to the brightest level and then back. I quit putting water on my head after that. I had a flashlight with in case I needed it and I had another headlamp in the drop bag at the mountain base that I switched to when I got there later on.\n\nNot much else really happened that I can remember until about mile 90 when Chris Rice and I crossed paths again. This was his first time here although he had done plenty of other things. We decided to stick together through the night if it worked out to help keep each other awake and moving. We had been pretty close the entire race anyway. Occasionally we would be apart if someone needed longer at an aid station, etc but pretty much the remainder of the race we were together.\n\nThis is also the part of the race that is pretty much non stop uphill until the top of the mountain. Some of it is certainly runnable but there are long sections of steep road switchbacks. I was discussing how I didn’t understand the people that run up the steep roads. Sure the elites probably run the entire course since they finish in almost half the time, but why run up the hill when you’re way in the back?\n\nRight about then, the Israeli that I had talked to earlier runs by me going uphill! He was probably 70 feet in front of me when he stopped, turned around, and took a few steps towards me to yell “Nathan Marti, I am 100% confident you will finish this race!” He then instantly turned around and ran away…uphill. I’m also 100% confident he finished, but I didn’t get to see him at the finish line to tease him for running up steep hills when there’s 18 hours left in the race.\n\nI’m just hopeful that he’s okay after what was to happen just a week later in Israel. For him to go from achieving a difficult goal to Oct 7th in a week had to be difficult. I remember very well what 9/11 was like, that gut punch we felt. The reason many of my running friends are veterans. Spartathlon had 49 different countries participating this year. The Earth seems so much smaller when you have friends all over the world. Some of the people I meet at international races will only become acquaintances, but even with them, we have a connection of running which is actually quite strong when you’re an ultrarunner. When you have friends from or living in other parts of the world, world news feels a lot more like local news. I guess the whole point of this paragraph is that going off to do races in other parts of the world is probably more about learning about other cultures as it is running a cool race.\n\nThere were a couple brief moments of being tired that completely disappeared once I could see the mountain approach. I don’t know exactly how far in advance you can see the mountain base (CP 47) but it’s miles. The lights from the highway that is near it are quite bright. The road is quite steep here. Chris ran ahead so he could change shoes or socks or something at the mountain base. Once I met up with him there and got my gloves, we attacked the mountain. We were about 45 minutes ahead of the cutoff when we started. A few minutes faster than 2 years ago.\n\nThere weren’t anywhere near the people on the mountain as then though. I really don’t know why. I was there about the same time. Perhaps with the cooler weather, everyone was further ahead already? There were way less runners that year too because of Covid so I really just don’t understand. Anyway, we still passed a few people on the way up.\n\nSo this next part isn’t really my story to tell, but it’s pretty good so I’ll do my best. The trail up the mountain is steep, rocky, and for the most part narrow with drop offs in many areas. They even have a rope and some wiggly wooden rails on occasion, presumably to keep us from falling off the edge. One of the American runners ended up quitting on the mountain. The interesting thing is that while he was making his way back down the mountain the race officials were telling him he could take a ride down in a vehicle. He of course didn’t believe them that there was a vehicle, but sure enough part way down the mountain they had a vehicle tucked away just off the trail that he could use to take down! I’m pretty sure he did indeed take a bumpy ride down in it. Chris and I never saw it but we weren’t really looking for a vehicle on the side of the mountain either. I rarely even saw the race officials that were along the trail.\n\nWe got to the top in about 30 minutes which I expected. There weren’t any photographers there when we crested the top like last time. We spent little time there and I took the lead back down. The way down is on a rock/dirt road that is there to maintain the communications tower and power line over the mountain. For years it has royally sucked. This year I had decided to just run down it and take my chances. I spent 45 minutes going down it last time and that is just ridiculous to me.\n\nAfter just a short time going down, I started to realize that it was much easier than I remembered. I wasn’t sprinting but the ground wasn’t near as rocky as I remembered. Sure enough, when I got to the first switchback corner, it got really rough and washed out like I remembered. Then on the straightaway it was nice again. They had clearly added a crazy amount of gravel and dirt to the rutted road in the last year. I’m guessing they didn’t try to dump the dirt going around the corners though, which is why those were still bad. It was smooth sailing until almost the town at the bottom where they clearly hadn’t added anything. I had told Chris all night how much it was going to suck going down and it ended up being easy. We got down in about 30 minutes. In fact, there were people online that were saying the new course records this year really aren’t records because the course was easier than it was decades ago. Whatever, haters gotta hate I guess.\n\nIn Sagas (CP49) I got some items from my drop bag. We were now about an hour ahead of the cutoffs which felt really good. We made a game plan for the crew stop at CP 52. We would take some time there and get set up for the day that would soon come. We were pretty sleepy and somewhat out of things to talk about so we slowed a bit in this section. It was nice to walk a bit. I remember last time having to sing out loud to keep myself from falling asleep as I weaved all over the place. I was in much better shape this time even without proper sleep the night before the race. Caffeine and having company were working.\n\nWe arrived at 6:37AM and his crew had our stuff in a nice quiet courtyard with some tables and benches if I remember correctly. I worked on my feet, ate, put on sunscreen, lube, etc. I can’t remember if I left my headlamp there or not.\n\nThe descriptions of the next long section of the race talks about it being foggy but it was glorious and sunny 2 years ago. This year, it was very much on point to the description. Very foggy and quite cold. I had taken my gloves off at the last crew stop because the sun would be up and it would get hot, or so I thought. I had forgotten about the fog being a possibility. It was under 40 degrees but not windy so it wasn’t all that bad. It wouldn’t warm up until the fog lifted after 10AM.\n\nIt was nice to get to familiar spots on the course that I got to much later in the day 2 years ago. I was 20-30 minutes faster this year in many spots. We were still gaining time against the cutoffs so I thought we could slow some. I told Chris he could take off if he wanted since it was daytime and I felt I was slowing him down. I planned on enjoying the second day more this year and not being forced to rush due to cutoffs breathing down my neck. Plus I was pretty sure it wouldn’t be near as hot as last time. He said we should finish together and that sounded just fine.\n\nIt would’ve been nice if it wasn’t so foggy though. Last time I was in this area, it was so beautiful. It’s almost all vineyards and workers were harvesting grapes. Plus zero cars, just peaceful and quiet. This year you couldn’t see anything through the fog and since it was Sunday, no one was out in the fields. I couldn’t even tell if there were fields at all it was so foggy most of the time.\n\nThere were a few other runners around which helped to make sure we didn’t miss a turn. I remembered pretty well where to turn anyway. We noticed more and more cars as the fog started to lift. It was a couple hours between crew access checkpoints (after 52 it wasn’t until 57) and yet we kept seeing crew vehicles stopped at every checkpoint. Chris and I were constantly thinking we were off on our pacing charts as to what CP was next. There would be a CP in the middle of nowhere that wasn’t a crew checkpoint (because it’s literally a table alongside a field) that would have 10 cars at it. It’s totally against the rules and really annoying. Many runners would get aid at EVERY aid station the second day from their crew. I didn’t see near as much aid being given along the road like I did last time but there was a couple times of that as well.\n\nLate morning is when I realized that the cutoff times that the race has allows for slower travel at night than during the day. We were keeping a good pace but slowly losing our 1 hour cushion. It seemed we would have to run more than I originally planned after the mountain. We weren’t in any danger but we definitely had to keep the time cutoffs in mind.\n\nI believe it was mid morning that both of us had to use nature as our toilet for the last time. This was my 4th time for the entire race which is more than I’d like due to the time it takes. It was a little more difficult to find a place to poop apart and yet close enough to keep track of each other.\n\nWe started the steep climb on the road to Sparta around 11AM. The road had lines painted on it now and it wasn’t near as black as 2 years ago when it was laid just before the race. The lines on the road made it so there was no shoulder on the sharp corners. This is a busy road as it’s the main road to Sparta. I’d wave my arms as much as I could as we’d approach a turn so that the drivers could see my arm before us. It didn’t seem to do much. What did work was putting Chris in front. Chris is taller and has a bigger frame than me. While he wasn’t in the military, he has that presence about him. Cars moved over for him!\n\nAgain and again, we’d see the same crew at check points that weren’t crew check points. I even made it a point to smile and wave at one woman that was crewing a guy that was always just behind us. I was trying to be nice but also being passive aggressive that I saw her cheating at every check point. To be clear, I saw her give aid to him at every checkpoint we were together at, she wasn’t just cheering him on which is also not allowed (for crew) but seems to be more reasonable. The whole point is to not have a million cars at checkpoints that don’t have room for them. There was even a woman from a country that usually doesn’t cheat that had a crew doing that this year.\n\nWhat is kinda funny about all this is that in the afternoon at one of the crewed checkpoints, we got accosted for getting aid where the car was parked instead of at the little check point table. Like 30-50 crews can fit in that little space! Chris’s crew apologized and carried all the stuff the 80 feet to the table area. I don’t really know what to say about all of it. It seems like they enforce what they want when they want and it changes all the time. It’s very unlike that here in the US and it’s probably why I see foreigners cheat all the time at races here, they’re used to nothing being enforced. They don’t understand all our rules are usually put in place by the governing bodies that give permits and their disregard puts the races in jeopardy.\n\nI remembered to take a few salt tablets this year so that I didn’t get hyponatremic like last time. It wasn’t nearly as hot as last time but it was still hot and there wasn’t as much wind as last time. I took 4 the entire day so still not much at all. Jessica Hardy would pass us on every section and then we’d pass her at every crew check point. She looked pretty bad at one of them from being overheated. We were pretty worried she dropped later in the afternoon since we hadn’t seen her for so long but sure enough, she passed us again on the downhill into Sparta.\n\nI can’t remember at which checkpoint but I think it was 65 that I changed shoes. I had blisters under 5 toenails and the shoes were so heavy. I didn’t care if my feet would hurt with less cushion, I just wanted lighter shoes so I could stay ahead of the cutoffs with a nice cushion. I changed socks as well. Having given Chris’ crew my shoes before the race definitely paid off. My foot turnover increased dramatically. It was much easier to keep up with Chris’ pace and not slow him down.\n\nWe were seeing the documentary director constantly from mid morning on. The runner he was following was obviously close to us. He said he knew we would finish. At this point I knew we would finish as well but there were still hours of running to get it done. I don’t know if the footage will ever see the light of day but there was a pretty comical display of Chris putting on lube that he captured.\n\nThe rest of the day involved going faster than I’d like but not so bad that I couldn’t enjoy the day. It was hotter than the first day but not unbearable for me. Amy lent me her ice bandana to use instead of my handkerchief. It is much easier to use so I will have to buy one of those, worth the money I think.\n\nAs we were going down the long hill to Sparta, we could see it was raining over Sparta with lightning and everything. The clouds weren’t going towards us so I wasn’t too worried but wondered what it was like finishing in the rain. It poured quite a bit we found out later. It was mostly cloudy and with the sun getting low, cooler as well.\n\nGoing downhill wasn’t as bad as last time. My muscles weren’t super bad but things still hurt enough that I couldn’t charge down the entire way either. We got passed by a few people but we weren’t concerned since we were just going to finish. We were ahead of my time 2 years ago, basically 35 minutes ahead of the cutoff. I told Chris I planned on walking the last part in Sparta to enjoy it and soak it in. There were several puddles on the sidewalk from the rain and I totally stepped in one when I wasn’t paying attention and got soaked.\n\nI got my flag at the last checkpoint and we made our way to the finish line. It seemed to take forever. I thought there was 1 less turn than there is but it was much more obvious where to turn this year at least. There were less people cheering than last time but more kids and such on the final stretch.\n\nChris’ crew met us on the last stretch and joined us up to the finish line and statue of King Leonidas. We finished in 35:28 by the time we got up to the actual timing mat waiting for all the runners in front of us to go through the finish line ceremony. It was great to finish with a new friend! There were a lot of non runners hanging out as well which made it very difficult to go through the actual finishing process of kissing the foot, getting an olive wreath put on your head, taking pictures, getting your medal from the city of Sparta, and drinking water “from the river”. Last time we didn’t get the water due to Covid so that was nice. It was so much more emotional the first time I finished. In a way this year, I knew I’d finish the race during the first night of the race. Two years ago, it was much more touch and go as to if I’d finish in time. Despite not being overcome with emotion, I was still immensely glad to have finished the Spartathlon for a second time!\n\nJessica finished a few minutes ahead of us and was still around the area with her crew. Franco would be the last finisher of the race but still got it done! The rest of the Americans finished hours before us. In the end I’m sure we could’ve finished at least 30 minutes sooner if we had to, but I wouldn’t have enjoyed it near as much. I just don’t have much desire to see how fast I can finish this race. Finishing itself is plenty for me.\n\nA few stats. 355 runners started the race. The limit is 400 but they didn’t even allow that many this year, apparently due to not enough hotel rooms. Of those 355, 255 finished (72%) probably one of the highest finishing rates. 16 of the 19 Americans that started, finished (84%)! I was 226th place. What’s more interesting to me is that in the 41 years of the race, there have only been 92 Americans that have finished it (on the US team) and I’m one of them. I might be off on that number slightly since I had to go through all the years, etc to figure out how many unique finishers there were and I could’ve messed up by a few.\n\nWe went over to the building next to the finish area that still doesn’t look completely built. I really don’t know what they normally use it for. It was busy but we were offered things much more quickly than last time. There were the usual 6 or so people with IV’s in their arm. They asked if I wanted my feet cleaned and I said yes since I never got the experience last time. They took off my shoes and “washed” them in what felt like ice cold water. It was seriously cold and made my feet hurt worse. They didn’t pop any blisters like I had heard they do from other race reports. Whatever, at least I can say I’ve had it done. They then comically tried to fit my feet in a small pair of those free sandals you get at the hotels in Greece. If I ever did it again, I’d just say no and not even stay around in the area. I would go straight to the hotel.\n\nWe stayed at the Maniatis Hotel which is a third of a mile away from the finish line. Before the race even happened I had commented to the running group that I wasn’t looking forward to the walk to the hotel after the race. I barely could move last time and we had the closest hotel at only a couple blocks away that year. Bob had said he was offered a taxi the last time we stayed there and sure enough they offered me one. I said yes immediately! There was no way I wanted to try to walk in those almost worthless sandals that were already torn by them shoving my feet into. Chris was onboard with not walking either. They said they’d get one right away. After what seemed like a long time even by Greek standards, we asked someone about it. We found out they were waiting for an ambulance to haul someone away in. There are a few people hospitalized every year after this race. Eventually we got in a taxi and went to the hotel.\n\nThe hotel is very nice and it didn’t take too long to get my room key. This time I was only supposed to have 1 roommate but it was someone I knew had their own place already so I’d have it to myself. Supper would be open until 11pm so I decided to shower and take a nap before I had any food. The shower wasn’t huge but it was immensely better than what I had at the finish line hotel 2 years ago and it had hot water. The room was super hot and the air conditioner never worked even after numerous phone calls. I had to just leave the balcony door open. I was so tired that the street noise didn’t bother me at all.\n\nI think I went to eat around 9:30PM or so. It wasn’t good at all. First a little soup of some kind and bread without any butter or olive oil or anything. I ate them and they took the plates away. Then I sat and sat. I was assuming there would be more and yes there eventually was more to come. It was dry noodles with nothing on them. It was super hard to eat it. Jessica had her crew bring her meal up to her room and so she just poured the soup on the noodles. If only I had had that option!\n\nI decided to go to the restaurant that we ate at last time to see if they had dessert. They were pretty much closed with just some people hanging out. There was some difficulty in understanding each other with the language barrier but eventually they figured out I was looking for dessert. They didn’t have any so I started to head out but then one of the men stopped me. He brought me to the shop next door that was a bakery since he had the key. It wasn’t his store but he had a key and said to just take anything I wanted! I suppose it would’ve been thrown away the next morning anyway. I got a piece of baklava that ended up not being that great since it was so old, but free baklava was a Godsend next to having nothing to eat.\n\nI walked around a little to loosen things up and see what the nightlife was like on a Sunday. Probably half the places were closed. I got some energy drinks from a kiosk for the next day and headed back for the usual on and off sleep after a race.\n\nI was always kind of disappointed that last time we didn’t see any of the sights in Sparta so I planned on seeing them this time. The drop bags wouldn’t be available until 9:30 AM so I went to the Archaeological Museum of Sparta which is across the street from the hotel and open already at 8:30. It was the cheapest museum at only 3 Euros. It had a good history of Leonidas and the usual sculptures and ceramics.\n\nI then went to the gymnasium that has the drop bags. It opened late as I suspected but I enjoyed talking to some other runners from I think Sweden before they finally opened the doors. They said they weren’t going to do the Spartan Mile because they felt it should only be for finishers. I’ve actually been torn a little on that issue as well. On one side I can see how the purpose is to run against people who are destroyed from finishing the race on “even ground” since they are all destroyed. At the same time, the spirit of the race includes all and since it’s just for fun, why not have all runners “compete” in it. I guess I lean towards the side of letting all runners that want to do it, do it. Certainly not for non-runners though.\n\nOn the way back to the hotel I had a long conversation with an old man about his life. We both were walking about the same pace; me because I was sore and him because he is old enough to remember WWII. He grew up in bombed out areas as a child in Greece and then they moved to the US and once his kids were adults, he moved back to Sparta. He was very concerned with kids always being on their phones, not working with their hands, etc. The usual things I would expect from a man with his experience and he’s likely not wrong. He told me a few things about the man who owned the Maniatis hotel as well but won’t repeat those things here. Very interesting though.\n\nMeghan Canfield said I could have her finisher shirt and hat that they gave at the finish line as hers didn’t fit. They had run out of them by the time Chris and I finished. They were from the city of Sparta so not an official finisher shirt but still nice to have. Thank you! What’s funny is it says “41th race” on the shirt instead of 41st. I checked out of my room and left my luggage in an area they said we could leave things.\n\nI headed to the track behind the Leonidas statue. I should’ve taken a photo with the statue again but didn’t. It was nice and sunny out. I finally met Matt Collins from the American team and talked to him while we waited for the festivities to begin. There were a lot more people than last time. About 3 times as many people and in my opinion, too many cameras and drones. I’d just like it to be a nice fun thing we do together with little fanfare. I think the trophy they had this year is fine and a cool memento for the winner (Matt ended up winning!) but do we really need drone footage?\n\nThe British team came up with the idea of doing a beer mile about a week before the race as well. I hate beer so I didn’t compete but now wish I would’ve at least tried. I’m sure they would’ve allowed root beer but I don’t know if that’s even a thing in Greece. That race happened after the Spartan Mile race.\n\nDespite the crowds, it was a great time running the Spartan Mile. I was slower than last year for sure. Things just didn’t loosen up very well at all for me. I wore the tightest boxers I have but Otto said I need to get tighter ones. Guess I’ll just have to buy a pair for this. Way too many cameras for me to go completely naked. I had mentioned in my last race report there was a way they tied their penis with a rope at the original Olympics but I didn’t know how. I finally did figure out how they did it but not something I was going to do. I won’t go into more details than that, which is probably already too much 🙂 At least no drones went down and hit anyone’s privates!\n\nAfter all the festivities I went to the tomb of Leonidas which is pretty unimpressive. It’s blocked off by a fence and is just a portion of stone wall at this point. After that I went back to the hotel to wait for the bus that would take us to an afternoon lunch hosted by the mayor of Sparta. It seemed like a fairly long drive, far enough that I doubted we were still in Sparta.\n\nIt was interesting to hear the history of Sparta that the mayor gave. Most of the rest of the speakers I couldn’t understand or hear well enough to follow so I gave up on that. The food was pretty good and came in a couple courses. We didn’t know there would be courses but I shouldn’t have been surprised. I was pretty hungry yet after the first course which was a lasagna type dish. Going along with the experience of last time, the vegetarians had an unusual meal. It was a plate full of potatoes, just plain potatoes. They didn’t even ask what the second plate would be since it was likely just another plate of plain potatoes. For my second plate I had some sort of beef dish I think. It was hard to tell what the options were so I just picked one and it looked like beef.\n\nMusic eventually started to play, which I didn’t know would happen. I was really sleepy by this point and just wanted to be in a bed. I went outside to get away from the noise and enjoy the sun a little. Jessica’s crew had taken her phone and had taken off sight seeing or something so she didn’t have it for days after the race. I joked that once they gave her the food after the race, they punched the crew time clock and left. Eventually we got on to the bus and left around 3:45PM I think. I slept a little but talked to Meghan and Chad for most of the ride. It was great to get to know them better.\n\nThe bus pretty much drove the race course in reverse so it was nice to see the areas that we ran through at night. It was almost dark by the time we got to Glyfada. I was in a different style of room and was supposed to be with someone from another country but that never ended up happening. I suppose they either figured out their mistake or he never showed. I met up with Chad at TGIFridays for supper. I needed some American food with American “French” fries. We got some gelato at one of the many places that serve it on the walk back to the hotel.\n\nI removed 2 toenails that night. I ended up removing 3 more when I got home from the race. Stupid hot shoes! At least they were easy to remove since the blisters had been so big. I slept pretty well that night.\n\nThe next day’s plan was just to relax by the pool and pack up since I had to be on a flight the next morning at 5AM and wouldn’t have time after the awards gala that night. I had already purchased a bottle of Cuban rum before the race even started to have at the awards gala. Presumptuous of me to assume I’d finish I suppose but I was in a store that had some so I got it.\n\nI tried to find a spray can of shellac for my olive wreath but whatever they sold me ended up making my wreath look burnt instead of preserved. It was a pretty ugly one anyway. I got the reject wreath I think. It had pieces sticking out all weird and was broke in a couple spots. Basically, the Charlie Brown wreath, if there was such a thing.\n\nI went to the Oasis hotel to do an interview for the documentary. It was an odd experience. He didn’t have any questions or prompting of any kind. I was told I could say anything I wanted. I was expecting questions so I didn’t really have anything prepared. I thought for a little bit and then said “I’ll start”. It’s hard to remember exactly what I said. Mostly it was about the race and the sense of family surrounding it. There were a couple other runners that were waiting for their turn and were nodding in agreement with a lot of what I was saying so that felt good. I lost my train of thought at one point so if anything gets used it will only be a portion I’m sure.\n\nIn the afternoon I went to the pool which was technically closed but cooled my legs in it anyway. Jessica Hardy and Andy Stankiewicz and his wife were already down there. I talked to them for a couple hours I think. Then it was back upstairs to finish packing. I had purchased a few too many things for the family so it was hard to pack everything in the suitcases but I got it done.\n\nIt sounded like there wouldn’t be a bus to get us to the awards gala but it was close to one of the tram spots so I just took that and got there early so I could grab at least one table for us. It was a different place than last time. It sounds like it hasn’t been in the same location for years. It was on the beach and even though I was right on time, I was early which is what I was planning on. I got a table in view of the awards area and watched as the workers scrambled to get stuff set up and cleaned. All the tables and chairs were dusty and dirty as I’m guess they were stored outside somewhere. The food was all catered in as well. I’ve been told it’s hard to find a place to host this event which is why it’s always moving around. I don’t know, I’ve been to wedding receptions bigger than this event many times, maybe they have small weddings in Greece.\n\nEventually, some more Americans showed up. I briefly talked to Camille but she was quickly off and making the rounds of photos, congratulations, etc that comes with winning and being famous. Since she is sponsored by companies, I guess it’s kinda her job in a way as well. More Americans came with stories of dangerous driving and impossible parking. I wasn’t surprised since I had walked there from the tram stop and had no clue where people were supposed to park.\n\nIt got dark and eventually the event started. It was buffet style serving which was nice as we could get what we wanted and not wait around for different courses. I have always brought an extra jersey to trade with another country. I should’ve just gotten like 5 extra this year to trade with a bunch but I had just one. I had decided earlier that I wanted a Latvian one. They happened to be at the table next to us so I went over there and asked if they wanted to trade. They all said they didn’t have any. I said, “That’s fine, tell me about where I should go in your country as I want to go there someday.” That’s actually true, Jessie and I have thought of going there. 2 runners said they hadn’t lived there for years, which I didn’t know. The other runner said there was nothing good to see. I argued that every place has something worth seeing, etc. Then I see him bringing his arms up from his lap with something in his hands and he says, “I think I might have something” in a style you see in movies when they’re making some sort of illegal exchange. Plus with the accent, it felt very spy like. It was a Latvian jersey! I felt like I must’ve passed the test, or maybe he just wanted an American jersey and it wasn’t obvious I was American at first. Either way we made the exchange and I invited him over for drinks at our table. Turns out he knows quite a few people as he’s been in the ultrarunning world and Spartathlon for years.\n\nThe awards program got going and the countries were given their medals and certificates in alphabetical order. That means we were almost last so we had a while. Eventually we got our turn. Some Americans had already headed home or to other locations so we weren’t all there. They ran out of certificates to print off so a few countries at the end of the alphabet didn’t get those, including us. I swear everyone thought no one would finish this year with them running out of everything. As I’m writing this 3 months later, we still haven’t gotten the certificates so I’m guessing that they’ll just give them to next years team to bring back to America.\n\nThe music started playing but I didn’t feel like dancing that much. My legs were in much worse shape than last time. Plus I enjoying talking to everyone. I talked to Matt, Tyler, and Walker mostly. I hadn’t even met Walker or Tyler until that point since they were staying at other locations. Since I had to be on a plane at 5AM I thought it prudent to get out of there somewhat early since I’d have to leave the hotel at 3AM. I think I left around 11PM.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that the taxi that the hotel had lined up for me for 3AM was actually there at 3AM! He got a nice big tip. The airport was kind of a mess. There was a huge line for check-in and it was only 3:30. It took about 45 minutes to get through to check my bag and get my ticket. I barely made it to the plane area as security was also super busy.\n\nThe plane was delayed for hours in Paris. I walked for what felt like miles at the airport to get to whatever gate it was supposed to eventually be at. I had to go through a couple security checkpoints which felt really weird since I was an international traveler and they usually try to keep us separate. Once I got there I ended up just laying on the floor for hours since there were hardly any chairs. I guess the good news is I got money back due to the flight being delayed so much. I wish we had that law in the US.\n\nThat’s the end of the story. While I really like this race, I think I’m done with running it. I wouldn’t mind crewing for someone else but the time of the year is really bad for our family so that maybe won’t happen for a while either. We are definitely going back to Greece, my wife has made that very clear! Perhaps if I can still get a qualifying time in my 50’s, I’ll try again. If you want a lofty goal for ultrarunning, you can’t do much better than trying to finish this race. Go for it!\n\nI’m not sure how to start a race report that I’m sure will be extremely long. I waited over 2 weeks to start this and still can’t organize things in a way that seems perfect. I’m not going to worry about it and just start. Hopefully by the time you’re done reading this, I’ll have written all I want to say and you’ll be informed.\n\nI think I first learned about this race in 2012 from the ultralist, 2013 at the latest. It interested me immediately. It is a race that follows in the footsteps of Phidippides. Who’s that? You may have heard that he ran from the battle of Marathon to Athens to proclaim the victory over the Persians and then died because it was so strenuous. Most historians would say that’s wrong. It may not have been him, and most likely the messenger never died. What’s very much agreed on is that Phidippides was a long distance runner by profession and he was sent by the generals of Athens to run to Sparta to ask for help to fight the Persians that had landed at Marathon.\n\nHe left Athens and arrived the next day. That’s 153 miles in less than 36 hours people! The Lacedaemonians said they would help but couldn’t leave until the moon was full based on their religious law. Who are the Lacedaimonians? That’s what the Spartans called themselves. It’s the area where Sparta is. Anyway, it’s not written when or how Phidippides returned to Athens, only that he did return. Most believe he started walking back the next day and likely took a couple days to return with the news.\n\nThis is where there is a lot of good story making that comes into play. The unsubstantiated story is that he then goes to the battle of Marathon, fights in it, then runs back to Athens and dies. That part of the story is written much later by less accurate writers. Also I’ll mention that the original writer Herodotus calls the runner Philippides and not Phidippides but everyone refers to him as Phidippides now. To me, if this part of the story is true, then he only died because he probably was wounded somehow. Clearly a marathon isn’t going to kill a guy that just ran over 12 times that distance the week before.\n\nIn 1982 some people decided to try to run the same route and see if it could be done in under 36 hours. A lot of the details of this 1981 run can be found on the ultrarunning history podcast among others. I don’t want to get into it too much. The end result was that yes it could be run in under 36 hours. Within months the Spartathlon race was organized and has been run every year since other than 2020 due to Covid. This year is considered the 39th race as they count this 1981 run as the first.\n\nSo I had always heard that the name Spartathlon came from adding Sparta, Athens, and London together. This is because it goes from Athens To Sparta and the first runners were from the UK (London) or at least associated with the UK. Recently I’ve heard it’s a combination of Sparta and a word meaning foot. Regardless, Spartathlon just sounds right to me. I don’t know what else I would call it if not that.\n\nIt is run the last Friday in September. I don’t know why. Phidippides started his run September 2nd or 3rd, 490BC based off of Herodotus’ account. This is using the Athenians Lunar calendar. If you go by the Spartans Lunar Calendar it happened August 3rd. The issue is Athens calendar starts after the summer solstice and Spartans start after the fall equinox. Because of the blue moon effect, this would put it in August for the Spartans. Which is right? I’d almost have to say the August date because why would the Spartans be following the Athenian calendar? Regardless, I’m just fine with them running it later in the year than he did it. The cooler weather the better!!!\n\nAt the end of the blog I have the translation of Herodotus Book 6 Chapter 100-117 with some extra stuff as well. It’s interesting history I think.\n\nTo me the distance isn’t the hard part about"
