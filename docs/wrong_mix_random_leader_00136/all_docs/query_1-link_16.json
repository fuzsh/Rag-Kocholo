        "text": "What is strengths-based SEL?\n\nThe “strengths-based” learning in Mindscapes encourages students to identify and embrace the things that they already know how to do well and build upon those abilities. It also helps students internalize how these skill sets can be applied to their own academic learning process through an optimistic, growth-oriented learning mindset.\n\nStudents are more likely to let down barriers and open themselves up to discovery in a safe space. With Mindscapes, they recognize their individual strengths and are encouraged to grow from there.\n\nA Shared SEL Language > Common Purpose\n\nMindscapes introduces a common language across grades K–5 for students to express themselves with confidence and clarity. Students build a strong sense of self as individual learners and as part of the larger learning community.\n\nA Vibrant Learning Community\n\nIn addition to individual awareness, Mindscapes helps students realize what it feels like to be a part of a larger learning community built on common purpose and respect for others.\n\nWith a shared language grounded in positivity and a consistent, scaffolded exploration of the same themes across grades K–5, the Mindscapes curriculum offers a unique opportunity to establish a vibrant school community that is successful, sustainable, and grounded in empathy.\n\nSelf—Community—World\n\nThe Mindscapes Self–Community–World continuum inspires students to think not only about their responsibilities to themselves as individual learners, but also their role in the classroom, and their potential to make a positive impact on the world around them.\n\nMultilingual Approach\n\nMindscapes is available in convenient English and Bilingual Spanish classroom packages. Many Spanish resources, including Student Notebooks and Activity Card packs, are also available for individual purchase.\n\nVisit the materials page to browse English and Bilingual Spanish package options and explore samples.\n\nAn Environment of Inclusivity\n\nMindscapes emphasizes the importance of empathy and inclusion at every level … but inclusion is not exclusive of the individual! In fact, it celebrates, acknowledges, and commands respect for what makes each student different.\n\nBeing aware of what makes you an individual allows you to recognize and celebrate that in others."
