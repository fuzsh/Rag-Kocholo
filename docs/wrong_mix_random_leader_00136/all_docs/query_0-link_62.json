This is our biggest month for some time, and as it's our Christmas spe- cial we've packed in as many reviews, views, and opinions as possible. Probably the biggest feature you'll all be looking at is our Protext v4.3 free disk. Unlike some other magozines, we've held back from charging an extra £1 on a regular basis for software which might be of limited broad appeal, and stuck instead to offering the best possible deals. Superbase Personal was one such example - probably the most useable and friendly Amiga database - and vProtext 4.3 is another. This powerful wordprocessor, though ageing, can still outperform most other Amiga packages in terms of raw wordprocess'mg power, a fact which our tutorials this month and next will attempt to show. For those who wish to upgrade to the latest version of the software or purchase a manual to enable advanced application, we have a hard-to-beat offer, so you can't go wrong. Add to this the most feature-packed maga- zine around, with more serious editorial pages than any of our competitors, a games section which buzzes with a life of its own, and cover- age of all new developments (see our author- atative At 200 review), and you need buy only one magazine - Amiga Computing.

COMPUTING AMIGA COMPUTING by John Butters Industry enthuses over £399 A1 200 THE At 200 met a warm welcome trom the industry at its London launch recently, with leading games houses C^edging Iheir immediate support (or the £199.99 computer. Most of its key specifications had already been revealed in last month's Amiga Computing, but Commodore man- aged to shock almost everyone with their ultra-aggressive pricing. We can now confirm that the 68020- based machine will be supplied with 2Mb ot memory and Workbench 3, but it does not have a high density (loppy drive or SCSI II interface. Around 60 per cent o( the 3,000 titles available (or the Amiga are claimed to be compatible, and recent releases are much more likely to load successfully. Al the computer's launch several firms unveiled sottware they had been develop- ing behind closed doors lor several months, and many promised A1200 games belore Christmas. Among the companies working on sottware are Electronic Arts who will release Delude Paint IV AA, and top games houses Gremlin, Microprose, Ocean, System J and Psygnosis. Many ol the first releases will be improvements on current Amiga or PC games, but most firms said they expected to release Al 200-specific products around next spring. No software is bundled with the com- Amlgo 1200 - wr/comrrt with oprn amu A600 - the C64 of the 90s FOLLOWING the launch ot the A1200 with its state of the art graphics. Commodore promise Ihal the A600 has a safe future as \"the C64 of the 90s - an entry-level home computer\". The firm have ruled out immediate pnce cuts, but because of limited Al 200 availability has featured Ihe A600 at the centre of a £3.5 million advertising cam- paign running until Christmas. Targeting children and their parents, adverts will appear in several consumer magazines, national newspapers and television. Most feature the line \"Have you got what it lakes?\" Said Commodore's national market- ing manager Dawn Levack: \"Our research shows thai youngsters see the Amiga as an aspirational machine with superb software. \"But it also shows thai it's mostly par- ents, of course, who do the buying, and they want a little more tor their money. The Amiga satisfies both.\" The software industry also says it will continue supporting Ihe 16-bil Amigas, with many firms now planning to release two versions of their games. NaUunal TV adi tot the A600 Sumner denies console claim AN INDUSTRY insider's claims that Commodore are secretly working on an Amiga-based games console have been vehemently dented by the firm's UK boss, Kelly Sumner. The source told Amiga Computing that the £200 console would be based on a 68020 processor running at 16MHz and teature the new AA chipset A plug-in option would enable a motherboard to be added, effectively building the console into a full Amiga, with a keyboard, serial and printer ports for less than £500. \"We've said for a long time that we can sell as many Amigas as we can gel. puter and although the A1200 has an IDE interface, the manufacturer has decided against selling a hard drive version until at least next spring. And in an exclusive interview with Amiga Computing, Commodore boss Kelly Sumner said lhat a price rise (or the A1200 was a \"real possibility\". \"Most international companies - including Commodore - deal in dollars,\" he said. \"At the moment manufacturers are being hit by a weak pound, and the situation is likely to get worse.\" But he concluded: \"The Amiga brand has been ot the forefront of computer games technology since it was launched in 1987. The Amiga 1200 will keep it there.\" Sumner. Amiga tontttle o drram mothlne' so why bastardise our price point to go into that market?\" asked Sumner. He said that PCMCA costs would need to come down before such a machine could become feasible and said the Amiga con- sole was a \"dream machine\". It was also claimed that future versions ot the operating system will support Motorola's Digital Signal Processor, PostScript, net- working and printer and file shar- ing.

All that Yorkshire Television needed to get Data Blast up and running was a £299 A600 and Europress Software's versatile Easy Amos pro- gramming language costing £34.99. The producers say the pair were chosen because it was felt their viewers would prefer to see something they would be able to create In the same way on their own computer.

Some of this time is usually spent play- ing the hot new games released lor the Christmas season, but it appears that Santa may not be as co-operative this year. More and more American game soft- ware companies are going PC-only, cit- ing relatively low sales of Amiga software compared to MS-DOS games. Sierra, Dynamix, Accolade, Spectrum Holobyte, Broderbund, and Activision all used to be big supporters of the Amiga - now they either don't do Amiga versions of their games, or they release them only for the healthier European market. Almost at) of the US game companies which do support the Amiga are simply importing games from the UK nowadays. Amiga users are hoping that the A1200 will revitalise the US games market, but with Commodore marketing the Amiga almost exclusively as a \"multimedia work- station\", that doesn't seem likely. So it looks like while you'll see plenty of neat hardware and productivity soft- ware from this side of the pond, the sup- ply of games is slowly drying up. Hooray for HollyWare One company which Is still producing games in the US is Hollyware Entertainment. Their new game, Lords ot Time, traps astronaut Major Tom in a medieval land of zom- _ »«■ « ■ bies and magic (some Denny Atkm reports on the latest one lell David Bowie and Peter Schilling - I think they've been look- ing for this guy). You have to guide Major Tom through the land known only as The Realm in search ol a human king named Tanor, who may have the key to returning Tom home. If you ever played Microlllusions' classic Faery Tale Adventure, you'll be right at home in this game. In fact, HollyWare now developments from the USA market Microlllusions' old products. It uses the same overhead, slightly iso- metric view, and you are once again walking around a giant land in search of spells. This game has more options, though, as you'll run across weapons, learn spells, and con- verse with other characters as you make your trek. Also the land is magnitudes larger. Hollyware makes a big deal out the fact KMC I A memory tonf* art finally braining to make an appeatanie Paying off credit cards You've got 2Mb in your cute little A600. and you thought that would be plenty. After all, you're just going to use it to play games and pop out the occasional letter to Mom, right? Well, since you've discovered the joy of multitasking you've probably found that 2Mb just isn't enough, especially on an A600HD NewMedia, a California company, has come out with two PCMCIA RAM cards designed specifically for the Amiga. Available in 2Mb and 4Mb sizes, these cards use a custom dynamic RAM scheme called PSRAM instead of more expen- sive static RAM (SRAM). This allows them to fit more memory on the card (4Mb versus the 2Mb maximum of current SRAM technology) at a lower price. You can't use the PSRAM cards as storage devices like you can SRAM cards - they're usable as system RAM only - but not many people are going to use a S250 eard to replace a $1 floppy anyway. I tested NewMedia s 4Mb card In both the A600 and A1200. You simply plug the card in and turn on the machine - no messing around with PrepCard necessary. The card works well with both machines, but is a better bet tor use on the A600 Unlike DRAM, PSRAM needs to be refreshed periodically, and when you combine the time nec- essary for this refresh and the overhead of only running on a 16-bit bus. adding memory in the PCMCIA slot can slow your A1200 by over 30 percent. The A120O's trapdoor local-bus DMA slot is the best place to put memory expansions on that machine, since It's a full 32-bit slot. On the A600, though, the NewMedia card didn't affect the speed at all. A 6Mb A600 certainly makes for a powerful little transportable machine. NewMedia's president told me that the company plan to release a whole line of PCMCIA expansion cards for the A600 and A1200, including SCSI and serial port adaptors. NewMedia can be contacted at (714) 453-0550. that the cities, objects, and dungeons « the land move each time you start the game, allowing infinite re-playability. However, after you send 35 or so| hours solving this the first time, I doubt you'll want to dive In again, The game itself is entertaining, although I'll have to admit that I'd rather have spent more time solving puzzleSi and exploring than killing the annoying spiders that kept following me across the countryside. It's not ground-breaking by anj means, but there's enough here to keep the casual player occupied. It works fine on the A120O, although it's a bit touchy on the joystick on fast machines.

Or | are you looking for an analogue joystick | to gain that extra degree of control in I your flight simulations? DigiPrint has the solution. The DP Bus Mouse Interface and DP Analog Interface adapt IBM bus mice and joysticks respec- J lively to work on the Amiga. These aren't your typical *built-in-a- garage\" adaptors with screw-together connectors, either. These high-quality devices have factory-manufacture* moulded ends thai won't come apart it you jerk the cable accidentally. The DP Bus Mouse Interface is elegant in its simplicity - just plug in an IBM Bus Mouse or trackball and then plug the interface into your Amiga. If you want to use a top-quality PC mouse, or save some money and buy a bargain-basement replacement mouse, this interface is for you. The DP Analog Interface is a must- have for flight simulator aficionados. Unlike simple analogue adaptors, which just rearrange the wires and add a capac- itor to increase the joystick's range, the DP interface has a switch that adjusts the joystick's precision. In the past, an interface that worked well with F-19 might not have offered much' control with Birds of Prey, for instance. Flipping the three-position switch allows the DP interface to work well with all Amiga flight simulators. These interfaces retail for only 115 each, and DigiPrint says they should be available through UK computer shops thanks to the their agreements with major distributors. DigiPrint can be reached at PO Box 13016, Richmond, VA 23225; (B04) 560-1 769.
