After all, it’s their broken backs that this whole thing’s built on.

Well, I heard it will be called Mortal Kombat Trilogy and that it will consist of new characters and old and new backgrounds similar to the N64’s MK3+. Is this true? Bill Thomas San Diego, CA '**■» HV Hi, I just got a copy of issue 83, the one with the V.F. Kids bit in it. I live in Japan and I just thought I’d let you know that V.F. Kids (or Big HeadVirtua, as we call it) has been out and complete for about two months now^j^^^tottl to get used to. The reach is different and you tend to smack heads ajot, but it’s just as much fun as VF2, if not more so. I also have a couple of question^MH^H^^. 1. Is Virtual ON: Cybertroopers out in arcades irraBj^HHBH 2. Is Gundam for Sony PlayStation in stores in 3. Who put all this tapioca In my underwear? 4. Have you guys ever tried Habu-saki? Sucking on^M^make has never been this much fun. Terry ‘lost in Tokyo’ Lebermann ROGER: What can we say? Things change like crazy in this biz. PlayStation got the Jump on the NIK sive rights to MK3 last Kl. year. Sega countered by JSk, snagging the exclusive rights to UMK3 earlier this year. As for Mortal Kombat Trilogy, expect it for the Nintendo 64 and PATRICK: First of all, glad to know we have some readers in the land of the 1. Yes, Virtual On is out in arcades here and while it’s probably not doing as well here as it is there, it seems to have been fairly well received. I like it anyway. 2. No, Gundam is not out for PlayStation, sjwir . and I doubt it ever will. The truth is, most ^ m people in the States don’t know what / 'fSjgi Gundam is all about. W 3. 1 did.

I’m scared to death of the N64 controller! I v swear it. Don’t we all agree it looks a lot like a claw? I can just imag- ine it waiting for me to fall asleep at night, so it can team up with KN the beast in my closet to kill me!! It’ll use its analog stick to drag %. itself across the room to my bed. its cord trailing behind like a tail. Then it’ll climb onto my bed. and use its cord to disembow- el el me! I swear it! BEWARE the N64 controller! BEWARE! Evan Shea Scotch Plains, NJ ROGER: You’re right, Evan! I thought it was just my imagi- nation playing tricks on me, but I’ve been noticing that every time I turn my back, the N64 controllers somehow seem to move closer! The other day I came in to work and found some reddish stains on the N64 controllers and no sign of Patrick! Oh sweet horror, they eat vegetarians! But seriously, Evan, N64 controllers are just another product of the Man, and the Man’s more interested in eating another 70 bucks out of your pocket than eating your physical self, at least for now...

Jim ‘I’m not stupid’ Campbell Fairview Park, OH BILL: Well, Jim, some people say that Breams are the mirror of the soul. Other people say that dreams of violence imply some kind of mental imbalance.

Of course, that might be because I think oatmeal really sucks... unless you, like, wear it... or, uh... or something... nuGame culture your Previews and Japanese Previews section, I saw some very interesting games. Grand Theft Auto and Wild, Pure, Simple kind of reminded me of those games in Game Ideas. Maybe those readers who send in those ideas could get those people at BMG Interactive or Artolink to take a look at their wild, pure, and simple ideas. P.S. What the HELL were those two bears doing on page 49 of your Tekken 2 Feature? Matt Edwards, Shipman, IL to the delusional fantasies of our readers. Man, you thought Resident Evil was scary! And coming soon, you will start seeing some of the game ideas that get tossed around by the GAME PLAYERS staff. Be scared, be VERY scared! As for the bears, they were just having a daily affirmation. Of course, I don’t know if they had to pay $50 for their daily affirmation like I have to! of the old on To some people, videogames are a matter of life and death.

Why did you allow that ad (the Sega Saturn Naked Girl ad) to be in this magazine? I know that a lot of people will send you letters on this, so make a sec- tion in the Reader’s Network like you did on the ‘Michael Pines’ issue. I’ve known your mag for a long time, and I remember all the letters that want- ed nudity and all responses from you guys saying NO!!!!!!!!! Of course, it’s not all your fault. Sega was the one who got the idea. I really like your mag and I still will. Christopher Dela Cruz Old Bridge, NJ CHRIS: Aw, come on, Christopher. You can see more skin in a Sears catalogue. The truth is, I have nothing to do with what ads make it in the magazine, but I’d hardly refer to that girl as ‘nude’ since she was wear- screen shots. My game is called protest the Viet Nam war on the commons at Kent State. Then, the National Guard shoots you and you die. Oh, well. Peace. Katie Bubenik, Worthington, OH BILL: Bosh, Hade, it’s not often that we get such an historically-inspired, thought- provoking game idea like this one! So do you wear a lot of tie dye clothes or did you just eat too much Granola this morning? Hey ho, way to go, Ohio! That’s all, Folks! This month’s Mystery Prize goes to Marcus Ranucci, of Oak Park, IL, who is soon to take up residence in The Box. Please don’t send anymore Game Ideas. We’re not going to run this particular section in Ultra GAME players. Thanks for all the great laughs! My game is called High Velocity. You play an unemployed mime named Cletus, who travels around the United States on a turbo goat. Your goal is to run into as many pedestrians as is humanly possible. For every pedestrian you hit, you get five pesos and the goat yells ‘BOOYAH!’ John Hawthorne-Brown Denver, CO The slaps fly fast and furious in Sissy Fighter, mother of all sissy fights! Nerds, geeks, dweebs and wimps all come together in this competition to determine who will be king of the sissies! In Sissy Fighter there is only one rule: no crying before the other guy hits you. Jimmy Mills, Palm Desert, CA BILL: You know, John, we always look forward to just about any game idea that involves a mime. There’s just something Intrinsically hilarious about those little guys in the berets that makes you wanna maim ’em. And that’s why you didn’t win, John. No mime maiming. H’s as simple as that YOu did, however, get a few bonus points for the talking goat, even if his vocabulary was limited to the level of a Quandco boot camp drill instructor. BILL: Wow! Now here’s an idea that really rocks! Jimmy, you dam near won the Big One, buddy, except for one small detail! What were all those small watermarks scattered all over your letter? If my guess is right, those were... TEARS! Ya big sissy, you knew you wouldn’t win, so you started crying, didn’t you? What a gtrty boy! Ha, ha, ha! Run home to mommy, ya little baby! You didn’t win, you didn’t win, nyah, nyah, nyah! You didn’t win! The name of my game is Hired Prey. The point of the game is to get some dumb-looking people and tell them that they’ve won a wonderful free weekend at a forest resort. When they show up, you hunt them for sport. So, Bill, guess what? You’ve won a wonderful free weekend at our beautiful resort. You’ll be able to relax and just enjoy the sights. Oh yeah, don't forget to bring your running shoes! Marcus Ranucci, Oak Parte, IL BILL: Alright! Thanks a lot, Marcus! Since you’re the Big Winner, we’re not only gonna send you a Mystery Prize, but we’re also gonna throw in a tour of the GAME PLAYERS office! Imagine the thrill of meeting me in person!

Nashville, TN *** MIKE: 1 . 4s of right now, EA has no plans for an NBA Live ‘96 for the Saturn. However, if Saturn sales pick up soon, expect EA to quickly put it out 2. NBA In The Zone is oof going to fte on the Saturn, but there is still hope that NBA In The Zone ‘97 will appear on the Saturn. 3. NBA Action has been released. I reviewed It last issue. It isn’t the best basketball game, but is the only NBA licensed game on the Saturn. 4. Yes, Sega is making Worfd Series Baseball ‘97 for the Saturn and it should be out real soon, if it isn’t already out I’m hoping to review that game in the next sports section, so stay tuned. I’ve noticed that Sega commercials con- stantly degrade Nintendo. I don’t exactly agree with that completely crazed pyscho who put the letter out in March 1 995, but I think that Sega should not be bad-mouthing Nintendo, even though Nintendo’s a little slow in releasing things. I'm a die-hard Nintendo freak and I would like you to send your opinions to: (censoredoutj.PS. Don’t make fun of my name. I have your address. Vicky Anastassiou Vancouver, BC CHRIS: I agree with you, Vicky. When Sega first started to take shots at Nintendo, H was kind of funny and showed a lot of spunk. But now they’ve taken it a little too far, appearing instead to be a whining, bad-tempered child. At the f 3 show last May, Saga’s big line was ‘Mario who?’ — come on. Come September 30th, they’d better know damn well who Mario is, ’cux he’s got the best game I’ve ever seen. BILL: Why would I make fun of your name? Just because it’s a little bit... CHRIS: Shut up, Bill. Hey Bill, gimme back my socks! Count Spankula Prospect, N.S. Canada BILL: Look, Spanky, for the last time, I don’t have ’em!

How, if we could just get some folks like them at the DMV. I’m writing this letter to praise the powers that be at Sony. Recently, I had major tech- nical problems with my PlayStation. After an unusual amount of B.S., outright lies, and red tape, two individuals at Sony in San Mateo came to my rescue. They listened to me and helped get my PlayStation fixed. Within two weeks, I had sent my PlayStation in to the service center, had it fixed, and had it back in my game- addicted hands. So, I’d like to thank Sean O’Connor, who is a super- visor at SCEA, and a customer rep. named Maurice. (I never got his last name.) They really did their best to help me out, and more importantly, they didn’t lie to me, as a few others did. So, I'd like to say , hats off to Sony for having the good |udgement to hire these two guys, and I just wish all of their employees were as honest. Thanks Sean and Maurice!!!!!!! Ken Wilson Seaford, DE PATRICK . jt, I have a few things that I would like to know: V- A 1. How come cartridges can't handle FMV? Is it because it uses up to much memory or space or something? 2. Is Resident Evil going to be for a PC? 3. In the June issue, Ashley ‘Sensational Gravity Girl’ Harter sent in a letter. She said, ‘Now There’s A Frood Who Really Knows Where His Towel Is.’ What the hell j ,'yK is that supposed to mean? Also, Mike and Roger suck. Bill And Chris should beat the crap out of Mike and Roger and slap their asses into The Box. Paul Pollack Coconut Creek, FI MIKE: 1, Each Meg of memory that is added to a cart costs the developer more money. FMV eats up Megs and frankly, it just isn’t worth it, since it adds zero to the gameplay. 2. Doesn’t look like it, but it’s always possible with some of the new 3D cards for the PC. 3. The reference is to a Douglas Adam’s novel HHciiliikers Guide To The Galaxy. It basically means you know what’s up. I hope your miserable uneducated brain can comprehend the translation I provided for you. Perhaps reading a book might inspire you to start 0 s s aai Hey GAME PLAYERS, I’ve got some questions: 1. When is Chris leaving the staff? 2. How long has GAME PLAYERS been around? 3. When does Bill get a raise? 4. Where does the next dead horse show up? 5. Why is my letter so sophisticated? Pete Miszewski miszewski@execpc.com DILL: I’m always glad to answer a few sensible questions from a normal fan: 1 . We never said he was going. What we did say was that he was going out of his mind... 2. This is our ninth year, but sometimes it feels like 900. 3. Not often enough... (and no, I didn’t add this part to Pete’s letter!) 4. It’s not where he shows up, it’s how he shows up. First, there’s this smell... 5. Probably because I fixed all your spelling, grammar, and punctuation mistakes before I printed it! !

As a side note on this story, Ocean offered Worms to Atari over nine- teen months ago as the first console version of this best selling game. Atari passed on the title as they weren’t sure if it would sell. It really makes you wonder, huh? Also recently announced for release is BattleSphere from 4Play. The outstanding space com- bat title, which has been in development for over two years, is in the last phases of development. 4Play, who will be publishing the title themselves, is hoping to have the title on store shelves by September. There has also been talk of Telegames considering publishing additional finished titles that Atari has turned down the opportunity to publish. The first of these titles will be Towers 2, a real-time RPG in the tradition of the Ultima Underworld series r i’m y our ^ NIGHTMARE! While the graphics don't look quite complete yet, who could resist taking on an Imperial Walker? Slow developement pace is cited ready for the US launch as originally hoped. LucasArts is doing the development of Shadows of the Empire while Nintendo themselves is publishing the title. O fficials at Nintendo have commented that development has not progressed at the pace they had hoped for and, as a result, Shadows of the Empire will not be 14 GAME PLAYERS September 1996 B oth Sega and Sony are reporting massive increases in sales at their new $199 price point. Sony and Sega reps have both reported that the sales of both PlayStation and Saturn have jumped dramatically since the drop in price to $1 99. Sony is claiming increases of two and a half to three times its pre-E 3 sales numbers, and Sega has claimed two and a half to three and a half times its pre-E 3 sales numbers. Of the retailers we spoke to, the sales rates of both Sony and Sega were virtually identical at this point in time. It is obvious that both Sony and Sega are hoping to get thousands of more machines in US homes before the launch of the Nintendo 64 this September. Mad Catz introduces its Nintendo 64 Product Line H ad Catz, which has designed controllers for the Super NES, Genesis and PlayStation in the ■past, has now made moves to support the Nintendo 64. The two main items for the Nintendo 64 will be the ‘Advanced Controller for Nintendo 64’ and the ‘Mad Catz Analog Steering Wheel for Nintendo 64’. The Advanced Controller features a turbo button, Mad Catz’s patented floating directional pad and a three pronged, design similarto the original N64 controller. The Analog Steering wheel controller is identical to their PlayStation steer- ing wheel, which features an analog wheel with 270 degree rotation, two analog foot pedals, eight digital buttons and two-way stick shift. In addition to these two controllers, Mad Catz will offer other Nintendo 64 accessories such as: RF converter, AV cables, 256K memory carts, a flight stick and controller extension cables. September 1996 GAME PLAYERS 15 r -\\ Matsushita Announces New M2 Specs T he M2 has been shrouded in mystery almost since its announcement a year and a half ago. Now Mr. Masao Itoh of Matsushita subsidiary, Panasonic Wondertainment, has indi- cated M2 will contain not one, but two Power PC 602 chips running at 66 Mhz, 8 MB of RAM and two expansion slots. The first slot will be for a memory card, while the second is a stock PCMCIA slot for use with modems, sound input devices or many other possible uses. Matsushita is still claiming an under $300 price point. All of these additions are in the hopes of being able to generate one million polygons per second, however, as yet there have been no real indications of how close Matsushita is to that goal. Without a doubt, Matsushita appears to be trying to create a new high end console market. Even conservative estimates place the machine at a $500 price point, which no machine, regardless of manufacturer, has achieved wide- spread success with in the US market. It should also be noted that a company of Matsushita’s financial power has never been a player in Nintendo and Square have re-established discussions S ources at Square LA have revealed that high ranking executives from Nintendo ■have been to the offices recently to reestablish the possibilities of Square developing for the Nintendo 64 once again. While Square has made no official comments on the visits, after Nintendo’s impressive showing at E 3 , Square will most likely begin work on some Nintendo 64 projects once again. ■ i hile programmable pads have been around for LcT a number of years, few are as flexible and rV- powerful as the PsychoPad Joystick. If you’re having a hard time hitting Akira’s ‘spod’ triple strike combo, simply program the twelve move combo into one of the PsychoPad’s twelve programmable buttons and exe- cute it at the push of a button. Is it fair? Well... not really, but then again, it is nice to use to get past that one character in a fighting game (or any game for that matter) that gives you the most trouble. The joystick itself is of solid construction, and the buttons can take some punishment as well. While all of this is well and good, probably the best feature of the PsychoPad is that the same stick works on Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation and Super Nintendo. This is all accomplished by means of three different cords that plug into the pad itself: one for each system. In this way, you can purchase one joy- stick, and use it on most of the systems you own. WHAT'S GAMES CHAT XBAND X-Band and PC to play together? S hortly after announcing plans for their Japanese Saturn network, X-Band seals a deal ■with Sega of America. Catapult Entertainment, which has created and maintained the X-Band network for 16-bit consoles for many years, have finally made a move to the next generation of consoles. The US Saturn X-Band net- work will provide Saturn owners with the capability to play games with other Saturn owners around the country and is slated to begin operation by Christmas of this year. In addition to playing other Saturn owners, the X-Band network will allow Saturn owners to play against PC owners in cer- tain titles that are written to take advantage of the forthcoming X-Band PC network. For example, Catapult is currently in discussions with Westwood Studios regarding the possibility of including the necessary code to allow the forth- coming Saturn version of Command and Conquer to play with PCs on the X-Band PC network. Such developments could allow for more than two machine networking (a la Saturn Link Cabl for many titles. The X-Band network will requir the forthcoming Saturn NetLink Peripheral which was developed by Sega and Catapult.

All rights reserved. fire up the grill and throw anofher bunch of tidbits on the rack — we're cookin' up some tasty gossip for those hot summer cook outs ahead! f ho knows hardware better than Sega? I mean, the discarded 32Xs and Sega CDs alone could fill a small third-world country, and now we’ve heard a rumor that Sega is working on another hardware gadget with PC rator Card manufacturer 3DFX. little is known about the new hard- i, it’s rumored that it may go •to-head with M2, or work exclusively s a PC Card. Sega is also reported to t ng on an attachment that will turn 32-bit Saturn into a 64-bit monster, the Saturn add-on is rumored to increase the processing speed of the machine. Matshushita is still in a holding tern on M2. Some developers claim ve seen ‘absolutely nothing’ from Bits •fid »» ews that Japan will see the fabled 64DD opti- cal disk-drive late this year has just flown 1* across the Gossip Desk. While many develop- ers claim that the $200 price tag is too expensive for the average gamer, they admit that the drive is ‘essential for playing the really cool games’, espe- cially RPGs. The first ‘really cool game’? Zelda: The Legend of Link! • In other Nintendo 64 gossip, look for Kid Icarus and Metroid to make appearances on the N64. While these titles have been talked about in previous installments of the gossip section, it has been confirmed that both will come to the N64 before Spring of ‘97. Also look for several third-party N64 games, such as Capcom’s Street Fighter Alpha Arcade and Kemco’s Top Gear. • Remember the early screens of WaveFtace that came out of the Shoshinkai show late last year? They showed F-Zero- looking race boats instead of the jet skis that the game now features. Well, since those first pictures were published, a N64 version of F-Zero has been in development over that same graphics engine. The version of WaveFlace that was shown at is an entirely new game. • Finally, Microsoft is rumored to be talking with Nintendo about bringing its current PC line-up to the N64 in some form, however, no titles have been confirmed by either party. Not to be out- done by the PC giant, Nintendo is also researching the PC marketplace, as one insider commented, ‘we’ve got many great licenses and game concepts that would easily translate to the PC platform — and the machines aren’t going away.’ Hmmm... A rumored PlayStation handheld is said to be in development. The unit, should it come out in the US, looks like it will suffer a fairly hefty price tag, somewhere to the tune of $400. • Square is cun?' rently working on two Saturn-exclusive titles, and one is rumored to be a new Secret of Maria RPG. Square is also supposedly opening a marketing division near Square LA to help maintain publishing control over its ; PlayStation line-up. Apparently, games like Final Fantasy VII were in jeop- ardy of not coming to the states if this didn’t happen. • Boss Games is rumored to be developing a Nintendo 64 title, an eye-popping SGI derno shows rally cars barreling over jungle-like terrain. Look for a well known Nintendo-only third party to bring the game home (maybe as Kemco’s Top Gear? Hmm...) • Of the 250 products currently in development by .Sony and third parties for the PlayStation, only 1 00 games will hit store shelves by Christmas. Take, for example, a game like Tomb Raider, to which Sony says ‘we have ten games just like this’, so as an incentive to Sony oot to drop the title, the Saturp version of Tomb RaidehS rumored to have been cancelled. * Cool PlayStation games to look for the first half of ‘97: War Gods, Resident Evil 2 and Soul Edge. All these games are looking great from early devel- opment previews. • Management shake-ups at T»HQ and Crystal Dynamics are still rumored, as both companies are restruc- turing from bad losses. Crystal Dynamics was supposed to go public, but apparently lacks the capital to do so. One rumor suggests that the company will leave publishing behind and simply develop. On an larger note, could Acclaim be buying Psygnosis? (Let’s all say it together) Hmmm... Over on the other side of the world, Japanese developers are finding the Nintendo 64 to be just as cryptic and confusing as we had reported, ‘if it uses a 3D engine, add anywhere from 6 to 1 2 more months (of development time)’ claims one Japanese product manager at a well-known Nintendo 64 third party. Aggravated developers are hoping Nintendo will offer more technical support, something that currently doesn’t hap- pen. • Finally, longtime Nintendo-loyal third party Kemco is rumored to be talking with Sony about bringing a game or two to the PlayStation, but nothing has been confirmed. • Join us back here in thirty days when Bill will say, ‘I needed that strategy Yesterday -4- now beat that game or you’re fired!’ 18 GAME PLAYERS September 1 996 SO LONG, ^x. f Kies! this ah Ma sob \\ MONKeY, SIGNING OUT!

H In m 24 GAME PLAYERS September 1 996 ' SeDtember 1996 COMING SOON previews With each new boss offering a different chal- lenge, there is plenty to be excited about when finishing a level. I nee upon a time, there was a battle between two com- parable videogame systems. Those sys- tems were Nintendo’s Super Nintendo and Sega’s Genesis. All looked lost for the Genesis, with stiff com petition from games like Mario and the like, but then came a little blue hedgehog named Sonic and suddenly the Genesis and, indeed, on opposite ends of the world, who both share the same dream. In the dream, each character can assume the role of Nights, a magical flying character with all sorts of special abilities. As Nights, you’ll have to recover special gems to advance through the game and get the opportunity to battle the boss characters. The entire game carries a very dream-like atmosphere, wherein all sorts of bizarre characters and landscapes begin to seem common- place after a while. As Claris or Elliot, you are bound to the ground, a fully 3D environ- ment which can be * explored in its 1 entirety. The only up and returning you to the real world. The key there- fore is to maintain your role as Nights for as long as possible. Nights is without question an action/adventure game like Sonic in several ways, but there are many differences as well. First of all, Sonic never looked this Since the game is such a new experience for gamers, each character's first level is set up to be an easy place to get the hang of the gameplay. Sega on the whole, was « back in the race in a very ' big way. The man that created this not-so-small miracle was named Yuji Naka and now, five years later, Naka is set to do it k for us all over again with L a little game known as Nights. In Nights, you i have your choice of playing as \\ either Claris jl * ■ or Elliot, Bp V \", .. two children problem is that, on me * W ground, you « are being '' Y pursued by a flying alarm clock bent on waking you 3 - xto <s . Special effects like the warping ground textures, are just Perhaps the greatest thing about Nights is that the game never lets you forget that you're playing inside a the kind of touches that put this game over the top. dream-world. And oh, is it dreamy in here. good and, though there is a 3D Sonic title currently in the works, Naka’s little blue hedgehog never knew 3D like Nights, either. Finally, it’s important to note that Sonic never flew like Nights, who spends all of his time soaring through the air with the greatest of ease (I’ve always wanted to use that saying.) These, however, are only the obvious differences. It’s the details in the gameplay that make this game really stand on its own. What’s perhaps even more important to note, however, are the similarities between Naka’s two greatest creations. One, both games are extremely fast (Sonic may actually get the nod in pure speed, but Nights is no slouch) and demonstrate everything that is great about videogame control. In fact, the control is so precise in Nights, Naka demanded a custom analog controller to be bundled with the game (the controller is completely awesome as well, but that’s another story). You’ll also see cutting-edge graphics, first-rate play mechanics and tons of action-gaming fun in Nights, just as in the original Sonic. When it comes down to it, if you don’t already own a Saturn, Nights is a damn good reason to rush out and pick one up. previews COMING SOON In an effort to offer even more variety of gameplay, the perspective changes, on occasion, from the traditional side-view to overhead. The underwater scenes, are yet again, another vanation on the typical gameplay, not to mention just plain beautiful. With true 3D environ- V* merits and dazzling visual \\ effects. Nights is sure to \\ - impress even the most > stubborn Doubting Thomas. The level design Is nothing short of first-rate, but what else would you expect from the creator of the game that revolutionized the art of level design. wM Boss levels such as this one simply defy explanation, but to play it is to love it September 1996 GAME PLAYERS 25 COMING SOON previews High-speed battles are the new name of the game! Simply adding the ability to leave the ground has added a whole new dynamic to the gameplay. No, these screen shots are not upside down, but you are! Making your way through the pack won't be easy, but it sure is fun! T here were a few key games that, from the beginning, made the PlayStation the success it is today. One of those games was undoubtedly Destruction Derby, from Psygnosis. With its ultra-realistic graphics, physics, and reckless game- play, a smashing good time could be had by all. This year marks the return of the Destruction Derby name to the PlayStation and, in true second generation fashion, this game is bigger and better than the original. So much so, in fact, that you might immediately w' *j*I The realism of the graphics has damn near gotten out of control in Destruction Derby2. Psygnosis for PlayStation If it's crashes you want, it's crashes you $ shall get! not even recognize this game as a sequel. Adding what seems to be the final piece of the real physics puzzle, Destruction Derby 2 allows the cars to actually leave the ground this time, which inevitably leads to plenty of flipping and rolling. Though the origi- nal had plenty of bone-crushing action, it was impossible to actually force a car off the ground, a feature which makes a big difference in the sequel. Beyond the extra crash physics, Destruction Derby 2 also takes huge strides in realism when it comes to the game's graphics. It was hard to imagine the look getting much more realistic than the original, but they’ve done it, and in a dramatic fashion. There is also a notice- able improvement in the game's with more of a focus on racing. The tracks have also been made much bigger and with more variation than the original. Again, this is to shift the focus away from the bottle-necked pile-ups of the original and more towards fast-action racing. Of course, there is still plenty of crashing and the results are even more exciting at high speeds. Look for this to be one of the top PlayStation games of the year! jm uua Get some air!

Fighting Vipers for the Saturn is a game to get excited about. R eason enough to by a Saturn? Only if you have any sense in you at all. While we've not actually seen the Saturn version of Fighting Vipers up-and-running just yet, these early screen shots are enough to rfM suggest that AM2 has done it again! Saturn owners are about to be treated to , ' yet another awesome translation of yet another awesome arcade game. For any- one not yet familiar with Fighting Vipers, the gameplay is pretty similar to that in Virtua Fighter 2 but with brand new characters and a few very important gameplay dif- ferences. The addition of walls surrounding the arena is, by far, the biggest difference. At first, you may have fun just by slamming people into the walls, but you’ll soon find out that’s only the beginning. Soon you’ll be juggling opponents off the wall, dragging their faces against the wall, or even climbing on top to set up a giant body slam in the center of theming. Also added to the traditional Virtua Fighter gameplay mix is the use of protective armor. Through the use of special armor-breaking moves, you can knock the armor right off your opponent, piece by piece, making them more vulnerable to your attacks. If you do manage to break your opponent’s armor in the first round of a fight, he/she will have to fight the sec- ond round without it.

Many of the levels have a surreal futuristic dark look, and check out the infrared sight on that massive gun. A ' \\ \\ fir \\ 4 - Hi ~P [y/ P sygnosis products led the way in the first generation of PlayStation titles and at they were the only company that really showed off some true second generation PlayStation titles. Tenka is definitely one of those titles. Just by looking at the screen shots you’re likely to say, ‘Whoo-hoo, another Doom- clone!’, but be warned that Tenka is much much ' more than another drone. Instead, Psygnosis has taken the 3D shooter and added touches that couldn't have been developed on the PC. The sharp texture-mapped polygons are a huge improvement from the flat enemies in Doom. The dark corridors are brilliantly designed, with some amazing light-sourcing around every corridor. Even the gun and hand are affected by the light-sourc- _ ing, which makes that element look not so pasted-on. Another area where Tenka takes the genre to a new level is in the true 3D environment Instead of blindly blowing away guys upstairs, you have to hunt them X down with your infrared sight and blast away. The infrared sight is definitely a \\ nice touch — it allows you to know exactly where you’re aiming without \\ detracting from the realism of the game. You can duck, jump, run, strafe, and 1 look all around. And the key isn’t just that you can perform these 3D ele- I ments, it’s that the developers have made sure that you have to use them in 1 order to play the game. With floors that slope upwards and enemies up in J the cat walks, Tenka promises to be an exhilarating 3D experience. / The version we played didn’t have many enemies in place yet, lta ‘ but the ones that were there had tricky Al and a real 3D look.

Three Dirty Dwarves allows a certain amount of 3D freedom of movement. y ' .-a :••••; '•tw* 8 . *’ — <1 ailing into the category of ‘more than meets the eye’, I , SegaSoft’s Three Dirty Dwarves is looking to be a bizarre little I release for the Saturn. Primarily a side-scrolling action game with 3D depth of play, the game is peppered by unique little bonus-type rounds, adding a good bit of variety to the action. Essentially the game is done in Final Fight style, as you battle your way through various different levels and enemies. What’s immediately different about this title, however, is the fact that, instead of controlling just one character, you’re actually in charge of a team of three, hence the name. Each character has different skills and weapons and therefore a big part of the challenge is to n. use the right character for the right situation. In the end, the charm of this game is in the attitude and animation. With all the irreverence possible in a side-scrolling action game, ThreeDirty Dwarves is an interesting F game, to say the least. Though most of the game is side-scrolling action gaming, there are quite a few bonus-type rounds to keep the variety level high. Virtue Cop 2- Sega for Saturn With even more detailed graphics than the original, Virtua Cop 2 is sure to be anolher huge hit for Sega this year.

All the great gameplay ele- rnents of the original Virtua^ Cop are back, as well as some hot new sequences like high-speed car chases and subway hostage situations.

J-f.sU H Hst* II Seta for Nintendo 64 hough the waiting con tinues in the US for great RPGs on the PlayStation, the situation is significantly different in Japan, where great-looking games like Popolo Crois are being developed at an alarming rate. What is strange about the 32-bit RPG movement in Japan is the fact that most of the titles in development are sticking pretty close to the traditional RPG strategy and design. Though Americans as a whole may never understand Japan’s fascination with Super-Deformed characters doing battle with giant dragons and the like, there is little doubt that when it comes to crafting a masterful adventure, the Japanese well is very deep, indeed. Considering this history, the success of Popolo Crois will not depend so much on technical prowess, but rather on good solid story-telling fundamentals. — As far as the graphics go, this one actually seems to skew a little young even by Japanese standards.

September 1996 GAME PLAYERS 37 r m o often when considering Capcom’s future, one finds oneself asking the ques- tion 'when?' When will Capcom develop in 3D, when will Capcom make a fighting game in 3D, when will Capcom make Street Fighter in 3D? When will Sakura turn 1 8? Star Gladiators is the answer to each of these queries. Well, almost. The newest arcade fighter from one of the leaders of cult fighting is a strong first entry into the 3D fighting arena, employing everything from freaky characters, attacks and defense in 3D, aerial moves, killer chain combos, and special throws. Capcom’s developers have approached the world of three dimensions with interesting care and intu- itive design, and the attention to detail shows up best in the game’s interface, its strategic fighting design, and in the peculiar moves with which each character is saddled. Rather than plumb the depths of history, as did Namco with its phenomenal weapon-based beat-’em-up Soul Edge, Capcom plunged into a science fiction-influenced future, where the single agent, Plasma, will determine the fate of the earth. In the year 2348, humans and aliens cohabit and emigrate from planet to planet. Edward Bilstein, a Nobel-winning physicist, discovers humanity's 'sixth sense' (the nebulous Plasma), and discovers how to use it as an energy source for his own pur- poses. Bilstein, in short, becomes mad with power and means to take over Earth. The blue planet’s reigning Federation finds a rag-tag group of plasma-fighters, former Bilstein followers, to battle the loony plasma putz for dominance of Earth. Sound kinda like Saturday morning cartoons? Let’s not answer that one. As with ail Capcom games, the designers have created wonderful, likable, anime-styled char- acters for Star Gladiators. These stylish polygonal, texture-mapped fighters range from June, who looks like a fashion model of the future, to Vector, a robotic arsenal; Zelkin, a birdlike humanoid; Saturn, a Cool Pop-green, cone-headed alien; Gamof, a massive panda; Hayato, a modern sword fighter; Rimgal, a raptor with a mean bite; and Gore, a brainy looking chemist who’s the only character in the game who’s able to grow 1 0 times his original size. Unlike Midway’s bizarre War Gods, which enables many of its characters to have large range of very similar special moves, Gladiators provides more individual- ity in the moves of each fighter, lending the game a solid sense of depth and playability. Besides his ability to grow, Gore spurts sleepy bubbles and paralyzing mist out of his hand gun. Both munitions take full advantage of PlayStation’s library of special effects. Zelkin can fly, and enjoys one of the game’s better special moves, an aerial slam which takes full advantage of the active panning camera, as he is shown shooting into the blue sky with his assailant (shown from ground level), and then plunging down to crush his opponent’s head into the ground. Gamof sports a sweet 'home run' move, in which he picks up the opponent and then uppercuts him like he was hitting a grand slam; and Saturn, the silliest of all the group by far, is - armed with a gratuitous Michael Jackson moon walk dance move.and extremely large, sharp yo-yos, which can be brutal. feature ARCADE June and Gerelt meet in the battle of plasma. June is super quick and agile, and her 0-ring, while initially appearing to be a silly little weapon, wreaks certain havoc on her enemies. Her flip kick is also quick, surprising and lethal. Building on the large array of 2D fighters in its illustrious past, Capcom equipped Gladiators with a linking feature that takes advantage of learning var- ious combinations, which, if executed correctly, lead to a six-move Plasma Combo, far more pow- erful than any single move. A meter in the screen’s right-hand corner actually shows the linking in effect when the correct moves are made, so they can be memorized. In addition, when done correctly in the chain, these moves are A different then they would be if just exe- ■ cuted by themselves, adding more B moves to the list. And, as if to change Saturn, the cone-headed alien in green, is one of our favorite characters, and surely is the most annoying to his opponents. Saturn, here, walks the dog. His double yo-yos can stretch out to extreme lengths, and when one of his special moves is engaged, he flips on his head and the yo-yos cover about half of the arena. As Geratfs attacks whollop Saturn, beautiful crackling beams of light fly forth. things around for the typical Street Fighter fan, this title challenges players with four buttons, instead of the Capcom's standard six. Defense in 3D works extremely intuitively and enables gamers to see that playing in 3D doesn’t necessarily mean more buttons. Hold Guard and tap once left or right and your fighter will move into or out of the arena’s depth. This may be the best use of a defensive move in 3D we’ve seen yet, due its sheer ease of use. Extra cool features also include energizing moves like Plasma Revenge and Plasma Reflect. Plasma Revenge is a single move, built-in counter. Plasma Reflect also is used when defending, but instead of being a built-in counter, this move will blow open your opponent’s offense and will enable a chain combo to be built directly after. This is Capcom’s second game (the first was the relatively lame PlayStation-to-arcade port Battle Arena Toshinden) to hit the arcades using the PlayStation-compatible arcade board, which is equivalent to Namco’s System 1 1 . This not only means that Gladiators will come to PlayStation, but it guarantees that the look and feel of the game will resemble other PlayStation fighters, like Soul Edge. This isn’t to say that any of these games are alike, it just means that despite their individual differ- ences, there is a certain look that’s recognizably similar in each, like slight button delay, the ability to portray elaborate costume and character design, special effects, and texture-map shapes. All in all, this new coin-op indulges gamers who love skill-based fighters and will whet the appetites of those who are prone to move memo- rization. Either way, Capcom’s Star Gladiators is an excellent direction for the company’s future line of fighters. Gamaf isn't Ihe fastest panda around, but he's got a nice little plasma axe, which does the trick almost every time. Gamof may have been a baseball player in his previous life, because in this life, he's got a serious batting average. Will they let players use axes instead of bats in the future? \\< X September 1996 GAME PLAYERS 39 ARCADE feature ■ Gerelt spears his opponents, and isn't afraid to use other bizarre special moves.

Height: 6’9” Pro: Orlando Magic Position: Point Guard Nickname: Penny Height: 7’0” Pro: Houston Rockets Position: Center Nickname: Hakeem The Dream Height: 67” Pro: Chicago Bulls Position: Small Forward Nickname: Pip Penny teamed up with Shaq to lead the young Orlando Magic to two spectacular seasons in a row. Unfortunately, both seasons ended with a sweep of the Magic. Penny should be confident that the same fate doesn’t await him in the Olympics. It is still uncertain whether HI’ Penny is going to make the trip to Atlanta, but if Nike has anything to say about it, you can bet Lil’ Penny is going to be up to his usual antics. Penny’s silky smooth play is sure to open the eyes of all the international teams. There aren ’t many players in the NBA who are better at the clutch shot. Height: 7’2” Pro: Orlando Magic Position: Center Nickname: Shaq (or Shaq-Fu, for us video game fans) Born in Nigeria, Hakeem has found a home in the US and a spot on the world’s greatest basketball team. His quick feet, patented fade-away, and shot-blocking skills helped lead his Houston Rockets to consecutive NBA Titles and strike fear into the rest of the world. Hakeem also offered to buy everyone’s lunch in a Visa add, when he was supposed to say, ‘We’re going to eat you for lunch’. For the first time since Hakeem was five years old, he might have trouble finding playing time with the likes of Shaq and David Robinson both vying for time in the middle. The other half of the Dynamic Duo in Chicago, Scottie Pippen is one of the best overall players in the world. The strange thing is he’s not even the best player on the Bulls, thanks to Michael. On the Dream Team, he gets a chance to escape Jordan 's shadow and show the world what a talent he is. At 67”, he handles the ball like a point guard, plays tenacious D, and rebounds with the best power for- wards. Scottie Pippen is the second member of the dream team to appear in game players. We consider him part of the team, but in the final seconds we’re giving the ball to Slate. The center of attention wherever he goes, the 7-foot+ behemoth makes other large humans look like kids. Watching him bounce around other centers with ease is just plain fright- ening. When it comes to international competition, there isn’t a team around that can match up with Shaq’s pure power. Although no one would ever say Shaq had great touch, he still manages to dunk down near 30 points a night. Perhaps the highlight ofShaq's non-basketball career were his scin- tillating reviews of Urban Strike, NBA Live ‘95, and Super Street Fighter for GAME PLAYERS. Penny looking smooth in his Dream Team iersey and looking to get the ball to Shaq — something he's used to doing. Hakeem working it in the low post, no one can defend that.

Shaq playing large in Dream Team Basketball. Take it to the hole, big fella!'. Well, if this team were allowed to compete in the best-team-ever debates, the Chicago Bulls, 72 wins and all, wouldn’t even be mentioned in the same sentence. This team has size, speed, depth, and more combined income that most countries in the world. Dream Team Basketball manages to get each and every one of these superstars in the game, complete with their real faces and signature moves. The multi-million dollar team has combined for more dunks than the rest of the international teams com- bined. September 1996 GAME PLAYERS 47 feature DREAM TEAM DREAM TEAM feature Height: 67” Pro: Detroit Pistons Position: Small Forward Nickname: The Hill Public Relations dream Grant Hill combines spectacular leap- ing ability with a winning smile and the right thing to say. He may not be the next Jordan tal- ent-wise, but he is definitely the next Jordan PR-wise. When it comes to the international com- petition, Grant Hill is certain to be the perfect ambassador for the US and should provide plenty of high-flying highlight material. Rumor has it that the Sprite-drinking team from Canada is already trash-talking the mild-mannered hoops star with taunts like, ‘You’re in my world now Hill, eh’. We all know what happened to the last per- son that said that. Height: 6’8” Pro: Utah Jazz Position: PowerForward Height: 67” Pro: Indiana Pacers Nickname: The Mailman Height: 7’0” Pro: San Antonio Spurs Position: Center Position: Shooting Guard Nickname: Captain Clutch Nickname: The Admiral In the playoffs, the mail didn’t show up on Sunday, so the Jazz lost their opportunity to be Bull- whipped. Come Olympic time, rest assured, the Mailman is going to show up. Malone’s pow- erful upper body and classic knowledge of the game make him a throwback to the era of Dream Team I. The young players today just don ’t have the same type of attitude and work ethic that play- ers like Stockton, Malone, Barkley, and Jordan show up with every day. Malone is sure to inspire the rest of the squad with his pure hunger. Hill getting airborne in Dream Team Basketball. If he was wearing FILA's, that would be detail. Reggie’s pure shooting stroke and three-point bombs have been the key to the Pacers’ strong showing the last few years. His show- downs with Spike Lee in New York have provided more enter- tainment than any of the playoff series this year. On the Dream Team, Reggie will thrive from the shorter three-point line and is sure to be a key deterrent to dou- bting down on the big centers. In the video game, spotting up Reggie at the three-point line is the easiest way to rout. The Mailman delivers another rebound for the Dream Team and then puts it back up for two. The most versatile big man in the NBA, David Robinson combines strength, speed, and agility that men his size shouldn ’t be capable of. His intense defense, smooth jumping, and powerful post-up moves just mean trouble for the rest of the world, especially because he isn’t even a starter. He’s already played for the Navy, now he has a chance to play for the US and show the rest of the world why basketball is our sport. Reggie for the three! Cha-ching! The court isn't big enough when you've got a shooter with Reggie's range. 48 GAME PLAYERS September 1 996 With power moves like The Admiral has, you can expect him to get to the free throw line on a regular basis, but if he isn't fouled then how can he be stopped. For a real challenge you can try to take on the Dream Team with some of the international scrubs, but the only way to win that contest is with some serious cheat codes. 'e Height: 6’8” Pro: Milwaukee Bucks Position: Small Forward Nickname: Big Dog Big Dog is one of the best young talents in the league, but wallow- ing in Milwaukee’s talentless organization has done nothing for his game. A chance to play with some real talent is sure to bring Big Dog’s game to a new level. Many people feel that this slot on the team should’ve gone to Shawn Kemp, but our bet is that Big Dog is going to show every- body he deserved this shot Oops, just before press time we found out that Big Dog will miss the Olympics with an injury and The Glove’ J1 (Gary Payton) steals his spot on the roster. Height: 6T’ 1 I I Pro: Utah Jazz Position: Point Guard Nickname: (Only his wife knows for sure) His steady point guard play makes it that much easier for all the super-stars to play together as one team. There’s still a question whether he can pass to anyone besides Karl Malone, but we’re confident that won’t be a problem. Stockton’s easily the smallest, least athletic player on the team, but what he lacks in physical skills he more than makes up for with basketball smarts and a deep hunger for winning. Height: 6’6\" Pro: Phoenix Suns (so far) Position: Power Forward Nickname: Round Mound of Rebound, Sir Charles A veteran of Dream Team I, the always controversial Sir Charles Is hungry for another Olympic Gold. Last time he played in the Olympics, he welcomed a player with a patented Barkley elbow to the head. In an interview recently, he promised to bring the same intensity to Atlanta, so watch your head. Sir Charles’ unbelievable ability to intimidate and dominate have deteriorated a bit with age, but there’s not another player on this team that thrives better in the big game. Height: 6’3” Pro: 1 Sacramento Kings Position: Shooting Guard Nickname: The Rock From the desert of talent in Sacramento, to the Dream Team has to be one of the more pleas- ant developments of Mitch Ritchmond’s career. The Rock has been shooting lights out in Sacramento and Golden State to no avail in his NBA career. Now, thanks in part to Michael Jordan’s blessing, Mitch Ritchmond gets a chance to win a gold medal. His streaky outside shooting and small powerful body make him a pure scorer. The familiar shiny dome and patented smile of Sir Charles are both in the game. The short three-point line just means even a better percentage on three-pointers for one of the best in the league. Stockton isn't known as a scorer, but leave him open from the outside and hell make you pay. Big Dog with the rim racker! Zoom in dose and you can even see the players faces. More high-flying, high-scoring Dream Team action. The PlayStation version is on display and hoping to be the best hoops game yet.
