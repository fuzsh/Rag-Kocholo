        "text": "Boundless Inner World Vital statistics A.K.A Boundless Inner World Popular Users Israelite Young Man Description The Power / Ability To Have A Sentient Infinite Dimension With Infinite Power / Knowledge Dwelling In The User\n\n\"Behind me is infinite power. Before me is endless possibility. Around me is boundless opportunity. Why should I fear?\"\n\n― Stella Stuart\n\n\"Introverts are offered keys to private gardens full of riches. To possess such a key is to tumble like Alice down her rabbit hole. She didn't choose to go to Wonderland - but she made of it an adventure that was fresh and fantastic and very much her own.\"\n\n― Susan Cain\n\n- To Posses a Sentient Omnipotent Boundless Inner World / Dimension\n\nAlso Called[]\n\nOmnipotent Inner World\n\nAlmighty Inner World\n\nMonotheistic Dimension/Universe/Multiverse/Omniverse\n\nCapabilities[]\n\nUser possesses a personal, infinite dimension within themselves in which dwells limitless knowledge and power; usually personified by an inner alter ego. As an extension of the user's soul, this being is completely and irrevocably bound to the user, making it impossible to remove. The inner being, having the user's best interest at heart, protects them against any threat and empowers them to achieve their goals.\n\nAny Physical damage is answered with instant recovery, and unfettered empowerment. Harmful external forces that invoke or engage in entry are expelled and denied, while mental intruders will learn the meaning of Hell within the user's boundless inner world's void. Boundless Inner World is basically the ability to have a dimension, with actual physical properties and all, inside you (or to be more specific, in your mind, spirit, soul, whatever).\n\nYou have full control over this dimension create anything (the only limit being your imagination), you can enter it in any time (usually requires some specific action like meditation / Command / Ritual etc... ) and at highest levels, you can brings things out or in that dimension. Time, space, physics, etc.. can also flow/work differently in those dimensions. Boundless inner world It's a inner dimension where you are god, your imagination, dreams are this world. It's like reality which is listening your commands but coming from another dimension where you are making the rules. the Inner World as more or less of a resource (infinite power and knowledge to draw upon at your command) than a literal world, but it's true all these possibilities would likely take shape within you, reflecting your thoughts, ideas and emotions, ad thus constantly changing with them. the idea of boundless Inner World inside of you with that Omnipotent power give the user the felling of safety from any harm and the sheer versatile of this power make him pass up all other almighty powers as most almighty powers are specialized while BIW is not really specialized on specific domain.\n\nI always interpreted it as boundless/limitless Inner World inside the user with avatar that Omnipotence in power the world and its avatar are extension of the user somehow. The user can leverage the limitless resources (power and knowledge) of this BIW and apply them however he will, the user safe from any harm both inside and outside, with inside he is protected (kinda the most precious thing way), while outside if he ever attacked by potent entity he will resurrect in his BIW. of personal depth and limitless wonders That is the particularly safe, flexible and user-friendly nature of the power. The ability is One that breathes a sense of wonder into our life, and keeps us awake at night marveling about their possibilities, how we would shape them, and how they would shape us.\n\nTo compose a state in which one possesses a personal totality / The Box within oneself in which dwells limitless knowledge and power, usually personified by an inner alter-ego. As an extension of one's psyche, this being is the user because the inner world is the user and the user is it and its soul-bound to the possessor completely making it impossible to remove, having the host's best interest at heart, protecting them against any threat and lending them all the power needed to achieve their goals. Physical threats are answered with instant recovery and massive empowerment, while mental intruders will learn the meaning of Hell.\n\nWith this ability one possesses a vast / Infinite and beyond amount of information and knowledge on all things, having an inherent encyclopedic grasp of history, literature, magic, mechanics and technology, psionics, psychic phenomena, science, the universe et al. All information, whether natural or supernatural, can-and-is innately fully understood without the need for study or experience.\n\nIn this state the possessor is fully capable of creating inner worlds which are already created within their own minds and souls of the main boundless inner world, able to adapt these worlds / the outer world ( Our Real World Reality ) in any-and-all ways they desire -- controlling gravity, reality, space, time, weather, etc. Usually there is a nexus or matrix within these worlds to stabilize it within the inner reality, this nexus or matrix is usually also the sentient aspect of the inner world. Some may be able to bring not only themselves but others into their inner worlds; while, the most powerful, are fully capable of manifesting any-and-all aspects of their Boundless Inner World into \"outer\" ( Our Real World Reality ) Reality; replacing, displacing, or subsuming the normal Tapestry and Verse.\n\nThe Boundless Inner World(s) is usually concentrated into a sentience, an inner alter-ego, that acts as a majordomo of the specific world, or even all worlds. Through this concentration the possessor is able to forge greater power, competence and understanding of themselves and their unbridled power.\n\nWithin the inner world(s) the possessor is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent; and, which they can bring into the outer world which for those that can forge the inner power as outer manifestation, the scope becomes just as puissant -- able to alter and adapt the Tapestry and Verse absolutely, with even inconceivable or vague whims automatically calibrated to the intent of the possessor despite any inherent limitations. Note that in most cases, the act of manifesting as an \"outer\" reality is an act of will; however, in grave cases or on command / thought the power can / may be a source of the subconscious or unconscious mind which makes this aspect an atrocity against Creation but positive / pro for the user if the user can control it\n\nThe User can / will have endless of infinity of Boundless Inner World inside the main Boundless Inner World which no two are alike all are extremely different from the other in any and all aspects. The Inner World(s) is basically the user personal genie waiting for the user next wish / desire to come to his mind so it can fulfil it. The inner world also directly speaks to the user to give the user answers / wisdom / council when needed or wanted by the user . The User never needs to say what his needs / wants are ( unless the user want's to ) because the inner world already knows what the user want's / truly want's and needs . The Inner world also acts as a Consultant / Designer / Forger / Master Craftsmen / The Supreme Architect / Absolute Artisan / Supreme Creator for the user desires / wishes making more fruitful and beyond amazing / words than what the user first initially wanted basically going beyond the user desires / what the user thinks .\n\nThe Boundless Inner World also has a Omnipotent Male Guardian basically The Biblical God of The Holy Bible / God of The Covenant which is The True GodThis Being is also soul bound to the user and acts as a right hand man to the Boundless Inner World . The Guardian is like what the boundless inner world is their as personal genie but also a Consultant / Designer / Forger / Master Craftsmen / The Supreme Architect / Absolute Artisan / Creator . But also give godly wisdom / knowledge to the user when needed / wanted by the user.\n\nCurtsey of / Also Included\n\nBoundless Inner World\n\nBoundless Inner World : Fantasy Wikia\n\nBoundless Inner World\n\nExamples\n\nWe Are Venom Scene - Ending Scene - Venom (2018) Movie Clip HD\n\nNotes[]\n\nConversations I had with hoho at my job at Home Depot .
