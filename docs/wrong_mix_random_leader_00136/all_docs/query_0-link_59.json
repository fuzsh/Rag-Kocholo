        "text": "Local ‘foodie’ fans went into a feeding frenzy last week (pun intended) at the news that Anthony Bourdain, the world-renowned chef, author, and television personality, was in Trinidad. An image posted on his Instagram account included a tantalising caption regarding his location: What did they say about Nixon? “Tanned, rested and ready.” #Trinidad. Though at the time there was no official word as to the details of the visit, the hopeful speculation was that he would be filming an upcoming episode of the CNN programme ‘Parts Unknown’.\n\nA former New York chef, Bourdain rose to prominence with the publication of his best-selling book in 2000 titled ‘Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly’. His honest narrative and critique of the industry earned him the reputation of being America’s culinary ‘bad boy’, rejecting the clean cut convention of refinement and class, and instead embracing a persona that makes liberal use of cigarettes, sexual innuendos, and profanity. Since leaving his professional kitchen-based duties, he has hosted a slew of television shows, all of which combined the experiences of travel, socialising, and dining. Most notable was the Travel Channel’s ‘No Reservations’, which aired for nine seasons from 2005 to 2012, and received accolades for both informational programming and cinematography. It’s definitely worth watching, and for anyone who’s interested, I recommend the episodes on Japan (season 2, episode 1), Turkey (s6, E1), and Lebanon (s2, e24). (Note: The Lebanon episode is unique because the regular format was aborted due to the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War, and was instead presented as a pseudo-documentary).\n\nSo having seen much of what the world has to offer, Mr Bourdain has finally made his way to our shores. And considering that he’s no stranger to the region, it’s about damn time he did. That being said, it’s important to mention that this CNN special won’t be the first time in recent memory that we’ve received such mainstream exposure. The 1999 Miss Universe Pageant was held right here, and was attended by the franchise owner and soon to be US President, Donald J Trump. We’ve also had appearances on an assortment of American television shows: Bizarre Foods (Travel Channel, 2007), Ghost Hunters International (SyFy Channel, 2011), and House Hunters International (HGTV, 2012). But Mr Bourdain’s visit comes at an auspicious moment for T&T. The recent decline in petroleum earnings is being heralded as the start of a concerted effort to diversify our economy. So, once again, the focus is shifting to the old ‘standby’ of tourism.\n\nWhen compared to the petrochemical industry, tourism is often treated like the proverbial forgotten child—mostly left to fend for themselves and only getting attention when they do something worthwhile. That’s not to say that Trinbagonians aren’t proud of their country and culture, or willing to share those things with the world at large. I suspect that we are secretly pleased with not having to entertain foreigners with the ‘happy islander’ routine, where everything is ‘irie’ and our vernacular is reduced to the euphemistic ‘yeah mon’. The downside, however, is that we’ve suffered from a reputation deficit; the international community may know ‘who’ and ‘where’ we are, but they do not know ‘what’ we are all about. They can’t be blamed for thinking that we are just another rock in the Caribbean; so why should they come when there are other more well-known destinations. Just peruse the channels on cable television at any time of day, you’re sure to come across a slew of advertisements encouraging visits to Jamaica and the Bahamas. It’s no wonder that even the spying exploits of the fictional James Bond took place in those exotics locales.\n\nThe citizenry has long accepted that our little corner of paradise does not fit the traditional vacation idea of surf, sun, and sandy beaches. Yes, we have those things, but there is so much more that makes T&T wonderful in its uniqueness. And to use the word ‘diverse’ as a descriptive, though appropriate, would also be an understatement. Not only does it apply to our ethnicities, religions, festivals, and food, but the varying lifestyles, sceneries, architecture, and art forms as well; things that make us a truly cosmopolitan society. We don’t have to solely and continually rely on touting Carnival as ‘the greatest show on earth’ or the claim of being the birthplace of the steelpan; this is an opportunity to pioneer our own brand of tourism, where anyone can come to know the pleasures of what it is to be Trinbagonian.\n\nCoincidentally, last Sunday’s episode of ‘Parts Unknown’ (a repeat) featured Mr Bourdain in Jamaica, a place he previously visited during the run of ‘No Reservations’. I have to admit that watching only served to heighten my eagerness for what his impression of our country turns out to be. It’s impossible for him to ‘taste’ all that we have to offer in the short time that he’s here. But I trust his exploration will produce a fair and balanced view. One that hopefully stirs the curiosity of others to visit T&T, thus making it a little less unknown.\n\nRyan Hadeed\n\nThe recently announced Cemex bid for majority control of TCL and the revised enhanced offer published on January 10, must be seen as the last best option for the beleaguered regional cement business—despite a virtual monopoly in major CARICOM markets—which was run into bankruptcy.\n\nBy 2014 TCL recorded its second loan default, accumulated a crushing debt north of US$ 300 million, was in desperate need of plant upgrades, and used price increases to cover rising production costs resulting from the curtailment of maintenance programmes.\n\nNot surprisingly, after an extensive international ‘crusade’ to raise capital, senior executives returned empty handed.\n\nApparently, TCL’s swelling losses, rising costs, and over leveraged balance sheet failed to impress investors.\n\nLocally, frustration and lack of confidence in TCL’s management prompted shareholders with no prospects of future dividends and risk of losing their investments to resort to their only ‘option’.\n\nIn August 2014, a significant shareholder group removed TCL’s CEO also making a series of changes within the management and board.\n\nThe ‘new’ team reportedly implemented a plan to restructure the group’s withering debt burden and crippling collective agreements to attempt to rescue this pivotal company, a key component in the construction sectors of CARICOM countries.\n\nEven though this ‘option’ successfully bought time to begin plant upgrades and comprehensive restructuring, the challenges of raising capital remained.\n\nAccording to a well-placed insider, recapitalising TCL remained a problem with a 20 per cent shareholder limit in place.\n\nAnother stakeholder cautioned: “Competitively priced exports is the only hope for TCL, our region already has two million tons of excess capacity...we can’t afford plant upgrades or technical capabilities.”\n\nIn March/April 2015, the 20 per cent ceiling which represented an impediment to further investment (that entrench bad management) was removed and a subsequent issue of new TCL shares increased the company’s capital by US$ 57 million.\n\nWhile few local shareholders participated, Cemex, the Mexican giant and third largest cement company globally, a 20 per cent stakeholder, upped its ownership to 39.5 per cent by investing around US$ 50 million.\n\nCertainly, although TCL and its operations in Trinidad, Barbados and Jamaica have a long way to go to reach the goals of profitability, competitiveness and sustainability that Chairman Espinet and his board have set, apparently performance in key operational areas and its financial situation have improved.\n\nIt is reported that Cemex has put senior management professionals from its global network into the TCL Group to, according one executive: “incorporate best practices and technologies and upgrade the capabilities of local management and work force.” This appears to be one of the major drivers influencing the turnaround of TCL.\n\nNow, 15 months after increasing its stake in TCL, Cemex is bidding for control, at a time when according to the IMF, growth scenarios are deteriorating for commodity-dependent economies.\n\nIt said: “Trinidad and Tobago is one of the most affected because it depends on fossil fuels and prices can’t seem to attain stability.”\n\nGiven that local investors didn’t take up much of the new share offering, the opportunity was there for Cemex to demonstrate confidence in T&T and TCL. Maybe it is really the ‘last best option’ for TCL!\n\nNot surprising, are the few protesters commenting on the demerits of Cemex owning the majority of TCL. They have also ‘determined’ what Cemex should pay for the privilege of rescuing this important industry employing thousands of ‘our people’ across the region from the jaws of extinction. Predictably none have highlighted that Cemex recognised the importance of maintaining local participation in this regional industry; structuring its bid to retain local ownership and TCL’s continuity in the local equity market.\n\nBy contrast, renowned international rating agency Fitch Ratings reported: “Cemex’s bid to increase its stake in TCL would be a positive rating trigger for the Trinidad-based company”, also noting, “an increase in Cemex’s current stake in TCL to 74.9 per cent could result in an upgrade of at least one notch to TCL’s ‘B-’ rating”.\n\nFor Cemex to consider this bid successful and TCL to deliver value, Cemex must achieve control at an affordable price, to accommodate additional major life-saving’ investments in T&T, Barbados and Jamaica to bring these operations to international standards and achieve global competitiveness and long term sustainability,” says another company executive.\n\nOffer now at $5.07, a 50 per cent premium—highest price in five years, payment option in $US.\n\nRecent imports of competitively priced Turkish cement represent the ‘clear and present danger’ of only looking inwards. In today’s world, a successful global partner is not constraining...it’s liberating.\n\nSince local investors have not demonstrated either the appetite or confidence to keep a regional cement industry alive and well...then perhaps Cemex is TCL’s last best option!\n\nBert Jones\n\nRecently retired executive director of PwC ASL\n\nThe Energy Chamber produced a survey which attempted to suggest to the public that the salary of Petrotrin workers is above T&T’s industry standards. However, this report does nothing more than raise several fundamental questions about how workers are viewed and treated in T&T.\n\nFirstly, the Energy Chamber needs to clarify which companies were surveyed in order to determine the ‘rest of the sector’? Did it include Atlantic LNG, BP, BG, BHP Billiton etc? If so, it would only be fair, and also interesting, for the Energy Chamber to publish the pay rates of these multinationals. In addition to not including multinationals, the survey did not include companies such as YARA.\n\nIf their survey did not include the multinationals operating in T&T, then it is flawed and cannot be said to compare Petrotrin’s wages to the ‘rest of the sector’.\n\nSecondly, the survey failed to take into consideration that Petrotrin is an integrated production and refining company, and it is the only such company in T&T.\n\nTherefore, Petrotrin cannot and should not be compared to any other industry. How can you compare refinery workers when there are no other refinery companies in T&T? The answer is simple: you cannot.\n\nTherefore, since there are no comparators in T&T, Petrotrin can only be compared to the global average.\n\nThis is not difficult for the Energy Chamber to produce as the average global salaries for oil and gas can be found in the Hay’s Oil and Gas Salary Guide 2015.\n\nAccording to the report: “Over the past 12 months, we have seen the average global permanent salary increase by 1.3 per cent from last years’ average salary of US$82,239 (TT$575,673 ).\n\nThis breaks down into a local talent average of US$71,569 (TT$500,983), and an expat talent average of US$99,013 (TT$693,091). The average contractor day rate globally in 2014 was US$540 per day (TT$3,780)”.\n\nThe Hay’s Oil and Gas Salary Guide further stated that the average annual salary for an intermediate person working in the electrical field was US$48,500/year (TT$28,300/month), and US$70,000/year (TT$ 40,800/month) at the senior level. In the mechanical area, the average annual salary at the intermediate level was US$42,600/year (TT$24,850/month), and US$62,000/year (TT$36,166/month) at the senior level.\n\nThe Oilfields Workers’ Trade Union is positive that no electrical or mechanical employee of Petrotrin earns anything close to the intermediate level, far less the senior level.\n\nTherefore, when considering the global and regional average, Petrotrin’s only comparators, the Energy Chamber’s survey should have revealed the truth: that contractor workers in the oil and gas service companies of T&T are in fact significantly underpaid.\n\nThirdly, it is unfortunate that the Energy Chamber’s survey follows the apparent trend of publishing the salary of ordinary workers, as they conveniently omitted the pay of Petrotrin executives.\n\nIt is only fair that the country also knows the executives’ salaries and not only that of Petrotrin’s cleaners (which is inaccurate). Petrotrin’s President receives TT$180,000 per month, the vice president is paid TT$120,000 per month, and senior managers receive some $64,000 per month. Not to mention the salary of the four expat managers at the refinery which accounts for TT$6 million per year. While this disparity is extreme, the situation in the private sector oil and gas service companies is indeed worse.\n\nAs a result, the wider discourse should be about how underpaid workers are in general throughout T&T rather than the propaganda being mounted against Petrotrin workers founded on inaccurate salaries and surveys.\n\nFinally, the public should not forget that the general strike and labour riots of 1937 started by oil workers in the oil fields that spread throughout the country’s working class was vociferously condemned by the colonial authorities and the business class.\n\nHowever, militant actions led to the rise of general wages throughout the economy benefiting the entire country.\n\nThe militant action of the OWTU in the 60s and 70s led by George Weekes was also condemned by the Government and business class, but those actions also led to the general increase in the standard of living for the entire working class.\n\nToday is no different, as too many labourers working for oil and gas service companies are being left behind, and the time has come once again to make things right. This is what the Energy Chambers’ survey has truly revealed.\n\nOzzi Warwick\n\nChief Education and Research Officer\n\nOilfields Workers’ Trade Union\n\nDear Editor, I have dedicated 20 years of life to the service of the Trinidad and Tobago Volleyball Federation and —by extension— to my beloved country. Now, I have decided to set aside but still support the young people who are willing and have better ideas to take sport forward.\n\nAfter examining the division within my sport, I independently decided to formally retire before the electoral process started (the election was held on Saturday). My decision was very difficult, as I have done this for so long and many of my close colleagues, were encouraging me to continue as I met with them.\n\nVolleyball in Trinidad and Tobago has been transformed in my years. When I started the sport had a few clubs and could not win a Caribbean Championship, and many persons did not even recognise the sport’s existence in our country.\n\nToday, we can put a good argument for being the number-one team sport in T&T and definitely the number-one for women. There are 220 countries that play volleyball in the world —more than FIFA— and our women are ranked 34th and reached as high as 29th in my tenure.\n\nWe are the Caribbean Champions indoor men and women. The highest ranked country in beach volleyball, with our men ranking 3rd behind USA and Canada in this continent. We won our first continental medals in beach volleyball (four to be exact). All our teams qualified for the last CAC Games beach and indoor, men and women.\n\nWe qualified for the first time in the youth Olympics and four World Championships in age group beach volleyball. We also achieved the ultimate goal of our 2020 plan in 2016 when we qualified our senior women to the World Grand Prix.\n\nAdditionally, we transformed our income streams from having Government funding being 80 per cent of our income in 2012, to it now being less than 50 per cent.\n\nWe also developed our premier league into the biggest volleyball event in Caribbean history. In our pursuit of international excellence, we did not pay much attention to our grassroots levels and of this I am disappointed.\n\nI would have discussed the future of volleyball with Deon Hutchison and Vaughn Martin and I am convinced that they will work with me to ensure that we unite volleyball. They accepted the rules that prevented Deon from being president and we all will support the new president Mrs Nicole Selvon, and encourage everyone to support our first woman president.\n\nI would still have my international responsibilities in Cazova (executive director), Norceca (beach volleyball commission member) and Fivb (technical supervisor). And, by our regulations I would be an honorary president of the TTVF. I will also be developing some business interests, which would include sport promotion. I will be dedicating more time to my substantial job at T&TEC and, most importantly, my family.\n\nIn closing I don’t believe in the politics that played out in the past months in Volleyball, it has no place in my sport and we all pledged to move forward and forget the past. We want to demonstrate to our nation leaders that the answers in moving forward are in unity.\n\nFormer president of T&T Volleyball Federation\n\nMalvern Sports Club, described as an institution of class, was founded in June 1942 at Siegert Square in Woodbrook when a group of friends and family members took the decision to formalize a loose alliance into a club for the purpose of playing competitive football.\n\nSo come June the club will, therefore, celebrate its 75th anniversary and a number of events will be held throughout the year to mark that special occasion.\n\nIts first President was renowned journalist, George John with the first executive comprising Lennox Pierre as vice president, James Grosvenor, secretary, Hamil Henley, the treasurer and John.\n\nThe club colours of wine and white and the design of the for the club jersey were the ideas of Errol John, distinguished playwright and brother of George. The club motto “Victoria Concordia Crescit” was also formalised at the inception.\n\nMalvern quickly made its presence felt on the football field and its most outstanding achievement was the defeat of the Jamaica national team in 1947.\n\nIn that very year the entire Malvern forward line of Carlton “Putty” Lewis, Carlton “Squeakie” Hinds, Fedo Blake, Phil Douglin and Lio Lynch was selected to play against the then British Guiana. Malvern’s football team also defeated Barbados in 1950 and St. Vincent in 1968.\n\nWhile the early years were the most successful, the club’s footballers under Carlton “the General”Franco, thrilled football spectators in the early sixties with an exciting brand of football dubbed the “cha cha cha” or dancing football which brought the club many trophies.\n\nIn recent years the standard of football within the club has declined but with the celebrations planned, a resurgence is expected.\n\nIn 2015 our first women’s football team was established. While not terribly successful, the team continues to improve and we do expect to have a vibrant successful team in the future.\n\nMalvern also played cricket without the same degree of success, but was promoted to the Championship Division on several occasions without being able to compete at the top level consistently. Noel Robinson was selected for national team in 1962 and Frankie Ragoonath was one of the five cricketers of the year in 1966.Subsequently, the decision was taken to stop playing cricket.\n\nThe other major sport played by the club was field hockey. Malvern men hockey team was without a doubt the most outstanding team in the 20th century, being crowned national champions for the first ten years the competition was played. This was mainly due to the inspiration and guidance of Ian Harris who also captained the national team and subsequently became a national coach.\n\nIn 1982, ten players from the club were selected for the national team to the CAC Games. The club also won two international club tournaments, the first in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1980 and in 1985 in Curacao.\n\nThe club is entering an exciting phase with the under 21 and the senior team being crowned indoor champions recently and players the Marcano brothers and the Emmanuel brothers and Lyndell Byer representing the country.\n\nThe women team has not had the same degree of success but has consistently been among the top teams and has had national representation from Michele Gordon, Margaret Hinds and Penelope Stephens in the earlier years and Sherlan Cabralis, Teresa Lezama and Kherdine Gonzales , more recently.\n\nMalvern’s members Gregory Lewis, Hypolite Sosa, Lance Pierre, Carlton Hinds, Vere Greer and Aldwyn Hislop have been inducted into the national sports Hall of Fame.\n\nMalvern will therefore, look back with pride at its first 75 years and look forward with eager anticipation towards its century celebrations in 2042.\n\nCentral FC’s unbeaten run in the Digicel Pro League this season came to a crashing halt when the two-time defending champions fell 2-0 against Ma Pau Stars at the Larry Gomes Stadium on Saturday.\n\nVeteran winger Hayden Tinto broke the deadlock after an hour of goalless play at the Malabar venue before a clinical Jerrel Britto from the penalty spot completed the victory for former Couva Sharks coach Ross Russell.\n\nFor Central, the loss is a dent to their ambition – to hoist a third successive league crown – with bitter rivals W Connection (34 points) leading by two points after defeating Defence Force 4-1 courtesy a double and an assist from Suriname international Dimitrie Apai on Friday night.\n\nIt spelt the end of Central’s permanent reign at the top of the standings since Oct. 7.\n\nCentral (32 points), though, have a rescheduled game in hand against Defence Force, while there are only four regular league games left in the truncated 2016-17 season which will conclude later this month.\n\nCentral, on 10 league wins and two draws prior to Saturday’s kick-off, had two first half scoring opportunities—the clearer of the two falling to Jason Marcano, but the midfielder fired overbar from the top of the six-yard area with goalkeeper Glenroy Samuel at his mercy.\n\nSamuel was later forced into a low save near the hour mark by Marcano before a lunging goalmouth attempt from Johan Peltier on the rebound had Central, including their coach, Dale Saunders, and assistant coach, Stern John, appealing for a goal. However, assistant referee Joseph Bertrand, the official best positioned to tell if the ball had indeed crossed the line, stood his ground.\n\nThere wasn’t any doubt, however, when Tinto smashed a low drive beyond goalkeeper Jan-Michael Williams in the 64th minute on the other end after the Central defence had allowed Shane Sandy’s cross to sneak through.\n\nCentral’s troubled worsened eight minutes from time when referee Keilon Bacchus pointed to the spot after defender Kevon Villaroel, in a desperate attempt to quell goal-bound run by Britto, upended the forward just inside area.\n\nBritto made no mistake from the spot to hit beyond Williams for the 2-0 score and his seventh league goal this term.\n\nDespite five minutes stoppage-time, and the return of speedy Tobagonian forward Rundell Winchester, who entered play on the hour mark, Central were unable to rebound from the two-goal deficit and must now focus on Tuesday, when a new slate of matches are contested.\n\nWinchester, who is back with the Sharks following his most recent stint abroad with PS Kemi Kings in Finland, was played through on goal by Darren Mitchell with a couple minutes of regular time left, but a slip in the area saw the lanky forward steer the ball wide.\n\nCentral, for the second time in as many matches this season, were unable to beat Ma Pau, led by two-time former Defence Force league-winning coach Russell, who was sacked by the Couva Sharks after less than five months into last season. Both sides played to a goalless draw last October.\n\nClub Sando, Jabloteh win\n\nNical Stephens’ 12th-minute strike provided the decisive item as Club Sando edged Courts Morvant Caledonia United 1-0 in the first game of a double-header at the Barataria Recreation Ground.\n\nLater, Jabloteh enjoyed a 3-1 win over Police thanks to a second-half brace from forward Jamal Gay, cementing the San Juan Kings position in third on the standings with 26 points, five points ahead of Ma Pau (21 points) who hurdled Defence Force by two points for fifth position. Sando (17 points) meanwhile are sixth, climbing two spots with their narrow win.\n\nNathan Lewis had given Jabloteh an early lead before Police forward Jameel Perry equalised just over the half-hour mark.\n\nBut Gay struck twice in a space of 12 minutes (53rd and 64th minutes) to win it for last season’s runners-up, Jabloteh.\n\nReece Marcano is one of a few players seeking to start the new year as champion as junior players from all over the country converged on the Central Regional Indoor Sport Arena for the start of the 2017 T&T Badminton Association Junior National Championship which served-off on Saturday.\n\nIn what is the biggest draw in the history of the tournament, players competed fiercely for spots in the semi-finals and quarterfinal rounds on the weekend.\n\nMarcano, from Shuttleforce, the No. 1 seed in the boys under-15 age group, and the nominee for the First Citizens Bank Sports Foundation’s Junior Sportsman of the Year, did not disappoint as he swept aside his opponent to register a 21-8 and 21-4 win over Adrian Visser in the second round, and will take on Reval Jagessar in the quarterfinals.\n\nOther players who have advanced to the quarterfinal round were Justin Samaroo, Caesar Edwards, Jae Marc Tagallie, Donovan David, Daniel Lewis and Zion St Rose. None of the seeded players on the girls side of the draw were in action as quarterfinal play continues on Saturday.\n\nIn the boys under-11 category, seeded players in the top half of the draw struggled as both Andrew Babwah and Tad Isaac fell to newcomers Nadav Singh and Aditya Maharaj, both of whom will meet each other in the first semi-final.\n\nSeeded players in the bottom half of the draw, however, held their nerve as No. 2 seed, Jace Smith and third/fourth seed Jamahi Mason made it safely through the draw and will clash in the second semi-finals.\n\nThree of the four semi-final births were decided in the girls Under-11 division with all of the seeded players advancing to the final four. Amara Urquhart from CBAC and Yelena Lewis from FMT will square off against each other, while T’Shelle Barnes awaits the winner of the match between Kaylee Noel and the number-two seed Nicha Fraser.\n\nIn the boys under-11 doubles, Nadav Sindh and Jamahi Mason advanced to the next round.\n\nThe number-one and two seeds in the boys under-13 singles category, Travis Sinanan and James Babwah were given byes in the first round joining Nicholi Marcano, Seth Mollah, Samuel Lewis and Tyrell La Morelle in the quarterfinals. Two matches went the distance with Asa Dass defeating Godrian Jones 14-21, 21-19, 21-12, while Kye Isaac overcame Jashaun Auguste 21-18, 17-21, 21-15 in a very competitive three-setter.\n\nOnly three matches were played in the girls under-13 single class as other players received byes to the quarterfinal round. Defending champion Danae Boodoosingh will start the defence of her title on Saturday as she meets Nicha Fraser in the quarterfinal round.\n\nThere were no surprises in the boys under-17 singles play as all seeds, led by Number one seed Vance Juteram, advanced to the next round. He is on course to meet number-two seed in the opposite side of the draw, Leon Cassie.\n\nOnly one of the seeded players in the girls side of the draw was in action on Saturday with Waynetta Thomas taking care of Maryam Mohammed, 21-10 and 21-10.\n\nShe will be joined by Sandya Cassie, Britney Lewis and Chequeda De Boulet all of whom received byes in the first round.\n\nIn the lone boys under-19 match, Jason Maloney defeated Jamie Narine 21-14 and 21-18.\n\nThe finals will be played on Saturday at the same venue.\n\nMembers of the volleyball fraternity elected its first woman president in attorney-at-law Nicole Selvon when the T&T Volleyball Federation (TTVF) held its annual general meeting (AGM) at the Central Regional Indoor Sports Complex, Chaguanas, on Saturday night.\n\nSelvon was elected unopposed after incumbent president Daymain Stewart decided not to contest after a turbulent four years in office.\n\nThe newly-elected executive board will manage the affairs of the sport until 2020 according to a mandate from 21 of the 28 clubs registered with the organisation and voted at the AGM.\n\nSelvon said she was elated and happy to serve, “Of course, I am elated not only to be the president of TTVF but to be the first female president. It certainly is an honour. This means that there is the added burden, in a positive way of course, of additional responsibility to do well for all women in sport administration. The progress or success of any sport is always dependent on the human resource capacity of those saddled with the responsibility of administrating that sport and the sportsmen and women that make up its membership.”\n\nShe added, “My focus will be on bringing a professional and transparent approach to the administration of volleyball in Trinidad and Tobago, taking into account the input of all stakeholders, remembering always that my first priority and concern would be the interest of those who play the game”.\n\nAn attorney-at-law with ten years experience both in the private and public sector she noted, “I have worked with the Ministry of Sport and Youth Affairs and also collaborated with SporTT on various initiatives. I have been involved and around the sport of volleyball for some years now. I believe that I have very good administrative skills, but more than that I have a vision for volleyball that will put the sport on the correct footing. I have on my executive persons who have been involved in volleyball at the highest levels and all areas including administration, management, coaching and marketing”.\n\nSelvon pointed out that the membership can look forward to a fresh approach to volleyball from a new perspective. Transparency, frequent consultation with the membership and all stakeholders on matters affecting volleyball, honesty in financial affairs, and a genuine interest in the advancement of volleyball in T&T.\n\nSelvon, who hails from Maracas, St Joseph said, “Very soon our executive would layout our immediate, short term and long term goals for volleyball. I expect that the success of my presidency and the success of my executive would be judged by the extent to which we execute and implement those set goals, being mindful of what we have inherited and the financial resources we are able to secure from both the public and private sector”.\n\nDeon Hutchinson, who was very vocal for change to come about in the sport and who was elected as second vice president said that, “Most people would not understand how Team Revolution changed our slate. For now the answer is: God is in control not us and, while his objective was to become president, Nicole has his full support and we intend to take volleyball to greater heights as a team.”\n\nSince 2016 both Vaughn Martin of Technocrats, a former national player and Hutchinson, the headcoach of Westside Stars club began a campaign advocating for change in the sport’s management. Hutchinson said to the fraternity following Saturday’s AGM, “Your persistence and insistence for fairness and equality, have caused a paradigm shift in volleyball in Trinidad and Tobago. Let there now be healing, unity and purpose. With such a united front like never before. Volleyball 2017 is off to a great start.”\n\nThe election which was conducted under the constitution of the FIVB, the world governing body constitution, was supervised by Cristobal Marte Hoffiz, the president of NORCECA, former T&T president Mushtaque Mohammed and the NORCECA co-ordinator Arateide Caceres Hernandez.\n\nThe executive board will also include Saleem Ali and Nolan Daniel, who will be the Tobago representative.\n\nA Trinidad rock band’s dream is to make their mark outside. For the deathcore group Lynchpin, Wacken, Germany was their opportunity to make it so.\n\nTheir win at the Caribbean Metal Battle in Suriname was a qualifier to participate in W:O:A (Wacken Open Air 2016). The competition held last August is an annual event, a pilgrimage for hard rockers, at which the best perform and meet with legends.\n\nFor Sievan Siewsarran, Aaron Maharaj, Gerard Perreira and Jiggy (Jignesh) Khatri the opportunity meant that they were capable, showing off what the Caribbean could do. The response was 10,000 people chanting “Lynchpin” after their performance.\n\n“The crowd instantly reacted to us, moshing, fist pumping and jumping,” Siewsarran said.\n\nIt also meant an introduction to an unusual rhythm not heard in death metal until the Trinidadians arrived. After their presentation, Siewsarran said some fans noted they never heard this type of “groove and rhythm” in death metal so it was rather new to them. For the band, it meant they left a Caribbean mark, a style that could possibly become a new subgenre.\n\nThe recognition from the crowd made up for not receiving an award for their efforts. Yet, they were called attention to themselves, while competing with 29 more-seasoned bands. They also got the opportunity to meet legends Henry Rollins; Taria – formerly of the band Nightwish; members of Orphaned Land and Blind Guardian.\n\n“When we went on stage to perform, we met and were introduced to the audience by the legendary guitar genius - Jeff Waters! What a way to start a performance, huh?” said Siewsarran. “We played alongside some to the biggest acts in Metal/Rock in the world and met fans and bands from every corner! Yes, there was a lot of sharing and learning.\n\nThat is also why we went. We are from a small part of a bigger world and we wanted to learn the international standards and practices of this craft. And we learned a lot!”\n\nThe other experience was learning to be self-sufficient. Most of the funding came from out of pocket and a concert to offset the $250,000 budget to travel to Wacken. In addition to airfare at $20,000 a head, they had cover costs for accommodation, transport, freight fees for their instruments and equipment. The group also received donations from a few companies, fans and friends to defray costs. But the band is hoping that metal/rock music is better seen in the eyes of the State, with the understanding that the genre is more a part of the T&T musical landscape than it is a temporary interest.\n\nThe greater achievement, Siewsarran said, was launching a focal point for other bands to follow, in that locals could recognise what is possible. “We have especially seen a few older bands and musicians come back out since we won the Caribbean Metal Battle, as they’ve been inspired to get back into the music,” Siewsarran said. “Local bands have realised that we altered our look and stage presence since getting back to Trinidad. This is due to our desire to evolve. That is what we learned the most, a band has to evolve or left behind.”\n\nIn addition, they have recently signed to DeadSea Records Caribbean, an independent US label, originally based in California. Lynchpin is the first metal band from the Caribbean on the label, giving hope to others that goals are within their reach.\n\n“It’s really exciting to see the fire we’ve ignited take effect.” Their connection with DeadSea was as already in the works by the time the band visited Wacken. Through DeadSea Records Caribbean’s Jerry Orie, they were given the opportunity at the W:O:A to meet many label executives, magazine writers, radio personalities and club owners from around the world at the festival.\n\nWith the Wacken experience behind them, the band is already preparing for another trip. In April, they will embark on a “minitour” with three dates in Mexico. To make it possible, the band will host a fundraiser, Mas Mayhem, on January 21 at Shakers on the Avenue. The concert will feature the host band Lynchpin as well as Mindscape Laboratory and newcomers Beyond the Animus.\n\nIn the midst of the Carnival season, they continue to push the boundaries. “It is known that at this time of year, rock and metal bands go into hibernation, but we want to change that,” Siewsarran said.\n\nWorks and Transport Minister Rohan Sinanan and his legal team are reportedly looking into the legality of Uber, the worldwide online transportation network which officially launched in T&T at 11 am yesterday.\n\nLast night, a release issued by the Ministry of Works and Transport stated that while the service is known internationally, local authorities have expressed concerns over the legality of its operations within our jurisdiction.\n\nA major concern the Ministry expressed was whether privately owned vehicles would be used for hire.\n\nThe release stated that the Ministry will seek legal advice to determine if the service can continue to operate within T&T’s legislative framework.\n\nThe service, headquartered in the United States, allows users to get transportation using an app.\n\nSoca superstar Machel Montano was the first the use the service in T&T. Starting with a base fare of $20, the rates for the Uber service are $1.20 a minute, a per kilometre fee of $1.40 and a booking fee of $2.50.\n\nThe service was tested yesterday by CNC3 reporter Akash Samaroo, who used the service to travel from Port-of-Spain to Gonzales and back.\n\nHe said after he made his request for transportation via the app, he was informed of the nearby drivers and after choosing was sent a photo of the driver, along with his first name and the model and license plate number of the vehicle. Samaroo said the trip cost him $24.\n\nUsers must be located in either Port-of-Spain or San Fernando to use the service.\n\nTo sign up with Uber, drivers must provide a certificate of good character and undergo a psychometric test.\n\nAccording to information on the Uber website, the service is covered by third-party and passenger liability, with passenger accident coverage for medical expenses, accidental death and disability.\n\n“This coverage commences from the moment a passenger enters the vehicle until the last passenger exits the vehicle,” the company said.\n\nBRIDGETOWN—2016 seemed to have been a challenging year for PriceSmart operations in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile figures for Christmas sales for the international warehouse shopping company are yet to roll in, data for September to November show a drop in sales of close to US$5 million.\n\nIn its latest sales update, PriceSmart said its Caribbean outlets recorded an overall dip of 2.3 per cent in warehouse sales.\n\nCaribbean sales totalled US$203.9 million over three months ending November 30, 2016, down from US$208.6 million a year earlier.\n\nPriceSmart operates 11 stores in the region, four in T&T, three in the Dominican Republic, one each in Jamaica, Barbados, Aruba and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nThe company said T&T, its largest market, was also its least performing market and blamed the island’s ailing economy.\n\n“The difficult economic environment resulted in a 5.0 per cent decline in net warehouse sales compared to a year ago,” it said.\n\nLast month, PriceSmart posted a notice at its branches advising shoppers that it was forced to limit the import of goods because of a shortage of US currency.\n\n“Due to the shortage of available foreign currency in Trinidad, our ability to import merchandise has been limited and subsequently we are not able to offer our full selection of imported products. However, we are committed to stocking the range of imported products most frequently purchased by our members. We are working hard to find solutions until the foreign currency market improves,” the notice stated.\n\nPriceSmart also recorded a decline in sales in Barbados and the Dominican Republic; while Jamaica, The US Virgin Islands and Aruba were the bright spots, all recording increases.\n\nPriceSmart said it was “not planning any more warehouse club openings for fiscal year 2017, but continues to explore other potential sites for future warehouse clubs in Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.”"
