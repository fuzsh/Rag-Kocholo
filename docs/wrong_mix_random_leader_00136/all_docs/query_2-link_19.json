        "text": "author interview – Joseph Garber: On The “Run”\n\nIn 1995 a killer of a thriller called “Vertical Run” made it`s debut on The New York Times and USA Today bestsellers lists, eventually reaching #1 on both lists. Itwas written by a relatively unknown writer named Joseph Garber. While he`d had success with the 1989 book “Rascal Money”, as well as writing literary criticisms for The San Francisco Review of Books and as a columnist for Forbes magazine, nothing he had done could have prepared readers for what they were to find within the pages of “Vertical Run”, a tale so frightening in it`s possibility that it makes the hairs on your neck stand on end just reading it.\n\nThe premise of Vertical Run is to question what might happen if one day you woke up and found that everyone you met during the course of your day tried to kill you. Friends, family, coworkers…they all want you dead for no apparent reason and time is running. These are exactly the prospects the hero of the book, David Elliot, a Fortune 500 exec, faces one morning. But lucky for David, he`s had training as a special operations agent courtesy of the U.S. government and if he`s going to die, he`s not going to die alone.\n\nIn Joseph Garber`s 1999 follow up novel “In A Perfect State”, he once again visits this premise, but this time he tinkers with the hero a bit. Jack Taft, another executive for a prosperous company, is on a business trip to Singapore, upon when landing, realizes he`s the target of an international assassination squad, with dozens of different factions wanting him dead–now! Unlike David Elliot, Jack Taft has no special training to fall back on and has run from every personal problem life has ever thrown at him. If he doesn`t dig deep and find the skills inside of himself to survive, he`ll be dead by dawn.\n\nIf Mr. Garber was interested in the prospect, he could easily become the Ian Fleming of the new millenium, cranking out thrillers based on the exploits of our `Run` hero David Elliot. He knows how to grab your attention and keep it as he ratchets up the tension notch by notch until the reader can barely take it anymore. Vertical Run is the type of thriller Ian Fleming would be proud of. Garber has created the most exciting and dynamic hero to be found on the printed pages since the mid-50`s Fleming novels. Not even Tom Clancy`s Jack Ryan is as energizing and invigorating as David Elliot.\n\nIf you haven`t read “Vertical Run” or “In A Perfect State”, what are you waiting for? “Vertical Run” can be ordered from www.amazon.com and “In A Perfect State” can be ordered from www.waterstones.com\n\nThe following interview contains SPOILERS! If you have not read the books you are advised to read them before proceeding any further.\n\nMK: Can you tell us a little about yourself?\n\nJG: Being a classic “Type A” corporate workaholic, I`ve had little in the way of a personal life. For this reason, I tend to be a private person in the small amount of private life I`ve managed to accumulate. I think the points that are germane to my novels are that I took my undergraduate degree in philosophy (which is why ethical questions pervade my novels), put in time at Columbia Law School (that`s the reason why every book I write contains at least one lawyer joke), and went through the Stanford Business School`s mid-career executive program (the experience convinced me to get try my hand at writing!).\n\nMK: You are somewhat fascinated by the idea of an “everyman” waking up one day and finding himself in incredible life threatening situations, with no logical reason why and seemingly impossible to get out of. What kind of influences in literature or film do you credit for this?\n\nJG: I certainly had Hitchcock in mind when I wrote Vertical Run. And surely I was influenced by the late Geoffrey Household whose man-on-the-run thrillers are the best ever written (try his Dance of The Dwarves, which is the scariest novel I have ever read). However, the fundamental premise of Vertical Run is pretty much of my own concocting. I framed it as the ultimate paranoid nightmare: suppose everybody in the world wants you dead; worse, suppose they`ve got a really good reason…\n\nFurther, if you`re a corporate guy, you`ve got to deal with corporate politics. No matter how nice you are, no matter how hard you try, you are going to wind up with enemies who want you out of the way. To some extent Vertical Run was inspired by taking that unfortunate fact of business life and carrying it to its utmost extreme.\n\nMK: Did you have any difficulties in pitching Vertical Run to the publishers? What is the process like for getting a manuscript in the door?\n\nJG: My agent did all the pitchwork on the book, and more than earned her fees. The book received 14 rejection slips, by the way. Most frustrating because both she and I thought it was a slam dunk and easy sale.\n\nThere`s a cute story here: when she first got the manuscript, my agent put it in the trunk of her car prior to going upstate for the weekend. Then she drove to her office, parked outside, and dashed upstairs for a few minutes. By the time she got back (welcome to New York), the car had been burglarized, and the manuscript was gone.\n\nThe burglar dumped it (along with other stuff he didn`t want) on the street in Queens. A hairdresser found it, and read it over the weekend. On Monday he called my agent and told her that he had it, and would be happy to return it. She offered him a reward for his trouble. He declined. She insisted. To which he replied, “The only reward I want is a signed copy of the book, because it`s the best thriller I`ve ever read.” So my agent knew she had hit… and the hairdresser DEFINITELY got a signed copy.\n\nAs for getting a manuscript in front of a publisher — well, the agent knows editors at all the publishing houses, and knows what fits their tastes. So she calls them with a pitch, sending the thing over if they sniff at the bait. If you are an unknown writer, you absolutely have to have a credible agent or nothing is going to happen. Agents are the rainmakers. Unfortunately, in these days of megaconglomeration, it`s tougher than ever to get an editor to take a risk on a writer no one has ever heard of.\n\nMK: What`s your take on the mega-mergers such as AOL buying out Time Warner? What are the dangers, if any, of a company becoming that big?\n\nJG: Consolidation is driven by a host of natural economic forces. For example, back around 1905 we had more than 500 automobile companies in this country; they had to join or die. Software companies acquire other software companies all the time (especially in the mainframe segment); here the issue is that it usually is much cheaper to buy rather than build. Acquisitions happen constantly in the business world — there are more than 35,000 a year. Within any given industry segment, a large number of acquisitions usually is a sign of the maturation and flattening — when natural or “organic” revenue growth slows, you have little choice other than to acquire smaller companies. Alas, those of us who lived through a similar wave of merger mania back in the early `70`s remember well that the majority of deals don`t work too well, and ultimately fall apart. Marry in haste, repent at leisure…\n\nSpeaking personally, I figure AOL is in for some surprises — the business practices and management skills it takes to run a creative enterprise (especially one involving film and TV) are not easy. Sony lost billions on Columbia before sorting things out. Panasonic did not have a happy experience with Universal (nor, it appears, is Seagrams). And of course TransAmerica`s experience with Hollywood is the stuff of legends — remember “Heaven`s Gate.”\n\nOver the short term, I expect much sound and fury as various companies get eaten up — but then the eaters will have to digest the eaten. Upset tummies may be the very least of it.\n\nMK: You said in another interview that you first conceived of the idea for Vertical Run back in 1976 when your office building was being evacuated due to a bomb threat..how long did that idea sit with you until you got serious about writing it into a thriller?\n\nJG: Actually, the evacuations were in 1978-1979. I started writing Vertical Run in 1981, and got about a third of the way into it. Then a catastrophic computer failure wiped out all the work I did. No recovery. All gone. I was so frustrated I didn`t get back to the tale for 12 years.\n\nAlthough I did learn to start backing up my disks…\n\nMK: Was David Elliott the original hero of your book or did you have a different character in mind?\n\nJG: Dave was the hero from day one.\n\nMK: What kind of ideas did you originally have for the book that ended up being taken out by the publishers? For example, you`ve mentioned that the German edition is much darker than any other is; can you elaborate?\n\nJG: The principal difference between my original version and what was published in this country is that Dave died at the end of the original version — as did Marge. The publisher (hoping for a sequel, no doubt) and Warner Brothers both wanted them to live. Insofar as Warner Brothers was paying quite good money for the service, I added the scene in which Marge is discovered alive and rescued, and added a single page ending that keeps Dave alive. The Germans liked the original, darker version and, with my permission, published it. In the final analysis, I think keeping both characters alive was a good choice — it delivers extra surprises and lets readers close the book with satisfied grins on their faces.\n\nMK: What kind of research did you draw upon for creating David`s back-story in Vietnam and the big surprise he finds at Lockyear?\n\nJG: I served in the Army in the 1960`s. Dave`s backstory arises from tales told me by various hardcases I met, and from some photographs taken of an episode that mirrors the climax of that backstory. The guys who took those photographs got, as Mamba Jack would say, “disappeared.”\n\nAs for the surprise at Lockyear, I`ve always been aware of the incredibly ghastly experiments conducted by Shiro Ishii and Unit 731 during World War II. The Japanese army used Chinese civilians and both American and British POWs as lab rats in a horribly large number of unspeakable medical tests. All of this was covered up quite thoroughly by American war crimes investigators, and it struck me as obvious that the reason for the coverup was that our nation wanted to get its hands on the Japanese research results. Now, fifty-five years after the fact, we know that is precisely what happened. Ed Regis just published a book called “The Biology of Doom” where, via the Freedom of Information Act, he tracks down the details. Read it and your blood will turn to ice.\n\nMK: You mentioned that you had in mind Harrison Ford as David and Clint Eastwood as Ransom at some point during the writing. Did you have anyone specific in mind for the characters of Marge or Helen? What about Bernie or Harry Halliwell?\n\nJG: Actually, I`ve always though Mel Gibson would make a more credible Dave — he`s the only actor I know who really is believable when he talks to himself. As for minor characters like Helen, Bernie, and Harry, I never gave them any thought. They are pretty standard New York City critters, people you see on the street every day, and could be played by any number of minor-part actors. In my mind Marge looks one heck of a lot like the young Olivia Goldsmith (author of The First Wives Club), a feisty New York dame who, long ago, was a friend and co-worker.\n\nMK: Was there ever any suggestion made that perhaps the Marge character should become more romantically involved with David than she was or that she should be in more of the book?\n\nJG: Nope. There`s no time for sex in the book. Hell, there`s barely time for lust.\n\nMK: One of the more colorful passages in the book is where David has to escape the hookers and then infiltrate Senterex right under Ransom`s nose, all the while trying to come off as a limp wristed wimp to avoid detection. With words used such as “queer”, “pansy boy”, “faggot”, “cupcake”, “plaid rabbit” and “Smurf”, how did you get this past the publishers? After all, the 90`s were a very politically correct decade. Did they have any objections?\n\nJG: No objections at all. The homophobia is all on the bad guys side (likewise the racism). Dave, who is an ex-soldier, is playing to the bigotries of people he knows are the worst sort of redneck pinheads. Anyone who was in the Army back when I was (as were Dave, Ransome, and his crew) probably at least once saw some lifer NCO go ballistic when somebody jokingly called him “fag.” Knowing this, Dave caricaturizes his enemies` prejudices, turning them into a weapon against them.\n\nMK: Did you receive any mail from gay rights groups upset with the way you had David portray a gay man?\n\nJG: Again, no. Quite the contrary. I was especially pleased when a gay literary critic for one of the major newspapers recognized the device for what it really says about bigotry and stereotypes, and singled out that section out for positive comment.\n\nMK: The impression I received at the end of `Run` was that David was either selfish and only looking out for himself and that`s why he took off to Mount Excelsior or he just got lucky. After all, he didn`t know about the microbe`s mortality parameters when he took off to Excelsior. And yet you`ve maintained that he went there to die. In retrospect could this have been made clearer to the reader or is it somewhat vague so that the readers can draw their own conclusion?\n\nJG: Hmmm. I intended to portray Dave`s motive as a wish to die with honor, to die alone, and to die in a way that did no harm. Remember, he knows the microbe cannot survive long outside a human host (Ransome makes this very clear). And so by going into the wilderness, he planned a death that would insure the infection would not spread.\n\nMK: The end of the book also gives one the feeling that David, Jack and Marge are going to team up and plot revenge. Is that the intention, or just a reader reading too much into the story?\n\nJG: If I were writing a script for the movie, the final scene would be as follows:\n\nThe San Francisco skyline.\n\nZoom into the black-glassed Bank of America Tower.\n\nLong shot of a man walking through an office lobby with very visible signage reading “The Specialist Consulting Group.”\n\nTracking shot of the same man down a plush office corridor.\n\nMedium shot as he enters a conference room.\n\nInterior of the conference room — it is dark, smoky, lit from above so that all faces are in shadow. The man we`ve tracked mutters an apology for being late, and takes his seat.\n\nLong shot down the length of the conference table. The man at the head of the conference table says, “Try to be on time.” Pause. “Okay, people, we`ve got a problem.” He waves a piece of paper. “I`ve just got a fax from HQ. It says that the Lockyear microbe is highly oxygen dependent. It says that anyone infected with the microbe who climbs into a thin oxygen environment may have a high probability of survival. Now we`ve tracked that bastard Elliot…”\n\nClose shot of the speaker, he looks up.\n\nShot of the conference room door. A man backlit in shadow is standing there. Cut to man at the head of the table, “Yes?” Backlit man replies, “Oh sorry, wrong meeting room.”\n\nMedium shot down conference table. Man at head of the table says, “Close the door behind you.”\n\nAudible click as he continues, “Now as I was saying, if he survived, it is conceivable that Elliot will try to revenge himself…” There is a thump on the conference room table. Heads turn. A hissing hand grenade rolls into view. The man at the head of the table whispers, “Oh shit!”\n\nBlack out.\n\nRoll the final credits.\n\nMK: Has Doubleday or Bantam suggested to you that they would like for you to write a sequel to Vertical Run? To write more adventures based on the character of David Elliot?\n\nJG: No. My relationship with that company has ended. Permanently.\n\nMK: Where do you think David might be today, or do you not give it much thought?\n\nJG: Really, I want that question to be answered by readers. I think whatever sequels and followups they concoct in their own minds are much more interesting than anything I might come up with.\n\nMK: As you know Jon Peters is producing Vertical Run for Warner Brothers and it looks like Paul Hunter may direct. Have you spoken directly with anyone involved in the production of the film and if not do you anticipate having any input?\n\nJG: I had a memorable lunch with Jon when Warners was buying the rights. It`s lawyers were insisting on preposterous contractual obligations, and I was quite prepared to walk away from the deal. Jon squelched `em. Since then, I`ve had no contact whatsoever with the film project.\n\nA movie is the work of many hands. A book is a one man job. Books and films are two wholly different planets, and the citizens of one planet do not necessarily collaborate well with the citizens of the other. So, if the film is made, the most I anticipate is being invited to spend a day on the set and receiving an invitation to the premier (although, I suspect, the seat I`m assigned will not be the best in the house!)\n\nMK: If you can tell us, what kind of rights exactly does Warner Brothers have on Vertical Run? The right to make a franchise out of the David Elliot character?\n\nJG: The Warner contract states they have the rights to David Elliot “in perpetuity throughout the universe, and elsewhere.” They can make as many Dave Elliot movies as they want. Tom Clancy has the same problem with the hero of his books. Paramount can use Jack Ryan any way they want. This is pretty standard stuff in Hollywood. I doubt if any novelist escapes it\n\nMK: What was your reaction when you first found out Vertical Run had made the top of several best sellers lists? Did you ever anticipate the kind of success Vertical Run had? There were even television commercials for the book, which is something you don`t see very often.\n\nJG: Ah, a boyhood dream! From the age of sixteen onwards, I wanted to make the New York Times bestseller list. I was simply thrilled by the whole experience — it was like winning the lottery.\n\nMK: As you are aware, the David Fincher/Michael Douglas 1997 film “The Game”, which I personally love, contains a lot of similarities with Vertical Run, though your novel clearly came out first. In both film and book you`ve got a middle aged businessman on the run for his life, dogged by a shadowy organization that wants him dead, for reasons he cannot understand, he can`t trust friends or family, and all the while being aided and abetted somewhat by a beautiful woman. And to a lesser extent, Will Smith`s “Enemy of the State” covers similar ground. Have you seen the films and if so, did you like them? And what will it take to keep Vertical Run different and fresh from these other films?\n\nJG: I very much enjoy Fincher`s work — he`s a gifted director who knows how to block a scene, frame brilliant atmospherics, extract strong performances from the cast, and cut a montage that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Everything he`s made has great depth.\n\nI think Vertical Run would be better as a director`s film rather than a formula action flick. Most of the conflict in the book is interior, and but for a few set pieces, the real battles go on inside Dave`s head. So I would prefer a small pyrotechnics budget, and rather see a tight psychological thriller built around an actor who can truly show paranoid fear. I think De Palma would make a good director. As would Fincher.\n\nMK: Getting to the subject of James Bond..the way David looks at Marge…the thoughts he has towards her…one minute he could make love to her and the very next he punches her lights out…kind of reminds me of the Sean Connery era as Bond. The “love `em and leave `em” attitude Connery`s Bond had. Do you have a favorite Bond or Bond film?\n\nJG: Ha! I hadn`t thought of that. But Dave definitely is not a love `em and leave `em type. He`s really trying to protect Marge — and also trying to escape the temptation she represents.\n\nBy any measure my favorite Bond movie is From Russia With Love. It kept closely to the novel, yet added an extra dimensions of thrills. Robert Shaw was perfect (and perfectly terrifying) as the unstoppable bad guy, and Connery was supported all around by very strong actors. I`d say the Bond novel that I liked most was the first I read: Doctor No. It was such a revelation — the outrageous velocity of the thing and meeting a character as fascinating as Bond for the first time. It left a permanent impression on me.\n\nMK: What are your impressions of Ian Fleming and his novels?\n\nJG: Fleming was a great entertainer and a natural story teller. These are honorable, although undervalued, professions. The guy had a fluid entrancing style, a vivid imagination, and subtle wit. You could tell he had a great deal of fun writing his novels — and, therefore, the rest of us have a great deal of fun reading them.\n\nMK: Ever thought about what it might be like to write the Bond novels?\n\nJG: I am not a fast writer and could never do a series. Pumping out a new book every year is beyond my talents. Moreover, I am obsessed with photographic realism for my settings and stage props. All the scenery in everything I`ve written is so real that I could take you step-by-step through every locale I`ve written about. The Bond books with their exotic settings would drive me nuts. I`d spend all my time researching and mapping out routes, and none of it writing! I`d be a disaster at that job.\n\nMK: So if the publishers were to ever contact you to gauge your interest in writing for Bond, what would be your answer?\n\nJG: That I like James Bond too much to see him die in so horrible a fashion.\n\nMK: The character of Jack Taft in In A Perfect State (Garber`s next book after Vertical Run) is the complete opposite of David Elliot in terms of self esteem, athleticism, etc. How much of yourself do you incorporate into the heroes, or is it purely fictional?\n\nJG: Purely fictional. Dave is a resourceful, highly trained professional with combat experience. In thinking about what to write next, almost the first question I asked myself was: what would happen if an ordinary peaceful civilian with no training suddenly found himself in a fight for his life? So when Jack Taft is surrounded by a small army of gun-toting thugs his reaction is to throw up his hands and scream, “I surrender.” Which is exactly what most of us would do. Unfortunately for Jack, this doesn`t work too well…\n\nMK: When friends of yours read Vertical Run or In A Perfect State, might they recognize themselves in one of your characters?\n\nJG: I doubt it. The only real person who (in both looks and personality) appears in my books is Thatcher — and Thatcher IS Mark Twain.\n\nMK: Tell us a little about your next novel “Alexander`s End”. What can fans expect from this book?\n\nJG: Alexander`s End is the story of a professional assassin — a late Renaissance master killer who also is a loving husband and father, a gentle philosopher, and generous patron of the arts. But also utterly ruthless in his work. I think of the story as being something of a hybrid between “Day of the Jackal” and “The Name of the Rose.” I want readers to be thrilled by the adventure of it — but also driven to think about the questions of ethics and morality a man like Alexander raises.\n\nMK: What plans do you have after “Alexander`s End”?\n\nJG: Next up will be “The Object of Her Wrath,” a contemporary thriller with the scariest premise I can imagine — truly, the few people to whom I`ve told it have winced and gone white. I started the book three years ago, but had problems which I think I`m now prepared to resolve. Like I said, I am not at fast writer. Not at all.\n\nMK: If you can, briefly explain to fans why In A Perfect State was not released in the United States?\n\nJG: The answer would make a great substitute for Sominex. It`s tied up in contracts, legalese, and the business practices of the publishing industry — truly boring stuff.\n\nMK: Do you anticipate Alexanders End and Object of Her Wrath will receive a U.S. distribution?\n\nJG: I hope so, but it is much too early for me even to guess.\n\n007Forever.com is pleased to present this exclusive interview with Gary Giblin, author of James Bond’s London.\n\nJordan Charter: Tell us about yourself.\n\nGary Giblin: I’m 42 and married to a wonderful woman, an English teacher, named Lisa. I live in the midwestern state of Indiana, in the house I grew up in. I have been writing on Bond for the last six years, which includes consulting work for MGM/UA. I used to work as a National Trainer for the Encyclopaedia Britannica company and my degree is in education. I love movies, travel, linguistics, mystery novels, and all things British, especially Bond and Hitchcock.\n\nJordan: How and when did you get into Bond?\n\nGary: I have always been a memorabilia collector and in 1974, at the age of 15, I decided to start collecting Bondposters, books, toys, etc. I started writing a Bond reference book in collegebut (un)fortunately, Raymond Benson beat me to it! (But his book is a gem, so I can’t complain.) In any case, I’ve been addicted to both the movies and the books ever since.\n\nJordan: What made you decide to write a book like this?\n\nGary: I have always been interested in identifying and visiting film and TV locations and so on a whim, I prepared a short guide for Lee Pfeiffer’s Let’s Bond in Britain Tour in 1997. It proved popular enough that Lee suggested I expand it into a book. I’m thrilled that more and more people enjoy reliving a favorite film through its locations.\n\nJordan: Who was the biggest help in writing this book?\n\nGary: The biggest help was my wife, who read and re-read the book and made many helpful suggestions. After her, and not failing to mention my publishers’ contributions, I’d have to say that Bond production designer Peter Lamont was the greatest help. As I say in the book, he was never, ever too busy to take my calls and answer my questionseven during the production of TWINE. I cannot praise him enough. He is a genius and a marvel, and one of the nicest people I’ve ever known.\n\nJordan: You’ve said you spent three years on “James Bond’s London” and “James Bond’s Britain” so can you give us a rough outline of how that time was spent? (i.e. How much was used for research? How much was used for travel?)\n\nGary: I actually started the book in January of 1998 and shortly thereafter flew to the UK, where I spent about three weeks looking for and photographing locations for what was then called “James Bond’s Britain”. This meant that in addition to London, my assistant (and friend, and former boss!), Chris Gardner, and I traveled all over England and Scotland, including the rather remote spot where the From Russia With Love helicopter chase was filmed. I then continued writing and researching at home for a few months, then went back to London in the summer of ’98 for more legwork. I was finishing up the book in 1999 when Ilearned that TWINE was to include extensive London and UK location work. So, the decision was made to wait and include material from that film. Then in 2000, after TWINE, we decided that there was so much information that the book should be split in two. Thus began the rather arduous process of separating entries and creating the second book, James Bond’s Britain, which will be published in 2003 and will include the British locations from the new film.\n\nJordan: There are so many Bond locations in London, some of which have changed over the years, how did you go about locating all of them?\n\nGary: In several different ways. One way, of course, was to consult production documents and the filmmakers to find out where things were shot. In some cases, it involved me taking reference photos from the films and walking all over London till I found the spot (e.g., the building seen out the window of the big conference room in Thunderball.) In the case of the Secret Service HQ shown near the beginning of Dr. No, I used books of aerial photos of London to spot the complex, which, if you look closely, can be seen to be located on the river.\n\nJordan: Are there any Bond locations you couldn’t find?\n\nGary: Until I started talking with Peter Lamont, there were several! But after that, I’m pretty sure that every Greater London location ever shown in an EON film is included in the book.\n\nJordan: Which one location was your favorite or most interesting? Least favorite?\n\nGary: I have a number of favoritesincluding the office where Ian Fleming worked for Naval Intelligence during WWII. It had been taken over by the Foreign Office and used for storage, but thanks to some very kind people in that department, I was able to get inside, and even had the space in front of the fireplace cleared away so that I could “replicate” that famous photo of Ian standing there so regally in his Commander’s uniform. It was also thrilling to get inside Fleming’s office in Fleet Street and to visit the Royal Air Force base which has appeared in several Bond films, including Goldfinger, Octopussy and TWINE.\n\nThese side effects take place due icks.org levitra free consultation to decreased generation of sebum by the sebaceous glands.

The cost for advertisement purpose for the cheapest online cialis Full Report is very high in demand and increasingly mounting popularity all around the world. Jordan: How did you prepare for writing the book? Was there any sort of process you went through while writing it?\n\nGary: First I re-read every novel and story, taking detailed notes, and then I re-watched all the films, and, again, took copious notes. I also read as much on Fleming and the films as I could and then began making a location list and organizing it by district. Then I researched the places themselves, their histories, etc., so that the book might have a little extra appeal beyond simply saying, “Oh, this is where this was filmed and this is where Fleming got his shirts.” And, as I said, I spent several weeks in the UK and spoke with a number of people who were involved in the films, including Lamont, John Glen, John Stears and Reg Barkshire, Broccoli and Saltzman’s former partner on the EON board.\n\nJordan: For those who don’t know, tell us a little about “James Bond’s Britian” which will be released in 2003.\n\nGary: JBB will detail all the film, book and Fleming locations in the UK OUTSIDE London. This includes Pinewood Studios, the Aston Martin company, Fleming’s final resting place, the TWINE pipeline in Wales (and elsewhere), the Goldfinger and TND golf club, the Moonraker rocket site from the novel, Sean Connery’s birthplace, and on and on, as well as the many British locations from the new film, Die Another Day.\n\nJordan: Why such a big gap between the release of “London” and “Britian?” Weren’t they orignally going to be one volume?\n\nGary: Yes, but because there was so much material we decided to do it as two books. My original manuscript, without pictures, was over 400 pages. It was either cut a massive amount of text (to keep the book reasonably priced and easy to carry around London) or issue it in two parts. And this way, we can release the second part in about a year and so include all the new locations.\n\nJordan: You left out the locations of the non-Fleming novels. Was there ever any plans to include them? Or did you know from the get-go that you wanted to focus on Fleming’s Bond?\n\nGary: I am an unabashed Fleming fan and, I must say, defender. As far as I’m concerned, what he wrote is gospel–about Bond, his life and his world. So, no, I never intended to include anything from non-Fleming novels. What anyone else says about Bondwhere he dines or drives or whateversimply doesn’t mean anything to me. And it’s the same with the non-EON Bond films. None of this is to sleight the other writers or filmmakers. I respect what they have done. But for me, none of these works is truly “James Bond”.\n\nJordan: Since they will always be making Bond films, do you have any plans on keeping the book updated with the new locations?\n\nGary: Yes, I certainly envision updating the book.\n\nJordan: Do you have any plans on writing any more Bond location books? For instance, will there ever be a “James Bond’s America”or “James Bond’s Europe?” Having read “James Bond’s London” I would love to see more books of this nature from you and Daleon.\n\nGary: Yes, I have already started “James Bond’s America” and would like to do a “James Bond’s Europe” as well.\n\nJordan: Besides the meeting Mr. Snowman (see related articles at CommanderBond.net or SectretIntel.com), do you have any other stories about your trips abroad?\n\nGary: Finding the helicopter location from From Russia With Love was most memorable. Going solely on a remark in a Bond reference book, we went to Lochgilphead, Scotland…and just asked the locals. “Och, the helicopter!” They all knew the place, but getting there was still difficult…driving, parking, hiking, then trying to pick out the exact spot. And finally we spotted the rock where Connery crouched to shoot down the helicopter. And just below it, rusting there for over 25 years, was a piece of the helicopter!\n\nJordan: And finally, do you have any other books in the works?\n\nGary: Well, thanks for asking. As a matter of fact, my next book is Alfred Hitchcock’s London, which Daleon will publish later this year. It is similar in format to James Bond’s London, with locations from his 20-plus English films, as well as from his source novels and, of course, his life. It was written with the cooperation of several of his collaborators (including Bond production designer Syd Cain, who worked on Hitchcock’s Frenzy), as well as his daughter Pat.\n\nSpecial acknowledgements for help with this article go to Lee Pfeiffer, Daniel Dykes, and, of course, Gary Giblin for allowing time for 007Forever.com to interview him!–Jordan Charter\n\nRead 007Forever.com’s review of James Bond London here.

I am Matt Sherman, Assistant Editor of 007Forever, and I am delighted to moderate our live chat tonight featuring your questions for Mr. Don McGregor, author of “James Bond: The Quasimodo Gambit” and “James Bond: GoldenEye”, both successful graphic novels with everyone`s favorite number in the forefront. Don`s large body of work is well known in the comix industry, so if we stay on topic for a few questions in a row, hang tight and we will get to your topic`s questions soon.\n\n**This is a “moderated chat,” so if you are just joining us inside 007Forever`s chat room, please head for the auditorium by entering /auditorium at the prompt at bottom of your screen, and you will receive a “welcome to the 007Forever auditorium message” on your screen. Only questions submitted in the auditorium will be answered in tonight`s chat. Thank you.**\n\nPlease let me take a moment to share excerpts from the accolades given to Don`s recently released “Detectives Inc.: A Terror of Dying Dreams”\n\n“ a lean, taut piece, pared down to its dark essence, that pulls no punches…”\n\n“ Wow! Don McGregor and Gene Colan know how to tell a great story…the best comic book I`ve read in 5 years, when I last read A Terror of Dying Dreams…Don`t just stand here reading the back cover, Man. Take it home…a virtuoso synthesis of words and pictures from two of the industry`s grand masters…”\n\nDon McGregor That`s some high praise…\n\nFlemfan: …indeed…\n\nWelcome to 007Forever!\n\nDon McGregor Good to be here, M. Please don`t accuse me of being a misogynist dinosaur, okay. Don`t ask, don`t tell.\n\nFlemfan: I think you`ve given us a good place to start…\n\n…what I mean is…\n\nDon McGregor I give you all the straight lines. Rainier and Denning taught me how to do that.\n\nFlemfan: You took exception with the GoldenEye script…\n\nYou added to Bond`s interior monologue…\n\nDon McGregor Who me?\n\nFlemfan: When M calls Bond a dinosaur…tell us about that?\n\nYou had Bond upset…\n\n…at M`s lambasting that he is a misogynist pig…\n\nDon McGregor Well, I`m a Bond fan. And here is M chastising and criticizing Bond for having sex, when she`s screwed up with the information he`s managed to give her.\n\nSo, when adapting that scene into comics, I certainly thought Bond should be able to take up for himself. But I didn`t change any of the dialogue in the script. I just gave Bond`s reaction to this tirade.\n\nIcebreaker asks: How is it that you felt about GoldenEye that M “screwed it up”…\n\n…by getting on “Bond`s case”?\n\nDon McGregor Bond has been following the people who have stolen the stealth helicopter, and it`s M who doesn`t let him pursue it.\n\nBoy, I should pull those GoldenEye comics out, huh?\n\nWe`re up to 77 questions?\n\nFlemfan: Very funny!\n\n{action: } laughs hysterically.\n\nHere`s a good one from jsacks…\n\nJsacks asks: Is there any hope of ever returning to the world of Sabre?\n\n… Maybe some Sabre text stories? Old scripts? Sketches?\n\nHow much of your “…Decadence” do you have worked out?\n\nDon McGregor Great question, Matt. For fans of SABRE, they know the biggest storyline of all, THE DECADENCE INDOCTRINATION, left at a cliffhanger.\n\nIf, we manage to sell enough of the graphic albums on the Internet, or through the specialty shops, or through places like Bud Plant, then, yes, you will see how that biggest fantasy heroic epic I`ve ever attempted will end.\n\nThere will be stories that go into characters backgrounds, as well as show where they end up. Dearie Decadence, Heironymous Skull, Tango Two-Step, and other characters that Sabre and Melissa Siren haven`t met yet, but the readers have, will all collide!\n\nIcebreaker asks: Who owns the rights to produce Bond comic books, either original ones or ones based on the movies?\n\nDon McGregor My understanding of that, is that if it involves the literary Bond, the Ian Fleming Bond, then it would be Glidrose. If it is involved with the cinematic Bond, then that would be Eon Productions.\n\nIcebreaker asks: Were more Bond comics planned with Topps before they folded?\n\nDon McGregor Not to my knowledge, but there could have been. The fact that the last two issues of GOLDENEYE never came out certainly wouldn`t help the cause, though.\n\nJsacks asks: What current comic books do you enjoy? Have you read Brian Michael Bendis? He does solid detective yarns.\n\nDon McGregor Jack Cole`s PLASTIC MAN. It was great to see that early, first material. Milton Caniff`s TERRY AND THE PIRATES. I see a lot of the comic strips these days because I`m doing the ZORRO NEWSPAPER STRIP. They finally found a way to get me to buy a daily newspaper. Have my comic in it every day! That`ll do it!\n\nThat has its upsides and downsides. The upside is that you have a reinforcement of the work you are doing every day! It is also the downside, because every day you see where they are, and how close on your butt they are.\n\nFlemfan: **If you joining us late, please enter the auditorium by typing /auditorium and then send us your questions for Don!

Does it vary on the project, or do you have a definite preference?\n\nDon McGregor It does depend on the project.\n\nFlemfan: What do you mean?\n\nDon McGregor I more or less prefer a full plot, because the other way, it`s almost having to go back and write the sequence a second time. I prefer to write the scripts to the artist`s strengths. Sometimes I am very detailed in every aspect of the page design.\n\nWith other artists, I may do panel breakdowns, suggested angles, with others I`m less specific.\n\nIt depends on the working relationship you have with the artist, if you are lucky enough to know before hand who you will be partnered with.\n\nAnd make no mistake, writing comics and illustrating comics is a partnership. You can write your heart out, you can bleed onto the paper, you can care passionately, but if you don`t have an artist that brings their talent and vision to the project, you`re dead on the page.\n\nJsacks asks: Here`s an off-the-wall question: as a creator, how do you feel about the current controversy about Napster and copyrights?\n\nFlemfan: How do you feel about the Internet and related copyrights?\n\nDon McGregor That`s a broad-based question.\n\nIt has no easy answer.\n\nThe Internet can help books survive.\n\nBut it can also be a place where you have no control over where it appears.\n\nIllya asks: Don, did you ever read any of the Evan Tanner series (by Lawrence Block)?\n\nFlemfan: You know, Don, the detective named “Matt”\n\nI apologize for the technical troubles tonight!\n\nDon will stay late if you are having fun at 10!\n\n**This is a “moderated chat,” so if you are just joining us inside 007Forever`s chat room, please head for the auditorium by entering /auditorium at the prompt at bottom of your screen, and you will receive a “welcome to the 007Forever auditorium message” on your screen.

There was the ZORRO`S RENEGADES that I was writing.\n\nThen there was THE MASK OF ZORRO movie adaptation into comics.\n\nAnd then there was the comic strip that was coming.\n\nMrflig asks: What`s your favorite Bond: a) movie and b) book?\n\nDon McGregor DR. NO is my all time favorite Bond book.\n\nI can still remember reading that sequence with the centipede.\n\nI actually stopped myself three quarters of the way through, and said, Hold it!\n\nYou don`t come across a suspense narrative like this very often.\n\nSavor it.\n\nEnjoy it.\n\nI went back and started it from the beginning.\n\nReading slowly.\n\nAnd the centipede crawls through his groin hairs.\n\nAnd then drinks the sweat off his forehead\n\nIn high school, I read this aloud in a high school English class.\n\nThis was before Kennedy made Fleming acceptable in the States.\n\nThe teacher near had a heart attack.\n\nThe students love it.\n\nI don`t believe I got expelled.\n\nFlemfan: We know your fav film is Goldfinger…\n\n…you saw it 20 times…\n\nhere’s a follow-up to the Dr. No episode\n\nMrflig asks: Did the centipede scene in Dr. No inspire the nasty scene with the leeches in Quasimodo Gambit?\n\nDon McGregor I did not have that sequence in the beginning of scripting QUASIMODO.\n\nI knew I had to have a Fleming-esque Bond situation, where there was that intimacy of danger and detail.\n\nBut everything I came up with just didn`t have that spark.\n\nI was actually researching the Georgia swamps when I came across some information about the leeches.\n\nAnd how when they sucked the blood from you, they put an enzyme into your system that wouldn`t allow the blood to coagulate.\n\nAnd I knew had something that would be vivid!\n\nThat could make a memorable Bond sequence.\n\nI hope it did.\n\nFlemfan: It sure did…\n\nHere`s a follow-up…\n\nIllya asks: Don, do you have any problems writing for Bond because he`s so flawless? Part of your strength as a storyteller is giving us the very human Rainier and Denning, Dragon, etc.\n\nDon McGregor I`d argue that point. Fleming`s Bond is not flawless. In writing THE QUASIMODO GAMBIT, I re-read many of the Fleming Bond books.\n\nThe Bond in that comic has Fleming`s Bond`s memories.\n\nAnd the structure is a reverse of LIVE AND LET DIE. Did I ever tell you that, Matt?\n\nFlemfan: I thought you read from RIGHT to left…\n\nDon McGregor Rainier and Denning are a part of the New York City Scene.\n\nThey love Culp and Cosby.\n\nThey have a deep and abiding respect for each other.\n\nBut at the same time, despite being DETECTIVES INC., these guys do not have the same personalities.\n\nThey have different opinions on many things.\n\nBut not on important things, like honor, commitment, friendship, accountability, etc.\n\nJason, good to see you here. Jason`s on the don mcgregor OneList. Hope some of you can join us there, as well.\n\nFlemfan: “one world, one list, Mr. Bond…”\n\nJsacks asks: Will you ever release the “Detectives Inc” video, so everyone can see it?\n\nDon McGregor Just this week-end, I was at a wedding with my good buddy Alex Simmons, and we were discussing the DETECTIVES INC: A TERROR OF DYING DREAMS film version.\n\nFlemfan: …Alex starred in the film…\n\nDon McGregor It needs a third track and a digital copy made, before we can make any final decisions about that.\n\nThe cast is superb.\n\nAnd the fight sequence in the parking lot is much longer and dynamic than we had room to do in the comic.\n\nFlemfan: Bond represents five decades now…\n\n…he has to be “updated” sometimes…\n\nhere`s a crossover question of sorts…\n\nIllya asks: Given your love of westerns & Bond, why haven`t we seen you create an Artemis Gordon sort of character…a Bond of the 1800s so to speak?\n\nDon McGregor Okay, I`m thrown here for a moment.\n\nI thought you were saying that Bond himself has to be updated.\n\nBut the question now seems to be he should have a Jim West sidekick?\n\nAre we crossing into Zorro territory here?\n\nBaby crocodiles’ hearts were mixed with wood oil to the appropriate consistency, and this then be smeared into the husband’s penis to restore his potency.

Ah, you think I`m going to give myself away here, huh?\n\nI don`t really know how to answer that question.\n\nIn some respects, most of the characters probably have something of me in them.\n\nEven the bad guys.\n\nBut to single out a character, well, I don`t know, I`d be reluctant to do that.\n\nSome people, for sure, would say Bob Rainier, from DETECTIVES INC, or even Ted Denning, but I don`t know about that.\n\nWho do you think?\n\nIllya asks: What about other folks? Denning’s mom is obviously Alex`s mom… (Kev here btw)\n\nDon McGregor Kevin! Hey, you guys are great!\n\nFlemfan: Is “Denning`s” mom “Alex`s” mom in real life?\n\nDon McGregor Well, she plays the character in the film version.\n\nBut I wouldn`t say it`s her. DETECTIVES INC. is fiction.\n\nYou could say there might be some aspects of her in the character, just as there might be a little of Alex in Denning, perhaps.\n\nBut they really are just them.\n\nYou can`t replace them.\n\nThey didn`t come out of a mold, or from any one source.\n\nKevin Hall, by the way, for all you, is the one who makes the www.donmcgregor.com look the way it does.\n\nHe is the artist for me, the partner I work with on the Internet.\n\nHe takes my ideas and helps make them a reality in Cyberspace.\n\nThank you, Kevin!\n\nFlemfan: Don, you have written extensively for magazines…Bond-related interviews…”Ice” asks…\n\nIcebreaker asks: What do you think of Bond and genre fanzines? What could they use in future? What are their best qualities now?\n\nDon McGregor That`s another question that`s pretty wide.\n\nThe Bond magazines out there each have a different approach so there is no one answer.\n\nI suppose you mean to appeal to a wider audience.\n\nI think, when you get that love across, with the facts, and not let the love blind you, but make you want to make this the best Bond piece you can, then something people who love Bond should get a quality product.\n\nIllya asks: More Bond, please. Seems like the Bond movies are great on action, but short on the suspense that I LOVE the original Fleming books for. How do you keep some suspense in the comics?\n\nDon McGregor I think one of the biggest challenges in doing genre fiction with heroes is to get the audience to forget for ten seconds that Bond or Zorro have to come back next issue!\n\nIf I manage that, that they get so swept up into what is happening, that the actually forget that, then I think I`ve done my job as a storyteller.\n\nIt means going into the intimate detail as Fleming did.\n\nYou have to live with it, day after day.\n\nRob Clough, who wrote earlier, wrote on the OneList, that there is a sequence with the Black Panther buried alive that made him feel like he was suffocating.\n\nThat`s what the writer does every day in a scene like that.\n\nImagine what it`s like to be buried alive.\n\nOr if it`s Bond, what it`s like to have your mouth taped shut with leeches inside it.\n\nOr in PANTHER`S QUEST, what it`s like to be tear gassed.\n\nYou go there day after day. And you try to make it the best damned pages of comics you can.\n\nFlemfan: Follow-up to your life inside the head and soul of your characters…\n\nYou have filmed a movie of “Detectives, Inc.” (and have appeared in film cameos) and have written prose books as well. Which medium is better for you and why? Which is your personal fave?\n\nDon McGregor Hey, I see there`s an emotion meter here. What`s it reading? Yikes!\n\nThat`s a good question.\n\nI love all the mediums.\n\nWhen you write a prose book, like DRAGONFLAME and THE VARIABLE SYNDROME, the thing you know about this is that what you put down there is what the audience knows.\n\nIn film, it isn`t just you.\n\nThere is so much technical detail that has to be dealt with.\n\nOn the other hand, as a director, unlike as a writer, you have people who deal with specific sections, and you ask, “What`s my options?”\n\nAnd someone says, this and this and this.\n\nAnd you say, “This sounds the best. Do that.”\n\nThe actors bring your words and sequences to life.\n\nIn comics, the artist brings them to life.\n\nSo many folk think comics are a second-rate art form.\n\nFlemfan: {action: } snorts derisively.\n\nDon McGregor I think they`re beautiful.\n\nFlemfan: {action: } nods solemnly.\n\nDon McGregor When you see a finished page of comic art from a Gene Colan, or a Dwayne Turner, or Mike Mayhew, or Billy Graham, as just some of the people I`ve been privileged to work with…\n\nWell, nothing beats it.\n\nAll the anxiety about facing the blank page…\n\nAnd how can you make the best page of comics you can that day…\n\nAll that is swept aside, when that art comes in, and sometimes the scene is even more than you dared hope for.\n\nIt brings breath and meaning and those characters alive!\n\nIcebreaker asks: You’ve created GoldenEye and The Quasimodo Gambit as comics. How do you REALLY feel about other writers and artists who have created Bond comics in recent years?\n\nDon McGregor I`ve seen Paul`s [Gulacy of “Serpent’s Tooth] Bond. He`s a big Bond fan, and he has a lot of power in his drawing. I really haven`t read the material.\n\nOn the other hand, how can any writer really answer this.\n\nEven if I had.\n\nBecause you can`t come to that objectively.\n\nI just hope the work I`ve done stands on its own merits.\n\nI hope, in the case of Bond or Zorro, people know I came to it with a respect for the mythos of both characters.\n\nAnd I wish the others well.\n\nFlemfan: Don, thanks for staying late…last question…\n\n…before a few quick announcements…\n\nDon McGregor You want to do some more, it`s flowing now, so it`s up to you.\n\nFlemfan: {action: } cheers enthusiastically.\n\nDon, this is why the fans love you, everywhere!\n\nHow about we have you back instead for a follow-up chat soon? Final question\n\nJsacks asks: Who are you rooting for tonight, the Lakers or Pacers?\n\nDon McGregor Hey, Jace, are you really David Letterman? I`ll ask my son that question. Hey, Rob. Who are you for?\n\nOoop! Rob is gone!\n\nBest I can answer that one. I am working on a sequence at Shea Stadium. It`s the only sports answer I can think of.\n\nFlemfan: And so say all of us…Shea?\n\nA few thoughts…first…\n\nFor everyone who participated tonight, as always, many hearty “thank yous” from Fandom/007Forever for chatting with us, and a very special THANK YOU goes to Don McGregor, for taking the time to talk with his fans.

And thanks for setting this up, Matt.\n\n**Check out:\n\nDonMcGregor.com\n\nZorro Productions\n\nZorro Strips: Daily Update\n\n–Continuing our two-parter with comix legend, Don McGregor, as he shares about the Bonds, John Glen, Maurice Binder, and struggling to fit the creative muse into a “DEADline”.\n\nMatt: James Bond in Quasimodo Gambit was a bizarre deadline, wasn`t it? Tell us about it.\n\nDon: The Deadline itself kept changing, and there were different deadlines!\n\nWhen I was first approached to do a Bond comic series, the book was being produced by two separate companies: Eclipse Comics and Acme, which was based in London. They were already in the midst of doing a Bond series with different talent, and they wanted this book to be ready when the other finished. The common thought was to do a Post-Glasnost Bond plot, but I felt, even if they could pull all the talent together to do it, and could come out with Quasimodo Gambit as rapidly as they said, it could be dated by the time it saw print.\n\nIt ended up taking years (yeah, that`s right, instead of months, the deadline became years!) for the book to be illustrated. Now, I had written and researched the entire project, so virtually it was all there. But then I had to do final scripting over the art, and make the captions and dialogue fit the art, and because the art was so late, it was often a pressured deadline…\n\n…And Bond had to be done on pages that were in rough penciled sketch. I often had difficulty just in making out who was whom. In one sequence, in M`s office, I placed a lot of the M and Bond introductory stuff into what looked like blank space behind M`s head, but when I saw the color, finished pages, I don`t know how many odd months later, I could see the artist had put in detailed wall space, including a painting behind M`s head, and it was all covered by copy! So, I went back, a replaced it all, to preserve the art. And once again, I was running against another “Deadline.”\n\nJames Bond: GoldenEye was a different beast altogether, because Topps got the license to do the series late, and you have to have the first issue of the book ready by the time the film opens. The problem is no one knew what the finished film looked like, and let`s face it, with a Bond film, and a Bond comic, fans are going to be looking closely. But what does that War Room really look like? What about the interior computer control rooms under the frozen wastelands? Never mind, what do many of the characters in the story look like!\n\nMatt: How did you start your lifelong love affair with Mr. Bond? 😉\n\nDon: With Ian Fleming. And that goes way back before any films were made. It goes back even before President Kennedy put “From Russia, With Love” on his favorite books list.\n\nI used to travel down to a small town in West Warwick, Rhode Island. And they had a huge store there called “Newberries,” and it was one of those places that sold everything from fresh made cookies (Oh, man! I loved those Scotch Jams, to this day, but you can`t find them anymore) to paperback books. And that`s where I picked up a copy of “Diamonds Are Forever”.\n\nIt`s funny how you can`t remember things that happened two days ago, and other things stay with you, sharp, clear, the moment of impact as fresh as if it happened an instant ago.\n\nI`d gone to a friend`s house on New Year`s Eve, and I`d taken that DAF paperback with me. I was going back towards my house, walking beside the road that traveled up a steep incline that just went on what seemed like forever when you were walking. There was a January snap in the air, stinging the cheeks. I was stopping under streetlights, reading a few passages here and there from Diamonds, and then hiking to the next light in the darkness. And there was that moment when the villain gets his intended victim in the hot mud rooms, and pours scalding mud in his face and eyes! And I remember standing in the lone light in the black expanse. Everything was quiet. New Year`s Eve was either over, or people hadn`t returned to their houses yet. And I thought what the hell is this!\n\nAnd I hadn`t even read “Dr. No” yet!\n\nI learned a lot from Fleming. There`s a sequence from “No”, where the centipede is crawling up Bond`s body, and it`s one of the most exquisitely detailed suspense narratives I`ve ever read. I actually recall telling myself to slow down, go back to the beginning of the scene, and savor it, because those kind of scenes didn`t happen often!\n\nMatt: You have plenty of stories about Bond insiders. What is the wildest thing that happened to you while working on a Bond related project?\n\nDon: The wildest thing! You think I`m going to tell you that, Matt? Right here, and now! Or ever!\n\nI will tell you that one of the nicest thing was meeting so many really nice, talented people. I have fond memories of talking with John Glen the night before For Your Eyes Only opened in the States. He was incredibly candid and open about all his feelings. Maurice Binder was a delight. I`d gone to the MGM buildings to talk with him, and they were supposed to have a clip of the opening credits to show me, and for some reason, it couldn`t be found. I told Maurice that was fine, not a problem, but Maurice wouldn`t hear of it. He said, “You`ve traveled all this way, Don, and they were supposed to have it ready!” And guess what, ten, fifteen minutes later, we were in a screening room watching his wonderful way with credits.\n\nWhat pleased me most in that instance is that after the article on Maurice appeared in Star Log magazine, he wrote me a note telling me how pleased he was with it, and that he felt it was the most accurately he had ever been quoted. That`s not a wild moment, but its one I hold dear.\n\nStill, one of the best things about working on Bond related articles in those days, was meeting Tom Carlile. He was Cubby Broccoli`s US Publicity Coordinator. He treated me, and Star Log, as if we were as important as the biggest promotion gig they had going. Tom took me to dinner one night. I shouldn`t have been there. I`d had a heart attack the night before, although I`d convinced myself by morning that it couldn`t have been that, and yet I`d gone into Manhattan to make sure everything was all right with a series I was writing called Nathaniel Dusk, which was drawn by the Dean of comics, Gene Colan, and then I`d hiked over to see Tom.\n\nHe was going in for cancer tests soon after. It was a foolish thing I`d done, and I hope I`d know better today, and yet I`ve always treasured that night, sitting with Tom, as he told me great stories about the early days of trying to promote Bond in the States. “Who wants a movie about a Limey detective?” more than one theater owner would say to him. And the change to where he had people beating at his door and ringing the phone off the hook to get whatever they could on 007! But he also told me amazing stories about working with George Stevens and behind-the-scenes events on “Shane”, stuff I`d never known. Or how difficult it was to work on “Barbarella” with Jane Fonda and Dino DeLaurentiis.\n\nMaybe not wild, but certainly treasured, Matt. It was the last time I ever saw Tom. But what a wonderful last time together. I miss him.\n\nMatt: Tell us about why it was that the lovely and popular GoldenEye comic`s last two issues went unpublished!\n\nDon: See, now, you`re talking about stuff you know the answers to! Now, you`re just baiting me!\n\nLet me see how to tell this without all the twists and turns that project took. The first thing people need to know about a project like this is that there are three companies involved. Eon Productions, of course, made the film. They hired a company called Leisure Concepts to handle Licensing deals for the Bond movie. So, now you have three separate companies, when you include Topps, all with people handling the business end of the project. (And comics are a literary-style item like Glidrose produces for the Fleming estate, too.)\n\nWhat I have to do is find out how many pages we have to tell the film, get as much visual reference as possible, and find the best way to capture the spirit and tone of a film I haven`t even seen yet! Now, all of Topps negotiations had to go through Leisure Concepts to get to Eon Productions. The problem for a place that handles licensing is that they don`t understand the nature of comics. Normally, they are approached to do a Bond product, be it watches or T-Shirts or talcum powder. The company wanting to make this product needs Bond images.\n\nLet`s take a T-Shirt company, for example. They make the deal, the licensing company sends them 20 or 30 images of Bond, the company selects the one they feel will make the best T-Shirts, and its onward. With comics, you have to see everything!\n\nIt`s not even like adapting the book, because you can slide over the details, the pictures aren`t right there in front of the audience. But with a comic, you have to visualize every scene! And with all the technical gizmos and unique backgrounds that are a part of the story, you have to show it! And if I was going to do a Bond comic, I`m coming to it, as someone who loves comics, who has a reputation for the books my names goes on, but as important as that, producing a quality book for fans of Bond, because I`m a fan! I want to do the book I`d like to see if I was out there, wanting to have a comic about Bond!\n\nAll of GoldenEye, all three books were pencilled. All three books were lettered. All three books were inked. I had worked on the covers for all three books with Brian Stelfreeze. And without a doubt, the best cover we had, in terms of attracting an audience, Bond and especially, non-Bond, was the cover for Issue #2. Brian did a painting from the steam room sequence between Bond and Xenia Onatopp, with General Ouromov as a ghostly overseeing presence. It was colorful, provocative and caught the spirit of the scene exquisitely.\n\nAnd it became a problem. I wasn`t there for all the conversations, but apparently someone, somewhere was concerned about the cover. Topps was ready to go to press with the second book when an objection came about the cover. Leisure Concepts and Eon, or just one of the companies, had to give approval to the book, and that approval stalled. Jim Salicrup wouldn`t print the book until Topps had the approval.\n\nTHE DAY (and I`m not just saying this for dramatic effect; it`s really the way it happened), the day they put all the finished art in my hands, done, complete, was also the day I was told the book wouldn`t see print. Ads had already been taken out for a compilation edition! You can see the book listed as if it exists in Price Guides! No Bond fan will ever find it-issues 2 and 3–because it didn`t happen. There are lots of books like that these days, advertised as if they exist, with Price Guide sums printed as to their value, and the damn books never came out! Twenty years from now, comics researchers and historians are going to go nuts trying to find books that don`t exist at all!\n\nDrink plenty of water: Moisture is very much helpful for the persons who are suffering some problem in your sexual life like dipping levels of testosterone, low sperm count or lack of libido?

Zinc Insufficient amounts of zinc would lead to low testosterone levels, decreased sperm count tadalafil uk and a decreased semen quantity. I knew time was running out, even as the book was being finished. And we were all under the gun, to get the book done, to do it right in the amount of space we had, to have it ready. But the more time that passed from the opening of the movie, the odds were increasing that the series wouldn`t be completed.\n\nAnd it wasn`t because the book didn`t sell! GoldenEye #1 was very successful. All that work. I held the art in my hands, heard the words, and there`s an empty feeling inside. You`ve run the race! You`ve given everything you have! And the James Bond fans will never see it!\n\nThere`s not one argument you can offer that`s going to change it.\n\nAnd it hurts the chances for more Bond comics down the road, because some people are going to think, hey, Bond comics didn`t sell.\n\nMatt: You attended the Bond Weekend `99 we held in Las Vegas. What was it like to meet all those crazy fans and inscribe some of your work for them?\n\nDon: The Bond Con was great! Although, you ask about wild times, Matt, and the wildest time there was when you took on the entire Las Vegas airport security personnel. Personally, I thought maybe you`d been doing a little too much James Bond immersion identification. But you appeared at Planet Hollywood, shaken, not stirred.\n\nBoth Marsha and I really enjoyed the people there. It wasn`t just the connection of Bond, it was a genuine warmth with so many of those people. There was a lot of passion, for Bond, certainly, but for life in general!\n\nBut I do miss driving with Jim Sieff in the Bond Aston Martin going down the desert highway! I wish we`d done that with Lana Wood! Damn! Is Jim bringing the Aston Martin to New Orleans for Bond Weekend 2000? Did you know that`s where I set the Blade series I wrote for Marvel? Thinking about it, I guess there aren`t many desert highways in Orleans, are there? Hmmm.\n\nMatt: Jim may be busy filming with his Astons for Austin Powers 3. What are some of the trends you foresee in the comix industry?\n\nDon: I`m far from a soothsayer. Comics are under siege, in many ways. Certainly, the Internet will open the way for new ways to present and do comics, though how all that will play out is still cloudy. I do believe this is a way to help books survive, by using the Web, that might not have a chance if one has to rely just on the big Distributors. It`s one of the reasons I decided to start the www.donmcgregor.com site. Kevin Hall put together that and the McGregor ONElist Message Group. I wasn`t sure anybody would write to the thing. Well, not only have they written, but they`ve put file copies up of art from books I`ve done, and they`ve done a magnificent job with it. There`s color art from Dwayne Turner drawn Black Panther, to repros from Billy Graham SABRE art. I hope that we will have graphic albums of SABRE: An Exploitation of Everything Dear sometime in the near future. The entire storyline that ran from SABRE Issue #3 to #9, “Everything Dear” collected in one big volume. But before that we should have out The Definitive Ragamuffins Graphic Album, a series I created years ago, pencilled by Gene Colan. It`s about kids growing up in the 1950`s, a book about kids for adults, with flash forwards to various points in time in the `60s, `70s and `80s.\n\nIt`s exactly books like these that I think the Internet can help to survive.\n\nIf people can find you on the Internet, see that they can get the books directly from you, and if they feel confident in ordering those books, then perhaps this opens the medium up from the domination it has been under to produce “superhero” books. Many of these titles have become so inbred that if you haven`t read a hundred issues you don`t have a clue what the hell you`re reading!\n\nI can`t prove this will work. I just know the Internet is opening new doors and venues. If I could see into the future, I guess I would know how to use that effectively to promote and sell the books, but remember, I`m primarily a storyteller, that`s what I`ve always been, and that hasn`t changed, so this is something totally new to me.\n\nIt`s difficult to get people to know you`re there in the vastness of Cyberspace.\n\nIt`s difficult to get people to know who don`t normally read comics that there might be books they`d really be interested in, if they knew they existed.\n\nBut how to get, let`s say, someone who really loves mystery fiction to know there`s a series of beautifully produced books like Detectives, Inc., with complex characters you can get involved with, in story-lines that are serious, but not without humor, visually exciting and evocatively rendered? I don`t have all the answers for that. But certainly, a site like Fandom/007Forever helps reach people, Matt, and makes it more accessible to know these books exist! If you love Bond, or ZORRO, or, to name a couple of my favorites, these days, Buffy or Xena, well, now you know there`s a place that you can go and get quality material on these characters. The same hopefully will apply to Detectives, Inc. and SABRE and Ragamuffins. These books cover a wide span, from heroic fantasy to private eyes to mainstream stories.\n\nThey are unique, and they are of singular vision, and I hope to do more of them.\n\nAnd meet more of those incredible fans who have been so supportive over the years. Thank God for them! They surprised a few editors over the years, let me tell you!\n\nMatt: What new projects are on your plate now?\n\nDon: I`m writing the daily ZORRO newspaper strip, which appears in the New York Daily New and the Houston Chronicle, among many other papers. I`ve just introduced the first major black characters in the ZORRO mythos in the strips–starting back in the middle of April 2000. The Definitive Ragamuffins is at two companies right now, and hopefully, we`ll have copies by the San Diego Comic Con [author`s note: It would be great to see a lot of Bond fans there as 007Forever staff and contributors are attending in July]. The new book includes a rough version of a twenty-page lost Ragamuffins story called “The Pack Rat Instinct”, which has never yet seen print! The fans will love it. It is all about the dear, sweetly absurd, all consuming need to collect that which you love! It`s as much a part of the fan as breathing. [I know Collectors` Corner fans at Forever can relate–Matt]\n\nI`m also working on a new Detectives, Inc. story entitled “A Fear of Perverse Photos”. Detective Bob Rainier`s opening line is, “Let me see if I`ve got this right, you want us to break into your apartment and steal all the pornographic photos you`ve printed off the Internet.” It`s a story that looks at this new phenomenon, how it affects everyday people, examines the different criteria for what is considered obscene and isn`t, and even looks at views on the afterlife and angels. Oh, and it also looks at the changing face of Manhattan. Has it really been changed? Could Dorothy now get off a bus at Port Authority with Toto, look around and sigh, “Jeez, Toto, we really still are in Kansas!”?\n\nBut I`ll be spending a lot of time and energy on the www.donmcgregor.com website, as well, promoting it, making sure people have a way to find the books if they haven`t found other sources. But I`ll be doing conventions as well. I`m due to be at the big Madison Square Garden convention with the people behind Pulp Adventures. I`ve just done an introduction for their first reprint of Johnston McCulley`s ZORRO pulp reprint stories. Plus, I have every intent to be at the San Diego Comic Con, as well.\n\nMatt: Do you have any tips for aspiring comix authors and artists?\n\nDon: I teach a course on “Writing For The Comics” at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, and that`s a question that starts every class. A short answer, and by no means a definitive one, is for the person to figure out what type of writer they want to be. You might as well start early, because you`re going to have to make that decision again and again, if you survive in this business. Remember, it`s your name that goes on the story! I`ve never had someone come up to me in all the years I`ve been signing books and say, “Don, the managing editor of the comic did this and made this story say this.” They come up and ask, “Why did you ?” and as long as you know the answer, and it is an answer you can live with, you`ll know that it is your story. They can`t take it from you.\n\nHang in there!\n\n–Many thanks to Don McGregor for taking the time to help prepare this special two-part story. Follow the links below to check out Part I of this interview and learn about the Bond Collectors` Weekends including Las Vegas `99 and New Orleans for Bond Weekend 2000 in September!\n\n**Check out:\n\nDonMcGregor.com\n\nZorro Productions\n\nZorro Strips: Daily Update\n\nWe at 007Forever are delighted to present this in-depth interview with Don McGregor, pioneer of independent authors` rights in comics and author of the glossy GoldenEye movie novelization in graphic novel form, and the in-depth Bond adventure The Quasimodo Gambit.\n\nWe hope this two-part interview will stimulate your questions for the upcoming chat with Don on Wednesday, June 14 at 007Forever. Don has a lot more of the scoop on comics, James Bond, “I Spy” and much, much more to share Wednesday starting at 9:00 p.m. E.S.T. — join us! One of the most popular writers at Marvel in the 1970`s, Don struck on his own to work with Paul Gulacy (yes, the Gulacy who created the visually stunning James Bond adventure Serpent`s Tooth) to publish SABRE, a graphic novel now in anniversary re-release. Later with Marshall Rogers of illustrated Batman fame, “Dauntless Don” struck again with a second graphic novel, Detectives, Inc. , (and again five years after that in a Detectives, Inc. mini-series with legendary artist Gene Colan).\n\nMcGregor started his writing career at Warren, scripting stories for Creepy and Eerie. Later, invited to Marvel, he wrote the cult-hit Killraven series in Amazing Adventures and acclaimed Black Panther stories in Jungle Tales. After he published SABRE and its follow-up on-going series from Eclipse, Don wrote two Nathaniel Dusk, P.I. mini-series for DC and then a Killraven graphic novel for Marvel. Don revisited the Black Panther in the pages of “Marvel Comics Presents” before landing the writing assignment for Topps Comics` revival of the legendary ZORRO.\n\nIn working with ZORRO Productions on the project, Don developed his take on the classic western hero by surrounding him with strong adversaries and interesting allies. In his analysis of the standard ZORRO motifs over the years, he came to the conclusion that ZORRO should have a strong female counterpart. Thus, Lady Rawhide was born. First appearing in ZORRO #3, Lady Rawhide (as illustrated by Mike Mayhew under a cover by Adam Hughes) rapidly became a fan favorite and she was spun off into her own mini-series.\n\nWhen Topps stopped publishing comics, both ZORRO and Don landed at Image Comics, which ZORRO Productions selected to publish their character`s adventures. Image is presently reprinting the second Lady Rawhide mini-series and trade paperback collections of the ZORRO stories, and they`re also re-publishing some of Don`s creator-owned work under their imprint. Don and artist Tom Yeates (they teamed up for ZORRO vs. Dracula) create the daily adventures of ZORRO for newspapers around the country including the New York Daily News. Don`s recently released 20th Anniversary Edition of SABRE garnered as much praise as it did originally, as did the re-release of Detectives, Inc. Now the second DI story, Detectives, Inc.: A Terror of Dying Dreams has been collected in trade paperback form for the first time. (All three should be available through your local comic book shop, and are available to them through Diamond Comic Distributors` STAR System.)\n\n–Don is also a wonderful guy who is passionate about the things he loves most; things like family and friends, the world of James Bond 007, ZORRO, Hopalong Cassidy, and communicating passionately to others through the unique medium of comix.\n\nMatt: Why did you choose to work in the comics industry?\n\nDon: Well, I`m not sure if I chose it or it chose me. Before I was writing comics, I actually was working on novels and films. I learned at an early age, once I got hold of my dad Francis McGregor`s 8mm Bolex movie camera, that if you wrote the script, and if you directed the film, and you acted in it, a number of great things happened:\n\n1. You always won the fights! And since, in those early 60`s days I was often doing some kind of a James Bond or private eye riff, well, this was terrific! It didn`t matter how big the guy was. He could give me a look and say, “Don, I can pound you into the ground. You know it and I know it.” But then, I`d just show him the script, and answer, “Well, sure, we both know that, but see, right here, in the script, it says, “I win!” So, here`s how we`re going to do it!” But even better was\n\n2. You ALWAYS got the girl! This was infinitely preferable to real life and I thought I would dedicate my life to it. We even rigged a briefcase to shoot out a torrent of white gas to take out one of the bad guys, in one of the films. Now, understand, I`m no technical whiz, and I don`t remember who came up with the way to pull this off, but we were filming up at my grandparents` house, Alfred and Marguerite Besson`s house, and they had a lot of land to play make believe in as if it was real. I played out a lot of fantasies there during my young years, rode a lot of invisible horses, you better believe it. Anyhow, my grandfather had a workshop there, and someone figured out how to hook up one of the old insecticide spray containers he had into that Bondian attache case, after the first attempt we`d made to gas the bad guy failed miserably! This time, as the villain opened the case, we pumped down on the canister and the white clouds shot out of the nozzle and engulfed him! It really worked! I don`t even want to give thought to what kind of stuff may have been inside the insecticide tank before we filled it with talcum powder!\n\nSome years later I actually created Detectives, Inc. as a film vehicle, for Alex Simmons and I to play the lead characters of Denning and Rainier. So, now finally, here comes the transition to comics. I`ve given you a few brief, hopefully scenic detours here. But before we ever got around to acting Rainier and Denning out, I`d gone to my first comic con. And something clicked!\n\nI was writing, as I`ve already mentioned, and I`d always loved comics, I just hadn`t really thought about writing them. But after meeting Alex Simmons at that New York City Comic convention, and after we started acting together, and coordinating our own fight sequences, something else clicked during the year until the next con.\n\nMatt: You mean, “Why not do a comic book?”\n\nDon: Alex was multi-talented, and at the time he did a lot of illustrating. It struck me that comics is considered a visual medium, even if, like film, it needs a written word, first. Comics are also a literary one, and that combination makes it truly unique as a medium. But, if you were going to get seen, if you were going to get read, how to do it?\n\nWell, you could write a script and send it. But the downside for writers is that an editor has submissions coming in and they end up in a stack. I talk about this a lot with my students in the course I teach at the School Of Visual Arts. You don`t want to get caught in that pile. Most editors seldom have time to go through those pages, and the higher the stack grows, the more intimidating it becomes.\n\nIf you`re an artist, you come in with samples of your art, and people can see right away whether they like it or not. They can say, “Hey, I like this, but this sucks!” And at least you have some feedback. But a writer, the first thing the editor sees is just a jumble of words on page upon page.\n\nSo, it was kind of like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, “LET`S PUT ON A SHOW!” and I said to Alex, “Let`s do Detectives, Inc. as a comic. Because I knew then that people could look at it, they could see that you had a grasp of the mechanics of comics, how words and pictures worked together, plus it did what I always wanted to do: TELL A STORY!\n\nAnd I loved comics. I have never thought they were a second rate medium. Yes, I was primarily focused on books and film, but that didn`t mean I didn`t have this passion for comics. From the first time I saw them, all the color and pictures and words, it was like discovering this incredible treasure. Years later, when I created Ragamuffins, I tried to capture what that love for comics was IN a comic itself.\n\nMatt: What appeals to you about being on a deadline with projects like ZORRO or James Bond, 007?\n\nDon: Deadline! What appeals to me about the deadline? Well, one writer once said, “You know, Don, there`s a reason why they call deadlines DEAD lines!” I think what you`re after is more the format that the story is going to told. So, for instance, in James Bond: The Quasimodo Gambit, once I know what the format is, in that case a three-issue mini-series, I more or less know the page count I am dealing with. I know I can approximate the structure of a novel, because I have the room. I know that I have to take into account where the books should break, so there is at once a sense of completeness to the books, that the reader has gotten something from that one book, but that it also flows into the next, and hopefully makes the audience want to know what happens to Bond and that cast of characters next.\n\nThat, by the way, is a much different kind of project than adapting a Bond film like “GoldenEye” for comics, in a three-issue “monthly” format. But more on that later.\n\nAnd still different, say, would be doing graphic albums, like Detectives, Inc.: A Rememberance of Threatening Green or A Terror of Dying Dreams. These are self-contained stories, but the page length is shorter, and you have to deal with that challenge. It`s as much a question of what won`t be in the story as much as what will make it.\n\nLike James Bond, I`ve done ZORRO in different formats. When I was doing the monthly comic series for Topps, I was always aware of the, more or less, 30-day time span between issues. This has a tremendous difference on the way you approach a story than, say, if it was published bi-monthly. Now that I`m doing the ZORRO newspaper strip there is always the constant reminder that another day has gone by. The upside of this is that there is a concrete re-enforcement of the story-telling. Every day, you hold the paper in your hand, you see the strip, and when it works, there`s that incentive to get you back to the blank sheet of paper. But the downside can be that it does appear every day, and if you haven`t written a day`s strip yet, it`s intimidating.\n\nOn top of that you have to face a whole different sort of choices and challenges as a storyteller. In a graphic novel, the audience gets the whole story at one time. The impact of the story and what happens to the characters and the thematic thrust of the story is immediate!\n\nBut a strip has an audience coming to it in different manners, and you have to be aware of this! Some people only get the Sunday paper, and thus they may only have exposure to what`s going on once a week, in that Sunday.\n\nOthers only read the paper during the week. Often, many buy it and read it on their way to work. So, I try to make sure the story can track from Sunday to Sunday, yet that there is never any repetition, because you have to be aware that in the long run, one day, those stories may be collected into a single volume, and then the story must flow seamlessly.\n\nOddly, what with all the horrendous lurid screaming headlines in the paper, one of the constant things you have to contend with is what someone might say, “Well, this can`t be in a family newspaper!” But that only seems to apply to the comics page. The fight is to tell a compelling story, one that has meaning, one that will move the audience. I try to make each day`s strip work singularly, but at the same time flow into the next. Yet, I`m not always trying to do the same thing with each strip. As varying as I will make the visual approach of each strip, from one panel to four, from silent to one just with captions, to those that are comprised of dialogue, I also want to have different emotions to the strip. Sometimes, I want the audience to laugh. Sometimes I want them to be moved by what they have read. Sometimes I just want to compel them to say, “Man, I can`t wait to see tomorrow`s paper and see what happens next!” If someone who buys only a Sunday paper, let`s say, said, “You know what, I`ve got to buy Monday`s paper, because I`ve got to see what happens to ZORRO next!” Well, I can`t think of a compliment that would mean more to me. And sometimes I want to jolt the audience.\n\nSometimes it`s the storytellers job to disturb. And if you are reading the daily newspaper, and you haven`t come across something that disturbs you, you aren`t really reading that newspaper, I`ll tell you that. In the Daily News, ZORRO is carried on the same page as Ann Landers. Ann`s column can have topics that deal with domestic violence, drugs, incest, you name it, but put that into a story with pictures, on the same page, and different eyes and with different agendas somehow are still of the mind that comics are a kid`s medium.\n\nWell, no! Comics are as varied a medium as books and film, and just like the best in those mediums, the best comics have a voice and strength that are uniquely their own! And then again, there`s another aspect about deadlines, they change from project to project. A Daily strip deadline is “always” there! It never changes.\n\n–Read Part II of this interview (linked below this story) and hear all about James Bond: The Quasimodo Gambit, James Bond: GoldenEye, and more!
