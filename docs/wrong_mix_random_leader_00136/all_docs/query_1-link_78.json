        "text": "“Mindscape is free to use and was a total passion project,\" says Cat Turner, co-founder and CCO at Cult.\n\n\"Developed in partnership with Mind we wanted to create a platform that targeted anxiety and depression. In these worrying and disorientating times we should all leverage every support tool available to stay positive. I am proud of the work that we did with Mind and hope Mindscape can continue to help combat anxiety and isolation in any way possible.”\n\nThe voice app talks people through relaxing breathing exercises, before asking them questions about their current emotional state. It can offer practical tips for managing work, money, education and sleep and also has bespoke soundscapes tailored to the person using the app.\n\n“Mind is delighted to have been working with Cult to develop Mindscape,\" says Lynette Charles, CEO of Mind.\n\n\"We must ensure that we continue to raise awareness within our communities, Mental Health is everyone’s business and we need to all reach out to our family, friends and colleagues. Around one in four of us will face a mental health problem every year, which makes apps like Mindscape so important.”\n\nYou can use Mindscape through your Amazon Alexa device at home. Download on Amazon Alexa here.\n\nOther apps include:\n\nHealthUnlocked Communities: One difficult part of dealing with any health issue is feeling isolated and alone. HealthUnlocked Communities wants to solve this. It’s like a social network of communities, linked by health. Different communities focus on different areas from exercise to anxiety. These communities provide a space for people to meet others going through similar issues, enabling them to receive emotional support in return. Charities and patient organisations monitor the different communities too, to ensure people are sharing the right information. Download on App Store.\n\nMoodrise: New wellness app Moodrise is all about ‘digital nutrition’: using positive content to help alleviate pain, boost emotional resilience and improve experiences. The app focuses on six popular mood states, including confidence, focus and happiness, and the related neurotransmitters that lead to that mood state. Content has been specifically created to help deliver the desired chemical reaction in the brain, backed by scientific research. The idea is that people can proactively manage their mental health through \"digital pills\" to help them enhance their own emotional resilience. Download on App Store and Google Play Store."
