Indeed, Modernism originally was not a period preceded by Victorianism or Edwardianism and followed by a period which we now denote as postModernism, but an ongoing tradition of experimentation in literature, dance, architecture, music, painting, sculpture, photography, and ﬁlm. If Modernism is considered the end of historical periods, the last gasp of history, what can come next? Because each period thinks of itself as in a state of crisis, Modernism is really not so much a period as a state of mind. To be sure, Modernist narrative is different in degree rather than kind from prior narratives. Its originality derives from building upon and at times transforming interior monologue, stream of consciousness, nineteenth-century journalism, psychoanalysis, and naturalism. Postmodernism’s audacious claims of originality and uniqueness not only recall the very claims of Modernism decades ago, but remind us that challenges to unity, fragmentation, radical disjunctions and inconsistency in point of view, multiple perspectives on reality, and moral paralysis reach back to Modernism. As in all my work from the past three decades, I stress in the following pages that literary works are by humans, about humans, and for humans, and I stress close reading within an historical contextual framework. I am interested in modes of narration and representation. A place is once again being cleared by scholars for literary criticism based on close reading even as 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nit is informed by – but not driven by – theoretical hypothesis. For me literary criticism means an empathetic reading of a text to discover the conscious and unconscious patterns of language that the text conveys to both the reading audience for whom it was written and the contemporary reader. Literary criticism necessarily depends on an awareness of what, in the transaction of reading, a particular reader does to a text. I seek a pluralistic approach which allows for multiple perspectives and a dialogic approach among those perspectives. Such a criticism leaves room for resistant readings – feminist, ethnic, and gay – without allowing the text to be appropriated by theoretical or political agendas. It means teaching our students that reading is an evolving process requiring attention to what the text is saying, to the structure of effects the text generates, and to how authors make conscious and unconscious choices to create their structures of effects. Novelists begin with their choice of material, often materials drawn from the real world in which they live, even if it is only their own interior reality; they then alter that material as they begin the process of transforming their raw material into ﬁction. As they do so – as that process takes place – they impose an appropriate form upon their material and decide how they should present it to an audience. Writing is thus how writers read the world; as Stephen Dedalus says in the “Proteus” episode of Ulysses, “Signatures of all things I am here to read.” An aesthetics of reading need account for changes in the way we read an author. In a sense, major novels change even though the author writes no more words. The interpretive history of a text is a dialogue among (1) the text as object which critics write about and readers think about; (2) the subjective interests of individual critics and ordinary readers; and (3) the predispositions and assumptions of the culture in which those critics write and readers live. The literary canon enriches itself because each generation brings something different to major authors and texts. As my teaching has evolved in response to changes in literary and cultural perspectives, the texts that I teach change with them. For example, until 1980 few critics thought about the homoeroticism of the male bonding in “The Secret Sharer”; now it is a foregrounded subject. Thus, in my edition of “The Secret Sharer” in the Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism series, every contributor took up the subject of homoeroticism in one way or another. I now see “The Secret Sharer” in the context of other works which focus on seeing and being seen, including James’s The Turn of the Screw and Mann’s Death in Venice, and also trace that focus back to the seminal nineteenth-century painter, Manet, and especially his Déjeuner sur l’herbe. The history of modern British and Irish novel criticism is a miniature of the history of Anglo-American criticism in the post-war period. Thus in the 2\n\nIntroduction\n\ncriticism of the 1950s and 1960s we see two major aspects of formalism: the New Criticism, a formalism that eschewed biography and reader’s response, and emphasized the isness of the text; and Aristotelian criticism, a formalism that stressed what we might call the doesness of the text – i.e. the structure of effects upon the reader as a result of the creation, consciously or unconsciously, by the author of these effects in the text. Until recent years, even under the auspices of those practicing the New Criticism and Aristotelian criticism, Anglo-American criticism of English ﬁction has in part derived from the very tradition of manners and morals that English ﬁction addresses. Perhaps from an historical perspective this criticism should be seen as a response to British and Irish ﬁction’s interest in content and its moral effects on readers. Thus Anglo-American criticism of British and Irish ﬁction has tended to focus on the moral context of texts, viewing aesthetic matters as subservient. We might recall how, in the face of great resistance, the study of English literature in the university emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from the classics and from philology. In the nineteenth century, one read vernacular literature in one’s own tongue for pleasure, but did not study it. Even then, if one studied modern literature at all, it was to establish canonical texts. Indeed, as late as the early 1960s, English studies at major universities in Britain and America resisted the acknowledgement of Modernism, a ﬁeld which began with the writers after Hardy and sometimes with Hardy and Hopkins. The tradition of close reading fostered by the New Criticism was particularly appropriate to Modernist texts which resisted easy understanding. To be sure, at times the New Criticism – whose philosophical underpinnings included the early critical essays of T. S. Eliot, himself an Anglo-Catholic, and his example of the religious poet and Anglican priest John Donne – may have been appropriated by some as a bulwark for bolstering orthodox religious values, but the emphasis was on powerful close reading of complex texts. Even if the New Critical readings were at times reductive efforts to resolve tension, irony, and ambiguity in overly positivistic and (w)holistic readings – readings in which the teleology of an organic whole mimed the organic “plot” of Christianity stretching from Genesis to Apocalypse – it was more often the case that the New Criticism was a secular and skeptical tool in the service of closely examining the words in a text. For example, in the hands of such practitioners as William Empson, the New Criticism was a method of seeing the need for opening the doors and windows of possibilities. The New Criticism and Aristotelian criticism installed the Kantian category of the aesthetic as central; the aesthetic ideal holds that artistic experience is different in kind from other experiences, and that art is not simply art-as-such, i.e. art as sociology or art as biography, but is unique in itself. 3\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccompanying the rise of English studies was the development of highly sophisticated modes of reading. Thus we can say that the aforementioned Anglo-American critical tradition has yielded an important theory and method. Indeed, did not the modern tradition – the tradition of Joyce, Conrad, James, and Woolf as well as the poets Yeats, Eliot, and Stevens – depend upon powerful close formalist reading, based on attention to the text as aesthetic object, to explicate the texts and to make them accessible to college and university students and other serious readers? Even when Anglo-American criticism through the 1980s is primarily interested in aesthetic issues, that criticism never really abandons humanism. Notwithstanding the modiﬁcations of Anglo-American criticism by the theoretical explosion in the last decades of the twentieth century, the lasting concerns of that criticism remain the accuracy, the inclusiveness, and the quality – the maturity and sincerity – of mimesis in the English novel. The special focus of this criticism has been and still is the way that ﬁctional characters live in imagined social communities. Indeed, Anglo-American criticism has usually subscribed to the view that art is about something other than art and that subject matter is important. To be sure, Anglo-American novel criticism takes seriously the importance of form, but its interest in form is inextricably tied to an interest in values. Anglo-American novel criticism believes that the doing – technique, structure, and style – is important because it reveals or discusses the meaning inherent in the subject. The differences that separate various strands of Anglo-American criticism – formalist and historical – prior to the theoretical revolution of the 1970s seem less signiﬁcant than they once did. Now we are able to see that the New Critics, Aristotelians, Partisan Review group, contextualists, and literary historians share a number of important assumptions: authors write to express their ideas and emotions; the way humans live and the values for which they live are of fundamental interest to authors and readers; literature expresses insights about human life and responses to human situations; and that is the main reason why we read, teach, and think about literature. While the emphasis varies from critic to critic, we can identify several concepts that deﬁne Anglo-American criticism in general, and we can see that until the theoretical revolution of the 1970s virtually all major critical voices shared similar humanistic assumptions: 1\n\n2\n\n4\n\nThe form of the novel – style, structure, and narrative technique – expresses its value system. Put another way: form discovers the meaning of content. A work of literature is also a creative gesture of the author and the result of historical context. Understanding the process of imitating the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nexternal world gives us an insight into the artistry and meaning of the work. A novel imitates a world that precedes the text, and the critic should recapture that world primarily by formal analysis of the text, although knowledge of the historical context and author is often important. Humanistic criticism believes that there is an original meaning, a center, which can be approached by, and often almost reached by, perceptive reading. The goal is to discover what authors said to their intended audience then, as well as what they say to us now. Acts of interpretation at their best – subtle, lucid, inclusive, perceptive – can bring that goal into sight. Human behavior is central to most works, and should be the major concern of analysis. In particular, these critics are usually interested in how people behave – what they fear, desire, doubt, need. Although modes of characterization differ, the psychology and morality of characters must be understood as if they were real people, for understanding others like ourselves helps us to understand ourselves. The inclusiveness of the novel’s vision in terms of depth and range is a measure of the work’s quality.\n\nFollowing Wayne Booth’s eloquent insistence on asking “who is speaking to whom” and “for what purpose,” scholars of the novel focused in the 1960s and 1970s on the narrator, not only on the role of such ﬁgures as Marlow in the turn-of-the-century works such as “Youth,” Heart of Darkness, and Lord Jim and the later Chance, as well as the captain narrator’s act of telling in “The Secret Sharer” and The Shadow Line, but also on the complex omniscient narrators that we ﬁnd in the texts of Hardy, Forster, Woolf, Joyce, and Lawrence. The theoretical explosion of the 1980s and 1990s has dramatically reshaped the way we read the modern British and Irish novel. Bakhtin’s The Dialogic Imagination has given us better tools to discuss pluralistic perspectives in ﬁction and taught us to be attentive to a novel as a dialogue among perspectives. In the wake of new historicism’s return to mimesis and the implications of representation, cultural criticism needs to enter into a dialogue with older forms of contextualism. While trained as a formalist, I have always regarded literary texts as cultural artifacts. In my books such as Reconﬁguring Modernism: Explorations in the Relationship between Modern Art and Modern Literature (1997) and The Case for a Humanistic Poetics (1991), I have advocated a wider cultural criticism that moves beyond micropolitical and macropolitical issues and includes inquiries into such cultural conﬁgurations as the relation among Picasso, Joyce, and Wallace Stevens in the genealogy of Modernism 5\n\nIntroduction\n\nand how our understanding of each of them depends on seeing them as a cultural triptych. We need think about why and how readers choose the critical narratives they do at a given time. I am interested in these choices as interpretive history, as products of socioeconomic forces, and as a history of individual values and temperaments. A dialogue between the neglected underbelly of socioeconomic forces – including micropolitical relations within genders and suppressed classes – and the dominant paradigm of intellectual and social history will necessarily create new, multi-layered cultural and literary history as well as vigorous analyses of what texts represent. For example, when we understand the homoerotic nature of male bonding among the Malay warrior culture, the suicide of Jim in Lord Jim becomes not only Jim’s abandonment of Jewel but his ritualistic acceptance of punishment for violating a consummated intimacy with Dain Waris. Rather than a noun that names positions, cultural criticism needs to be thought of as a verb, as a process of inquiring, teaching, and reading. Cultural criticism needs to address the category of the aesthetic and its relationship to the political and the ethical. Now that literary studies has returned since the late 1980s or so to a criticism that focuses on contexts, we need also ask what is the place of the aesthetic in cultural criticism? Why do we ﬁnd some works beautiful, moving, and pleasing; and why do we respond to the quality and integrity of mimesis – the way the parts of a work are uniﬁed – as well as to other formal ingredients of a work, including narrative voice, verbal texture, and characterization? How can we speak of ethical and political value without surrendering the value of the aesthetic? We do not have to subscribe to the view that all art is a separate ontology, its value intrinsic to itself, to ask how we can maintain a place for the aesthetic. Reading the Modern British and Irish Novel explicitly and implicitly proposes the ingredients for a humanistic cultural criticism that has a place for the aesthetic. A humanistic cultural criticism seeks to deﬁne cultural conﬁgurations that go beyond positivistic inﬂuence studies, and to re-create the economic, social, and political world that the authors inhabit. It tries to deﬁne an awareness of the cultural position of the critic and to understand interpretive history as a history of awareness – of aesthetic assumptions, political interests, world views – but also as an idiosyncratic history of individual critics. It seeks a dialogue among various social, economic, and historical factors, between literature and history, between literature and the arts. It tries to operate in a dialogic manner but insists on retaining a place for the aesthetic. I argue for a cultural criticism which explores similarities that go beyond the borderlines between art forms and between national literatures. At the 6\n\nIntroduction\n\nsame time as Modernists were making similar experiments in ﬁction, Picasso was embarking on Cubism – on scrambling the distinction between foreground and background, on freeing color from the morphology of representation, and on including multiple perspectives on the same subject. Do we not need more courses that juxtapose paintings such as Matisse’s 1910 Dance II and its sequel Music – with their vermilion ﬁgures, blue skies, and green hills – not merely to major texts of British and Irish literature but to roughly contemporary texts of other literatures, such as Mann’s Death in Venice (1912)? My discussions take account of recent developments in theory and cultural studies, including post-colonial, feminist, gay, and ecological perspectives, and show how reading the modern British and Irish novel has changed in the face of the theoretical explosion since the early 1980s. While still a formalist interested in the inextricable relationship of form and content within an imagined ontology, I stress the historical and theoretical framework a bit more than I once did. In each of my readings, I test some of the claims of recent theory, even while articulating the humanistic poetics that underlie my entire critical project for over three decades.\n\nII Cultural and Historical Contexts: Modernism in Literature and Art The experiments in technique and theme of Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, D. H. Lawrence, and E. M. Forster – as well as T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, and such European counterparts as Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka – parallel the challenges to mimesis of Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Paul Klee. Their experiments in color, line, space, and abandonment of representation provided a model for writers who challenged traditional narrative linearity and concepts of lyric. My own story of Modernism is a quarry of memories, recollections, images, and metaphors. This seems appropriate for a tradition that is part elegy, part nostalgia for a time before the fault line between present and past, and part a self-conscious enactment, like Picasso’s collages, of fragmentation. Modernism in painting took diverse paths. Cubism fractured objects into component planes and dramatized diverse perspectives which the perceiver would be able to reconstruct into the object in space as the painter had imagined it. Surrealists, such as Max Ernst and Giorgio De Chirico, sought to tap the irrational world of dreams and the unconscious. Ernst was interested 7\n\nIntroduction\n\nin presenting chance meetings and remote realities in a plane that was, according to conventional expectations, unsuitable to those objects. Theo Van Doesburg in Art Concrete called for art that was impersonal in execution and based on scientiﬁc or mathematical data. Indeed, Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes – notably in his book Du Cubisme – related Cubism to Einstein’s idea of relativity, a fourth dimension, and Modernist notions of simultaneity of perception. While nineteenth-century realists and naturalists hold nature to be the center of the universe, various symbolists – anti-materialistic, anti-positivistic – rejected rules of reason while exalting feeling, dreams, and mystery. Symbolists followed Schopenhauer, who believed that everything is an inﬁnite succession of transitory phenomena. Modernism sought new ways of doing what art always does: sharing the immediacy of artistic experience in an effort to connect oneself to the rest of the world. Neither Picasso nor Matisse ever abandoned ﬁgure representation. Both held to the belief that art has access to the world; yet their art calls attention to their awareness of the ﬁctionality of art. Art represents – signiﬁes an a priori signiﬁed, perhaps a vision of the self or of others and/or of an anterior place and time – but does not copy its subject. Modern art depends on two forms of essentialism. First, often modern art self-consciously and knowingly uses a web of signs – that is, not the artist’s original perceptions but a condensation and intensiﬁcation that transforms what the artist sees into the essential nature of things; that condensation is mediated by conventions and, often, by a sense of audience expectations. Do we not think of Eliot’s objective correlative when the art critic John Elderﬁeld discusses Matisse’s technique? “The mental image he is painting condenses not the appearance of the subject but the feeling it evokes in him. The painted image that results will therefore correspond to that mental image – will become a transposed, realized form of that mental image – only when it evokes the same emotions that the subject itself did originally.”1 Second, following Romantic antecedents, Modernism often embraced the view that the response to the nature of things needs to be personal and engaged – a mixture of what the mind perceives and what it creates. We must not look for reductive consistency in our narrative of Modernism. Modernism depends on the interpretive intelligence of a reader’s perspective. We need to look at the assumption that form discovers meaning from a postmodern point of view that is open to destabilizing such an assumption. But we also need to try to understand the world of modern authors and painters by responding to how they intervene, intersect, transform, and qualify the culture in which they are a part, and how they do so with an intense belief in the inextricable relationship between form and content.\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs Charles Altieri notes, Although the Modernist poets and painters worried a good deal about history as a general phenomenon, for the most part they had little interest in the speciﬁc texture of their own historical moment. Theirs was a lonely and, ultimately, self-regarding art, more concerned for the intensity and clarity of its constructed sites than for the social world out of which the sites were made, and to which they had to return for their validation.2\n\nLacking preconceived metaphysics, Modernism understands artistic creation as self-discovery. The playwright David Mamet once remarked, “What you say inﬂuences the way you think, the way you act, not the other way around.”3 The very act of writing the word, painting the canvas, carving the stone – all these formal processes shape the way the artists think and act. Modernism is a response to cultural crisis. By the 1880s we have Nietzsche’s Gay Science (1882–7) with his contention that God is dead as well as KrafftEbing’s revolutionary texts on sexuality; we also have the beginnings of modern physics in the work of J. J. Thomson. All challenged absolutist theories of truth. Let us also recall that Origin of Species appeared in 1859 and Essays and Reviews, which questioned the Bible as revealed history, in 1860. In the period from 1865 to 1870, Karl Marx began to publish Das Kapital, Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, while Otto Von Bismarck and Benjamin Disraeli dominated Europe and colonialism expanded its reach. Modernism is paradoxically both an ideology of possibility and hope – a positive response to difﬁcult circumstances – and an ideology of despair – a response to excessive faith in industrialism, urbanization, so-called technological progress, and the Great War of 1914 to 1918, called for a time the “War to End All Wars.” Notwithstanding some notable exceptions, such as Woolf ’s To the Lighthouse and Between the Acts, the Great War is the absent signiﬁer in much of the literature and art from 1914 to well into the 1920s. What does Claude Monet’s obsession with water lilies in 1917–18 tell us about his historical sense and the position of the artist? Is the presence of the classical in Eliot and Joyce a response to the disorder and chaos of the war? In 1922, the year of The Waste Land and Ulysses, Jean Cocteau’s version of Sophocles’ Antigone – a play set in the aftermath of war – was put on in Paris with sets by Picasso. Yet where is the Great War in either Eliot or Joyce? And what do Stevens, Matisse, and Picasso have to say about the Holocaust? As Paul Fussell writes in The Great War and Modern Memory, “It was a hideous embarrassment to the prevailing Meliorist myth which had dominated the public consciousness for a century. It reversed the idea of Progress.”4 Yet it is well to\n\n9\n\nIntroduction\n\nremember that Arnold’s “Dover Beach” (1859, 1867) speaks of a world without “certitude, nor peace, nor love, nor light” where “ignorant armies clash by night.” In “The Darkling Thrush” (1900), using ironically the traditional Romantic image of the bird’s association with poetry, song, and joy (as in Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale,” Shelley’s “To a Sky-Lark,” Hopkins’s “The Windhover”), Hardy grimly sees the departing century as a skeleton and imagines the thrush throwing itself upon the gloom. Both Hardy and Arnold anticipate the angst and dubiety of Eliot. In response to the Great War, Matisse’s paintings became more disciplined and less decorative. One might say he responded to despair by ﬁnding hope in the formal solutions of his art. Compare the sensuality of The Red Studio (1911) with The Piano Lesson (1916); as Kenneth Silver writes of the latter, “[Its] narrow horizontal band of arabesques formed by the continuous frieze of the music stand and the balustrade and, at his right, . . . a tiny Matisse bronze of a lounging nude . . . tauntingly suggests the sensual fulﬁllment and [aesthetic ﬂights]” of Matisse’s past works.5 Yet The Piano Lesson owes much to the formal rigor of Cubism; Matisse redid it as the less abstract The Music Lesson (1917). Picasso reverted to pre-Cubist themes and representation. Note that Matisse and Picasso exhibited jointly at Galerie Paul Guillaume in 1918, as if, in celebration of the war’s end, they would, at least temporarily, suspend their lifelong rivalry. Modernism, as James Clifford notes, takes “as its problem – and opportunity – the fragmentation and juxtaposition of cultural values.”6 Isn’t Modernism a search for informing principles that transcend cultures as well as a recognition of both the diversity and continuity of culture? Modernism sought to ﬁnd an aesthetic order or historic pattern to substitute for the crumbling certainties of the past. Yet at the same time Modernists were aware that the order was elusive – as Eliot put it, fragments to shore against the ruins of their present lives. Certainly Ulysses, where Joyce describes a paciﬁstic, humanistic, urban, family-oriented Jew whose adventures take place within the space of his mind, ﬁnds cohesion in both aesthetic order and cultural continuity. Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon – with its ethnographic masks in a European brothel fronted by a still life – afﬁrms a delicate balance between tradition and innovation, between the quest for order and inchoate forces of anarchy and misrule within the work. Yet within each of these seminal texts are strands of irony and disunity, for the fragmentation – the 18 techniques in Ulysses, the breakdown of representation and perspective in Les Demoiselles – undermine the possibility of a unilateral perspective giving shape and coherence to a single vision. Modernism goes beyond previous cultures in engaging otherness and questioning Western values. As Clifford notes, in 1900 “ ‘Culture’ referred to 10\n\nIntroduction\n\na single evolutionary process.” He articulates an important aspect of Modernism: The European bourgeois ideal of autonomous individuality was widely believed to be the natural outcome of a long development, a process that, although threatened by various disruptions, was assumed to be the basic, progressive movement of humanity. By the turn of the century, however, evolutionist conﬁdence began to falter, and a new ethnographic conception of culture became possible. The word began to be used in the plural, suggesting a world of separate, distinctive, and equally meaningful ways of life. The ideal of an autonomous, cultivated subject could appear as a local project, not a telos for all humankind.7\n\nModernism contains the aspirations and idealism of nineteenth-century high culture and the prosaic world of nineteenth-century city life; both are colored by an ironic and self-conscious awareness of limitation. Often convictions are framed by or within an ironic stance, an awareness of the difﬁculty of fulﬁlling possibility. Prior to Modernist questioning, the possibility of a homogeneous European culture existed. As Elderﬁeld puts it, “history was not always thought to be quite possibly a species of ﬁction but once comprised a form of order, and might still.”8 In “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” Eliot wrote that tradition meant writing with an historical sense that compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order . . . No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His signiﬁcance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism.9\n\nModernism is inclusive, containing both the aestheticism and complexity of high culture, the straightforwardness and earthiness of working-class culture, and an ironic awareness of its own self-consciousness. Just as writers like Thomas Hardy and D. H. Lawrence not only include the working class, agrarian workers, and miners but focus on their lives and aspirations, Modernist painters focus on the vernacular in painting – Cézanne’s card players, Degas’s laundresses, Picasso’s whores, café life, and circus performers. Yet writers such as William Butler Yeats, Joyce, and Lawrence also believed in the power of art and in the artist as visionary prophet. Indeed, Yeats and Lawrence 11\n\nIntroduction\n\nﬂirted with totalitarianism, and Ezra Pound embraced it. Joyce believed that he – the artist hero – along with his humanistic, paciﬁstic, family-oriented, secular Jew Bloom, could be the heir to Charles Parnell as the hero that Ireland required. Justifying the Dadaists and his own retreat to Zurich during World War I, Hans Arp wrote, “We were seeking an art based on fundamentals, to cure the madness of the age, and a new order of things that would restore the balance between heaven and hell.”10 Yeats and Joyce derived from an Irish tradition which believed in the power of art; it believed that artists could become possessed by inspirational forces and reveal hidden truths. Phillip Marcus argues, “As seers, the bards had direct access to ideal images. Viewed historically, those images were to be found in the past, closer in time to the Edenic or pre-lapsarian state, and in sacred texts where they had been embodied by bardic predecessors and preserved through a tenaciously conservative tradition.”11 Modernism is often a dialogue between Platonism and empiricism. In contrast to Eliot’s empiricism, one strand of Modernism – what we might call the Platonic strain – believes in the power of art to reveal higher truths, invisible reality. Yeats, a Neoplatonist, felt that Joyce and Pound were seduced and enslaved by whatever happened to enter their minds. For Yeats, whom we now categorize as a Modernist, Modernism often meant values he ostentatiously rejected: positivistic science, Newtonian physics, pragmatism, democracy, and a kind of naturalism he abhorred. Rather naively, Yeats articulated a credo of purity of mind and ascetic contemplation; he mourned the gradual loss since the eighteenth century of an organic community and a systematic world view. He would have agreed with Klee: “Today the reality of visible objects has been revealed and the belief has been expressed that, in relation to the universe, the visible is only an isolated case and that other truths exist and are in the majority.”12 Modern painting is a journey toward abstraction; yet abstraction expresses meaning, and often – as Kandinsky argued in Concerning the Spiritual in Art – transcendental ideas. He believed that contemporary humans had lost their ability to see the spiritual and that his art could awaken dormant imaginative, intuitive, and inspirational powers. Abstraction was often part of the Symbolist movement, which sought to go beyond traditional representation to create higher realities and discover cosmic order. As Pepe Karmel writes, “The Symbolists rejected the scientiﬁc rationalism of late 19th-century society. Instead they sought new sources of faith, turning to pagan myth, Oriental religion and the childlike, uncritical Christianity of peasants. Or they decided that the real truth of human nature lay in the instinctual drives toward death and reproduction.”13 Kandinsky was inﬂuenced by Paul Gauguin’s primitivism and mystical imagery and by Matisse’s freeing color from naturalism and his 12\n\nIntroduction\n\noutlined forms. Kandinsky was interested in synesthesia, the interrelationship between senses, and wanted to create a total art work, Gesamtkunstwerk, integrating painting, theater, music, and poetry. Inﬂuenced by Scriabin, he wrote The Yellow Sound (Der Gelbe Klang); he used colored lights: yellow is a “worldly color,” while blue signiﬁes spirituality. Like Diaghilev’s Russian ballets, Matisse’s Dance and Music are efforts to integrate painting, dance, and music. One cannot cite an exact moment when color and form begin to share with subject the focus of painting. When we see Vincent Van Gogh’s La Salle de danse à Arles (1888), we know something has happened and that explosive blocks of color, seething dynamic line, the material and energy of paint have changed the very nature of painting. Painting expands inﬁnitely until one subject is paint, whether it is Camille Pissarro’s layering or Monet’s experiments with light. When reading literature we always recuperate the word into subject. Yet, in modern painting, too, the stress on formal experimentation and stylistic innovation does not overwhelm the centrality of the subject: even such an abstract painter as Klee believed in the centrality of the human subject. Finally, for Klee, “Art does not render the invisible; it renders the visible.”14 Imagism in its effort to catch the response to experience at an intense moment parallels Impressionism – recall that Monet was already painting his water lilies in 1912 to 1914 – and in its formal rigor, precision, and effort to achieve objectivity parallels Postimpressionism. In his 1913 manifesto, Ezra Pound called for hardness (“Direct treatment of the ‘thing,’ whether subjective or objective”), exactness (“To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation”), and cadence (“As regarding rhythm; to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of the metronome”).15 In Pound’s two-line poem “In a Station of the Metro,” he juxtaposes his response to an experience with an image that renders it: “The apparition of these faces in the crowd / Petals, on a wet, black bough.” The poem evaluates and structures the experience as an epiphanic moment of revelation for the speaker. In the characteristic Modernist way, it is a poem about looking. Even if the ﬁrst time we read from left to right and down the page, we can choose in these short poems – as a kind of exercise in seeing – to let our eye rove on the page to discover other patterns. Our memories of texts, particularly short texts, are rarely in narrative order but usually are partly visual, even if the visual may have the distortions of dreamscapes. Modernist texts such as Ulysses, The Secret Agent, Mrs Dalloway, The Waste Land, and “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” show the intricate network that holds together the modern city. The city – and the texts about the city – rescues space from neutrality, laying invisible tracks of human connection, even while highlighting terrible moments of marginalization, isolation, and loneliness. The self is cut loose from its spiritual attachments, often from 13\n\nIntroduction\n\nfamily, and from a common place, such as a village or a piece of land. The Jews – embraced by Joyce, rejected by Eliot and Pound – become an image of the deracinated, rootless self. Eliot’s pejorative image of the Jew in Gerontion is the obverse of Bloom: the jew squats on the window sill, the owner, Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp, Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London.\n\nModernism responded to modern urban culture. As Conrad and Eliot – and Dickens before them – saw, the city can be huge, drab, dirty. When Eliot writes in “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” of half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster shells,\n\nhe asks us to recompose the city’s fragments into our mental neighborhood. The vast interconnections of elaborate canvases with their separate neighborhoods, such as Moroccans and Guernica – or Eliot’s “Prufrock” and The Waste Land – as well as novels with one-word titles that imply pulling together vast networks of relationships, such as Ulysses and Nostromo, may be the result of living in cities or imagining the city as a labyrinth. Such large canvases and texts are pulled together by a willful and often visionary overview. While leaving the city to experience cultural otherness and difference, Matisse, and Gauguin before him, never left its imaginative environs. Underneath Gauguin’s Tahitian paintings and Matisse’s Moroccan paintings is the wish to resolve the difference, diversity, busyness, and commotion of urban life into a uniﬁed and even reductive picture.\n\nIII Modern Art as Quest for Order Modernism stressed cultural and personal fragmentation and sought techniques to express this idea. Emphasizing how each of us is changing every moment, Henri Bergson wrote in Creative Evolution,\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuration is the continuous progress of the past which gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances . . . The piling up of the past upon the past goes on without relaxation. In reality, the past is preserved by itself, automatically. In its entirety, probably, it follows us at every instant; all that we have felt, thought, and willed from our earliest infancy is there, leaning over the present which is about to join it, pressing against the portals of consciousness that would fain leave it outside.16\n\nBergson continues: “What are we in fact, what is our character, if not the condensation of the history we have lived from our birth?”17 Note the parallel to Bakhtin’s concept that when each of us speaks or writes, our prior systems of language voluntarily and involuntarily manifest themselves in a heteroglossic voice. Given the multiplicity and ever-changing nature of self, each of us has multiple selves and points of view; that shared perception of Modernism is a cause of the dramatized consciousness of James and Conrad, Joyce’s diverse techniques in Ulysses, and the development of Cubism. Is there not a continuity between Oscar Wilde’s concept of lying and Henri Bergson’s concept of duration in their mutual effort to transform the tick-tock of passing time – what the Greeks called chronos – into signiﬁcant time or kairos? As a way of trying to transcend time Wilde, hounded for his homosexuality, created in The Picture of Dorian Gray a mask – an invented lie – of the aesthete and decadent who ﬂouts conventions of society. Indeed, Wilde poignantly did the same in his own life.18 Painters, too, search in the forms of art for a coherent identity. In Notes of A Painter, a text begun in November 1908, Matisse wrote, “Underlying this succession of moments which constitutes their superﬁcial existence of being and things, and which is continually modifying and transforming them, one can search for a truer, more essential character, which the artist will seize so that he may give reality a more lasting impression.”19 We see the obsessive presence of the past in Matisse’s paintings, but in The Red Studio – full of references to his prior work – we also see the promise of the future in the plant as well as in the crayons and pencils that will be used to create a work of art. The clock without hands suspends time while paradoxically calling attention to the perpetual presence of time, and expresses an awareness that clock time is an arbitrary measurement imposed by humans. Such selfconsciousness about the self as an artist, revealed as self-referentiality, is characteristic of Modernism. It is a feature of Eliot’s and Stevens’s poetry and is exempliﬁed by the continuity of Marlow and Stephen Dedalus in the works of Conrad and Joyce. Thus in the “Scylla and Charybdis” chapter of Ulysses, Joyce calls attention to the presence of Shakespeare the artist in the latter’s\n\n15\n\nIntroduction\n\nartistic creations as a way of teaching us how to read Stephen as a surrogate of Joyce in his epic novel. It was until recently argued that Matisse and Picasso represent diverse streams of Modernism. Never far from the here and now or from bourgeois desires, Matisse wanted, we thought, always to maintain a dialogue with and response to nature, while Picasso sought to show that the imagination could do what it wished when it wished. Yet as the recent Picasso–Matisse exhibition in London, Paris, and New York showed, these distinctions hold no more than those formerly applied to the following pairs of writers: Lawrence and Joyce, Eliot and Stevens, E. M. Forster and Woolf – with the second member of each pair emphasizing the independence of art from representation. Yet in some ways the Modernists thought of themselves as essentialists and often tried to insulate art from history and even to apotheosize the aesthetic. While aestheticism is an ironic comment on materialism, it is also another form of essentialism. Why did so many Modernists recuse themselves from the Great War and from history itself, while ﬁnding refuge in inner systems, fantasy versions of politics, or art as fetish? Modernism’s focus on the past can be a way of eschewing present-day politics and history. At times the retreat to art is an escape from history and leads to a kind of historical myopia. In Death in Venice Mann analyzes the necessary relationship between the two. Among other things, Death in Venice, Metamorphosis, and The Death of Ivan Ilych are about the impossibility of escaping history. The effort to eschew history by Matisse, Picasso, Stevens, and Eliot has been ironized by history. That the present is a relentless fury is an important Modernist theme; yet, paradoxically, at times Modernists have a myopic view of the past. Mann dramatizes how Aschenbach idiosyncratically turns myth and history into versions of his own life; Mann weaves a perspective in which Aschenbach, imagining himself to be Socrates, inevitably is caught in the web of his own making. In his understanding of how we myopically turn the subjective into seemingly objective reality, Mann provides a postmodern critique on Modernism. Yet paradoxically – and inevitably – he does the very thing he critiques in Aschenbach; he creates a myth out of his own experience. Indeed, he is an ironic Dedalus, a maker of his own labyrinth. For the great Modernists, art was a quest; as Jack Flam writes of Matisse and Cézanne, “great painting was not merely a matter of stylization and technique but the result of deeply held convictions about vision in relation to life.”20 While the impulse to make oneself the subject of one’s own art includes Rembrandt’s self-portraits, the impulse crystallized in the nineteenth century with Courbet’s L’Atelier (1854–5) – known as the “Real Allegory Determining a Phase of Seven Years of my Artistic Life” – with its intense focus 16\n\nIntroduction\n\non Courbet at work. In the middle of that painting is a godlike Courbet with a model – if I may quote Julian Barnes, “reinventing the world. And perhaps this helps answer the question of why Courbet is painting a landscape in his studio rather than en plein air: Because he is doing more than reproducing the known, established world, he is creating it himself. From now on, the painting says, it is the artist who creates the world rather than God.”21 Does not this description recall Stephen’s argument about what the artist does in the “Scylla and Charybdis” section of Ulysses, and remind us of how Eliot’s artist creates order from cultural and personal fragments? To suggest his own biographical relationship to Ulysses, Joyce has Stephen propose his expressive theory of the relationship between Shakespeare’s art and life. What makes Shakespeare a man of genius is that he encompassed in his vision the “all in all in all of us” (IX, 1049–50).22 Joyce re-creates Shakespeare according to his own experience of him, and thus becomes the father of his own artistic father and the artist whose imagination is so inclusive and vast that it contains the “all in all” of Shakespeare plus the very substantial addition – or, in current terminology, the supplement – of his own imagination. Like Joyce, Shakespeare used the details of everyday life for his subject: “All events brought grist to his mill” (IX, 748). The major creative artist discovers in his actual experience the potential within his imagination: “He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible” (IX, 1041–2). To activate that potential, the artist must have as wide a range of experience as possible; to get beyond the limitations of his own ego in order to achieve the impersonality and objectivity that is necessary for dramatic art, his imagination must have intercourse – and the sexual metaphor is, I think, essential to understanding Joyce’s aesthetic – with the world: “His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral” (IX, 432–3). Joyce, like Mann, is aware of the irony of his youthful artist comparing himself to the master artist or thinker. Joyce’s relationship to Stephen in “Scylla and Charybdis” reaches a turning point when he twice penetrates Stephen’s mind to show him brieﬂy imposing dramatic form upon his experience by using the traditional typography of plays to organize his monologue (Ulysses, IX, 684ff, 893ff ). In the second and longer instance, a play that lasts little more than a page, Stephen is the major character speaking to his friends about the same issues he has been discussing throughout the chapter. And the entire chapter puts the argument about the relationship between the author’s life and his work in the form of a virtual monodrama. If, according to Stephen’s theory, Shakespeare’s transparently disguising his identity in his early work foreshadows A Portrait of the Artist, the more subtle disguises of biography in Hamlet anticipate the technique of Ulysses. 17\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nChapter 1\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”: The Transformation of the British and Irish Novel, 1890–1930\n\nI\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art stands Rodin’s large 1897 statue, Monument to Balzac. The imposing ﬁgure of Balzac is 10 feet tall, and it rests on a 5-foot-high slab. At ﬁrst, the observer may wonder what this seemingly realistic piece is doing in the citadel of Modernism. But gradually one realizes that the work is a crystallizing image of Modernism, for it depicts the artist as outcast and hero. Towering above onlookers, Balzac is wearing an expression of scornful magisterial dignity. With back stifﬂy yet regally arched past a 90-degree angle, Balzac looks into the distance and the future as if oblivious and indifferent to the opinions of the Lilliputians observing him from below. The large mustache, massive brows, ﬂowing hair, and enormous ears and nose all emphasize the ﬁgure’s immense physical stature. As observers we crane our necks to see the features of this commanding ﬁgure whose gigantic head is disproportionate to his body. His features are boldly outlined but not precisely modeled. His huge head dominates the massive form; the body enwrapped in a cloak is a taut cylinder; the only visible feature is the feet, which are in motion as if they were going to walk off the slab. Indeed, one foot actually overhangs the slab as if it were about to depart. In the geometric shape of an isosceles triangle, the intimidating ﬁgure asserts the dependence of content upon form. 18\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nIn a number of ways this sculpture, I think, helps us to understand literary Modernism. Rodin has presented the artist as an Übermensch, as a physical and moral giant who is indifferent to the opinions of his audience. He depicts Balzac the way Rodin would have liked to see himself: “I think of [Balzac’s] intense labor,” he wrote, “of the difﬁculty of his life, of his incessant battles and of his great courage. I would express all that.”1 As Albert E. Elsen remarks, “Rodin has transformed the embattled writer into a godlike visionary who belongs on a pedestal aloof from the crowd.”2 Rodin’s presence in the sculpture of Balzac speaks for art as self-expression, and thus declares a new aesthetic that questions the impersonality and objectivity that Balzac sought in his role of moral and social historian of the human comedy. Rodin’s Balzac is not someone who serves the community but someone who answers to the demands of his own imagination and psyche; he does not imitate reality, but transforms what he sees into something original. He is more a visionary than a realist. His integrity derives from his genius and his independence. The sculpture shows, too, the inseparable relationship between subject and object – the poised tension between content (Balzac) and form (the original stone) – that is central to Modernism. Finally, Rodin understands that art requires an audience to complete the hermeneutical circle, for he declared that the suggestiveness of his Balzac required the viewer to use “the imagination to recompose the work when it is seen from close up.”3 I would like to take the Rodin statue as a point of departure for speaking of the great change in major British and Irish ﬁction from the realistic to the expressionist novel, a change that begins roughly in 1895, the year of Thomas Hardy’s last novel, Jude the Obscure, and reaches a climax with Virginia Woolf ’s major novels, Mrs Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927). That some or all of the great British and Irish Modernists – Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, E. M. Forster, and Woolf – withdraw from their work, eliminate the intrusive author, and move to objectivity and impersonality is still one of the shibboleths of literary history. In this chapter I shall argue that by making themselves their subject they have, in fact, created a more subjective, self-expressive novel than their predecessors, and that they are present in their works. Inﬂuenced by English Romanticism, developments in modern art, and a changing intellectual milieu that questioned the possibilities of universal values or objective truth, these novelists erased the boundaries between art and life. They no longer believed that they could or should re-create the real world in their art, and they questioned the assumption that verisimilitude was the most important aesthetic value. They realized that each person perceives a different reality and lives in what F. H. Bradley has called a “closed circle.”4 Thus, while mid-Victorian novelists believed in the efﬁcacy of their art, 19\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\ntwentieth-century writers have often despaired at the possibility of communication. They wrote not only to urge their perspectives upon their audience but to create their own identities and values. On the one hand, artists doubt that they can change the world but, on the other, they try to convince themselves and their audience that they can. Twentieth-century British and Irish writers invent ways of seeing the human psyche in a more subtle and complex manner than prior writers had. While the Victorian novel focused upon people in their social aspect, Conrad, Lawrence, Joyce, and Woolf isolate their characters from the social community by focusing on the perceiving psyche. As J. Hillis Miller has noted, there is little self-consciousness in most Victorian novels: “the protagonist comes to know himself and to fulﬁll himself by way of other people.”5 But the English novel from 1890 to 1930 made self-consciousness and self-awareness its subject, and the stream of consciousness within the soliloquy and interior monologue – both direct and indirect – became more prominent. Since characters are often versions of the author who either cannot or does not achieve the traditional distance between author and characters, the experience and self-consciousness of the characters reﬂect those of the authors. In traditional novels we are more conscious of the characters, actions, themes, and rhetoric and less conscious of what I shall call the author’s presence. Patricia Meyer Spacks notes: “Writers before the nineteenth century . . . often insisted by implication on their lack of psychology, deﬁning themselves in relation to their audiences or in terms of a historical tradition rather than by personal reactions or feelings.”6 The conventions of editor or omniscient narrator deserve such a description. In Moll Flanders (1722) and Clarissa (1748) the presence of the author is often felt as an editor; in Tom Jones (1749) the author depicts himself as the reader’s host. In Victorian ﬁction the author becomes an omniscient voice. Yet because modern writers have written ﬁrst for themselves, they have been more insistent on afﬁrming their living presence in their works than on using rhetorical tools to shape their readers.\n\nII The Modern Novel as Self-Expression Twentieth-century novels are often songs of myself, and anxious, selfdoubting ones at that. In varying degrees the later Hardy in Jude the Obscure, Conrad, Forster, Woolf, and Joyce take their own imaginations as a major subject. In a sense their novels are about the process of transforming life into art. Reading Emma (1816) is the discovery of a ﬁnished, three20\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\ndimensional, imagined world, while reading the major British and Irish novelists in the period from 1890 to 1930 involves participating in their process of struggling to deﬁne their values and their concepts of the novel. It is the difference between a Constable or a Gainsborough and a Matisse or a Picasso. The novel depends on a continuing dialogue between the author’s avowed subject and his or her efforts to discover the appropriate form and values for that subject. Writing in “Tea at the Palaz of Hoon” (1921) of how artists ﬁnally must discover the world in themselves, Stevens deﬁnes the relationship between text and author that informs the writers under discussion: I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw Or heard or felt came not but from myself; And there I found myself more truly and more strange.\n\nThe author’s struggle with his or her subject becomes a major determinant of novel form. In the 1898–1900 Marlow tales, The Rainbow (1915), Ulysses (1922), and Mrs Dalloway (1925), each author writes to deﬁne himself or herself. The writer does not strive for the rhetorical ﬁnish of earlier novels but, rather like Rodin in his sculpture, invites the reader to perceive a relationship between the creator and the artistic work, and to experience the dialogue between the creative process and the raw material. While the Victorian novelist believed that he had a coherent self and that his characters could achieve coherence, the Modernist is conscious of disunity in his own life and the world in which he or she lives. The novelist becomes a divided self. He or she is both the creator and seeker, the prophet who would convert others and the agonizing doubter who would convince himself and herself while engaging in introspective self-examination. Even while the writer stands detached, creating characters, we experience his or her urgent effort to create a self. Thus the reader must maintain a double vision. He or she must apprehend the narrative and the process of creating that narrative. In such diverse works as the Marlow tales, The Rainbow and To the Lighthouse, the process of writing, of deﬁning the subject, of evaluating character, of searching for truth, becomes part of the novel. Yet, as Woolf writes in “Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown” (1924), “where so much strength is spent on ﬁnding a way of telling the truth, the truth itself is bound to reach us in rather an exhausted and chaotic condition.”7 “Finding a way” – the quest for values and the quest for aesthetic form – becomes the subject. Telling becomes a central action in these novels. The reader experiences the author’s engagement in deﬁning values as he or she writes. As the search for values often takes precedence over story and as the form of these novels 21\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nenacts the author’s quest, traditional chronology, linear narrative, and ordinary syntax are discarded. Sometimes, as in the Marlow tales, the author’s quest for values is transferred to another character whose central activity becomes the search for meaning and for the appropriate language with which to tell the tale. Sometimes a character will become the spokesman for values that the omniscient voice articulates; this is the case in Jude the Obscure, Sons and Lovers (1913), and Women in Love (1920). But this kind of doubling – the protagonist (Jude, Paul, Birkin) and narrative voice saying much the same thing – is not only a function of the author’s need to convince himself of the accuracy of his perceptions but of the difﬁculty of a somewhat confused author’s achieving irony toward a version of himself. The structure of a novel is no longer a preconceived pattern in which characters move toward discovering values held by an omniscient voice who is a surrogate for the author. To read the novel is to participate in a process by which the novelist uses his characters to propose, test, examine, and discard moral and aesthetic values. Thus it becomes increasingly difﬁcult for writers to remove themselves from the text. In fact, the major modern British and Irish authors remain in their work in much the same way as some Renaissance painters who placed an image of themselves in a corner of their canvas watching the main spectacle. The stream of consciousness, which has been thought of as a movement toward objectivity, is actually often a disguise for authorial presence rather than a means for the author to absent himself. For example, do we not feel that Joyce is selecting and arranging the stream of consciousness, including mythic parallels and image patterns that help give the stream its meaning and signiﬁcance? We know a great deal more about Joyce from A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Ulysses than we know about Austen from Emma and Pride and Prejudice (1813), or about Fielding from Tom Jones, notwithstanding his host-narrator. Austen or even Fielding would hardly have asserted, as Conrad did in 1912: A novelist lives in his work. He stands there, the only reality in an invented world, among imaginary things, happenings, and people. Writing about them, he is only writing about himself. But the disclosure is not complete. He remains, to a certain extent, a ﬁgure behind the veil; a suspected rather than a seen presence – a movement and a voice behind the draperies of ﬁction.8\n\nWhile there was always an autobiographical strain in the English novel (Tristram Shandy [1767], The Mill on the Floss [1860], David Copperﬁeld [1850]), this was surely a minor motif in the history of the genre. Jude the 22\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nObscure, Sons and Lovers, and A Portrait of the Artist thinly disguise the presence of the authors in their work. The quest of Stephen for artistic values, for self-recognition, and for the approval of others is Joyce’s quest. The agon is the author’s quest to understand himself. Hardy becomes a spokesman for Jude because he sees Jude as a version of himself – the outsider aspiring to be recognized by a more educated elite society. In Sons and Lovers the omniscient narrator of part I gives way in part II to a spokesman for Paul’s perspective. He strains to justify Paul’s (Lawrence’s surrogate) role in his relationship with Miriam (Lawrence’s lover, Jessie Chambers). Our reading of Lawrence’s dramatic scenes often belies the interpretation imposed by his narrative voice. For example, the voice does not recognize that Paul suffers from the very problems of frigidity and repression of which he accuses Miriam. Nor does he understand that he turns away from Miriam at the very time that she begins to respond sexually to Paul or that Paul discards Clara because his relationship with her threatens to succeed. Paul’s oedipal relationship with his mother requires that he ﬁnd fault with Clara as soon as he consummates that relationship. Within a culture once there is no longer agreement about social, political, and personal values, an author cannot depend upon the reader to recognize the ironic disjunction between what a character thinks and what the author wants the reader to think. The omniscient narrator may be thorough and careful in establishing his or her point of view, but he or she has no special status. The novelist does not believe that any single perspective holds the entire truth. As we read modern novels told by an omniscient speaker, we realize that the novelist’s commentary has imposed a perspective upon events, even while implying, through the dramatic actions and sometimes his pluralistic values, the possibility of another perspective. This is true not only for Jude the Obscure and Sons and Lovers, in each of which the omniscient narrator becomes more and more an empathetic spokesman and apologist for the major character, but even for The Rainbow and Ulysses. Thus the technical convention of omniscience survives, but not the concept of a shared value system that originally gave rise to the convention. The recognition that self-expression and subjectivity are at the heart of the transformation of the English novel was long inhibited by the acceptance in ﬁction criticism of the New Critical credo that the best literature depends on the author’s separating his or her personal life from the imagined world of the novels or, at the very least, on his or her repressing those aspects of experience that do not have “universal” interest. If we are to come to terms with the expressive aspect of modern ﬁction, we must develop an appropriate aesthetic. For example, can we separate the prophetic voice of The Rainbow from Lawrence’s personal quest for self-realization or his quest for the appropriate 23\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\ngrammar of passion with which to render sexual relationships, if we recall his writing, “Now you will ﬁnd [Frieda] and me in the novel, I think, and the work is of both of us”? 9 Nor can we ignore the parallels between Marlow’s search for values and Conrad’s. Wayne Booth’s The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961) still stands as the indispensable study of rhetoric and voice in ﬁction. Booth’s reluctance to appreciate the ambiguous rhetoric of modern literature has often been criticized. But has anyone gone beyond his work and developed a rhetoric to describe the authorial presence within a novel that may be either narrator or character or both? Nevertheless, Booth’s concept of implied author, while valuable, does not seem quite satisfactory to deﬁne the mask that the author wears within his or her works. This presence is somewhat different in each of an author’s novels because its personality and character are functions of the words chosen and the events and characters described. Booth’s implied author may be somewhat workable for a Fielding or Austen novel, where the narrative voice is an artiﬁce controlled and manipulated by an objective author in full command of his or her rhetorical devices. But it does not do justice to the strong, subjective authorial presence within much modern ﬁction. To approach the modern writers under discussion, we must reconcile ﬁction as rhetoric and as self-contained ontology with ﬁction as self-expression. For there are frequent moments in twentieth-century ﬁction when the subject is the author’s quest to deﬁne himself or herself. In much of the work of Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Forster, and Lawrence, the speaker is a thinly disguised version of the writer’s actual self who is actively seeking moral and aesthetic values; this authorial self, or presence, is a dynamic evolving identity that is an intrinsic – not an implied – part of the novel’s form. The presence that the novelist projects reﬂects the particular circumstances of the novelist’s life when he or she wrote the novel and the Zeitgeist in which the novel was written. While we should begin with what a book is and what a book does, we should not ignore what the author does, particularly in novels where the subject is the author’s self. The best way to locate this presence within the text is to know beforehand something about the historical ﬁgure. In other words, the text more readily yields its presence to those who know about an author’s other works, life, and historical context. As readers we respond to an imitation of the real creator of the text. The actual author is in the imagined world as a distortion – at times, a simpliﬁcation, an obfuscation, an idealization, a clariﬁcation – of the creating psyche. In earlier periods the words of a novel signify a human presence within the text; that presence may be urging the reader to a particular attitude, but in modern ﬁction the presence also is usually involved in afﬁrming his or her identity and values. The reader, knowing that the presence mimes the historical 24\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nﬁgure who wrote the book, imagines that ﬁgure as a reality. As Spacks notes, “if poets create themselves as ﬁgures in their poems, readers choose, consciously or unconsciously, to accept such ﬁgures as more or less appropriate to reality.”10 Since novels are written by people, it seems the antithesis of a humanistic approach to settle for a formalism – whether it be New Criticism or more recent varieties – that excludes authors from the text. The process of locating a human being within the text recognizes that reading is not merely a verbal game but a shared experience between writer and reader. It is another way of saying that we wish words to signify something beyond themselves. Because we desire coherence and meaning, we seek a tangible identity within the imagined world and respond to the energy of the author’s creative imagination. We demand of words that they form connections to human experience, even though we make fewer demands of lines and shapes or musical notes. (Painting and sculpture, of course, have had a tradition of mimesis while music has not.) The author’s presence in the text usually serves the rhetorical purpose of reinforcing the meaning conveyed by the other elements: structure, narrator, language, characterization, and setting. But at times the presence is subversive in that it undermines the meaning that the author intended. In many modern novels that voice is divided into two or more aspects, each of which projects a different identity. Sometimes we can speak of a dominant and a secondary voice or, as in The Nigger of the “Narcissus” (1897), of a tension between competing voices. Conrad’s effort to overcome writer’s block by means of mastering the raw material of his narrative – the sea experience of his earlier life – is as much the subject of the novel as the journey of the Narcissus. For Conrad the sea voyage – with its clearly deﬁned beginning and ending, its movement through time toward a destination, its separation from other experiences, and the explicit requirements that must be fulﬁlled by the crewmen and ofﬁcers – provided the necessary model for completing a work. Since he had actually sailed on a ship named the Narcissus in 1884, he could draw upon romantic memories of an ordered and accomplished voyage at a time when his creative impulses were stiﬂed by doubts. Thus the voyage of the Narcissus provided Conrad with an imaginative escape from his writing frustrations. The Nigger of the “Narcissus” also reﬂects a reductive dichotomy within Conrad’s psyche between the evil land, where he was terribly frustrated as he launched his new career, and the sea, where, as he remembered it, he had been fairly tested and had ultimately succeeded. This dichotomy explains the schism between the ﬁrst-person speaker who is a part of the crew and the third-person speaker who strives to play the role of the traditional omniscient speaker. 25\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nUlysses is Joyce’s attempt to resolve the Stephen and Bloom within his psyche, and that effort is writ large on every page. Among other things, Ulysses is a search for values, a dialogue within Joyce’s psyche among the intellectualism and abstraction of Stephen, the humanity and empiricism of Bloom, and the sensuality and spontaneity of Molly. The novel works its way through a panorama of values in modern life. It tests and discards patriotism, nationalism, piety, Platonism, and aestheticism, and afﬁrms the family paradigm, affection, consideration, tolerance, and love. Beginning with “Wandering Rocks,” Ulysses examines not only ways of living but ways of telling. Joyce parodies romantic ﬁction in “Nausicaa,” examines whether ﬁction can be patterned on musical composition in “The Sirens,” explores the possibilities of the scientiﬁc temperament in “Ithaca,” and tests the mock epic in “Cyclops.” “Eumaeus,” narrated by Joyce’s omniscient narrator in the style in which Bloom would have told it, is Joyce’s love song for Bloom in the form of an affectionate parody and the author’s sequel to the end of “Hades,” when Bloom afﬁrms the value of life. In “Ithaca” not only Bloom’s humanity but the possibility of signiﬁcant action in the form of personal relationships emerges despite the mechanical nature of the scientiﬁc catechism, a style that enacts the indifference and coldness of the community to individuals. Thus Ulysses is Joyce’s odyssey for moral values and aesthetic form. It is not only Bloom but Joyce who survives and triumphs over what he calls in “Aeolus” the “grossbooted draymen” of the modern city. This kind of pastiche of former styles in the service of a quest for personal values is also very much a part of modern painting and sculpture. It is in this sense, in this profoundly humanistic sense, that modern painting is about painting and modern literature is about writing.\n\nIII Parallels Between Modern Literature and Modern Art Virginia Woolf wrote that “on or about December 10, 1910 human character changed,” because the ﬁrst Postimpressionist exhibition organized by Roger Fry and called “Manet and the Post-Impressionists” ran in London from November 8, 1910, to January 15, 1911.11 According to Samuel Hynes, she “chose that occasion as an appropriate symbol of the way European ideas forced themselves upon the insular English consciousness during the Edwardian years and so joined England to the Continent.”12 The Postimpressionists provide an example of the abandonment of realism and the movement of the artist to center stage. The Postimpressionists had discarded representation for form. For example, in his famous Card Players, Paul Cézanne is less 26\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nan observer of peasant life than a composer of formal harmony and disparate pictorial planes, while in his works Paul Signac is concerned with the possibilities of objectively capturing light. These painters demonstrated that artists could create their own order in a chaotic world. Thus they intentionally neglect some details, while they simplify, distort, exaggerate, and stress others to express their emotions, solve problems of pictorial space, and create effects. In a sense, the artist’s temperament and perspective become the subject in the work of Van Gogh, André Derain, Matisse, and Picasso. We recall Van Gogh’s insistence that “what is eternally alive is in the ﬁrst place the painter and in the second place the picture.”13 It is quite possible that the abrupt cutting of ﬁgures, the elimination of traditional perspective, the foreshortening of images inﬂuenced the tendency of Woolf, Lawrence, Forster, and Joyce (who, of course, saw similar paintings in Paris) to move beyond realism to more expressive forms of art. Can we read Ulysses or The Secret Agent (1907) without realizing that something has happened to the visual imagination of nineteenth-century novels and that even Dickens did not continually create the kinds of illuminating distortions, cartoons, and grotesques that populate these modern urban novels? Novelists no longer wrote what they saw, but what they knew. The 1978 London exhibition entitled Great Victorian Pictures made clear, I think, the revolutionary character of Fry’s exhibition. Victorian painting often told a story, either of history or of contemporary life. As Rosemary Treble wrote in the introduction to the catalogue for that exhibition: “The constant refrain in all the writing of the period and the touchstone of every judgment was whether the work attained ‘truth’ generally to nature and therefore, by implication, to God’s creation, whether its sentiment was appropriate and whether it was morally healthy and therefore ﬁt for consumption.”14 And the values by which Victorian ﬁction writers were evaluated were not too different. A painting like William Powell Frith’s The Railroad Station (1862) was considered a national epic because it included every class. William Edward Frost’s allegorical women were thought to be uplifting, although to us they seem self-absorbed and repressed. The avant-garde in England, beginning with the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood and including Burne-Jones’s precious symbolism, hardly affected the supremacy of conventional painting. To be sure, the works of James Whistler and Walter Sickert were exceptions. But the fact remains that, until Fry’s painting exhibition, ﬁction usually conformed to the existing theories of art, and those theories (most notably orthodox realism, often in the service of Victorian pieties) with few exceptions tended to serve conventional morality. The English novel after Hardy was deeply affected by Russian art in a number of ways. In the Edwardian years the Russian inﬂuence challenged 27\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nBritish insularity. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, although patronized by Conrad, now became popular, and the exuberant and ﬂamboyant Russian Ballet appeared in 1911. In the pre-war years, Russian music, dance, and painting made their mark on London. (Russians were included in the second show of Postimpressionism.) In general, Russian art, in contrast to British art, depended more upon energy than craft, more upon fantasy than realism, more upon the artist’s vision than subjectivity, more upon ﬂux than stasis, more upon experimentation than tradition, more upon mysticism than reason, and more upon the spiritual and psychological than the moral. As Woolf understood, these qualities inevitably questioned the conventions of the British novel: “The novels of Dostoevsky are seething whirlpools, gyrating sandstorms, waterspouts which hiss and boil and suck us in. They are composed purely and wholly of the stuff of the soul.”15 In the essay “Modern Fiction” in the same volume Woolf wrote: “If we want understanding of the soul and heart where else [but in Russian ﬁction] shall we ﬁnd it of comparable profundity?”16 The violence of Dostoyevsky’s emotions inﬂuenced not only Conrad in Under Western Eyes (1911), but, in more subtle ways, Woolf, Lawrence, and Forster.17 Indeed, Lawrence consciously imports the Russian element into his imagined world in the person of the Slavic Lydia Lensky, who is the mysterious, libidinous, passionate soulmate for Tom Brangwen, Lawrence’s Übermensch of the passions, and the grandmother of Ursula, the novel’s heroine, who, like Lawrence, must come to terms with twentieth-century life. Indeed, Lawrence used the Dostoyevskian strain – the inchoate, urgent, uncontrolled “stuff of the soul” – to fertilize the English novel of manners. The novel also changed because artists increasingly felt that the modern world required different kinds of art. The search for innovation in form and technique is inseparable from the search for values in a world where the British empire had lost its sense of invulnerability, the political leadership had suffered a crisis of conﬁdence, and industrialization had created worker unrest. We see the effects of the ﬁrst two in A Passage to India (1924) and Mrs Dalloway, and of the third in the character of Verloc in The Secret Agent. The urbanization of England undermined the sense of continuity that had prevailed in the country since Elizabethan times, a continuity that even the revolution of 1640 did not entirely disrupt. This continuity derived from land passed down from generation to generation, from the rhythms of rural culture, from monarchical succession, from the strong sense of English family, and from the relatively stable role played by the clergy, the aristocracy, and Parliament. George Dangerﬁeld has described how England had become by 1914 “a liberal democracy whose parliament had practically ceased to function, whose Government was futile, and whose Opposition had said enough to put lesser men in the dock for treason.”18 Modern writers are conscious of writing 28\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nin a period of crisis and transition; certainly this sense of crisis gives Nostromo (1904), The Rainbow, and Ulysses much of their intensity. It may be that the boldness and scope of these novels are a response to the ennui, cynicism, and solipsism of the ﬁn de siècle, a response all the more violent because their writers felt threatened by these negative attitudes. The great Modernists – Joyce, Lawrence, Conrad, Forster, Hardy, Woolf – have a clear and ordered sense of a past from which they felt permanently separated. Conrad realizes that traditional personal values are threatened by compulsive materialism, often in the guise of politics. For Hardy and Lawrence a pastoral vision of agrarian England is an alternative to present mechanism and utilitarianism. Jude the Obscure and Howards End (1910) are elegies for this rural civilization. For Joyce, like T. S. Eliot, it is the European cultural tradition that has been debased by the meanness of the present. Joyce, Conrad, Woolf, and Forster long for a tradition of social customs and personal relationships that has become obsolete under the pressure of urbanization and materialism. Noel Annan has written of the change in England between 1880 and 1910, a change that affected the subject matter of the novel:\n\nThe restraints of religion and thrift and accepted class distinctions started to crumble and English society to rock under the ﬂood of money. The class war, not merely between labour and owners, but between all social strata of the middle and upper classes began in earnest . . . A new bitterness entered politics, a new rancour in foreign relations and a materialism of wealthy snobbery and aggressive philistinism arose far exceeding anything hitherto seen in England.19\n\nAlthough often bourgeois in their impulses and unscathed by these factors, novelists began to write more frequently about class struggle (Jude the Obscure), the ethics and effects of imperialism (Heart of Darkness and A Passage to India), the implications of politics on private lives (The Secret Agent), and the corrupting inﬂuence of industry and commerce (Nostromo). If we compare Mrs Dalloway with the novels of Austen, we see how the sensibilities of Woolf ’s major characters have been deeply inﬂuenced by wars, empire, and commerce (although these play less of a role in the rather anachronistic life of Mrs Dalloway than in the lives of Peter Walsh and Septimus Smith). The lack of community values is enacted in the fragmented form, in the lack of meaningful purpose in politically inﬂuential ﬁgures (Richard Dalloway, Lady Bruton), and ﬁnally in the crystallizing image of Septimus Smith, who, as he walks the streets of London, seems to epitomize the failure of Londoners to discover purpose or coherence in their city. The confrontation of traditional English values with those of other cultures is central to 29\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nA Passage to India, Heart of Darkness (1899), and Women in Love (especially in the Bohemian and European sections). Yet even as novelists write about different value systems, they explore the importance of those systems for their own lives. They do not, like eighteenth-century novelists, simply measure the strange cultures against established values. The structure becomes a process, a process that mimes the author’s quest for values. Thus even in A Passage to India – which we think of as an heir to the Victorian novel – the oscillation among Muslim, Hindu, and English and the shifts in the third-person narrator’s distance between the personal perspective and the cosmic perspective reﬂect Forster’s search. As Wilfred Stone has written, Forster’s novels are “dramatic installments in the story of his struggle for selfhood . . . They tell of a man coming out in the world, painfully emerging from an encysted state of loneliness, fear, and insecurity.”20 The same, I am arguing, could be said of Woolf, Joyce, Lawrence, and Conrad. Comparing H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and John Galsworthy with their major predecessors, Woolf wrote:\n\nTristram Shandy or Pride and Prejudice is complete in itself; it is self-contained; it leaves one with no desire to do anything, except indeed to read the book again, and to understand it better. The difference perhaps is that both Sterne and Jane Austen were interested in things in themselves; in character in itself; in the book in itself. Therefore everything was inside the book, nothing outside. But the Edwardians were never interested in character in itself; or in the book in itself. They were interested in something outside. Their books, then, were incomplete as books, and required that the reader should ﬁnish them, actively and practically, for himself.21\n\nBut I think the major British and Irish twentieth-century ﬁgures under discussion, including Woolf herself, were interested in both “something inside” and “something outside.” For these writers no longer accepted the traditional Christian beliefs that divine providence expresses itself in earthly matters or that this life is a necessary prelude to eternity. And the world outside could no longer be limited and contained by authors whose own moral vision was tentative, incomplete, and lacking in conviction. We should not be surprised that the movement of Nostromo, Women in Love, or Ulysses enacts kinds of uneasiness and turbulence that are absent in, say, an Austen novel. Because the writer is striving to discover his or her moral and aesthetic values, this uneasiness and turbulence at times reﬂect unresolved social issues, characters whose motives the novelist does not understand, and inchoate form. 30\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nThe social and historical milieu in which an artist writes determines the artistic problems that he or she must solve. Thus Conrad, Lawrence, Joyce, Forster, and Woolf had to discover an appropriate form with which to show (if I may boldly list the striking characteristics of the period) that motives could not be fully understood, that the world was not created and shaped by divine providence, that chance might determine human destiny, that human desires and aspirations were often not likely to be fulﬁlled, that social institutions were ineffectual, and that materialism and industrialization were destroying the fabric of life. Consequently, these authors invented plots that at times reﬂect disorder, ﬂux, discontinuity, fragmentations, and disruption without themselves having those qualities; they needed to use the Odyssey, Hamlet, the Bible, and, in Ulysses, even such Jewish legends as “The Last of the Just” to give shape to seemingly random events. They had to invent means not only for rendering the inner life but for showing the unacknowledged private self that played such a large role in shaping behavior. Thus Conrad shows that Jim is the victim of compulsions, obsessions, and ﬁxations that he cannot understand. These writers needed innovative syntax and language to reveal the secret recesses of each psyche and the impact made upon it by experience, especially the kind of ordinary daily experience that was once thought to be insigniﬁcant. The unpunctuated, effervescent stream of consciousness of Molly fertilizes the presentation of both Stephen and Bloom by emphasizing – in form and content – fecundity, sexuality, spontaneity, passion, and indifference to history and morality.\n\nIV\n\nThe Order of Art Replaces the Order of Life\n\nLet us think for a moment of some major Victorian novels – say Bleak House (1853), Vanity Fair (1848), or Middlemarch (1872). Victorian ﬁction depends on the mastery of space and time in an unfolding narrative. It seeks to create an imagined world that both mirrors and exaggerates the external world. Its use of an omniscient, ubiquitous narrator implies the pre-eminence of the individual perceiver. Now let us think of The Secret Agent (like Bleak House, a novel of London), Ulysses (like Vanity Fair, a satirical examination of relatively recent times), and The Rainbow (like Middlemarch, a panoramic novel about provincial life). Do not these examples of modern British and Irish ﬁction undermine the idea that space and time can be mastered by anyone, including the author? Like the subject matter, the setting resists the traditional patterns. The setting itself recoils from idealization, control, and order and expresses the turmoil and anxiety within each author’s psyche. (By becoming 31\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nforeground rather than background, setting plays a similar role in the Postimpressionist works of Van Gogh, Matisse, and Picasso.) The setting – the physical conditions under which the imagined world functions – becomes not only background but a moral labyrinth which the characters are unable to negotiate and which not only shapes their destiny but often subsumes them. Hardy’s Wessex, Forster’s India, Joyce’s Dublin, and Conrad’s London are manifestations of an amoral cosmos that pre-empts the characters’ moral choices. By forging a web of social circumstances that encloses and limits characters, these settings displace the traditional role of individual will in shaping the lives of characters. Yet even as these settings often become coterminous with destiny and fate, they may also be a symptom or cause of a bankrupt social system, or a metaphor for the narrator’s and the characters’ own moral confusion. In the nineteenth-century novel, characters are deﬁned in terms of their moral choices in social situations. In Vanity Fair Becky Sharp consciously chooses to seek wealth and status, although we do not watch the processes of her mind; in Bleak House Esther Summerson’s loyalty, sympathy, and integrity result mostly from conscious decisions. But Woolf, Joyce, Lawrence, Forster, and, quite frequently, Conrad perceive their characters in terms of the honesty and integrity of perceptions rather than in terms of the moral consequences of their behavior. What characters are is more important than what they do. The integrity and purity of their souls are standards by which they are primarily judged. Is-ness (the quality and intensity of the soul and heart) replaces does-ness (the effects of behavior) as the norm for characters. Thus we value Bloom and Mrs Ramsay for their uniqueness rather than their effectiveness. And this corresponds to the shift in emphasis in the art of the novel from traditional effects upon audience to self-dramatizing narrators in search of values and feelings. The writers we are discussing saw that people no longer lived together bound by common values and social purposes. Each person is his or her own secular sect, and the interaction of these sects creates a social Babel. The order of art becomes a counterbalance to the disorder of life, and the novel mimes a momentary unity in the novelist’s mind rather than in the external world. Thus in Woolf and Joyce, a novel’s lack of form may nevertheless seem to have a coherence that the subject of the novel lacks because the texture is reﬂexive and self-referential. Indeed, at times the writers under discussion try to replace, as Malcolm Bradbury puts it, “the linear logic of story, psychological process, or history” with the “logic of metaphor, form, or symbol.”22 But do we not see that this effort has a compulsive quality, and that Woolf and Joyce are as much committed to transforming their lives into art as to creating a symbolic alternative to realistic ﬁction? 32\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\nIn The Form of Victorian Fiction, J. Hillis Miller remarks that, for Victorian novelists, “the writing of ﬁction was an indirect way for them to reenter the social world from which they had been excluded or which they were afraid to enter directly.”23 By contrast, the great Modernists wrote ﬁction to deﬁne themselves outside the social world and to conﬁrm their special status as artists. They did not want to re-enter the social world but rather to leave it for islands (actual and imaginary) where life was more honest and true to the promptings of their hearts; these islands were often their novels. They could look at a society from which they felt excluded and criticize its values. Woolf ’s moments of enlightenment, Joyce’s epiphanies, and Lawrence’s states of passionate intensity emphasize the individual’s life as separate from the community. Novels move not to a comprehensive vision of society but to unity within a character’s imagination and perception. In Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim (1900) Marlow’s experience and insight not only are his own, but leave him, like the Ancient Mariner, separate from his fellows. If in Victorian ﬁction the narrator is, as in Our Mutual Friend (1865) or Vanity Fair, a detached outsider observing characters who often function successfully within the community, in modern British and Irish ﬁction, such as Ulysses and Women in Love, the narrator and the protagonists are both separate from the community, and the community itself is corrupt and morally bankrupt. Woolf saw the problem. On the one hand, she knew that her novels give credence to various kinds of personal Crusoeism and raise the hope of solutions separate from the traditional community. But, on the other hand, she also understood the dangers of her ﬁction becoming self-indulgent and narcissistic: “I suppose the danger is the damned egotistical self . . . Is one pliant and rich enough to provide a wall for the book from oneself without its becoming . . . narrowing and restricting?”24 In To the Lighthouse the completion of Lily Briscoe’s painting might serve as a metaphor for the hermetic nature of one strand of Modernism. She has her vision and completes her painting, but she turns her back on the opportunity for community in the form of marriage to Mr Ramsay. Her art is at the expense of social life: Here she was again, she thought, stepping back to look at it, drawn out of gossip, out of living, out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers – this other thing, this truth, this reality, which suddenly laid hands on her, emerged stark at the back of appearance and commanded her attention.25\n\nAnd Mrs Ramsay’s victories are more aesthetic than moral; thinking of Mrs Ramsay, Lily realizes that her friend “[makes] of the moment something 33\n\n“I Was the World in Which I Walked”\n\npermanent (as in another sphere Lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent) – this was of the nature of revelation. In the midst of chaos there was shape: this eternal passing and ﬂowing (she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking) was struck into stability.”26 Life struck into stability is what happens when pattern is imposed on life by art, but it is also a foreshadowing of death. Lily is a version of her creator, and her struggle with her painting mimes that of her author with the subject. We realize that Woolf ’s quest for values in the “eternal passing and ﬂowing” continues through the novel.\n\nV\n\nConclusion\n\nLet us conclude with some ﬁnal observations about Modernism’s focus on the consciousness of both the creator and his or her subjects. Even novels with an epic scope – Ulysses, Nostromo, The Rainbow – discover meaning in the isolated perceiving consciousness of such characters as B"
