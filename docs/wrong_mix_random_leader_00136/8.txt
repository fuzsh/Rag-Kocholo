"No Worries?" We are profoundly aware that worry harms our bodies, our minds, and our relationships, but most of us struggle to stop our obsessive thoughts. Mindscape builds a biblical, practical action plan for changing your mind based on Paul's rich exhortation in Philippians 4:8. Simple, clear, and pastoral, Mindscape offers worriers real-life guidance for replacing worry with a new way of thinking. Chapter-by-chapter application questions make Mindscape perfect for personal reflection or small group use.
