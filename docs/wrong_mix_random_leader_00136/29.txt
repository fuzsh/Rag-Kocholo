What is a Mindscape?

Mindscapes (mindset + landscapes) are mental destinations students explore and inhabit. Each Mindscape is visually represented by an element in nature and is designed to evoke a different impression or experience tied to SEL skills. Click through the carousel to take a brief tour of each Mindscape with authors Pam Allyn and Dr. Ernest Morrell.

How Mindscapes Works

Mindscapes encourages experience-driven learning that helps students apply self-awareness to their academic learning process. Students not only find joy in uncovering “aha” moments of discovery, but also develop the ability to recognize frustration, disappointment, or stress that can sometimes inhibit their progress.

By adopting a “shared language” that extends from the classroom throughout the school day and into the home, students learn how to express their frustration (or concerns, or fear), along with the ability to readjust their mindset. By revisiting a familiar Mindscape or accessing a learned tactic, students are opening up themselves to “aha” moments of discovery.
