Saif Ali Khan and Sharmila Tagore opened up about Saif marrying Amrita Singh on Koffee With Karan 8. The actor was just 20 years old when he married Amrita. The couple shared a 12-year age gap. In the recent episode of KWK, Karan brought up the subject of Saif’s marriage with Amrita when Saif revealed that Sharmila was upset with him after the wedding. The Hum Tum star said that he married Amrita without informing Sharmila and Tiger Pataudi (his father) which left her ‘hurt.’

“She told me, ‘I believe you are living with someone and you are doing something.’ So I said yes and she said, ‘Well, just don’t get married.’ And I said, ‘I got married yesterday.’ A big tear fell out of her eye and she started crying. She said, ‘you’ve really hurt me. Why didn’t you tell me?’” Saif said.

Sharmila revealed that she met Amrita over tea when she was visiting Mumbai after Saif began dating her. While Sharmila was shocked by the turn of events, she liked Amrita. “I was visiting Mumbai for something. So, Saif came to meet me and said ‘I have something to tell you’ and then he told me. I don’t know what I was doing but I was quiet. He said, ‘Amma, your colour is changing, you’re looking different ‘ and I said, ‘Okay, we’ll talk about it later’. After he left, I ran up to Tiger (Saif Ali Khan’s father) and told him. There was also a long silence on that part and we left it at that. The next day, I called him and said ‘I would like to meet Amrita’ and we had tea, and we chatted. I liked her but still quite shocked,” Sharmila said.

Saif said that there was so much going on with him at the time and he found security and a kind of idea this was safe and could make a home out of the relationship. Saif married Amrita Singh in October 1991 and welcomed two children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. However, they separated in 2004.
