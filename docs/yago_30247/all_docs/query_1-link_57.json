        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan Calls Herself Amrita’s Fan\n\nIn 2008, Kareena Kapoor Khan did an interview with People magazine where she mentioned her fondness for Amrita Singh and said that despite never having met her, she hopes that they can have a friendly relationship between them.\n\nShe also said that she has deep respect for Saif’s first marriage and his two kids with Amrita while discussing his past relationships. She also said that she admires Amrita and acknowledged her role in Khan’s life as she is his first wife and his first two kids’ mother.\n\n“I respect the fact that Saif was married before and has two lovely children. I have been a fan of Amrita Singh. I haven’t met her ever but I know her through her films. For me, she’ll always have a place of importance in his life because she is Saif Ali Khan’s first wife and the mother of his children. And, I’ve told Saif this,” said Kapoor.\n\n“I would want her to have that kind of respect always. This is what my parents have taught me. At the end of the day, it was just a marriage that didn’t work out. I have always encouraged Saif to be friends with her because I think that would be great. I guess they will just need time but that’s something that they would need to deal with. I will always respect her. As far as any other relationship of Saif is concerned, I don’t think they really mattered,” she added."
