        "text": "Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan are one of the most powerful and stylish couples in the industry. They often give us major couple goals. Well, we all know that Kareena is Saif’s second wife and he was earlier married to Amrita Singh. There have been many times Kareena has praised his first wife and in one of the old interviews she also mentioned that she is a fan of Amrita Singh.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with People magazine, Kareena had spoken about Amrita. “I respect the fact that Saif was married before and has two lovely children. I have been a fan of Amrita Singh. I haven’t met her ever but I know her through her films. For me, she’ll always have a place of importance in his life because she is Saif Ali Khan’s first wife and the mother of his children. And, I’ve told Saif this,” Kareena was quoted saying.\n\nKareena further said, “I would want her to have that kind of respect always. This is what my parents have taught me. At the end of the day, it was just a marriage that didn’t work out. I have always encouraged Saif to be friends with her because I think that would be great. I guess they will just need time but that’s something that they would need to deal with. I will always respect her. As far as any other relationship of Saif is concerned, I don’t think they really mattered.”\n\nKareena and Saif dated for a long time and married in 2012. Both are parents to two sons-Taimur and Jehangir.\n\nAs for Kareena, the Bollywood diva was last seen in the heist-comedy film Crew alongside Kriti Sanon and Tabu. Besides, the film also featured Diljit Dosanjh and Kapil Sharma. Directed by Rajesh A. Krishnan, the film garnered considerable acclaim upon its theatrical release. It is available for streaming on Netflix.\n\nNext up for the Jaane Jaan star is The Buckingham Murders, directed by Hansal Mehta. However, the release date of the film has been announced. It is releasing on September 13. Besides, she is set to hit the big screens with Rohit Shetty’s Cop Universe film Singham Again alongside Ajay Devgn. The most awaited project features a stellar ensemble cast, including Deepika Padukone, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, Ranveer Singh, and Akshay Kumar."
