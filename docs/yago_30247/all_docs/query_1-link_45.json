        "text": "Amrita Singh on her acting comeback post divorce\n\nAmrita, during her interaction with Pooja Bedi said, “I had to overcome everything I was going through very fast because I didn't want my children to grow up feeling that they were left with loser parent.' She further added, \"That you know I just stayed at home and just mulled over my situation and you know just stayed fat and complacent and unhappy because of my circumstances. I didn't want my children to grow up learning to be you know defeated in life by a situation.”\n\nSara Ali Khan on growing up with single mom\n\nIn an interview with ETimes during Ae Watan Mere Watan promotions, Sara spoke about living with a single mother. She said, “I think living with a single mother has a huge role to play in it. At a very early age, I realised koi aapke liye kuchh karne nahi wala (nobody is going to do anything for you). It's not that I don't get help, I do. But ultimately, you are the mover and initiator of your life. If you are lucky, stars align and God wills, then it will happen. You can't be waiting around for things to happen, it doesn't work like that.”\n\nAbout Amrita Singh\n\nAmrita made her movie debut with Rahul Rawail's Betaab opposite Sunny Deol. She later made her comeback after separation with Saif with movies like Shootout at Lokhandwala, Dus Kahaniyaan, Kajraare, Aurangzeb, 2 States, A Flying Jatt, Hindi Medium, Badla and Heropanti 2."
