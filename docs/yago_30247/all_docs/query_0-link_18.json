For me, she'll always have a place of importance in his life because she is Saif Ali Khan's first wife and the mother of his children. And, I've told Saif this.\"\n\n'It was just a marriage that didn't work out'\n\nShe added, \"I would want her to have that kind of respect always. This is what my parents have taught me. At the end of the day, it was just a marriage that didn't work out. I have always encouraged Saif to be friends with her because I think that would be great.
