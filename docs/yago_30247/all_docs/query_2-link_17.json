It is believed that her mother, who was a politician, contributed a lot in establishing Amrita as a lead actress.\n\nThe period between 1983-1987 is regarded as the ‘Golden Period’ for Amrita as she not only made a successful debut opposite Sunny Deol but also gave back to back hits with movies like Betaab (1983), Sunny (1984), Mard (1984), Saaheb (1985), Chameli Ki Shaadi (1986), Naam (1986), Khudgarz (1987), and Waaris (1988).\n\nIn 1991, the actress decided to focus more on her personal life and thus got married to actor Saif Ali Khan in an Islamic wedding ceremony. However, the wedding ended up in divorce, 13 years later in 2004. When asked about the reason for the split in an interview, Saif Ali Khan replied that Amrita abused both his mother and sister, which he couldn’t tolerate. Notably, Saif is 12 years younger than her.\n\nPost her divorce, Amrita soon returned to the acting industry with Ekta Kapoor‘s sitcom- Kavyanjali (2005), wherein she played a negative character.\n\nIn another interview, Amrita’s ex-husband, Saif Ali Khan revealed that in the aftermath of their divorce, he has been ordered to pay ₹1 lakh every month to her, until their son Ibrahim, who is under Amrita’s custody, turns 18.\n\nSaif Ali Khan wrote a note wishing Amrita good luck in her life before his marriage to Kareena Kapoor.\n\nShe dressed her daughter, Sara Ali Khan, for Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor‘s wedding in 2012."
