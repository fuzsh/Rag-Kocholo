        "text": "Kareena Kapoor Khan, the epitome of grace and glamour, tied the knot with Saif Ali Khan in 2012. Their love story has been nothing short of a fairy tale, and together, they’ve set couple goals that make our hearts flutter. But amidst the glitz and glam, there’s an interesting chapter involving Saif’s first wife, Amrita Singh, and their children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan got candid about Amrita Singh\n\nDuring a candid chat with Komal Nahta on his show, ETC Bollywood Business, Kareena had opened up about her unique role in the family. As a “maasi” to her sister Karisma Kapoor’s kids, Samaira and Kiaan, and a “maa-si” to Amrita’s kids, Sara and Ibrahim, Kareena shared her perspective. She described Amrita as more of a friend than anything else, emphasising that Sara and Ibrahim have a “wonderful mother”. When they visit, Kareena is there for them as a friend, celebrating their growth into young adults. Kareena didn’t hold back when discussing Sara Ali Khan. She praised Sara’s beauty, which she believes reflects the best of both her parents. Saif Ali Khan’s regal charm and Amrita’s grace. Back then, Kareena eagerly awaited Sara’s entry into Bollywood, confident that the silver screen would soon witness this stunning young lady. Did Sara want to follow in her parents’ footsteps?\n\nAccording to Kareena, Sara occasionally discussed her interest in films, acknowledging her daughter’s intelligence and brightness. Back then, Sara was focused on her studies, but Bebo secretly hoped that the allure of cinema would eventually draw her in. As for Kareena, she graced the screen in Rajesh A Krishnan’s film Crew earlier this year. Meanwhile, Sara Ali Khan’s upcoming projects include Metro…In Dino, Skyforce, and Eagle. Amrita Singh, celebrated for her roles in films like Betaab, Chameli Ki Shaadi, and 2 States, made her mark in Bollywood.
