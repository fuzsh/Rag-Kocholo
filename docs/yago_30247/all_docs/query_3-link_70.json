        "text": "The latest episode of Koffee With Karan 8 was elegance at its finest. Gracing Karan Johar’s couch was the inimitable Sharmila Tagore and her son, actor Saif Ali Khan. The episode was extra special for the mother-son duo as it was their first-ever joint interview appearance. The tone of the hour interlaced wit with a ton of maturity…\n\nHere are 5 reasons why Saif Ali Khan & Sharmila Tagore’s KWK episode is the best this season:\n\n1. Saif Ali Khan & Sharmila Tagore’s mature conversation about ex-wife Amrita Singh\n\nA major talking point during the Koffe With Karan 8 episode was Amrita Singh, Saif Ali Khan’s ex-wife and Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan’s mother. Sharmila Tagore spoke candidly about how she felt Saif and Amrita had a lot of commonalities: “They were both very similar. They were very funny. Both of them, when they used to talk, there used to be a lot of laughter, mimicking other people, tearing somebody into bits in a funny way. As you know he is good at mimicking and she is a great storyteller. They looked very happy together,” according to India Today. The legendary actress further added that she and husband Mansoor Ali Khan (Tiger) Pataudi were “doubly deprived” during Saif and Amrita’s marriage because they didn’t just lose their daughter-in-law, but also their two grandchildren.\n\nOn the other hand, Saif Ali Khan was all praises for Amrita Singh: “Things changed but she was a wonderful support. She is mother to two of my kids and I share a very good relation with her. It’s always respect. It's always bad when things don't work well, especially for the kids, something that you don’t want for them but unfortunately, it happens.”\n\n2. Sharmila Tagore’s heartwarming bond with daughter-in-law Kareena Kapoor Khan\n\nSharmila Tagore also touched upon her sweet bond with daughter-in-law Kareena Kapoor Khan. Something that Tagore deeply admires about Kareena is that she's “direct and very clear”, which included her casually stating how she and Saif were living together (during their dating days) in a room full of Sharmila’s same-age Delhi friends. That and the fact that dinner is always sorted, according to Tagore’s preferences, at the Khan-Kapoor abode.\n\nFurthermore, through a heartwarming video message, Kareena Kapoor Khan spoke fondly about her mother-in-law Sharmila Tagore: “I have called her Amma since the time I met Saif because I genuinely feel that love and connection for her because she's been so warm and so caring. I think she looks at me more like a daughter. Like Soha (Ali Khan) and Saba (Ali Khan). She's always made me feel welcome.”\n\n3. Sara Ali Khan’s immense respect for grandmother Sharmila Tagore\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSara Ali Khan (as well as Soha Ali Khan) also left a heartfelt video message for both her father Saif Ali Khan and grandmother Sharmila Tagore. Touching upon their modern family dynamics and how Saif is the “cool, wholesome” dad to four kids, Sara revealed how she’s gone to Sharmila Tagore several times for advice - referring to her as “a modern woman in traditional attire.” - and that her Badi Amma likes “her limericks”. The Ae Watan Mere Watan actor also shared a cute limerick dedicated to Tagore, who endearingly mouthed the words as well.\n\n4. Sharmila Tagore relaying Saif Ali Khan’s notoriety as a child\n\nThe witty banter between Saif Ali Khan and Sharmila Tagore was a sight to witness. Sharmila was anything but coy when it came to Saif’s theatrics as a young adult. Tagore recalled how her son was supposed to attend a university in Dublin, Ireland, “but didn't go the university. He asked an air hostess out and they went off somewhere.” The appalled look on the Sacred Games star’s face as he tried to come up with defense while his mother was no-holds-barred about her troublemaker child was comical.\n\n5. Saif Ali Khan vs. Sharmila Tagore’s hilarious Rapid Fire\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKoffee With Karan is incomplete without Rapid Fire, and the one between Saif Ali Khan and Sharmila Tagore was as hilarious as it can get. While Saif joked that the way to resolve a fight with Kareena Kapoor Khan is “profusely apologising,” Sharmila quipped how her co-star Rajesh Khanna was “always late,” while Amitabh Bachchan was “always on time.”"
