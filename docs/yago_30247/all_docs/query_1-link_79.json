        "text": "He gave the interview to a leading film magazine and expressed that it's better to be married to a desirable, young woman. According to the media reports, the actor also advised others to marry younger women.\n\n\"Yeah, I definitely recommend it. It's also nice to be married to someone who's fun, beautiful, and non-judgemental. All three things,\" Saif said. While some of the tabloids are assuming this to be the real reason behind Saif and Amrita Singh's divorce, we came across another interview with a leading entertainment daily that narrates a different story.\n\nDon't Miss: These Unseen Pictures & Videos Of Sara Ali Khan Will Melt Your Heart!\n\nAccording to that interview, the real reason behind their separation was the Naam actor’s changed behaviour towards him and his family that led to the divorce. “My wife and I have gone our separate ways. I respect my wife’s space.\n\nBut why am I being constantly reminded of how terrible a husband I was, and how awful a father I am. I’ve my son Ibrahim’s photograph in my wallet. Each time I look at it, I feel like crying. I miss my daughter Sarah all the time. I’m not allowed to meet my children,” he said.\n\nDon't Miss: Let's See How Much You Know About Amrita Singh\n\n“They aren’t allowed to come to visit me, let alone stay with me. Why? Because there’s a new woman in my life who’d influence my children against their mother. That’s so much hogwash and Amrita knows it. Right now, my kids are growing up with Amrita’s relatives and maidservants while she’s out working in a TV serial.\n\nWhy does she need to do that, when I’m more than willing to support my family,” he added.\n\nCut to the present, now that their kids, Sara and Ibrahim have grown-up things between the former couple have become more cordial. All of them together now portrays a happy modern family.\n\nFor more such stories, stay tuned to HerZindagi!"
