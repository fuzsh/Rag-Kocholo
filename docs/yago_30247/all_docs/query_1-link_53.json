Kareena said, “I wasn’t edgy or anxious. But it’s a new journey. I started living in with Saif before I got married, not because I wanted to experiment or test. It was because we weren’t getting much time to spend with each other as we were shooting continuously. After that, it was a natural transition. He asked me to marry him and that was it (sic).”\n\nThe actor, touched by the outpouring of support, spoke about…”Everyone was like, ‘Shaadi mat karna, warna career khatam ho jayega (Don’t marry, your career will be over)’. I said, ‘Career hi khatam ho jayega na? Jaan toh nahi chali jayegi na (Only my career will end right, I won’t die)?’ I love this man (Saif). If living with him means that producers don’t want to work with me, so be it. Of course, after that, I’ve done some good films. Saif has also been extremely encouraging. I only get edgy when we don’t see each other for a long time (sic).”\n\nAbout Kareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan\n\nSaif Ali Khan has four children. From his first marriage to actress Amrita Singh, he has a daughter, Sara Ali Khan, and a son, Ibrahim Ali Khan.
