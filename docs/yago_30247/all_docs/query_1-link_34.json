        "text": "Karan Johar always manages to create intriguing pairings on his chatshow, and this time, it was Saif Ali Khan and his iconic mother, Sharmila Tagore. Their conversation covered various topics, including Saifâ€™s early marriage to Amrita Singh when he was just 21, while she was 34.\n\nReflecting on that time, Saif likened it to leaving home, seeking a sense of security and a new, exciting idea. Sharmila Tagore chimed in, highlighting the similarities between Saif and Amrita, noting their humour, laughter-filled conversations, and their talent for mimicry and storytelling. They seemed genuinely happy together.\n\nHowever, their marriage ended after 13 years in 2004. Saif acknowledged that marrying at 20 was premature, and as life evolved, things changed. Despite the separation, he emphasised Amrita's unwavering support, especially as the mother of his children Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. He expressed respect for her and regretted the difficulty that arises when relationships don't endure, particularly for the sake of the children involved."
