        "text": "New Delhi: Sharmila Tagore and Saif Ali Khan, a mother-son duo, were guests on Karan Johar's popular chat show ‘Koffee With Karan 8’. Last night's episode was a hoot as the iconic actress reminisced about the actor's childhood and shared many endearing and funny stories. Sharmila Tagore also reflected on his son's previous marriage to Amrita Singh and described the divorce as anything else than \"harmonious.\"\n\nIn the most recent episode of Karan Johar's ‘Koffee With Karan 8’, Sharmila Tagore and Saif Ali Khan engaged in an open and honest conversation with the presenter. Sharmila said that it's important to communicate \"every aspect of your life\" with your parents since they are the ones who raise you up, and the actor remembered his mother's sad response when he told her about his wedding.\n\nSaif said that Sharmila was the first to find out about his choice to end his relationship with Amrita. He said, “With the separation, I just like to say, that the first person I spoke to before the separation was my mother. She took a deep breath, there was a pause on the phone, and said, ‘I am with you if that’s what you want’ and that helped a lot.”\n\nSharmila went on to say that the family's loss of Amrita and Saif's children, Sara and Ibrahim Ali Khan, was a difficult period. “When you are together for such a long time and you have such lovely children, then no break up is easy. Then it is not a harmonious… I know it is difficult to have harmony at that stage, everybody is hurt… so that stage was not nice, but I tried. But that's water under the bridge, she needed time to cool down.” she said.\n\nAmrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan got married in 1991 and divorced in 2004. Saif is now married to Kareena Kapoor Khan and they have two adorable boys, Jeh and Taimur."
