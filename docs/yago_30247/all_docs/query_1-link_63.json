        "text": "She was the quintessential Punjabi kudi of Bollywood and he is the Nawab of Pataudi, an urban rockstar of the Hindi film industry. If she was outspoken and dedicated, he was cool and carefree. She was already a star and he was still struggling to find a foothold in the industry. Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan were poles apart from each other but still couldn’t stop themselves from falling in love with one another.\n\nNothing about Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh was ordinary, so naturally, their love story too was far away from being an ordinary one. When Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan had appeared on Simi Garewal’s chat show, Rendevouz with Simi Garewal, we had witnessed magic. Saif Ali Khan, who wears his heart on his sleeve had spoken at length about how he had met and fallen in love with superstar, Amrita Singh.\n\nRecommended Read: Shammi Kapoor's Love Life: Twice Failed In Love And Twice Married; First Wife Died Of Smallpox\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's love story\n\nIt wasn't love at first sight\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh had met for the first time during Rahul Rawail’s film with which Saif was going to make his debut. Since Rahul and Amrita shared a great camaraderie, he had invited her to do a photoshoot with the star cast of the film. Saif, who was making his debut, was trying to act as a gracious host and had tried to take care of all the guests on the set. During the photoshoot, Saif had decided to put his arms around Amrita for the picture and that was when Amrita had first noticed him well.\n\nIt wasn’t love at first sight but there was something that had attracted both of them to each other. While Amrita thought it was quite gutsy of him to put his arms around her like that, for Saif, it was Amrita’s brash behaviour that had caught his attention. He had even told her:\n\n“There must be a gentler side of you which you’re trying to protect with this harsh exterior.”\n\nThe unexpected phone call\n\nEven though the photoshoot got over quickly, Amrita Singh had left a striking impression on Saif’s heart. The young boy was going crazy and curious about someone, who had not even acknowledged his presence. After a couple of days post the photoshoot, Saif had dialled Amrita’s home number, hoping to invite her for dinner. He had said, “Would you like to go out for dinner with me?” And, to his surprise, Amrita had said, “No, I don’t go out for dinner. But you can come home for dinner if you like.” Needless to say, Saif drove over to her place the very same night.\n\nThe steamy liplock\n\nIn his own words, Saif had said:\n\nI did not go over there with any kind of expectations. I just wanted to have a nice time with her and get to know her better.\n\nHe was startled to see Amrita without any makeup, looking even more gorgeous than she had looked otherwise. Well, this did break his heart a bit as he had thought she did not feel the need to dress up and put on some makeup for him, which indirectly meant she was not interested in him.\n\nSensing Saif’s impulse, Amrita had clearly told him that, “If you have come here under the impression that something might happen between the two of us, it’s not. So just relax!” The duo had talked about everything under the sun. They got along like a house on fire and talked about things ranging from professional to personal topics. As the time passed, the two got into the moment and kissed.\n\nSaif did not leave the house for two days\n\nAfter the passionate lip-lock, Saif had confided that he loved her, to which Amrita had replied that she loved him too. Post the episode, Saif did not leave Amrita’s home for the next two days. When the calls of producers and directors became unbearable, he decided to resume shooting. By this time, Amrita was so madly-in-love with him that she did not want him to leave the house, or her at all. And so terrified was she when she had heard that Saif had to go for the shoot again that she asked him to take her car and go. Amrita had revealed that she had secretly thought that if not for her, at least he would come back just for the sake of returning her car.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's marriage\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh were quite opposite to each other. Even though they looked similar from the outside, there was nothing in their lives that had any sort of similarity. While Amrita was a star, Saif was still breaking stones to carve a niche for himself in the industry. While Amrita had wanted marriage, Saif had everything but marriage on his mind.\n\nRecommended Read: Anil Kapoor's Decision Of Marrying Sunita Kapoor Despite Career Threats Defines True Love Perfectly\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's age difference was another factor, which was making them brood over their strange chemistry and kind of cosmic relationship. Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan had an age gap of 12 years. However, despite all the odds, both Saif and Amrita had decided that they could not live without each other.\n\nSo it did not come across as a surprise when the actress, who is known for being bold and headstrong had decided to tie the knot with a much younger Saif Ali Khan in 1991. Amrita Singh’s age during their marriage was 33 while Saif Ali Khan was 21 at that time. Amrita, who was raised as a Sikh had converted to Islam before marriage and had an Islamic wedding. Their wedding was an intimate affair and so there are hardly any wedding pictures of Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's divorce\n\nEven though no official confirmation came our way over why did Saif and Amrita get divorced after 13 strong years of being married. Many attribute Saif Ali Khan’s affairs and falling “out of love” with Amrita as the reasons behind their separation. It was also speculated that Saif’s proximity with Italian dancer and model, Rosa Catalona the reason behind his separation from Amrita. But in a throwback interview in 2005, Saif had rubbished the reports and had stated that it was Amrita’s changed behaviour with him and his family that had soured their relationship. Saif and Amrita have two kids – Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh's divorce alimony\n\nIn a 2005 interview with the Telegraph, Saif had revealed the alimony he had paid to his ex-wife, Amrita Singh. He was quoted as saying:\n\nI'm supposed to give Amrita Rs 5 crore, of which I've already given her approximately Rs 2.5 crore. Also, I'm paying Rs 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18. I'm not Shah Rukh Khan. I don't have that kind of money. I've promised her I'll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I've to slog till I drop dead.\n\nAlso Read: Karisma Kapoor Was About To Become A Bachchan 'Bahu' But Ended Up Becoming Sanjay Kapur's 2nd Wife\n\nSpeaking of how he was saving for their kids, Saif had continued:\n\nWhatever I've earned from doing ads, stage shows and films are being given for my children. I've no money. Our bungalow is for Amrita and the kids, and never mind the relatives who've joined her after my departure, \"I want no confrontation with Amrita. She was, and will remain, an integral part of my life. I want her and my kids to be happy.\n\nSaif Ali Khan's marriage with Kareena Kapoor\n\nAfter Saif Ali Khan’s divorce from his first wife, Amrita Singh, the two had moved on in their respective lives. It was during the shooting of Tashan, when the Nawab of Pataudi, Saif Ali Khan and the stunning, Kareena Kapoor had fallen head-over-heels in love with one another. After dating for few years, Saif and Kareena had begun their happily-ever-after on October 16, 2012. In 2016, Saif and Kareena had become proud parents of a baby boy, whom they have named Taimur Ali Khan. In 2021, Saif and Kareena had again become parents to a baby boy.\n\nHow rich is Saif Ali Khan?\n\nSaif Ali Khan's net worth combined with his wife, Kareena Kapoor Khan is estimated to be over $100 million. And their net worth is predicted to grow by 75% in the next three years. Reportedly, Saif charges around Rs. 6-7 crore per film and Rs. 3-4 crore for brand endorsements.\n\nWell, the equation between Saif-Amrita-Kareena is certainly not an easy one to decode. But, we certainly are glad to see Sara and Ibrahim’s bond with their stepmother, Kareena Kapoor Khan and half-brother Taimur Ali Khan. They are the perfect example of a modern family.\n\nNext Read: Mahendra Singh Dhoni Met Childhood Friend Sakshi Rawat After A Decade And Fell In Love Instantly\n\nImages courtesy: Saif Ali Khan FC\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
