        "text": "Twitter has excavated a wedding photo of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh, who are now divorced\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh married in 1991 (Image courtesy: ambyism)\n\nNew Delhi: For some mysterious reason, Twitter has excavated a wedding photo of actors Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh - now divorced - and is holding its sides laughing. This is, of course, Twitter's default setting because humour, it appears, is to be found in every situation no matter how innocuous. What could possibly be so funny about an old (26-years-old, to be precise) wedding photo? The size of the bride's nose ring, apparently. Twitter cannot get over Amrita Singh's admittedly plus-sized jewellery. Here's a list of all the things social media thinks is the actress' nose ring is bigger than - including, umm, Saif's career.\n\nA sly reference was also made to the age difference between the former couple - Amrita Singh is 12 older - with several tweets joking that they inspired controversial TV show Pehredaar Piya Ki in which a nine-year-old boy marries an 18-year-old woman. At least, we think the tweets were jokes.\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh married in 1991 and divorced in 2004 and have two children. Their daughter Sara Ali Khan, 23, has been cast in her first film - filmmaker Abhishek Kapoor's Kedarnath opposite Sushant Singh Rajput - and her mother is often spotted with her at dinner with her director and co-star.\n\nSaif is now married to actress Kareena Kapoor and the couple have an eight-month-old son named Taimur.\n\nAmrita Singh was last seen in Hindi Medium, starring Irrfan Khan. Saif Ali Khan starred in February release Rangoon with Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut and has three films in the making - Chef, Baazaar and Kaalakaandi.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
