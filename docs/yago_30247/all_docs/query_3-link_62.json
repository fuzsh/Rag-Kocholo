        "text": "Bollywood actress Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan have two children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. After their divorce in 2004, both children stayed with their mother in the United States. As a single parent, Amrita Singh took care of her children.\n\nIt’s been 20 years since Bollywood stars Saif Ali Khan and Amrita got divorced. In these 20 years, Saif and Amrita were never seen together, but the children have maintained contact with Saif’s family.\n\nAmrita Singh To Remarry After 20 Years Of Divorce With Saif\n\nRecently, Amrita Singh revealed the real reason behind the divorce after so many years and also shared whether she plans to remarry or not.\n\nIn a recent interview, Bollywood Diva Amrita Singh discussed her thoughts on remarrying 20 years after her divorce from Saif. Her remarks have drawn significant attention.\n\nAmrita recently opened up in an interview with Pooja Bedi about her personal and professional life. Amrita said, “I don’t want to get married again, but you never know what might happen in the future. I am not 16 anymore. Probably not. But Yes To be honest, I don’t think so.”\n\nAmrita further stated, “You can’t say anything about the future. In reality, I have everything that a man could give me, except for a few things. But for those, I don’t need to get married.”\n\nPooja Bedi asked Amrita if she would leave her career if she remarried. The actress replied, “No, that’s why I won’t remarry. So that I know there’s no one to pay my bills. Therefore, I have to keep working.”\n\nIn fact, after marrying Saif, Amrita took a 12-year break from films. After their divorce, she started focusing on her career again. Post-divorce, she made a comeback in movies like ‘Shootout at Lokhandwala’, ‘Dus Kahaniyaan’, and ‘Kalyug’."
