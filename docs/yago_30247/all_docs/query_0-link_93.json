        "meta_description": "Saif Ali Khan has turned a year wiser today (August 16). On his birthday, we recently stumbled upon an old interview of the actor where he opened up about his ex-wife Amrita Singh not letting him meet his children Sara and Ibrahim. During a conversation with Telegraph, the 'Adipurush' actor said, 'My wife and I have gone our separate ways. I’m not allowed to meet my children. They aren’t allowed to come to visit me, let alone stay with me. I respect my wife’s space. But why am I being constantly reminded of how terrible a husband I was and how awful a father I am? I’ve my son Ibrahim’s photograph in my wallet. Each time I look at it, I feel like crying. I miss my daughter Sara all the time.' Notably, Saif and Amrita divorced in 2004, and the actor had to pay a huge alimony amount of Rs 5 crores and took care of the kids’ expenses till they turned 18. After his separation, Kareena Kapoor entered his life and things changed for the better. Saif often calls his life a 'bliss' with his darling Bebo. The couple got married in 2012 and are proud parents of two little munchkins - Taimur and Jeh. For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.",
