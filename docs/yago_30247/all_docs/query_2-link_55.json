        "text": "Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan, whose love life has always been a talk of the town, has admitted to have a nasty split with his first wife Amrita Singh. The couple, who was married for 13 years, parted ways 2004 and their divorce indeed got the tinselvile buzzing, given that it was a love marriage for Saif and Amrita who had an age gap of seven years.\n\nTalking about his divorce during one of his interviews in 2005, Saif admitted that his relationship with Amrita had gone terribly wrong, but it wasn't because of his then girlfriend Rosa Catalano, but because of Singh herself. Khan averred that Amrita used to insult his mother and sister constantly, resulting which he decided to part ways with Singh. \"It isn’t nice to be constantly reminded of how worthless you are and to have taunts, jeers, insults and abuses thrown at your mother and sister all the time. I’ve gone through all of it,\" Saif Ali Khan was quoted as saying.\n\nAlso Read | I would love Sara to be launched by Karan Johar, says Saif Ali Khan\n\nThe 'Agent Vinod' actor had also spoken about how heartbroken he was for being separated from his kids Sara and Ibrahim. Reportedly, Amrita didn't allow the kids to meet Khan as he was dating someone else.\n\n\"My wife and I have gone our separate ways. I respect my wife’s space. But why am I being constantly reminded of how terrible a husband I was, and how awful a father I am. I’ve my son Ibrahim’s photograph in my wallet. Each time I look at it, I feel like crying. I miss my daughter Sarah all the time. I’m not allowed to meet my children. They aren’t allowed to come to visit me, let alone stay with me. Why? Because there’s a new woman in my life who’d influence my children against their mother. That’s so much hogwash and Amrita knows it. Right now my kids are growing up with Amrita’s relatives and maidservants while she’s out working in a TV serial. Why does she need to do that, when I’m more than willing to support my family,” said Saif.\n\nInterestingly, apart from their split, the alimony issue between Saif-Amrita also reportedly grabbed the headlines back then. According to the media reports, Amirta Singh demanded Rs 5 crore as alimony from Saif who was suffering from a financial crunch in 2000s.\n\n“I’m supposed to give Amrita INR 5 crore, of which I’ve already given her approximately INR 2.5 crore. Also, I’m paying INR 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18. I’m not Shah Rukh Khan. I don’t have that kind of money. I’ve promised her I’ll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I’ve to slog till I drop dead. Whatever I’ve earned from doing ads, stage shows and films is being given for my children. I’ve no money. Our bungalow is for Amrita and the kids, and never mind the relatives who’ve joined her after my departure,” Saif reportedly stated in the interview.\n\nWell, after around 13 years of divorce, both Amrita and Saif have surely let the bygones be bygones and share a cordial relationship. Now, the actor not just spend quality time with his kids, but both Saira and Ibrahim ever share a great equations with Saif's second wife Kareena Kapoor Khan.\n\nSaif and Kareena got married in 2012 after dating each other for a couple of years. The couple even has a son Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi.\n\nOn the work front, Saif Ali Khan is busy with his upcoming movie 'Chef' which is an Indian remake of Americam movie of the same name. Helmed by Raja Krishna Menon, the movie is expected to release in July this year."
