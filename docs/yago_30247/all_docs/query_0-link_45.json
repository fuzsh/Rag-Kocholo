        "text": "MUMBAI: Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan once were madly in love with each other. In 1991, they decided to elope because they wanted to be together so desperately. However, fate had other ideas for them, and in 2004 the couple called it quits after raising two beautiful children.\n\nAmrita chose the difficult decision to remain silent with dignity while Saif freely expressed his side of the tale in the media. However, Amrita explained in a previous interview why she never discussed what happened.\n\nAlso read: Shocking! Amrita Singh opens up about her past relationship with 'Gadar 2' star Sunny Deol; Says 'All my past relationships Still mean a lot to me’\n\nSaif candidly revealed how things went bad after he and Amrita separated. Amrita was questioned about why she decided to remain silent rather than give her side of the story in an earlier interview with Pooja Bedi for the well-known portal.\n\nAmrita stated, \"So much was being done and said so openly that what was I going to endorse. That's my personal opnion or hurt that I don't need to share with anyone and didn't feel to share with anyone. I had other thigns on my priority that needed my attention like my children and most importantly myself. I need to deail with myself. People like media and curious people were not on my prioirty list.\"\n\nAmrita was questioned about if her children, Sara and Ibrahim Ali Khan, showed off their famous mother. To which, Amrita then revealed, \"Oh yeah, now Sara does. I know, like Sara, at times, I used to be embarrassed when I was like all of size 16 and fat. I could see my daughter was embarrassed, 'Oh my mother such a motali'. But today I can see there is a sense of pride in my daughter's eyes.\"\n\nRumors that Saif and Amrita's love marriage ended were widespread in the early 2000s. They went through a divorce in 2004. Saif said he was sick of having arguments and getting yelled at all the time, while Amrita remained silent about her personal life. Saif Ali Khan reportedly paid Rs. 5 crores in alimony to his ex-wife, Amrita Singh.\n\nSaif was twelve years younger than Amrita. Saif wed Amrita in a secret ceremony in October 1991 despite everything. They had their share of ups and downs after that and stayed together for nearly ten years before being divorced. They parted ways on a sour note. Their relationship was the subject of numerous reports.\n\nAlso read:When Saif Ali Khan's former wife Amrita Singh rejected Ravi Shastri's proposal\n\nFor more news from the world of Cinema, OTT, and television, keep reading Tellychakkar.\n\nCredit- Bollywood shaadis"
