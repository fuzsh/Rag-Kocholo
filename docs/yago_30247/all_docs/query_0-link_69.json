        "text": "All About Saif and Amrita - After Divorce\n\n'I am an old chapter in Saif’s life now’\n\nAmrita breaks her silence\n\n10 Oct 2007, 0000 hrs IST,TNN\n\nContrary to reports, Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan are not getting back. Amrita breaks her silence, and rubbishes rumours about her getting back with ex-husband Saif.\n\nIn her characteristic firebrand style, Amrita says, “Let’s clarify this once and for all. I am fed up of this loose talk. Just because Saif and I were spotted at few places, does not imply that we will once again be husband and wife. Yes, we went to Salman and Sanju’s house but they are our common friends. We both have known them for a long time.”\n\nShe explains her current equation with Saif. “Saif is the father of our kids. He is family. But I have no plans to stay with him again. I am an old chapter in Saif's life.”\n\nAmrita refrains from speaking about Saif’s alleged affairs with Yana Gupta, Bipasha Basu and Kareena Kapoor. “Saif’s personal life is not my territory now. I don’t question him on that. He is free to do what he wants. We don’t talk about these things when we meet. So why should I even think about it, leave aside comment on it?” Amrita demands to know.\n\nFor the initiated: Since the past few weeks, the buzz doing the rounds is that Amrita and Saif have decided to get back together. It was even being said that Saif’s split with his Italian girlfriend Rozza Catalano was due to bonding with Amrita all over again.\n\nAmrita and Saif were spotted coming out from Salman Khan’s house. Few days later, they were seen dining together at a suburban restaurant and taking their kids for a swim at a suburban five-star hotel. Recently, they went to Sanjay Dutt’s house too. These outings led to speculation that they have kissed and made up.\n\nSaif is my past...(March 12, 2007)\n\nAmrita Singh reacts to rumours that Khan’s break-up with Italian girlfriend Rosa Catalano was because of their ‘renewed’ friendship\n\nWhen a much-in-the-news couple breaks up, a lot is made of their parting and the blame game begins. Everyone, from the former partner to the family and sometimes even close friends, is to blame.\n\nSo when Saif Ali Khan and his girlfriend of two years Rosa Catalano decided to part ways, ex-wife Amrita Singh, his family and even Rosa’s budding television career were put in the dock.\n\n‘Not my business’\n\nHowever, Amrita Singh refutes that she has anything to do with the break-up. What’s more, she’s angry about certain sections of the press alluding to a patch-up between her and her former husband. “Saif is my past. What he does is not my business or concern,” is all she is willing to say.\n\nBut a source close to Saif puts things in perspective. “Amrita has not visited Saif since he returned home (he recently suffered from a heart condition), though she did go to see him at the hospital with the kids (Sara and Ebrahim).\n\nEven though they remain in touch, stories about him and Amrita getting back together are not true. Saif is extremely focussed on his career.\n\nHe had some great releases last year and won several awards for his performance in Omkara. He’s also in the process of signing new films and has just launched his production company, Illuminati Films, with producer Dinesh Vijan.\n\nAs you can see, there’s really no time for a personal life. At present, he is concentrating on getting back to work.”\n\n‘I respect Amrita’\n\nOn Sunday night’s episode of Koffee with Karan, Saif spoke at length about his marriage and split with Amrita, telling Karan Johar, “I have matured because of all kinds of non-settling thoughts, experiences, paranoias, and being judged and accepted. It has made me tougher.\n\nI was extremely well taken care of. Now I must do things like running a home, which is something I have never done.\n\nI am getting there. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Amrita. I’d really like us to be friends one day.”\n\nBut Amrita refuses to comment on Saif’s statement. She says bluntly, “I have said what I have to. Now please keep me out of this.”\n\nMeanwhile, the source says Saif and Rosa’s parting was amicable. “It’s pointless to blame other people for the break-up. Only they know what really went wrong.\n\nRosa has gone back to Switzerland, but there was no bitterness or acrimony between them. Saif and she are sensible, mature individuals and want different things in life.\n\nThey were in a relationship for over two years, so naturally, it will take some time for them to recover and get back on their feet,” says the source.\n\nIt is expected that Rosa will return to India in a few weeks time, as she was getting ready to launch a glamourous career here before the unexpected break-up.\n\nThere have been talks about her anchoring a fashion-based television show for a while now, and sources say pretty much everything has been put in place.\n\nSaif and his ex-Amrita Singh visit Sanjay Dutt together (Aug 27th 2007)\n\nFirst the heart issue and then, a break-up with girlfriend Rosa; this is apparently led to Saif getting close to his ex-wife Amrita Singh and we were surprised to see the duo visit Sanjay Dutt together.\n\nSaif drove in his Lexus with ex-wife Amrita and daughter Sara seated in the back to visit Munnabhai. On the way out, their daughter Sara insisted on seeing Sanjay Dutt’s red Ferrari in the garage. While Sara admired the Ferrari, Amrita and Saif stood there joking; they behaved like any normal couple.\n\nSaif also got the door for Amrita on their way out. After stories of Bipasha going back to John, there were rumors of Dia helping Saif get over his drinking habit and was playing nurse to his ailing heart but, now with Saif getting close to his ex-Amrita, we are not sure for how long Dia’s ‘pyaar ka Dia’ will be lit for Saif.\n\nCheckout pictures of friends and family, who greeted Sanjay Dutt after he returned to Mumbai in his chartered flight from Yerwada Jail in Pune upon approval of his bail plea.\n\nWill Saif Ali Khan get back with former wife Amrita Singh? (April 10, 2007)\n\nSaif Ali Khan and his new home raise possibilities of his getting back with former wife Amrita Singh.\n\n10 April 2007(Sawf News) - Saif Ali Khan and his new home raise possibilities of his getting back with former wife Amrita Singh.\n\nKaran Johar recently decided to move into a new home on the seafront of Bandra to be near his buddy SRK. It is now being reported that Saif Ali Khan, recovering from his recent illness, has also chosen to move to the same location but for (Thankfully!) a different reason.\n\nSaif wants to 'own' his home and move from his rented flat in Andheri to a new pad in Bandra.\n\n\"It will be quiet and lonesome - I have no one to go home to any more because I am single,\" says Saif, \"I do miss companionship and romance in my life but my new home is open and planned for the eventual companion who will come into my life. I am enjoying a new serenity in life because intense love - which too has its place in life - makes one selfish. One wants to get home quickly after work and even hang up when one's mum calls. I want to enjoy the love that surrounds me now and my single status, because I can give 100 per cent to the many films I am doing this year.\"\n\nSaif was recently seen dancing away for big bucks (with Bipasha Basu, Katrina Kaif, Sonu Nigam, Sushmita Sen and Akshay Kumar), at the Vaswani family wedding in Dubai. Vaswanis are Kenyan billionaires and have many friends in Bollywood.\n\nHowever, some friends say that Saif's conversations these days are heavily peppered with praises of Amrita Singh, his former wife, who he thinks is a great actress. Is he working quietly towards getting back with her and the children?\n\nMeanwhile, on another front, Rosa, his ex-girlfriend, is back in Mumbai, ready to enter the glamour world with her debut as an anchor for designers Shane and Falguni Peacock's television show on fashion and style! The story gets edgy every day!\n\nSAIF: NO PLAN TO MARRY AGAIN\n\nSaif Ali Khan son of former captain of Indian cricket team Mansoor Ali Khan and famous star Sharmila Tagore, is now a successful actor. However, he has traveled a long way in his profession. Director Rahul Rawel gave his 'Bekhudi' to Saif but the latter lost it because of his carelessness. But Saif turned serious and improved his acting skill in his every film. Thus he proved his talent in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. From here his career's graph soared to new heights that prompted several directors to make offers to him in plenty. Saif has given so many hit movie like 'Hum Tum' opposite Rani Mukherjee, 'Hum Saath Saath Hain' with Salman, Sonali Bendre, Karisma Kapoor, Tabu, Mohnish Behl and Neelam, 'Kal Ho Naa Ho' with Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta besides 'Ek Hassina Thi' opposite Rani Mukherjee and 'LoC', 'Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega' and many others. However, the success in career brought misfortune in his family life. He divorced his wife another famous actress Amrita Singh. Recently we met with Saif and discussed about his personal life during our chat.\n\nExcerpts of the chat:\n\nIs it true that you have divorced your wife Amrita Singh?\n\nYes, this is true. I have divorced her. However, it's tough for me to say that this is a right or a wrong step. I am happy that we have not parted from each other on a bitter memory. I give respect to her; she is mother of my children. Since we differ from each other, we couldn't live together any more. Now, every thing is fine. I am satisfied that Amrita and my children are economically strong. I have changed my residence, and given our bungalow to Amrita.\n\nTell us something about your children?\n\nAmrita is mother and warden of my children. They are in joint custody. I can see them whenever I want. This is a serious topic and I don't want my children to read something wrong about this. They are intelligent, and understand these things better. My daughter Sara has understood the situation very well.\n\nWhat about Amrita?\n\nWe have spent 13 years together, and I respect her very much. She is a good actress and she does whatever she enjoys. I think she doesn't need to work now.\n\nWhat happened between both of you that led to a divorce?\n\nMany things are responsible for it. Yet, we tried our level best to improve our relations, but I regret to say that we failed. I am happy that we separated without any bitterness. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings so I wouldn't say much more about it.\n\nHas any other woman entered your life? Would you tell us about her?\n\nI had met with her only about three months ago. This is not a secret though, Amrita also knows about her. I never hide anything from people; I don't want to hurt any body.\n\nWould you marry again?\n\nNo, I have no such idea in my mind.\n\nTIME TO DISCO\n\nEverything’s new in Saif Ali Khan’s life. New interests, new modelling assignments and new-found fame. So he sees no reason to keep an old wife\n\nIn some high-tech, all-secure laboratory, men and women in white coats are no doubt doing all they can to get to the bottom of an old debate: does reel life influence real life, or is it the other way around? They should have just asked Saif Ali Khan.\n\nMonths before the buzz about his impending marital split reached a crescendo, the Hindi film hero was play-acting a script for a commercial — and settling the debate for once and for all that it was the reel life that called the shots. With a packet of potato chips in his hands and a glint in his eyes, old Saif hinted at what was to follow in his real life with words akin to: “Bet you can’t have just one!”\n\nThose of you who think that he was referring not so much to a wafer as to a wife may be forgiven. For it now transpires that the actor — a hit of the new millennium — is seemingly following one of the golden rules of success: Climb new heights, dump old wife.\n\nEarlier this week, gossip-wires hotted up when the couple’s friends — as anonymous as they were reportedly dear — said that 34-year-old Saif and his wife, Amrita, were separating.\n\nFor long years, as Saif — the eldest child of actor Sharmila Tagore and former cricketer, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi — tried to squeeze his way into Bollywood, he and wife Amrita were a hit couple. Now, as a series of hits catapults Saif to the top, he is ready to leave his wife.\n\nThe story is ironic, for Saif’s parents have touched a record of sorts by making their marriage work in a world where partners are changed as often as socks. And in Mumbai’s film industry, even the younger Khans’ marriage was often referred to as one of those made-to-order gifts from heaven.\n\nLegend has it that Amrita Singh — Dingy to friends — met Saif at a party and invited him home, urging him to bring his own bottle of Scotch. Saif came, bottle in hand, and later said: “I never left.”\n\nBut the senior Khans had been appalled when Saif, then just 21, announced that he was going to marry the daughter of an old Sanjay Gandhi crony, Rukshana Sultana. They did their best to dissuade him from taking what they thought was a rash step. But Saif did not budge.\n\nThis time, if the murmurs are to be believed, Saif’s parents have been trying to persuade him not to leave his wife and two children.\n\nBut Saif, the reports say, is adamant. And the film world, where three Khans — Shah Rukh, Aamir and Saif — were once synonyms for marital stability, is suitably heart-broken, Aamir having earlier flown the coop.\n\nSimi Garewal, who interviewed the couple on her popular television show, told a newspaper: “I haven’t been in touch (with them) but I hope it’s just a phase and they get back together. It’s too early for an obit.”\n\nStrangely, marital obituaries go hand-in-hand with professional paeans. After his eminently forgettable 1992 debut, Parampara, Saif was scornfully laughed off by cinema-goers and critics. But the last few years have seen the rise of Saif — both on the big screen and in television commercials.\n\nA critic describes him as the multiplex star — a suave and urbane hero who gels well with a similar audience. Which is why, some argue, he essentially made his mark with the funky Farhan Akhtar film, Dil Chahta Hai. And while a popular second lead, he really came into his own with the 2004 hit, Hum Tum.\n\nBut Saif has always been a bit of a misfit in the industry. A Wykehamist — as old students of Winchester College in England like to call themselves — Saif has some out-of-the-Bollywood-box traits: he plays a mean guitar and did a fairly commendable sculpture of a lion for an international art exhibition in Singapore a few months ago. In interviews, he candidly speaks about being propositioned by a man when he was a teenager and flinging his pet cat from an upstairs window.\n\nSo far, it seemed that even in marriage, Saif had carved his own path. But that’s one myth gone bust. And it seems that the one who saw it coming was his son, Ibrahim.\n\nReports suggest that every time the three-year-old sees a man kissing a woman on the screen, he yells excitedly: That’s my dad!\n\nWe told you, reel life rules.\n\nAmrita’s back in action\n\nAT one time she was the toast of the celebrity world. The fresh-faced Amrita Singh had an eventful filmi career behind her and Saif Ali Khan for a husband.\n\nAlas, times change. Amrita is back in news ever since her marriage with Saif came apart. But the doughty lady is taking charge of her life and getting back to acting which she had left abruptly at a time when she was destined to be No. 1.\n\nTwenty years after she clocked her first big hit, Betaab opposite Sunny Deol, Amrita will soon be seen on the screen — the small one for the moment. She has been offered a pivotal role in a new Ektaa Kapoor soap.\n\nThough some feel that this might be her way of cocking a snook at Saif who strongly disapproved of her acting, others say Amrita is a gritty lady and is making a serious comeback bid with the support of none other than her mother-in-law, Sharmila Tagore.\n\nKoffee with Karan!\n\nMen love him?women love him? kids love him? critics love him? cynics love him? everybody loves him! Versatility is now being touted as his latest virtue! This trendy nawab actually surprised audiences by getting a rural dialect pitch perfect in his recent big hit- Omkara! Karan?s first guest this week is a superstar, a fighter, a survivor, but most importantly? the actor ? Saif Ali Khan. His second guest is a member of Saif?s family and a representative of Gen-Next in Bollywood. An actress who has strongly made her presence felt in one of the most acclaimed films of 2006 ? Rang De Basanti - Soha Ali Khan! Meet the royal brother-sister duo in an exciting and heartwarming episode, this Sunday, March 11th at 9 p.m. only on Star One and Star World only on Koffee with Karan!\n\nKaran: Do you get along with Rosa?\n\nSoha: Yes! Again? I?ve only spent time when Bhai and her are together but I?ve spent some time with her and she?s very nice. And she?s a very kind and warm person and she?s a very good cook!\n\nKaran: And that helps?\n\nSoha: It always helps!\n\nKaran: Was it difficult for you to make the transition from Amrita to Rosa? Was it difficult for you emotionally because you had to deal with two different people in the same time zone?\n\nSaif: Tell her to shut up! Tell him? Let?s talk about Rang De Basanti?\n\nSoha: Ok! I think he wants me to tell you that!\n\nKaran: Ok! You can tell me to shut up?\n\nSaif: No! No! Carry on?\n\nKaran: Ok? we wont shut up then.. was it tough?\n\nSoha: No! It wasn?t tough? I have a sort of independent relationship with most people? I think we?re quite a strange family as well. We all have our independent lives but we?re very close! I think I related to bhabhi as bhai?s wife at the same time as well as a person-to-person as I relate to her now so in that sense they?re 2 separate relationships!\n\nSaif: And again? if you ask me? it becomes like a comparison.. and there is none.. between anybody? its wrong?wrong to compare and the times we had in the past?whatever it was.. its not right to discuss it too much on camera because some things are so private. There were great things? were great times? obviously if you choose to be married?\n\nKaran: What is your take on the institution?\n\nSoha: I still believe in it! I look forward to it! I see myself married at some point? I think it?s unfortunate at times. It?s a promise between 2 people and sometimes you?re unable to fulfill the promise. That?s always sad when that breaks but I think there?s lots going for it.\n\nSaif: I think there?s a lot going for it as well. I don?t know if I said that?\n\nKaran: Though I?m fairly cynical about the institution but that?s just me!\n\nKaran: So is there anyone around?\n\nSoha: No? not at the moment!\n\nKaran: Your single?\n\nSoha: Yes? single..\n\nKaran: No Prince of Morocco?\n\nSoha: No! That?s bizarre.\n\nKaran: I read it somewhere that the Prince of Morocco proposed to you?\n\nSoha: We should ask my parents that because they?ll know more than me. Sometimes proposals come that are filtered?\n\nKaran: And they filtered this proposal? What were they thinking?\n\nSoha: I need to ask my mother about it because there was some talk of a Moroccan connection?\n\nKaran: Would you like your sister to marry the Prince of Morocco?\n\nSaif: Nice summer holiday?\n\nKaran: And that?s the only reason you would like her to marry him?\n\nSaif: I don?t know.. What are these Morrocan?s like?\n\nSoha: I went to Morocco with a blonde female friend of mine and over there you?re offered camels in place of women. So of course being blonde and blue-eyed she was offered 300 camels. The gentleman who we were with was offered 300 camels in place of her and 5 camels for me because I look typically Arabic.\n\nSaif: Does this happen? Does the transaction go through?\n\nSoha: Presumably! I don?t know where you would keep 300 camels though!\n\nKaran: Certainly not in any of your homes for sure!\n\nKaran: Your versatility is being most talked about especially post- Omkara!\n\nSaif: Yeah! That was quite surprising!\n\nKaran: You were surprised?\n\nSaif: I was quite surprised that Vishal cast me? Actually I was on location in Jaipur and my mother told me something just a day before that ?You should do something Shakespearean? You should play Othello!? Just the next day Vishal Bhardwaj rang up and told me, ?I want to come to meet you.. I?m planning on making Othello! And I was like wow.. that?s some coincidence! He came down to Jaipur and he was like, ?Not to play Othello, to play Iago and naturally I had this paranoia? ?Dude.. you see something evil in me? Why??? He saw Dil Chahta Hai!\n\nKaran: But there was no reflection of Langda tyagi in Dil Chahta Hai!\n\nSaif: He liked Dil Chahta Hai! And said that, ?As an actor if you can do that, you can definitely do this!? But he said you have to completely change everything, which made me think that it would be better to go with someone who?s actually different! I would have to shave my head, which I have some kind of samsonian phobia about.\n\nKaran: Were you actually hysterical you had to do that?\n\nSaif: It was on Eid and I was sitting there and he said consider this auspicious day to qurbaan karo your baal!\n\nKaran: Dramatic!\n\nKaran: Were you insecure initially that you weren?t playing Omkara?\n\nSaif: I asked him you know.. Why can?t I play Omkara? Or Othello? And he said, ?You know Othello?s got an underlying complex about his looks and I think you are really handsome!?\n\nKaran: But I think that worked out well because that really turned out to be the performance of the film!\n\nSaif: In a way that?s interesting and nice? I remember cinema from my point of view in Bombay. Change was not really encouraged? I mean if you had a hit with a particular hairstyle? even character names is something people still stick to!\n\nKaran: They all start with R and sound very generic! So from Langda Tyagi as a character name and the character in mainstream cinema along with the trappings, generally with a big cast and everything? It was break through in that sense!\n\nSaif: And I think things have changed! People like to watch new things. They judge actors. They don?t think you can only do certain type of roles. Like there is this massage boy.. Irshaad.. who comes home.. He?s like, ?Don?t you think now track badal jayega?? So I?m like, ?track badal jayega means what?? He?s like, ?No like people will only see you as a villain now!?\n\nKaran: No! I would say there?s an archaic way of looking at things but you?ve been through the whole process.\n\nKaran: Saif, when you came in.. you were criticized for being too western and no one really thought you will make it to the point you have! And now you are considered the first metrosexual hero that Indian cinema has to offer.\n\nSaif: You better stop that because apparently it?s quite in after the Bond film to be rugged! So don?t call me metrosexy now!\n\nKaran: We don?t know what the word really means!\n\nSaif: is it Gay?\n\nKaran: No its not! It?s definitely not gay!\n\nSaif: Yeah! We know what it means.. I mean I do have a couple of creams in my bathroom that I like to use!\n\nKaran: And do you go for a manicure or pedicure?\n\nSaif: Once in a while! I feel having really ragged nails and split cuticles is no good! People judge people by their hands. I was told that! I look at hands quite a lot!\n\nKaran: Oh dear! (Hiding hands)\n\nKaran: Omkara and versatility of course the superstardom! Does it surprise you?\n\nSaif: I won?t call it superstardom!\n\nKaran: It is! I?m calling it that and I?m from the inner circles of the film fraternity so if I?m saying it.. it must be true!\n\nSaif: You are the circle of the film fraternity!\n\nKaran: No I?m not! You are viable commercially? your critics love you ? everyone loves you! I know I?m gushing right now but it?s all true!\n\nSaif: I think I?ve been at it for sometime and I?ve learnt and grown. With all this also comes a sense of responsibility and this is my life! I?m really not capable of doing anything else as rewarding in every way- emotionally, financially. This is all I can do and I?m happy I can do it well! But its become more than getting happy.. getting a compliment or something? There?s a long way to go! There?s an entire life to take care of. This is my way of supporting myself and very seriously it?s my career? it?s what drives me! I?ve learnt that I need to do it and it?s very much a part of who I am?\n\nKaran: Speaking of your life and your responsibilities? things have changed dramatically even in your personal life? I mean there were things which were different a few years back and now.. post your marital split, has life been difficult emotionally?\n\nSaif: At times yes! When you?re in the public eye it is clich頴o say? you live under a microscope? it is disturbing and annoying at times being constantly discussed and you feel like defending yourself. At times you want to prove yourself that you?re a nice guy and didn?t mean to hurt anyone and again I?ve matured and I just shut up and try and be as nice as possible. I never claimed to say that I have all the answers in life. I just found myself in situations that were difficult to deal with and made my way? muddled my way through it trying not to upset anyone and unavoidably I suppose I did?\n\nKaran: You think you handled the situation well personally?\n\nSaif: No! I?m absolutely rubbish at handling situations well! Well ? is the stuff of history? Well is the stuff of men who do difficult things and have conversations and are clear and honest and I think psychologically it boils down to a simple thing of delaying gratification and I?m not very good at that .. I would prefer instant gratification. Yes.. I think I could have handled it better or more clearly- little more man-style opposed to boyish kind of ? Looking back I wouldn?t call it regret because I feel what has happened has happened for the best but yes, the way it happened its not very easy with so much media attention? At one time I felt most comfortable with waiters at restaurants because they smiled and acted normal and were happy to see me?\n\nKaran: You feel they weren?t judging you?\n\nSaif: Yeah! Then I realized? that?s a little silly!\n\nKaran: Ok! We were talking about your marriage and what happened.. and you said you may not have handled it to the best of your ability!\n\nSaif: But you know what happened in retrospect. Perhaps its easier to say but you know .. to sit down and do the right thing, say the right thing at the right time.. most of the people wait for catalysts to move them and when that happens sometimes it makes things difficult to be respectful or friendly and I think that?s really important. I really do owe a lot I believe? and I have a tremendous amount of respect for my ex-wife- Amrita and I would really like us to be friends one day?\n\nKaran: What?s your current equation with her?\n\nSaif: It?s still a little early or fresh..\n\nKaran: Did you feel the fraternity? not just people by and large?because Amrita has been in the industry?\n\nSaif: You know? completely aside from Amrita? what I did feel.. there?s many aspects that I felt. I think I did learn that marriage is a very serious institution. I think I was very young also? im not making excuses for myself but I was really 21! I really did not know what I know now! And that is that it is a very serious institution and society is built around it and if you have a lot of people walking around breaking that, it?s a threat to society so people look at you like..ok! I don?t know if you should be here? fortunately you are a star, you are doing well protects you..so I am actually thankful to the industry for protecting me.. but most if all I found that the strength and the survival came from myself! Because when I did walk into a room and I felt a certain amount of ostracized?what is it? Ultimately it didn?t matter?ultimately it actually didn?t matter because if you feel what you are doing is right! It?s a very big deal also because I cant imagine the effect this would have on Sarah and Ibrahim. I just pray and will make every effort possible. One thing is there? Sarah did say to me, ?You spend more quality time with me now.. than ever before?. I?m not saying that?s great and that everything?s fine but that is something special!\n\nKaran: So you are being more of a father to them today!\n\nSaif: Yes! There have been many catalysts! I think ultimately my being honest to myself has translated to being more courageous and honest as an actor.\n\nKaran: Are you a better actor post your split?\n\nSaif: I don?t know if its just age or if it?s a certain amount of mental maturity as a result of all kinds of non-settling thoughts, experiences and paranoia?s and being judged and accepted. But it makes you tougher? I was extremely well taken care of! And now I must? as a man? do that myself? which is something I?ve never done? like running a home! I?m getting there!\n\nKaran: But you have someone with you now?\n\nSaif: Yes I do!\n\nKaran: You?re dating an Italian girl- Rosa!\n\nSaif: Yes? That?s right!\n\nKaran: And you?ve been out with her and it?s a relationship you?ve even gone on record and admitted to!\n\nSaif: Yes? I mean? ofcourse!\n\nKaran: Of course! You can?t deny something like that! So do you see a future there or you don?t want to say anything yet? You want to take life as it comes?\n\nSaif: No! It?s not as casual as that! I think any relationship I get into would be because I see certain things in a person that I would be willing to go with. At the same time I don?t know if I can set a time limit or say tomorrow this will happen or that will happen. I hope things work out like a fairy tale but at the same time its not something I plan too much about? I do think about the future but I think perhaps, because of things I?ve been through myself?\n\nKaran: I suppose you are just taking life as it comes?\n\nSaif: Not as it comes but with a certain amount of expectation. I hope things work out? I really hope things work out?.\n\nKaran: The equation with your kids and Rosa? Is that good?\n\nSaif: Umm! Actually I think so! I was going to say Yes?!\n\nKaran: But you do you think so?\n\nSaif: because I always feel sort of awkward answering for other people. I mean there have been times ? my children have expressed a lot of happiness. Its so weird for me. I still can?t believe sometimes that I?m in this situation but I said that obviously, clearly Rosa is not your mother or mother-figure. Let?s not even go there? if you can just be a friend with no expectation or no horrific step-mother nightmare fantasy or anything like that? and lets see how it goes and I think the time we?ve spent together has actually been more positive? frankly than when ive been alone? whether its teaching Ibrahim skiing or celebrating a holiday or doing things together ? the energy has been very positive and extremely healthy and something that I think they enjoy. Beyond that?I don?t know!\n\nKaran: Have you felt you?ve received a tremendous amount of support from your family? Be it your sisters, your parents vis-୶is Rosa and the situation. Have they been a big support to you?\n\nSaif: I think they have been supportive!\n\nKaran: Lets use a word that?s harsh? Do they ?approve??\n\nSaif: That?s tough again! I would say they would approve of certain aspects of it and perhaps initially they wouldn?t have approved of the way things happened to me or said ?Great!?. Let me say it another way?Yes its important for me what they think and its important for me most of the time to be a good son or good person and if I got a call saying ?I don?t approve!? I would be?\n\nKaran: Shattered?\n\nSaif: No, not shattered but I would be like Oh no! But I think a situation like this.. if its possible for parents to respect a child? they?ve been respectful of that! They?ve always said .. as long as you are happy, we?re supportive! It?s also something to do with Rosa being with my parents and having her own equation with them.\n\nKaran: Does she make an effort?\n\nSaif: I don?t know if its an effort? I think its very natural.\n\nKaran: Has she ever met Amrita?\n\nSaif: I believe so? I introduced them to each other?\n\nKaran: Was that at a party I was at? at Abhishek?s!\n\nSaif: Yes you were standing there..\n\nKaran: Was that the first time?\n\nSaif: You were looking at us from the eyes at the back of your head?\n\nKaran: Was I? That?s mean!\n\nSaif: You were clearly looking there the whole time?\n\nKaran: Was it awkward for you?\n\nSaif: Well it wasn?t something I was? I knew it was inevitable. It was not something I was looking forward to massively or enjoying? I just thought if there?s any such thing as doing the right thing? I just did?\n\nKaran: You introduced Rosa to her?\n\nSaif: Yes!\n\nKaran: I was actually talking to Saif about the support system he had and that time when he had the split because I know you were close to his ex-wife?\n\nSoha: Ofcourse! I?ve lived with both of them? When I first moved to Bombay for over a year? I lived with them.\n\nKaran: Was it tough on you when it happened?\n\nSoha: Ofcourse! I mean it affects everybody. I was not staying there at that point of time when it happened. I?d moved out already but I was close to bhabhi? I?d stayed in her house? it was a stressful time for everyone? I had conversations with the both of them and it is hard but?\n\nKaran: When you say ?was?? are things still the same today or have they changed?\n\nSoha: Things have changed! I?m not as close to bhabhi as I was. We don?t see each other that much. We don?t talk as much which I think at times is inevitable but I think we were all essentially worried about the children more than anything? about Ibrahim and Sarah but they seem to be doing fine. I think kids these days are very grown up. They understand things. I think communication helps and I think they are being spoken to by everybody and they are doing well.\n\nKaran: Have you seen Rang De Basanti, Saif?\n\nSaif: I saw half of it!\n\nSoha: The first half!\n\nSaif: I?m very bad!\n\nKaran: That?s awful. You haven?t seen your sister?s big film! And your comments on that?\n\nSoha: Well? he did come for the premiere, which was very nice and supportive. He stayed for the first half. He had to go. I don?t know.. It has been a year though!\n\nKaran: Theres something known as a DVD, Saif!\n\nSoha: Yeah! Which he has many of! I?m sure you have good reason? What was that again?\n\nKaran: What was the reason, Saif?\n\nSaif: There?s actually no excuse! I just don?t watch that many movies!\n\nKaran: And what compelled you to leave after the first half? I mean people just loved the film? didn?t you?\n\nSaif: I had to attend a senior member of the film fraternity?s wedding!\n\nKaran: Who was that?\n\nSoha: Riddhima was getting married? Rishi Kapoor?s daughter?\n\nKaran: So clearly Rishi Kapoor was more important than Rang De Basanti?\n\nSaif: I?m sure he?l like that! But.. in my defence.. I?ve never seen Aradhna, Amar Prem. Ive seen Mausam. I?ve never seen Amma?s films.\n\nKaran: How did you think things worked out for Saif? Did you think he would be where he is today?\n\nSoha: Fifteen years ago? No!\n\nKaran: What did you think he?d land up doing? Land up in an asylum?\n\nSoha: I thought he?d be a guitarist in a small band?\n\nKaran: Small band! She didn?t even think you?d be a successful rockstar.\n\nSoha: I just remember him with long red hair coming back from university?from school..\n\nKaran: And he was a ladies? man. Wasn?t he? There were many women?\n\nSoha: There were some? yes!\n\nKaran: I knew there was an older women fixation which finally worked out well in a sense and then not. There were also others he was linked with?\n\nSoha: There were some.. I was very young and he used to baby-sit me in England. When I was 5, he used to take me to the pub which was not allowed and he would make me do ?adaab? to all his English friends. All the women found that very endearing. He would take my pocket money.. 5 pounds.. you took from me?\n\nKaran: So there were women in his life and you saw all of that?\n\nSoha: No! Not all of it! Some of it! I went to bed early! (Laughs)\n\nKaran: Do you feel proud today?\n\nSoha: Hugely! I?ve seen all his films!\n\nKaran: Contrary to you!\n\nSaif: In many cases that?s quite an achievement!\n\nSoha: I haven?t seen all of them! Ive seen all the good ones and Im so proud of him and of what hes achieved. Ive spent more time with him in the last 3 years and now that Im also working in films I end up meeting him more often even if its on the set.\n\nKaran: Tell us something about Saif that we don?t know? Is he scared of his father?\n\nSoha: I think he has more respect and admiration for his father.. more than anyone on the planet?\n\nSaif: fear is a bit dark?\n\nSoha: fear is a bit dark.. I think when you respect someone you look up to them?\n\nKaran: and with mum?\n\nSoha: With Amma? It?s an easier friendship? an ability to talk more openly..\n\nKaran: How did you think things worked out for Saif? Did you think he would be where he is today?\n\nSoha: Fifteen years ago? No!\n\nKaran: Do you feel proud of him today?\n\nSoha: Hugely! I?ve seen all his films!\n\nKaran: Contrary to you!\n\nSaif: In many cases that?s quite an achievement!\n\nSoha: I haven?t seen all of them! I?ve seen all the good ones and I?m so proud of him and of what he?s achieved. I?ve spent more time with him in the last 3 years and now that I?m also working in films I end up meeting him more often even if it?s on the set."
