        "text": "Do you know Amrita Singh gave sleeping pills to Saif Ali Khan during the filming of Hum Saath Saath Hain? Dig inside to know why!\n\nNew Delhi: Many don’t know that Saif Ali Khan was going through a personal turmoil while shooting for his 1999 film, Hum Saath Saath Hain. However, his personal life’s ups and downs impacted his sleep, leading him to take several re-takes during the shooting of the film. Helmed by Sooraj Barjatya, the film boasts an ensemble cast of Salman Khan, Tabu, Mohnish Behl, Karisma Kapoor, and Sonali Bendre.\n\nWhen Saif took sleeping pills\n\nIn an old interview, Sooraj Barjatya once revealed that Saif Ali Khan’s personal life was going through several ups and downs during the shooting of Hum Saath Saath Hain. Due to stress and tension, he was taking several re-takes during the shoot of the song, Suno Ji Dulhan, as he was not sleeping all night, thinking about how to portray the character in the popular film in a good way. Barjatya learned about the same when he spoke to Amrita Singh, Saif Ali Khan’s first wife.\n\n“As he was not sleeping through the night, I gave Amrita a piece of advice. Amrita was advised to give him sleeping pills without Saif’s knowledge. She gave him sleeping pills without his knowledge. So many of his scenes were arranged the next day. He did it. The song gave a very good shot in one take. Everyone was shocked as he gave a very good shot,” he added.\n\nSaif and Amrita Singh’s marriage\n\nSaif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh got married in October 1991 and the duo welcomed their kids, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. Saif was just 20 when he tied the knot with Amrita, who was 12 years older to him. In 2004, they got separated. Now, Saif is married to Kareena Kapoor Khan and the duo have two kids, Taimur and Jeh. Amrita Singh, on the other hand, remained single after her divorce from Saif and raised her both children."
