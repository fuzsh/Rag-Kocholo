        "text": "Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor keep giving us #RelationshipGoals every now and then, either with their vacation photos, or cute moments with baby Taimur (and their fab life, in general).\n\nBut it wasn't always that rosy for Saif, who had divorced with his first wife, Amrita Singh way back in 2004, culminating a marriage of thirteen years.\n\nLooks like Saif has a thing for age gaps; while he is 10 years older to current spouse Kareena, he was 13 years younger to his ex-wife Amrita Singh!\n\nBack in the 90s, following an traditional Islamic wedding, the duo had tied the knot, and created a lot of buzz. Amrita Singh has left her career in acting for marriage, and together they became parents to Sara and Ibrahim.\n\nAfter his divorce from Amrita, an interview given by Saif in 2005, is now going viral again, where he was talking about his divorce- it's reasons, alimony and the whole after-effects.\n\n\"It isn't nice to be constantly reminded of how worthless you are and to have taunts, jeers, and abuses thrown at your mother and sister all the time. I've gone through all of it.\"\n\nIt wasn't an easy separation, back then when the actor was not yet established and still trying to find his place in the industry. He quoted,\"I'm supposed to give Amrita Rs. 5 crore, of which I've already given her approximately Rs. 2.5 crore. Also, I'm paying Rs. 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18. I'm not Shah Rukh Khan. I don't have that kind of money. I've promised her I'll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I've to slog till I drop dead.\"\n\nHis quote makes it clear how far Saif has come in his career. The ex-couple definitely deserves an applause to have overcome such a difficult phase in life."
