        "text": "Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh, who parted ways after 13 years of marriage, have two kids together- Sara and Ibrahim Ali Khan.\n\nSaif and Amrita made headlines back then owing to their age gap when they got married. While Saif was 21, Amrita was 33 when they tied the knot in 1991. Although Saif got married at the peak of his career, Amrita had reportedly ensured that the actor continues with his good work and doesn’t get bogged down by anything.\n\nIn a throwback interview with a magazine, Amrita had once revealed that she did not wanted to have kids for quite a few years after their marriage because she didn’t want to tie him down. The actress also added that Saif should concentrate on his acting instead of worrying about a family.\n\nElaborating further about Saif, Amrita had stated that unlike what was said and written about Saif, he was not irresponsible. According to her, no one really understood him in Bombay. She added that Saif doesn’t get worked up over anything which probably was the western influence on him. However, his producers misunderstood his laidback style for disinterest.\n\nToday, while Amrita has not remarried, Saif is happily married to Kareena Kapoor Khan. The actor also has two sons with Bebo – Taimur and Jehangir Ali Khan."
