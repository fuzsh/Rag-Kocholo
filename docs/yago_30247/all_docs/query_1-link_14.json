        "meta_description": "Saif Ali Khan recently appeared on ‘Koffee with Karan’ along with his mother Sharmila Tagore and the duo talked about the former’s divorce with Amrita Singh. The actor reportedly said, ‘With the separation, I just like to say, that the first person I spoke to before the separation was my mother. She took a deep breath, there was a pause on the phone, and said, “I am with you if that’s what you want” and that helped a lot.’ Sharmila further added, ‘When you are together for such a long time and you have such lovely children, then no break up is easy. Then it is not a harmonious… I know it is difficult to have harmony at that stage, everybody is hurt… so that stage was not nice but I tried. But that’s water under the bridge, she needed time to cool down and they worked it out together.’ Further talking about how the entire family had to adjust to the change, the ‘Kashmir Ki Kali’ actress said ‘It’s not just staying away, there are so many other things that are involved. It wasn’t a happy time for us because Ibrahim was just three and we were very fond of the children. Especially, Tiger was really fond of Ibrahim and he would say, ‘That’s a good lad.’ He didn’t get that time with him. So we felt doubly deprived to lose Amrita and lose the two kids. So it’s just not him but we also had to adjust to all that.’ Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh were married from 1991 to 2004 and are parents to Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan.",
