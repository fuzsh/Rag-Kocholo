        "text": "Saif Ali Khan has been one actor who has always been honest in his interviews. He says it like it is but is always polite while doing so as well. Recently during an interview with Mid-Day, he credited his ex-wife for asking him to take his career seriously.\n\nTalking about the same, he said:\n\nI also ran away from home and got married at 20. And I’ve to give Amrita, my ex-wife, credit for being the only person who taught me to take it all seriously. She said you can’t hit the target while laughing at it. That’s when Parampara happened.\n\nThe actor also disclosed as to how clueless he was when he was approached for Dil Chahta Hai and it was Amrita Singh who told him to believe in himself. He said he was asking for advice from everybody including Aamir on how to play Sameer but it was Amrita who questioned him about this and asked him to do his own thing.\n\nThe rest as you know is history. Sameer is one of the most loved characters in Bollywood movies even today.\n\nSaif and Amrita tied the knot in 1991 and had two kids, Sara and Ibrahim Ali Khan. While the couple had a messy divorce in 2004, they became friends over time. Saif got married to Kareena Kapoor in 2012 and the couple has a son Taimur Ali Khan.\n\nSaif had also revealed that he had written a note to Amrita on the day of his wedding to Kareena and how Sara was extremely happy about that.\n\nThey truly are the modern family, don’t you think? We absolutely love how Saif and Amrita have worked through their differences to co-parent two beautiful children Sara and Ibrahim. And we all know that Sara is really good friends with Kareena."
