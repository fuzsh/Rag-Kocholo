She was married to actor Saif Ali Khan from 1991 to 2004, with whom she had two children, including actress Sara Ali Khan.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAmrita Singh was born in 1961 [1] to Rukhsana Sultana[2] and an army officer Shivinder Singh Virk.[3][4] Her mother was a political associate of Sanjay Gandhi during the Indian Emergency in the 1970s, who became known for leading Sanjay Gandhi's sterilisation campaign in Muslim areas of Old Delhi.[5][6][7][8][9] Through her paternal grandmother Mohinder Kaur, Amrita is the great-granddaughter of Sobha Singh, one of the builders of New Delhi, the grandniece of the late novelist Khushwant Singh, and great-grandniece of politician Ujjal Singh. The actress Begum Para is her great-aunt and her husband was Nasir Khan, who is the brother of Dilip Kumar. Actor Ayub Khan is her uncle (second cousin once removed).[2] Singh was a childhood friend of Shah Rukh Khan. Their mothers often worked together in the Old Delhi area and Singh attended the same school as Khan's sister, Shahnaz.[10]\n\nSingh attended Modern School in New Delhi and is fluent in English, Punjabi and Hindi.[11]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\n1983–1993\n\n[edit]\n\nSingh made her Hindi cinema debut in 1983 with Betaab, a highly successful romantic drama in which she was paired with Sunny Deol. This was quickly followed by a succession of hits, such as Sunny (1984), Mard (which was the biggest hit of 1985) and Saaheb (also 1985), Chameli Ki Shaadi and Naam (both 1986), Khudgarz (1987), and Waaris (1988). Singh made a successful pair in several films, not only with Sunny Deol, Sanjay Dutt, and Raj Babbar, but also with Jeetendra, Vinod Khanna, Anil Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan, some of the leading actors of the 1980s.[12] As well as playing leading roles, she also played supporting negative roles in films such as Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992), Suryavanshi (1992) and Aaina (1993), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for the lattermost.[citation needed] Her comic timings in films such as Saaheb and Chameli Ki Shaadi are still remembered. She decided to retire into family life and quit acting after her appearance in Rang (1993).\n\n2002–present\n\n[edit]\n\nSingh returned to acting in 2002 with 23rd March 1931: Shaheed, in which she played the mother of Bhagat Singh (played by Bobby Deol). She joined the television industry with Ekta Kapoor's family drama Kavyanjali, which aired on StarPlus in 2005. In the show, Singh was seen in a negative role that soon gained immense popularity.[13] Later that year, she received critical acclaim for her performance in yet another negative role for the film Kalyug, which earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role. In 2007, Singh played the role of gangster Maya Dolas' mother, Ratnaprabha Dolas, in the Sanjay Gupta film Shootout at Lokhandwala, directed by Apoorva Lakhia. Vivek Oberoi played the role of Maya Dolas. Later on, she appeared in the anthology film Dus Kahaniyaan, where she appeared in the short story Poornmasi.\n\nContinuing her acting journey, Singh was seen in Kajraare (2010), and also appeared in Aurangzeb (2012) under the Yash Raj Films banner, where she was paired with Jackie Shroff after almost two decades, after having paired together in Aaina.[14] In 2014, she was seen in 2 States, produced by Dharma Productions, portraying the role of co-actor Arjun Kapoor's mother. The film was released on 18 April 2014, and was a critical and commercial success, and also earned Singh a second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[15] In 2016, she appeared in Flying Jat playing Tiger Shroff's mother. In 2017, she appeared in the comedy-drama Hindi Medium as a school principal. In 2019, she appeared in Sujoy Ghosh's psychological mystery thriller Badla, reuniting with Amitabh Bachchan after 18 years. Badla and Singh's performance received widespread critical acclaim upon release. The film proved to be a commercial success, and Singh's performance earned her a third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.[16]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nSingh married her cousin (mother's side) actor Saif Ali Khan in January 1991. Singh, who was raised as a Sikh, converted to Islam before marriage and the couple had an Islamic wedding.[17] 6 years younger,[1] Khan is the son of former Indian test cricket captain Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, the ninth Nawab of Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore and is a member of the royal family of the erstwhile Bhopal State and Pataudi State. Despite controversies, they remained married.[18] She gave up acting after her marriage to Khan. After thirteen years of marriage, the couple divorced in 2004.[19] Their daughter Sara Ali Khan Pataudi was born on 12 August 1993, and son Ibrahim Ali Khan Pataudi on 5 March 2001.[20]\n\nReception and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nSingh is regarded as one of the most popular and leading actress of 80s.[21] Her debut film Betaab made her an overnight sensation. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com noted, \"Amrita Singh is a heroine who breathed fire and shushed up anyone who dared disagree with her flare-ups and fury.\"[22] Lakshana N Palat of Indian Express said that her career, comprised \"a strong filmography\" and noted, \"With her narrowed eyes, and reverberating voice, Amrita created a new leading heroine. She has made a mark in every role that she has played — a 90’s vamp, a heroine, a mother, she has done it all.\"[23] Ritika Nath of PTC Punjabi said, \"From 1983 to 1993, Amrita Singh had the reigning ten years in the industry.\"[24]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1983 Betaab Roma (Dingy) 1984 Sunny Amrita Duniya Roma Verma 1985 Saaheb Natasha 'Nikki' Mard Ruby 1986 Mera Dharam Durga Thakur Chameli Ki Shaadi Chameli Kala Dhanda Goray Log Ramola/ Pooja Karamdaata Pinky Naam Rita 1987 Naam O Nishan Vanisha Khudgarz Mrs. Sinha Thikana Shaila 1988 Mulzim Mala Kabzaa Rita Tamacha Maria Shukriyaa Neema Waaris Shibo Charnon Ki Saugandh Kanchan Singh Agnee Tara 1989 Sachai Ki Taqat Mrs. Ram Singh Hathyar Suman Galiyon Ka Badshah Cameo Ilaaka Sub-Inspector Neha Singh Batwara Roopa Toofan Pickpocketer Jaadugar Mona 1990 Veeru Dada Meena Karishma Kali Kaa Parvati Maut Ke Farishtey Aag Ka Dariya Kroadh Matki CID Meghna Saxena 1991 Sadhu Sant Meena Kapoor Paap Ki Aandhi Reshma Dharam Sankat Madhu Akayla Sapna Rupaye Dus Karod Aarthi Saxena Pyaar Ka Saaya Maya Gangadhami 1992 Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman Sapna Chhabria Suryavanshi Princess Suryalekha Kal Ki Awaaz Principal Nahim Bilgrami Dil Aashna Hai Raj 1993 Aaina Roma Mathur Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress Rang Indu 2002 23rd March 1931: Shaheed Vidya 2005 Kalyug Simi Roy Nominated – Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role[citation needed] 2007 Shootout at Lokhandwala Mom (Aai) Dus Kahaniyaan Mala Segment: Pooranmasi 2010 Kajraare Zohra Baano 2013 Aurangzeb Neena Wadhwa 2014 2 States Kavita Malhotra Nominated – Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress[citation needed] 2016 A Flying Jatt Mrs. Dhillon 2017 Hindi Medium Principal Lodha 2019 Badla Rani Kaur Nominated – Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress[citation needed] 2022 Heropanti 2 Hema\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Platform Notes 2005–2006 Kkavyanjali Nitya Nanda StarPlus Won the Indian Telly Award for Best Actress in a Negative Role (Jury)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Nominated work Category Result Filmfare Awards 1994 Aaina Best Supporting Actress Won 2006 Kalyug Best Performance in a Negative Role Nominated 2015 2 States Best Supporting Actress Nominated 2020 Badla Nominated IIFA Awards 2006 Kalyug Best Performance in a Negative Role Nominated 2015 2 States Best Supporting Actress Nominated 2021 Badla Nominated Indian Telly Awards 2005 Kkavyanjali Best Actress in a Negative Role (Popular) Nominated Best Actress in a Negative Role (Jury) Won Producers Guild Film Awards 2015 2 States Best Actress in a Supporting Role Nominated Screen Awards 2019 Badla Best Supporting Actress Nominated Zee Cine Awards 2003 23rd March 1931: Shaheed Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female Nominated 2006 Kalyug Best Performance in a Negative Role Nominated 2020 Badla Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female Nominated\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
