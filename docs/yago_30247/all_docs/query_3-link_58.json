        "text": "Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh might have had an ugly divorce in 2004, but when it came to crediting one person for his success and for having goaded him to take his work seriously, the actor said it was his ex-wife.\n\nSaif and Amrita Singh got married in 1991. Things got better between them over time and now, they have come to share a cordial relationship.\n\nThe ex-couple has two children -- Ibrahim and Sara Ali Khan.\n\n“I ran away from home, and got married at 20. And I’ve to give Amrita [Singh], my ex-wife, credit for being the only person who taught me to take it all [work/show-business] seriously. She said you can’t hit the target while laughing at it. That’s when Parampara happened,” Saif was quoted as saying to Mid-Day.\n\nSaif also revealed that he was confused about playing the character of Sameer in 'Dil Chahta Hai'. He said that he was not able to understand how he should do it and asked for advice from everyone. He recalls that Aamir also gave him some advice, but Amrita asked him why he was asking everyone else. She told him to do his own thing.\n\nToday, Sameer is one of the most loved characters of Saif.\n\nLater when in 2012, the actor decided to marry Kareena Kapoor, he wrote a letter to Amrita first.\n\n\"When I was getting married to Kareena, for some reason, I wrote a note to Amrita saying this is a new chapter starting. I wrote we had a history and something on the lines of good wishes for both of us. I sent it to Kareena to take a look. I sent it across. Sara called me and said, ‘I was coming anyway but now, I am coming with a happy heart even more.’ I think that story sums up the attitude of everyone involved [in the wedding],\" Saif had said, when he appeared on Koffee With Karan Season 6 with daughter Sara.\n\nMore Bollywood stories and picture galleries"
