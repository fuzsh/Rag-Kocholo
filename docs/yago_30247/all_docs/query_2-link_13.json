        "text": "One of the most established actresses of the 80s and 90s, Amrita Singh has lived her life on her own terms. Born in February 1958 in Delhi, Amrita is related to some big personalities from the glamour and political world. Her father was an army officer, and her mother was a political associate of Sanjay Gandhi. She is the grandniece of the late author, Khushwant Singh and the great-grandniece of politician, Ujjal Singh.\n\nNot many people know that the veteran actress, Begum Para is her great-aunt and her actor-husband, Nasir Khan, which makes her related to Dilip Kumar. Amrita made her acting debut in Hindi cinema with the 1983 film, Betaab, which was followed by films like Mard, Saaheb, Chameli Ki Shaadi, Naam, Khudgarz, Waaris, and many more.\n\nAlso Read: Jagjit Singh And Chitra's Painful Love Story: From Children's Tragic Deaths To Losing Her Voice\n\nApart from her successful professional front, Amrita has garnered a lot of limelight for her alleged relationships. She had dated some popular celebs, which never culminated in a happy ending. The actress has often been vocal about her tumultuous relationships. Let us look at the men who came into Amrita’s life and her failed relationships with them.\n\nAmrita Singh’s fling with Sunny Deol\n\nIt was in 1983 when Amrita Singh and Sunny Deol made their Bollywood debut with the film, Betaab. Sunny and Amrita's debut film, Betaab, not only gave them a platform to accomplish their dreams of becoming actors, the stardom they had desired but also their first fling. People loved their on-screen chemistry, but their off-screen camaraderie also created a lot of buzz among the masses.\n\nWhile Sunny and Amrita’s romance was brewing off-screen, she came to know about his wife, Pooja Deol. It is also reported that Sunny was already a married man before he entered into the industry and because of his family's advice, he had kept his marriage with Pooja hidden from the world.\n\nWhen the news about Sunny’s marriage broke out, Amrita distanced herself from him, and they never made an appearance together. Also, Amrita's mother, Rukhsana Sultana objected to her daughter's relationship with a married man. On the other hand, Sunny’s mother, Prakash Kaur was against this relationship due to the same reasons.\n\nAmrita Singh’s alleged engagement with cricketer, Ravi Shastri\n\nWe have often seen actresses getting hitched to cricketers. Ravi Shastri and Amrita Singh’s relationship in the 80s was one such steamy affair. When the Indian cricketer, Ravi Shastri met the Bollywood beauty, Amrita, he was simply bowled by her beauty.\n\nRecommended Read: Esha Deol-Bharat Takhtani's Love Story: From High School Lovers, Lavish Wedding To Amicable Divorce\n\nThey even posed for the cover of Cine Blitz magazine in their November 1986 edition, which further steamed stories of their rumoured affair. It was also reported that the lovebirds even got engaged, and the two were set to tie the knot. However, destiny had other plans, as Ravi didn’t want Amrita to work after their wedding. He was even quoted as saying:\n\n“I definitely don't want an actress wife. I am chauvinistic. Her home should be her first priority.\"\n\nAmrita, who was rising high on her professional front during that time was not ready to give up her career for the sake of her marriage. Amrita was shocked and hurt by Ravi’s public announcement, and she decided not just to break up with him but to retaliate. In one of her interviews, the actress said:\n\n“At the moment I'm too involved in my career to give it up. But I'm sure after a couple of years, I will be ready to become a full-time wife and mother.\"\n\nAmrita Singh and Vinod Khanna’s passionate love\n\nAmrita Singh met Vinod Khanna for the first time on the sets of their film, Batwara and the actress was mesmerised by Vinod’s charming personality. Although Amrita was already in a relationship with Ravi Shastri, she once told the cricketer to watch out, to which he replied that Vinod was out of her league and she would never be able to make him fall in love with her.\n\nVinod never paid heed to Amrita throughout the shooting of Batwara, but when the two met for another film, his behaviour towards her was slightly changed. Soon, Amrita and Vinod fell in love with each other and decided to get married. Vinod was already married to Geetanjali, however, they had parted ways before he fell for Amrita.\n\nAlso Read: When Lata Mangeshkar Talked About Being Slow Poisoned By Her Servant, 'One Day I Woke Up Feeling...'\n\nEverything was going great in Vinod and Amrita’s paradise when their dreams of marriage were shattered by her mother, Rukhsana Sultan. The major reason why the actress’ mother was against their marriage was because of the 12-year gap between the two. Another reason quoted by her was Vinod’s previous marriage. As a result, the couple had to end their relationship.\n\nWhen Amrita Singh talked about her failed relationships\n\nIn one of her old interviews, Amrita Singh confessed to dating Sunny Deol, Ravi Shastri and Vinod Khanna. Talking about how she felt after her failed relationships with them, the actress stated:\n\n“Every time I’ve been involved in a relationship, whether it was with SUNNY or RAVI or VINOD, I gave in hundred percent. And when it ends, I feel that I have cut out an eternal piece of my body. Even two dogs, stray dogs, get attached to each other if they live on the same road. We’re human beings, yaar. It kills me when I have to part.”\n\nIn the same interview, she also revealed how each of her ex-boyfriends held a special place in her life even after their break up. Elaborating on the same, Amrita shared:\n\n“All my past relationships still mean a lot to me. I feel for SUNNY. I’m absolutely normal with him. I feel happy if RAVI does well at his game. I still care like crazy for VINOD because we had some super times together. But I don’t mope and mourn because there’s no point in walking backward.”\n\nAmrita Singh's marriage and divorce with Saif Ali Khan\n\nAmrita Singh met the chote Nawab of Pataudi, Saif Ali Khan on the sets of Rahul Rawail’s film, Bekhudi. Saif was smitten by Amrita Singh and decided to ask her out for dinner, and soon the couple got into a relationship with each other. They were completely opposite to each other as Amrita was already a star, and Saif was struggling to make his mark in Bollywood.\n\nNot only this, there was a huge age gap between Amrita and Saif, as he was 12 years younger than her. Despite all the odds, the duo got married in 1991. Amrita, who was raised as a Sikh had converted to Islam before marriage and had an Islamic wedding. She was 33 when she got married to 21-year-old Saif.\n\nIn 1995, Saif and Amrita had hopped on to parenthood for the first time and had welcomed a baby girl, whom they have named, Sara Ali Khan. In 2001, they became parents for the second time with the arrival of their baby boy, Ibrahim Ali Khan. Unfortunately, after 13 years of marital bliss, in 2004, Saif and Amrita decided to part ways.\n\nThere were many rumours pertaining to Saif and Amrita’s divorce. Many attribute Saif Ali Khan’s affairs and falling “out of love” with Amrita as the reasons behind their separation. But in a throwback interview in 2005, Saif had rubbished the reports and stated that it was Amrita’s changed behaviour with him and his family that had soured their relationship. Saif Ali Khan also paid a heavy alimony of Rs. 5 crores to his ex-wife, Amrita Singh. After her separation from Saif Ali Khan, Amrita Singh was seen in many Hindi films in supporting roles. Some of the films where the actress made her presence felt were Kalyug, Shootout at Lokhandwala, Aurangzeb, 2 States, Hindi Medium, Badla, Heropanti 2 and many more.\n\nAmrita is now leading a peaceful life with her children, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. Sara is one of the leading actresses in Bollywood, and Ibrahim will soon make his debut in Bollywood.\n\nRecommended Read: Vijayta Pandit's Tragic Life: Failed Career, Unfulfilled Love, Financial Crises Post Husband's Death\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
