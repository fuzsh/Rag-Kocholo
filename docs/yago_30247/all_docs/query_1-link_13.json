I've gone through all of it.\"\n\nOriginally posted by: DeliciousDevil.\n\nHe has money to buy flat for Babita. Back then, he may not have access to assets and nor was he a hard earring actor. Just like now, his movies flop badly and he still has money to shower his mother in law.\n\nIt's more like I wanted to give or not? It's depend on me."
