        "text": "Throwback Tuesday: Read Saif Ali Khan's EXPLOSIVE interview on his ex wfie Amrita Singh and kids Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim\n\nSaif Ali Khan today is in a very happy space. He has married his dream woman Kareena Kapoor Khan and also has a baby boy Taimur Ali Khan with her. In addition to this, he has two grown up children Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan one of whom will make their Bollywood debut soon! His equation with his ex-wife Amrita Singh has also improved and his bitter divorce has become a thing of the past. Now, though all’s well that ends well, Saif Ali Khan’s throwback interview with regard to his divorce and the hefty alimony which he was ‘forced’ to pay for his kids is going viral. We are plain shocked with the brutally honest revelations that the Rangoon star had made back then!\n\nTalking about the alimony, he had even compared himself to Shah Rukh Khan and told Telegraph that he has to slog away in order to meet his ex-wife’s expectations and despite that, Sara and Ibrahim are not allowed to meet him. Well though now Sara and Ibrahim are really close to Saif and Kareena, this was not the case back then as Amrita did not approve of Saif’s then girlfriend Rosa Catalano. Saif had revealed, “My wife and I have gone our separate ways. I respect my wife’s space. But why am I being constantly reminded of how terrible a husband I was, and how awful a father I am. I’ve my son Ibrahim’s photograph in my wallet. Each time I look at it, I feel like crying. I miss my daughter Sara all the time.” He also said that he is not allowed to meet his kids because he was with a new woman. In his words, “Because there’s a new woman in my life who’d influence my children against their mother. That’s so much hogwash and Amrita knows it.”ALSO READ: Radhika Apte to romance Saif Ali Khan in Baazaar?\n\nHe also dished out details of the alimony he was supposed to pay. He said, “I’m supposed to give Amrita Rs 5 crore, of which I’ve already given her approximately Rs 2.5 crore. Also, I’m paying Rs 1 lakh per month until my son becomes 18,” he said. He further said, “I’m not Shah Rukh Khan. I don’t have that kind of money. I’ve promised her I’ll pay up the rest of the money, and I will, even if I’ve to slog till I drop dead. Whatever I’ve earned from doing ads, stage shows, and films is being given for my children. I’ve no money. Our bungalow is for Amrita and the kids, and never mind the relatives who’ve joined her after my departure.”\n\nHe also hurled some nasty accusations against his ex wife and said, “It isn’t nice to be constantly reminded of how worthless you are and to have taunts, jeers, insults and abuses thrown at your mother and sister all the time. I’ve gone through all of it. Now I feel healed again.” He then added, “Please don’t kill me with a feeling of constant guilt just because I’ve had the courage to finally walk away from an impossible relationship to find some solace. I want no confrontation with Amrita. She was and will remain, an integral part of my life. I want her and my kids to be happy.”\n\nReading this interview, one wants to believe in the age old adage – Time Heals Everything."
