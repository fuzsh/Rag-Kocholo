You will not only hear significant voices from the film industry and learn from them, but will be coached by Chris on your mindset and limiting beliefs (implemented in surprising ways!) so that by the time you’re through the 4 days, you will know that nothing is impossible for you and that you are capable of more than you dared to think. And because you will now have a tribe of people in your life who get it and 100% support you, any time you start to falter, they will be there to remind you of what you’re capable of and that you CAN do the things you’re afraid to do. You will get far more than you expected from this program. For me, it will remain one of the highlights of my entire life and I cannot praise Chris and the LSF team highly enough for how much of themselves they give and how much they are willing to invest in other writers and filmmakers.’\n\nMonique Amado, Screenwriter\n\nThe Talent Campus exclusive sessions have also been absolutely incredible – John Yorke, Kate Leys, Lucy Hay, Chris Jones, Julian Friedman, Pilar Alessandra – all giving us their insights and advice on our individual projects. Plus special sessions with Chris McQuarrie and Carl Gottlieb. I’m not aware of a screenwriting course where you can get that kind of intensive input from such an experienced bunch of people, who are currently active and working in the business.\n\nRachel Paterson\n\nI’ve made massive progress with my story thanks to the highly supportive personnel and framework of TC both collectively and also within our smaller group. When I complete my first draft I reckon it’ll be in the region of 12 weeks quicker than had I been writing it independently of the program. The calibre of industry professionals I’ve had access to is quite simply incredible.\n\nMark MacNicol\n\nThe highlights have been being taken seriously and getting script requests though Pitchfest, and developing a supportive, inspiring peer group.\n\nPoz Watson\n\nReally great course with lots of knowledge learnt and experience gained. The mentoring outside of the Talent campus sessions has been the most rewarding, and its great to have a mentor as well as be in a smaller group of writers to chat to and get feedback from about our specific projects.\n\nGary Thomas\n\nI have gone from writing alone, to writing with the strong support of a peer group of fellow writers. From using only my own judgment, to now working with professional script editors and producers who are assessing the quality of my work and helping me decide which projects to pursue in terms of their place in the market.\n\nDavid Hitchcox\n\nI’m learning and developing so much. It’s been especially valuable in helping me develop my networking and pitching skills. I really enjoyed meeting execs and pitching and felt so much more relaxed than I’d ever imagined I would. I feel more confident in networking and pitching situations and I’m looking forward to more.\n\nNick Fogg\n\nAlthough I was certain that Talent Campus was going to be brilliant, I wasn’t at all sure it was going to develop me where I most needed help – networking and pitching. To my delight, those have been two core areas of focus of the course so far and I feel that I have made a great leap in both my networking and my pitching in such a short time period. This resulted in a much-needed boost in my confidence.\n\nKT Parker\n\nI am sure I will continue to feel the positive effects and profit from the relationships and contacts made long after this inspiring program has ended.\n\nHalida Abbaro\n\nI have learned heaps professionally: all the varied training sessions were in-depth and expertly delivered. Being mentored by a working producer has been invaluable. The support our group has given each other (and not least, were given by the organisers) has made the whole experience a pure joy.\n\nKristina Day\n\nThe very best thing that I have gotten out of the Talent Campus so far is the opportunity to really get to know several of the other Campers, especially the ones in my mentor group. My mentor, Karol, has been phenomenal! I see us keeping a relationship going for years to come. Our group has grown pretty tight and I hope that we maintain our connection and collaborative energy long after the close.\n\nAmy Amani\n\nIt was a wonderfully, enriching experience where I have further developed my knowledge of the craft, but also I have made twenty-odd new friends who I’m confident will remain friends for life now.\n\nSarah Cassidy\n\nThe Talent Campus has pushed me further, faster, than almost any other experience I’ve had in my screenwriting career to date. So as a way to fast track a career, I have to say this is unparalleled.\n\nLiz Holiday\n\nAnd finally Dee Chilton…\n\nIt has been a shot in the arm of creative energy, giving me more confidence in my abilities and understanding. It has taken me to a higher level and reinvigorated me as both a writer and as a human being. It has challenged me to set the bar higher for myself and be even better. It has released more of the authentic me to come out to play, helped me to let go my feelings of inferiority and improved my self-belief no end.\n\nIt has driven home the fact that, as well as striving for excellence in our writing, interaction with the right people is crucial to our own development. It is a unique and invaluable opportunity and I am honoured and to have been selected to take part along with my fellow talented creatives. I know for sure it will pay massive dividends for us all in the future.\n\nMy ambition now is to replay the faith shown in me by Team LSF, by taking everything I have learned and putting it to best use to make progress in the industry. It would be a massive disappointment to me if Talent Campus was not funded in 2016 and beyond, allowing other talented emerging writers the same opportunity.\n\nDee Chilton\n\nFinal note… Every Talent Campus is different, and we have rebuilt it from the ground up for 2020\n\nHaving run Talent Campus six times now, we are rebuilding it with all that knowledge behind us. The main difference is that we have focused more energy into the ignition phase, the first five days. These five days are unquestionably the most transformational stage of the program with delegates experiencing both life and career changing breakthroughs that impact ALL areas of their personal and professional lives moving forward. Also. the second half no longer takes place at the Screenwriters’ festival, so we focus on greater intimacy and individual support.\n\nGet Your Ticket for JUST LondonSWF below"
