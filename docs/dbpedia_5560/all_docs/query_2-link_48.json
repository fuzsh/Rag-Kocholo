        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nWhenever I am asked what my favorite movies are and I name this one, I often feel I have been quizzed about my essential character, and found wanting. I could be a liar, or a snob, and cite a lot of European classics as my favorites, but the fact is that while I have seen a number of great or otherwise good French, Swedish, Italian, German, Japanese and even Czechoslovakian pictures* I don’t enjoy watching movies with subtitles, even on a big theater screen; the distraction of reading dialogue overwhelms my ability to enjoy the images, the rhythms of the movie and the actor’s performances in it, and I never have the sense with subtitles that I have absorbed the picture fully the way I do when I see something in English. Not that I am in favor of dubbing. Who, knowing the inimitable (or imitable) original, would want to see a John Wayne or Humphrey Bogart picture with someone else’s voice on the soundtrack? I couldn’t get through the Visconti The Leopard because the voice I was hearing wasn’t Burt Lancaster’s, one of the most recognizable in the world. I am also, unlike Woody Allen and John Simon (who probably never agreed on anything else), un-persuaded as to the genius of Ingmar Bergman, find Fellini’s excesses a trial and cannot adjust my sense of the ridiculous enough to take Japanese acting seriously. And anyway I hate symbols, which the “serious” filmmakers in Europe apparently discovered sometime around 1945 and would not let go of for years afterward.\n\nMy favorite movies are not those by which I hope to impress others with the depths of my discernment and intellectual pretention, but the motion pictures that give me the greatest pleasure to watch — and by “pleasure” I do not necessarily mean happiness. Somehow we have come to conflate entertainment, which can be anything from seeing a 3 Stooges short to reading Thomas Pynchon, with pure escapism. Yet few American movies are more pleasurable or more entertaining as viewing experiences than The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, and neither could remotely be considered escapist. I mean pleasure in the sense of a complete experience, one that satisfies the senses and enriches the soul, even if that enrichment takes the form of well-executed thrills or gut-busting laughter. What is artistically successful does not have to be what one thinks of as High Art; there is more merit in seven-and-a-half minutes of a good Bugs Bunny cartoon than in the entirety of Jackson Pollack. That the titles on my personal list of favorites tend also to be those that were at least nominally popular when they were released speaks not to my taste or acumen alone, but to the collective intelligence of the movie audience of the past. (Although the 1940 Pinocchio, my favorite animated picture, was a disappointment on its release and has never performed as well as the lighter, more comforting Disney features. People who are made uneasy by the movie ought to sit down and read the Collodi original some day.) I never say, and have never said, or written, things like, “Such-and-such is the greatest movie ever made.” What an absurd statement, and a prototypically Western one. Who decides these things? A movie may be the greatest you have ever seen, but that hardly confers an official imprimatur of greatness on it. I couldn’t tell you what I consider the greatest movie I’ve ever seen is. I can only say which are my favorites, and why, and the one thing I am absolutely sure of is that no movie has a lock on the definite article.\n\nI stopped going to new movies generally, an activity that for years ranked as one of the great and necessary pleasures in life, around the turn of the century and have seen very few since because I got tired of being condescended to and having my intelligence assaulted nearly every time I went to a new release. 1996 was a real bellwether, suggesting just how bad things were becoming: That summer, the three biggest studio blockbusters were Twister, Mission: Impossible and Independence Day, each picture proving more stupid, illogical and insulting than the one before it. It was with a relief bordering on incredulity that summer that I went to a local theater with a friend who had also suffered through those three pieces of steaming offal to see an independent movie, shot largely on the N.C. State University campus in Raleigh. In contrast to the Hollywood pictures of the time which routinely cost $80 – $90 million, The Delicate Art of the Rifle (Screenwriter: Stephen Grant, Director: D.W. Harper), made for $110,00, treated us like adults. It presumed we had brains and could use them, that we might wish to see a well-acted (the appalling John Kessel excepted), intelligently written and directed movie about human beings in conflict with themselves and each other in a story with relevance to the lives of its audience rather than yet another special-effects extravaganza more about explosions and CGI than people. That we could draw for ourselves the parallels with Charles Whitman’s 1966 University of Texas murder-spree (the same figure who inspired a previous independent feature, Peter Bogdanovich’s remarkable debut as a writer-director, the 1968 Targets) and make the requisite moral judgments without being preached at.\n\nAs I gradually realized, in the years that followed, that the only time I was being fully entertained at the movies was on those occasions when I attended an old picture in reissue or at a special screening, I knew it was time to give up hoping not only that I would not be disappointed by the next new American movie, but that I would not also be enraged by it. (What Lies Beneath, anyone?) So if you are a part of the popular audience that is encouraging the makers of Barbie, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the unnecessary live-action Little Mermaid or Ant-Man and the Wasp to cobble up more garbage, congratulations. You prove my point for me. Audiences across America have become as indifferent, if not downright hostile, to movies about human beings as they are toward any picture exhibiting a degree of wit, taste or intelligence. It astounds me when I reflect that, once upon a not-so-distant time, items like The Apartment, Lawrence of Arabia, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Manchurian Candidate, A Man for All Seasons, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, In the Heat of the Night, Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, Midnight Cowboy, The Last Picture Show, Klute, Sounder, Cabaret and The Godfather were not only released on a regular basis, and well-regarded critically, they were also popular at the box office.\n\nWe are collectively allergic to good movies now, so we no longer get them.\n\nThat statement is not the hyperbole it may seem: The ability to write, and direct (and produce) great movies about human beings has to be learned, and once learned, nurtured, or like any muscle not exercised, it atrophies. And I’m afraid this movie, which I love, is part of the reason why it happened that writers and filmmakers lost the knack for it. Or rather, its genuinely phenomenal success, which helped usher in the era we are currently living through. The mega-million dollar success of Jaws, and Star Wars, told the suits, “Screw stories about people. Give ’em thrills and special effects, and make every new movie a lot like some other movie they liked. Better yet: Make sequels! Just re-make the damn things and put in a few differences so the rubes won’t notice how we’re bilking them.” And yet, curiously enough, Jaws is about people, although that was almost by-the-by. Because the mechanical shark was so unreliable, the narrative shifted from “let’s-see-the-Great-White-bite-people-in-half” to “Let’s not see the Great White, and focus on how the characters behave around this thing no one can see.” Relationships in Jaws are why it’s such an effective thriller: Between the Amity Island Police Chief Martin Brody and his wife Ellen, between the Brodies and their children, between Brody and the mayor, between Brody and the people he is pledged to serve and protect, between Brody and the oceanographer Matt Hooper, between Hooper and the shark-hunter Quint, and between Brody and Quint. If the picture had been made today instead of nearly 50 years ago, the shark would be a CGI effect, the characters cardboard archetypes and there would be none of those tasty moments between people, just a lot of gore and sour wisecracks. It’s not just that the established names found their craft altered but that those who followed, the younger generations of movie writers and directors, never learned. They got used to the debased quality of the pictures on offer, and emulate it. In another 20 years their successors will have figured out how to eliminate human characters from movies entirely.\n\nIn 1975, the year Jaws was released, among the highest-grossing movies of the year (including bleed-overs from the winter of 1974) were The Godfather Part II, Murder on the Orient Express, Young Frankenstein, Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Shampoo and The Return of the Pink Panther, with Love and Death, Three Days of the Condor and Dog Day Afternoon to follow in the autumn. Not perhaps, with the exceptions of Godfather II, Dog Day and the flawed Alice, the greatest aggregation of human dramas, although the comic Shampoo is more fully human than anything on offer at the googolplexes of America in the 21st century. The film year as a whole, while not as high a period for movies as 1971-1972, included Galileo (part of the second and final American Film Theater subscription series), Report to the Commissioner, Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris (AFT), At Long Last Love (much better than its reputation would suggest), The Great Waldo Pepper, Lemmon and Bancroft in The Prisoner of Second Avenue, Rancho Deluxe, In Celebration (AFT), Tommy, The Yakuza, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Seven Beauties, the almost-great The Day of the Locust, End of the Game, The Man in the Glass Booth (AFT), the underrated French Connection II, The Wind and the Lion, Nashville, Night Moves, the criminally under-seen Richard Brooks Western Bite the Bullet, Cooley High, Rollerball, Smile, The Wilby Conspiracy, Mitchum as Philip Marlowe in Farewell My Lovely, Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Rocky Horror Picture Show (a flop until some genius started programming it as a late-show), 92 in the Shade, James Whitmore in Give ’em Hell Harry, the wonderful Hearts of the West, the very funny “Flashman” entry Royal Flash, Hester Street, Take a Hard Ride, Neil Simon’s The Sunshine Boys (which re-ignited George Burns’ career), the Harlan Ellison adaptation A Boy and His Dog, the overrated but dramatically effective One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Gene Wilder’s The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother, Barry Lyndon, John Huston’s splendid The Man Who Would Be King, the Bob Clampett-produced pre-1948 Looney Tunes compilation Bugs Bunny Superstar, The Killer Elite (Sam Peckinpaw out of Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant), Truffaut’s The Story of Adele H., the surprisingly entertaining Charles Bronson entry Breakheart Pass, the interesting misfire The Hindenburg and a reissue of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The quality of the list is highly variable, but when was the last time this century a run of movies in a single 12-month period was that good? Nashville alone would have made 1975 a movie year to remember.\n\nI am suggesting that Jaws was part of a popular film culture that was very healthy — far healthier than it has been since the early 1980s. The picture’s eventual financial success proved un-healthy, for personal filmmaking, but I don’t see how that can be retrospectively blamed on the people who made it. For the 14-year old moviegoer who was me, who had seen an advance poster for Jaws (and possibly that trailer so memorably narrated by Percy Rodrigues, although I no longer remember when I first saw it) and who picked up a copy of the bestselling Peter Benchley paperback in anticipation, the movie was the most nerve-wracking thing he’d seen to that time. It was also funny, cannily observed, superbly acted, wonderfully scored, beautifully made, and even at that age I knew it was almost infinitely superior to its poorly-written source. The book, a true pot-boiler if ever there was one, deflated me a bit; the movie exhilarated me. It sent me out on a high. When I see it again, it still does.\n\nPerhaps one reason eyebrows go up when I mention Jaws as a favorite movie, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind, is that both were directed by Steven Spielberg. Most of the intelligent, film-savvy people I have known as an adult loathe Spielberg, arguing against him as a manipulative, sentiment-wallowing schlockmeister, a judgment with which I largely agree. Indeed, I would also accuse him, latterly, as being either cynical or a political naif led into appalling historical revisionism on film by his best friend, the CIA asset Tom Hanks, who seems intent on re-writing recent American history to reflect the world-view of Allan Dulles. (Hanks’ official standing as Hollywood’s Mr. Nice Guy is, to use an espionage term he might appreciate, good cover.) I would add to Spielberg’s list of cinematic sins the establishment during the 1980s of a movie factory dedicated to recycling Baby-Boom TV Generation memories and the production of processed shit in attractive — and expensive — cans. (His friend and frequent collaborator George Lucas was even guiltier in this respect.) That of course concerns Spielberg’s crimes against aesthetics, minor indeed compared to his much greater crime of being at least partly responsible for the horrific deaths of Vic Morrow and two young Vietnamese children during the filming of The Twilight Zone in 1983 and for which both he and John Landis essentially got away with three staggeringly insensitive acts of manslaughter.† Landis caught the brunt of the press and public umbrage, but Little Stevie, who behaved self-servingly throughout the aftermath of the incident and Landis’ trial and who quickly severed his friendship and his professional relationship with his fellow director, somehow escaped being tarred.\n\nInasmuch as I generally hate the excuses made for popular artists to justify our ignoring the appalling things they do (“Yes, we know he raped a 13-year-old girl. But he made Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby!” Sotto voce: “Plus, you know, his wife was murdered…“) I would say that Spielberg’s work on Jaws (and Close Encounters) justifies itself. With the lone exception of the severed leg falling to the sandy floor of the estuary, which feels excessive to me, there’s scarcely a frame in Jaws I would eliminate, and the only regret I feel about its artistic (as opposed to its financial) success is that Great White Sharks were misunderstood for so long after the picture was released, and even that is as much Peter Benchley’s fault as Steven Spielberg’s; Benchley (the son of Nathaniel and grandson of Robert) rightly felt responsible for the shark slaughters that followed, although the terrible 1916 Jersey Shore attacks that partly inspired his book were certainly real enough. As illogical as the behavior of Benchley’s (and Spielberg’s) shark seems in Jaws, the actions of that 1916 Great White, and in fresh water, were nearly as implausible. Sharks, generally speaking, do not like the taste of humans. It’s why so many attacks are not fatal. They mistake us for their natural prey; they’re testing the meat and, finding it wanting after a bite or two, usually go away. That the shark in Jaws behaves with malevolence, that it deliberately goes after the men on the Orca, is where Spielberg and Benchley indulge in sheer fantasy. But by that time, we’re so caught up in the story we barely notice.\n\nEnough ink has been spilled, and more than enough video hours expended, on the filming of Jaws that I see little need to rehearse it here at any length. In brief: a) Steven Spielberg, who had made the impressive Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown production Sugarland Express, read the Benchley novel, which the producers had optioned and which he saw on Brown’s desk, and wanted to film it; b) Zanuck, who felt that Spielberg was a major young talent, wanted him to make his next picture for them, and gave Jaws to him; c) Benchley wrote the original draft screenplay which, unsatisfactory to just about everyone, was extensively revised by Spielberg; d) The playwright Howard Sackler (The Great White Hope) was engaged to revise Spielberg’s revision, eschewing screen credit; e) The improvisatory comic Carl Gottlieb, hired to play the Amity Island newspaper publisher in the picture was retained to revise everyone’s revisions on a day-to-day basis as the Martha’s Vineyard shoot grew longer (and his acting role became correspondingly smaller); f) Because the mechanical Great White did not function well in salt water, and proved underwhelming when it did, Spielberg & Co. worked around it, slowly realizing as Verna Fields began assembling their footage, that it was more effective the less the shark was seen; g) Thanks to the many delays occasioned by location weather and an unreliable shark, more time was spent by Spielberg and Gottlieb on the script and by the actors (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary, Murray Hamilton) in improvising their roles, expanding them beyond their slender outlines, enriching them and deepening and clarifying the characters’ relationships to each other. The shooting of Jaws was thus a confluence of events and delays no one foresaw and which placed the people involved in a unique position — they turned adversity to their advantage, and ended up with a richer, funnier “scare” movie than they could ever have imagined.\n\nWhile it’s certainly true that the then-recently-named “disaster movie,” thought to have begun with Universal’s Airport in 1970, was (at least for a time) an almost guaranteed cash-cow for the studios: Irwin Allen brought out The Poseidon Adventure in 1972 and The Towering Inferno in 1974, and Universal, along with Airport 1975 in October, had Earthquake in the theaters at the same time Inferno was tearing (burning?) up the box-office. For some ticket-buyers, Jaws was merely another entry in the cycle, and enjoyed on that level. For others it was a shock-picture — a horror movie in which the horror, as in Psycho, was natural instead of supernatural, and (as with Norman Bates) unrevealed until well into the action. For some it was a thriller, for others a pitch-black comedy. For many of us, I suspect, it was all of these at once, and that too was unique. Big popular movies in the 1970s were often genre pictures of one type or another: The disaster movie, the comedy (What’s Up, Doc?, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, The Return of the Pink Panther, The Pink Panther Strikes Again), the romance (Love Story, Summer of ’42, The Way We Were), the war movie (Patton) the Western (Rio Lobo, Big Jake) the buddy movie (Uptown Saturday Night, The Sting), the caper (Smokey and the Bandit), the crime thriller (The French Connection) and the horror picture (The Omen, The Excorcist, although its writer-producer would have called it a serious religious parable). Genre stayed in its genre; the lines were seldom blurred as Jaws blurred them, and I can think of no major studio release of the time that so effectively parodied, as Spielberg, Gottlieb and their actors do, the extremes of machismo. As Pauline Kael noted in her contemporary review:\n\n“When the three protagonists are in their tiny boat, trying to find the shark that has been devouring people, you feel that Robert Shaw, the malevolent old shark hunter, is so manly that he wants to get them all killed; he’s so manly he’s homicidal… The director, Steven Spielberg, sets up bare-chested heroism as a joke and scores off it all through the movie… the fool on board isn’t the chief of police, or the bookman, either. It’s Shaw, the obsessively masculine fisherman, who thinks he’s got to prove himself by fighting the shark practically single-handed. The high point of the film’s humor is in our seeing Shaw get it; this nut Ahab, with his hypermasculine basso-profundo speeches, stands in for all the men who have to show they’re tougher than anybody. The shark’s cavernous jaws demonstrate how little his toughness finally adds up to.”\n\nBoth Shaw as Quint and Dreyfuss as the ichthyologist Hooper are made fun of by the filmmakers; only Scheider’s island police chief Brody stands apart from the pair’s constant need for one-upsmanship. Hooper, young, rich and intellectual, is instantly threatened by Quint while the sharking boat Orca‘s skipper despises Hooper for his social and educational status. Brody alone is unaffected by these extremes; when Quint and Hooper compare bodily scars, there’s a moment where Martin lifts his shirt briefly, looks at his belly and then thinks better of it — and we suddenly like an already appealing character even more for his refusal to play silly, 8th-grade level macho games. (In the novel, Brody is the sole survivor of the trio, but that seems as much a matter of literary punishment as anything else since Benchley’s Hooper, unlike Dreyfuss conventionally WASP-blond and handsome, has it off with Mrs. Brody and the Chief suspects it. This lovemaking event is arguably the worst chapter in a very bad book. Of all the changes to the material made by the filmmakers, this was the omission that pleased and relieved me the most at 14.)\n\nWhere I disagree with Kael’s assessment above is in the matter of Quint’s death, about which I can find nothing remotely humorous unless you like your black-comedy so dark it spills over into snuff porn. There is irony in what happens to Quint, certainly, but not, for almost anyone other than Kael (and, perhaps, the psychopaths in the audience), humor. I strongly suspect it was Quint’s genuinely grisly death, and Shaw’s horrific screams of agony and terror, that led to the first line ever added to an MPAA ratings block for a specific movie: In addition to “Parental Guidance Suggested” and “Some Material May Not Be Suitable for Pre-Teenagers” was added, on an adjacent part of the poster advertising, the phrase “MAY BE TOO INTENSE FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.” Nine years later, the gruesome content of two Spielberg-associated pictures — Gremlins, which he produced and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, which he directed for Lucas — led to the first ratings addition since 1968 and the first rating change since GP became PG in 1972: The adoption of “PG-13.” So much for the cuddly, kid-friendly, latter-day Spielberg.\n\nThat Quint’s death is so disturbing, even to us Jaws fanatics, is due in large part to Shaw’s all too realistic screams but in larger part to the style of Spielberg’s direction — to the documentary realism with which he and Bill Butler, his extraordinary cinematographer, shot the picture. Most of the action in the movie is seen in this way, from opening to ending. Readers of these pages will know that I am the furthest thing from an adherent of la politique des auteurs, but along with the contributions of the actors, and Spielberg’s constant collaboration with Carl Gottlieb on the script, on and off the set, Jaws is pretty obviously a director’s picture, as Sugarland Express was and as the made-for-television Duel was, even given its taut Richard Matheson teleplay. The style in all three is nearly identical (although Sugarland is rather more stylized); they, and Close Encounters, bear Spielberg’s youthful stamp — his nearly unerring eye for the look of things. That documentarian style is one of the reasons Jaws packs such a wallop, as Duel did: The endless miles of desert macadam, the weathered look of the diners and gas stations and roadside attractions, gave the irrationally homicidal behavior of the unseen semi truck driver intent on killing Dennis Weaver a frame of numbing mundanity, and made him seem even more inexplicable, and scarier.\n\nBy concentrating on the minute details of daily life on a small island off the eastern coast and ticking off its prosaic concerns (karate class kids destroying a picket fence, a minor domestic injury, the new police chief trying to fit in as a transplanted off-islander) the filmmaker insures that the attacks by the shark — unseen, like the semi driver but, unlike him, not planned that way by screenwriters or director — make an even greater impact on the viewer. Only rarely do what I think of as “director’s tricks” signal something else, namely Spielberg creating a photographic effect. I’m thinking of the numerous moments shot through glass (how the Orca is seen between the bleached jaws in Quint’s picture-window as it moves out of port, or the way the book on sharks Brody is reading gets reflected in Scheider’s teardrop-shaped spectacles and how he is seen through the Orca‘s cabin glass as he enjoys the chase after the Great White) or the simultaneous zoom forward/dolly back effect out of Vertigo when the young boy is devoured, or Quint’s machete seen against still waters, which feels like a symbol or a metaphor, but I’ll be damned if I know of what. The throwing down of a gauntlet, most likely. (There is an interesting parallel between Spielberg shooting through glass in Jaws and Roman Polanski doing the same thing a year earlier with reflective surfaces in Chinatown, and I assume the younger director was influenced by that motif.)\n\nThe assurance with which a then 28-year-old filmmaker with only a single theatrical feature under his belt and who was battling an unreliable special effect and the vicissitudes of shooting for long periods on the water approached this material is remarkable, and reminds one of another famed movie wunderkind making his first feature at 26. I’m not suggesting that Jaws is as stylistically challenging, as thematically daring, as dramaturgically rich or as cinematically influential as Citizen Kane; Kane is a statement, and Jaws, after all, is just a highly entertaining studio-produced thriller. But the youthful energy, the go-for-broke quality of a young man with a lot of creative ideas and who knows he’s got something very interesting by the tail, is the same in Spielberg as in Welles. The elation both unleashed in their audiences is similar too.\n\nTake that Vertigo effect, known as a dolly zoom. As Hitchcock developed and used it, the zoom/dolly (simultaneous dolly back and zoom forward) has always left me cold. It feels entirely studied — show-offy in an almost Scorsesean manner. (If you perform a Google search on the phrase you’ll see endless, panting if not orgasmic, appraisals. Thus has a reflexive love of camera angles and cutting superseded such old-fogeyish concerns as story and character.) It’s a nice idea, I suppose, but it doesn’t really approximate the queasy disorientation one feels with vertigo, and it tells us nothing about James Stewart’s character, or what he’s feeling, which would have been better expressed in a close-up on the actor, not on an alley or a steep bell-tower staircase. But Hitchcock at his show-off worst is about effects more than people; the same technique, in Jaws, illuminates character, because the camera is focused, not on objects but on a human being in turmoil. And the build-up to that moment is remarkable — the sort of thing audiences now take for granted but which was decidedly not the norm in 1975.\n\nFollowing the discovery of what seems to him — correctly, as it turns out — evidence of a fatal shark attack, Roy Scheider’s Martin Brody is sitting high on the beach, watching anxiously for any signs of trouble. (As well as giving him a choice view of the ocean as the swimmers congregate his position also indicates both how much he hates the water, and how isolated he is within his dilemma.) The set-up to the boy’s death is perfect, and shows how, again, the emphasis on the quotidian gives its opposite even greater impact. There’s no music in the sequence, for one thing, or at least not until just before young Alex Kintner is attacked, so we are not only unprepared for the shock, we are lulled into a kind of voyeuristic complacency even as our fears are heightened by the repeated teases Spielberg (and Verna Fields, his editor) throw our way and which act on Brody like an emotional pressure-cooker.\n\nAn enormously fat woman (Jean Canha) walks down the beach to the shore while at water’s edge a young man throws a stick into the ocean for his black lab Pippet to fetch.‡\n\nEmerging from the water, Alex (Jeffrey Voorhees) asks his mother (Lee Fierro) if he can get his raft and stay in just a little longer.\n\nThe camera pans up with Alex to where Brody sits looking out to sea in concern while his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary) chats with another couple, the Tafts (Fritzi Jane Courtney and Phil Murray).\n\nThere is a cut (#1) back to the boy throwing the stick again and Pippet giving chase into the waves, where he briefly disturbs a young couple.\n\nAnother cut (#2) as Alex runs past his mother down to the shore with his raft and climbs aboard as it floats out.\n\nA third cut, to the dog paddling toward shore with the stick in his mouth and intercepted by a young male swimmer.\n\nCut #4: The fat woman, serenely floating on her back.\n\nCut #5: Alex paddling the raft toward shore.\n\nCut #6: The young man wrestling Pippet for the stick and throwing it out again as the dog lopes into the water.\n\nCut #7: To Brody, watching all of this activity from high up on the beach.\n\nIt’s here that Spielberg and Fields engage in the movie’s first break with the documentary realism that has governed it from the beginning: An indistinct body walks by left to right in front of Brody, and once it’s passed, he’s closer to us. (Cut #8.) Another walker passes, and Brody is closer still, and larger. (Cut #9.) If this was a stylistic insertion merely, the cuts would be clever but intrusive. Each time this happens the new cut (which seems almost like a wipe dissolve but isn’t) represents another way in which Brody is thwarted. He’d wanted (and expected) to close the beaches after the first fatality and been vetoed by the Rotary-type mayor of Amity (Murray Hamilton); now, reduced to impotently observing from the sand, even that attempt at safeguarding the public is reduced, by the strolling figures obscuring his view of the water.\n\nCut #10: The fat woman floating. Another body moves across Brody’s field of vision, and after this wipe-like cut (#11), he’s further away from the camera again, Ellen sunning herself on the extreme left of the screen.\n\nCut #12: Yet another stroller walks in front of Brody, and when the cut is over we see, from Brody’s point of view, a dark shape moving through the water behind the fat woman.\n\nCut #13: Another wipe, and we see Brody sitting up in alarm.\n\nCut #14: Brody’s P.O.V.: Harry (Wally Hooper Jr.), an elderly male swimmer in a black bathing cap who has just swum under the fat woman, his head surfacing as he exhales.\n\nCut #15: The final wipe-like cut. Brody looks at first relieved, then annoyed and finally, disgusted.\n\nCut #16: The male half of the Tafts walks over to ask the police chief to do him a municipal favor. Brody’s view of the ocean is blocked once more.\n\nCut #17: The top of Brody’s head from just above the eyes is seen over Mr. Taft’s shoulder, as Brody raises his head up to look over him.\n\nCut #18: The ocean, seen in a reverse-angle shot from Brody’s P.O.V., the young female half of the couple we noticed previously seen over the man’s shoulder. She screams and disappears from view beneath the water.\n\nCut #19: Brody’s face as he stands, his anxious eyes on the water.\n\nCut #20: The girl rising up, on her boyfriend’s shoulders now as he emerges from the water.\n\nCut #21: Taft and Brody, at opposite sides of the screen. The man has been prating on this entire time, wholly oblivious either to what’s happening, or to the police chief’s distracted state. Scheider’s head is out of the frame; it returns as he lowers himself back down from his standing position.\n\nI won’t belabor this shot-by-shot description any longer. I simply wished to indicate how expertly the sequence has been put together, our own anxieties at ebb or neap tide depending on what Martin Brody sees and hears on the beach, and how he reacts. It’s notable too that there has been no “shark music” on the soundtrack during this sequence. Only once does John Williams not signal when the Great White is around: That famous moment of shock when Brody sees the shark off the Orca’s bow for the first time, before murmuring to Quint his now almost universally remembered line (ad-libbed by Scheider in rehearsal) “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” Otherwise, as with the death of the young female swimmer at the start, Williams alerts us to the animal’s presence, as he will do here, just before poor Alex Kintner is devoured.§\n\nWhen he is, the attack is shot in several ways: First, from below (as was the case with Crissie, the first victim), from the Great White’s P.O.V. moving upward, toward the boy’s kicking legs; from the beach, where the attack happens so fast we are, initially, as uncertain of what we’re seeing as the those on the shore; from Brody’s perspective; and, finally, from below again as Alex is pulled down into the depths. Although we do for a brief moment see young Jeffrey Voorhees rise up in a gush of blood, his torso and arm visible, and that’s terrible enough, a deleted scene using a rubber model apparently showed Alex’s death in horrific detail. And again, the snippets of film leading directly up to the sequence are of commonplace occurrences: A group of young boys running into the water, squealing as children do in groups; Harry telling Brody, “We know all about you, Chief. You don’t go in the water at all, do you?” and getting insulted when Brody answers, referring to his bathing-cap, “That’s some bad hat, Harry” (which plays off the police chief’s disgust at the old man for scaring him before) and walking off in high dudgeon; Ellen going behind the Chief, telling him he is uptight (there’s the understatement of the year) and massaging his shoulders; the Brody’s little son Sean (Jay Mello) playing in the sand and singing “Do You Know the Muffin Man?” Just down the beach from Sean, however, an ominous note is sounded: Pippet’s owner is calling for him, and getting no response. Spielberg and Fields cut to a piece of wood floating in the water, and our stomachs sink. Before we have time to more than make note of this, however (and if we did we might question how an animal of that size could be fatally attacked without making a sound or leaving a trace of blood) the boys in the water are seen from below, accompanied by the Stravinskiesque shark theme. The camera, which at that moment has become the Great White’s eyes, surveys the swimmers’ legs briefly, swings slowly to the left and zeroes in on Alex Kintner’s, kicking from the edge of his raft.\n\nAt this point things happen very quickly. The camera continues moving upward, fast, and we either hold our collective breath or want to scream at the boy to pull in his feet. The Vertigo effect follows the shot of Alex, also seen from below, being pulled into the depths, his screams choked off by the water presumably rushing into his lungs. The next cut is to Brody, staring, his eyes widening, his body beginning to move. The emotions we feel at seeing, however obliquely, a child killed in a brutal, bloody manner are magnified at that moment by the sudden sliding string note (what is known in the movie business as a sting) on the soundtrack as the camera simultaneously zooms in and dollies back. The Hitchcock move isolates Brody even further, and emphasizes his own shock and horror. And although it, or the shots in Vertigo if you prefer, have been imitated many times the only other, genuinely effective use of the technique I’ve encountered in a movie apart from Jaws is in another Spielberg (or at least, officially Spielberg-produced) picture, Poltergeist, where it becomes a supernatural optical illusion thrown up to keep a mother from rescuing her imperiled children. (When Scorsese employed it later, pointlessly, for GoodFellas, it served no dramatic or emotional purpose. To borrow a phrase from Eliot M. Camarena, it was just another of Little Marty’s ostentatious “Looka-me!” shots.) The emotional capper of the sequence, of course, is achingly human: The heart-clamp of Mrs. Kintner vainly searching for her son and calling his name. And all of this takes place in a little over four-and-a-half minutes of well-shot and artfully manipulated images. The first great sequence in Jaws begins barely 13 minutes into its 2 hour-and 4-minute running time.\n\nFor the fan of Jaws, watching it again is a bit like listening to a favorite band or singer’s “greatest hits” album. Every scene and sequence has something to recommend it, but we who are familiar with the picture are thinking ahead to this favorite scene or that: The “pier incident”; the “bigger boat” scene; the first barrel chase; the U.S.S. Indianapolis monologue; the “Smile, you sonofabitch!” climax. Yet some of the picture’s smaller moments are among its most keenly observed. In addition to the lovely bit in which little Jay Mello imitates Roy Scheider, charmingly played and sweetly scored by Williams and caught almost on the fly by the director and the gut-wrenching scene that precedes (and generates) it, in which Mrs. Kintner publicly slaps Brody for not closing the beaches are little tidbits and performances scattered throughout the movie that stay with you, or at any rate, stay with me.\n\nMrs. Kintner’s confrontation with Brody on the dock, filmed with beautiful understatement by Steven Spielberg, is at the emotional heart of the picture, and the most moving scene in it. (It’s also one of the reasons I find many of the current smart-ass references to Alex Kintner offensive. Who jokes about children being violently killed, except on “South Park”?) Lee Fierro’s simplicity and directness, the way she holds on to her soft-spoken dignity, her voice breaking only slightly as she pours out her grief and outrage, is a small model of effective acting. She turns a moment, and a role, that court cliché into a quiet little powerhouse. You may forget a lot of things, in any number of movies, but you never forget her.\n\nSpeaking of the indelible: Everyone remembers and loves Craig Kingsbury as Ben Gardner, justifiably, but how about the marvelous Peggy Scott as Polly, Chief Brody’s formidable looking yet sweet-voiced secretary? How about Fritzi Jane Courtney as the motel owner Mrs. Taft, who assures Ellen she’ll never be an islander and whose response to a tasteless jest at the town meeting (“I don’t think that’s funny at all, I’m sorry”) is cherishable, not for what she says but the inimitable way she says it?\n\nLorraine Gary, whose casting as Ellen Brody may have been seen as a matter of nepotism (she was the wife of Sid Sheinberg, the President and CEO of Universal, which financed and released the movie) is a wonderful presence in Jaws, and the focal figure in what is, I think, my favorite moment in the picture, one no one to my knowledge has ever commented on but which, again, points to the movie’s very human grounding. (I couldn’t find an image of it online either.) It’s at Quint’s shack, as Martin is preparing to leave on the Orca with the captain and Hooper. As the young ichthyologist’s gear is brought on board, Quint keeps up a running commentary on everything (this is where Shaw sings “Spanish Ladies,” which becomes one of the motifs in John Williams’ score). When he sees Ellen with Martin, his remarks take on a deliberately crude, sexual tone, meant to humiliate both husband and wife, and particularly to emasculate Martin for Ellen’s having to hear it. The couple ignores the bully, but he inhibits their farewell, making them approach it slantwise, although they both know Martin may never return. When Martin goes aboard Ellen, driven to the limits of her endurance by her emotions and by Quint’s cruel taunting, starts to walk in the opposite direction and the camera pans with her as the walk becomes a trot, then a run as, hands up before her as if to ward off an evil spirit (which Quint at that moment seems to embody) she rushes from the place like the Hounds of Hell are at her heels. It’s one of the most memorable (non-lethal) exits from a movie any actress has ever had.\n\nMany Jaws fans mis-remember the movie’s initial revelation of the un-seen shark. The moment the Great White’s head breaks the surface of the water off the Orca‘s bow and gives the chum-ladling Chief Brody such a start is so strong, so funny, and so well shot and edited, we may forget we’ve actually seen the shark already. It’s during the “estuary” scene, when the Scout leader (Ted Grossman) and three boys, including Chris Rebello as the Brodys’ young son Michael, are swamped by the Great White, their respective boats overturned in the pond. As Grossman reaches for his red canoe the shark is seen below the water, rising diagonally, its jaws closing around one of the man’s legs.¶ The filmmakers cut to a view from the shore as Grossman screams in pain and terror, then back as the Great White grabs his right arm, pulling him down below the surface. This is not only our first glimpse of the shark, beyond fins slicing through the waves, as at the beginning of this sequence, it’s also the first time we in the audience understand what Hooper knows and the mayor refuses to think about: That the thing is enormous, frighteningly huge. (A longer, bloodier scene was filmed and, like Alex Kintner’s gruesome death, mercifully cut.) Brody doesn’t see the shark, however; nor does anyone else who isn’t in the water, and even the survivors don’t see it clearly. The most those on shore can glimpse of it, as with the young painter by the estuary who spots it first, are its dorsal and anal fins before it dips completely below the water; that moment is wonderfully framed, with little Jay Mello building sand castles in the foreground, his back to the water, completely oblivious of the real-life monster haunting his vicinity.\n\nI have not really begun to cite the sequences in Jaws that make it such an accomplished entertainment: The nocturnal search for the Great White in Hooper’s yacht and his encounter with Ben Gardner’s pop-eyed head; the initial confrontation between Brody and the Mayor on the ferry, beautifully captured by Spielberg in one static shot lasting a full minute and-a-half; the town meeting and Quint’s memorable entrance into the picture (he would use fingernails on a chalkboard, wouldn’t he?); the attempt by two Islanders to hook the shark with a raw pot-roast during which they are unpleasantly surprised by their unseen quarry and which is both scarifying and funny; the invasions from the mainland, first by tourists and then by an anarchic Armada of mercenary idiots who will, as Hooper says, be lucky to get out of the harbor alive; the July 4th sequence, ending with exactly the panic the Mayor predicted; the first, inconclusive, “barrel chase” on the Orca; Quint’s U.S.S. Indianapolis monologue, tossed off by Sackler in a few sentences, “polished” by John Milius to an eventual nine pages and edited by Shaw to a more manageable, and compelling three-and-a-half minutes**; the second encounter with the Great White, when things go from bad to worse and which more or less comprises the last third of the picture; the cunning manner with which Spielberg and Fields comingle their controlled underwater shots with the hair-raising footage by Ron and Valerie Taylor of a real Great White struggling to escape the cage with which it has gotten entangled. Nor have I mentioned how cannily the filmmakers, plagued by mechanical problems, turned a disadvantage into mystery for the audience, particularly in the opening sequence, when our not seeing what is attacking Susan Backlinie in the dark waters makes what is happening to her even more terrifying. For that matter I haven’t begun to discuss the superb sound effects by John R. Carter and Robert Hoyt, or the splendid variegation of John Williams’ score (and Herbert W. Spencer’s orchestration of it) nor how fine the trio of over-the-title leads is.\n\nIn common with very few pictures, there isn’t a scene in Jaws that feels out of place, or superfluous, or which goes on too long, or indeed too briefly. The craftsmanship extends to every department, very much including poor Russell Mattey, who designed the shark and who comes in for much opprobrium for it not working as well in Massachusetts as it had in L.A. Orson Welles famously defined a movie director as a man who presides over accidents: “They’re the only things that keep a film from being dead.” Jaws, a movie much concerned with death, and beset by accident, vibrates with life.\n\n*Off the top of my head: La règle du jeu (Rules of the Game), La Grande Illusion, Les Enfants du Parais, La Belle et la Bête, Le Salaire de la peur (The Wages of Fear), Les quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows), Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg), Special Section, La Cage aux Folles, Shoah, Au Revoir Les Enfants, the Gérard Depardieu Cyrano de Bergerac, The Seventh Seal, Smiles of a Summer Night, Man on the Roof, parts of Scenes from a Marriage, Twist and Shout, Pelle the Conqueror, Otto E Mezzo (8 1⁄2), The Battle of Algiers, La Conformista, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, Amarcord, A Special Day, Allegro non tropo, Cinema Paradiso, Der Blau Angel, M, Die Marquise von O (The Marquise of O), Das Boot, The Nasty Girl, Rashomon, The Seven Samurai, Kagemusha, and Ostře sledované vlaky (Closely Watched Trains). I suppose Sergio Leone’s “Spaghetti Westerns” also qualify, although I have only ever seen their English-language versions (again: why would I want to hear some Italian’s voice coming out of Clint Eastwood’s mouth?) and none, alas, in a theater.\n\n†See Stephen Farber and Marc Green, Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case, 1988.\n\n‡I suppose I am being abusive (isn’t that the word your algorithm tarred with me, Zuckerberg?) saying an enormously fat woman is, in fact, enormously fat. Today she would no doubt be described by the deluded of the so-called body positivity movement (comprised almost entirely of morbidly obese women, as overweight men are not allowed in, or even acknowledged) as full-figured, healthy and beautiful.\n\n§Williams and Spielberg do cheat a bit by using the shark motif when Hooper finds the tooth in Ben Gardner’s hull, but if you understand billing at all you know the filmmakers weren’t about to kill off Richard Dreyfuss that early in the picture. The music subliminally primes us for a scare, and Gardner’s head popping out provides the shock.\n\n¶There’s a continuity error here, one of the few in Jaws: When Grossman falls out of the boat, he’s barefoot. When his severed leg is seen falling to the sandy bottom it’s wearing a sneaker.\n\n**Pauline Kael objected, understandably, to this, wondering why no one involved considered the feelings of the dead men’s survivors, yet some of them expressed gratitude for finally understanding what had happened to their loved ones.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSee also:\n\nPart One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Three\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/11/the-magic-factory-part-three-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-screenwriters-screenwriting-and-screenplays/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive.

It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nVII. Specific Movies\n\n“Making-Of” books are a fairly recent phenomenon, although a handful were published in the 1950s. They seem, as a genre, to have gotten a boost in the early ’70s from the success of Jerome Agel’s massive (and, to me, unreadable) The Making of Kubrick’s 2001. Herewith a few of the better ones.\n\n73. Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho Stephen Rebello (1998)\n\nRebello does an exceptional job of illuminating the history of Psycho from Robert Bloch’s short story “The Real Bad Friend” and the later novel through Hitchcock’s interest in it and the writing by Joseph Stefano of the screenplay to the filming itself, a deliberate attempt by the director to make a theatrical hit on a television budget, and with a television crew. I use the word “exceptional” above because Rebello was not writing a contemporaneous account of a new movie but sifting through then-nearly 50 year-old records and the memories of the surviving participants.\n\nAmong other things, the author demolishes Saul Bass’ ludicrous claim that he directed the shower sequence, which the credulous had unquestioningly accepted as fact.\n\n74. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Making of Steven Spielberg’s Classic Film Ray Morton (2007)\n\nFew theatrical releases in my lifetime enchanted, and excited, me more than this one, and Morton’s intelligent, thorough account of its making was worth the three-decade wait. His archeological excursions into the authorship of the screenplay, attributed solely to Spielberg, is especially useful. (Among those who worked on it, some of them extensively: Jerry Belson, John Hill, Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins.) The author is also excellent on the extraordinary special effects, and why they looked so much better than those in the contemporaneous Star Wars. Morton’s is as close as we are likely to get to a definitive history of one of the best pop movies of the 1970s.\n\n75. Close Encounters of the Third Kind Diary Bob Balaban (1977; Reprinted 2003)\n\nBalaban — whom theatregoers might have remembered as Linus in the Off-Broadway musical You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and moviegoers would have recalled as the boy in Midnight Cowboy who blows Jon Voight in the movie theatre — got himself cast in CE3K in the time-honored fashion of actors: He lied. His character, the American interpreter for the scientist played by François Truffaut, was supposed to be fluent in French and Balaban could recall a few phrases from his high school studies; spoken quickly and authoritatively, that was sufficient to fool the casting directors. Balaban’s diary of the filming has a wonderful immediacy and is especially informative on the many weeks of filming in the huge Alabama hangar converted into the Devil’s Tower “Other Side of the Moon” set for the alien landing. His book is one of best glimpses we’ve ever gotten into the day-to-day realities of filming an important popular motion picture, an account written with unusual perceptiveness and wit.\n\n76. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Ultimate Visual History Michael Klastorin (2017)\n\nPublished in conjunction with the long-awaited (by me, at any rate) 40th anniversary theatrical re-release of CE3K, the movie of movies from my late adolescence. A smallish coffee-table book — the best kind, easily read — packed with beautiful color photographs and useful information on one of the most visually ravishing movies of its time. Had Close Encounters entered the market when Steven Spielberg wished, not in the late autumn of 1977 but before the May premiere of Star Wars, it would almost certainly have stolen George Lucas’ thunder, in no small part due to its superior look. Achieved by filming the special effects shots in 35mm and blowing them up to 70, softening the blue-screen edges and permitting the marriage of backgrounds and effects to appear seamless, this process had the subsequent effect of making Vilos Zsigmond’s muted cinematography look even more impressive than what Lucas and his team had unveiled earlier in the year.\n\nSee also: Encounters of the Third Kind: A Document Of The Film (1977) A beautiful contemporaneous trade paperback published by Ballantine with a lovely introduction by Ray Bradbury.\n\n77. Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven’s Gate Steven Bach (1985)\n\nBach was one of the executives at United Artists (senior vice-president and head of worldwide production) as Michael Cimino was filming his epic about the Johnson County wars, and intimately involved in approving the picture for shooting. Although he is critical in the book of his own failings during the making of the movie whose budget overruns (and subsequent poor box-office performance) more or less destroyed UA, some — including Pauline Kael in her review of the book for the New Yorker — felt he let himself off the hook too easily. But in a story like this, there are always multiple points of view, and many directions from which fingers can and will be pointed. I have never seen Heaven’s Gate, so I can’t speak to its merits or defects, but a friend whose opinions I value admires it enormously and thinks the critics who slammed it, pretty much en masse, got it wrong. And United Artists had a history of fucking things up financially before it ever engaged Michael Cimino; in 1970 the men who’d been running it for 20 years were ousted for losing $35 million on bad choices. Studios spend comparable amounts today on catering but 50 years ago that was real money, just as the $44 million spent on Heaven’s Gate was a substantial amount in 1980.\n\n78. The Jaws Log Carl Gottlieb (1975; Updated numerous times to 2012)\n\nThe first book of its kind I purchased with my own money, and one I re-read every few years for the pleasure of its author’s company and the remembered delights of a favorite movie. Gottlieb, who played the Amity Island newspaper editor Meadows, was the credited co-author of the screenplay after Peter Benchley turned in his unacceptable first draft; although he was by no means the last writer to tweak the picture’s dialogue (the playwright Howard Sackler worked on it — the USS Indianapolis monologue was his — as did John Milius, Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood and the third-billed star Robert Shaw) Gottlieb was on the set by day and working with Spielberg on revisions at night. His version of the filming, while obviously subjective, had the advantage of being fresh, and is about as reliable a narrative as we have of what, to everyone’s surprise, became the highest-grossing of all movies within months of its opening, knocking The Godfather off the top of the list. That fact, and the subsequent shark-like feeding frenzy among Hollywood suits for the next sure thing (which is of course a chimera) led, slowly and inexorably, to the lousy state of things we’ve been living through at the movies for the last four decades. But I for one do not blame Spielberg for that (although he certainly helped dumb things down in the ’80s). Due in large part to the trouble they had making it, for which so much had to be compensated and because of which the actors, their director and their screenwriter had more time than usual in which to improvise dialogue and deepen their characters,* Jaws remains the most beautifully assembled and entertaining of popcorn movies.\n\nGottlieb’s revised editions correct his few errors and elaborate nicely on what he’s learned since that he didn’t know in 1975.\n\nSee also: On Location… On Martha’s Vineyard: The Making of the Movie Jaws Edith Blake (1975) and Jaws: Memories from Martha’s Vineyard: A Definitive Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Greatest Suspense Thriller of All Time Matt Taylor (2012) Blake is a Martha’s Vineyard resident, a photographer who wrote a column for the Vineyard Gazette. Her book is packed with the many terrific photographs she took and benefits greatly from her local’s perspective. Taylor’s gorgeous coffee-table style trade paperback benefits from page after page of luscious color photos detailing every aspect and phase of the production.\n\n79. The Magic Factory: How MGM Made An American in Paris Donald Knox (1973)\n\n“MGM” didn’t make An American in Paris, of course; that shorthand takes in the producer, Arthur Freed and his un-credited associate Roger Edens; the director, Vincente Minnelli; the star/choreographer, Gene Kelly; his fellow actors Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Nina Foch and Georges Guétary; the screenwriter, Alan Jay Lerner; the lyricist, Ira Gershwin; the music directors, Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green and Conrad Salinger; the cinematographers, Alfred Glik (the film) and John Alton (the ballet); the editor, Adrienne Fazan; the art and set directors, Preston Ames, Cedric Gibbons, F. Keogh Gleason and Edwin B. Willis; the costumers, Orry-Kelly, Walter Plunkett and Irene Sharaff; and the hundreds of technicians, crew, dancers, extras, costumers and artisans MGM employed. Knox’s oral history of one of the most accomplished and pleasurable of all movie musicals is itself a pleasure, and covers with admirable thoroughness every aspect of the production.\n\nSee also: Directed by Vincente Minnelli Stephen Harvey (1990) A very fine and perceptively written coffee-table tome on Minnelli by the late critic and associate curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art. As well as offering his well-considered critical analyses of Minnelli’s movies Harvey also reveals the extent of the director’s visual fussiness: On Some Came Running he had a Ferris wheel moved a few inches, decided he didn’t like it and had it moved back. Although unrelated to Minnelli, I still cherish a critique Harvey made in his Pyramid Illustrated History volume on Fred Astaire in 1975: Writing about Silk Stockings, he cited as a defect of that particular dud the “Novocain-tinged line readings” of Cyd Charisse. Perfect.\n\n80. The Making of The Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM and the Miracle of Production #1060 Aljean Harmetz (1977)\n\nI wish Aljean Harmetz published more books but this one, and her Casablanca study (see below) are worth a barrelful of other, shoddier “making of” volumes. She was the first to assay The Wizard of Oz in depth, and there is almost nothing about that beloved musical soufflé she missed, and little she got wrong. Harmetz traces the history of the picture from the marvelous Baum books to the subsequent popular stage musical of 1902 and the largely forgotten 1925 silent movie (in which Oliver Hardy played the Tin Man) through the first faltering steps toward a new screenplay and on to the composing of the imperishable song score, the designing of the sets and the sometimes-troubled filming itself, speaking to as many survivors as were able and willing to talk. (The Introduction was written by that most adorable of witches, Margaret Hamilton, about whom I have never heard a bad word.) People seeking an avalanche of color photos can look elsewhere. If you want the goods on how Oz was made, this is your book.\n\nSee also: The World of Entertainment!: Hollywood’s Greatest Musicals Hugh Fordin (1975) Speaking of MGM, if you enjoy movie musicals you may wish to avail yourself of the late Hugh Fordin’s fascinating history of the Arthur Freed unit, which along with some appalling dross did indeed produce the greatest of them after the glory days of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO and before the advent of Cabaret and Fiddler on the Roof: The Wizard of Oz, Cabin in the Sky, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Harvey Girls, Easter Parade, Royal Wedding, An American in Paris, Singin’ in the Rain, The Band Wagon, Gigi. Some spoilsports complained that Fordin’s book was little more than a collection of telegrams and in-house memos, but reproducing these primary sources is a perfectly legitimate, and often illuminating, way of putting together the history of a movie production unit. Besides, most of Rudy Behlmer’s books are collections of similar items and no one complained about that, or needed to.\n\n81. The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman’s Masterpiece Jan Stuart (2000)\n\nAnother splendid oral history, this time of what may have been the most representative American movie of the 1970s. It’s a picture that could only have been filmed by Robert Altman, the exception to nearly all my rules about directors of movies. Although conceived and written by Joan Tewkesbury, Nashville is the ultimate exemplar of its maker’s technical acumen and personal, highly idiosyncratic style. We learn here about the picture’s origins and how Tewkesbury came to write her kaleidoscopic, elliptical screenplay with its 24-character ensemble (the movie was her idea, pitched to Altman while they were working on McCabe and Mrs. Miller) as well as how the roles were cast and the freedom Altman gave his actors, not only to improvise, which was by then the lingua franca of his method, but to compose many of the songs heard in the movie, as well as about the day-to-day exigencies of the location shoot. As with Michael Zuckoff’s later oral biography of Altman, this concatenation of contrapuntal voices is the perfect format to illuminate a movie whose aural imprint is as memorable as its visuals. One of the nicest compliments I can pay Stuart’s book is to say that just talking about it makes me want to read it a second time.\n\nAlthough I hate to keep harping on the defects of Wikipedia (no I don’t, not really) the category into which their Usual Gang of Idiots has dropped this nonpareil is too good not to share: On the page devoted to the movie we learn that Nashville is an “American satirical musical ensemble comedy-drama film.” I suppose we ought to be grateful for how much nettlesome critical thinking these imps of the perverse save us through their obsessive need for categorization.\n\n82. Notes Eleanor Coppola (1979)\n\nYounger people may not credit this, but there were few celebrity figures in the 1970s more compelling than Francis Ford Coppola, and no movie on which more ink was spilled before its premier at the Cannes Film Festival than Apocalypse Now. Everyone who cared even slightly about the present and future of American movies knew that the director and co-writer of The Godfather and The Godfather — Part II (and the writer-director of The Conversation) was shooting an epic vision of the Vietnam war, the most controversial American-directed conflict since our rape of the Philippines 80 years earlier and from which we had only extracted ourselves, bloodied and bowed, a scant few years earlier. That Coppola was refracting his version of the war through the equally vivid nightmare of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness made an intriguing picture sound even more enticing. His wife Eleanor was there throughout, watching and worrying as her husband (and his cast and crew) grew increasingly less and less tethered to reality, as one leading man (Harvey Keitel) was replaced by another (Martin Sheen) who then suffered a near-fatal coronary, and as the entire project threatened to spin crazily out of control and engulf her and everyone she loved. Eleanor Coppola captures all of this and more in spare, limpid prose that limns the everyday and the extraordinary with the same practiced, sometimes coolly imperturbable eye.\n\n83. Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case Stephen Farber and Marc Green (1988)\n\nIn July of 1982 during a night shoot for the multiple-director omnibus Twilight Zone: The Movie, a helicopter crash killed the actor Vic Morrow and two illegally employed Vietnamese children. It was one of the worst, most incompetent and, as we later learned, unconscionable incidents in movie history. Farber and Green followed the case and in their book explicated every sickening detail, including the culpability of the picture’s producer, Steven Spielberg, who instantly distanced himself, in one of the more craven performances of the last 50 years, condemned the director John Landis and desperately downplayed his own involvement. Not that Landis did not deserve opprobrium; in fact he deserved a prison sentence. (Did anyone really expect him to receive one?) He also behaved like an appalling, infantile brat during the trial, which is as revealing of his character as his willingness to endanger the lives of his actors, his technicians, and two small immigrant children.\n\nSee also: Indecent Exposure — A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street David McClintick 1983. When the wildly successful television executive David Begelman foolishly (and puzzlingly) embezzled petty amounts of cash from, among others, the actor Cliff Robertson, no one outside Begelman’s circle expected to hear about it. Then Robertson went public. The result was one of the great scandals of a scandalous decade. McClintock covers every tawdry feature of a cheap, mystifying affair.\n\n84. Picture Lillian Ross (1952)\n\nThe grandmother of all fly-on-the-wall accounts of moviemaking. Ross followed the filming by John Huston of his and his co-scenarist Albert Band’s adaptation of The Red Badge of Courage and its subsequent dismembering by MGM — which slashed it from two hours to 69 minutes — and published her report first in The New Yorker and later as a book. It’s a classic in a field that hasn’t many masterworks. Huston was the most reproduceable of speakers, and in an accurate account of his speech such as Ross provides the reader can hear his curious, deceptively mellow tones and odd conversational patterns and locutions. (Peter Viertel in White Hunter, Black Heart, his wonderful 1953 roman à clef about the filming of The African Queen, also got Huston absolutely down.)\n\nSee also: Anatomy of a Motion Picture Richard Griffith (1959) An enjoyable, largely photographic, account of the making of Anatomy of a Murder.\n\n85. Put Money in Thy Purse: The Making of Othello Micheál MacLiammóir (1952)\n\nOthello was Orson Welles‘ most protracted movie, shot on multiple continents and filmed over time; it was begun in 1949 but for complex reasons was not completed until 1951, and not exhibited before 1952. (The American release was further delayed, to 1955.) Filming had already begun when the original producer informed Welles he’d run out of money. With no cash and no costumes, the filmmaker shot two crucial reels depicting the murder of Roderigo in a Turkish bath in Morocco while local tailors labored to sew the clothing he needed to proceed. He was forced eventually to stop shooting and earn money to continue, and even then had to work around the schedules of his actors. Out of this grew the erroneous legend that Welles couldn’t complete a project. MacLiammóir, the movie’s inspired Iago, kept a contemporaneous diary that captures the madness of the filming and Welles’ mercurial moods and contradictory impulses as well as his talents and determination in the face of setbacks that would have defeated a lesser man. It’s a tour de force literary performance, one of the inarguably great books on the making of an equally great, if necessarily flawed, motion picture.\n\n“… everything as I see it is against him before he starts, but his courage, like everything else about him, egotism, generosity, ruthlessness, forbearance, impatience, sensitivity, grossness and vision, is magnificently out of proportion.” — MacLiammóir on Welles\n\n86. Roger Moore’s James Bond Diary Roger Moore (1973)\n\nWritten when Moore was filming Live and Let Die, his (if you’ll pardon the seeming oxymoron) maiden effort as James Bond. Whether Moore habitually kept a diary or did so only for one picture, the resulting manuscript is a delightful account of a typically complicated international Bond shoot, nicely illustrated with on-set photos and publicity stills, although as was typical of Fawcett paperbacks of the time you risked tearing the spine apart if you opened the book wide enough to read their captions. (The British edition, published by Pan, contained a different set of photos, most in color. Both are now prohibitively expensive, but the History Press reprinted the book in 2019, with a foreword by David Hedeson, the movie’s Felix Leiter.) I daily await with a certain dread the discovery by the Generation-Z cancel-culture brigade of Live and Let Die, with its hip black villains and sinister depiction of Baron Samedi. Doubtless they will demand Eon burn every extant copy, or get Disney to buy them all and stick them in a subterranean vault with its prints of Song of the South.\n\nMoore was many 007 fans’ least favorite Bond apart from George Lazenby, but I usually found him charming company. So is his book.\n\n87. Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca – Bogart, Bergman, and World War II Aljean Harmetz (1992)\n\nWhat Harmetz did for The Wizard of Oz in 1977 she did again for Casablanca in 1992. She covers, with her usual diligent thoroughness, its origins in the un-produced play Everybody Comes to Rick’s; the complicated saga of the screenplay and its multiple authors; the miracle of its casting; the filming and editing; and the picture’s decades-long legacy which saw a popular wartime romance gradually become recognized as the ultimate movie-movie of the great age of studio filmmaking. Not incidentally, the author also addresses, in detail, the way the government controlled the content of what American audiences saw during the Second World War. Other writers, such as Glenn Frankel, have attempted to do for pictures such as The Searchers and Midnight Cowboy what Harmetz did for two of the most well-loved American of all movies, but no one has come close.† A treasure.\n\n88. A Star Is Born: The Making of the 1954 Movie and Its 1983 Restoration Ronald Haver (1988)\n\nWithout the author’s perseverance, it’s unlikely that A Star is Born would ever have been restored and rediscovered. Granted there were gaps in the footage that were only partially mitigated in the restored version by fuzzy outtakes and still photographs. But a minor masterpiece of Hollywood craft had, like Lawrence of Arabia, been cut, and cut again, although at least Lawrence got a full release at its original length; A Star is Born was shorn of far too much footage before its premiere, and Jack L. Warner showed so little faith in it that he had it eviscerated again after less than a month in theatres. (Perversely, Warner had also demanded that more footage be added to a movie that was already too long: The unnecessary “Born in a Trunk” number, which none of the creators of the movie had a hand in.) Haver’s essential book not only covers, with remarkable thoroughness, the development and filming of the movie but his own, only partly successful search for the lost footage and soundtrack. In this case, however, a partial success was still more than anyone could have hoped, or expected. If only for the restoration of the wonderfully written, beautifully shot and charmingly acted marriage proposal sequence on the soundstage, unseen for decades, we owe him.\n\nVII. Miscellaneous\n\n89. Are You Now or Have You Ever Been: The Investigation of Show Business by the Un-American Activities Committee, 1947-1956 Edited by Eric Bentley (1972)\n\nAlthough this small volume is essentially a playscript adapted by Bentley from his own, much longer book on the House Committee on Un-American Activities Thirty Years of Treason, it’s a perfect vest-pocket history of the hearings and the misery they merrily visited upon American citizens for the accused beliefs. In this pared-down version the veteran dramatist Bentley highlights some of the more memorable witnesses such as Marc Lawrence, who claimed he joined the Party to pick up girls; Paul Robeson, who chopped the Committee down to size but was its victim anyway; Sterling Hayden, who ratted on others at the urging of his analyst and loathed himself forever after for it; that dissembling rat Elia Kazan; Lillian Hellman, who with her lawyer cannily (and memorably) extricated herself from having to testify; Zero Mostel, who was clever enough to gentle himself off the hook (but who was blacklisted all the same); and of course the drama’s central tragic figure, Larry Parks, the unconscionable bullying of whom into informing on others against his will remains a stain on our national character and institutions. But then, the hearings were largely a matter of, in no particular order, vengeance against Roosevelt, scare-tactics in aid of building a National Security State, anti-Semitism and the totalitarian impulse with its attendant sadistic delight in forcing others to bend to the will of petty martinets drunk on temporary power.\n\nThere seems to be an un-organized movement afoot among many Millennials these days to deify these bastards and to pretend that a few ineffectual Communist cells in Hollywood somehow poisoned the American character. It goes hand in hand with the new intolerance of alleged leftists who seek to call anyone who disagrees with them a racist, a Nazi, a Putin-puppet or, saints preserve us, “an anti-vaxxer.” Bentley’s book is a needed corrective. Now, how can we get these mindless lickspittles to read it?\n\nSee also: Thirty Years of Treason: Excerpts from Hearings Before the House Committee on Un-American Activities 1938-1968 Eric Bentley (1971) The mother-lode: 1,000-plus pages of testimony.\n\n90. City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s Otto Friedrich (1986)\n\nOne of the most compelling narratives about the movie business ever written. Friedrich begins his portrait with the old-fashioned triumph of Gone with the Wind (1939) and ends, a decade and a world war later, with the Grand Guignol cynicism of Sunset Boulevard (1950). Nothing escapes his notice, from the sexual epistemology of the Hollywood closet and assimilated Jews worrying that focusing on anti-Semitism and the plight of European Jewry will bring unwanted goysische attention to themselves, to Joseph L. Mankiewicz despairing of the sub-literate ignorance around him and the arrogance of Walt Disney, presuming to teach his fellow citizens about concert music about which he himself was staggeringly obtuse. Among this magnificent book’s strengths is its author’s knowledge about, and ability to limn, the émigré community of largely German expatriates, most but not all of them Jewish, some of them (like Thomas Mann) giants struggling to eke out a living, as the late Martin Greif put it in one of his once-annual Gay Engagement Calendars, in the land of Pygmies. If, as they like to say in the ad biz, you read only one book about Hollywood, it should be this one. I regard it, without hesitation, as not only the finest book on Hollywood I’ve ever read but the best of all books about the movies.\n\n91. The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era Thomas Schatz (1988)\n\nSchatz’s impeccably researched and forcefully written book is perhaps the ultimate refutation of auteurism. Taking off from the critic André Bazin’s commentary that one ought to praise American cinema “for what is most admirable, i.e., not only the talent of this or that filmmaker, but the genius of the system,” the author illuminates how that system worked, and who was most responsible for the classics that occasionally emerged from the various factories: Surprise, Mr. Sarris! The producers.\n\n92. Haywire Brooke Hayward (1977)\n\nI considered placing this one in my round-up of actor biographies but I include it here because Hayward takes in so many Hollywood personalities and so much cultural history of her youth and childhood that her book transcends the personal memoir and becomes something of a collective biography. Born to the agent and theatrical producer Leland Hayward and the charming screen actress Margaret Sullavan, she and her siblings were caught in a maelstrom that also included on the periphery Henry, Jane and Peter Fonda, a family whose sad, creepy dysfunction rivals that of the Haywards. Brooke’s sister Bridget was a probable suicide at 21 and her brother Bill finally succumbed, years after this book was published, shooting himself in the heart. Tolstoy was right, as he so often was, about unhappy families; Hayward’s book may be recommended to anyone who still maintains a childlike faith in the annealing powers of fame and money.\n\n93. A Heart at Fire’s Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann Steven C. Smith (1991)\n\nHerrmann had long been in need of a comprehensive, sympathetic and erudite biography, and in Smith he got all that and more. The giant on whose shoulders so many, both major and minor, have stood, Herrmann brought to Hollywood a radical approach to scoring movies; it’s more than appropriate that his initial movie score should not only be for his friend and radio collaborator Orson Welles, but for that most radical of talking pictures, Citizen Kane. More than anyone else in movies, Herrmann concentrated on orchestral color rather than themes and motifs and only he, I think, could have composed what he called the “black-and-white score” for Psycho; certainly only he would have written it solely for strings. Although he could be bombastic — there are moments in his otherwise lovely score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir that set my teeth on edge, and his last, Taxi Driver, is largely over-emphatic and often hysterical — his was a singular talent; it’s impossible now to imagine certain movies (Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Hangover Square, On Dangerous Ground, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, North by Northwest, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Psycho, Jason and the Argonauts, Marnie) without his music. An explosive, highly-strung artist, Herrmann often clashed with his colleagues, even with the imperious Alfred Hitchcock. It was the composer, for example, who averred, against the instincts of the director, that the crop-dusting sequence in North by Northwest should be assembled without music until its climax, and who insisted that the Psycho shower scene must have it. That one stood as perhaps the most famous piece of music composed for a major American movie since the Max Steiner “Tara’s Theme” in Gone with the Wind, and until John Williams’ equally unsettling theme for the Great White shark in Jaws. Smith’s biography of the man who virtually defined the word “irascible” is full of splendid insights and striking details. One among many: His description of Herrmann in the ’70s scouring Manhattan record store soundtrack holdings for bootlegs of his scores and banging angrily on the bins with his cane when he found one.\n\n94. It Don’t Worry Me: The Revolutionary American Films of the Seventies Ryan Gilbey (2003)\n\nI regard two eras in American movies as our finest: The 1930s (at least once the technicians mastered the soundtrack and freed the camera again) which in spite of the reactionary Catholic domination of film via the Production Code saw such wonders in comedy, drama, melodrama, thriller and social polemic as (to take only 1931 into consideration) City Lights, Little Caesar, The Front Page, The Public Enemy, Monkey Business and Frankenstein. No one would suggest that all the pictures of the decade were as adult, witty, sophisticated, daring and critical of social norms as the best of them, but the ’30s was the period when the movies grew up and burst their chains, despite the efforts of small minds to contain them. In the creatively comparable era of the ’70s it was only the public’s desire for the conformity of the sure thing, and the studios’ concomitant eagerness to replicate the contours of what had been successful, that pretty much put an end to personal movies made by serious writers, actors and filmmakers. It is astonishing that someone as young as Ryan Gilbey, who was four years old when Taxi Driver was released in 1976 and who missed nearly all of the important pictures he writes about so knowledgeably, and beautifully, when they were new could write a book this good about an era he had to catch up with at Bfi screenings and on video as a young man. When I add that he is British, it should go some way toward conveying my surprise and delight with this, the best book on 1970s American movies I’ve ever encountered.\n\nSee also: Hollywood Films of the Seventies: Sex, Drugs, Violence, Rock ‘n’ Roll & Politics Seth Cagin and Philip Dray (1984) This small book was, until It Don’t Worry Me, not only the best available volume on ’70s cinema but virtually the only one. It’s still a splendid and insightful title.\n\n95. Movie Comedy Teams Leonard Maltin (1970; reprinted in 1973 and 1985)\n\nA breezy overview of a dozen major teams from Laurel and Hardy to Martin and Lewis, touching as well on some minor ones (Noonan and Marshall, anyone?) by a professional fan with an ear for the telling phrase. In addition to the dozens of wonderful black-and-white photographs, Maltin also provides complete filmographies and biographical details that make this one of the more pleasurable books of its kind.\n\nFor the longest time I thought that beautiful cover on the 1973 reissue as well as the one on Marjorie Rosen’s Popcorn Venus were the work of Richard Amsel. However, the gifted artist and Amsel expert Adam McDaniel informs me that both were by Ann Meisel.\n\n96. Naming Names Victor Navasky (1980)\n\nNavasky, then the editor of The Nation, later its publisher (back when it was still true to its roots as a radical publication and not yet another compromised house organ for the DNC) was perhaps as a result the perfect man to write what for many years was the definitive book on the Hollywood Blacklist. I’ve read numerous volumes on the subject both before the 1980 publication of Naming Names, and in the four decades since, and none has exhibited more erudition, social-historical acumen or unsentimental compassion. This is a subject which in the years since the Clinton campaign launched its phony accusations of “Russian collusion” against her opponent has become, to my astonishment, current again.\n\nSee also: Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist Patrick McGilligan and Paul Buhle (1997) An extremely informative collection of interviews with survivors of the 1950s Red Scare including Norma Barzman, Walter Bernstein, Alvah Bessie, Betsy Blair, Jeff Corey, Jules Dassin, Faith Hubley, Marsha Hunt, Paul Jarrico, Mickey Knox, Mill Lampell, Ring Lardner Jr., Karen Morley, Abraham Polonsky, Martin Ritt and Lionel Stander.\n\n97. Double Life Miklós Rózsa (1989) Rózsa was one of the masters, not only of 20th century movie scoring but of concert forms as well; hence the title of his memoir, taken from one of the MGM pictures for which he provided his distinctive Hungarian folk-laced musical scores. Notable among composers for his erudition and wit (in several languages!), Rózsa was suited, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, to writing a book as informal, and informative, and as charming, as this one.\n\nWhy, if you don’t know him, you should:\n\nConcert works: Theme, Variations and Finale; Three Hungarian Sketches; Rhapsody for cello and piano; The Vintner’s Daughter – twelve variations on a French folk song; Violin Concerto; Piano Concerto; Spellbound Concerto; Sonata for guitar\n\nMovie scores: The Jungle Book (1942), Double Indemnity (1944), The Lost Weekend (1945), Spellbound (1945), The Killers (1946), The Red House (1947), Madame Bovary (1959), Quo Vadis (1951), Ivanhoe (1952), Julius Caesar (1953), Lust for Life (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), El Cid (1961), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973), Time After Time (1979), Eye of the Needle (1981), Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982)\n\nMasterworks: The Thief of Bagdad (1940), The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970, score based on his Violin Concerto), Providence (1977)\n\nSee also: No Minor Chords: My Days in Hollywood André Previn (1991) A teenage prodigy, Previn began working in the MGM music department at 16 and was composing for films at 17. Although he turned his back on movie scoring in favor of conducting concert music, in spite of four Academy Awards (and 13 nominations; we may not presume that an Oscar is a sign of quality, but those numbers are impressive) his “Days in Hollywood” certainly made an impression on him. Reading his book is like listening to him speak: A pleasure. In addition to illuminating the corners of his own creative life, at MGM and elsewhere, Previn is often wickedly funny about others, as when he quotes Frederick Loewe’s staggering musical pretension; his own stunned reaction at witnessing, just before intermission of the flop Alan Jay Lerner-Leonard Bernstein musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the shadow of Abraham Lincoln ominously crossing the stage and thinking to himself, “I’m going mad”; and, on being asked to meet with Michael Eisner to discuss a continuation of Fantasia and discovering the Disney CEO wanted him to arrange an entire soundtrack of Beatles instrumentals.\n\n‘Tis a mad world, my masters.\n\n98. Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood Mark Harris (2009)\n\nWith this book Harris, at the time the only notable writer aside from Stephen King at Entertainment Weekly (or, as it is known in my home, Ew!) hit on a notion so good and so obvious in retrospect it’s amazing no one thought of it before: Examining the five Oscar nominees for Best Picture in 1967, the year that changed the contours of the movie business more than any since the advent of the talkies. The nominees represented the warring taste of American moviegoers, or at least how they were perceived by the studios: The well intentioned, feel-good-about-how-unbigoted-you-are-when-your-white-daughter-snags-Sidney-Poitier Stanley Kramer picture (Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner); the overblown musical/”family” film, a flop the studio flogged so relentlessly it almost had to get a nod (Doctor Dolittle); the phenomenally successful youth comedy directed by a theatre and movie wünderkind (Mike Nichols’ sophomore effort The Graduate); the witty whodunnit with a social conscience (In the Heat of the Night); and the most radical alternative movie of the year (Bonnie and Clyde). Harris guides the reader through the thickets of America’s late-’60s cultural divide, plots with admirable meticulousness how each picture was developed, made, marketed and received, and draws his irrefutable conclusions in a way that will keep even the most knowledgeable of readers riveted. Pictures at a Revolution is one of the few genuinely great new books on American movies produced so far this century.\n\n99. Roadshow: The Fall of Film Musicals in the 1960s Matthew Kennedy (2014)\n\nFollowing only five years after Mark Harris’ landmark study was another wonder, a book on a subject that on the surface should have attracted, as writer and reader, only a fan besotted by Julie Andrews and Barbra Streisand but which, to my almost shocked surprise and pleasure, was a serious, thorough, wonderfully written examination of a long-gone cultural phenomenon that, in its day and after the success of The Sound of Music, became the holy grail of every American movie studio: The roadshow musical. “Roadshows” were big-budget movies, usually in (as Cole Porter had it) glorious Technicolor, breathtaking CinemaScope and stereophonic sound that before general release at (as they then said) “popular prices” were exhibited in select cities on a reserved-seat basis, and were often accompanied by overture, intermission entr’acte and post-show “exit music.” One after another of these pictures flopped at the box office, some (Sweet Charity, Darling Lili) undeservedly, until the accumulated disaster pretty much killed off the movie musical. Kennedy is splendid company, witty and thoughtful by turns, and admirably thorough.\n\n100. Walt’s Time: From Before to Beyond Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman (1998)\n\nOne of the rarest of movie books to locate, and one of the most delightful. I have long felt the Shermans severely underrated as songwriters, but what isn’t widely enough known is how essential they were to the scripts of the pictures for which they wrote their literate yet accessible numbers. Mary Poppins is the classic example of a movie for which Richard (music and lyrics) and Robert (mostly lyrics) developed the story before Disney assigned a screenwriter, and the one that perhaps most fully expressed both their sensibility and his. They didn’t always operate at top of their game (who does?) either at Disney or, later, elsewhere, but they were right more often than they were wrong. The Shermans’ beautiful book celebrates a time and an opportunity they knew they were lucky to be chosen for, and to seize. Like its gently punning title and the brothers’ own penchant for merging old, ordinary words into entirely new and enchanting ones, Walt’s Time is a charming thing. I will resist the impulse to say it’s supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, but you are free to do so.\n\n*All, ironically, except Gottlieb’s own role, which got smaller with each revision, until it was comprised of a couple of lines in one brief scene: The one on the ferry, in which Roy Scheider’s Chief Brody is browbeaten into not closing the beaches after the girl’s death.\n\n†In addition to imposing anachronistic 21st century slang on events of the past, Frankel also makes far too easily-corrected factual errors, and mis-readings both of source material and finished film — errors which without a doubt will be repeated in the future by other lazy writers.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross"
