He is probably best known for co-writing the screenplay for \"Jaws\", as well as directing the 1981 low-budget cult film \"Caveman\".\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nGottlieb was born in New York City, the son of Elizabeth, a medical administrative assistant, and Sergius M. Gottlieb, an engineer. [ [http://www.filmreference.com/film/96/Carl-Gottlieb.html Carl Gottlieb Biography (1938-) ] ] After studying drama at Syracuse University, he became a member, in the 1960s, of the San Francisco improvisational comedy troupe \"The Committee\". They made one feature film: \"A Session with the Committee\".\n\nCareer\n\nHe began writing comedy for TV, contributing to \"The Bob Newhart Show\" (1972), \"All in the Family\", and \"The Odd Couple\". Minor acting roles have included \"M*A*S*H\" and \"Clueless\".\n\nGottlieb also cowrote David Crosby's two autobiographies, 1989's \"Long time Gone\" and 2006's \"Since Then\".\n\n\"Jaws\"\n\nGottlieb was hired as an actor to appear as Meadows, the editor of the local newspaper, in \"Jaws\". He was hired by his friend, Steven Spielberg, to redraft the script, adding more dimensions to the characters, particularly humour. Ironically, his redrafts reduced the role of Meadows (who still appears in the Town Hall corridor and the Tiger Shark scene).\n\nHe wrote a book, \"The Jaws Log\", about the notoriously difficult production of the film. Bryan Singer has referred to it as being \"like a little movie director bible\". [ [http://jawslog.com/ The Jaws Log ] ]\n\nHe was also enlisted under similar circumstances to work on the \"Jaws 2\" screenplay. He also co-wrote the screenplays for \"The Jerk\" and \"Jaws 3-D\". Gottlieb contributes to \"Jaws\" related activities, such as interviews (including for the upcoming \"The Shark is Still Working\") and attended JawsFest on Martha's Vineyard in June 2005.\n\nWriters' politics\n\nHe joined the Writers Guild of America in 1968 after becoming interested in Guild politics and being of service to fellow writers after writers' strikes in the 1970s and 1981. He ran for the Board of Directors in 1983, and has been re-elected for numerous terms ever since, including two stints as vice-president (1991-1994). He was again appointed VP of the Writers Guild of America, west in 2004. [ [http://www.wga.org/pr/0304/pr033004.html] Dead link|date=May 2008]\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links"
