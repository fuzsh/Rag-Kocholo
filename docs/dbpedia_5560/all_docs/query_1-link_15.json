        "text": "It's the opening of Jaws, the iconic John Williams theme is being heard for the first time and the opening credits are rolling as the shark searches through the water. We move to a beach setting at night, with a fire:\n\nScreenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb appears on screen.\n\nRight? That's right, but that's not the full story of who helped transfer Jaws from page to the big screen.\n\nBenchley and Gottlieb share screen credit for their script duties, not that they worked on it at the same time though. If that had been the case then the credits would have read as Peter Benchley & Carl Cotflieb, rather than Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb.\n\nCarl Gottlieb\n\nComedy and improv was his thing, which would stand Gottlieb in tremendous stead for his Jaws adventure, which was originally only going to be a one week dialogue spruce.\n\nGottlieb, who shared an agent at that time with Spielberg, and had worked with him on the TV move Something Evil, was sent the script - as it currently stood - with only three weeks before shooting was set to begin. It had one direction stuck to it, 'Eviscerate it'.\n\nHis job was to add both humour and help bring out the human elements, something which he did with great aplomb, which is why the dialogue still crackles as much today as it did in 1975. And why the film is so damn quotable.\n\nAt the time of getting the Jaws gig, Gottlieb was script editor on The Odd Couple TV series. He and Spielberg were already friends, the two even ended up living in the same place on Martha's Vineyard so they could squeeze every conceivable amount of time they could and dedicate it to honing that script. As a result he'd often be writing content the night before it was going to be filmed the next day.\n\nGottlieb also ended up appearing in front of the camera, as Harry Meadows. It was meant to be a larger part, but Gottlieb edited it down for the good of the film.\n\nGottlieb would be drafted into Jaws 2 and Jaws 3D to help turn those scripts around as well. On Jaws 2 Gottlieb would share screenwriting credit with Howard Sackler.\n\nJohn Milius and Robert Shaw\n\nBoth are widely credited with helping flesh out, Sackler's original idea and indeed edit down and reshape the powerful USS Indianapolis speech that we all know and love.\n\nJaws, as has been well-documented, is one of those films that rather than be blighted by its problems during its making, helped shape it and turn it into a classic. The shark wasn't the only thing that wasn't working, the script wasn't always in the best shape either.\n\nAll which saw several folk have a dabble at one of the films' pivotal moments, Quint's still powerful USS Indianapolis speech.\n\nShow don't tell, so all the scriptwriting books tell you, not so with that speech. Brody and Hooper are as much audience members as we are as Robert Shaw delivers a wonderful performance that is one of the highlights of the film. Not bad for a scene in the cabin of a small boat with three people, no flashbacks.\n\nWe don't need them as the words created are so evocative that they paint a picture all themselves.\n\nBut who wrote it? Original author Peter Benchley had three passes at the script before it was tweaked by Spielberg and Producer, Zanuck and Brown. Then Howard Sackler was drafted in for a redraft followed by John Milius for Quint's USS Indianapolis speech. And then Carl Gottlieb, well that's according to Andrew Yule in his book about Spielberg, Father to the Man.\n\nIf that wasn't complicated enough the aforementioned don't seem to be able to agree quite how the speech came about as we see it in the film. Benchley recalls Shaw claimed he wrote it himself, but heard the Milius rumour.\n\nProducer Brown states whilst Milius added to it, it was written by Sackler but that Shaw added a great deal at the end.\n\nGottlieb is adamant it very much belongs to Shaw who penned an extended version post examining drafts by the other writers. As an award winning playwright and gifted actor it certainly rings true.\n\nSpielberg remembers Milius penning it in front of him with Shaw cutting it down, although Milius says he did it over the phone. It's more like The Usual Suspects of monologues.\n\nIn the book, Nigel Andrew on Jaws, many of the same arguments are had, you certainly get the impression that Milius and Shaw are equally adept at spinning fisherman's yarns about how the ultimate fisherman's yarn came about.\n\nIn that book Spielberg remembers it as being Shaw acting out an eight page Milius speech, which was itself based on a Sackler two pager, with that eight pager thinned out to five by Shaw."
