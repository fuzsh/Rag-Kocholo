        "text": "They set up the predecessor companies which merged to form Daimler-Benz AG in 1926 â Daimler with his Daimler Motorengesellschaft (DMG) and Benz with his Rheinische Gasmotorenfabrik.\n\nAfter working at other companies, Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz, who never met personally, simultaneously developed the world's first automobiles in Mannheim (Benz) and Stuttgart (Daimler) in the year 1886. However, several years lay between the invention of the automobile and its economic exploitation.\n\nThis two-wheeled vehicle, also called \"riding car\", completed a successful test run in November 1885.\n\nBenz, too, recognised the significance of the lightweight engine and set himself the goal of designing a \"dwarf in terms of weight, but a titan in terms of power\".\n\nAs Benz was unable to fall back on existing groundwork, and no solution for the steering of a four-wheeled vehicle had been found up until then, for the time being he concentrated on building a three-wheeled vehicle. The \"Velocipede\" which originated in 1886 can be regarded as the world's first automobile, despite being limited to three wheels.\n\nEarly on, both Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz endeavoured to market their inventions internationally.\n\nUnlike Carl Benz, who initially only had an agent representing him in France, Gottlieb Daimler was able to make use of several foreign contacts.\n\nHe succeeded in concluding licence agreements especially in France and Britain.\n\nAt the 1876 World Exposition in Philadelphia, Wilhelm Maybachhad made the acquaintance of William Steinway and introduced him to Gottlieb Daimler at the end of the 1880s. Following his visit to Cannstatt, Steinway secured himself the contractual right of exclusive representation for the entire Daimler product range in the USA and Canada.\n\nCarl Benz did not manage to forge closer foreign contacts until the end of the 19th century. In addition to Britain, he celebrated surprising successes in the USA and South Africa.\n\nApart from their efforts to gain a foothold in foreign markets, both pioneers pressed ahead with the continuous technical improvement of their products. For instance, Wilhelm Maybach, working as an engineer at DMG, developed the spray-nozzle carburettor, a milestone in the success story of the automobile.\n\nThis innovation represented a major breakthrough in engine design and the principle behind it is still applied to this day. The first major long-distance tours in France and Britain demonstrated the superiority of the petrol engine over its steam counterpart. The outstanding performance of the Daimler engines marked the technical breakthrough for the automobile.\n\nCarl Benz achieved another crucial technical breakthrough in 1893 by inventing double-pivot steering, which solved the problem of steering four-wheeled vehicles.\n\nFrom the very outset, both company founders were committed to the highest quality standards (\"the best of the good\", \"the best or nothing\"), a characteristic of the company to this day. In the period preceding the First World War, despite increasing competition the enterprises founded by the pioneers developed into world-leading manufacturers of passenger cars and commercial vehicles.\n\nAfter 1908 both DMG and Benz & Cie. increasingly built commercial vehicles, though the growth rates in commercial-vehicle manufacture lagged well behind those for car production prior to the war. But as a result, the commercial-vehicle sector developed into an important second mainstay of the companies.\n\nFrom 1888 onwards the internal combustion engine was also used in aviation, initially in airships and then also in airplanes. Although the manufacture of aircraft engines only made a minor contribution to sales before the First World War, it appeared to be a promising business segment. The Mercedes star introduced as company logo in 1909 also indicates this. The three pointed star still stands today for \"mobility on land, on water, and in the air\".\n\nHowever, the outbreak and course of the First World War changed the structure of the two companies' order intake. Private demand was supplanted by state â usually military â orders, which were one of the factors leading to the establishment of the Sindelfingen facility.\n\nProduction at the two predecessor companies was almost totally geared to the needs of a war economy and the troops at the front. As a result, he product range changed fundamentally and had little in common with the peacetime range. The two companies developed into the biggest aero engine manufacturers in Germany during this period."
