        "text": "“It’s also important to remember it’s not about the setting anyway—it’s about the story, it’s always about the story.”\n\nStephen king\n\nOn Writing\n\nToday we’ll look at three well-known movies and see how parts of particular scenes were written from the perspective of settings:\n\nINT. MEMPHIS SUPERHUB–NIGHT–LATER\n\nOur executives work amid the army of EMPLOYEES sorting the rivers of Christmas packages that flow relentlessly into the Hub. Some still have ties on, others have on Christmas hats incredibly complex; the work is demanding, intense. Like “Modern Times”: on overdrive. Above them is a COUNTDOWN clock approaching 00:15:00.\n\nCastaway\n\nwritten by William Broyles, Jr.\n\nINT. GORDON GEKKO’S OFFICE (JOE”S POV) – DAY\n\nFurnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern Art range from field paintings by Art Reinhardt to the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment, hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard Miller World Time Clock, and a world map…\n\nThree of Gekko’s people, young MBA’s dressed for success, are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming in and out.\n\nWall St.\n\nOliver Stone & Stanley Weiser\n\nQUINT’S HOUSE – DAY\n\nBrody and Hooper are approaching Quint’s house. They enter through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell. Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in the air.\n\nDiesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear and conspire to frame the killing floor.\n\nJaws\n\nScreenplay by Carl Gottlieb & Peter Benchley"
