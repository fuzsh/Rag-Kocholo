The film is set in prehistoric times and revolves around the rivalries between cavemen.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAtouk is a bullied and scrawny caveman living in \"One Zillion BC – October 9th\".[4] He lusts after the beautiful but shallow Lana, who is the mate of Tonda, their tribe's physically imposing bullying leader and brutish instigator. After being banished along with his friend Lar, Atouk falls in with a band of assorted misfits, among them the comely Tala and the elderly blind man Gog. The group has ongoing encounters with hungry dinosaurs, and rescues Lar from a \"nearby ice age\", where they encounter an abominable snowman. In the course of these adventures, they discover sedative drugs and fire, invent cooking, music, and weapons, and learn how to walk fully upright. Atouk uses these advances to lead an attack on Tonda, overthrowing him and becoming the tribe's new leader. He rejects Lana and takes Tala as his mate, and they live happily ever after.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRingo Starr as Atouk\n\nBarbara Bach as Lana\n\nDennis Quaid as Lar\n\nShelley Long as Tala\n\nJohn Matuszak as Tonda\n\nAvery Schreiber as Ock\n\nJack Gilford as Gog\n\nEd Greenberg as Kalta\n\nCork Hubbert as Ta\n\nMark King as Ruck\n\nEvan C.

The river and fishing lake scene was shot in the Mexican state of Durango, and some scenes were filmed at the Churubusco Studios in Mexico City. The film features stop motion animated dinosaurs constructed by Jim Danforth,[5] including a Tyrannosaurus Rex which in one scene becomes intoxicated by a cannabis-type drug, animated by Randall W. Cook.[6] Danforth was a major participant in the special effects sequences, but left the film \"about two-thirds of the way\" (his words) through the work because the Directors Guild of America prohibited his contracted on-screen credit, co-direction with Carl Gottlieb. Consequently, Danforth's name does not appear on the film.[7]\n\nThe film's dialog is almost entirely in \"caveman\" language, such as:\n\n\"aiyee\" – help\n\n\"alunda\" – love\n\n\"bobo\" – friend\n\n\"caca\" – shit\n\n\"gluglug\" – drowned\n\n\"guwi\" – out to get\n\n\"haraka\" – fire\n\n\"kuda\" – come\n\n\"macha\" – monster\n\n\"nya\" – no/not\n\n\"ool\" – food\n\n\"pooka\" – broken/pain\n\n\"ugh\" – like\n\n\"ya\" – yes\n\n\"zug zug\" – sex/mate\n\nAt some showings audiences were issued a translation pamphlet for 30 \"caveman words.\"[8] The only English dialog present is used for comedic effect, when it is spoken by a caveman played by Evan Kim who speaks modern English but is understood by none of the other characters. Being a Korean caveman, by speaking English, he appears to be more advanced than the rest. At her audition, Long said she did not speak any English, but responded to everything with grunts.[8]\n\nBarbara Bach and Ringo Starr first met on the set of Caveman, and they married just over a year later.[9]\n\nHome media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was released on Region 1 DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on June 4, 2002. It was then released on February 17, 2015 on Blu-ray Disc by Olive Films.[10]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 21 critics, with an average rating of 4.7/10.[11] On Metacritic the film has a score of 55% based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[12]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 1.5 stars out of a possible 4. The cast was \"interesting\", he wrote, but the main failing of Caveman was it being a spoof with \"no popular original material for it to satirize. There has never been a really successful movie set in prehistoric times.\"[13] Ebert and Gene Siskel both gave the film a negative \"don't see it\" review on their TV show but softened their criticism somewhat by noting that its dinosaur-related sequences were amusing.[14]\n\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was \"dopey, but it's also lots of fun\", and that the real star was the special-effects dinosaur.[15] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker gave it a positive review, calling it \"a funky, buoyant farce.\"[16]\n\nGary Arnold of The Washington Post gave it a mixed review. He was critical with the lack of originality but suggests younger audiences who have not seen it before may enjoy it. Arnold compares the film unfavorably to Three Ages, where Buster Keaton was able to bring his genius, Caveman struggles to overcome Starr's limits and director Gottlieb fails to make use of other talented actors such as Quaid, Schreiber, or Gilford.[17]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of films featuring dinosaurs\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
