        "text": "Danny Woodburn is an actor and comedian and is an activist for the disability Rights Movement. He works on stage, in film and television with 130 TV credits and over 28 film appearances. He is the son of a nurse and a professional golfer, and is a graduate of Philadelphia’s Temple University’s School of Film and Theater and recipient of their Outstanding Alumni Achievement Award. Danny achieved prominence on NBC’s sitcom Seinfeld, performing the role of Mickey Abbott, the volatile but lovable friend of Kramer. His character on Seinfeld was an important role for him, in the sense that the shows writing and portrayal of Mickey is positive and non-stereotypical. Danny has raised awareness of the continued derogatory and dehumanizing treatment of Little People in society and the media. He serves on the Performers With Disabilities Committee of the Screen Actors Guild. He was awarded the DREAM Award by the Disability Rights Legal Center as well as the 2010 Screen Actors Guild Harold Russell Award. He was keynote speaker at the RespectABILITY Conference and the Inclusion Network of Cincinnati, and has been active as both teacher and speaker for The Little People’s Research Fund, Actors For Autism, Media Access, American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and the National ReelAbilities Film Festivals. We are proud to Honor Danny with this year’s “Diversity Award”.\n\nCarl Gottlieb is an American screenwriter, actor, comedian, and executive.

Gottlieb also cowrote David Crosby's two autobiographies,1989's Long Time Gone and 2006's Since Then. Gottlieb was hired as an actor to appear as Harry Meadows, the editor of the local newspaper, in Jaws. He was hired by his friend, Steven Spielberg, to redraft the script, adding more dimensions to the characters, particularly humor. His redrafts reduced the role of Meadows (who still appears in the Town Hall corridor and the Tiger Shark scene). He wrote a book, The Jaws Log, about the notoriously difficult production of the film. Bryan Singer has referred to it as being \"like a little movie director bible\". He was enlisted under similar circumstances to work on the Jaws 2 screenplay. He co-wrote the screenplays for The Jerk, in which he played Iron Balls McGinty, and Jaws 3-D. Gottlieb contributes to Jaws related activities, such as interviews (including the documentary The Shark Is Still Working) and attended JawsFest on Martha's Vineyard in June 2005.\n\nRon Clements began his career as an animator for Hanna-Barbera.

While waiting for his big break, and with a young family to support, Winston began working as an apprentice makeup artist under the head of the Disney Studios makeup department, Robert J. Schiffer. While at Disney, that fascination became a passion and Winston found himself with a new career. Over the next 40 years, Stan Winston led his team of modern-day Renaissance artists as they created one iconic character after another, from Aliens to Predators, Terminators to T-Rexes, Iron Men to Avatars. In return, Winston received ten Academy Award® nominations and won four. He is one of three effects artists in Hollywood history to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One of the preeminent pioneers in modern creature effects history, Stan Winston believed in the “Hybrid” approach – combining robotics, digitally-enhanced makeups, sophisticated puppetry, and CGI, to create fantasy characters that defied the imagination, and truly lived. In addition to his effects work, Winston directed three films, “Pumpkinhead”, “A Gnome Named Gnorm”, and “T2 3-D; Battle Across Time”. In his private life, Winston was a dedicated family man, advocate of education, and philanthropist who sat on the board of directors of Free Arts for Abused Children.

After graduating from Yale University, Winston returned to his father’s workshop to learn CGI in the fledgling SWS digital department.
