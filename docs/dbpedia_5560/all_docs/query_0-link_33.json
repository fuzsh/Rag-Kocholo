Having helped popularize the notion that anyone could be taken by a deep-sea predator, it occurred to me that my obituary might feature the fact that I was killed by a wild animal. Friends were quick to comment: How ironic.\n\nFortunately, the elephant decided not to overturn the Land Rover in which I was riding, no one was gored or trampled, and I survived to tell the tale. Peter Benchley’s genius in telling us the story of Jaws was to give us the shark’s point of view, and the film’s main titles capture the restless predator’s underwater search, while the subsequent reveal of a beach party in progress reminds us that up on dry land, we’re safe to pursue beer and sex and song. It’s when we shed our clothes and enter the creature’s domain that we risk sudden and terrible death.\n\nIf there’s anything to make of this, it’s the simple truth that life is far less structured than narrative fiction, and nothing like the movies. How doubly ironic it is that more people are hit by lightning than are bitten by sharks, although it took an angry elephant to remind me we’re not particularly safe anywhere when we venture into the world of wild animals. And I wasn’t drinking or naked, like poor Chrissy in the movie, who ran out of the firelight and headlong into the dark waters of our collective subconscious fear.\n\nEver since the film was released, fans have been telling me that they didn’t go swimming for a year after they saw the movie. Some have insisted that they were even hesitant about going into swimming pools. How triply ironic, considering that man-eating sharks have never inhabited swimming pools. It’s a tribute to the enduring mythology of the movies that Jaws had this universal effect on audiences who saw it in theaters, where the darkness and the big screen conspire with our imagination to create enduring impressions.\n\nLike most people who’ve earned a living in the popular arts, I wish I knew what the formula is to create an iconic (or ironic) work. The process remains mysterious and unknowable. It’s a tribute to the unique genius of Steven Spielberg that he was able to tap into the world’s collective movie sense often enough to create a series of popular successes (beginning with Jaws) that will probably last for generations. The collaborators who served his vision, myself included, never knew that our simple commercial entertainments would become a part of the world’s common popular culture, although we certainly hope for that most elusive victory every time we enter the lists.\n\nJeffrey Kramer, a young actor and Martha’s Vineyard resident, played Hendricks, the boyish cop who discovers Chrissy’s remains on the beach. I’ve overlooked his contributions in previous editions. He’s gone on to become a well-known television and film studio executive and independent producer. He’s no longer boyish, but it’s never too late to acknowledge him, and also David Axlerod, who (quadruple irony) is referred to in the film in name only, although he’s a perfectly real person.\n\nFinally, an expression of sorrow and regret at the untimely passing of my cousin, the respected publisher and patron of the arts, Paul Gottlieb. He made these new editions possible.\n\nFor myself, I will avoid ill-advised adventures into the domains of dangerous creatures, cherish my contacts with friends and fans of the movies and this book, and look forward to more anniversaries and editions. I remain grateful to those I thanked in the introduction to the previous edition, and will add to future editions unmentioned names as I remember them, or as they are recalled for me. It always helps to have promises to keep.\n\n—Carl Gottlieb\n\nLos Angeles, 2005\n\nIntroductions to the 25th Anniversary Edition\n\nby Peter Benchley\n\nWhen I agreed to write these few words as an introduction to the new edition of The Jaws Log, I saw no need to re-read the whole book. I recalled reading it in 1975 and thinking then that it was an admirably accurate, balanced, and fair account of the making of the movie.\n\nFurthermore, over the ensuing twenty-five years, I had become comfortable with the recollections my personal memory bank had selected and shaped, and I wasn’t interested in disturbing the peace.\n\nI opened the book, prepared to skim through it—just for refreshment, you understand—and was hooked. Instantly. I couldn’t put it down till I had read it straight through to the endnotes and final credits, for I found myself awash in vivid memories of the most astonishing, tumultuous, and momentous months of my life. Back in 1973 and 1974, nobody—myself least of all—knew that we were involved in the birth of a phenomenon that would retain a strange resonance in the culture for a quarter of a century…and in the worldwide debut of a director who would go on to influence the film industry like none other.\n\nAll of us, however, knew that we were witnessing something memorable, exciting, probably unprecedented, and, at times, altogether weird.\n\nThe making of Jaws has been chronicled ad nauseam, in print, on film, audio tape, video tape, laserdisc, and, most recently, DVD. But no one in any medium has come close to being as comprehensive or, more important, as accurate as Carl Gottlieb is in his updated Jaws Log. (In sheer, raw volume, of course, the Internet overwhelms everyone, but it’s unreliable: too many so-called facts go out into cyberspace unchecked and, often, dead wrong. I’m misquoted in the digital ether all the time, often credited with quips and epigrams that were actually uttered by my grandfather, who died in 1945.)\n\nFor me, re-reading Carl’s book was more than merely pleasurable. I’d forgotten how rich it is in detail about the movie business in general and about the appalling odds and apparently insurmountable obstacles that faced the brave souls determined to make Jaws on the open sea. I came away with renewed respect—awe is probably a better word—for the then twenty-six-year-old Steven Spielberg; for Director of Photography Bill Butler; for the incomparable producers, Richard Zanuck and David Brown; for the late and beloved Verna Fields; for Carl Gottlieb himself…and for many of the other characters you’ll meet here.\n\nAt the end of his foreword, while acknowledging the subjectivity and fallibility of memory, Carl says of his story, This was how I saw it.\n\nWell, as far as I’m concerned, this is how it was.\n\n—August, 2001\n\nby Carl Gottlieb\n\nWhen the film was made and this book first written, Jaws was not yet a show business phenomenon and pop culture icon. It’s axiomatic in the entertainment industry that no one can tell in advance and with any degree of certainty what constitutes a hit. In an era of mass marketing, product testing, audience research, and $20 million opening-weekend media buys, we still can’t tell the audience what they like. When the last ticket’s sold and the last kernel of popcorn is swept up, they tell us.\n\nOn the macro-economic scale, Jaws made film history as the highest-grossing movie of all time, and established a business model and release pattern for large-scale summer movies that persists to this day. On the micro-esthetic scale, it was one of the happiest collaborations of my career. Steven Spielberg’s innate and preternatural talent for understanding audiences and his genius for making movies was not yet common knowledge; we had him to ourselves before he was a global resource. I only regret that memory is an overcrowded storage medium that loses crucial information and recollects personal experience imperfectly at best. I’m in my anecdotage, and I can’t entirely remember how much fun I’ve had. What remains available still gives me pleasure to recall and enjoyment to relate.\n\nFailure is an orphan, success has many parents. Over the years, Jaws has attracted fanatic fans, fierce critics, and more than its share of rumor and conjecture. Journalists recycle old and inaccurate material, participants suffer from selective memories, and almost everyone connected with the picture has been interviewed, photographed, consulted, recorded, and featured in documentaries, official and unofficial. The information available is still fragmentary and occasionally contradictory.\n\nWhen I collaborated with David Crosby on his autobiography, my research into his personal history would occasionally conflict with his memory of events. Most of the time, he’d graciously concede that a preponderance of the evidence supported an alternative view of how things happened. A few times, he’d bark, It’s my life, and I’ll remember it the way I want to. That’s how the text of that book (and this one) were finally written.\n\nJaws was my life in 1975, and I remember it the way I want to, because I worked directly from my hand-scribbled notes, based on live interviews with the players who were there, as I was. The text reflects the reality that existed then. Movies, like most art forms, embrace a heightened reality. Creating or revising a screenplay, freedom is absolute. I’m free to drop or combine characters, change their age, sex, individuality, personal history, motivation, the circumstances of their birth, the manner of their death. The narrative is flexible, events are arbitrary, and the writer dictates the weather, the flavor of food, the size of the fish, the age of the wine. Or not, depending on budget, time, which sets are already built, which actors are cast, what the director wants to shoot, what the producers and studio think they want to see, and what’s actually out there when the cameras finally roll.\n\nReal life is far less organized than movies. In Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, my old sergeant used to warn us troops about the perils of civilian life: There’s two hundred million people out there just walkin’ around, he’d say ruefully. And there ain’t nobody in charge. Writing non-fiction is like that—it carries an obligation to some sort of objective reality, however imperfectly perceived. There are a lot of facts out there with no one in charge. Therefore, I’ve left the original narrative intact, except for minor spelling changes and a few stylistic fixes.\n\nWhich is not to say that I haven’t learned anything since 1975. Twenty-five years is enough time for retrospection and receiving new information, so I’ve added endnotes to the text throughout. These are updates, factual corrections, and personal asides motivated by candor, pique, and impulse. The endnotes are intended to bring the reader up to date on the whereabouts and circumstances of key members of the cast and crew. In this regard, the World Wide Web was my most complete source of talent credits. I’m thankful for the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com), for its comprehensive and generally accurate list of credits. I can recommend it to anyone who wants to know everything about the people who made Jaws: the above-the-line talent (writers, director, producers, and actors) and key below-the-line personnel (production managers, assistant directors, cinematographers and camera persons, production designer, etc.). I’m also grateful to members of the online community for their interest, and for putting up and maintaining the many unofficial Web sites dedicated to Jaws and its sequels; many of them are listed in the endnotes. You guys are amazing!\n\nTo the crew that supplied immeasurable assistance, support, and encouragement in the writing and production of this edition, I’d also like to express my deepest appreciation: Marcia Jacobs, Kelli Maroney, Alex Simon, and Allison Caine Gottlieb, who was there then, and was of great help this time around. My cousin Paul Gottlieb, a publisher himself, always believed in this book and urged me to retrieve the rights. In the end, he acted as my agent and actually sold the project, so he’s earned every penny of his commission, as well as my many, many thanks.\n\nI am also beholden to Esther Margolis, a patient and talented publisher, for this edition. Her company, Newmarket Press, is an invaluable resource, both for authors and for audiences interested in movies. Keith Hollaman edited the new edition happily and well, and Nancy Cushing-Jones, Bette Einbinder, and Thomas Meissnest at Universal facilitated the use of Lewis Goldman’s photos.\n\nEveryone remembers things his or her own way, and suggestion and repetition inevitably affect recollection. If some people can confidently express false memories of ritual satanic abuse, the cast and crew and witnesses to Jaws can certainly disagree as to who did what and with which and to whom during the summer of 1974 in Martha’s Vineyard and Hollywood.\n\nThis was how I saw it.\n\n—August, 2001\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nSome Introductions Are in Order.\n\n(June 1971–December 1972)\n\nThe shark can locate its prey several ways: he can smell blood from miles away, and he can sense vibrations in the water (as Peter Benchley points out in Jaws):\n\nA hundred yards offshore, the fish sensed a change in the sea’s rhythm…running within the length of its body were a series of thin canals, filled with mucus and dotted with nerve endings, and these nerves detected vibrations and signaled the brain…\n\n—Jaws, Chapter 1\n\nRichard Zanuck and David Brown are Hollywood producers; although not filled with mucus, they are certainly dotted with nerve endings, and just as the great white shark can sense erratic vibrations of a swimmer in the water, so can Richard and David sense the movement of a literary property in the publishing world. They are not sharks, and they are not predators, but they are sensitive, and Jaws was still an unpublished manuscript at Doubleday when the vibrations created by its progress signaled the Zanuck/Brown Company that Something Was Up.\n\nBoth men have explained to me that they have private sources in the publishing world, and they are not alone in this. Studios and producers are always on the lookout for a marketable property, a book or story that appears attractive enough to justify the expense of transforming it into a film script, and popular enough to justify the further colossal expense of making it into a theatrical feature film where $100 million are at stake, and where the intense collaborative process of creation can occupy months, or years, before a finished film can be released.\n\nBe assured that whenever you read a work of popular fiction or light storytelling, it has been studied and analyzed by a number of people who are professionals at the acquisition of literary properties. If you say to yourself, This would be a terrific movie, chances are it may be, or at least someone has bought the rights to try and make it so.\n\nPublishers routinely send copies of books while still in prepublication galley proof form to studios and major producers, looking for a movie sale, because they share in the proceeds of those sales. That’s why when you buy a popular paperback, it frequently has the additional exhortation (or warning) Soon to Be a Major Motion Picture. Many of these become Minor Motion Pictures, and still others become no motion picture at all, because someone guessed wrong, and the property became unpackageable, meaning that no important stars or directors or screen adapters would commit their services to the story within the time needed to make it.¹\n\nJaws all began in June 1971, when Peter Benchley delivered a four-page outline of a proposed novel to an interested editor at the New York publishing house of Doubleday. Peter’s pages and a favorable editor’s memo were circulated in-house, and enough editorial support was gathered to justify the issuance of a contract request for Peter; that request was approved by a publishing board, and after a little stiff negotiating, the contract was approved and entered into by both parties. The contract, according to The New York Times, called for delivery of the first four chapters by April 15, 1972. It also called for a payment of $1,000 to Peter for his efforts, and the promise of a regular, larger advance if Doubleday decided to go ahead and do the whole book.\n\nAfter revisions, rewrites, deadlines, and rewrites, Peter’s book was finished and the final draft delivered in January 1973. During this period of internal preparation, the book about a shark got its title, Jaws, and a release date (autumn), as well as a massive assist in the form of a paperback book sale.\n\nAt this point, Peter, for having written a whole"
