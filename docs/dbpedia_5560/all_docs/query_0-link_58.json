        "text": "When I was growing up in Oklahoma, I took great pride, pleasure and encouragement from reading about fellow Oklahomans who had succeeded in Hollywood especially since I had wanted to be an actor from a very young age. I guess I've always been reluctant to blow my own horn, preferring to let my work speak for itself. Perhaps my competitiveness was peaked when I read that Randy Staley may be Midwest City's biggest Hollywood success story.\n\nI'm a big booster of Oklahoma, so here goes.\n\nI graduated from Midwest City High School in 1957, in the first class of graduates to attend the Midwest City school system for their entire 12 years of schooling. My mother worked for the school system, managing several school cafeterias over the years, including the old Post Elementary School we attended in old barracks on Tinker Air Force Base.\n\nIn high school I teamed with Daryl Bristow, now a very successful lawyer in Houston, to win the Oklahoma state debate championship in 1957. I was also voted \"best actor\" at Midwest City High School that year.\n\nI went on to the University of Oklahoma for four years, then drifted a bit from my desire to act. I worked as a disc jockey for KOCY, then moved to Dallas, where I had a very successful radio show for six years. I began working as a nightclub comedian in Dallas and soon toured the Playboy Club circuit.\n\nIn 1970, I finally made it to Hollywood, where I did several Steve Allen shows and a couple of variety specials, then a 12-city tour opening for Jose Feliciano.\n\nI joined an improvisation theater group called \"The Committee\" in 1970. That group included Howard Hessman, Peter Bonerz, Barbara Bosson, Hamilton Camp, Carl Gottlieb and others.\n\nMy first professional acting job was the original Dodge Challenger commercial featuring the southern sheriff. I was the young fellow he stopped for driving a \"racing car.\" Over the next six years, I did about 30 commercials and 10 to 15 voice-overs for commercials. I was doing feature and co-star work on TV and films during this period, but in order to move on, I quit doing commercials in 1976.\n\nSince then, I have had 45 or 50 guest-starring roles in TV and 15 film roles.\n\nI have also been an active writer for several years, having written for TV's \"Welcome Back Kotter,\" \"Hizzoner\" and \"Horshack.\" I also write screenplays and have sold five, three of which have been produced. One is now available in video cassette \"Loose Shoes,\" starring Bill Murray. I have written a screenplay for Mel Brooks that is now being considered for production by Universal Films.\n\nMy most recent major film was \"Splash.\" This month, I will start work on John Candy's new movie, \"Armed and Dangerous.\" Also coming up this spring and summer are guest-starring roles in a two-part episode of \"Different Strokes\" and \"Hollywood Beat,\" a series that will soon return to the air.\n\nI have been divorced for the past 15 years but have a son who just graduated from Clemson University. When I was a kid, I used to usher at the OU football games as an Explorer Scout. Actually I only belonged to the Scouts so I could usher.\n\nI still am uncomfortble writing about myself but .... Mom, I hope you're satisfied. Also, I hope my success can help someone there who is thinking they would like to have a career in the arts. It can be done.\n\nRoyce D. Applegate,\n\nHollywood, Calif.\n\nP.S. Say something nice about my mother, Dorothy, and my recently deceased father, Roy. They deserve it. They exemplify all that Oklahomans stand for, a great, giving heart. Also I have a brother, Ron, who is a successful attorney here in Los Angeles. He graduated from Midwest City High School in 1960.
