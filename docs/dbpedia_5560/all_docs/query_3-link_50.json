With apologies to Independence Day, we went with Jaws!\n\nThis movie is kind of a miracle.  At the time, it was one of the most troubled productions in film history.  Due to a combination of bad weather and mechanical shark failures, the 55-day shooting schedule extended into a 159-day series of escalating debacles.  The crew constantly referred to it as “Flaws,” and nobody believed the 26-year-old director would keep it from being anything but a regrettable mess that would end his career.  Of course, Jaws became such a commercial success and cultural phenomenon that it transformed the movie industry.  Its director, Steven Spielberg, did just fine for himself as well.\n#AlohaLibrary #WCCLS",

The Twilight Zone ended a few years earlier, and this was his follow-up. With both shows, he served as the creator, head writer, and host. Each Night Gallery episode was an hour-long and contained two or three short, self-contained stories. Steven Spielberg directed one of the segments in the very first episode, which says something about the level of confidence the producers had in him. His story, called \"Eyes,\" starred screen legend Joan Crawford as a blind woman who is given the ability to see... but only for 12 hours on one night. The return of her vision happened to coincide with the New York City blackout, so again, she is stuck with darkness. As the sun comes up the next morning, she knows she has missed her opportunity, and jumps out the window of her high-rise apartment. Yep. Before filming began, Spielberg went to meet Crawford at her house. Here is his description of what happened when he arrived. \"She assumed Universal had hired a substantial, veteran director to direct her. Someone of her stature. Nobody had told her I was 21 years old at the time. I walked into the room, and there's Joan with bandages around her eyes, flailing her arms and stumbling through the room knocking things over, saying 'Steven is that you? You're gonna love this. I learned how to get around without seeing. I'm getting into character.' Lamps are falling over, the telephone came off the hook and fell with that terrible ring. She was kicking over cords and knocking over trash buckets. It was brutally funny. I didn't know whether to laugh or turn around and go back to film school. She finally walked over to me and undid her wrappings and looked at me and almost screamed.\" It's hard to blame the production team for not telling Crawford. Bette Davis was originally cast in the role but backed out after she discovered Spielberg's age. Show less\n\nSpielberg also directed the very first episode of Columbo.

He hung out and shared ideas with Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and Brian DePalma. They were a tight clique, but Spielberg stood alone as someone who wasn't looking to revolutionize anything. His path was linear and within the system. He went from TV to a made-for-TV movie to feature films. Duel was that TV movie. It's about a guy who is menaced on the highway by a semi-trailer truck with a driver we never see. It has many similarities to Jaws, and Spielberg later said there is a \"kinship\" between the two movies because they are about \"leviathans that target the Everyman.\" In Duel, the truck's windshield is dark enough that it gives the impression of what Quint would later describe as the black eyes, \"a doll's eyes,\" of the shark in Jaws. This early work of Spielberg's had deep personal resonance beneath all the specifics related to trucks and sharks. He said, \"My early themes all had the underdog being pursued by indomitable forces... and a lot that came from the insecurities I felt as a kid. I was always the kid with the big bully. Duel was my life on the schoolyard.\" Show less\n\nSpielberg directed one big-screen film before Jaws - Sugarland Express, a true-crime road movie (really, a chase movie, and there's that theme again) star...Show more Spielberg directed one big-screen film before Jaws - Sugarland Express, a true-crime road movie (really, a chase movie, and there's that theme again) starring Goldie Hawn in one of her few dramatic performances. It didn't make much of a splash. On the whole, critics were lukewarm and the public was indifferent. However, Pauline Kael, the extremely influential film critic for the New Yorker saw Spielberg's talent and potential. She wrote, \"He could be that rarity among directors - a born entertainer... In terms of the pleasure that technical assurance gives an audience, this film is one of the most phenomenal debut films in the history of movies.\" Show less\n\nThe bestseller that was the basis for the movie.

Peter Benchley wrote the first draft of the screenplay, which was much closer to the book. Before Gottlieb started his revisions, Spielberg sent him a copy of that draft along with a note that said: \"Eviscerate it.\" Spielberg also had the good sense to allow the actors room for improvisation that would lend the movie a natural, realistic feel. Robert Shaw (who played Quint) was something of a ringer because, in addition to being a world-class actor, he was a respected author of novels and plays. Although the most famous line in the movie, \"You're gonna need a bigger boat,\" was improvised by Roy Scheider.

Most movies are artificially clean in their sound design. We usually just hear the characters that are meant to be the center of our focus, or there might be a backdrop of indiscernible noise that's relevant to the setting they are in. Jaws is more true to life, more dynamic. In scenes like the one where Hooper argues that the freshly-killed shark on the dock is not the same shark that has been terrorizing the beach, we hear characters talk over each other and the chatter that is all around them. That was a trademark of director Rober Altman. Nashville is probably the purest example of an Altman film, though his previous work (especially M*A*S*H, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, and The Long Goodbye) make extensive use of that technique.

Jaws's impending danger refrain has much more in common with Bernard Herrmann's score in Psycho than the music Williams would later write for Spielberg. The entire Jaws score is terrific, but it's particularly interesting to contrast it with the light, fanciful, and rousing music that's usually associated with his compositions for Spielberg.

Williams noted, \"When the shark is far away it's very faint. When the shark is just about to attack it's very close and it's very loud. We can advertise the shark's presence or his attitude by how we manage these notes - just very few notes.\" Show less"
