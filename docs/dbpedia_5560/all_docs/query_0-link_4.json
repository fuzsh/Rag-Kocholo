        "text": "Carl Gottlieb is a multifaceted American talent renowned for his contributions as a screenwriter, actor, comedian, and executive. Best known for co-writing the iconic screenplay of “Jaws” (1975) and its first two sequels, Gottlieb’s impact extends beyond the realms of cinema.\n\nHis journey in the entertainment industry began with a focus on comedy writing for television, earning him an Emmy Award for his work on “The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.” His comedic touch also graced shows like “The Music Scene,” “The Bob Newhart Show,” and “All in the Family.” Additionally, he made notable appearances in TV series like MAS*H and the film “Clueless.”\n\nA pivotal moment in Gottlieb’s career came when he collaborated with Steven Spielberg on “Jaws.” Not only did he co-write the screenplay, injecting it with depth and humor, but he also took on the role of Harry Meadows in the film. His experiences during the challenging production became the subject of his acclaimed book, “The Jaws Log,” considered a movie director’s bible by industry professionals.\n\nGottlieb’s involvement extended to the sequels, with him returning to pen the screenplay for “Jaws 2” and “Jaws 3-D.” His influence on the Jaws legacy persists, as demonstrated by his participation in documentaries like “The Shark is Still Working” and engagements with dedicated fans at events like JawsFest.\n\nBeyond his work with Spielberg, Gottlieb co-wrote David Crosby’s autobiographies, showcasing his versatile writing skills. Engaged with the Writers Guild of America since 1968, he delved into Guild politics and served as a board member, displaying a commitment to supporting fellow writers. Carl Gottlieb’s enduring impact on the entertainment industry is marked by his diverse talents and lasting contributions to cinematic classics."
