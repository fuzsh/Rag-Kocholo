        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Family Guy scribe David Goodman has defeated Jaws screenwriter Carl Gottlieb to become the WGA West’s new Vice President. “David Goodman’s a good guy, and he’s good for the guild,” said Gottlieb, the guild’s long-serving Secretary-Treasurer who will be succeeded in that post by Aaron Mendelsohn, who ran unopposed. “I know he’ll represent television writers with an intimate knowledge of their problems.”\n\nResults of the guild’s presidential election and board races have yet to be announced.\n\nGottlieb, who had served in elective office longer than anyone at the guild, served three terms as Vice President, two terms as Secretary-Treasurer and 22 years on the board of directors. “I’m hoping that there will be some weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth,” Gottlieb laughed. “And that’s just on David Goodman’s side.”\n\nGottlieb will continue to serve on the guild’s waiver committee and on its podcast supervisory committee — if that’s any consolation for a lifetime of dedication to his union."
