The Europapark train station in Groningen only opened in 2012, but a redesign is very much needed.

The biggest changes coming to the station will be the construction of an extra track and a new platform. Currently, there are three tracks between the main station and the location of the new train yard at De Vork in Haren, and a new track will be needed due to an increase in the number of trains running along the route.

OOG TV reports that trains from Leeuwarden will also serve the station in the future, and trains from Delfzijl and Europapark will travel through the station en route to Veendam and Weener.

According to the Groninger Internet Courant, a new, covered platform will also be created for the new track next to the current station. The platform will be on the Helperzoom side and will be accessible via a staircase and a lift.

The existing platform at the station will also be extended by 30 meters to accommodate the longer trains serving the station in future. All of the existing tracks will be moved slightly as part of the construction works.

Most of the work on Groningen Europapark station will take place on weekdays during the day. The train time tables should remain largely the same during the construction works, with a few exceptions.

Work is set to start after the summer vacation and is predicted to last until May 2020. The train yard in Haren and the renovated Groningen Europapark station should be back in normal use by the summer of 2020.
