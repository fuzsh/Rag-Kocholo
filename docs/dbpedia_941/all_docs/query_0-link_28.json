        "text": "In the city center you can park for a quick errand; maximum half an hour. Follow the P route if you want to use the underground car parks in the center. Of course you can stay there longer. You can also park your car a short distance from the center and continue your journey by bus. The P+R bus takes you to the city center and back. Parking is free and a P+R ticket only costs 6 euros (max. 5 people).\n\nIn the bus\n\nTraveling with the OV chip card is usually the fastest and cheapest. On many routes you pay less with the OV chip card than with a bus ticket. You can now also purchase some tickets online via Q-buzz. This way you can easily order a Day ticket, P+R ticket or Dal-Day ticket. You then scan the barcode on the E-ticket on the bus. You can either print it out or scan it digitally. A single ticket on the bus can only be paid with a PIN/credit card, cash is no longer possible.\n\nOn the train\n\nTraveling by train is also the cheapest and fastest with the OV chip card. A single ticket for your train journey is a one-time OV chip card. You can buy this at the ticket machine at the train station. Or you buy an e-ticket at NS. You can go to ticket machines to buy regional and national train tickets and to top up and pick up OV-chipkaart products.\n\nYou can rent bicycles at various places in Groningen. Public transport bicycles can be rented at Central Station, Groningen North Station and Groningen Europapark Station. You can also rent a bicycle at P+R Hoogkerk and P+R Kardinge. At many stations in the province it is possible to rent an OV-fiets. For other rentals you can go here:\n\nFiets & Service Groningen\n\nStationsweg 13\n\nTel: 06 53149416\n\nBikes in Groningen\n\nSint Jansstraat 25\n\n+31 (0)6 24515546\n\nPims fietsen\n\nWesterkade 24\n\n+31 (0)50 750 1402\n\nTrendEwheels Groningen\n\nSchuitendiep 2\n\n+31 (0)50 851 1532"
