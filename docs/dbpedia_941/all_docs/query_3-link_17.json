Generally, you are entitled to compensation when you have a delay of 30 minutes or more for domestic trains, and 60 minutes or more for international trains. However, there are some exceptions. In some cases you might receive compensation when you have a delay of only 15 minutes or more.\n\nSee compensation for delayed or cancelled trains for more information about your passenger rights, all conditions and the exact details about your compensation. Good to know: this service was operated by NS. Missed connections might not be compensated if your journey involved NS and another company.\n\nPunctuality for this train\n\nNext to each station, you'll find some basic statistics about this train's punctuality at this station.\n\nThis is based on the performance of this train in the past 14 days. The percentage of trains which have departed or arrived on-time includes all trains which had a maximum delay of 4 minutes and 59 seconds. Cancelled trains are not considered as on-time trains.\n\nMany more statistics about this train are available in our statistics section.
