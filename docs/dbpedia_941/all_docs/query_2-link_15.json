        "text": "For other places with the same name, see Groningen (disambiguation).\n\nGroningen is a lively student city in the Northern Netherlands. It is the capital of a province with the same name and home to about 217,000 inhabitants (2023), making it the largest city in the north. A university town with some 50,000 students gives the city its famous vibe; a pleasant youthful atmosphere, some fine historic heritage and with plenty of things to do.\n\nThis article includes the former municipality of Haren, with which Groningen merged in 2019.\n\nUnderstand\n\n[edit]\n\nArchaeologists have found traces of habitation from the Neolithic and the later Iron Age. The city appeared in writing in the year 1040 as \"Villa Cruoninga\", apparently already a place of some significance. The city has a rich history, which can be seen clearly from the Medieval buildings in the downtown area.\n\nIn the 13th century, when the city was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a city wall to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its dialect a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of Friesland was administered from Groningen. During those years, the Martini Tower was built, which loomed over the city at (then) 127 m tall, making it the highest building in Europe at the time. The city's independence came to an end when it chose to join forces with the Spanish during the Eighty Years' War in 1594. It was later reconquered, and joined the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.\n\nIn 1614, the University of Groningen was founded for religious education. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That city wall was tested during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, when the city was attacked fiercely by the Bishop of MÃ¼nster, Bernhard von Galen. The city walls resisted, an event which is celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"Groningens Ontzet\" or \"Bommen Berend\").\n\nThe city did not escape the devastation of World War II. In particular, the main square, Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945, during the Battle of Groningen, which lasted several days. However, the Martinitoren, its church, the Goudkantoor, and the city hall were not substantially damaged.\n\nNowadays the city of Groningen is nationally renowned for the university, the museum and its vibrant atmosphere. 50% of the citizens are below the age of 30, making this the youngest city in the country. For decades, the bicycle has played a central role in the lives of people in the city, and today accounts for no less than 60% of all traffic movement with more bikes than citizens.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe temperate climate is pleasant in Groningen, without extremes due to its coastal climate. Due to its location in the north of the Netherlands, during winter the average temperatures of this city are slightly lower than the average of the rest of the Netherlands. Snow and freezing temperatures are common in the winter but rarely last more than a few days. 30Â°C in the summer is not exceptional. Most average daytime highs in summer are around 22Â°C. Daylight hours run from 05:15 - 22:00 in the summer months to 08:45 - 16:15 in the winter.\n\nTourist office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tourist Information Wall at Groningen Airport Eelde provides information flyers about the city and its surrounding area in Dutch, English, German and Polish.\n\nGet in\n\n[edit]\n\nBy plane\n\n[edit]\n\nGroningen is served by\n\nGroningen is also easily reached by direct train (2.5 hr) from Schiphol Airport, which has far more direct connections than Groningen Airport.\n\nTo travel between the airport and the city:\n\nBus 9 runs twice per hour between the airport and city. The journey to the centre takes approximately 40 minutes. â‚¬5 one way, tickets can be purchased from the driver, or use the OV-chipkaart. Not all line 9 buses go to the airport, but this is clearly stated on the digital rollsigns. You can no longer buy bus tickets with cash. Make sure you have a card valid in the Netherlands (Maestro is best) or be ready to negotiate with the driver.\n\nBus 100 is a special shuttle bus to and from the airport starting at the Central Station, but only around the Copenhagen, Brussels, Munich, London and Gdansk flights. Besides Central Station, bus 100 also stops at the main down town places and hotels (including Hampshire Plaza Hotel in the southern part of the city), and the academic UMCG Hospital. This bus trip takes about 20 minutes from the Central Station and costs â‚¬5 one way, tickets at the driver.\n\nTaxis are not always available at the airport. If you wish to travel by taxi, book in advance. A taxi to the city will cost you â‚¬25-30.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nBy Dutch standards, it's a fairly long way from the major destinations in the western Netherlands. Getting here, however, is not hard. Groningen has three train stations, the central station ( , often called 'Hoofdstation'), and . All trains eventually arrive at the central station; only a few trains stop at the smaller stations. Tickets for all train journeys can be purchased at the train station or online at NS.nl.\n\nThere are two trains departing from Groningen Station to southern destinations like Amsterdam and Rotterdam every hour. One train terminates in The Hague and the other train terminates in Rotterdam. The train towards The Hague also calls at Amsterdam South Station and Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Station. Amsterdam Central Station can be reached with one change at Almere. Brussels and Paris can be reached with one change at Schiphol Airport Station. A regional line operated by Arriva runs west to Leeuwarden three times per hour. Some popular destinations include:\n\nCityDurationPriceTransfer Leeuwarden 0:34â‚¬10.05 Direct Zwolle0:57â‚¬17.70Direct Utrecht1:54â‚¬24.70Direct Amsterdam2:00â‚¬25.50Direct Arnhem2:04â‚¬23.90Zwolle Schiphol Airport 2:11â‚¬25.80Direct Bremen2:35â‚¬35.20Leer Rotterdam2:37â‚¬26.30Direct Eindhoven2:58â‚¬26.30Utrecht Brussels South3:50Price variesSchiphol Frankfurt5:12Price variesArnhem\n\nTrain service between Leer (Germany) and Groningen is replaced by a bus service until around 2020 due to a ship crashing into a bridge on the rail line in 2016. You can either take a direct bus (55 min, every 2 hours), or take a bus to Weener then a train to Groningen (1 hr 30 min, every hour).\n\nCommuter trains, all operated by Arriva twice per hour, run towards Uithuizen/Roodeschool, Appingedam/Delfzijl, Winschoten and Veendam.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main bus station is right next to the central train station. At the bus station you can find a wide range of city buses and lines to virtually all large and small destinations in the region, and direct buses to Emmeloord, via Heerenveen and Lemmer.\n\nFlixbus operates a couple of domestic intercity bus lines from Groningen. Line 821 runs to Hengelo and Enschede and line 822 runs to Apeldoorn, Arnhem, Nijmegen and Eindhoven. These bus lines leave at P+R Haren (near Postillion Hotel) and opposite the central train station, at the other side of the road. Booking in advance is cheaper. The buses are in most cases cheaper and faster than making the same journey by train.\n\nInternational buses\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several direct buslinks to Germany and Belgium operated by German carriers. For example to Bremen, Oldenburg, Hamburg, Berlin, Antwerp, Brussels and Leuven (starting at â‚¬9, one-way) by Flixbus.\n\nDestinations in Belgium, France and England are reachable with one transit in Amsterdam. Destinations in Sweden require a change in Copenhagen. It is not possible to book a domestic journey. Ecolines operates a bus line towards Warsaw and stops en route to Poland in some German cities like Bremen and Berlin.\n\nAll international bus lines leave opposite the train station. Book a day in advance to get the lowest fare.\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nA myriad of roads lead to Groningen, making the city well reachable by car. The major highways are the A7 (west-east) and the A28 coming from the south. Several fine N-roads connect to the city from nearby destinations, and are the way to go further north. The most notable ones are the N360 from Appingedam and Delfzijl, and the N361 north, direction of Winsum.\n\nDriving in the old city, particularly within the central canal ring, is not the best option. Parts of town are car-free, there are many one way roads, parking is not always easy to find, and none of it is free. You can, however, park for free overnight at IKEA (a 5 minute cycle from downtown).\n\nThere are several Park & Ride facilities around Groningen. At these facilities you can park your car for free and take a fast and frequent bus to Downtown for a small amount. One of the biggest facilities is on Sontweg, to the east of the city and near Ikea. It is clearly marked when driving on the ring road. Parking there is free, and for â‚¬2 (one way) or â‚¬5 return for 5 people, a regular bus service takes you right to Downtown. If you come from the direction of Assen (south), the Park & Ride facility Haren is your best option. From the west, from direction Drachten, P+R Hoogkerk is on your route. If you are coming from Germany you can park at \"Kardinge\". Follow the road to \"Eemshaven\" and take the exit \"Kardinge\". All P+R facilities are clearly marked on the motorways.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most cities in the Netherlands, Groningen's historic city center is surrounded by a canal, the diepenring. Most of the sights are within this area, and the Central Station is 50 m outside it, and the museum built in it.\n\nWithin the diepenring, traffic is very restricted; Groningen's centre is designed to be as traffic-free as possible, and it is very difficult to drive and park within this area. Even resident parking permits are strictly rationed. However, the central area is compact and can be easily crossed on foot or with a bicycle.\n\nFurther out, Groningen has a loosely connected ring road, consisting of several N-roads forming a rather square ring shape around the centre. The city sprawls somewhat and crosses this ring in places, but most of the population live within this area.\n\nBy bike\n\n[edit]\n\nCycling is the best way to travel around. Getting from any place in Groningen to the centre will take at most 20 minutes. This makes the bike a fast, cheap and easy way to travel in Groningen. Don't get scared by the overwhelming number of bicycles. The city houses tens of thousands of students, whose primary means of transportation is the bike. Bicycle theft is pretty high. Most bikes have one lock, but it is best to use a good second lock (preferably a strong chain lock for least â‚¬30).\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nIf you don't have a bike, the bus is the best option for distances you don't want to walk. All buses run through (or end on) Central station. Most buses have a stop at the Grote Markt square (central downtown). The major bus lines are listed below. Tickets are available from the driver (during off-peak periods you can buy a Eurokaartje, cost â‚¬2.50) or use the OV-chipkaart for payment. The Central Station is listed as bus stop \"Hoofdstation\" in and on buses and on bus stops. As mentioned earlier, buses no longer accept cash. Bring a card that works in the Netherlands (Maestro is best) or be ready for disappointment.\n\nQ-Link\n\n[edit]\n\nQ-Link is a group of 5 bus services which are air conditioned, have a WiFi connection, and run from city destinations to places just outside the region. One exception for line 15 which is a student express line to Zernike.\n\nLine 1 runs from the Central Station to the Zernike/Zuidhorn, via Grote Markt, Noorderplantsoen and Paddepoel.\n\nLine 3 runs from Lewenborg to Leek via Kardinge, Grote Markt, Central Station and P+R Hoogkerk.\n\nLine 4 runs from Beijum to Roden via Kardinge, Grote Markt, Central Station and P+R Hoogkerk.\n\nLine 5 runs from station Europapark to Annen via UMCG Hospital, Grote Markt, Central Station, P+R Haren and Zuidlaren. Sometimes this bus terminates at P+R Haren, so make sure Zuidlaren and Annen are mentioned if you travel this way.\n\nLine 6 runs from P+R Haren to Ten Boer/Delfzijl via Central Station, Zuiderdiep, UMCG Hospital and Ruischerbrug.\n\nLine 15 is a student express service from Central Station to college campus Zernike. It is just north of Paddepoel and line 15 runs via Rembrandt van Rijnstraat and Paddepoel. These buses are very crowded in the morning to Zernike, and in the afternoon back to the Central Station. This route does not run in weekends.\n\nSee\n\n[edit]\n\nDowntown Groningen is pleasant and interesting. The city centre provides plenty of cultural heritage and a laid-back atmosphere. Together with the excellent Groninger Museum, it forms the main attraction for visitors.\n\nLike many cities in the Netherlands, the centre is surrounded by a canal. Several historic canals have been \"gedempt\", or filled, however, and turned into streets. This is reflected in their names, and you'll likely find yourself strolling along the Gedempte Zuiderdiep. The heart of the city is formed around the two adjoining market squares, The Grote Markt (or Great Market) and the Vismarkt (or Fish Market). Standing tall on the edge of the Grote Markt is the Martini Tower, a true landmark for Groningen and one of its main attractions.\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nWarfare left hundreds of buildings in ruins in 1945, but a good number of monuments remain. Strolling through the city centre you'll encounter former canal warehouses, the city hall, several churches, the former Gold Office and many other historic buildings. The city has, with success, attempted to find a balance between modern architecture and historic grandeur. The latest initiative is a major renewal of the eastern side of the Grote Markt.\n\nTypical Dutch architecture is the Amsterdamse School, a style of architecture that arose from 1910 through about 1930 in Amsterdam. The Amsterdam School movement is part of international Expressionist architecture, sometimes linked to German Brick Expressionism. While Amsterdam has the most buildings in this style, Groningen also has some wonderful edifices, and sometimes called the northern capital of Amsterdamse School. at Parkweg in the lovely Grunobuurt district and at Gedempte Zuiderdiep 96 are worth walking along.\n\nThere are a number of special architectural skyscrapers. The Kempkensberg is a 25-storey high-rise building in the south of the city and is commonly called 'The Cruiseship' by locals. The Gasunie Building is considered to be a great example of an â€˜organic buildingâ€™, situated on the edge of the Stadspark.\n\nMuseums\n\n[edit]\n\nAs in many cities in Europe, Groningen's museums are generally closed on Mondays.\n\nHistoric heritage\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the historic heritage can be found within the ring of canals. The most visited tourist attraction is without doubt the Martini Tower, but there is much more to see in Groningen: old canal warehouses, guesthouses, typical Dutch gables and beautiful gardens. Probably the most characteristic streets of the city are the . These two streets run along the A canal and are known for the dozens of national heritage sites, in particular the outstanding warehouses from the Middle Ages and a 17th century brewery named 'Batavia'.\n\nScattered through the city centre are several late-medieval Guest Houses (Gasthuizen). During daylight hours these picturesque courtyards can be visited for free. The houses are not open to the public: the people living in them enjoy their quiet and privacy. Access is through gated doorways that will be unlocked during daylight hours and locked during the evening/night. The largest and oldest one is the courtyard of the , located in the Pelsterstraat, next to the Pelstergasthuis church. The Guest House consists of several courtyards connected through archways. In the Peperstraat, near the end on the left when viewed from the Poelestraat, is the . The Peper Guest House was founded in 1405. Part of the medieval city wall is still visible from the courtyard. At the tourist information is a city walk available through many courtyards.\n\nOther important heritage listings are:\n\nParks & sculptures\n\n[edit]\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nFootball: FC Groningen were promoted in 2024 so they play soccer in Eredivisie, the top tier. Their home ground Euroborg (capacity 22,500) is 2 km southeast of city centre.\n\nCycling\n\n[edit]\n\nGroningen is a cycling city par excellence. The inhabitants of Groningen possess an average of 1.4 bikes per person. The city features the highest cycling rate for anywhere on the planet; almost 60% of journeys are by bike. Groningen is arguably the world's best cycling city. 40 years ago the local government made a radical choice to ban the car from the centre of the city to increase liveability in the city. Since then, cycling has evolved into the new normal. Some cycling features:\n\nBikes everywhere\n\nA bunch of guarded bike stalls across the city\n\nFree way for cyclist with the many cycling lanes\n\nPriority on roundabouts\n\nShared space with pedestrians in quieter and narrower streets\n\nTraffic lights with rain sensors to give quicker priority to cyclists on wet days\n\nTraffic lights that go green for all bikes from all directions (has to be seen at rush hour to be appreciated!)\n\nBicycles are available for rent at a number of places around town like , (only e-bikes), and (carrier bikes!). Bikes are also available at the Central Station with the OV-Chipkaart. Many hotels offer bike rental to their guests, usually for fees of roughly â‚¬10 or less per day. Renting an electric bike is a little more expensive, but a lot of fun and very interesting for longer trips outside the city. Bike maps are available at the tourist information centre. Use the map to explore the city and the surrounding areas or follow a signposted cycle route using the Dutch cycle junction network[dead link].\n\nThere is also a possibility to discover the city's highlights with a 2Â½-hour . You have to book this tour in advance. Departure from May through October every Friday at 14:30 and Saturday at 10:30.\n\nRelaxing\n\n[edit]\n\nPaterswoldsemeer lake\n\n[edit]\n\nLocals love to spend their leisure time at Paterswoldsemeer south of the city, and cool down on hot days. On windy days sailors and surfers find their way to the lake. It is also popular with cyclists and joggers. There are beaches, marinas, boat rentals, restaurants, and accommodations. Rental sail boats and canoes are available at the is the place to be if you want to rent a boat or canoe. , at the north-western corner of the lake, is a lovely location for a drink with lakeview.

Supermarkets are generally open from 08:00-22:00.\n\nDowntown area\n\n[edit]\n\nAll streets within the central canal ring are low traffic due to restrictions - but watch out for cyclists, who don't often pay attention to pedestrian crossings. The Herestraat, the city's longest pedestrianised shopping street, runs south off the Grote Markt and contains most of the city's everyday shopping needs and 'standard' Dutch clothing stores and chains. This is where you'll find Hema, Blokker, C&A, Zara and so on. The Westerhaven, at the western edge of the centre, houses some big stores like Media Markt and Primark.\n\nOther shopping streets extend out from the Grote Markt and the Vismarkt.

For example 'Droppie', a store selling typical Dutch liquorice.

Many people are selling their second hand or hand-made goods during the Dutch national holiday. It is a large market and the vibe is superb. The market's location is the Singels between the central railway station and the city centre.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal specialties\n\n[edit]\n\nA typical 'Groninger' specialty is Groninger worst, a sausage made from raw minced pork which is then air dried. You can buy this sausage in every supermarket and butchery. When visiting a snackbar, you should try a eierbal. The eierbal is a ball-shaped croquette, filled with veal and a whole egg. The eierbal is seen as the Groninger variant of the Dutch croquette.\n\nThe Netherlands is known for its cheese. Groningen has some typical Dutch cheese stores:\n\nThis page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink: BudgetUnder â‚¬15 Mid-rangeâ‚¬15-30 SplurgeOver â‚¬30\n\nGroningen continues the 'simple and straightforward' cuisine that the Netherlands is known for.

There are also several places to play pool/billiards. Most bars have the standard Dutch beers, but more and more international, especially Belgian, beers are beginning to have a presence. Bars in the down town area do not have fixed closing hours. Theoretically they can stay open for 24 hours a day, which a few bars do.\n\nThe largest nightlife area in Groningen is the Poelestraat area, located southeast of the Grote Markt. Here you'll find a lot of clubs and bars.
