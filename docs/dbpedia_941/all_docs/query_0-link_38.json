        "text": "A fire that started in a building that’s under construction next to Groningen’s central train station disrupted train traffic to and from Groningen.\n\nGroningen’s fire department said they got called out to the fire at around 09:10 on Wednesday morning. Soon after, an emergency alert was sent to the phones of residents living close to the city centre as the fire was producing a lot of smoke. Residents were advised to stay indoors and to close their windows. A significant presence of smoke in the air is expected to last at least until noon.\n\nTrain traffic was severely disrupted due to the fire. Arriva and NS deployed buses between Groningen and Groningen Europapark to transport passengers. Intercity trains heading towards Groningen are ending their journey in Assen. Trains to Delfzijl, Roodeschool, and Leeuwarden appear to be largely unaffected.\n\nShortly before 11am, NS was estimating that the train schedule would return to normal at 12:30."
