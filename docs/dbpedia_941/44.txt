Urbastyle was responsible for the benches, the concrete stairs, the copings and the wall cladding of the stairwells of the Groningen Europapark station.

The Groningen Europapark station is a suburban stop with buildings around the station squares. The appearance and quality had to serve as a driving force for the further area development of the Europapark district. The polished concrete steps, wall copings, benches and wall cladding match the quality of the look and feel. All elements in architectural concrete have the same concrete mix based on green aggregates. In the concrete stairs contrasting white round natural stone elements were cast-in for people with visual disabilities. Wall cladding and copings were installed on the walls next to the concrete stairs. Europapark Station was elected the most beautiful building of 2013 during the annual Day of Architecture in the Netherlands.
