Topher Grace is burning the midnight oil for “Kids in America,” a pic following one night in the lives of a group of recent college grads.

Brian Grazer is producing the film for Universal Pictures through Imagine Entertainment, after Grace and producing partner Gordon Kaywin pitched their idea to the shingle. Michael Dowse, whose first pic was laffer “It’s All Gone Pete Tong,” was recently brought aboard to helm and pen a script.

Grace is attached to star, while he and Kaywin will exec produce.

“Kids” follows an aimless college grad who pursues his dream girl at a wild Labor Day weekend party. He, his twin sister and their best friend struggle with their burgeoning adulthood over the course of the night.

Grace, who recently finished his run on TV skein “That ’70s Show,” will next appear onscreen in “Spider-Man 3.” His other film credits include “In Good Company.”

Dowse helmed and wrote “Pete Tong,” which follows a DJ who climbs to dance club stardom before drug and alcohol abuse cost him his hearing. Pic won the best Canadian film kudos at the 2004 edition of the Toronto Film Festival.

Imagine’s upcoming projects include “American Gangster” for U.
