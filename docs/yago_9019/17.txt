About the film[]

The film was written by the writers of That '70s Show and follows the adventures of recent college graduate Matt Franklin (Topher Grace), his twin sister Wendy (Anna Faris), and his best friend Barry Nathan (Dan Fogler) as they attempt to come to a conclusion about what they should do with their lives. Matt also pursues his dream girl Tori Fredreking (Teresa Palmer) at a wild Labor Day party in 1988, by telling her that he works for Goldman Sachs when he actuality works at Suncoast Video.
