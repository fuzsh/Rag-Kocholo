        "text": "‘8-Bit Christmas’ Review – Second Opinion\n\nby Chris Cummings\n\nStars: Neil Patrick Harris, Winslow Fegley, Steve Zahn, June Diane Raphael, Che Tafari, Sophia Reid-Gantzert, Santino Barnard, Max Malas, Brielle Rankins, Braelyn Rankins, Cyrus Arnold, Chandler Dean | Written by Kevin Jakubowski | Directed by Michael Dowse\n\nWe all know by now how popular the 80s are in modern day. The nostalgia of the past is a huge selling point in media, be it video games, books, TV shows or, indeed, movies. Well festive film 8-Bit Christmas follows suit as the adult Jake Doyle (Neil Patrick Harris) tells his daughter the story of child Jake Doyle (Winslow Fegley) and his attempt to get hold of a Nintendo Entertainment System back in the 80s. The film is told with Harris’s narration on top, for the most-part, in a flashback style. Reminiscent of A Christmas Story, we hear about Jake’s life back then, his friends, the bullies in town, the outrage of parents regarding video games, and his parents.\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse (Stuber) with a screenplay penned by Kevin Jakubowski (Play by Play), 8-Bit Christmas is a nostalgic film indeed, and manages to capture some of that excitement of being a kid again and staring obsessively at the shelves of the toy stores.\n\nI mentioned the iconic Christmas picture, A Christmas Story, earlier, and I must make mention of it again here. This movie seemed to very-much be inspired by it. The tone and voice-over narration, as well as the general set-up and layout of Jake’s childhood suburbia, is extremely similar to A Christmas Story, but Jake Doyle wants a Nintendo, not a Red Ryder BB gun like Ralphie. 8-Bit Christmas is all-too obviously inspired by the Bob Clark classic.\n\nHomage or not, this is a fun movie to watch at this time of year and is able to create a snapshot of a world long since passed. A world with Cabbage Patch Kids and Nintendo Power Gloves, a world with tree-forts and no internet, where phones were hung on walls and not glued to everyone’s hands. It was a different time, and for those of us who grew up back then, it’s cool to see a portrayal of it on screen from time-to-time.\n\n8-Bit Christmas is festive, breezy fun with enough heart to push it along. It isn’t groundbreaking and won’t likely be looked back on as a classic, but there’s enough here to make it worth a watch, especially for those who like to see that magnificent decade honoured on screen. Unlike the Nintendo Power Glove… this is actually worth bothering with for 97 minutes."
