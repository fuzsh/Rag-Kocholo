        "text": "We won’t lie. This is a mish-mash of leftover films. Not least anticipated, not fervently most anticipated. They are The Escapist (and umm, other films) that didn’t quite fit in our other previous lists. They’re a mix of indies that we’re hoping to have quality performances in them and more traditional action-y, popcorn flicks that could be quality because of the directors or talent involved. You’ll just have to read a little deeper to see how we feel about each. In case you missed it, here’s part one.\n\n“The Cold Light of Day” – Summit – dir. Mabrouk El Mechri\n\nSynopsis: A cocky young Wall Street trader is thrust into a government conspiracy when his family is kidnapped on vacation in Spain.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: With a script by Scott Wipter (“The Wire“) and John Petro, the film will mark the American debut of French-Tunisian helmer Mabrouk El Mechri, who has the interesting and entertaining Jean Claude Van Damme crime-comedy “JCVD” on his resume (a film that both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino both loved). This latest film has a solid leading trio of stars in Henry Cavill, Bruce Willis and Sigourney Weaver, but more interestingly, will see Weaver play a villainess (originally written for a male actor) who takes on the father-son duo of Cavill and Willis.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“The Son of No One” – TBD – dir. Dito Montiel\n\nSynopsis: A young cop is assigned to the neighborhood where he grew up and soon runs into an old secret which threatens to destroy his life and family.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: With his career trajectory steering in the right direction, Channing Tatum squeezed in this latest crime-cop-thriller — a reunion with Dito Montiel, who directed him in “Fighting” and “A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints” — between exciting, upcoming roles in Steven Soderbergh‘s “Haywire” and Kevin Macdonald‘s “The Eagle.” Featuring Al Pacino, Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini, Katie Holmes, Juliette Binoche and curiously enough, Tracy Morgan, who looks set for a significant gear change having replaced Terrence Howard as Tatum’s best friend, the story was described by Tatum as “psycho” and “nuts.” Hopefully being chosen as the closing night film at Sundance is indicative of its quality.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“What’s Your Number?” – 20th Century Fox – dir. Mark Mylod\n\nSynopsis: Ally (Anna Faris) has a life changing discovery — she has slept with twice the national average of people — and decides to track down these exes in hopes of finding her one true love, alongside her sleezy neighbor (Chris Evans).\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Yes, we weren’t too thrilled with the script, claiming that it “falls into formula in a way that the likes of “Knocked Up” managed to avoid” and that “it’s essentially a standard rom-com… with more uses of the word vagina.” However, two small glimmers of hope arrived after the original announcement in the form of Andy Samberg and Joel McHale. It’ll probably be a very by-the-numbers movie no matter what and stick very closely to the script, but Faris is always a joy to watch and hopefully Samberg and McHale outweigh the unexceptional “Captain America.”\n\nRelease Date: April 29, 2011\n\n“The Change-Up” – Universal – dir. David Dobkin\n\nSynopsis: A married man switches bodies with a friend in order to woo a younger co-worker.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: The body-swap comedy has been ticking along for years now, but it’s surprising, considering the post-Apatow boom in the R-rated comedy, that we haven’t seen a really filthy one, as the premise seems to lend itself to the archetype. But along comes “Wedding Crashers” director David Dobkin, aiming to wash away the stink of “Fred Claus” by teaming with “The Hangover” writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore for this, which sees Jason Bateman swap bodies with the so-hot-right-now Ryan Reynolds so he can cheat on his wife (Leslie Mann) with Olivia Wilde. The raunchy comedy credentials are fully in place, but Dobkin and the writers have patchy track records and the premise seems a little, well, rape-y. We’ll see.\n\nRelease Date: August 5, 2011\n\n“Machine Gun Preacher” – Lionsgate – dir. Marc Forster\n\nSynopsis: A former drug-dealing biker tough guy who finds God becomes a crusader for hundreds of Sudanese children who’ve been kidnapped and pressed into duty as soldiers.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: A mullet-wearing Gerard Butler starring in an action film about a drug-dealer-turned-religious-crusader? We know it sounds like a joke but we assure you, it’s not. Marc Forster is at the helm with Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon also starring, which brings it up a notch but at the end of the day, the tone of this film could make or break it. Forster’s eclectic resume with efforts like “Monster’s Ball,” “Finding Neverland,” “Stranger Than Fiction” and “Quantum of Solace” should help this rise above the average actioner… we hope, ‘Solace’ was ungood to say the least.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“The Lincoln Lawyer” – Lionsgate – dir. Brad Furman\n\nSynopsis: Ace defense attorney Mickey Haller defends a young playboy against rape and murder.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Fans of crime and legal thrillers have been waiting for the Michael Connelly-created Mickey Haller to make his big screen debut. With Matthew McConaughey stepping into the lead role of the legal maven who operates out of the backseat of the titular vehicle, it’s up to director Brad Furman to keep the novel’s page-turning tone from spinning out of control on screen. Ryan Phillippe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy and Michael Peña firm up the supporting players in what we hope is a decent popcorn muncher and not just an extra long episode of “Law & Order: Los Angeles.”\n\nRelease Date: March 18, 2011\n\n“Goon” – TBD – dir. Michael Dowse\n\nSynopsis: A bouncer joins a rag-tag hockey team and inspires them to greatness.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Written by Jay Baruchel with Evan Goldberg (who co-wrote “Superbad” and “Pineapple Express” with Seth Rogen) and directed by Michael Dowse (“Fubar,” “It’s All Gone Pete Tong”), we have high hopes that this hockey comedy will be a solid entry in a genre with few too many titles (basically “Slap Shot” and that’s about it). The cast is led by Seann William Scott (who got tired of waiting around for Kevin Smith’s gestating hockey movie “Hit Me”) and Jay Baruchel, and features a solid supporting cast in Alison Pill, Marc-Andre Grondin, Liev Schrieber and Eugene Levy. On-ice and off-ice shenanigans await and we hope this one delivers the goods with style.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“The Details” – TBD – dir. Jack Aaron Estes\n\nSynopsis: An already difficult life of a struggling married couple is further complicated by ravenous raccoons burrowing under the sod in their back yard which sparks disagreements that catalyzes a chain reactions of mishaps.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Set as a quick indie film for Tobey Maguire to shoot before he got to work on “Spider-Man 4”….well, we all know how that turned out. Anyway, this one still got made and as you might guess, it’s a very high concept comedy. Our hope for this lies in the cast that also stars Elizabeth Banks, Ray Liotta, Kerry Washington and Laura Linney. The film marks the sophomore feature effort by Jacob Aaron Estes who directed the much more sober and somber “Mean Creek” way back in 2004.\n\nRelease Date: TBD, premiering at Sundance\n\n“Cabin in the Woods” – MGM– dir. Drew Goddard\n\nSynopsis: A tongue-in-cheek send-up of horror film cliches, notably the “spooky old house in the woods” as personified by Sam Raimi’s “Evil Dead” films.\n\nWhat You Need to Know: The film was co-written by genre mastermind and future “Avengers” ringleader Joss Whedon and “Cloverfield”/”Lost” writer Drew Goddard (who also directed). It’s been stuck in limbo for what seems like eternity now, first because studio MGM wanted to convert the movie into 3D, and then because MGM went tits up and god knows what’s going on with the completed movies currently left to be distributed (“Red Dawn” remake, we’re looking in your direction). Although plot specifics have largely been kept under wraps, with these two wiseacres behind the knobs and a cast that includes Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, “Thor” himself Chris Hemsworth and Whedon alums Amy Acker and Fran Kranz, it should be a good ole time at the movies.\n\nRelease date: TBD, depending largely on when MGM gets its shit together, though it sounds like that’s finally coalescing.\n\n“A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas” – Warner Bros. – dir. Todd Strauss-Schulson\n\nSynopsis: Now in their 30s, Harold and Kumar (Kal Penn, John Cho) have parted ways on bad terms. A chance encounter and an unfortunate mishap send them on another unpredictable journey, this time during the holiday season. And in 3D.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Sure they’re stupid (can’t you argue that all comedies are?) but the previous two films were also great fun. Thankfully this one sounds a bit more grounded than the second picture (though admittedly we misread “nude showering nuns” as “a shower of nude nuns” and lost a little excitement) and Vulture, after reading the script, basically said that its fanbase will be pleased. Maybe the only concern would be director Todd Strauss-Schulson, one that we’re not familiar with but is credited for movies “Naked But Funny” and “Big Pussy,” which, if anything, don’t sound very promising. That said, so long as creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg didn’t pick raunchy directors out of an Ed Hardy hat, the series should be in good hands.\n\nRelease Date: TBD Winter 2011\n\n“Elephant White” – TBD – dir. Prachya Pinkaew\n\nSynopsis: A mercenary in Thailand finds new a new meaning to life when he befriends a local 14-year-old girl.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: The storyline about an English-speaking adult befriending a 14-year-old Thai girl certainly sets off a few sensors. But aside from that, Djimon Honsou getting a chance to stretch his action hero chops (with Kevin Bacon, presumably as a baddie) seems like a can’t-miss proposition when paired with Pinkaew, who brought verve and visual wit to “Ong Bak” and “The Protector.” Though he has two very commercial leads, Pinkaew is working entirely with a Thai cast and crew, and if his other movies are anything to go by, that means lots of extras getting the crap beaten out of them and thrown out windows, off buses, and out of planes.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“The Courier” – TDB – dir. Hany Abu-Assad\n\nSynopsis: A courier hired to deliver a briefcase to a crime lord finds himself the target of cops and criminals.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Producers and directors seem intent to make Jeffrey Dean Morgan ‘happen’ even though we already have Javier Bardem and Clive Owen, so here Morgan tries out a potential “Transporter” franchise. Still, there’s something about this that doesn’t feel that low-rent. For one, the script is by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, the scribes behind “Wanted” and the very underrrated “3:10 to Yuma.” There’s also able support from Mickey Rourke and Til Schweiger. And finally, the direction of Hany Abu-Assad, the director behind award winning suicide bomber drama “Paradise Now.” It’s more than enough info to pique our curiosity.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Machotaildrop” – TBD – dir. Corey Adams, Alex Craig\n\nSynopsis: A young skater yearns to join the world’s most popular (and most eccentric) skateboard company, Machotaildrop.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: We weren’t quite sure what to make of this when the trailer arrived in our inbox last spring. It first looked like one of those eccentric advertisements you only see before trailers at movies where some minor brand name hired an out-of-the-way marketing company to hawk their brand. Eventually, we got a vibe that was essentially Gyorgy Palfi’s “Napoleon Dynamite.” Like “Dynamite,” “Machotaildrop” seems to exist in a land that time forgot, with fashions of today and yesterday mingling with self-consciously outre grooming and wardrobe decisions. What does this mean? Who knows. It premiered to bewildered audiences at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, so we’re still not sure (some compared it to… “The Prisoner”?) but whatever it is, we’d like to see what it all means.\n\nRelease Date: TBD, still making the festival circuit.\n\n“Red Lights” – TBD – dir. Rodrigo Cortés\n\nSynopsis: A psychologist and her assistant who study paranormal activity leads them to investigate and try to debunk a world-renowned psychic.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: After his Ryan Reynolds-led man-in-a-coffin film “Buried” came and went this year, Rodrigo Cortés quickly put together his next effort; a psychological thriller with a strong cast in Cillian Murphy, Sigourney Weaver and Robert De Niro. It remains to be seen how Cortes goes with a film that has more than one actor and one setting — we sure hope he doesn’t waste this cast — but touting Weaver up against De Niro sounds like a fascinating on-screen showdown.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Winnie the Pooh” – Disney – dir. Stephen J. Anderson, Don Hall\n\nSynopsis: Pooh Bear and his friends reach the silver screen once again.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: We got a little misty-eyed when we saw the trailer. Alright? Did you need to know that? Well now you do, jerk. This is said to be based off a few original stories from the A.A. Milne books, and utilizing hand-drawn animation definitely seems to be a nice way to re-acclimate us to a simpler time when cartoon characters weren’t spouting off rap lyrics or wearing shades or stabbing their parents and setting their houses on fire. We just described a DreamWorks film, didn’t we? Probably. Bad sign: why is Disney throwing this to the wolves by putting it out on the same day as the last ‘Harry Potter‘?\n\nRelease Date: July 15, 2011\n\n“Fright Night” – Disney – dir. Craig Gillespie\n\nSynopsis: A teenager become convinced that his sinister new neighbor is a vampire, and turns to a Las Vegas magician who claims to be a vampire expert for help.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: A remake of the beloved 1985 horror classic, this is the rare remake that has a decent chance of surpassing the original. Director Craig Gillespie is coming off the well-handled “Lars and the Real Girl” and there’s a decent script from “Buffy the Vampire Slayer“/”Mad Men” veteran Marti Noxon. Stars Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots are two of our favorite rising talents, while Colin Farrell should be good value as the bad guy, and David Tennant is long overdue for a breakout role, and should shine as the flamboyant Criss Angel-style illusionist. If we can get over our vampire fatigue, we can see ourselves having fun with this one. Does it really need to be in 3D though?\n\nRelease Date: August 19, 2011\n\n“Happy Feet 2” – Warner Bros. – dir. George Miller\n\nSynopsis: The son of original lovebirds Mumble and Gloria struggles to find his personal talents amidst the new dangers in the Emperor Penguin world.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: The cast returns (save for Brittany Murphy, with Pink taking over) in what certainly sounds like a huge retread of the first film, even if the logline is particularly vague. That said, the original was a charming surprise, full of heart and gorgeous animation, not to mention an awful lot of tear-jerking scenes and mature moments, so if it is anything like the first it should be worth a watch. It also should be noted that Miller was behind the Tom Waits-approved “Babe: Pig in the City,” which was a radical departure from its predecessor and featured many dark elements. Don’t be shocked if the “Mad Max” director goes into this with the same attitude.\n\nRelease Date: November 18, 2011\n\n“Spy Kids 4: All the Time in the World” – Dimension – dir. Robert Rodriguez\n\nSynopsis: A new beginning for the series, twins Rebecca and Cecil reluctantly join their stepmother (Jessica Alba) in a battle against the evil Timekeeper (Jeremy Piven).\n\nWhat You Need To Know: These movies have always been known for their playful castings (Sly Stallone was cast as four different characters in “Spy Kids 3,” case closed), and this is no different with Piven as the villain and Joel McHale as the oblivious father character. Even though they’re aimed at children (and disregarding the shamelessly ugly third entry), the series has been known to have plenty of action and dazzling special effects that impress even the most reluctant theater-goer, and this should prove to be no different… so long they don’t enter a video game filled with CGI that would give the Sega Saturn clout.\n\nRelease Date: August 19, 2011\n\n“The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” – Fox Searchlight – dir. John Madden\n\nSynopsis: An Indian executive who sees a gap in the market when he notices that a lot of elderly folk in the U.K. are farmed out to dismal retirement developments and he decides to convert an old guest house in Bangalore.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: A venerable cast come together for Fox Searchlight’s clear entry into next year’s award race in what they hope will be another “Slumdog Millionaire” global success with Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Dev Patel, Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy all on board for the ride. But we have some serious reservations with this one. East meets West stories can often lead to patronizing and insulting humor (NBC’s “Outsourced”) or a bunch of white people finding wisdom in those oh-so-mystical foreign ways. What we don’t need is an “Eat Pray Love” for the retiree set which is why something like this is cautiously anticipated and not on our Most Anticipated list. But the cast on board promises to at least bring some dignity to the proceedings and Fox Searchlight is now one of Oscar season’s mightier players so we can’t count this one out just yet.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Hop” – Universal – dir. Tim Hill\n\nSynopsis: An unemployed slacker accidentally runs over the Easter Bunny, and has to take him home while he recovers.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: This live action/animation hybrid is led by Russell Brand as the rockin’ rabbit and co-stars James Marsden, Chelsea Handler and “The Big Bang Theory” star Kaley Cuoco. And normally, it’s the kind of thing that would have us running for the hills, particularly with “Alvin and the Chipmunks” director Tim Hill at the helm. But Illumination Entertainment made a solid debut with “Despicable Me,” the script’s from the very funny Brian Lynch, Marsden and Brand are an appealing pair, and the teaser trailer was actually quite charming. We’ll need to see more, certainly, but this could be one of the more bearable kids’ flicks in a fairly unpromising year for the genre.\n\nRelease Date: April 1, 2011\n\n“Hesher” – TBD – dir. Spencer Susser\n\nSynopsis: The story of a loser twenty-something who invades the life of an awkward 13-year-old living with a pill-popping father and grandmother.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Joseph Gordon Levitt as the titular Hesher/loser twenty-something? One would think that’s worth the price of admission alone, but add to that Natalie Portman and Rainn Wilson as the “pill popping father” in this indie-comedy: we were originally colored very intrigued. However, this directorial debut of Spencer Susser — who helmed a Sundance favorite short, “I Love Sarah Jane,” which featured Mia Wasikowska — was met with almost unanimous shrugs and even jeers at Sundance 2010. There’s been little word of an interested U.S. distributor and the film might need an overhaul or a second film festival run before anyone decides to fork over the dough to screen it in theaters.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Sympathy for Delicious” – Maya Entertainment – dir. Mark Ruffalo\n\nSynopsis: A paralyzed DJ on the streets of L.A. acquires through faith-healing the ability to cure the sick and crosses paths with a Jesuit priest (played by Ruffalo) who helps him come to terms with his gift, as well as a rock singer (Orlando Bloom) who tries to expolit the suddenly famous healer.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Originally set for a 2009 Sundance premiere, Ruffalo’s directorial debut eventually landed at Sundance 2010 with some of the worst reviews of the festival (and yet it still managed to win the World Jury Prize). Co-starring Juliette Lewis, Laura Linney and John Carrol Lynch, the film was scored by Montreal indie-rockers The Besnard Lakes and featured music from Shiny Toy Guns and Mars Volta lead singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala, who acted as a musical stand-in for Bloom’s singer character. Still, none of this was enough to appease critics and yet, surprisingly (or maybe not surprisingly) Maya Entertainment — who trade in the type of low-rent indie film you’ve never heard of — picked the film up for distribution in the fall of 2010.\n\nRelease Date: A Spring 2011 date was reported in November, but there’s been no concrete frame set yet.\n\n“Last Night” – Miramax – dir. Massy Tadjedin\n\nSynopsis: Monogamy is challenged. A married couple (Keira Knightley and Sam Worthington), spend a night apart; the husband takes a business trip with a colleague (Eva Mendes) to whom he’s attracted. While he’s resisting his temptation, his wife encounters her past lover (French actor Guillaume Canet).\n\nWhat You Need To Know: A film that features Sam Worthington and no explosions or bullets? Isn’t this impossible? This is the directorial debut of the screenwriter behind “The Jacket” (psychological film with Knightley and Adrien Brody) and “Leo” (a Southern gothic-type film with Elisabeth Shue and Joseph Fiennes) and it played festival dates this year to modest if not particularly exemplary notices. We’re mildly curious. Maybe just for the fact to see what it’s like to watch Sam Worthington act next to things that aren’t green screen puppets. That said, when Miramax went belly up, Disney finally sold it to a hedge fund investment group — Filmyard Holdings — (The Weinstein Company are co-members) and now they’ll use this year to figure out what to do with all their films. Might take a while.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“The Debt“- Miramax – dir. John Madden\n\nSynopsis: A shocking rumor throws the lives of three retired Mossad agents, considered heroes for their assassination of a Nazi war criminal, into turmoil, exposing a love triangle and a dark secret.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: A remake of the 2007 Israeli film of the same name, we were pleasantly surprised when we read the script to this — it’s by writing team Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (“Stardust,” “Kick-Ass“) and it’s certainly the best thing they’ve written. Part thriller, part dark romantic drama, the cast is pretty high caliber, with Sam Worthington, Marton Csokas and hotly-tipped young star Jessica Chastain playing the young agents, and Ciaran Hinds, Tom Wilkinson and Helen Mirren playing their older equivalents. It’s a great role for Mirren, and we’re interested how Worthington fares away from the big-budget sci-fi that’s been his calling card so far. However, early reviews on this one have been mixed and John Madden ‘s record in thrillers is patchy as the brutally terrible “Killshot” evinced, but there is enough talent here to keep us curious.\n\nRelease Date: Originally scheduled for a December 29, 2010, sometime after the Toronto International Film Festival in September, but when Disney sold Miramax, everything became TBD (see “Last Night” for more info)\n\n“The Killer Elite” – TDB – dir. Gary McKendry\n\nSynopsis: An ex-Navy SEAL has to come out of retirement to save a friend in danger.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Jason Statham. Clive Owen. Robert DeNiro. It’s hard to find a cast that testosterone-y. The idea of Statham and Owen as ex-mates in the Navy tickles us in that it makes perfect sense to see them fighting back to back. Considering the pedigree, this could be an opportunity see Statham break heads and act, which we think he can actually manage. Add to this a decent supporting cast of bruisers including Dominic Purcell, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and the wiry Ben Mendelsohn of “Animal Kingdom” and, cast alone, this sounds like something we’d want to see.\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Blitz” – Lionsgate – dir. Elliot Lester\n\nSynopsis: A rogue London policeman must team with a by-the-book, openly gay colleague to track down a psychotic killer who’s targeting officers from their station.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Ordinarily, a film where Jason Statham played a cop who doesn’t play by the rules would find itself firmly on our Least Anticipated list. And the trailer for “Blitz” didn’t exactly endear itself to us. But this one has a finer pedigree than, say, “The Transporter” or “The Mechanic.” It has a script by Nathan Parker (“Moon“), from a book by acclaimed crime novelist Ken Bruen, and the cast around Statham is terrific — Paddy Considine as the gay cop, David Morrissey, Luke Evans and “The Wire” star Aidan Gillen as the killer. It looks a little bit TV, to be honest, but hopefully music video helmer Elliot Lester will bring some cinematic flair to the material, and we suspect the trailer’s playing up the action elements to appeal to a wider crowd than the dark material might otherwise attract.\n\nRelease Date: June TBD\n\n“Snow Flower and the Secret Fan” – Fox Searchlight – dir. Wayne Wang\n\nSynopsis: A cross-generational drama that explores the female friendships between two girls in 19th Century China and the modern day.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: The film stars Bingbing Li and Jeon Ji-hyun and is based on Lisa See‘s novel of the same name about a “laotong” relationship — one “made by choice for the purpose of emotional companionship and eternal fidelity.” Yet, despite the strong literary backing, the film will probably makes headlines for one reason: Hugh Jackman cameos as a club owner and will sing a Country Western song (which he previewed on ‘Leno‘ one night). Zhang Ziyi was originally set to star as well but dropped out as a result of the long, gestating production of Wong Kar-Wai’s “The Grand Master.”\n\nRelease Date: TBD\n\n“Gnomeo & Juliet” – Touchstone – dir. Kelly Asbury\n\nSynopsis: Two unfortunately named garden gnomes fall in love and find themselves struggling to overcome the feuds of neighbors.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: So it’s not Pixar, it’s not DreamWorks, and it seems to blatantly ignore the fact that adults will probably have to see this with their kids. All that in mind, a trailer can only convey so much, and it may be a lot more silly and complex than the marketing device lets on — who knew “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” was going to be that good? Voice work by Patrick Stewart, Hulk Hogan and Ozzy Osbourne is also a very pleasing prospect.\n\nRelease Date: February 11, 2011\n\n“Ten Year” – TBD – dir. Jamie Linden\n\nSynopsis: A group of friends approaching or at their 30s who reunite 10 years after college.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Put simply, this is sounds like an indie, non-cookie-cutter addition to the ensemble rom-com genre which has taken over of late (“Valentine’s Day,” the upcoming “New Year’s Eve“). Rising star Channing Tatum is producing this and also brought on board his “Dear John” scribe, but it’s the cast they’ve assembled which promises better things: his real-life wife Jenna Dewan, “The Hurt Locker” co-stars Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, as well a Rosario Dawson, Kate Mara, Justin Long, Chris Pine, Lynn Collins, Chris Pratt, Anna Faris, Oscar Isaac and Scott Porter.\n\nRelease Date: TBD"
