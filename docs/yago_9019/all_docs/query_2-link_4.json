        "text": "Kids In America : A Teen Comedy\n\nThe website was created to promote the movie, Kids In America. This page has been created from content from the site's archived pages. Do you remember where you were when this movie was first released? Did you see it in a movie theater or later when it was available on a DVD. I happened to see it in a NYC theater with a group of friends. We Batman clothes themed that night, just to be a bit atypical from the rest of the teen audience but completely onboard with the cultural impact of Batman t shirts and other Dark Knight gear. Since the weather was beginning to turn cooler, I decided to wear one of my fashionable Batman hoodie styles which I had just bought at a very cool online site. The e commerce store is organized not only by image, but also by product to make browsing easier. I just clicked on their \"hoodies\" pic and boom there are all the selections. They also break down the hoodies by image categories so if you wanted a hoodie with a Batman logo or other signal they are easy to find. I wore a DC Comic design called Sketchy Shadows featuring a black and white sketch of Batman on his knees with skeleton shadows in the background. Some wise kid in the audience yelled when he saw the group of us in our Batman hoodies, t-shirts and sweatshirts that we were at the wrong movie. But we just ignored the idiot. Wearing Batman clothing certainly invited a lot of opportunities to engage with other moviegoers. They were all curious about our sartorial choices.\n\nBased on real events, Kids In America is a teen comedy about a diverse group of high school kids who band together to peacefully kick their principal's ass. Boasting an impressive cast of both established stars and hot new talent, \"Kids\" tackles such issues as sex education, freedom of speech, and how to kiss for six minutes straight without losing consciousness from lack of oxygen.\n\nHolden Donovan (Gregory Smith) is fed up with Principal Weller (Julie Bowen) who goes to great lengths to stop the students from exercising their right to free expression. She expels a young woman for passing out condoms and advocating safe sex on national “safe sex” day and suspends two boys who were kissing in the hallway. Meanwhile, she is running for the Superintendent of their school district, which will give her a chance to practice her brand of administration beyond Booker High School.\n\nThe students have an ally in Mr. Drucker (Malik Yoba) one of their teachers who encourages them to fight for their rights. He pays a price for his leadership and is fired by Principal Weller. He decides to use his dismissal to make a change of his own, by producing a documentary chronicling the experiences of students who are faced with similar issues.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Donovan befriends a group of kids including love interest Charlotte (Stephanie Sherrin), Lawrence, Chuck, Walanda, Emily and Katie. Together they organize the student body to take on Weller and make real change at Booker High.\n\nRating: PG-13 (for sexual content, mature thematic elements and language)\n\nGenre: Documentary, Comedy\n\nDirected By: Josh Stolberg\n\nWritten By: Andrew Shaifer, Josh Stolberg\n\nIn Theaters Oct 21, 2005 Limited On DVD: Mar 7, 2006\n\nBox Office: $0.4M\n\nRuntime: 1 hr. 29 min.\n\nRotten Tomatoes Reviews:\n\nOCTOBER 20, 2005\n\nJustin Chang\n\nChief Film Critic Variety\n\n\"Kids in America\" would be easier to root for if it weren't so very pleased with itself. Taking up the cause of real-life high schoolers punished for going against the grain, writer-director Josh Stolberg launches a scalding attack on the stodgy conservatism of the American public school system, only to end up stacking the deck in egregiously smirky and simple-minded ways.<\n\n“Kids in America” would be easier to root for if it weren’t so very pleased with itself. Taking up the cause of real-life high schoolers punished for going against the grain, writer-director Josh Stolberg launches a scalding attack on the stodgy conservatism of the American public school system, only to end up stacking the deck in egregiously smirky and simple-minded ways. Stateside release in 700 theaters won’t rack up much biz, though pic could make its way into a few classrooms on video.\n\nAs may be guessed from its rather obvious title, “Kids in America” aims to inspire teenagers to boldly speak their minds, while giving everyone else an inside look at the repressive tyranny at the heart of the educational establishment. Pic mistakenly assumes, however, that because the contentious issues it raises are drawn from actual situations, dramatic plausibility should automatically follow. Not so.\n\nShortly after a girl is suspended for taping condoms to her dress to promote safe sex, a rebellious student named Holden (a nod to “The Catcher in the Rye”) uses the school talent show to deliver a withering attack on super-strict principal Donna Weller (Julie Bowen), who cares less about her young charges than her campaign to be elected state superintendent.\n\nThe stunt gets Holden (played by “Everwood’s” Gregory Smith) expelled, leaving him free to plot fresh anarchy against Weller and rally the students to take their First Amendment rights seriously. He’s aided by g.f. Charlotte (Stephanie Sherrin) and their other socially conscious pals, all smart teenagers from the fringes of high school society, who are encouraged to “change ‘da world” by their progressive English teacher, Will Drucker (Malik Yoba).\n\nBut even Drucker is outraged when Holden’s actions — he starts off by hijacking the school’s PA system and ends up torching a football field — land a student in the hospital. It’s the only time Stolberg acknowledges that even budding activists have a duty to act responsibly.\n\nPic’s authority figures, however, are punished the most severely, none moreso than the power-mad, virulently homophobic principal. Played by “Boston Legal’s” very attractive Bowen, Weller is a screaming caricature who calls her students retards and says things like, “Bring me his head!” The idea that administrative intolerance might be systemic rather than the work of a Hitler-esque banshee — or that even the most censorious principal might still be a human being — is simply beyond this film’s imagination.\n\nInstead, Weller is pilloried as a not-so-subtle stand-in for the Bush administration — at one point, she actually invokes the Patriot Act — while at the other end of the spectrum, Charlotte’s mother (Rosanna Arquette), a tofu-munching liberal who reminisces happily about her bra-burning days, is idealized as the ultimate in cool parenting.\n\nYounger thesps are competent enough, though the overall group suggests an almost utopian model of peer diversity, with several of the characters — especially an openly gay student (Alex Anfanger) who rattles off references to Wham! and Bob Fosse — feeling more like types than flesh-and-blood adolescents.<\n\nStrenuously clever dialogue is very heavy on pop-culture references, and pic as a whole feels saturated with a love of filmmaking and the arts in general. During one earnest romantic interlude, Holden and Charlotte re-enact a series of classic kissing scenes from teen faves including “Say Anything … ” and “Sixteen Candles.”\n\nCast also boasts several established thesps in small parts, including Adam Arkin, Elizabeth Perkins, Charles Shaughnessy and George Wendt as a very likable gym teacher. Closing rap, performed by thesp Crystal Celeste Grant, suggests that the material would have made a more than adequate music video.\n\n-----\n\nOctober 21, 2005\n\nAlex roy\n\n*** ½ Stars\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, Kids In America is very underrated. What you have here with this film is a comedy that exposes an important subject. People hate on this film because of the fact that Nicole Ritchie plays in this film. Well, her role I thought was so minimal that it really didn't bring anything memorable to the film. Her role wasn't an essential part of the film. I didn't care to see her on screen, and she didn't annoy me in the process. What I love about Kids In America is that it's very different that your usual Teen comedy. Where the usual teen comedy insults teens for what they usually \"are\", Kids In America takes a different, refreshing approach and creates something funny, charming but above all, smart. The casting choices are well done, and every actor is perfect for the part they played. The film is very entertaining, funny and well crafted. This is an underrated film that shouldn't be passed up. Most Teen comedies fail to capture what teen life really is about, but Kids In America is the only film of it's kind that is smart and exposes issues that people don't even care about. Kids In America is a better film than what people might think. A well acted film with laughs and drama about important teen issues. Sure the film could have been improved upon, but for what it does, it captures the essence of what growing up really is, and that is one of the reasons that this film works so well.\n\nNick Grimm\n\n*** ½ Stars\n\nHonestly I thought it was going to suck. but there is a certain real edge to the movie that you don't find in the vast majority of \"teen movies\".. Most of the dialogue and characters are spot on, teens act like teens.. yet it still manages to be entertaining and humorous while carrying a message without caving and going to extremes..No names for all but three of the major roles (Gregory Smith, Caitlin Wachs and Julie Bowen) adds to the feel.. A few moments of stupidity and one particular character hurt the movie.. but there are a few great standout scenes and characters that make up for it.. It's not perfect, but it wasn't meant to be.. otherwise you'd end up with that carbon copy teen movie..\n\nAugust 22, 2011\n\nLola A\n\n*** Stars\n\nA good, slightly thought provoking film that will give teenagers another reason to 'fight the power' at school. 'Inspired' rather than 'based' on true events is an accurate description of this film, as it can't quite decide whether to be serious or give into teen-popcorn-dom. Its message of freedom of speech is at times hyped up and made as much of a spectacle as its stereotypical characters, who unrealistically decide to band together. Although the impetus is documentary the theme is at times muddied with over idealization of fictional film which is used to further a romantic subplot. Journalism is touched on but social upheaval and protest is literally given the stage. The film however does illustrate the intelligence of the characters and of non violent protest but is ultimately watered down with artistic licence and the avoidance of rebuke for provoking or persuading young viewers to copy the film. As a whole this film is good but the feeling I got from it was: this movie is true-ish, what they did was right kinda, we're not saying that you should do this too, but hey its enjoyable right! Which is downright hypocritical considering the plot.\n\n****\n\nCAST BIOGRAPHIES\n\nGregory Smith - Holden Donovan\n\nGregory Smith, star of the WB hit television show, Everwood, is an accomplished young actor with dozens of television and feature credits under his belt.
