        "text": "By Keith Tomasek, October 22, 2017\n\nNetflix and chill.\n\nWe’ve all been there.\n\nSometimes it isn’t even about the films.\n\nEither way, before your next Netflix soirée, check out these films that have a connection to the Forest City.\n\n1) “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2” (2013)\n\nThe sequel to “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” (2009) follows inventor Flint Rockwood as he discovers his most famous invention is churning out animal-food hybrids.\n\nLondon born Chris Pearn directed “Cloudy with A Chance of Meatballs 2.”\n\nPearn, whose work also includes storyboard art on “Hotel Transylvania,” recently moved back to the Forest City, to head the London office of the B.C. based Bron Media Corp. which is led by London-native Aaron L. Gilbert.\n\n2) “Third Person” (2013)\n\n“Third Person” looks at three relationships, in three cities: Paris, New York, and Rome.\n\nDespite a stellar cast consisting of Liam Neeson, Mila Kunis, Adrien Brody, Olivia Wilde and James Franco the film only received a rating of 4.4/10 on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThis from Paul Haggis who in 20014 became the first London born director and writer to win back-to-back Oscars for “Crash” and “Million Dollar Baby.”\n\n3) “The F Word”/”What If” (2013)\n\n“The F Word,” based on the play “Toothpaste and Cigarettes,” explores what happens when you fall for your best friend.\n\nThis romantic comedy, also known as “What If” in some countries, was directed by former Londoner Michael Dowse.\n\nThe actor who plays the film’s central character, Wallace, was also born in London, but not the Forest City. You might have heard of him: Daniel Radcliffe.\n\n4) “Goon” (2011)\n\nDowse also directed the hockey comedy “Goon,” which is about a bouncer who becomes captain of a hockey team full of outcasts.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars.\n\nIt’s worth a look just for the performances by Jay Baruchel, Eugene Levy and Liev Schreiber.\n\n5) “The Breakfast Club” (1985)\n\nIt’s been way too long since you’ve hung out with the kids who hang out in the detention room.\n\nBet you didn’t know that the role of the Janitor, Carl Reed, is played by John Kapelos, who was born in London.\n\nThe Second City, Chicago alumnus is a busy actor appearing in several productions a year.\n\nJohn Kapelos, The Breakfast Club\n\nNow, here’s an invitation to get off the couch and hang out with me and some strangers in a dark room.\n\nFilms with ties to Southwestern Ontario, that aren’t yet on Netflix, are being celebrated this weekend at the Forest City Film Festival. The second annual event showcases short films, documentaries, narratives, and animated films with a connection to the region.\n\nCome join the fun. I’ll be hosting the 4 screenings below, so be sure to say “Hi Keith.”\n\nFriday at 12:15pm – Program 3 – Wolf Performance Hall\n\nSaturday at 10:15am – Program 7 – Imagine Cinemas\n\nSaturday at 1:00pm – Program 9 – imagine Cinemas\n\nSunday at 3:00 – Program 17 – Wolf Performance Hall\n\nDetails Details\n\nThe Forest City Film Festival runs from October 26 to 29. Click here for the full schedule.\n\nKeith Tomasek has produced award winning films, one of which was shortlisted for an Oscar nomination and received the National Institute Drama Prize Award. Working as Senior Interactive Media Developer with America Online he partnered with Warner Brothers to create the digital marketing campaign for “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.”"
