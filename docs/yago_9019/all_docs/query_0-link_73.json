        "text": "This particularly dislikable American post-college comedy is set in 1988, when Reagan was about to pass the baton to Bush senior and every graduate wanted to get rich in investment banking. Matt, the movie's young hero, an MIT graduate turned temporary slacker, is selling video cassettes in a Los Angeles shopping mall while thinking about how to spend his future. Suddenly, he meets his high-school idol, the beautiful Tori, now a high-flying banker, and pretends that he's an adviser on Asian investment at Goldman Sachs. The action takes place on a single night at two Labour Day parties, one for hard-drinking middle-class kids having a final fling before setting about getting rich, the other for youngish executives who already have their first couple of million in the bank. The movie makes its points about ambition, life choices, individualism and conformity both raucously and with bludgeoning crudity. Not a journey to the end of the night that I'd recommend."
