        "text": "Eternal mystery: Why is the painfully untalented Ashton Kutcher still playing leads in major movies while Topher Grace, his far more gifted “That ’70s Show” co-star, is virtually MIA from the big screen?\n\nKutcher has made more than his share of dogs, but Grace is unlikely to return to the A-list with Michael Dowse’s “Take Me Home,” a tediously unfunny comedy shot four years ago as “Kids in America” and newly equipped with a snappier title and a massive TV marketing campaign.\n\nThe studio spin is that the original distributor was spooked by the massive presence of cocaine in this R-rated flick, which also features copious female nudity and takes place in La-La Land over Labor Day weekend in 1988.\n\nLike most of the cast, Grace is a decade too old for his part — he’s supposed to be a recent graduate of MIT working as a clerk at Suncoast Video while he decides what he wants to be when he grows up.\n\nWhen he re-encounters the dream girl who ignored him in high school — a personality-free blonde (Teresa Palmer) — Grace pretends he works for the nonexistent Los Angeles office of Goldman Sachs.\n\nThis being a labored, “American Graffiti”-style homage to films of the ’80s — “Dazed and Confused” for dummies, if you will — there is a long, long night of hard partying, with lots of period songs (not including the title number, alas) on the soundtrack.\n\nThe festivities begin inauspiciously, when Grace’s recently fired buddy (Dan Fogler) “borrows” a convertible from his former employer.\n\nThe heavyset Fogler, who mugs without mercy while going for a cross between Chris Farley and Curtis Armstrong, handles most of the nonstarter blow jokes, while the more straight-laced Grace pursues his golden girl.\n\nThere’s a leaden subplot about Grace’s twin sister getting engaged to a macho jerk, but even the ever-reliable Anna Faris can’t do anything with a rare nonsexpot role.\n\nIt all comes down to our hero — who finally samples some coke — rolling down one of those Beverly Hills inside a giant steel ball.\n\nDoing that might actually be more fun than watching a dirge of a comedy like “Take Me Home,” which looks as authentically cruddy as most ’80s teen flicks. Or alternatively, you could rent Topher Grace’s best movie, the little-seen “In Good Company” (2004), from Suncoast Video."
