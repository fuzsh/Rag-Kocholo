        "text": "The South by Southwest Film Festival rolled out its feature film program Wednesday, and among the treats is Morgan Spurlock’s The Greatest Movie Ever Sold, Errol Morris’ Tabloid, a documentary about the Foo Fighters and an early screening of Catherine Hardwicke‘s Red Riding Hood.\n\nAs its size and influence grows—and its movies increasingly find distribution—SXSW has felt its reputation begin to push at the boundaries of its second-tier status. The 2011 festival, which runs March 11-19 and also features panels and workshops, will include 130 features, including 60 world premieres, selected from a total of 1,792 features.\n\nOverall submissions jumped 23%, likely spurred on by the national profile of the locally nurtured mumblecore collective and the increasing number of films that are getting picked up by distributors out of the fest. Last year, Magnet Releasing grabbed Monsters, Magnolia Pictures picked up Barry Munday, Phase 4 bought Brotherhood and IFC Films nabbed a number of films, including Lena Dunham’s Tiny Furniture, in the weeks and months following their premieres at SXSW.\n\n“We’ve generated a lot of excitement—there’s been great buzz, great press, great filmmakers emerging from here,” says SXSW film conference and festival producer Janet Pierson. “Austin is a lot of people’s favorite town. We just keep getting more and more exciting, and people want to be part of it.”\n\nThe festival’s main competition categories—including eight narrative features and eight documentaries—are comprised solely of world premieres. In addition to vying for grand jury prizes, the competition films are also eligible for screenplay, editing, cinematography, music and acting awards.\n\n“We’re looking through this crush of films thinking, Which are the ones that speak to us?” says Pierson. “We’re looking for something edgy or a little different, fun and raunchy, tech-y and young.”\n\nThe narrative competition will include 96 Minutes, directed by Aimée Lagos; A Year in Mooring, directed by Chris Eyre; American Animal, directed by Matt D’Elia; Charlie Casanova, directed by Terry McMahon; Fly Away, directed by Janet Grillo; Happy New Year, directed by K. Lorrel Manning; Natural Selection, directed by Robbie Pickering; and Small, Beautifully Moving Parts, directed by Annie J. Howell & Lisa Robinson.\n\nThe documentary feature competition will include A Mouthful, directed by Sally Rowe; Better This World, directed by Katie Galloway & Kelly Duane de la Vega; The City Dark, directed by Ian Cheney; Dragonslayer, directed by Tristan Patterson; Fightville, directed by Michael Tucker & Petra Epperlein; Kumaré, directed by Vikram Gandhi; Last Days Here, directed by Don Argott & Demian Fenton; and Where Soldiers Come From, directed by Heather Courtney.\n\nAlready announced were the fest’s opening night film, the thriller Source Code; docs Conan O’Brien Can’t Stop, It’s About You and Square Grouper; and dramatic films Paul, The Innkeepers and The Beaver. Jodie Foster, who stars with Mel Gibson and directed The Beaver, will be on-hand in Austin to shepherd the world premiere of her film at what could be the only place it can get a fair shake.\n\n“It was all based on how we felt about the film, because I didn’t want the noise,” says Pierson, acknowledging the potential controversy around the embattled Gibson. “I think the film is fantastic. It’s incredibly moving. In a way, this film needs us.”\n\nHardwicke, who used to live in Austin, will be in town to teach a directing workshop at the fest and will host a Q&A following the screening Thursday night March 10 before the festival officially kicks off. Potential performances by music documentary subjects My Morning Jacket, Foo Fighters and Ron Sexsmith are in the offing, as well.\n\nAlong with the festival’s growing stature has come an increase in demand that last year caused a large number of attendees to complain about being unable to get into many screenings. Fest organizers have spent the time since putting together a number of additional venues and changes to line procedures.\n\n“We knew there was an issue last year,” says Pierson, who is still working out advantageous time staggers so people can jump to an open screening. “We took it really seriously. We have really put a lot of effort into our line procedures, in terms of making sure people understand where they are in line, whether it’s worth waiting. We have a number of new controls that we’re using and more bodies to try to make it more user-friendly.”\n\nAmong the changes:\n\nThe State Theatre, a 300-seat venue next door to the Paramount Theatre, has been re-furbished and re-opened after flood damage. The narrative competition films will play there.\n\nThe theater in the Austin Convention Center—called the G-Tech last year—has been renamed the Vimeo Theater and has been expanded from 450 seats to approximately 650 seats. The documentary competition films will screen there, in addition to a number of other documentaries.\n\nThe Rollins Studio Theatre, a black-box theater with about 230 seats, has been added as a venue. It is on the shuttle route to the Alamo Drafthouse S. Lamar Theatre and will likely highlight destination films from the Festival Favorites and Lone Star States programs.\n\nTwo screens at Regal theaters off the downtown footprint—one each at the Arbor and the Westgate—have been procured to highlight a limited satellite program catering to local audiences.\n\nThe Hideout will no longer screen films, but will be used as a clubhouse for filmmakers.\n\nThe Midnighters and SXFantastic feature sections will be announced next week along with the short film program.\n\nFULL LINE-UP FOLLOWS ON NEXT PAGE\n\n[page break]\n\nNARRATIVE FEATURE COMPETITION\n\n96 MINUTES\n\nDirector & Writer: Aimée Lagos\n\nFour young lives.
