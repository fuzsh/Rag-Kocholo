        "text": "While the casting of actual New York City skateboarders in Kids provided a sense of hyper-realism to the film, it also provided the production with some challenges. One of them came in the form of actor Justin Pierce, who inhabits the role of the chaotic, violent Casper.\n\n\"(Pierce) was super magnetic, and there was something really beautiful about him,\" recalls screenwriter Harmony Korine. \"At the same time, he was completely uncontrollable. He went for it all of the time, and that's part of what got him into trouble.\"\n\nOne mid-production incident revolved around a physical altercation involving Pierce and New York police officers during off-hours. Pierce sustained a broken wrist and received two days in jail, which delayed the final day of filming. Out of concern for film continuity (not to mention the limited budget), Pierce finished shooting Kids upon his release from lockup with broken bones - and without a cast.\n\n\"I had such a crush on Justin when we did the movie,\" Rosario Dawson said. \"He was such a mess.\"\n\nPierce took his own life in 2000 at the age of 25.\n\nWhile she made a brief appearance on Sesame Street as a child, Rosario Dawson's big acting break came quite by surprise, when she was approached by director Larry Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine while sitting on her front porch stoop in Lower Manhattan. At the time, she was 15 years old.\n\n\"I was a straight-A student,\" she said. \"I was a tutor. I was a virgin. I was boyfriend-less. I didn’t have sex until I was 20.\"\n\nThis didn't dissuade Korine, who felt she'd be perfect for the promiscuous, profane character of Ruby, who serves as the ringleader of Kids' female cast. Dawson accepted the role. The decision would catapult her to stardom, with subsequent roles in Robert Rodriguez’s Sin City, Spike Lee's 25th Hour, and Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof, among many others.\n\nDawson recalled of Kids: \"I was playing a character that was really sexually promiscuous, but I was making a movie that was about the perils of childhood, when you think you’re going to live forever.\"\n\nOf the graphic content in the finished film, however? \"My grandmother was like, 'You could have warned us before we told all of our church friends.'\"\n\nNow well-known for her work in American Psycho, American Horror Story, and the HBO series Big Love, Golden Globe-winning actress Chloë Sevigny made her feature film debut in Kids, as a young girl who discovers she is HIV-positive.\n\nBut Sevigny wasn't the first choice for the role. In fact, Canadian actress Mia Kirshner had originally been tapped for the part, but was let go two days prior to the start of production, as she apparently didn't quite gel with the rest of the cast.\n\nSevigny, who had previously met Kids writer Harmony Korine in New York's Washington Square Park, where much of the action in the film takes place, was bumped to the role of Jennie from the small peripheral part of Joy for which she'd originally been cast.\n\nAt 19 years of age and with no professional film acting experience, Sevigny recalls of her reaction to the audience response to Kids upon its release:\n\nI remember people hugging me and thinking it really happened. Kids crying, \"Oh, my God, I feel this way, too,\" or \"I have HIV.\" I was happy that it was resonating with kids. It also made me wary of being a public figure and giving over your anonymity.\n\nDuring a taping of The Late Show, Kids screenwriter Harmony Korine - who was there to promote his novel A Crack-Up at the Race Riots, and who was also at the time using crack and heroin - was caught going through the purse of fellow guest and Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep by host David Letterman.\n\nRecalled Letterman of the incident, \"I found Harmony going through her purse (in the green room). True story. And so, I said: 'That's it, put her things back in her bag and then get out.'\"\n\nYears later, Letterman would let bygones be bygones. The legendary host said he’d be happy to have Korine, who had found success with his 2012 film Spring Breakers, and who had been clean and sober for over a decade, back on the show.\n\nFirst-time director Larry Clark met 19-year-old aspiring screenwriter and skateboarder Harmony Korine in Washington Square Park and tapped him to write the feature script for Kids (which he completed in one week). The filmmakers were then determined to cast people as real, and as gritty, as the world in which their story was based.\n\nTo accomplish this, the production pounded the New York City pavement, pasting up and passing out flyers in an effort to round out their cast with real New York denizens. The ploy worked, with Clark hiring mostly non-professional actors, including Rosario Dawson, Chloë Sevigny, Leo Fitzpatrick, and Justin Pierce.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. As Clark recalls:\n\nThe four boys on the couch at the end of the party (in Kids), those boys just showed up from San Francisco, and came over because they knew the skaters (we'd cast), and I saw them and I said, \"Man, I have to do something.\" So, I stuffed them on the couch and said, \"Talk about this, talk about this\"... it was magic, probably the best scene in the film, incredible.\n\nWith much of the central cast made up of non-professional actors of a young age, the production got a little hectic - including the memorable party scene in which a group of teenage boys hang out on a sofa, chatting and getting high.\n\nDirector Larry Clark recalls:\n\nWe talked for about 10-15 minutes and then I cut it (the scene). Then they (the cast) were pretending to smoke marijuana. It could've been real, I don't know. But I do know that some of the crew wanted to quit. They thought that maybe I shouldn't be filming thirteen, twelve-year-old kids smoking weed. But (it) wasn't my weed!\n\nAs production continued in public settings, many of the extra roles and general parts in the cast were filled out by real New York City skateboarders who might have brought their own \"props.\"\n\n\"Obviously those kids (in the film) were smoking dope in the park. There's no illusion about that,\" says Kids cinematographer Eric Allen Edwards of some of the cast, and of one of the scenes in the film. \"So, at some point that became a thing: Can we legally show kids smoking dope? And what does that mean?\""
