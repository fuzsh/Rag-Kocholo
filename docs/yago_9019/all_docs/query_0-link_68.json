        "text": "The Philadelphia Film Society is proud to announce the full slate for the upcoming 20th Philadelphia Film Festival, which will run October 20 – November 3 on 8 screens throughout the greater Philadelphia area. The Festival will open on October 20th with the Philadelphia Premiere of Drake Doremus’ Like Crazy. Winner of the Sundance Grand Jury Prize and Best Actress for Felicity Jones, Like Crazy is a powerful story about two young lovers whose relationship is threatened by international borders. The Festival will close on October 29th with Alexander Payne’s The Descendants. Starring George Clooney, The Descendants is a sharp, emotional and often hilarious portrait of a man who uncovers life’s altering secrets while his wife is on her deathbed.\n\nThe Festival will also feature 6 Gala screenings, including: Roland Emmerich’s Anonymous, a captivating political thriller about a controversy surrounding the authorship of Shakespeare’s plays; Michel Hazanavicius’ The Artist, a suburb silent film in classic black-and-white that was the darling of the Cannes Film Festival; Jim Field Smith’s Butter, a politically incorrect satire that places an all-star cast in the competitive world of butter carving; Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass’ Jeff, Who Lives At Home, a sincere comedy about family, destiny, mystery and finding one’s place in the universe; Simon Curtis’ My Week with Marilyn, a charming behind-the-curtain biopic on the relationship between Laurence Olivier and Marilyn Monroe; and Steve McQueen’s Shame, the powerful and provocative winner of the Best Actor prize in at the Venice Film Festival, which tells the story of a man who is forced to confront his own extreme sexual compulsions.\n\nJ. Andrew Greenblatt, Executive Director of the Philadelphia Film Society and Philadelphia Film Festival commented, “We’re extremely proud of the program we are able to bring to Philadelphia this year. This year’s suburb lineup builds off of the great success of last year’s Festival, one of our most successful ever. Michael and his stellar programming team have worked incredibly hard to bring the best films from around the world to Philadelphia in what I believe to be our finest program yet.”\n\nMichael Lerman, Artistic Director said, “20 years is a huge event and we really tried to rise to the occasion. We were actually blessed to have not only so many great films this year to choose from but also so many films that dealt with filmmaking, storytelling or performance. Weaving films like The Artist, Anonymous and Corman’s World through our strongest program to date, I can’t help but get excited that we will be truly celebrating the history of cinema as well as 20 great years of the Philadelphia Film Festival. And with a selection this varied, there’s a little something for everyone who wants to join the party.”\n\nThe 15-day Philadelphia Film Festival will feature more than 120 of the best new films from around the world, featuring today’s most important and emerging filmmakers, curated by the stellar programming committee, which includes Artistic Director Michael Lerman, programmers Tom Quinn and Ryan Werner and shorts programmer Jesse Trussell. The 20th Philadelphia Film Festival is made possible through the generous support of its sponsors, including Official Sponsors Philadelphia Weekly, the exclusive Print Media Sponsor of the Philadelphia Film Festival, Southwest Airlines, the Official Airline of the Philadelphia Film Festival, the University of Pennsylvania, WHYY, the Official Media Partner of the Philadelphia Film Festival, and Xfinity; also through the generous support of the Wyncote Foundation and Dolfinger-McMahon Foundation, as well as through the support of the members of the Philadelphia Film Society.\n\nScreenings for the 20th Philadelphia Film Festival will take place at the Ritz East (125 S. 2nd St, Philadelphia, PA 19106), the Ritz Five (214 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19106), the Rave University Six (230 S. 40th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104), the International House (3701 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104), the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts (3680 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104) and the Prince Music Theater (1412 Chestnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19102), with an additional screening at the Bryn Mawr Film Institute (824 W.
