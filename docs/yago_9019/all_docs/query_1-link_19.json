Matt rethinks his position when his unrequited high-school crush, Tori, walks in and invites him to an end-of-summer party. With the help of his twin sister and his best friend, Matt hatches a plan to change the course of his life.",

        "text": "Ah, the 1980s. The decade where the music was playful, the clothes were colorful, and the films were simplistic yet meaningful. There's something magical about the heyday of music videos, video games, and synthesizers that makes all your worries disappear. It’s a unique period in time whose “feel” is near-impossible to recreate, which is why \"Take Me Home Tonight\" shouldn't be overlooked. It's as close as you will ever get to reliving the Regan years on celluloid short of watching an actual 80's flick. The hair, the shoulder pads, the fingerless gloves, the cars, the music, the neon… it’s all here and lovingly respected (save for a few anachronisms, but who cares!).\n\nThat said, everything about this movie, from the…\n\nLaura was at a spa this evening so I figured I'd indulge in a little self-care myself with a feel-good party flick. Hits all the beats of its early aughts analogues while circumventing most of what makes those problematic, this having been made in 2011 (update: apparently this was made in 2007 and severely delayed, so big-ups to the filmmakers for everything being as palatable as it is) when we were a little bit wiser (see Matt calling out Pete [another classic douche turn from Michael Ian Black] for sexually harassing Tori).

Its attitude toward romantic comedy, teen comedy, and party movies seems frozen in time from long ago, like it's trying to preserve a very basic bygone-era formula that has long since evolved for the better.\n\nThat having been said, this movie is fucking rad. Forgive the too-many soft jokes and willfully superficial storytelling and you've still got a quintessential all-night-long party opus/coming-of-age seize-the-moment winner/sweet love story/meticulously festooned tribute to the '80s. It's like a more hedonistic \"Can't Hardly Wait\". It loves the '80s, it jacks up every actor's charisma to the max (this is one of the…"
