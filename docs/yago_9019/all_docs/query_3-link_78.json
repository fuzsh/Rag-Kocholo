        "text": "It’s time to look ahead and plan those fun-filled movie nights for your family to share together throughout 2024. This year’s slate does not disappoint and includes something that kids (and adults!) at every age and stage can enjoy.\n\nFrom returning favorites and sequels to brand-new adventures, 2024 is a big year for family fun at the movies.\n\nThe Pixar hits Soul, Turning Red, and Luca, which did not get a theatrical release thanks to the pandemic, were all finally shared on the big screen. Of course, a brand-new Pixar movie—which is also one of the most anticipated sequels—is on the way as the sequel to Inside Out hits theaters this summer.\n\nFor parents, there’s plenty of throwbacks and nostalgia in the mix, including Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which takes the beloved franchise back to where things first started getting spooky—that infamous firehouse in New York City. And for throwback favorites, Garfield, the comic strip cat from the 80s, best known for the cat that hates Mondays and loves lasagna, is ready to be introduced to a new generation.\n\nThen there's a new adventure called IF, starring Ryan Reynolds and written and directed by John Krasinski, about a little girl who can see the imaginary friends that grown-ups left behind. This is going to be one of those transcendent family films that will delight the kids while giving adults all the feels!\n\nWhether you’re heading to the theater or cozying up on your couch, here’s your month-by-month guide to the best family-friendly flicks coming your way. Just add popcorn (maybe some Sno-Caps, too) and enjoy the show(s)!\n\nJANUARY\n\nSoul\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now on Disney+\n\nStarring: Jaime Foxx, Tina Fey\n\nThe Academy Award-winning animated film Soul missed its moment in theaters as it was released in 2020—when the world was still shut down. My family found so much solace in this film from the safety of our couch, but we cannot wait to see this beautiful movie, about living life to the fullest, as it was intended—on the big screen. Disney is releasing two more Pixar films that debuted on streaming during the pandemic, including Turning Red and Luca.\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Be prepared for questions—especially if your child has yet to experience the death of a loved one. Soul touches on complex themes including life, death, the afterlife, and searching for purpose and meaning in our lives.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nOrion and the Dark\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now on Netflix\n\nStarring: Jacob Tremblay, Paul Walter Hauser\n\nIn this animated adventure, Orion (Tremblay) is a young boy with many fears ranging from heights to pets. But the one that has him the most rattled? The dark! To help change his tune, the Dark (Hauser) takes Orion on a nighttime trip to prove the famous adage you’ve likely told your own kids once or twice—the only thing to fear is fear itself!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Orion sketches out his anxieties and fears in a book and some of those images—which include murderous clowns, bugs, public humiliation, and bullying at school—start to come alive (though still in his imagination). Over all, the film encourages kids to push through fears so they can enjoy life and live it to the fullest.\n\nTiger's Apprentice\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now on Paramount+\n\nStarring: Michelle Yeoh, Henry Golding, Brandon Soo Hoo\n\nTom (Soo Hoo) is a normal boy who lives with his grandmother (Yeoh) in San Francisco's Chinatown. It turns out that despite being a little eccentric, his grandmother is actually the Guardian of the Phoenix Egg! When she perishes in battle, Tom must apprentice with an unlikely mentor—a tiger named Mr. Hu (Golding)—to learn ancient magic he needs to know to become the egg's new protector.\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Overall, this film promotes courage, family bonds, and lots of teamwork. But you can expect some mild (and humorous) violence with monster-like demons, plus magical powers that do it all from turning people to stone to causing fart explosions from a goat.\n\nTurning Red\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now on Disney+\n\nStarring: Rosalie Chiang, Sandra Oh\n\nTurning Red is one of three Pixar movies that never made it to theaters thanks to Covid, and if you have a tween or teen daughter—it’s a must-watch. This beautiful coming-of-age story focuses on 13-year-old Mei Lee (Chiang) going through all the normal turmoil of puberty—butting heads with her mom (Oh), emotional roller coasters, drama with friends . . . except Mei Lee has it a little tougher than your average girl. Why? She transforms into a giant red panda whenever she gets over-excited!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Puberty and adolescence are the main themes in this film so there's plenty of references to periods and crushes, which can open up discussions about changing bodies and hormones. There's some mild language, but overall this is a story that encourages many positive family discussions.\n\nMARCH\n\nKung Fu Panda 4\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now streaming on Prime Video\n\nStarring: Jack Black, Awkwafina, Viola Davis\n\nPo (Black) is about to become the spiritual leader of his Valley of Peace! Great news but first he must find someone to take his place as Dragon Warrior, taking Po on an adventure filled with laughs, team building, and, of course, villain-defeating!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: While there will be some mild violence thanks to those over-the-top ninja moves, those action-packed scenes are done with humor. Plus, they're so over the top, they could never be tried or replicated at home!\n\nLuca\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: Now streaming on Disney+\n\nStarring: Jacob Tremblay, Jack Dylan Grazer\n\nLuca is the last of the Pixar films sans a theatrical release because of the pandemic and is finally getting its time to shine. This beautiful film takes place on the Italian Riviera and follows an unlikely friendship between a human boy (Tremblay) and a sea monster disguised as a human (Grazer).\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: This heartwarming tale does feature some silly body humor, insults in both English and Italian (such as \"stupido,\" \"idioti,\" and \"jerk\"), plus mild injuries from comedic don't-try-this-at-home stunts such as jumping off of cliffs and trees. Overall, Luca is about acceptance and can open up beautiful conversations that message.\n\nGhostbusters: Frozen Empire\n\nWhere and When to Watch: March 22 in theaters nationwide, streaming on Prime Video\n\nStarring: Mckenna Grace, Paul Rudd, Finn Wolfhard\n\nHere’s a mind-blowing fact—the original Ghostbusters movie turns 40 years old in 2024! But what’s harder to wrap my head around? The franchise is still popular and my 9-year-old daughter is a fan! The latest installment is a nostalgia-filled throwback to the original, featuring the next generation of the Spengler family, the iconic New York City firehouse, and the OG Ghostbusters fighting off an evil force that could cause a second Ice Age!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: As with all the movies in the Ghostbusters franchise, there will be light frights and mild violence—but all done with humor. And yes, while you should be mindful that there will also be some swearing and mature references, it's nothing too jarring and may even go over the heads of young children who are hyper-focused by the arrival of ghosts in NYC.\n\nMAY\n\nIF\n\nStarring: Ryan Reynolds, John Krasinski, Cailey Fleming\n\nWhere and When to Watch: May 17 in theaters nationwide\n\nIFs (Imaginary friends) are a treasured part of childhood and Krasinski directs this sure-to-be classic that pays homage to the ones we had—or still hold dear. A young girl named Bea (Fleming) discovers she can see IFs that were abandoned by the kids they once helped. Bea's not the only one with this gift—she discovers her neighbor, known as The Man Upstairs (Reynolds), can see them too. I’m predicting we’ll all need a box of tissues (or three) to make it through this film!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: This sweet movie can bring up deep talks about getting older, big life transitions, and changes that occur while moving from one phase of life to the next. It's natural to leave behind child comforts such as imaginary friends but it certainly doesn't make it any less emotional.\n\nThe Garfield Movie\n\nWhere and When to Watch: May 24 in theaters nationwide\n\nStarring: Chris Pratt, Nicholas Hoult, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nChildren of the 80s, your favorite Monday-hating, lasagna-loving cat Garfield is making a big comeback. Garfield (Pratt), his best pal Odie the dog, and their beloved owner Jon (Hoult) are ready for new fans and new adventures. In this latest adaptation, Garfield reunites with his long-lost father Vic (Jackson).\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Overall, this film is silly and humorous—just like the original comic strip. But Garfield and his canine pal Odie are forced to give up their cushy life with their owner Jon when choosing to go on an adventure with Garfield's long lost dad—that may bring up convos about feeling lonely and/or abandoned as well as the importance of family, both chosen and biological!\n\nJUNE\n\nInside Out 2\n\nWhere and When to Watch: June 14 in theaters nationwide\n\nStarring: Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke\n\nWhen Inside Out hit theaters in 2015, I was a brand-spankin’ new mom to a baby girl which meant that Riley and all her emotions—Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness—really spoke to me. (Couldn't my baby stay little forever!?!) Well, today, that baby is 9, and I battle with her and all those emotions every day! So it's exciting and bittersweet for me that the Inside Out sequel is here, featuring teenage Riley! All the emotions—especially Joy (Poehler)—are trying to get Riley through this new phase, until a new emotion shows up that no one was expecting. Yes, welcome Anxiety (Hawke) to wreak havoc on Riley's already delicate mental balance!\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Be prepared for a roller coaster of emotions now that Riley is experiencing the joys of anxiety—thanks to the onset of puberty. For many viewers, it should help them feel relieved knowing they're not alone in these new feelings and outbursts. But for others, it may open up a myriad of questions about what will happen when they go through it one day. Overall, expect these growing pains to be depicted in a heartfelt and humorous way.\n\nJULY\n\nDespicable Me 4\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: July 3 in theaters nationwide\n\nStarring: Steve Carell, Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Joey King, Miranda Cosgrove, and Sofía Vergara\n\nIt’s been seven years since we’ve last seen Gru on the big screen. In Despicable Me 4, Gru and Lucy have a new bundle of joy to add to the family, Gru, Jr. Baby Gru joins sisters Margo, Edith, and Agnes. But in typical Despicable Me fashion, their normality doesn’t last long as a new nemesis comes along. Maxime Le Mal and his girlfriend Valentina force the family to go on the run along with their Minions.\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: Despicable Me 4 is rated PG and has a lot of action and cartoon violence. There are also some touching family moments between, Gru, Lucy, the girls, and Gru, Jr. If your little one is a fan of the franchise, they won’t want to miss this one.\n\nDescendants: The Rise of Red\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: July 12 on Disney+\n\nStarring: Brandy (Cinderella), Rita Ora (Queen of Hearts), Kylie Cantrall (Red), China Anne McClain (Uma), and Jeremy Swift (Merlin)\n\nWhile not in theaters, the Descendants franchise has been enchanting children and tweens since 2015. This fourth installment of Descendants introduces us to a new character, Red. She is the daughter of the Queen of Hearts. In this film, the Queen of Hearts tries to incite a coup against Auradon. It’s then up to Red and her roommate Chloe (Cinderella’s daughter) to try to undo what the Queen of Hearts has done.\n\nWhat Parents Should Know: If your kids are fans of the first three movies, the only \"descendant\" they will recognize will be Uma, the daughter of Ursula. The previous three films were recommended for children over 8 years old so this movie should be similar. Parents can expect some choreographed fighting as good battles evil. Parents of older kiddos may want to check out the newest installment for a sense of nostalgia.\n\nAUGUST\n\nHarold and the Purple Crayon\n\nWhen and Where to Watch: August 2 in theaters nationwide\n\nStarring: Zachary Levi, Lil Rel Howery, Benjamin Bottani, Jemaine Clement, Tanya Reynolds, Alfred Molina, and Zooey Deschanel\n\nThis is the first time the popular book Harold and the Purple Crayon has been adapted into a movie. Zachary Levi plays Harold who can make anything come to life by drawing it. He eventually grows up and draws himself right out of the book and into the real world.
