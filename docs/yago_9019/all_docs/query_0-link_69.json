        "text": "THERE are parties, and then there’s the Party, that one shimmering night that presents the chance to cut loose, kiss the prom queen and reveal one’s true self. And always it’s the last chance: before graduation, before leaving home, before everybody grows up.\n\nThat’s the near-mythic yarn that runs through “Take Me Home Tonight,” a one-night comedy that follows an ensemble of high school classmates reuniting just after college graduation. Like most one-night films  from “After Hours” to “Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist”  the stakes are high, the goal seemingly just out of reach. And like “Dazed and Confused” and “American Graffiti,” “Take Me Home Tonight” occurs in a bygone era.\n\nSet in 1988, the film, scheduled for release on March 4, is as much a period piece as it is a tale of quarter-life crisis.\n\n“It’s about the end of structure and that second puberty,” said Topher Grace, who stars in the film and produced it. “But we also wanted to make a movie that took the ’80s seriously, that didn’t make fun of it.”\n\nIn other words, tease the bangs to high heaven, but don’t make jokes about them  because no one did in the ’80s. It’s a balance Mr. Grace first encountered when he starred on the sitcom “That 70’s Show”: “I remember thinking at the beginning: ‘I don’t know what this is. We’re not focusing on the 70s that much. It’s not about Ford being president.’ ” He said he soon grew to appreciate that the retro setting slyly and silently informed the story, rather than serving as a subject of commentary. He sought to make “Take Me Home Tonight” the same way.\n\n“There are two ways for these things to be great,” Mr. Grace said. “They’re for the audience who has been through that decade, and for kids who haven’t lived it.” Mr. Grace is intensely focused on the latter group’s seeing this movie. The first thing he said to a reporter on the phone was: “You saw the movie, right? You sound young. There’s a certain generation we’re going for here.”\n\nHe’s motivated by more than box-office draw. Mr. Grace said he wants this film to affect young viewers the way “Dazed and Confused” influenced him when he was a teenager. Mr. Grace and his producing partner, Gordon Kaywin, stumbled upon “Dazed” when they were roommates at Brewster Academy in Wolfeboro, N.H. “There were always, like, 12 videotapes in the common room, left there by kids the year before,” Mr. Grace said. “Dazed and Confused,” about a gaggle of slacker teens in the 1970s, was one of them.\n\n“I had this sense that Richard Linklater was speaking directly to me. So I grew up with a movie about the ’70s that was made in the ’90s. And I wanted to do that for the ’80s generation.” Mr. Linklater directed “Dazed,” which came out in 1993.\n\nThe actors in “Take Me Home Tonight” aren’t old enough to remember the decade of Ronald Reagan and hair metal. “The ’80s, for me, were ages 2 to 11,” said Chris Pratt, who plays the host of the party that runs throughout the film. So for Mr. Pratt and the rest of the ensemble  Anna Faris, Dan Fogler and Teresa Palmer  impressions of the decade came largely from the films of the writer and director John Hughes. “I discovered ‘The Breakfast Club’ in high school,” said Ms. Palmer, who plays Mr. Grace’s character’s dream girl and who was born in 1986, the year after “The Breakfast Club” was released. “I felt so connected to that film, to the experiences those characters were having.”\n\nMr. Fogler, who plays the hyper sidekick to Mr. Grace’s character, studied that film and other work of the actor Anthony Michael Hall. “It’s that thing of being very insecure but trying to put on airs, trying to seem older,” Mr. Fogler said. “And a lot of the quick talking, the quiet planning in bathroom stalls.”\n\nMs. Faris, who plays an ambitious and brainy girl, connected with another similarity between “Take Me Home Tonight” and the Hughesmovies. “I loved that with ‘Pretty in Pink’ and ‘Say Anything’ you always rooted for the poor kids,” she said. “They were the cool kids. That resonated with me a great deal when I was growing up.”\n\nIt’s true that compared to most glossy movies about 20-somethings today, the clothes and homes in “Take Me Home Tonight” are modest. Mr. Grace and Mr. Fogler’s characters are awed by the Mercedes they conspire to “borrow” for the night. The lone exception here is Ms. Palmer’s luscious gold Halston dress, a nod to her investment banking job. When Mr. Grace and Mr. Fogler’s characters follow Ms. Palmer to her colleague’s party, they encounter plenty more dresses like hers, not to mention cocaine, the brief on-screen use of which delayed the film’s release. (It was then set up at Universal and will now be distributed by Relativity.)\n\nThat idea came from another of Mr. Grace’s favorite films: George Lucas’s “American Graffiti,” set during the golden-age hangover of the early 1960s. Imagine Entertainment, the company co-owned by a star of “American Graffiti”  Ron Howard  produced “Take Me Home Tonight.” Mr. Howard saw many parallels between the two films.\n\n“What’s cool about these films is they speak to one group in an immediate way and another group in a nostalgic way,” Mr. Howard said. “Young people are all waiting for this night to roll around when they’re going to change, understand, find that person. The people who have been there are looking back and recalling that coming-of-age moment in their lives.”\n\nIt is appropriate that the cast members of “Take Me Home Tonight” look back at their time filming the movie as just such a moment. It was 2007 when the cast came together for seven weeks in Phoenix, shooting with the director Michael Dowse from 5 p.m. to 5 a.m., six nights a week. “On the seventh night,” Ms. Faris said, “we’d all go back to the house we were shooting in and hang out.” Much was about to change for the actors, who  save for Mr. Grace  were all still relatively unknown.\n\nTheir careers since shooting read like a yearbook postscript: Mr. Grace would go on to star in “Valentine’s Day” and start Sargent Hall Productions with Mr. Kaywin. Mr. Fogler would star in “Balls of Fury“ and “Fanboys.“ Ms. Palmer would be cast in “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” and “I Am Number Four.“ Ms. Faris’s comedy “The House Bunny“ would put her on the map as a leading lady. Mr. Pratt would land on the NBC series “Parks and Recreation”  and marry Ms. Faris, whom he met on the set.\n\nMr. Grace is not surprised by his co-stars’ success. “I think about the IHOP we’d always go to after shooting, at, like, 6 a.m.,” he said. “I’d sit there watching Anna Faris, Dan Fogler, everybody, thinking, ‘At this table there are about five $20-million actors in the year 2020.’ ”\n\nThen they’d all go home to sleep. The sun had come up. The party was over."
