        "text": "Attack The Block (15)\n\n(Joe Cornish, 2011, UK) John Boyega, Nick Frost, Jodie Whittaker. 88 mins\n\nMore Critters than Cloverfield, this alien-invasion movie is modest in scale and ambition but makes up for it in local flavour. The setting is south London – Brit cinema's default \"ghetto\" location, bruv – where sharp-toothed ETs come to regret messing with the hoodies, who team up with their recent victim and the upstairs drug dealer to defend their manor. It's no Shaun Of The Dead, but it's up-to-date and fitfully entertaining, and there's at least some social grit beneath the down-with-the-kids comedy.\n\nA Screaming Man (PG)\n\n(Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, 2010, Cha/Fra/Bel) Youssouf Djaoro, Dioucounda Koma, Emile Abssolo M'Bo. 91 mins\n\nSaying a great deal with few resources, this skillful Chadian drama finds weighty moral, global and generational concerns in the story of a swimming pool attendant and his son.\n\nLove Like Poison (15)\n\n(Katell Quillévéré, 2010, Fra) Clara Augarde, Lio, Stefano Cassetti. 85 mins\n\nSexual and spiritual urges compete for the body and soul of a 14-year-old country girl in this intelligent small-scale drama. The grown-ups don't help at all, and as for the priest …\n\nThe Way (12A)\n\n(Emilio Estevez, 2010, US) Emilio Estevez, Martin Sheen, James Nesbitt. 128 mins\n\nSheen takes the Pyreneean pilgrimage his dead son didn't in this emotional, picaresque drama, though his restraint is undone by a Starbucksy soundtrack and general touchy feeliness.\n\nAmreeka (TBA)\n\n(Cherien Dabis, 2009, US/Can) Nisreen Faour, Melkar Muallem, Alia Shawkat. 96 mins\n\nThe prejudices against a Palestinian mother and son in Iraq-war America are treated lightly in an upbeat drama that smacks of first-hand experience.\n\nRed Hill (15)\n\n(Patrick Hughes, 2010, Aus) Ryan Kwanten, Steve Bisley, Tom E Lewis. 97 mins\n\nA big city cop doesn't find the quiet life he seeks in the outback. Instead he's up against an Aboriginal badass with a horse, a gun and a few scores to settle. Not as meat-headed as it sounds.\n\nAfter The Apocalypse (12A)\n\n(Antony Butts, 2010, UK) 64 mins\n\nLaudably even-handed documentary on the victims of the USSR's nuclear tests, and controversial attempts to control their birth defects. One woman's pregnancy puts the issues on a personal level.\n\nRisen (12A)\n\n(Neil Jones, 2010, UK) Stuart Brennan, John Noble, Erik Morales. 121 mins\n\nWelsh boxing champ Howard Winstone gets the Rocky treatment in a biopic that benefits from match-fit actors and the use of a \"glove cam\".\n\nTake Me Home Tonight (15)\n\n(Michael Dowse, 2011, US/Ger) Topher Grace, Anna Faris, Dan Fogler. 98 mins\n\nA shallow \"what a crazy night it was\" teen movie set in the 1980s and made by people who can't have been there at the time.\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! – Bonds Beyond Time (PG)\n\n(Kenichi Takeshita, 2010, Jap/US) Dan Green, Matthew Charles. 50 mins\n\nTrading-card-based kids' anime that will mean very little to outsiders.\n\nTaxi Driver (18)\n\n(Martin Scorsese, 1976, US) Robert DeNiro, Jodie Foster\n\nDeNiro's loner classic, still talking to us after all these years.\n\nOut from Friday\n\nThe Great White Silence\n\nRestored documentary tracking Scott's 1910 Antarctic expedition.\n\nPirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides\n\nPenélope Cruz and Ian McShane come aboard Depp's treasure cruise.\n\nOut from Wed\n\nWin Win\n\nPaul Giamatti finds a sense of purpose in high school wrestling.\n\nBlitz\n\nJason Statham and Paddy Considine hunt down a serial cop killer.\n\nFire In Babylon\n\nDoc reliving the golden years of West Indian cricket.\n\nAge Of Heroes\n\nSean Bean helps dramatise Ian Fleming's wartime commando unit.\n\nJulia's Eyes\n\nOptical Spanish horror produced by Guillermo Del Toro.\n\nPlaneat\n\nThe global impacts of healthy eating explained.\n\nThird Star\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch and friends bond on a Welsh camping trip.\n\nVidal Sassoon The Movie\n\nThe celebrity snipper remembers his roots.\n\nComing soon\n\nIn two weeks … One regrettable night in Bangkok in The Hangover Part II … Three-way romance Heartbeats …\n\nIn three weeks … Superheroes before they were famous in X-Men: First Class … The fast times of an F1 racer in Senna …"
