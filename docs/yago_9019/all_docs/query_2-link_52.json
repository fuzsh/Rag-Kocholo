        "text": "Chances are, someone in your family is likely to have seen a peppy TV spot, one of the fun-filled trailers or even an online “Barbenheimer” poster and been all, “Come on, 'Barbie,' let's go party.”\n\nDirected by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie, “Barbie” (in theaters and available to buy/rent on Apple TV, Vudu, Amazon and Google Play) is one of the year's most celebrated films. And being a meta comedy about the most famous doll of the past 60-plus years, it’s the type of movie that appeals to children of various ages.\n\nBut is it for your youngsters? Here’s what moms and dads need to know about “Barbie” and if they can watch with their kids:\n\nWhat is ‘Barbie’ about, anyway?\n\nBarbie Land is a pink-bedecked paradise of plastic where all the Barbies hang out and have fun while the Kens are just sort of there as window dressing. However, when Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) begins to recognize strange occurrences – like thoughts of death and signs of cellulite – she and her quasi-boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) go on a trip to the Real World to set things right. The situation leads to misadventures for both dolls, a mom (America Ferrera) and her daughter are swept up in Barbie’s existential crisis, and even Barbie Land itself is thrown into disarray.\n\nSo, is ‘Barbie’ a kids movie?\n\nNo, it is not – unless your child is REALLY into the study of gender norms and/or knows what the term “Proustian” means. (That might even disqualify some adults, honestly.) “Barbie” starts off enjoyably spirited but when Robbie’s Barbie drops the line, “Do you guys ever think about dying?” at a Dreamhouse dance party, it kicks off a bunch of heady themes that the movie gamely dives into, like the meaning of life and the role of the patriarchy.\n\nTweens and teens might appreciate the social commentary (which Gerwig has made straightforward and easily digestible), and kids around 9 or 10 will enjoy the goofball humor while the intellectual discussion goes over their heads. Those younger than that, however, most likely will find a lot of the talking parts boring and could get antsy waiting for Barbie to do something fun again.\n\n'Barbie': Margot Robbie never thought she'd have 'empathy for a doll'\n\nDoes 'Barbie' have sexual themes or inappropriate language?\n\nIt’s a PG-13 movie that plays it relatively safe in that regard. Ken wants to stay over at Barbie’s house one night, and when she asks what they’d do, he responds that he doesn’t know. (She rebuffs him for a “girls’ night” sleepover anyway.) The Kens threaten to “beach each other off” and Barbie actually points out a double entendre when it happens. Anything sexual is played off as a joke, like when Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) wonders about the “nude blob” in Ken’s pants and Barbie proclaims to a construction worker that \"I do not have a vagina!\"\n\nAs far as other potential concerns, the Kens get really into drinking beer at one point and there is one F-bomb that a Barbie drops on a Ken, but it’s bleeped and a Mattel logo appears over her mouth when she says it. (There’s also saucy language in Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice’s “Barbie World,” which plays over the credits.)\n\n'Barbie' review: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling dazzle in hilariously heady toy story\n\nDoes ‘Barbie’ have excessive violence?\n\nThe physical altercations are all fairly cartoonish. Barbie has her butt smacked and ends up punching the guy, which leads to her being arrested. (Consent is important, kids!) And there’s a civil war among the Kens that breaks out, leading to an action scene where they swing plastic tennis rackets each other, shoot arrows with suction-cup tips, and bump chests with a macho swagger.\n\nIs ‘Barbie’ a positive experience overall?\n\nIt is! In addition to being hilarious and kind of a blast, “Barbie” is an endearing and thought-provoking comedy with a bunch of good messaging as it pertains to feminism, identity, toxic masculinity, self-confidence and loving yourself. Moms and daughters will find things to bond over, as it juggles nostalgia and contemporary issues, dads and sons can reflect on if they’re being a total Ken or not, and if your kids are mature enough, “Barbie” has plenty to chew on in a candy-colored confection."
