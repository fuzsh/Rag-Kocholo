        "text": "Apple has released the fifth developer beta of iOS 18, introducing several new features and updates that enhance the user experience. This latest version focuses on refining key aspects of the operating system, with Distraction Control and Photos app tweaks standing out among the updates.\n\nDistraction Control: A Game Changer\n\nOne of the most significant additions in iOS 18 Beta 5 is Distraction Control. This feature allows users to hide distracting elements on webpages in Safari, such as ads and banners, with just a tap. It offers a smoother browsing experience by eliminating clutter and enhancing focus. Although this feature was not highlighted during WWDC, it has quickly become a favorite among beta testers.\n\nPhotos App Improvements\n\nThe Photos app has also received several changes. The removal of the top Carousel, which displayed highlighted memories and pinned content, is a notable update. While some users may miss this feature, the change allows for more photos to be visible on the screen without scrolling. Additionally, the app now displays recently saved content in the Recent Days collection, and customization options have been enhanced.\n\niOS 18 Beta 5 includes updates to dark mode icons for apps like Maps and Find My. The Maps icon now features only a blue arrow and road, removing other colors, while the Find My icon has a darker background. Other interface adjustments include changes to the Home Screen editing options and updates to the Control Center icons."
