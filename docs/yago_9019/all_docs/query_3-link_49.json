        "text": "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American western film, released in 1969, that was a classic of the genre, especially noted for the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular outlaws.\n\nButch Cassidy (played by Newman) and his companion in crime, the Sundance Kid (Redford), find that the ease they once enjoyed robbing banks and trains is rapidly coming to an end. Increasing security measures and bounties on their heads lead them—along with Sundance’s love interest, Etta Place (Katharine Ross)—to flee to Bolivia. Life there initially proves to be lucrative, even though neither outlaw knows Spanish. However, they soon face the same obstacles and persistent pressure from law enforcement that they had to endure in the United States. Their brief stint as payroll guards ends in violence, and the two men return to their lives of crime—with inevitably tragic results.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz"
