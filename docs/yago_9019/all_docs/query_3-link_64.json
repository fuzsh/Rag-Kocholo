        "text": "Summer is winding down, but you may still need to lean on our list of the best kids movies on Netflix right now for another few weeks. Fortunately, we’ve got you covered with regular updates of Netflix’s extensive collection of kid-friendly movies.\n\nThis month is a bit slower than others, but we’ve still got a Dr. Seuss double dip that the kids will enjoy, as Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat and The Lorax join the platform.\n\nWe’ve also rounded up the best kids movies on Hulu, the best kids movies on Amazon Prime Video, and the best kids movies on Disney+ if you don’t find what you’re looking for on Netflix.\n\nRecently added to Netflix\n\nThe Lorax\n\npg 2012\n\nThe Lorax (2012)\n\n46%\n\npg\n\n86m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Family\n\nStars\n\nDanny DeVito, Ed Helms, Zac Efron\n\nDirected by\n\nChris Renaud\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nA slight twist on the classic children’s book, Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax follows 12-year-old Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) as he ventures beyond his completely artificial world to capture a “real tree” to show to the girl of his dreams, Audrey (Taylor Swift). To do so, he must find the Once-ler (Ed Helms), who knows all about trees, but who also has information about an even more important fellow who knows all about the natural world: the Lorax (Danny DeVito).\n\nThe Cat in the Hat (2003)\n\n19%\n\npg\n\n81m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Adventure, Family, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nMike Myers, Dakota Fanning, Spencer Breslin\n\nDirected by\n\nBo Welch\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThis 2003 live action adaptation of Dr. Seuss’ most beloved book is fairly polarizing, evidenced by its jaw-droppingly bad 19% critic score and respectable 6.0 user score on Metacritic. Really, it kind of comes down to how you feel about Mike Myers, who goes all out as the titular hat-donning feline. When Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally’s (The Equalizer 3‘s Dakota Fanning) is out on a rainy day, they and their pet fish are visited by the mischievous Cat in the Hat. What soon seems like fun quickly devolves into mayhem as the Cat appears to have no off button.\n\nTrolls Band Together (2023)\n\n53%\n\npg\n\n91m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Family, Music, Fantasy, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nAnna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Camila Cabello\n\nDirected by\n\nWalt Dohrn\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe latest release in Dreamworks’ popular Trolls universe hit theaters in 2023. In Trolls Band Together, Branch (Justin Timberlake) and Poppy (Anna Kendrick) are finally a couple, but there’s little time for fun after Branch’s brother, Floyd (Troye Sivan), is kidnapped by pop-star villains for his musical talent. As the pair set out to save Floyd, Poppy learns more about Branch’s dark familial past.\n\nPAW Patrol: The Movie (2021)\n\n50%\n\ng\n\n86m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Family, Adventure, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nIain Armitage, Lilly Bartlam, Will Brisbin\n\nDirected by\n\nCal Brunker\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe beloved children’s show hits the big screen as Ryder (Will Brisbin) and his team of heroic pups must rise to the challenge to take on Humdinger (Ron Pardo) after he becomes Mayor of Adventure City. The pups must face their pasts, make new allies, test out exciting new gadgets and gear, and join together to save Adventure City.\n\nBig Fat Liar (2002)\n\n36%\n\nNaN/10\n\npg\n\n88m\n\nGenre\n\nFamily, Comedy, Adventure\n\nStars\n\nFrankie Muniz, Paul Giamatti, Amanda Bynes\n\nDirected by\n\nShawn Levy\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nA classic for millennial parents, Big Fat Liar takes the kid versus adult conceit to new heights. When Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) accidentally leaves his class paper in the car of sleazy Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (The Holdovers star Paul Giamatti), he soon recognizes his work in Wolf’s next blockbuster movie. The movie, called Big Fat Liar, has Jason’s fingerprints all over it, and now he must prove that Wolf stole his ideas.\n\nNimona (2023)\n\n75%\n\npg\n\n99m\n\nGenre\n\nAdventure, Animation, Fantasy, Family\n\nStars\n\nChloë Grace Moretz, Riz Ahmed, Eugene Lee Yang\n\nDirected by\n\nNick Bruno, Troy Quane\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nBased on the graphic novel of the same name, this Netflix original stars Chloë Grace Moretz as the voice of Nimona, a shape-shifting teen outcast. But when celebrity knight Ballister Boldheart (Riz Ahmed) is framed for the murder of the Queen, Nimona is perhaps the only person who can help clear his name. Unfortunately, she is also perhaps a monster that he has sworn an oath to destroy.\n\nSmurfs: The Lost Village (2017)\n\n40%\n\npg\n\n89m\n\nGenre\n\nFamily, Adventure, Animation, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nDemi Lovato, Rainn Wilson, Joe Manganiello\n\nDirected by\n\nKelly Asbury\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nThe most recent CGI foray into Smurfville, Smurfs: The Lost Village, follows Smurfette (Demi Lovato) and her friends Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty (Danny Pudi, Jack McBrayer, Joe Manganiello) on a thrilling race through the Forbidden Forest to discover a mysterious lost village before the evil wizard Gargamel (The Office star Rainn Wilson) can. In that village lies the key to one of the greatest secrets the Smurfs will ever discover.\n\nOrion and the Dark (2024)\n\n72%\n\npg\n\n93m\n\nGenre\n\nAnimation, Family, Comedy, Fantasy\n\nStars\n\nJacob Tremblay, Paul Walter Hauser, Angela Bassett\n\nDirected by\n\nSean Charmatz\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nIn this Netflix animated original, you’ll meet Orion (Jacob Tremblay), a seemingly typical elementary school kid. But this is merely a facade, as Orion is secretly a bundle of adolescent anxiety, filled with irrational fears of everything from bees and dogs to clowns and cliffs. But the thing he’s most afraid of is one he can’t avoid: the dark.
