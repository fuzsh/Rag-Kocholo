        "text": "What I love about sports-themed movies is how often they leave us feeling inspired, educated, challenged, motivated, or simply entertained. The list below is filled with films about overcoming adversity to beat the odds, breaking down racial and cultural barriers, or standing together for a more significant cause. And because the sports world is easy to spoof, a few hilarious comedies are thrown in if you just need to laugh. Here is my list of the 54 best sports movies for families.\n\n57 SPORTS MOVIES FOR THE FAMILY\n\nKICKING & SCREAMING (2005) PG: Will Ferrell is hilarious in this comedy that has become a classic in our home. Former Bear’s coach Mike Ditka helps Ferrell coach a ragtag soccer team against his overachieving Dad. Fun for all members of the family. It teaches the important life lesson that winning isn’t everything.\n\nMILLION DOLLAR ARM (2014) PG: A self-absorbed sports agent goes to India hoping to transform Indian cricket players into Major league baseball pitchers. It’s a great story about what it’s like to be different. Also, give the kids a little education on Indian culture.\n\nMCFARLAND USA (2015) PG: Big-budget Disney film based on the true story of Jim White, a down-on-his-luck coach played by Kevin Costner, who lands a job in the poor and predominately Latino city of McFarland, CA. Costner turns an unlikely group of high school boys into one of the best cross-country teams.

Lots of laughs and life lessons about determination, drive, and friendship.\n\nHOOSIERS (1986) PG: Many call this the best sports movie ever made.

Must watch film about an underdog coach and a team that defies the odds and goes to the Indiana State finals. Starring Gene Hackman, Barbara Hershey, and Dennis Hopper.\n\nPELE (2016) PG: I watched this movie on the plane trip back from the Rio Olympics and fell in love with it. It is the rags-to-riches story of one of Brazil’s iconic soccer players, Pele. I was struck by the financial, social, and racial economics he overcame in the first few decades of his life to become one of the country’s national treasures. If you even like soccer a little bit, this will entertain you.\n\nFIELD OF DREAMS (1989) PG: Classic baseball movie starring Kevin Costner as an Iowa farmer who builds a baseball field in his cornfield that is visited by the ghost of baseball’s past. It’s a great movie that also teaches some baseball history.\n\nTHE NATURAL (1984) PG: Arguably one of the best baseball movies ever made. Nominated for four Academy Awards. Starring Robert Redford. It is a beautifully shot movie that tells the story of success and failure through the game of baseball. One note. Make sure you have enough time for this one. It is long, running 2 hours and 18 minutes.\n\nRUDY (1993) PG: Legendary movie. Undersized Rudy overcomes the odds to play football for Notre Dame. This movie is timeless, a family favorite and a fun way to see Notre Dame Stadium.\n\nHEAVEN CAN WAIT (1978) PG: One of my all-time favorites. Old school movie. Warren Beatty becomes Quarterback Joe Pendleton of the L.A. Rams after he accidentally gets taken to heaven too soon by an over-eager angel.\n\nMIRACLE (2004) PG: this movie is a good history lesson on one the greatest moments in sports history, “The Miracle on Ice”.

Rocky Balboa is chosen to take on the reigning world heavyweight champion.\n\nSPACE JAM (1996) PG: Michael Jordan plays basketball with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the rest of the looney toons. It’s kind of a silly, mindless movie that will entertain the kids.\n\nCHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981) PG: Academy Award Best Picture.

John Candy stars as the former disgraced champion tasked with coaching them. Loosely based on a true story.\n\nFOR FAMILIES WITH OLDER KIDS\n\nFORD V FERRARI (2019) PG-13: I thought this movie was excellent, but it is long. So start it early and make some extra popcorn. It is based on the real-life story of the battle between automakers Ford and Ferrari and a famous American car maker and his British driver. The racing scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat and the story will keep you engaged.\n\nBATTLE OF THE SEXES (2017) PG-13: The story of the legendary tennis match between women’s #1 player Billy Jean King and former men’s champion Bobby Riggs who didn’t think a woman could beat him. Though it is about an event in 1973, the film addresses themes of equality and gender inequity that are still relevant issues today.\n\nPEANUT BUTTER FALCON (2019) PG-13: A tender film about a boy with Down syndrome who runs away from his home to find the professional wrestler he admires from watching on TV. Along the way, he creates a friendship with a small-time outlaw on the run who becomes his coach. An unlikely friendship and bond forms and the result is an uplifting ad inspirational film.\n\nEDDIE THE EAGLE (2016) PG-13: Sweet, feel-good movie. Based on the real-life story of a British ski jumper who refused to give up on his unlikely Olympic dream.\n\nDODGEBALL (2004) PG-13: This is a total goofball, slapstick comedy. But it is hilarious. Starting Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller…need I say more.\n\nHOOP DREAMS (1984) PG-13: The basketball documentary was primarily financed by PBS. It’s the real-life story of two young basketball players trying to escape their poor Chicago neighborhood.\n\nBLADES OF GLORY PG-13 (2007): a slightly raunchy movie starring Will Farrell. My kids think this slapstick comedy is hysterical. It is a silly spoof on pairs figure skating that includes sexual humor and language.\n\nFREE SOLO (2018 )PG-13: I took the whole family to see this when it was in the theaters. It is a fantastic documentary. Rated PG-13 for some language, but maybe more because of the underlying reality at the heart of the film…one wrong step and its main character will die. I remain in awe of climber Alex Hannod’s courage, focus, and drive. What he does in this film is considered by some to be the greatest athletic achievement of all time.\n\nSEA BISCUIT (2003) PG-13: An unlikely horse becomes a champion and a symbol of hope for Americans during the great depression.\n\nMONEYBALL (2011) PG-13: Before analytics were a thing in sports, Oakland A’s General Manager, Billy Beane, started using statistics to build a roster. Based on a real-life story, this is an entertaining and intriguing movie about the business of baseball and how numbers and stats are being increasingly used in sports.\n\nRACE (2016) PG-13: An inspiring film based on the true-life story of Jessie Owens. This is the story of an unlikely champion, a black man, standing up to the racial prejudice of Nazi Germany in 1936.\n\nCOACH CARTER (2005) PG-13: We should all watch this one as a reminder that school is more important than sports. It is based on the true story of a basketball coach played by Samuel L. Jackson, who shuts down his team’s championship season when their grades slip.\n\nBEND IT LIKE BECKHAM (2002) PG-13: A coming-of-life story about an Indian Girl playing soccer in England even though her family disapproves.\n\n42 (2013) PG-13: The story of sports icon Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball’s color barriers as the first African American to play professional baseball. It is an inspirational story that all Americans should know. One note: the N-word is used throughout the film to represent how Robinson was spoken to authentically. For me, it was an opportunity to discuss the world’s history and what it represents today with my children.\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) PG-13: The story of a football-obsessed small town in Texas. Struggles, challenges, and life lessons unfold through a story about football. The film handles alcoholism, accepting your parents, dealing with failure, and taking charge of your destiny.\n\nUNDEFEATED (2011) PG-13: Academy Award winner for best documentary feature. It tells the story of the struggles of a high school football team in Memphis, trying to win after many losing seasons. The film earned high critical acclaim by many.\n\nTHE BLIND SIDE (2009) PG-13: Semi-biographical film about NFL Player Michael Oher and his impoverished upbringing and his adoption. Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for Best Actress for portraying the woman who took Oher in and helped him become a first-round draft pick in the NFL. It’s a feel-good Hollywood movie. More than a decade after the movie was made, in real life, Oher disputed his adoption and the feel-good nature of the story.\n\nINVICTUS (2009) PG-13: A film about how sports can bring people together. The incredible real-life story of how Nelson Mandela joined with the captain of South Africa’s rugby team to help unite a country with deep racial wounds.\n\nCONCUSSION (2015) PG-13: it takes a little while for this film to get going, but it is an interesting look into one doctor’s struggle to make public his findings on CTE in football players. The subject matter is timely, focussing so much on the effects of head injuries in sports. It stars Will Smith.\n\nTHE ENDLESS SUMMER (1966): For our So. Cal kids. It’s the most epic and legendary surf film ever. The documentary is about 2 friends searching the world, including surf spots in Hawaii, Australia, and South Africa, for “The Perfect Wave.” In 2002, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant”.\n\nWIMBLEDON (2004) PG-13: This movie is a little cheesy but still a heartwarming romantic comedy worth watching. It is about a tennis player at the back end of his career who finds inspiration from a female player on the women’s circuit. It’s predictable but nice.\n\nFIGHTING WITH FAMILY (2018) PG-13: To follow her dreams of becoming a WWE Wrestling star, a young woman has to leave her close-knit and quirky British family behind. Starring Florence Pugh. It is a great movie based on a true story, some crude and sexual adult behavior and heavy issues, including drug use.\n\nJERRY MAGUIRE (1996) R: This and The Way back are the only R-rated movies on the list, but I had to include them. One of the best sports movies of all time starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. Partly inspired by Leigh Steinberg, the real-life agent of Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, before Steinberg experienced a fall from grace and underwent his successful reinvention. This is the story of an agent fueled by ego and money who is forced to reinvent himself and finds love and meaning along the way…which, ironically, more than twenty years after it was made, is actually now the real-life story of Steinberg.\n\nTHE WAY BACK (2020) R: A washed-up and beaten-down former high school basketball star who has lost his way gets a shot at redemption. Starring Ben Affleck. Sexual references and language throughout the film."
