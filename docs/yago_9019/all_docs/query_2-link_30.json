        "text": "Fireworks, freedom, fun — for kids, the Fourth of July is one of the most dazzling holidays that’s wrapped up in core summer memories. It’s an opportunity to talk about America’s history (and how America can do better!). But one of my favorite things to do with my family (after we eat hot dogs by the pool and light sparklers, of course) is settle down with a patriotic movie.\n\nFrom action movies like Independence Day — literally named after this holiday — to more feel-good films like A League of Their Own, there are so many choices for holiday streaming. Even younger kids can enjoy movies like An American Tail or Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front. And if you want your Fourth of July movie marathon to be educational there’s no better choice than America’s Heart & Soul or Who We Are: A Chronicle of Racism In America.\n\nThen, of course, there’s the quintessential Fourth of July film about the inaugural holiday, told through amazing hip-hop music in the musical Hamilton. It’s a great refresher on our Founding Fathers, including one immigrant who had a huge impact on our nation’s treasury.\n\nPop some popcorn, put on your best red, white, and blue, and get ready for a fun, family-friendly movie night this Independence Day! It just might become your new favorite family tradition. To learn more about the aforementioned movies and others that are great for streaming with young kids and teens this Fourth of July, read on."
