        "text": "Rating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nOpens locally April 1st, 2011 (exclusively at the Maple Art in Bloomfield Hills)\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 46 minutes, Not Rated\n\nStarring: Juliette Binoche, William Shimell\n\n​Written & Directed by Abbas Kiarostami (Taste of Cherry, Through the Olive Trees)\n\n​\"Certified Copy\" is certifiably pretentious. That's not to say that I didn't like it, I did. It's the kind of movie though, that can be viewed like a work of art. To some, it signifies brilliance, and artistic mastery. To others, you just stare at the canvas and think, \"what the heck is that?\"\n\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Coutroom Drama, Thriller/Suspense\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 18th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 59 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Matthew McConaughey, Marisa Tomei, Ryan Phillippe, William H. Macy\n\nDirected by Brad Furman (The Take)\n\n​Product placement has been a growing trend in films and movie over the past decade, but none that I can recall have been more blatant than \"The Lincoln Lawyer.\" You may read reviews of this film that describe the plot as \"A lawyer conducts business from the back of his Lincoln town car...\", but this is totally irrelevant to the plot of the film. See the posters for this film? There's a Lincoln Continental in it. And in every trailer. Does the main character, Matthew McConaughey have a Lincoln in the movie? Yes. Does this matter at all? No. It would be like renaming it \"A Clockwork Sunkist Orange\" or \"Reese's Pieces E.T.\" I fear that this may be the future, where we'll get films like \"Fried Green Heinz Tomatoes,\" or similar titles pushing product even before we reach the theatre.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Comedy, Sci-Fi\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 18th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 44 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Seth Rogen (voice), Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader\n\nWritten by Simon Pegg & Nick Frost\n\nDirected by Greg Motolla (Superbad, Adventureland)\n\n​I'll start very short and simply: If you are a fan of anything science-fiction released in the last 60 years, be it movies, TV, comic books, radio, or novels, by all means go see \"Paul.\" For those on the fringe (no sci-fi pun intended), \"Paul\" still works as a clever, but overly absurd buddy comedy that appeals to the geek in all of us.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 18th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 18 minutes, Not Rated\n\nDirected by Julia Bacha\n\n​The best entries in the Documentary genre often open our eyes to a little known way of life, and put a spotlight on a portion of humanity that we are not always well-educated on. They uncover the harsh realities of the world we live in while at the same time leaving us with a sense of hope and inspiration to actually get off our butts and do something. In the new documentary “Budrus”, all of these are directives are accomplished, leaving us with one of the better documentary films in quite some time.\n\nRating: 1 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Animated, SciFi/Fantasy\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 11th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 28 minutes, Rated PG\n\nStarring (voice & motion-capture): Seth Green, Dan Fogler, Mindy Sterling, Joan Cusack\n\nDirected by Simon Wells (Balto, The Prince of Egypt, The Time Machine)\n\n​Animated films aimed at kids are a tricky topic: I mean, kids will watch Baby Einstein, or any other slew of mindless \"entertainment\" on TV. It's one thing to plop your child down in front of the television, as some of these types of shows (Baby Einstein again for example), are educational and helpful in the growth of a young mind. But in a children's movie, a different level of entertainment is required, since the parent must sit through the movie alongside their child in the theatre. So with that in mind, there is a wide spectrum of \"kids movies\" that are thrown at us. On one hand, you get great family movies that include humor for kids and adults alike (think Lion King, The Little Mermaid, or more recently Tangled), that not only keep us entertained but include valuable lessons important for children to learn and for adults to remember. And on the other hand, you get movies like \"Mars Needs Moms\", a painfully unfunny and unimportant \"family film\" completely void of any redeeming life lessons. It will likely make you wish you had been abducted by aliens on the way into the theatre.\n\nRating: 2 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Action/Adventure, Horror\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 11th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 39 minutes, Rated PG-13\n\nStarring: Amanda Seyfried, Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Virginia Madsen, Julie Christie\n\nDirected by Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight, Lords of Dogtown, Thirteen)\n\n​It's been a rough stretch for movies the past few weeks, as I don't think I've even handed out the mediocre \"3 out of 5 star\" rating in over a month. This incarnation of \"Red Riding Hood\" looked like it had promise to be an entertaining and dark spin on the classic fairy tale. But unfortunately, it is just another serving of slop in the long line of winter films being flushed from the studio's system.\n\nRating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Drama, Spanish (sub-titled)\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 11th, 2011, exclusively at the Main Art in Royal Oak\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 44 minutes, Not Rated\n\nStarring: Luis Tosar, Gael Garcia Bernal, Raul Arevalo, Karra Elejalde\n\nDirected by Iciar Bollain\n\n\"Even the Rain\" is a compelling drama set in Cochabamba, Bolivia. It was Spain's entry into the Best Foreign Language Film category at this year's Oscars, making the short list of 9 but failing to land a nomination. It deserved one, and is definitely a film worth seeing, especially with the horrendous, awful films released by the major studios in the past few weeks (think Hall Pass, Red Riding Hood, Take Me Home Tonight, and Mars Needs Moms to name a few).\n\nRating: 1 out of 5 stars\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nOpens locally Friday, March 4th, 2011\n\nRun Time: 1 hour, 37 minutes, Rated R\n\nStarring: Topher Grace, Teresa Palmer, Anna Faris, Dan Fogler\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse\n\n​The 1980s seem to be the hot thing right now…most recently brilliantly spoofed in last year’s “Hot Tub Time Machine” amongst other films. With “Take Me Home Tonight” we get a comedy that wants to be an 80s teen throwback movie, in the vein of “Fast Times”, “Ferris Bueller” or “Weird Science.” It’s a throwback all right…a forgettable teen comedy that is embarrassingly bad, even by back-then standards.\n\nBefore we get to the review, if you missed my interview with stars Topher Grace and Demetri Martin, you can find it here."
