        "text": "New Kids on the Block announced their first album of new material in 11 years on Tuesday morning (March 5), Still Kids, which will be released through BMG on May 17.\n\nThe 14-track album was previewed via the mid-tempo single “Kids,” which was co-written and co-produced by David Stewart (BTS, Jack Harlow) and Luke Batt (Katie Melua); the song’s video, directed by Marissa Velez, will premiere on YouTube at 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and the live premiere will take place on The Kelly Clarkson Show on Friday (March 8) during an NKOTB episode takeover.\n\nA release announcing the follow-up to the band’s 2013 studio album 10 promises that the eight full-length from Jonathan Knight, Jordan Knight, Joey McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg and Danny Wood is “full of pop anthems, dance tracks, love songs and grooves that will become fast favorites for the Blockheads.”\n\nThe bouncy “Kids” single features a look-back chorus from the long-running boy band — who are all in their early 50s — on which they sing, “And we’re still just kids from a nobody town/ Still just kids that are messing around/ Making the most of the things that we found.”\n\n“It’s the most mature album we’ve ever made,” said the project’s creative director Wahlberg in a statement; the singer co-wrote seven of the tracks on the album with longtime collaborator Lars Halvor Jensen. “Yet it’s the most fun and most comfortable album we’ve ever made… This album, more than any other, is bringing the New Kids and the fans full circle. It’s about hope and possibilities and being ourselves.” The collection has features from DJ Jazzy Jeff on “Get Down” and Taylor Dayne on “Old School Love.”\n\nMcIntyre — who co-wrote six of the tracks with songwriter/producer Sean Thomas — added, “It says a lot about any band to make a record that has energy and passion and lightness and fun and depth – after almost 40 years together? It’s crazy.”\n\nListen to “Kids” below and check out the album tracklist and NKOTB Magic Summer 2024 tour dates.\n\nStill Kids track list:\n\nMagic Summer 2024 North American tour dates (with DJ Jazzy Jeff and Taylor Dayne):\n\nJune 14 — Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center\n\nJune 15 — Tinley Park, IL @ Credit Union 1 Amphitheatre\n\nJune 18 — Clarkston, MI @ Pine Knob Music Theatre\n\nJune 19 — Burgettstown, PA @ The Pavilion at Star Lake\n\nJune 21 — Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center\n\nJune 22 — Maryland Heights, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre\n\nJune 23 — Prior Lake, MN @ Mystic Lake Amphitheatre\n\nJune 25 — Bonner Springs, KS @ Azura Amphitheater\n\nJune 26 — Rogers, AR @ Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion\n\nJune 28 — Denver, CO @ Ball Arena\n\nJune 29 — Salt Lake City, UT @ USANA Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 2 — Wheatland, CA @ Toyota Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 3 — Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 5 — Ivine, CA @ FivePoint Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 7 — Chula Vista, CA @ North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 9 — Phoenix, AZ @ Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 10 — Albuqureque, NM @ Isleta Amphitheater\n\nJuly 12 — Del Valle, TX @ Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nJuly 13 — The Woodlands, TX @ The Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\nJuly 14 — Dallas, TX @ Dos Equis Pavilion\n\nJuly 16 — Franklin, TN @ FirstBank Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 19 — Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 20 — West Palm Beach, FL @ iTHINK Financial Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 21 — Jacksonville, FL @ Dailey Amphitheater\n\nJuly 25 — Charleston, SC @ CreditOne Stadium\n\nJuly 26 — Alpharetta, GA @ Ameris Bank Amphitheatre\n\nJuly 27 — Charlotte, NC @ PNC Music Pavilion\n\nJuly 28 — Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek\n\nAugust 1 — Virginia Beach, VA @ Veterans United Home Loans Amphitheater\n\nAugust 2 — Hartford, CT @ XFINITY Theatre\n\nAugust 3 — Hershey, PA @ Hersheypark Stadium\n\nAugust 4 — Wantagh, NY @ Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater\n\nAugust 8 — Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Art Center\n\nAugust 9 — Gilford, NH @ Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion\n\nAugust 10 — Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center\n\nAugust 11 — Saratoga Springs, NY @ Saratoga Performing Arts Center\n\nAugust 15 — Philadelphia, PA @ Mann Center for the Performing Arts\n\nAugust 16 — Columbia, MD @ Merriweather Post Pavilion\n\nAugust 17 — Toronto, ON @ Budweiser Stage\n\nAugust 22 — Darien Center, NY @ Darien Lake Amphitheater\n\nAugust 23 — Columbus, OH @ Nationwide Arena\n\nAugust 24 — Milwaukee, WI @ American Family Insurance Amphitheater\n\nAugust 25 — Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Music Center"
