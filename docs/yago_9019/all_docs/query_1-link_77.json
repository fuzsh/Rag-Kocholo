I didn’t think I was going to have as much fun as I did with this one, but I did. Out of the few comedies I’ve reviewed this summer, The Dead Don’t Die (2019) and The Fall of the American Empire (2018), Stuber (2019) has been my favorite for sure! I laughed my cheeks off, both sets, throughout the whole film. At certain points in the film I was literally wiping tears of joy from my face. As you have probably gathered… the comedy is great. The action in the film, even for a comedy, is pretty solid. From beginning to end Stuber never takes its foot off the gas! Alright guys let’s open up the app and select our ride!\n\nContinue reading ‘Need a Ride? Let’s Go With Stuber! (Movie Review)’\n\n‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’ Puts The FUN in Travel! (Movie Review)\n\nIt’s not like you didn’t know they were making another Spider-Man movie, right? This feat was solidified inevitable. For those that are counting this is also the twenty-third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). What makes this one interesting is the fact that it’s the first film out of the gate that follows the record smashing Avengers: Endgame. I hope you don’t have to ask me why that is so intriguing, but just in case you do I’m going to do the unthinkable. For the uninitiated I’ll spoil the beans right here in the very first paragraph. It’s because of the fact that so many game changing events went down in Endgame. Therefore, Spider-Man: Far From Home is the start of something new from a certain point of view. That mainly stems from the fact that we’re supposedly 5 years into the future here. Right? Well, that’s what I’m most interested in seeing how they handle. So replenish your web fluid and sling on down below with me as I tackle this subject and more. Continue reading ‘‘Spider-Man: Far From Home’ Puts The FUN in Travel! (Movie Review)’\n\nThe Fall of the American Empire and the Fall of Crime Dramas (Movie Review)\n\nOne thing I don’t want to do in the movie theater is read. However, when you sit down to a Canadian french speaking film with english subtitles you’re kind of locked in. The Fall of the American Empire is a film that I was very much unfamiliar with, but was willing to give a shot. The film gives us a typical “what would you do with the money?” scenario involving a large sum of cash suddenly coming into the possession of our “Average Joe” protagonist. The premise is appealing due to its juxtaposing themes of morality and desire. The allure of money, and the power that comes with it, is a tale as old as time. Watching what money does to a character is fascinating. It’s like a car crash… you just can’t look away. The transformation of said character is something that an audience cannot help, but to be tuned into. I was very much along for the ride. I was on the edge of my seat while I nervously watched the protagonist dodge the law scene after scene. The possibility of being caught red-handed loomed around every corner. However, disappointment struck when I least expected it. Alright guys hurry up and grab a duffle bag of cash the review is coming! Continue reading ‘The Fall of the American Empire and the Fall of Crime Dramas (Movie Review)’\n\nRom Com Fest 2019 – Five Features & Six Short Film Reviews\n\nThere’s a wrap on the 1st ever Rom Com Fest 2019 (go to www.romcomfest.com) and what an event it was. Desserts were plentiful, tears ran rampant and love was truly in the air. But before we bid a fond farewell to the to films that make our hearts swoon, I’m taking a critical look back at the latest flicks that unspooled this year for your maximum review coverage reading. Consisting of five features and six shorts all within the realm of romance and hilarity here are the skinny on the films that made up this year’s fest an unforgettable one. Here are my…Rom Com Fest 2019 Reviews.\n\nContinue reading ‘Rom Com Fest 2019 – Five Features & Six Short Film Reviews’\n\n‘The Dead Don’t Die’… And Neither Does Comedy! (Movie Review)\n\nThe Dead Don’t Die… this movie came out of nowhere for me. This was not a highly anticipated film for me in the slightest. However, the film was a nice change of pace from the usual comic book flick, big action movie, or occasional remake that usually clutters the Summer box office. The Dead Don’t Die is fun! The cast is great! The acting, though wooden, works for the film these actors are in. As entertained as I was there were points during the film that I almost felt tempted to check its pulse… this one does drag a little with the pacing. To get a better idea let’s hop in the car, put on a little Sturgill Simpson, and head to Centerville to see why the dead don’t want to die!\n\nContinue reading ‘‘The Dead Don’t Die’… And Neither Does Comedy! (Movie Review)’\n\n‘Shaft’ Sticks You With Slapstick Comedy & Action ‘Bad Boys’ Style! (Movie Review)\n\nShaft is a film I never thought I’d be seeing theatrically, but I honestly could not help myself. The trailer looked so hysterically funny that I had to give it a try. I guess I’m weak like that. However, what’s very confusing, even to me (shocker!), is the fact that this one is simply called Shaft. Wasn’t there a Samuel Jackson flick back in 2000 called Shaft? Don’t worry. We’ll cover that and more as we move into paragraph two down below. For now just feel rest assured that you’re in good hands in this review and this 2019 entry is all part of the same happy family. Alright, let’s talk about it all now.\n\nContinue reading ‘‘Shaft’ Sticks You With Slapstick Comedy & Action ‘Bad Boys’ Style! (Movie Review)’\n\nDark Phoenix Soars Above My Low Expectations (Movie Review)\n\nDark Phoenix, the end of Fox’s X-Men franchise, can’t come and go quick enough in my opinion. The longevity of Fox’s X-Men pictures produced some outstanding entries like Logan, The Wolverine, Day’s of Future Past, First Class and the very first two releases. However, it also produced some serious stinkers like the third one (Last Stand), the Wolverine’s origin story and most recently Apocalypse. I could honestly care less if New Mutants EVER sees the light of day, but we’re not here to talk about that one. We’re here to chat about Dark Phoenix, a redundant story that I don’t think is worth re-telling, but we’re here again nonetheless this time with the younger class (their final onscreen adventure together). I know many of you, like my good friend Robert, will consider what I just said as blasphemy, but that’s the power of opinion. We’re each capable of forming one. I paid homage to the ones I loved, but I’m ready for this franchise to die and what better way than a fiery death with a character I could care less about, Jean Grey. Continue reading ‘Dark Phoenix Soars Above My Low Expectations (Movie Review)’\n\nGodzilla King of the Monsters & The Age of The Titans Has Come! (Movie Review)\n\nGodzilla King of the Monsters has been one of my most anticipated movies of the year, besides Avengers: Endgame of course. The trailers alone solidified my need to see this film opening weekend. Though the previous installment, Godzilla 2014, did leave me slightly disappointed I was still ecstatic to see this film. So what can I say about Godzilla King of the Monsters? This film is cranked up to eleven! Godzilla’s atomic breath is on full blast against the fearsomely ferocious Monster Zero. The radioactive lizard king and his fellow titans chew up the scenery with every thunderous step, concussive wingbeat, and nostalgic screech! On the ground level we follow some new and some returning human characters among the turmoil. Though the film features a heavy hitting cast with performances from Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, and more, it is clear that the titans are the true show stealers. This is not to say that the human characters weren’t as imposing, but they are a little… well let’s drop in to the no fly zone and see what its all about!\n\nContinue reading ‘Godzilla King of the Monsters & The Age of The Titans Has Come! (Movie Review)’\n\nParty Like A Rockstar at Ma’s House (Movie Review)\n\nI would have to think I’m not along in my thoughts when I say the first time I saw the trailer to Ma I thought to myself, “whoa this is messed up.” it’s nit because of the subject matter onscreen, but because Octavia Spencer is a very capable actress and this story looked like it could really go anywhere in these capable hands, both bad and good of course. There’s also the fact that this movie is going against two behemoth powerhouses, Godzilla and Rocketman, in its opening weekend. So either it has legs and balls or its all flash and just being thrown away. My hopes were obviously on the former pair, but again the trailer doesn’t really let you have much. All I know is I came here to party like the kids in this one in anticipation that Ma delivers. Therefore, that’s what we’re here to talk about today beyond the first paragraph of informatics. Let’s get started! Continue reading ‘Party Like A Rockstar at Ma’s House (Movie Review)’\n\nAvengers: Endgame “Assembles” An Emotionally Charged, Satisfying “End”ing (Movie Review)\n\nAvengers: Endgame is the culmination of 11 years in the making, which spawned some 21 shared universe films before it. It seems like so long ago, but really it has only been a decade and minus only a few lowlights the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has continued to fire on all proverbial cylinders. Despite my love for the DC Comics Expanded Universe (DCEU) even they can’t say the same as MCU’s lucky lightning did not strike twice in their shared universe. I blame the critics and studio on that, but I digress. There will be no more talk of the DCEU, but instead we’re going to focus here on out solely on the MCU and the conclusion of the third phase of the film franchise. Phase 1 ended with 2012’s The Avengers and Phase 2 concluded with the first Ant–Man. And now we’re gathered here to wrap up a bombastic Phase 3 that gave us a whopping 9 entries so far: Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Thor: Ragnarok, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, Ant-Man and the Wasp and most recently Captain Marvel. Continue reading ‘Avengers: Endgame “Assembles” An Emotionally Charged, Satisfying “End”ing (Movie Review)’\n\nShazam!: Recommended For Ages 5 and Up (Movie Review)\n\nI remember seeing the first production stills of Shazam! online and thinking how awful/embarrassing our hero’s inflated muscle outfit looked. Surely this was a joke and they were keeping his real superhero suit under wraps or inserting it digitally later in post. Wrong! Then something happened and I was like whoa this actually looks not only legit, but fun and hysterical as well. That moment I speak of was when the film’s first theatrical trailer dropped. Not only was the inflated muscle bound costume the real thing, but for the first time since I saw those stills I breathed a sigh of relief. This feature looked like a blast. Couple that with the initial wave of early reviews that were not only favorable, but claiming this was one of the best DCEU movies yet and you had my attention dripping whet with anticipation. So here we are! Continue reading ‘Shazam!: Recommended For Ages 5 and Up (Movie Review)’\n\nWelcome to Acapulco (Movie Review)\n\nVideo game designer Matt Booth has one shot to save his career by unveiling his biggest project yet at the Video Game Awards in New Mexico. But after running into a friend at the airport and having a little too much to drink before his flight, he ends up in ACTUAL Mexico – specifically, Acapulco. As soon as he lands, he finds himself on the run from high-powered criminals, deadly hitmen and the Feds, all looking for a mysterious package that he has allegedly smuggled through customs yet knows nothing about. Partnering with a badass, beautiful femme-fatale and channeling his inner video game action hero, the pair unravels a conspiracy that could shake the foundation of the United States, maybe even the world. Continue reading ‘Welcome to Acapulco (Movie Review)’\n\n‘Hotel Mumbai’ Delivers Intensity (Movie Review)\n\nIn 2008, a small but potent group of terrorists launched a well-coordinated, multi-wave attack on specific targets within the Indian city of Mumbai. The horrific events took place within a period lasting from November 26th to the 29th. This past weekend, the 123-minute feature film titled Hotel Mumbai, which retells those moments of those awful three days, had its national release. Starring Slumdog Millionaire lead, Dev Patel, along with Anupam Kher, Armie Hammer, Jason Isaacs, and the insanely beautiful Nazanin Boniadi.\n\nContinue reading ‘‘Hotel Mumbai’ Delivers Intensity (Movie Review)’\n\n11:11 – ‘Us’ A Sign of More Good Things To Come From Peele (Movie Review)\n\nThink about this. What if Us exists in our world to solely prove that the formidable sophomore slump does not apply to filmmaker Jordan Peele? It’s entirely quite possible! If Get Out proved that he didn’t need the training wheels on the bike anymore, then Us demonstrates he’s ready for Motorcross. Whoa there! Slow your motors! I normally don’t spill the beans in my reviews until paragraph three or four, but I can’t help it here. I was such a huge fan of Get Out that I was wildly whet with anticipation for Us and rightfully so. When that first trailer dropped are you telling me that Luniz’s song (“I Got 5 On It”) didn’t infect you like the person next to you on the plane blowing snot with flu-like symptoms? I thought so. Now that we’ve established a baseline with what to expect from the following paragraphs of praise (?) let’s talk about Us in much more detail (no spoilers). Continue reading ’11:11 – ‘Us’ A Sign of More Good Things To Come From Peele (Movie Review)’\n\n‘Happy Death Day 2U’ Takes You Back 2 The Future (Movie Review)\n\nHappy Death Day 2U is the sequel everyone saw coming. The Universal cash gods demanded it. You know you wanted it too. Now you got it! Quite frankly I couldn’t be happier having been assigned to cover this feature. Truth be told though I initially dismissed the first Happy Death Day off its theatrical trailer as a modern day ripoff of Groundhog Day, which coincidentally I guess you could say the same thing about the time loop flick Edge of Tomorrow (also known as Live Repeat Die). However, I digress as I never said I make the best decisions in life. While Happy Death Day does utilize the familiar Groundhog Day formula it does so with a slasher twist to it all that us horror moviegoers eat up like buttered popcorn and sugary Twizzlers. Need I say more about why it was made and for whom? I think not. Instead let’s allow my review of it all down below do the talking from here on out. Continue reading ‘‘Happy Death Day 2U’ Takes You Back 2 The Future (Movie Review)’\n\nThe Golem (Film Review)\n\nEvery culture has its own mythological beasts. The Greeks had the Minotaur and Medusa. The Romans had the basilisk. The Chinese had dragons. One particular creature of the human imagination that has often been overlooked in mythology discussions is that of the golem, a creature made of stone or earth summoned to defeat evil…and maybe even go on an unintended murderous rampage. This product of Jewish culture has been traced as far back as the early years of Judaism with more prominent tales of the earthy monster taking place in the 16th and 17th centuries. It sounds like something ripe for the pickings of a movie. Screenwriter Ariel Cohen thought so too.\n\nContinue reading ‘The Golem (Film Review)’\n\nFragile ‘Glass’ Handle With Care (Movie Review)\n\nI can’t say I ever thought the day would come where we’d be living in a world in which an exists a sequel to 2000’s Unbreakable whether lone two of them. I knew there was always interest in the property, but given the downward spiral of M. Night Shayamalan’s career for awhile I never thought we’d see anything spectacular from him again. A movie he wrote in 2010 called Devil semi peaked my curiosity, but imagine my surprise when early reviews of 2016’s Split came with mentions of a tie-in to the Unbreakable universe. That news practically broke the Internet (I’m exaggerating) and even further Split was actually a really great film to boot. James McAvoy got robbed of an Academy nod for his exceptional performance, but I digress. More importantly M. Night was suddenly back! People were instantly in his corner and from the looks of it as we’re gathered here today the third film in the trilogy, Glass, was fast-tracked for our viewing pleasure.\n\nContinue reading ‘Fragile ‘Glass’ Handle With Care (Movie Review)’\n\nJason Coleman’s Top Ten Films Of 2018 (w/Bonus #1 Destroyer Director Karyn Kusama Interview + Jason’s Final Farewell!)\n\nThis is it folks – all good things must eventually come to an end.
