        "text": "Venue: Orpheum\n\nThe Vancouver Civic Theatres Silent Movie Mondays present Go West\n\nEscape to the 1920s silent movie era at the Orpheum theatre! Vancouver Civic Theatres is thrilled to present Silent Movie Mondays, an immersive experience that screens popular silent films accompanied by dramatic music played live on the historic Wurlitzer organ â€“ the last theatre organ in Canada still performing in its original home.\n\nWith little luck at keeping a job in the city a New Yorker heads to the country. Once there, he tries his hand at bronco-busting, cattle wrangling and dairy farming, eventually forming a bond with a cow named Brown Eyes. A classic comedy directed by and starring Buster Keaton, one of the most revered comic actors of the silent age.\n\nFollowing the show, Keith Blackmore of the Vancouver Film School will host a lively discussion about the movie and the role of silent films in the evolution of film history.\n\nJoin us in the West Coast Lounge for a pre-show performance by the Gatsby Strutters Jazz Band.\n\nAll at the historic Orpheum!"
