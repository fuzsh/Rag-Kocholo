        "text": "When the original cast of Studio C left after nine seasons to form their own production company—JK! Studios; a feature film was both a dream and an inevitably for the group. That feature film, Go West, hit theaters in Utah last week. It is a goofy comedy about trekking across the American west, just in time for Pioneer Day.\n\nThe film follows sisters Aveline Jenkins (Natalie Madsen) and Cora Jenkins (Mallory Everton) as they travel from Independence, Missouri westward to stop Aveline’s daughter from marrying an outlaw. A bit of romantic drama ensues when both begin to fall for a fellow traveler in their company, Elijah (Stephen Meek).\n\nChock full of outrageous situations, the film features most of the cast members taking on multiple roles to round out the wild ensemble of this trip west. The style of comedy honors both the family friendly style of comedy their fans have come to expect, as well as the oneupsmanship of thinking a joke has had its punchline and finding out they can get in one more laugh. The cast described it as the “Monty Python of the Oregon Trail”.\n\nThey devised the film by relying on the skillset they’ve honed so carefully over so many years together; sketch writing. After they decided the setting, the group set to work coming up with what added up to be about 30 sketches inspired by the Oregon Trail. From those sketches, they were able to create a plotline that could tie the best ones together.\n\nThe style of humor really did feel like the style of some of the group’s best sketches from their Studio C days. Though it is difficult to sew a patchwork quilt of a film from a series of sketches, I was impressed with how invested I felt in the love triangle and the villain that provided the through-line to bring all of the sketches together. The film had unexpected heart in several places, I even got a little teary once (but only a little). The film’s other great continuity is provided by the narration of Sean Astin of The Lord of Rings fame. He is all too familiar with perilous journeys himself.\n\nI thought when I saw the first trailer, that it was a minefield to take on something as tender and dear to so many in Utah as the pioneers’ journey west. When the sacrifice and determination were so real, what is there to laugh about? Wisely, the film instead follows the Oregon Trail and nods much more to the old computer game with its propensity for surprising you with messages like “You have dysentery” or “Someone in your company stepped on a rattlesnake” than having any kind of commentary on the Mormon pioneers specifically.\n\nThere was only one area of historical significance that I thought they should not have tread on, but otherwise I was pleasantly surprised that they were able to create so many laugh out loud situations about of the trail west without making a viewer like me—who reveres my pioneer ancestors so much–feel defensive or sensitive.\n\nOverall, the film was a great place for a summer laugh. So, if you’re in Utah and you’ve already had your Barbie weekend fill, support local and Go West.\n\nGo West is in theaters across Utah now. It will open in Arizona and Idaho on August 4th and come to theaters nationwide on August 11. To request the film in your city.
