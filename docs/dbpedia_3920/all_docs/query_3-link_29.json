        "text": "“Pam & Tommy” stars Sebastian Stan and Lily James will reunite to star in psychological horror thriller “Let the Evil Go West.”\n\nThe film sounds very different from Stan and James’ previous collaboration, which saw them playing Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson in a Hulu mini-series. In “Let the Evil Go West,” a railroad worker stumbles upon a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.\n\nChristian Tafdrup is set to direct from a screenplay by Xc Vs. The film is produced by Tim and Trevor White (“King Richard”) under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, Mark Fasano and Nathan Klingher for Gramercy Park Media, which is also financing the film, and Allan Mandelbaum. Stan and James will also executive produce along with Gramercy Park’s Joshua Harris and Ford Corbett and north.five.six.’s Michael Rothstein and Samuel Hall.\n\nNorth.five.six. represents the international rights and will introduce the project to international buyers in Cannes. CAA Media Finance and UTA Independent Film Group arranged the financing and will handle the domestic sale.\n\nStan will next star in A24’s “A Different Man,” which premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. He will also hit Cannes, appearing as Donald Trump opposite Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn in Ali Abbassi’s “The Apprentice,” which will premiere in competition and is seeking distribution. He is best known for his role as the Winter Soldier in the “Captain America” and “Avengers” franchises.\n\nJames can next be seen in the upcoming crime comedy film “Greedy People” for Lionsgate, which will also star Joseph Gordon-Levitt and is set to premiere this May, as well as in an upcoming film inspired by the Bumble founder for 20th Century Studios and Ethea Entertainment, which is set to begin shooting later this year. Her other credits include the wrestling drama “The Iron Claw” and “Baby Driver.”\n\nTafdrup is known for directing the Danish psychological thriller “Speak No Evil,” which premiered at Sundance and which the 2024 Universal Pictures film, by the same name, is based on. He will executive produce the remake.\n\nStan is represented by CAA, Brookside Management, Sloane Offer Weber and Relevant. James is repped by Tavistock Wood Management, David Weber and Shelby Weiser. Tafdrup is represented by WME, and Xc Vs by CAA, Kaplan Perone, and Lev Ginsburg."
