        "text": "Mavis's contract stipulates she can't marry for five years, and her studio publicist, Morgan (Warren William), does his best to keep her away from men, including politician Francis X. Harrigan (Lyle Talbot). Along with his professional responsibility, it seems as though some of Morgan's motivation may be personal. During a trip from Washington to Pennsylvania Morgan and Mavis's chauffeured car breaks down, requiring them to stay at a nearby boarding house run by Mrs. Struthers (Alice Brady), her sister Miss Kate (Elizabeth Patterson), and her daughter Joyce (Margaret Perry). Mrs. Struthers also has a very starstruck maid, Gladys (Isabel Jewell).\n\nMavis initially resists having to stay in the middle of nowhere, until she gets a look at hunky Bud Norton (Randolph Scott). She does her best to seduce Bud, to the dismay of both Morgan and Bud's sweetheart Joyce.\n\nIt's looking as though Mavis may succeed in luring Bud to accompany her to Hollywood, but then Gladys hears on the radio that Mavis has been kidnapped and goes to the police...chaos ensues.\n\nI found this movie quite enjoyable, particularly the relationship between Morgan and Mavis. He sees right through her but likes -- loves? -- her anyway, and the pair seems to have fun with a perennial battle of wits as he tries to stop her from having a love life.\n\nThe extended section of the film set at the boarding house is a bit like a country house farce such as THE GOOSE AND THE GANDER (1935) or SNOWED UNDER (1936), but with characters who are (mostly) on a lower economic scale.\n\nGiven the weak male leads of some of West's films, it was a real pleasure to watch her bantering with Warren William, who could more than hold his own opposite the actress. One of the recurring jokes is Mavis's frequent use of malaprops, which Morgan swoops in to smooth over. They have some great dialogue, such as Morgan telling Mavis to think of her reputation, and she replies \"You think of it, that's what you're being paid for.\"\n\nScott is also fine as the earnest Bud, who is frequently oblivious to Mavis's attempts to woo him. Patterson is especially delightful as the maiden aunt who quickly sees through Mavis and works to encourage Joyce while plotting to keep Mavis and Bud from spending time alone.\n\nJewell is also a stitch as the giddy maid. At one point she befuddles Morgan by launching into a very funny impersonation of Marlene Dietrich. Her boyfriend is played by Maynard Holmes, who was unfamiliar to me; it struck me as the kind of role which could have also been played by Grady Sutton or perhaps Sterling Holloway.\n\nThe supporting cast also includes Etienne Girardot, Nicodemus Stewart, Charles Irwin, John Indrisano, and Alyce Ardell.\n\nWhile GO WEST YOUNG MAN isn't a great movie, it's 82 very entertaining minutes. I smiled during much of the film, and you can't ask for more than that from a movie.\n\nGO WEST YOUNG MAN was directed by Henry Hathaway and filmed in black and white by Karl Struss.\n\nThe Kino Lorber print has some softness as well as brief lines in the opening credits, but all in all it's just fine, with no distracting issues. The soundtrack is also good. The disc provides a terrific opportunity to see a fun film.\n\nDisc extras consist of eight trailers for other films available from Kino Lorber, most starring West, and a commentary track by Lee Gambin."
