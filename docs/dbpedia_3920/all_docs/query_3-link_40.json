        "text": "Sebastian Stan and Lily James, stars of the Hulu miniseries Pam & Tommy, are getting back together to topline the psychological horror thriller Let The Evil Go West.\n\nChristian Tafdrup will direct the picture using a script by Xc Vs for Star Thrower Entertainment and Gramercy Park, which is financing the film. And north.five.six, CAA Media Finance and UTA Independent Film Group will launch film sales in Cannes.\n\nLet the Evil Go West centers on a railroad worker who discovers a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.\n\nIn Pam & Tommy, Stan and James played the 1990s couple Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee during a whirlwind marriage over four days in Cancun, where their privately recorded honeymoon sex tape was stolen by a disgruntled electrician and released online.\n\nStan will next star in A24’s A Different Man, which bowed at Sundance, and he plays a young Donald Trump opposite Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn in Ali Abbassi’s The Apprentice, which will premiere in competition in Cannes. James will appear in the upcoming crime comedy film Greedy People for Lionsgate.\n\nTafdrup directed the Danish psychological thriller Speak No Evil, which premiered at Sundance, and he will executive produce Let The Evil Go West with Stan and James. The movie is produced by Tim White, Trevor White, Mark Fasano, Nathan Klingher and Allan Mandelbaum.\n\nStan and James will also executive produce the film along with Joshua Harris, Ford Corbett, Michael Rothstein and Samuel Hall. Stan is represented by CAA and Brookside Management. James is repped by Tavistock Wood Management. Tafdrup is represented by WME, and Xc Vs by CAA."
