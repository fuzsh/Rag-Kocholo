        "text": "Most good American comedy writers and wits would be the first to admit that nothing today can compare with the glory days of Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, George Kaufman, SJ Perelman, Oscar Levant and others too humorous to mention. Among this august company could be placed Irving Brecher, who has died aged 94, although Milton Berle once joked: \"As a writer, Irving Brecher really has no equals. Superiors, yes.\" However, the quip was probably written by Brecher himself - he wrote a lot of Berle's material. Brecher was also credited with the screenplay of two Marx Brothers films, At the Circus (1939) and Go West (1940).\n\nSince his youth, he had been a confirmed Marxist and enjoyed performing his Groucho routine at parties. \"I thought he was the funniest man in the world,\" he recalled. \"When I was asked by MGM producer Mervyn LeRoy to do a picture for the Marx Brothers, I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nBrecher was born in the Bronx. At 19, after a brief stint covering high school sports for a local newspaper, he took a job as an usher at a Manhattan cinema. To fuel his ambition to write for his favourite comedians, he began sending one-liners to columnists Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan, who often used them. Knowing of Berle's self-perpetuated reputation as a joke-stealer, he placed an advertisement in Variety, reading: \"Positively Berle-proof gags. So bad not even Milton will steal them,\" with the telephone number of the movie theatre where he was working. Berle phoned him straight away, saying: \"If you're so damn smart, be over at the Capital Theater tonight, because I'm being held over for the third week - and bring some jokes.\" This led to Brecher being employed to write sketches for Berle's shows.\n\nIn 1937, Brecher moved to Hollywood and began working as an uncredited script doctor on comedy sequences such as those for Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz (1939). This led later to Groucho calling Brecher the Wicked Wit of the West - the title of his autobiography, which has just been published.\n\nThen came the Marx Brothers movies. \"For both pictures, they stuck to the script,\" Brecher said later. \"They were tough jobs. No one had ever written a Marx Brothers movie by himself. They generally had five or six writers. And I paid the price. I wound up with a tic.\"\n\nIn At the Circus, Brecher gave Groucho one of his best lines. Playing a trapeze artist, Eve Arden stuffs a wad of bank notes that belongs to the circus into her bra. Groucho turns to the camera and says: \"There's got to be some way of getting the money back without getting in trouble with the Hays office [the censor].\" In the same film, there was another risque wise-crack when Groucho, as shyster lawyer J Cheever Loophole, says: \"I don't know what I'm doing here, when I could be at home in bed with a hot toddy. That's a drink!\"\n\nIn Go West, the confidence trickster S Quentin Quale (Groucho, who else?), says: \"Lulubelle, it's you! I didn't recognise you standing up.\" In the same film, Quale remarks: \"I'd have thrashed him to within an inch of his life, but I didn't have a tape measure.\" Brecher also came up with many of the films' sight gags, including the scene in At the Circus when Chico and Harpo search the strongman's room for stolen money while he is asleep.\n\nBrecher then joined the famed Arthur Freed unit at MGM, which produced some of the studio's best musicals. His most notable achievement there was his Oscar-nominated screenplay (shared with Fred F Finklehoffe) for Vincente Minnelli's Meet Me in St Louis (1944). It was Brecher who persuaded a reluctant 22-year-old Judy Garland (who did not want to play another teenager) to take the part. It was also Brecher who indicated in the script where he thought songs should go, particularly his instinct about the Trolley Song. \"I was writing the script, and when I came to the end of that scene, I felt that this was a spot that would be good for a song.\"\n\nBut Brecher, who also wrote Minnelli's Yolanda and the Thief (1945) for Fred Astaire, did not get on with the domineering Freed. \"He couldn't take any disagreement. If you disagreed with him, he'd go crazy,\" he recalled. Brecher, who had created a radio comedy series, The Life of Riley, which had been running successfully for some years from 1941, decided to adapt it for television, starring Jackie Gleason. The series continued with William Bendix, after Gleason left the show, from 1953 to 1958. Brecher wrote and directed a rather feeble feature film version in 1949 with Bendix in the title role.\n\nHe went on to direct two other features, Somebody Loves Me (1952), a rags-to-riches Technicolor biopic of the vaudeville star Blossom Seely (Betty Hutton), and Sail a Crooked Ship (1961), a rather leaden comedy with Robert Wagner. His last screenplay was Bye Bye Birdie (1963), which he wittily adapted from the Broadway musical.\n\nBut Brecher later became disillusioned with the film industry. \"Today, they're making movies that cost a lot, but they're not making them out of love. These people today are bankers, brokers, agents, whatever they are... I'm grateful that I had a shot at a time when... movies were made by people who loved movies.\"\n\nDuring the Writers Guild of America strike of 2007, he made a video in which he urged the writers not to settle. \"Since 1938, when I joined what was then the Radio Writers Guild, I have been waiting for the writers to get a fair deal. I'm still waiting. As Chester A Riley would have said, 'What a revoltin' development this is!' But he only said it because I wrote it.\"\n\nBrecher is survived by his second wife and three stepchildren."
