        "text": "By Ira Sharkansky\n\nJERUSALEM—The election occurred on February 10th and the results were known on the 11th.\n\nRemember that Likud won fewer seats than Kadima, but the president as well as much of the population concluded that Likud would have a better chance of putting together a coalition that would get the support of a Knesset majority. So far, agreements have been reached with Israel Beitenu, Labor, SHAS, and Jewish Home. Together with Likud, they amount to 69 seats, a clear majority in the 120 seat Knesset. Negotiations continue with Torah Judaism and National Unity.\n\nSome Labor Members of Knesset (MKs) may be angry enough with party leader Ehud Barak for joining with Netanyahu that they will not support the coalition. Some members of Likud may be angry enough with Bibi for giving away prized appointments that their support will be tepid. Individual Likud MKs may work subtly or not so subtly to undermine Bib in the hopes of producing an early election.\n\nCoalition arithmetic begins with the number of Knesset seats held by each potential partner, and the goodies that the prime minister designate can trade for support. Prominent among these are positions as ministers and chairs of Knesset committee, commitments for expenditures on favored items, and support for other policy issues.\n\nThe election results produced the following array of likely coalition partners:\n\nLikud: 27 seats; Israel Beitenu: 15; Labor: 13, SHAS: 11, Torah Judaism: 5, National Unity: 4, Jewish Home: 3\n\nIt is conventional to rank the ministries by prestige. There is some dispute at the margins, but the rankings look more or less like the following. (The modest rankings of Health and Education reflect the importance of the Finance Ministry in setting expenditures, salaries, and service levels, the weight of Health Maintenance Organizations and teachers’ unions, and the autonomy of higher education.)\n\nThere are opportunities for dividing ministries to produce even more appointments, and to appoint deputy ministers and ministers without portfolio with vague or non-existent responsibilities.\n\nThe ministries likely to exist in Netanyahu's government, clustered by levels of prestige, are:\n\nGroup I—Prime Minister; Defense; Finance,Foreign Affairs\n\nGroup II—Justice; Interior; Industry and Trade; Public Security; Transportation; Construction and Housing\n\nGroup III—Education; Health; Communications; Agriculture\n\nGroup IV—Labor; Welfare; Immigrant Absorption; Infrastructure; Culture; Tourism; Science; Environmental Protection; Religions; Minorities; Development of the Negev and Galilee; Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister (This is an extra, which may carry few if any significant duties.)\n\nIt has become conventional to appoint a Deputy Prime Minister. The title of Deputy Prime Minister carries prestige, and few if any duties, except to act as the prime minister when the prime minister is out of the country or otherwise indisposed, and to assume the office upon death or resignation until the Knesset acts otherwise. The designation may come along with a ministerial appointment, or can be an extra if there aren’t enough ministries to meet the demand.\n\nBibi’s challenge was to win the support of several middle-sized or small parties, in order to reach a number of MKs as great as possible more than 60. Each potential partner knew its importance, and demanded appointments and other benefits.\n\nParties and ministries as of now, with summary prestige indications:\n\nLabor party: Defense, Industry and Trade, Agriculture, Welfare, Minorities. (That is, 1 Group I; 1 Group II, 1 Group III, 2 Group IV)\n\nIsrael Beitenu: Foreign Affairs, Domestic Security, Infrastructure, Tourism, Immigrant Absorption. (1 Group I, 1 Group II, 3 Group IV)\n\nSHAS: Interior, Construction and Housing, Religions. and minister in the prime minister’s office (2 Group II, 2 Group IV)\n\nJewish Home: Science (1 Group IV)\n\nAs of now, what is left for Likud, along with the position of prime minister is: Finance, Justice, Transportation, Education, Health, Communications, Tourism, Environmental Protection, Culture, Sport, Minorities, Development of the Negev and Galilee (2 Group I, 1 Group II, 3 Group III, 6 Group IV)\n\nThere are also appointments as heads of Knesset Committees. Here, too, there are differences in prestige, the leading ones being Foreign Affairs and Defense, Finance, Constitution Law and Justice, Knesset Committee, and State Audit. There are also sub-committees, some of which have greater prestige than full committees. There are traditions of appointing members of the opposition as chairs of certain committees. A prominent example is the Committee on States Audit, which focuses on the Office of the State Comptroller and its criticism of governmental bodies.\n\nBeside ministerial appointments, the achievements of the coalition partners include:\n\nIsrael Beitenu received the chair of the Knesset Committee of Constitution Law and Judiciary, a representative on the committee to appoint judges, and a commitment to find a solution for the problem of marriages involving individuals not recognized as Jewish by the Rabbinate.\n\nSHAS received a commitment to increase family allowances, i.e. monthly payments to families according to the number of children under the age of 18.\n\nLabor received a period of rotation as chair of the Knesset Committee on Foreign Relations and Defense, and a commitment to increase old age pensions.\n\nGo to top of right column\n\nJewish Home received a period of rotation as chairs of Knesset Committees of Education, and Children’s Rights\n\nPromised increases in family allowances and old age pensions, if delivered, will be expensive. Agreements to both required Netanyahu to slip aside from his often touted claim as being the finance minister in an earlier government who saved the economy by reducing welfare entitlements. It will also crimp his current promise to reduce taxes, already in trouble due to a reduction in tax collections as a result of the economic recession. Clips of Netanyahu criticizing the Olmert government for the expense of 25 ministers and deputy ministers appear along with prospects that his government will have 33.\n\nThere is a rough equivalence between the number of appointments received by each party and the number of seats won in the election. What will complicate Netanyahu’s work among Likud members is the scarcity of key appointments left unfilled, and the number of Likud MKs who think themselves especially worthy. Some of these were recruited to Likud by Netanyahu shortly before the election, seemingly with indications that they would be important members of his government. Netanyahu may also want to keep for himself the most prized of the as yet unfilled positions: minister of finance.\n\nThe Likud MKs likely to be expecting prized appointments are:\n\n—Silvan Shalom, prominent MK and former minister of Finance, and Foreign Affairs, and a rival of Netanyahu for party leadership\n\n—Moshe Ayalon, former Commander of the IDF, and one of Bibi’s recruits to Likud’s list\n\n—Benny Begin, son of the former prime minister, a politician in his own right, a former MK and minister, and one of Bibi’s recruits to Likud’s list\n\n—Limor Levnat, prominent MK and former minister, and the highest ranking woman among Likud MKs\n\n—Don Meridor, former minister of finance and justice, and one of Bibi’s recruits to Likud’s list\n\n—Yosi Peled, retired general and prominent media commentator, and one of Bibi’s recruits to Likud’s list\n\n—Miri Regev, one of Bibi’s recruits to Likud’s list, and a former spokeswoman of the IDF who came to prominence during the 2006 Lebanon war\n\n—Ruby Rivlin former chair of the Knesset, destined for that position again\n\n—Yuval Shteinitz prominent MK\n\n—Gilad Ardon prominent MK\n\n—Michael Eitan prominent MK\n\n—Israel Katz prominent MK\n\n—Gidon Saar prominent MK\n\nStill hanging are Torah Judaism and National Unity. Together they would provide nine additional seats to the coalition, as well as problems. Torah Judaism would dig in its heels against provisions to ease the process of conversion to Judaism, and add to SHAS’s adamant posture against anything that facilitated the marriage of Jews to non-Jews, and even civil marriage for non-Jews. Israel Beitenu depends on the support of Russian speaking immigrants, where these items are high priority.\n\nNational unity might fit well with Israel Beitenu on political negotiations with Palestinians and the rights and responsibilities of Israel’s Arab citizens, but it would cause significant problems on these issues for Labor.\n\nBibi is likely to present his government for Knesset approval within a few days. Israeli law provides that it may serve a bit longer than four years. It has been a while since any government has served that long, and it is too early to bet on the life span of this one.\n\nSharkansky is professor emeritus of political science at Hebrew University.

Gardner Memorial Scholar-in Residence week-end. He is Executive Director and Rabbi of Kol Echad; Making Judaism Matter. It is a transdenominational adult learning center in Atlanta, Georgia, where Jews and others study Judaism to respond to life’s deeper questions.\n\nWhen I asked Rabbi Salkin for three words to describe him, he mentioned: \"creative, thoughtful, and humorous.\" I concur with him, and I was especially impressed with his weaving in humor to discuss difficult topics. Two words which came to my mind were \" stamina\" and \"tall.\" I chose “stamina” because he often visits various temples nationwide whereby he gives a sermon on Friday. night, leads the Saturday morning Torah Study, and gives a speech both on Saturday night and Sunday morning. He claims that he has a rock star’s schedule, but taking his shoes off in airports gets tiresome.\n\nI also chose “tall” because at six feet five inches he is taller than most of us. He also has great depth of knowledge about Judaism. The number of books he has written is a tall number. He has written his seventh book recently, Righteous Gentiles in the Hebrew Bible: Ancient Role Models for Sacred Relationships. He was honored with the Ben Franklin award for Putting God on the Guest List, Reclaim the Spiritual Meaning of Your Child’s Bar/Bat Mitzvah.\n\nHe also wrote a children's version of Putting God on Your Guest List. It was considered to be the best book of the year about religion. I admire that he was proactive by writing a book about this much needed topic. His other books include Dream of Zion: American Jews Reflect on Why Israel Matters to Them; Being God’s Partner: How to Find the Hidden Link between Spirituality and Your Work; and Business Bible:10 Commandments Bringing Spirituality and Ethical Values to the Workplace.\n\nHis education is tall as well. In 1981 he was ordained as a rabbi at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. In 1991 he was one of the first Jews to receive the Doctor of Ministry degree from Princeton Theological Seminary. He has been a rabbi in Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Georgia.\n\nRabbi Salkin spoke about Righteous Gentiles, the subject of his most recent book.\n\nWhen I asked what prompted him to write this book, he stated that he loves the Bible so much and there are many sympathetic biblical characters that are not Jewish. Furthermore, he addresses the need for Jews to be kind to strangers since we were also strangers. He emphasizes that Jewish people live in an interdependent society; we do not live alone.\n\nHe recounted a touching story from his book. It was about an elderly woman named Anya, who lived with his boyhood friend, Ira, and his family. When he was a kid, and started asking questions, he asked his friend if the elderly woman was his grand-mother. Ira responded “No, she saved my mother during WWII.” In gratitude Ira’s mother invited Anya to live with her family. When the family decided to make Aliyah to Israel, Anya wanted to join them, despite the fact that Ira’s parents would have bought her a house of her own. When she died, she was rightfully buried in the same Catholic cemetery as Oskar Schindler. I appreciated the debt of gratitude that Ira’s mother felt toward Anya. I respected both Anya and Ira’s mother for acting upon their integrity.\n\nGo to top of right column"
