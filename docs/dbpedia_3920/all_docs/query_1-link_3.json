        "text": "Comedy-script writer; 94\n\nIrving Brecher, who wrote vaudeville sketches for Milton Berle, jokes for Henny Youngman, comedies for the Marx Brothers, a television series for Jackie Gleason and screenplays for movie musicals including “Meet Me in St. Louis” and “Bye Bye Birdie,” died Nov. 17 in Los Angeles. He was 94.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Nell Scovell, a friend, who said Mr. Brecher had suffered a series of heart attacks the previous week.\n\nWithin the tribe of Hollywood gag writers, Mr. Brecher was a literary lion, a reflexive offerer of reactive jokes, a relisher of puns, a connoisseur of often topical, arch repartee. He once angered the film producer Daryl Zanuck, telling him the movie he had just made hadn’t been released; it had escaped.\n\n“If I were any drier, I’d be drowning,” he had Groucho Marx saying, stuck in the rain in the 1939 film “At the Circus.”\n\nAlways a tester of taboos, in the same film Mr. Brecher had Groucho tease the guardians of Hollywood’s decency. In one scene, a mischievous vixen played by Eve Arden hides a billfold in her cleavage, and Groucho, wanting it back, says to the camera: “There must be some way of getting that money without getting in trouble with the Hays Office.” Groucho later would say it was the biggest laugh in the film. He and S.J. Perelman, asked to name the world’s quickest wits, listed Mr. Brecher along with George S. Kaufman and Oscar Levant.\n\nMr. Brecher received sole screenplay credit for two Marx Brothers films, a feat in itself. The second was “Go West,” released in 1940.\n\nHe was nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay for “Meet Me in St. Louis,” the Vincente Minnelli family musical set in the early 1900s, which became one of Judy Garland’s biggest hits, but only after Mr. Brecher talked her into making it by reading her the script. Garland had been afraid her co-star, Margaret O’Brien, was going to upstage her, Brecher explained to Hank Rosenfeld, his collaborator on a forthcoming autobiography.\n\n“When I got to O’Brien’s lines, I would kind of throw them away,” he said. “Then I would emphasize what Judy’s character was doing.”\n\nMr. Brecher was the creator of the long-running radio series “The Life of Riley,” about an ordinary working-class schnook who causes no end of trouble for his family; it was played first by Lionel Stander and later, more famously by William Bendix. Mr. Brecher turned it into a feature film, with Bendix, in 1949, and a television series in the fall of the same year – making it arguably the first situation comedy on TV – and hired Jackie Gleason for the lead role of Chester A. Riley. The series lasted only until the following spring. But when it was reprised in 1953, with Bendix back in the title role (frequently uttering his signature line, “What a revoltin’ development this is!”), it stayed on the air until 1958.\n\nThe writer in Mr. Brecher had something of an affinity with Riley, an airplane riveter. During the Hollywood writers’ strike of 2007, he made a video in which he urged the writers not to settle.\n\nIrving Brecher was born Jan. 17, 1914, in the Bronx, and he grew up in Yonkers, N.Y. At 19, after a brief stint covering high school sports for a local newspaper, he took a job as an usher and ticket taker at a Manhattan movie theater, where he learned from a critic for Variety that he could earn money writing jokes for comedians. Knowing of Milton Berle’s reputation as a joke-pilferer, he placed an ad in Variety, reading, in part: “Positively Berle-proof gags. So bad not even Milton will steal them.”\n\nBerle himself hired him.\n\nIn 1937, he moved to Hollywood and began working on scripts for Mervyn LeRoy, head of production at MGM. He was an uncredited script doctor on “The Wizard of Oz,” leading Groucho Marx to call him “The Wicked Wit of the West.” He took it as the title of his autobiography, to be published in January by Ben Yehuda Press.\n\nHis film credits include “Shadow of the Thin Man” (1941), with William Powell and Myrna Loy; “Du Barry Was a Lady” (1942), with Lucille Ball, Gene Kelly and Red Skelton; “Yolanda and the Thief” (1945), starring Fred Astaire; and “Bye Bye Birdie” (1963).\n\nBrecher’s first wife, Eve Bennett, died in 1981. He is survived by his wife, Norma; and three stepchildren."
