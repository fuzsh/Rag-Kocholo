        "text": "GO WEST is a wacky comedy western told in the vein of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. GO WEST follows the comical misadventures of a cursed widow and her companions as they travel across country in the Old West to save her teenage daughter from marrying an outlaw. It has some strong moral, pro-family content, but the positive content is mixed with lots of unfunny scatological humor and other lame comedy, along with some comical pagan, occult moments.\n\nThe movie opens with the narrator, Sean Astin, describing a widow named Aveline Jenkins who was cursed. Her curse made it so that every man she ever loves meets a tragic end. Following the death of her husband, Aveline sends her children with her parents to Oregon. Aveline stays behind in Missouri to take care of her comically ill sister, Cora.\n\nAveline goes to the general store to buy some salted pork and pick up a letter from her daughter. There, Aveline meets Elijah Goodman, a teacher traveling west, a miserly woman with serious father issues, the shopkeeper, Robert Failure Gladstone. Despite the curse, Aveline and Elijah instantly feel an attraction for each other. Through the letter, Aveline learns that her daughter is getting married to an outlaw she met along the way to Oregon. Aveline determines then and there to go west to save her daughter. In her hurry to save her daughter, Aveline accidentally underpays Robert by half a cent for the salted pork. Robert vows to get the remaining half-cent from Aveline.\n\nAveline prepares to head west and joins a group of travelers consisting of her sister Cora, Elijah and a host of people from her hometown. Will this motley crew of folks be able to pull together to survive the treacherous trek to Oregon?\n\nThe visuals and sound in GO WEST are professionally made, and the music is enjoyable. The set pieces aren’t exactly period for the 1800s, but it’s not always immediately noticeable. Sadly, the humor often seems forced, unintentionally awkward and even lame. Finally, the story and dialogue are definitely weird, even considering the fact that this is a comedy.\n\nGO WEST has some strong moral, pro-family content. For example, it has brief references to the Bible, faith and trusting God. Also, the lead female character is concerned about her teenage daughter and takes care of her sick sister.\n\nHowever, this positive content is marred by lots of unfunny, tasteless scatological humor and some pagan, superstitious, occult content. For example, the heroine uses her curse to save herself from a rampaging bison by telling the bison she loves it. Furthermore, she talks to two dead men from Heaven wo appear in the sky. One of the men sold his soul to the Devil, but had his fingers crossed at the time, so the deal didn’t count. Also, an epilogue at the end implies that the dead man establishes a homosexual relationship with Davey Crocket in Heaven, although in real life Davey was a brilliant and honorable man of God. So, all in all, MOVIEGUIDE® finds GO WEST excessive.\n\nMoviegoers should note that the movie is created by a comedy troupe that broadcast a comedy skit show on the Cable-TV network run by Brigham Young University, which was founded by the Mormon Church. Also, the story starts in Independence, Missouri, where a trinitarian splinter group of the Mormon Church is based."
