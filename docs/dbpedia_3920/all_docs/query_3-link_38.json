        "text": "Sebastian Stan and Lily James might be the Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, if you prefer) of troubled tales.\n\nStan and James, who starred together in the titular roles on the Emmy-winning FX (on Hulu) series “Pam & Tommy,” will reunite for psychological horror thriller “Let the Evil Go West.” Christian Tafdrup (“Speak No Evil”) is set to direct, with a script by Xc Vs.\n\n“Let the Evil Go West” follows a railroad worker (Stan) who stumbles upon a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife (James) becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.\n\nTafdrup is known for directing the Danish psychological thriller “Speak No Evil,” which premiered at Sundance and landed a U.S. remake. James McAvoy leads the English-language remake; Tafdrup is executive producing.\n\n“Let the Evil Go West” is produced by brothers Tim and Trevor White (“King Richard,” “The Post,” “Fair Play”) under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, along with Allan Mandelbaum, and Mark Fasano and Nathan Klingher for Gramercy Park Media — the film‘s financier.\n\nActors Stan and James will also executive produce along with Gramercy Park’s Joshua Harris and Ford Corbett and north.five.six.’s Michael Rothstein and Samuel Hall. North.five.six. represents the international rights and will introduce the project to international buyers in Cannes; CAA Media Finance and UTA Independent Film Group arranged the financing and will handle the domestic sale.\n\nStan will additionally be at Cannes for Ali Abbassi’s Donald Trump biopic “The Apprentice,” which will premiere in competition. The MCU alum recently starred in A24’s “A Different Man,” which debuted at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. “A Different Man” earned Stan the Silver Bear Award for Best Leading Performance at the Berlin International Film Festival. Stan is represented by CAA, Brookside Management, Sloane Offer Weber and Relevant.\n\nJames will lead upcoming crime-comedy film “Greedy People” for Lionsgate alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Her latest buzzy feature is a film inspired by the Bumble founder for 20th Century Studios and Ethea Entertainment, which is set to begin shooting later this year. Dan Stevens co-stars. James also had a recent A24 hit with “The Iron Claw.” James is repped by Tavistock Wood Management, David Weber and Shelby Weiser."
