During the Gold Rush, three lovable losers win and lose the deed to the only plot of land with absolutely no gold, only to discover it sits directly in the path of the transcontinental railroad--and is worth millions--when The Marx Brothers Go West. 1870. When S. Quentin Quale (Groucho Marx) he believes he can scam rubes Joe and Rusty Panello (Chico Marx and Harpo Marx) out of the money he needs to buy a train ticket West, Joe and Rusty con Quale out of everything he owns, even his trousers. But Joe and Rusty, who are supposed to deliver the deed to Dry Gulch to lovely Eve Wilson (DianaLewis), are themselves conned by the dastardly Beecher and Baxter. Now, with the bad guys holding the deed to a piece of land crucial to the railroads--and a lovely heroine left penniless--Quentin, Joe, and Rusty swing into action to save the day in the zaniest, wackiest Western ever.",
