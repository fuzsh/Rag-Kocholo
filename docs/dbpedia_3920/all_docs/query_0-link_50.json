        "text": "Plot\n\nConfidence man S. Quentin Quale (Groucho) heads west to find his fortune. In the train station, he encounters crafty brothers Joseph (Chico) and Rusty Panello (Harpo) who manage to swindle his money. The Panellos are friends with an old miner named Dan Wilson (Tully Marshall) whose property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. They loan him their last ten dollars for a grub stake and he gives them the deed to the Gulch as collateral. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival and beau to his granddaughter Eve Wilson (Diana Lewis), Terry Turner (John Carroll) has contacted the railway to arrange for them to build through the land, making the deed holder rich.\n\nCast\n\nGroucho Marx - S. Quentin Quayle\n\nChico Marx - Joseph Panello\n\nHarpo Marx - Rusty Panello\n\nJohn Carroll - Terry Turner\n\nDiana Lewis - Eve Wilson\n\nWalter Woolf King - John Beecher\n\nRobert Barrat - \"Red\" Baxter\n\nJune MacCloy - Lulubelle\n\nTully Marshall - Dan Wilson\n\nIris Adrian - Mary Lou\n\nJoan Woodbury - Melody\n\nGeorge Lessey - The Railroad President\n\nJoe Yule - Crystal Palace Bartender Joe\n\nMitchell Lewis - Halfbreed Indian Pete\n\nProduction\n\nLike all other Marx Brothers MGM films, Go West has several musical numbers, including \"As if I Didn't Know\" and \"You Can't Argue with Love\" both by Bronislau Kaper and Gus Kahn, \"Ridin' the Range\" by Roger Edens and Gus Kahn, \"From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water\" by Charles Wakefield Cadman and \"The Woodpecker Song\" by Harold Adamson and Eldo di Lazzaro. (In this song, Chico, playing the piano, rolls an orange on the keys in sync with the melody.)\n\nGroucho was aged 49 during the filming of Go West, and his hairline had begun receding. As such, he took to wearing a toupee throughout the film, as he did the previous film, At the Circus.\n\nGo West Screenwriter Irving Brecher stood in for an ailing Groucho when publicity stills for the film were first taken. Brecher bore a remarkable resemblance to Groucho and is all but unrecognizable in the photos, sporting Groucho's glasses, greasepaint mustache and eyebrows.\n\nMusical numbers\n\n\"As If I Didn't Know\"\n\n\"You Can't Argue With Love\"\n\n\"From the Land of the Sky-Blue Water\"\n\n\"Ridin' The Range\"\n\nReception"
