        "text": "NGU Community Orchestra Presents ‘Go West’ April 6\n\nTigerville, SC—The North Greenville University (NGU) Community Orchestra will show Buster Keaton’s 1925 silent film “Go West” as it premieres an original film score by NGU alumnus and award-winning composer Brett Ensley on April 6.\n\nThe free event will take place at 7 p.m. in Turner Chapel on NGU’s Tigerville campus. Tickets are available at the NGU Box Office.\n\nEnsley has composed for TV and films, including Black Widow, Shark Tank, and the Cartoon Network; commercials for BMW and Harley Davidson; video games, including “Call of Duty” and Triple-A Nintendo backgrounds; and won several awards for his 2016 film score to “Sereer.”\n\n“Go West” portrays Friendless, a man down on his luck who can’t find a job, but finds himself, a “city slicker,” out west where he becomes a bungling cattle rustler. He befriends Brown Eyes, a milking cow who is also a misfit in a sea of beef cattle. When the ranch owner, who can’t hold out any longer for fear of bankruptcy, sends the cattle to auction, including Brown Eyes, Friendless goes into action, saving not only his beloved Brown Eyes, but the ranch as well."
