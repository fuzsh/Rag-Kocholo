Go West tells the tale of two sisters traveling the Oregon Trail, and the hardships they endure traveling from Illinois to Oregon in the 1800s. A combination of a crazy cast of characters, a long and arduous journey, filled with harsh elements and sickness and death, this family comedy adventure pits the fragile group of handcart travelers against each other, traveling thousands of miles to find a place to call home."
