Matt Tanenbaum, The Bookstore in Lenox (MA) on NPR https://www.wamc.org/…/book-picks-the-bookstore-in-lenox\n\nThis is a brave document on community: Risky! Radical! Rewarding! A real account compiled by a free spirit, Rosenfeld, who worked in the Jive Gnus Department in the 1970s. Gerry Fialka, Venice Beachhead https://thevenicebeachhead.com/2023/08/21/tribal-jive-here-wow-by-gerry-fialka/\n\nIncludes plenty of station history, humorous tidbits and photographs of most of the key players. Jonah Raskin, San Francisco Examiner https://www.sfexaminer.com/culture/pop-music/book-about-ksan-the-jive-95-tells-story-of-historic-radio-station/article_0f8b4772-3c7f-11ee-b2cc-37828329355e.html\n\nThis is essential for anyone interested in the freeform KSAN radio in the 1960s and 70s – including Tom “Big Daddy” Donahue, Bonnie Simmons, Howard Hesseman, Paul Krassner, Sly Stone, Altamont coverage, SLA / Patty Hearst radio announcements, the closing of The Winterland, Ken Kesey, and much more – this book covers ground zero of the nationwide FM rock radio explosion of the 1970s and the wonderful arc from hippies to punks in San Francisco from 1968 to 1978 – I loved this book so much, I read it without stopping! Pat Thomas, Book Soup\n\nBeautiful, and wild info. Takes me way way back. Jack Neworth, Santa Monica Daily Press\n\nThis book kicks so much ass! Peter Nevins, Portland, Oregon\n\nThis book is tripping me out. Tom DeVries, TV Reporter\n\nA monument of a book, a fucking monument! Darryl Henriques, San Francisco Mime Troupe\n\nMEMORIE: My journey from Belgrade to Minneapolis by Benjamin Mandil as told-to-Hank Rosenfeld (2012)\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the way you were able to maintain Ben´s voice throughout the book. Having done several books from interview to finished product, I know it´s a real art to be able to bring the “author´s” voice through while making it read well. Fred Levine, Small Batch Books\n\nI am blown away…can’t put it down. I love how it is written, so experience-close, speaking in the now as it is happening, as he is thinking about it, as he is making sense of it all, as a 13 year old feels and thinks, as a 16 year old realizes what is unfolding. How interactive the text is, with his questions, and his jokes, and his warmly mocking humor. Reader\n\nThere is such a zest for life…It sounds like a spoken voice – as though one is listening instead of reading. The pre-war descriptions are truly wonderful. I wish I had done the same [for my father]. Wonderful gift…truly moving and gripping. Reader\n\nThe Wicked Wit of the West by Irving Brecher as told to Hank Rosenfeld (2009)\n\nWe should be grateful that [Rosenfeld] set his sights on Irving Brecher. “The Wicked Wit of the West” portrays a man who, despite decades in a vicious industry, stayed generous of spirit, clear-eyed and, most important, funny. Gordon Haber, The Jewish Daily Forward\n\nRosenfeld does a fine job as chronicler, selector, and muse for these interviews, and his genuine friendship with Brecher is the reason that this book exists. Altogether delightful, this is an incredible reminiscence by a remarkable man. Library Journal. Com, Christian Zabriskie, Queens Library, NYC\n\nA wonderful achievement. You need this book. It is the antidote to cynicism, and will keep you guffawing as you read and re-read. Dave McQueen, retired news anchor, KCBS San Francisco\n\nIrreverent brilliance is on ample display in “The Wicked Wit of the West,” Brecher’s entertaining memoir written in collaboration with erudite disciple Hank Rosenfeld. Brimming with delectable anecdotes, Brecher’s look back is like leafing through a scrapbook with your favorite crotchety uncle. Brecher elevated the wisecrack into an art form and wrote some of the most original films of the studio era. After feeding lines to some of Hollywood’s finest, the “wicked wit” finally gets the last word in this irresistible memoir. Mark Griffin, The Boston Globe\n\nIt is above all, a record of a unique friendship between an elderly man and a younger man, a meeting of generations with humor as the binding tie. Lynne Bronstein, Santa Monica Mirror\n\nAn unconventional but entertaining book, full of great stories, wonderful show business memories, rants and salty opinions … It also offers a bittersweet portrait of old age, although Brecher refuses to surrender to sentiment. In one of their last conversations, Rosenfeld asks the 94-year-old what he would like as an epitaph. He replies, “Here lies Irv Brecher, who doesn´t recommend it.” Be ready to appreciate a man who never got the attention he deserved. (He couldn´t have asked for a better testament to a life well lived.) Leonard Maltin´s Movie Crazy\n\nA wonderful and accessible book… a testament to the rapier-like humor of Irving Brecher… crammed with fascinating stories. Ivan Shreve, Thrilling Days of Yesteryear (.blogspot.com)\n\nOne of the funniest books of the year. Connie Martinson, Beverly Hills Courier\n\nBrecher drops one-liners about the actors he befriended (At 101, George Burns had “not one single enemy. They all died.”), as well as life in general (Hank: “If you had a robot, what would you want it to do for you?” Irv: “Go to my proctologist.”). If, looking at the book’s cover, you recognize only Judy Garland and Groucho Marx, you owe it yourself to complete your comedy education. Let this book be your guide. Kevin Lauderdale Author Magazine (.org)\n\nThis book is the ULTIMATE gift to give anyone who loves comedy of any kind, and\n\nis bedridden and needs to stay put with a book\n\nneeds a book for the “plane”\n\nis Jewish, half-Jewish, half-sour, a quarter Jewish or a Jewaroon ( 1/8th Jewish)\n\ninterested in biography, film, history, sarcasm, musicals or celebrities with massive nose-hair\n\ncraves a hardcore hit of New York City\n\nadmires craftsmanship\n\nwants to add to their “must see” video/dvd rental list\n\nneeds help choosing gifts; WWOTW delivers “ooohs and ahhhs”\n\nneeds more Vincente Minnelli trivia\n\nThank you Mr. Rosenfeld for keeping Irv alive. A. Karno, Venice CA\n\nA joyous collection…Brecher’s achievements are proof that sharp Yiddish humor became all-American comedy, and that behind every great wit lies a heavy heart. But as Irv noted, “The only escape from that is to try and be amusing.” Michael Simmons, LA Weekly\n\nBe prepared for a handkerchief and plenty of laughs. This book is a must read and should be in every film class across America. Tommy Garrett, Canyon News\n\nLike “Tuesdays with Morrie” only with laughs, the beauty of this book is the deep friendship that develops between Rosenfeld and the oft-crotchety Brecher. Jack Neworth, Santa Monica Daily Press\n\nAs soon as I finish that last page, in the spirit of Brecher/Rosenfeld, I am beginning my search for the perfect corned beef sandwich, cole slaw on the side! Lois Rose, Los Angeles CA\n\nYou make it so easy to enter his world. It’s like a Jewish adventure in movie land. Gut gemacht! Mark Solomon, Editor of Frankenweenie and other Tim Burton films.\n\nREVIEWS IN ITALY: “A PESCA CON GROUCHO” translation of Wicked Wit of the West\n\nhttps://cinemaitaliano.info/news/22163/a-pesca-con-groucho-un-libro-prezioso.html\n\nFISHING WITH GROUCHO – A precious book\n\nSilhouette publish the biography of the great American comic signed by Irving Brecher\n\nFISHING WITH GROUCHO – A valuable book continues the meritorious work of recovery of texts ( auto) biographical dedicated to the great American comedy initiated by Silhouette Publisher: this time the book is signed for four hands by Irving Brecher , now ninety, and the giornalista Hank Rosenfeld, dedicated to Groucho Marx.\n\n” Fishing with Groucho ” collects the memories of six years of lunches, walks and evenings with the ultimate pioneer of a Hollywood that no longer exists , Irving Brecher , one of the authors of the most prolific and original that the entertainment world has ever known.\n\nThe best friend of Brecher was Groucho Marx, who described him as ” The Wicked Wit of The West”\n\nuntranslatable expression in Italian that would sound more or less like ” The most scathing language of the West .”\n\nFriendship between the two is devoted to the heart of this book, ranging from the most intimate stories of the idiosyncrasies of a movie star curiosities collected on movie sets , to the surreal tales of dinners and relaxing holiday far from where the shy author was dragged into embarrassing situations to say the least .\n\nAn essential reading for all lovers of great cinema .\n\n01/27/2014\n\n—————————————–\n\nA PESCA CON GROUCHO\n\nVimercate .
