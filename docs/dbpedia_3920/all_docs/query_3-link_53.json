        "text": "Sebastian Stan (Fresh) and Lily James (Rebecca) previously starred together on Hulu series “Pam & Tommy” and are set to reunite once more on Let the Evil Go West, Deadline reports today.\n\nLet the Evil Go West is described as a psychological horror thriller from director Christian Tafdrup (Speak No Evil), with script by Xc Vs.\n\nThe horror film “follows a railroad worker who stumbles upon a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.”\n\nStan and James previously played Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson in “Pam & Tommy,” exploring their tumultuous relationship in the ’90s. Tafdrup wrote and directed the 2022 grim thriller Speak No Evil and serves as executive producer on the remake heading to theaters this summer.\n\nTim White and Trevor White (King Richard, Fair Play) are producing under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, alongside Mark Fasano and Nathan Klingher for Gramercy Park Media, which is also financing the film, and Allan Mandelbaum. Stan and James will also executive produce along with Gramercy Park’s Joshua Harris and Ford Corbett and north.five.six.’s Michael Rothstein and Samuel Hall. north.five.six. reps the film’s international rights and will launch sales at Cannes.\n\nStay tuned for additional details on Let the Evil Go West as they arrive.\n\nThe 60-minute found footage horror short Milk & Serial is making huge waves here in the horror community, already approaching half a million views since being uploaded just two weeks ago by the channel That’s a Bad Idea, an up-and-coming comedy duo made up of film-school-pals-turned-collaborators Curry Barker and Cooper Tomlinson.\n\nThe short film was made for just $800 and opted for a direct-to-YouTube release versus a more traditional release with a more traditional distributor, with the channel’s 600,000+ subscribers spreading it far and wide across the internet. Milk & Serial follows in the wake of the duo’s The Chair, a previous horror short that similarly went viral and passed 5 million views.\n\nNeedless to say, Barker and Tomlinson know what the hell they’re doing in the horror space. And in a chat with Variety this week, they tease that another horror movie is now in the works.\n\nThe title? Obsession.\n\n“It’s horror — completely horror,” Barker teases. “It’s terrifying. It’s going to be insane. This movie is unlike anything I think anyone’s ever seen. It’s so different from Milk & Serial … I’m not in it and it will not be a found footage movie. It’ll be shot more like The Chair.”\n\nBarker notes in the same interview that he “worked on this script for over eight months back and forth,” and he’s partnered with Tea Shop Productions (47 Meters Down) on the project.\n\nStay tuned for more on Obsession as we learn it.\n\nYou can watch Milk & Serial below, which follows a well-known social media comedy team whose lives are thrown into a tailspin following a birthday prank intended for their channel.\n\nAri Drew raved here on Bloody Disgusting just last week, “Milk & Serial is an exceptional vehicle for Barker and Tomlinson’s singular talents both in front of and behind the camera. The duo’s passion for horror and gift of twisted DIY storytelling are evident from the film’s opening scene. Despite it’s relatively familiar ‘influencer horror’ setup, Milk & Serial is ultimately a wild ride that delivers in spades, elevated by the duo’s impressive ingenuity and ability to capture a sense of authenticity often difficult to achieve in the found footage horror subgenre.”"
