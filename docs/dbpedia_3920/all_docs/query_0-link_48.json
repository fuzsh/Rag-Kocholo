        "text": "Go West is a 1940 film about the men who help young man, trying to settle an old family feud so he can marry the girl he loves.\n\nDirected by Edward Buzzell. Written by Irving Brecher.\n\nJUMP INTO YOUR BOOTS AND SADDLES...IT'S ROUND-UP TIME IN THE WILD AND WOOLY WEST! (taglines)\n\nS. Quentin Quale\n\n[edit]\n\nAny resemblance between these two characters and living persons is purely accidental!\n\nI was going to thrash them within an inch of their lives, but I didn't have a tape measure.\n\nLulubelle, it's you! I didn't recognize you standing up.\n\nTime wounds all heels.\n\nThere's something corrupt going on around my pants but I just can't seem to locate it.\n\nI give you my solemn word as an embezzler, I'll be back in ten minutes.\n\nYou must fan the flames of love with the bellows of indifference.\n\nI'm not in business for love, you know. I was in love once and I got the business.\n\nI'm not drunk, but, what's the ceiling doing on the floor?\n\nJoseph Panello\n\n[edit]\n\nRusty, I no like-a the West. All-a the people do is kill each other. I like-a the West better if it was in the East. Let's get outta here.\n\n[to Quale] You said you was an embezzler, but, you no fool me. I knew you was a crook!\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nIndian: White man talk too much. Make Chief heap mad.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: White man, red man's friend. White man want to make friends with red brother.\n\nJoseph Panello: And sister, too.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: There's only one law in the west: the law of blood and bullets. It's either shoot or be shot. What are we gonna do?\n\nJoseph Panello: Sue'em!\n\nJoseph Panello: My father-a shot the Indians in eighteen forty-two\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Oh, he should-a shot the stork-a, when the stork-a brought-a you.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Are you insinuating that the white man is not the Indian's friend? Ha! Who swindled you out of Manhattan Island for 24 dollars?\n\nJoseph Panello: White man.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Who turned you into wood and stood you in front of a cigar store?\n\nJoseph Panello: White man.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Who put your head on a nickel and then took the nickel away?\n\nJoseph Panello: Slot machine.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Members of the tribe - I rest my case.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: This is the last hat of it's kind. The beaver's have stopped making them. They're all out playing football. Ten dollars.\n\nJoseph Panello: Well, he's a poor boy. He'll give you a dollar. Will you take it?\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Well, I'll take it but I'm only making a buck on it.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: What did he say?\n\nJoseph Panello: He said, first they're going to give us a fair trial, then they kill us.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nJUMP INTO YOUR BOOTS AND SADDLES...IT'S ROUND-UP TIME IN THE WILD AND WOOLY WEST!\n\nThe Looniest, Tuniest Musical Gag-And-Gal Show Since \"A Night At The Opera\"\n\nRip-Roaring With Laughs, Girls, Songs!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nGroucho Marx — S.
