        "text": "Go West | 1940\n\nThe railway commandeered by Groucho Marx and co in this Wild West caper is the old Sierra Railroad in Northern California.\n\nOver the years, it's been seen in countless productions including High Noon, Back to the Future Part III, Pale Rider, The Great Race, Unforgiven and My Little Chickadee.\n\nIt still operates as Railtown 1897 State Historic Park, 10501 Reservoir Road, Jamestown on Route 49 about 50 miles east of Stockton. It's open daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Yearâs Day.\n\nAt weekends from April through September, you can take a six-mile, 45-minute round trip.\n\nThe actual locomotive used is Sierra Railway No 3, dubbed the 'Movie Star locomotive'. Built in 1891, it's claimed to have appeared in more motion pictures, documentaries, and television productions than any other locomotive. Yes, it's still there."
