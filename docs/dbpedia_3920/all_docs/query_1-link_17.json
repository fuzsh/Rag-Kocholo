        "text": "Written by: Victor Malone\n\nIrving Brecher: The Prolific Screenwriter Behind Marx Brothers Classics\n\nIrving Brecher was a renowned screenwriter, best known for being the only writer to receive sole credit on a Marx Brothers film, penning the screenplays for At the Circus (1939) and Go West (1940). His work on these iconic comedies has cemented his place in the annals of Hollywood history.\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nBrecher was born on January 17, 1914, in the Bronx, New York. His fascination with movies began at a young age, when he became an usher at a Manhattan movie theater at just 19 years old. Even then, he was writing jokes and sending them to prominent newspaper columnists, including Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.\n\nBrecher's screenwriting career took off in 1937, and he went on to work on numerous projects, including The Wizard of Oz (1939), Shadow of the Thin Man (1941), and Ziegfeld Follies (1945). He also ventured into radio, creating and producing The Life of Riley, and later, The People's Choice.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nBrecher received an Academy Award nomination in 1944 for his screenplay of Meet Me in St. Louis. This recognition solidified his reputation as a talented and accomplished screenwriter.\n\nPersonal Life and Anecdotes\n\nBrecher's physical resemblance to Groucho Marx led to him filling in for the legendary comedian in publicity photos for At the Circus, despite their 25-year age difference. This amusing anecdote showcases Brecher's lighthearted nature and his ability to poke fun at himself.\n\nIn his later years, Brecher wrote his memoirs, The Wicked Wit of the West, which was published posthumously in 2009. The book offers a humorous and heartwarming account of his experiences working with Hollywood legends, including Groucho Marx, Judy Garland, and Jackie Gleason.\n\nLegacy\n\nIrving Brecher's contributions to the world of comedy and screenwriting are undeniable. His work on the Marx Brothers films continues to delight audiences to this day, and his influence can be seen in many subsequent comedies.\n\nBrecher passed away on November 17, 2008, but his legacy lives on through his remarkable body of work, inspiring future generations of writers and comedians."
