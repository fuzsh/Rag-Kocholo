        "text": "The Writers Guild Foundation is a great thing and it’s wonderful to see them creating so much video content, then making it available to people anywhere in the world. Check this latest video in their “The Writer Speaks” series:\n\nBrief snippets of interviews with William Goldman, Walter Bernstein, Irving Brecher, DC Fontana, Bo Goldman, Fay Kanin and Frank Pierson. All of these interviews are available on DVD at the Shavelson-Webb Library, and will all be uploaded to YouTube in the months and years to come. We have dozens of these.\n\nWilliam Goldman: “Nobody knows anything. Nobody has the least idea what’s going to work. And screenwriters are the basis, I think, of everything. Because if you have a shitty script, even if you had Bergman or Fellini or David Lean, it’s not gonna work as a movie. It’s all fucking story, that’s really all it is. If the story works, if you’re moved by whatever the goddammed story is, you have a chance to have a movie that works.”\n\nThat’s just one priceless quote. Check out the other anecdotes and insights on the video. Then you can go here to the WGAF website to find out about more of the Foundation’s resources.\n\nBetter yet, follow them on Twitter as they announce events frequently: @WritersGuildF."
