        "text": "â€” \"As a writer, he really has no equals. Superiors, yes.\"\n\n-Milton Berle of Irving Brecher IRVING BRECHER, the man whom Groucho Marx called the Wicked Wit of the West, died last week at 94. It's like hearing that Methuselah has passed. The man was old enough to be ona first-name basis with Adam and Eve. His birth certificate must have been printed on papyrus. He got an advance copy of the Old Testament. The only thing older than Mr. Brecher was his jokes. And so on . . . gag after gag.\n\nIrving Brecher placed his first ad in Variety in the '30s.Back then, good jokes were so valuable, Milton Berle was stealing them. \"Positively Berle-proof gags,\" the advertisement read. \"So bad not even Milton would steal them.\"\n\nNaturally enough, Mr. Brecher got a job writing jokes-for Milton Berle. And soon, Irving Brecher was out in Hollywood working for the Marx Brothers and even writing a couple of their movies, At the Circus and Go West. Bad puns and bum metaphors were his specialty. His jokes made you laugh or groan, often both. (\"I was going to thrash them within an inch of their lives but I didn't have a tape measure.\")\n\nIt was after Mr. Brecher worked, without credit, on The Wizard of Oz that Groucho started calling him the Wicked Wit of the West. He also worked on Shadow of the Thin Man with William Powell and Myrna Loy, who were always dynamite despite that obnoxious little Asta who was supposed to be so cute. We always thought Dick Powell should havekicked the little terrier out of the way so he could concentrate on Myrna-first things first.\n\nMr. Brecher would go on to write the screenplays for the movie versions of Bye Bye Birdie and Meet Me in St. Louis. His radio series, The Life of Riley, may havebeen the first TV sit-com. He took great pride in having written the signature line of the lead character, Chester A. Riley, played memorably by William Bendix: \"What a revoltin' development this is!\"\n\nThey all sound more than a little corny these raw days, those rapid-fire gags that still smack of vaudeville. But that was comedy in the mid-20th Century, a timewhen people tended to think in words and have actual conversations instead of swapping obscenities.\n\nNow it's hard to get through a day at the office, let alone a half-hour of TV, without hearing somebody complain about their freakin' problems.\n\nIt's enough to make us miss the Hays Office, that guardianof movie morality Irv Brecher used to have such a good time taunting. After the brazen Eve Arden stuffs a bankroll down her blouse in At the Circus, Groucho, leering at the camera, says: \"There must be some way of getting that money without getting in trouble with the Hays Commission.\"\n\nGetting around the censor was half the fun those days-indeed, probably threequarters. But take away the restraint and you take away the fun. Subtlety is replaced by stupidity.\n\nLike any good comic, Irving Brecher lived a good, long life. Laughter is good for the digestion-and all the rest of our mortal frame.\n\nJust last year Mr. Brecher made a video in support of the writers' strike. But he ended up doing just what writers do-complain about management and look for work.\n\nThe nonagenarian comic ended his spiel with the words, \"Looking for representation. Because his agent died.\"\n\nIrv Brecher hadn't changed all that much since his first ad in Variety. Now, reading those old jokes in his obituary, he still makes us smile, or at least groan. Not a bad contribution to the health of the world."
