        "text": "Facts\n\nOn 6 July 1949 Brecher secured an option to employ Gleason in the title role of 'The Life of Riley' television series for as long as 364 weeks at a starting salary of $700 per week. The option agreement contained clauses setting out Gleason's responsibilities on the exercise of the option and provided that\n\n'upon the exercise of such option by me (Brecher) we shall enter into a formal contract embodying the provisions herein contained and such other terms and provisions as are usual and customary in contracts of this character and as shall conform with my contract with the sponsor and/or network including without limitation the usual act of God, strike, lockout and pre-emption clauses; the right to use your name, picture, photograph and other life likeness; usual indemnity provisions; a liquidated damage clause; the right to kinescope or otherwise film the live telecast; usual morality clause; and the right to change time, day or network.'\n\nOn 23 August 1949 Brecher exercised his option, and it was agreed that Brecher could assign his rights under the contract to National Broadcasting Company. From September 1949 through February 1950 Brecher wrote and produced 26 'The Life of Riley' television films and Gleason was paid according to the terms of the option agreement. The films were telecast once each during a 26-week period beginning October 1949. Although the series won an Emmy award as the best film series on television, Brecher lost $52,000 on the production and discontinued the show.\n\nBrecher and Gleason never signed a formal contract 'embodying the provisions (of the option agreement) and such other terms and provisions as are usual and customary in contracts of this character,' as called for by the option agreement. Samuel Sacks, an attorney and agent for Brecher, testified that the usual and customary contract terms for an actor's services in July 1949 gave the employer an unrestricted right to re-use films of the actor's services. Brecher testified that another star in 'The Life of Riley' series, Rosemary DeCamp, has a written contract for additional compensation if the series should be rerun.\n\nOn 20 April 1950 Jerry Rolston, an attorney, wrote to Brecher's agent, Ann Rosenthal of the William Morris Agency: 1\n\n'I stopped work in the preparation of the television contract, as well as the motion picture contract, since there is considerable doubt as to whether or not any additional options will be used.\n\n'Just yesterday (Gleason's representatives) were in my office and I reminded them of the fact that the contracts had not been drawn and it was their opinion that no further work should be done on them until we know the result of Irving's trip to Milwaukee.\n\n'You may rest assured that our clients will do anything and everything possible to aid Irving in this matter and we will more than abide by the oral agreements that were reached in your offices and of which we both have notes. However, our clients do not desire to incur any additional expense in contract preparation until they know that there is going to be an exercise of the options and compensation from which to pay the additional expense.'\n\nOn 25 April 1950 Rosenthal wrote Rolston:\n\n'I am quite sure that you as an attorney realize the importance of reducing understandings to writing and particularly in this instance where future uses may be involved, the agreements we arrived at during meetings should definitely be set forth in writing.'\n\nOn 17 July 1951 Samuel Sacks wrote to Rolston:\n\nThis will confirm my telephone conversation with you with respect to the understanding between Irving Brecher and Jackie Gleason and the re-use by Irving Brecher of the 'Life of Riley' film which includes Jackie Gleason.\n\n'If Irving Brecher makes a deal for the release of the television motion pictures which embody Gleason's performance, then with respect to those pictures, Gleason is to be paid 10% Of the gross proceeds received by Irving after first deducting distribution charges, agency commissions and the compensation paid to the personnel who rendered services in connection with said films at union and guild rates.'\n\nOn 18 July 1951 Rolston replied to Sacks:\n\n'I am in receipt of your letter of July 17th and hasten to correct any misunderstanding. I understood that we had agreed that in the event of re-issue of the 'Life of Riley' TV films, starring Jackie Gleason, Gleason would receive ten per cent of the gross proceeds received by Brecher after Brecher deducts the following: (1) distribution charges (2) agency commissions; and (3) charges made by guilds and unions. It was never contemplated that compensation to be paid to other personnel, other than required and demanded by the guilds or unions, would be deducted. The particular union or guild charges that we contemplated were the A.F. of M. requirements, since there are no other guild restrictions in existence. . . .\n\n'In other respects, your letter of July 17th is correct, so please re-confirm the fact that this letter embodies our understanding, and is to be the basis of compensation to Gleason in the event of any reissue of said films.'\n\nOn 2 August 1951 Sacks wrote again to Rolston:\n\n'Many thanks for your letter of July 18, 1951. There are several points which I should like to clarify as follows:\n\n'1. The reference in your first paragraph to A.F. of M. should be, of course, not only to A.F. of M. but any recognized union or guild which has jurisdiction over any of the personnel who rendered services in connection with these films. . . .\n\n'2. The allowable deduction should clude, as an example, a person like Rosemary DeCamp. I don't have a copy of her contract but I understand that if, as and when a union acquires jurisdiction and requires payment for reuse of television film, then Rosemary DeCamp is entitled to such union payment even though the union regulation is not made retroactive.\n\n'I trust that the foregoing conforms to your understanding too, and if it does, I would appreciate your reconfirming the same. Accordingly, the substance of my letter of July 17, 1951 as modified by your letter of July 18, 1951 and this letter shall constitute the understanding and is to be the basis of compensation to Gleason in the event of any reuse of the film embodying Gleason's services.'\n\nSome seventeen years passed. Then on 4 March 1968 Brecher wrote to Gleason:\n\n'Happily, NBC's rights in 'Riley' under a license I granted in 1952, have just expired. The TV series we made is now cleared for re-runs. . . .\n\n'You may recall that you will share, according to our agreement, in the proceeds. It seems to me those proceeds might be greatly increased if your organization was actively involved in exploiting the films to our joint benefit, resulting in an ultimate..."
