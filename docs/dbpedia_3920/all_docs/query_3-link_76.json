The film's screenplay is written by Xc Vs.\n\nThe director is previously known for helming the acclaimed 2022 Danish psychological thriller Speak No Evil which premiered at Sundance. He made his directorial debut with Parents (2016).\n\nAccording to the official description, Let the Evil Go West follows a railroad worker who stumbles upon a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.\n\nIn Pam & Tommy, Stan and James played the 1990s couple Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee during a whirlwind marriage over four days in Cancun, where their privately recorded honeymoon sex tape was stolen by a disgruntled electrician and released online.\n\nThe film is produced by Tim and Trevor White under their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, Mark Fasano and Nathan Klingher for Gramercy Park Media, which is also financing the film, and Allan Mandelbaum. Stan and James are also executive producing with Gramercy Park’s Joshua Harris and Ford Corbett and north.five.six.’s Michael Rothstein and Samuel Hall. Tafdrup is also executive producing.\n\nOther members of the cast and other details including the release date are yet to be announced. Meanwhile, Stan, who is best known for his role as the Winter Soldier in the Captain America and Avengers franchises, has projects like A Different Man and The Apprentice."
