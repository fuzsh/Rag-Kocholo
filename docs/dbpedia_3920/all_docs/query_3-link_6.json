        "text": "- Any of you boys got change for 10 cents?\n\n- No, sir.\n\nWell, keep the baggage.\n\nTickets for the West at this window!\n\nOne ticket for the West, end of line.\n\nYes, sir. That'll be $70, please.\n\nThere's your $70.\n\nDon't bother counting it.\n\n- There's only $60 here.\n\n- I told you not to count it.\n\nYou need $10 more.\n\nIt's highway robbery.\n\nNo wonder you're behind bars.\n\nI'll get that other $10.\n\nSomeday I'll be president of this railroad,\n\nand when I am...\n\nHey, mister.\n\nIs this the right way for my brother\n\nto get on the train for the West?\n\nNot unless they're throwing\n\na masquerade party out West, it isn't.\n\n- All we wanna know is where's the train.\n\n- The train? It's out on the tracks.\n\nIt seldom comes in here.\n\nCome on, Rusty, I'll buy you a ticket.\n\nWhere's your $70?\n\nYou only got $10?\n\nWhat did you do with the other $60?\n\nYou buy a snake?\n\nI can't get you a ticket\n\nif you ain't got enough money.\n\nMoney?\n\n- You two gents are heading West, partner?\n\n- Not me. Just my brother.\n\nYou see, I got no money.\n\nSo he's going West.\n\nWhen he gets off the train,\n\nhe'll pick up some gold and send it to me.\n\nThey say the gold is laying\n\nall over the streets.\n\nAll over the streets you find the gold.\n\nThe way he's dressed, he looks like\n\nhe was laying all over the streets.\n\nOf course the gold is all over the streets,\n\nbut they won't let him take any.\n\nHe's a tenderfoot.\n\nYou wear those shoes,\n\nyou've got tender feet, too.\n\nThose are shoes?\n\nI thought that was fungus with buttons.\n\nAll right, suppose he's got tender feet.\n\nYou don't pick up gold with feet.\n\nNo, you don't understand.\n\nA tenderfoot is an easterner.\n\nOut West, they shoot at anything\n\nthat looks Eastern.\n\nThey'll blow his head off if he goes\n\nout West with that flea incubator.\n\nWhat's the matter with that hat?\n\nIt cost a lot of money.\n\n- How much did it cost him?\n\n- I don't know. He stole it.\n\n- What's the idea?\n\n- Wait a minute!\n\nI'm just trying to save his life.\n\n- You love your brother, don't you?\n\n- No, but I'm used to him.\n\nNow, this is the kind of hat\n\nthey're wearing this season.\n\nThis is the 1870 model.\n\nIt's what they call a pioneer's cap.\n\nIsn't that tail supposed to be in the back?\n\nNot on him.\n\n- That's genuine beaver.\n\n- It's pretty.\n\nI'll stroke it. It's still my hat, you know.\n\nThat'll be $10.\n\n- You want $10 for that old beaver?\n\n- I'm not in business for love.\n\nI was in love once and I got the business.\n\nBut that's another story,\n\nand a very unpleasant one, too.\n\nWhy should he buy a hat?\n\nHe ain't got enough money for a ticket.\n\nYou can always get a ticket.\n\nBut this is the last hat of its kind.\n\nThe Beavers have stopped making them.\n\nThey're all out playing football. $10.\n\nHe's a poor boy. He'll give you $1.\n\nYou take it?\n\nI'll take it, but I'm only making $1 on it.\n\nRusty, give him $1.\n\nWhat floor was that on?\n\nFirst business I've ever done\n\nwith a dust storm.\n\nIt'll cost me $1 to have this cleaned.\n\n$9 change, please.\n\n- What change?\n\n- That's $10.\n\nYes, so it is.\n\nMoney lover.\n\nA dollar's a dollar,\n\nand every dollar is taking me further West.\n\nUs, too.\n\n- What are you laughing at?\n\n- That hat.\n\nIt looks ridiculous\n\nwith that coat he's got on.\n\n- What's the matter with that coat?\n\n- They clash.\n\nI have a coat that goes with that hat.\n\nHave you got a moment?\n\nCome over here, son.\n\nNow, this is a coat that's really a coat.\n\nThere's the finest deerskin jacket\n\nI've ever seen.\n\nLooks like it was made-to-order.\n\nNow, let's see.\n\nThat's $20 plus $1. That's $21.\n\nWe meet you halfway. We give you $1.\n\nYou must have come the short way.\n\n- Come on, Rusty. Give him $1.\n\n- That's fine.\n\n- Adios, gentlemen.\n\n- $9 change, please.\n\n- Change?\n\n- That's $10.\n\nSo it is.\n\n- Say, it looks a lot like the other one.\n\n- It should.\n\nHere's your change.\n\nIt's a pleasure to do business\n\nwith a man like you.\n\nOur slogan is,\n\n\"The customer is always right. \"\n\nSay, did you see something\n\nflying across here?\n\n- Might have been a pigeon.\n\n- No, it wasn't a pigeon. It was green.\n\n- Must have been a frog.\n\n- It had numbers on it.\n\nThose were the license plates.\n\nI guess it's my... No, it isn't.\n\nI can't seem to locate\n\nthat $20 you gave me.\n\nWhat $20? We no give you $20.\n\nWe give you $2.\n\n$1 for the hat, and $1 for the coat.\n\nThat's right, yes,\n\nbut you gave me two $10.\n\nSure, and you give us $18 change.\n\n$18 from $20 is $2.\n\n- And you got mixed up.\n\n- So stupid of me.\n\nThere's something corrupt\n\ngoing on around my pants...\n\nand I just can't seem to locate it.\n\nIf you think we're crooked,\n\nwe give you another $1.\n\nI'm sorry if I had you fellows\n\npegged wrong.\n\nI must have misunderstood you.\n\n$9 change, please.\n\n- You wouldn't wanna give me $1?\n\n- No.\n\nHow about giving me 10 singles\n\nand I'll give you 9 singles change?\n\n- But we got no singles.\n\n- I just gave him $18.\n\nHe sends money home to his mother.\n\n- You want $1?\n\n- Not if it's gonna cost me $9.\n\n- You should watch your money.\n\n- I'll watch my money. You watch him.\n\n$9 change, please.\n\nOne, two, three, four, five,\n\nsix, seven, eight, nine.\n\nYou count good, but where's the change?\n\n- Didn't I just give it to you?\n\n- No.\n\nRusty, did he give it to you?\n\nYou must have given it to yourself.\n\nSomebody's giving it to me.\n\nYou know, all I want to do is go West...\n\nnot go broke. Good day, gentlemen.\n\n- You forgot something.\n\n- Now what's the matter?\n\n- The sales tax.\n\n- What sales tax?\n\nFor the stuff you just sold us.\n\nWe gotta give you another $1.\n\nNo, thanks. I couldn't afford it.\n\nBut it's against the law not to charge tax.\n\n- You wanna go to jail?\n\n- I won't say anything if you don't.\n\nI won't say anything, but he might.\n\n- What does he want to keep quiet?\n\n- Nothing.\n\nAll he wants to do\n\nis to give you another $1.\n\n- He doesn't want $9 change?\n\n- No, he'll take $5 and $4.\n\nGive me it.\n\nHe'll take $5 and $4.\n\nOne, two.\n\nHere's $3. There's $4.\n\nFive, six, seven, eight, nine.\n\nYou know what I say,\n\nI like to do business with you...\n\nbecause I knew you were honest\n\nthe first time I see you.\n\nThe cornerstone of my success\n\nis integrity.\n\n- That's right.\n\n- That's the only secure foundation.\n\nThat's what I said when I see you.\n\n- When you have that, you have everything.\n\n- Right. I know you're a good man.\n\nI gotta do business.\n\nI don't care about anything else.\n\nYou can conduct it another way,\n\nbut it's not permanent.\n\nIt's not the kind of thing\n\nyou can build your success on.\n\n- That has been the climax of my success.\n\n- That's what I said.\n\nIt's suddenly gotten very chilly in here.\n\nWell, goodbye.\n\nIt seems that I've strayed into\n\na den of thieves.\n\nHowever, it's a wise man\n\nthat profits by his previous mistakes...\n\nand from herein, gentlemen...\n\nI have made\n\nsome other financial arrangements.\n\nIt's been nice knowing you, gentlemen.\n\nI'm glad to have made your acquaintance,\n\nand a good day to you both.\n\n- Good day.\n\n- Goodbye.\n\nCome on, Rusty.\n\nGentlemen, this is Mr. Terry Turner\n\nwho has just arrived from the West.\n\n- Hello.\n\n- How do you do?\n\nYoung man, I want you to tell these\n\ngentlemen what you told me this morning."
