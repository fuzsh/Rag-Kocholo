        "text": "There is a generosity to Wim Wenders that makes fans cling to films like “Paris, Texas,” with a hopeful ferocity.\n\nMaybe, we pray as we clutch the DVD box for the umpteenth showing, just maybe we’ll each get our own chance to hit the road, seek forgiveness for our trespasses and forgive those who have trespassed against us.\n\n“Don’t Come Knocking” repeats many of the road-and-regret themes from Wenders’ past work in a knowing and gentle fashion. Wenders has a great sense of humor and a knack for looking past stereotypes of the American West. The result is a moving film that hangs with you like a favorite vacation to red-rock country.\n\nIn the screenplay he co-wrote with star Sam Shepard, Wenders begins with a joke.\n\nA cowboy actor (Shepard) hijacks a horse and runs away from the set of his own Western movie. He literally gives up his spurs in a trade for another horse. The movie company sends out the sheriff in the form of bonding agent Tim Roth, and Shepard flees . . . to his mother’s house, where he drinks too much and looks at old scrapbooks.\n\nShepard eventually winds up in Butte, Mont., to look up the waitress with whom he once had an affair on a movie set there. Another joke – the waitress is played by Jessica Lange, Shepard’s longtime real-life partner. Lange pitches a twist at the cocksure cowboy: He has a son, all growed up.\n\nWenders makes this happen in a signature scene, where intention collides with coincidence. Shepard chases Lange to a bar, not realizing until he’s in too deep that the trippy, cool musician playing modern cowboy music up on stage (Gabriel Mann) is the offspring of their fling.\n\nWhat other filmmakers should learn from Wenders is how to portray an American town away from the populated coasts. On one hand, Butte is a dead former mining town. Shepard can and does sit on a couch in the middle of a city street, all day and all night, with nary a car horn honked in anger.\n\nYet Wenders also sees the New West building on tourism and technology, a Butte with Internet cafes and hip bands. Shepard and Lange hold a shouting match on a deserted street, but Wenders uses as the backdrop a fitness center, with a man in Lycra pedaling a LifeCycle and watching the showdown.\n\nIn another nice pause, the uptight Roth stops his car at a stunning high-plains view to shave his two-day stubble. He shuts off the electric razor for a second, just to hear the silence. In between these quiet notes is another terrific soundtrack from master mixer T-Bone Burnett.\n\nThe Wenders-and-Shepard quest for grace and redemption will play as too obvious for some. Their closing has characters driving away past a road sign for “Wisdom, Nevada.”\n\nBut there is an appealing optimism infusing “Don’t Come Knocking,” a buoyancy of personality prompted by landscape, that should overcome many doubters. Why ride off in a cloud of dust if you’re already sure what will happen once you’ve left?\n\nStaff writer Michael Booth can be reached at 303-820-1686 or mbooth@denverpost.com.\n\n*** 1/2 | “Don’t Come Knocking”\n\nR for brief nudity, adult language|1 hour, 45 minutes|LIGHT DRAMA|Directed by Wim Wenders; written by Wenders and Sam Shepard; starring Shepard, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth, Sarah Polley and Gabriel Mann|Opens today at Landmark’s Mayan Theatre."
