        "meta_description": "If\r\ncomedian Groucho Marx—born Julius Henry Marx in New York City on this date in\r\n1890—had achieved his childhood ambition of becoming a doctor…well, the world\r\nwould know a little less laughter.  Fortunately for audiences who enjoyed\r\nthe quick, insulting wit of the premier funnyman in movies, radio, and TV,\r\nJulius was “persuaded” to go into show business by his domineering mother\r\nMinnie, who believed that he and his brothers—collectively known as Leonard\r\n(Chico), Adolph (Harpo), Herbert (Zeppo), and Milton (Gummo)—were destined to\r\nconquer the show business world.  Although the term “stage mother” often\r\nconveys negativity, we owe Mother Minnie a debt of gratitude for riding herd on\r\nher “boys.”Stories\r\ndiffer on just why young Julius was discouraged from pursuing a medical career;\r\none account states that he was needed to supplement the family’s income (his\r\nfather Sam—known to the family as “Frenchie”—never really achieved success in\r\nthe tailoring business), while another puts the blame on his limited formal\r\neducation.  Minnie herself had a tenuous connection to show business in\r\nthat her father had once made a living as a traveling magician and her brother\r\nAl (Shean) Schoenberg was one-half of the popular vaudeville duo, Gallagher and\r\nShean.  Julius’ first show business job was with a singing trio that paid\r\na handsome $4-a-week.  Unfortunately, a member of that group made off with\r\nJulius’ salary and left him stranded in Colorado—he had to work a series of odd\r\njobs to earn his fare back home.Julius\r\nwould have better luck letting Minnie run the show; in 1909, she put together a\r\nquartet consisting of Julius, Adolph (who changed his name to Arthur), Milton,\r\nand non-Marx brother Lou Levy.  Collectively they were known as “The Four\r\nNightingales,” and for several years the brothers got by as an average\r\nvaudeville act.  It was only during a particularly dismal performance in\r\nNagadoches, Texas when the Marxes discovered that they had a flair of comedy;\r\nthey started heckling the audience giving them grief during their act…and the\r\ncrowd ate it up.The\r\nBrothers Marx took an old comedy routine from Gus Edwards, “School Days,” and\r\nrefashioned it as “Fun in Hi Skule”—an act that they dutifully performed to\r\nappreciative laughter over the years until eventually they arrived at the Mecca\r\nof Vaudeville, The Palace Theatre, in 1919.  Along the way, the group\r\nstarted to develop their characters (Chico the phony Italian, Harpo the silent\r\nsprite) and their nicknames, bestowed upon them by fellow performer Art Fisher\r\nduring a card game.  Julius would go by “Groucho” for the rest of his\r\ncareer, and the Marx Brothers went on to conquer Broadway with three smash\r\nstage hits: I’ll Say She Is (1924), The Cocoanuts (1925),\r\nand Animal Crackers (1930).If\r\nthose last two production sound vaguely familiar, it’s because they were the\r\nfirst two films featuring the Marx Brothers when they began making movies for\r\nParamount in 1929.  The team would follow those successes with Monkey\r\nBusiness (1931), Horse Feathers (1932)…and the film\r\nmany consider to be their finest screen comedy, Duck Soup (1933). \r\nAll five of those films featured Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo (Gummo quit\r\nperforming after he was drafted in World War I), and when the siblings were\r\nhired by MGM to make A Night at the Opera (1935), Zeppo had\r\nquit the motion picture business as well.  The three Marx Brothers\r\nfollowed the giant success of Opera with ADay\r\nat the Races (1937), and later made three additional films for Leo the\r\nLion: At the Circus (1939), Go West (1940),\r\nand The Big Store (1941).  The three remaining movies\r\nfeaturing Groucho, Chico, and Harpo were Room Service (1938;\r\nRKO), A Night in Casablanca (1946; United Artists), and Love\r\nHappy (1949; also UA)—though Groucho’s participation with Chico and\r\nHarpo in this last production is rather fleeting.In\r\nthe Marx Brothers’ films, Groucho handled most of the verbal comedy; in his\r\ntrademark glasses and greasepaint eyebrows-and-moustache, he’d sidle up to\r\nwealthy dowagers (generally played by favorite foil Margaret Dumont) and let\r\nloose with a barrage of rapid, cut-to-the-quick insults—in fact, his entire\r\ncharacter was built on a foundation of defying authoritarian figures and\r\ndeflating pomposity.  In 1932, he and Chico took a stab at radio with a\r\ncomedy program over NBC Blue entitled Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel (Harpo\r\ndid not appear, owing to the silent nature of his comedy).  The series did\r\nwell in the Hoopers, but sponsor Standard Oil was disappointed that it didn’t\r\nmatch the audience of Texaco’s The Fire Chief Program (with\r\nEd Wynn), and pulled out after one season.Groucho\r\nand Chico would later join the all-star cast (Cary Grant, Carole Lombard, etc.)\r\nof NBC’s The Circle in January of\r\n1939, later described by the show’s writer Carroll Carroll as “radio’s most\r\nexpensive failure.”  In subsequent radio ventures, Groucho went\r\nsolo…without much success.  He was the host of CBS’ Blue Ribbon\r\nTown from 1943-44, a show that surviving broadcasts reveal isn’t\r\nquite as bad as its reputation (Groucho got solid support from regulars like\r\nVirginia O’Brien, Leo Gorcey, Fay McKenzie, and Kenny Baker—who inherited the\r\nprogram after Marx left in June of 1944).  Groucho was depressed that radio\r\npopularity eluded him despite getting appreciative laughs while guesting on\r\nshows headlined by the likes of Rudy Vallee, Eddie Cantor, Jack Benny, and\r\nDinah Shore (Marx was practically a regular on Dinah’s Birds Eye\r\nOpen House).  Even his good friend Irving Brecher couldn’t create\r\na hit for the acerbic funnyman; a pilot entitled “The Flotsam Family” flopped\r\n(though Brecher later refashioned it into The Life of Riley for\r\nWilliam Bendix).An\r\nappearance on a Walgreens’ special would be the catalyst for Groucho’s eventual\r\nradio success.  As Groucho and host Bob Hope deviated from a prepared\r\nscript with some fast-and-furious ad-libs, producer John Guedel (the man\r\nbehind People are Funny) was convinced he had the perfect\r\nradio format for Marx.  Groucho would host a quiz show—which eventually\r\nbecame You Bet Your Life—and exercise his talent for sharp\r\nwisecracks “interviewing” the contestants.  Marx was reluctant, to say the\r\nleast; he believed that playing the role of “quiz show host” was a considerable\r\ncomedown.  But as he gradually grasped that You Bet Your Life’s “quiz”\r\nwas merely a backdrop for allowing him to do what he did best—improvised\r\nconversation—he enthusiastically embraced the project. You Bet\r\nYour Life premiered over ABC Radio on October 27, 1947 for\r\nElgin-American watches and quickly became one of the fledgling network’s big\r\nhits.  It later transitioned to CBS in October of 1949 for a season and\r\nthen moved into its permanent home on NBC a year later.  Because of the\r\nsimplicity of its format, You Bet Your Life was\r\nbroadcast simultaneously on radio and TV (where it quickly made a nest in the\r\nTop Ten of the Nielsen ratings); the radio version bowed out on June 10, 1960,\r\nbut the boob tube incarnation lasted one additional season (and was\r\nretitled The Groucho Show).Before\r\nhis death on August 19, 1977 at the age of 86, Groucho Marx continued to be a\r\nbeloved TV presence, both as a guest on the medium’s many talk shows and\r\nappearances on variety hours like The Hollywood Palace and The\r\nKraft Music Hall.  He’s revered by students of comedy for his\r\ntake-no-prisoners wit, and his quotable lines (like “I refuse to join any club\r\nthat would have me as a member”) are cherished by those who took pleasure in\r\nGroucho’s fearless mockery of society’s conventions.  Radio Spirits invites\r\nyou to enjoy Groucho on radio in our Jack Benny &amp; Friends collection,\r\nas the birthday boy trades quips with Jack on a February 20, 1944\r\nbroadcast.  The 3-DVD set Groucho Marx TV Classics presents\r\nthe comedian at his finest with a compendium that includes telecasts from You\r\nBet Your Life and The Hollywood\r\nPalace, and the Marx Brothers TV Collection not\r\nonly features Groucho but brothers Chico and Harpo in clips from fifty rare and\r\nvintage television appearances.  Finally, we recommend you peruse the\r\nRadio Spirits bookshelf until you locate Marx &amp; Re-Marx; written by Andrew\r\nT. Smith, it’s a fascinating history of Groucho and Chico’s “lost” radio\r\nshow, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel—with the scripts from\r\nthe original series and the story of how they came to be revived by BBC Radio\r\nin the early 1980s.  If Groucho were here, he might say, “Outside of a\r\ndog, a book is man’s best friend. Inside of a dog it’s too dark to read.”",
