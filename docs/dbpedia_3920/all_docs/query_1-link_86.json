        "text": "Time once more for my blog feature, DT Moviehouse Reviews, in which I make my way alphabetically through my 200+ DVD/Blu-Ray collection (you can see the list right here) and decide if each one was worth the money. Today I take a look at The Marx Brothers in At The Circus.\n\n(1939) Directed by Edward Buzzell\n\nWritten by Irving Brecher\n\nTagline: Keep The World Laughing!\n\nWhat It’s About:\n\nCircus owner Jeff Wilson (Kenny Baker – not related to the guy who plays R2D2) has mustered up $10,000 in cash to pay off his partner John Carter (James Burke, no relation to John Carter of Mars), but Carter pulls a double cross and hires strong man Goliath (Nat Pendleton) and cigar chomping dwarf Atom (Jerry Maren of the Lollipop Guild in Wizard of Oz – still kicking at 92 as of this posting) to steal the money so he can gain control of the circus. Roustabouts Antonio (Chico Marx) and Punchy (Harpo Marx) enlist the aide of shyster lawyer J. Cheever Loophole (Groucho Marx) to help get Jeff’s money back.\n\nWhy I Bought It:\n\nI actually didn’t buy this one, it was a Christmas gift, part of a Marx Brothers DVD collection. This is not my favorite Brothers outing. Much of it is a little blah. Part of the reason is the reliance on sometimes overly complex (for the Marx Brothers anyway) physical comedy situations, a direct result of the studio’s hiring the legendary Buster Keaton to work for scale as a gag man. Keaton is a genius, but his style of comedy and the Brothers’ just doesn’t mix very well. The set ups should be very funny (Groucho walking on the ceiling in suction boots with the lovely Eve Adren, Goliath’s acrobat girlfriend), a guy in a gorilla suit, a high falootin’ orchestra getting cast adrift on a floating band shell, etc, but they don’t pan out somehow.\n\nThat said, there are a couple very funny scenes, including the Brothers knocking over Jerry Maren’s small-sized furniture and hitting their heads on his low ceiling (and Groucho’s repeated attempts to procure one of the dwarf’s cigars – ‘Say, do you happen to have a spare cigar?’ – only to be constantly undermined by Chico, who somehow always has a spare cigar in his coat), the usual excellent wooing banter between Groucho and the put upon but perennially loaded Margaret Dumont, and a hilarious bit where Harpo and Chico search the sleeping strongman’s room for the money and end up cutting the guy’s blanket to ribbons while Harpo is inadverdantly drugged. There are a couple of pretty funny lines (Chico hands a wrinkled telegram in to be sent and the clerk says ‘Is this a straight wire?’ Chico: ‘Nah, I think I bent it up a little.’), and a nice Harpo musical number sung with an all African American ensemble (including Dudley Dickerson, the eternally scared overweight guy that appeared later in several Three Stooges outings), Swingali, that’s worth mentioning because a of a beautiful rendition of Blue Moon he plays on the harp, to the apparent awe of one very photogenic little girl.\n\nThe love story is even more incidental than usual. I don’t even remember what happens to Jeff’s fiance, and I just watched this last night.\n\nBest Dialogue:\n\nGoliath’s girlfriend Peerless Pauline has been rebuffing Groucho’s advances until she decides she can throw him off her boyfriend’s case.\n\nPauline: You know, last night I decided something. You’re the man I’ve been dreaming of.\n\nGroucho: What do you eat before you go to bed?!\n\nBest Scene:\n\nThere is one scene that elevates At The Circus above its relative mediocrity, one of the classic scenes of all cinema. Funny enough, it’s a musical number, which is not something Marx Brothers comedies are generally known for.\n\nBut early in the movie Groucho sings Lydia The Tattooed Lady in a crowded dining car as his brothers caper about and swing from the chandelier. It’s just one of the most joyous and fun sequences ever committed to film. Great song (including a reference to Captain Spaulding, Groucho’s character from Animal Crackers), great rendition, great performance. Judge for yourself. But my two year old little girl stared singing ‘Lydia O Lydia’ while I watched this.\n\nWould I Buy It Again? Tough call. I love Lydia, but I could probably watch it on Youtube. This has it’s moments, but I don’t think I would have purchased it myself. I’d save my money for Duck Soup.\n\nNext Up In The Queue: Atlantis: The Lost Empire\n\nI’ve decided to institute a new (ir)regular feature here on Delirium Tremens.\n\nI watch a lot of movies. A LOT.\n\nBut I don’t take home everything I’ve seen. For me to pay for a movie again past the initial theatrical viewing or rental, that movie has really got to speak to me on some level that will induce me to not only want to revisit it at my leisure, but to send a monetary message to the creators that I appreciated their work (altough in taking stock of what I have, there are a couple titles I was given as gifts that I haven’t even watched yet!).\n\nThat said, I own something over two hundred movies, give or take. So yeah, lots of appreciation there.\n\nIn part to give me something more to do on this blog than just plug my work, and in part to justify my owning all these dang DVD’s and Blu-Rays, I’m going to go through my collection alphabetically and start revisiting and reviewing them here.\n\nI’m no film critic. At least, no more than anybody else. I went to film school yeah, but I promise I’ll keep the mise en scene and chiaroscuro comments to a minimum. I’ve got opinions, and I’ve got memories of the movies on this list, and I’ll share them. That’s it. Oh and there’ll probably be spoilers. So I’m telling you now ‘cause I don’t intend to write it over every single review. Most of these are a couple years old anyway, or will be by the time I get to ‘em.\n\nHere’s the list, which I’ll update if I make new purchases. I also intend to replace the reviewed titles with hyperlinks to the reviews as I write them for ease of reference (if I can figure out how to do that). This should take me a while to get through. No promises as to regularity, but eventually, one day, I’ll get to the end. Maybe it’ll even be fun.\n\nAnyway, here’s the list of my collection. Don’t expect to see too many scathing reviews here. Like I said, I don’t buy stuff I don’t like, and anyway I don’t have the time or energy to complain about things I don’t like. Better to celebrate things I do, right? Right.\n\nAs always, feel free to comment, if you’re so inclined.\n\n8 Mile\n\n300\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood\n\nThe Agony And The Ecstacy\n\nAlien\n\nAliens\n\nThe Apostle\n\nAt The Circus\n\nAtlantis: The Los Empire\n\nAttack The Block\n\nBack To The Future\n\nBack To The Future II\n\nBack To The Future III\n\nBad Company\n\nBatman Begins\n\nThe Beast Must Die\n\nBen-Hur\n\nBeneath The Planet Of The Apes\n\nBetter Off Dead\n\nBig Trouble In Little China\n\nThe Black Hole\n\nThe Black Swan\n\nBlade\n\nBlade Runner 2049\n\nThe Blind Swordsman: Zatoichi\n\nThe Blood of Heroes\n\nBonnie and Clyde\n\nThe Brides Of Dracula\n\nBronco Billy\n\nBuffalo Soldiers\n\nA Bullet For The General\n\nButch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid\n\nCabin In The Woods\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nCaptain Blood\n\nThe Car\n\nCasino Royale\n\nChato’s Land\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The WardrobeThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe\n\nCimarron\n\nClash Of The Titans\n\nCloverfield\n\nConan The Barbarian\n\nConquest of The Planet of The Apes\n\nConstantine\n\nCool Hand Luke\n\nCrank\n\nCross Of Iron\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nCurse Of The Demon (aka Night Of The Demon)\n\nCyrano De Bergerac\n\nDaimajin/Wrath of Daimajin\n\nDances With Wolves\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises\n\nDaredevil\n\nThe Dark Crystal\n\nA Day At The Races\n\nDead Man\n\nThe Deadpool\n\nDestry Rides Again\n\nDiamonds Are Forever\n\nDie Another Day\n\nDie Hard\n\nDillinger\n\nDirty Harry\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nDog Soldiers\n\nDown With Love\n\nDr. No\n\nDragonslayer\n\nDrive\n\nThe Driver\n\nDungeons and Dragons\n\nThe Enforcer\n\nEnter The Dragon\n\nEscape From New York\n\nEscape From The Planet Of The Apes\n\nE.T.
