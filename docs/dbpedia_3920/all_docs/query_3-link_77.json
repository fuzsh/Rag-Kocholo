        "text": "If you were a famous comic act in the first half of the twentieth century, you probably made a comedy western. Charlie Chaplin (if you count The Gold Rush), Harold Lloyd, Bob Hope, Abbot and Costello, W C Fields, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Brothers all made a foray into the genre.\n\nIt is easy to see why. While there have been many great westerns, there are aspects of the genre that lend themselves to mockery. The relentless machismo of the western heroes and villains is a long way from the persona of the average comedy actor, who is typically of smaller or less impressive physical stature, and not given to heroic or courageous gestures.\n\nNaturally the difference between the humorous little man and the tough world out west was good comic pickings for Buster Keaton. The actor, whose height stood at five foot four, and whose body was hardly muscle-bound, would provide a humorous contrast to the well-built cowboys working on a ranch.\n\nOf course while Keaton was no body-builder, he was spry and athletic, and performed his own stunts, some of them so dangerous that he suffered a number of injuries during his years in acting. He even broke his neck while making Sherlock Jr. Anyone who has seen a building nearly fall on Keaton in Steamboat Bill Jr, or watched his waterfall stunts in Our Hospitality may well wonder how he lived to see his 70th birthday.\n\nKeaton turned to the western genre a number of times in his career, but mostly in shorts such as The Paleface and The Frozen North. There are elements of The General and Our Hospitality which might make them seem like westerns, but they are not usually so classified, so the only one of Keaton’s feature-length movies that can be called a western is Go West.\n\nThe title comes from an expression by Horace Greeley, a newspaper editor, who is famously credited with popularising the slogan, “Go west, young man, go west”. This was an invitation for people living in the crowded east to expand into the uncolonised areas in the west. Later the Marx Brothers would also use Greeley’s slogan as the title for their comic western.\n\nIn Buster Keaton’s comedy, the man who is inspired to go west is an unemployed drifter who is simply called Friendless (played, of course, by Keaton). Due to his friendless condition, he is always on the move to new places. We first see him using a rope to drag all his worldly possessions, one of which is a bed. These will be sold in exchange for a few paltry dollars that are soon gone.\n\nThe city is no place for Friendless, who does not fit in with the residents. He is jostled and trampled on by passing crowds, and knocked over by a passing vehicle. So Friendless takes the advice of Horace Greeley, and hitches a lift on a train going west. Here he soon finds work on a cattle ranch, where much humour is to be found in watching the inexperienced and physically inadequate Friendless struggling to adjust.\n\nFriendless certainly does not seem like someone who will last long out there. Carrying an undersized gun and riding an oversized horse, he can barely walk straight in his ill-fitting clothes. His idea of milking a cow is putting the pail under the animal and coaxing it to produce milk of its own accord.\n\nStill anyone who is familiar with Buster Keaton’s longer movies will not be surprised to find that our hero, comically inept in some ways, will find ingenious methods to overcome his problems. Soon Friendless is pulling the tiny gun from out of his large holster using a string, and ascending his large horse with the aid of a rope ladder.\n\nNonetheless the gentle Friendless is out of touch with the virile cowhands. Keaton neatly captures the outsider status of Friendless at mealtimes when our hero either arrives too late to get any food and leaves hungry, or arrives too early and has finished eating by the time the other workers arrive. These comical scenes serve to show that he remains outside the social lives of his fellow-workers.\n\nNot to worry. Friendless does not remain friendless for long. In this new world he soon finds female company. No, not a love interest, although there is some potential for a future romance between Friendless and the ranch owner’s daughter (Kathleen Myers). The ending of the film teases us with the prospect of a marriage, but this is neatly subverted when Friendless chooses an unusual but endearing alternative.\n\nI am talking about Brown Eyes, a rather fetching cow who lives on the ranch. Friendless sees Brown Eyes limping, and removes a stone from between her hooves. She returns the favour by rescuing him from a charging bull. To this, Friendless responds by doffing his hat to her, a gesture that establishes her as the film’s leading lady.\n\nLike Friendless, Brown Eyes is something of an outcast among the other cattle. Friendless seeks to protect her in a number of ways. He stands on guard against a couple of howling wolves, but this incident ends in an amusing twist. He helps her to stand up to the other cows by fixing a pair of fake horns on her head. Rather than force her to endure the pain of a branding, he shaves the shape of the ranch brand on her leg.\n\nHowever this is a ranch, and Friendless is unable to prevent the owner from adding Brown Eyes to the carriages of cattle being sent to slaughter. Fortunately for Friendless and Brown Eyes, a rival rancher arranges for the train to be ambushed, and it is left to Friendless to retrieve the cattle and obtain a reprieve for Brown Eyes.\n\nAs with most of Keaton’s feature-length movies, he has a curious relationship with conventional society. Keaton promotes the little man, the quirky individualist who does not fit in with those around him, and he does not make the regular norms of that society seem desirable. In films such as The General and Steamboat Bill Jr, Keaton’s character is viewed with disapproval by a society that is almost barbaric in its primitive concepts of masculinity.\n\nNonetheless Keaton ultimately comes down on the side of conformity. While never losing his idiosyncrasies, the Keaton hero is obligated to ‘man up’ in order to fit in with the world around him, rather than allowed to follow his own path.\n\nThe films typically end with Keaton gaining the acceptance of this tough, masculine society. Contrast this with the Chaplin hero, a tramp who often ends the films as he began – an outcast wandering the streets. In this sense, Chaplin is the more radical film-maker in his personal views. Keaton’s hero may be an outsider who is picked on by the establishment, but all he wants to do is become part of that establishment, and win its approval.\n\nGo West is no exception here. Keaton may mock the conventions of western heroism, and most of the cow hands seem obnoxious rather than hardy and tough. Nonetheless, Friendless must prove that he is worthy to be a member of the ranch by performing acts of heroism. The film will not end when they not accept him for who he is. He must become more like them.\n\nStill the Keaton hero is always true to himself in a way. He has a certain persona that is consistent in every film. Indeed Keaton has fun making jokes about his own image. In the late part of this film Friendless is forced to don a fancy dress costume in the guise of the devil for certain complicated reasons. Here he finds that the horns on the outfit prevent him from wearing his conventional porkpie hat, giving him several moments of anxiety before he reluctantly agrees to discard the hat.\n\nIn another scene, a cow hand pulls a gun on Friendless, and insists that he smile. It is a trademark of Keaton, known affectionately as ‘The Great Stone Face’ that he never smiles in his movies, since his actions seem more comical when he has a serious expression. Friendless is therefore forced to use his fingers to create a smile.\n\nOf course fans of Fatty Arbuckle movies will recall that Keaton often used to smile and laugh in these earlier movies before he adopted his later po-faced persona. Speaking of Arbuckle, we briefly glimpse the disgraced comedy actor in Go West. Arbuckle’s films helped to bring Keaton to notice. While Keaton was a supporting actor in them, Arbuckle generously allowed Keaton plenty of screen time in which to perform humorous skits.\n\nBy 1925, Arbuckle was mired in a sexual scandal, and his career as a major comedy actor was over. However Keaton believed that Arbuckle was innocent of any offence, and still felt gratitude towards his former colleague.\n\nIn the scene where the cattle raid a department store, we see a fat woman in distress. In the close-ups she is played by Babe London. In the long shots, she is played by Arbuckle in drag. What poor Babe London thought of this arrangement is anyone’s guess.\n\nSince I have mentioned cows in department stores, it is time to briefly remind ourselves how weird and unusual Keaton’s films could be. We might make the mistake of imagining that Keaton was a director of slapstick comedy, or that this is the only kind of comedy we could expect to see in silent cinema.\n\nIt is certainly true that Keaton includes much physical comedy, some of which is basic slapstick – pratfalls, incompetent police officers who carry a distinct hint of the Keystone Cops, citizens being accidentally sprayed with a hose etc.\n\nHowever Keaton’s humour transcends mere slapstick. He uses visuals to establish character-based humour when setting up his hero as the underdog. There are also moments in Keaton’s comedies that approach surrealism.\n\nTowards the end of Go West, Friendless drives the herd of cattle across the middle of a busy town centre and this leads to some bizarre and incongruous imagery. The cows are seen running around the railway station. Later they invade a barber shop, a department store, several shops and a Turkish Bath.\n\nThe urban world in which Friendless once felt displaced is suddenly thrown into disorder. Everyday street life descends into a chaos of crashing cars, blundering police officers, and men wearing roller skates or riding on the backs of cattle ,while Friendless runs down the street dressed as the devil.\n\nThis was a film close to Buster Keaton’s heart. He named it as his personal favourite, and he even claimed a directorial credit for once. As ever Keaton performed his own stunts. He even trained Brown Eyes for her part, so that he could achieve a personal bond with his co-star.\n\nWhile Go West is perhaps not quite on a par with the very best Buster Keaton films, it is very good indeed. Once more Keaton showed his fine grasp of humour, both subtle and brash, and his mastery of major action set-pieces which allow the momentum to build up and end the film on a high note."
