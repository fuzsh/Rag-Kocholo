        "text": "The Greeley community was rocked when news spread that long-time residents and volunteers Dr. Robert “Bob” Kahn and his wife, Monica Kahn, were tragically killed on Feb. 3 in a rollover crash during their annual trek to South Padre Island, Texas.\n\nWhile the Kahns were well known for their giving spirit to local nonprofits, their love for the western culture and lifestyle was on full display during their active participation in the Go West Film Fest.\n\nThe couple joined the board in 2014, shortly after the first film festival kicked off.\n\n“Monica and Bob loved to dress up in their western gear each year for the festival and to discuss the movies with everyone,” said Thelma Bear Edgerton, film festival board member. “They watched and critiqued all the movies, providing feedback and advocacy when we chose films for the festival each year.”\n\nOne of Monica Kahn’s goals each year was to provide busses to local homes for the aging that would transport them to events during the film festival.\n\n“Though that never happened, Monica would try to make it a reality every year,” Edgerton said.\n\nIn addition to serving on the board and helping choose the lineup for the festival each year, the Kahns hosted board members and festival guests at their home, served as MCs during screenings, helped advertise the festival and sought donations from local businesses and organizations.\n\nThis year the Go West Film Fest will honor the work of Bob and Monica Kahn with a tribute in the printed program, slides of their photos shown before movie screenings and mentions of the couple during ringmaster introductions.\n\nDavid Caldwell and Ron Edgerton, co-presidents of the festival’s board of directors, wrote an “In Memoriam” piece that is posted on the event’s website.\n\n“So long, Monica and Bob! Our trail westward will be harder without you. Your spirits will help keep us out of the ruts,” the co-presidents wrote at the end of the piece.\n\nWhile the Kahns are no longer here to revel in the fun and spirit of the annual film festival, their daughter, Elizabeth Kahn-Lanning and her husband, Greg Lanning, are carrying on their parents’ spirits by filling their empty seats on the board.\n\n“They always loved Westerns and the West, and they had a similar immigrant story moving to Colorado and Greeley,” explained Elizabeth Kahn-Lanning. “Since they died, life has kind of been turned upside down. Greg and I were both just really inspired just talking to people about all the things my parents did. And I think that really inspired Greg and I jump in to try and at least fill a little bit of their void.”\n\nLike the Kahns, the Lannings are huge Western buffs and often talked Western movies with their folks.\n\n“We used to share Western film lists and TV lists with my parents.They really got into it,” Elizabeth Kahn-Lanning said. “And I grew up in Greeley and we would always go to the Stampede and I know my parents loved to go. We always went to the concerts and rodeos.”\n\nDuring the pandemic, the Lannings turned their parents on to the television show, “Hell on Wheels” which the Kahns ended up loving and binging.\n\n“We know that no one can fill their shoes; they were just kind of incredible,” Elizabeth Kahn-Lanning said. “I am sure that they would be really happy that we moved to northern Colorado and are trying to get involved in our community here in Estes and the community in Greeley.”\n\nThe 9th annual Go West Film Fest rides into town at 4:30 p.m. Monday, Nov. 6 and continues through 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 11.\n\nThe annual festival showcases a variety of classic and contemporary western films as well as documentaries focusing on the western culture and lifestyle.\n\nSome of the movies attendees can enjoy at this year’s event include “Nope,” “Jews of the Wild West,” “No Name on the Bullet” and “One Sky Above Us.”\n\n“These films are carefully chosen by the board and recommended on that level,” Greg Lanning said.\n\n“And these films really do hold up over time,” Elizabeth Kahn-Lanning added.\n\nThe festival will be hosting three local movie producers and directors along with two receptions and numerous meet-and-greets throughout the festival.\n\nEvents are scheduled to take place at the Kress Cinema and Lounge, the new LINC library and the University of Northern Colorado.\n\nCheck out the full schedule of events by going to https://bit.ly/3Sc3EbK.\n\nOnce again, northern Colorado native Cody Kuehl provided art for the festival’s posters, donating the use of his piece “American Lullaby.”\n\nIn 2022, Kuehl partnered with the Greeley Stampede for its 100th celebration to create a mural in one of the stairwells leading up into the arena.\n\nGuests to the film festival will have a chance to take home one of the festival’s 18-inch by 24-inch posters for a donation of $50 or more and enter a drawing for a prize package from Greeley Hat Works for a combined value of $750.\n\nTo learn more about Kuehl and his work, go to artofcodykuehl.com.\n\nThis year’s event is sponsored by:\n\nHigh Plains Library District\n\nWeld Community Foundation Arts Alive!\n\nGreeley Lifestyle Magazine\n\nGreeley Stampede\n\nYoder Family of Companies and Weld County Garage\n\nColorado Office of Film, Television and Media\n\nGreeley Hat Works\n\nKress Cinema and Lounge\n\nDr. Douglas Armbrust\n\nFrom classics to contemporary, the Go West Film Fest features a variety of flicks for fans of western culture. (Courtesy/Amazon)Admission to all of the film screenings, receptions, meet-and-greets, guest talks and events are free."
