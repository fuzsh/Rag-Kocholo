        "text": "Sebastian Stan and Lily James are set to take lead roles in a new psychological horror thriller titled, “Let The Evil Go West.” The film hails from Danish director Christian Tafdrup (the original 2022 version of “Speak No Evil”), and Xc Vs penned the script. In the movie, eerie events start to unravel after a railroad worker discovers a fortune, which becomes more of a curse as horrific visions/manifestations begin to transpire.\n\nThis pairing makes a noticeable reunion of sorts as the duo, Stan and James, previously worked together on the acclaimed Hulu series “Pam & Tommy,” which explored the media fallout after Pamela Anderson and Mötley Crüe rocker Tommy Lee’s sex tape was stolen from their home and then made public during the early days of the internet in the 1990s.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The Apprentice’ First Look: Sebastian Stan is Young Donald Trump Alongside Jeremy Strong In New Cannes Drama\n\nBelow is the film’s synopsis that Star Thrower Entertainment provided:\n\n“Let the Evil Go West” follows a railroad worker who stumbles upon a fortune under deeply disturbing circumstances. As horrifying visions and manifestations drive him toward madness, his wife becomes convinced that an evil presence has attached itself to their family.\n\nTardup’s “Speak No Evil” was recently remade by Blumhouse Pictures and arrives this September. The Danish helmer is also known for the Danish dramas “Parents” (2016) and “A Terrible Woman” (2017).\n\nJames is coming off an appearance in “The Iron Claw” and will be seen next in the indie “Greedy People” and the thriller “Relay” from filmmaker David McKenzie.\n\nStan is currently shooting the Marvel Studios film “Thunderbolts” in Atlanta alongside the likes of Florence Pugh, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and David Harbour. He also recently wrapped up his biopic of former President Donald Trump in the Cannes-bound “The Apprentice,” where he plays a younger version of Trump long before his reality show stint on NBC and troublesome entry into politics."
