        "text": "Obituaries\n\nAn obituary on Wednesday about Irving Brecher, a writer for vaudeville, movies and television, included several errors.\n\nThe given name of a producer whom Mr. Brecher angered, telling him that one of his films had not been released but had escaped, was misspelled. He was Darryl Zanuck, not Daryl.\n\nPart of a line written by Mr. Brecher and spoken by a rain-drenched Groucho Marx in the film “At the Circus” was misstated. The line is, “If I were any drier, I’d drown,” not “I’d be drowning.”\n\nAnd Mervyn LeRoy, for whom Mr. Brecher wrote scripts, was not the head of production at M.G.M., though many sources attributed that position to him. (He was, however, considered the most prominent of the studio’s producers and directors.) (Go to Article)\n\nInternational\n\nBecause of an editing error, an article on Nov. 14 about a criminal complaint filed by human rights lawyers in the 1989 killing of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador erroneously included two people among those the lawyers accused of having had a role in the murders or in the cover-up that followed. The complaint named the Salvadoran president at the time, Alfredo Cristiani Burkard, who was accused of a cover-up, and 14 former members of the Salvadoran military; it did not implicate two female employees of the priests. The two were victims of the attack and died along with the priests. (Go to Article)\n\nNew York\n\nThe credit for a picture on Wednesday with an article about the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s plans to seek a 23 percent increase in fare and toll revenues next year misspelled the photographer’s surname. The picture of the Seneca Avenue station on the M line in Queens was by Jacob Silberberg for The New York Times, not Silverberg. (Go to Article)\n\nBusiness Day\n\nAn article on Thursday about Summit Entertainment, the studio releasing the teenage vampire film “Twilight,” misspelled the surname of one of the movie’s lead actors. He is Robert Pattinson, not Pattison. (Go to Article)\n\nSports\n\nThe Sports of The Times column on Thursday, about the years of frustration for fans of Major League Soccer’s New York area franchise before the Red Bulls’ current playoff run, misstated the nickname of the Chicago team, which captured the 2003 United States Open Cup by defeating the New York squad (then the MetroStars). It is the Fire, not the Sting. The column also misstated part of the Internet address for a Red Bulls fan Web site. It is www.ragingbullnation.net. (Go to Article)\n\nWeekend\n\nAn art review on Friday about an installation by Pipilotti Rist in the Museum of Modern Art’s second-floor lobby atrium misstated the volume of the atrium and part of the work’s title that cites that measurement. The work is “Pour Your Body Out (7354 Cubic Meters),” not (7534 Cubic Meters). (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nAn art review on Friday about “Art and Love in Renaissance Italy,” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and an accompanying picture caption, misstated the given name of the painter of “Portrait of a Man and Woman at a Casement” in some editions. He was Fra Filippo Lippi, not Fra Lippo Lippi. (Go to Article)\n\n\n\nA listing of credits on Friday with a film review of “Were the World Mine” misspelled the surname of the film’s editor. She is Jennifer Lilly, not Lily. (Go to Article)\n\nThe Times welcomes comments and suggestions, or complaints about errors that warrant correction.
