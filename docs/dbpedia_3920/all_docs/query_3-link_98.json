It features the Commando throughout so I thought I'd give you guys/gals a heads up. here is a link for the movie hope you enjoy.\n\nhttp://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=one ... FORM=VIRE1\n\nOld thread! But, I recently saw this movie on my local digi TV service and really like it. Even got the Wife to re-watch it with me and she liked it (but generally hates motorbikes).\n\nShe mention that the guy outside the motel one night chatting with the main character is none other than Gord Downey....who just passed away this Summer. In the scene, he tells the main guy he beat down a butt load of brain cancer....eerie b/c the 2008 movie foreshadowed what Downey just died of...he could not have had that diagnosis back then.\n\nWatching that movie really brings life into perspective. My dream when I was 20 was the take my 52 GMC camper by myself and travel down the west coast hitting all the beaches, meeting people along the way and just keep on driving until I found myself. A search for my identity and purpose in life.\n\nI never made that journey but I did find myself and purpose in life.\n\nMy greatest achievement was raising a family.\n\nI will make that journey some day.\n\nCheck out the Chinese Bank ad called TC Bank Dream Rangers. It's in the same vein as One Week. I've posted the u-tube link. It always makes me a bit misty eyed. It's about a group of friends who go on one more motorcycle trip before they are too incapacitated to ride. I read about this trip in one of the motorcycle magazines. Can't remember which mag, though.\n\nHey guys I wanted to let you know about a film called One Week (2008), it's about a young man who is diagnosed with terminal cancer, who then finds a 1973 Norton Commando and heads for the West Coast on a journey to help him deal with his illness.

FORM=VIRE1\n\n850 or a 750?\n\nI'd be inclined to watch it if its an 850, will pass if it's a 750.\n\nJust kidding\n\nBack in '08 , One Week screened only in Halifax at a now gone artsy cinema ... my wife and I made the hour long drive down to see it ... we enjoyed it then , sure we would enjoy it now .... this past spring with age catching me , I decided to do my own version ... prepped my 10 year old Ducati and shipped it to Edmonton ... rode solo out to BC then several back and firths through the Mountains then headed East all the way back to Truro NS solo unsupported... when I dreamed up that ride back in day it involved a britbike funny by time I got it done 45 yrs later it was on different bike ... suggest anyone who has thought about should get it done , sure glad I did even if I left my Norton home ... and I did include almost entire breadth of Canada not just T.O. to BC\n\nCraig\n\nSo if you are going to ride across Canada - do the Trans Canada Quest:\n\nTrans Canada Quest;\n\nVancouver to Halifax ( or reverse)\n\nTrans Canada Quest--from Halifax to Vancouver (or reverse) in less than 90 hours\n\nTrans Canada Insanity--from Halifax to Vancouver to Halifax (or reverse) in less than 192 hours\n\nTrans Canada Gold--from Halifax to Vancouver (or reverse) in less than 75 hours\n\nTrans Canada Gold Insanity--from Halifax to Vancouver to Halifax (or reverse) in less than 150 hours\n\nthe standing one way time record is 59hrs-36min by Thane Silliker\n\nrules of the ride at : http://www.ironbutt.com/themerides/ssseries/\n\nJust catching up & saw Guido's comment about the West Coast. In May 1977 my closest friends moved to Amsterdam, I delayed because I had a trip to do first...\n\nI'd always wanted to hitch hike in the US, so I hitched up the West Coast from L.A. to Vancouver Island & then east through Seattle, across the US to Chicago, down to Fort Wayne (Johnny Appleseed) & finally up to New York & home to the UK. I had a fantastic time, experienced wonderful hospitality (I spent only 3 nights in a hotel - at the San Francisco YMCA), met up with some friends & met a fantastic range of people (Vietnam vets, ex-cons, business folk, tax inspector, fisherman, etc..). Not without its drama e.g. an attempted mugging at knifepoint in Times Square (where I courteously explained that I had no money & after a long conversation we parted as 'friends'); or explaining to the Seattle US Customs & Immigration on re-entry why I hadn't handed in my visa when leaving the US to go into Canada (I don't think I could get away with that today!).\n\nI moved to Amsterdam at the end of October to meet up with the rest of the London contingent & stayed there for 21 years, happy days...\n\nGuido, sort your camper van out & go enjoy yourself!\n\nMike"
