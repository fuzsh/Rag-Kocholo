Quentin Quale is heading west to find his fortune; he meets the crafty but simple brothers Joseph and Rusty Panello in a train station, where they steal all his money. They're heading west, too, because they've heard you can just pick the gold off the ground. Once there, they befriend an old miner named Dan Wilson whose property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. They loan him their last ten dollars so he can go start life anew, and for collateral, he gives them the deed to the Gulch. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival, Terry Turner (who's also in love with his daughter, Eva), has contacted the railroad to arrange for them to build through the land, making the old man rich and hopefully resolving the feud. But the evil Red Baxter, owner of a saloon, tricks the boys out of the deed, and it's up to them - as well as Quale, who naturally finds his way out west anyway - to save the day.",

        "text": "It goes without saying that the comedy is great, even if it's not on par with the best Marx Brothers work. Groucho in particular had me cracking up in the first half of the film. And like any good Marx Brothers movie, they prove themselves masters of rake gags, especially with the coach scene and the money exchange scene. For the most part, the comedy is enjoyable, even if it isn't fresh or inspired.\n\nThe music is decent, too, especially Harpo's harp performance, which is one of the better harp moments that I've seen from him. The duet with the Native American chief starts out trying to be funny, but then settles into a pretty little, high and sweet jazz…\n\nAn ambitious film when you consider the usual plotlines of the Marx Brothers. This obviously puts them in a Western setting with saloons, gunfights, a train, and all the trademarks of the time period.\n\nAll the sets were rendered with fair accuracy. Although I'm sure they weren't 100% spot on, I felt the design pulling me into the... story? Yeah, believe it or not, they actually have a story to follow. But knowing the Marx Brothers, you usually get humor or story, and it's mostly the latter. Never both.\n\nAlthough Chico and Groucho have plenty of puns and witty comebacks, Harpo barely gets any time to shine. My bias for him may have impacted my overall enjoyment. He's in just…\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Are you insinuating that the white man is not the Indian's friend? Ha! Who swindled you out of Manhattan Island for 24 dollars?\n\nJoseph Panello: White man.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Who turned you into wood and stood you in front of a cigar store?\n\nJoseph Panello: White man.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Who put your head on a nickel and then took the nickel away?\n\nJoseph Panello: Slot machine.\n\nS. Quentin Quale: Members of the tribe - I rest my case.\n\nIt's taken me 64 years to finally cross this off my Marx Bros. watchlist, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it's nowhere near the bottom of the pile in terms of quality. To be sure,…"
