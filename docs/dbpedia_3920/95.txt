The cover of Irving Brecher’s forthcoming memoirs, which are due out at the beginning of next year, bills him as “the last great Golden-Age screenwriter”. While film historians may argue over the validity of the claim, Brecher can draw on memories of a career in which he worked with such legendary figures as the Marx Brothers, Judy Garland, Vincente Minnelli, Jack Benny and Fred Astaire.

He wrote two Marx Brothers films, At the Circus (1939) and Go West (1940), he was called in to try to add more comedy to The Wizard of Oz (1939) — his memoirs are entitled The Wicked Wit of the West — and he got his only Oscar nomination for the Judy Garland film Meet Me in St Louis (1944).
