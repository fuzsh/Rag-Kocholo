        "text": "Overview\n\nSecurity status\n\nDo Not Travel\n\nLatest Travel Alert\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, the Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt).\n\nThe ongoing attacks pose a significant security risk and a State of Emergency is in place.\n\nFor citizens currently in Israel, please avoid all travel to areas surrounding the Gaza Strip, within 500m of the border with Syria (the ‘Alpha Line’) and within 54km of the border with Lebanon, and recently evacuated communities in northern Israel, due to ongoing military operations.\n\nIrish citizens currently in Israel or the occupied Palestinian territory who have not already done so, please register with the Embassy here.\n\nThis is a developing situation, with the potential for intense escalation.\n\nMilitary operations and rocket fire are expected to continue, and we urge all citizens in Israel to continue to follow local guidance by downloading the Home Front Command app on their mobile phone (Apple, Google Play).\n\nFor citizens already in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), including East Jerusalem, a number of crossings into Jordan are open, but with some restrictions. The majority of crossing between the West Bank, Jerusalem and Israel remain closed; please contact the Representative Office in Ramallah should you require advice on crossings by emailing RORamallah@dfa.ie. Citizens in the Gaza Strip are advised to exercise extreme caution, and register their presence immediately here.\n\nFor the latest updates please follow the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv here and our Representative Office in Ramallah here. For urgent consular assistance please contact: +972 369 64166 or +353 (1) 408 2000.\n\nTLV Airport remains open but many airlines have suspended or cancelled flights. You can check on the status of your flight here.\n\nThis is a developing situation, with the potential for intense escalation. Please monitor local media regularly, follow the advice of local authorities, and observe any additional security measures imposed during this time. Please contact your airline for relevant updates prior to travel.\n\nTravel to Israel and the Occupied Territories\n\nFor Irish citizens choosing to travel against the current Travel Advice, please be aware that Israeli law allows immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott. Please contact the Israeli Embassy in Dublin if you require further information. For information relating to visa requirements more generally, please consult the Embassy of Israel in Dublin\n\nGeneral Travel Advice\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt) at this time. For Irish citizens choosing to travel against the current Travel Advice, please be aware that the security situation is unpredictable and fragile at present.\n\nPlease follow advice from local authorities and stay informed of the security situation. All demonstrations and public gatherings should be avoided.\n\nSafety and security\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, the Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens already present in the country.\n\nIf already in Israel or the oPt, you should keep up to date with local media on developments that could lead to an outbreak of regional military conflict and make your travel plans accordingly.\n\nCrime\n\nCrime remains relatively low but you should take sensible precautions:\n\nDon’t carry your credit card, travel tickets and money together - leave spare cash and valuables in a safe place.\n\nCarry a copy of your passport rather than the passport itself. It is also advisable to keep a physical or electronic copy of your passport (and travel and insurance documents) somewhere safe.\n\nAvoid showing large sums of money in public and don’t use ATMs after dark, especially if you’re alone. Check no one has followed you after conducting your business.\n\nAvoid dark and unlit streets and stairways, and arrange to be picked up or dropped off as close to your hotel or apartment entrance as possible.\n\nKeep a close eye on your personal belongings and hold on to them in public places such as internet cafés, train and bus stations. If you’re a victim of a crime while in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, report it to the local police immediately. Should you require further assistance, please contact the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\nDriving\n\nCare is advised. Driving is sometimes erratic and there are frequent accidents. Radar speed traps operate on Israeli roads and fines for speeding are high. If you’re caught speeding, you may also have your licence confiscated.\n\nBring your international driving licence and have adequate and appropriate insurance\n\nDriving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is against the law and you risk being detained, fined or banned from driving if caught\n\nKeep your vehicle doors locked and your bags kept out of sight to prevent opportunistic bag-snatching when stopped at traffic lights\n\nVehicle hire\n\nIf hiring a vehicle, we advise you not to hand over your passport as a form of security. If you’re allowing your passport to be photocopied, keep it in your sight at all times. If you are planning to drive in the West Bank, please note that not all car hire companies or insurance companies cover travel into the West Bank.\n\nCheck that you have adequate insurance and read the small print of the vehicle hire contract (particularly any waiver that will come into effect if the vehicle is damaged).\n\nHitchhiking\n\nIt’s not safe to hitchhike.\n\nTravelling to the desert\n\nIf travelling in the desert:\n\nDo not travel alone\n\nCarry a sufficient supply of water and suncream\n\nIt is advisable to wear a sunhat, sunglasses and light loose-fitting clothing\n\nTake a mobile phone\n\nMake sure that somebody is aware of your itinerary and your expected time of return\n\nLocal laws and customs\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, the Department of Foreign Affairs strongly advises against all travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). The specific advice below may be relevant to citizens already present in the country.\n\nLocal culture\n\nYou will notice a mix of religions and cultures in Israel and the oPt. Many people feel strongly about their beliefs and customs and you should be aware of local cultural mores at all times.\n\nDress modestly at pilgrimage sites and in religious areas.\n\nBe sensitive when taking pictures of people in Muslim and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods.\n\nAvoid taking photographs of military police personnel or installations.\n\nDo not drive in Jewish Ultra-Orthodox areas, particularly in Jerusalem, notably Mea She'arim, on Shabbat (sunset Friday to approximately one hour after sunset on Saturday). For those observing the Jewish Sabbath, driving in their districts is prohibited under all circumstances except in instances of a life-threatening emergency.\n\nDuring Ramadan, eating, drinking and smoking between sunrise and sunset are forbidden for Muslims over the age of 8. Although alcohol will be available in some hotels and restaurants, drinking alcohol elsewhere may cause offence. As a courtesy, you should avoid drinking, eating, and smoking in public places during Ramadan. Ramadan dates vary each year; in 2023, Ramadan will begin on or about 22 March.\n\nLGBT+ Travellers\n\nAttitudes towards LGBT+ travellers vary across Israel and the oPt.\n\nIsraeli law does not criminalise same-sex sexual relations between consenting adults, and Israel is considered to be the most progressive country in the Middle East in this regard. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in the West Bank but is illegal in Gaza, where it carries a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment.\n\nHomosexuality is rejected within socially and religiously conservative spheres in both Israeli and Palestinian societies. All public displays of affection, regardless of the gender or sexuality of those involved, may attract negative attention in parts of the West Bank, and in more conservative Israeli areas, including ultra-Orthodox communities. Homosexuality remains largely taboo in Palestinian society.\n\nTel Aviv has a large, active LGBT+ community, and is considered a welcoming destination for LGBT+ visitors. The annual Tel Aviv Pride, which takes place is June, attracts gatherings of hundreds of thousands each year. An annual Pride Parade also takes place in Jerusalem, however on a much smaller scale, and continues to faces strong criticism from Israel’s ultra-religious community, including violent attacks, notably the fatal stabbing of a 16-year-old in 2015.\n\nIllegal drugs\n\nIllegal drug use and/or trafficking (no matter what the drug) carries stiff penalties, including fines and long prison terms.\n\nPersonal identification\n\nIdentification should be carried with you at all times (for example a photocopy of the personal details page of your passport) in case requested by the local authorities. It is also advisable to make photocopies of your passport in case of theft or loss.\n\nBuying property/investment\n\nYou should be aware that the Irish Government, together with the majority of the international community, considers Israeli settlements in the oPt and in the occupied Golan Heights to be illegal under international law, and objects to their establishment. We therefore strongly advise against the purchase of property in such settlements."
