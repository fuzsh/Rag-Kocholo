On 27 July, a strike on the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights killed at least 12 civilians.\n\nWe recognise this a fast-moving situation that poses significant risks. The situation has potential to deteriorate quickly and without warning, and could result in instructions to shelter in place. This could disrupt air and road links out of the country. We strongly encourage you to check you and your dependents have the required documentation to travel at short notice.
