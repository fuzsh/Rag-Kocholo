Siam are in my alliance, so I'm careful not to attack from Siam as I know that means they'll take the land. So I do a naval invasion instead (this in itself seems stupid, I can't use the land route because of this rule). But then Siam finds it's way into the war by using one of my other allies as a backdoor to join. So then it attacks from the north and takes the land and the entire peninsular, then refuses to hand it over. I can't declare war on them or anything as they're allies of my allies and we have a non-aggression pact etc.\n\nSo what's the rule? Is there some way to stop them from taking the territory?"
