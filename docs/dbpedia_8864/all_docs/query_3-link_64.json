        "text": "DED Period:Feb. 14, 2024 – Aug. 13, 2025Federal Register Notice Citation: 89 FR 26167\n\nOn Feb. 14, 2024, President Biden issued a memorandum on DED for Palestinians to defer for 18 months the removal of certain Palestinians who were present in the United States on Feb. 14, 2024, except for those:\n\nWho voluntarily returned to the Palestinian Territories after Feb. 14, 2024;\n\nWho have not continuously resided in the United States since Feb. 14, 2024;\n\nWho are inadmissible under section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)) or deportable under section 237(a)(4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(4));\n\nWho have been convicted of any felony or 2 or more misdemeanors committed in the United States, or who meet the criteria in section 208(b)(2)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A));\n\nWho are subject to extradition;\n\nWhose presence in the United States the secretary of homeland security has determined is not in the interest of the United States or presents a danger to public safety; or\n\nWhose presence in the United States the secretary of state has reasonable grounds to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\n\nEmployment Authorization\n\nYou are eligible for employment authorization under the DED period if you:\n\nAre a Palestinian as described in the Federal Register notice cited above;\n\nWere present in the United States on Feb. 14, 2024;\n\nHave continuously resided in the United States since Feb. 14, 2024; and\n\nAre otherwise eligible for DED.\n\n*PLEASE NOTE: A Palestinian is defined as an individual of any nationality, or without nationality, who possesses any of the documents listed below, regardless of current validity or expiration. You may submit copies of any of these documents to establish your Palestinian identity:\n\nA Palestinian Authority Passport;\n\nA Palestinian Authority Identification Card;\n\nA birth certificate or birth extract verified or issued by a recognized governmental authority identifying the holder as having been born in the Palestinian territories;\n\nAn identification document issued by a third country, the United Nations, its specialized agencies and related organizations, or the International Committee of the Red Cross indicating the holder is a Palestinian; or\n\nA travel document issued by a third country, the United Nations, its specialized agencies and related organizations, or the International Committee of the Red Cross identifying the holder as a Palestinian.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the designated foreign terrorist organization Hamas took de facto administrative control of Gaza, to include issuing civil documents for that territory. The U.S. government does not accept documents issued by Hamas in Gaza unless the documents are verified by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. It is the responsibility of the applicant submitting a document issued after June 14, 2007, from any governmental agency in Gaza to obtain verification from the Palestinian Authority. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem does not assist in this process.\n\nExamples of documents that you can submit to establish presence or continuous residence include, but are not limited to, copies of any of the following:\n\nPassport;\n\nForm I-94, Arrival-Departure Record;\n\nEmployment records;\n\nRent receipts, utility bills (gas, electric, telephone, etc.) or receipts, or letters from companies showing dates when the applicant received service;\n\nPassport entries;\n\nBank books with dated transactions;\n\nSelective Service card;\n\nAttestations of your residence by churches, unions, or other organizations;\n\nAffidavits;\n\nMoney order receipts for money sent into or out of the United States;\n\nBirth certificates of children born in the United States;\n\nCorrespondence between you and others; or\n\nYour Social Security card.\n\nHow to Apply for an Employment Authorization Document\n\nIf you are covered under DED for Palestinians and you want a DED-based Employment Authorization Document (EAD) valid through Aug. 13, 2025, follow the instructions provided in the Federal Register notice to apply for an EAD.\n\nYou must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and pay the associated fee (or request a fee waiver). On Form I-765, indicate that you are covered under DED for Palestinians by putting “(a)(11)” in response to Question 27. You may request a fee waiver by submitting Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request.\n\nIf we need biometrics to produce a secure EAD, we will notify you of your appointment to appear at a USCIS Application Support Center.\n\nYou may check general processing times for Form I-765 on our processing times page.\n\nHow to Request Authorization to Travel Outside the United States\n\nDHS may provide travel authorization as a discretionary benefit of DED for eligible Palestinians. You must file for advance parole if you wish to travel outside of the United States temporarily. Advance parole authorizes U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to allow you to return to the United States during a specified period. A CBP inspector will make the final decision on your reentry. If you leave the United States without first receiving advance parole, you may no longer be eligible for DED and may not be permitted to reenter the United States.\n\nPlease also be advised that if you return to the Palestinian Territories, you will not be permitted to resume DED in the United States. The presidential memorandum providing for DED for Palestinians excludes individuals who voluntarily return to the Palestinian Territories after Feb. 14, 2024.\n\nTo request advance parole, you must file Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, and pay the associated fee. The filing instructions on Form I-131 list all the documents you must provide. You may also find information about acceptable documentation and DED eligibility on USCIS’ Deferred Enforced Departure webpage.\n\nYou may file Form I-765 and Form I-131 together or separately."
