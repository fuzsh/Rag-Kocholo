        "text": "Article\n\nThe American Home Front During World War II: Enemies on the Home Front\n\nThe attacks of December 7, 1941 that began at Pearl Harbor were not the only targets of America's enemies. By the time World War II was over, Japanese forces had attacked the US mainland and almost all American territories in the Pacific. Some of these places of the Greater United States fell under enemy occupation. [1] In the Atlantic, German U-boats targeted cargo ships. Germany, Japan, and Russia all had operatives and spies living and working across the country. They planned sabotage missions and sent sensitive information to America’s enemies. Even England had spies posted in the US. Across the Greater US, Civilian Defense volunteers learned to identify planes by sight and sound, worked to enforce blackout mandates, and took first aid courses. Elsewhere, American civilians lost their homes and their lives.[2]\n\nEnemy Attacks\n\nOnce the US formally entered the war, Germany sent U-boats into American waters. They targeted merchant cargo vessels up and down the East Coast and in the Caribbean. Their goal was to cut Europe off from American supplies, and to cut American industry off from needed materials. Within eight months, the Germans had sunk hundreds of merchant ships and disrupted the transportation of millions of tons of raw materials, fuel, and supplies. Afraid of losing vessels, the US stopped shipping food, supplies, and fuel to Puerto Rico. The US also stopped importing Puerto Rican products like rum. This hobbled the economy of the island. Afraid of losing tourist business, several coastal cities on the US mainland chose not to enforce blackout orders. The result: U-boat crews had no problem seeing and sinking cargo vessels silhouetted against the city lights. [3] They sank several ships close enough to shore that beachgoers were witnesses. In 1942, when the US began protecting cargo ships with military convoys, attacks by U-boats virtually stopped.\n\nIn the Pacific, Japanese forces repeatedly attacked (and in some cases occupied) the Greater American home front. Planes and submarines reached as far west as the Philippines and attacked Fort Stevens in Oregon and the Ellwood oil field in Goleta near Santa Barbara, California. Dutch Harbor in Alaska was bombed, and Japanese forces invaded the Alaskan islands of Attu and Kiska. The Japanese also targeted forests in Oregon. The goal was to cause panic, destroy needed lumber, and divert labor from production to fire fighting. Attacks on Hawai’i continued into March 1942, including a second attack on Pearl Harbor. Civilian targets included areas on Maui, Kaua’i, and the Big Island. [4] Elsewhere in the Pacific, Japanese vessels destroyed the settlements on Baker, Howland, and Jarvis Islands in 1941. Two of the colonists (part of the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project) were killed during the attack on Howland Island.[5] When Japan attacked the Naval station on American Samoa in January of 1942, several shells hit residential homes and businesses. [6]\n\nIn 1941 and 1942, Wake Island, Guam, the Philippines, and parts of Alaska were captured by Japanese forces. Civilians on Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines who survived the conquering battles were subject to terrible conditions under Japanese occupation. This included forced labor, eviction from their homes, family separation, starvation, imprisonment, torture, and execution. Homes, businesses, and infrastructure were damaged and destroyed.[7] Additional damage and death happened as American forces fought to retake these territories.[8]\n\nAnd then there were the balloons. Late in the war, from November 1944 to April 1945 Japan launched over 9,000 balloons called Fu-Go. They carried anti-personnel and fire bombs into the recently-discovered Pacific jet stream. Their goal was to reach North America and cause damage. [9] About 300 of the balloons made the trip into the Greater United States, reaching as far east as Michigan. This was the first intercontinental weapon in modern times. Fu-Go balloons resulted in forest fires and temporarily cut power to the Manhattan Project. One also caused the death of six Americans in Oregon when they found it during a picnic outing. [10]\n\nCovert Operatives\n\nGermany, Japan, Russia, and Britain all had spies working across the Greater United States leading up to and during World War II. An expanded network of spies in Latin America included those for Spain, who, though technically neutral, sided with Germany.[11]\n\nGerman U-boats brought at least 10 German operatives to America. In June 1942, submarines landed four spies each on beaches in New York and Florida. Armed with money and explosives, their job was to sabotage military production and cause fear. In 1944, U-boats landed two spies on a beach in Maine. The operatives had made their way to New York City and Chicago to carry out their plans by the time the FBI captured them. Some occupants of German U-Boats captured or killed were also probably spies on their way to being deployed. [12]\n\nNot all German spies arrived by submarine. Many had been living and working in the United States for years and several were naturalized citizens. Some were working aboard the SS America as it traversed the Panama Canal Zone, collecting information and recruiting accomplices. The FBI broke up at least four German spy rings between 1938 and 1942, arresting and charging 51 spies (men and women). Some were recruited to work for the US as double agents.[13]\n\nSpies for Japan, some of whom were American citizens, included several in Hawai’i, the Philippines, and a doll seller in New York City. Even early on during the buildup to World War II, Japanese operatives were working in the US, including former Navy Yeoman First Class Harry T. Thompson and former Navy Lieutenant Commander John S. Farnsworth. Much closer to the attack on Pearl Harbor, Takeo Yoshikawa was using his cover at Japan’s foreign ministry on Oahu to report on naval deployments, arrivals, and departures. He worked with a small team of trusted drivers and with the knowledge of his superiors at the foreign ministry. One of his chosen observation points was at the Pan American Clipper landing at Pearl City. Yoshikawa also worked with a Nazi spy stationed in Hawai’i. Authorities arrested and convicted the German spy. Yoshikawa was well on his way to Japan as part of a diplomatic exchange before authorities discovered his role.\n\nNot all those spying for Japan were of Japanese ancestry. Authorities charged at least 18 white people and convicted at least 10 of them. While no person of Japanese ancestry living in the US was convicted of any serious act of espionage or sabotage during World War II, 18 white people were convicted as Japanese operatives. Among those 10 was Velvalee Dickinson. By coding ship and troop movements as repairs to dolls in a series of letters, she conveyed critical information to the Japanese and contacts in Argentina.[14]\n\nBefore the United States entered World War II, Russia and Germany had been uneasy allies. But in June 1941, Germany invaded Russia.[15] With a common enemy, Russia became part of the Allied forces. Even so, several Russian spies were operating in the US during World War II, including as many as five spy rings.[16] Many operatives were serving in the US military or working for the federal government, including as part of the Manhattan Project and those developing jet fighters and other military technology. Among them were Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Although their guilt remains contested, they were executed at Sing Sing prison in New York in 1953 for sharing atomic secrets with the Russians. Morris and Lona Cohen, who got full plans of the atomic bomb to the Russians 12 days before the Trinity Test, escaped the US before capture. They were eventually arrested in Britain, but spent the rest of their lives in Russia as part of a prisoner exchange.[17]\n\nBritish intelligence operatives, unlike the others, were here with the grudging blessing of the US government. They also worked behind the government’s back to encourage the US to enter the war. Through the British intelligence outpost in New York City, Winston Churchill worked to convince the United States to enter the war. At the same time, FBI agents were receiving training in espionage and counter-espionage from the British.[18]\n\nAttacks on the Greater United States home front and the presence of German, Japanese, and Russian spies led to reactions fueled by fear and national security. This article was written by Megan E. Springate, Assistant Research Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Maryland, for the NPS Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.\n\n[1] These were: Alaska Territory; American Samoa; Baker Island; Canton Island; the Commonwealth of the Philippines; Guam; Hawai’i Territory; Howland Island; Jarvis Island; Johnston Atoll; Midway Atoll; Palmyra Atoll; Wake Island. Not attacked: Canton Island, Enderbury Island, and the Panama Canal Zone.\n\n[2] To be designated a V-Home (a program of the Office of Civilian Defense) certain criteria needed to be met. Homes that observed blackouts, did not have excess flammables, had protective equipment and a “refuge room” earned the right to display a V-Home sticker. They were also encouraged to buy war bonds, participate in material drives, and not spread rumors.\n\n[3] Domenech Abreu 2021; Gannon 1990: 186, 345; Kennedy 1999: 566.\n\n[4] Barnett 2020/2021; Graff 2021; Young 2019. The Japanese targeted Battery Russell, part of Fort Stevens. There was little damage to the Fort as most shells hit a nearby baseball field. Fort Stevens was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 22, 1971. Heightened nerves after the Japanese attacks in California led to what is now known as “the Battle of Los Angeles.” What was likely a weather balloon triggered a flood of anti-aircraft fire from Los Angeles and elsewhere. Shells damaged buildings and cars in LA, and five people died in car crashes or from heart attacks. The Pacific Rim Peace Memorial dedicated to those at Fort Stevens and those aboard the Japanese submarine was installed near Battery Russell in 1992. It reads, in part: “Near this place on the night of June 21, 1942, they faced each other when the Japanese submarine shelled Fort Stevens, making it the first foreign attack on a continental military installation since the War of 1812. May peace between our nations be everlasting.”\n\n[5] Congress.gov 2011; Hirsh n.d.; Horner 2013: 73-75; Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge 2007: 3-16 to 3-17. The two colonists killed by Japanese attacks were Joseph Keliʻihananui and Richard \"Dickey\" Whaley. The US military finally picked up the surviving colonists in February 1942. They also destroyed any remaining buildings and facilities to keep them from being taken by the enemy.\n\n[6] National Park Service 2020.\n\n[7] In Manila, destruction included 70% of the utilities; 75% of the factories; 100% of the business district, and 80% of the residential district (Tharoor 2015).\n\n[8] Palomo and Aguon 2023; Tharoor 2015.\n\n[9] Rizzo 2013.\n\n[10] Mikesh 1973: 69-78. The Mitchell Recreation Area, including a memorial to the six killed by the exploding Fu-Go, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 20, 2003.\n\n[11] Spyscape n.d.\n\n[12] Commander Eastern Sea Frontier 1942, 1944; Cox, S. 2017; Federal Bureau of Investigation n.d. d; German Navy 1942; Holzwarth 2019; Kellert 2012; Rouse 1982. A Coast Guardsman from the Amagansett U.S. Life-Saving and Coast Guard Station on Long Island (listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 27, 2018) reported the arriving German spies. One of the spies, George Dasch, traveled to DC to turn himself in and identify the other spies. While in DC he stayed at the Mayflower Hotel (listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 14, 1983). The FBI arrested one of the other spies while he was staying at the Sheridan Plaza Hotel in Chicago (listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 21, 1980). After a secret trial at the Department of Justice building in DC (part of the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site), President Roosevelt sentenced six of the eight to death and the other two to long prison terms. The executions took place at the DC jail. A memorial to them, placed by the National Socialist White People’s Party (formerly known as the American Nazi Party), was found in the Blue Plains area of DC. Officials removed it in 2010 (Cox, J. 2017).\n\nTargets of the landed spies included Hell Gate Bridge in New York City; the power grid at Niagara Falls; the railroad infrastructure at Altoona, PA; and unspecified locks along the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.\n\nTargets Represented in the Historic American Engineering Record\n\nHell Gate Bridge, New York City\n\nPennsylvania Railroad, Altoona Works, Altoona, Pennsylvania\n\nMississippi River locks:\n\nLock and Dam No. 1 (Ford Dam), Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota\n\nLock and Dam No. 4, near Alma, Wisconsin\n\nLock and Dam No. 5, near Minnesota City, Minnesota\n\nLock and Dam No. 5A, near Fountain City, Wisconsin\n\nLock and Dam No. 6, near Trempealeau, Wisconsin\n\nLock and Dam No. 7, near La Crescent, Minnesota\n\nLock and Dam No. 8, near Genoa, Wisconsin\n\nLock and Dam No. 9, near Lynxville, Wisconsin\n\nLock and Dam No. 10, Guttenberg, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 11, Dubuque, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 12, Bellevue, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 13, near Fulton, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 14, near LeClaire, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 15, Rock Island, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 16, near Muscatine, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 17, near New Boston, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 18, near Gladstone, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 19, near Keokuk, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 20, near Canton, Missouri\n\nLock and Dam No. 21, near Quincy, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 22, near Saverton, Missouri\n\nLock and Dam No. 24, near Clarksville, Missouri (see also Lock & Dam Nos. 24-27 HAER)\n\nLock and Dam No. 25, near Winfield, Missouri (see also Lock & Dam Nos. 24-27 HAER)\n\nLock and Dam No. 26 (demolished 1990), near Alton, Illinois\n\nChain of Rocks Locks and Dam (Lock and Dam No. 27), near St. Louis, Missouri (see also Lock & Dam Nos. 24-27 HAER)\n\nMelvin Price Locks and Dam, near Alton, Illinois\n\nOhio River Locks\n\nEmsworth Locks and Dams, Emsworth, Pennsylvania (see also Emsworth Locks and Dams at Ohio River Mile Markers 6.2 and 6.81 and Emsworth Locks and Dams, Back Channel Dam)\n\nGallipolis Locks & Dam, Gallipolis, West Virginia\n\nOhio River Lock and Dam 52, Brookport, Illinois\n\nOhio River Lock and Dam 53 (demolished in 2020), Olmsted, Illinois\n\nOhio Slack Water Dams, Lock & Dam No. 4, Ambridge, Pennsylvania\n\nTargets Represented in the National Register of Historic Places\n\nNiagara Falls power grid: The headquarters of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp., who operated the power grid for much of the northeast, including the generating facilities at Niagara Falls, was located in Syracuse, NY (listed June 14, 2010)\n\nMississippi River locks (unless noted, all listed as part of the Multiple Property Nomination “Upper Mississippi River 9-Food Navigation Project, 1931-1948,” March 10, 2004):\n\nLock and Dam No. 11 Historic District, Dubuque, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 12 Historic District, Bellevue, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 13 Historic District, Fulton, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 14 Historic District, near LeClaire, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 15 Historic District, Rock Island, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 16 Historic District, near Muscatine, Iowa\n\nLock and Dam No. 17 Historic District, near New Boston, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 18 Historic District, near Gladstone, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 19 Historic District, near Keokuk, Iowa (see also an individual listing for Keokuk Lock and Dam, October 19, 1978)\n\nLock and Dam No. 20 Historic District, near Canton, Missouri\n\nLock and Dam No. 21 Historic District, near Quincy, Illinois\n\nLock and Dam No. 22 Historic District, near Saverton, Missouri\n\nLock and Dam No. 24 Historic District, near Clarksville, Missouri\n\nLock and Dam No. 25 Historic District, near Winfield, Missouri\n\nSt. Anthony Falls Historic District, Minneapolis, Minnesota (listed March 11, 1971)\n\n[13] These were the Duquesne Spy Ring, the Ludwig Spy Ring (also known as the Joe K. Spy Ring), the Rumrich Spy Ring, and the Vonsiatsky Spy Ring. Two members of the Duquesne Spy Ring posed as crew on the SS America in the Panama Canal Zone. Rene Froehlich, part of the Ludwig Spy Ring, was a US Army private stationed at Fort Jay on Governors Island, New York.
