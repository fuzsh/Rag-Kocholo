        "text": "The creation of the League of Nations marked a new era of multilateral cooperation. The Covenant bound its Member States to try to settle their disputes peacefully. By joining the League, Member States also renounced secret diplomacy, committed to reduce their armaments, and agreed to comply with international law. Each state pledged to respect the territorial integrity and political independence of all members of the League. By establishing a bond of solidarity between Member States, the League is considered the first attempt to build a system of collective security. This principle relied on a simple idea: an aggressor against any Member State should be considered an aggressor against all the other Member States.\n\nThe League of Nations was also in charge of supervising the Mandate system. The “mandated territories” were former German colonies and Ottoman territories placed under what the Covenant called the “tutelage” of mandatory powers until they could become independent states.\n\nAlthough the Covenant focused on conflict prevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes, some articles referred to the role of the League in promoting international cooperation in areas such as health, drug trafficking, transit, freedom of communications, and human trafficking. The efforts in these fields became increasingly important over the years and, in some cases, paved the way for the creation of United Nations entities, such as Specialized Agencies and UN Funds and Programmes."
