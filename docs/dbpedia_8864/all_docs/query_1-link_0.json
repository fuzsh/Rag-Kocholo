        "text": "Military rule by Allied forces during World War II\n\nThe Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (originally abbreviated AMGOT, later AMG) was the form of military rule administered by Allied forces during and after World War II within European territories they occupied.[1] The first instance of this inter-Allied model of government of occupied territory was manifested in Sicily after Operation Husky in August 1943.[2]\n\nNotable AMGOT\n\n[edit]\n\nThis form of controlled government was implemented in the states of Germany, Italy,[3] Austria and Japan, amongst others.\n\nA franchise stamp issued by the Allied Military Government (AMG) in 1948 to exempt travellers from fees when crossing borders.[4]\n\nThree revenue stamps of the AMG from 1950 and 1951.\n\nOpposition of France\n\n[edit]\n\nUS President Franklin Roosevelt insisted that an AMGOT should be implemented in France, but this was opposed by both Henry Stimson (US Secretary of War) and John J. McCloy (US Under-Secretary for War), as well as Allied Europe Supreme Commander, General Dwight Eisenhower, who had been strongly opposed to the imposition of AMGOT in North Africa. Eisenhower, unlike Roosevelt, wanted to cooperate with Charles de Gaulle; he secured a last-minute promise from Roosevelt on the eve of D-Day that the Allied officers would not act as military governors and would instead cooperate with the local authorities as the Allied forces liberated French territory.[citation needed] De Gaulle would, however, later claim in his memoirs that he blocked AMGOT.[5]\n\nThe AMGOT would have been implemented in France after its liberation if not for the Free French establishing control of the country per the Provisional Government of the French Republic in the name of the Free French Forces and the united French Resistance (FFI) following the liberation of Paris by the French themselves instead of the Allies, in August 1944.[6]\n\nGermany\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Allied Control Council\n\nGermany's control was notably divided amongst the powers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\n\nItaly\n\n[edit]\n\nSicily\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Operation Husky, with the Allied Invasion of Sicily on July 10, 1943, the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT) was established with Staff Officer Francis Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell and Civil Affairs officer colonel Charles Poletti.\n\nInterviewed by the News Chronicle, Rennell was asked about the controversial decision to retain the services of the Carabinieri and other police and officials who had worked for the Fascist regime, and answered \"They are doing an excellent job and deserve to be trusted. Their oath had been to the King, not to Mussolini. (...) We do not seek the support of any political group, neither anti-Fascists nor any others. For the time being, all political gatherings are forbidden in Sicily. We are a military administration, we have no mandate to make any political or social reforms\".\n\nIn February 1944 the AMGOT handed over the administration to the Badoglio Cabinet. It continued to operate as \"Allied Military Government\" in the occupied Italian territories until the end of the war.\n\nFree Territory of Trieste\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Allied Military Government of the Free Territory of Trieste was a follow-on from the military government of occupied Italy. The Free Territory of Trieste was created by the 16th UNSC Resolution adopted at the 91st meeting by 10 votes to none, with 1 abstention (Australia), 10 January 1947, and established by the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 10 February 1947, then entered in force from 15 September 1947. The instrument for the provisional regime of the Free Territory of Trieste provides that the allied and associated military forces govern the territory. The historical situation saw the division into two administration areas called Zone A, including the capital Trieste and the Free Port of Trieste (ports areas within the boundaries delineated in 1939) and Zone B comprising the area of the cities of Koper Izola, Umago, Buje and Cittanova. Zone A was assigned to the Anglo-Americans and Zone B to the Yugoslavs. Military governments ended when in November 1954 under the provisions of the London Memorandum, among the United States, United Kingdom, Italy and Yugoslavia, to become a civil administration. Zone A was assigned to Italy (not yet a member of the UNO) and Zone B was assigned to Yugoslavia.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAllied Commission\n\nA Bell for Adano is a 1944 novel by John Hersey centered on the AMGOT control of the fictional Italian village of Adano based on the real-life village of Licata, Italy.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nTrieste Revenue stamps listed in Italy Revenues\" by J.Barefoot Ltd, York, 2013, ISBN 0-906845-73-4."
