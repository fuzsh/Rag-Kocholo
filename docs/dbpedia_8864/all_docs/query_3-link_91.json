        "text": "Gaza crisis: Over 37,000 people have been killed in this catastrophic humanitarian emergency\n\nThe ongoing conflict and situation in Gaza is catastrophic. Famine is looming, clean water is scarce, and the healthcare system has all but collapsed. Most people have fled from their homes, but there is nowhere safe left to go.\n\nWe are witnessing unacceptable and relentless human suffering and the sheer scale of the response and recovery effort needed will require funding for many years to come.\n\nAid alone will not solve this crisis, but it will save lives. People urgently need clean water, food, and medical care. Red Cross and Red Crescent teams have already helped three quarters of the population, working tirelessly to alleviate suffering wherever they can. But we canâ€™t continue this life-saving work without you.\n\nThe best way to help is by donating to our Gaza Crisis Appeal now.\n\nWhat is the Red Cross and Red Crescent doing to help people in Gaza?\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has:\n\nreached 1.8 million people with food, water, and other basic essentials\n\nsupported over 345,000 people with health services\n\nprovided psychosocial support to 94,000 people\n\nreached almost 22,000 people with emergency medical services\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has:\n\nopened a 60-bed field hospital in Rafah, with capacity to provide medical care for 200 people a day, including emergency surgical, obstetric, maternal, and paediatric care\n\nprovided one cooked meal a day to 25,000 vulnerable people in Gaza, as well as ready-to-eat food parcels to 10,000 people and high nutritional food bars to almost 200,000 people\n\nprovided essential items to more than 1 million internally displaced people in Gaza and helped more than 1 million people access clean water\n\nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent response will continue across the wider region and we will work closely with the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Magen David Adom in Israel, the ICRC and other National Societies to support all communities affected by this conflict.\n\nThe plight of the hostages also remains a priority of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and we continue to reiterate what the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said clearly since the outset of this crisis: those taken hostage must be released unconditionally and without delay.\n\nHow you can help people in Gaza\n\nIf you are in the UK, the best and quickest way to help support people in Gaza is to donate to this appeal. These donations enable us to respond quickly and help wherever the need is greatest.\n\nDonate to the Gaza Crisis Appeal\n\nWhere will my money go?\n\nThe appeal name reflects where the humanitarian needs are currently the greatest, but we are aware that this conflict has had, and will continue to have, repercussions across the region, and our support may be required in other areas. This is common for many of our appeals: for example, we use donations from our Ukraine and Syria Crisis appeals to support all those affected, including in the countries themselves, as well as the surrounding areas.\n\nThe importance of neutrality and impartiality"
