        "text": "Steve Kidd's Review Pages\n\nFilms\n\n10 Cloverfield Lane\n\n2016 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 17 January 2016\n\nStarring: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, John Gallagher, Jr., Bradley Cooper\n\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\n\nI've seen plenty worse sci-fi horror movies. This was quite enjoyable to sit through, even though, in retrospect it was so full of holes, but at least they didn't spoil a great performance from John Goodman in an interesting situation. A real plus for this film is you never knew quite which way it was going to go. (Until the end when she turned right)\n\n12 Angry Men ‡B\n\n1957 Mark: 10.321\n\nWatched: Fri 2 October 2015\n\nStarring: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, George Voskovec, Robert Webber\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nThis is how you make a film. It doesn't even matter if you know what happens (this was at least my third time), it is spellbinding throughout, entertaining, engrossing, endearing. I read the budget was $340,000!!!! Even at today's prices that is still half the cost of any film at the multiplex. How each of the characters fill their discreet niches to such effect is a thing to behold. 90 minutes in one room. I just love it.\n\n12 Years A Slave ‡O\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 7 January 2014\n\nStarring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ashley Dyke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\nNow then! Odds on for best film Oscar, but for me it is many lengths behind several films I have seen at the latter part of 2013. Don't get me wrong, it is quite awesome, but as a message film it fails. White folk in the Antebellum South were just as good, bad or usually indifferent as the 10,000 people closest to you now, at this moment in time. This film is an excuse for 95% y'all to get real righteous and say \"My goodness, how bad were those people\", but until you realise that you/we are just the same the message is pointless. Yeah, and like Jack Tarr could just stab a nigger on the boat. That could never of happened without the guy being hauled over the coals by the slave owner.\n\nSpoiler Alert. The film is about a bloke who was a slave for 12 years.\n\nP.S. Watched the BAFTA awards and Steve McQueen, the director, was giving his acceptance speech after receiving the Best Film award. He delivered this fine point:\n\nRight now there are twenty one million people in slavery as we sp... as we sit here. Twenty-one million people. I just hope that a hundred and fifty years from now our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film\n\nMy point is it will. And the same fuckers will be wringing their hands and voting for it\n\n2 Guns\n\n2012 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Sat 5 December 2015\n\nStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Denzel Washington, Paula Patton, Bill Paxton, James Marsden, Fred Ward, Edward James Olmos\n\nDirector: Baltasar Kormákur\n\nA proper dumb-ass buddy movie (I mean dumb-ass predictable, not Dumber and Dumber protagonists) Wahlberg and Washington are super hard and quite funny, the plot is reasonably occupying, the cinematography and music are good, and if it is action you seek, this ticks that box as well. It is like a Stars on 45 of cinematic clichés, but you know what? it is better for it. If you like this type of film, this is an entertaining example which takes you two hours closer to your grave without you worrying about it. Some very Breaking Bad aspects.\n\n22 Jump Street\n\n2014 Mark: 9\n\nWatched: Fri 20 June 2014\n\nStarring: Jonah Hill, Ice Cube, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare\n\nDirector: Phil Lord, Christopher Miller\n\nAbsolutely cracking comedy. I am beginning to understand why I mark these funny films so highly. It is because in my life I actually read about, study and am generally very closely aligned to so much depression that I do not need a film to illustrate it to me. These films just highlight absurdities of humanity which really takes a load off. I didn't expect it but genuine humour saturates this film, and as for the end credits! After Bad Neighbour and Delivery Man I am becoming a true fan of modern American screwball comedy. Ice Cube is perfect.\n\n3 Days To Kill\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Tue 24 June 2014\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner, Amber Heard\n\nDirector: McG\n\nThis is a rare film in that it lurches between eminently watchable and then dire from scene to scene, from frame to frame. On the positive side is Kevin Costner's quasi comedic performance a reasonable story (I'm struggling now) and ... The negatives including the worst sound track ever ( I Love It, I Want To Make It With you ) and unbelievable threads like his bitchy little daughter learning to ride a bike in the worst place possible and a stupid stupid ubercool manipulative spy-master. Because she is a tart in high heels. And why didn't the Christmas present say (SPOILER ALERT) \"there was never anything wrong with you, you dick\". Whatever, I gave it the mark, I enjoyed it, but if every film was this moderate I wouldn't enjoy Cineworld enough to justify the ticket\n\n3:10 To Yuma\n\n2007 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Christian Bale\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nI reckon you could put those two in a film and it'd always work. Usual story, quiet farmer gets a bad draw, finds redemption.\n\n300; Rise Of An Empire\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 10 March 2014\n\nStarring: Sullivan Stapleton, Lena Hedey, Eva Green\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nSurprise! I thought this was going to be garbage (I never really liked the first one) but did I like this? Hell yeah! I know ships don't come over the top of hills of water like the cavalry, I know that Persian bitch-queens don't wear fishnets and Goth make up. I understand it was entirely green screen. I know that the queen of Sparta was the alternate universe Cersei Lannister. The film would have lasted just 30 minutes if they didn't put it in super slo-mo every time there was some blood flying through the air (which was practically the whole movie). Xerxes must have got gay virus and, and, and... everything. But it was ENJOYABLE. I actually got quite invested in a few of the lead characters.\n\n4 Play\n\n2010 Mark: 3\n\nWatched: Wed 9 December 2015\n\nDirector: Frank Rajah Arase\n\nI may have had a dud copy of this, but I actually don't think it was. There was a laugh track. It was definitely a laugh track. It was so weird in that it was like a joke film where the laugh track is meant to be ironic, but it just spoilt what might have been something watchable. So much for Nollywood (the film industry of Ghana and Nigeria. I thought it was American when I started watching)\n\n47 Ronin\n\n2013 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Tue 7 January 2014\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves\n\nDirector: Carl Rinsch\n\n10% on Rotten Tomatoes??? What do these jerks know about films? This was a thoroughly good movie. If you don't like fight sequences and mystic intervention and \"Magic Wand  Make my monster grow\" you won't like this, but why would you even want to consider watching it if you are such a pussy?\n\n48 Hrs.\n\n1982 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Thu 19 November 2015\n\nStarring: Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte, James Remar, David Patrick Kelly, Denise Crosby\n\nDirector: Walter Hill\n\nThe first film I ever taped on VHS, consequently my views are totally biased, imbued with the affection of lost love and better days, it is not colour saturated 4:3; it is high Def 4d IMAX!\n\nWhadya know? I watched it yesterday and it is STILL a great film, that stands up to the thousand sequels and the few predecessors that see two disparate individuals reluctantly thrown together, yet find that their diverse talents eventually....\n\nI reckon that perhaps .001% of the dialogue I have used over the last 30 years comes from this film.\n\nY'all be cool, right on\n\nAnother 48 Hours\n\n1990 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 25 November 2015\n\nStarring: Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte\n\nDirector: Walter Hill\n\nThere have been worse sequels. I thought that Working Girl was the last hurrah for the 1980's but I think this is now the holder of that title. The concept is totally non-original but the deliver and humour fair, and, of course, the characters of Hammond and Kates are as loveable as ever. If you liked the first, you will like this.\n\n5 Shells\n\n2012 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Wed 9 December 2015\n\nStarring: Kelsey Hutton, Eve Kozikowski\n\nDirector: Paul S. Myers\n\nWhat a weird hypnotic quality this film had about it. I guess I must have enjoyed it. I would like to know the budget (very low) as the film itself was excellent in a visual sense, and the cast very watchable. I wonder if the director said \"We want Hunger Games Jennifer Lawrence here\" (except it was before the Hunger Games )?\n\n51st State\n\n2001 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 14 January 2013\n\nStarring: Samuel L Jackson, Robert Carlyle, Emily Mortimer, Ricky Tomlinson, Sean Pertwee, Rhys Ifans, Meat Loaf\n\nDirector: Ronny Yu\n\nSolid, amusing film set in Liverpool!\n\n'71\n\n2014 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Mon 20 October 2014\n\nStarring: Jack O'Connell, Sean Harris, David Wilmot, Richard Dormer\n\nDirector: Yann Demange\n\nJack O'Connell has the highest average this year. This is dark, incredibly tense, frustrating (It is meant to be) straight out of the school of Red Riding It is a refreshing take on the troubles which shows incredible bravery and kindness on all sides (bar the RUC), but the incredible malaise of allowing bad men to do bad things. If I was judging on other factors bar personal enjoyment this would score very highly. I don't think O'Connell could ever survive another film!\n\n8mm\n\n1999 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 2 July 2016\n\nStarring: Nicolas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini, Peter Stormare, Anthony Heald\n\nDirector: Joel Schumacher\n\nReasonable Cage fodder, nothing much wrong with this film and a beer, though I'm not sure if I learned anything. Gandolfini and Stomare!! All star cast!! Typical 6 region film which is nice to watch with somebody, but I would probably be distracted on my own\n\nThe Accountant\n\n2016 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Wed 9 November 2016\n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Anna Kendrick, J. K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor, John Lithgow, Cynthia Addai-Robinson (NOT Zoe Saldana!)\n\nDirector: Gavin O'Connor\n\nKnockout stuff, Ben Affleck is Batman in a suit with aspergers, and his perfectly timed delivery of sociability (or lack thereof), machismo and cognitive powers are, despite being eyebrow cockingly surprising, entirely seductive in the context of his universe. I WANT A SEQUEL - I like this guy. The film allowed me to think I was spotting detail that made me feel good, other members of the cast were intriguing and despite a little bit too much of the noble female sleuth the whole thing was a well entertaining slice of nuttyness which combined great action with a deal of thoughtful storytelling. ****\n\nPS \"Going to the Bens\" is now my synonym for going to the cinema (i.e. 'the flicks', i.e. 'Ben Aflecks')\n\nAdventures in Babysitting\n\n1987 Mark: 2\n\nWatched: Mon 7 November 2016\n\nStarring: Elisabeth Shue\n\nDirector: Chris Columbus\n\nWhy didn't I watch this all the way through. When a film begins with mutton dressed as lamb lip-synching in her own zany/cookie/Friends/80s way bouncing on her bed in a wacky bedroom I think of Bridget Jones 3 and wanna move on quickly. Watched 1 minute.\n\nThe African Queen\n\n1951 Mark: 9\n\nWatched: Tue 13 September 2016\n\nStarring: Humphrey Bogart ‡O, Katharine Hepburn, Robert Morley\n\nDirector: John Huston\n\nVery dated. Very very good. C.S. Forester could be my favourite author, his intuition for chaos theory, without being overtly articulated resonates with my way of thinking; small actions have massive consequences. It's a buddy movie, a quest, conducted almost entirely by two protagonists who milk the trope to it's extreme, but in an obvious, gentle way, like, things were much 'nicer' back then. Big plus is redemption for the bad guys (it's small, but nevertheless a beautiful nod to humanity), it is a massive rip into religion, and given the constraints of the Motion Picture Production Code (aka Hays code), it deals with the sex as well as it can, almost poking a finger at the ridiculousness of it all. I'm beginning to think I enjoyed it even more than I enjoyed it. Sounds stupid, I know, but there is a lot of the Ealing comedy about this! I am super conflicted about what I think is too low a mark I have designated.\n\nAfter Earth\n\n2013 Mark: 6.3\n\nWatched: Fri 18 December 2015\n\nStarring: Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Sophie Okonedo\n\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\n\nA trip into self-indulgence, I found the unintentional nuttiness, just palatable enough to watch it, Jaden Smith and his Dad never quite sucked 100% (they got close occasionally), the film falls squarely into the Shaymalalalalan timeline, and, well, that's it!\n\nAgainst The Dark\n\n2009 Mark: 2.5\n\nWatched: Wed 7 October 2015\n\nStarring: Steven Segal\n\nDirector: Richard Krudo\n\nIt is fascinating to imagine how many people have actually watched this all the way through, a straight to video, nothing new, poorly filmed, unimaginative b movie that is slotted on channel forty something at time x at night. I recorded it just for the Steven Segal factor, but he is hardly in it, I sometimes wonder if the shadowy figure striding through the poorly lit alleys with a cool leather trench coat and a samurai sword is his stunt double. Jake and I imagined a hundred or so people for this particular screening, I mean, why would you even want to stay awake? As I watch more films critically at least I am turning them off a little quicker, I think this lasted perhaps forty minutes. Jeezus, films are free nowadays, just watch Zombieland instead.\n\nThe Age of Adeline\n\n2015 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 22 May 2015\n\nStarring: Blake Lively, Michiel Huisman, Kathy Baker, Amanda Crew, Harrison Ford, Ellen Burstyn\n\nDirector: Lee Toland Krieger\n\nSitting writing about this and I want to mark it down, nevertheless I'll leave it at the 7 I gave it three quarters of the way through, in that it got much more interesting once Harrison Ford appeared on the screen half way through. It kept me awake, and the science was absolutely terrible. The best bit was Young Indiana Jones doing a great job of the accent. Surely did not like this more than The Lego Movie ?\n\nAge Of Heroes\n\n2011 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 27 June 2014\n\nStarring: Danny Dyer, Sean Bean\n\nDirector: Adrian Vitoria\n\nWell I liked this. The paella was good, the wine more than adequate and I like Danny Dyer more than Mark Kermode, who seems to put a greater emphasis on packaging than content. To try and capture the soul of this film without giving spoilers away, it is just another heist movie, but without the comedy and set in World War II. If you like Sean Bean, you will like this film, if you don't well going and watch Walking on bleedin' Sunshine you vacuous moron. I actually reckon this was just the right film to watch at the time!\n\nPS: This is actually based around the true story of the formation of Ian Fleming's 30th Commando regiment!\n\nAir Force One\n\n1997 Mark: 7.6\n\nWatched: Sat 4 March 2017\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel Matthews, Paul Guilfoyle, William H. Macy, Dean Stockwell\n\nDirector: Wolfgang Petersen\n\nLoveable nonsense. Today I said \"I want something that I don't have to stay sober for\" and Jake said \"I think you may be happy\", and he was right.\n\nAlice Through The Looking Glass\n\n2016 Mark: 7.1\n\nWatched: Sat 28 May 2016\n\nStarring: Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Rhys Ifans, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall\n\nDirector: James Bobin\n\nOne where I got put off by the pre-publicity. I was sat thinking \"wow I'm impressed\" at several junctures of this film, and I hope it gets recognised in some of the technical categories. I bought into the Mia Wasikowska Alice big time, it took 60 seconds but really, forget the billing order, she is the absolute star of this. Anybody could have done the other parts (which were done well but relied almost entirely on CGI and make-up. That's not to diss 'em, that is just a statement of probable fact. The story might have been more understandable with a hefty dose of acid, but having said that, I 'got it' and loved the way I did not recognise an iota of the narrative. Kudos for a better take on the hundred year old children's novel than Pan\n\nPrometheus\n\n2012 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Wed 13 July 2016\n\nStarring: Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green, and Charlize Theron\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nThis is kind of the same as its precursors, except it seems to have been done a hell of a lot better. It suffers from some of the logical inconsistencies of the rest of the franchise, but perhaps not quite to the same degree\n\nAlien\n\n1979 Mark: 5.5\n\nWatched: Thu 14 July 2016\n\nStarring: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nI really can't come to terms with a universe where a multi billion dollar corporation sends a ship into space where the crew don't even know each other until they wake up, where a crew would even sign up for such a venture, and where would of them would odds on either die or put the entire human race in the greatest danger to save the ship's cat.\n\nAliens\n\n1982 Mark: 5.1\n\nWatched: Fri 15 July 2016\n\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, Bill Paxton\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nI'm sorry Jake, I'm wasting my time watching the rest of this. More of the same stupid universe where the ships have been installed with Saturday Night Fever disco strobes, where parents take their kids to explore UFOs and don't even tell their home base they are doing it, where there is a female marine who flies the flag for feminism 'cos she's super ard, yet happens to wear a vest instead of combat gear and sunglasses in a world that is like Muckle Flugga in November the stupid cow, and where the major says \"nah, we can't possibly have another shark attack\". The thing is, with horror films, they overly depend on people's stupidity, and the cast of these films have it in spades.\n\nAlien 3\n\n1992 Mark: 4\n\nWatched: Sun 17 July 2016\n\nStarring: Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dance\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nSome people love the Alien franchise. Not me. The only thing I think I remember is I quit whilst I was only marginally behind.\n\nAll About Eve ‡O\n\n1950 Mark: 5\n\nWatched: Wed 1 January 2014\n\nStarring: Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Barbara Bates, Gary Merrill, Thelma Ritter, Marilyn Monroe\n\nDirector: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nNever did like Bette Davis, this film takes a long time to tell a short story\n\nAll The King's Men ‡O\n\n1949 Mark: 7\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Broderick Crawford\n\nDirector: Robert Rossen\n\nThis film discusses a theme that is close to my heart; politics, and gives a fairly compelling reflection upon it and human nature in general\n\nAlmost Famous\n\n2000 Mark: 8\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Frances McDormand, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Noah Taylor, Zooey Deschanel, Philip Seymour Hoffman\n\nDirector: Cameron Crowe\n\nI know I have watched this a couple of times, know that Ella loved it, I remember I enjoyed it even more the second time round. This might not be an accurate review (it is not done contemporaneously), but it is in because of the Boat That Rocked comparison\n\nAlpha Dog\n\n2006 Mark: 6.9\n\nWatched: Wed 12 October 2016\n\nStarring: Emile Hirsch, Justin Timberlake, Ben Foster, Shawn Hatosy, Anton Yelchin, Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, Harry Dean Stanton, Sharon Stone, Bruce Willis\n\nDirector: Nick Cassavetes\n\nBased upon a true story, this seems a somewhat fanciful account of West Coast youth culture at the turn of the millennium. Is this really how kids lived in California? It seems to glamorise most of what must have essentially varied between mostly seedily mundane and only occasionally perhaps exciting and I am left with the inescapable feeling that this is a gratuitous entertainment first, before it is a documentary - but hell, that's what storytellers do. Now, having got my jealousy of 20 year olds driving round in 4x4 with guns in a never ending cycle of swimming pools and incredibly hot chicks out of the way there are some notable positives, including Justin Timberlake and especially Anton Yelchin. Look, I know, one can't be helped by colouring opinion with sympathy, and given that Yelchin has delivered on the first three of the Star Trek reboots and then died in at the age of 27 he certainly has mine, but this was a lovely empathic performance and the one feel good aspect of what was wall to wall sordidness. Glad I watched it.\n\nAlpha Girls\n\n2013 Mark: ?4\n\nWatched: Tue 29 November 2016\n\nStarring: Falon Joslyn, Nikki Bell, Ron Jeremy, Schoolly D\n\nDirectors: Tony Trov, Johnny Zito\n\nFive minute forget it. Dare I say from the opening card it looks naff?\n\nAmadeus ‡O\n\n1984 Mark: 8\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Tom Hulse, F Murray Abraham\n\nDirector: Milo Forman\n\nAh.. From the opening the tone is set of great music, and the ultimate Tom and Jerry story with F Murray Abraham getting in the top 20 baddies list and Tom Hulse portraying the manic genius on the button\n\nThe Amazing Spiderman 2\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 28 May 2014\n\nStarring: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz, Colm Feore, Paul Giamatti, Sally Field\n\nDirector: Marc Webb\n\nI liked it! Much the same as the first franchise, this has action with levity, and I liked\n\nAmerican Beauty ‡O\n\n1999 Mark: 10\n\nWatched: Mon 1 August 2016\n\nStarring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Benning\n\nDirector: Sam Mendes\n\nYou wanna know how blokes think? Watch this. If you don't understand it, you never will\n\nCaught up with it to try to get my life back together after watching Ghostbusters (2016), and it will never quite erase the scars but it sure helped me through a horrible period. It is truly a masterpiece, with impeccable acting performances from a perfectly cast cast, a tremendous story, awesome comedy and the bravest morality of many a film. It isn't brave to make 12 years a Slave, good as it is. It is brave to say a 42 year old gets a boner for high school cheerleaders and that he is a good man for it.\n\nAmerican Gangster\n\n2007 Mark: 9\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Denzill Washinton, Russell Crowe, Josh Brolin, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Cuba Gooding\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nYeay. Terrific film, watched it twice and I reckon it won't do any harm to watch it again sometime\n\nAmerican Hustle\n\n2013 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Sat 18 January 2014\n\nStarring: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert Di Nero\n\nDirector: David O. Russell\n\nA thought provoking film, in that though I imagine that actually going to the cinema enrichens a film, I consider that this one might stand up almost as well at home. Me Julia and the bloke I spoke to on the way out were not particularly enthusiastic about it, the guy said \"I don't see how it would get all the awards\" (Best comedy/musical film, actress and supporting actress at The Golden Globes last week, January 2014). I disagree. I'd almost cite it as the best comedy I have seen this year, as though it is not overtly hilarious, there are several LOL moments (whoops, I forgot about The Legend Continues for a moment there). Mr Banks or Frozen would get best musical, but... The soundtrack which is largely derivative is as good a soundtrack of that type, starting with Steely Dan's Dirty Work, followed by pre-lame big band Chicago, even featuring the awesome but critically underrated ELO twice.\n\nAnyhow. Best actress and supporting actress would get my nod, though I don't know who was better, the super sexy pouty lipped sweeet Amy Adams, or the dishevelled slutty borderline nut job that Jennifer Lawrence absolutely nails. Fuck, I even like Hunger Games more now. Christian Bale?? best actor 2013 for me. It has been nominated for all four acting categories at the Oscars. If there were five it would not be undeserved.\n\nI went in with a weight of expectation tempered by reservations I had heard. There was no need to worry. It was just a great long solid story with a superb cast, not quite the denouement of The Sting but then I do believe it was based on facts (it says \"Some of this actually happened\") at the start of the film. Consequently there may be some understandable disappoint if you expect a conventional story arc that resolves itself satisfactorily  it doesn't do that, but I don't want to say too much about the actual tale told. If you have a choice between this and 12 years get a Subway, three cookies for a quid and watch this (then go and watch 12 and slate me for being shallow and racist)\n\nDASH!! I just knew it was Robert De Niro as Victor Tellegio. Last Vegas and this have officially redeemed him (I've been to Wikipedia).\n\nAn American In Paris ‡O\n\n1951 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Fri 27 February 2015\n\nStarring: Gene Kelly, Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Georges Guétary, Nina Foch\n\nDirector: Vincente Minnelli\n\nIt's not much of a story. If it had a story half as good as The Legend Of Hercules it would be a 10! But it hasn't. That's the negative stuff out of the way. Every other aspect of this film is magnificent, the dialogue, the actors, the music, and especially the dancing. Gene Kelly was a genius, no two ways about it, and I was watching this open mouthed with a smile and thinking This is the great grandfather of Birdman ; that is to say, just like Singing In The Rain the takes are really long, and must demand amazing timing and accuracy, the whole ensemble and crew being part of an intricate dance. Even ballet is watchable in this.\n\nTo be truthful it is an exercise in filmed theatre, rather than a film story, but the quality of the ingredients make it so well worth the watch. It would have been an eight but I had OD'd on the final routine!\n\nNB, although the soundtrack is absolutely classic (largely the Gershwins') It is, nevertheless derivative, in that the original music had been composed over 20 years previously\n\nAmerican Sniper\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Fri 16 January 2015\n\nStarring: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller\n\nDirector: Clint Eastwood\n\nClint Eastwood has moved on a bit since Heartbreak Ridge . In this film he takes a true patriot story and paints it with stars and stripes, all very moving. Bradley Cooper has moved on from American Hustle (in which he was good) and I can see why he has been nominated for best actor. He won't get it as there are three stand outs in front of him, nevertheless he was as convincing a seal as Paddington was a bear, i.e. absolutely believable. He definitely has the best movie sniff ever!\n\nIf you enjoyed Fury, The Monuments Men, The Railwayman and Unbroken you'll enjoy this. I enjoyed those four so.... (Do the math). This has a brief, but I consider very convincing, scene when they watch 9/11 on telly. Just thought I'd throw that in there.\n\nAmerica's Sweethearts\n\n2001 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sat 24 May 2014\n\nStarring: Catherine Zeta Jones, Julia Roberts, Billy Crystal, John Cusack, Hank Azaria, Stanley Tucci, Seth Green, Alan Arkin, Christopher Walken\n\nDirector: Joe Roth\n\nErr... Well it is in my top 1000 rom-coms I think. Look, I was entertained by it and Fall Out Boy named a song after it\n\nAmistad\n\n1997 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Wed 1 March 2017\n\nStarring: Morgan Freeman, Nigel Hawthorne, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou, Matthew McConaughey, David Paymer, Pete Postlethwaite, Stellan Skarsgård, Razaaq Adoti, Abu Bakaar Fofanah, Anna Paquin, Tomas Milian, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Derrick Ashong, Geno Silva, John Ortiz, Kevin J. O'Connor, Ralph Brown, Darren E. Burrows, Allan Rich, Paul Guilfoyle, Peter Firth, Xander Berkeley, Jeremy Northam, Arliss Howard, Austin Pendleton, Pedro Armendáriz Jr.\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nIt must be a month since I saw this, and I should not leave it so long; I really can't remember the detail at all! That's the great thing about getting old! I must check with Jake but my memory tells me this was kind of what you would expect from Spielberg with this cast. Don't be scared to watch it again in a couple of years.\n\nAmy\n\n2015 Mark: 8.4\n\nWatched: Sun 6 March 2016\n\nStarring: Amy Winehouse\n\nDirector: Asif Kapadia\n\nAn absolutely knockout documentary. It is only after the watching that I read it was made by the same people who did Senna, and wow, they did a great job. The thing is, I am not an Amy Winehouse fan. I don't mind her, but I have never been that enamoured by her voice (brilliant as it may be, I never thought Billie Holiday was a patch on Ella), and the hoopla surrounding her has turned me off. Watching this film does, to a degree, make me happy that I was not part of that, even if only the tiniest little bit of someone who bought a Sun or an OK magazine. It is brilliantly put together, and in a way it is a salutary warning to everybody, I can't give anything away, but like any good story it has its villains, its heroes, and poor Amy Winehouse may just be the McGuffin, the device around which the plot revolves. For an uncomfy watch it gets a huge rating for me. Recommended\n\nAnastasia\n\n1997 Mark: 4\n\nWatched: Mon 30 November 2015\n\nStarring: Meg Ryan, Kirsten Dunst, Lacey Chabert, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria, Angela Lansbury\n\nDirectors: Don Bluth, Gary Goldman\n\nPlease don't take any gorm of my rating, I only watched 10 minutes of this and couldn't be bothered, as it just seemed to be saying everything was just great in Russia before those pesky Commies spoilt everything, and I'm not sure it was. Disney Princesses are fictional and good. The Romanovs are not, and weren't\n\nAnchorman 1: The Legend Of Ron Burgandy\n\n2004 Mark: 9.6\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, David Koechner, Fred Willard\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nSee Anchorman 2\n\nAnchorman 2: The Legend Continues\n\n2013 Mark: 9\n\nWatched: Wed 18 December 2013\n\nStarring: Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Kristen Wiig, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, David Koechne, Dylan Baker, Harrison Ford, Sacha Baron Cohen, Marion Cotillard, Will Smith, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Carrey, Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Amy Poehler, John C. Reilly, Vince Vaughn, Kanye West\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nNo plot (to speak of), repetitious, predictable, Fekkin AWESOME!!! This is why you go to the movies\n\nAngel-A\n\n2005 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Tue 25 November 2014\n\nStarring: Jamel Debbouze, Rie Rasmussen\n\nDirector: Luc Besson\n\nIt's black and white and it's French. Now normally that would be a negative but, not wishing to sound too pretentious here, they both are vital to the atmosphere of this movie. The cinematography is starkly evocative, the dialogue perfectly sensually Gallic. It just could not be the same in English. (The subtitles bale you out). I have never seen such a beautiful film in terms of its treatment of sexuality. I would liken it to that feeling you get when you want to sleep with someone so much that you are genuinely not concerned about nailing them. I can really identify with Andre, and the comedy is so laid back as sometimes you don't notice it (I think, but I didn't notice it!!). BIG SPOILER ALERT Please don't read this if you haven't seen it. When Angela came out of the water at the end of the film I just wish she would have said \"Je suis Catherine, qui la baise êtes-vous?\"\n\nThe Angel's Share\n\n2012 Mark: 9.001\n\nWatched: Mon 27 April 2015\n\nStarring: Paul Brannigan, John Henshaw, William Ruane, Gary Maitland, Jasmin Riggins, Siobhan Reilly, Roger Allam\n\nDirector: Ken Loach\n\nA caper in the finest British tradition, it took me back to Gregory's Girl, or even better, That Sinking Feeling . Ken Loach has been making films for over half a century and he knows what he is doing, with an unknown cast and what looks like on the fly location shooting, this is the antidote to Under The Skin . Scottish humour is so much more authentic than Scouse, right from the get go you know this is going to be funny, poignant and just a great watch, and it doesn't let off. Yeah there are holes in the logic, but WTF? I am presuming a definite August Rush effect, Angela says  Ten . I can see that. Superb\n\nThe Angry Birds Movie\n\n2016 Mark: 5\n\nWatched: Tue 17 May 2016\n\nStarring: Jason Sudeikis, Josh Gad, Danny McBride, Maya Rudolph, Kate McKinnon, Sean Penn, Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, Bill Hader, Peter Dinklage\n\nDirector: Clay Kaytis, Fergal Reilly\n\nColourful, but ultimately lacking in original story or empathic characters.\n\nAnna Karenina\n\n2012 Mark: 4\n\nWatched: Sat 27 February 2016\n\nStarring: Kiera Knightley, Jude Law, Aaron Johnson, Kelly Macdonald, Matthew Macfadyen, Domhnall Gleeson, Ruth Wilson, Alicia Vikander, Olivia Williams, Emily Watson\n\nDirector: Joe Wright\n\nI really enjoy period drama, but this just did not do it for me, it seemed to be stuck too far up its own arse to observe. My goodness it was sumptuous, and the filming was a work of perfection, but after half an hour I was left wondering who was who and where were they going? Philistine!\n\nAnnie\n\n2014 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Mon 29 December 2014\n\nStarring: Quvenzhané Wallis, Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale, Cameron Diaz, David Zayas\n\nDirector: Will Gluck\n\nOMG. I feel like such a faggot, I didn't like this.... I LOVED IT. I can't believe how something produced by Will Smith and Jay Z came out so well for me (perhaps they cancelled each other out). It is years since I saw the musical, so I am not familiar with all but the two most famous songs, which perhaps suspended my negativity I might have had about the music. It IS as corny as corn can be, it is a shock to see Jamie Foxx singing, it is curiously synced, there is a deal about the happy natives playing banjos in the sun about this film, it IS materialistic, but anybody who claims not to aspire to materialism is about as truthful as a straight guy who says he doesn't find a Tracy Lords centrefold attractive (after he has found out she was 15). It provides for me an excellent contrast to the film I watched two hours afterwards Under The Skin which, unlike Annie received huge acclaim from many critics, yet just didn't do it anything like a much for me. It is the world is shit so I want a distraction syndrome for me I think. For most people it's the world is 'hey fantastic, now say boo to me'\n\nOh... Cameron Diaz was really good in this (I never thought I would say that)\n\nAnnie Hall ‡O\n\n1977 Mark: 5\n\nWatched: Wed 11 May 2016\n\nStarring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Christopher Walken, Geoff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nOriginally I only watched this half way through. I like Jewish New York comedy, but maybe Woody Allen has had too many imitators for my liking. I may try again. I did try again... I look at my previous rating of 4 and thought I'd up it by 1 on the day. The day after watching Manhattan I feel like dropping it again, for the reasons outlined in that review\n\nAnomalisa ‡O\n\n2015 Mark: 7.8\n\nWatched: Tue 29 November 2016\n\nStarring: David Thewlis, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Tom Noonan\n\nDirectors: Charlie Kaufman, Duke Johnson\n\nWow! This was unique, disturbing and delightful in equal measures. I didn't know quite what was going on until I read the synopses, SPOILER ALERT: Michael is not gay, he just hears most everybody in the same voice and sees them with the same face - that's the point.\n\nWhat this film does well (apart from the absolutely fascinating, immersing animation) is delve into the microcosm of one /two people's world and ekes out the nuance and tragedy of it all. Game of Thrones It is not, but the detail and insight is still fascinating. If it had been a book I would not have wanted to put it down. I think this might be termed a masterpiece.\n\nAnt-Man\n\n2015 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Thu 23 July 2015\n\nStarring: Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Corey Stoll, Bobby Cannavale, Michael Peña, Tip T.I. Harris, Wood Harris, Michael Douglas\n\nDirector: Peyton Reed\n\nWell, could this be my favourite Marvel film so far? Paul Rudd is excellent, he doesn't cloy like Robert Downey or other Marvel heroes, the humour is  well humorous, the action is ace, the surprise high, I just thoroughly enjoyed it. Oh, and Edgar Wright. I might have guessed.\n\nThe Apartment ‡O\n\n1960 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Sat 10 October 2015\n\nStarring: Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Jack Kruschen\n\nDirector: Billy Wilder\n\nHow foolish can two people be? Jack Lemmon is almost too good an actor, his timing and inflexion is so deliberate it leaves nothing to the imagination. Although some of this film kept the attention a lot of it was just too corny. The old days were great then though, when it was perfectly normal for geriatric blokes to go out with twenty somethings\n\nApocalypse Now\n\n1979 Mark: 6.8\n\nWatched: Sun 4 September 2016\n\nStarring: Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, Larry Fishburne, Dennis Hopper\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nIf this was one of the best movies ever made I would not be a cinema fan! Like Full Metal Jacket it has an awesome set-up, and some arresting and one truly great scene, but then deteriorates into a clock watching exposé of the 'horrors of war, which, to an old cynic like me, is more about the self indulgence and pious righteousness of the film-maker. I watched the 'redux' version which contains 45 minutes additional footage. Perhaps the original cut was not such a challenge, whatever, one aspect I picked up on was the music. It was almost jokey, like some early video game score with simple four track synth which actually sounds like a mid 70s synth. Whadya know - It was the director's dad.\n\nMarlon Brando is the most overrated actor of all time. Like this film, I think a lot of people are scared to stand against the tide of praise of what is undoubtedly expensive, technically dense, but fundamentally unextraordinary experience when taken in total\n\nApollo 13\n\n1995 Mark: 9.4\n\nWatched: Sun 27 September 2015\n\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Joe Spano\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nUtterly wonderful story and a one of the all time greatest moments in cinematic history. OK, it doesn't matter if you know what happens, on at least the third re-watching it is still a life-affirming, patiently and precisely focused, hats in the air, hug the person next to you moment which brings a moistness to my eyes even thinking about it.\n\nIs it a valid criticism to say there was just a tweench too much of Wesley Crusher at his peak of cheese about some of the family members? It feels sacrilegious to state so, but, whatever, haters gotta hate!\n\nNo really, I now remember how, after Jake reminded me I took the whole family to see it back in the day, that I held they're hands and said \" That's it, they're gone; what a great, tragic, story eh? :( \" (OK I know, it wasn't those exact words and I didn't use emoticons in 1995, but you know what I mean)\n\nArgo ‡O\n\n2012 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Mon 24 February 2014\n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Brian Cranston, Bob Gunton, Alan Arkin\n\nDirector: Ben Affleck\n\nYou can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day.\n\nWorth the plaudits, thoroughly interesting and with a grip that tightens as the film unfolds. Always been a fan of Ben Affleck's (thanks to Kevin Smith) and with the historical angle* it is just so much more nail baiting than, for instance, Gravity . The cast convince and we'll let 'em off the Independence Day moment at the end. The quote at the top, by the way, is spoken to Ben Affleck  his reaction is just perfect. He now holds two of my best of film things  best statement of unrequited love ( Chasing Amy ) and most subtle break through the fourth wall.\n\n*P.S. I read that there is a lot of fiction in this film!\n\nArmageddon\n\n1998 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Sun 3 March 2013\n\nStarring: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Peter Stormare, William Fitchner, Steve Buscimi, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Jason Isaacs, Michael Clarke Duncan\n\nDirector: Michael Bay\n\nDidn't give it a rating at the time, but as I remember it was highly entertaining\n\nArrival ‡O (nom)\n\n2016 Mark: 8.51\n\nWatched: Fri 11 November 2016\n\nStarring: Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker, Michael Stuhlbarg, Mark O'Brien, Tzi Ma\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nAn absolutely ace antidote to stupid Independence Day 2. I still don't buy the ultimate premise... Actually I DO. If you are going to watch it, be patient as you will be curious as to the aliens' motives, and they are revealed later on. Amy Adams, as Louise, is kind of perfect, and I think she will get at least a nomination for this. I do hope somebody will watch this and discuss it with me. (N.b. I watched three films today, and this, at 8.51 was the worst!! I love movies)\n\nAssassins Tale\n\n2013 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Sun 9 February 2014\n\nStarring: Michael Beach, Anna Silk\n\nDirector: Arthur Louis Fuller\n\nThis is the very best film I have ever watched which has no reference to any actors, crew or music that I am aware of. I meant to put Argo on, and this was clicked by accident. I thought \"Oh my god it is gonna be gratuitously violent and a potential go to sleep or turn off. Far from it. Characters get 5 stars, plot gets a good three, augmented by an absolutely brilliant soundtrack which made me want to go and check the lot out. I have to watch it again with one of the kids. I am sure I will not downgrade it.. I can't even find it on IMDB or Wikipedia\n\nAugust Rush\n\n2007 Mark: 9.1\n\nWatched: Tue 1 April 2014\n\nStarring: Freddy Highmore, Keri Russell, Robin Williams, Terrence Howard\n\nDirector: Kirsten Sheridan\n\nWow... I am totally stupefied by this film. Is it the rum? Well, I don't know; what I do know is that this film had me wiping tears away. Never have the advert breaks been more unwelcome, I only wish I had had someone to share this wonderful experience with. You see, this had a great story - predictable but great nevertheless. In the lead and Robin Williams there were two top notch characters and the others were not so bad. But the music, the glorious, uplifting, original loads of harmonics and open tunings music. The interpolation and juxtaposition of the genres. I am thinking the only people capable of understanding how thoroughly hooked I was into this universe would be very thin on the ground. Barbara, Julia, Ella, watch this film please. Trust me, you may think it's garbage. But if your disbelief gets suspended you are in for a treat.\n\nPS I spoke to Julia the day after and she thought it was lame!\n\nAustralia\n\n2008 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Fri 30 October 2015\n\nStarring: Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, David Wenham, David Gulpilil, Brandon Walters, Ben Mendelsohn\n\nDirector: Baz Luhrman\n\nEpic! What an absolutely super quasi-gay, immerse yourself in theatre, eye pleasing, amusing, exciting, disbelief suspending slab of mother loving EPIC. It approaches the cinematic breadth of Lawrence Of Arabia, with the unapologetic emotional blackmail of August Rush . I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but this is without doubt beautifully made, and is a perfect example of modern story-telling.\n\nWhy \"quasi-gay\"? Because there is a moment in the ballroom scene when my jaw dropped and I came as close as I ever have to getting a boner for a bloke! (I didn't, but I now know what to aim for when I go out to impress chicks).\n\nBaz Lurhman is amazing. six days later I want to up this film's rating.\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron\n\n2015 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Thu 23 April 2015\n\nStarring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgård, James Spader, Samuel L. Jackson, Stan Lee\n\nDirector: Joss Wheldon\n\nBeing senile and square, I am just getting the hang of who's who in the Marvel Universe, consequently I identified more with this instalment than all it's predecessors. It is a proper film, and I am sure that the vast majority of the pretty full house must have gone away well satisfied . SPOILER ALERT: The story was leaked prior to release (every Power Rangers episode), but hey! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Awesome, awesome characters, fantastic special effects, hilarious dialogue (especially Thor), this film would be as good a reason as any to explain why one goes to the movies\n\nBack To The Future 1\n\n1985 Mark: 10\n\nWatched: Sat 2 July 2011\n\nStarring: Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson, Lea Thompson\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nThis stands alone or as part of the best trilogy ever. It has carved its place in the hearts of up too press, two generations (McFly were not born when this came out). Story and characters Perfect\n\nBack To The Future 2\n\n1989 Mark: 10\n\nWatched: Sun 3 July 2011\n\nStarring: Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson, Lea Thompson\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nSee BTTF 1. My favourite movie scene of all time is at the end of this film. Pray they never reboot it\n\nBack To The Future 3\n\n1990 Mark: 10\n\nWatched: Mon 4 July 2011\n\nStarring: Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson, Lea Thompson\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nSee BTTF 1. your future hasn't been written yet. No one's has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one\"\n\nBad Lieutenant\n\n2009 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sun 2 March 2014\n\nStarring: Nick Cage, Eva Mendes, Val Kilmer, Brad Dourif\n\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\nI really feel I should have given this more, but I didn't 'get it' Nic Cage is a complete lunatic, and despite some absolutely cracking films ( Matchstick Men, Lord Of War ), just loses his shit too much on occasions. Why would a hot chick like Eva Mendes even fancy him?\n\nBad Moms\n\n2016 Mark: 7.8\n\nWatched: Wed 28 September 2016\n\nStarring: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Jay Hernandez, Jada Pinkett Smith, Christina Applegate.\n\nDirectors: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore\n\nOh, I'm sorry, I can't help liking this. So much more enjoyable, for me at least, than the latest Bridget Jones offering. It could have easily been Seth Rogan and co, but Mila Kunis was reasonably, surprisingly well convincing, totally not playing on her FHM top 10 placing yet not being frumpy with it. Christina Applegate is gold! If you like those American comedies that I think they do so well, this is just more of the same! No complaints\n\nBad Neighbours\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 5 May 2014\n\nStarring: Seth Rogan, Zac Effron\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nZac Efron WILL do an action movie soon, and he will be good at it. This is exactly what you would tip from Seth Rogan, and had some genuine Laugh Out Loud moments. Yeah  it was good. Watch it. But do not expect anything beyond the expected\n\nBad Neighbours 2\n\n2016 Mark: 7.8\n\nWatched: Wed 4 May 2016\n\nStarring: Zac Efron, Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Chloë Grace Moretz, Dave Franco\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nAww! There is so little to dislike about this film, once it has sucked you in (I am easily sucked in) it is classic American stoner comedy, like Trainwreck, Daddy's Home or any amount of offerings of the same genre, this is just a fine escape, which you might forget in a decade but you enjoy now\n\nBarton Fink\n\n1991 Mark: 7\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: John Turturro\n\nDirector: Coen Brothers\n\nI'm pretty sure that if I watch this again I will up it from a 7. Love that picture.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\n2008 Mark: 8.7\n\nWatched: Sun 7 August 2016\n\nStarring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger‡O , Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nThe kind of film that makes one want to watch the whole series, to immerse oneself in the canon, the comics the conventions. I rate this film highly, but believe it is even better than my 8.7 suggests. The fact is SPOILER ALERT, we are kind of rootin' for Harvey and it gets all sad about him. More power to the film, in which Heath Ledger deserves the nod and the whole shebang presents a package of what entertainment should be. Definitely going back to Begins and Rises!\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises\n\n2012 Mark: 8.6\n\nWatched: Mon 29 August 2016\n\nStarring: Christian Bale, Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman, Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy as Bane, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Morgan Freeman, Matthew Modine, Ben Mendelsohn, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Aidan Gillen, Tom Conti, William Devane, Aaron Eckhart\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nWhat made this film so good? It may be that I watched a great copy of it on a brilliant telly, It may have been the all-star cast, it may have been a broad, coherent, interesting, surprising and ultimately satisfying story-arc. Whatever, this is what an action film should do, thrill without insulting the intelligence, be ever so slightly self deprecating, one always feel that despite the serious issues and totally convincing acting there is always a bit of the comic about it. Writing this down makes me realise that my initial thoughts on an 8+ were not misplaced.\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\n\n2016 Mark: 7.1\n\nWatched: Wed 30 March 2016\n\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Jeremy Irons, Holly Hunter\n\nDirector: Zack Snyder\n\nGlad I saw it. Good, but disappointing in that it was overcooked. It could have been three films with a bit more patience and development, and been a real set of stories rather than a two hour edition of Power Rangers. The cast were good, the premise fantastic, the action typical, but the science doubtful. It was like the stock characters outlined at the beginning of Deadpool have all been put here (apart from Jeremy Irons not being a criminal).\n\nBatman has always delivered crazy villains with humour. Superman likewise, with the bad guys getting more and more deranged throughout the tale. It's a great trope. Jessie Eisenberg, though suitably deranged and malevolent is like that from the get go, he hasn't been given enough \"I want to be accepted\" to work with. Whatever. Go and see it, but don't expect Batman Begins.\n\nAmy Adams, if you ever read this, I love you, but am not sure if your beauty and sweetness is just an on-screen persona, or the real you. If you are ever in Yorkshire and would like a date, we could take the dog for a walk, catch a movie, share a bottle of wine, whatever, just to see how it goes.\n\nBattle Of The River Plate\n\n1956 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Mon 22 December 2014\n\nStarring: John Gregson, Anthony Quayle, Peter Finch, Patrick Macnee, Roger Delgado, John Le Mesurier\n\nDirectors: Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger\n\nI usually enjoy factual films, but this seemed just a little bit too much like a 6th form production at a school where the chaps had never met girls before. They should have got C.S. Forrester to write the screenplay\n\nBattlefield Death Tales\n\n2012 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Fri 31 March 2017\n\nStarring: David Wayman\n\nDirectors: James Eaves, Pat Higgins, Alan Ronald\n\nI quite enjoyed the first segment of this three parter, it was more shlock than horror, and reasonably entertaining, the kind of film I would gladly sit through with a fan, but not one that I would watch for 90 minutes when there is still a list of 50 or so films on my hard drive to cross off.\n\nBeasts Of No Nation\n\n2015 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Wed 6 May 2015\n\nStarring: Idris Elba, Abraham Attah\n\nDirector: Cary Fukunaga\n\nPlease don't look at the 7.2 mark here as anything more than the enjoyment I got from this film. The fact is it was extraordinarily uncomfortable to watch, nevertheless I would not be shy about using the word 'brilliant' to describe it. I noticed that Idris Elba was a producer on this - is he a true artist?, because his performance was scarily breathtaking, and, coupled with a child performance I have never seen bettered, from Abraham Attah, this, almost documentary, of war in Africa is as thought provoking as a film can get. Can I say it was beautifully filmed? Can I say the soundtrack complimented, not patronised. Can I say gives insight and understanding into that people doing terrible things are not bad people?\n\nHere is the biggest \"Can I?\" Can I compare this to Mean Girls ?\n\nSPOILER ALERT: The thing is, it IS the same story, that of assimilation of an individual by a group, who becomes corrupted, does terrible things and seeks redemption. The contrast of delivery could not be starker, and therein lies the dichotomy; to get a message across do we sweeten it, or punch it? I really don't know, my heart says punch, but my reviews say sweeten. Of course, I guess, both are valid, but which is effective? Perhaps neither. Sad face :(\n\nBeautiful Creatures\n\n2013 Mark: 6.4\n\nWatched: Thu 29 October 2015\n\nStarring: Alden Ehrenreich, Alice Englert, Jeremy Irons, Viola Davis, Emmy Rossum, Thomas Mann, Emma Thompson\n\nDirector: Richard LaGravenese\n\nThis is a bit like watching a condensed version of True Blood . Very American teen, a little bit too self righteous, nevertheless a well put together piece of evening distraction which I enjoyed watching, not least because of an A list supporting cast!\n\nA Beautiful Mind ‡O\n\n2001 Mark: 7.7\n\nWatched: Tue 25 October 2016\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, Christopher Plummer\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nShould you see it? - Most definitely.\n\nOK, that's the review, but on an entirely individual basis this just highlighted how important it is, if you are going to keep diary of films, it is to record one's thoughts contemporaneously. I have had this film on this review list since its inception three years ago with the comment \"Russell Crowe is very good in this, but I reckon Good Will Hunting does the genius thing better\". This is misleading.\n\nRussell Crowe should have got the Oscar for this, at least in front of Denzel Washington (who was also brilliant in Training Day). The fact is, this film is not GWH never will be, and doesn't want to be. The sets are sometimes similar, and the some of the dramatis personae likewise. We have a genius, but troubled, mathematician, a psychologist, an untypical love affair, tremendous achievement, but these are more coincidental rather than derivative. This film has the 'true story' advantage, and it can't be helped if GWH is just one of the best films made, therefore that should not detract from what is an engaging window into a world so different to mine, but not in a Doctor Strange way!\n\nBecket\n\n1964 Mark: 7.4\n\nWatched: Mon 24 October 2016\n\nStarring: Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud, Martitia Hunt\n\nDirector: Peter Glenville\n\nAnother of those films that gets a leg up for its historical perspective, its 'quiz content' as you might say. I kind of see what people see in Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton, the entire film is totally theatrical and quite camp, yet I was really rooting for both these guys and all their faults of arrogance, overbearing piety, selfishness, and my general detestation of monarchy and religion. It was a half decent yarn, and it looked good, in a saturated Technicolor kind of way. I would settle for one of these a day if the alternative was nothing (But not if Hail Caesar! was on at the pictures!)\n\nBedazzled (2000)\n\n2000 Mark: 5\n\nWatched: Tue 9 September 2014\n\nStarring: Brendan Fraizer, Liz Hurley, Paul Adelstein\n\nDirector: Harold Ramis\n\nJust a watch, a bit dicky at times, nevertheless entertaining if not a tad repetitive. It's very rare that I give a film a straight five, nevertheless I suppose it was worth a watch\n\nBelle\n\n2013 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Fri 27 June 2014\n\nStarring: Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Tom Wilkinson, Miranda Richardson, Penelope Wilton, Sam Reid, Matthew Goode, Emily Watson, Sarah Gadon, Tom Felton, James Norton\n\nDirector: Amma Asante\n\nEntertaining, cool film. This was really teetering on the 8 for me, just a couple of little things (The hair combing and other little incidents). From a historical aspect it was thought provoking, and in terms of a love story it was terrific. Why anybody would ever want to watch Wanking On Sunshine when this is on next door I could not imagine, unless of course they do not enjoy being challenged at all. I didn't only just enjoy this more, but as an exposition of human nature this came out better than 12 Years A Slave, in that there was the ambiguity within all the characters that was more polarised by Steve McQueen (I re-iterate, 12 years was still a good film)\n\nTom Wilkinson gets my first nomination for best actor 2014 (though I may have to check back)\n\nBen Hur (2016)\n\n2016 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Fri 23 September 2016\n\nStarring: Jack Huston, Toby Kebbell, Morgan Freeman\n\nDirector: Timur Bekmambetov\n\nIf Sausage Party was a bonobo, this was the chimpanzee, all bluster and battle and belief, that made for better entertainment than the original. It was almost as if it were saying, look - this is a Judo-Christian story, but tolerate the just tolerable righteous bits and we will give you a gung ho movie with some terrific action and a predictable, yet tried, trusted, therefore enjoyable yarn. Actually a recommended watch!\n\nBen-Hur ‡O\n\n1959 Mark: 4\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Charlton Heston\n\nDirector: William Wyler\n\nToo long, too righteous\n\nThe Best Of Me\n\n2014 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Wed 15 October 2014\n\nStarring: James Marsden, Michelle Monaghan, Luke Bracey, Liana Liberato\n\nDirector: Michael Hoffman\n\nMy goodness I had to take some deep swallows to sit through this one, but, you know, there was more good than bad about it. I reckon the male female ratio in the cinema on this particular Orange Wednesday was perhaps 1 to 20. The main man was just a bit too perfect, which no doubt explains the girly bias, and there were many excruciating (for me) glances, passages and scenes, nevertheless, it had its moments, it didn't resort to God, the plot took some surprising turns, the scenery was superb. And so yes, it gets a slight thumbs up. Not quite Labour Day, but worth the trip. Fuck I feel dorky on my own! Luke Bracey as young Dawson was very good\n\nThe Best Years Of Our Lives ‡O\n\n1946 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Mon 23 March 2015\n\nStarring: Frederick March‡O, Myrna Loy, Dana Andrews, Teresa Wright, Virginia Mayo, Cathy O'Donnell, Hoagy Carmichael, Harold Russell‡O\n\nDirector: William Wyler‡O\n\nA multiple Oscar winner, it seems to be the one which has most faded from the public eye. The first 50 minutes or so are terrific, when, given the constraints of what was a film industry still learning, we have a great set up, but... It really doesnt go anywhere once the guys all come back from a night on the town. I might suggest that the film is heavily constrained by the mores of the day, which leaves one feeling that so much is missing, specifically sex, arguably the most important thing relationships, is barely alluded to, and though it was fine to chain smoke and get so drunk you couldnt remember, I reckon a boner was out of the question. It is a shame because the characters were there, a fistful of them which looked down the road of development but never travelled down there. It was not all sweetness and light, but I can only assume it was artistically stifled by an industry wracked with fear, so any gritty realism was constrained by censorship, overt or otherwise. For 1946 Passport To Pimlico was a far more enjoyable film.\n\nNB this film, as well as getting the gongs for film, director, actor, supporting actor and director is the sixth most ticketed in British history and makes all sorts of best of lists.\n\nA good film, but it could have been so much better. We had to wait another 32 years for The Deer Hunter to illustrate the damage of war more vividly to the Academy\n\nThe BFG (2016)\n\n2016 Mark: 8.8\n\nWatched: Tue 26 July 2016\n\nStarring: Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill, Penelope Wilton, Jemaine Clement, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall, Bill Hader\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nThoroughly thoroughly enchanting film. Having said that, it has been pointed out that it lacks some of the edge of the book. Fortunately I'm senile and forgetful, and just marvelled at the superb CGI, and the remarkable treatment of gravity. Like it says, its a collaboration between three of the greatest storytellers the world has known so it would be hard to cock it up, and how far wrong can you go with the magnificent Mark Rylance?\n\nBicycle Thieves\n\n1948 Mark: 6.7\n\nWatched: Sun 13 November 2016\n\nStarring: Lamberto Maggiorani, Enzo Staiola\n\nDirector: Vittorio De Sica\n\nThe moment a film falls into a bracket slightly more convoluted than 'action' or 'rom-com' I feel some circumspection. This film is \"Post-war Italian neorealism\" and goodness, it has received high praise in some quarters. Look, I didn't hate it by a long chalk, and as a window into a Rome only a thousand kilometres away from Passport To Pimlico and even less from The Third Man, it works from a documentary perspective. That complete amateur actors carry it off on unclosed sets is not only admirable, but it actually works, in that any hamminess on their part is indistinguishable from that in other films from the same decade (I am thinking of How Green Was My Valley which cost ten times more and isn't anything like as convincing). As a bangs for bucks exercise ($80,000) it is an object lesson in film making, but, when it comes down to it, it is a clumsy toddler compared with its descendents, notably loads of films by the likes of Ken Loach. It stereotypes people, and whether 20,000 years BC or Walking on Sunshine, pigeonholing groups and individuals only works if it is comedy, or, at least, satire. (I do recognise the original thief though, from many encounters in my own life, the little bastard!). Worth the watch for the history, and the chance that you may agree with the cognoscenti\n\nBig Bad Wolves\n\n2013 Mark: 5?\n\nWatched: Sat 1 April 2017\n\nStarring:\n\nDirector: Aharon Keshales, Navot Papushado\n\nA protracted slow motion scene did not endear myself to this film from the get go. Some really 'amateur dramatic' acting in the first dialogue scene sealed it for me after 10 minutes, turn it off, delete it, move on, leave it to fans of the genre.\n\nBig Eyes\n\n2014 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Sun 4 October 2015\n\nStarring: Amy Adams, Christoph Waltz, Jason Schwartzman, Terrence Stamp\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nIt is a sad indictment of people's viewing at the Cinema to think that this had such a short run that I didn't get to see it when it was out. Whatever, I slotted it on this morning and it had me from the get-go, that get go being the totally beautiful Amy Adams and the over the top but irresistible Waltz. Quite a drastic difference for Tim Burton in that there was nothing imaginary or fantastical about the tale. Nearer Wes Anderson without the comedy than what you would expect, still beautifully made, but more dependant on the drama. Modern films eh, great ones are mundanely common.\n\nBig Fish\n\n2003 Mark: 10\n\nWatched: Sat 1 March 2014\n\nStarring: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Marion Cotillard, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Steve Buscimi, Matthew McGrory, Danny DeVito, Destiny (ie Miley) Cyrus\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nGolly gosh. Here goes.. if you haven't seen this don't read this. This is as close to a perfect film as you are going to get, I mean all the technical stuff is right, but the characters and story. I know I keep harking back to these, but this is totally transfixing; it is surreal, funny, tear jerking, it has true love, insurmountable odds, fantastical, satisfying. I want to send a thank you letter to Tim Burton for making my favourite film of the 2000s and one which, given I HAVE to put a rank on it is confirmed as number 4 on my all time list. I watched it again over two nights, as I had had a drink and didn't want to watch a new film with my senses impaired! I cried and thought my life (55, friendless, shagless, jobless, only saying things which people don't want to hear) is probably not that bad (super kids, house paid for, probably loads of friends, live in an age of unlimited free porn, jobless, truth telling and I can watch films like Big Fish ) As long as we can say this is the worst, this is not the worst! :)\n\nBig Game\n\n2014 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Thu 14 May 2015\n\nStarring: Samuel L. Jackson, Onni Tommila, Felicity Huffman, Victor Garber, Ted Levine, Jim Broadbent, Ray Stevenson\n\nDirector: Jalmari Helander\n\nA 2015 release in the UK, this is 51st State meets Olympus Has Fallen at The Edge with hilarious consequences. There was one portion of the film when, sat alone in a small theatre, I began to corpse with uncontrollable laughter, I mean it was just barmy, shot through with absolute plot holes, but you know what? IT DIDN'T MATTER! It was fun and Finnish, and I think it gave a flavour of that nation's attitudes, after all, they gave us 100 different genres of metal, they must have some tongues in cheek over there? One to watch on telly with a friend and some beer for def.\n\nNB The film's budget was 8.5 million, making it the most expensive ever produced in Finland\n\nBig Hero 6 ‡O (animated)\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 3 February 2015\n\nStarring: Ryan Potter, Scott Adsit, James Cromwell\n\nDirectors: Don Hall, Chris Williams\n\nA beautiful picture in terms of the canvas, but kind of weird in it's exceedingly imaginative interpretation of how this particular world of San Fransokyo works. I feel like dropping it a notch, but the fact is, it was entertaining, especially the referencing within it, The Marvel aspect, the Ghibli influence, the strange American/Japanese juxtaposition within the entire mise en scène, I mean the bad guy in his mask was No-Face straight out of Spirited Away . Worth the watch for sure\n\nThe Big Lebowski\n\n1998 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sat 18 January 2014\n\nStarring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Tara Reid\n\nDirector: Coen Brothers\n\nDreading writing this because I just did not think it was as good as some people think. The best group ever, Army Of Freshmen, love it. My son Jake says it is \"much better second time 'round\". I think I \"got it\", but after a second viewing I can't say that it was more than an interesting night in for me with a great cast, good cinematography and soundtrack, the best title fonts ever but lacking in the two most vital ingredients; plot and characters. WHAT!?!?! you may exclaim, no characters? Well yes, they were somehow over the top, lacking in genuine groundedness within the context of their own universe. Jeff Bridges was affable enough, but a dude who is funny because he is drunk or stoned is like something which is funny because you are drunk or stoned; it may not be. John Goodman was a boor. Steve Buscemi was the butt of a single joke repeatedly throughout the film. Hoffman was over the top, Waylon Smithers had done it all before. Why does Peter Stormare even take on these roles?\n\nLook, I know the Coen brothers wanted a plot that was 'Chandleresque\"; convoluted with lots of dead ends. Mission accomplished.\n\nTwo years earlier they made Fargo . I would have forgiven Hitler if he'd have made one film like Fargo .\n\nThe Big Short\n\n2015 Mark: 7.4\n\nWatched: Tue 26 January 2016\n\nStarring: Steve Carrell, Brad Pitt, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling. Melissa Leo, Marisa Tomei, Tracy Letts, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Byron Mann, Rafe Spall, Jeremy Strong, Finn Wittrock, Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez\n\nDirector: Adam McKay\n\nThere is a lot to like about this film, and quite a lot which put me on the back foot. The constant cutting, fly on the wall camerawork and breaking of the third wall were disconcerting, but kind of get the thumbs up. Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez were good ideas, even if they didn't work totally. The second thing is that in a rational market, where there is oversupply the price should drop. Simps. I told all you motherfuckers that whilst I was at Sheffield back in 2005, but then again, I'm just Steve Kidd, so I can't be right because you feel threatened by me\n\nThis is a totally convincing show from Steve Carrell, I though he was better in this than Foxcatcher, but I think I'll still be on my own with that.\n\nI may well have been disappointed to pay £12 to see this, but once again, with the Unlimited Card, it's a steal! I think you may give it a bigger score than I did. Good.\n\nBill And Ted 1: 's Excellent Adventure\n\n1989 Mark: 9.1\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin\n\nDirector: Stephen Herek\n\nFew better ways of spending a couple of hours. Slacker movie without the cheap shot of Drugs and Alcohol\n\nBill And Ted 2: 's Bogus Journey\n\n1991 Mark: 9.1\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin\n\nDirector: Peter Hewitt\n\nFew better ways of spending a couple of hours. Let's go back in time and get good.\n\nBirdman ‡O\n\n2014 Mark: 9.6\n\nWatched: Fri 2 January 2015\n\nStarring: Michael Keaton, Ed Norton, Emma Stone\n\nDirector: Alejandro González Iñárritu‡O\n\nOK, first things first.. This review was written before the Oscar nominations were announced. After they were announced I put £50 on this at 7/2 for best film, feeling that the favourite, Grand Budapest Hotel as well\n\nThe best film made in 2014. I've seen some good ones, but this is up there with Her , Pride . If the Oscars for actor, supporting actor, screenplay, cinematography and film went to this I would not have any complaints. I can confidently state that if you watch this and are not impressed and entertained by it you should stick to whatever genre it is you like and never listen to any of my recommendations again. I want to tell so many people to see it so I can discuss it, Michael Keaton... wow! Shut up Steve, before you give anything away.\n\nBy coincidence I watched perhaps the most under-rated film of all time yesterday, The Fall, which has a great deal in common with this. Watch them both, but try and maximise screen size for both\n\nBecca says: I have just totally geeked out! I've finally just watched Birdman, absolutely phenomenal, blew my mind, I cannot believe it has taken me this long to watch this film. It is narcissistic, self indulgent brilliance, the casting/acting was beyond all expectations. Zach G was one of my favourite characters even though he was just supporting, really surprised me. It blurred lines between reality and insanity, at times it was hard to tell where Riggan's mind starts and everyone else's begins. The cinematography was some of the best I have seen in a long time, the camera following stories round in real time was engaging and a stroke of genius. All in all one of the best films I have seen in a long time, stunning! 9/10 from me\n\nBlack Hawk Down\n\n2001 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Sat 8 August 2015\n\nStarring: Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Jason Isaacs, Sam Shepard, Orlando Bloom, Nicolai Coster Waldau\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nSome people will no doubt like this film more than me. Superbly filmed with a massive cast of great actors, It really didn't do it for me, Like Full Metal Jacket without the beginning bit, or like Gravity all the way through, it was magnificent, but there was no story to engage, even Ridley Scott says he had to write names on the helmets so one could identify who was on screen. Worth watching, if only to say you have seen it.\n\nBlack Sea\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Wed 10 December 2014\n\nStarring: Jude Law, Scoot McNairey\n\nDirector: Kevin Macdonald\n\nI suppose if you watched The Dirty Dozen, The Hunt For Red October and The Lavender Hill Mob you could piece together this particular film. I hope I haven't given to much away. Very reasonable film in all departments, Jude Law is really good, my favourite performance of his. I did think it was going to be worth a tad more at first, but still it maintained my interest throughout and delivered a couple of nice little angles to keep me awake. I would love to know what Andrew Kidd thinks of this (He is my nephew and is an expert on submarines. Hang on a minute, I'm thinking of a couple of plot holes here... Nah, doesn't matter, it's a yarn).\n\nAndrew Kidd says: Black Sea was good. As far as the technical submarine stuff goes, they have consciously used a lot of artistic license but have clearly done their homework and a lot of 'real' submarine stuff is in the film. Also I think I would have given Fury Road no more than a 1. The movie is beautiful but it is pure self indulgent BS.\n\nBlades Of Glory\n\n2007 Mark: 9.2\n\nWatched: Tue 10 December 2013\n\nStarring: Will Ferrell, Amy Poehler, John Hedder\n\nDirectors: Will Speck. Josh Gordon\n\nFew better ways of spending a couple of hours (OK we get it)\n\nBlazing Saddles\n\n1974 Mark: 9.7\n\nWatched: Mon 5 September 2016\n\nStarring: Cleavon Little, Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks, Slim Pickens, Alex Karras, David Huddleston, Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Count Basie\n\nDirector: Mel Brooks\n\nHow many times have I seen this? If you told me half a dozen I would believe you, but it must be 15 years since I dug it out, and boy oh boy, I'm glad I did! I would not go so far as to say there is not a single moment wasted, but the majority of the film is a joyful torrent of loopy, obvious, yet extraordinarily prescient irreverence, like 48 Hrs providing the dialogue for my lifetime.\n\nIf I was picking a film icon to combat racism Virgil Tibbs and Solomon Northrup would, IMHO, be playing second fiddle to Sheriff Bart - I mean Where all de white women at?\n\nBleed For This\n\n2016 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Tue 6 December 2016\n\nStarring: Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart, Katey Sagal, Ciarán Hinds, Ted Levine\n\nDirector: Ben Younger\n\nSpoiler alert. Boxing film. OK, now that's out of the way, it's not going to put you on the canvas with surprises, but hell, it's a good story, and in this instance it is done quite excellently, with the lush ingredients of three great acting performances, I just can't choose between the solidity of Aran Eckart's Tony Soprano and Ciarán Hinds doing Peter Griffin, but I hope one of them at least gets a nod. Miles Teller is now, officially, a good actor, all added too a 'true' story which never really clags up at all, yet still surprised me.\n\nBlue Ruin\n\n2013 Mark: 6.9\n\nWatched: Wed 16 November 2016\n\nStarring: Macon Blair\n\nDirector: Jeremy Saulnier\n\nWhilst lacking originality of premise (SPOLER ALERT: Underdog story), this film runs with it in a brave delivery incorporating very little dialogue and genuinely clever filming. Incredibly it was made for $420,000 from crowd-funding, and it doubled its money - and deserved it. I can see some people really liking this.\n\nThe Blues Brothers\n\n1980 Mark: 10\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Dan Aykroyd, John Bulushi, John Candy, Steven Spielberg, Carrie Fisher\n\nDirector: John Landis\n\nMy favourite film  ever. Why? Apart from being a brilliantly conceived vehicle for a load of songs, I reckon it was in the right place at the right time for me. John Landis is always very dry with his comedy, angular and dark with the shots, I dunno. Years ago I voted to get it for a college period and it made a change from the pornos and horror. I thought I would like it and it came through. Dan Aykroyd has made a succession of superb comedies, Trading Places, Dragnet, Spies Like Us, Ghostbusters, all of them exhibiting his unique deadpan style and his lucid writing. Jon Buck once summed how good Otis Redding was \"If he'd have been alive, he'd have been in The Blues Brothers \"\n\nThat also indicates how good this film is. Not a frame wasted.\n\nThe Boat That Rocked\n\n2009 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Mon 11 July 2011\n\nStarring: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Mark Addy, Rhys Evans, Chris O'Dowd, Gemma Artuton, Emma Thompson, Kenneth Brannagh, Jack Davenport\n\nDirector: Richard Curtis\n\nReasonably entertaining, but I must admit I found the foppish teen and the lack of factual continuity a little annoying, but that is just me. It could have been a TV series (Richard Curtis was the director) A good film for a UK/US connections.\n\nAlmost Famous (foppish Teen, Philip Seymour Hoffman) comes out 1.5 points in front as a piece of theatre about the music of our youth. It crosses over and is still relevant today, whereas TBTR is just a yarn.\n\nThe Bone Collector\n\n1999 Mark: 4.9\n\nWatched: Mon 28 September 2015\n\nStarring: Denzill Washinton, Angelina Jolie, Queen Latifah, Luis Guzmán, Bobby Cannavale, Ed O'Neill\n\nDirector: Phillip Noyce\n\nAt the pictures I may have stayed to the end. On a DVD I just thought I had better things to do than watch Angelina say \" I can't do it \" and Denzel Washington saying \" Yes you can \".\n\nThe thing is, like loads of thriller/horror movies it goes tits up in that the protagonists do incredibly stupid things which given they are, in Angelina's case.... oh it's just that whole kid calls in a dead body on a train track so they send a single female alone to investigate it, who compounds the bad practice by not calling it in the moment she confirms it is for real. I went and did something else after about three quarters of an hour, can someone tell me how it ends?\n\nBone Tomahawk\n\n2015 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Fri 3 February 2017\n\nStarring: Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, Lili Simmons, David Arquette, Sid Haig, Sean Young\n\nDirector: S. Craig Zahler\n\nKurt Russell is a great 'old' actor, he could easily have been in the Magnificent 7 remake, and in this he takes a faintly ridiculous premise and runs with it to deliver an enjoyable slice of hokum along with some spectacular gore. I couldn't watch something like this every night, but once a fortnight it provides some mindless relief.\n\nBook Of Eli\n\n2010 Mark: 5\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Denzill Washinton, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Jennifer Beals\n\nDirector: Albert and Allen Hughes\n\nI'm not sure that this one suspended my disbelief enough. I'm not sure that I like the message. I'm not sure that Denzel hasn't been a lot better served in many other films.\n\nThe Book Thief\n\n2014 Mark: 8.5\n\nWatched: Thu 20 March 2014\n\nStarring: Sophie Nélisse, Emily Watson, Geoffrey Rush, Roger Allam, Ben Schnetzer\n\nDirector: Brian Percival\n\nI've took this off 9 to put on 8.5. Its a close thing and I'm filled with angst about doing that. I am sure it would be many people's 10.\n\nIt is rare to get a film that does not stereotype groups of people (just watch Twelve Years A Slave, If Brad Pitt hadn't bought into it, the whole of White America were all bastards). Spoiler alert. This film shows many Germans during the second world war in a thoroughly convincing sympathetic light, and is consequently most uplifting despite.... 'nuff said. Could this be an all time young actress nomination? Beautiful film.\n\nN.b. The critics of this film, and they are numerous, invariable latch upon the kindness portrayed in it. I am sure they would be much happier if all Germans were goose stepping Jew Baiters (and this film has it's share of them), and I would bet my house they spunked buckets over 12 years . There is nobody as cynical as myself as to the shortcomings of humanity, nevertheless I do harbour hope in some innate goodness. Ask yourself, what would happen now. I know that 11 out of 12 teachers would either not do anything or positively side with their superior when witness to that superior doing something very demonstrably wrong. But I do know that for these 11 there might be one non teacher who would stand up and point it out. Bitch.\n\nThe Boxtrolls\n\n2014 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Sun 14 September 2014\n\nStarring: Elle Fanning, Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Ben Kingsley, Toni Collette, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, Tracy Morgan\n\nDirector: Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi\n\nThis was a magnificent piece of animation, like Julia said, every single stop motion frame is a labour of true love and great art. How can people really identify with this film, as it's main thrust is what dicks gen pops can be in the face of ismisms, yet AFAIK most people are like that. If they all agree somethings bad, somethings bad, and no amount of evidence will change that paradigm. Change must come through the barrel of a gun?. Loved the end credits...\n\nBoyhood\n\n2014 Mark: 6\n\nWatched: Tue 16 September 2014\n\nStarring: Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke\n\nDirector: Richard Linklater\n\nGulp! After being blown away by Pride I went to have a look at the prices with William Hills for the Oscars and noticed that this was favourite to win at 9/4. Naturally I downloaded it and must admit, that I was reasonably absorbed, for the first 90 minutes, but I just didnt get it. It wound down and down and I was looking to see how long there was to go. Please please somebody tell me what I was. I mean a reasonable concept, but this was meant to be a fiction, therefore it could have been done with different actors and make up. I have seen the 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but come on, what do we take away from it? I feel like such a philistine, but I just supposed something was going to happen. Watch This Boys Life for a more satisfying version of the same story, watch 7 Up etc. for reality.\n\nBram Stoker's Dracula\n\n1992 Mark: 4\n\nWatched: Fri 6 November 2015\n\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Richard E. Grant, Sadie Frost, Tom Waits\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nI only needed 30 minutes to realise this wasn't my cup of tea. I read that it wasn't camp. Say what? The only remarkable thing about this film that I saw was how Sadie Frost looked like Jessica Chastaine. And the titties, of course. \"Not camp\"... Yeah right.\n\nBrave ‡O (animated)\n\n2012 Mark: 8\n\nWatched:\n\nStarring: Kelly McDonald, Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, Craig Ferguson\n\nDirectors: Brenda Chapman, Mark Andrews\n\nJust a great cartoon.\n\nBraveheart ‡O\n\n1995 Mark: 9\n\nWatched: Thu 1 December 2016\n\nStarring: Mel Gibson\n\nDirector: Mel Gibson\n\nMakes you want to identify with Andy Murray. Glen Nevis, the setting for this film, has provided one of the most surprising and beautiful walks in my life of many walks. On a re-watch, I was not disappointed, Mel Gibson tells a story and doesn't get hung up on details of accuracy, consequently entertainment is the order of the day!\n\nBrazil\n\n1985 Mark: 6.5\n\nWatched: Wed 9 November 2016\n\nStarring: Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Richardson, Terry Gilliam, Jim Broadbent, Bryan Pringle, Derek Deadman, Nigel Planer, Gorden Kaye\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\n\nI didn't watch all this film. Again, not because it was a terrible film to sit through, just that I was tired, I thought I 'got it' and there would not be anything more to get. The running joke was done already in 1984, and I must admit, for its datedness, deliberate or accidental it had a degree of prescience in reflecting society. Perhaps any film that, SPOILER ALERT, illustrates the spectrum of human behaviours regarding adherence and application of authority (Repo Men, which I watched a couple of days ago was the same) does not require a sci-fi setting of a dark future, perhaps I should look into ancient literature which discusses the topic. I guess the longer such works have been around the more likely they are to get censored, especially if contemporaneously set and based on fact rather than fiction\n\nBreathe In\n\n2013 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Wed 16 November 2016\n\nStarring: Guy Pearce, Felicity Jones, Amy Ryan, Mackenzie Davis\n\nDirector: Drake Doremus\n\nThere was a brief moment when I toyed with abandoning this, but I thought to myself that it actually hadn't done anything wrong, and though the trials and tribulations of really well off Americans and fading marital relationships are in my bottom three favourite topics (horror is a long way out on its own in the pit), I was actually quite engrossed. The thing is, there was one scene where Megan and Lauren met and were talking and straight away I thought it was ad-libbed, and it was poorly done. It was, and it was. Drake Doremus, the director, does his films that way, but this had enough of a story to overcome those few little hiccups. Particularly strong character painting meant that I was moderately interested in Lauren and fascinated by the other three to the extent that once I'd committed to the film, the more it went on the more I didn't regret staying with it. I'd agree with those who say Guy Pierce has his finest film here.\n\nBridge Of Spies\n\n2015 Mark: 9.2\n\nWatched: Tue 24 November 2015\n\nStarring: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance‡O, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda, Jesse Plemons, Domenick Lombardozzi\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nOne of the best films of 2015, which of course will doom you to disappointment if you haven't seen it yet. Steven Spielberg is good, Tom Hanks is good, Mark Rylance is good, the history is good, the story is good, the characters are good, the filming is good, and the music is good. That is what I would term erring on the conservative. I have never had an insight into what Berlin was like when I was little, or the relationships between East Germany, the USSR and the USA at that time, but I am sure this gets close, not only holding up some ideas, but couching them in a fist pumping yarn that grows with every five minutes. Mark Rylance at his most Cromwellesque for the best supporting actor. No Brainer..\n\nN.b. We didn't need to be told what bridges we were looking at and we didn't need to be told how thoroughly great America is compared to the East to the extent including that when it is sunny spring in New York it is deepest winter in Berlin\n\nBridge On The River Kwai ‡O\n\n1957 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Fri 7 August 2015\n\nStarring: Alec Guinness‡O, Jack Hawkins, William Holden\n\nDirector: David Lean\n\nYeah, this deserves the accolades. Very old school British, but with the breadth of Cinemascope and David Lean's ambition, it was fading a little with the William Holden scenes, but a superb monologue (when Col Nicholson was talking on the bridge) provided brilliant insight and teed up a fantastic last scene\n\nA Bridge Too Far\n\n1977 Mark: 8\n\nWatched: Fri 28 March 2014\n\nStarring: Sean Connery, Dirk Bogarde, Ryan O'Neal, James Caan, Michael Caine, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Hardy Krüger, Laurence Olivier, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell, Alun Armstrong, Liv Ullmann\n\nDirector: Richard Attenborough\n\nThis scores 5 on the cast alone! Combining a stellar line up with a great, true, story, terrific score, we will forgive its clichés (which flow thick and fast throughout the duration) and appreciate that, at least, not all Germans are all bad, and not all allies are all good. (There is a pretty strong pull in that direction though). I think this may be the longest 'Also Starring' list. Why did I put Sean Connery at the front? Why not?, he was the character I most enjoyed.\n\nBridget Jones's Baby\n\n2016 Mark: 4.6\n\nWatched: Tue 20 September 2016\n\nStarring: Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, Patrick Dempsey, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Emma Thompson\n\nDirector: Sharon Maguire\n\nI can't really review this objectively, because it is so not my cup of tea. I am 58 and well past my sell by date, Jeezus I'm past my give away to charity date, and this kind of film, with it's ironic humour about old people in a similar situation that actually find themselves above it just, quite frankly, annoys me. The festival scenes were why I hate festivals, the London scenes were what totally turns me off about London, full of self centred, not particularly clever, egotists who make you feel great but basically don't really give a fuck about you. I like René Zellweger and Colin Firth, I love Studio Canal, but the humour was yawningly repetitive, just in case you didn't get it, and the music just paled compared to Hell and High Water (which I watched beforehand); it was perhaps the most boring soundtrack I have ever come across. House of Pain were passé two decades ago. Now it is whored out as just a sad unamusing lip-synch that maybe still puzzles some of the Ken Bruce listeners in the audience but had me leaving my shoes on ready for a quick getaway. For crying out loud, old people have plenty to offer in terms of experience, but only if they have wisdom in the first place. I am proud of what I am, but hopefully realistic. For fuck's sake you boring old farts, grow old with dignity!\n\nPS, SPOLIER ALERT. Hugh Grant is not dead (but that might as well have been written in Neon Lights during the church scene) (and I walked out after half an hour so did not read the newspaper clip, which I have just this moment looked up, before this bracketed sentence).\n\nBrokeback Mountain ‡V\n\n2005 Mark: 7.5\n\nWatched: Thu 15 December 2016\n\nStarring: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaa, Randy Quaid, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Kate Mara\n\nDirector: Ang Lee\n\nA very good film. I can't pretend that I found it some of it that comfortable to watch, but this is the kind of film I talk about when I say I want movies to make me a better, more understanding person. That part of Canada is always a good place to go, but the story and two protagonists were completely solid, Heath Leger and Jake Gillenhall were brilliant in this, and I guess I should have watched it many years ago.\n\nBroken Arrow\n\n1950 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Wed 17 February 2016\n\nStarring: James Stewart, Jeff Chandler, Debra Paget, Basil Ruysdael, Will Geer, Jay Silverheels\n\nDirector: Delmer Daves\n\nI've always liked James Stuart, and this film exemplifies why. It is most definitely dated, but not in way that makes you think people were stupid who made it. A little over-idealistic perhaps, but its heart, I think, is in the right place. Apart from that it looks good, tells well, and you just gotta like Jimmy. One most curious think was revealed to me on a personal level during this film. I thought I had not seen it before this watching in February 2016, but there was just one line, not the scene, just the line, about rubbing food grease on your arm, which made me realise I have seen it. Great - I'll be able to watch The Blues Brothers again soon, and consider it fresh.\n\nN.B. No wonder it's dated - I have just looked it up - 1950 - this was at the heart of America's worst period in film making, the McCarthy Era, when to make a message film was to lose your job. It won a Golden Globe, and I can well see why. I am not going to change my enjoyment rating (which is good), but it does fall into that bracket of films which, all things considered, are probably better than my quotient suggests. So much better than From here To Eternity\n\nN.B.#2: James Stewart was 42, Debra Paget was 16!\n\nBroken City\n\n2013 Mark: 7.1\n\nWatched: Sun 20 November 2016\n\nStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Russell Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jeffrey Wright, Barry Pepper, Alona Tal, Natalie Martinez, Michael Beach, Kyle Chandler\n\nDirector: Allen Hughe\n\nI only saw it less than 48 hours ago and it's already fading. There was never a moment whe... For some reason this review dried up right there, and so now, ten days later I am compelled to ponder, there was never a moment when what? Russell Crow does that baddy thing quite- badly? (I'm thinking about Virtuosityhere)\n\nA Bronx Tale\n\n1993 Mark: 9.6\n\nWatched: Mon 8 June 2015\n\nStarring: Lillo Brancato Jr., Robert De Niro, Chazz Palminteri, Francis Capra, Kathrine Narducci, Rosina Anello, Taral Hicks, Joe Pesci\n\nDirector: Robert De Nero\n\nA beautiful (and I don't use that word lightly), mob movie. OK, there is no mention of the Mafia, but these are stand up guys, with nicknames and hair and attitude and accents. I don't want to go into details, but I found this film pressed the same buttons as This Is England and End Of Watch . They would really make a magnificent trilogy, exploring human nature from very different sides of the fence and pond.\n\nOne can not know the contribution that people make to stories, but if I had to pick one name from the thousands on this page as having made the greatest percentage contribution to an awesome film it would be Chazz Palminteri with this one (read the background). The more I think about this the more it makes me realise how I love my kids (That's not particularly to do with the text of the film, it is just inspirational). Kudos to Robert De Nero too, for making the best gangster movie ever (and wow, there are some good ones).\n\nBrooklyn\n\n2015 Mark: 7.8\n\nWatched: Fri 15 January 2016\n\nStarring: Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters\n\nDirector: John Crowley\n\nPart of a pair of films I saw in the same afternoon, both with a slew of Oscar nominations, both of them hugely enjoyable watches, getting exactly the same thrill quotient from me, but both very different (see Creed for the other)\n\nSaoirse Ronan is an absolute delight to the senses, and didn't this film frame her well? (I hope she gets the gong). It was nice to see Jim Broadbent taking some real decency back for priests. I went to a boarding school run by priests, and my housemaster, Tom Lyons, was as good a bloke as I have ever met, and I never got touched up by any of them. The dinner table scenes with Julie Walters were absolutely hilarious, and the Mrs Irish Baddy was Rachedesque!\n\nSPOILER ALERT....\n\nI wonder if anybody else thinks \"Jeez, pet, he is far too good for you?\". Take the girlfriend, she'll love it.\n\nBull Durham\n\n1988 Mark: 6.1\n\nWatched: Wed 19 October 2016\n\nStarring: Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Trey Wilson, Robert Wuhl\n\nDirector: Ron Shelton\n\nGiven this rates so highly in the IMDB Kevin Costner list it ended up being a bit of a let down. For me it is not in his top three baseball films, let alone the full cannon. It had its amusement quotient, the cast were reasonable, but I'm sorry, I didn't like the Susan Sarandon part and I hardly found it believable. Tim Robbins was half way to The Hudsucker Proxy, and Costner was overlapping a little into the red on the too good to be true scale. The last 25 minutes was truly tedious, but I am reliably informed that this is what gets the women's vote to pump it up the lists. My advice is, if you want a baseball film watch Moneyball and Field Of Dreams. Skip the last half hour on this, apart from the new haircut Tim Robbins interview that lasts perhaps a minute.\n\nGiven everybody else's love of this film it plumps fairly and squarely into the 'What do I know?' bracket\n\nBullet To The Head\n\n2012 Mark: 7.2\n\nWatched: Sat 1 April 2017\n\nStarring: Sylvester Stallone, Sung Kang, Sarah Shahi, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Christian Slater, Jason Momoa\n\nDirector: Walter Hill\n\nI like Walter Hill films! This has been criticised as derivative of Walter Hill's and Sylvester Stallone's past work; like that's even a bad thing! OK the film starts as a good, intelligent, but slightly naive cop crosses paths with a gnarly old hit man who has 'his rules'. SPOLER ALERT: Work out the rest yourself! Tremendous fun, nothing groundbreaking, good sets, corny action and dialogue, but very solid if you like this kind of thing. Humour. It has humour.\n\nBurnt\n\n2015 Mark: 5\n\nWatched: Thu 12 November 2015\n\nStarring: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Omar Sy, Daniel Brühl, Matthew Rhys, Alicia Vikander, Uma Thurman and Emma Thompson\n\nDirector: John Wells\n\nThis is the first film I have left early which I have rated more than 5. The thing is, it was nice looking, super cast, but it really isn't my cup of tea, like Southpaw for cooks, it just didn't look like it was ever going to be anything more than a comeback story with lots of pictures of pieces of lettuce which Bradley Cooper had jizzed on. What nailed the walk out (apart from the Top House Quiz) was a meeting in a Burger King (after said shop had featured very obviously in a previous scene) and Cooper delivering a monologue about how the food there was somehow like French traditional food. It was an insult to the viewers intelligence. If you want Bradley Cooper watch Silver Linings Playbook . If you want foodie, I found Chef far more entertaining. And sports stories are just so much more... manly?\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\n1969 Mark: 8.3\n\nWatched: Fri 6 February 2015\n\nStarring: Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross, Strother Martin, Jeff Corey, Henry Jones, Sam Elliot\n\nDirector: George Roy Hill\n\nI must've seen this film at least four times, and I do love it, or at least large bits of it. It is a real buddy movie, and probably introduced me to the genre, some of the lines are classics, the chemistry is terrific, the humour works, the places are beautiful. Perhaps writing these have jaded me, because I thought I would give it a ten. I know why I haven't. The first half is terrific, the second half average, the stills segment seems a little like an interlude, and just the idea of a super cool posse tracking you across hundreds of miles of the wild west and just never quite catching you... It just wore a bit thin. Great movie though, I just think I may be a little disappointed that I enjoyed Pitch Perfect 2 more.\n\nThe Butler\n\n2013 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Sun 17 November 2013\n\nStarring: Forest Whitakker, Oprah Winfrey, John Cusack, Jane Fonda, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Terrence Howard, Lenny Kravitz, James Marsden, David Oyelowo, Vanessa Redgrave, Alan Rickman, Liev Schreiber, Robin Williams, Clarence Williams III\n\nDirector: Lee Daniels\n\nGreat film for quiz buffs in that it gives a historical insight into a lot of the post-war American presidents. A tableau!\n\nCaddyshack\n\n1980 Mark: 4.6\n\nWatched: Sat 12 November 2016\n\nStarring: Michael O'Keefe, Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Bill Murray\n\nDirector: Harold Ramis\n\nMaybe in the top ten over-rated films of all time it \"met with generally poor reviews upon its original 1980 release\". The best quote the suits can dig up for their Wikipedia hack is something from an on-line blogger. The thing is, The Sun is the most popular paper, MacDonald's is busy, Bernie Sanders was not given the Democrat nomination and people buy records by Westlife. If you want to know the faults of democracy just talk with the average bloke for five minutes. Even Harold Ramis, who, lest we forget, gave us Groundhog Day says he \"can barely watch it. All I see are a bunch of compromises and things that could have been better\". I feel like marking it down for insulting my intelligence, like Ghostbusters 2016. I sat through it just for the reference, but the most enjoyable things were the food, the wine and the company. It, thankfully, stopped short of making me painfully uncomfortable.\n\nAs for the film, the acting was poor, the dames were unattractive, the animatronics were pathetic, Chevy Chase is rarely funny, Bill Murray was frankly annoying, The sex was unbelievable (not in a nice way), the continuity and goofs were numerous, the story was what? and there was perhaps only one character in whom I had a moderate interest (Ted Knight as Judge Elihu Smails), all jumbled along by a cast who lurched from 80s camp to incessantly annoying. I want to say \"ah well, each to their own\", but fundamentally this is just poorly made in all departments and if you like it you will probably love Martin and Lewis and Leslie Nielsen's golf film. The Chuckle Brothers are much better, cos at least you don't have sycophantic critics pandering to the great ignorance of idiots who do not understand true humour. For fuck's sake watch a Will Ferrell film instead.\n\nCalvary\n\n2014 Mark: 7\n\nWatched: Tue 31 March 2015\n\nStarring: Brendan Gleeson, Chris O'Dowd, Kelly Reilly, Aidan Gillen, Dylan Moran, Isaach de Bankolé\n\nDirector: John Michael McDonagh\n\nDidn't quite get the story here, I mean, there was this thread, but perhaps it deliberately left some of the profiling to ones imagination. Brendan Gleeson absolutely lights up a screen, and the host of support actors do not displease the eye. If I had seen this before Cuban Fury I might not have liked Chris O'Dowd's part, but now.. hey, he's OK. This is like Father Ted  The Dark Side and is worth watching for the whole look and feel of it, but it is kind of "
