        "meta_description": "This paper contributes to the theorization of how Orientalism has evolved after 9/11 and in the first two decades of the twenty-first century. I specifically address the multimediality of films and propose that post-9/11 Orientalism has fragmented into more digestible, more complex micronarratives dispersed throughout the interplay of different media which constitute the film experience. I recur to Foucault’s concept of dispositif to illustrate how any of these media—such as music, screenplay, editing, acting, etc.—may “[enter] into resonance or contradiction with the others” (Foucault 195), ambiguating the film’s politics. When the film’s different media pursue diverging politics, I speak of multimedia dissensus. In order to test this hypothesis, I focus on two films which explicitly champion diversity and aim to reverse the logics of Islamophobia by presenting tributes to Muslim culture or denunciations of Eurocentric discriminatory practices: Alejandro Amenábar’s Agora (2009) and Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven (2005). A more detailed analysis of the films’ multimedial complexity, however, shows that they do participate in the Islamophobic discourses that have dominated Hollywood cinema after 9/11.",

        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n3This paper regards multimedia texts, films in particular, through the lens of the Foucauldian dispositif: a formation of discursive or non-discursive, said or unsaid elements that may entertain contradictory relations among each other. The dispositif or apparatus, Foucault clarifies, “is the system of relations that can be established between these elements” (194). This paper focuses on the nature of these relations and offers an analysis of films as structures composed of heterogeneous media—such as music, screenplay, editing, acting, etc.—in which one of these “enters into resonance or contradiction with the others” (Foucault 195), ambiguating the film’s politics. When the film’s different media pursue diverging politics, I speak of multimedia dissensus. While Foucault’s dispositif strives to level its discrepancies through “a re-adjustment or a re-working of the heterogeneous elements” via “a perpetual process of strategic elaboration” (195), the ambiguous politics of the films analyzed in this paper remain unresolved.\n\n2. Proto-Christian Terror in Agora\n\n8This view of Agora as a mirror of Christian values is easily confuted by looking at the overlay text before the end credits, which explains that, after mandating Hypatia’s murder as well as violence against Alexandria’s Jews, the early Christian pope Cyril of Alexandria was declared a saint and father of the church (“Posteriormente, Cirilo fue declarado santo y doctor de la Iglesia”). The film’s unsympathetic portrayal of Cyril and the endnote on his role in Christian hagiography is meant to shock and outrage. Most importantly, the Christians whose “good side” Amenábar claims to show are the fundamentalists he critiques. This “little known religion,” as the film describes it, represents Alexandria’s lower classes, “the lepers and the poor,” and is devoted to improving their condition, but is also a constant threat to the city’s Hellenistic majority and its Jewish community. Thus, Amenábar’s statement outlines the ambiguity at the core of the film and foreshadows its inner dissensus.\n\n3. ‘New World’ Encounters: Kingdom of Heaven\n\n12Kingdom of Heaven is a fitting representative of post 9/11 aesthetics as theorized by Holsinger and of the centrality of the crusade rhetoric for the 9/11 premodern, as “9/11 rendered visible a dualist medievalism of crusade and Samuel P. Huntington’s ‘clash of civilizations’” (Holsinger 472). Sharon Waxman of the New York Times summarizes the centrality of the crusade imaginary to post 9/11 discourse as follows:\n\nPresident Bush initially called the war on terror a ‘crusade’ after the 9/11 attacks but was criticized by some for using a term that has long had anti-Muslim overtones. Meanwhile, some Islamic experts who analyzed Osama bin Laden’s motives after 9/11 suggested that he was trying to cast himself as a modern-day Saladin. And Saladin’s name was invoked by Saddam Hussein’s government to rally Muslims against the American-led invasion of Iraq. (Waxman)\n\nThere is no escaping the parallels with our time…. We set out to tell a terrific story from a supremely dramatic age—not to make a documentary and propagandize. But since our subject is the clash of these two civilizations, and we are now living in the post-9/11 world, Kingdom of Heaven will invariably be looked at from that perspective. (Scott in Burt)\n\n14Scott was correct in anticipating that the crusade theme through the prism of 9/11 would inevitably be a dominant motif in commentaries and reviews. Many, however, did not see the parallel as coincidental. Some commented on the “odd timing” of this “big-budget Hollywood epic depicting the ferocious fight between Christians and Muslims” (Waxman).\n\n16The film’s non-stereotypical representation of Saladin did not go unnoticed and attracted a good deal of criticism. British crusade scholar Jonathan Riley-Smith described the film as “complete and utter nonsense…, the Muslims as sophisticated and civilized, and the Crusaders are all brutes and barbarians. It has nothing to do with reality” (in Edwardes). Riley-Smith’s unkind summary does justice to the film’s polarizations: like Agora, Kingdom of Heaven is unambiguously critical of Christianity in evoking a historical dimension in which the “jihadists” were Christian. In addition to that, Christendom is a corrupt universe: in the best-case scenario Christians are disillusioned, beaten, and father multiple illegitimate children they later abandon. In the worst, they are vulgar, capricious, power-hungry, and strategically incompetent. The templars, like the parabolani in Agora, are a terrorist religious militia gladly resorting to unjustified violence and gratuitous murder. “There is so much in Christendom,” says a laconic bishop, “of which Christ would be incapable” (Kingdom). To the contrary, Muslims are honorable, devout, decent, and peaceful. A generous Saladin offers Christians safe passage out of newly conquered Jerusalem and respectfully puts a fallen cross back to its place. These choices have generated clear responses by critics and scholars: Richards, for example, states that Kingdom of Heaven points to an “impeccably liberal” moral that prefers tolerance to war, reason to fanaticism, kindness to hate, integrity to profit (25).\n\n17The soundtrack to Kingdom of Heaven by Harry Gregson-Williams further underscores the film’s careful avoidance of stereotypical representations and its strive towards a balanced perspective. A BBC reviewer praises Gregson-Williams for his attention to “authenticity” and the balancing of diverse music traditions (Reavley). According to this review, the film captures the cultural tension between East and West by juxtaposing and awarding equal complexity to the two musical landscapes. Christian devotional music alternates with “gaudy Arab dances and searing laments” (Reavley). The use of little-known instruments to Western audiences, such as the kanoon or the kamancha, Arab soloist features, and musicians from Istanbul concur to create a “modicum of authenticity” (Reavley). “Authentic” is a word that recurs in another British soundtrack reviewer, who, although being generally unimpressed, admits that the soundtrack is “nothing if not authentic” (Broxton).\n\n18Despite all, in an interview with The New York Times, Islamic law scholar Khaled Abou El Fadl calls the screenplay offensive, insists that “the movie teaches people to hate Muslims,” and claims that it perpetuates classic Orientalist stereotypes of Muslims as “stupid, retarded, backward, unable to think in complex forms” (Abou El Fadl in Waxman). Although Kingdom of Heaven does walk a road paved with good intentions, these points are legitimate. Agora’s Christian masses, ragged and disorderly, stand no chance against the elegance of the “pagan” upper classes, and the spectator’s sympathies are decidedly directed towards the latter. This is unsurprising, since Alexandria’s Christians are invariably the target of disparaging representations and the pagans of celebratory ones. Kingdom of Heaven, too, has its unruly Christians and Muslim peasants, but it abounds with celebratory representations of both cultures. In other words, what happens when Kingdom of Heaven’s noble Muslims are confronted with the film’s Christian hero, Balian?\n\n19When Balian (Orlando Bloom) is washed up on the Palestinian coast after a shipwreck, he stumbles through the desert in search of Jerusalem. As he pauses to drink from a spring, he chances upon Imad (Alexander Siddig), one of Saladin’s officers, and his servant. Being in a jocular mood, Imad claims Balian’s horse is his and fights him for it; Balian would rather keep his horse but is reticent to draw the sword. Imad, exchanging roles with his servant to trick Balian, pretends to translate his “master’s” Arabic:\n\n[Imad] ‘He says this is his horse.’\n\n[Balian] ‘Why would it be his horse?’\n\n[Imad] ‘Because it’s on his land!’\n\n[Balian] ‘I took this horse from the sea.’\n\n….\n\n[Imad] ‘He says you are a great liar. He will fight you because you are a liar.\n\n[Balian] ‘I have no desire to fight.’\n\n[Imad] ‘Then you must give him the horse.’\n\n(Kingdom)\n\n20Richards argues that “the desert encounter between Western hero and Saracen” yields “mutual respect” (29), but this reading can be significantly complicated. This scene is reminiscent—perhaps a quotation—of David Lean’s 1962 Lawrence of Arabia, when Omar Sharif’s character Ali is first introduced. Both characters tease their distressed white interlocutors, Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven and Peter O’Toole in Lawrence. Ali claims he owns the well, Imad the horse. Both scenes introduce prominent Muslim characters played by equally prominent actors of color: Imad is played by Alexander Siddig, a Sudanese-British actor well known to Western audiences due to his roles in Syriana (2005), Reign of Fire (2002), and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993-1999). Yet, in Kingdom of Heaven, the Muslim lord is portrayed as capricious and cruel, forcing his servant to fight for his entertainment—and die in the process, although that was not part of Imad’s plan. When Balian wins the unnecessary duel Imad initiated, he shows mercy and refuses to make his defeated opponent a slave, as it would be customary in the Muslim universe he is entering. Balian’s choice to opt out of slavery places him on a higher moral ground than his opponent and sets the moral standard for Christianity. Balian’s flawless chivalry dilutes the potential for self-scrutiny found in Kingdom of Heaven’s depraved Christians, whom one easily dismisses as marginal representatives of their civilization. The same cannot be said for Imad, who, as likeable as he may become in the course of the film, is also the ambassador of dubious ethics and his first appearance does little else but setting the stage for Balian’s display of moral superiority.\n\n21Princess Sibylla (Eva Green) provides another example of the film’s predilection for Christian ethics. Watching Muslims during their morning prayers, she tells Balian that “they try to be one. One heart. One morality. Their prophet says ‘submit.’ Jesus says ‘decide’” (Kingdom). Sibylla didactically elaborates on how Christianity champions individual freedom, while Islam insists on abnegation and submission to a monolithic (“one”) morality. Her statements remain uncontested. Under the guise of presenting a critique of Christianity as a cultural universe in crisis due to individuals who twist religious ideas to serve their own ends, the film actually redeems it via its noblest and most righteous exponents. Conversely, the premodern violence of noblest and most righteous Muslims remains unredeemed.\n\n23As Imad’s violence is a reflection of his master’s, so are his intelligence and nobility. Isolated accidents aside, Scott’s Saladin is a practical, rational, and morally upright leader. What debilitates the film’s pro-Muslim stance, however, is that Saladin remains the enlightened exception in an ocean of fanatics. The following dialogue, where an officer questions Saladin’s military strategy, will clarify this point.\n\n[Mullah] ‘Why did we retire? Why? God did not favor him, God alone determines the result of battles.’\n\n[Saladin] ‘The results of battles are determined by God, but also by preparation, numbers, the absence of disease, the availability of water. One cannot maintain a siege with the enemy behind. How many battles did God win for the Muslims before I came. That is, before God determined that I should come.’\n\n[Mullah] ‘Few enough. That’s because we were sinful.’\n\n[Saladin] ‘It is because you were unprepared.’\n\n[Mullah] ‘If you think like that, you shall not be king for long.’\n\n(Kingdom)\n\n24The scene exposes the dichotomy between Saladin’s enlightened rationalism and his officer’s faith in divine providence. Saladin’s argument fits comfortably in an American discourse of self-reliance—which is an important point and will be returned to later—that does not encounter the officer’s favor, and he predicts that, holding such views, Saladin “shall not be king for long.” This implies that Saladin stands alone in his rationalism and is not representative of his culture. If Saladin is an exception, one may argue, so is Balian on the Christian side: they are both celebrated as remarkable leaders ahead of their time. Yet, their exceptionality leads into opposite directions and contradictory conclusions. If Balian is Christianity’s chance for redemption, this is not true for Saladin and Islam. If the former is allowed to multiply and transform, we leave the latter to the ominous threats of his officers.\n\n26After returning from Jerusalem, Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson), is travelling through the French winter when he finds his illegitimate son Balian, a blacksmith in a village where the land is frozen and blueish. Godfrey invites Balian to leave behind the memory of his aborted infant and suicide wife and follow him to “a New World,” where one becomes “not what you are born but what you have in yourself to be… a better world that has ever been seen. A kingdom of conscience. A kingdom of heaven,” where, he also adds, “there is peace between Christian and Muslim. We can live together” (Kingdom). Godfrey’s words resonate with Thomas Paine’s “The Rights of Man,” describing America as a place where “all the parts are brought into cordial unison. There the poor are not oppressed, the rich are not privileged. Industry is not mortified by the splendid extravagance of a court rioting at its expense.” The Holy Land as “New World” captures an array of American foundational stories: from New Canaan and New Jerusalem to the rags to riches trope, the rise of the moral and hard-working, the desire to found a purified community, and, most importantly for the purposes of this study, the narrative of multiculturalism or religious coexistence, in line with the interreligious impetus of the film. Both “New Worlds” are geopolitical spaces as much as imagined geographies: The Baron of Ibelin’s Jerusalem is, as Richards puts it, “an idealised version of the USA” (Richards 26), a reverse projection of Islamophobic America with the possibility of interreligious tolerance at its core. This coalescence of “New Worlds” is remarkable in so far as it is also reminiscent of the mechanism at the basis of Orientalism, where the East is “imagined and constructed by the West relationally to its own identity” (Lau & Mendes 80).\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n28As my analysis tried to show, the multimedial dissensus at the heart of these two films makes them reluctantly complicit in upholding Islamophobic discourses. This argument works with the assumption that a film is a dispositif constituted of different media, in which two or more of these may enter into contradiction with one another (see Foucault), generating multimedia dissensus and ambiguity. Contrary to Agora, where the critical potential of the screenplay was diluted by casting choices, Kingdom of Heaven’s casting choices and music tend towards fairness but are ambiguated by conservative moments in the screenplay. I recognize that branding these films as Islamophobic may appear dismissive of their conspicuous attempts to offer nuanced readings of cultural conflicts and educated historical parallels. As the film and television industry strives to move away from explicit stereotyping as a consequence of awareness movements such as Black Lives Matter, Me Too, and Oscars So White, racism and Orientalism have unavoidably reformulated themselves into “more enlightened form[s]” (Alsultany 15). The return to premodern societies, with their premodern class and race hierarchies, may offer a pretext to unravel normative scenarios of female subservience and culture clashes under the illusory premises of “safe distance.” Even in these cases, however, films and television embrace Orientalist, racist, and chauvinist tropes with an ancillary reluctance that needs to be thoroughly investigated. In these pages I exposed in-text dissensus—a coalescence of contradictory politics carried by different media—as one of the forms this reluctance may take."
