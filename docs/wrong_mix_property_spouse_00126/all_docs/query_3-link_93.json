        "text": "By Marc S. Sanders\n\nMax Dugan Returns is one of those delightful films where the smile never leaves your face. It’s a cozy, rainy Saturday afternoon with your favorite pillow and throw blanket. The characters are whimsical, and they simply feel like good, good friends you would love to have in your life.\n\nNora McPhee (Marsha Mason) is an overworked, underpaid high school English teacher who is drowning in debt with a broken refrigerator and a car that is as ugly as it sounds on the road. Her fifteen-year-old son Michael (Matthew Broderick, in a sensational on-screen debut performance) is a good kid, but she’s worried he’s getting too involved with the drug dealers that roam his school.\n\nAfter her jalopy of a car gets stolen, the only positive that comes upon her is in the form of Donald Sutherland as a cop named Brian. After he lends her his motorcycle to get around, there’s an immediate attraction, but it could not happen at a worse time.\n\nNora’s father, Max Dugan (Jason Robards), who abandoned her at age 9 arrives on her doorstep in the middle of a rainy night with a business proposition. Now that his doctors have informed him he has six months to live, he would like to provide Nora and Michael with the six hundred thousand dollars he’s towed with him in an attaché case. In exchange, he only wants to spend time with his grandson. Beyond the animosity she’s held for Max, what alarms Nora is that her father stole this money from a Vegas casino. He claims the mob stole the money from him first. She doesn’t want the money; not with Brian the police officer in her life and she does not want to be affiliated with Max’ criminal past or associations. Not to mention there would no way to explain this sudden windfall based on her minimal teacher’s salary. Max won’t go away so easily, though.\n\nThus, the theme of Max Dugan Returns is one scene after another where a hoard of luxurious items arrive on the McPhee’s doorstep. New appliances, new jewelry, new furnishings, fresh groceries, electronics for Michael, a Mercedes, and a thoroughbred dog named Pluto – I’m sorry. Plato!\n\nIt’s impossible not to love this movie. It is one of the few films that Neil Simon wrote directly for the screen. It is so much fun though, that I think it would work marvelously as a stage play. The story may not be grounded in reality, but Simon’s dialogue is so quick and sharp and a better cast could not be found to deliver Neil Simon’s wit.\n\nMason, Robards, Broderick and Sutherland have pitch perfect chemistry with one another. These actors are so absorbed in their characters, and it makes sense. Matthew Broderick was personally selected by Neil Simon to do his biographical play, Brighton Beach Memoirs. Marsha Mason did five of Simon’s adapted films while she was married to him. (They divorced shortly after the release of this picture in 1983.) Jason Robards has an affectionate gravel to his voice – one of the best voices in film next to James Earl Jones. Robards is just so appealing as he playfully conflicts with Mason on screen while connecting with Broderick’s character under a different identity. It’s important Max maintains a low profile. Donald Sutherland is the straightest character in the picture. He has a relaxed manner to him that’s found often in Neil Simon’s scripts (unless you’re a Nora McPhee or a Felix Unger). In another actor’s hands, this would be just a walk on role, but with Sutherland on screen, you are satisfied to watch another winning performance from this actor with a relaxed stature and a genteel way about him, as his detective suits and ties hang loose on his shoulders.\n\nMax Dugan Returns is an enchanting fantasy without the overt fantasy. It never needed unicorns or lovable elves to deliver its magic and whimsy. I did notice a collection of rainbows – easter eggs hiding in plain sight, however. Are pots of gold to be uncovered? The film asks what would happen if your long-lost father showed up on your doorstep with a suitcase full of money and a treasure trove of gifts to bestow upon you.\n\nHey, it could only happen in the movies.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Miguel E. Rodriguez\n\nDIRECTOR: Frank Capra\n\nCAST: Barbara Stanwyck, Nils Asther, Toshia Mori, Walter Connolly\n\nMY RATING: 10/10\n\nROTTEN TOMATOMETER: 86% Certified Fresh\n\nPLOT: During the Chinese Civil War, an American missionary is gradually seduced by a courtly Chinese warlord holding her captive in Shanghai.\n\nWhen I hear people talking about the “pre-Hays-Code era” of Hollywood, I conjure up seldom-seen images of nearly-nude starlets bathing or swimming or dancing in unison, as filmmakers and studios took advantage of the proven formula: Sex Sells. But it never really occurred to me that some filmmakers would be able to use that freedom to make films that not only showed a little bit of skin, but also took the time to tell a story that appealed to mature adults in ways that seem fresh and alive nearly a century later.\n\nFrank Capra’s The Bitter Tea of General Yen is a contemporary “Beauty-and-the-Beast” tale of an American missionary, Megan (Barbara Stanwyck), who travels halfway around the world to Shanghai to marry her childhood sweetheart, Bob (Gavin Gordon), also a missionary. It’s set in an unspecified year during the Chinese Civil War [1927-1949] when turmoil rocked the city and hundreds of thousands of refugees filled the streets. A remarkable opening shot shows hundreds of extras flowing past the camera as Shanghai burns in the background, while a houseful of Americans prepares for Megan’s wedding, untouched and unbothered by the human misery thirty feet from their doorway. (I was reminded of the idyllic family scenes in Spielberg’s Empire of the Sun where English families held birthday parties oblivious to the impending chaos in Japan leading to World War II.)\n\nBob insists on postponing his wedding to Megan so he can help rescue some orphans stranded in a burning section of the city. During the rescue effort, they are separated; in a surprisingly violent scene, Megan is struck on the head by an angry civilian and is knocked unconscious. She wakes up on a train and finds herself under the care of General Yen (Nils Asther), a famous warlord, reputed to be more bandit than soldier, but who is unfailingly courteous and polite to Megan, even as he informs her that he is unable to return her to Shanghai for security reasons, effectively making her his prisoner.\n\nThis scene on the train is a masterpiece of visual storytelling. Yen sits in a chair and is tended to by Mah-Li (Toshia Mori) who seems to be more than just Yen’s servant. In an unspoken passage, Mah-Li puts a pillow under Yen’s head, covers his legs with a blanket, and reclines on a chaise. Megan, with her head bandaged, observes this ritual, then notices Yen staring intently at her. She becomes acutely aware that she is showing a small patch of bare leg through her covers. As slowly as possible, she gently pulls the covers up to cover her leg. Mah-Li observes all of this, Megan watches Mah-Li, and they all go to sleep, each one of them knowing exactly what has been stated without saying a word. Brilliant.\n\nIn a bold move, once Megan is under Yen’s care/protection/whatever, the film never cuts back to her fiancé or to any of the missionaries. In fact, Yen refers to a Chinese newspaper article which states that Megan is missing and presumed dead. So that takes care of that.\n\nIn another scene of startling violence for its time, Megan wakes up one morning in her private room to the sound of gunfire. Yen’s soldiers are executing prisoners in a courtyard across the way. Megan is horrified and complains to General Yen, who promptly orders the soldiers away: “They are taking the rest of them down the road, out of earshot.” Megan calls him cold-blooded, but he reasonably says he has no rice to feed any prisoners: “…isn’t it better to shoot them quickly than let them starve to death slowly?”\n\nThe theme of the film establishes itself in this and other scenes. Megan, a Christian missionary who believes that people can and must be good for the sake of their souls and their fellow man, finds herself at odds with (and strangely attracted to) a soldier who is brutal by necessity and has no illusions about any innate goodness to be found in any man during a time of war. There is a powerful scene when she argues with Yen, and in a heated moment utters a racial slur, and as soon as she says it Yen goes silent and squints at her, and she realizes she has crossed a line.\n\nThis is not the kind of moral and ethical complexity I expected from a melodrama made only five years after the advent of sound. I saw the name of Frank Capra and the weirdly evocative title, and I imagined a potboiler with outdated attitudes and cheesy dialogue and racial stereotypes galore. I could not have been more wrong. Yes, the title character is played by Nils Asther, a Swedish actor in “yellowface,” but I had to remind myself that, in the time the film was made, this was de rigueur for most films dealing with Asian characters (the highly popular Charlie Chan films starred white actors in the role for years). I don’t endorse the practice, but it is a fact that must be acknowledged. And, it must also be said, Nils Asther’s performance as a Chinese man is quite convincing.\n\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen gives us espionage, intrigue, forbidden romance, high melodrama that teeters on the verge of soap opera but never gives in to that temptation (not like Gone with the Wind would do in 1939 with, let’s face it, a rather similar character arc for the two romantic leads). It’s a film that could be remade today, almost word-for-word, and I have no doubt it would feel right at home with today’s hip audiences. So many other films of that era feel obviously dated by their dialogue or their performances. The Bitter Tea of General Yen suffers none of those drawbacks. It’s a modern classic that just happens to be over 90 years old, that’s all.\n\n[Author’s Note: there is, in fact, one sequence which I’ll call “The Dream Sequence” that feels uncomfortably over-the-top in its depiction of the vilest racial stereotypes associated with Asians. However, given the context of the scene, who’s having the dream, why they’re having it, and the dream’s resolution, it fits perfectly with the story. I can’t find it in myself to “cancel” this film based on this sequence. Just in case anyone was wondering.]\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Marc S. Sanders\n\nI guess Liam Neeson and Gerard Butler were unavailable when Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington collaborated to make the first installment of The Equalizer trilogy, based on the CBS television series that starred Edward Woodward. This film is nothing special with a nothing special kind of script, a nothing special hero and a nothing special collection of Russian Mafia villains. The kills are nothing special either. The action is nothing special. The explosions are nothing special, even when they are started by a trip wired microwave.\n\nRobert McCall (Washington) lives a quiet life by himself, while working at a jumbo home improvement store (think Home Depot or Lowes – big places for lots of not so special action to take place at the conclusion of a not so special movie). Turns out McCall, who also lives with OCD, is a retired special ops commando. Robert uses his down time to read one of a hundred books that should be read before you die, while sitting quietly in a coffee shop each night. He also volunteers his assistance with getting people to improve their lives. A plump co-worker named Ralphie (the go to name for fat guys) played by Johnny Skortis is on Robert’s strict diet regimen to lose enough weight so that he can be promoted to the store’s security guard position. Skortis occupies the best and most interesting character in The Equalizer. During the final action sequence, it’s what Ralphie does that earned my one cheer during the course of the picture.\n\nRobert also becomes acquainted with a young lady named Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz) who has aspirations of becoming a singer but is weighed down by her call girl commitments to members of the Russian mob. When Robert sees that Teri has been beaten and is in serious trouble, he doesn’t wait to be asked for help. He just does what is necessary to even the score.\n\nThat about does it for The Equalizer.\n\nNo. Seriously. That’s all there is to it. And so I’m very disappointed.\n\nFirst, Denzel Washington does not even look like he’s trying. His demeanor to this character is no different than what he did in the lousy Man On Fire, directed by Tony Scott. The script to this film is not challenging in the slightest. Like Man On Fire, The Equalizer is simply a series of scenes where Robert torments his villains. David Harbor is a corrupt Boston cop who gets trapped in his own car, while Robert runs a garden hose from the exhaust pipe to the inside with the engine running. Where is the entertainment in this? Washington sits in a chair while he mechanically opens and closes the car window and Harbor gasps for breath. McCall is inventive with his methods but it does not lend to any story progression or character depth. I guess Robert McCall is an artiste – one who specializes in torment, torture and death.\n\nThe climactic showdown, within the store, is a great set up for some tête-à-tête methodology to happen, but all of it is executed with little interest. Here’s where I asked myself a question. McCall nabs a guy in a makeshift kind of bear trap down aisle 10 (I guess). The thug gets his neck caught in a barb wire noose and up he goes to the second level of pallet platforms for McCall to stare the guy down while the blood squirts out from his throat. There’s four or five heavily armed other guys roaming the store, but McCall can take a break to stare this guy down for his last breaths. If this trap works so well with this one guy, then why not set up six or seven more of these MacGyver contraptions and let each machine gun toting baddie go through the same routine? I know. I know. Miguel would respond, “because then there would be no movie!” Yet, what does that say about The Equalizer that my mind drifts to this idea?\n\nLater in the sequence, McCall easily walks up to another thug from behind and delivers a power drill to the back of his head. Then he puts the drill back on the shelf. Again, if this worked so efficiently and covertly, why not just do it again? And what is so exciting about a power drill anyway if Jason Vorhees isn’t using it?\n\nA nail gun is used a few minutes later and Fuqua opts to just have Washington shoot one nail after another into his opponent. Bang – Nail – Cock! Bang – Nail – Cock! There’s no pun or one liner. There’s just a bad guy who falls to one knee, then an arm goes down. The machine gun lets off a few rounds and drops to the floor. There goes the other knee and then he’s dead. Washington just observes the guy die while the sprinkler system drenches him stylistically in slow motion.\n\nI look at The Equalizer and I think back to the ‘80s actioners from Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, Stallone (some of them), Jackie Chan and even Seagal. The Rock had fun with a few of these action pieces too. Go check out The Rundown. There was a pizzaz to the hero’s methodologies back then. It wasn’t just a brutal killing and bloodletting. A one liner accompanied the kills. It made you cheer and applaud. Those pictures worked like symphonies of dialogue and ultra cool action that John Wayne never accomplished. Robert McCall is boring. Just boring. An absolute bore.\n\nThe villain of this effortless piece is also boring. Marton Csokas did not advance his career with the lack of anything beyond his Russian dialect and three-piece suits used in this picture.\n\nAntoine Fuqua has yet to wow me. Though I know he’s an accomplished director, Training Day always feels like it comes up short with the three or four times I’ve watched it looking for its merits. The critically poor procedural of The Equalizer only lessens his promise for growth and potential.\n\nDenzel Washington has resorted to uninspired characters a few times now. He still earns accolades with pictures like the recent The Tragedy Of Macbeth (a Best Actor nomination) and on stage (I was in the third-row orchestra when I saw him do a forty five minute monologue in The Iceman Cometh on Broadway. Amazing!). Still, he just recently completed the third installment of the Equalizer series. Ugh! Why? Why Denzel? Why are you trying to be another past his prime, tired Liam Neeson in these cheapo action pictures?\n\nWhat I wouldn’t give for another Crimson Tide kind of thriller.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Marc S. Sanders\n\nSlap Shot is to hockey what Caddyshack is to golf. It is rude, crude and unapologetically harsh in its language, its temperament and with the memorable fraternal trio known as the Hanson brothers unforgiving with punches, slugs, checks and body slams. The wardrobe looks dated (some of the ugliest plaids you have ever seen) and it was produced during a time when hockey players could opt not to wear helmets but it is still outrageously funny. Best of all, Paul Newman, the guy from more upscale, sophisticated fare like Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, The Hustler, and Hud, leads the cast. Some of the best actors are also the best comedians. (Look at Robert DeNiro, Donald Sutherland and Clint Eastwood as well.)\n\nThe Charlestown Chiefs are the worst hockey team in the Federal League. When the local Pennsylvania mill has announced that it is closing, it does not look good for the team as attendance will drop lower than what it already is. The coach and oldest teammate, Reggie Dunlop (Newman), reaches for a few last-ditch efforts to elevate a demand and an appreciation for the Chiefs.\n\nFirst, he turns to reporter pal Dickie Dunn (M Emmet Walsh) and drops a made-up rumor that a Florida retirement community is interested in buying and relocating the team down south. Then, it dawns upon him to antagonize opposing players which will lead into a series of goon fights. His three newest recruits, the four eyed Hanson Brothers work best at bloodshed. The enhanced violence lead to wins and suddenly the Chiefs have a new fan base that follows them on the road and sells out their home games. Only one player, Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) is against this new approach. He’s college educated with a love for the game and refuses to stoop to Reggie’s level. A side story has Ned struggling with his marriage falling apart with his alcoholic wife (Lindsay Crouse).\n\nIn the meantime, as the rumor of the buyout stays alive, Reggie does his best to find who exactly owns the team. He wants to convince that party to keep the organization running.\n\nPaul Newman owns this film despite a collection of fantastic characters that embody the team. There’s the French-Canadian goalie who is not sharp at delivering proper English. Killer Carlson (Jerry Houser) quickly develops a knack for being more of goon than a hockey guard. The team’s manager played by Strother Martin (a regular mainstay co-star in a series of Newman films) has to get the team to catwalk model the latest in fashionwear furs, and there’s Francine (Jennifer Warren). She’s Reggie’s ex-wife, who still shares a thing with him but will not recommit while he continues to play hockey.\n\nGeorge Roy Hill (The Sting, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid) is the unlikeliest of directors for a foul-mouthed film like this and just knowing that seems to make Slap Shot all the more rebellious and appealing for repeat views. It’s as if Newman and Hill decided to lift their veil of innocence and join the ranks of the worst obscene. These guys just said “Aw fuck it. Let’s make the movie.” I smile each time a sharp guy like Paul Newman delivers an F bomb. It’s shocking, but it also works so perfectly. Hockey is anything but delicate fare.\n\nThere are dozens of fight scenes in Slap Shot and normally I might claim exhaustion with its repetitiveness. Thanks to Hill’s direction, every check or punch or wallop is caught differently. No one is safe; the fans, the radio announcer, the referees, the organ player, the players. All of them are in the line of fire of a puck or a punch. While it should, none of what you see ever looks the same. So, every contact in this contact sport brings one more laugh after another. Absolutely hilarious!\n\nThe Hanson trio (played by real life hockey players – Jeff and Steve Carlson, David Hanson) became a pop culture sensation in cinema with the release of this film. The image of these three goons, who look like nerds playing with racing car toys, is as uniquely identifiable as Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Terminator get up. You can never forget the Hanson Brothers.\n\nScreenwriter Nancy Dowd came up with the idea for Slap Shot after listening to her brother’s experiences of being on a minor league team. Most of the characters she developed were based on actual players that Ned Dowd played with or against.\n\nI always like when a movie can teach me how an industry works. With Slap Shot, as slapstick and raggedy as the material proudly is, there’s a mentality to witness and realize. These guys are literally this brazen, crude and unrepentant, but like Newman’s character Reggie, they’re not stupid or unlikeable either.\n\nThe conclusion of the picture is the championship game. It works because it performs against the grain of what the characters did to get to this point in the story. The first period break in the locker room is hilarious with Strother Martin going off the rails while Paul Newman is muttering hilariously in the background. What eventually sends this final game into the stratosphere is unexpected and hilarious.\n\nSlap Shot triumphs because it was never careful in its comedy. It’s obscene, prejudiced by today’s standards and yet I do not believe most audience demographics would be offended because there’s an understanding in what it means to be a goon on a hockey team.\n\nSlap Shot may be a movie of its time from nearly fifty years ago, but it still holds up with big laughs and hilarious set ups. If I need to be more formal in my praise, it’s one hysterical fucking movie with a great fucking script.\n\nNow cue the National Anthem because I’M LISTENING TO THE FUCKING SONG!!!!!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Marc S. Sanders\n\nI cannot stand to watch dogs in peril. It guts me right in the feels and stays with me long after. I only saw the movie Single White Female once, when it was in theaters, and I still remember that puppy’s horrifying demise. Terrible. Just awful.\n\nOn the other hand, when a dog is the companion or the factor of good fortune needed for the cast of human characters, I’m going to be won over. Arthur The King has a shaggy mutt that you absolutely fall in love with, but I don’t think its all schmaltz, because the dog who portrays the title character is not the only storyline to follow.\n\nMark Wahlberg is Michael, who leads a team of four endurance adventurer racers. He has the odds stacked against him. He’s a well-known racer within the circuit but not for the right reasons. The teams he’s led usually place in the top ten at the finish line, but Michael has never made it to first place. Not once. On social media, he’s mocked as the guy who comes up short. His father (Paul Guilfoyle) is not very encouraging either. As well, the window of opportunity to show himself as a champion is dwindling as he’s getting up in years. Still, Michael is confident he has one more race left in him, but he’s granted very little sponsorship money and given a lot less time to train and prepare than he and his team are accustomed to.\n\nJoining Michael in the competition is Olivia (Nathalie Emmanuel) who is an expert climber on any terrain. She is reluctantly joining the team at the urging of her terminally ill father. There’s also Chik (Ali Suliman) who serves as the navigator during the race looking for alternative routes and detours off the path that will put the team ahead of others. Lastly, there is Leo (Simu Liu). He is the vain Instagram celebrity with thousands of followers and a huge chip on his shoulder that tests Michael’s instincts because Leo has usually been right in the past. Michael always made the foolhardy option to ignore Leo’s concerns and thus got stuck in the mud, missing another first-place opportunity.\n\nThe homeless, neglected dog in the picture initially follows a parallel story within the streets of the Dominican Republic. Living off scraps with damp, dirty fur, he roams from place to place, being chased and bullied by other alley dogs.\n\nDirector Simon Cellan Jones goes for a documentary approach to the endurance racing. Bylines and GPS maps cut into the picture showing the team’s progress and where they stand in the rankings. Sometimes there are voiceover commentaries. It’s efficient information that allows the audience to keep up with the team’s progress as the flow of the film moves at a brisk pace.\n\nWe see the team of four run, bike, kayak, climb, stop for breaks, and debate their next options. Challenges arrive where a large rock must be climbed. Heavy rain weighs upon their progress. Snakes are encountered. Swamp conditions must be overcome. A thrilling zip line sequence will have you sitting up in your chair. The footage in this scene is amazing to look at from the enormous height over a bottomless jungle chasm. It’s certainly dramatic. Because the film does not rely on the standard suspense music you might find in other sports films, it performs like a documentary with the director’s well positioned camera work and the unexpected reactions of the cast.\n\nAt a rest stop the dog captures Michael’s attention. Some scritches and scratches along with a few meatball treats and then the team must move on. However, the dog seemingly turns up within the dense jungle terrain having followed their trajectory. Michael can’t help but be fascinated by the stamina of this animal, and thus a connection is made. Shortly thereafter, Olivia, Chik and even Leo warms up to the fifth team member.\n\nThe race goes on. Michael’s wife and daughter follow the team’s progress from home. Dehydration sets in. A twisted knee interferes. It’s all standard. Yet, it’s hard not to get caught up in this film.\n\nIf you have never been a pet owner, it might be hard to truly relate how an animal can change a person. It might sound cliché but there’s really no way to describe how unconditional a dog’s love can be, and Arthur The King certainly demonstrates that kind of affection. If that is still not enough for you to swallow, then consider that this film is based on a true story.\n\nThere was a dog named Arthur The King who defied the odds to keep up with an endurance racer named Mikael Lindnord, thereby inspiring the team to push forward and strive to win. The inspiration of the real-life Arthur established The Arthur Foundation whose ongoing mission is to raise funds to provide resources to help dogs around the world receive better care.\n\nArthur The King might have mapped out its story as soon as the movie began, but that does not mean it is devoid of genuine emotion. This film possesses a yearning for adventure and a need to defy doubt and reach for victory while never losing sight of what could be more valuable than a championship. The main character starts out as a confident endurance racer. Yet, he’s a new kind of racer with an eye-opening perspective when he meets Arthur The King.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Miguel E.

Terry Gilliam’s The Adventures of Baron Munchausen portrayed Death in the expected way, a skeletal figure cloaked in black and carrying a scythe, but it could also disguise itself. Meet Joe Black dressed Death in a tux and gave it Brad Pitt’s face and body – perhaps unlikely, but good for ticket sales. And in the most famous movie version of Death, it was a pale man in black who played chess with Max von Sydow in Ingmar Bergman’s uber-classic, The Seventh Seal.\n\nBut no movie that I’ve ever seen has ever approached the character of Death itself the way Tuesday does. In this film, Death is a bird. A parrot with dirty gray feathers. A parrot that can change size at will, sometimes as tall as a house, sometimes as tiny as a toad (or smaller), and sometimes just parrot-sized. And, as we eventually discover, it can talk and mimic voices.\n\nTuesday looks and feels like an early Spike Jonze film, back in the days of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. It is filled with imagination and unexpected plot turns and laden with meaning, but it never feels pretentious or preachy. It tells a familiar story – we must make peace with Death one way or the other – but the uniqueness of Death’s form and what happens after it reveals itself had me riveted for the entire running time of the film.\n\nIn this film, Tuesday is a 15-year-old girl (Lola Petticrew) who is dying of an unspecified disease that has relegated her to home-hospice care with an attentive, if slightly impersonal, nurse (Leah Harvey) and her mother, Zora (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, giving the performance of her career). Zora has not seemed to get past the first stage of grief, denial. She literally sneaks past Tuesday’s room so she can leave the house just as the nurse arrives, without having to speak to her. Instead of going to work, Zora spends her day going to pawn shops and coffee shops and sleeping on park benches.\n\nOn one such day, Tuesday looks up and sees…this parrot. The overall vibe of this parrot is hard to describe. It looks beat up, it’s dingy, it’s blind in one eye, but there is a sense of menace to it. Tuesday immediately intuits what the parrot is and why it’s there. As it approaches her to perform its duty, Tuesday stops it by telling a joke. (It’s the one about the cop who stops a guy who has twelve penguins in his car.) The parrot takes it in and…laughs. I’ve never been in the same room with a laughing psychotic, but I would imagine it would sound pretty much the same as when Death laughs.\n\nAnd then the parrot opens its mouth and talks to Tuesday. They have a conversation. And suddenly Death seems to suffer some kind of panic attack, as the voices of all the creatures on Earth whose time has come assault Death’s ears. Tuesday instinctively coaches it through a breathing exercise. The voices go away. She recommends a bath. They bond. She pages through a history book and gets Death’s commentary on dead historical figures. Stalin: “An absolute prick!” Jesus: “Oh, He LOVED irony.” It mimics Jesus’ voice. Whatever you think Jesus’ voice really sounded like, I promise you will be surprised.\n\nAlso, don’t get the idea that this is an all-out comedy because of the above dialogue. Keep in mind that this is Death we’re talking about. Death’s voice, when it speaks, is low, gravelly and menacing, even when it’s cracking jokes. At one point, Tuesday plays an old song on her computer, and Death, being eternal, is familiar with it. It even sings along and dances. At least, as far as any parrot CAN dance. Yet even in this moment of levity, there is still that sense of menace in the offing because of that brilliantly chosen voice, provided by an actor named Arinzé Kene, who is unknown to me, but if I ever see that he recorded an audiobook, I’m buying it.\n\nThis whole time, I’m watching the movie thinking to myself, WHERE is this GOING. I was fascinated by this exceedingly odd couple. The direction by first-timer Daina Oniunas-Pusic is just as assured and risky as anything by Spike Jonze or Sofia Coppola. I was worried that it was going to veer off into a weird tangent where Death falls in love with Tuesday, but nothing like that happens. Death knows its function, and so does Tuesday, so the problem now is how to deal with Tuesday’s mother, who is clearly not prepared to deal with Tuesday’s death, imminent or otherwise.\n\n…and from here on out, I am going to give no more story specifics. To say that I went into this movie cold is an understatement. Trust me, the colder you are, the better it will be. The ultimate message of the film, as I said, is not that far removed from any number of other films. I would even compare it to the first Inside Out from Pixar, which demonstrated that sadness is an ultimately necessary part of becoming who we are. Tuesday also uses a CG character (in the real world) to remind us that the only way to make peace with who we are is to make peace with where we’ll all be in 100 years. The final words of the film are a call to action to everyone watching.\n\n[Ed. Note: Tuesday is one of those so-called rarities, a completely original studio film, released in movie theaters before heading to a streamer, that’s not a sequel or insanely high-budget. It’s intelligent, compelling, and non-stop surprising. And it had absolutely zero publicity, at least in my area. I saw no trailers, no posters, no internet hype. According to boxofficemojo.com, it has grossed a little over $320,000 since its domestic release on June 7th. Not exactly setting attendance records. If you’re interested in seeing it in theaters, I’d say your window is extremely limited at this point.]\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Marc S. Sanders\n\nA film like Mark Rydell’s The River only thrives on witnessing the misery of people living with the misery of others. That’s not to say this is not how ordinary people are often forced to live. There’s too much suffering in the world. I can never deny that. A homeless shelter or a prison are settings of great misfortune, hardship and sadness. Yet for a movie, sometimes you must ask what the point is, especially when it is apparent that the heroes are destined to lose against the forces of nature while the villain is entirely correct in his own cause. Sometimes in a no-win situation it is honorable to just give up. I wish Tom Garvey, the corn farmer, would have just quit being a farmer and sought a better life for his wife Mae and their two young children.\n\nTom and Mae are played by Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek. He is the current generation who owns the Tennessee corn crop farm that his family lineage has passed down. The first twenty minutes of The River depict the harshness of terrible rainstorms that flood the nearby river and wash away the family’s prized crops and land. Tom, Mae and the children do everything in their power to recede the water as the rain continues to come down in buckets. Mae fills up sacks of mud and water with their daughter Beth. Their son Lewis works with Tom on the beat-up tractor against a never-ending battle of plowing the flood waters away from the land. There’s no way to overcome this terrible plague of weather that comes at least twice every year. As I watch the sopping wet struggle that opens the picture in the middle of a stormy night, shot very well by Rydell and his crew, I already ask myself what’s the point? Get out of this situation Tom!!!!! Take up babysitting, tutor, become a fireman, go back to school. Relocate for heaven’s sakes!!!!\n\nWhat recuses the Garvey family and the farm, one more time, is when the rain finally stops.\n\nScott Glenn is Joe Wade. He is a wealthy industrialist, who also grew up in these parts under a family legacy. Joe is on the good side of the state politicians and is aggressive in buying out the farmers’ land so that he can flood the valley, build a dam and use the overabundance of water to power the utilities of the area in a more efficient and much less costly way for everyone. And he’s the villain of the story????????\n\nJoe makes sense. Tom’s passion for holding on to what his family has owned does not. I get the idea of grasping on to family heirlooms like my grandfather’s watch that he maybe kept hidden in an uncomfortable orifice while being held captive by the Nazis, or the prized jewel that survived a shipwreck generations ago. I also understand the desire to carry the torch of the harsh labor a father and a father before endured and died for while allowing a farm to thrive. Yet, there are children to feed and debts to pay. The ruin that comes from the acts of God do not empathize. Therefore, I say again, sometimes the bravest and most sensible thing a person can do is actually quit.\n\nTom, along with most of the neighboring farmers, are adamant about not selling their land to Joe. When auctions occur to sell off the equipment and leftover supplies of the few that do surrender, it is practically considered a gross violation of a sacred code in these parts. I look at the stubborn folks who frown upon their peers as terribly disrespectful. The script is expecting me to empathize with Tom and those who stand with him though.\n\nMidway through, The River takes a detour as Tom leaves to do hard labor elsewhere to earn much needed cash. This is where misery does not love company. He is one of many men selected to do factory work as an inexpensive replacement for the union workers on strike. Tom, along with the other recruits, are threatened, called scabs, and in a glaring scene spit directly in the face. A fellow worker is beat up in the middle of the night. All of this is powerful footage and yet who am I supposed to empathize with? These workers on strike are demanding better benefits and rights. A guy like Tom, who values the survival of the Garvey farm, interferes in someone else’s just cause for his own welfare.\n\nI think about films like Schindler’s List and even The Lord Of The Rings fantasies and I witness the hardships and suffering of a collective people. Those stories never expect me to value the misery of a select few over others. I take stock in a whole populace. In Mark Rydell’s film, however, I feel like I’m only asked to cry for Tom Garvey’s relief, the stubborn father who is defiant for an unlikely future of promise for the area he occupies while also ignoring the welfare of his family against the forces of nature. Joe is offering Tom and Mae hundreds of thousands of dollars for their land so that he can enhance the state. Joe’s bounty will rescue the family from insurmountable debt and the unforgiving floods that repeatedly destroy their crops. Still, I’m supposed to believe that Joe is the asshole.\n\nSissy Spacek was nominated for Best Actress for her performance. She competed against Sally Field (who won) and Jessica Lange. Both were ironically featured in their own “farm life films” in 1984. Spacek remains one of Hollywood’s finest actors. However, I did not think there was much for her to do here. A drawn-out sequence has Mae caught under a tractor with a nasty wound while the blistering heat bears down with no one around to help. It has its moment of suspense because this film could go in many different directions of tragedy, but a development like this is more circumstantial than performance based. If Katherine Hepburn or Laurence Olivier were under that tractor, the scene would not play out much differently. It’s just a standard farmer accident destined to be included in a standard farmer picture.\n\nThe possibility of a love triangle is also implied during the film. As soon as I saw the opening credits (Sissy Spacek, Mel Gibson, Scott Glenn), I hoped against all hope that the story would not go there, and yet…\n\nHaving hardly even used a rake or a shovel, I know that farming is a grueling life and still so necessary for our world consumption to survive. The River attempts to demonstrate this message. I empathize with people like Tom. I really do. However, I empathize with the sacrifice they may need to take, not with their with their foolhardy stubbornness or their intrusion upon others’ challenges for gain. If a doctor told me that no matter what efforts he performs he will not be able to save my arm or my leg, I’m going to have to believe him and accept that the limb must be amputated. If an overflowing river and an unbearably long rainstorm affects my home, my farm, my family and my livelihood at least twice a year, eventually I’m going to come to my senses and tell myself that the bad guy is probably right.\n\nContrary to the well-known slogan, sometimes money is everything.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Miguel E. Rodriguez\n\nDIRECTOR: Peter Yates\n\nCAST: Robert Mitchum, Peter Boyle, Richard Jordan, Steven Keats, Alex Rocco\n\nMY RATING: 9/10\n\nROTTEN TOMATOMETER: 98% Certified Fresh\n\nPLOT: After his most recent arrest has him looking at a long prison sentence for repeat offenses, an aging Boston gangster must decide whether or not to snitch on his friends to avoid jail time.\n\nWhen scrolling through movie titles online or on your favorite streaming service, you might be forgiven for thinking that a 1973 movie with a title like The Friends of Eddie Coyle is a dialogue-driven character study by John Sayles or John Schlesinger, about a group of friends gathered at a hunting cottage or a class reunion or something. Imagine my surprise when I watched it, and it turned out to be a nearly-forgotten gem of early ‘70s crime films. (I’d call it a neo-noir, but it was released over fifty years ago now, so I’m not sure the term “neo” applies anymore.) Featuring spare, economical storytelling reminiscent of other crime classics like Rififi [1955] or The Killing [1956], The Friends of Eddie Coyle is indeed a character study, but one that manages to downplay even Robert Mitchum’s heroic persona.\n\nEddie Coyle is getting old, and he knows it. He’s currently facing up to 5 years in jail when he goes in front of a judge in a few days, but his old associates still rely on him to obtain “clean” firearms to use in pulling bank robberies. The first time we see him doing this thankless job, he tells his cocky young supplier a story about why he has extra knuckles on his left hand, a speech that might have been written by a multiverse version of Quentin Tarantino. (In fact, the bank robberies are accomplished when Eddie’s friends hold the bank manager’s family members hostage, so he’ll open the vault without question, a method paraphrased by “Pumpkin” in the opening scene of Pulp Fiction.) Mitchum delivers this mini-logue with his trademark brand of world-weariness and menace, leading us to believe at the outset that he’s a man not to be trifled with, when in fact he’s little more than a glorified gofer for his bosses.\n\nThe film oozes a 1970’s atmosphere in every frame, but somehow it doesn’t feel all that dated. There are no long zooms or extended chase sequences. The most suspenseful scenes are the two bank robberies and one aborted car chase that is over as soon as it starts. (I actually thought that was pretty clever, subverting our expectations by ending the chase after about fifteen seconds; this method was also put to good use in 2003’s not-as-bad-as-you-think S.W.A.T.) The dialogue feels more modern, laced with f-words and racial epithets that, again, feel more at home in a Q.T. film than in a Robert Mitchum movie. For my money, there may be a few movie-watching experiences that can top hearing Robert Mitchum telling someone to go f— himself, but I can’t think of what they are right now.\n\nDirector Peter Yates (Bullitt, Breaking Away) never once strains for effect, never showboats. Like John Huston’s The Asphalt Jungle, it is content to merely set the stage and observe what happens, letting the events and the characters drive the plot instead of contrived action scenes or fancy camera movements. Instead of becoming bored, I was drawn into Eddie’s dilemma, his conflict between loyalty to his so-called friends and his desire to stay out of prison. Complicating matters is the fact he has a wife and three school-age kids; they all live in a tiny townhouse where you can touch both walls of the kitchen with your arms outstretched. This is a wrinkle uncommon in most gangster films, where the heavies lead unattached lives.\n\nWhen Eddie approaches a federal agent (Richard Jordan) and asks if the New Hampshire judge will look favorably on Eddie’s sentencing if he agrees to squeal on his gunrunner friend, I felt a little sorry for him, and that’s a neat trick. Because of Mitchum’s presence, you almost automatically want to root for him to do the right thing, but because of the character he’s playing so well, I just got the feeling that things were not going to end well for him, and I was right. After getting a taste of what Eddie has to offer in terms of high-profile arrests, the federal agent leaves him dangling, telling him the judge will keep him out of jail if he keeps ratting on his buddies. Poor Eddie is in an impossible situation, and the irony is, when he finally makes his decision, it’s already too late…but I don’t want to spoil anything. It’s a brilliant catch-22 that left me feeling even sorrier for Eddie than I did before.\n\nThe whole movie is like that. We’re shown right up front that Eddie is a criminal. But the hands-off filmmaking approach allows the viewer to make up his own mind. You could, I suppose, watch this movie in one of two mindsets: either you empathize right away with Eddie and his predicament, or you can take him at face value and watch the movie waiting to see if he gets what’s coming to him, both for being a crook AND for squealing on his friends. Either way, I think the movie’s resolution satisfies both interpretations, which is not an easy task.\n\nIf you sit down to watch The Friends of Eddie Coyle, just remember that it’s not The French Connection or Heat or anything splashy or flashy. It’s a grim, gritty crime drama with a bona fide legend playing a petty thug instead of a crime lord. Mitchum fits the bill, and the movie fits Mitchum. The Boston environments – all shot 100% on location – mirror the way Eddie walks and talks: gray, blank, tired. Beneath that grimy coating, though, is a rather brilliant character study of a man whose life has brought him to a crossroads where he must decide what’s more important to him, his friends or his life. (His decision kinda surprised me, I’ll be honest.)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nby Miguel E. Rodriguez\n\nDIRECTOR: Marcel Ophüls\n\nMY RATING: 9/10\n\nROTTEN TOMATOMETER: 100% Fresh\n\nPLOT: A documentary about Klaus Barbie, the Gestapo chief in Lyon, France, and his life after the war.\n\nThere is so much to unpack in Hotel Terminus, Marcel Ophüls’ epic documentary, that I am hesitant to even try to write about it. In terms of the craft of filmmaking, there is nothing to critique aside from the skillful editing, which surprisingly makes its 4.5-hour running time fly by. In terms of content…I mean, where could I even begin? Here’s a summary I found online: “Marcel Ophüls’ riveting film details the heinous legacy of the Gestapo head dubbed ‘The Butcher of Lyon.’ Responsible for over 4,000 deaths in occupied France during World War II, Barbie would escape – with U.S. help – to South America in 1951, where he lived until a global manhunt led to his 1983 arrest and subsequent trial.”\n\nWait, what? The United States intelligence apparatus smuggled a brutal Nazi officer out of Europe? Six years after the Nuremberg trials? Yes. Ophüls interviews various players from US Army Counterintelligence – known as the “CIC” in the 1940s – who state flatly on camera that Barbie had connections and information regarding Russian communists, so it was in America’s best interests to keep Barbie alive and out of prison and get him to South America.\n\nSo, at the very least, today I learned something.\n\nThis sprawling documentary also features eyewitnesses to Barbie’s atrocities in Lyon, France, where he was stationed. I don’t want to recite a laundry list of these terrible acts, but the film does key on two specific events during his tenure: the arrest and execution of Jean Moulin, a French Resistance leader, and the deportation to Auschwitz of 44 Jewish children from an orphanage in a town called Izieu. Ophüls interviews scores of people who were in the room when Barbie arrested Moulin. Many of them disagree who was to blame – a rat or someone with loose lips – but they all remember who made the arrest. The stories from witnesses to the deportation of the children are beyond belief.\n\nWhat is the point of a documentary like this? Why should it be important for a filmgoer, or just an average Joe, to block out nearly five hours to watch a series of talking heads tell story after shocking story about the inhuman tactics of a monster? Well, for one thing, that’s not the whole story. Hotel Terminus actually has an arc, because Barbie was discovered living in Bolivia in 1972. In 1983, he was extradited to France where he was convicted on numerous crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1991. The filmmakers didn’t know that in 1988, of course, but it felt good to throw that factoid in there. Another interesting factoid: America apologized to France in 1983 for helping him escape to Bolivia in the first place. Better late than never, I guess?\n\nSo, it’s good to know while watching that the man in question will eventually get his just desserts. But there are times when it almost feels like the “A-story” of Barbie’s eventual arrest gets overwhelmed by the “B-story,” which is the paradoxical attitudes of many of the people interviewed. One man wonders, what’s the point of it all? Barbie committed his crimes forty years earlier, and France has a statute of limitations of twenty years, so just let the man grow old and die in obscurity. Another theorizes that stirring up old memories of the war when many would rather move on actually created more civil unrest in France and Germany. Barbie’s defense attorney at his war crimes trial (a Eurasian Frenchman) wonders why Barbie is being tried for crimes against humanity while France’s own acts of torture and horrific imprisonment during the Battle of Algiers are discreetly ignored.\n\nAnd always Ophüls has rejoinders for each of these statements with stories of families separated, men and women tortured, family members whisked away and never seen again. One woman recalls being tortured as a girl by Barbie, while her mother was told, “This is YOUR fault; if you would just talk, we would stop.” And so on, ad infinitum. But I am compelled to point out again how compelling this was. These and so many other stories like them did not depress me or lower my spirits. Instead, I was riveted. I can’t explain why. For myself, I felt like this was something I needed to hear, and other people needed to hear. Here was a record of something that really happened, to real people in a real place in a time that was not so long ago, in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThere was also a section that really made me take notice. Many, MANY people said on camera that, in his old age, Barbie was “a good man.” He was friendly to his neighbors – even some Jews! – and a loving father. His daughter-in-law is interviewed, and she states that he always had a kind word for her and always tried to include her in his family circle, even after her husband (Barbie’s son) died. It made me think about the driving force behind last year’s brilliant Zone of Interest: the banality of evil. Perhaps among many others, Barbie was living proof that evil will not always wear a black hat and have glowing red eyes. Evil is just as capable of engaging you in friendly conversation as the next man. (I was also reminded of a line from David Fincher’s Se7en: “If we catch John Doe and he turns out to be the devil, I mean if he’s Satan himself, that MIGHT live up to our expectations. But he’s not the devil. He’s just a man.”) Is that one of the lessons of this film? That evil is not supernatural or some kind of horrific aberration, but just a small person with delusions of grandeur? Discuss.\n\nThere are echoes of Schindler’s List in the details of these stories, but Ophüls notably never uses any archival footage of concentration camps or of the Holocaust itself. He apparently felt that audiences had, regrettably, become accustomed to the gruesome imagery of those events. Instead, he relies on the viewer’s imagination to provide all the necessary details.\n\nHe also, tellingly, never provides answers to the stickiest questions that surrounded Barbie’s trial, especially the one about France being willing to charge him with crimes against humanity while ignoring their own history in Algeria. I thought about that one a lot in relation to America. Our country is great for a whole host of reasons, but it’s not perfect. We rise up in vocal disapproval when a foreign country commits genocide, or when a country’s citizenry is threatened by totalitarianism…while ignoring (for the most part) the fact that our country exists because of genocidal practices against indigenous Americans. Am I suggesting that perhaps Ophüls is wrong to focus on Barbie and not France’s history? Absolutely not. Barbie was a monster and got what he deserved, belatedly or not. But I am suggesting that the film raises questions that deserve further discussion.\n\nUltimately, I’m glad I saw Hotel Terminus, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone who asks. The visceral nature of the stories told by some of the subjects is enough to make it compelling, even without the overarching structure of following Barbie to his downfall. It’s a challenging watch, to be sure, but I promise you’ll never be bored. Trust me.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBy Marc S. Sanders\n\nIf you don’t know by now, I’m a huge admirer of Clint Eastwood’s work. His talents broach so many facets. He acts. He produces. He’s likely even better when he’s in the director’s chair. He actually sings and he has even orchestrated his own music for some of his films. Ever since I was first introduced to him at a young age when he played Dirty Harry Callahan and Fido Beddo, partnered with Clyde the orangutan, I was fascinated by his coolness and confidence in his stature on screen. Whether he’s raising a fist, donning a scowl, giving a smirk or a squint of his narrow eyes or using his most famous prop, a .44 Magnum handgun, as an extension of his right arm, I’ve always been magnetically drawn to what he does on screen.\n\nOnline, a common question is asked: What is your favorite Clint Eastwood movie? If I have to choose one, I guess it would have to be Magnum Force, the follow up to Dirty Harry. Yet, I always believed Magnum Force could not operate without hitching on to the impact and message from Dirty Harry. I can’t just like The Godfather Part II without liking the first film. I can’t just love The Empire Strikes Back without liking its box office predecessor. Same goes for The Lord Of The Rings pictures.\n\nMagnum Force works so well because it questions what celebrated the Harry Callahan character that Eastwood portrayed two years prior. This is a San Fransisco cop who defies authority when he knows that a danger must be suppressed without the inconvenience of bureaucratic red tape and police procedurals that ultimately will work in the criminals’ favor if not taken care of immediately. As the first film demonstrated, it is easy for us to side with Harry’s desperation because we know the crazed killer is on the loose and he is only going to kill again and again while never surrendering or negotiating. This second follow up film (in a series of five) tests the ideology of Eastwood’s character.\n\nA series of grisly murders are occurring within the city and it appears that a traffic cop is committing the acts. The victims are the worst mobsters and pimps within San Fransisco who time and again have been overlooked for their crimes and/or have been released from trial or prisons based on technicalities. A handful of characters within Magnum Force remind us that someone is saving the taxpayers a lot of money each time the body count increases.\n\nThere’s a slight mystery to this film. Harry encounters four rookie cops (David Soul, Robert Urich, Kip Niven and Tim Matheson) who seem very likable. They are admirable of Harry’s reputation. Harry is impressed by their shooting skills in particular. Another traffic cop is an old friend of Harry’s, a guy named Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan) who is on the edge and might pose a threat if he continues working the streets. Any of these men could be suspects to these vigilante murders as it is soon realized that the scene of some of these crimes are similar. Often, cars are pulled over for traffic violations. As well, ballistics indicate that the weapons of choice are normally a .357 Magnum, the standard issued firearm for a police officer.\n\nThe debate with Harry’s philosophy, firmly established in the prior film, is staged against that of his superior, Lt. Briggs. He’s played by Hal Holbrook who is one of the best antagonists in all of Eastwood’s films. They play so well against one another. Early on, Briggs declares he’s never once had to pull his gun out of his holster. Callahan sarcastically salutes the lieutenant by reminding him that men have got to know their limitations and that’s where the measure of asking what is ultimately necessary in fighting crime. Where does it begin and when does it end?\n\nHarry Callahan is that unusual cop who is frowned upon for the actions he takes in his own hands. Other cops in movies played by Stallone or Gibson go to extreme measures simply for the cinematic action of it all. Callahan is never thanked or given any serious commendations for what he executes with his .44 Magnum, a weapon that is as outside the lines as Harry himself.\n\nThe difference between Harry and whoever this vigilante is must be deciphered and much of Magnum Force’s grey area is all that is seen. Eventually, the black vs white clarity reveals itself and a telling lesson presents itself between what Harry Callahan stands for and what guise a vigilante operates under. At the risk of revealing too much, the best scene of the picture occurs between Holbrook and Eastwood’s characters as they sum up the entirety of the film before the climax. This film is over fifty years old and still the assortment of mindsets found within Magnum Force are worth pondering. Callahan is put to the test one time before in a haunting parking garage.\n\nBeyond what’s worth considering among these many dangerous philosophies, this is a solid action picture with thrilling and well edited shoot outs among the cops and robbers. A hilarious plane hijacking is derailed by Harry when he poses as a pilot. Later there’s a store robbery that is undone and then there is a warehouse port exchange of gunfire that puts Harry and his partner in unexpected danger.\n\nThere is an interesting target competition between the cops that implies what Harry suspects. I like this scene in particular because it gives an inside look into how police officers interact and admire one another when not on the streets. Yet, when one particular cop cannot get a thought out of his mind, it carries over into the action of the moment. At the combat range, Harry fires his gun at one particular target that may cause you to sit up in your chair a little. Often, Eastwood performs with little to no dialogue in his films and this is one very informative moment.\n\nAs much as I’m a big fan of Magnum Force, the penultimate scene always sticks in my craw a little. Callahan is pursued on foot within the bulk of a freighter. There is very little light provided in this sequence as Harry moves down one corridor or around a corner elsewhere. It’s hard to see what is happening and who is where or who I am looking at. For such a thrilling movie, this is a bit of a letdown as overall much of the action of this movie is driven by the plot. Nothing feels random in Magnum Force. Everything moves towards more story development or realizations. Yet, I have to be somewhat forgiving only because this darkened scene occurs after all of the cards are put on the table and all the hero has to do is survive.\n\nJust before the foot chase, there is a thrilling car chase with Eastwood actually doing the driving that takes us through the well-known twists of Lombard Street. Director Ted Post wisely covers this from an overhead shot. The car careens up and down the steep slopes of San Fransisco’s avenues and there are plenty of intense close ups of Eastwood behind the wheel accompanied by the screeching tires, bullets bouncing off the windshield and motors humming. I have declared it before, the best place to have a car chase is in San Fransisco. Surprisingly, this pursuit hardly ever gets categorized with the great ones like Bullitt, The French Connection, Ronin or The Seven Ups.\n\nIf you have never seen Magnum Force, check it out. It is off color at times, but the exploits of Harry Callahan and the scum he’s forced to associate with were never about political correctness. Still, there is much to debate, argue, and lend some serious thought to, especially in a newly unsteady climate of police acceptance and procedure. My one recommendation though is to watch it as a double feature with the original Dirty Harry to truly see the two sides of Harry Callahan’s coin.\n\nNOTE: An interesting fact I just realized at the end of Dirty Harry, the cop shoots the bad guy with his right hand. Later, he tosses his badge, but with his left hand. Especially with Magnum Force as a follow up film, I see the internal struggle of Harry Callahan pitting his gun up against the mindsets that come with his badge.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
