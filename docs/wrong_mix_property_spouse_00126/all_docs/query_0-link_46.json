I actually liked A Dame To Kill For more than the first Sin City. I think it moves at a quicker pace, and has more engaging characters. Joseph Gordon Levitt’s storyline, specifically, is more entertaining than the entire first film. The sequel is focused, it has less main characters, and feels less scattershot.\n\nThat being said, it’s still not a perfect film. it can be a bit over dramatic. I’m less of a fan of Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba’s storyline in this film, and Rourke doesn’t quite get to shine as much here as he did in the first Sin City. Marv lacks the gravitas and the heart. Here, he’s basically a big hulking guy who hits things.\n\nLevitt definitely needs to do more film noir type films, because he’s great in them. Loved his work in this. I wish more people had seen the film just to appreciate what he can do for the genre."
