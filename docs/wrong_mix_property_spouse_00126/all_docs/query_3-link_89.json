        "text": "Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was a pioneer in the seventeenth-century English print trade. Although preceded by numerous Englishwomen who wrote and published before her, Cavendish was the first woman in England who sought to establish herself as a published, professional writer. Bibliographically, Cavendish’s books are aesthetically impressive; D. F. McKenzie has labelled Cavendish’s printed texts as “interesting for their surface—they’re sumptuous, lavishly spaced, highly decorated folios printed in Great Primer or Double Pica on good paper.”1 In addition to their aesthetic appeal, Cavendish’s printed works reflect a deliberate use of the print medium to promote their author’s contributions in the fields of science, natural history, and literature, which of course had been dominated previously by men such as Francis Bacon, Robert Hooke, and Thomas Hobbes. Cavendish’s bibliographic self-presentation manifests most prominently on the title pages of her printed works. Several of her books were printed in two or more editions with distinctly different titles, authorial attributions, and permutations of her name, Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. These variations often reflect the chaotic circumstances of Cavendish’s life, which included periods of exile during the English Civil War. In this essay, I demonstrate how Cavendish’s printed texts reflect her desire to become a respected member of the publishing community in Civil War-era England while simultaneously revealing the complicated and chaotic nature of the political lives of English nobles in the seventeenth century. 1 D. F. McKenzie, Making Meaning: “Printers of the Mind” and Other Essays, ed. Peter D. McDonald and Michael Felix Suarez (Amherst: University Of Massachusetts Press, 2002), 122."
