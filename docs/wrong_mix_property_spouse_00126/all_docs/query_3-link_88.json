        "text": "Right in time for Halloween comes this spirited comedy animation with itsy-bitsy amounts of friendly horror. The Addams bunch are a zany lot and this film excellently sells their weirdness, whilst keeping the sense of family togetherness in tact.\n\nAvoiding humans and their pitchfork grabbing ways are husband and wife Gomez and Morticia (Oscar Isaac & Charlize Theron) who’ve moved into a haunted asylum. Now with two children, they are encroached upon by a garish settlement built up by TV host Margaux Needler (Allison Janney). She is incessant on remodelling the Addams’ mansion for ratings but the family are more preoccupied with their everyday un-normal lives.\n\nWhether you’ve seen anything regarding the spook-tacular family before, the theme tune jingle is something that’s wormed into common knowledge and come the end of this film you’ll be clicking your fingers along to the musical beat without realising it. It’s not only the sounds that grab the attention, so does the striking animation. It does share similarities to ‘Hotel Transylvania’ but something about this movie stomps out of the graveyard with vigour.\n\nThe ghoulish black hole of the Addams’ home is a centre for crazy antics which are dead entertaining. Their infested habitat contrasted with the bubblegum pop visuals of Assimilation; a town created by Margaux make for a great clash of cultures. Allison Janney laps up her makeover presenter role with spicy relish, as if her neighbourhood mirrors the Tim Burton styles of ‘Edward Scissorhands’. The carefully manufactured order of her character isn’t only seen through her work but her impressively maintained hair.\n\nIt’s definitely a film with a flavour of spooky senses which are delightful for the family. Along the way there are constant puns which are spun into the writing, each one playfully sending up the family or there knack to wish ill will on others. Assimilation’s strict order of being like everyone else isn’t the only plot line, there are great branches of other stories such as Pugsley hoping to become a man and Wednesday striving to see what’s on the other side of the gates which all tie up together nicely.\n\nChloe Grace Moretz ironically brings life to the teenage Wednesday, a moping yet whip-smart soul who’s vocals are morose, monotone and suitably down in the dumps. Theron is devilishly cool as Morticia, a mum trying to retain her own disordered take on order, even if Eva Green would be the perfect candidate for the role. Snoop Dogg rolls up as the hairy figure of Cousin Itt and that’s all you need to know in terms of how batty this film is.\n\nIt may not be the most riveting of stories but the cartoonish animation helps inject more excuses for out-there undead enjoyment. There was a seriously grave thought that this would be a forgettable, uninteresting flick but it’s actually a creepily kooky well-made altogether ooky showcase of morbid curiosity.\n\n6.5/10\n\nA dangerous game of cat and mouse plays out in this thriller film from Irish director Neil Jordan. As writer and director, does he reach into his bag of tricks and pull out a taut, psychological treat or a cheap dud that should be left on the subway?\n\nWaitress Frances (Chloe Grace Moretz) is living with her friend Erica (Maika Monroe) in Tribeca, New York and is currently dealing with the tragic fact her mother recently passed away. On a trip home from work, Frances spots an abandoned handbag on the Metro and returns it to its’ owner, Greta (Isabelle Huppert), a kind gesture she’ll quickly regret when this woman clings on and develops a worrying obsession with her.\n\n‘Greta’ does have some striking pangs of unease that shine through, but sadly they don’t manage to torch away the mishandled attempts at twisty tension. It’s a movie which grows more and more ridiculous and the screenplay, from Jordan and Ray Wright is one which seems to spill over with silliness and what could have been an unsettling, dark comment on manic infatuation instead becomes a piece of work which tries too hard.\n\nJavier Navarrete’s score is a large reason this film comes across as extremely extra; a millennial term I never expected to use in a review but one that perfectly embodies the psychotic antics of Greta and similarly the OTT beats within the plot, which are punctuated with way too much aural attack. The harsh strings and bursts of loud sound make the film feel increasingly and comically melodramatic.\n\nThere are saving graces to be had, most of which can be found in the calms before the storms. These quieter moments are captivating and not only fill you with a prickling dread but give clues to how good the film could have been if it stayed on this more subtle course. The fear of the unknown ad the unrelenting stalker-nature of Greta raise the hairs on the back of your neck and Huppert is an exceptional presence of creepiness.\n\n‘Greta’ has good-to-great flashes where you can share Frances’ escalating paranoia but the suspense is overdosed with jittery and heightened nonsense one too many times.\n\n6/10\n\nPremiering at the Venice Film Festival, ‘Call Me By Your Name’ director Luca Guadagnino’s homage to the 1977 ‘Suspiria’ is a film that has vastly polarised critics and audiences alike and is definitely an example of a weirdly hypnotising film, whether it be good or bad.\n\nDancer Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) has always felt an urge to be where top choreographer Madame Blanc (Tilda Swinton) is. This desire takes Susie to the Tanz Academy in Berlin where she quickly grows accustomed to the methods of Blanc and other madams and their front as a dance school slowly disappears to reveal them as a chorus of witches.\n\nOff the bat I must admit I have not seen the Dario Argento original but shall definitely seek it out after watching…whatever this was. The whole look of this update doesn’t go down the usual glossier redo but keeps the film in bland, bleak tones of browns, greys and whites which makes the bursts of red all the more alarming. The entire feature has this odd pull; like it’s drawing you into a state of hypnosis which nicely mirrors the inexplicable connection Susie has always had with Madame Blanc.\n\nGuadagnino utilises on some neat shots and clever style choices throughout this film. Whether the frame rate is slowed right down or cameras suddenly whip and zoom toward someone, there’s definitely a smart tactic made by the director in presenting this strange horror with a flair of confidence and compelling curiosity.\n\nPeople will likely be talking about the near final scene for a while. A carnival of Dionysus proportions with a river of red is outlandish and mad. This creepy coven shows off a beastly display of blood and ritual that is so horrific and over the top that it’s very nearly unintentionally amusing. Better flashes of horror comes from a dance section with the ladies draped in ropes of red which is amazingly choreographed and an earlier back and forth rite of passage between a debut rehearsal and a victim trapped in her own freakish hall of mirrors. This moment is squeamish and damn effective.\n\n‘Suspiria’ does have an abundance of flaws though, a major one lies with the screenwriter’s choice to present the narrative in a 1970’s setting with too much room spent on the aftermath of the Berlin divide and post-war anxieties and grief. This theme is fine but on the whole it drastically takes away from what could have been a more focused look at just the dance academy and its witches. Thom Yorke’s soundtrack provides a heavy dose of piano which adds to the mesmerising quality but often makes the movie like a lullaby to rest your eyelids to. Also, that carnival explosion of gore and coven craziness has a great sinister sound backing the visuals and then Yorke’s vocals come in again and make the whole thing feel dreamy and ridiculous.\n\nJohnson definitely knocks back anyone who says she can’t act because her turn as Bannion is a fantastic journey of passion, training and a personal core of unsettling change to where she ends up. Swinton is as strangely alluring and magnetic as always, just the way she delivers her lines like a precise poet carries a maternal yet worrying edge. The likelihood is that she also plays two other characters and one is of an aged male doctor which further proves what a brilliant chameleon Swinton is as an actor.\n\n‘Suspiria’ to the uninitiated really goes places you won’t expect and feels like a mysterious yet slow descent into hell. It’s often too drab and floaty but has great attacks of visual horror along the way.\n\n4.5/10\n\nAfter the surprisingly funny and very agreeable box office takings of ‘Bad Neighbours‘, it probably isn’t any shock that this movie came about. Though having said this it’s not like it was overly called for and upon seeing this sequel I have to say it feels deadly lacking of good laughs.\n\nNow full time parents to little Stella, Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen & Rose Byrne) are moving on. They think they’ve sold their house but due to an escrow deal, they have 30 days to keep the buyers sweet to finish the agreement. Unluckily for them, the once empty frat house next door is being overtaken by a headstrong lass called Shelby (Chloe Grace Moretz) who starts her own partying sorority there and a new war begins.\n\nJust looking at the writing team sparks trouble for this film, as there are five guys tackling this script making the finished product less than light and cohesive. It does make a difference truly as the 2014 movie only had two screenwriters. The saying of too many cooks spoiling the broth certainly rings true with most films I’ve seen with an over-abundance of writers. It’s like the quintet are teaming up for the bigger picture but want all their own touches involved too, amazingly the film doesn’t appear messy, it’s more hollow.\n\nNicholas Stoller is back to direct this feature and it certainly is a mad foray into the world of female partying and girl empowerment this time around. Though one negative is that this movie isn’t as over the top as last time, the interaction between the oldies and young blood isn’t anywhere near as cool, exciting and funnily tense and another negative is the whole gender scope the film runs with.\n\nA lot of the time during the plot, it brings up issues of what girls can and cannot do, what Shelby believes a growing woman is entitled to and ultimately how the parents view it all considering their daughter. It’s a fine enough topic to shoot for but when scripted b 5 guys the whole thing feels forced and generally the film looks and sounds like it’s trying to be as funny as the first movie.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn’t live up to the hands in the air party vibe like the last time around. A blessed relief of Kanye West pumps up the cool and helps the film out but the songs aren’t as catchy or electric for this movie which doesn’t help the pacing a great deal. Also, I remember the first one being out there with sex, drugs and the like but this seems to go too far, a very open labour and foot scream of desperate clawing for OTT comedy…which no-one laughed at in my screening.\n\nThere are good moments though, there is still the same laughable chemistry between Byrne and Rogen, a frankly excellent confused spelling of sorority, the air bag idea is back with brilliant vengeance, the continuing void of parenting and dildo holding children is amusing and the little screen time of Dave Franco with Zac Efron is top notch. It’s a shame these positives feel mostly drowned out by a couple of needless gross out gags, a less exciting battle of the ages and emptiness of direction.\n\nSeth Rogen is no good actor but his gurgled laugh and stoner like way he appears in every movie is what he does best and it’s no different here. He plays off the twin girls playing Stella very well and likewise with Rose Byrne he builds a believable bond. Chloe Grace Moretz doesn’t lift the film much at all sadly, she’s trying with a character of hoping to aspire to be a stronger girl but her breaking out against the ‘sexist’ world isn’t that compelling like Zac Efron who feels stitched on just to get the cast back together, him debating his life and choices is a dull part of the runtime. Rose Byrne has great comedic timing and shows she can be gross and less than perfect, though everyone provides a smile they don’t feel connected as with ‘Bad Neighbours’.\n\nSorority Rising feels more like it’s sinking as a small amount of laughs is gravely felt in all places, making us realise what is wrong with the film, music, direction, writing and the fact it’s trying to crackle in the surprise way the first did.\n\n5.5/10\n\nAs Young Adult films go, this one is a wave of tired half baked ideas strung together in a nearly two hour feature that doesn’t excite for any further instalments or truly grip us in a new way for the danger of aliens taking over our planet. It’s hugely average at best and that’s the kindest statement I can muster.\n\nAfter being thrown in to meet Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) embarking through the woods to her first kill we take a few steps back to see how Earth has come to be so dangerous. A massive alien spaceship began moving over our world before halting and sending down four waves of plague like disasters that sent the planet into near oblivion. Cassie needs to get back to her little brother who’s been drafted in by army Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) to shoot down the enemy visitors before they take over and complete the 5th wave.\n\nTo be honest I wasn’t expecting much and thankfully I didn’t receive much either so that’s alright. It seems to be trying to take off sci-fi and the young adult brand into the stratosphere but even with technology and this ever present hostile threat hovering over the survivors heads, there never seems to be any spark about this story. The whole movie feels stretched and tired as if we’ve seen all of it before, either in better science fiction films or similar YA outings. I may severely dislike ‘Twilight’ but undeniably that took off in a big way and made vampires a trend for a long time. I can’t see this movie getting a following for the planned trilogy or wanting more of these never seen aliens that sit back hiding in human bodies.\n\nBased on a series of novels by Rick Yancey this plot doesn’t live up to the cool and dark ideas it could have played around with. I have never read or even seen the books but hopefully they’re not as weak as the screenplay suggests. Jeff Pinkner, Akiva Goldsman and Susannah Grant all miss the point as they unite to sketchily tell this tale of how a new Katniss figure must save her brother and fight back. The story is so bland and annoyingly predictable that what is clearly designed as a twist becomes a yawn moment because it’s seen from the very first moment and yet they don’t announce it until the last act. Also the whole romance angle is scripted like basic amateur hour leading to no heavyweight involvement for us into the characters we must follow.\n\nMore often than not, this film came across like a Nicholas Sparks creation, the gaping distance between two pretty white leads, the desperate background they must work against to get together. Maybe of course on a larger and more death defying scale but the film really felt like that genre more than the explosive sci-fi disaster theme it could and should have aimed for. That’s the thing, the idea isn’t terrible and the explanation of the waves however exploitative are actually interesting to watch unfold but then after that, all proceedings become a hashing of things most audiences have witnessed before.\n\nChloe Grace Moretz is likable as the lead and gives a feisty edge to Cassie when needed but then a lot of the time she’s subjected to gasping, staring into the distance or waiting for cardboard fantasy Evan to save the day. Alex Roe as Evan Walker becomes a laugh out loud character as his intentions/background are unveiled and he flits in and out of action when necessary to help the good guys progress. Nick Robinson has the forced upon good guy role and deals well with the quite bland character. As he leads his troops he portrays the weighty responsibility with conviction. Liev Schreiber is so steely eyed and typically army led that the secret is out as he rolls up with his crew, sorry for the spoilers but if you didn’t get it at that first point then this movie is like MENSA for you. I’m gutted Maika Monroe cropped up in this film, she looked cool and gave a neat bad ass touch but she too became bland as the obvious hardened softie. I thought she’d pick better films but alas.\n\nThis film falls flat and never picks itself back up again, whether it’s washed out with cheap effects or stalling along with obvious plot moments this dystopian release may as well be waved goodbye.\n\n4.5/10\n\nThis romantic comedy, titled for American audiences as the more awfully funky ‘Laggies’ is a so-so film. I mean this in the sense that it’s neither bad or great, it does as any expected film of this genre does and with a good enough direction from Lynn Shelton there’s the required amount of love and laughs for the desired audience member.\n\n28 years old and still stuck with old school friends and her prom sweetheart, Megan (Keira Knightley) is taken aback when her boyfriend Anthony (Mark Webber) proposes to her. In her still childish ways of not taking responsibilities or growing up she decides to go away for a week to try and fathom this big news. On the way, Megan crosses paths and buys booze for underage kids led by Annika (Chloe Grace Moretz) who she soon becomes a friend of, leading her to meet Annika’s dad Craig (Sam Rockwell) where the option of facing adulthood and a future could be more real.\n\nI doubt it’s any massive spoiler to say that it’s pretty clear what direction Megan ends up in, when faced with a new hunky figure and the old squeeze tying her down to past school memories. As I mentioned in the opening, there’s enough to keep the target audience satisfied, I am not in that demographic and so I can quite boldly say I wasn’t satisfied. A few moments make you smile and I cannot deny the empathy for Megan is there but it’s nothing special, a standard rom-com with no flair or huge comedy to tide you over.\n\nThough maybe there’s some funny in there somewhere, as the screen I shared with a mere other two, cracked up on multiple occasions. I seriously don’t know what they found so funny about a floating turtle but by heck did those two girls laugh enough to make it seem like there was more people watching the film. This movie’s saving grace is Sam Rockwell who just owns that look on his face that makes you prepare to bust your guts laughing, you don’t but he’s got that cool quirky single dad down to a T and he’s both funny and adorable as a loner left by ‘Boardwalk Empire’s’ Gretchen Mol.\n\nThere’s sadly nothing outstanding or even plainly interesting in the film, the music by Benjamin Gibbard is already forgotten, the attempts at laugh out loud moments never really fly, most are in fact pretty cringe; wedding dance or Knightley sign flipper dancing jump to mind as awkward moments. It would have been alright if the end had differed from the usual cliched romantic comedy story arcs but alas. All I ask is for a film in this category to come along and do something hugely significant to make the genre fresh and exciting.\n\nKeira Knightley is not an actress I’m a fan of anyway, but even I can appreciate she does a fine job of the slacker role needed in her character, to be honest I can even comment that she’s an actress I’m surprised took on this script considering how mediocre and plodding it is. Her high pitched accent doesn’t grate and works to an advantage in selling dumb layabout Megan more. Sam Rockwell is the spotlight and gem of the piece even without too much to do, he made me feel less terrible about coming out of seeing this movie. Chloe Grace Moretz has proved on more than one occasion that she has something, that spark, but Annika is not a character with much intrigue or substance for her to shine in.\n\nEvery now and then a shred of charm bounds onto the screen, a cool shiny modern art hanging fits the frame with a brilliant touch or the script begins floating towards something attention grabbing but on the most part this film is predictable tedium without any attempt to re-write the rom-com book. A lagging movie.\n\n5/10\n\nIt may have a slow opening with ample space to breathe into the life of Denzel Washington’s character but don’t let this kind of too long beginning fool you, as when Washington becomes the man he’s been hiding then you’re in for a whirlwind of loud noises and brutal dispatches.\n\nA friendly and extremely kind yet precise and ordered man by the name of McCall or Bob (Denzel Washington) has a job and a collection of literary classics to read but it’s clear there’s something deeper concerning his background. It takes the harsh female beating of diner chum and nighttime call girl Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) for this clinical and efficient side of Bob’s to surface. Though by getting involved in the prostitution circle Teri was trapped in, Bob now has to keep one step ahead of some imposing Russian gangsters led by Teddy (Marton Csokas) and become the man people rely on, the Equalizer.\n\nI’ve never seen the TV show, only ever heard of it, so I have no idea how close to the series this sticks apart from casting Denzel is a stark opposite to the original but he’s Denzel so he’s fantastic. If this movie, by employing a reasonable amount of slo-mo and defined extreme close ups resembles the style of the show then kudos and if not then they’ve mastered a stylish and crystal clear method to tell this action thriller story. Either way they win. Of course, not seeing the show from the 1980’s I don’t know if this plot in any way takes ideas or elements from an episode or episodes plural. It’s a good enough plot though even if it does fall back on the expected Russian vs American cliche. There’s a lot in the film to suspend your disbelief at too, let the awesome mind and tactics of McCall/Bob wash over you and you’ll mightily enjoy it, otherwise you may not.\n\nThe music was a stand out quality for me, that may or may not be because of the booming impact IMAX speakers have, but it certainly keeps up that edge of grungy suspenseful darkness which works in favour of the impending circle of Russian mobsters and the way in which McCall can flip in a matter of seconds between normal civilian to hard nosed killer. There were at least a few moments that got me sitting upright and only part of that is down to the newly installed stiff chairs in the screen. Be it extremely loud gunfights or bangs or nail biting scenes of tension this film does deliver on those points.\n\nIt’s a heck of a vehicle for demonstrating how tension can be done right, especially in the final climax between McCall and a host of Russian baddies. The closed and near pitch black setting of a B&Q style home depot store lets the tension settle into your skin like an unshakable rash of nerves. It might be like an adult version of ‘Home Alone’ but there’s no denying that the ways people die in this scene and the film in general are pretty dark and bloody.\n\nI think it’s up there as one of the better films to come out this year, it may have a Hollywood ending, it may not be thought inducing or subtle but it’s tense and racks up the revenge thriller reading to a number not identifiable on the dial. It’s obvious there’s a set up for sequels and that excites me because seeing what other insane ways this Equalizer can come up with to get even and serve justice like a real life Batman gives scope for more action and thrills. Some people might think it’s too long which I sort of agree with and others may think it’s too violent but it works for this character and the seedy world he got himself thrown into. A solid film that sells more so because of Washington as a star.\n\nDenzel Washington is pure badass in this film. It helps that he can demonstrate that nice guy next door vibe to really display the differences in mode his character has. The OCD angle to set up the past he had and the way he can deal with situations is acted lightly and well, pushing aside the sometime annoying CGI zooms and pans from his eyes to the room around him as he sees a way to come out on top. When he really does kick into gear and becomes the Equalizer he sells it completely, he’s even scary at times in the bold and brutal way he goes about offing people in his way. Chloe Grace Moretz of course has a top billing thanks to her status but she’s not in it much at all though in the very little screentime she gets she proves what a diverse talented actress she is. The big bad played Csokas is brooding and dominant in his crash course to find out who McCall is and stop him. It’s a steely almost inhuman look he possesses throughout and you never know how he’s going to react so top acting from him.\n\nI found it entertaining, delightfully violent to help the story along, it was a little too slow and long at times and of course it takes a lot to swallow but damn it, get a glass of water and swallow that pill of disbelief because it’s worth it. Kick-ass, almost non stop and tense to the last.\n\n7/10\n\nThe sequel to the fun and action packed 2010 movie is also just as fun and jam packed with action to blow you away in terms of superhero battles. It’s a vastly different change up of styles though and you can clearly tell there’s been a change of writer and director between the two which leads to some shortcomings.\n\nThis film has Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) trying to keep up with the normality of school life though she cannot help but train Kick-Ass (Aaron Taylor Johnson) as he wants to keep fit and fighting. The return of Red Mist now with a badder name in both senses of the word causes danger for those close to the fighting pair, though with the help of more vigilante heroes there becomes a proper degree of good vs evil.\n\n‘Kick-Ass’ was an answer to all the other superhero tales with the idea of what would happen if an ordinary person with no powers became a figure for good. It was silly and ironic fun with dark elements and a message that clearly fighting for justice in a costume doesn’t bode well, the sort of moral to stop people doing the same sort of thing after watching it. I was hoping for more of the same style when seeing this sequel at the cinema but in ‘Kick-Ass 2′ however, the ending leaves us thinking fighting for what is right is something worth doing however hard the obstacles may be. The lasting image doesn’t coincide with Dave (Kick-Ass’) voice over. He says you don’t need costumes and masks to protect the city and do good, that you should be who you are but then you see his new updated mask, so that doesn’t fit with what he’s saying, unless he really can’t see a way of walking the streets and fighting evil without dressing up.\n\nThis follow up certainly focuses a lot more on Chloe Grace Moretz, which is no bad thing as her Hit-Girl character is the highlight in both the films, though her youth from the first one made the impact of her strong violent sweary hero more daring. The story is simple and uses high school popularity systems to tell the underlying theme of identity. Unfortunately through the school plot and the bitchy plastics you get some pointless add ons that didn’t need to be added on. The whole dance try out wasn’t that called for, Mindy could have shown off her true nature some other way to impress the girls. Don’t get me started on the Union J section which was wrong, stretched out promotional piffle and utterly useless. You do feel sorry for Mindy Macready at one point when she feels the most normal but all along there’s no element of twist or surprise that she will choose Hit-Girl over Mindy, Hit-Girl is who she is. Big Daddy made her that, it’s clear that Macready is actually her alter ego. She’s a gritty ballsy character who didn’t deserve to be handed such poor scenes, the sick stick thing also jumps to mind as something going too far.\n\nThe highlights of the film lay with it’s addictive style and pumping soundtrack, it feels crazed like you’ve snorted a heap of coke and put the film on to watch. It’s manic and fast, the editing is slick and quick and the fight sequences are choreographed brilliantly, they are a step up to the set pieces in the original film. The battle between Hit-Girl and Mother Russia is awesome, the police car pile up on the suburban street is down right bonkers and Colonel Stars and Stripes busting a poker game is great.\n\nJim Carrey brings a layer of brilliance to the role in a film where his gurn face stays hidden and a softer more driven side for justice is shown. The character arc he’s given that mirrors the comic book is brutal and perfect for setting up the fight for good vs. evil. Ignoring Carrey’s choice to step down from promoting the film due to it’s violent nature. he played the gang leader well and has a charm and nicety to him that draws you in. Christopher Mintz-Plasse ramps up the wholly evil sneer and plays it over the top to really become an a-hole.\n\nThe final battle sequence could have been bigger and better, Hit-Girl and Mother Russia section aside, more mini fights within could have been shown, girly subplots aren’t a bad thing but when played with such pointless storytelling and a character development not needed, it becomes a random section of the film that takes away from the beginning which feels like the class of the first movie. ‘KIck-Ass 2’ sort of jolts up and down throughout like the director kept switching up styles trying to find out what suited him or the film best. The film is still fun but clearly revels in dialing the violence meter up to 11 and making it more insane than before.\n\nAn entertaining, enjoyable film with elements of gold that hark back to the first feature but with unneeded tack ons, excesses of profanity and shock that may fit in the graphic novel but not so much on screen.\n\n6.5/10"
