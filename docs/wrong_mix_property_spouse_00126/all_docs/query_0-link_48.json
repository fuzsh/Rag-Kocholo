        "text": "Welcome back to another exciting episode of Not A Bomb. This is the podcast where we go back and reexamine some of the biggest bombs in cinematic history and see if they deserve a second chance. On this week’s “epic” episode, we discuss yet another Ridley Scott film, 2005’s historical drama - Kingdom of Heaven (Director’s Cut). Based on a heavily fictionalized portrayal of the the Third Crusade, Kingdom of Heaven had mixed reviews and was a domestic flop on its initial release in May of 2005. Later that same year, Scott went back to the film and added back in 45 minutes of footage for a special showing on December 23rd in Los Angeles, California. The new director’s cut was embraced by the critics and eventually released on DVD. Most film enthusiasts consider this release to be the definitive version of the film. But do we agree, or is this just a bigger bomb?

That’s right, we are talking Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the fifth film in the Potty franchise and one of the bigger hits of the series. So how did the studio claim they lost money on a movie that almost made a billion dollars? Some creative “Hollywood Accounting”, that’s how! Brad and Troy do their best to explain how this accounting practice works and why studios use it. You also get to hear their thoughts on one of the most successful and belovied franchises of all time. Full disclsoure - Brad and Troy are novice Harry Potter fans and one of them hasn’t ever really liked the films outside of a single entry. Does this discussion change all of that?
