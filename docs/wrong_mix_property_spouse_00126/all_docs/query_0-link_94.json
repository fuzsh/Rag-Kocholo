        "text": "Eva Green is apparently too hot for ABC.\n\nThe network has rejected an ad for the upcoming Robert Rodriguez film “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,” because of two scenes in which the “Penny Dreadful” actress appears to be naked, a spokesperson for Dimension Films, the movie’s distributor, told TheWrap on Tuesday.\n\nDimension is appealing the network’s decision not to run the ad, the spokesperson added.\n\nSee video: ‘Sin City’ Women Kick Ass in ‘A Dame to Kill For’ Red Band Trailer\n\nIn the film, based on Frank Miller‘s “Sin City” graphic novels, Green portrays Ava Lord, who’s attempting to escape her abusive husband, Damien Lord (played by Marton Csokas).\n\nABC has not responded to TheWrap’s request for comment.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Green’s depiction of Lord has caused problems among the modesty-minded; according to the New York Post, Dimension altered a poster featuring Green, after the MPAA complained that the sheer gown she was wearing in the photo offered a too-revealing glimpse of the actress.\n\nSee video: ‘Sin City: A Dame to Kill For’ Clip Spotlight’s Jessica Alba’s Startling Transformation (Video)\n\nThe Post reported that the MPAA shot down the poster “for nudity” — specifically, “curve of under breast and dark nipple/areola circle visible through sheer gown.”"
