        "text": "The Opening Gallery (42 Walker Street, Manhattan) was launched as an initiative that supports contemporary art and international artists beyond the confines of the art market while it fosters cultural engagement and exchanges between the US and the globe. This alternative art ecosystem attempts to go beyond prevalent gallery models and to showcase globally underrepresented artists and the work of women artists and artists of color. In addition, 50% of the proceeds support neurodiversity and charitable causes, and 25% of the proceeds are donated to the non-profit Luv Michael, which is committed to enriching the lives of autistic adults.\n\nTHE OPENING ART INITIATIVE:\n\nThe conceptual framework of the Opening Art Initiative focuses on the importance of human agency, creativity and self-expression as a means to self-realization. The Opening encourages individuals to embrace the possibilities and challenges of life with courage and creative determination. In the context of mental health, The Opening Art Initiative has been designed as an aperture for the lives of autistic employees.\n\nThe Opening Art Initiative consists of the A) Opening Gallery, B) The Opening Art Workshops and C) The Opening Public Program:\n\nA) “The Opening Gallery” in Luv Michael’s flagship location in Tribeca, NY. The gallery presents approximately twelve exhibitions and installations yearly, along with performances, performance based lectures, live and music events that typically last for one month curated by Sozita Goudouna, Phd. The cultural events highlight neurodiverse artists and explore complex concepts in neurodiversity in the arts.\n\nEach month, our Luv Michael participants are treated to a personalized, interactive experience with some of the featured artists. Moreover, 25 percent of the proceeds on the sale of the art is donated to Luv Michael by each of the artists.\n\nFrom July 2022 the gallery has presented more than a hundred prominent and emerging US and international artists who support our mission. Please follow The Opening Gallery for information about the past and current exhibit and the various, unique cultural experiences organized by Dr Goudouna at 42 Walker Street throughout the month: https://www.theopeninggallery.com\n\nB) The Opening Art Initiative provides educational workshops in collaboration with the granologists who co-create artworks with preeminent and emerging artists.\n\nC) The Opening Public Program invites the granologists to participate in public art programs in collaboration with partnering institutions and artists throughout New York. Our first public program is launched this summer at Governor’s Island in collaboration with artist Georgia Lale.\n\nEXHIBITION PROGRAM JULY 2022 — APRIL 2023\n\nTHE OPENING GALLERY 42 WALKER ST, 10013, NEW YORK\n\nCHROMOCOMMONS\n\nGroup Exhibition\n\nShoplifter/ Hrafnhildur Arnardóttir\n\nThe Callas / Lakis & Aris Ionas\n\nMisha Milovanovich\n\nTula Plumi\n\nLeah Singer\n\nOPENING: Tuesday May 16 • 6–8pm\n\nLIVE PERFORMANCE BY THE CALLAS AND THE CALLASETTES: Dance by Daphne Kyriakidou with Irene Zografou and Dionisia Bosmi presenting their hand woven wearable tapestries created by The Callas.\n\nExhibition run dates: May 16 — June 12, 2023 • 12–6pm\n\nCuration & main text: Sozita Goudouna, PhD\n\nThe Opening Gallery is pleased to present the Group Exhibition Chromocommons featuring Fathom a selection of new works by Shoplifter/Hrafnhildur Arnardóttir and works by the artist collective The Callas, Misha Milovanovich, Leah Singer and Tula Plumi curated by Sozita Goudouna.\n\nThe exhibition coincides with the release of a unique publication by Leah Singer and a signed limited edition, as well as a series of numbered prints. The history of art is inseparable from the history of color and this history is also a shared history. Chromocommons presents and puts on display sculptures, two-dimensional pieces, and live acts that explore the ways colors hint at connectivity and the ways they can be commons that enable us to create and live differently.\n\nVisual perception is one of the most important mediums for our acquisition of knowledge and for our experience of our environment, of the physical world including our own bodies and others, while color is one of the most dominant components of our perception. Nevertheless, the physical world and the world of objects do not contain color and aren’t colored as we experience them. Color isn’t a physical property of objects; thus, our blood is not red, the sea isn’t blue, the trees aren’t green.\n\nFundamentally, color suggests and implies connectivity and commonality since it exists only through connectivity. As Maurice Merleau- Ponty states ‘Claudel has a phrase saying that a certain blue of the sea is so blue that only blood would be more red. The color is yet a variant in another dimension of variation, that of its relations with the surroundings: this red is what it is only by connecting up from its place with other reds about it, with which it forms a constellation, or with other colors it dominates or that dominate it, that it attracts or that attract it, that it repels or that repel it. In short, it is a certain node in the woof of the simultaneous and the successive. It is a concretion of visibility, it is not an atom.’[1] The color appearance of an object can be changed by changing the color of light that shines on it and the color of visible light depends on its wavelength. White light is composed of all of the colors of the rainbow, because it contains all wavelengths, and it is described as polychromatic light. Color glows with the light of the radiant sun and creates a relentless spectacle of sheer visibility, of an intense luminosity that can even be blinding. Drawing from our different perceptions of color, color vision deficiency and even “achromatopsia” (total color blindness), the participating artists trace common interpretations of the notion of color as sensation, visual and sensorial experience, psychological property of visual experiences, mental property, representation, construction of the brain, but most importantly the formulation of commons through color perception.\n\nThe Shoplifter: Fathom\n\nSynthetic and natural hair has become the signature art material of the Icelandic artist Hrafnhildur Arnardóttir, also known as Shoplifter. Each strand of hair is a drawing, the gestures of lines on a paper that have come to life existing as sculpture and colorful suspended three-dimensional paintings made with fibers. The fibers are tamed and transformed from their original intent into various artwork from braided and tufted wall work to her large-scale installations and small, microscopic curiosities mixed with other materials like handblown organically shaped glass capsules entrapping the fibers in her most recent series of work Phantoms. The Fathoms seem to sprout and grow of their own accord from the gallery ceiling, a floating forest. The hair is divided between the human-made and natural and within this installation that dichotomy seems to have completely dissolved. This world of Fathoms feels both universal and microscopic, you could be walking through nebulae or through synapses within your own mind. “Fathom” in English means to grasp or be able to dream or imagine something and is an old unit for measuring, from one palm of your hand the other. That same word, Faðmur in Icelandic, means to embrace or hug. The artist’s inspiration lies deep within her fascination with fibers, the texture, and colors that the artist selects, entangles and tames. The results a wild and brilliant chromatic ecstasy that makes you feel comforted, joyous, and embraced on a multi-sensory level. The colors penetrate the retina and trigger the neurons in the brain that automatically start producing oxytocin, the body’s feel-good hormones, and together with its alluring and familiar texture we can be affected by the maximalism of her creativity.\n\nArtist Bio: Shoplifter / Hrafnhildur Arnardóttir is one of Iceland’s leading contemporary artists, based in New York. Working with both synthetic and natural hair, her sculptures, wall murals and site-specific installations explore themes of vanity, self-image, fashion, beauty and popular myth. For Shoplifter hair is the ultimate thread that grows from our body. Hair is an original, creative fiber, a way for people to distinguish themselves as individuals, and often an art form. Humor plays a large role in her life and work, sometimes subtly, but at other times taking over. Shoplifter represented Iceland at the Venice Biennale in 2019 and her installation Chromo Sapiens opened at the Icelandic Pavilion in May 2019 in Venice, Italy. The installation later traveled to Iceland opening at the Reykjavik Art Museum in January 2020. Other recent work includes solo exhibitions at Kulturhuset Stadsteatern in Stockholm, Sweden (2020), The Savannah Collage of Art and Design in Georgia (2020), Kiasma, the Finnish National Gallery (2019), the National Gallery of Iceland (2017), the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles (2017) and the Queensland Art Gallery of Modern Art in Australia (2016). Notable projects and awards include her large window installation created in collaboration with art collective assume vivid astro focus (avaf) for MoMA, Museum of Modern Art in New York (2008), The Nordic Award in Textiles and The Prince Eugen Medal for artistic achievement from the King and Royal Crown of Sweden (2011).\n\nThe Callas / Lakis & Aris Ionas: Embroiderism Now!\n\nAt “Chromocommons,” The Callas / Lakis & Aris Ionas, present a new and older body of hand embroidered tapestries. The pieces are designed by Lakis & Aris and crafted by their mother Ioanna and their aunt Anastasia, who are mostly based and work at The Callas farm (a DIY lab / studio / festival space / warehouse among olive and orange trees) in Thermissia, Peloponnese. Their influences ranging from Thomas Pynchon’s helter skelter structures to Cycladic architecture, and from the No Wave scene to Rebetiko DIY recordings alluding to a freak-out blend of Mediteranean Psychladic collective creativity. During the opening night the open collective will present a new series of hand woven wearable tapestries and a live gig/performance by The Callas featuring The Callasettes. Embroiderism Now!\n\nArtist Bio: The Callas / Lakis & Aris Ionas The Callas is the tip of an open art collective that produces artworks, films and music initiated by the brothers Lakis & Aris Ionas. Selected art shows and collaborations include: Onassis Stegi (Athens, 2022), New Museum (NYC) — DESTE foundation (Athens) / Benaki Museum, Documenta 14, Palais de Tokyo (Paris), The Opening Gallery (New York), Family Business (NY), Athens Biennial (Athens), Andreas Melas Projects (Athens), State Of Concept (Athens), The Breeder (Athens), Kustera Projects (New York), Atopos CVC (Athens), Yinka Shonibare Space (London) among others. The collective has collaborated with Lee Ranaldo (Sonic Youth) and Jim Sclavunos (Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds) on music albums and live performances. In 2013 The Callas produced the film “LUSTLANDS” (HAOS film) that premiered at the 7th Athens Avant-Garde Film Festival. Their feature film “The Great Eastern” premiered at Onassis foundation — Stegi and Documenta 14.”The Great Eastern,” shot at DESTE’s foundation project space — Slaughterhouse in Hydra, premiered at Onassis foundation — Stegi and was screened at Documenta 14. Their recent film “SICK” was selected and premiered at Thessaloniki International Film Festival. Live performances include: Liverpool Psychedelic Festival (Liverpool), The Great Escape Festival (Brighton), Reeperbhan Festival (Hamburg), Indietracks Festival (Derby), Indigenes Festival (Nantes, France), Scala (London), The Lexington (London), Sala Apolo (Barcelona) and with the Thurston Moore band, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Ty Segall, Television Personalities, Ian F. Svenonius and Grinderman. “Velvet Room” was established by The Callas in 2005 as one of the most active D.I.Y. cultural spaces/collectives in the center of Athens. The open collective curated some of the most seminal artzines in Athens (Velvet magazine, LUST magazine). They have also curated 5 bus tours/events throughout Greece with bands, artists, and filmmakers (Velvet Bus 2008–2011). According to OCULA Art and Stephanie Bailey “So many things have shaped the landscape of contemporary art in Greece since the 2000s, from the Athens Biennale’s agitprop and Dakis Joannou’s DESTE Foundation’s summertime slaughterhouse shows on Hydra, to Gregory Markopoulos’ unfolding magnum opus in Arcadia, Eniaios. Then there’s The Callas.” in https://ocula.com/magazine/features/the-callas-drop-lsd-in-athens/\n\nMisha Milovanovich: Noir\n\nMisha Milovanovich’s new work for the Opening Gallery comprise of a one-of-a-kind sculpture. The sculpture is a fusion of fragmented cubism, biomorphic surrealism, and dynamic visual humor, and infused with shamanic force, which pays homage to the natural world. “The artist’s latest work, crafted from Finnish Baltic Birch plywood and shellack, is a playful exploration of historical references that reimagines their antecedents, unleashing new prospects for the interpretation and significance of abstract forms in space.” These Noir sculptures often embody organic contours and textures, evocative of natural shapes such as animals and plants. In addition to these influences, Misha’s work draws inspiration from Japanese aesthetics and design principles, exemplified through simplicity, asymmetry, and the use of negative space and use of angle in joints. The new sculptures possess a unique quality of reflection, almost as if they were shadows cast by a hidden light source. This aspect of the sculptures adds an extra layer of depth and intrigue to their already captivating design, drawing the viewer’s attention and encouraging a closer examination of the pieces. The interplay of light and shadow on the organic forms of the sculptures creates a dynamic visual experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who sees them.\n\nArtist Bio: Misha Milovanovich Misha Milovanovic is a Belgrade-born artist based in London. She works across several mediums, from sculpture to painting and digital art. Characterized by vivid color, optical movement and energetic visual cadences, Misha’s visual work fuses a diverse repertoire of images and forms. Misha’s work is often a symphonic abstraction. Her colorful, densely layered works are held in a state of tension between order and chaos, rational structure and spontaneity. She combines depth and surface relief, orchestrating bold contrasts of form, texture, and space in her pictures. An intimate color palette of bodily fluids — red, pink, white, black, yellow, and brown — animate the writhing forms and the refracted memories of cartoonish cultural production. A cultural polymath, the artist is constantly engaged in observing society and it’s distortions of desire, lust and attitudes to the body. Traditional techniques have been studied and absorbed and although her work is partly conceptual, it’s execution always reflects these hard-won technical abilities.\n\nLeah Singer: The Ruby Drawings In 1915 the Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin wrote a groundbreaking paper on form perception and introduced the study of figure/ground relationships. Rubin’s widely known black and white profile and vase illustration, used in the study, tricks the viewer into a back and forth of seeing either two profiles facing each other, or the shape of a vase formed in the center. Rubin discovered that in ambiguous drawings like this, the figure always dominates over ground and its what we see first. Willem De Kooning, although a pioneer of abstract expressionism, did not forsake the figure in his work and was criticized in his time for depicting women as harsh and unflattering. He said, “Beauty becomes petulant to me. I like the grotesque. It’s more joyous.” The Ruby Drawings are a mash up of silhouettes cut from rubylith — a masking film resistant to UV light used in the printing process to isolate parts of a photograph. The rubyliths were byproducts of newspaper production and were collected when I worked as a photographic archivist at the New York Daily News. The cut silhouettes have been scanned and used in groups to build enigmatic forms. The introduction of intersecting color further distorts the figure to ground connection. The amassed library of rubylith images has served in many of my projects including my copy newspapers — all graphic silhouettes with no text — produced at small printing presses across the country. As much as there is a formality to these works, a concern with form and color, figure and ground and a suggestion of the figurative inside the abstract, they were done quickly without too much deliberation to maintain a sense of play and spontaneity.\n\nArtist Bio: Leah Singer Leah Singer’s ever-evolving body of work includes film, sculpture, photography, printmaking, book publishing, product design, illustration, and jewelry. Her experiments with 16mm film provided her with a signature style that further evolved through her use of modified projectors during live musical performances. An interest in the silhouette grew from a self-published newspaper she made called copy. The paper was critically acclaimed; it is in the artist book collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. A limited collection of tote bags under the copy label sold at: Colette (Paris), A.P.C. (Paris, New York, Tokyo), Printed Matter (New York), and The New Museum Bookstore (New York). The newspapers popularity led to invitations from Nike to work on a New York City Runner’s Map followed by other projects such as the holiday visuals for a department store in Tokyo, the windows of Barneys New York’s flagship store, and t-shirt graphics for the Beijing Olympics. Her artwork has shown worldwide at such institutions as: Magasin3, Stockholm; Centre Pompidou, Paris; MACBA, Barcelona; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. She lives in New York City with her husband and frequent collaborator Lee Ranaldo (Sonic Youth) and their two sons.\n\nTula Plumi’s Light in January and Light in March are made of thin bamboo sticks glued together, creating surfaces that are painted with different colors and forms. A light is attached to each piece, creating a play on shadows and references to visual phenomena such as eclipses. The titles refer to W. Faulkner’s novel Light in August.\n\nArtist Bio: Tula Plumi was born in 1980 in Heraklion, Crete and currently lives and works in Berlin. She has studied at Athens School of Fine Arts. Recent shows include: Overturned at Art Geneve, Weavings at Museum Benaki 2019 Athens, Bed Manners at Kunstpunkt, Berlin 2019; Jelato for all, Jelato gallery, Mallorca 2019, A Museum — A History of 100 Years — Museum of Modern Greek Culture, Athens 2018. Her work has been shown at Musee national d’art modern Centre Pompidou, Emst National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens, Daimler Contemporary, Berlin; Kunsthalle Athena, Athens Biennale 3.\n\nThe Opening Gallery was launched as an initiative that supports contemporary art and international artists beyond the confines of the art market, while it fosters cultural engagement and exchanges between the US and the globe.

Opening Saturday, April 22 at 42 Walker Street, this will be the artist’s first significant foray into painting.\n\nThe exhibition celebrates the release of Confessions: a highly distinctive artistic collaboration between Serrano and the acclaimed poet Gabriele Tinti.\n\nSerrano is one of the world’s most renowned photographers. His new works mark a departure from the medium with which he is most closely associated, while also exemplifying the imagination and critical intelligence that he has always brought to bear upon it. They originated as oil pastel drawings that Serrano\n\nmade over black and white photographs of sculptures by Michelangelo, in a process that he likens to automatic writing: “The resulting images are different from the pictures that inspired them,” he writes, “but I hope the spirit of Michelangelo is there.”\n\nSerrano’s Confessions images amount to a formidable engagement not only with an artistic predecessor, but also, like so much of his work, with Christian iconography. Embodying a very particular kind of beauty, they lend a new emotional force to ostensibly familiar artistic depictions of religious narratives.\n\nSerrano’s collaboration with Gabriele Tinti has led to a haunting meditation on religion, violence, and physicality. Tinti, author of the Montale Prize-winning\n\nthe opening gallery | eris.art\n\n42 walker st, NY, 10013\n\ncollection Ruins, has produced a sequence of poems that are as remarkable for their lyrical expressiveness as for their forceful compactness. Often disquieting and always uncompromising in their vision of the human capacity to do harm and be harmed, these poems are Tinti’s most impressive body of work to date.\n\nA deluxe, signed, numbered special edition will be available for sale at the exhibition, and the launch event will feature a reading of selected poems from Confessions by the actor Vincent Piazza (Boardwalk Empire, Jersey Boys).\n\nAndres Serrano is an American artist. Renowned for his ambitious and challenging installations, he has won acclaim for series of photographs including America (“the photographs give such vivid presence to their sub- jects that it is hard not to feel genuinely moved” — The New York Times) and Torture (“both a call for justice and a compassionate portrayal of the human plight” — The Guardian).\n\nGabriele Tinti is an Italian poet and writer. He has worked with the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Metropoli- tan Museum of Art, and the British Museum (among many other institutions), and his poems have been performed by actors including Abel Ferrara, Malcolm\n\nThe Opening Gallery was launched as an initiative that supports contemporary art and international artists be- yond the confines of the art market, while it fosters cul- tural engagement and exchanges between the US and the globe.

The (SNFPHI) awardee will present his research on Shadow Theater in a workshop at Columbia University:\n\nhttps://snfphi.columbia.edu/events/research-into-the-shadows-karagiozis-in-asia-minor/\n\nAn evening of performance, visual art and sharing across disciplines during Spyros Aggelopoulos’ live act of “Vaskania.” Aggelopoulos’ performance will critically address the different ways contemporary art can re-envision the traditional genre of Shadow Theater.\n\nAggelopoulos’ “Vaskania” is dedicated to new methods of fortune-telling. In the same way that the artist reshuffles “Shadow Theater” techniques and conventions he reinterprets the custom of drinking coffee followed by having one’s fortune told from the leftover coffee grounds in the cup.\n\nCuration: Dr. Sozita Goudouna\n\nPlease scroll down for more information.\n\nShadow theater has a long tradition in Greece and the East. Karagioz, the folk hero, personifies the Ordinary Guy Archetype, a bit naïve, a bit of a rascal, poor and beaten-up, trying to survive against the odds by utilizing folk wisdom and tons of luck. In Aggelopoulos’s shadow theater, a mash-up of politicians, media figures, superheroes, cinema characters, and villains — from Donald Trump and Slavoj Žižek to Rocky and Freddy Kruger — competes in an imaginary arena. The big game of dominance of one hero against the other is no less fearsome than in a trading magic card children’s game. Like a true folk artist, Aggelopoulos creates a cosmogony of epic dimensions with contemporary deities and heroes, which break the boundaries of physics and escape a Media Universe (like Marvel’s) in order to reign in our imaginary in the same way Kruger reigns in the dream-realm. Place your bets on the winner.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe performance is realized with the support and partnership of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Public Humanities Initiative (SNFPHI) at Columbia University:\n\nhttps://snfphi.columbia.edu/projects/\n\nThis workshop at Columbia University explores the role of historical research in shadow theater. SNFPHI awardee Spyros Aggelopoulos discusses with historian Christine Philliou (UC Berkeley) and Columbia faculty a new play Karagiozis in Asia Minor, the outcome of a collaboration with scholars from Turkey and Greece. How might shadow theater become a vehicle for popularizing knowledge on early 20th century identity in Anatolia, the Greek-Turkish War, and the subsequent exchange of populations? How can collaborative work between artists and scholars inspire and inform the form and content of shadow theater?\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Sakıp Sabancı Center for Turkish Studies, the Program in Hellenic Studies, and Greece in USA.\n\n*The Opening Gallery was launched in the summer of 2022 as an initiative that supports contemporary art and international artists beyond the confines of the art market, while it fosters cultural engagement and exchanges between the US and the globe.

Wizara and the non-profit organization Greece in USA support the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition explores tradition, mythology, and recurring symbolism, as it looks at icons and narratives in today’s changing Arab world. Ahaad Alamoudy’s videos utilize underground pop-Saudi songs as scaffolding to build contemporary artworks that look at consumerism and investigate economic and aesthetic change across a shifting class system.\n\nObaid Al Safi uses artificial intelligence and code to reinterpret ancient Arabian poems. Through a complex process that shuttles back and forth between art and technology, he turns visuals into sound and turns sound into an elusive and fleeting moving image.\n\nMariam Sadik takes the female Arab body as a terrain of investigation. She looks at the impact of dating apps on marriage and love in what she describes as the marriage market as she grapples with her self-image as a careful social construct.\n\nOmar Houssien travels through Ancient Egypt, asking what if ancient Gods lived today? What would they represent in modern-day Egypt, how would we paint images of their likeness, and what would such images invoke?\n\nAn unconventional survey of artistic positions and change in the Arabic-speaking region and its diaspora, this exhibition invites us to journey, question, doubt and laugh through the work of four incredible artists.\n\nThe second annual New York Arab Festival (NYAF) 2023 Edition takes place in venues across NYC from April 7 through early May to honor and celebrate Arab American Heritage Month, which coincides with Ramadan this year. New York Arab Festival (NYAF) is programming multiple live in-person events in partnership with several pioneering institutions across NYC, the USA, and internationally.\n\nAbout New York Arab Festival (NYAF)\n\nNew York Arab Festival (NYAF) was established in 2022 to celebrate Arab American Heritage Month, and to fight the erasure of Arab and Arab American identities from New York City, a place that Arabs have called home for over three centuries. NYAF is a multidisciplinary festival of art, culture, design, food, philosophy, and intersecting industries. It programs artists from the entire Arabic-speaking region, the Arab diaspora, and Arab American artists, particularly artists working and living in New York City.

The exhibition coincides with the release of a beautifully produced second edition of the book, and a signed limited edition, as well as a series of numbered prints.\n\nI Declare a Permanent State of Happiness is a remarkable engagement with one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century, Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.\n\nWritten as a series of numbered propositions, Wittgenstein’s treatise is an ambitious attempt to elucidate the relationship of language to logic and to reality. Goldsmith’s response to the text is a testament to the highly distinctive artistic vision that characterizes all of his work. Inspired by the Tractatus but also boldly inventive, Goldsmith’s images reveal the breadth and depth not just of Wittgenstein’s genius, but also of the intervening artist’s creative fervor.\n\nCollages, drawings, sketches, handwritten comments, blacked-out and blanched text, shopping receipts and scans-within-scans — these are some of the techniques that appear in this body of work. The exhibition will put on display the most dazzling of the original artworks reproduced in Goldsmith’s book. Innovatively presented in the Opening Gallery’s stunning exhibition space, this is a unique opportunity to witness an extraordinary form of creative and intellectual dialogue. The exhibition is curated by Sozita Goudouna and Alex Stavrakas.\n\nOriginal works, as well as the second edition of I Declare a Permanent State of Happiness, will be available for sale, together with copies of a deluxe limited edition of the same book, and prints.\n\nKenneth Goldsmith lives and works in New York City. He teaches writing at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1996, he founded UbuWeb (http://ubu.com), the largest site for the free distribution of avant-garde materials, and in 2013 he was named as the inaugural Poet Laureate of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In addition to I Declare a Permanent State of Happiness, his books include Wasting Time on the Internet and Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of UbuWeb, the latter of which was awarded the 2020 Prix François Morellet.\n\nGoldsmith’s recent artistic works are among the most powerful and provocative to have appeared in the last few years. HILLARY: The Hillary Clinton Emails was displayed in conjunction with the Venice Biennale at the Despar Teatro Italia in 2019. It turned the seemingly banal act of printing out the former presidential candidate’s leaked emails into a widely discussed installation that was as notable for its conceptual brilliance as for its underlying political statement. Goldsmith’s ongoing project Retyping a Library was displayed at the Lofoten International Art Festival in 2022.\n\nThe Opening Gallery was launched as an initiative that supports contemporary art and international artists beyond the confines of the art market, while it fosters cultural engagement and exchanges between the US and the globe.
