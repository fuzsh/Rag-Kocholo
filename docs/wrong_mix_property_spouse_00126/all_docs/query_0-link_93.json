        "text": "Top: Eva is Daniel Craig's love interest in Casino Royale. Below: playmates Eva and Joy, in Paris aged six.\n\n11 April 2012\n\nShe is the actress whose stunning beauty beguiles James Bond in his latest blockbuster adventure, Casino Royale.\n\nAnd, as these exclusive pictures show, Eva Green even has the credentials to be a double agent - as she is one of twins.\n\n• Video: Eva on her raunchy sex scene with Daniel Craig • Grumpy Bond: licensed to scowl\n\n• Gallery: James Bond Casino Royale World Premiere\n\n• Casino Royale set to smash box office record\n\nBut though the sisters have similar Bond-girl looks, that is where the likenesses end for Eva and her twin, Joy.\n\nFor while one has been given a licence to thrill as 007's love interest in the new film, the other prefers the quiet life.\n\nLast week Eva, 26, arrived with her sister in London for the world premiere of the new 007 movie. As the actress basked in the adulation of thousands of fans in Leicester Square, Joy melted into the background.\n\nNow the twins' Swedish father, dentist Walter Green, has spoken for the first time about his daughters and revealed that in spite of their similar looks and upbringing, in temperament and personality they could not be more different.\n\n\"They are opposites,' said Walter, 66. \"While Eva likes to be in the city, Joy loves the countryside and her horses. They didn't get on as teenagers but Joy is now very proud of Eva. They're very close.\"\n\nThe twins' mother, French actress Marlene Jobert, gave birth to them by Caesarean on July 5, 1980. Eva arrived a minute before Joy.\n\nThe girls went to a bilingual school in Paris and spent holidays in England, Ireland and America, perfecting their English.\n\nRead More\n\n'This is my decade': Corrie's Cleaver intends to have 'fun' in her 60s\n\nEkin-su addresses Davide split on Celebrity Big Brother: 'He hurt me'\n\nWomen’s Aid condemns Celebrity Big Brother’s decision to include Gary Goldsmith\n\nSponsored\n\nMeet the fitness influencer defying stereotypes about ageing\n\nEva displayed a talent for music and theatre and they both learned to ride but Eva 'didn't have any fun', according to her father. \"She was too shaky and didn't have a feeling for horses, whereas Joy loved them.\"\n\nAfter leaving school Joy went to business college. She now breeds horses in Normandy with her Italian husband.\n\nEva studied drama in Paris and then in London, where she won a place at the Webber Douglas drama academy. She made her name with a steamy role in the 2003 Bernardo Bertolucci film The Dreamers.\n\nThe film's incest theme provoked a storm of controversy and Eva appeared naked or topless in many scenes. \"My sister didn't like it at all,' she later admitted.\n\nWalter also felt uncomfortable with the film. \"It was a bit difficult,' he said. \"It wasn't really my cup of tea.\"\n\nBut he is a fan of the new Bond movie in which Eva plays agent Vesper Lynd opposite Daniel Craig's Bond.\n\nWalter said: \"I was very impressed. Eva has a very nice role. She has had some help from Marlene, who is a very good teacher.\"\n\nEva is dating New Zealand actor Marton Csokas, 20, whom she met on the set of the 2005 film Kingdom Of Heaven, and lives in London.\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
