        "text": "Award-winning actress Eva Green is set to star in a brand new BBC series called The Luminaires.\n\nThe series is a TV adaptation of Eleanor Catton’s novel, which won the prestigious Man Booker Prize for fiction in 2013, making her not only the youngest ever nominated, but the youngest ever recipient of the literary award.\n\nThe James Bond actress will star in the six-part series, alongside Marton Csokas which will air on BBC Two in the UK – while Eve Hewson, who starred in The Kick has also joined the cast.\n\nThe novel is set on New Zealand’s South Island and follows a community of people steeped in mystery against the backdrop of the 1860s goldrush with filming set to commence in November.\n\nCatton is part of the project, and alongside Claire McCarthy they adapted the novel, with Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner penned as executive producers.\n\nThe 38-year-old actress is no stranger to period pieces. Green played the arresting Vanessa Ives in the gothic supernatural horror Penny Dreadful, and it seems she’s swapping her little black Bond dress for corsets once more.\n\n‘Eleanor has written a series of brilliant screenplays,’ Green said, excited about her new role. ‘I loved her original novel and it’s so exciting that her own screen adaptation reveals yet more exquisite material.’\n\nMcCarthy added: ‘Ever since I read Eleanor’s incredible novel I’ve been completely captivated by the rich world she has created.\n\n‘What an honor to bring this beautiful and original work to the screen.’\n\nMORE : Joaquin Phoenix looks pale and gaunt as he’s seen for the first time on set as the Joker"
