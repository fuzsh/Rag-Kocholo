A headshot of Balian of Ibelin from Kingdom of Heaven accompanied with the following:\n\nTo: Andie\n\nxoxo Orlando Bloom\n\nP.S. — Thank you for the beautiful necklace.\n\nMonths earlier, 11-year-old me had found a Los Angeles address in the back of some J-14 or Tiger Beat magazine for Orlando Bloom’s fanmail. I eagerly wrote him pages and pages of infatuation and admiration.\n\nMost importantly, I wanted him to know that my favorite film of his wasn’t Pirates of the Caribbean like it was for all the other girls at school. My favorite was Kingdom of Heaven. I wrote about his nuanced performance, the heart of the character of Balian, and how impressive I found all that the movie captured.\n\nI had also beaded a necklace for him since I read in that issue that he loved to wear “chunky jewelry,” hence the postscript on the autograph.\n\nI was content to never get a response. I just needed him to know that I saw his performance. I appreciated it deeply — even if the world didn’t."
