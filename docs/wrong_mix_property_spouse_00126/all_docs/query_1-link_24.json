        "text": "Birth Name: Eva GaÃ«lle Green\n\nDate of Birth: 5th. July, 1980\n\nBirth Place: Paris, France\n\nMother: French actress MarlÃ¨ne Jobert\n\nFather: Swedish dentist Walter Green\n\nSiblings: A fraternal twin sister named Joy, who was born two minutes earlier than she was.\n\nSchooling: Green was raised in France, and spent some time in Ramsgate, London and Ireland. Her school was English-speaking. Green was quiet at school, and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven.At 17, Green enrolled at Eva St. Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, and then spent 10 weeks at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Green stated that at drama school, \"I always picked the really evil roles. It's a great way to deal with your everyday emotions.\" Green trained at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in New York City, before she returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays.\n\nStart of Career: Green aspired to become an actress at age fourteen, when she saw Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H.. Jobert initially feared the effect an acting career would have on her sensitive daughter, but she soon supported her ambitions.\n\nDirector Bernardo Bertolucci discovered Green in 2002, and found her \"so beautiful, it's indecent\". She accepted his invitation to star in The Dreamers (2003), despite her parents' initial objections because of Maria Schneider's accounts of being traumatized while filming Bertolucci's Last Tango in Paris.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nGreen considers herself nerdy: \"When people first meet me, they find me very cold. I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to [acting]. It allows me to wear a mask.\" She moved to Primrose Hill, London in mid-2005, She prefers the \"village-like\" atmosphere of the London neighbourhood: \"I feel more centred when I'm [there].\" She lives alone, jokingly referring to her border terrier, Griffin, as her \"husband\". She is an atheist, having not been raised to follow any religion. She has dated New Zealand actor Marton Csokas since she met him on the set of Kingdom of Heaven. For three years their relationship was a long distance one, until he moved from Australia to London to live with her.\n\nShe has no particular fitness regimen, because, \"I'm French and I'm lazy, which means I smoke and I don't exercise\", though she does run and she practices pilates. Green finds dieting too stressful. She thinks of herself as an international actress: she can speak both her native French and English fluently, and is also learning Japanese as well as perfecting an American accent.\n\nGreen's favourite film is Cries and Whispers, and she is a fan of directors FranÃ§ois Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, Tim Burton, Lars von Trier, David Lynch, and David Fincher. She admires the actresses Lauren Bacall, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, Jeanne Moreau, Cate Blanchett, Juliette Binoche, and Helena Bonham Carter. She credits Blanchett and Kirsten Dunst as her fashion influences, describing her own taste as, \"bright pink lipstick, hot pink or geisha colors. Make up is allowed to be a bit weird, I feel.\" Her favourite artists are Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, and she is a keen museum visitor; she particularly likes Chinese and Indian architecture, and framed displays of butterflies and other insects. Green enjoys music, listening to film soundtracks and classical music when preparing for roles, and she plays the piano.\n\nFilms:\n\n2003 The Dreamers\n\n2004 ArsÃ¨ne Lupin\n\n2005 Kingdom of Heaven\n\n2006 Casino Royale\n\n2007 The Golden Compass\n\n2009 Franklyn\n\nCracks completed\n\n2010 Womb post-production\n\nThe Last Word filming"
