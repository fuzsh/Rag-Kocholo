        "text": "Review : Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)\n\nSPOILER ALERT : SPOILERS FOLLOWING / DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS MOVIE SPOILED PRIOR TO SEEING IT\n\nIt took a while for me to warm up to the MCU as a phenomenon and an overarching concept. The first run of movies from Captain America, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, The Avengers and even Guardians of the Galaxy, while entertaining enough, weren’t necessarily films that I went crazy for (with the exception of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which is great on a foundational level). Oddly enough, it was perhaps the first big misstep for the MCU in terms of public opinion, Avengers: Age of Ultron, that piqued my deeper interest, and this is mainly because it introduced me to my two favorite members of the MCU at the time : Vision, and more importantly, Wanda Maximoff.\n\nWhen Phase 3 kicked into gear, however, I could no longer deny that I was a sucker for the MCU. Like many people, Black Panther really locked me in, but it only served as a precursor for what looked like the coolest addition to the MCU on the horizon... the inclusion of Doctor Strange. Needless to say, when his self-titled movie was released it won me over in no time, instantly vaulting Doctor Strange into the second spot on my favorite Avenger list, right below Wanda.\n\nWe all know what happened next... the decade-long experiment that the MCU was undertaking reached a peak with Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, leaving many character futures in question. Lucky for me, Wanda came out the other side with a television show, and Doctor Strange remained in the fold as a key member of the MCU. As WandaVision reached its season one conclusion, rumors started buzzing about the Doctor Strange film in the works that would cross the mythical paths of Strange and Wanda, and the buzz become concrete when Spider-Man: No Way Home put all of the pieces in place for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Like any major MCU event, the rumor mill kicked into high gear, and avoiding spoilers became a necessary skill, but I did my best, and on opening day, I was lucky enough to grab a seat at the first screening in town.\n\nFor such a prolific entry into the MCU surrounded by massive versions of the hype machine and rumor mill, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness did an amazing job of presenting a fresh, expectation-defying story. With such intense table-setting done in Phase 4 to set up this film and the few that follow, all of the seeds planted came to wonderful fruition in terms of both the Wanda Maximoff and Doctor Strange story arcs, with a nice bit of character evolution for Christine Palmer and Wong thrown in for good measure. On top of this, we get a plethora of partial fan service additions and partial comic-true additions to further flesh out the intricate and vast world that Doctor Strange and company navigate, be it the introduction of The Illuminati (with members referencing the gamut from classic X-Men to flops like The Inhumans), the illustration of the dichotomy surrounding the Dark Hold and the Book of Vishanti, the inclusion of locations like Mount Wundagore or Westview, or countless other gems found in the tight runtime.\n\nSpeaking of fan service and character additions, we get waves and waves of casting that, in my opinion, fulfilled the rampant expectations without bending into the world of the ridiculous. Starting with said ridiculous, while the trailers made it seem like we were getting a deep dose of zombies from the What If...? series, the closest thing we got to a zombie was a brilliant use of Defender Strange in the climax of the film. Luckily, we also did not have to deal with Tom Cruise in a variant Iron Man role, a choice I have always felt would have been wildly distracting. What we get instead are the return of Mordo (though not our Mordo, as this variant is named Karl) that brings us a nice mixed moment of breathing and tension in tandem, a blitzkrieg insertion of America Chavez (who holds her own amongst some of the most powerful members of the MCU), and in maybe the biggest shock to date in the MCU, we get our first taste of Reed Richards alongside Illuminati members Black Bolt, the previously aforementioned Mordo, a Maria Rambeau Captain Marvel variant, the wildly popular Captain Carter, and last but not least, the truest presentation of Professor X committed to film so far.\n\nI am also hard-pressed to think of another MCU property that leans so heavily into horror and mysticism, which makes the choice to put Sam Raimi at the helm a bit of easy genius due to his pedigree with the depiction of those exact elements on film. With Strange, Wanda and the entirety of Kamar-Taj at play, not to mention the MCU’s groundwork of establishing the various forms of magic within their universe, it is no surprise that we get to see orange Eldritch magic, red Chaos magic and the purple Salem Witch magic all at play. We also get to see a wide range of what the Sling Ring can do in terms of combat, as both Strange and Wong dig deep in their respective bags to face the threat presented by Wanda, not to mention its more practical uses such as travel or protection from a great fall. The menagerie of creatures at Wanda’s disposal are as shocking as they are formidable, and at Kamar-Taj, we get to see a wide range of magic users, including the comic iconic Rintrah, a minotaur who stepped into the apprentice role in the comics that America Chavez is presumably stepping into for the MCU. For the sake of time, I will not gush over all of the magic inclusions in the film, as I could do this all day (wink wink).\n\nThere have been some high level directors connected to the MCU in the past... names like Jon Favreau, James Gunn, Taika Waititi, Joss Whedon, Ryan Coogler, Chloé Zhao, the Russo brothers, Shane Black, Peyton Reed, Benson and Moorhead and more have all done stellar work with this vast cast of characters, but Sam Raimi brings a pedigree to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness that has yet to be seen (with the exception of the aforementioned Benson and Moorhead’s promise shown in Moon Knight) in MCU films. There were warnings of the film being scary, and while it is not scary in my opinion, it does a fantastic job of creating tension and providing a bit more spooky elements than previous films (with the exception of the poorly executed The New Mutants). The fluid, free-moving camera work disorients viewers to an appropriate degree, while simultaneously giving us a subtle connective thread throughout the multiverses in the way that it flips, rotates, inverts and generally bends to the will of a particular scene’s energy. I’ve never really been one to take active notice of the score in MCU films, but this film somehow managed to make me hyperaware of its musical accompaniment, with the Professor X introduction and the confrontation between Doctor Strange and Sinister Strange involving literal musical notes standing out in particular. The sequence where America Chavez and Doctor Strange spiral through a handful of multiverse locations rivals the insanity of the scene where The Ancient One sends Doctor Strange through the surrealist woodchipper in the first film. Like much of this film, I could go on and on about the technical aspects, but Raimi did such a great job of putting this film together that it all blends together into one unified visceral experience.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch has clearly taken complete ownership of the Doctor Strange character to the point where he can manage expressions and temperament with enough subtlety to provide us with a range of Strange variants, all of which are rooted deeply in Strange’s signature high-minded and egotistical self-view, but each hitting a different point on the scale in terms of the capability to be vicious, pensive, light-hearted and loving or completely broken. In an equally powerful parallel performance, Elizabeth Olsen manages to bring new range and depth to Wanda in ways that weren’t displayed during the entire run of the WandaVision series, all of which is caged in by the yin of Wanda’s motherly energy that tangles with the yang of her villainous, world-breaking powers, with a solid touch of aggressive edge for good measure. Benedict Wong ratchets back the humor we’ve come to know him for and replaced it with a sense of dignity and grace one would come to associate with the title of Sorcerer Supreme, not to mention the leadership tendencies of a benevolent general who cares deeply for his ranks. Xochitl Gomez confidently steps shoulder to shoulder with this trio, exuding the range of personality from jovial to tortured required to be a fixture in the MCU, and using her time during her debut performance to make viewers forget she hasn’t been in the mix for year. Chiwetel Ejiofor returns, though the hurt and disdain displayed in the former Mordo is replaced with arrogance and complacency, making the Karl variant stand in stark contrast to the angered teacher we met previously. Rachel McAdams also returns with a much meatier role, eschewing her previous status as Strange’s romantic interest for a bit more autonomy and agency that helps her factor deeply into the story rather than simply standing around as human set dressing. Michael Stuhlbarg, Patrick Stewart, John Krasinski, Haley Atwell, Lashana Lynch, Anson Mount, Julian Hilliard and Jett Klyne, Bruce Campbell, Michael Waldron and even Charlize Theron also make memorable appearances/cameos.\n\nIt has been interesting seeing how divisive this film has been to audiences and critics... perhaps some of this has to do with MCU (and general superhero movie) fatigue, and perhaps some of it has to do with the Disney onslaught that has occurred since the MCU/Sony/Disney business fallout, but I feel that anyone who takes this film at face value cannot deny its status as part of the top tier in the MCU. I wouldn’t mind seeing Sam Raimi handle at least one more Doctor Strange or Wanda Maximoff film, as his signature approach to filmmaking feels incredibly fresh within the MCU skin. While not the best multiverse film to drop this year (largely due to its obligations to be a puzzle piece in a much larger developing image), it’s a powerful entry into both Phase 4 and the MCU, and in my honest opinion, it’s the first film to inject high energy into this phase other than Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. It may not end up garnering universal praise, but it will get heaps of praise from me, for what that’s worth.\n\nReview : The Batman (2022)\n\nWhat is there to say about the cinematic portrayal of Batman that hasn’t already been said? In my lifetime, I’ve seen ten live action movies featuring Batman, countless animated features and series, and numerous appearances of the Caped Crusader in other DC properties. I’ve seen the likes of Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale and Ben Affleck all don the cape and cowl, but not even Affleck generated the kind of buzz and debate that occurred when Robert Pattinson was announced as next in line for the role in the Matt Reeves directed film The Batman. As someone who has not seen any Twilight films, but has seen Good Time, Cosmopolis, The Devil All the Time and Tenet, I know he has the range capable of making him a memorable Bruce Wayne, which is the key to playing Batman, as most anybody can put on the outfit for a growling and punching session. My anticipation for this film was definitely high, and in the midst of sold out show after sold out show, I finally found an opening week opportunity to see the film.\n\nIn my opinion, the best aspect of The Batman is the way that it leans into the detective side of the Batman lore. Using The Riddler as the antagonist inherently plants the seed of mystery into the story, and based on the deep web that The Riddler weaves, the lion’s share of Batman’s time on screen is spent breaking codes and connecting dots, much to the ire of everyone on the Gotham Police Department short of Commissioner Gordon. To my knowledge, this is the hardest that any cinematic portrayal of Batman has leaned into his detective side, as most directors have opted to lean into his dichotomy of savior and vigilante, and for my money’s worth, allowing Batman to coexist in a tenuous manner with the Gotham Police helps add to the already tension-heavy setting of Gotham. Allowing The Riddler to work out of the shadows in a very similar manner to Batman also helps build a clear and present parallel between the two characters without beating viewers over the head in the same way that previous Batman films or properties like Watchmen did, making The Batman as refreshing as it is familiar. In many ways, The Batman steps walks right up to the border of emulating Se7en, though it pulls back just enough to make the comparisons feel like loving homage rather than a re-skin.\n\nThe literal mystery that we are presented is allowed to grow and spread based on the foundation of mystery that Matt Reeves and company build the narrative for The Batman off of. Rather than hang the intrigue of The Batman on the familiar hook of Bruce Wayne’s internal struggle between philanthropic posturing and revenge-based vigilantism, Matt Reeves digs deep into the world of Batman lore, and the gems that he picks out and puts on display not only ignite the third act of a somewhat maddingly long film, but they recontextualize certain aspects of previous Batman properties. I am by no means a Batman devotee, as I fall much more on the side of casual fan, so when Wayne family secrets start getting spilled courtesy of The Riddler, particularly those connected to the history of Arkham Asylum, I found myself genuinely curious in a way I have not been for previous Batman films. In regard to the previously mentioned duality of Batman that we’ve all become familiar with, Matt Reeves allows us to fill in the blanks in terms of Wayne business, choosing to largely dwell within the self-proclaimed “nocturnal animal” realm that Batman thrives in. Due to this dedication to one side of the Batman story, he is able to build a deeply moody noir where we both understand how Batman can be omnipresent and are unnerved by the feeling that Gotham has eyes everywhere.\n\nThe cinematic portrayal of Gotham used for The Batman may be my favorite, as it all but settles the debate on whether Gotham is a proxy for Chicago or New York (with the latter clearly being the correct answer). The costuming is incredible in this film, with The Riddler’s look in particular being distinct enough to be unsettling while being generic enough to be adopted on a grand scale. The Batman armor for this film is also impressive, with the utility aspect of Batman’s outfit really getting its day in the nearly non-existent sun, especially the Bathook and the Batarang. The score has an adequate feeling of epicness needed to put us in the proper state of mind to suspend our disbelief while also putting us on the edge of our seats as the long but well-paced narrative unfolds. For a film that deals with the fantastic world of superheros and supervillains, The Batman is surprisingly grounded, with the down-to-Earth performances matching the “as believable as possible” series of events that take place, managing to keep the scale of previous films without wandering into the boundaries of a full-fledged circus. For a film as dark and drenched in shadows as The Batman, the film manages to maintain a distinct look with enough variety to shock and awe. A special nod must be given to the makeup job for Oswald Cobblepot, as Colin Farrell is basically unrecognizable in this role.\n\nSpeaking of performances, I’ve been a huge proponent of the Robert Pattinson casting since the day it was announced, and I am happy to say the his performance more than lived up to my expectations. He steely, sorrow-heavy and distant gaze not only permeates the Batman cowl, but it immediatelyl makes us sympathetic to Bruce Wayne, and despite his claims of being vengeance personified, it’s the internal struggles with humanity that he constantly goes through that make his performance wholly compelling. This is heavily complimented by the almost uncannily natural performance of Jeffrey Wright, as he humanizes Commissioner Gordon in a much needed way that makes him less of the unreal beacon of Gotham’s hope and much more the integrity-based humanitarian that I imagine he was always pictured to be. Zoë Kravitz displays all of the familiar cunning and flirtation that Catwoman is known for, but rather than make her motivations be based in personal gain and survival, she is given a version of revenge-based intention that somewhat mirrors that of Bruce Wayne, though the friend versus family comparison allows her one step of removal that keeps her from succumbing to the creeping madness that constantly threatens Wayne. Paul Dano, despite minimal facetime, somehow finds a way to broadcast his signature heavily emotive physicality and expressions that make him so visually compelling, with many of his choices feeling as calculated as they do born of madness. Colin Farrell, as mentioned before, is wholly unrecognizable, but not just visually, as he channels aspects of Scorsese-level unhinged gangsterdom in what feels like an initial step towards a full fledged insane version of the Penguin. John Turturro does what he does best, putting a charming slyness to the built-in sleaze that comes with portraying Carmine Falcone, while seemingly relishing in the opportunity to be larger than life. Andy Serkis plays wise beyond his years as Alfred, and interestingly enough, he seems to serve the purpose of sad reminder to Bruce Wayne rather than all-knowing skeleton key, though aspects of his past do come in handy both in terms of their utility and the autonomy in which Alfred chooses to partake in the mystery.\n\nThough relatively open-ended in terms of whether The Batman is an introduction to a larger story or a singular standalone tale, I do appreciate this ambiguity, especially in light of what is hinted at to possibly be the next chapter of the story. Seeing a small minority of men with a deep belief in personal codes battle with the fate of Gotham hanging in the balance hasn’t failed us yet on screen, and The Batman is a huge positive notch in the belt for DC and the recently flailing characterization of Batman. One wonders if the rumors of on set issues came from interpersonal interactions or the strains of a COVID-era production, but hopefully it’s the latter, if for no reason other than that ups the possibility of continued tales from the world of The Batman.\n\nThoughts : West Side Story (2021)\n\nDuring last years Academy Awards ceremony, I was sitting there minding my own business when a somewhat familiar New York setting appeared on my screen. Slowly, I saw Jets, I saw Sharks, and when I saw Maria, all of my assumptions became reality : someone was remaking West Side Story. I prepared myself to see what brave soul was taking on the task of remaking such a beloved property, but my entire sense of reasoning got flipped when I saw the name assigned to direct the project was Steven Spielberg. Why, of all people, would Spielberg remake West Side Story, of all movies? Has he ever even made a musical before?\n\nThe hype was there, but after a delay or two that pushed the film back to Christmas of 2021, I found that my excitement for the project had pretty much died down to a light casual level. When award season announcements started coming out, I was (and wasn’t) surprised to see West Side Story garner so many nominations, and yet, I could not inspire myself to make a trip to the cinema for a viewing. Once West Side Story hit Disney+ this week, however, I had no further excuses, and seeing that I have been given plenty of time to watch this prior to the upcoming Academy Awards ceremony, I finally carved out a couple of hours and dove in.\n\nWhile I did anticipate a modern day remake of West Side Story to be patently edgier than it’s cinematic forefather, I don’t think I was expecting the film to be as hard-nosed and rough around the edges as it was, much to the film’s benefit. As a Bernstein and Sondheim musical, it is nearly impossible to execute West Side Story without the integration of the singing and dancing, but both of these elements are perfectly sewn into the world in the most natural way possible... rather than relying on musical numbers as dressed up exposition dumps, Spielberg (mostly) is able to weave in dance and song numbers while portraying them as genuine moments of personal expression and release, like in the opening where members of the Jets dance through the streets to hype themselves up for a disrespectful stand in their former neighborhood, now occupied by a growing Puerto Rican community. Rather than undercut the rumbles and run-ins by choreographing them as dance numbers, the combat is presented as an 85/15 percent mixture of proper combat and heightened choreography.\n\nThe film is extremely raw in terms of its approach to attitude, romance, representation and cultural dedication as well. One of the most noticeable additions to this update is the inclusion of coarse language, with the dated and restrained derogatory terms and coded curse words from the 1961 version of the film being largely replaced with R-rated language. The classic romantic framework that leans on the Romeo & Juliet classic remains, as this adaptation is not necessarily a narrative update, but we really get to feel the tangle of the multiple threads in this version... the love triangle between Maria, Chino and Tony really stands out in this update, while the influence of Bernardo and Anita on Maria is easier for the viewer to sympathize with in this version, making the romance between Tony and Maria that much more tenuous. One other beneficial update is the treatment and presentation of Anybodys... despite her tomboyish appearance in the original, the rampant misogynistic attitude present in the Jets culture would have made her a clear target for assaults of different nature in an update, but based on the current difficult acceptance on a mass level of the Transgender community, having Anybodys present as they/them makes their connection to the Jets being beneficial while also being frowned upon much more believable on a grand scale.\n\nSpeaking of representation, Spielberg is (obviously) much more representative and respective of all cultures present in his version of West Side Story... both sides of the conflict are set up to be equally sympathized and villainized, and for those with a sense of self-pride and awareness of their heritage, it is extremely simple to see why all parties involved feel so strongly about maintaining their cultural stake in a rapidly changing New York. Time has made this change that much more of an impending doom factor in Spielberg’s update, as the specter of gentrification that hangs over both communities signals the genesis of a changing New York that looks much more different even now than when the original West Side Story first achieved its time-based classic status. The way that xenophobia, cultural pride and capitalism creates a three-pronged sense of tension within the two communities is also a considerably powerful factor, as we really feel the nature of the brewing hate between both sides, explicitly via Riff’s direct digs and Bernardo’s flippant disregard for his tormentors. While the presence of heritage blinding all sides from protecting themselves from an enemy that should unify them has always been a part of West Side Story, it feels like a showcase element in this updated take on the film.\n\nSpielberg naturally shines on the production side of things, and all of it starts with the extremely distinct look he is able to give the film, which allows it to straddle the line between aged classic and modern take. Just the right level of desaturation gives the entire affair a classic film look, but it is applied lightly enough to let the more vibrant pastels pop while still making them feel in line with the overall aged look. The use of modern cinematic camera moves aids in lifting the overall spirit of the viewer, allowing us to feel proper for a musical despite a restraint-filled approach from Spielberg to the standard musical. The set dressings, wardrobe, hairstyles, vocabulary and accents are all pitch perfect, making the film wonderfully immersive and easy to buy in to. The very precise lighting choices and presentation of set elements allows the film to toe the line of a theatrical, play0like presentation without necessarily allowing the restraining feel of a set to emerge. As mentioned before, the wonderful balance of incredibly organic dance choreography set against the combat choreography makes all of those sequences feel much more natural than they do performative.\n\nHe may not be the star or the top billed actor, but Mike Faist is the star of West Side Story, as he turns in a performance that makes it feel like he was literally ripped from the era the story takes place in, down to the defiant anti-authoritarian attitude and undying devotion for the streets, with enough edge to cut a viewer not paying attention. David Alvarez matches all of the intensity that Faist lays out, but offsets it with a deep cultural pride, a complete lack of patience for disrespect and enough cool to package it up and sell it. Rachel Zegler steps up to the lofty challenge of portraying the iconic Maria, and she manages to make all of the innocence, sheltered nature and loving optimism in the face of toxic doubt feel fresh and completely her own. Ansel Elgort feels as if he is stepping into a sort of elder statesman role for his generation, serving as the voice of reason and the example for potential change and evolution for a group of residents that feel as if they’re being pushed out of the place that they belong, with his normally slightly unique look feeling completely at home in West Side Story. Ariana DeBose is a joy as Anita, bringing a wonderfully feisty energy to her role as Maria’s loving voice of reason who understands the passion, but needs the peace. Corey Stoll brings all the heat as Lieutenant Schrank, dropping facts and knowledge to the Jets in the same manner he lobbies disrespect at the Sharks, all the while giving both sides the brutal truth. Stoll’s presence is given additional support by Brian d’Arcy James as the ever maligned Officer Krupke, wearing the strain and stress that comes with being a police officer like a second skin. Josh Andrés Rivera amplifies the burden of unrequited love by also serving as the bearer of bad news, making us completely feel his pain as the stakes rise. iris menas steps confidently into the updated role of Anybodys, showing a complete ownership of the character that gives them newfound agency and pride. Rita Moreno steps in to help crystalize the transfer of energy from the original to the update, while supporting appearances by a host of Jets, Sharks, family and friends help Spielberg complete his vision.\n\nWhile Spielberg does a standout job directing, it does feel a bit of a rudimentary display to do West Side Story, especially with such classic source material to reference that has stood the test of time. I do understand all of the award fanfare, though it’s crazy that Mike Faist, the one element that deserves breakout praise, has not seen it on the biggest awards stages. All of that being said, I have to give West Side Story the props and respect it deserves, despite my personal feelings on someone as prolific as Spielberg taking on such a seemingly easy choice at this point in his career.\n\nNominations : The 94th Academy Awards (2022)\n\nThe 94th Annual Academy Awards will air Sunday, March 27, 2022 on ABC after being delayed a month from its original February 27, 2022 date. Normally, I would consider the Golden Globes a decent indicator as to what may happen at the Oscars, but outside of The Power of the Dog making a strong stand, I found myself surprised and often at odds with the films deemed award-worthy.\n\n2021 marked a general return to something resembling normalcy by the summer, which was largely aided by a handful of Marvel releases, a long-delayed James Bond film, an epic update to Dune and a couple of festival darlings in the form of Belfast and The Power of the Dog. The streaming services seemed to really find their stride, with AppleTV+ releasing a string of films with box-office level names and production that forced Netflix and Amazon Prime to step their game up, as well as heartfelt and powerful films like CODA. Netflix definitely answered the call with Don’t Look Up, a surprise gem that helped close out the year and set up Netflix’s plan to release a new film every Friday in 2022. The previously mentioned Marvel releases helped expand the incredible phenomenon that was the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and in the case of Spider-Man : No Way Home, drove the speculative corners of the internet crazy with theories before paying off the theories in the most amazing and rewarding way possible. Outside of the MCU, cape films were rewarded with a strong showing from DC and Warner Brothers, as fans got their wishes fulfilled with Zack Snyder’s Justice League while they watched James Gunn righted recent wrongs with his stellar release of The Suicide Squad. Robin Wright and Maggie Gyllenhaal both made impressive writing/directing debuts, while Kenneth Branagh returned to classic form with Belfast. Actresses like Kristen Stewart, Nicole Kidman and Jessica Chastain got to play legendary figures like Princess Diana, Lucille Ball and Tammy Faye Baker (respectively), while actors like Nicolas Cage, Bob Odenkirk and Michelle Pfeifer got to dwell in dramatic darkness via films like Pig, Nobody and French Exit.\n\nThe year was certainly not perfect, however, and the Academy Award nominations definitely proved that oversight and lack of recognition is still a thing in the industry. Outside of the egregious lack of nominations for Last Night in Soho, Pig, @Zola, French Exit or Shiva Baby, some of the most obvious oversights, fans were up in arms that an extended BEST PICTURE category still found a way to leave Spider-Man : No Way Home out of the mix... funny enough, as this article neared publishing, the Academy announced an online vote for a “fan-favorite” film that would receive recognition on award night, leading many to believe that the move was an attempt to save face in the wake of the Spider-Man outcry. Titane blazed a trail through the festival circuit, and while Drive My Car had breakout nomination success outside of the BEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM category, Titane failed to garner even a single nomination.\n\nFor all these oversights, however, they did get enough right for me to be excited and intrigued about the ceremony. As I do every year, I decided to share my thoughts on each category I feel credible enough to give insight for, as well as my prediction for whom I believe will walk away with statues on the night of. Feel free to play along at home, and we will reconvene the following week to compare notes.\n\nNOMINEES\n\nEditor’s note : I will be excluding the following categories from this coverage due to a lack of knowledge in regard to the nominees.\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY (FEATURE) BEST DOCUMENTARY (SHORT SUBJECT) BEST INTERNATIONAL FEATURE FILM BEST MUSIC (ORIGINAL SONG) BEST SHORT FILM (ANIMATED) BEST SHORT FILM (LIVE ACTION)\n\nACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE JAVIER BARDEM Being the Ricardos BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH The Power of the Dog ANDREW GARFIELD tick, tick...BOOM! WILL SMITH King Richard DENZEL WASHINGTON The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nDespite the high levels of talent found in the nominees for this category, it felt like an obvious pick for me. Javier Bardem was more than serviceable Desi Arnaz, though he largely leaned on the Bardem characteristic set to pull off the performance. Andrew Garfield was my frontrunner for a hot minute, with his performance as Jonathan Larson not only exuding life and love, but serving as a reminder to me of why I love theater so much. Will Smith is known for his ability to get straight down to the realness and sincere roots of his characterizations, and the way that he brings Richard Williams to life on the screen helps remove some of the real life stigma that has followed him over the years. Benedict Cumberbatch really and truly impressed me in The Power of the Dog, providing me with one of the best character arc swerves I’ve seen in ages by taking what felt like a one note character and running recklessly in the opposite direction to bring him to life. All of that being said, one man chose to work with a classic director, and when given timeless material, he not only proved to be the best actor of the year, but arguably the best of the past two generations.\n\nPrediction : Denzel Washington for The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nACTOR IN A SUPPORTING ROLE CIARÁN HINDS Belfast TROY KOTSUR CODA JESSE PLEMONS The Power of the Dog J.K. SIMMONS Being the Ricardos KODI SMIT-MCPHEE The Power of the Dog\n\nAfter a couple of interesting oversights (in my opinion) during the Golden Globes, it was very interesting to see Ciarán Hinds and J.K. Simmons suddenly make the Oscar nomination list... this, of course, is not a slight to either man, though both of them worked their magic via more subdued performances aside much more energetic and attention-commanding leads. Though entertaining, Jesse Plemons feels like the odd man out in this group of nominees, especially when compared to his fellow co-star that was also nominated in this category. My heart wants to give my prediction to Troy Kotsur, whose performance in CODA was one of a few in the film that left a lasting impression. In light of all of this, there was something about the way that Kodi Smit-McPhee shed a cloak of innocence and walked headlong into darkness for his role in The Power of the Dog that was stirring, and in my opinion, that performance deserves recognition.\n\nPrediction : Kodi Smit-McPhee for The Power of the Dog\n\nACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE JESSICA CHASTAIN The Eyes of Tammy Faye OLIVIA COLMAN The Lost Daughter PENÉLOPE CRUZ Parallel Mothers NICOLE KIDMAN Being the Ricardos KRISTEN STEWART Spencer\n\nI really wanted to wait until I had a viewing of The Lost Daughter under my belt to speak on this category, as the buzz surrounding that film (and Colman’s performance) was too strong to ignore. My opinons on Penélope Cruz are off the table, but I’ve seen everything else, and I definitely have some opinions about this race.\n\nWhile Colman is brilliant in her performance, it is largely aided by the adjoining performance of her costar Jessie Buckley, as the two of them end up making the character of Leda complete through her young actions and her aged regret, which makes it hard to award Colman for solo work. This leaves us with a trio of three standout women portraying three standout women on film, a phenomenon that I find interesting within itself.\n\nJessica Chastain, while being a personal favorite actress of mine, fell so deep into her portrayal of Tammy Faye Baker that she became a bit unrecognizable, which would have been a good thing had the slightly cartoonish tone of the film not undercut the performance and made it more camp than chameleon-like. Nicole Kidman does a better job of being able to portray the legendary Lucille Ball while still maintaining a sense of self, and would likely be my pick for the winner if not for the (in my opinion) amazing and underappreciated Kristen Stewart, who pulls off the performance trifecta of honoring Princess Diana, keeping a sense of self and capturing a sense of spirit that intertwines the two beings together into a harmonic sole onscreen presence.\n\nPrediction : Kristen Stewart for Spencer\n\nACTRESS IN A SUPPORTING ROLE JESSIE BUCKLEY The Lost Daughter ARIANA DEBOSE West Side Story JUDI DENCH Belfast KIRSTEN DUNST The Power of the Dog AUNJANUE ELLIS King Richard\n\nWhat a tough call this one is. I’m sure that Ariana DeBose did an amazing job in West Side Story based on the nomination company she is currently keeping, but without having seen the film myself, it would be disingenuous of me to speak on it definitively.\n\nKirsten Dunst wasn’t necessarily bad in The Power of the Dog, but with at least two of her costars absolutely shining in continually scene-stealing performances, not to mention a character role that required her to wallow in depths she did not quite reach, leaves a bit to be desired. Judi Dench has to deal with a similar situation, with the difference being that there wasn’t quite enough meat on the bone for her role that would allow her to rise above the competition. That leave us with, in my opinion, the two best candidates. While Jessie Buckley does an amazing job of showing us the pain and struggle that comes with being a reluctant mother and wife, it is the way that Aunjanue Ellis characterizes an ability to be an integral part of the Williams family without undercutting the efforts of Richard or the trajectory of Venus and Serena that truly speaks to me.\n\nPrediction : Aunjanue Ellis for King Richard\n\nANIMATED FEATURE FILM ENCANTO Jared Bush, Byron Howard, Yvett Merino and Clark Spencer FLEE Jonas Poher Rasmussen, Monica Hellström, Signe Byrge Sørensen and Charlotte De La Gournerie LUCA Enrico Casarosa and Andrea Warren THE MITCHELLS VS. THE MACHINES Mike Rianda, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Kurt Albrecht RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON Don Hall, Carlos López Estrada, Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho\n\nWhat a year for animation. Disney continued their strong run of recent films like Coco and Soul by notching an impressive three nominations this year, all of which continue their practice of shedding a light as far across the cultural spectrum as possible. Luca captures the spirit of Italian fishing villages through its wardrobe and music, while centering the tale around the water allows Pixar to flex their rendering muscles. Raya and the Last Dragon takes Eastern elements to tell a story about unification, trust and family ties, while using its mythical setting tfor visual enhancement. Encanto ratchets up the magic even further by taking viewers to Colombia for another family-driven tale full of enchantment and wonder that, thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda, has some of the catchiest original songs of the year.\n\nFlee makes the harrowing tale of fleeing Afghanistan in hopes of finding asylum in Scandinavia as beautiful as can be with its hand drawn, loose illustration look, all the while telling the tale well enough to garner the film nominations for BEST ANIMATED PICTURE AND BEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE. The Mitchells vs. the Machines is not only the best looking animated film of the year for me, thanks largely to Sony continuing to push the boundaries of highly stylized animation, but it’s the kind of family tale I would love to share with my future family, should I be lucky enough to have one. The Mitchells vs. the Machines would be my pick, but the power of Encanto simply cannot be ignored.\n\nPrediction : Encanto\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY DUNE Greig Fraser NIGHTMARE ALLEY Dan Laustsen THE POWER OF THE DOG Ari Wegner THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH Bruno Delbonnel WEST SIDE STORY Janusz Kaminski\n\nTaking West Side Story and Nightmare Alley off the table (as I have not seen those films), we’ve still got a knockdown, drag out battle here between three formidable contenders. Dune is the likely public favorite with it’s epic science-fiction world that bounces between monumental industrial structures, space vessels and desert planets. The Tragedy of Macbeth does so much with so little, not only using minimalism and black and white cinematography to great effect, but doing so in a frame aspect ratio on top of everything else. The Power of the Dog simply cannot be ignored, however... with so many nominations this year, it’d be easy to be shortsighted when looking at the different elements of the film, but one that immediately grabs attention is the beautiful and picturesque way that the Western interiors and exteriors are presented. 12 nominations is an impressive feat for any film, and this category looks like one that The Power of the Dog should be able to turn into a statue when all is said and done.\n\nPrediction : The Power of the Dog\n\nCOSTUME DESIGN CRUELLA Jenny Beavan CYRANO Massimo Cantini Parrini and Jacqueline Durran DUNE Jacqueline West and Robert Morgan NIGHTMARE ALLEY Luis Sequeira WEST SIDE STORY Paul Tazewell\n\nAdmittedly, I’ve only seen two films on this list, but of the two I’ve seen, one is tailor-made to take this statue home, and with the power of Disney behind it, I would not be surprised if Cruella pulled off the votes needed to win.\n\nPrediction : Cruella\n\nDIRECTING BELFAST Kenneth Branagh DRIVE MY CAR Ryusuke Hamaguchi LICORICE PIZZA Paul Thomas Anderson THE POWER OF THE DOG Jane Campion WEST SIDE STORY Steven Spielberg\n\nBefore we even get into specifics, congratulations must be given to Ryusuke Hamaguchi for exceeding expectations... while it was likely going to be obvious that Drive My Car would be nominated for Best International Feature, it’s nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay are a testament to the picture’s quality.\n\nI cannot speak on Steven Spielberg’s work on West Side Story, as I’ve not yet seen it, but knowing Speilberg’s pedigree, it doesn’t surprise me to see him in the Best Director mix. While Licorice Pizza was a solid effort from Paul Thomas Anderson, it did leave something to be desired when compared to not only his other work, but his fellow nominees. That leaves us with The Power of the Dog, the belle of the ball, and Belfast, a stellar film that may have gotten the short end of the stick this year’s award season. The masses will probably give this one to Campion, but those in the know know that Belfast is the film that is more likely to stand the test of time, largely to Kenneth Branagh’s stellar vision and execution.\n\nPrediction : Kenneth Branagh for Belfast\n\nFILM EDITING DON'T LOOK UP Hank Corwin DUNE Joe Walker KING RICHARD Pamela Martin THE POWER OF THE DOG Peter Sciberras TICK, TICK...BOOM! Myron Kerstein and Andrew Weisblum\n\nAs an editor, I have to admit that 2021 was a standout year for the discipline, as many story narratives and presentations found themselves greatly enhanced by the kinetic and artistic editing choices about. Of the nominees, two of the strongest films (Dune and King Richard, respectively) do happen to have relatively by the book editing in comparison to the trio that is making up the top contenders in the fight.\n\nOf these three, The Power of the Dog does do a good job of handling long passages of time artistically through its editing, but for me, the story is doing more of the heavy lifting in this scenario. That leaves us with two powerhouse presentations that were given hughe amplification from their editing. As much as I love all of the choices made in Tick, Tick... BOOM!, especially the seamless way that real footage of Jonathan Larson is cut in with footage of Andrew Garfield, there is something about the almost graphic novel presentation of Don’t Look Up that raises that material from entertainingly troubling to compelling and invigorating.\n\nMAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING\n\nSeeing Coming 2 America get recognized at the Academy Award level for makeup and hairstyling is a triumph for the film, especially when one considers that the presentation of royalty was a key factor in the story. Dune should definitely give lots of its immersion credit to the makeup and hairstyling of the Fremen people, not to mention the stirring and disturbing design used to bring Baron Vladimir Harkonnen to life. I haven’t seen House of Gucci yet, but based on the titular association it does not surprise me that it got a nomination in this category. The team behind The Eyes of Tammy Faye helped make Jessica Chastain’s performance as Tammy Faye Baker even more believable by nailing her iconic look. When it’s all said and done, though, much like the Best Costume Design category, there is one film that feels tailor made to take home the gold in this category, and that’s Disney’s Cruella.\n\nPrediction : Cruella\n\nThis category is always so hard for me to pick, as the key to a good score is that it does its work so subtly it often falls victim to lack of direct recognition. I cannot comment on Parallel Mothers as I have not seen it, but from what I remember, The Power of the Dog had Jonny Greenwood‘s signature off-kilter nature, but for the most part, kept a bit of a rustic feel to it... Encanto‘s score tended to feel like continuations and setups for the signature musical numbers... and Don’t Look Up had such a dizzying and well constructed story that I have difficulty remembering the score (apologies to all involved with that picture). In regard to Dune, Hans Zimmer did what he does best, bringing in touches of epic proportion, emotional power and artistic flare that enhanced the Dune experience, making it the strongest contender in my opinion.\n\nPrediction : Hans Zimmer for Dune\n\nBEST PICTURE BELFAST Laura Berwick, Kenneth Branagh, Becca Kovacik and Tamar Thomas CODA Philippe Rousselet, Fabrice Gianfermi and Patrick Wachsberger DON'T LOOK UP Adam McKay and Kevin Messick DRIVE MY CAR Teruhisa Yamamoto DUNE Mary Parent, Denis Villeneuve and Cale Boyter KING RICHARD Tim White, Trevor White and Will Smith LICORICE PIZZA Sara Murphy, Adam Somner and Paul Thomas Anderson NIGHTMARE ALLEY Guillermo del Toro, J. Miles Dale and Bradley Cooper THE POWER OF THE DOG Jane Campion, Tanya Seghatchian, Emile Sherman, Iain Canning and Roger Frappier WEST SIDE STORY Steven Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger\n\nIn order to make my pick for this category, I have to break things down into three categories and work from there. The first category, and the first to be cut, are the films that I ahve not seen, which takes Drive My Car, Nightmare Alley and West Side Story off of my table for consideration.\n\nUp next would be the films that I enjoyed, but in my opinion, don’t feel as if they transcended that realm just beyond entertainment, where films become compelling, deeply inspirational or seriously make you reassess your take on the human condition. Licorice Pizza, as much as I love and respect P.T. Anderson, would be the king of this category, as the film feels more self-indulgent and self-referential than it does moving or compelling on a large scale level. King Richard, though an inspiring story, would also fall in this realm based solely on it being largely a by-the-book affair.\n\nThat leaves us with the final category, the cream of the crop. The nerd in me would love to see Dune win, as it would not only be a win for films that normally do not get award season recognition, but it would also be a much deserved win for Denis Villeneuve, who up to this point has always been the bridesmaid, but never the bride. Don’t Look Up appeals to the anarchists in me, as a smart, dark comedy that isn’t afraid to tell the viewing audience at large about itself would be an incredible win. My heart belongs to CODA, easily the best film that AppleTV+ has introduced to the world, and by far the most heartwarming and emotionally charged story of the group, not to mention a true accomplishment for the ASL community at large in terms of on-screen representation.\n\nOut of the cream of the crop, the final two left figure out to be the favorites for the coveted BEST PICTURE award. The film critic in me would give the award to Belfast nine times out of ten, as it’s the perfect kind of film to win the award with its youthful star thrown into a situation of turmoil that just so happens to be based on real life. The black and white photography is stark, and collectively, it may have the best group of performances out of any film released this year. There is something about The Power of the Dog, however, that makes me think it’s going to be the 2022 version of Slumdog Millionaire in terms of winning... at least two actors in the film are essentially shoo-ins for acting awards, the film looks both classic and amazing, and the wild card of this being a Jane Campion project is probably just enough to give it the edge at the end of the night.\n\nPrediction : The Power of the Dog\n\nPRODUCTION DESIGN DUNE Production Design: Patrice Vermette; Set Decoration: Zsuzsanna Sipos NIGHTMARE ALLEY Production Design: Tamara Deverell; Set Decoration: Shane Vieau THE POWER OF THE DOG Production Design: Grant Major; Set Decoration: Amber Richards THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH Production Design: Stefan Dechant; Set Decoration: Nancy Haigh WEST SIDE STORY Production Design: Adam Stockhausen; Set Decoration: Rena DeAngelo\n\nProduction design is all about immersion, and many times throughout the year, I found myself mentioning immersion and suspension of belief when it came to talking about production design elements of films I enjoyed throughout the year. Nightmare Alley and West Side Story both seem to have clean modern, updated interpretations of old looks based on the trailers, but unfortunately, trailers are my only experience with those films.\n\nDune uses its production design to show the disparity between the high class, royal, spaceship dwelling society and those who dwell in the desert, and the science-fiction elements of the production design such as the weaponry and the dragonfly-winged ships all plunge us deep into the depths of Dune. The Power of the Dog takes the traditional Western look, keeps the amplified nature of the surroundings in a classic presentation form, and infuses everything else, such as interiors and places of solace, with a sense of sensitivity and heavy emotion, which greatly aids the story. The Tragedy of Macbeth not only gives the best film-based approximation of a stage set without being handcuffed to the limits of the stage, but it is abstract enough to subtextually comment on the struggles for power and sanity that fuel the story. When picking a winner, the best idea in this category is to take the film franchise that already had a history of groundbreaking and eye-opening production design and see if the latest entry lives up to the hype, and for my money’s worth, 2021 Dune leaves the previous efforts in the dust.\n\nPrediction : Dune\n\nSOUND\n\nBELFAST Denise Yarde, Simon Chase, James Mather and Niv Adiri DUNE Mac Ruth, Mark Mangini, Theo Green, Doug Hemphill and Ron Bartlett NO TIME TO DIE Simon Hayes, Oliver Tarney, James Harrison, Paul Massey and Mark Taylor THE POWER OF THE DOG Richard Flynn, Robert Mackenzie and Tara Webb WEST SIDE STORY Tod A. Maitland, Gary Rydstrom, Brian Chumney, Andy Nelson and Shawn Murphy\n\nDune had plenty of sonic texture, a beautiful Hans Zimmer score, and a rich palette of science fiction action to attach foley to. The Power of the Dog is a great film all around, though throwing it in the Best Sound category feels a bit much. I’ve not yet seen No Time To Die or West Side Story, so I cannot speak honestly on those films. One film I can vouch fully for, however, is Belfast, a rich slice of life film that puts you squarely in the shoes of its young protagonist via sonic stimulus, which makes it even more jarring with the sound design gets ultra aggressive as the tension and violence mounts. For me, this one is a no-brainer... Belfast deserves this win.\n\nPrediction : Belfast\n\nVISUAL EFFECTS DUNE Paul Lambert, Tristan Myles, Brian Connor and Gerd Nefzer FREE GUY Swen Gillberg, Bryan Grill, Nikos Kalaitzidis and Dan Sudick NO TIME TO DIE Charlie Noble, Joel Green, Jonathan Fawkner and Chris Corbould SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS Christopher Townsend, Joe Farrell, Sean Noel Walker and Dan Oliver SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME Kelly Port, Chris Waegner, Scott Edelstein and Dan Sudick\n\nI’m embarrassed how underprepared I am for this category. I’ve literally had all the time in the world to see Free Guy and No Time To Die, and yet, here I am, having only seen the Marvel fare and Denis Villeneuve’s astounding rendition of Dune. While Spider-Man: No Way Home did a good job of illustrating the power of Doctor Strange, I think we will really be in for a visual treat once his film is released this year. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does have some interesting visuals connected to the mystic forest maze and the depiction of the magical rings, but as good as the effects are, Shang-Chi by no means leans on them in order to be a quality film. That leaves us with a film that, in my opinion, is leagues ahead of this year’s competition. Villeneuve and company took Dune, a film with a rich history of visual delights, and cranked the output valve to 11, blowing away the work done in the past (in my humble opinion). For that alone, Dune deserves a little gold statue to call its own.\n\nPrediction : Dune\n\nWRITING (ADAPTED SCREENPLAY) CODA Screenplay by Siân Heder DRIVE MY CAR Screenplay by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, DUNE Screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Denis Villeneuve and Eric Roth THE LOST DAUGHTER Written by Maggie Gyllenhaal THE POWER OF THE DOG Written by Jane Campion\n\nThe art of taking someone’s story from another medium and translating it to the screen is one wrought with positives and negatives on all sides, so seeing a story successfully adapted to the point of grand scale critical and viewer acceptance is an art all to itself that deserves the highest of recognition. Drive My Car has left a major impression on the movie viewing public in 2021, and the fact that it broke out of its predicted box is quite the amazing tale. Dune and The Lost Daughter are both quality adaptations of moving tales, with Dune only being halfway done.\n\nThis leaves us with two of my favorite films of the year. My heart really and truly wants to shoot this award to CODA, as this film deserves infinitely more eyes on it than it has likely received so far. My head, however, has to go with the film (and writer/director) that will likely be the story of the night when all is said and done, and if The Power of the Dog and Jane Campion do walk away with this award, it will be one that was well-earned.\n\nPrediction : The Power of the Dog, written by Jane Campion\n\nWRITING (ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY) BELFAST Written by Kenneth Branagh DON'T LOOK UP Screenplay by Adam McKay; Story by Adam McKay & David Sirota KING RICHARD Written by Zach Baylin LICORICE PIZZA Written by Paul Thomas Anderson THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD Written by Eskil Vogt, Joachim Trier\n\nWhile Licorice Pizza is fun for the P.T. Anderson fan, and King Richard is a solid biopic about the man behind the astronomical fame of two iconic tennis stars, both of these films fall a hair short in terms of the scope needed to make a dent in the Academy Award competition, in my opinion. I still need to check out The Worst Person in the World, so my home stretch combatants may slightly shift if/when I get around to that, but to me, the winner of this category falls squarely down to the remaining two pictures.\n\nBelfast not only has the scope needed in terms of worldly relevance to be a strong contender, but it also seems to be coming from a very personal place. Kenneth Branagh pours tons of honesty and sincerity into what feels like an autobiographical tale, making Belfast a stirring and striking portrayal of an uneasy childhood. That being said, the way that Adam McKay is able to hit his normally humorous beats while raising some compelling points in terms of both the way we consume information and the way we treat our world.\n\nPrediction : Don’t Look Up, screenplay by Adam McKay, story by Adam McKay & David Sirota"
