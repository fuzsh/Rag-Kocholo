        "text": "In Daniel Craig’s final Bond film No Time to Die, before being blown up by missiles, he visits the grave of the woman who broke his heart, HM Treasury official Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale. And there she is pictured on a memorial plaque: actress Eva Green in all her fine-boned beauty.\n\nIt must have been very gratifying to see 007 still not over you, I say to Green. “I’ve been so busy I haven’t actually seen the film,” she replies. “But I’m still getting messages from friends saying, ‘Wow, Bond is still very, very upset about you!’ And, of course, I like that. Who doesn’t want to be missed by James Bond?”"
