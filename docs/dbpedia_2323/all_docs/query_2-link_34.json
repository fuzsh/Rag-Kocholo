In the aftermath, Donald Trump rode a wave of hostility, denial and resentment out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and crashed back at Mar-A-Lago, seemingly wounded, seemingly done. But he wasn't. And what was he building in there? Meridith McGraw, one of few reporters with access to Trump's inner circle, chronicles this pivotal time of the former president's seclusion in South Florida, resulting in a narrative of lies, conspiracy theories, and the near-total replacement of reality that has characterized the former president's response to his loss. How did we go from watching Trump's political banishment to watching his seemingly effortless domination of the other Republican hopefuls--Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Nikki Haley? How does he lead all the polls from beneath the heavy shadow of multiple federal indictments? The Mar-a-Lago gap is essential for understanding what Trump and his followers are thinking as they head into the 2024 election\"--\n\nCategories - Acls RSS Feeds\n\nBeneath these cursed stars\n\nAuthor: Ryan, Lexi, author.\n\nPublished: 2024\n\nCall Number: Y RYAN\n\nFormat: Books\n\nSummary: \"The first book in a ... romantic fantasy [duology] set in the ... world of These Hollow Vows.

The acclaimed author of The Seamstress of New Orleans brings to life Lydia Latrobe Roosevelt's defiant journey of 1811 in this lush, evocative biographical novel for fans of Paula McLain, Gill Paul, Allison Pataki, and stories about extraordinary yet little-known female adventurere; It's a journey that most deem an insane impossibility. Yet on October 20th, 1811, Lydia Latrobe Roosevelt--daughter of one of the architects of the United States Capitol--fearlessly boards the steamship New Orleans in Pittsburgh. Eight months pregnant and with a toddler in tow, Lydia is fiercely independent despite her youth. She's also accustomed to defying convention. Against her father's wishes, she married his much older business colleague, inventor Nicholas Roosevelt--builder of the New Orleans--and spent her honeymoon on a primitive flatboat. But the stakes for this trip are infinitely higher. If Nicholas's untried steamboat reaches New Orleans, it will serve as a profitable packet ship between that city and Natchez, proving the power of steam as it travels up and down the Mississippi. Success in this venture would revolutionize travel and trade, open the west to expansion, and secure the Roosevelts' future. Lydia had used her own architectural training to design the flatboat's interior, including a bedroom, sitting area, and fireplace. The steamship, however, dwarfs the canoes and flatboats on the river. And no amount of power or comfort could shield its passengers from risk. Lydia believes herself ready for all the dangers ahead--growing unrest among native people, disease or injury, and the turbulent Falls of the Ohio, a sixty-foot drop long believed impassable in such a large boat. But there are other challenges in store, impossible to predict as Lydia boards that fall day. Challenges which--if survived--will haunt and transform her, as surely as the journey will alter the course of a nation...\n\nCategories - Acls RSS Feeds\n\nThe Full Moon Coffee Shop : a novel\n\nAuthor: Mochizuki, Mai, author.

El Salvador, 1923. Graciela grows up on a volcano in a community of indigenous women indentured to coffee plantations owned by the country's wealthiest, until a messenger from the Capital comes to claim her: at nine years old she's been chosen to be an oracle for a rising dictator-a sinister, violent man wedded to the occult.

The two are a small fortress within the dictator's regime, but they're no match for El Gran Pendejo's cruelty.
