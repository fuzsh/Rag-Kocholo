        "text": "Over the last seven years Etgar Keret has had plenty of reasons to worry. His son, Lev, was born in the middle of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. His father became ill. And he has been constantly tormented by nightmarish visions of the Iranian president Ahmadinejad, anti-Semitic remarks both real and imagined, and, perhaps most worrisome of all, a dogged telemarketer who seems likely to chase him to the grave. Emerging from these darkly absurd circumstances is a series of funny, tender ruminations on everything from his three-year-old son’s impending military service to the terrorist mindset behind Angry Birds.\n\nMoving deftly between the personal and the political, the playful and the profound,Â The Seven Good Years takes a life-affirming look at the human need to find good in the least likely places, and the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of our capricious world.\n\nBorn in Tel Aviv in 1967, Etgar Keret is a leading voice in Israeli literature and cinema. He is the author of five bestselling story collections, which have been translated into thirty-five languages. His writing has been published in theÂ New York Times,Â Le Monde, theÂ Guardian, theÂ New Yorker, theÂ Paris ReviewÂ andÂ Esquire. He has also written a number of screenplays, andÂ Jellyfish, his first film as a director alongside his wife Shira Geffen, won the CamÃ©ra d’Or prize for best first feature at Cannes in 2007. In 2010 he was awarded the Chevalier medallion of France’s Order of Arts and Letters. Â www.etgarkeret.com"
