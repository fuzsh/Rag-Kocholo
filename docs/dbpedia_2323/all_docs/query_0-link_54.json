Dates should be hot, but not hot enough to warrant literal firefighters. Akilah, the girl Marlowe has been in love with for years, will never go out with her again.

With her house-sitting career up in flames, it seems the universe owes Marlowe a new summer job, and that's how she ends up at Morning House, a mansion built on an island in the 1920s and abandoned shortly thereafter.

Maybe this job isn't such a gift after all. Morning House has a horrific secret that's been buried for decades, and now the person who brought her here is missing. All it takes is one clue to set off a catastrophic chain of events. One small detail, just like a spark, could burn it all down--if someone doesn't bury Marlowe first\"--\n\nCategories - Acls RSS Feeds\n\nIf we were perfect\n\nAuthor: Huang, Ana, author.\n\nPublished: 2024 2020\n\nCall Number: F HUANG\n\nFormat: Books\n\nSummary: \"Olivia had a plan: MBA and Wall Street VP by thirty-two, plus marriage and two children.
