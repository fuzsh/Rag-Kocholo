        "text": "MONTREAL — Two prominent Israeli authors, Amir Gutfreund and Savyon Liebrecht, will appear during the 12th annual Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival being held April 21 to 25.\n\nSavyon Liebrecht\n\nGutfreund, whose debut novel Our Holocaust (Shoah Shelanu) was well received in 2000, was born in Haifa in 1963. He is the son of Holocaust survivors.\n\nHis collection of short stories, the bestselling The Shoreline Mansions, won Israel’s 2003 Sapir Prize for Literature, the country’s most lucrative literary award.\n\nGutfreund is a mathematician by profession, a graduate of the Technion, and works for the Israeli Air Force, holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nIn an interview after he received the Sapir Prize, Gutfreund told the newspaper Ha’aretz: “Even if I write an instruction manual for a washing machine, it will always contain humour, and it will always contain the Holocaust. It’s a part of me.”\n\nHe also said, although he is proud, it is not easy to be an Israeli Jew. “What a burden it is to be born both Jewish and Israeli; it’s like carrying five watermelons on your back all your life.”\n\nHis latest novel translated into English, The World, A Little Later, is the story of a European Jewish journalist who is sent to Palestine in 1918 to report about the lives of the Jewish pioneers. He has no intention of joining them, but is forced to remain when his newspaper is embezzled by its editor. The book is a tribute to the countless forgotten people who were among Israel’s founders.\n\nGutfreund speaks at the Jewish Public Library April 22 at 7 p.m.; at the Atwater Library April 23 at 12:30 p.m.; and with Liebrecht, April 23 at 4:30 p.m., in a panel discussion moderated by Montreal writer Elaine Kalman Naves, at the main festival venue, the Hotel Delta Centre-Ville.\n\nLiebrecht is also the child of Holocaust survivors and was born in Munich, Germany, in 1948. The family settled in Israel in 1950.\n\nLess known outside Israel, she has been publishing fiction since 1986 and is one of the country’s best-known authors and playwrights. Her works include six collections of short stories and novellas, and two novels.\n\nThe most recent, The Women My Father Knew, has just been translated into English. It’s a mystery with a literary twist, set in New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nShe will take part in two other panel discussions April 24.\n\n• For “The Perils of Politics” at 11:30 a.m., Liebrecht joins other fiction writers whose works delve into politics, including Lebanese poet Joumana Haddad, who will receive the festival’s Arab Literary Prize, sponsored by the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage. This event is moderated by CBC Radio arts reporter Jeanette Kelly.\n\n• Liebrecht participates in “Reading – And Writing – the World” at 5 p.m., a look at the influence of place on the imagination, moderated by Hannah Sung, host of CBC’s online Book Club.\n\nGutfreund and Liebrecht’s participation is sponsored by the Israel Consulate, which has designated April as Israeli Book Month. Another Israeli author, Eshkol Nevo, will speak at the Indigo bookstore, 1500 McGill College, on Yom Ha’atzmaut, April 20 at 2 p.m.\n\nBorn in Jerusalem in 1971 and partially raised in Detroit, Nevo’s first full-length novel Homesick, which was published by Random House in English and Gallimard in French in 2008, won a prize that year at Paris’ Salon du Livre.\n\nIt’s set in a former Arab village midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, now home to Jewish immigrants from Kurdistan and elsewhere.\n\nThe consulate will present a collection of Israeli books in English and French translation to the Atwater Library when Gutfreund speaks there.\n\nA number of local Jewish writers are also speaking at Blue Metropolis this year, among them Concordia University history professor Frank Chalk, an expert in genocide; Maurice Chalom, an intercultural relations and immigration specialist who recently wrote his first narrative, Va, Moshone; Ottawa-based crime novelist Barbara Fradkin, creator of the Insp. Michael Green series; novelist and translator David Homel; veteran Iraqi-born writer Naim Kattan, whose most recent novel is Le Veilleur; Monique Polak, whose latest young adult novel is What World Is Left, inspired by her mother’s Holocaust experience; Olivia Tapiero, who, last year, at 19, was the upset winner of the Prix Robert-Cliche for her first novel Les Murs; and Tecia Werbowski, who was born in Poland during World War II, best known for her novellas, some of which have been in staged in Prague, which is her second home.\n\nOne of the more intriguing sessions during the festival is a talk by Lamberto Tassinari, a former Université de Montréal professor of Italian language and literature, who will make the case that William Shakespeare was really John Florio. Tassinari has written a book End of a Lie: John Florio, The Man Who Was Shakespeare, in which he argues that the Bard was a learned Italian immigrant to England, whose father’s family were converted Jews. Tassinari is interviewed by Globe and Mail arts reporter Michael Posner April 25 at 1 p.m."
