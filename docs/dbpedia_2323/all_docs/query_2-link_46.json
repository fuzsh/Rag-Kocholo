        "text": "Living Happy Extra\n\nCARRIE JONES\n\nJUL 29, 2023\n\nI posted this on my substack last week, but I thought I might share it here, too!\n\nAlso, I’m teaching a free workshop at the Writing Barn, August 22. You should come! Here’s the link\n\nI was born backwards and with the caul wrapped around my head. For a long time, doctors thought I was blind, but then, eventually, my eyes reacted to light. At one, I had an operation. But even then, after the patches and then with tiny blue glasses perched on my itty-bitty nose, I didn’t see right. I’d see eight of things, then eventually four, and then eventually two, until the ability to use both eyes at the same time left.\n\nStuck at age five, still with glasses, but unable to see the world with any depth. I grew up terrible at volleyball, baseball, tennis because I couldn’t judge how close the ball was to my face when it flew through the air. I ran into trees when I raced bikes in the woods behind Deb Muir’s house because I misjudged the jumps they made with plywood. I’d run through my own back woods, searching for Bigfoot and take massive Superman diggers, tripped up by New Hampshire tree roots that I didn’t realize were quite so high.\n\nThe bruises collected, but I refused to accept that I wasn’t seeing the world the right way, that everyone else could except me.\n\nMy mother, god bless her, was proficient at fixing broken glasses and pressing cold compresses on bruises, smoking her Marlboro Lights and admonishing me to protect myself.\n\n“You don’t have to always be going and doing, Carrie,” she’d say while giving me a kiss and a hug, removing an ice pack or putting on a bandage. “It’s okay to sometimes just be still.”\n\nMy mother, god bless her again, wasn’t very still herself. “You’re going to be the death of me,” she’d say sadly before sending me off with a kiss. I wasn’t. Diabetes and those cigarettes were.\n\nLIMINAL SPACES\n\nI wrote a post over here this morning about my town and liminal spaces—those transitory thresholds in our world, our architecture, our community, our own lives. And it may have sort of done me in, which was bad planning on my part when it comes to this post.\n\nBut I’m going to give it a go. When I think about my inability to see the world correctly, in all its full 3D glory, I think a lot about the liminal spaces, the existing in between things.\n\nThe liminal space is often defined as that in between. You are not where you were, maybe, and not where you want to be, maybe.\n\nThere are a lot of maybes when it comes to liminality. Just like there are a lot of maybes when you move through the world without depth perception.\n\nLiminal means threshold. In architecture it’s often defined as “the physical space between one destination and the next.”\n\nThere are tons of internet spaces (see what I did there?) that talk about physical liminal spaces, but the kind I’m a little more interested right now are the ones in a life.\n\nSome people think liminal spaces have a sense of unease to them. Some think it’s more magical.\n\nI like to think of it as both. It’s a place where you can feel change coming sometimes and change can be scary as heck but also so magical and full of possibility.\n\nIt’s when you just graduate and don’t have a job yet. It’s when you move to a new city or are about to leave the old one. It’s when you apply to college and aren’t sure where you’ll attend or when you are about to go to high school—that whole summer before. It’s when you’re waiting for an operation, when your kids go to college, when you’re about to retire or separate or you need to figure out a new way to make enough money to survive or thrive.\n\nA quick look at word origins shows us that the base of liminal is limen, which is Latin for threshold.\n\nLiminal places are thresholds, stairways, elevators, escalators. Liminal spaces are the space or the moment or the location between one point and another.\n\nRichard Rohr describes the emotional/life journey part of liminality as:\n\n“…an inner state and sometimes an outer situation where we can begin to think and act in new ways. It is where we are betwixt and between, having left one room or stage of life but not yet entered the next.”\n\nLIMINALITY AND CONSTANT INPUT\n\nI think, though, that it can be smaller than what Rohr talks about. You can enter these spaces every day when you pause and notice where you are, what you’re doing, how you’re feeling; when you take a breath between one task and another one; when you connect with just existing instead of focusing on thinking and doing.\n\nWeird, I know, right?\n\nBut the way my brain ended up being wired after an illness gave me epilepsy in college is that most of the time my brain isn’t thinking in words or in pictures; it’s just sort of there. Just being.\n\nShaun, my husband, will constantly ask me what I’m thinking about and I’ll say, “Nothing.”\n\nSuper frustrating for poor Shaun, but that’s because a lot of the time my thoughts aren’t in words, they are just in knowings. And a lot of times the knowings are quiet and still. I know! I know! You now know too much about my brain.\n\nAnyway, emptiness is kind of scary. We rush away from it even picking up our phone when we’re in the bathroom to play Wordle, or by scrolling through whatever social media app we’re into when we’re on the couch because it’s too hard to just sit and surrender to doing nothing or to that very big nothingness.\n\nWhen my daughter was little, she wouldn’t go to sleep easily. I’d ask her why, wondering if she had nightmares. “What are you scared of?”\n\n“The emptiness,” she’d say. “The nothing.”\n\n“When you’re asleep?”\n\n“No,” she’d say, “before.”\n\nThat cliff between being asleep and awake can sometimes be full of the nothing that she was afraid of, but it can also be a place where the conscious and subconscious sort of dance together like in a surreal painting.\n\nThe cool truth of this world is that we don’t all have to fill our days up and our brains up all of the time. The cool truth of this world is that we can all think and exist and see in different ways or in ways that are the same. The cool truth of this world is that those liminal spaces can be launching points toward something extraordinary.\n\nLiving Happy and Write Better Now! is a mostly self-supported publication.

She was born in 1896, which means she’d be 127 now if she was still alive, which is kind of staggering. She died in 2001, which if my math is right, means she made it to 104, which is pretty staggering, too. My dad was her youngest child and I was his youngest child by a lot, which is why I’m not 80 right now.\n\nAnyway, my grandmother was about 4-foot-10 and she loved art and books and music and deep thought. She wasn’t a positive person. This was not a woman who would give you a pep talk. Ever. I mean, if you think about it, she’d lived through two world wars and a depression.\n\nShe painted. She was embarrassed by her creations and would hide if her sons bragged about them.\n\nShe wrote poems. She said they were swill.\n\nBut she had this appreciation—this state of awe—for so many things.\n\nShe’d see a perfectly formed tomato and tears would come to her eyes. She’d touch her grandchild’s (or great grandchild’s) arm or cheek and marvel at the softness, the texture, the youth of their skin, the clarity of their eyes. She greatly appreciated things—small things and refined things.\n\nA painting by me.\n\nBecause she fed a family during the Great Depression in Staten Island, she would wax poetic, in total awe, over butchering a piece of meat and bemoan the state of meat in grocery stores in the 1990s (and probably before that).\n\nAccording to the Greater Good Magazine, “Awe is the feeling we get in the presence of something vast that challenges our understanding of the world, like looking up at millions of stars in the night sky or marveling at the birth of a child. When people feel awe, they may use other words to describe the experience, such as wonder, amazement, surprise, or transcendence.”\n\nEvery time I put something out (art, a news story, a blog post, a book, even something as simple as a Facebook post), I think of my grammy and how cool it would have been if she could have been okay with not being perfect and with sharing things she might want to share. I remember my little kid self looking at her paintings with awe and reading her poems and trying to understand the mystery in the enjambments and in the lines. I had fierce grandmothers, too. But Grammy Barnard? She was the one who fell in love with the world, one skin touch, one tomato, at a time.\n\nMay you feel awe today. May you be brave enough and open enough to let a tomato’s perfection bring you to tears. May you marvel in beauty of skin. May you inhale the world around you and embrace those things that make your understanding a tiny bit bigger.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s okay to be milquetoast if you want to be\n\nWhen my daughter was little, she was at a preschool and another girl attacked her, knocking her down, roaring like a lion, saying she was going to eat her up. My daughter’s dress was ripped. When I picked her up, the teachers said, “Don’t worry, we talked to the other girl about why she was feeling aggressive.”\n\n“Yes,” I said, “but did any of you talk to my little girl?”\n\nThey hadn’t. Not really.\n\nAnd my daughter never returned to that preschool.\n\nThat other girl? She’s all grown up now and still not a nice human being.\n\nIt’s lovely to reach out with empathy toward people who hurt others. But it’s equally, if not more important, to reach out to the people who are right there, in that moment, feeling hurt.\n\nThat’s something I believe. It’s okay if you don’t believe it, too.\n\nAnd that’s always been part of what I believe. I believe that we take care of the person who has been hurt first so that they know they didn’t deserve it and so that they know that they deserve care. And then we also take care of the person who did the hurting.\n\nThis has a point, I promise.\n\nI went to cover a protest in Northeast Harbor this weekend. The protestors were chill. The three guys working security were chill. Protestors greeted each other with hugs. They called out to my very tall, very white, very walks-like-a-cop husband who was taking pictures, asking who he was. He was taking photos. So was I. But nobody asked me who I was, which was kind of interesting.\n\nAnyway, Northeast Harbor is a place where some incredibly wealthy people live or have lived. It’s a town on MDI near my town of Bar Harbor.\n\nThe powerful and the privileged are very much alive in Northeast Harbor. But the thing is that the powerful and the privileged are still just humans. Some of them do things that get protested like Leonard Leo. Some of them don’t.\n\nBut what I noticed was how much the protestors believed in what they were doing. They were adamant in what their hearts and brains felt was right. There’s a woman in our town, Annlinn Kruger, she’s the same way. She 100 percent believes that consistently chalking GOOGLE LEONARD LEO will inform more people about Leonard Leo. And she’s truly consistent. And she’s persistent. And even if you don’t agree with her or the protestors who have been going to Leo’s house since 2019 or so, you have to think, “Wow. That’s commitment.”\n\nThey remind me of the Stoics like Cato and Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius; some were born wealthy and some not so much. Some are men. Some are women. Some are agender. But they are all there. Committed.\n\nThe Daily Stoic had an email out today where it wrote,\n\n“Yet advantaged or disadvantaged, all the Stoics possessed a certain power, a certain freedom by way of their philosophy. The Stoics, rich and poor alike, were equally independent and defiant. They were in command of themselves, they knew what was good and what wasn’t, they knew what was true and what wasn’t and no one–through force or temptation–could make them think otherwise.\n\n“’If you can read in at least one language, then you have this–the tool to educate yourself,’ the great LeVar Burton said before receiving a lifetime achievement Emmy Award last year. ‘No one can hold sway over your mind, your imagination, your dreams if you can read.’ Or as Epictetus said a couple centuries earlier, ‘the educated are free.’”\n\n“A strong mind, a mind that knows how to learn, that knows how to get to the core of things? This mind is stronger than tyrants, than slave owners, than serpent-tongued manipulators. They might be able to throw you in jail or bombard you with disinformation, but they can’t actually get to what matters within you.”\n\nWhat you believe in is connected to how well you believe in yourself. Knowledge about the world is power, right? But also knowledge of your self is power, too.\n\nWhat are the maxims and rules that help you get through the day? Do you think about them when you make decisions? Are they engrained in you?\n\nBack in 2013, Paul Hudson wrote for Elite Daily,\n\n“It is not possible to know yourself if you do not know what you believe in. If you do not believe in anything then why are you living? What purpose do you have? Why bother getting up in the morning? If you don’t have maxims that you hold true, that you believe are either the way the world works or the way the world ought to work, then whatever actions you take have no purpose, no direction.\n\n“You’re living a life carved with circular paths — a life that that has no end in sight, only random actions leading in all directions. Our beliefs make us who we are. If you are looking for yourself or looking to recreate yourself, start with your beliefs.”\n\nWhen I was in college, one of my philosophy professors had us write our own personal credos. I may have been the only person who did the assignment, but I have a clear memory of sitting on the grass outside my four-story brick dorm and writing out all the things I really believed in my little composition notebook. I was too poor for a computer.\n\nI was super into it.\n\nSo, how do you do that? How do you make your own credo?\n\nThe Argonaut School has a podcast and post about it. It suggests three starting questions.\n\n“What kind of person do you want to be? How do you hope others will see you?\n\nWhat do you want to stand for?”\n\nAnother way to go after your own is here. But I think it’s okay to just freewheel it. Write what matters to you. Write who you want to be.\n\nIt can help. A couple of weeks ago, someone in our town (most likely one of the protesters and/or her son) wrote a satirical newspaper where they said my hyper-local news blog was milquetoast. I know! Fancy word, right? And I wasn’t offended. I laughed. Why? Well, it was somewhat clever, I guess. I mean, it was a big, fancy word.\n\nBut mostly I didn’t care because all my life people have called me timid because I am so focused on being fair and understanding all the facts and ideas from multiple perspectives.\n\nAll my life, people have said that I was meek because I try so hard to be as unbiased and kind as I can be (sometimes I fail). That’s just who I want to be. Maybe at some magical day in the future it won’t be who I want to be, but it is who I want to be right now.\n\nAnd it’s also why I’m not 100 percent onboard with the Argonaut School’s way of approaching your credo. I don’t think what matters is how other people see me. I think what matters is how I see me.\n\nMaybe the questions should be:\n\nHow do you see yourself? Are you the person you want to be? What do you stand for? What do you not stand for?\n\nThe things we do to other people, the ways we react, can shape us and them. When those teachers took care of the violent girl instead of my daughter, my daughter learned that you can’t depend on authority figures—even the super kind ones—to take care of you when you’re hurt. She ended up being a leader, a captain in the military, an artist, a writer, a friend, an adventurer, a thinker, someone who helps people, but also someone who knows she herself has a whole lot of worth.\n\nI had to work super hard to make sure that she always knew that she was valued and deserved to be cared for. She did that work, too. Now, that’s something is ingrained in her. But it could have gone a really different way.\n\nIt’s something to think about at least, right? I hope you have fun thinking about it!\n\nSo, I blog over on LIVING HAPPY and WRITE BETTER NOW every Saturday, Monday and Tuesday.

It wasn’t just that his hands would curl into fists. It was the movement of his arms, the hunching of his shoulders, how his legs suddenly pointed out when he walked, how his chest expanded, how his arms swung.\n\n“He looks like a gorilla,” I would think usually backing up, hands out, placating. “Just like a gorilla.”\n\nIt seemed ridiculous to me, a bizarre observation in the midst of a difficult time.\n\nIt turns out that I wasn’t all that wrong.\n\nTHE STUDY OF EMOTIONS\n\nFor a long time people have thought of emotional intelligence as a bit of a soft skill and the study of emotion as not as academically rigorous as other scientific studies.\n\nIn Ursula Hess’ paper, “Darwin and Emotion Expression” she writes,\n\n“Darwin’s basic message was that emotion expressions are evolved and (at least at some point in the past) adaptive. For Darwin, emotion expressions not only originated as part of an emotion process that protected the organism or prepared it for action but also had an important communicative function. Darwin saw in this communicative function a further adaptive value: ‘We have also seen that expression in itself, or the language of the emotions, as it has sometimes been called, is certainly of importance for the welfare of mankind’” (Darwin, 1872/1965, p. 366).\n\nThe book she references is from 1872 and its called The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals. It was a radical book at the time because Darwin was a radical kind of guy. And everyone else was into creationism while he was pro-evolution.\n\nHe basically said that there are 45 emotions and that you can follow their paths back to mammalian behaviors. Emotions were and are, according to Darwin, how we have evolved from primates and mammals.\n\nDacher Keltner, Ph.D., founding faculty director, Greater Good Science Center, professor of psychology and director of the Berkeley Social Interaction Laboratory, UC Berkeley E says,\n\n“So dogs show forms of guilt that you might see in humans. Other kinds of species—the primates show threat displays that look like our anger displays, and so on.”\n\nFreud took a couple steps back and said that we just have two main emotions: desire and destruction. Paul Ekman expanded our understanding again and even defined emotional characteristics. Though they feel un-triggered, emotions are often triggered by our brains looking for clues of how to figure out and react to the world.\n\nKeltner says,\n\n“And now, in the field, we think that the emotions do a couple of really important things.\n\nThe first is, they systematically orient your mind to attend to certain things and to make certain kinds of decisions. Emotions provide a lot of really important information into what we think matters in the current environment, what we think we should do, what we think is of value or worrisome. They guide thought.\n\nAnd then the second function that emotions serve—and we often lose sight of this, which is that emotions orient action. They move you towards particular kinds of action. When you’re feeling angry in a negotiation, that’s moving you,\n\nGerben Van Kleef has shown in Holland, toward being strong in the negotiation and making sure you get your way. So this functional view of emotions, that they guide thought in systematic ways and guide our action, actually yields really important insights that I hope you’re self-aware of.\n\nIs there a scientific consensus about, what are the emotions, what are the different states that we should be aware of when we’re at work?\n\nAnd it’s really interesting.\n\nBecause this is a young science, we don’t have the periodic chart of what the emotions are.\n\nNot yet.\n\nWhat we think of in the field right now is there are about 20 different emotions. There are negative emotions, like guilt and shame and fear and anger and envy and embarrassment, and there are positive emotions, like joy and contentment and gratitude and love, sympathy, awe, and beauty.”\n\nThere’s a really cool and easy to understand (bonus!) website from Frontiers for Young Minds that explains how emotions work. But basically emotions tend to be studied by breaking apart their building blocks which are:\n\nWhat happens in your body\n\nWhat you are thinking, what you’re conscious of\n\nAnd how your actions and behavior are expressed.\n\nPretty cool, right? There are other ways of thinking about it and studying it as well, such as mood meters, but for me as a regular non scientist and a writer, I think that those linkages of those three elements help me understand the people I recreate on the page and the people that I just talk to in life.\n\nWhen we understand a little more about emotion, it can help us as humans with our own emotions, but it also can help us as humans to survive and thrive in our interactions with others and not think, “he looks like a gorilla right now, how absurd,” but to actually take appropriate action.\n\nAs it’s written in Funderstanding (best website name ever),\n\n“Accurately identifying others’ emotions is essential to our social well-being and happiness. The ability to pick up on others’ emotions helps us manage, communicate, and collaborate with them more effectively. Put simply, it enables us to get along better with people in general. The inability or non-conscious choice not to identify how people are feeling can easily lead to conflict and problems. When I was teaching middle school, I noticed this skill deficit in a number of my students. During my first year or two supervising the middle school cafeteria during lunch (I did this for eleven years), students who were the most challenging to manage were often those who didn’t accurately read other students’ emotions, or mine.”\n\nThe next step in a better world is probably caring about other’s emotions and having empathy, but to do that it helps to build the skill of identifying that emotion. Funderstanding has some great ideas at the end of that above linked article to do just that.\n\nPOSTS FROM LAST WEEK OVER ON LIVING HAPPY (my Substack)\n\nThe Man Who Called Me Miss America\n\nForgiving Yourself and Others\n\nBE BRAVE FRIDAY\n\nThere are all sorts of levels of bravery, you know?\n\nSometimes being brave is just waking up in the morning.\n\nSometimes being brave is crying because someone sees you or because they don’t.\n\nSometimes being brave is putting your life on the line or your reputation.\n\nSometimes being brave is insisting that you have a voice when people insist you don’t.\n\nSometimes being brave is opening up your heart and sometimes it’s shutting it down.\n\nSometimes being brave is just breathing in and out.\n\nSometimes being brave is just leaning away from the thought that you’re an imposter, that you’re not worthy and leaning into owning your light, your power, your joy.\n\nYou know what you do. You know how you live. You know when others are being brave. It’s okay to know when you are too, okay? Give yourself some props. You deserve them.\n\nHere’s my painting in progress. I tried to post it last week and wimped out and deleted the post. I know! I know! So brave.\n\nYou can buy some of my art here.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe two women were walking down the sidewalk toward the library, heading toward me. I knew one of them. Everyone in town knows her. I’d met with her a few months ago, confused about why she’d wanted to meet me. Whatever the reason, it was obvious that I’d failed the test the way I do sometimes.\n\nI’d reached out to her again. She never responded. I tried one more time. Nothing.\n\nMaybe her email was chaos. I know mine is. I didn’t worry about it. I tend not to stress about that sort of thing.\n\nAnd now as she and this other woman walked by, she kept her head down, talking.\n\nNow, maybe she really didn’t see me, but she’s not a woman who misses much. And I saw them and I’m blind in one eye.\n\nHowever, invisibility was a possibility because on our sidewalk, her friend didn’t move over so that we could go by single file. She bumped into me the way you bump into people in a high school hallway when you don’t like them too much.\n\nRight then: I made an assumption. I assumed that the ignoring, the bump, they were on purpose.\n\nThen I put my foot back on the sidewalk, kept striding like Beyoncé was playing in the background, and shook it off like Taylor Swift, swallowing something unspeakable, a tiny bit of pain that comes from not being ignored, but also disrespected, that feeling that some people give you when you realize that they wanted something from you and you didn’t provide it and now you aren’t worth sharing the sidewalk with.\n\nBut that’s an assumption—a horrible assumption. I have no idea about their intents.\n\nIt could have been something totally different, something that had nothing to do with me but with whatever they were talking about, engrossed in. They could be suffering in ways I can’t even imagine. So, they can have the sidewalk if they need it. It’s okay.\n\nHere’s the thing that’s bigger than those two women and me. It’s hard sometimes to only be seen when someone wants something from you. It’s hard sometimes to be ignored. And that may not be what happened with me and that woman, but it happens all the time to people.\n\nThat breaks my heart. We’re all better than that. We all can be.\n\nReal connections are important, those kinds of connections that stay hard and fast and true, the kind that don’t create unspeakable feelings that you have to gulp down, but the kind that you get to sing out, strong and true. You can’t get those if you choose not to see other people.\n\nIn this world, we have so many choices to see, to really see, other people beyond labels, beyond the bubbles of our own experience and our wants. We can choose to be cheerleaders, leaders, friends, bailsmen, helpers, students, teachers, people who give others a second chance or even a third one. And we can choose not to.\n\nSo, the next time I see that lady, I’m going to loudly say hello. That’s what being brave can be about, right? Being seen. And seeing others, too, even when they don’t see you any longer.\n\nHere is my chaotic painting. Color is mixed. Technique is mixed. There are no angels in it yet. But there will be, somewhere, seeing.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWrite Better Now Roundup\n\nHave you ever been at a party and someone tells a story and you just don’t care?\n\nHave you ever been that person telling the story and realized mid-story that everyone’s eyes have dulled over?\n\nYou feel trapped. You want the story to be over (especially if you’re the one telling it). You know something has gone wrong because you can feel it. The communication of failure is instant.\n\nThe problem with writing a novel is that you can’t see when that happens: when (Shakespeare help us all) the reader stops being hooked by the story, no longer cares about what happens.\n\nThat’s terrifying, right?\n\nThere are two major elements that keep a reader turning that page or scrolling down:\n\nCuriosity—the need to know what happens next\n\nCare—the connection and concern and emotion for the characters.\n\nIn Characters & Viewpoint, Orson Scott Card writes, “The intensity of the characters’ feeling, as long as it remains believable and bearable, will greatly intensify the reader’s feelings—whatever they are.”\n\nSo, be intense if you want your readers to care about what’s happening, but don’t be so intense that they can’t handle it.\n\nTo do that you want to give your character:\n\nA goal that the reader knows—something that matters to the character\n\nChoices that might hinder the character getting to that goal or help them\n\nSacrifices that happen so that the reader sees that the character has an internal struggle getting to that goal.\n\nWhen it comes to curiosity, that’s the hook that keeps us moving forward and wondering what will happen to the character in the story. The choices, the emotions that arrive with those choices, are what makes the reader curious about what will happen.\n\nA MasterClass post says,\n\n“Most techniques to hook a reader have one thing in common: They force the reader to ask questions. A good hook—whether it uses action, emotion, a strong statement, or another technique—will have your reader guessing about your characters’ motivations, backstories, and more. Maybe in high school, you learned to start an essay with a rhetorical question. Try that same technique now, but leave the actual question out of the finished piece. Instead, set up a scene that leads your reader to come up with the question on their own.”\n\nWRITING EXERCISE\n\nThink of a scenario for your story (or just a scenario if you don’t have a story):\n\nZombie hamsters are coming down the street.\n\nThe tea mug your uncle gave you has a secret message on the bottom.\n\nYour mom just told you she’s part oak tree.\n\nNow, think of a question and write the scenario and scene toward that question.\n\nPLACE TO SUBMIT\n\nCall for Submissions: Jewish Fiction.net\n\nDeadline: Year-round\n\nJewish Fiction .net, a prestigious literary journal, invites submissions for its December 2023 issue.
