        "text": "Shame on the Sydney Morning Herald for publishing the headline grabbing, and biased article ‘Blood Sugar Wars – What’s the Best Diet for Diabetes’ yesterday.\n\nDespite the seemingly screwed reporting by SMH reporter Paula Goodyer, recipient of the Dietitians Association of Australia Excellence in Nutrition Journalism Award 2015 and either the winner or the Runner Up in that category every year since 2012 http://daa.asn.au/…/daa-excellence-in-nutrit…/award-winners/ ; it must be noted that Launceston man, Tony Benneworth, has come off ALL his Type 2 diabetes medications following a Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat lifestyle.\n\nNot only is LCHF approved by the CSIRO, but it is currently being rolled out as a Masterclass to GP’s in Australia via seminars and webinars run by Associate Professor Grant Brinkworth of the CSIRO and Professor Gary Wittert.\n\nTony agreed to be part of the ‘Saving Australia Diet’ after being told by his GP he was a walking time bomb of poor health. He adopted a Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat lifestyle mentored by Dr. Gary Fettke, an orthopaedic surgeon in Launceston who is confronted by the complications of diabetes every week in his practice, and Chef Pete Evans as part of the TV special.\n\nBehind the scenes Tony was fully supervised by his local GP and his personalised nutrition plan was created by Accredited Practising Dietitians, Nutritionists and a Credentialled Diabetes Educator at the Nutrition for Life Centre in Launceston (which was shown in each episode).\n\nTony came off ALL diabetes medications and has continued to maintain normal blood glucose readings including his HbA1c in normal range. He no longer has any blood markers indicative of Type 2 diabetes.He also changed his heart B pattern to a normal A pattern, indicating he now has no cardiac risk either and has come off his statins.\n\nUnfortunately, Cassandra, who followed the standard DAA advice is still classified as someone with diabetes because her blood glucose control is medically assisted. That doesn’t mean she hasn’t acheived amazing results, it just means it is still a journey for her.\n\nPaula Goodyer’s association with the DAA could make one question the bias of her reporting and a conflict of interest that is undeclared to her readership.\n\nSince when did helping people take back control of their health become a ‘Blood Sugar War’?\n\nAll 3 participants (NOT contestants) of the Channel Seven Sunday Night program showed marked improvements in their blood glucose readings simply by reducing foods that were high in processed carbohydrates, high in sugar and looking at portion control.\n\nThe ‘takeaway’ message from the Saving Australia Diet is about the importance of nutrition education, support, accountability and motivation for individuals from a team of healthcare professionals. To me it showed there was no right or wrong way, and each case was individualised.\n\nDragging in my husband, Dr. Gary Fettke, and reporting inaccurate information (Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat not High Fat as written) and highlighting his current ‘silencing’ by AHPRA, the Australian Medical Regulatory Board, seriously raises the question on a public platform “Who IS qualified to give nutrition advice?” and it challenges me to ask who started ‘the war’ and what (or whom) is it really about? …\n\nSurely it can’t be 3 innocent people who agreed to go on television to improve their Type 2 diabetes outcomes?\n\n“Clare Collins, a spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, is also concerned about some of the ‘experts’ used to guide the diets in the program. Gary Fettke who helped design Tony’s low carb, high fat diet is a surgeon not a diabetes specialist. He’s also under investigation by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and reportedly been cautioned not to advise on the nutritional management of diabetes because it’s outside his scope of practise.” wrote Paula Goodyer\n\nThis is about people’s health and the epidemic of Type 2 diabetes in Australia. When will people stop the personal attacks and pettiness and work together to find the common ground. It is about the message not the messenger.\n\n#savingaustraliadiet #wecantwait\n\nDeclaration of interest:\n\nNutrition for Life was co founded by Gary and Belinda Fettke in 2014 to help people take back control of their health with personalised nutrition advice from a team of health professionals. Neither Gary nor Belinda see any clients in a clinical setting at Nutrition for Life.\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellbeing/nutrition/blood-sugar-wars–whats-the-best-diet-for-diabetes-20160911-gre0id.html\n\nhttp://www.juicedaily.com.au/food/blood-sugar-wars-whats-the-best-diet-for-diabetes/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/belindanofructose/posts/1116935655067551\n\nI would love to invite you to enjoy a cup of tea (or coffee) ‘virtually’ with me this afternoon, while you take the time to read my post and consider supporting some important independent research into the role of nutritional ketosis in the management of cancer.\n\nWhy? Because it is seemingly impossible to get industry funding for something that won’t make money for ‘Industry’. And if you consider ‘Industry’ as a business model, not making a profit is a perfectly understandable reason … Why invest dollars into something you won’t get a return from, especially if you have stakeholders and investors that you need to be accountable to and make a profit for?\n\nTherefore, by not investing in research into “food as medicine” because of ‘Industry’s’ conflict of interest, may just be creating a huge disadvantage to the people who are dealing with cancer and their outcomes.\n\nAs many of you may know, my husband Gary was diagnosed with cancer in 2000 with a tumour at the base of his pituitary, which required surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for 11 1/2 years.\n\nNever once was his diet discussed or questioned. And he thought he was eating healthily. 5 years ago his typical day started with a bowl of muesli, low fat milk & fruit yoghurt, a glass of fruit juice, plus wholemeal toast with honey and peanut butter if he was in for a long operating session.\n\nIt wasn’t until our pharmacist mentioned to Gary in 2011 that he should consider trialling a drug called Metformin that he thought about the role of sugar and cancer. Metformin is currently used to manage Type 2 diabetes and interestingly – an unexpected side effect that had been noted in people using the drug was a reduced incidence of cancer, or a remission of their cancer. When Gary read up on Metformin its main role was to ‘stop the uptake of sugar’.\n\nGary questioned why he would take another medication when he could potentially just stop eating sugar??\n\nHe began asking questions from healthcare professionals and came up against a brickwall time and again. He began doing his own research into fructose metabolism which was only described by Luc Tappy in 2010, so research and textbooks written before this time don’t take any of this into account.\n\nResearching the Warburg Effect made Gary question the role of sugar, insulin and cancer.\n\nGary’s cancer has not been active for 3 1/2 years since changing to a Low Carbohydrate Healthy Fat lifestyle. He has not required any more chemotherapy for his cancer since going into Nutritional Ketosis.\n\nNutritional Ketosis may be protective of healthy cells, while potentially starving cancer cells that use sugar as their energy source. It may just be the perfect adjunct to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the initial stages of cancer diagnosis and the perfect management tool for longer term outcomes. It may even help prevent cancer in the first place …\n\nThat is why this research is so important to me.\n\nTurning to the Wisdom of the Crowds, we need to ask people to invest in research that could potentially change their own health outcomes and those of their family’s.\n\nI am proud to be supporting the work of Eugene Fine and Richard Feinman as researchers into a ketogenic diet and the role it plays in the management and health outcomes of people who are faced with the devastating diagnosis of cancer.\n\nI realise many people reading this post already understand the importance of adopting a Low Carb Healthy Fat way of living for their health. And you probably don’t think you need to support research…\n\nBut the truth is, that until we can prove it; until we can present independent supportive research, we can’t change policy. We can’t ask for the national dietary guidelines to be changed to reflect the option of low carbohydrate management in Type 2 diabetes and to be considered as an adjunt to current cancer care. We can’t ask healthcare professionals to advise patients about the benefits because they honestly believe they risk losing their jobs. They risk losing their registration to peak medical and allied health professions, and they risk being silenced …\n\nAs a society, we continue to spend billions of dollars researching the role of chemotherapy, radiation and have looked at epigenetics for years, but we have almost completely ignored any research funding into the effect of nutrition and cancer.\n\nI am asking you to help Eugene Fine and Richard Feinman start the conversations that will question the concept of cancer as a metabolic model of disease. Asking the question ‘what if the food people are eating also contributes to the incidence, and the short and long term health outcomes of cancer.\n\nWe have somehow ignored the idea that our nutrition also needs to be seen as an important adjunct to the role of chemotherapy and/or radiation in the management of cancer.\n\nDespite mounting evidence from worldwide research into the adverse role sugar may be playing in cancer management, we continue to promote morning tea cancer fundraisers – literally exploding with refined sugars and highly processed foods, and invest millions of dollars raised for cancer research every year.\n\nPlease help make a difference.\n\nThank you for your support and for sharing this far and wide.\n\nBelinda\n\nhttps://experiment.com/projects/part-2-can-low-carbohydrate-ketogenic-diets-inhibit-cancers\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/belindanofructose/posts/1115110675250049"
