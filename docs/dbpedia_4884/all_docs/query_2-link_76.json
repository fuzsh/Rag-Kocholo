        "text": "Sheila (Wash)\n\nMrs Benneworth coming up behind us in the dinner canteen and shaking us if we hadn't finished our dinner! Terrifying!!\n\nMrs Haddakin pulling teeth out - by tying string to the tooth and classroom door - and slamming it shut!\n\nMaking the 'First Fridays' early morning mass - and having sandwiches for breakfast back in the assembly room - with tea being poured from that huge tin teapot. Lovely.\n\nBeing given the job with Julie Clift of being responsible for washing up the teachers' cups and saucers during break time - and getting out of having to go outside in the cold!\n\nSwimming lessons at St George's baths....\n\nMay processions and singing 'May is the Month of Mary...'\n\nListening to the boys in the playground shouting 'all up for US Cavalry.....' and walking around with their arms outstretched, until someone tagged on. When they had enough people tagging on - the 'US Cavalry' game began.\n\nLearning to dance 'the Gay Gordons' ! and 'strip the willow' !!\n\nWas it 'Singing with Mother'? or something like that - where we listened to a record/or radio and had to sing along - 'Sweet lass of Richmond Hill' springs to mind !!\n\nThe reading corner - and reading 'Bindy come home' - sad tale about a dog.\n\nEileen Cahill, Julie Clift and Elaine Yoward - my best buddies and still in touch with them now.\n\nHaving to wear 'Ladybird' dresses - awful !\n\nCapaldi's ice cream - on St George's Day ! Valerie Capaldi was in my class.\n\nMargaret Brosnan & Cath McMahon (Both White)\n\nRe Michael Carrigan\n\nWe never saw Michael in 'bad form'. He always had a smile in his eyes and he lit up the whole room with his lovely way. He was mischievous and had a great sense of fun. He was such an important member of the 'gang'.\n\nWhen he died he had a small scratch on one of his cheeks and he looked so angelic. For us this was our first 'Wake' and experience of someone dying. He was so young and and the impression upon us all left us heartbroken and even as we recall these memories we still feel something of the sense of loss we felt all those years ago.\n\nThe White family and the Carrigan family are still in touch and the sense of respect and love we felt for them so many years ago still remains to this day even though the miles between us exist.\n\nThank you for the example you have always shared with us.\n\nMag and Cath\n\nBill Winters\n\nRe Nigel Lovely\n\nJust 4 boys in my year left St George's to go to 'Archies': Andrew Williamson, Tony Farrell, Nigel & me. Nigel & I would occasionally cycle some of the way home together although on that fatal night I'd stayed behind to play football. He was a really nice guy & from a very nice family. I remember being in church once & not having any change for the collection & his mother slipped me a few coins. (18/03/2014).\n\nPaulette Arnold (Bedingham)\n\nI was at the Juniors from 1964-70. I'm a twin to Pauline. At one time time there were 3 sets of twins & a set of triplets. I remember a photo in the press. The year I left Mrs Benneworth retired. After rehearsing, we sang all the songs from the Sound Of Music. Playing instruments such triangle, glockenspiel & tambourine. Mr Atkin taught us in the last year. He was taken ill & was off for some time. Everyone in the class clubbed together & we bought him a watch as we wouldn't see him again A few of us went to his house to give him the present & enjoyed an afternoon with him. (27/06/2014).\n\nSharon Lewies (Burns)\n\nI have such very happy memories of my time at St George's. The Sisters really were very warm not only to me but our whole family. We arrived in York from Belfast in the early 70s. We had escaped 'the troubles'. Whatever we needed, be it shoes, a warm jumper or just a hug was provided by the Sisters in a quiet way that was truly wonderful.\n\nI went to St Margaret Clitherow in Sep 1976. I really think without the love, care and support my whole family received from the Sisters, Priests and teaching staff at St George's I would not have had the confidence and belief in myself that I do today.\n\n(24/03/2015)"
