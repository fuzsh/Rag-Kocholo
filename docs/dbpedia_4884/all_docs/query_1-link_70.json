        "text": "My Story  Colin John Price.\n\nI was born in Penrith, NSW, on the 12th of May in 1946. My father was still serving as a pilot with the RAF and was stationed at nearby Camden. He was a Spitfire pilot in the Battle of Britain and had come to Australia with the two RAF Spitfire squadrons that had been sent to Darwin following the Japanese overrunning of Singapore.\n\nMy father met and married my mother (right), who was from the west coast of Tasmania, while he was stationed in Australia.\n\nFollowing the end of the war my father went back to England to discharge and got a job flying passenger and cargo aircraft out of Copenhagen in Denmark. My mother and I followed shortly by sea to England and then to Copenhagen where we lived for four years before the cold got too much for my mother and we all headed back to Australia. We initially moved to Melbourne where my mothers family was. I was then about five years old and I went to a boarding school there for a short period while my parents sorted everything out.\n\nShortly afterwards, we moved to the northern beaches of Sydney when my father was flying with Qantas (Constellations and B707 mainly). I was about seven years old at this time and spent all my school years living around Whale Beach and Avalon Beach. I was an only child up until about ten years of age when the first of my two sisters were born followed by the second and last sibling about two years later. Life for me on the northern beaches in those days was full of adventure, lots of swimming and surfing. It was more of a bushy city weekender area then as opposed to the more crowded Gucci lot that are there now. Mostly happy days in my childhood though not a stunning student at school but loved the beach and was addicted to surfing, which I still do with a passion.\n\nMy parents tried their best to shape me by having me take lessons in tennis, swimming, extra maths and English tuition etc. but although some of it stuck, it was mostly wasted on my independent, adventurous spirit. So once I got the dreaded Leaving Certificate behind me I was sick of studying and school so decided to take up a seagoing cadetship in the Merchant Marine. This was a huge adventure for a wide-eyed 17 year old and I learnt an awful lot about ships, the sea, navigating, different cultures (we sailed mostly to Japan and sometimes to Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines). I also learnt a lot about myself and other human beings.\n\nAfter about two years (1963-64) of chugging around the oceans and visiting an array of exotic ports in south-east Asia I could not envisage myself doing this for the rest of my life. What about my social life, what about meeting someone and getting married etc.?\n\nSo, after two years at sea which left an amazing imprint on my experience base I cut short my cadetship and went back home for a while to sort out what direction I would next take with my lifes journey. After some months of surfing and doing odd-jobs for some money (gardening, builders labourer etc.), I decided to join the RAAF where I would get good technical training, regular wages and opportunities to progress.\n\nSo at 19 years of age and on the tenth day of August 1965 I went down to the Sydney Recruiting Centre (in York street just down from Wynyard bus station in those days), took the oath and was at the very beginning of what turned out to be an amazing 36 year career taking me through to the 11th day of November 2001 when I retired as the RAAFs most senior Wing Commander navigator/air electronics officer.\n\nI have been thinking of my career in the RAAF leading up to writing this article and I think it would be much easier to give a lot of detail if I had not served for such a long period. There is just so much that happened over this period that a lot of what I have to say will be more of a general nature than specific incidents; however, dont despair there will be some humorous incidents sprinkled about. It is a bit like a single sunflower and its detail compared to a large field of sunflowers with each of those thousands of sunflowers having its own shape, colouring and character. So it is for me with a very long period of service compared to a single or shorter enlistment period.\n\nBesides that I am now 63 years of age and have probably forgotten as much as I can remember!\n\nRemember my reference earlier to the sunflowers well this is where I think it will be about the right spot in This is My Life to move from discussing the individual sunflowers to discussing and admiring the field of sunflowers. What the hell is he talking about?? I hear some say. Well there are many great years left to cover in my RAAF career but there are also many staff postings (desk jobs) and few flying postings so the pace will pick up and the level of detail will decrease (thank goodness I hear).\n\nAt work station on the HS-748 aircraft, SAN, East Sale and below survived to tell the tale.\n\nWe spent five years in East Sale. It was a good period in that I did not have extended periods away while we raised our young family for those important first few years. Enjoyed instructing and learning a lot more about advanced radars and electronic warfare. By this stage I was a seasoned Flight Lieutenant and was starting to seriously consider whether I would stay on in the RAAF for a long career or go back into civilian life for the stability and overall better situation for my young family. I enjoyed the challenge of learning what was effectively a new job every few years in the RAAF when I got posted and I enjoyed the camaraderie, the pay in those days for aircrew was quite good and I found it hard to reconcile jumping out into an uncertain employment market with very narrow and mostly military skills, training and qualifications. This uncertainty would occur every five years or so but as time went on I reconciled myself to focusing on my family as much as possible outside of work and try to give them a happy and secure home life.\n\nSo, after East Sale we went to Canberra for the first time when somebody must have pulled my name out of a hat to take up the position of Aide-de-Camp to the then Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) Air Marshal Sir James Rowland (1978-1980). This job was more a broadening of my experience base than anything and involved a wide range of secretarial, briefing and program scheduling duties. I remember having to organise a visit by the then Chief of the Indonesian Air Force, Air Marshal Shashadi Tadjadi and in amongst the myriad of dinners and presentations one evening we had a nice meal in the revolving restaurant at the top of the Australia Square building in Sydney.\n\nWell at the end it came to the business of paying for the meal and yours truly was expected to take care of that (using CASs credit card  he would just sign). Anyway some senior officer in the Indonesian party had this briefcase actually padlocked to his wrist all night and eventually opened it while we were arranging payment of the bill.\n\nThe briefcase was literally jammed with bundles of US $100 notes and they wanted to contribute to payment of the meal. Being hosts we discretely talked them out of that but it was an eye opener to see how a different culture approached the payment of a dinner bill and, more interestingly, would have one of their senior officers track around with so much cash padlocked to his wrist!\n\nAll done up as ADC to CAS (lots of rope, no horse)\n\nWhile I always felt we were quite competent and professional compared to maritime crews of other nations, it was not until I finished my flying days and had the advantage of hindsight and experience that I realised that we worked hard and played hard to earn the respect of those other nations in the maritime game. We were pretty damn good!\n\nAfter another two and a half years as Senior AEO at No. 11 Squadron, yep you guessed it, another posting. This time we were off to Headquarters Operational Command (HQOC) at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains where I took up the staff position titled MOPS 2 (Maritime Operations) (Jul83-Jan86).\n\n11 Sqn Exec Officers\n\nI am trying to get onto a hill to have a look at the sunflower field rather than the individual flowers! - it was a long career with many postings and a lot of detail, so from now shorter is better. This was mainly the end of my flying days as staff jobs, though many were interesting and challenging, did not include much flying at all. The MOPS job was mostly to do with individual tasking of aircraft, the scheduling of exercise programs and the coordinating of intelligence. It was quite demanding at times with some on the spot decision-making required but overall I found it a satisfying job.\n\nNext move was back to Canberra where I did a short stint out at RAAF Fairbairn as an External Studies staff member of the RAAF Staff College. This basically involved giving guidance and correcting staff papers written by officers out in the field as part of their promotion requirements, not that interesting really and as I was to find out I was only marking time before being promoted to Wing Commander (01Jul86) and moving into Russell Offices in Canberra to be Operations Requirements - Maritime (OR-MAR  another quaint acronym) (Jul86-Jul89).\n\nThis was a demanding but interesting job involving the assessment and justification for proposed aircraft modified, modernised and replacement aircraft systems for the maritime aircraft squadrons. This included the increasing need for more sophisticated trainers and simulators for 92 Wing (Oh yes, organisational change was forever upon us and the two maritime squadrons came under the umbrella of 92 Wing which in turn came under HQMPG (Headquarters Maritime Patrol Group)  lots more bureaucracy was upon us.\n\nThe main project I managed to complete was the detailed specifications for the next generation maritime patrol aircraft and this turned out to be the AP-3C which was a total refit of the existing airframes with vastly improved sensor systems, radars, radio systems, on-board computer systems, station displays, cockpit displays and weapons (improved Harpoon air-to-surface missiles and torpedoes).\n\nAfter a couple of years in the OR-MAR position I was kept in Canberra which suited my wife and gave some extra stability for the children, their friends and their schooling. My next job was still in Russell Offices but this time it was within the dark and mysterious world of intelligence. The job was titled Military Estimates Staff  Air Force MES-AF for the period Jul 89-Nov 90. I was above ground (I was to experience below ground later) in a building surrounded by a barbed wire and electrified fence (to keep us in I later thought!). Here I worked with civilian intelligence types and a wide range of uniformed personnel from all three services providing forecasts and trends based on intelligence provided to us. It was more interesting than it sounds.\n\nTime came for me to emerge from this strange world and I was offered the opportunity to be posted to an overseas exchange position with the US Navy (Nov 90-Sep 93) at Naval Air Station Moffett Field (right) in California (US Navy fly the P3-C Orion aircraft). This proved to be a difficult decision as we were by this stage happily dug-in with our own home in Canberra, the children were happy and doing well at their schools. By this stage I am a very senior Wing Commander and there did not appear to be a promotion in the air to Group Captain. So after a lot of discussion with the family we packed up and moved over to California for three great years. We decided it would be best for the children to spend their last couple of school years at boarding schools in Australia (this was the hardest decision of all, but their education was always very important to us). Education at this stage in California would have been totally foreign to our children and could have been disastrous. As it turned out they both did very well and were able to visit us during all their school holidays which worked out well for us all.\n\nThe exchange position was fascinating. I was on the staff of a US Navy Admiral who was titled Commander Patrol Wings Pacific (COMPATWINGSPAC) and his area of responsibility included deployments and bases in Japan, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam and the Middle East. My position was the Training and Readiness Officer and after three persistent years was able to produce the Training and Readiness Manual for the Pacific Fleet Patrol Squadrons. We lived in a nice area close to Stanford University and were only about an hours drive south of San Francisco city. We had a huge hand-me-down Ford LTD station wagon with something like a 6 litre engine  very unacceptable today, and a tiny little Honda Civic. The US Navy were workaholics but we managed to get some leave and head up into the snowfields at Lake Tahoe and down to San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico when the kids were on school holidays. Great experiences for us all.\n\nAt the end of this tour, the Cold War was just over and many US military bases were being eyed off by Washington for budgetary cuts and shut downs. Moffett Field was one of the bases to be shut down so COMPATWINGSPAC and his six squadrons of P-3C aircraft (along with the Price family!) all picked up sticks and moved to another US Navy base in Hawaii called Barbers Point (right). My tour of duty was extended by about six months to assist with the move across to Hawaii and the settling into the new area for the next RAAF exchange officer. Not much time for surfing though unfortunately as this was a busy time getting ready for moving back home and preparing for the next RAAF replacement for the exchange position. Great for the family though as we managed to score a nice rental apartment in downtown Honolulu from where they explored the delights of that part of Honolulu along with daily visits to the beach. I meanwhile was on the road daily for the one hour trip to and from Barbers Point and lots of work.\n\nWe had expected to move back to Canberra from Hawaii but this was not to be and it was back to Edinburgh in SA instead. I was posted to the staff of the Commander Maritime Patrol Group as Staff Officer Policy and Planning (Sep 93-Jan 96). Here I developed plans for the introduction of new aircraft systems and their associated training programs. An amount of bureaucratic policy documentation had become necessary and I wrote quite a few of these documents basically putting down in writing what we did and were supposed to do. A bit of a lonely job and not all that interesting but it did have to be done  cant be all beer and skittles!\n\nFrom Edinburgh we finally got back to Canberra and to the home that had been rented for the years we were in the US and SA. I went to senior officers school being the Joint Services Staff College for a full-on six months (Jan-Jul96) of academia and a bit of travelling. The course, with wives, hopped onto a luxurious (not) Herc for a trip to various bases around Australia with a second Herc trip (just in case our crushed knees had heeled) to Christmas Island and several spots in Indonesia. Never having been on service trips away with wives before it was a lot of fun and unfortunately I think my wife still needs to be convinced that whenever I went away flying all I did was have a good time wining and dining  too late now, its easier to acquiesce on this one!\n\nArmed with all my newfound joint service knowledge I was posted back into Russell Offices to a position (Staff Officer 1  Joint Plans Air !!) (Jul96-Jul98) located below ground (in the bunker) where I worked in the newly formed Joint Strategic Command with a mix of Army, Navy, Air Force and civilian personnel. Mostly these jobs were about assessing intelligence and operational information at a national level, assessing military implications and responses to events in our region and developing any proposed plans of action. There was a lot of politicking here between the services and some government departments which I had not experienced before. This was certainly not my style but at the same time there were many opportunities to firmly express the RAAFs position in many of these circumstances and I enjoyed that aspect.\n\nSo my long and illustrious career was fast coming to an inevitable end. I had been a Wing Commander for a very long time and, as such, became somewhat of a specialist with a wide depth of experience. Perhaps due to my depth of experience I think I had adopted an amount of obstinacy when I knew I was correct on various matters. Often this did not endear me to my superiors and perhaps contributed to my extended time in the Wing Commander rank.\n\nAnyway I could always sleep straight at night!"
