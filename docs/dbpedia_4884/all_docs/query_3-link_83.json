        "text": "Weâ€™ve almost made it to the end of April, so thatâ€™s something. Thanks to Daniel Benneworth-Gray for the mention earlier this month. It surely means Iâ€™m about to disappoint a large number of people â€” if I have not, in fact, already done so â€” but I hope you find something you like hereâ€¦\n\nThe Candy House by Jennifer Egan; design by Jamie Keenan (Scribner / April 2022)\n\nElizabeth Finch by Julian Barnes; design by Suzanne Dean (Jonathan Cape / April 2022)\n\nI believe the Elizabeth Finch cover also comes in yellow, but I wasnâ€™t able to find a hi-res image. If anyone wants to send it over, Iâ€™ll be happy to add it.\n\nThe jacket also comes in yellow, which feels very on trend to me and the blue and yellow look lovely side by side. Thank you to Suzanne for taking the time to send over the image of the yellow version.\n\nSuzanne also sent over an image of the boards for those of you curious to see what is under the jacket, peeking through the die-cuts. The gorgeous photograph is from RenÃ© Groebliâ€™s photoessay The Eye of Love.\n\nThis is the problem with seeing covers/jackets primarily online. You rarely get to appreciate these finer details. This must be a beautiful book to hold and unwrap.\n\nBut going back to cut-out circles/semi-circles for a moment. They reminded of Olga Kominekâ€˜s cover design for The Penguin Book of Feminist Writing edited by Hannah Dawson published last year.\n\nAnd I have been trying to recall what both these covers remind me of. Possibly â€˜Composition of Circles and Semicirclesâ€˜ by abstract artist Sophie Taeuber-Arp?\n\nEnd of the World House by Adrienne Celt; design by David Litman (Simon & Schuster / April 2022)\n\nA House Between Earth and the Moon by Rebecca Scherm; design by Colin Webber; image by Maciej Toporowicz (Viking / April 2022)\n\nLike Animals by Eve Lemieux; design by Michel Vrana; illustration Saul Herrera (Rare Machines / April 2022)\n\nInspired by Basquiat presumably?\n\nMy Face in the Light by Martha Schabas; design by Kate Sinclair (Knopf Canada / April 2022)\n\nPandoraâ€™s Jar by Natalie Haynes; design Milan Bozic; illustration by Laura Anastasio (Harper Perennial / March 2022)\n\n(Special thanks to Caro for identifying the designer and illustrator)\n\nPoguemahone by Patrick McCabe; design by Mark Ecob (Unbound / April 2022)\n\nPost-Traumatic by Chantal V. Johnson; design by Lucy Kim (Little Brown and Co. / April 2022)\n\nFeeling the international typographic style influence this monthâ€¦\n\nThe Red Zone by Chloe Caldwell; design Michael Salu (Soft Skull Press / April 2022)\n\nTheir Four Hearts by Vladimir Sorokin; design by Alban Fischer (Dalkey Archive Press / April 2022)\n\nThe Void Ascendant by Premee Mohamed; design by James Paul Jones (Solaris / April 2022)\n\nThis is the third book in the â€˜Beneath the Risingâ€™ trilogy.\n\nYoung Mungo by Douglas Stuart; design by Christopher Moisan; photograph by Kyle Thompson (Grove Press / April 2022)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition published by Picador features a photograph by Wolfgang Tillmans. The design is by Stuart Wilson.\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nGood grief! Weâ€™re halfway through August! I suppose Iâ€™d better post some book coversâ€¦\n\nAgrippina: Empress, Exile, Hustler, Whore by Emma Southon; design by Mark Ecob (Unbound / August 2018)\n\nAll these Beautiful Strangers by Elizabeth Klehfoth; design by Alicia Tatone (William Morrow / July 2018)\n\nCertain American States by Catherine Lacey; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / August 2018)\n\nCherry by Nico Walker; design by Janet Hansen (Knopf / August 2018)\n\nOne for the skulls on book covers list. (I havenâ€™t updated this list in a while, but there are a few more here.)\n\nFight Like a Girl by Clementine Ford; design by Steve Leard (Oneworld / August 2018)\n\nFour by Andy Jones; design by Patrik Svensson (Hodder & Stoughton / July 2018)\n\nHeretics Anonymous by Katie Henry; design by David Curtis (Katherine Tegen Books / August 2018)\n\nImmigrant, Montana by Amitava Kumar; design Janet Hansen (Knopf / July 2018)\n\nJane Doe by Victoria Helen Stone; design by Derek Thornton/Faceout Studio (Lake Union / August 2018)\n\nIâ€™ve said it before and I will say it again, Amazonâ€™s Lake Union imprint is doing a scarily good job with their genre covers.\n\nA Ladder to the Sky by John Boyne; design by Jo Thomson (Doubleday / August 2018)\n\nThe Line That Held Us by David Joy; design by Michael Morris (G.P. Putnamâ€™s Sons / August 2018)\n\nThis Mournable Body by Tsitsi Dangarembga; design Kimberly Glyder (Graywolf / August 2018)\n\nNotes from the Fog by Ben Marcus; design Peter Mendelsund (Knopf / August 2018)\n\nPretend Iâ€™m Dead by Jen Beagin; design by Alex Merto (Scribner / May 2018)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition was designed by Hayley Warnham. And apparently rubber glove covers are a thing now, you freakinâ€™ weirdosâ€¦\n\nThe cover of The Trauma Cleaner was designed by W.H. Chong.\n\nThe Reservoir Tapes by Jon McGregor; design by Strick&Williams (Catapult / August 2018)\n\nThis goes very nicely with the cover of the US edition of Reservoir 13 also designed by Strick&Williams:\n\nRust and Stardust by T. Greenwood; design by Olga Grlic (St. Martinâ€™s Press / August 2018)\n\nA Short Film About Disappointment by Joshua Mattson; design by Ben Denzer (Penguin Press / August 2018)\n\nThe Stars Now Unclaimed by Drew Williams; design by Jack Smyth (Simon & Schuster / August 2018)\n\nA Superior Spectre by Angela Meyer; design by Design by Committee (Ventura / August 2018)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nA little later than usual â€” between one thing and the apocalypse â€” but there are some great covers out this month, including at least one contender for cover of the year:\n\nThe Bear and the Serpent by Adrian Tschaikovsky; design by Neil Lang (Pan Macmillan / February 2017)\n\nThe cover for the previous book in the series, The Tiger and the Wolf, was also designed by Neil:\n\nBirds Art Life Death by Kyo Maclear; design by Jonny Pelham; illustration by Kyo Maclear (Fourth Estate / February 2017)\n\nThe cover of the US edition published by Scribner, which also features illustrations by Kyo Maclear, was designed by Lauren Peters-Collaer:\n\nThe Blot by Jonathan Lethem; design by Gray318 (Jonathan Cape / February 2017)\n\nThe Brand New Catastrophe by Mike Scalise; design by Oliver Munday (Sarabande Books / January 2017)\n\nCivil Wars by David Armitage; design by Peter Mendelsund (Yale University Press / February 2017)\n\nDarke by Rick Gekoski; design by Pete Adlington (Canongate Press / February 2017)\n\nEmergency Admissions by Kit Wharton; design by Jonny Pelham (Fourth Estate / February 2017)\n\nIs That Kafka? by Reiner Stach; design by Erik Carter (New Directions / February 2017)\n\nErikâ€™s design for the hardcover was included in my June post last year:\n\nIt Canâ€™t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis; design Jim Stoddart (Penguin / January 2017)\n\nThe Lucky Ones by Julianne Pachico; design by Luke Bird (Faber & Faber / February 2017)\n\nManly Health and Training by Walt Whitman; design by Richard Ljoenes (Regan Arts / February 2017)\n\nThe Memory Book by Lara Avery; design by Sinem Erkas (Quercus / January 2017)\n\nNever Enough by Barney Hoskyns; design by Jamie Keenan (Constable / January 2017)\n\nNicotine by Nell Zink; design by Julian Humphries (Fourth Estate / October 2016)\n\nHad I seen this cover last year when the book was published, it would undoubtedly made my end of the year list.\n\nAnd on the topic of covers of the year, hereâ€™s that early contender for 2017:\n\nA Separation by Katie Kitamura; design by Jaya Miceli (Riverhead / February 2017)\n\nAnd from the sublime to the hilariousâ€¦\n\nSpurt by Chris Miles; design by Lucy Ruth Cummins (Simon & Schuster / February 2017)\n\nA Simple Story by Leila Guerriero; design by Oliver Munday (New Directions / February 2017)\n\nThis is the Ritual by Rob Doyle; design by Greg Heinimann (Bloomsbury / January 2017)\n\nGregâ€™s design for the hardcover of This Is The Ritual, also published by Bloomsbury, was included in my January post last year:\n\nWho Lost Russia by Peter Conradi; design by Mark Ecob (Oneworld / February 2017)\n\nSave\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI swear that these posts are taking me longer and longer to compile, but rest assured there are some wonderful covers this month:\n\nAll the Time in the World by Caroline Angell; design by Lucy Kim (Henry Holt / July 2016)\n\nAmerican Girls by Alison Umminger; design by Philip Pascuzzo (Flat Iron / June 2016)\n\nBeast by Paul Kingsnorth; design Mark Ecob; illustration Alan Rogerson (Faber & Faber / July 2016)\n\nBoy Erased by Garrard Conley; design Rachel Willey (Riverhead / May 2016)\n\nA Copâ€™s Eyes by Gaku Yakumaru; design by Peter Mendelsund (Vertical / May 2016)\n\nContested by Michaela Desoucey; design Jason Alejandro (Princeton University Press / July 2016)\n\nCorbyn by Richard Seymour; design by Dan Mogford (Verso / July 2016)\n\nCreativity Class by Lily Chumley; design by Amanda Weiss (Princeton University Press / July 2016)\n\nDialogue by Robert McKee; design by Catherine Casalino (Twelve Books / July 2016)\n\nFates and Furies by Lauren Groff; design by Melissa Four (Windmill Books / July 2016)\n\nItâ€™s interesting to compare/contrast this new cover for the UK paperback with the covers of the UK hardcover, designed by Suzanne Dean, and the US hardcover, designed by Rodrigo Corral and Adalis Martinez:\n\nThe Food & Wine of France by Edward Behr; design by Samantha Russo; photograph Oddur Thorisson (Penguin / July 2016)\n\nGrace by Natashia DeÃ³n; design by Elena Giavaldi (Counterpoint / June 2016)\n\nThe Hatching by Ezekiel Boone; design by Chelsea McGuckin; art by David Wu (Atria Books / July 2016)\n\nHot Little Hands by Abigail Ulman; art direction by Greg Mollica; design by Ben Wiseman; photograph by RJ Shaughnessy (Spiegel & Grau / May 2016)\n\nItâ€™s also interesting to see US hardcover next to the purely typographic cover from Australia designed by Laura Thomas, and the racier, retro Penguin UK cover designed by Richard Bravery:\n\nHow to Set a Fire and Why by Jesse Ball; design by Kelly Blair (Pantheon / July 2016)\n\nThis struck me as something as quite a bold change of direction for the covers of Jesse Ballâ€™s novels, which have often been quite minimal and typographic. It feel quite different to the recent paperback edition of A Cure for Suicide by Jesse Ball, designed by Helen Yentus and Jason Booher (Vintage / June 2016), for example:\n\nIn the Flow by Boris Groys; design by Everything Studio (Verso / March 2016)\n\nInvincible Summer by Alice Adams; design by Lauren Harms (Little, Brown & Co. / June 2016)\n\nThe UK cover of Invincible Summer, designed by Justine Anweiler, was included in last monthâ€™s post.\n\nListen to Me by Hannah Pittard; design by Catherine Casalino (HMH / July 2016)\n\nMultiple Choice by Alejandro Zambra; design by Nayon Cho (Penguin / July 2016)\n\nSmoke by Dan Vyleta; design by Mark Swan (Weidenfeld & Nicolson / July 2016)\n\nStorm and Steel by Ernst JÃ¼nger; design by Neil Gower (Penguin / May 2016)\n\nStreet Furniture Design by Eleanor Herring; design by Daniel Benneworth-Gray (Bloomsbury / July 2016)\n\nThe Sun in Your Eyes by Deborah Shapiro; design by Mumtaz Mustafa (HarperCollins / July 2016)\n\nThis Savage Song by Victoria Schwab; design Jenna Stempel (GreenWillow / July 2016)\n\nUndying by Michel Faber; design by Rafi Romaya; art by Yehrin Tong (Canongate / July 2016)\n\nThe paperback of Michel Faberâ€™s Some Rain Must Fall is out this month too. The cover is another Rafi Romaya / Yehrin Tong collaboration:\n\nVinegar Girl by Anne Tyler; design by Kris Potter (Hogarth / June 2016)\n\nAs I noted on Twitter earlier this week, this combination of type and overlapping floral image â€” lovely as it is â€” is becoming a bit of a thingâ€¦\n\nIf anyone has a good name (and/or pithy description) for this trend let me know. In the meantime, designer Dan Blackman pointed me to his beautiful poster designs for DelVal College from 2011, which are early examples of this ideaâ€¦\n\nWhat Language Do I Dream In by Elena Lappin; design by Gray318 (Virago / June 2016)\n\nWho Will Catch Us As We Fall by Iman Verjee; design by James Paul Jones (Oneworld / July 2016)\n\nWindows into the Soul by Gary T. Marx; design by Isaac Tobin (University of Chicago Press / July 2016)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
