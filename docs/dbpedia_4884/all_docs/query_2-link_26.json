These located on each side of the ground, if you open the camera on your phone and scan the QR code, it will show you a number of photos from that angle in previous years over our 160 year history.\n\nThere is also an interactive map below, where you can scan the QR codes and check out the photos, if you can’t get down to the ground in person."
