Here, they position key facets of our joint scholarly and real-world project of examining, and being part of, contemporary academia. The book is exemplary for doing multidisciplinary meta-research across the globe with professionalism and care. It provokes self-reflexivity because its authors are deeply engaged, rather than disinterested. The Handbook of Meta-Research is a book to cherish!’\r– Sarah de Rijcke, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden University, the Netherlands",
