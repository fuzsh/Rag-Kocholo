        "text": "Update from the Chair: President Mark Gearan\n\nOn January 8, the Talloires Network Steering Committee convened a very productive call to discuss the achievements of the Talloires Network over the past six months as well as goals and initiatives of the next year. I would like to take this opportunity to share some highlights of our latest biannual meeting.\n\nA main point of discussion was initial planning for the next Talloires Network global conference, which we recommend be held in late 2014 in the Global South. Over the next few months, a subcommittee of the Steering Committee will guide planning of this event.\n\nWe also discussed the importance of rectifying significant gaps in the Talloires Network membership including among universities in continental Europe, Russia, China and Brazil as well as high profile institutions in North America and the United Kingdom. One potential approach proposed is to promote the Talloires Network at different international conferences and events, including holding satellite Talloires Network meetings at events already taking place in order to facilitate dialogue among existing members as well as the recruitment of new members. We have formed a second subcommittee on Membership and Nominations, and asked the TN secretariat to emphasize broadening the Network’s geographic diversity.\n\nIn addition to the Network’s ongoing programs, priorities for the upcoming months include membership expansion, organizing an in-person meeting of the Steering Committee in New York in June/July 2013, and coordinating Steering Committee participation at international conferences.\n\nI would welcome comments and suggestions from TN members. Are there issues or opportunities you would like the Steering Committee to consider at its next meeting, or before?\n\nThank you for your continued engagement with the Talloires Network. We are pleased and encouraged with our progress to date and excited to advance our collective effort in the months ahead.\n\nFeatured Profile\n\nLeaders in the Civic Engagement Movement: Budd Hall\n\nby Lorlene Hoyt\n\nFebruary signals the eighth installment of our Leaders in the Civic Engagement Movement series.
