        "text": "Since The Real Meal Revolution was published in 2013, we have helped hundreds of thousands of people lose weight and reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut obesity and diabetes affect many of the world’s population, an Australian is diagnosed every five minutes with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe need to reverse this disease is now a matter of urgency and if it can be done with changing what a person eats, instead of giving him/her medication, then that would be a revelation.\n\nWe already know that this is possible, by following a Banting lifestyle, but now the whole of Australia knows it too.\n\nRecently an Australian tv show tracked the progress of three people for three months, following three different dietary approaches, all trying to reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\nTony Benneworth is 65 years old, with a starting weight of 131kgs. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes eight years ago. He is following a Banting way of eating and is mentored by Pete Evans and Dr. Gary Fettke.\n\n“Tony will ditch his carb-heavy favourites for lots of vegetables, leafy greens and ditch the processed carbs he loves so much. This, incorporated with lean meat and those healthy fats will hopefully turn his prognosis around.”\n\nCassandra Floyd is 36 years old with a starting weight of 102kgs and has just been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes. She is following the standard Dietitian’s Association recommended diet, advised by dietician Alex Parker.\n\n“If you’re having rice we want to keep it to about half a cup of cooked rice, or if we’re having pasta it’s about the same… then there’s plenty of room on the plate to add vegetables and also get some of that lean protein.”\n\nJack Merolla is 50 years old with a starting weight of 91kgs and is pre-diabetic. He is following Dr. Michael Mosely’s 800-calorie “8-week blood sugar diet.”\n\n“That basically means a diet which is fruit and veg, but also lots of oily fish, a glass of red wine lots of oily nuts and plenty of olive oil and occasional bits of dark chocolate.”\n\nThe results are in:\n\nAccording to Dr. Gary and Belinda Fettke:\n\n“Tony now describes himself as ‘a former type2 diabetic.’\n\nTony has dropped 22kgs in 10 weeks and reversed his type 2 diabetes\n\nTony’s blood glucose levels are consistently in the 4’s now\n\nTony has come off four medications (under GP supervision)\n\nTony has lost his knee arthritis pain\n\nTony wakes up earlier every morning and bounces out of bed with more energy\n\nTony is ‘buzzing’ with his new life\n\nTony’s HbA1c has come back to normal\n\nTony’s blood lipid profile has converted from a high cardiac risk to ‘normal’ despite healthy fats in his diet.”\n\nTony says, “It wasn’t hard – that’s what the amazing thing is. I feel like I’ve just woken up, and now I’m 22kgs lighter.”\n\n“I’m actually looking forward to the next 20 years if I could get that far I reckon I’m going to be a lot healthier.”\n\nCassandra still has type 2 diabetes although she has lowered her blood sugar levels, has lost 10kgs and feels great.\n\n“[I feel] great, really great. A lot of energy… I feel like a million dollars.”\n\nJack lost 18kgs, and his blood sugar levels are in the healthy range. He is full of energy.\n\nAlthough he said, “The first three weeks were not easy. I struggled with big cravings. Now I eat three meals a day and am satisfied.”\n\nThis tv program proves once again that you are what you eat. By following a Banting lifestyle, you can effortlessly reverse type 2 diabetes, while eating delicious healthy-fat foods, with little interruption to your daily routine, and be able to maintain this way of eating for the rest of your life. Although, we advise you to consult your healthcare practitioner before embarking on any dietary change."
