        "text": "THE ANNUAL general meeting of the Tetcott Hunt brought about two major changes in its top management.\n\nTony Benneworth has taken on the role of chairman following Julian Smeeth's decision to step down after six years and secretary Kevin Wheeler, who did not seek re-election, has been replaced by Diana Stevens of Holsworthy.\n\nAt the packed meeting in Whitstone Village Hall Mr Benneworth said: \"Hunting is a business and the Tetcott has had more than its fair share of problems in one way and another.\n\n\"I will draw a line under that and call it history but something we will all learn from.\n\n\"Being a new face I have no preconceptions and I intend to promote harmony and stability for the benefit of all â€“ landowners, farmers, riders and foot followers.\n\n\"Neither I or the committee have a magic wand and therefore it requires the support of everybody to help put us on a firm footing.\"\n\nThe Tetcott hunts within the law and holds around 50 meets a year around its country, stretching from Clovelly to Wainhouse Corner and from Bude to Holsworthy.\n\nThis means a huge administrative workload much of which will fall on the shoulders of married mother of two Diana Stevens.\n\nMrs Stevens is well known in local equestrian circles and as well as her love of hunting she enjoys competing with her ex-racehorse in various disciplines including dressage, showjumping and team-chasing, last year competing at The Royal Windsor Horse Show and Hickstead\n\n\"Organising, administering and trouble-shooting has always been part of my career, and I've never been afraid of getting my hands dirty,\" said Mrs Stevens now a Finance Director of her husband's IT company.\n\n\"You can take the girl out of the farm but you can never take the farm out of the girl and I am passionate about protecting rural values and traditions.\n\n\"I hope that Tetcott will be able to not only maintain but increase its support and services to farmers and landowners alike, working in harmony with its neighbouring hunts and supporting the activities of local pony clubs.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am very proud to be the chairman and I want us to move forward at a pace we desire. My aims are to encourage support to ensure we all have fun and make the Tetcott Hunt every huntsman's dream.\""
