        "text": "Lincoln Astronomical Society has its beginnings in the mid 1950's.\n\nA group of about 6 people met at Peter Hammerton's house discussing science fiction, astronomy, space travel UFO's etc. Peter was already giving talks about our exploration of the Moon before Sputnik 1 was launched.\n\nThe society was initially called the Lincoln Interplanetary Society. After one meeting at Peter's house, the society moved to the larger property of Dr Paul Bourne. Lectures were given by Peter on the Exploration of the Moon, and Paul - on the Geology of the Moon.\n\nIn early 1959 he bought a 6 inch reflector and decided it was time to see if there were enough people in the subject to form a society. An article in the Lincolnshire Echo newspaper in May of that year produced 9 members at the inaugural meeting - only about three new faces however, possibly due to the wording of the piece in the Echo which asked for anyone who had seen little green men on Jupiter (not even Mars) to contact Peter.\n\nThe first so called H.Q. was a chicken hut at North Greetwell, two miles from the Bowling Green Pub roundabout on the Wragby road outside Lincoln. Our first job was to scrape the floor clean. After three weeks hard work, the owners of the hut had achieved their objective and flung the society out and we paid 3 weeks rent.\n\nThis took the society back to the Hammerton's front room. In September 1959 the group (now 27 strong) moved to the top room of the Lincoln YMCA for a monthly meeting and continued to expand.\n\nMeetings had now increased to two a month at the YMCA and by the AGM in September 1960 the society's named was changed to the Lincoln Astronomical Society as we knew of people who didn't want to know about space travel, they regarded it as fantasy. However, though we changed the society's title, we didn't change our aims, 'to promote interest in all things to do with space'. By now membership had increased to 40.\n\nA Jumble sale was held for fund raising and the picture above shows the committee, dressed up with jumble from the forth coming sale.\n\nFrom left to right: Dr Paul Bourne, Mick Kirk, Charlie Gibbons, Ray Bennett & Peter Hammerton.\n\nA permanent home was needed and the society looked for a place where meetings could be held and an observatory could be constructed.\n\nIn late 1959 we had a large article in the Lincoln evening paper and appealed for an observation post. The article caught the eye of Mrs Benneworth who lived on Westcliffe Street and owned a garden plot off the hillside.\n\nKen Stevens FRAS demonstrated the use of an oscilloscope\n\nafter his talk on radio astronomy in April 1967\n\nBy 1968 membership had dropped to 40. The society president, David Hardy, painted a solar eclipse on the lecture hall entrance walls. At the AGM Walter Pennell showed some of the star photo's he had taken to the BAA exhibition that year. Treasurer, Arthur Richardson, announced the society was in the black for the first time in many years with funds of £23.\n\nFrom left: David Swaby, Arthur Thaiss, Peter Harris, Dick Thompson,\n\nPeter Hammerton & Dorothy Miller\n\nPeter Hammerton continued to give regular talks to the society. Here he gives some members a preview of his slides before the talk on 'A search for life on other worlds' in November 1968. Other talks that year included 'The History of flying saucers' and 'Progress on project Apollo'\n\nIn May 1969 a sponsored walk was held to raise funds. In June the society held a 10th anniversary meeting. David Hardy gave a talk and a special edition of the society magazine 'Eyepiece' was produced. A NASA representative gave a talk saying that NASA expected to have a 12 man space station by 1980. The society purchased an 8.5 inch reflector.\n\nAnother sponsored walk raised £150. We had a large exhibition in a charity shop opposite St Mary's Street in Lincoln (now underneath Wigford Way). This brought in hundreds of people but only 8 new members.\n\nMembership increased to 75 in 1971 and a sponsored walk raised £93 toward the observatory fund. Planning permission was granted in 1972 for the observatory. The society also visited Greenwich Observatory this year.\n\nIn 1974 another sponsored walk was held and Richard Pennell raised the most money. The society started having cheese and wine parties where Dick Thompson and Peter Blunden provided the home made wine (strong).\n\nWith artist David Hardy involved in the society, it was inevitable that the society would have its mark left on the Moon.\n\nIn the 1960's and 70's, the society held a regular annual quiz against other societies. Here we see one against Cleethorpes from around 1975. From the left: Lincoln A.S. Walter Pennell, Peter Blunden, Jack Stimson, Andrew Norris- Scorer Phil Norton :In the chair Peter Hammerton, :Cleethorpes A.S. -Scorer Tony Smith, P.Ellis, Ray Emery, Peter Rea, Barrie Watts.\n\nPeter Hammerton moved away from the society for a time, to run a Post Office and newsagents in Chesterfield in1976. He then bought an astronomy bookshop in Sheffield (Sheffield Space Centre) in 1978, before returning to the Minimarket in Lincoln with his science fiction bookshop.\n\nSadly Walter Pennell died in March before the completion of the observatory but he is remembered in its name - 'The Pennell-Hammerton Observatory'.\n\nDuring the late 1970's, the Eyepiece magazine was not published. Instead the society issued a series of monthly news letters edited by Bob Christy. The annual quiz verses Cleethorpes continued and a car treasure hunt was held in July 1978. In September of that year, Andrew Norris moved to Crawley. He was a long time member -observing director, builder, film maker etc. The society made a film in 1978 called 'Domed to Failure'. It was a comical look at the observatory dome falling apart (only partially constructed at the time).The film was well received at the Horncastle meeting that year and it was shown at the B.A.A meeting in London.\n\nThe society had several break-ins. One in September 1978 saw the clock, first aid kit, finderscope and eyepieces stolen. This meant new shutters on the windows and better locks had to be fitted.\n\nIn 1979, Richard Pennell and his mother offered to lend the society Walter Pennell's 12 inch reflector, on condition that the observatory was finished first. This put a new 'kick' in to finishing the building. Cheese and Wine parties were still held -one at Bob Christy's home and another at Tony Hopkinson's. A visit to Jodrell Bank with Cleethorpes A.S. took place that year. A sponsored walk in aid of the observatory raised £180 and was organised by Richard Pennell.\n\n1980 saw the only society disco organised by Martin Bell and held at the local government social club. The society also started a series of Barn Dances, held at Pennell's Nursery on Brant Road Lincoln.\n\nAfter a busy decade the society could relax and concentrate on astronomy. Members used the observatory for long exposure photographs and regular observing sessions were held every Tuesday night throughout the winter. The society started opening the observatory to the general public and during National Astronomy Week in 1985 nearly 1000 people took the opportunity to view Halley's Comet (400 in one night).\n\nThe 30th anniversary meeting was held on 23rd September 1989 at Bishop Greaves Hall, Bishop Grosseteste College in Lincoln\n\nDavid Hardy visiting the society in 1991 to give a lecture on 'Visions of the Galaxies'\n\nSadly the founder of the society, Peter Hammerton, died in September 1992. To remember him, the first Peter Hammerton Memorial lecture was held in September 1993 and the September meeting is always dedicated to him. During the 1990's the society started inviting various groups to the observatory via the visits organiser which still continues today.\n\nIn 1999 the society celebrated its 40th anniversary with a series of lectures at the observatory.\n\nThe society has to maintain the site and working parties are held on Saturdays. We have always had minor problems with land settling as the hillside is made of clay. After the very dry summer of 2003 what was a small crack near the front door opened up and it was decided for safety reasons that the structure should be strengthened in case of any further movement. The paneling either side of the entrance was removed and replaced by a brick structure.\n\nDave Garbutt, Colin Reeve and Dave Swaby & Dave Castledine\n\nIt wasn't until March 2006, forty years after we opened the Lecture Hall, that the society had a visit by Lincoln's Member of Parliament. Gillian Merron was asked to help with the ever increasing light pollution problems at the society. She made a private visit lasting about an hour.\n\nFrom left: Dave Garbutt, Arthur Richardson,\n\nGillian Merron (MP) & Philip Norton\n\nDuring the summer of 2006 a major project was undertaken to refurbish the dome. Opened 25 years before by Patrick Moore, the skin had deteriorated badly and rain water was making the internal floor of the observatory dangerous. The project was to take 18 months. In order that we could continue observing the sky, the society's old telescope was recommisioned and reinstalled on its pillar."
