        "text": "DEMOTED: Labor Senator Lisa Singh has been placed sixth on the party's ticket. Former Liberal MP Tony Benneworth says the process is wrong.\n\nFormer Bass Liberal MHA Tony Benneworth has lashed out at the Liberal and Labor Senate preselection process, labelling it a “sad reflection”.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nLabor Senator Lisa Singh has not been saved by the party’s national executive, with the committee on Thursday placing her sixth on the ticket.\n\nThe demotion follows Liberal Senator Richard Colbeck, who is the only Tasmanian federal minister, being placed in the unsafe fifth spot.\n\nMr Benneworth had a message for Tasmanians – vote below the line.\n\n“At this election you have a real chance to make your vote count,” he said.\n\n“I just really hope everyone thinks about it more than they have in the past and exercise their democratic right.”\n\nMr Benneworth said Senate preselection “always had a whiff about it”.\n\n“There’s a lot of us out there that want to make our vote count rather than what the party wants,” he said.\n\n“The fact that Eric Abetz got number one on the Liberal Party ticket, to me, is a bit sad.\n\n“He’s yesterday’s man, and the fact that a sitting minister got number five is really strange.”\n\nMr Benneworth said Senator Abetz’s “day is gone” and the party should look to the future.\n\nThe same goes for Labor relegating Senator Singh, he said.\n\n“I think it’s a sad reflection on what the parties are thinking.”\n\nNorth West Senator Anne Urquhart got the number one spot for Labor.\n\nSenator Helen Polley and Carol Brown are also in safe spots, taking out second and third.\n\nSenator Catryna Bilyk has the fourth spot, and unionist John Short has the less-safe fifth spot.\n\n“But I'm very determined to give Tasmanians a real choice about the sort of progressive Labor voice they want in the Senate.”\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
