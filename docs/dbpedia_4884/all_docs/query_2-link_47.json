        "text": "Now, about this Bridge Ive got for Sale\n\nI had an interesting travel experience the other day. Shortly after we took off on an early flight from Gladstone to Brisbane, the guy sitting next to me tapped his newspaper and said, \"Can you believe this garbage?\"\n\nI replied that until I'd had my morning coffee I'd pretty much believe anything.\n\nI leaned over and had a look. The article that had him so aroused was about global warming. \"Bloody scientists,\" he said, \"Theyre all bullshitters.\"\n\n\"What, I asked, \"all of them?\"\n\n\"All this mob pushing this global warming stuff. They're all bullshit artists.\"\n\nNow I'm a writer (look, that's my story and I'm sticking to it) so I'm always interested in other people's thought processes. What's more, I've heard this line of reasoning before and always found it confusing.\n\n\"Do you ever wonder,\" I asked him, \"Why it's the scientists that can't be trusted and not, oh, I don't know, engineers, for example?\"\n\n\"Can't trust any of them,\" he replied, his voice projecting complete certainty.\n\n\"You know,\" I said, picking my words carefully, \"that's kind of an odd assertion to make, given that we're sitting in an aluminum tube cruising at about ten thousand metres and doing several hundred miles an hour.\"\n\nHe looked at me like I was stupid. \"What's that got to do with anything?\" he said. \"It's pilots flying the plane.\"\n\nI've thought a bit about that conversation since then. I wonder if he knows where milk comes from. It got me thinking about some of the other weird stuff that we humans can convince ourselves to believe. Turns out, theres no end to it.\n\nIve since discovered that there really is a Flat Earth Society, (you can visit their forum here). These folks are convinced that the earth really is just the way it looks - and thats their main piece of evidence: It looks flat, ergo, it must be.\n\nAnd not only that, but the bottom of the clouds look flat. So there!\n\nOf course, space travel posed a brief problem, until the flat earthers realized that the whole thing was a giant cold war conspiracy in which the Americans and the Russians engaged in a giant make-up-a-story competition.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, so to speak, is the noble profession of Rumpology. Rumpologists, of whom Sylvestor Stallones mum is a leading expert, believe that you can tell a persons future by looking at the butt. Those of us with round rears tend to be happy, while flat bummers are vain, negative and sad.\n\nWho knew?\n\nBut get this; people actually pay to have their rear ends read. So it must be true, no ifs or butts sorry. I cant make up my mind if being a Rumpologist would be a really good job or a really terrible one.\n\nAnd no wisecracks. Sorry again.\n\nBut before you rush off in search of a large mirror\n\nI dont want to pick on our friends across the pond, but Americans do seem more than average likely to believe . well, anything.\n\nThe US national pollster, Public Policy Polling has discovered that one in four Americans believe that aliens have visited earth, and one in five believes that a UFO crashed at Roswell. I cant find any data on how Aussies stack up, but Id like to think\n\nAnd about the same proportion believe that these space folk shut themselves up in their wee flying saucers, hurled themselves across light years of empty space, all so they could make cute but confusing diagrams in Farmer Joness fields by squashing his plants.\n\nSo what did Farmer Jones do to piss them off in the first place is what I want to know.\n\nOf course, back in ancient times, people had all kinds of weird beliefs.\n\nAs long ago as 1999, a Gallup Poll, of, yes Americans again, turned up the fact that 18% of the US population believes that the sun revolves around the earth. Its a bit more of that, well, it looks like it does, logic again.\n\nAnd get this, 3% didnt have an opinion one way or the other.\n\nPlease remember that these are the folk with their finger on the big red button. Some of em anyway.\n\nBut lest we Aussies succumb to delusions of intellectual superiority, I have to reluctantly report that 27% of respondents to a survey conducted by Researchers from the Australian Academy of Science believed that dinosaurs roamed the earth at the same time as the earliest humans, which, oddly enough, is the same as the percentage of Texans who believe that.\n\nWho knew that The Flintstones was actually a documentary?\n\nAnd on top of that, an overwhelming number of Aussies think its completely rational that our one dollar coin is twice the size of our two dollar coin.\n\nWell, what else would it be?\n\nHere is something of a personal confession. My sister, who lives in Canberra, earns a very good living making wands. Yes, the magical kind. She sells them on the internet, but the bulk of her business is done at local markets.\n\nJ. K Rowlings has a lot to answer for.\n\nOf course its a bit more understandable given that its Canberra where entire budgets can be made to disappear in the blink of an eye. Fortunately though, there are a few things that are uniquely believed by Australians that turn out to be perfectly true.\n\nFor example, there is no social problem in existence that cant be fixed by providing better sporting facilities.\n\nThat anyone who can skull a yard cant be all bad.\n\nEverybody, everywhere in the world likes Australians, and if they dont, well they can go and get knotted.\n\nThat of course excludes the Barmy Army because they hate everybody.\n\nAnd I must confess that Ive come to believe that yelling at my computer makes it go faster.\n\nHey, science isnt everything, you know.\n\nTheres just nowhere to hide anymore.\n\nMilitary technology has created some fearsome weapons, such as:\n\nThe 5,000 lb\n\nGBU-28 Deep-Throat bunker buster,\n\nThe 15,000 lb\n\nBLU-82 Daisycutter,\n\nThe 15,650 lb\n\nRussian ATBIP (Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power).\n\nThe 22,000 lb\n\nGrand Slam earthquake bomb.\n\nand the 22,600 lb\n\nGBU-43 MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast),\n\nbut if you were hiding under 50 meters of hardened concrete, none of them were going to bother you.\n\nWell, until now!\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has just taken delivery of the first GBU-57A/B (Massive Ordnance Penetrator). It weighs 30,000 lb and will penetrate 200 ft of hardened concrete BEFORE it goes off. If you are reading this from an underground nuclear facility in Iran or North Korea, might we suggest some extended sick leave is (or soon will be) in order?\n\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of the Massive Ordnance Penetrator is that it is a relatively simple weapon.\n\nThe GBU acronym at the front of the the official designation for the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (GBU-57A/B or MOP) can be found at the front of the name of almost everything the United States Air Force drops from a plane these days.\n\nNot all that long ago, bombs were dropped in large numbers in the hope that at least some of them would hit their target.\n\nThese days, almost every bomb and missile is delivered with pinpoint accuracy. GBU stands for Guided Bomb Unit, and it means that the 20 foot GBU-57 A/B missile is zeroed in on the target by a GPS navigation system guiding its four lattice-type fins.\n\nNot surprisingly, the bomb is intended for only one purpose - to destroy the type of hardened concrete bunkers which house central command facilities and weapons of mass destruction. It's hence not surprising that the program has been hurried into readiness with the growing concern that Iran has developed nuclear weaponry.\n\nIt is designed to penetrate supposedly untouchable facilities in one piece. The warhead case of the MOP is made from a special high performance steel alloy designed to maintain the integrity of the penetrator case during impact so that the payload can then do its job most effectively by exploding deep underground.\n\nThe MOP is deployed from high altitude and allows gravity to add momentum to its 30,000 pound weight so that it hits with enormous kinetic energy.\n\nPut simply, the MOP hits exactly where it is intended to hit with enough energy to bury itself 200+ feet into hardened concrete, then it explodes its 5,300 pound warhead.\n\nAWA\n\nKevin Poulter\n\nIn July of this year, AWA celebrated their 100th year of operations in Australia  all thanks to Thomas Ernest E.T. Fisk.\n\nThomas Fisk, later known as Sir Ernest Fisk, began his business career in England selling newspapers, on a railway station in Middlesex. Fisk graduated in engineering in the works of Frederick Walton, then joined the British Post Office as a wireless telegraphist. Radio-telegraphy was introduced into England by Marconi in 1896. At that time it was accepted that spark transmitters broadcast over such a wide spectrum, only one radio channel was possible world-wide!\n\nMarconis work inspired Fisk to join the Marconi training school in 1906, learning Morse and wireless telegraphy, then qualifying as a radio engineer and operator. From 1909 he worked for American Marconi, demonstrating wireless to Newfoundland sealers and on the St Lawrence, before returning to Marconi's headquarters in London.\n\nWireless Communication was officially recognised by the Australian Commonwealth Government in the Wireless Telegraph Act of 1905. Initially wireless telegraphy was only used in warships on the Australian station.\n\nThe growing potential for Australian wireless business attracted the Marconi Organisations interest, so Fisk was despatched to Australia in 1910 to demonstrate Marconi apparatus. In that year radio telegraphy was realised and the first association of Wireless Experimenters in the British Empire was established in Sydney as \"The Wireless Institute of NSW\". The founder George A. Taylor, was also developing wireless telegraphy, like communication from the front to the rear of a train and between trains running at full speed. The few transmissions at that time were mainly by amateur enthusiasts.\n\nThe Federal Government, acting on a report from Admiral Henderson, invited tenders for the construction of a wireless telegraph station in Sydney and another in Perth - each to have a daylight range of 1,250 miles. Fisk returned to Australia in 1911 to promote Marconi equipment. Unfortunately for the Marconi company, in 1911 a contract was signed with the lowest tenderers, Gesellschaft für drahtlose Telegraphie System (Telefunken) of Berlin for the construction and erection of these stations. Engineers and apparatus were shipped from Germany and the stations were erected, one at Pennant Hills near Sydney and the other at Applecross (above) near Fremantle, during 1912 and 1913.\n\nWhen the Titanic sank in 1912, Shipping Lines began to consider that on board radio was an essential item, sparking renewed potential installations. During 1913 and 1914 a number of smaller stations were erected around the Australian coast at Melbourne, Hobart, Mt. Gambier, Port Adelaide, Esperance, Geraldton, Roebourne, Wyndham, Port Darwin, Thursday Island, Port Moresby, Townsville, Cooktown and Brisbane.\n\nIn 1913 a company was formed, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd; with Australian and English capital amounting to one hundred and forty thousand pounds. Fisk was a foundation Director, also General and Technical manager. AWA immediately purchased existing and future patent rights of the Marconi and Telefunken systems and in 1916 Fisk became AWAs Managing Director.\n\nDuring WW1, AWA developed and manufactured apparatus for the Australasian mercantile marine, plus a large number of complete equipments for British vessels built in Japan and China for the British Ministry of Shipping. The interception of wireless messages from enemy ships at many points in the Pacific and eventually from European Stations in Germany, Italy, France and England, had useful and sometimes important results during the war. In 1917 wireless signals from Germany were intercepted at the Naval Wireless Station in Applecross, WA."
