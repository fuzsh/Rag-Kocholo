        "text": "LOWERHOUSE CC NEWS SPONSORED BY H.RIGG PROPERTIES\n\nThanks\n\nTo Shelly Heap for her magnificent efforts in raising £1200 from the Fun Day.\n\nAlong with very generous donations from Oddies and Motorpoint this will more than cover the cost of a defibrillator. Thanks to both those organisations and to all individual who helped on or before the day, especially Elaine Keenan and of course to all those who supported the event by making donations and attending.\n\nOld pals – Tony Benneworth\n\nI am very pleased to be able to report that I have managed to get in touch with Tony Benneworth on Facebook. I knew that Tony had tried to get in touch with the club and it had niggled that we had missed him. Tony was a Tasmanian who played as an amateur for the club in 1973 until becoming professional in 1974. As I think everyone knows, we weren’t a good side in those days and Tony gave the club a terrific lift with his performances and his character. I was only 13 or so when Tony first came to the club he certainly made an impression on me with his wholehearted approach\n\nOne particular memory I have of Tony is the throwing competitions that he had. He would challenge whoever to beat him in throwing the ball by running down the groundsman’s hut driveway to the edge of the pitch and launching the ball over the square towards the old pavilion. Memories often play tricks but I am sure that his throws used to bounce up the old pavilion steps.\n\nIn his year as professional in 1974 he was second in the league averages behind the legendary Collis King but actually scored more runs than Collis. It was draw cricket in those days and although we were second from bottom we were in a winning position in the vast majority of the fixtures but were often thwarted.\n\nI think I can best give people an impression of Tony by saying that he was very much like Ryan Harris as a person and cricketer. Tony tells me that he has very fond memories of the club and he will be visiting us in 2018. If anyone has any memories of Tony – please email me at stan-heaton@hotmail.co.uk\n\nCongratulations\n\nMore on Georgie Holt (u16 w/keeper, batsman) selection for the Lancashire Thunder (senior women) development programme.\n\nGeorgie is one of only 15 girls selected from the region which includes counties from Cumberland through to Staffordshire. This is a marvellous achievement. Georgie deserves this not only through her ability but also through her dedication. Georgie can often be seen dragging Coach Joe Martin through a session no matter what the weather. This has often included driving rain, very occasional heat waves, biting snow and frost and on one occasion in the middle of smoke pluming off a bonfire. It is no coincidence that our most successful players put in the hard work.\n\nCricket matters\n\nThe senior players held a player’s meeting last week and as chairman it was heartening to see 24 senior players at the meeting with the remaining 4 offering apologies due to work commitments. This is exactly the right attitude that I, and I am sure members and spectators hope to see. The purpose of the meeting was for new captains Ben Heap and Owen Deakin – Pickard to explain their ideas and I took the opportunity to remind the players of the club’s expectations and their roles and responsibilities. It was heartening to receive the feedback and it is clear that our players, young though most of them are, appreciate the work done behind the scenes by volunteers and the support the club receives from its members and supporters.\n\nOther issues covered were the practice and training expectations, availability for selection and individual aspirations. It is some years since we have felt the need to call a meeting and it was a very worthwhile exercise.\n\nLancashire League\n\nThe now annual gathering for club representatives, known as the Rules Meeting took place at Nelson CC last week under the chairmanship of Nelson’s Granville Thompson. The purpose of the meeting is to put together a cogent list of rules changes, amendments and proposals in the hope that a rational discussion will lead to common agreement and a smooth vote at the League Meeting to vote new rules in.\n\nAmongst issues under discussion were the voting arrangements in respect of what constitutes a numerical mandate for constitutional and rule change. Points for a rained off game. Worsley Cup and league rain rules, bowling ratios\n\nCondolences\n\nWe were sad to hear of the recent passing of former Lancashire League players Steve Ratcliffe (Ramsbottom) and Alan Massicks (Haslingden). Steve (bowling) and Alan (wicket keeping) were highly respected players and immensely popular throughout the league. They always played hard but fair and were good company. Their passing at a relatively young age is very sad indeed. Our condolences to their families and the clubs concerned."
