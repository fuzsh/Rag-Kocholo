        "text": "Spending a glorious summer afternoon in one of those Devon meadows with Freddie and his girls, taking notes and reference photos, was a wonderful experience. Freddie, or Yeomadon Ferdinand, as he is more properly known, is a really magnificent Red Ruby Devon bull! One of the most impressive beasts I have ever had the privilege to sculpt, with over twenty breed and interbreed championships to his name – more championships than any other Red Ruby Devon in history. He is an absolute mountain of muscle, but with such a sweet nature. His owners, Tony and Julie Benneworth, made me so welcome. That afternoon will be a memory that I will long cherish.\n\nRed Ruby Devons are not generally a large breed, but very solidly built, with a beautiful short curly, almost Claret red coat and a blonde tip to the tail. They are often polled, but can grow short horns; they are long-lived, with good resistance to disease, have an easy-going nature, and are good mothers.\n\nThe patina was an easy choice – again, it had to be that glorious, plum red of the Ruby’s coat."
