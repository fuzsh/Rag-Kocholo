Cult icon Serge Gainsbourg wrote, directed, and scored Je t’aime moi non plus, a tale of doomed love between a lonely truck stop waitress (Jane Birkin, Blow-Up) and a gay, hunky garbage truck driver (Joe Dallesandro, Flesh), whose boyfriend (Hugues Quester) becomes increasingly jealous of the two.

Sharing its title with Gainsbourg and Birkin’s sexually explicit 1969 hit pop song, the film is an equally provocative depiction of an unlikely couple’s torrid affair.”
