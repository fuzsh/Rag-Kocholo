This week, La Collectionneuse and the American Cinematheque present the 4K restoration of Serge Gainsbourg’s 1976 film JE T’AIME MOI NON PLUS, its first Los Angeles screening in many years. Starring Jane Birkin, Joe Dallesandro, and Hugues Quester, this truck-stop triangle was the first of only two features films Gainsbourg directed.

“Serge is the one who approached me. [Jane and Serge] were great people. Just a great couple that were truly a couple. They were fun to be with. It was really difficult to shoot a film where your love interest is the wife of the man who’s directing it. The film had to be erotic and I had to be very cool. I was doing multiplication tables in my head the whole time. But I loved both of them very much. They were very special people…

“[JE T’AIME MOI NON PLUS] was ahead of its time. I thought the public was gonna be ready for that kind of story. I thought it’d have been a nice success if they’d released it back then. But they weren’t giving Serge the kind of play he wanted.” — Joe Dallesandro
