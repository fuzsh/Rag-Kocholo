        "text": "The first twenty minutes of “The Debt” are a mess. We flash back and forward in time, flit from one location to the next, and soon arrive at the conclusion that the director, John Madden, must have pressed “Shuffle” rather than “Play.” Gradually, things settle down, allowing us to work out what is what, who is who, and, most important, who was who. In 1965, three young members of Mossad—Rachel (Jessica Chastain), David (Sam Worthington), and Stephan (Marton Csokas)—are sent under cover to East Berlin, to track down a doctor named Vogel (Jesper Christensen), formerly known as the Surgeon of Birkenau, and fly him back to Israel. There he is to be tried for war crimes.\n\nRunning in parallel with this mission, which doesn’t go quite as expected, is an account of what happens thirty years on, when its full implications begin to stir. Rachel is now played by Helen Mirren, David by Ciarán Hinds, and Stephan by Tom Wilkinson: a distinguished trio of actors, by any standard, all of whom launch valiant efforts at an Israeli accent and, in case that isn’t diverting enough, look absolutely nothing like their younger selves. Whether the casting director was under constraint, or maybe under the influence, I couldn’t say, but the mismatch is most unfortunate, because, if “The Debt” is about anything, it is about the continuity of silence and guilt. The middle-aged Rachel needs to be plausibly the same person who faced a formidable challenge, back in Berlin. But Chastain is a Botticelli, Mirren is a Renoir, and that’s that.\n\nThe one performer who gets to stick with his character is Christensen, whom I last saw as Mr. White in “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace,” and he pretty much owns his scenes, turning Vogel into a vulture of malicious intent. There is something especially nasty, and not entirely far-fetched, in the notion that this Mengele-like monster has, in the East Germany of the sixties, forged a new identity as a gynecologist. When Rachel, as part of the plan, enrolls as a patient, and lies back in front of him with her feet in stirrups, awaiting the speculum, we sense a prickle of wariness, and a prod of menace, in every question he asks. Sensitive moviegoers who stayed away from the dentist for a year after watching Laurence Olivier as the Nazi tooth driller in “Marathon Man” will find much to squirm at in Vogel. Once kidnapped, he loses none of his attack, needling his captors, daring Rachel to do away with him, and saying, “You Jews, you don’t know how to kill. You only know how to die.”\n\nWho would have thought that John Madden had a gift for villainy? His best-known film, “Shakespeare in Love,” was an evil-free zone, content to frolic in the groves of romantic comedy; yet there is nothing remotely funny about “The Debt,” and Madden’s one gesture toward romance, with both Mossad men contending for Rachel’s favors, is a total bust. Likewise, though his pacing of the action sequences—in particular, the bid to spirit Vogel out of his clinic and onto a train to the West—is done with clarity and care, the pained and pensive intervals make dreary viewing. Sam Worthington did well as the disabled space marine in “Avatar,” but, with his bland and guileless features, he really isn’t someone you should call upon to register the unassuaged grief of losing your family in the Holocaust, which is what is demanded here. As with Spielberg’s “Munich,” there is an awkward, irresoluble tension between the movie’s urge to thrill and the weighty pull of the historical obligations that it seeks to assume. How much, to be blunt, should we be enjoying ourselves? What do we owe to “The Debt”? Whatever the sum, it is more than the film itself, gloomy with unease, seems able to repay.\n\nThe heroes of “The Debt” would be riled and repelled by “Gainsbourg,” and by the attitude that it strikes toward Jewish experience. Where the former film is agonized and sullen, the latter is mischievous and restive, daring us to be dismayed by its insolence. Directed by Joann Sfar, it tells of Serge Gainsbourg, still a household—and probably bedroom—name in France, although he died in 1991. He was a singer, a songwriter, a piano player, a failed painter, a highly successful and systematic drinker, a gradual wreck, and a star. Only in France could you record a reggae version of your national anthem, outraging upright citizens, and then, at your death, be compared to Baudelaire by the President.\n\nGainsbourg was born Lucien Ginsburg, in 1928, to a Russian Jewish family living in Paris, although our first sight of him, in Sfar’s film, is as a kid of ten or so, smoking, at the beach. He is not much older when he attends a life-drawing class, staying behind afterward to ask the model for a private session. She puts her bra back on, but he tells her to remove it. “I don’t know how to draw one,” he says, perhaps the worst excuse ever offered by an artist, of any age. Shameless little Lucien is played by Kacey Mottet-Klein, and his scenes are the lightest and most inventive in the film, even though the forces that oppressed him, at that time, could not have been heavier. Under the Occupation, he is the first in line to collect his yellow star, as if it were a badge of pride, or an award for merit, and, as he walks down a street past a propaganda poster featuring a grotesque head and the warning “France and the Jew,” the head comes to life and waddles after him, like Humpty Dumpty. Much the same occurs when Lucien doodles a self-portrait in a sketchbook; without ado, the figure enters the film—a looming, crooked alter ego, played by an actor with a puppet’s mask. He continues to materialize, unsummoned, throughout Gainsbourg’s life, sitting down beside him to play a piano duet, or—once Lucien has grown up and changed his name to Serge—caressing, with elongated claws, the naked, snoozing body of one of his lovers. This peculiar being is never wholly explained. He remains a benign Nosferatu, halfway between the demon that dogs romantic souls, luring them into a hellfire of trouble, and a treasured imaginary friend.\n\nYou may be freaked out by such episodes, and there is no doubt that they turn “Gainsbourg” into a bitty and whimsical affair. On the other hand, I would back anything that loosens the bonds of the bio-pic. Is there a starchier genre? Has it really progressed since Paul Muni strapped on his beard and went to work as Zola and Pasteur? We know how such stories tend to function: they trace the sine wave of obscurity, glory, and setback and, in the process, gather Academy Awards for those in the central role. This is not to take anything away from Jamie Foxx’s impeccable Ray Charles, in “Ray,” or Marion Cotillard’s Edith Piaf, in “La Vie en Rose,” but merely to wish that the movies around them essayed more risk and surprise. If Eric Elmosnino, who plays the adult Gainsbourg, is less of a standout, that may be because he feels more securely embedded in the film that surrounds him, and in its blithe reluctance to follow narrative custom. The result is a lively bout between bio-pic and fairy tale. So what if Serge has acquired, from nowhere, a shrewish blond wife and a couple of kids? He just got a letter from Juliette Gréco (Anna Mouglalis), the dark-bobbed muse, inviting him to come over; so that’s where he, and the movie, must go.\n\nGiven that Gainsbourg resembled a horse with a hangover, it may seem unfeasible that creatures of rare perfection kept falling into his hay, but such are the mystical rules of attraction that prevail under Gallic skies and, alas, nowhere else. His stable of conquests included Elisabeth Levitsky (Deborah Grall), whom he borrowed from Salvador Dali; Brigitte Bardot (Laetitia Casta), who rolls up to Serge’s place in thigh-high boots, leading an Afghan hound with whom, on this evidence, she shared a hairdresser; and Jane Birkin, played here, with a fine fragility, by the British actress Lucy Gordon, who died after the filming ended. Birkin was the singer’s leading love, the movie suggests, and there’s a beautiful cutaway shot, as the satisfied pair embrace, of the puppet Gainsbourg, seated on the rooftops above and quietly weeping, fearful that his services, as tempter, may no longer be required.\n\nOver time, “Gainsbourg,” like its subject, grows brittle and sad, miles away from the suavity of young Lucien, and you wonder how it earned its subtitle, “A Heroic Life.” Horizontally, as Gainsbourg boasts, he never had any complaints; but what was the secret of the vertical man? It certainly wasn’t his voice, which lacked the striving lungfulness of, say, Charles Aznavour, and which constantly strayed from the note as if from the marital bed. More likely, it was the shakeup that Gainsbourg inflicted on the tradition of the chanson, which the movie has little time to explore, and which would, in any case, be hard for outsiders to grasp. What we can all understand, however, is the sheer stamina of somebody who came through the war, the booze, and the nicotine, yet still found the courage to soldier on through Brigitte Bardot. Everyone loves a survivor. ♦"
