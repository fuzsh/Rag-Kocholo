        "text": "earnestly regret not having seen this before writing my piece about a transmasc cinematic canon… if there’s ever a follow up i’m absolutely writing about this because it’s fucking insane. if you read the Jane Birkin character as a gay trans man - not at all hard considering she literally says “i’m a boy!” at one point - than this comes across as exceptionally progressive. of course this could just as easily be Serge Gainsbourg making a movie about how his wife is so hot she could seduce a gay man but i feel like i would do that too if my wife was Jane Birkin. but also there’s something interesting about an almost certainly heterosexual man making a movie…\n\nLike a Godard film if Godard was only interested in fucking.\n\nI think it probably all meant more to Serge Gainsbourg than it means to me, though the central theme seems to be that Serge Gainsbourg’s real-life partner (Jane Birkin) is so hot that she can make gay men sort of a bit straight for a while. The central gay guy is rubbish collector Joe Dallesandro, who keeps pretending that Birkin’s androgynous barmaid, Johnny, is a boy, and trying to do her up the bum. This makes his psychotic ex-boyfriend jealous. They never reach climax, though, because the pain makes her scream so loudly that they keep being ejected from hotels. This is what passes for a running joke in…\n\nWow. Not quite sure what message French musician/singer-songwriter/director Serge Gainsbourg is sending in this, his first feature. Is it a subversive commentary on sexual fluidity and gender? Or is it exploitative, misogynistic and homophobic.? At times, I was uncomfortable, for sure. But I nonetheless found it fascinating and creative.\n\nThe setting is a desolate desert-like unidentified wasteland of garbage pits with buzzing flies and scavenger crows, aimless men, and women who strip and sell their bodies. A gay trash transporter (Warhol's Factory stud Joe Dallesandro) and his boyfriend (Hugues Quester) - both rough around the edges - stop at a truck stop to fuel up and grab a burger. A young androgynous waitress (Jane Birkin) has an immediate erotic attraction…"
