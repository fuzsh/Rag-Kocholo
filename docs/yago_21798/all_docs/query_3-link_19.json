        "text": "When I think of Serge Gainsbourg, first I think of the women with which he was involved, and the way these relationships affected their careers. For example, Gainsbourg clearly liked to invest in the amateur. France Gall (played by Sara Forestier) was a teen when he started writing songs for her, and Brigitte Bardot (played by Laetitia Casta) and Jane Birkin (played by Lucy Gordon) were actors, not really singers, when he met them. There is much to the theme of transformation in Gainsbourg’s life—he becomes a man he created, so to speak; he makes stars out of girls and women by writing for them; and his longest-lasting love, Birkin, did a lot to change Gainsbourg’s image in return. The film makes an interesting use of special effects to make this point. This is a movie about persona, whether it is that of a scandalized Jew during the 1940s, a scandal-driving socialite during the 1970s, or a scummy drunk wearing double-denim and white Repettos during the 1980s.\n\nWe see animations and puppets describe this, like voices in Serge’s head. Sfar is primarily a graphic novelist, and Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life is his directorial debut. That he chose this story for it seems only natural. A pop icon, like any other form of fantasy, by his nature questions whether art imitates life or vice versa. But when the cartoony inner dialogue of this “heroic” life fades away, so does some focus, and sympathy for our protagonist. In the end Serge meets a young woman (played by Mylène Jamponoï) in a nightclub and yells at her, “You match my aesthetic criteria. You’re beautiful, and you’re also a tragic figure of despair.” In this scene, Bambou (the last woman Gainsbourg officially dated, before his death at 62) ignores him, but eventually relents to the backhanded come-ons. She is covered in bruises and admits she is “a mess,” wanting someone to save her. The film ends a few minutes later. I wonder, after so many glimpses of women, framed by a life (Gainsbourg’s first and second wife also join the cast of characters, but briefly), what I am supposed to make of such a statement. Women act both as transformers and as the transformed, but in the end, one half of this equation has gotten the raw end of the deal, becoming a sort of monstrous representation of male desire. The women at least look blissfully innocent.\n\nThe first scene in which Serge displays lust is in an art studio, where a model poses nude. Throughout this half of the film he draws her, and other female figures, creating a fantastic world before he can enter it. This representation, alongside the flat statements each female makes and their breathy little voices in recordings show an imbalance that is hard to ignore.\n\nSo, what does it mean to value women in a narrative? I’m thinking about this a lot lately because I just came back from a month-long trip to Prague, where I studied Czech literature and a surprisingly sex-driven nightlife. I learned that Czech folklore, especially when compared to the fables and epics coming from surrounding countries, ‘value’ women. In these stories, women make decisions and become leaders, even in the sixteenth century. But: as we have learned by reading Laura Mulvey’s Narrative Cinema and Visual Pleasure (aka “The Male Gaze”) back in the 1990s, just because a story appreciates a woman does not mean it values her. She can be the impetus for change, and still be objectified. In fact, her role as impetus often objectifies her: She is a siren, she is a witch, she is a matron, but she is also a bump or a fork in the road, not the hero who travels it.\n\nConversations about exotic dancing and prostitution took place again and again while I studied in Prague. Are some of these women progressive? Are they using femininity as a tool? Haven’t we gotten past these conversations yet? But what was it that we decided? Two of the most famous Gainsbourg clips on YouTube are the one where he tells Whitney Houston, on national television, “I want to fuck you,” and the one where he tells porn star Catherine Ringer that she is a disgusting whore.\n\nHere is another question: What is a hero? The title of this film obviously questions it, and so does, interestingly, most Czech literature (think about the protagonists in stories by Franz Kafka, Gustav Meyrink, Bohumil Hrabal, and Milan Kundera). For example: Is Tomas, in Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being, after all of his cheating and lying and objectifying, a hero, because of his relationship to the structuring of the story? Is the narrator a hero? Is Kundera, himself? Is Gainsbourg? When I see a womanizer portrayed in a story, I react in one of two ways: I am impressed by how the story can show misogyny without asking me to judge, or I am unimpressed, because I am asked to make a call about a character. In other words: I don’t want to think about whether it is Kundera or the narrator or Tomas who is misogynistic. I want that to be clear to me from the beginning. If I had known that the Kundera favors male characters by giving them depth, while he transparently and intentionally uses female characters as devices, I would have saved myself some grief by not reading his work.\n\nPlenty of books and movies give me a male protagonist who does not think highly of women, and plenty of those same books and movies give me more pleasure because of it. In the context of the narrative, I expect a little misogyny, and I understand its benefit to characterization. I’m thinking of such classics as Harvey Kietel’s bad lieutenant in Bad Lieutenant and Vincent Gallo’s Billy Brown in Buffalo ’66. I can even get behind seemingly misogynistic plots, in which women are viewed as evil, like in Lars Von Trier’s Antichrist, as long as the direction seems fully realized and confident. Films are just ideas, anyway, none of them exactly reflecting my own thoughts on a matter. I only want something to get me to think—to try to transform me.\n\nGainsbourg has always baffled me in the area of misogyny. I am thinking, of course, of his image, the character he created for himself: a man of scandal, sensuality, and sleaze. Gainsbourg smoked like a chimney and drank like a fish, dated ladies famous for their beauty, and wrote hits for lots of other sexy singers for over almost four decades. Sfar’s film focuses on Gainsbourg’s personal struggles: he was a Russian Jew in France who viewed himself as ungainly and unattractive unless he was drinking. He transforms several times, and even rejects the puppet-conscience who instigates his initial changes after he falls in love with Birkin, who becomes “his Pygmalion.” It is not a focus of the film, but it is clear that the women around him suffer from Serge’s constant reinvention.\n\nGainsbourg’s career is a fascinating one mostly because of its controversy. His songs inspired everything from incest allegations (with “Lemon Incest,” performed with daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg, who wears only a shirt and panties in the music video) to accusations of encouraging anti-Semitism as a Jewish anti-nationalist (with “Aux Armes et cetera,” a reggae version of the French national anthem). Gainsbourg loved puns, but many were lost in English translation. The meaning behind the popular “Je T’aime . . . Moi Non Plus,” however, was not lost on other audiences: It is made up of sounds (first recorded by Bardot, and later by Birkin) simulating a female orgasm. The unpopular “Evguénie Sokolov” is made up of sounds simulating flatulence.\n\nSfar says that Gainsbourg,“could have killed his mother just to please the audience. It was just about getting interest and finding provocation.” When I ask him about daughter Charlotte’s place in the film, he says, “My perception is that he clearly managed to have a daughter that was in love with him, and no one can name the damage that can do.” Charlotte worked on the film for six months, learning the role of her father, before the terrific Eric Elmosnino was cast. The experience was too much for her, and she backed out, says Sfar. “But this was not my subject. My subject was this young boy who gets a yellow star when he is nine years old and finds out then that he is a Jew.”\n\nBut the women in Gainsbourg stand out more than the puppets depicting anti-Semitic propaganda, the drawings of dogs with erections, and Serge’s crisis in which he imagines his head is a cabbage. Sfar continues, “I was a fool because I guess the most interesting moments in the movie are moments with Brigitte Bardot . . . I should have made a two-hour movie with Laetitia Casta.”\n\nEven in a fictionalized version of Gainsbourg’s life, there exists a power struggle. Serge fights for screen time while Brigitte brilliantly dances on a piano. The sheer number of women who come in and out of Serge’s life describes frustration. But does this mean that he devalues them? Does it mean the narrative does, by skipping over any female-felt inferiority? Perhaps the characters of Brigitte and Jane simply did not ask to be analyzed. When asked how the real-life Bardot and Birkin responded to the film, Sfar says that Bardot worked closely with Casta, but now denies ever knowing about the filming of Gainsbourg. Birkin apparently said, after reading the script, “Serge would be happy, but I will be sad, so I will not see your movie.” Interestingly, although Sfar insists his movie is not a biopic, but more of a tribute, he strictly used lines from interviews with Gainsbourg to create the character of Serge. “There must not be a single sentence in the script that does not come from him . . . which does not mean it is true.”\n\nGainsbourg: A Heroic Life directed by Joann Sfar, debuted in France last year and will open on Wednesday, August 31st in New York at Film Forum."
