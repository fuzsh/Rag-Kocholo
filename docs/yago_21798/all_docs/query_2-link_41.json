        "text": "This is how you show charisma on screen. I don't understand the mechanics of it, the magnetics of it, but whether he's a kid or a grown-up, Serge's presence is the centre of every scene.\n\nI felt seduced. Well, very very nearly seduced: leaning over, kicking my shoes off... but that's it. (At a party or the pub, I was always too much of a lookist bitch to end up going home with that silver-tongued wit whose attention I lapped up, but whom I mercilessly did not want to see undressed.) It almost seemed like a cruel thought whilst watching Gainsbourg, one of whose themes is the way Serge's creativity was driven by his demons - ugliness and his experience…\n\nI am absolutely fascinated by Serge Gainsbourg. I love his work, I love the people he loved, I love his style and his magnetism and how just fucking COOL he is. I've wanted to see this for so long, rather than being a run of the mill bio this brings something more with surreal elements. I do think it relies on you knowing at least a vague bit about Serge's life before watching, as at times I was getting confused since it jumps into the future quite a lot, but overall this is so charming and lovely, with (naturally) a great soundtrack.\n\nYes, Serge was a cunt, and this skirts around most of his cuntish behaviors, but he was still…\n\nAKA: “Mr. YéhYéh-NoNo”\n\nIt's 1971 and you're having a sleepover at your friend Rob's house. You're in the living room watching Fright Night with Sinister Seymour hosting, but you can hear organ music and low moaning coming from his sister Cathy's room. Her door is ajar, so you and Rob sneak over ever so quietly and peer into her bedroom. As your eyes become adjusted to the red glow of the ring of lava lamps surrounding her Waterbed Warehouse $70 special mattress and frame, you seen two figures heaving and bobbing in the artificial waves to the accompaniment of mysterious French lyrics and even louder erotic moans:\n\nJe vais et je viens, entre tes reins\n\nTu es la vague, moi…\n\nI'm generally lukewarm to biopics because they all seem to have the same Hollywood arc to them, that isn't to say that they aren't entertaining they just get a bit predictable. GAINSBOURG breaks that with its experimental dreamlike fairy tale vibe. Gainsbourg in real life had an air of mystique to him and this movie keeps that in tact. You can never really tell what is a lie or truth or neither or both and it works really well here.\n\nThe visuals really help seal the fairy tale tone with a crazy giant headed version of Gainsbourg as a youth to the creepy rat-like alter ego La Gueule. Parts become borderline musical pieces and others hit the general biopic stream…"
