Winner Césars for Best Actor (Eric Elmosnino), Best First Film and Best Sound.\n\nIn French with English subtitles.\n\nA Music Box Films release.|\n\nTrailer\n\nTaking the best from LA VIE EN ROSE and AMELIE, renowned comic book artist Joann Sfar’s GAINSBOURG: A HEROIC LIFE is a completely original take on one of France’s greatest mavericks, the illustrious and infamous poet, singer-songwriter and musician Serge Gainsbourg (Eric Elmosnino). Born Lucien Ginsburg to Russian- Jewish parents, Sfar follows him from his precocious childhood in Nazi-Occupied Paris, to his beginnings as small time jazz musician and, finally, pop superstar. Along the way he romances many of the era’s most beautiful female singers, including Juliette Greco (Anna Mouglalis), Brigitte Bardot (Laetitia Casta) and Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon). Employing a witty, surrealistic style and soundtrack that includes many of the musician’s greatest hits, GAINSBOURG: A HEROIC LIFE is a quintessential time capsule from 1960s Paris."
