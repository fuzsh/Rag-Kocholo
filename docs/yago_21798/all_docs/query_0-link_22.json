        "text": "Virtual Screening Available In the USA\n\nAvailable Friday, April 2 – Thursday, April 8\n\nNEW 4K RESTORATION\n\nCult icon Serge Gainsbourg wrote, directed, and scored this tale of doomed love between a lonely truck stop waitress (Jane Birkin) and a gay, hunky garbage truck driver (Joe Dallesandro), whose boyfriend (Hugues Quester) becomes increasingly jealous of the two. Sharing the title with Gainsbourg and Birkin’s sexually-explicit 1969 hit pop song, JE T’AIME, MOI NON PLUS is an equally provocative depiction of sexual gratification told through the story of an unlikely couple.\n\nIn French with English subtitles."
