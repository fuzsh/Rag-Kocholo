        "text": "THE ACTRESS Charlotte Gainsbourg looked wistfully at a lock of Charlotte Bronte's hair, woven into a mourning bracelet, at the Pierpoint Morgan Library's \"Art of the Brontes\" exhibition. Ms. Gainsbourg was visiting New York to promote \"Jane Eyre,\" opening on Friday and based, of course, on Bronte's 1847 novel about an impoverished governess who falls tempestuously in love with her brooding employer, Mr. Rochester, played by William Hurt.\n\nIt wasn't, however, merely the sight of Charlotte Bronte's hair that moved Ms. Gainsbourg. Later that day, she acknowledged that she had kept a similar memento of her father, the singer, songwriter and actor Serge Gainsbourg, who died in 1991. His death, she said, had been the defining moment in her life, \"a black spot.\"\n\nMs. Gainsbourg, 24, is sparing with such revelations. Thin and boyish, with a pale, oval face, she talks shyly about her 12-year film career spanning 10 films and her upbringing as the daughter of Mr. Gainsbourg and the English actress Jane Birkin. Whereas her unmarried parents reveled in their notoriety as very public lovers who once recorded a pop song that was widely banned for its simulation of the sounds of love making, Ms. Gainsbourg is a church mouse by comparison.\n\nAlthough established in European cinema, she is scarcely a marquee name in the United States, where only the 1989 film \"The Little Thief\" brought her attention. And unlike the celestial beauties of French cinema who grace magazine covers, \"I don't really have the looks,\" she said.\n\nWith French as her first language, she approaches some English words hesitatingly, yet in a perfect BBC accent. Her Frenchness was never discussed with her when she was being cast as Jane Eyre. Nor, it seems, did anyone raise the specter of the unreleased 1993 film of Emily Bronte's \"Wuthering Heights,\" which had another French actress, Juliette Binoche, in the lead.\n\nThis \"Jane Eyre,\" directed by Franco Zeffirelli with great fidelity to the book, also stars Joan Plowright as Mrs. Fairfax (Rochester's housekeeper) and Anna Paquin as the young Jane. Previous screen Janes have included Virginia Bruce in a forgotten 1934 film, Joan Fontaine in the 1944 version that starred Orson Welles as Rochester, and Susannah York in a 1971 British television movie.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
