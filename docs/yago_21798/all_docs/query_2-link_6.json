        "text": "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life (or Gainsbourg: Vie HÃ©roÃ¯que) shakes up the typical biopic formula of the rise and fall of a star, blending the legend of French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg with its surrealist, musical narrative. As NPRâs Ian Buckwalter describes, âThe resulting film is...like no biopic you've seen before.â\n\nA Twisted Fairytale\n\nDirected by Joann Sfar, a âbande dessinÃ©eâ (comic book) artist known for his series Le Chat du Rabbin (The Rabbiâs Cat), the film infuses the fantastical with the grittier parts of\n\nGainsbourgâs infamous life. And what a life it was:\n\nWith cartoon characters jumping out of a young Gainsbourgâs sketchbook and the singerâs head turning to a literal head of lettuce in another scene, the filmâs outlandish, yet extraordinary world feels right out of a twisted fairytale. The audience can most clearly see Sfarâs artistic influence and dexterity in the character of âLa Gueule,â the personification of Gainsbourgâs âMug.â\n\nFirst emerging from an anti-Semitic poster Gainsbourg sees in his childhood, the figure follows the singer throughout his life. In his review, longtime Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan remarks how La Gueule is âthe filmâs boldest stroke...La Gueuleâs enormous nose, huge ears and terrifying, Nosferatu-inspired long fingers mark him as a truly fantastical creature who deftly epitomizes the doubts and insecurities that plagued Gainsbourg no matter how successful he became.âÂ\n\nThe Singer and His Muses\n\nAlongside this cartoonish figure, Gainsbourg features a large ensemble of characters as the film explores almost six decades of the singerâs lifeÂ â from his father and his influence in Gainsbourgâs piano playing to the titular characterâs numerous affairs with the likes of Brigette Bardot (Laetitia Casta, who received a CÃ©sar nomination for the role) and Jane Burkin (the late Lucy Gordon, who the film is dedicated to).\n\nAs Varietyâs Jordan Mintzer notes âBoth evocative and faithful in its depiction of the famed French singer's lascivious life, Gainsbourgâ¦offers up a feast of memorable chansons and an almost endless parade of drop-dead-gorgeous muses.â\n\nActors Kacey Mottet-Klein and Eric Elmosnino who portray Gainsbourg from adolescence to old age produce standouts performances in the film, exploring Gainsbourgâs psyche in the whimsical, absurdist style of the film, often jumping years from scene to scene. As The New Yorkerâs Anthony Lane writes,Â âShameless little Lucienâ (Gainsbourgâs name before he changed it to Serge), played by Mottet-Klein has scenes that are âthe lightest and most inventive in the film, even though the forces that oppressed him, at that time, could not have been heavierâ â referring to the Nazi occupation of France which submitted Jews like Gainsbourg to daily indignities such as wearing the yellow star.\n\nâ\n\nWinning the 2011 CÃ©sar Award for Best Actor for the role, Elmosnino masterfully portrays the singer throughout his adulthood and music career. In Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life, audiences are treated to a biopic that does justice to its truly legendary hero."
