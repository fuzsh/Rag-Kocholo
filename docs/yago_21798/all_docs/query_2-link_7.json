        "text": "Blending fantasy and fact, “Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life” puts a curious spin on the biopic genre, with results that start fresh but turn frustrating.\n\nout of 5 stars\n\nCast: Eric Elmosnino, Laetitia Casta, Lucy Gordon, Kacey Mottet Klein\n\nDirector: Joann Sfar\n\nRating: R for nudity, sexuality and language\n\nTheater: Ragtag\n\nThe film recounts the life of French cultural icon Serge Gainsbourg, who dabbled in art, music, film and writing but specialized in booze, cigarettes and women. The movie marks the directing debut of French comic-book artist Joann Sfar, who adapted the script from his graphic novel. A self-described Gainsbourg fanatic, Sfar’s interpretation of his hero’s life is delightfully unorthodox at best and utterly indecipherable at worse. The film as a whole is wildly creative, but as a biopic, it’s far from revealing. Emotionally, it fails to register at all.\n\nPresented in French with English subtitles, the story begins in the early 1940s in Nazi-occupied France. Initially played by Kacey Mottet Klein, the young Gainsbourg, born Lucien Ginsburg, is seen as a precocious lad, pressured by his strict father (Razvan Vasilescu) to learn the piano. He complies, but his true talent is as an artist. He draws and paints imaginative characters, many of them caricatures of himself. He also likes drawing lewd cartoons to entertain schoolmates and secretly fancies himself a seducer of women.\n\nAs an adult, the chain-smoking Gainsbourg — now played by Eric Elmosnino — earns a living playing piano in Paris bars while struggling to make his name as an artist. Around this time, as imagined by Sfar, Gainsbourg begins interacting with an alter ego named La Gueule (Doug Jones), a tall, puppet-like creature with a massive beaked nose, spindly fingers and Dumbo ears. Meant to represent his selfish, devilish side, the creature appears frequently, steering Gainsbourg down dark and lascivious paths.\n\nThe screenplay takes a linear path, more or less, from the early 1940s to the late 1980s, stopping short of Gainsbourg’s death at age 62 in 1991. There are no discernable transitions between periods, however, so one moment he’s learning Django Reinhardt guitar techniques in the mid-’50s, and in the next scene, he’s pitching 1960s pop songs for teen sensation France Gall (Sara Forestier). Blink again, and it’s the late ’60s, where Gainsbourg pitches woo to Brigitte Bardot (Laetitia Casta) and Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon). Somewhere in between, there are marriages, children and a career that earn him fame, fans and money but only fleeting happiness.\n\nGainsbourg’s music is featured throughout the film, but it is treated more like a means to an end than a true driving force in his life. I pride myself for appreciating music in most of its forms, but I just can’t wrap my ears around the tunes of Gainsbourg. His early lounge and jazz work features lovely melodies, but I find the lyrics pretentious and juvenile, especially those ripe with double entendres. French pop from the ’60s, like Gainsbourg’s “Baby Pop,” which was a major hit for Gall, is sugar-coated kitsch.\n\nElmosnino throws himself into the title role, and his dead-on performance is one of the main reasons to view this film. It wasn’t much of a stretch, but kudos to the makeup artists who roughed up his appearance to resemble the real-life Gainsbourg, a man who considered himself about as attractive as a lump of roast beef. Though not far from the truth, he somehow became one of Europe’s most notorious lotharios. Go figure. I also enjoyed Gordon’s fragile performance, perhaps tinged with the knowledge that the actress committed suicide mere months after production wrapped on the film.\n\nIn Sfar’s hands, the film is poorly edited and often nonsensical, concerned more with hallucinatory visual flourishes than a cohesive narrative structure. A little goes a long way, and in the end, Sfar’s cinematic inexperience, combined with his own massive ego, causes the film to run long and flat. An ambitious failure."
