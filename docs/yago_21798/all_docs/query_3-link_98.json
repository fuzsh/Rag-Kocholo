        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Charlotte Gainsbourg is in talks to join Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson in The Snowman for director Tomas Alfredson and Brit production powerhouse Working Title in association with Alfredson’s Another Park Film.\n\nWorking Title’s dynamic duo Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner will produce with Robyn Slovo and Piodor Gustafsson. Matthew Michael Carnahan penned the script based on the Jo Nesbo book. Martin Scorsese is exec producing alongside Nesbo and Niclas Salomonsson, who reps Nesbo. Working Title’s Liza Chasin and Amelia Granger will also exec produce.\n\nThe film – and bestselling book series — revolves around idiosyncratic detective Harry Hole in the Oslo police department. This particular story has Hole investigating the murder of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around a snowman.\n\nLong a staple of art house crossover faves like Lars Von Trier, Gainsbourg — the daughter of French singer Serge Gainsbourg and pop culture icon Jane Birkin — is taking on higher-profile roles alongside her more indie work. She co-stars in Roland Emmerich’s mega-budget sequel Independence Day: Resurgence as well as opposite Jim Carrey in Alexandos Avranas’ True Crimes. Also in the pipeline is Israeli director Joseph Cedar’s English-language debut Oppenheimer Strategies with Richard Gere and Steve Buscemi.\n\nShe is repped by UTA, Artmedia, 42 and Untitled Entertainment."
