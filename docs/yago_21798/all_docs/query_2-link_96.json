        "text": "WILL BRITAIN finally fall in love with Serge Gainsbourg, nearly 40 years after the notorious French singer-songwriter seduced quintessential English rose Jane Birkin?\n\nThe boot-faced Lothario and lyricist par excellence never enjoyed the iconic cultural status, or record sales, here that he did in his native France where President Francois Mitterand lamented after his death in 1991 (by heart attack, aged 62): \"He was our Baudelaire, our Apollinaire.\"\n\nYet an acclaimed new biopic, Gainsbourg, starring theatre actor Eric Elmosnino as the decadent musician notorious for his industrial intake of alcohol and string of beautiful lovers is tipped to be one of the sleeper hits at the British box office this summer.\n\nDirected by French graphic novelist Joann Sfar, it is hoped the picture will replicate the success of Coco Before Chanel, another French film about a cultural icon, the fashion designer Coco Chanel, played by Audrey Tautou.\n\n\"Coco Before Chanel showed that a bit of French glamour and sex appeal can go a long way in the British box office and Gainsbourg should do the same, \" said Terence Doyle, editor of British Film Magazine. \"He's an intriguing character who bedded some of the world's most beautiful women and has inspired contemporary British and American bands like Franz Ferdinand, REM and Portishead.\"\n\nThe eye-catching cast includes model Laetitia Casta as Brigitte Bardot, with whom Gainsbourg sang duets and enjoyed a year-long affair, and the late Lucy Gordon as actress Birkin whose heavy panting on the couple's provocative hit single \"Je T'Aime. . . Moi Non Plus\" (\"I Love You?Me Neither\") outraged the Vatican.\n\nCoco Before Chanel showed that a bit of French glamour and sex appeal can go a long way in the British box office\n\nThe film is dedicated to Gordon who committed suicide last year, aged 28, with the world seemingly at her feet. The Oxford-raised model and actress, who had seen off competition from more than 500 young actresses for the role, hanged herself in the Paris apartment she shared with her boyfriend, cinematographer Jerome Alveras.\n\n\"The film owes a great deal to the warmth, the sweetness and the immense talent of Lucy Gordon, \" said Sfar. \"Her personality was so luminous, so light, so funny.\"\n\nBirkin, now 62, has paid her own touching tribute to the actress and her performance, saying: \"There was such honesty, such freshness in her face that I could not have been more flattered.\"\n\nThe film, which shows Gainsbourg seducing Birkin while taking a swim in his French flag underpants, portrays his evolution from shy, poetic boy, ashamed of what he calls his \"ugly Jewish face\", to provocative womaniser who descended into alcoholism.\n\nCritic Anne Billson describes the film as \"an ode to a mythomaniac who believed in his own legend so much that it either made or destroyed him, depending on your point of view.\"\n\nSafr says: \"It's not the truth about Gainsbourg that interests me but his lies.\"\n\nTHE SON of Jewish immigrants, Gainsbourg was born Lucien Ginsburg in 1928 (\"He thought it was a loser's name, \" said Birkin) and spent his early years under the shadow of Nazism.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nIn Nazi-occupied Paris the Ginsburgs were forced to declare themselves Jews and wear the yellow star. \"Even at 13, 14-yearsold I had already become an outsider, \" recalled Gainsbourg.\n\nDeportation to a death camp was avoided only when the family fled to Limoges with false papers.\n\nBack in Paris after the war, Lucien's father Joseph earned his living playing piano in cabarets and casinos while Lucien attended art school and started dating Elisabeth Levitsky, a part-time model who supported him financially and became his first wife.\n\nKeen to earn money of his own he began performing in nightclubs, playing the piano like his father, before abandoning art altogether. He was frustrated he wasn't more talented and branched out into songwriting, renaming himself Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nA year in the army had given him a taste for alcohol and cigarettes and the pastis swilling, Gitanes-smoking performer with the jug ears began to prove an unlikely hit with the opposite sex, while emerging as a truly original musician experimenting in a succession of different styles (jazz, pop, rock and reggae).\n\nElizabeth divorced him because of his womanising and many of his songs contained themes with a sly sexual twist like Lollipops, the first cause célèbre of his career. Recorded by teenage star France Gall, for whom he had earlier composed a Eurovision Song Contest winner, the song had a clear double meaning apparently lost on the innocent singer herself.\n\nIt was nothing, however, compared to the sensation of Je T'Aime. . . Moi Non Plus, his most notorious work, which Gainsbourg had originally recorded with Bardot. The couple had enjoyed a year-long affair precipitating Gainsbourg's divorce from his second wife, Beatrice.\n\nThe single, which featured erotic sighs and groans from the duetting couple, was not released out of respect for Bardot's husband Gunther Sachs, whom she had married in the interim, and Gainsbourg rerecorded it with new girlfriend Jane Birkin.\n\nHe met the beautiful 22-year-old ingénue while acting in the film, Slogan. Of their first date at the famed Champs Elysées nightclub, Birkin said: \"It quickly turned out that what I had taken for arrogance was actually extreme shyness.\"\n\nThe Vatican called the song obscene and the BBC banned it but it still went to number one in Britain (Gainsbourg's only hit outside France) and sold six million copies worldwide.\n\nAS FOR rumours that the couple were really making love when they recorded it Birkin said: 'Serge's reply was it wouldn't have been a single, it would have been a long-playing record.\"\n\nGainsbourg and Birkin became the celebrity couple du jour and stayed together for 13 years (never marrying, contrary to rumours), having a daughter, actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.\n\nIn 1984, when she was 13, Charlotte recorded a duet with her father that shocked France. Lemon Incest appeared to be a paen to the ultimate taboo (\"the love that we will never make, \" sang Serge) and an accompanying video showed a barely clothed father and daughter in bed together.\n\n\"I had fun with it, \" recalled Charlotte.\n\nThe only time her father did embarrass her, she said, was when he burned a 500 franc note on television to protest about high taxes: \"The next day in school the kids burnt my work, which was upsetting.\"\n\nOther scandals she took in her stride including Gainsbourg's infamous reggae version of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, and the occasion in 1986 when he told Whitney Houston on a chat show: \"I want to **** you.\"\n\nHis later years saw a rapid decline into alcholism, prompting heart and liver problems (\"He spent 10 years committing suicide, \" said a friend) but when he died in 1991 the whole of France mourned.\n\n\"Through his love for language and his musical genius he lifted the song to the level of art, \" said French President Francois Mitterand.\n\nGainsbourg the movie will give British audiences the chance to finally embrace the quintessential French icon.\n\nGainsbourg is released on July 30."
