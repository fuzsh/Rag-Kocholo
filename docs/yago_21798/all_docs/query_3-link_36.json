        "text": "The first film written and directed by iconic French singer and songwriter Serge Gainsbourg is a love triangle that begins when a lonely truck-stop waitress (Jane Birkin, Gainsbourg’s then-partner) falls for a hunky garbage collector (American cult actor and Warhol sex symbol Joe Dallesandro), making her boyfriend jealous. The movie shares its title with that of a sexually-explicit 1969 pop hit by Gainsbourg and Birkin. Also featuring a youthful Gérard Depardieu.\n\n“Gainsbourg, like Prince after him, came from music to filmmaking with a strong cinematic sense.” – The New York Time\n\nTickets available online and on the door."
