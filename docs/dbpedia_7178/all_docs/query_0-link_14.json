        "text": "At the end of Barbara Cook’s remarkable recent concert at Carnegie Hall to celebrate her 85th birthday, several guest artists and colleagues came onstage to pay homage. For me, the most revealing tribute came from an opera singer, the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, who said that when she was a child in New Mexico in the early 1960s, the first beautiful voice she ever heard was Ms. Cook’s, on the original cast recording of “The Music Man.”\n\n“I wanted to be you,” Ms. Graham told Ms. Cook, who is a passionate and informed opera fan. Ms. Graham said that Ms. Cook’s example was in no small measure an inspiration for her own career, a career that she hopes will continue for a little while longer, Ms. Graham added modestly, pinching two fingers together to suggest that even just a bit more was all an opera singer can expect.\n\nThen Ms. Graham sang “Till There Was You,” the beguiling love song that Ms. Cook introduced in “The Music Man” on Broadway in 1957. The richness, tenderness and effortless soaring power of Ms. Graham’s singing made clear that, at 52, she has more than a finger pinch of years ahead of her.\n\nOf course, to be singing at 85 is an absurd impossibility for an opera singer, though there have been artists, those who knew what they were doing and had good health, who sang impressively into their 60s, like the great Joan Sutherland. Plácido Domingo is another story. Unable to call it quits, he has remade himself into a baritone, the voice category he first emerged with as a young man, until, note by note, he built his top range and became a tenor. He will be 72 when he takes on the baritone role of Germont in Verdi’s “Traviata” at the Met this spring. The problem with his performances as a baritone, however, is that his voice still has a tenor’s colorings and character. His late success is the result of fierce determination and is no model for young singers.\n\nAs it happens, a week before Ms. Cook’s moving concert at Carnegie Hall, Barbra Streisand, now 70 (which in a singer’s life is nothing like being 85), returned to Brooklyn, her birthplace, to give two concerts at the new Barclays Center. Like Ms. Cook (whose birthday is on Thursday), Ms. Streisand has had to learn to adjust her vocal artistry as her voice has weathered. High notes do not come as easily, though even in her vocal prime, Ms. Streisand’s high range was not her comfort zone. In those days, whether she let a top note shimmer with penetrating power or coaxed her voice to reach the peak of a phrase with breathy expressivity, her singing was driven by the instincts of a born actress who was using her voice “as a means to an end,” as Ms. Streisand explained in a 2009 interview.\n\nShe continues, to the delight of her countless admirers, including me. In song after song during the first Barclays program, Ms. Streisand found her way, even when it had to be a new, altered way, to enthrall and move her audience in songs she first claimed long ago, like “My Funny Valentine,” and an achingly wistful performance of “The Way We Were,” dedicated to its composer, her old friend Marvin Hamlisch, who died in August.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
