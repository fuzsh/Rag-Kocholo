        "text": "Stephen Sondheim had three rules when speaking about his own writing: Less is more, God is in the details, and content dictates form. While the first two are rather self-explanatory, when it comes to a career as storied as Sondheim's, the third begs the question, how can you possibly describe this content?\n\nOver his lifetime, Sondheim — who lived to be 91 years old, dying of cardiovascular disease in 2021 — was first and foremost a composer and lyricist of the musical theater. He wrote music and lyrics for 16 shows, counting the posthumously produced \"Here We Are,\" and lyrics solely for three (or four, depending on how you count) more, two of which — \"West Side Story\" and \"Gypsy\" — are among the most famous and highly-regarded productions of all time.\n\nEven two years since his passing, his influence is still being honored. At the 2024 GRAMMYs, Sondheim's likeness appears twice in the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album category: for Vol. 3 of the popular Broadway concert series, Sondheim Unplugged (The NYC Sessions), and for Liz Callaway's tribute project, To Steve With Love: Liz Callaway Celebrates Sondheim. What's more, the 2023 Josh Groban-starring Broadway revival of Sondheim's famed musical \"Sweeney Todd\" earned a nod for Best Musical Theater Album. (\"Sweeney Todd\" won Sondheim a GRAMMY in 1980 for Best Cast Show Album, one of seven GRAMMYs he won in his lifetime.)\n\nAll of that barely begins to describe his accomplishments. Sondheim, a protégé of lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, revolutionized the art form that his mentor helped to invent. Hammerstein and Richard Rodgers created \"Oklahoma!,\" considered one of the first examples of the \"integrated musical,\" a show where the music, the lyrics, the book, and the dances all work together to tell a story. Sondheim would take those lessons to heart, simultaneously expanding and blowing apart the structure.\n\nTake his 1970 show \"Company,\" for example, which has no real plot at all, and is often referred to as a \"concept musical.\" It's a series of vignettes, and it's unclear whether they happen consecutively or are months or years apart.\n\nThat was only the beginning of his experimentation. He did a show featuring ghosts (\"Follies\"), a show about cannibalism (\"Sweeney Todd\"), a show about geopolitics (\"Pacific Overtures\"), a show about historical pariahs (\"Assassins\"), even a show where time goes backwards (\"Merrily We Roll Along\"). But no matter how far out he got, there was always coherence and heart at play. Everything about the songs his characters sang — the harmonic language, the musical style, the delivery, the melody, the vocabulary, the rhyme choices — was determined by the character and the story.\n\nAnd what wonderful characters and stories they were. While his shows appeal to all ages, Sondheim's best work is mostly for adults. His characters have known disappointment, love unattainable people, are not where they saw themselves in life, and have hard choices to make in complicated situations. Sometimes they make the challenging but necessary decision to \"Move On\"...and sometimes they kill a President. To take those complexities and make them sing, well, that's the root of his genius.\n\nBecause Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics (and lived to his nineties), there are a nearly infinite amount of ways to experience his work. The best, of course, is to go out and see a show in person. Three of his shows are playing in New York right now (\"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Merrily We Roll Along,\" and \"Here We Are\"), and \"Company\" is currently on tour.\n\nAside from live theater, there are countless other ways to delve into the work of musical theater's Shakespeare. Below, Sondheim's career is broken down by seven categories, each of which include a mix of canonical classics and personal favorites. This is in no way comprehensive or definitive, so apologies for missing your favorite Gypsy revival cast album or Sondheim birthday concert. And away we go!\n\nCabaret Albums\n\nHearing Sondheim songs without the context of a show can be surprising at first. After all, everything about the material is meant for a particular moment in a specific story. And yet, hearing one singer interpret a range of numbers can be a revelatory experience. You can find different meanings (and in at least one case we'll examine shortly, different lyrics!), and hear new interpretations.\n\nThe most famous interpreter of Sondheim is arguably Barbra Streisand, who recorded eight of his songs on her massively successful LP The Broadway Album (and three more on Back To Broadway). Her singing is (unsurprisingly) stunning, but what's most notable is that she actually got Sondheim to write new material — to rework \"Putting It Together\" to make it about a singer instead of a painter, and to write a new bridge for \"Send In The Clowns.\"\n\nEnglish singer and actress Cleo Laine released Cleo Sings Sondheim in 1988, and she smartly got Sondheim's longtime orchestrator Jonathan Tunick to conduct. So you can not only hear songs Tunick orchestrated in their original stage productions, you can also hear his arrangements of songs from before he and Sondheim started working together in 1970. Curious what a Tunick-orchestrated \"Anyone Can Whistle\" or \"Evening Primrose\" might have sounded like? You can get a taste here.\n\nSeveral actors who have been in Sondheim shows have further honored his greatness by interpreting his material. Three quick examples: Bernadette Peters' superb Sondheim, Etc.: Live At Carnegie Hall; Mandy Patinkin's Mandy Patinkin Sings Sondheim; and Liz Callaway's GRAMMY-nominated To Steve With Love (which includes a great version of a nearly-forgotten comic song from \"Do I Hear A Waltz?\"). Patinkin's deserves special note because his only accompanist is the living musical theater jukebox pianist Paul Ford.\n\nBooks\n\nThe gold standard for books on Sondheim are the ones he wrote himself: the two-volume memoir/book of lyrics Finishing the Hat and Look, I Made a Hat. But if you're not ready for that investment yet, there are other alternatives.\n\nMeryle Seacrest's Stephen Sondheim: A Life is a comprehensive and extremely readable single-volume biography. It manages to reveal some aspects of Sondheim's life without feeling exploitative, and gives tremendous insight into both his work and the personal and professional relationships that informed it.\n\nThere are also a number of excellent books about the process of making individual shows; the two best come from opposite ends of the production spectrum. James Lapine, the book writer and original director of \"Sunday In the Park With George,\" created an oral history of the making of that show called Putting It Together: How Stephen Sondheim And I Created Sunday In The Park With George. All the way on the other side of the power structure, Ted Chapin, a gofer during the rehearsal process for Follies, turned his detailed journal entries into Everything Was Possible: The Birth of the Musical Follies.\n\nOn the more scholarly end, check out Joanne Gordon's Art Isn't Easy: The Achievement of Stephen Sondheim. If you really want to go all the way down the rabbit hole (and have a piano handy to play the musical examples), there's Stephen Banfield's extremely thorough Sondheim's Broadway Musicals.\n\nMovies\n\nTurning a stage musical into a movie can be a tricky business; some of the greatest shows have been turned into middling films. The less said about the movie versions of \"Sweeney Todd\" or \"Into the Woods,\" the better (though it should be noted, in its defense, that Sondheim himself actually liked the former). The movie version of \"A Little Night Music\" is so forgotten that it's basically impossible to find.\n\nBut there are some marvelous Sondheim-related films. Most famous, of course, is West Side Story, the 1961 movie of which was so popular — and acclaimed, winning a whopping 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in 1962 — that it turned a successful but risky Broadway show into an immortal classic. It also inspired several remakes: not just the Oscar-nominated, Spielberg-directed one from 2021, but even a late-'70s Egyptian adaptation. The 1990 movie Dick Tracy contained five Sondheim songs, three of which were sung by Madonna, successfully introducing countless '80s babies to his work.\n\nThe Last of Sheila contains no music, so it's a bit of an oddity here. But Sondheim turned his lifelong obsession with games and puzzles into a fun murder mystery movie, co-written with Anthony Perkins. When you watch this 1973 gem, you might recognize some themes and ideas that would later show up in the Knives Out series, in particular Glass Onion (director/writer Rian Johnson has been very open about this).\n\nSpeaking of Perkins, he is the star of one of Sondheim's great filmed musicals, the disturbing \"Evening Primrose.\" He plays a young poet who sneaks into a department store after hours so that he can have some privacy to write. What he discovers there is funny, heartbreaking, and ultimately horrifying. Think The Twilight Zone with songs written by a genius.\n\nFinally, no mention of Sondheim and movies would be complete without D.A. Pennebaker's 1970 documentary Original Cast Album: \"Company.\" It is, at root, Pennebaker and crew filming the recording of \"Company\"'s cast album. But it's so much more than that. It's about how, as Sondheim once said, \"Art isn't easy,\" and how the actors and musicians are trying — under several very watchful sets of eyes, including the composer/lyricist's — to do the near-impossible in a very limited time. The film has become so iconic that the satirical series Documentary Now! did a hysterical 25-minute-long parody, complete with original songs that are loving send-ups of \"Company\" numbers.\n\nTributes/Anthologies\n\nThis category combines two similar types of projects. First is the tribute concert, where a bunch of notable singers come together on a single night and each do one or a few songs. Then there are anthologies, where a small group of performers put together a show using songs originally meant for other purposes. Sometimes they have plots, and sometimes they're revues.\n\nAmong the best of the latter category is \"Side by Side by Sondheim,\" the 1976 revue in which three English singers strung together an extremely well-chosen and well-sequenced collection of songs. This was the show that really cemented Sondheim's reputation in England, and justly so.\n\nIn the big one-night-only category, 1992's Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall is right up there at the top of the list. The array of talent at that one show is simply unbelievable, and will never be duplicated. Sondheim regulars like Betty Buckley and Bernadette Peters were there, but so were Liza Minelli and Billy Stritch; Patti LuPone; ballet legend Robert LaFosse; Glenn Close; Karen Ziemba; and even the Boys Choir of Harlem, all roped in to perform some of the finest songs in the musical theater canon.\n\nSondheim's 90th birthday celebration is also noteworthy. Because it was in the early days of the pandemic, it was all done remotely. The actual live broadcast was a bit of a mess, with false starts and tech snafus (hey, who knew how to work Zoom in April 2020?). Luckily, Take Me to the World: A Sondheim 90th Birthday Celebration has been edited down and archived on Broadway.com's YouTube page, and is well worth your time.\n\nRevivals/Concert Productions\n\nAnother convenient bridging of categories here. Revivals are versions of shows done after the original production has stopped running. Concert productions are exactly that: people perform all the songs, with minimal (or sometimes no) staging or costumes. The amount of dialogue performed can vary wildly as well.\n\nAmong concert productions, the 1985 New York Philharmonic concert cast recording of \"Follies\" is justly the most well-known. This is in part because, due to budget restrictions, the original cast recording of \"Follies\" doesn't contain most of the show's music. So to finally have a full recording of all the material — performed by a who's who of actors including Mandy Patinkin, Barbara Cook, Lee Remick, George Hearn, Elaine Stritch, Jim Walton, and even the legendary writing team of Comden and Green — well, it's as magnificent as it sounds. There's even a documentary to go along with it.\n\nAnother of the top concert recordings arrived a decade later: the 1995 concert version of \"Anyone Can Whistle.\" Angela Lansbury, who starred in the original Broadway production for all of the nine performances it lasted, comes back as the narrator. Bernadette Peters and Madeline Kahn are absolutely incredible, and have an all-time-great duet in the usually cut song \"There's Always a Woman,\" gloriously restored for this production. If you really want to get deep into \"…Whistle\" (a flop at the time, but a fascinating show), there's also a complete recording released in 2020 that is the closest thing to what you might have experienced in the theater in 1964 — it even restores all the dance music.\n\nRevivals…well, where to start? A good place would be one you can see right now, \"Merrily We Roll Along.\" There is a superb cast recording of the production currently playing on Broadway with Jonathan Groff, Lindsay Mendez, and Daniel Radcliffe.\n\nThere have been a handful of major reimaginings of \"Company\" over the years. The best were a stripped-down version where the cast plays its own instruments, and a gender-swapped one where inveterate bachelor Bobby is portrayed as perpetually single woman Bobbie.\n\nPoints also go to the 2004 Broadway cast recording of \"Assassins,\" and not just because Neil Patrick Harris does such a great job. The whole album captures the project's challenging beauty.\n\nOriginal Cast Recordings\n\nAn original cast album of a Sondheim show will reveal countless treasures if you dig into it. It is often the best way to hear a show, since the actors are the ones who originated the roles, whether it's Ethel Merman as the obsessed stage mother Mama Rose in \"Gypsy\" or Donna Murphy as the tortured Fosca in \"Passion.\"\n\nThe 1970s have a surfeit of treasures. To take a few not yet mentioned, there's \"Sweeney Todd,\" with timeless performances by Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou; and \"A Little Night Music,\" perhaps Sondheim's ultimate example of writing music for character. It's nearly impossible to hear the show's two main female characters as anyone else but the late Glynis Johns as the actress Desiree Armfeldt and Hermione Gingold as her mother.\n\nIf you haven't already heard the original cast recordings of \"Gypsy\" and \"West Side Story,\" do so immediately. Both are iconic pieces of 20th century art. (Music for the former is by Jule Styne, and for the latter by Leonard Bernstein).\n\nProshots\n\nLuckily, productions — many featuring the original casts — of many of Sondheim's shows have been captured on tape, so you can see and hear them in their entirety. They are often referred to as \"proshots,\" a portmanteau of \"professionally shot.\"\n\n\"Pacific Overtures\" works well as an album, but it really comes alive when you can see the gorgeous staging. \"Sweeney Todd\" gains extra comedy and menace in its proshot. There's a New York City Opera version of \"A Little Night Music\" that is masterful. You can't really understand \"Passion\" without seeing Donna Murphy. \"Merrily We Roll Along\"'s complicated story becomes comprehensible when viewing the filmed revival.\n\nBut the most unmissable are two of the 1980s productions. There's \"Sunday In the Park With George,\" a classic meditation on the life of the artist Georges Seurat starring Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette Peters; it was filmed for TV in 1986. Because this is a show largely about a painter and the creation of his most famous painting, actually seeing the show — literally seeing the painting come to life — is essential.\n\nArguably the most important of all, though, is the filmed play that introduced generations of children to Sondheim's work. His fairy tale show \"Into the Woods\" was taped in 1989 (though not aired until 1991), and its frequent TV showings have made it a gateway drug for theatergoers ever since.\n\nThe show is not just a collection of children's tales and songs. It uses the background of those stories to really delve into uncomfortable truths about parents and children, growing up, consequences, and what it really means to be good. Its themes, music, and sophistication, all while still being absolutely appropriate for, and speaking to, children, make it, as scholar Stephen Banfield wrote in 1993, \"Sondheim's finest achievement yet.\"\n\nThat \"yet\" is a lot sadder now than it was when Banfield wrote it. But the show still stands as the epitome of a legendary writer and genius composer — one whose legacy and songs are already proving to live on past his lifetime.\n\nHow Lin-Manuel Miranda Bridged The Worlds Of Broadway & Hip-Hop\n\nLike many of his peers, Charles Esten has known music is his calling since he was a kid. But at 58, he's just now getting the opportunity to do what his contemporaries are long past: release a debut album.\n\nAs fans of the beloved ABC/CMT series \"Nashville\" or the hit Netflix drama \"Outer Banks\" know, Esten first established himself in the acting world. But as his \"Nashville\" role revealed, the actor also had some strong singing chops, too — and it wasn't a coincidence.\n\nDue Jan. 26, Love Ain't Pretty is a testament to both Esten's patience and his passion. Combining his soulful country sound and emotive songwriting, Love Ain't Pretty poignantly captures his years of loving and learning. And with a co-writing credit on all 14 tracks, the album is the purest representation of his artistry possible.\n\n\"Being the age I am, and the difference of what this album is to what maybe my first album would've been if I was 28, is the intentionality,\" he tells GRAMMY.com. \"I can chase what's thoroughly me, and the facets of that. And in the end, that, I think, makes better music anyway.\"\n\nAs the title suggests, Love Ain't Pretty mostly focuses on finding the beauty in life. Along with several odes to his wife, Patty (\"One Good Move,\" \"Candlelight\"), Esten delivers tales of self-reflection (\"A Little Right Now\") and simply enjoying the moment (\"Willing To Try\"), all with a grit that's equal parts inspiring and charming.\n\nPerhaps the most fitting sentiment on the album is \"Make You Happy\" — not because of its lovestruck narrative, but because it captures Esten's goal with Love Ain't Pretty and beyond: \"Wanna make you happy/ Wanna make you smile.\"\n\n\"I know that musical superstardom is not an option,\" he acknowledges. \"I don't even seek it. So, what do I seek instead of perfection? Connection.\"\n\nBelow, Esten recounts his fateful journey to Love Ain't Pretty — from his first taste of stardom to finally fulfilling his lifelong dream.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nAll the way back in third grade, our elementary school had a contest to write the school song. They said, \"Find a Disney song and use the melody and then put new words to it.\" I did it to \"It's a Small World.\" I probably wrote little doodles on my own [before that], but that was the first one with any bit of fame.\n\nI went back, like 10 years later, and they were singing that. They actually made it as part of all the assemblies and everything. That feeling, to hear people singing words that you thought of, I'm sure that was the beginning of this path.\n\nEventually, when I went to college, I was in a band. But, even before I was in a band, my grandmother passed in my sophomore year of college. And, I didn't get back in time to see her. She had helped raise me when I was little, after my parents' divorce, so it hit me hard. I somehow was able to put what she meant to me in a song, and that made a big impact in a lot of ways. Whereas that third grade little ditty made everybody laugh and smile and everything, this made my mother and my aunts and uncles [cry] in a warm, loving way. I could see it affecting them.\n\nI could [also] feel it help me process what I was going through. That was another bit of an aha moment, like, \"Oh wow, writing a song can do that also.\"\n\nRight after that, I started a band. That experience of hearing a band bring your song alive — it was so much more full, this experience, and hearing somebody else add a thing you hadn't thought of, that was another true revelation, the power of that. So I got hooked rather quickly.\n\nHonestly, I probably would've stayed in that world if my band had stayed in that world. They all made the decision to graduate and go be doctors and lawyers and stuff, as the song says. When that finished up, I didn't know what I was going to do next. But, having experienced that made it clear to me that I was not cut out for a desk job — even though I had an economics degree.\n\nI had some friends that had gone to L.A. and started becoming actors. I thought, \"Maybe I'll give that a try.\" But the long and the short of it is, if you had asked me, \"Will you continue in music?\" I'd be like, \"Absolutely. I'm going to go out there and I'm going to meet another bass player and a drummer and another band will come.\"\n\nIt didn't happen. I went to London and played Buddy Holly for two and a half years in the musical \"Buddy.\" When I went back to L.A. after that, then the family started to come, and so the band just never happened. But I had a piano, had guitars — I never stopped writing or playing.\n\nAt one point, I had the thought, \"Well, I might have missed the boat in terms of ever getting to be a performer myself, but I can write songs.\" And by this point, I was really listening to a whole lot of country, '90s country, 2000s and all.\n\nSo, I decided I was going to start writing in a more formalized way, in a more intentional way, instead of just whenever a song came to me. And, as soon as I sort of said that, things started happening.\n\nI met my friend Jane Bach, who is a great Nashville songwriter. She was going back and forth between LA and Nashville at the time. She invited me to sing at the Bluebird [Cafe in Nashville], which I knew very well, and I said yes. And twice, I had to cancel because I got other work. And at a certain point, I literally said to my wife, \"When am I going to get to go to Nashville? That'll never happen.\"\n\n[That] maybe was two or three years before \"Nashville.\" And then I get this script that says, \"Nashville.\" Next thing I know, I'm here and I'm literally doing my first scene in the Bluebird.\n\nI understand, very cleanly, that [\"Nashville\"] opened all these side doors that most people don't have access to. But, I also know that there's a chance they could have all been opened and I could not have been ready.\n\nWhen it finally [happened], for a lot of people, just looking at an actor who's playing a singer/songwriter, I get the feeling that it was a pleasant surprise — I like to think that there was a little more there than they expected. It was actually more authentically who I was than the actor.\n\nI never really quite verbalized this, but the feeling [of landing \"Nashville\"] was one of — it'll make me emotional — completion. I felt like the show was an answer to so many unsolved things in my life. And that's, I think, why we haven't left. And it's also why the album meant so much to me.\n\nIt meant so much to me that I didn't just get here and do an album. I got here at 46. To be that old and not really know who you are as an artist — I never had to define myself. So, I didn't chase that immediately. I just wanted to make music in Music City and make as much as I could.\n\nI always felt behind, because all my contemporaries that had been here, very many of them were already incredibly famous and already had done so much. But you can't [focus on] the road not taken.\n\nI have to admit, there's some part of me that would be like, \"What if you were putting out your first album at 28?\" That's nothing I sort of worry about. I know that it wouldn't have been this. I wouldn't change anything. I have this wife and this family and this career that brought me here. It feels like this was the way it was meant to happen, as strange as it all is.\n\nI felt more prepared than people might expect. And I had something that most people didn't have, which was, Deacon walked in places before I did. Deacon sang at the Bluebird before Charles did. Deacon was at the Grand Ole Opry before I was.\n\nThat began what I would call my 10,000 hours in this town. Between the number of hours I've been able to be on stage at these incredible venues, and play music with these incredible people, and all the singles I was able to put out over the last 10 years, I now feel like that, in some ways, I have as much of a catalog as people that have been here for those 30 years. But, it's still my first album, which I've held onto for something special, and I'm so grateful for the way it turned out. I couldn't be happier.\n\nI knew that I wasn't emptying the whole toolbox to play Deacon. But, having said that, I'm so moved by how much playing that guy influenced my music and my songwriting. A song like \"A Little Right Now,\" it roars at the top and rages a little bit, but in general, that is a Deacon song through and through. \"I'm a farmer praying for rain/ I'm a gambler that needs an ace of spades/ I'm a sailor hoping for a gust of wind/ I'm a singer looking for that song/ I'm a prisoner that ain't got long/ I'm a dreamer waiting for my ship to come in/ But lately all my roads have been running out/ There ain't no silver linings in these clouds/ Help me, Lord, and show me how to find the kind of faith that I once found/ 'Cause I could sure use a little right now.\" When you watch the show, you'll go, \"That's the Deacon-est thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nThere's other songs on this album as well. \"Maybe I'm Alright\" — Deacon's journey was from utterly broken to \"maybe I'm alright.\" As I look at it, he informs this album.\n\nI'm a procrastinator. That's why I released so many singles in 2016, that world record. [Editor's note: Esten released 54 original songs once a week for 54 straight weeks, earning a Guinness World Records title in 2018 for the \"Most consecutive weeks to release an original digital single by a music act.\"]\n\nThat was a mind hack — a life hack — to arbitrarily create deadlines. And, my God, did that work, because I just started putting it out. [After that,] I started thinking about an album, and I even made an early attempt at it, and then COVID hit.\n\nThey felt like songs from a thousand years ago [after the lockdown]. I pretty much scrapped it and didn't use any of them, and said, \"I've just got to do this again in a different way. It's a different me. It's a different world.\"\n\nMy wife is not a procrastinator. And I'll show her, sometimes there's an upside of procrastinating. It's like using a crockpot when there's a microwave right there — it stews in all the ingredients.\n\nDeacon's a major ingredient, but if you just put that major ingredient on it and cook it real quick, it's too pronounced. Stew it in there with all the other ones until it's a new flavor, a new thing in its entirety. And that's what happened.\n\nIt's also interesting that, being the age I am, and the difference of what this album was to what, maybe, my first album would've been if I was 28, is the intentionality in terms of radio success or chart success — or chasing something that might not be thoroughly you, but might be a little more popular than thoroughly you. There's no reason for it at my age, so I can chase what's thoroughly me, and the facets of that. And in the end, that, I think, makes better music anyway.\n\nThere's a video I put out for \"Somewhere in the Sunshine.\" Already, the impact of that song is sort of blowing my mind. The video is full of quotes from people that commented on YouTube about who they lost, and how it's giving them a little moment of peace, and how it's blessing them. That's my radio play. That's my GRAMMY.\n\nI try to always realize how blessed I am to be able to do this. It's so much more precious later in life. I think people sometimes meet me and I have an enthusiasm for it that is younger than my years. And, maybe [that's] just because I've been waiting at a distance so long and it finally came true. I might get jaded someday, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\nThere's still an outsider mentality. I also feel like an anomaly. All the great artist friends I have, I'm not like them. They've been on the radio, they've had cuts, they've had hits. And then, all the new ones starting off doing their first album, I'm not in their group either — they have a whole career and future ahead.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel warm and welcomed in all of those arenas, and in everyone in this town. It always has been unusual for me here. All the reasons I'm here, all the why's, all the how's — but I guess, in the end, that's how I fit, and that's how I belong.\n\nI was blessed that I was able to take my time. I think, once you let go of the outcome, freedom is available. It's just really hard to let go of that outcome. But, as I said, I'm a different beast. What I am means I better let go of that outcome, because the odds of me getting a No. 1 smash off this, they're not great. But the odds of me moving somebody with this music? I think they're pretty good.\n\n2023 In Review: 5 Trends That Defined Country Music\n\nFrom playing sets in pubs to selling out arenas, Lewis Capaldi’s career has grown on a massive scale in recent years — and the journey was all caught on camera.\n\nCapaldi’s life forever changed thanks to his pained ballad \"Someone You Loved,\" which was nominated Song Of The Year at the 2020 GRAMMYs and hit No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK Singles Chart in 2019. Four years after his breakout stardom, the singer is now poised to release his second album ​​Broken by Desire to be Heavenly Sent on May 19.\n\nBefore the album arrives, Capaldi gave an inside look into the process with a new Netflix documentary, Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling. The intimate film takes viewers everywhere from the Scottish star’s childhood home to his late nights in the studio, with an emphasis on mental health struggles as his fame skyrocketed.\n\nBalancing Capaldi's vulnerability with his wryness, the documentary has a lot to say about the acclaimed musician. As it hits Netflix on April 5, take a look at five takeaways from Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling.\n\nLewis Is Proud Of His Scottish Heritage — And Outlook On Life\n\nEarly on in the documentary, Capaldi acknowledges his family and Scottish heritage during a drive through Whitburn, his hometown. He's come to love where he's from, though touring makes it impossible for him to stay at home for long.\n\n\"I do love the fact that I am a Scottish person, and I like the patter that people have,\" he said. \"I do like the mindset of realists everyone just stays on that level of like, 'Let's give this a go and we'll probably f— it up, but we'll have a good time.'\"\n\nThis lighthearted mentality is clear throughout the documentary, which highlights Capaldi's natural comedic talent. Even when Capaldi is struggling with imposter syndrome or anxiety, he manages to find hope in his art and loved ones. Director Jon Pearlman excellently captures Capaldi's personality and self-deprecating demeanor — and of course, all with his thick Scottish accent.\n\nHis Parents Give Him Tough Love\n\n\"It's s—,\" Capaldi's father, Mark, said, agreeing with the singer’s mother, Carol, after Capaldi asked for song feedback. \"You asked me my opinion, so I'll give it to you.\"\n\nThe documentary often frames Capaldi's parents to be big on tough love, unflinchingly sharing their sarcasm or cutting honesty. But their care and pride for their son are heartwarming above all else. Mark drove Capaldi to gigs around town when Capaldi first picked up his guitar, and Carol frequently expresses worry about her son's rising fame: \"I don’t want him to change. I don’t want us to change. It wouldn’t be worth it.\"\n\nHow I'm Feeling shows Capaldi returning home due to the pandemic, capturing his family dynamic on screen (along with clips of the star completing his everyday chores from feeding the dog to folding laundry). The documentary flips through Capaldi's family photo albums, portraying his early interests in music as well as sharing exclusive commentary on how the singer's parents helped him follow his passion.\n\nHis Single 'Bruises' Was A Career Turning Point Before 'Someone You Loved' Existed\n\n\"If only I could hold you, you'd keep my head from going under,\" Capaldi belts across a montage of old concert videos. Shown early on in the documentary, the tender lyric appears to foreshadow his future emotional struggles — but the song is also the impetus for his stardom.\n\nHis crushing 2017 single \"Bruises,\" which Capaldi released independently, was boosted through Spotify's addition of the song to its popular New Music Friday playlist — which quickly helped him get signed to a branch of Universal Music Group in the same year.\n\n\"You see the smile on his face when the crowd sang back,\" his father said in the documentary. \"We knew that's what he was going to do for the rest of his life.\"\n\nThe documentary portrays Capaldi's quick escalation to fame, but it also provides a look into more intimate songwriting sessions the musician has with fellow collaborators such as Dan Nigro, Amy Allen, Nick Atkinson, and Edd Holloway. From voice memos to iPad demos, it's evident Capaldi belongs in the studio and on stage.\n\nHe's Open About His Mental Health And Tourette's\n\nHow I’m Feeling zeroes in on the impact fame has had on Capaldi’s mental health, and details his anxiety pricking up after the global success of \"Someone You Loved\" — especially as he felt the pressure to craft another No. 1 hit.\n\nAmid echoey vocals, shadowy crowds, and whining microphone feedback, the documentary captures the dizzying anxiety Capaldi felt — and sometimes still feels — when confronting his career. The singer opens up about his Tourette syndrome diagnosis, debilitating panic attacks, and fear of death.\n\n\"Is it worth it? Making you feel like this?\" asks his concerned mother at one point in the documentary.\n\nYet, as How I’m Feeling shows, Capaldi has found ways to prioritize his well-being and still continue his musical career. He regularly attends therapy, takes his vitamins, and knows when to take time off; the documentary portrays how this re-energized approach to life allowed him to pour his full passion into Broken by Desire to be Heavenly Sent.\n\nHe Still Doesn't Understand How He’s Famous\n\n\"People started getting their phones out. Why are they all so interested in what we're doing?\" Capaldi queried in a vertical video, recalling a casual night out on the town. \"And then I remember: it's 'cause I'm f—ing famous.\"\n\nAlthough he said the line with his signature wit, How I'm Feeling demonstrates how genuinely easy it is for Capaldi to forget about his celebrity status. On a more personal level, he still struggles to understand why people like him — even with billions of streams and millions of followers.\n\n\"I just don't get it, I don't get why people would turn up and see [me perform], but I'm eternally grateful,\" he said, laughing, \"I love you, but I will never understand you.\"\n\nIn one part of the documentary, Capaldi recalls grabbing beers with Ed Sheeran and chatting about impostor syndrome. A little while later, the singer received an email from Sheeran’s close friend Elton John, who wrote a kind note of encouragement to remind Capaldi: “You write beautiful songs that resonate with millions.”\n\nEven so, Capaldi modestly disregards the power of his \"silly little songs,\" and How I’m Feeling hints that he may always be in that mindset, even if Broken by Desire to be Heavenly Sent proves to be another massive success. Whether he understands the fame or not, Capaldi’s story is a reminder that achieving your dreams may not always be easy — but if you stay true to yourself, you’ll find a way to keep your head above water.\n\nBritish Singer Sam Fender On Getting A (Literal) Taste Of America And Why \"Everyone Needs A F—ing Elton John\""
