        "text": "1 Rocc-O’Clock on MyTalk 107.1 FM. Mondays at 11:30 a.m. on the Donna & Steve Show, production director Rocco Bonello plays short edited clips of songs and challenges the hosts to name the artists who are singing. It’s a competitive 10-minute segment with a simple, entertaining, yet sometimes frustrating concept.\n\n2 Mick Sterling’s Billy Joel tribute show, Chart House. This was an enjoyable night with Mick and his fantastic 13-piece band. Peter Guertin on the piano — using no charts the entire night — was a delight to watch. There were tight renditions of deep cuts and well-known songs. The showstopper, “Goodnight Saigon,” complete with helicopter sound effects, mesmerized the crowd.\n\n3 “My Name Is Barbra” by Barbra Streisand. After 48 hours spread over 11 days of listening to her very detailed audiobook memoir, I couldn’t help but seek out concert footage and other short videos on YouTube. To be able to watch some of the events described in the book — especially the concert from 1967 “A Happening at Central Park” — filled my Barbra quotient. I still plan a movie marathon, starting with 1968′s “Funny Girl.”\n\n1 Vijay Iyer Trio, the Dakota. This inventive and celebrated jazz pianist mixed the melodic with the rhythmic and impressionistic, seemingly locked in with sensational 30-year-old drummer Jeremy Dutton (what a left hand). It was a terrific, enthralling 110 minutes of modern jazz that elicited a genuine (not an obligatory) standing ovation. Only three weeks into the year, Iyer, who had performed at Walker Art Center before, set a high standard for best jazz concert of 2024 in his Dakota debut.\n\n2 Travis Scott’s staging, Xcel Energy Center. It was one of the most imaginative in-the-round stagings I’ve witnessed. The narrow “stage” stretched the entire length of the arena, with a giant boulder theme that suggested something between “Fraggle Rock” and “Land of the Lost,” with the requisite smoke and fire. Not only did the hyper-energetic Scott work the entire stage (which had a series of video screens ringing it overhead) but he brought several fans onstage to give them a ride on a giant rock head that looked a bit like Charlie Brown. Scott called this his Circus Maximus Tour, but Everybody Must Get Stoned Tour would have been more appropriate.\n\n3 Shelby Lynne, the Dakota. Honoring the club owner’s request to do a Dusty Springfield show, the Grammy-winning Alabama singer/songwriter dusted off her 2008 Springfield album “Just a Little Lovin’,” blending the sad and the sultry into a torchy minimalism of Southern soul, topped with her own melancholy “Black Light Blue,” a dark and beautiful stunner from 1999′s “I Am Shelby Lynne.”"
