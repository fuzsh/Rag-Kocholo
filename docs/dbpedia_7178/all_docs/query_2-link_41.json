        "text": "The Montreal-born and New York-based singer, Karine Hannah, had the great honor of being personally invited to sing at Celine Dion’s wedding – a testament to her incredible talent.\n\nAfter moving to New York, she then had the privilege to work with legendary songwriter, Jim Steinman (“Total Eclipse of the Heart”, “Paradise By The Dashboard Light”). Jim once said: “Karine is the best voice I’ve worked with since Céline Dion.”\n\nKarine’s voice hits hard. She can deliver an overpoweringly emotional ballad as well as the best in the biz, and her on stage banter is humorous, bawdy, and electrifying.\n\nHer recording credits include: 2 top 10 billboard charting singles “Burning Up” and “Victory” and an EP released by Cash Money Records/Republic Records/Universal Music.\n\nShe has performed throughout North America, including recent performances in New York City’s Joe’s Pub, 54 Below, City Winery, The Greenroom 42, and promo tours across the US.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Karine developed, recorded and released a “cover” songs project including popular songs from the 70’s forward, reimagining the music in a form that leaves you breathless (including her versions of Van Halen’s “Jump”, Phil Collins’ “Take Me Home”, Hall & Oates “Maneater”).\n\nHer musical palette and vocal capabilities are wide and varied, but her passion for singing and performing the music of Barbra Streisand has been her signature and staple since childhood.\n\nFrom a young age, listening to Barbra Streisand’s music and honing her vocal chops for hours with her beloved mother, set the tone for what was to come for Karine as a recording artist and live performer.\n\nKarine and her fabulous band, Water Colors (a powerhouse group of the top musicians in the world), are excited to play their hearts out and share “Songbird”, and to honor the one and only legendary Barbra Streisand."
