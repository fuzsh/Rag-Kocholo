        "text": "Barbra Streisand will be honored as the 2011 MusiCares Person of the Year on Feb. 11 at a special tribute performance and dinner in Los Angeles, recognizing her accomplishments as an artist and humanitarian. MusiCares' mission is to ensure that music people have a compassionate place to turn in times of need while focusing the resources and attention of the music industry on human service issues that directly impact the health and welfare of the music community. Watch Person of the Year arrivals and other highlights Friday, Feb. 11 at GRAMMY Live.\n\nBarbra Streisand has a history of making a big splash her first time out.\n\nShe received a Tony nomination for her first Broadway show, \"I Can Get It For You Wholesale.\" She won two GRAMMYs, including Album Of The Year for her first LP, The Barbra Streisand Album. She won an Emmy for her first TV special, \"My Name Is Barbra.\" She won an Academy Award for her first movie, Funny Girl.\n\nAnd she did all that before her 27th birthday.\n\nFortunately for all of us, Streisand didn't rest on her laurels. She kept going, and kept adding to her list of firsts. She won another Oscar for the first song she composed for a movie, \"Love Theme From A Star Is Born (Evergreen).\" She won two Golden Globes for the first film she directed, Yentl.\n\nAt last count, Streisand has won eight GRAMMYs, four Emmys, two Oscars, and a special Tony. She has received (to name a few) the GRAMMY Legend Award, the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of Arts, and France's Legion d'honneur.\n\nStreisand has made a big impact on both movies and music. She's one of only two artists to have received both a Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute and a Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award. The other? Fred Astaire.\n\nIn both of these fields, Streisand has shown exceptional versatility. She has starred in musicals, comedies and dramas. Her hit songs range from the timeless \"People\" (one of the classiest signature songs associated with any performer) to the trendy disco romp \"The Main Event/Fight.\" She has received GRAMMY nominations in the Pop, Traditional Pop and Classical Fields (the latter for her 1976 album Classical Barbra).\n\nStreisand has been the first female to achieve many feats. With \"Evergreen\" in 1976, she became the first female composer to win an Academy Award for best song. With Yentl in 1983, she became the first woman to produce, direct, write, and star in a major motion picture.\n\nStreisand has long been a GRAMMY record setter. She was just 22 when The Barbra Streisand Album was named Album Of The Year, which made her the youngest winner in that category (a distinction she held for more than three decades). Streisand has amassed six nominations for Album Of The Year and five for Record Of The Year. In both cases, that's more than any other female artist in history.\n\nStreisand's philanthropic activities are just as impressive. She founded the Streisand Foundation in 1986 and has since gifted it with nearly $25 million. The foundation has made nearly 1,000 grants to nonprofit organizations that focus on protecting the environment, advocating for civil rights, promoting democratic values, advancing world peace, educating at-risk children, and providing funds for research and education in the field of women's health.\n\nRecent gifts include $5 million to endow the Barbra Streisand Women's Cardiovascular Research and Education Program at Cedars-Sinai's Women's Heart Center, and the lead gift of $1 million to establish the William J. Clinton Foundation's Clinton Climate Initiative.\n\nStreisand and actor James Brolin were married in July 1998. Streisand also has a son, Jason Gould, from her first marriage to Elliott Gould.\n\nStreisand has been especially busy in the last couple of years. Her book, My Passion For Design, combining reflections on her life with her love of design and architecture, was published by Viking on Nov. 16, 2010. Her 18th movie as an actress, Little Fockers, was released on Dec. 22.\n\nAnd this year, her latest studio album, Love Is The Answer, is nominated for a GRAMMY for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. It's her eighth nomination in that category, and her 41st overall.\n\nI did a little research, and you and Fred Astaire are the only two artists to receive both the Life Achievement Award from the AFI and The Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nYou're kidding. I love that. I admired him so. I didn't know that.\n\nDid you ever meet him?\n\nI did. I actually have a picture with him somewhere. It was taken at some awards ceremony that we were both at.\n\nYou have a track record of making a big impact your first time out. Is the initial challenge what drives you? To prove to yourself that you can do something, more than to do it over and over?\n\nThat becomes boring to me, like singing the same songs over and over. It is sort of boring to stay in the same spot. You know, I didn't set out to become the first to do this, the first to do that. It was just that my interests were so diversified. What's that famous saying about how one's reach should exceed one's grasp?\n\nFrom the start, you had a defiant streak. You didn't want to sing standards in your early nightclub appearances or have guest stars on your TV specials.\n\nPeople would say, \"Well, she should shorten her nose\" or \"Change her name to something simpler.\" I didn't know the rules, so I just did what I thought was right.\n\nIs a certain amount of defiance part of being a great artist?\n\nI would think so. I guess if you have an original take on life, or something about you is original, you don't have to study people who came before you. You don't have to mimic anybody. You just have a gut feeling inside, an instinct that tells you what's right for you, and you can't do it in any other way. It would be defying who you are in a sense. So I always questioned everything that I saw. I started going to acting school when I was 14, and I would always have my own take on things. Once, I wanted to play Juliet and I had a total concept for her that was what I thought would be right for a 14-year-old girl, but I was so embarrassed that it wouldn't be good. You see, it's the combination of the doubt and the confidence.\n\nHow do you mean?\n\nYou can't have one without the other. It's not just confidence. It's enormous insecurity as well. It's the combination of the insecurity and the confidence that I think maybe makes someone special.\n\nIn the '60s, you stood apart from the contemporary pop/rock scene. Did you want to be on pop radio and be part of the contemporary scene? I know the record company wanted it, but did you want it too?\n\nWell, I didn't care about it. I did my thing and the Beatles did their thing. I was listening to Johnny Mathis when rock and roll started. I thought he was the bee's knees. That's what I love about the GRAMMYs and the music industry. People can respect other performers. There's not as much jealousy, put it that way, as in the movie business. In the movie business they say, \"Oh, I could have played that role.\" In the music business, we all do different things, but we sit there and admire other people who can write a song differently or sing differently. It's not so competitive. Anyway, it wasn't like I needed to be in rock and roll. I was pushed into doing certain songs like \"Stoney End.\" Or remember that song \"Woman In Love\" [from Guilty]? I think it was my biggest single and I never performed it live.\n\nBecause?\n\nI never agreed with the philosophy — that \"I am a woman in love and I'll do anything for my man\" kind of thing. I felt funny. It was fine on a record, but I didn't want to perform this song [in concert].\n\nHow do you feel about your hits from the '70s and '80s now? Are you glad you recorded them or do you wish you'd said no a little more often and stayed with the music you know best, and I think like best?\n\nIt was interesting to try. That's why I wanted to do the classical album, because I love classical music. So I thought, \"Let me try this.\" As a matter of fact, I had written on the album cover, \"It's a work in progress,\" but the record company didn't want me to say that. They said, \"Don't apologize for it.\" I always felt that I could have made it better, but I had to release it at the time. But I don't regret things I did. No.\n\nIt sounds like you're glad you made those records when you made them and you're glad you came back to traditional pop when you did.\n\nExactly.\n\nWhen Just For The Record… came out in 1991, it looked like kind of a career capstone. Since then, you've recorded six more studio albums. Did you expect to stay this active after the box set?\n\nOh yeah, sure. I love recording. I love anything private. I love the privacy of just me and the music. Not performing, not in front of anybody. Not waiting for applause. I don't like performing very much.\n\nThat's surprising because you've toured so much in the last 17 years.\n\nI didn't sing and charge for more than 20 years until I went back in 1993. And even then, I wouldn't commit to a tour until I saw how I liked it.\n\nHow did you like it?\n\nUm, I liked it, sort of. Not enough to do what my friend Diana Krall does and play 300 days out of the year. I don't enjoy it like that. The most I could do was 24 shows [per tour]. The last tour was great, the European tour, because I was buying things for my house. I sang every five or six days so I could shop. It was a flea market tour.\n\nI had assumed that you had come to enjoy performing live, but I'm starting to think that a key reason for all the touring you've done since 1993 is to fund your charity work.\n\nThat's the key reason. In order to do really good things in the world and give away money that will support organizations that I believe in, you have to raise a lot of money. [Because of taxes,] in order for me to be able to give $5 million to start the Women's Cardiovascular Research and Education Program at Cedars-Sinai, I have to earn $10 million.\n\nSome people reading this may wonder why you specified women's cardiovascular research and education. Do you want to explain that?\n\nYeah. We're 50 years behind in research because there was no research done on women. The research was done on men. Men and women are very different in terms of their hearts. They have different symptoms, even. Where you may think of heart disease as a man's disease, now more women than men die of heart disease. More women die of heart disease than all cancers combined. Isn't that amazing? So we want to educate women in terms of talking to their doctors; understanding the warning signs. I'm going to make a PSA about this.\n\nWhat led you to set up your foundation in 1986?\n\nThat was about Chernobyl and the fire they couldn't put out. It really scared me as to how fragile the planet is, and the radioactivity going in the air and getting into the soil. Climate change started to interest me. I was for nuclear disarmament. That's when I decided to start my foundation and give away the proceeds from that concert [One Voice].\n\nIn a 1995 speech at Harvard, you explained your feelings about the rights and obligations of artists to participate in the political process. I understand how it's an artist's right, but what did you mean when you said \"obligation\"?\n\nIt's just that we have a big responsibility because people look to celebrities and sort of take to heart what they say. So they have to be informed. They have to read. They have to do research.\n\nHave you ever worried about a backlash if you were too outspoken?\n\nNo, I never did, obviously. Because if I did, I wouldn't say so many things. I don't think that way. I don't care. If some people don't buy my records because they don't like my politics, so be it.\n\nAfter Sept. 11, you had a post on your website that you were going to refrain from criticizing President Bush.\n\nThat wasn't the time. It's like going and meeting George [W.] Bush at the Kennedy Center Honors [in December 2008]. People were waiting to see us come together, and I said, \"This night, art transcends politics.\" So you have to approach it differently. That wouldn't have been the proper or appropriate time to blast him for going into the Iraq war. There's a time and a place for things.\n\nIn the '90s, there was talk in the media about Sen. Streisand….\n\nRead Part Two\n\n(Paul Grein is a veteran music journalist who writes the weekly Chart Watch blog for Yahoo.com. He has written extensively about music for Billboard and the Los Angeles Times. He has covered the GRAMMYs since the late '70s. He attended the show for the first time in 1977 and still remembers the sense of excitement in the Hollywood Palladium when Barbra Streisand stepped onstage to present the award for Record Of The Year.)\n\nIdol continues to reckon with his demons — they both grappled with addiction during the '80s — and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.)\n\nAlthough Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s — the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") — their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history.\n\nWhile there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens.\n\nSteve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different.\n\nYeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up.\n\nThen when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically.\n\n\"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that?\n\nWe really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds.\n\nWe always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick.\n\nI listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it’s a challenge to reach people with new songs?\n\nObviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We’ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol.\n\nYou want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we’re managing to do both in a way.\n\n**Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you’re talking about freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore?**\n\nI mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier.\n\nI had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There’s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff.\n\nSo a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we’re enjoying what we do and excited about it.\n\n[When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don’t know how he’s doing it, but it’s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now.\n\nI think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you.\n\nI remember when you went on \"Viva La Bam\" back in 2005 and decided to give Bam Margera’s Lamborghini a new sunroof by taking a power saw to it. Did he own that car? Was that a rental?\n\nI think it was his car.\n\nDid he get over it later on?\n\nHe loved it. [Laughs] He’s got a wacky sense of humor. He’s fantastic, actually. I’m really sorry to see what he's been going through just lately. He's going through a lot, and I wish him the best. He's a fantastic person, and it's a shame that he's struggling so much with his addictions. I know what it's like. It's not easy.\n\nMusically, what is the synergy like with you guys during the past 10 years, doing Kings and Queens of the Underground and this new stuff? What is your working relationship like now in this more sober, older, mature version of you two as opposed to what it was like back in the '80s?\n\nIn lots of ways it’s not so different because we always wrote the songs together, we always talked about what we're going to do together. It was just that we were getting high at the same time.We're just not getting [that way now] but we're doing all the same things.\n\nWe're still talking about things, still [planning] things:What are we going to do next? How are we going to find new people to work with? We want to find new producers. Let's be a little bit more timely about putting stuff out.That part of our relationship is the same, you know what I mean? That never got affected. We just happened to be overloading in the '80s.\n\nThe relationship’s… matured and it's carrying on being fruitful, and I think that's pretty amazing. Really, most people don't get to this place. Usually, they hate each other by now. [Laughs] We also give each other space. We're not stopping each other doing things outside of what we’re working on together. All of that enables us to carry on working together. I love and admire him. I respect him. He's been fantastic. I mean, just standing there on stage with him is always a treat. And he’s got an immensely great sense of humor. I think that's another reason why we can hang together after all this time because we've got the sense of humor to enable us to go forward.\n\nThere's a lot of fan reaction videos online, and I noticed a lot of younger women like \"Rebel Yell\" because, unlike a lot of other '80s alpha male rock tunes, you're talking about satisfying your lover.\n\nIt was about my girlfriend at the time, Perri Lister. It was about how great I thought she was, how much I was in love with her, and how great women are, how powerful they are.\n\nIt was a bit of a feminist anthem in a weird way. It was all about how relationships can free you and add a lot to your life. It was a cry of love, nothing to do with the Civil War or anything like that. Perri was a big part of my life, a big part of being Billy Idol. I wanted to write about it. I'm glad that's the effect.\n\nIs there something you hope people get out of the songs you've been doing over the last 10 years? Do you find yourself putting out a message that keeps repeating?\n\nWell, I suppose, if anything, is that you can come to terms with your life, you can keep a hold of it. You can work your dreams into reality in a way and, look, a million years later, still be enjoying it.\n\nThe only reason I'm singing about getting out of the cage is because I kicked out of the cage years ago. I joined Generation X when I said to my parents, \"I'm leaving university, and I'm joining a punk rock group.\" And they didn't even know what a punk rock group was. Years ago, I’d write things for myself that put me on this path, so that maybe in 2022 I could sing something like \"Cage\" and be owning this territory and really having a good time. This is the life I wanted.\n\nThe original UK punk movement challenged societal norms. Despite all the craziness going on throughout the world, it seems like a lot of modern rock bands are afraid to do what you guys were doing. Do you think we'll see a shift in that?\n\nYeah. Art usually reacts to things, so I would think eventually there will be a massive reaction to the pop music that’s taken over — the middle of the road music, and then this kind of right wing politics. There will be a massive reaction if there's not already one. I don’t know where it will come from exactly. You never know who's gonna do [it].\n\nLiving Legends: Nancy Sinatra Reflects On Creating \"Power And Magic\" In Studio, Developing A Legacy Beyond \"Boots\" & The Pop Stars She Wants To Work With"
