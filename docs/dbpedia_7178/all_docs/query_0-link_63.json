Performing with his friend Johnny Depp, Beck ran through a setlist of fan favorites and covers. The guitar virtuoso made every song his own, with razor-sharp precision, an elegant tone, and a spellbinding touch. Little did anyone in attendance know that the concert would be Beck's last. After a short battle with bacterial meningitis, Jeff Beck has passed away at the age of\n\nThe Sweetest Punch: \"The Songs of Bacharach and Costello\" Box Celebrates \"Painted from Memory,\" More\n\nElvis Costello has sung jazz with The Charles Mingus Orchestra and pianist Marian McParland, explored hip-hop textures with The Roots, recorded with classical artists The Brodsky Quartet and Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter, penned an album with R&B titan Allen Toussaint, and written and recorded with Paul McCartney. Yet of his many rich, felicitous collaborations, the most celebrated may well be with legendary composer Burt Bacharach. Now, that partnership which has spanned over\n\nThe Year In Review: The 2022 Gold Bonus Disc Awards, From A to Z - Part One\n\nHappy 2023! Welcome, friends, to The Second Disc's 13th Annual Gold Bonus Disc Awards! A lot has happened in the last twelve months, but as we look to a new year with optimism and a hopeful spirit, we recognize the many roles music has played in our lives. With that spirit in mind, The Second Disc wishes to recognize 2022's cream of the catalogue music crop - those exemplary reissues and box sets, big and small, that proved to be truly outstanding for music lovers worldwide. Despite the\n\nHoliday Gift Guide Review: Vince Guaraldi, 'A Charlie Brown Christmas (Super Deluxe Edition)'\n\nIf you've followed catalogue releases for long enough, you know some titles just do so well that you don't necessarily have to go out of your way to get people - especially new fans - to buy a new version of a classic album. Buyers - especially vinyl buyers - will always come of age and need copies of Rumours or Dark Side of the Moon in their libraries. It's this sort of thinking - perhaps a rebellion against the commercialism of reissue practices - that often gets us most interested not in the\n\nMo' Onions: Booker T. and The MG's \"Green Onions\" Returns in February\n\nA little more than sixty years ago, Booker T. and The MG's tasty serving of \"Green Onions\" became one of the summer's biggest dishes. The largely improvised 12-bar blues entered the Billboard Hot 100 on August 11, 1962 and peaked at No. 3 the week ending September 29. It also made it all the way to the top of the R&B Singles Chart, peaking there on four non-consecutive weeks. On February 24, Rhino will reissue Booker T. and The MG's Green Onions album on both CD and translucent \"green\n\nWhat a Surprise: Neil Sedaka Reissues His Four Elektra Albums on New 2-CD Set\n\nSedaka's Back was no understatement. Neil Sedaka's 1974 LP - in actuality, a compilation of tracks from his previous three albums issued only in the U.K. - yielded a No. 1 Pop and AC hit with the sparkling \"Laughter in the Rain,\" earning the artist his first chart-topper since 1962. It also spun off another No. 1 AC with \"The Immigrant,\" and a top ten AC/top thirty Pop hit with \"That's When the Music Takes Me.\" That wasn't all; the album also contained the future standards \"Solitaire\" and\n\nHoliday Gift Guide Review: Joni Mitchell, \"The Asylum Albums (1972-1975)\"\n\n2022 has been Joni Mitchell's year. Following a triumphant surprise appearance in July at the Newport Folk Festival, the singer-songwriter announced a return to the stage for a full-length Joni Jam in June 2023 at Washington's Gorge Amphitheatre; tickets were quickly snapped up by ardent fans who had waited roughly two decades to see Mitchell in concert once again. More recently, she attended her first-ever Broadway musical, Cameron Crowe and Tom Kitt's Almost Famous - and made her Broadway\n\nIn Memoriam: Christine McVie (1943-2022)\n\nMany words have already been typed to memorialize Christine McVie, the stalwart Fleetwood Mac singer/songwriter/keyboardist who died November 30 after a brief illness. But really, it was right there in the name all along: before that fateful marriage to John McVie, she was born Christine Perfect. How she'd live up to that name over time. McVie, a founding member of the British blues band Chicken Shack, joined her bass-playing husband in Fleetwood Mac in 1970, a year after they were wed.\n\nHoliday Gift Guide Review: Michael Jackson, 'Thriller 40'\n\nWe are more than 35 years into the practice of record labels utilizing compact discs to sell a venerated artist's catalogue while also telling a story through the format's expanded capacity and clarion sound capabilities. The one-two punch of Bob Dylan's Biograph (1985) and Eric Clapton's Crossroads (1988) helped legitimize the idea of the CD box set and put both artists' bodies of work in sharper focus at a time when both of them were, should we say, not as relevant to the cultural\n\nDancing in the Moonlight: Thin Lizzy's Major Live Works Getting Reissued\n\nFor all the great songs Thin Lizzy cut in the studio like \"The Boys Are Back in Town,\" \"Jailbreak,\" \"Dancing in the Moonlight,\" \"Waiting for An Alibi\" and \"Killer on the Loose,\" the Irish rockers really did shine as a live unit. At the top of 2023, Universal's U.K. label UMC will truly show fans how with an expanded box set and sought after CD reissue of the two live albums they released during the lifetime of frontman/bassist Phil Lynott. 1978's Live and Dangerous was the culmination of two\n\nThe Second Disc's Guide to Black Friday Record Store Day 2022: Our Essential Picks\n\nFrom all of us here at Second Disc HQ to all of you, we hope you've enjoyed a wonderful Thanksgiving in the company of beloved family and friends. Of course, from this day which conjures nostalgic and warm feelings comes a celebration of a different kind with this year's annual Black Friday Record Store Day event. In keeping with tradition, Mike, Randy, and Joe have once again selected some essential picks of the roughly 200 titles being released tomorrow at independent record stores\n\nGive Me the News: Edsel Preps New Box Set of Robert Palmer Classics\n\nFor as long as CD reissues have been a thing, Robert Palmer's catalogue has been crying out for some real respect. The late blue-eyed soul singer, only 54 when a heart attack ended his life in 2003, has been in real need of rediscovery - and efforts to rebuild his discography for the modern age are few and far between. Next year, U.K. label Edsel will throw their hat in the ring (again) with a deluxe box set of his most famous work. The Island Records Years is an in-depth look at the first\n\nSending You Forget-Me-Nots: Patrice Rushen's Elektra Discography Gets Its Own Box Set\n\nJazz-turned R&B singer Patrice Rushen met with commercial and artistic success when she signed with Elektra Records. Now, Strut Records has revisited all five of her albums for the label plus an array of bonus tracks on the new 5-CD box set Feels So Real: The Complete Elektra Recordings 1978-1984. After a trio of acclaimed (but modest-selling) fusion-influenced albums for Prestige Records in the mid-1970s, Rushen, an accomplished pianist/vocalist, joined the Elektra roster in 1978.\n\nAn Interview with Scott Davies, Rubellan Remasters' One-Man Band\n\nScott Davies has learned a lot on the job. Once toiling in the business of IT, music fans now know him as the singular creative force behind Rubellan Remasters - the sole curator, engineer, designer and distributor of a handful of CDs covering respected catalogues by New Wave/alternative acts including Visage, Missing Persons, Divinyls and most recently Oingo Boingo, the alt-rock band led in the '80s and '90s by future film composer Danny Elfman. From 2021 to the present Rubellan remastered\n\nThe Weekend Stream: November 5, 2022\n\nWelcome to The Weekend Stream, a relaxing weekly review of notable digital-only catalogue titles.

Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus\n\nRight as the Rain: Barbra Streisand's \"Live at the Bon Soir\" Arrives in November\n\nBarbra Streisand first took the stage of New York's tiny Bon Soir on September 9, 1960. The eighteen-year-old singer appeared third on a bill after house band The Three Flames and comic duo Tony and Eddie, and before closing act Phyllis Diller. The groundbreaking comedienne later recalled her first encounter with Streisand: \"We shared a dressing room at the Bon Soir...It was the size of a peapod and usually you could smell fear in there. But she wasn't a bit nervous - at least not that I\n\nHeartbreakers Beach Party: Tom Petty's \"Fillmore 1997\" Features Hits, Deep Cuts, Covers\n\nThe Estate of Tom Petty has announced the late rock-and-roller's first live album in more than a decade. Live at the Fillmore 1997 captures highlights from Petty and the Heartbreakers' blazing 20-show run as recorded at San Francisco's venerable Fillmore between January 10 and February 7, 1997. Six full shows were captured live, from which 58 songs have been culled for this release. Making this an even more special affair, 35 of the songs are covers and most unique to the Petty discography.\n\nThe Second Disc Guesses the 'Thriller 40' Track List\n\nIt's hard to know what a Michael Jackson event release looks like today. For one, the King of Pop is very much dead; for another, November's impending release of Thriller 40 is the third reissue of the bestselling album. Are the vaults empty? Is the estate stingy? (This is, after all, the same Jackson estate that bizarrely changed the font on the cover, got very defensive about it, yet changed it again, with a new slipcase. Also, the upcoming Mobile Fidelity vinyl edition may have gotten the\n\nThe Weekend Stream Labor Day Special: Spotlight on WIWS Radio with John and Chrissy Sellards\n\nWelcome to a special edition of The Weekend Stream for the long Labor Day weekend!
