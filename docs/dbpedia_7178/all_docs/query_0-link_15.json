From powerful head voices to flawless harmonies, their talent is beyond question, and I would dream of singing half as well as them.\n\nRegardless of voice type, one thing that makes a singer stand out is when they hit those high notes.\n\nThese high notes can give you chills and are incredibly impressive. However, not every singer can hit these notes; there's more to it than occasionally hitting the high notes. You have to consistently hit them without straining your vocal cords too much, especially if you're expected to do it night after night on tour or in the recording studio. This is where the concept of vocal range comes into play.\n\nThe best Singing tutors available\n\n5 (32 reviews)\n\nValerio\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (32 reviews)\n\nJessica\n\n£52\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nSally\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (63 reviews)\n\nAlena\n\n£45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (45 reviews)\n\nLola\n\n£45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nMatthew\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (29 reviews)\n\nJoshua\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nBeatrice\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (32 reviews)\n\nValerio\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (32 reviews)\n\nJessica\n\n£52\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nSally\n\n£35\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (63 reviews)\n\nAlena\n\n£45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (45 reviews)\n\nLola\n\n£45\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (30 reviews)\n\nMatthew\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (29 reviews)\n\nJoshua\n\n£60\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\n5 (34 reviews)\n\nBeatrice\n\n£50\n\n/h\n\n1st lesson free!\n\nLet's go\n\nWhat is Vocal Range?\n\nIn the context of singing, vocal range serves as a defining characteristic for classifying voices into specific types.

Riperton sadly died of breast cancer in 1979 at the age of 31.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nRemember when we were talking about the whistle register earlier?\n\nMuch like Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande can also effectively use this type of voice.

Vitas, who was already using his name as a pseudonym, began performing in nightclubs. He began his career paying tribute to Michael Jackson but has also performed parodies and his own songs.\n\nHis breakthrough came when Vitas and his girlfriend filmed a video clip for \"Opera #2\", in which Vitas plays an eccentric lone man with fish gills, who lives in a bathtub with fish jars and plays the accordion naked.
