        "text": "About the artists:\n\nMezzo-soprano Laurie Rubin has performed a number of operatic roles, including that of the voice/witch in Lisa Bielawaâs episodic opera written for broadcast, Elle in Poulencâs La Voix Humaine, and the role of Anne in the world premiere of Nadia Boulangerâs La Ville Morte in 2021. Other recent career highlights include two concerts at the Ravinia Festival, including a duet recital with Frederica Von Stade, the world premiere of Centuries in the Hours by Lisa Bielawa with the River Oaks Chamber Orchestra, and the West Coast premiere of Do You Dream in Color by Bruce Adolphe, setting poetry by Laurie, with the LA Chamber Orchestra.Â\n\nIn 2012, Laurieâs memoir, Do You Dream in Color? Insights from a Girl Without Sight, she looks back on her life as an international opera singer who happens to be blind. From her loneliness and isolation as a middle school student to her experiences skiing, Rubin offers her young readers a life-story rich in detail and inspiration drawn from everyday challenges. Beginning with her childhood in California, Rubin tells the story of her life and the amazing experiences that led her to a career as an internationally celebrated mezzo-soprano.\n\nLaurie, who grew up in Encino, California, is also co-founder and co-artistic director of Ohana Arts, a performing arts organization on Oahu which serves over 100 students, ages 6-18. She is thrilled and honored to be performing with Chamber Music Hawaii.\n\nPianist Jonathan Korth enjoys a multifaceted career as a soloist, chamber musician, collaborator, and teacher, having performed recitals across North America, Europe, and East Asia to critical acclaim. Recent concert activities include performances in Bangkok, Beijing, Brussels, London, Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo, as well as on the US mainland at Carnegie Hall's Weill Hall, Washington DCâs Phillips Collection, and Chicago's Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concert Series. Mr. Korth performs regularly in and around his home of Honolulu where he is a piano professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, as well on the neighbor islands.Â\n\nChamber Music Hawai`i coined the word Tresemble to describe its combined ensemble of mixed instrumentation drawing from all three of its resident chamber music ensembles. Tresemble concerts can include great pieces of music that do not fit into one of the typical chamber music categories. It also can bring in guest musicians, such as pianists, harpists, or vocalists to perform this often neglected repertoire.\n\nProgram Notes:\n\nThe Shepherd on the Rock\n\nSchubert and Beethoven, who died within a year of each other, are seen as the bridge between the classical and romantic periods of music. While Schubert wrote as many symphonies as Beethoven, the prolific composer may be best remembered for his more than 600 songs. Most are for voice and piano, however, there are several for voice with two or more instruments. The Shepherd on the Rock, written in 1828, shortly before Schubert's death, for voice, clarinet, and piano, is one of the most loved of these.\n\nOf the seven verses, the first four and the last are set to poetry by Wilhelm MÃ¼ller, while verses five and six were written by Karl August Varnhagen von Ense. The work was written in response to a request from a friend, the operatic soprano Pauline Anna Milder-Hauptmann, as a piece to express a wide range of feeling to be performed before a large audience rather than a salon typical for art songs. It was not published until a year and a half after Schubert's death, and the singer sang it for the first in Riga, Estonia in 1830.Â\n\nThe voice and clarinet are full partners. The first four verses are in a major key reflecting warmth of sound, as the lonely shepherd, high on the mountaintop, listens to the echoes rising from below. The fifth and sixth verses are in a minor key, as the shepherd expresses grief and loneliness. The conclusion opens with the clarinet in sprightly trills, as the shepherd anticipates the coming of spring and rebirth in a joyful ending.\n\nText\n\nWhen I stand on the highest rock, look down into the deep valley and sing.\n\nThe echo from the ravines rises up from the dark depths of the distant valley.\n\nThe further my voice carries, the clearer it echoes back to me from below.\n\nMy sweetheart dwells so far from me, and thus I long so ardently for her.\n\nI am consumed by deep sorrow; my joy has gone, my hope on this earth has vanished; I am so alone here.\n\nSo fervently the song resounded through the forest, so fervently it resounded through the night; it drew hearts heavenwards with its wondrous power.\n\nSpring will come, spring, my delight; now I shall prepare to go a-wandering.\n\nPrÃ©lude, RÃ©citatif et Variations\n\nMaurice DuruflÃ© was a French composer, organist and teacher, who was little known in his lifetime but has won many admirers in recent years. Despite winning several prizes for composition while in his twenties, he published only 14 works during his life and often continued to edit and change pieces after publication. He is best known for his Requiem and a handful of short organ and choral pieces composed for church performances. The PrÃ©lude RÃ©citatif et Variations is a rarely-heard gem of tremendous grace and beauty. His only composition for an instrumental ensemble, the piece is memorable for its dialogue between viola and flute, with contrasting moods of hope in the latter and sadness in the former.Â DuruflÃ© composed it prior to his lifetime appointment as organist at St. Etienne du Mont and prior to his obtaining a teaching position at the Paris Conservatory.\n\nPerpÃ©tuelle\n\nComposer Ernest Chausson created only a small body of music, but was highly respected by his contemporary French composers. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire after obtaining a doctorate in law. He subsequently visited Munich and Bayreuth, where he was present at the 1882 premiere of Wagnerâs opera Parsifal. Wagner's influence is noticeable in the rich texture of much of his work.Â\n\nThe composer's last completed work, the Chanson PerpÃ©tuelle, is best known as an orchestral work, but the composer also created the version for soprano, piano, and string quartet played in this concert. The text, a poem by Charles Cros, describes the suffering of an abandoned woman as she contemplates drowning in a pond, among the flowers, and under the \"sleeping water\". The sustained vocal line over more active instrumental writing creates much of the tension.\n\nChausson died in a bicycle accident about six months after the premiere of this composition in 1899. The score was not published until 1911.\n\nQuivering woods, starry sky, my beloved has gone away carrying off my desolate heart!\n\nWinds, may your plaintive noises, charming nightingales, may your songs tell him Iâm dying!Â\n\nFrom the first evening he came here my soul was at his mercy. I no longer cared about pride.\n\nMy eyes were full of love He took me in his nervous arms and kissed me on my brow. I was seized by a great trembling; and then, I no longer know how, he became my lover.Â\n\nI kept saying: âLove me for as long as youâre able!â I would sleep well only in his arms But he, feeling his heart grown cold, departed some mornings ago without me, for a distant land.Â\n\nSince I have my lover no longer I shall die in the pond, among the flowers, under the still water. Pausing on the edge, I will speak his name to the wind, while dreaming that I often awaited him there. And as if in a golden shroud.\n\nAs It Fell Upon a Day\n\nAaron Copland was a composer, composition teacher, and writer, as well as a conductor of his own and other American music. He studied piano and composition for some years with Nadia Boulanger, the Parisian composition teacher who was mentor and muse to the most successful composers of the early 20th century. Copland created music that has a distinctive blend of classical, folk, and jazz idioms, and was referred to by peers and critics as \"the Dean of American Composers.âÂ\n\nOne of Copland's composition assignments by Boulanger was to compose a piece for flute and clarinet. He came upon a poem by the 17th century English poet Richard Barnefield and decided to add a voice part to the assignment. He explained: \"The poem had the simplicity and tenderness that moved me to attempt to evoke that poignant expression musicallyâ¦The imitative counterpoint between the two instruments in the introduction would satisfy my teacherâs request. The harmonies that seem to evoke an early English flavor were suggested by the nature of the text.âÂ\n\nThe poem tells the story of a spring celebration and the lament of a nightingale, representing a king's daughter who had been raped. She was transformed into a nightingale, but continued her accusing cries. Ultimately, the poet sympathizes with the nightingale as all of the other birds cheerfully sing, oblivious to her cries.\n\nAs it fell upon a day\n\nIn the merry month of May,\n\nSitting in a pleasant shade\n\nWhich a grove of myrtles made,\n\nBeasts did leap and birds did sing,\n\nTrees did grow and plants did spring;\n\nEverything did banish moan\n\nSave the Nightingale alone:\n\nShe, poor bird as all forlorn\n\nLeaned her breast up-till a thorn,\n\nAnd there sung the dolefullâst ditty,\n\nThat to hear it was great pity.\n\nFie, fie, fie! now would she cry;\n\nTereu, Tereu! by and by;\n\nThat to hear her so complain\n\nScarce I could from tears refrain;\n\nFor her griefs so lively shown\n\nMade me think upon mine own.\n\nAh! thought I, thou mournâst in vain,\n\nNone takes pity on thy pain:\n\nSenseless trees they cannot hear thee,\n\nRuthless beasts they will not cheer thee:\n\nKing Pandion he is dead,\n\nAll thy friends are lappâd in lead;\n\nAll thy fellow birds do sing\n\nCareless of thy sorrowing:\n\nEven so, poor bird, like thee,\n\nNone alive will pity me.\n\nVocaliseÂ\n\nRachmaninovâs Vocalise was originally written for voice and orchestra as the final piece in his âFourteen Songs,â Op. 34. It can be sung to any vowel the singer chooses. It was written in 1915 for the coloratura soprano Antonina Nezhdanova, a star of the Moscow Grand Opera. When she objected to the lack of a poetic text, the composer gallantly replied: âWhat need is there of words, when you will be able to convey everything better and more expressively than anyone could with words by your voice and interpretation?â\n\nBecause the piece has no text and, it can easily be performed by any instrument. The most famousÂ arrangements are for orchestra (by the composer himself) and for cello and piano, arranged by the legendary Jascha Heifetz and Mitislav Rostropovich.Â Written in a minor key, like so many of Rachmaninovâs most memorable pieces,Â VocaliseÂ has a melancholy undertone that reflects the composerâs dark mood at this time, as Russia struggled in World War I and hovered on the brink of revolution. Its opening melodic phrase is an artfully disguised version of the ancient âDies Iraeâ (âDay of Judgmentâ) plainchant theme for the Requiem Mass for the Dead; this grim musical idea was a recurring motive throughout much of Rachmaninoffâs music. But the effortless, unending flow of melody â unfolding in beautiful, arching phrases â triumphs over the sadness.\n\nYiddish Medley\n\nThis medley was arranged for Laurie Rubin by her voice coach, Tova Marcos,Â when Laurie was in middle and high school. The three songs were written by Abraham Ellstein, a renowned Yiddish theatre composer who was a product of Julliard. Ellstein was one of the \"big four\" composers of his era in New Yorkâs Yiddish Theater District scene.Â His musicalÂ Yidl Mitn FidlÂ became one of the greatest hits of Yiddish-language cinema.\n\nOy Mame was featured in the film \"Yidl Mitn Fidl\" where, like Barbra Streisand's Yentl, Yidâl poses as a boy so she can become a street musician and falls in love with a fellow but can't divulge her true gender to him.Â Molly Picon, the famous Yiddish actress/singer portrayed her. Â Maz'l was from the film \"Mamele\", also starring Molly Picon. Abi Gezunt was also from the film \"Mamele,\"Â which Molly Picon not only starred in, but for which she was the lyricist. Â Abi Gezunt became Picon's theme song.â\n\nFar From the Home I Love\n\nFiddler on the RoofÂ is a musical based onÂ Tevye and his DaughtersÂ (orÂ Tevye the Dairyman) and other tales by Sholem Aleichem. The story centers on Tevye, a milkman in the village of Anatevka, who attempts to maintain Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives. He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye. âFar From the Home I Loveâ is sung by Hodel (one of Tevyeâs daughters) in Act 2 after news that her fiancÃ© has been arrested and exiled to Siberia. She explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family."
