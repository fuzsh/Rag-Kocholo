The Latin term “Tabula Rasa” translates to “blank slate,” a concept deeply embedded in the narrative of this film. Tickets may be purchased at the link below, which also contains a trailer for the film: https://tickets.cinequest.org/websales/pages/info.aspx?evtinfo=292614~a12ee803-7eae-437e-8208-1c4d52da2020\n\nBrought to life under the meticulous direction of Nawneet Ranjan and penned by the collaborative brilliance of Donna Laemmlen & Nawneet Ranjan, ‘Tabula Rasa (Kora Kagazz)‘ narrates the poignant tale of three wandering souls searching for solace. Divya, a dedicated juvenile home warden, and Vivek, a passionate actor striving for authenticity in his art, come across Sandhya, a 14-year-old girl, shadowed by her tumultuous past. United by destiny, their lives intertwine as they endeavour to rise above adversity.\n\nLeading the cast are the talented Rajat Kapoor, Swastika Mukherjee, and the prodigious Aishani Yadav. The drama is a touching exploration of human connections and the lessons we impart upon one another through our life journeys. Central to the narrative is the philosophy: “Life is just a Kora Kagazz (blank slate), and what truly defines us is what we choose to inscribe upon it.” This ethos is beautifully depicted, emphasizing the protagonist’s courage and determination to voice her emotions.\n\nRenowned critic Archika Khurana of The Times of India lauds the film, stating, “‘Kora Kagazz’ deserves to be seen for its sincere efforts of telling a heartfelt story.”\n\nNawneet Ranjan’s journey as a filmmaker is as captivating as his movies. After almost seven years in the U.S., including a stint studying in San Francisco, Ranjan was beckoned by the tales from the bylanes of Mumbai’s Dharavi, resulting in the well-received ‘Dharavi Diaries’. However, his passion for community service drew him back to Mumbai, where he dedicated himself to empowering children through education.\n\nLegendary actress Diane Baker, acclaimed for her collaborations with Alfred Hitchcock such as Marnie, her role in Silence of the Lambs and as producer of A Woman of Substance Emmy Nominated for Best Mini-Series among other extensive credits has expressed admiration for Ranjan, having known and mentored him during his academic journey at San Francisco’s Academy of Arts University Film Program.\n\n“I’m so proud of Nawneet, and so impressed by his talent,” said Baker. “I hope his film is distributed in the USA either on Netflix, Amazon, or Apple! It’s very good and worthy of distribution especially from a new young filmmaker who raised his own funds in India to write and direct and produce!”\n\n“Cinequest has always been a beacon for world cinema, and I’m thrilled to showcase our film here,” said Nawneet Ranjan. Both he and Donna Laemmlen will grace the Cinequest Film Festival 2023 with their presence.\n\nThe 2023 Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival, running August 15 through 30 is themed ‘energized’ this year and promises to be a melting pot of cinematic treasures from across the globe.\n\nCinequest fuses innovation with the arts to empower great creations and to engage audiences, youth, artists, and innovators with these creations and with each other forging community, joy, and our future. Set in Silicon Valley, Cinequest’s uniqueness, impact, and legacy result from applying this powerful integration of creativity, technology, and community to inspire and transform lives. Cinequest does this through the Cinequest Film & Creativity Festival, Maverick Studio, and Picture The Possibilities youth creativity services.\n\nPerhaps USA Today said it best: “Move over Cannes! Of the more than 4,000 film festivals around the globe, more than half take place on U.S. soil, and many rank among the best of the best. Our panel of film experts, movie buffs and festival gurus were tasked with narrowing down the field to the best 20 film festivals in the nation before we turned it over to USA TODAY and 10Best readers to choose their favorites. After four weeks of voting, we have a winner. Cinequest Voted Best Film Festival!”\n\nMedia Contacts:\n\nJulie Warren / Palm Springs Public Library / Julie.warren@palmspringsca.gov / (760) 416-6731\n\nDavid Perry / DP&A, Inc. / news@davidperry.com / (415) 676-7007\n\nPalm Springs Public Library Foundation Announces Armistead Maupin\n\nto Headline “Pride on the Page” Book Festival\n\nLegendary Tales of the City Author Appears Friday, October 13\n\nat Palm Springs Cultural Center to Kick Off\n\nthe 2nd Annual Pride on the Page Book Festival\n\n15 August 2023 / Palm Springs: Armistead Maupin, whose Tales of the City novels and TV series have made the author one of the world’s most important and best known gay literary voices, will appear as a special guest at this year’s 2nd Annual Pride on the Page Book Festival (www.prideonthepage.org). The on-stage discussion with local writer David Eugene Perry on Friday, October 13 at 7pm will benefit the Palm Springs Public Library Foundation. United Airlines, a longtime ally of the LGBTQ community is sponsoring the appearance with additional support from El Mirasol Villas Resort and Visit Palm Springs. Maupin and his husband, artist, and photographer Christopher Turner, make their home in London, England.\n\n“Chris and I are thrilled to be returning to Palm Springs,” said Maupin, “and I look forward to reading aloud a sneak preview of my new novel, Mona of the Manor, to be published in March 2024.”\n\nMaupin will be onstage in conversation with longtime journalist David Eugene Perry, host and creator of 10 Percent TV, the longest running LGBTQ TV show in California history which ran for ten years and 351 episodes. Perry’s debut novel, Upon This Rock, won the 2021 Ben Franklin Silver Medal from the Independent Book Publishers Association and “Best Gay Book of 2021” from the San Francisco Book Festival. Called an “elegant, twisty thriller” by Maupin, and “the gay ‘DaVinci Code but a lot better” by Fenton Johnson, Upon This Rock, is currently in screenplay development with a sequel, Thorns of the 15 Roses, underway. Following the main event Maupin will autograph books. A selection of his titles will be available for sale in the lobby courtesy of The Best Bookstore in Palm Springs.\n\nTickets for the evening are $65 in advance for general admission seating ($75 day-of, if available) with a limited number of VIP tickets at $95 that include a pre-event reception (6pm), a copy of his memoir Logical Family and preferred seating. Tickets to the event may be purchased online at: https://rb.gy/3nvgw.\n\nLaunched in 1976 as a groundbreaking serial in the San Francisco Chronicle, Armistead Maupin’s iconic Tales of the City series has since blazed its own trail through popular culture from a sequence of globally best-selling novels to a Peabody Award-winning television miniseries starring Olympia Dukakis and Laura Linney, to an ambitious new musical that had its world premiere at San Francisco’s American Conservatory Theater in 2011. The series now encompasses eight hugely popular novels: Tales of the City, More Tales of the City, Further Tales of the City, Babycakes, Significant Others, Sure of You, Michael Tolliver Lives, and Mary Ann in Autumn. The final Tales novel, The Days of Anna Madrigal, was released in January 2014. It premiered at #3 on the Independent Bestseller list and #7 on the New York Times Bestseller list. In 2019 Netflix aired a new series based on the novels titled Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City.\n\nMaupin’s 1992 novel, Maybe the Moon, which followed the serio-comic adventures of a dwarf actress working in Hollywood, was named one of the ten best books of the year by Entertainment Weekly. The Night Listener (2000), a psychological suspense novel inspired by an eerie episode in Maupin’s own life, became a 2006 feature film starring Robin Williams and Toni Collette.\n\nIn 2017 he wrote a memoir titled Logical Family which grew out of his critically acclaimed one-man show of the same name. Neil Gaiman said this about Logical Family; “Maupin is one of America’s finest storytellers, and the story of his life is a story as fascinating, as delightful and as compulsive as any of the tales he has made up for us.”\n\nIn 1997 Maupin received the Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Publishing Triangle of New York. In 2002 he was honored with the Trevor Project’s Life Award “for his efforts in saving young lives.” Maupin was the first recipient of Litquake’s Barbary Coast Award for his literary contribution to San Francisco. In 2012 he was awarded Lambda’s Pioneer Award which is bestowed on individuals who have broken new ground in the field of LGBT literature and publishing. In 2014 he received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. He also received the Visionary Award from the 2014 Outfest Legacy Awards for his collected novels and their “…diverse, interconnected community of San Francisco bohemians — which shaped our collective fantasy of what LGBT life is and could be.” Maupin is the subject of two documentaries: Armistead Maupin is a Man I Dreamt Up (1992) and Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin (2017).\n\nThe special event with Maupin on Friday evening kicks off the Second Annual Pride on the Page Book Festival, with most events taking place Saturday, October 14 (10am – 5:30pm). The FREE full day festival will take place at the Palm Springs Cultural Center’s historic Camelot Theatre (2300 Baristo Road, Palm Springs) and features ten panels of 40+ LGBTQ+ and affirming authors and their books in lively discussions. The goal of the Pride on the Page Festival is to communicate different viewpoints and represent various genres that will attract readers/people who have never experienced queer culture, and others who have made it the focus of their lives. The Festival’s panel moderators will lead the authors through discussions of their work, hearing from their point-of-view, helping attendees to discover new authors or get reacquainted with long-time favorites.\n\nAdvanced registration on Eventbrite is requested to help manage the event. Those that register and then check-in on the day of the event will receive a free gift. Register at: https://rb.gy/h82yj To learn more about the Pride on the Page Book Festival, the appearing authors, schedule of events and more, go to www.prideonthepage.org.\n\nThere will be something for everyone at the Second Annual Pride on the Page Book Festival presented by the Palm Springs Public Library Foundation and the Palm Springs Public Library. In addition, other sponsors include the City of Palm Springs, Palm Springs Cultural Center, The Best Bookstore in Palm Springs (the official book seller at the events), United Airlines, David Perry & Associates, Inc, El Mirasol Villas Resort, Visit Palm Springs, KGAY Radio, CV Independent, and The Standard.\n\nEnriching Lives, Connecting Community, Inspiring Growth, and Sparking Creativity. For over a century, Palm Springs has recognized the importance of a thriving local library. From a small adobe housing its first books in 1919 to today’s stacks holding over 100,000 resource items, the library has served residents from a dozen different branches. The mission of the Palm Springs Public Library Foundation is to continue that legacy. We aim to support the Palm Springs Public Library and to increase and broaden its use as a cultural and educational institution through financial support securing its place as an essential community resource. Ensuring local access to high-quality library services for generations requires more than just tax-based funding. Although public funds make libraries possible, it is private gifts that make them flourish.
