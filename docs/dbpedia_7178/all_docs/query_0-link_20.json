        "text": "What is the middle classification for female voice?\n\nMezzo soprano is the female voice range that lies between soprano and contralto. Mezzo sopranos tend to have secondary roles in operas, with some notable exceptions.\n\nWhat is a mezzo in singing?\n\nA mezzo soprano, more often called a \"mezzo,\" is the female voice with a range and sound quality between Soprano (the highest) and Alto (the lowest). In classical music, for example, Carmen is the best known mezzo character in opera. In popular music, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are good examples of mezzos.\n\nWhat is the difference between treble and soprano?\n\nA treble is the highest of the four main male voice types, usually found in cathedral choirs, and is sung by boys. The soprano is the highest of the three main female voice types, higher than mezzo-soprano and alto."
