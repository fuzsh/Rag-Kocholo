        "meta_description": "Barbra Streisand has become a cultural icon and a trailblazer for women in the entertainment industry. She has used her voice to bring attention to important social issues, and her talent and artistry have inspired generations of performers.  Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1942 to a middle-class Jewish family Streisand began singing at an early age. She honed her skills by performing at talent shows and local clubs, and by the age of 18, she had already landed her first gig as a nightclub singer. Her breakout role came in 1964 when she starred in the Broadway musical “Funny Girl,” which earned her a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. The musical was later adapted into a film, which earned Streisand an Academy Award for Best Actress. She continued to appear in successful films, including “Hello, Dolly!” and “The Way We Were,” which showcased her incredible vocal range and dramatic acting abilities. In 1983, Streisand made her directorial debut with the film “Yentl,” which she also starred in and produced. She continued to direct and produce films, including “The Prince of Tides,” which earned her a Golden Globe for Best Director, and “The Mirror Has Two Faces.” In addition to her acting career, Streisand has enjoyed a successful music career having sold over 150 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time. It’s safe to say Streisand has an iconic influence, being active in politics and social causes, using her platform to advocate for women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, and environmental causes.  Streisand remains a beloved figure in popular culture as her legacy continues to inspire and influence the world of music and film. We hope you will enjoy this gallery as much as we do!",
