        "text": "Post by galaxyseal on\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand\n\nVoice Type: Mezzo-Soprano\n\nVocal Range: B2-D6\n\n{Vocal Summary:}\n\nArguably the focal point of her music, Streisand's distinct, highly emotive voice has frequently been praised for its endearing yet dynamic quality. Comfortably spanning just over three octaves, Streisand's voice has something of a rounded, nasal quality to it, something emphasised by Streisand's frequent use of vibrato. Though most commonly categorised as a mezzo-soprano, in early albums, Streisand's voice's light tone was more akin to that of a soprano, before it mellowed out to sound how we know it today. Across her entire career, however, Streisand has displayed an extraordinary mastery over her voice, being capable of sustaining notes for very long periods of time, hitting effortless soaring fifth octave belts (\"My Man\", \"Since I Fell For You\", \"I Can See It\") and reaching weightier third octave notes (\"People\", \"After The Rain\", \"No Matter What Happens\"). Blessed with one of the most technically proficient voices in recent memory, there's no denying that Streisand's immensely powerful vocals have set the standard for many female vocalists to follow.\n\nwritten by Alex61 with interpolation from galaxyseal\n\nSignificant High Notes:\n\nD6 (\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\")\n\nC♯6 (\"Hello, Dolly!\")\n\nC6 (\"He Could Show Me\", \"Honey
