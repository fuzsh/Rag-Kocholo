        "text": "Category Archives: Expressivity\n\nWhat is a plagiarized performance?\n\nYesterday I was watching a Facebook Live done by my business coach, Michelle Markwart Deveaux (of faithculturekiss studio for voice and acting and the Speakeasy Cooperative), and she was talking about the difference between teaching and coaching. As voice teachers, our job is to give information to our students. This is fine – this isContinue reading “What is a plagiarized performance?”\n\nMy latest obsession\n\nMy latest obsession is a musical that I just discovered this past weekend and I want to share it with all of you. Last week I heard the opening number from My Favorite Year on On Broadway on SiriusXM and I was enchanted. I had to know more, so I added it to my Apple MusicContinue reading “My latest obsession”\n\nThe Cicada: Nature’s Krumhorn\n\nThis past Sunday, we held the 2nd annual outdoor studio recital in my backyard, called “For the First Time in Forever” (since it was the first time in forever that we got to sing in front of people – thanks to Nichole Feltner for the suggestion and for opening the program with that song. ItContinue reading “The Cicada: Nature’s Krumhorn”\n\nCuriosity Killed the …\n\nNothing. It kills nothing. Curiosity is a good thing. According to Seth Godin (who I haven’t quoted for a while), curiosity is one of the three foundations of art: Curiosity Generosity Connection These three components allow us to create and to make art, which “is a tool that gives us the ability to make thingsContinue reading “Curiosity Killed the …”\n\nMy First Webinar!\n\nThis past Saturday, I hosted a webinar on the topic of singing the Schubert Ave Maria. Each attendee received a handout afterwards covering: The history of the piece (spoiler alert: Schubert did not write the Ave Maria – at least that wasn’t the name of the song, it wasn’t in Latin, nor was it intended as a settingContinue reading “My First Webinar!”\n\nChanging my Vision\n\nI have been very good at writing regularly for the past year. I did decide to go from thrice weekly to twice weekly in 2021, and I’ve kept to that. Till this week. I missed Tuesday. And I forgot to write out a schedule for my April blogposts, which I usually do on the firstContinue reading “Changing my Vision”\n\nWorld Voice Weekend Will Transform You (yep, I said that)\n\nI have decided to extend Early Bird Registration for World Voice Weekend through April 5 (Easter Monday). My business coach, Michelle Markwart Deveaux, asked me if I’ve made it clear in my marketing how I believe people will be changed by World Voice Weekend. I think I have, in my blogposts, in my social mediaContinue reading “World Voice Weekend Will Transform You (yep, I said that)”\n\nEverything You Need to Know About World Voice Weekend\n\nIt’s a little less than one week till Early Bird pricing expires for World Voice Weekend, and if you haven’t signed up yet, maybe it’s because you’re wondering just what you’ll get for your tuition. Last Thursday’s post covered most of clinicians and their background, but here’s a little more information for you about justContinue reading “Everything You Need to Know About World Voice Weekend”\n\nYay! I get to PRACTICE\n\nHow often do you say that? If you’re me, hardly ever. It’s usually, “Ugh, I have to practice.” Unless I have a gig lined up, in which case, the “ugh” is missing because I am looking forward to the gig. Or an audition, which I endure because it might get me the gig. But practicingContinue reading “Yay! I get to PRACTICE”"
