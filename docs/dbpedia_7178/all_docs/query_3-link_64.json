        "text": "“People.” We all know the song from the show Funny Girl and the way Barbra Streisand delivers that final stanza. I can close my eyes and hear the elegance of the phrasing – “pe-0-ple who need people are the LUCK-i-est people in the world”. Goosebumps? Always.\n\nIt was years before I really understood why needing others makes us lucky. Growing up, I took for granted that family would be there for me. As a child, that’s all I required.\n\nBut gradually, as I grew older, I realized that family couldn’t give or sustain friendships. And that I would want and need those friendships to enrich, support, and broaden my world.\n\nEven later, I learned that finding and keeping work necessitated engaging in relationships that are reciprocal. And that having mentors and supportive colleagues is indeed lucky. Without them, I would be navigating all my challenges alone.\n\nFast Forward to Barbra Streisand Today\n\nFor much of Barbra Streisand’s 81 years, she has purposely cloaked her personal life in privacy. In spite of her enormous success, she has largely stayed out of the public eye. So, it was a great pleasure to listen to her recent acceptance speech as the recipient of the Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Woman of Leadership Award. Presented annually, the award recognizes leaders who have distinguished themselves by assuming a leadership role, and making a meaningful change in the lives of others.\n\nIn her remarks, Barbra Streisand praised the late Justice Ginsburg for “being a beacon of light for women and girls”. Not only did Justice Ginsburg fiercely advocate for women to have legal protections equal to men, she openly talked about the difficulties she faced as a female both in her education and career.\n\nSpeaking admiringly about Justice Ginsburg’s courage, Barbra Streisand also called out experiences she and Justice Ginsburg shared:\n\nBoth grew up in Brooklyn to poor families.\n\nBoth were dying to see what was beyond the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nBoth loved music.\n\nBoth were subjected to antisemitism.\n\nBoth believed when it comes to ambitions, women and men should be treated equally.\n\nAnd as connectors, both believed in helping other women.\n\nIn concluding remarks, Streisand explained how she has always loved the Jewish tradition of Tikkum Olan which means to repair the world. “When we support each other, we all stand to gain. It fulfills the soul to help others.”\n\nHow We Can Build Our Own Connection Strategy\n\nInspired by the talent and enormous success of both Justice Ginsburg and Barbra Streisand, I have been thinking about how we can draw on their life lessons. Even if we think we can’t possibly impact the world as they have, don’t sell yourself short.\n\nStart small.\n\nBegin with the decision to find and build relationships.\n\nHow we can make a meaningful change in the lives of others?\n\nDraw parallels between you and those you admire.\n\nLet those parallels motivate you to work through your challenges.\n\nDon’t be shy about applauding the good deeds of those you admire.\n\nListen to what those around you need.\n\nIf you can help, do it.\n\nAs Barbra Streisand explains:\n\n“Doubt can motivate you, so don’t be afraid of it. Confidence and doubt are at two ends of the scale and you need both. They balance each other out.”"
