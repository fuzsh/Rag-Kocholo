        "text": "I like Aretha more because her catalog is better. I like Whitney more because she was beautiful and charismatic. They both also had far more memorable personalities offstage(for better or worse). Memes and things of that nature keep them alive with younger generations.\n\nAretha is the most influential female R&B/Soul artist of all time. Aside from Madonna(Janet falls in the same category), Whitney is also the most influential female Pop star of the last last 40 years . There are countless female Pop and R&B artist that name them as major influences. Can Babs say that she influenced entire generations of singers?\n\nAnother factor:\n\nAretha was NEVER shy with her catalogue of music.\n\nI always remember hearing Aretha's music on TV shows and in movies as far back as I can remember. Barbara has always been more conservative.\n\nCompare her 35 entries to Aretha's 160 on Tunefind which shows you which shows have used music from which artist.\n\nAretha also wasn't afraid to put out covers of popular songs in a bid for continued relevancy.\n\nAs R6 / R7 / R8 pointed out Aretha or \"Hateretha\" (as the kids called her) also became part of meme culture a while ago.\n\nHer comments on Taylor Swift were legendary and kids still quote \"great gowns, beautiful gowns\" regularly. Try running a search for it on Twitter. It has become a very popular expression as a shady response.\n\nOP, your premise is completely wrong, so there’s no way to answer it. The other posts here just have people telling you why Aretha and Whitney are better, or trashing Streisand.\n\nBut you knew that, didn’t you? You’re just another sorry Barbra hater who can’t stop talking about her.\n\n[quote]Charisma, emotion and, yes, even tragedy is what makes people immortal.\n\nThis. Barbra would never have allowed the glorious haphazard 'Amazing Grace' to have been filmed.\n\nIt's true we had to wait a while to see it - but there, finally, was charisma and emotion by the bucketload. Created by that transcendent voice.\n\nFirst, I'm not sure the thread premise is true - both are considered great singers, but with different audiences. Aretha was far more important to rock and soul, the primary popular music of her generation. From the beginning Streisand seemed more in tune with an older era. When she did try to sing rock it was usually awkward.\n\nAretha did try to sing \"People\" on her last album, since she could never resist a diva battle and liked to believe she could do anything. Not her finest moment.\n\nAretha's music was the soundtrack of a generation in revolt. Songs like \"Respect,\" \"A Natural Woman,\" \"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man,\" \"Chain of Fools,\" etc. demanded your respect and defiantly swung at the patriarchy, and served as a backdrop of the civil rights marches, the women's liberation movement, the black is beautiful mantra of the 1960s and 70s. This inherently made Aretha hip and cool and progressive.\n\nBarbra's music was middle of the road, establishment music that your parents and grandparents could enjoy. She sang showtunes and corny romantic songs. She certainly was radio friendly, but I didn't know any person my age while growing up who admitted to listening to her.\n\nAretha is appreciated as a -musician-, and a vocalist and live performer. One of the best of the past century. She had a charismatic factor as well.\n\nBarbara is appreciated as a singer, songwriter and talented actress. She is better known by most for the latter imo, so that's her 'lane' in the eyes of most. She is an Oscar-winner, both for acting and song-writing. Barbara is of a standards singer, and did not tour much during her career. It's the lack of live performing imo, along with the hanging shadow of the acting career, that puts her further down the list of singing greats, behind Aretha.\n\nAretha didn't act so there's no comparison in that category.\n\nThe highest view count for Barbra Streisand on Youtube is \"Woman In Love\" (54 million), followed by a duet with Celine Dion, Tell Him (42 million). The third video is that Duck Sauce \"tribute\" (42 million).\n\nIn contrast, the Aretha Franklin YT video with the greatest views is \"I Say a Little Prayer\" (133 milllion). Next is \"Respect (55 million), \"Natural Woman\" (36 million), followed closely by the 2015 Kennedy Center performance of the song (33 million). Speaking of acting, the Blues Brothers version of \"Think\" is number 5 (32 million).\n\n[quote] Remember that atrocious version she did of \"Bridge Over Trouble Water\"? Just awful.\n\nPaul Simon ranked her version as the best, next to Garfunkel’s.\n\n[quote] Without any doubt, Aretha Franklin was one of the greatest live performers in history. It’s impossible to pinpoint her peak moment on a stage, but many fans point to her stand at the Fillmore East in March 1971 that was captured on the LP Aretha Live at Fillmore West as one of the all-time greats. A camera was also rolling on at least one night and you can check out her sublime take on Simon and Garfunkel’s then-recent hit “Bridge Over Troubled Water” right here. She completely reinvents the song, finding the soul and gospel within Simon’s lyrics and melody.\n\n[quote] Paul Simon has always ranked it among the greatest covers of his work, even better than Elvis Presley’s famous rendition of the same song. “Aretha’s version is tremendous,” he said. “The best I ever heard except Artie’s.” In a brand new statement Garfunkel provided to Rolling Stone after Franklin’s death, he agrees. “Paul says he heard the phrase ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’ sung as a Baptist riff,” he says. “I took it to mainstream radio. Then Aretha so brilliantly brought it back to church.” Aretha’s rendition of the song reached Number Six on the Hot 100 in 1971. It remained a key part of her live act until the very end\n\nAretha, Whitney and Natalie were great losses to all humankind. Their gifts are really beyond description. Streisand is a collection of awards and early accolades, but her music is unimportant and soulless. The movies are best forgotten - other than the first one. She's so transparently a narcissist in every performance. She is performing for herself. She gives nothing. Streisand never moved anyone with her acting or singing. The sound of her voice was another thing. Quite beautiful in quality. Her few remaining fans and some vocal coaches will mourn her special talent.\n\nI was a kid when Cape Fear and Prince of Tides came out. Both were “grownup” movies and so I didn’t see them until relatively recently. Because of their associations with Streisand, whom old people seem to worship, I expected them to be good movies. They were terrible. Or Lifetime Movie Network-caliber at best. And Streisand was not good or believable in either one. Her acting is so overly performed. I remember watching both of those movies and wondering why I was seeing a poor actress when everyone worships this woman’s talents.\n\nCher’s big movies came out during the same era as the ones above, and she usually outshines her costars in her movies. I expected The Witches of Eastwick to be better than it is based on its reputation, but Cher’s performance was still more charismatic than I expected.\n\nStreisand kind of gives me the willies no matter what she does.\n\nR40 Aretha was far from being perfect. She got sloppy with her songs, concerts, and too many remakes as the years went on. And her appearance was awful with all the weight piled on. A great singer but she was just calling it in as time went on. And we won't even mention all the concerts that she cancelled.\n\n\"Barbara was great, but Barbra was never cool.\"\n\nActually she was very cool in the 1960s. When she left New York for Hollywood, it was over.\n\nAs far as the bitch thing goes, BOTH Streisand and Aretha were over the top divas. They compare perfectly on that level.\n\nAretha didn't give a shit what anyone else thought and was willing to let it all hang out, literally. Barbra's undying desire for \"perfection\" has always been ridiculous and held her back from doing so many things. The hair, the nails, the Donna Karan outfits....yes, that's perfection, all right."
