They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nBarbra Streisand is an American singer, actress, and filmmaker. With a career spanning seven decades, she has achieved success in multiple fields of entertainment and is one of the few entertainers who have been awarded an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award (EGOT).\n\nStreisand began her career by performing in nightclubs and Broadway theaters in the early 1960s. Following her guest appearances on various television shows, she signed to Columbia Records and released her debut album, The Barbra Streisand Album (1963). It won two Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Throughout her recording career, Streisand has topped the US Billboard 200 chart with 11 albums—a record for a woman—including People (1964), The Way We Were (1974), Guilty (1980), and Higher Ground (1997).[1] She has attained five number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart: \"The Way We Were\", \"Evergreen\", \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\", \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\", and \"Woman in Love\".\n\nAfter becoming an established recording artist in the 1960s, Streisand ventured into film by the end of that decade.[2] She starred in the critically acclaimed Funny Girl (1968), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress.[3] Her other films include Hello, Dolly! (1969), The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), What's Up, Doc? (1972), The Way We Were (1973), Funny Lady (1975), Yentl (1983), Nuts (1987), The Prince of Tides (1991), and The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996). For her film A Star Is Born (1976), she won her second Academy Award, composing music for the love theme \"Evergreen\", the first woman to be honored as a composer.[4] With the release of Yentl (1983), Streisand became the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film.[5] The film won an Oscar for Best Score and a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical. Streisand also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, becoming the first (and for 37 years, the only) woman to win that award.\n\nWith sales of over 150 million records worldwide, Streisand is one of the best-selling recording artists of all time.[6][7] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the highest-certified female artist in the United States, with 68.5 million certified album units tying with Mariah Carey.[8] Billboard honored Streisand as the greatest Billboard 200 female artist of all time.[9] Her accolades include two Academy Awards,[10] 10 Grammy Awards including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and the Grammy Legend Award,[11] four Primetime Emmy Awards, four Peabody Awards,[12] the Presidential Medal of Freedom,[13] the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award[14] and nine Golden Globes.[15]\n\nRecognitions\n\n[edit]\n\nName of the organizations, year presented, award category, nominee(s) of the award and the result of the nomination Organizations[a] Year[b] Category Recipient(s) Result Academy Awards 1969 Best Actress Funny Girl Won [16] 1974 The Way We Were Nominated 1977 Best Original Song \"Evergreen\" Won 1992 Best Picture The Prince of Tides Nominated 1997 Best Original Song \"I Finally Found Someone\" Nominated Academy of Achievement 1992 Golden Plate honoree Barbra Streisand Won Alliance for Women in Media 2001 Gracie Awards Won APLA Health 1992 Commitment to Life Award Won American Civil Liberties Union Bill of Rights Award Won American Film Institute 2001 AFI Life Achievement Award Won American Friends of the Hebrew University 1984 Scopus Award Won American Guild of Variety Artists 1970 Entertainer of the Year Won 1972 Singing Star of the Year Won 1977 Won 1980 Won American Society of Cinematographers 2014 Board of Governors Award Honours ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards 1988 Most Performed Feature Film Standards \"Evergreen\" (with Paul Williams) Won 1994 Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award Barbra Streisand Honours 1998 Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures \"I Finally Found Someone\" Won ASCAP Pop Music Awards 1969 Pied Piper Award Barbra Streisand Won 1986 Most Performed Pop Standards \"Evergreen\" Won 1998 Most Performed Song \"I Finally Found Someone\" Won Anti-Defamation League 1978 Woman of Achievement in the Arts Barbra Streisand Won Brandeis University 1995 Honorary Doctorate in Arts and Humanities Honours Brit Awards 1983 Best Selling Album Memories Won [17] CableACE Award 1987 Performance in a Music Special Putting It Together: The Making of the Broadway Album Nominated 1988 One Voice Nominated Music Special Nominated 1995 Barbra: The Concert Nominated Directing a Music Special or Series Won Performance in a Music Special or Series Won Cedars-Sinai Medical Center 2011 Board of Governors Humanitarian Award Barbra Streisand Honours Christopher Award 1998 Filmmaker of the Year Award Won 2011 Feature Films Rescuers: Stories of Courage: Two Women Won CINE Golden Eagle 2001 Short Film Documentary The Living Century Won Broadcast Division: News, Special Features, Public Affairs & General Information Reel Models: The First Women of Film Won David di Donatello 1969 Best Foreign Actress Funny Girl Won 1974 The Way We Were Won 1984 Best Foreign Producer Yentl Nominated 1988 Best Foreign Actress Nuts Nominated Daytime Emmy Award 2001 Outstanding Special Class Special Reel Models: The First Women of Film Won Directors Guild of America Award 1992 Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures The Prince of Tides Nominated 1995 Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Musical Variety Barbra: The Concert Won 2001 Barbra Streisand: Timeless Nominated Elle Women in Hollywood 2011 L'Oréal Paris Legend Award Barbra Streisand Honours Film Society of Lincoln Center 2013 Chaplin Award Barbra Streisand Won France 1984 Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Honours 2007 Ordre national de la Légion d'honneur Honours Human Rights Campaign 2004 Humanitarian Award Won George Eastman Museum 1996 George Eastman Award Won Golden Globe Awards 1969 Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy Funny Girl Won [18] 1970 Hello, Dolly!
