        "text": "Chipping Norton restaurant owner and local fundraiser Nathan Phelps was the last of nine children to attend Burford School, leaving in 1996 to pursue a career in the hospitality industry.\n\nHe trained at the very top level for ten years, working at Michelin-starred restaurants all around the UK, most notably at the Fat Duck under Heston Blumenthal. Then, in 2019, he bought Whistlers Restaurant in Chipping Norton where he is the Chef.\n\nNathan has settled back into the local community since his return to the area and recently completed a 300 km cycle ride and a 10km 'Tough Mudder'. He is now soon to take on a 10km ‘Marathon Swim’ to help raise much-needed funds to maintain the Chipping Norton Lido - the town's outdoor pool. So far, he has raised over £1,400, commenting, 'I am extremely happy to be so well supported by the locals and many of my old teachers from Burford School'.\n\nIf you would like to sponsor Nathan, do visit his fundraising page on Total Giving. The swim will take place on Sunday, 28 May.\n\nWe wish Nathan the best of luck on Sunday!\n\nNathan's Fundraising Page"
