Dozens left Mulligan’s bar bruised and bloodied – and at least two people were stabbed – in the ruckus that spilled into the parking lot early Saturday morning, according to police.\n\n“This was the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Exeter Detective Robert W. Dunn, who has been on the job for 24 years. “There were people bleeding all over the place. I don’t know how many were stabbed; we’re still trying to figure that out now.”\n\nSeveral injured people left the scene without receiving medical attention, according to Dunn. Two men were taken to hospitals with stab wounds, and several others suffered knife lacerations, police said.\n\n“I saw one guy walk away with his face all bloody,” Dunn said. “He never came back.”\n\nThree people were arrested for aggravated assault and other charges, including riot, hindering apprehension and failure to disperse, according to police.\n\nDunn said one officer initially responded to the fight. As he drove to the rear of the building on Perkiomen Avenue, the rear doors swung open and the brawl spilled into the parking lot, according to Dunn.\n\nThe cop marched into the melee and did what he could to quell the crowd, but things were too far out of hand.\n\n“They attacked him; they tried to hit him with beer bottles,” Dunn said.\n\nThere were six bouncers at the club and they all fought to protect the cop, according to Dunn.\n\n“They helped our guys from getting their heads kicked in, but two of the bouncers went down right away,” he said. “They did everything they could.”\n\nAt least one of the bouncers was slashed, according to Dunn. The owner of the bar is not being cited for any violations.\n\nA K-9 unit arrived, but things were still out of control, so the officer struggling in the crowd hit an emergency button on his radio.\n\nThe device was installed two years ago and had not been used before Friday’s late-night fight, Dunn said. It signals a dozen surrounding police departments that an officer is in distress and in need of immediate backup. Within minutes, 15 police cruisers were at the scene.\n\nNone of the officers was injured in the rumble. Dunn said the police did not use pepper spray or other weapons on the crowd.\n\n“They just kept fighting them off,” he said. “These cops were outstanding, the restraint they used – it’s amazing.”\n\nNathan Phelps, 23, and his brother, Marquis Phelps, 19, both of Reading, were arrested at the scene, as was Tyler Minggia, 20, also of Reading, police said.\n\nThe felony charges for all three men were decided by the police with the assistance of the Berks County District Attorney’s Office.\n\nNathan Phelps was found to be in possession of a knife, according to police.\n\nCitations for disorderly conduct and one DUI arrest were also made at the scene. Police are asking any witnesses to call police at 610-779-1490. The investigation is continuing.\n\n“We still have no idea how it started,” Dunn said.\n\nAnother bar fight took place that weekend, according to state police at Reading. Troopers were called to the Washington Inn at 1:30 a.m. Sunday after four people attacked customers and staff members at the bar, police said.\n\nSeveral people were taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital, near Allentown, but the extent of their injuries was not disclosed.\n\nPolice said they are looking for two men and two women in connection with the fight. Anyone with information on that incident is asked to call 610-378-4011.\n\nOriginally Published: May 27, 2003 at 6:43 a.m."
