        "text": "Monica Phelps is the mother of Nathan Phelps. The family struggled for years, especially after Monica was left widowed and Nathan left fatherless when her husband and his father was stabbed to death years before. Nathan would be told to hide in the closet while Monica invited men in her apartment to have sex with. She and Nathan became friends with a woman named Gina Arroyo, when they eventually met her.\n\nOne is Ted Carthage, the founder of My Salvation Charities Nathan referred to as \"the good people\", and a serial sexual abuser of people taking donations for extra kickbacks. One night, Monica tried to throw Carthage out of the apartment, resulting in Monica being raped and shot while Nathan was in the closet. Nathan narrowly escaped death and injury himself when the bullets whizzing through the closet missed him. Nathan was stuck behind the door until police arrived to get him. Gina was killed earlier by Carthage as well."
