        "text": "Nate Phelps has worked as an LMS Administrator in a University, a Bank, and a Hospital System. While he's been writing stories since he was eight, he didn't finish his first full length book till he was sixteen. Ten years later, he had the idea for a clunky hero in a temperamental jet-pack. Nate loves books that have ingenious plots and fast paced storytelling and has fashioned his craft after that model. Having graduated with a degree in Education, he lives with his wife Jessica and three children Brent, Jude, and River in Idaho. Find out more about him at www.natephelps88.com.\n\nRead full bio"
