        "text": "I’m Nathan Ratchford, MD, FACOG, a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist (OB/GYN). From 2018-2023, I also served as chief medical officer of Phelps Health Hospital. I have been practicing medicine in Rolla since 2008 and added my administrative duties in 2018. I hold a practice designation with the American Board of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. As a gynecologist, I perform minimally invasive surgeries, including laparoscopic hysterectomies (surgical removal of the uterus), tubal ligations (sterilization), endometrial ablations (removal of the lining of the uterus) and more.\n\nIn high school, I was your typical science and math nerd and was a part of the Medical Explorers program. I would drive to Springfield, Missouri, and observe healthcare in action. I knew early on that I wanted to go into medicine, and more specifically, that I wanted to be a surgeon. I’ve always had good hand-eye coordination, enjoy working with my hands and consider myself to be “hands-on.” I chose the OB/GYN specialty in particular, because I think we as a society have a great responsibility to take care of the mothers in our communities.\n\nAs a physician, I go out of my way to make patients feel comfortable and educated on their options. I present the options, but the patient must make their own decision. If a patient feels knowledgeable and empowered, a better outcome will likely result.\n\nI am a Missouri native, growing up in Lamar, which is near Joplin and on the border of Kansas. Today, my wife and I live outside of Rolla with our two children and two barn cats. When I’m not working, I enjoy various DIY projects. As a family, we like to watch movies and TV shows, and play board games. I am the father of a type 1 diabetic and am also an advocate.\n\nI chose Phelps Health because of the community. When I was finishing training in St. Louis, Missouri, my wife and I got a map out and by coincidence, there was a position open in Rolla. I like Rolla, the community, the location. It’s a great place to raise a family, and I’m really happy here.\n\nI also offer telehealth visits, which allow patients to visit with me remotely using a smartphone, tablet or computer with an internet connection and audio-video capabilities."
