        "text": "Editor’s note: The following information comes from The Topeka Capital-Journal archives, unless otherwise noted.\n\nFred Waldron Phelps started his life as a brilliant student and respected lawyer and died Wednesday night as a man who had been excommunicated from the church he founded and reviled internationally for his crusade against homosexuals and picketing of military and other funerals.\n\nPhelps was born Nov. 13, 1929, in Meridian, Miss., in a highly respected family.\n\nHis father, Fred Wade Phelps, was a detective for the Southern Railroad. His mother, Catherine Idalette Johnston Phelps, was a homemaker who died of throat cancer on Sept. 3, 1935, when he was 5 years old.\n\nAfter his mother’s death, maternal great-aunt Irene Jordan helped care for Phelps and his younger sister, Martha Jean, when his father was away from home because of his job. Jordan died in 1950 in a motor vehicle accident as she was driving from Hattiesburg, Miss., to Meridian. In December 1944, when Phelps was 15, his father married Olive Briggs, a 39-year-old divorcee.\n\nIn high school, Phelps earned the rank of Eagle Scout with Palms, played cornet, was a boxer and hurdler, worked on the school newspaper and graduated with honors.\n\nHe also was a member of Phi Kappa, a high school social fraternity, president of the Young Peoples Department of Central United Methodist Church and was honored as the best drilled member of the Mississippi Junior State Guard, a unit similar to the Reserve Officer Training Corps.\n\nPhelps ranked sixth in his graduating class of 213 and was the class orator at his commencement on May 28, 1946. He was 16 years old when he graduated.\n\nThat same year became a turning point in his life.\n\nGetting religion\n\nPhelps had been groomed for an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which he secured and was set to begin in 1947 when he was 17. That summer, he attended a revival at East End Methodist Church in Meridian and, by his own account, was called by God to be a preacher and missionary.\n\nAlso at the revival was John Capron, a close friend who later married Phelps’ sister. They seemed to fuel each other’s newfound excitement about religion. In January 1947, Phelps abandoned his plans to attend West Point and enrolled at Bob Jones University, a nondenominational Christian university in, at that time, Cleveland, Tenn.\n\nBy the summer of 1947, Phelps had switched his religious denomination to Baptist. He was ordained as a Southern Baptist minister on Sept. 8, 1947, at the age of 17, and returned to Bob Jones University as a student.\n\nHowever, Phelps left Bob Jones before he graduated and headed to Prairie Bible Institute in Three Hills, Alberta. In April 1949, after two semesters, he moved to California, where he earned a degree from John Muir College in Pasadena.\n\nIt was while he was in California that he first caught the media’s attention.\n\nThe June 11, 1951, issue of Time Magazine included a story on Phelps as a street-corner preacher who lectured lunch-hour students about sins being committed by students and teachers on the campus.\n\nOne day, police escorted Phelps to a police car, saying they were trying to protect him from a forming hostile crowd. After the crowd broke up, the police released him. He was back to his street-corner preaching almost immediately.\n\nOn May 15, 1952, Phelps married Margie Marie.\n\nPhelps, his pregnant wife and their newborn son, Fred Phelps Jr., settled in Topeka on May 4, 1954 — the day the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation lawsuit was decided. He had been hired as associate pastor at East Side Baptist Church.\n\nBy the time Phelps settled in Topeka, he was estranged from his father and stepmother, in part fueled by his choice to not attend West Point and perhaps his father’s remarriage. Phelps would later be an outspoken critic of divorce and those who divorce.\n\nHis father died at age 84 in 1977. When his stepmother died at age 82 in 1985, she left all of the estate to his sister.\n\nWhile at East Side Baptist, the church’s leadership decided to open another church on Topeka’s west side and Phelps became its pastor. Westboro Baptist Church held its first church service on Nov. 27, 1955, and was formally organized in May 1956.\n\nAlthough nondenominational, Westboro Baptist’s beliefs are most aligned with those of Primitive Baptists, who believe a predetermined number of people were chosen for redemption before the world was created and they will be saved on Judgment Day.\n\nPhelps, while preaching at the church, also worked as a vacuum cleaner, baby stroller and insurance salesman.\n\nThe couple had 13 children. Today, Westboro Baptist Church’s congregation is mainly comprised of family members.\n\nLaw career:\n\nBeginning and end\n\nCombining college hours from the schools he previously attended, Phelps received an undergraduate degree in history from Washburn University in 1962 and then earned a law degree from Washburn’s law school in 1964.\n\nPhelps told The Topeka Capital-Journal he decided to become a lawyer so he could fight social injustice.\n\nBefore Phelps even started law school, a group of Topeka lawyers allegedly tried to block his admission. To be admitted to the bar, a judge must swear to the person’s good character. Phelps couldn’t find a judge who would do it and contended his opposition didn’t like what he was preaching.\n\nSo, Phelps proved his good character by submitting affidavits and evidence of his Eagle Scout and American Legion awards received years before in Mississippi and a letter he received from President Harry Truman. He was admitted to the bar on Feb. 12, 1964.\n\nPhelps developed a reputation as a tough and savvy courtroom and civil rights lawyer and made a lot of money, but he was in trouble with state legal regulators for much of his career.\n\nIn a 1969 disciplinary hearing, the State Board of Law Examiners alleged Phelps committed seven counts of professional misconduct. The Kansas Supreme Court suspended Phelps on three of the seven counts.\n\nThe unraveling of Phelps’ career began on Nov. 8, 1977, when the state filed a complaint seeking his disbarment. The case centered on a lawsuit filed in late 1974 by Phelps against Carolene Brady, a court reporter in Shawnee County District Court, whom he claimed didn’t have a court transcript ready when he wanted it.\n\nHe sought $2,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive damages for alleged fraud and misrepresentation.\n\nDuring the suit, Phelps called Brady to the witness stand, had her declared a hostile witness and cross-examined her for three or four days. The Kansas Supreme Court said Phelps’ cross-examination was abusive, repetitive, irrelevant and a classic case of badgering a witness.\n\nWhen the jury ruled in Brady’s favor, Phelps sought a new trial, but the Kansas Supreme Court justices wrote the trial was a personal vendetta against Brady. In asking for the trial, Phelps said specific witnesses would testify about Brady’s conduct and reputation. Brady obtained affidavits from eight of those witnesses saying they wouldn’t testify as Phelps said they would.\n\nThe formal complaint against Phelps in the disbarment charged his motion for a new trial misrepresented the truth to the court and held Brady up to “unnecessary public ridicule for which there is no basis in fact.”\n\nOn July 20, 1979, the Kansas Supreme Court said Phelps should be disbarred and assessed court costs. Phelps appealed the disbarment to federal court. U.S. District Court Judge Clarence Brimmer, of Cheyenne, Wyo., dismissed the appeal, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal.\n\nPhelps was permanently disbarred from practicing law in Kansas courts. However, he could still practice in federal courts. The name of the family’s law firm was changed from Fred. W. Phelps Chartered to Phelps Chartered.\n\nAs a result of his state court disbarment, Phelps was suspended for two years from practicing law in U.S. District Courts in Kansas in October 1980.\n\nBy 1983, Phelps was in trouble with the federal courts again because of demand letters. The complaint, initiated by Wichita lawyer Robert Howard, charged Phelps sent letters to people and businesses he intended to sue, telling them a lawsuit would be filed unless they paid money to Phelps’ clients or took other action to satisfy the clients.\n\nIn September 1987, a panel of three federal judges issued a public censure of Phelps and found enough evidence to sustain charges linked to two of four letters written to clients but dismissed charges on the other two letters.\n\nPhelps’ law career ended Feb. 3, 1989, when he surrendered his license to practice law in federal courts. He gave up his license after he, five of his children and a daughter-in-law — all lawyers — surfaced as defendants in a disciplinary complaint filed Dec. 16, 1985, by nine active and senior U.S. District Court judges in Kansas. The federal judges charged the Phelpses had made false accusations against them.\n\nThe children involved were Fred W. Phelps Jr., Margie Jean Phelps, Shirley Phelps-Roper, Jonathan Baxter Phelps and Elizabeth Marie Phelps. Betty Jean Phelps, wife of Fred Jr., was the seventh defendant.\n\nThe Phelpses claimed blacks and minorities couldn’t get a fair trial in federal court in Kansas; accused U.S. District Court Judge Earl E. O’Connor of racial prejudice, religious prejudice, and conspiracy to violate their civil rights and others; and accused U.S. District Court Judge Richard Rogers of racial prejudice, dislike of civil rights cases, engaging in a racially motivated vendetta against the Phelpses and engaging in a conspiracy with O’Connor.\n\nThe Phelpses lost. The elder Phelps agreed to give up his license to practice in federal court in exchange for the federal judges allowing the other members of Phelps Chartered to continue practicing law in federal court. Margie Jean Phelps was suspended for a year; the younger Fred Phelps for six months. Both were suspended in Kansas courts for the same amount of time.\n\nIn 1990, Phelps entered the political fray. He ran as a Democrat in the Kansas gubernatorial primary and received 11,572 votes, according to Kansas secretary of state records. He ran for governor again in the 1994 and 1998 primaries, receiving 5,349 votes and 15,223 votes, respectively.\n\nPhelps filed as a Democrat in the U.S. Senate primary in 1992 and received 49,416 votes. He lost bids for Topeka mayor in 1993 and 1997.\n\nPickets, publicity\n\nA year after his failed bid in the 1990 gubernatorial primary, Phelps began his Great Gage Park Decency Drive, with the goal of ending what he alleged was homosexual sex in the park. It would be the first of many pickets carried out by Phelps and his followers.\n\nBefore long, the group expanded its picketing efforts against homosexuals from Topeka to other U.S. cities. Their message of hate flooded facsimile machines in homes and offices throughout the nation.\n\nIn 1993, Westboro Baptist members picketed an AIDS victim’s funeral in Kansas City, Mo. Five years later, the church gained international attention when members picketed the funeral of Matthew Shepard, a Wyoming college student who was murdered. Shepard was gay.\n\nPhelps took pride in delivering his message of hate and of being hated for it. In 1994, he told The Capital-Journal that he believed himself to be a modern-day prophet.\n\n“Nobody has the right, in my view, to think he’s preaching the truth of God unless people hate him,” he said. “All of the prophets were treated that way.”\n\nOver the years, Phelps and his followers picketed the funerals of many celebrities, including pop star Michael Jackson, Rat-Packer Frank Sinatra, civil rights activist Coretta Scott King and children’s TV show host Fred Rogers.\n\nThe group picketed the funerals of miners who died in 2006 in a coal mining disaster in West Virginia and threatened to picket the funerals of 20 children killed in a December 2012 schooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but later backed out.\n\nChurch members also canceled plans to protest a memorial service at the University of Arizona-Tucson for victims of a 2011 shooting that killed a 9-year-old girl and wounded Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in exchange for air time on radio talk shows.\n\nLawsuits against or by Phelps, his family members and Westboro Baptist have filled court dockets for nearly 20 years. Many of the lawsuits center on the church’s right to freedom of speech — pickets, protest signs, faxes, political speech, etc. — versus an individual’s right to privacy and protection against criminal defamation and harassment.\n\nOn March 10, 2006, in Westminster, Md., Westboro Baptist members picketed the funeral of Marine Lance Cpl. Matthew A. Snyder, 20, who died a week earlier while serving in Iraq. The church believes the deaths of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan reflect God’s punishment for the nation’s acceptance of homosexuals.\n\nSnyder’s father, Albert Snyder, sued Phelps, his church and two of his daughters — Shirley Phelps-Roper and Rebekah Phelps-Davis — for defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In October 2007, a federal jury sided with Snyder and delivered an $11 million judgment, which a judge later trimmed to $5 million.\n\nThe verdict was dismissed in September 2009 by a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., which said the church’s picket near Snyder’s funeral was protected speech and didn’t violate his family’s privacy. In March 2010, Snyder was ordered to pay the court costs — about $16,500 — for Westboro Baptist.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in March 2011 affirmed, in an 8-1 decision, the church has a constitutional right to picket funerals and express anti-gay sentiment without threat of litigation from people offended by the message.\n\nEarly in the 2012 Kansas legislative session, testimony was heard for a bill designed to thwart Westboro Baptist from picketing military funerals. The bill would have provided civil action against anyone who would “injure, intimidate, interfere with or harass members of the military” or their immediate family members.\n\n“It is another lame, ineffective, sorry attempt to shut off the word of God from this state,” Shirley Phelps-Roper told The Capital-Journal in January 2012. “It’s against their interests. They need this more than they need oxygen and water.”\n\nIn April 2008, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius signed the Kansas Funeral Privacy Act, which banned protests within 150 feet of a funeral one hour before, during and two hours after the service.\n\nIn August 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law the Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act that extends bans on picketing funeral services of troops and veterans from 150 feet to 300 feet. It also prohibits protests from being conducted up to two hours before and after a funeral.\n\nAllegations\n\nof abuse\n\nIn July 1994, two of Phelps’ sons, Mark and Nathan Phelps, alleged their father regularly beat them and some of their siblings with a leather strap or mattock stick — similar to an axe handle — when they were growing up in Topeka.\n\nNathan said his father would yell, curse, scream, threaten and beat the children “as long as it took for him to get whatever was inside him out. It was like this madman out of control with rage. It just had to play itself out.” The brothers claimed the beatings sometimes lasted from one to four hours.\n\nMark told The Topeka Capital-Journal his father once pushed his mother down stairs, causing her to dislocate her shoulder. Another time, he said, his father beat her with the mattock stick because he was unhappy about her weight.\n\nPhelps, as well as son Fred Jr. and daughter Margie, both attorneys who worked at the Kansas Department of Corrections at that time, denied the allegations of beatings. The siblings said their brothers had a deep disagreement with their father over religion and how people should lead their lives.\n\nWhen their father was suspended from practicing law in 1969, Nathan and Mark said the children sold candy in three states to support the family, but under the guise the money was for a new organ, carpeting or pews for the church. At least two candy companies successfully sued Westboro Baptist to recover money for candy shipped to the church that apparently was never paid for or only partially paid for.\n\nToday, at least four of Phelps’ children are estranged from their family — Mark, Nathan, Dortha Olive Bird and Katherine Phelps-Griffin — as are about 20 of his grandchildren.\n\nNathan Phelps, the seventh of the Phelpses’ 13 children, left his father’s home and church at midnight on his 18th birthday. He lives with his wife and children in Calgary, Alberta, and in recent years has become an advocate of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered community and speaks out against the dangers of religion and child abuse.\n\n“I’ve heard from gay teens from small towns all over this country who are haunted by my father’s message of hate,” Phelps told The Capital-Journal in December 2010.\n\n“I’d love nothing more than for my family’s church to never again stand outside a church, cemetery or business with their hateful message,” he also said. “But I know my father, and I know any effort to silence him directly will instinctively be met with the opposite effect.”\n\nIn March 2013, former Westboro Baptist member Lauren Drain released a book, “Banished, A Memoir, Surviving My Years in the Westboro Baptist Church,” that detailed her life in the church and her years picketing funerals of children, troops, and homosexuals and spreading the message she once believed.\n\nDrain’s father, Steve Drain, was a filmmaker who wanted to shoot a documentary about the church. In the end, he became a believer and moved his family to Topeka to join Westboro Baptist. Lauren was 15 at that time. Letters she had been exchanging with a boy while living in Florida was part of the reason her family came to Topeka.\n\nLauren Drain was banished from the church and disowned by her family when she was 22 because she had been chatting and emailing a man who wasn’t a church member. In the past year, Steve Drain has become the spokesman for the church.\n\nDuring an interview with The Capital-Journal in February 2013, Lauren Drain, who now lives in Connecticut and works as a cardiac nurse, recalled a picket at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where signs church members carried stated “Thank God for Crippled Soldiers.”\n\n“I just wanted to run away from my skin,” Drain said. “It left a lasting impression on me that we did not have a good message. I didn’t feel like a good Christian. I felt like a horrible person. Our message was not of love.”\n\nFinal days\n\nAbout midnight Saturday, Nathan Phelps posted on his website that his father had been excommunicated from Westboro Baptist and was in a hospice center.\n\nSteve Drain confirmed Sunday that Phelps Sr. had health problems and was a patient at Midland Care Hospice in Topeka. Drain, however, wouldn’t discuss whether Phelps Sr. had been voted out of the church.\n\nFred Phelps Sr. died Wednesday night at age 84 at the hospice center. Shirley Phelps-Roper said it was “none of your business” when asked if members of the Phelps’ family were present at his death.\n\nMargie Jean Phelps said there would be no funeral for her father."
