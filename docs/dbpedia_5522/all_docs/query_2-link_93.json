        "text": "Ward\n\nThe name \"Ward\" is Irish in origin. But the surname was first county Galway where they held a family seat from ancient times. The ancient Gaelic form of the Irish name was \"Mac an Bhaird,\" which means \"son of the bard.\" The Coat of Arms features a blue shield with three gold crowns.\n\nOur branch of the family begins with JAMES LEMILL (or LEMUEL) WARD (nicknamed \"Jeems\") was born on 25 Mar 1758 in Agusta or Giles Co., Virginia. (His daughter Sarah's death record list her parents as being born in Giles, Virginia.) The ancestry of James is extremely confusing. Many list his father as WILLIAM WARD was born in 1725, in Inishowen Peninsula, County Dunegal, Ireland. He immigrated to the American colonies in 1730, arriving in Philadelphia at the age of five, with parents, siblings, his grandfather, and uncle. In 1758, he was in the Augusta County, Virginia, militia, with brothers Joseph and James Jr., as well as his father and uncle. He also lived in South Carolina for a time, according to land warrants. Between 1756 and 1757, he was a Sgt. in Ranger Company 4. In 1779, he participated in the Committee of Peace, in Botetourt Co, VA. He married ELIZABETH THOMPSON (born about 1731 in Ireland) and supposedly had \"Jeems\"... except until this: William died on 15 Aug 1795 in Lexington, Fayette Co. (Harrison), Kentucky, and this petition was filed a few decades later:\n\nCHARLES WARD HEIRS vs WARD HEIRS\n\n12 March 1830 Petition for sale of land of WILLIAM WARD: In a petition for the sale of lands belong to WILLIAM WARD who died in Harrison Co, KY intestate leaving neither wife, nor child, nor children. William Ward came from Greenbrier County, Virginia and left the following brothers and sisters: JOHN, JOSEPH, ISAAC, JAMES,and BENJAMIN, SUSAN who married JOHN CARTMEL, POLLY who married WILLIAM THOMPSON, ELIZABETH who married JOHN JAMESON, and REBECCA who married SAMUEL JAMESON. All of the brothers and sisters except SUSAN CARTMEL were dead as was her husband. JOSEPH WARD, brother of the said WILLIAN WARD, left the following children to wit: JOHN, GEORGE, WILLIAM, ANDREW, JOSEPH, JAMES, the petitioner CHARLES, BENJAMIN WARD, NANCY & REBECCA WARD. (Harrison County, Kentucky Box 38, 383 NO 11746.)\n\nSo was William Ward not our ancestor? Another possibility is NATHAN WARD,¹ who was christened on 12 Feb 1713 according to records in Saint Barnabas Church, Queen Anne Parish, Prince Georges, Maryland. Nathan was believed to be the son of James and Susanna Ward. Nathan married a woman named MARGARET (b. 1713) according to the Queen Anne Parish Records, in Prince George's Co., Maryland. Nathan died on 14 Mar 1803 Grayson County, Virginia, and was probably buried in family cemetery on the his farm, although no stone has ever been found. His will was probated in March of 1803 and names his wife and children: William, Wells, Nathan and Enoch... again, no Jeems! So who was the real father of James Ward? Fortunately the science of genetics has given us an answer: Nathan.²\n\nAnyway, back to \"Jeems.\" His Ward family, such as it was, is described in an excerpt from EARLY FAMILIES OF EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY by Kozee: \"Ward of Johnson County\" This branch of the family came to valley soon after the first settlement on Sandy. James Ward was the pioneer of the family. He settled on Rockhouse Creek, then Floyd, Martin and Johnson Counties. The family is one of the most numerous in Eastern Kentucky. They have all along been noted for quiet dispositions and good citizenship. The pioneers were noted hunters, having all along been trained in Indian warfare. Among them have been preachers, professional men and public officials. In religion, they were generally Baptists; in politics Democrats. A notable characteristic was the naming of their children after ancestors. Of \"Jim\" (James) Wards there have been a large number and in order to distinguish them they were given nicknames. Hence, there were \"Bigfoot,\" \"Nine Toes,\" \"White Head,\" \"Bit Nose,\" \"Jimper,\" \"Little Jim,\" \"Jim's Jim,\" Etc.\n\nIn 1776, Montgomery County, Virginia, was formed taking in the old county of Fincastle. The Ward family continued living on Coal (Cole) Creek, but now in the new county. 1776 also marked the beginning of the Revolutionary War in Southwest Virginia and the Ward family joined their neighbor Enoch Osborn's Company of Montgomery County Militia. James Ward served as a private and was listed as present of the rolls for 1777, 2 April 1783 and 1785. His brother Wells Ward was included on the 1783 and 1785 rosters while Nathan Ward was listed in 1783 and 1785. (Note: This was probably Nathan Ward, Junior, since Nathan Ward, Senior. would have been 72 years old in 1785). (New River Notes, by Jeff Weaver, \"Revolutionary War SoldiersUpper New River Valley\") Also in Captain Enoch Osborn's Company was Solomon Osborn. James Ward married Sarah Osborn, Solomon's daughter, about 1770. As a member of Capt. Enoch Osborn's Company, James Ward and his family members took part in the Battle of King's Mountain on 7 October 1780. This American victory turned the tide against the British in the South and led to the eventual withdrawal of the British from the frontier.\n\nJames Lemill Ward founded the town of Louisa, Lawrence County, Kentucky, then moved into Floyd County in about 1803, finally settling in Rockhouse Creek with his wife SARAH \"SALLY\" OSBURN (OSBOURNE) of Giles County, Virginia. They had the following children:\n\nCHILDREN OF JAMES LEMILL WARD AND SARAH OSBURN\n\nSOLOMON WARD was born in 1775 in Russell Co., VA.

He is buried at the Old Ward Cemetery in Offutt, Johnson County, Kentucky.\n\nWILLIAM BENTON WARD was only about 13 years of age when the migration from Russell County, Virginia took place.

The marriage was performed 11 January 1816, by Samuel Hanna who indicated \"mg\" for minister of the gospel, but indicated no denomination. William and Elizabeth Meek Ward made their home some where on the river in a location near the present community of River or Offutt, Kentucky. Using census figures to calculate their dates of birth, William Ward was born in virginia ca 1792 and died in Johnson County before 1860, as Elizabeth appears as a widow on the census for that year.

In that year, Nathan, now aged 58, and his son James Ward were listed as privates in Captain William Herbertâs Company of Boutetourt County Militia along with John Cox, William Cox and Robert, Enoch and Johnathan Osborn.\" (Wythe County, Virginia Historical Review #13, \"Captain William Herbert\" by Mary B. Kegley). Although most of the men in the company were Quakers, the Wards were not and continued to serve in Herbert's and Captain John Montgomeryâs companies of militia until the end of Lord Dunmore's War in 1774. By that time Fincastle County had been created from Botetourt County and Nathan, Wells, James and Zachariah Ward were serving in the Fincastle Militia and fought against the Indians at the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. Also in the company were Enoch, Ephraim, Jonathan, Robert and Stephen Osborn along with Daniel, William and James Blevins. (Henderson, Archibald, The Conquest of the Old Southwest, Century Company, New York, 1920).\n\n²John Britton Wells III: \"I am the grandson of Jennie Ward who married my grandfather, John Britton Wells, Sr., on October 10, 1902, in Johnson County, Kentucky. Jennie was the daughter of William Jefferson Ward, the granddaughter of Shadrach Ward and the great granddaughter of James 'Lemuel' Ward. James 'Lemuel' Ward settled in Floyd (now Johnson) County, Kentucky, in the first years of the 19th century and died there about 1808 at his home on 'Old House Branch' in the modern community of Offutt. His wife was Sarah Osborn(e), the daughter of Solomon Osborn(e). (Note that I use the middle name of 'Lemuel' with quotation marks because there is no proof that my ancestor James Ward had that middle name other than a single reference in C. Mitchel Hall's Johnson County, Kentucky: A History of the County and Genealogy of Its People Up to the Year 1927, published in 1928. I will use the name in this article only to distinguish him from several contemporaries with the same first name.)\"\n\n\"For generations, little has been discovered about the identity of James 'Lemuel' Ward. The difficulty arises from the fact that there were several, apparently unrelated men by the name of James Ward who settled in Southwest Virginia during the last half of the 18th century. There have been attempts to connect James 'Lemuel' Ward to the David Ward family of Russell County, Virginia, but no documentation of such a connection has been offered. A birthdate of 1758 has also been attributed to James 'Lemuel' Ward, but this date is actually for a different man by the same name who was born in Fincastle County, Virginia, and died in Lawrence County, Kentucky, in 1848. The other man's birthdate is proved by a statement in his Revolutionary War pension application (Pension #W1105). The fact that there was another James Ward living so close to James 'Lemuel' Ward has resulted in several genealogical errors. Because of the recent development of sophisticated Y-DNA testing as described above, the descendants of James 'Lemuel' Ward have been able to solve the mystery of our origin with complete scientific accuracy, something that the available historical documentation has been unable to do. My male second cousin, also a direct descendant of William Jefferson Ward, Shadrach Ward and James 'Lemuel' Ward, submitted to a Y-DNA test through Family Tree DNA (www.ftdna.com). His results are an exact match for the descendants of Nathan Ward who was born in Prince George's County, Maryland, in 1713. Surprisingly, the Y-DNA results also appear to prove that this Nathan Ward was the illegitimate son of a man named George Wells, also from Prince George's County! The Y-DNA results for James 'Lemuel' Ward are published in two Family Tree DNA group projects, one for the Wells family (Wells Y-DNA project [W006] descendants of Thomas Wells, born 1653 England) and the other for the Ward family (Ward Y-DNA Project [Ward Subgroup #17] descendants of Nathan Ward, born 1713 Maryland). They are perfect and/or near perfect matches for each other. The results as of 11 July 2016 are shown below:\n\nYDNA COMPARISON: WARD & WELLS FAMILIES\n\nEARLIEST DOCUMENTED DIRECT MALE ANCESTORHAPLOGROUP Jeremiah C.

G-M201>G-M286 are all from the same haplogroup. G-M286 is a more detailed generational mutation of G-M201. These mutations are results of more extensive individual Y-DNA testing.\n\n\"Both the Wells W006 group and the Ward Subgroup #17 exhibit exactly the same Y-DNA results which means that both families must share a single common male ancestor. The Ward Subgroup #17, which includes James 'Lemuel' Ward, traces their 'Ward' ancestry to Nathan Ward who lived in Southwest Virginia, but was born on 12 February 1713 in Prince George's County, Maryland. His birth is recorded in the Saint Barnabas (Anglican) Church register in Queen Anne Parish. His parents' names are given as James and Susanna Ward.\n\n\"The Saint Barnabas Church record is perplexing in that the Y-DNA results show clearly that Nathan Ward was also the direct male descendant of Thomas 'Wells,' born about 1653 in England. A further examination of the Saint Barnabas Church registers and Prince George's County deeds coupled with the Y-DNA results provide the solution to the Ward family 'mystery' that has remained hidden for over two hundred years.\n\n\"The listed parents of Nathan Ward, James and Susanna Ward, are found in a Prince George's County deed dated 10 December 1714 in which 'James Ward of Prince George's County 'planter' and Susannah his wife lately called Susannah Swanson of the one part [sell to] George Wells of the afsd county 'planter' ... land called 'Swanson (Swansea) Lott' in Prince George's County' (Prince George's County, MD Deed Book E, pages 331-332). George Wells, born c. 1685, was not only a neighbor of James and Susanna Ward, but he was also the son of Thomas Wells, born 1653 in England, the same Thomas Wells who appears in the Y-DNA group as a genetic match for Nathan Ward. It appears that James Ward either left his wife or died before 30 March 1719. On that date the vestry of Queen Anne Parish 'ordered that the clerk summon George Wells and Susanna Ward to attend the vestry on Sunday the 12th April after the sermon touching their living lewdly and uncontinently together.' (Queen Anne Vestry Minutes, Prince George's County, Maryland, page 60). Page 61 of the Vestry Minutes records that on '12 April 1719 then appeared George Wells and Susanna Ward and were admonished by the vestry not to cohabit together nor frequent each others company.' Apparently, the scandalous behavior of George Wells and Susannah Ward had been going on for some time and was common knowledge. When Thomas Wells, Jr., the father of George, died his will dated 26 September 1718 provided land for his wife Francis and all of his children except George to whom he left a paltry 5 Shillings (Maryland Calendar of Wills, Volume 14, page 724).\n\n\"The fate of James Ward is unknown, but George Wells finally married Susanna Ward on 16 June 1725 (Queen Anne Parish Register). Either James Ward was dead by that date or he had been declared officially to have abandoned his wife, allowing her to remarry in the church.\"\n\n(The above information from \"THE STORY OF THE WARD FAMILY OF JOHNSON COUNTY, KENTUCKY\" by John Britton Wells III in Highland Echo, Volume 36, Number 132, 2016; a Publication of the Johnson County Historical & Genealogical Society, P.O.

Hattie died about 1906. Grandpa sold the house to his brother Elliott and built another for his second wife Maudie (my grandma). This old (now) abandoned house is known to my family as 'The Old Ghost House.' The stories that were passed down thru the years would scare you half to death. Different generations of Wards always lived in the old ghost house, it was finally abandoned about twenty years ago. When I was young I loved the scary stories that the family would tell about things that happened in that old house. I am sure, the stories would grow with each storyteller. I must have done a good job retelling the stories. My 21 yr. old granddaughter was so excited to see this old ghost house and take this picture. Her Great Uncle Lanny went with her to take the picture. She was truly convinced that I was too scared to go near the house. The real truth was............I am not scared of the old Ward Ghost House but seeing a SNAKE in those tall weeds would have made ME the newest ghost story for that old house!\"\n\nGENEALOGY\n\nJAMES LEMILL WARD (b. 25 Mar 1758) married SARAH \"SALLY\" OSBURN (OSBOURNE) and begat...\n\nWILLIAM WARD (b. 1792), who married ELIZABETH MEEK (b. 1804) and begat...\n\nJAMES \"BIGFOOT\" WARD (b.
