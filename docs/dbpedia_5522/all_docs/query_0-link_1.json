        "text": "Centre for Inquiry Calgary · Cranbook, British Columbia\n\nNate Phelps is the son of Pastor Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church, which gained infamy from their protests at soldiers’ funerals around the United States. He is the sixth of thirteen children, and was taught his father’s extreme version of Calvinism from an early age. This was accompanied by extreme physical punishments and abuse, extreme dietary and health requirements, and other extreme expectations. Nate left home at midnight on his eighteenth birthday, and moved to California where he built a new life away from his family. He later moved to Canada, and only recently began speaking out about his story after a chance encounter with a reporter while driving a cab in Cranbrook, British Columbia. Nate has now spoken about his story to many groups around North America, and even returned home to Topeka in 2010 to tell his story to the people in his hometown. Nate is a former ED of Calgary’s Centre for Inquiry. He is a co-founder of the Alberta Secular Conference and currently lives in Cranbrook, British Columbia. He also serves on the board of directors for Recovering from Religion. He is a vocal LGBT advocate, and speaks out against the dangers of religion and child abuse. He is currently working on a book that covers his exceptional story and is the subject of an upcoming documentary film.\n\nNate requests an honorarium of $250.\n\nContact Nate Phelps >>\n\nTopics: Activism & Organizing, Atheism & Secularism, Religion\n\nSubtopics: Coming out atheist, Community group organizing, Leaving religion, Religious extremism\n\nViewpoints and information presented by speakers do not necessarily reflect the viewpoints of, nor should they be attributed to, CFI or its affiliates, or any of their directors or officers."
