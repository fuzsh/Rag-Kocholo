        "text": "Even if you’re not steak nerds like us, there’s a good chance you’ve heard of or had a Delmonico steak. This legendary steak staple is served all around the country and is known to be delicious, tender, and rich. What exactly a Delmonico steak is, however, is more of a debate than you may realize.\n\nBuckle up. This story is meaty.\n\nWhat is a Delmonico steak?\n\nAs it turns out, a Delmonico steak isn’t actually a particular cut. Back in the mid-19th century, New York’s first premier steak house, Delmonico’s Restaurant located in lower Manhattan, used to serve up the original Delmonico steak. The thing is, the Delmonico steak just happened to be whatever the butcher thought was best that night. The cooking method remained mainly the same, but the cut itself would change.\n\nThis name is possibly due to a famous importer socialite whose last name was Delmonico and who would create elaborate meals with “whatever the best” ingredients and meats could be found [*]. In other words, Delmonico became a bit of a slang way of saying “the best”.\n\nThis variability is the source of confusion for steak lovers everywhere, resulting in over eight different cuts being labeled by experts as the Delmonico cut [*].\n\nHere are the eight cuts that various butchers, restaurants, and chefs typically label as Delmonico steak:\n\nLast boneless chuck-eye steak\n\nAny bone-in rib steak\n\nAny bone-in rib-eye\n\nFirst boneless rib-eye\n\nAny boneless rib-eye\n\nFirst bone-in top loin steak\n\nAny bone-in top loin steak\n\nAny boneless top loin steak\n\nSo who is correct? Steak Perfection has a theory after reviewing historical interviews with two 19th-century head chefs at the original Delmonico’s. After careful analysis, they think that the historical fact is that the original, authentic Delmonico steak is, in modern terms, the first boneless top loin steak cut from the front of (anterior to) the short loin.\n\nBut, sometimes the historical fact isn’t as useful when it’s not what most people know. With that in mind, this is what is common across Delmonico steaks:\n\nThey are usually rib or short loin.\n\nThey are broiled or quickly grilled.\n\nThey are usually cut at least an inch and a half thick and often go beyond two inches.\n\nIf you go to Delmonico’s and order their Delmonico steak, you’ll get a rib-eye that’s been brushed with melted butter and beef fat and cooked via a fast broil. Many restaurants emulate this cooking method when serving a Delmonico.\n\nIt’s also common to top Delmonico steaks with a compound herb butter, and while it’s more traditional to broil a Delmonico, many chefs will grill them as well. In the end, the focus should be on the meat. While some restaurants deck out their Delmonico steaks with sauces and lots of toppings, we prefer to keep it simple.\n\nAre Delmonico steaks dry-aged or wet-aged?\n\nWhile dry-aged steaks are in vogue these days, Delmonico steaks are traditionally wet-aged. This means they are usually vacuum-sealed in plastic and aged for 4-10 days as opposed to dry-aging, where butchers hang cuts just above freezing for weeks or even months to get rid of water content and concentrate the flavor.\n\nBoth forms of preparation are delicious in their own right, but if you want the traditional Delmonico experience, it needs to be wet-aged. That’s because wet-aged steaks are juicier, which is what we associate with Delmonicos.\n\nMost steaks you buy are wet-aged anyway, so unless they specifically say dry-aged you will be getting a wet-aged steak.\n\nHow to cook Delmonico steak\n\nIn order to cook a Delmonico steak, you’ll want to fast broil it and brush it with butter and beef fat. The key is to get your broiler as hot as possible, buy the best steak you can, and nail the timing.\n\nHere’s how we like to cook our Delmonico steaks:\n\nSet your steaks out and let them come to room temperature. Sponge any moisture as needed.\n\nPut a broiler pan in your oven and get your broiler ripping hot. Try to place the rack and pan as close to the broiler as possible, too. 4 to six inches is perfect. High heat is the name of the game here!\n\nSeason your steak — at a bare minimum this is rubbing it down with oil, salt, and pepper, although you could take this in any direction you want — e.g. lime salt and vegetable oil for a Latin twist or your favorite rub.\n\nScore the fat on your steaks a few times to prevent the steak from curling.\n\nPut your steaks on the broiler pan and cook for around 3 and a half minutes on each side or until you are 5-10 degrees from your desired temperature.\n\nTake it out and either feel test or use an instant-read thermometer.\n\nLet rest for 5 minutes to let the meat relax, brush with melted butter and beef fat from the bottom of the broiler pan, cut against the grain, and serve on warm plates.\n\nThat’s it! If you stick to those basics you will walk out with an irresistible steak.\n\nDelmonico steak recipes\n\nHere are a few other recipes that slightly vary by searing method or seasonings. There’s no one right way, so get your Delmonico steak, take your pick, and get cooking!\n\n1. Broiled Delmonico steak with herb butter\n\nThis compound butter really puts this recipe over the edge. It really is fantastic, and you can make a bunch of the butter to have around for future Delmonico steaks. That butter is also great on roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes!\n\n2. Grilled Delmonico steak with herb butter\n\nThis is similar to the first recipe but gives you advice on how to grill a Delmonico steak if that’s what you’re in the mood for. Remember to get your grill as hot as you can before you start cooking.\n\n3. Michael Jordan’s 23 Delmonico steak\n\nThis recipe gets a bit more experimental by adding mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. If you want to step away a bit from a straight-ahead steak night, then this is for you.\n\nWhere to buy Delmonico steak\n\nAgain, that depends on your definition of a Delmonico steak. You could argue that a Delmonico steak is whatever a butcher gives you after asking them for their best cut of the day. You could also ask a butcher for any of the cuts listed above, or you can order any farm’s Delmonico steak with the knowledge that it’s one of their favorite cuts.\n\nTake our Delmonico steak, for example. Our take on the 1800’s culinary delight is a bone-in cut originating from the short loin, which produces an unbelievably tender steak.\n\nWe proudly teamed up with a group of elite grass farmers from the Island of Tasmania (off the coast of Australia) for this short loin cut, and as soon as you taste this steak you’ll know why. The climate in Tasmania is a utopia for cattle because of the year-round maritime climate buffered by the Southern Ocean, and their air quality is recognized as the gold standard for purity.\n\nEach of our Delmonico steaks average 14 ounces and are made from 100% grass-fed, non-GMO, non-antibiotic, completely-natural beef.\n\nIf you want to win your steak night, then this is the cut.\n\nStoring Delmonico steak\n\nYou can just follow conventional steak storage advice here. You’ve got about 3-5 days in the fridge and a few months in the freezer depending on the temperature and how well you store it.\n\nIn general, it’s best to:\n\nRemove it from the grocery store packaging.\n\nUse butcher’s paper, freezer bags, or even better — vacuum seal it.\n\nQuick freeze it when you can. This reduces the time ice has to build on the steak.\n\nAvoid using plastic wrap — it will develop freezer burn faster than the other methods mentioned.\n\nIf you stick to that advice you should have no problem eating your steaks before they go bad. We can barely keep them in our house for two days!\n\nThe bottom line on Delmonico steak\n\nModern chefs have different definitions of the Delmonico steak, but the most historically accurate cut is the first boneless top loin steak cut from the front of (anterior to) the short loin. Regardless of what specific cut you get, Delmonico steaks are typically thick-cut, fast-broiled, and brushed with butter and beef fat.\n\nYour best bet for a perfect Delmonico steak is to follow a good recipe and buy the best Delmonico steak possible. The way you do that is by knowing your farm and source, buying non-GMO, and finding a butcher who knows how to cut a great Delmonico.\n\nLucky for you, we’re exactly who you’ve been looking for. You won’t find a better Delmonico steak in the country, we guarantee it.\n\nTry our elite Tasmanian Delmonico Steaks cut by our expert butchers.\n\nNathan Phelps\n\nNathan Phelps is a writer, ethical foodie, and outdoors-aficionado hailing from Nashville, TN.
