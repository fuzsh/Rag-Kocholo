        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO — It’s hard to predict which Olympic swimmers will break out and become household names.\n\nAn insane number of medals, like Michael Phelps has, will do it. So will pure dominance, as Katie Ledecky has demonstrated. Or talking trash and backing it up, a la Lilly King.\n\nBut what about a 6-6, six-time Olympic medalist who looks like a model? A U.S. team captain who can make everyone laugh? Nathan Adrian is the star next door. But why isn’t he a superstar on par with Phelps or Ryan Lochte?\n\n“I just think it’s always like who sets the paradigm,” said Cal coach Dave Durden, Adrian’s personal coach and an assistant for the U.S. Olympic team. “Michael Phelps set the paradigm. This is what it looks like to be in this elite stratosphere. There’s so much good that comes with that because Michael’s brought a lot of attention, a lot of money to the sport, a lot of opportunities for guys that have come in behind him to capitalize off that.\n\n\"I think the difficult thing is if you look at Nathan or even a guy like (2012 100-meter backstroke gold medalist) Matt Grevers, these are guys that are gold medalists, but they’re in a singular event as a gold medalist. It’s like to get into that superstardom, you’re going to have to bring home six or seven medals.”\n\nYes, it’s a high bar to clear. And the person has to want to clear it.\n\nWhich isn’t really Adrian’s personality.\n\nYes, he has big-name sponsors, from Speedo to Coca-Cola to BMW and Tommy Hilfiger. But he doesn’t seek out microphones or the spotlight. His favorite social media platform is Snapchat, because it’s more real and less Photoshopped than any of the others.\n\nThe post-London Olympics media circuit and the whirlwind accompanying his breakthrough there left him dazed.\n\n“I was doing my best to live in the moment and be really present with everywhere where I was,” Adrian said. “I didn’t really think about it, and then just afterward it was like, ‘Wow.’ All these people want pictures. You get recognized on the street or you go on a nighttime TV show. Someone wants you to go on and do this or that. It’s just like — ‘surreal’ is such an overused word for it — but when it happens it happens so quickly that you never get a chance to fully understand or fully analyze how it happened.”\n\nSo does he seek the level of stardom that Phelps has reached? Or desire the mobs that have followed Lochte around since he had his own reality show?\n\n“I would never,” Adrian said. “I don’t do this for that at all. I just want to swim fast, that’s all. That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. That’s what’s fun about swimming.”"
