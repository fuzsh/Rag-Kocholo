        "text": "Going Nuclear! Happy to announce that this week I started as Leader of the MEH Joint venture on Hinkley Point C with AltradBabcock. MEH JV is an alliance partnership between EdF and five of the main UK industrial construction companies (Altrad, Altrad Babcock, Balfour Beatty Kilpatrick, Cavendish Nuclear and NG Bailey) HPC is currently the biggest power construction project in Europe and paves the way for the nuclear reboot in the UK at a time where low carbon energy is in short supply. With so many new nuclear projects planned its an incredible time to join this industry and we are recruiting 😉 There are many similarities between HPC and what I just left behind in Africa. Long cycle high profile project, contributing significantly to the economy, playing a big part in development of the next generation of people and skills where we need to invest for the next couple of decades I want to thank Cameron Gilmour, Paudie Somers and the MEH JV partners for your trust and to Stuart Crookes & Nigel Cann for the opportunity to join the MEH Alliance HPC is an amazing project with an incredible team and I look forward to getting going. Its also great to see so many familiar faces from past projects.

During my time with GEC/Alstom/GE I was able to work across four continents, building power plants, building teams and harnessing diverse cultures across time zones.In my last role I was lucky to lead the “best” and most purposeful business being Steam Power Africa for a decade and navigate it through some of the biggest projects the company has ever seen, to localise and shape a sustainable services business thereafter. We trained >1000 engineers, we built schools and colleges, we developed small local suppliers from diverse backgrounds, we built the biggest projects ever …that are unlikely to be repeated! I met national presidents and global CEO’s, trade unionists and bankers, ambassadors and ministers …artisans, school kids, apprentices and graduates and made many friendships. Throughout this time I learnt about inequality and race and diversity of culture, of optimism and of the infinite potential of Africa and its peoples. Only change was constant, change of company name, change of owners, change of leaders, change of culture, change of people and ultimately change of strategy. I had the privilege to work with and learn from strong and often courageous leaders and peers who I continue to have the upmost respect for and even though most have left the company, they remain firm friends. During my time in GE, I was involved with some incredible projects each having its own unique team identity and challenges: Medupi, Kusile, Koeberg, Kendal, Lethabo, Staythorpe, Langage, Kwinana, Runcorn, Slough, Sual., Connah’s Quay, Shajiao C, Majuba, Ling Ao, Daya Bay and many, many more, it was an incredible experience. It’s now time to take a new challenge, return home , dive into the energy transition and to pay it forward. Thanks to everyone I worked with and to all those that helped me on the journey Andreas Lusch Philippe Cochet Philippe JOUBERT patrick KRON Steve Bolze Scott Strazik Andrew DeLeone Martin Boller Matthias Schweinfest Michael Keroullé Bill Torrance GE Africa Mark Hutchinson Didier FarezDidier Pfleger Gregoire Poux-Guillaume Gert Overgaard Alain MericDarren EaglandRoger RohrerAlistair Scott-FarrisJoe Earl-SpurrMark ChilcoteFrédéric Wiscart Stuart Connor Valerie MarjolletGérard SalomezLeif TimmermannTurc GuillaumeJay Ireland Matthew ForrestJohn BurkeNigel Wild Elisée SezanJan OberholzerKuseni DlaminiCraig RichardsPredrag PetrovicRolf Bachmann\n\nThis week marks my last week as President of the American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa and the end of a three year tenure. I want to express my gratitude for what has been an incredible experience, sitting on a \"stellar\" board learning from the best of US business in Africa, building close relationships with US and SA government and being part of a wonderful and hard working Amcham team. It’s been a privilege to serve with you all in what has been quite a turbulent period.During this time Angela Russell and I worked hard to reboot the platform and the brand, we simplified the proposition to a network, a voice and a trusted advisor to American business. Which we felt captured best what our members wanted from the chamber. We navigated COVID, kept the membership and managed three thanksgiving dinners. We moved the Amcham headquarters into GIBS Business School (Gordon Institute of Business Science) to connect with the best and brightest and to give us an incredible venue for meetings & thought leadership. We launched the digital platform to drive engagement and growth. I have enjoyed every minute and I am proud to hand over the reins to the new team. From immediate effect Phillipine Mtikitiki from Coca Cola will take over as President , Phillipine is a respected leader across Africa and was previously Chair of Amcham Kenya. As joint vice Presidents , we welcome Cicelia Van Rooi from DOW Southern Africa and Robyn De Villiers from The Three C’s who will remain in place. In addition we welcome Michelle Constant (MPhil - Strategy, GIBS UP) as CEO , Michelle is an accomplished journalist, communicator and recently graduated MPhil from GIBS. This is a formidable team ready to take the chamber to the next level and I cant wait to see what comes next. Thank you for all your support over the years.
