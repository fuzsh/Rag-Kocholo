        "text": "Profile\n\nNathan is a Ph.D. student in English at the University of Notre Dame. He studies Middle English literature with a focus on new materialisms, sound, and ecocriticism. His current project is interested in the way that sound and aurality create marvelous or proleptic tensions in Middle English romances like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. He is also interested in medieval concepts (like marvels) that resonate with Jane Bennett's ideas about vibrant matter."
