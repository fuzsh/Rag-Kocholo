        "text": "Michael Phelps closed out the Rio Olympics in the only way imaginable.\n\nGolden.\n\nPhelps put the United States ahead to stay on the butterfly leg of the 4×100-meter medley relay and Nathan Adrian finished it off, giving the most decorated athlete in Olympic history his 23rd career gold medal Saturday night.\n\nIf that was the end, and Phelps insists it is, what a way to go.\n\nHe has 28 medals overall, having won five golds and a silver at these games.\n\nAs Adrian touched the wall to finish off the victory, Phelps gathered the other relay swimmers, Ryan Murphy and Cody Miller, in his arms. One night after his only setback in Rio, an upset loss to Joseph Schooling in the 100 fly, Phelps was back on top.\n\nIn the stands, his fiancee, Nicole Johnson, bounced along to the music with their son, 3-month-old Boomer, cradled in her arms.\n\nMost of the U.S. swim team was in the stands to watch Phelps’ finale, including the biggest female star of the games, Katie Ledecky.\n\nTwo-time gold medalist Murphy put the Americans out front with a world-record split on the backstroke — it counts since he was leading off — but Britain surged ahead on the breaststroke with its own world-record holder, Adam Peaty.\n\nPhelps dove into the pool in second place.\n\nHe wouldn’t be for long.\n\nOn the return lap, Phelps powered through the water with his whirling butterfly stroke, surging ahead of James Guy to pass off a lead to the anchor Adrian.\n\nIt wasn’t in doubt after that. Adrian pulled away on the freestyle to win in an Olympic-record time of 3 minutes, 27.95 seconds. Britain held on for silver, with Australia nabbing bronze.\n\nPhelps started his run to being the most celebrated Olympian of all time back in Sydney in 2000, when he made the U.S. team as a 15-year-old out of Maryland, gaining the moniker of “The Baltimore Bullet.” Yet the hardware starting coming four years later in Athens, when he won six gold medals, two bronze, and set three world records.\n\nYet it was at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing when Phelps started climbing the pantheon of greats. He participated in eight events, and won gold in every one, surpassing Mark Spitz’s previous record of seven golds in one games. Four years later in London, it was almost a piling on, winning four more golds and two silvers.\n\nSo he came into these games already as the most decorated swimmer of all time. He seemingly has gotten over some of his personal daemons — which included a picture of him using a bong to smoke marijuana at the University of South Carolina back in 2009, then his second DUI arrest in 2014 that got him suspended from the U.S. team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships.\n\nYet after a stint in rehab, the 31-year-old Phelps re-established his reputation at this games. He was the undisputed leader of the Americans heading to Rio, carrying the flag at the opening ceremony. Golfer Rickie Fowler even sought him out at the ceremony to take a selfie.\n\nThen more dominance came in the pool, where Phelps always has been most comfortable. He went into Saturday night with 26 career medals and 22 career gold medals — both Olympic records in any sport. By winning the 200-meter individual medley Thursday, Phelps collected his 13th solo gold medal, breaking a 2,168-year-old record held by Leonidas of Rhodes.\n\nAnd now those are the only types of names Phelps can be compared to. A long career has made him the best swimmer of all time, and the most accomplished Olympian of all time. He rewrote the record books, and now that’s where he will remain.\n\nGold medal in women’s medley"
