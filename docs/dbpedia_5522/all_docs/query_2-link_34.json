        "text": "“ If anything happens to either of them, there's no place on Earth where you or your God will be safe from me. There's no place that I won't go to kill you. That is written. ”\n\n–Ethan Hunt, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning\n\nEthan Matthew Hunt (born August 18, 1964) is the main protagonist of the Mission: Impossible film series. He is a senior field agent for the Impossible Mission Force, an elite, top-secret espionage and covert operations agency that handles dangerous and highly sensitive international missions that have been deemed \"impossible\".\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nEthan Matthew Hunt was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the only child of Margaret Ethan and Nathan Hunt. He was raised on a dairy farm in Middleton, New York. After high school, Ethan went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a double major in Engineering and International Relations. Upon graduating from Pennsylvania, he joined the Army. Ethan commissioned for the military occupational specialty, Infantry, and decided that he would become an Army Ranger, going to the Ranger Indoctrination Program. Upon graduation of RIP, he was placed in the 3rd Battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Daniel David Briggs. Ethan eventually fought in combat during Operation Desert Storm. After five distinguished years in the Army, Ethan gained an honorable discharge.\n\nAfter his discharge, he immediately sought employment with the Central Intelligence Agency. Before Ethan could join the Agency, he had to go through background checks, take the entrance exam, and go through a series of interviews and psychological tests. Upon passing the entrance and psychological examinations or be imprisoned on March 22, 1993, Ethan was contacted by Colonel Briggs, who had joined the CIA in a high-level position a few years before and he believed Ethan would be perfect for an organization outside of the Agency. In short order, he was recruited into an ultra-secret agency called the Impossible Mission Force.\n\nAlthough he was initially only told that he would be tasked with \"unconventional black ops\", Ethan exuberantly accepted the job offer. Afterwards he was informed of IMF's mandate. He then went through an intensive operational training course to train him in so-called \"operational intelligence\" or \"tradecraft\" skills, including surveillance, clandestine photography, infiltration, and extraction techniques. He was also trained for night parachuting, tactical high speed emergency driving, rappelling from helicopters, and dry and wet demolition. Because of his military experience, Ethan excelled through training.\n\nOnce he completed training, he was given the \"cover legend\" of a systems analyst for the U.S. Department of Transportation and placed in a five-person team (called an \"IM Force\") as the team's point man. Led by Senior Agent James \"Jim\" Phelps, the team's job was to infiltrate secure installations, seize critical intelligence, destroy dangerous data or equipment, and neutralize the enemy as needed, without leaving a trace. The IMF is different than most intelligence organizations in that, once their orders have been given, there are no required procedures for the fulfillment of the mission. Therefore, Ethan and his fellow agents could use any means they deem necessary and success was all that matters. The downside was, of course, obvious; if a team member was either captured or killed, the Secretary of the IMF would disavow any knowledge of his or her actions.\n\nBetrayal[]\n\nJust a few months into his IMF career, Ethan's team assembles for a mission in Prague, Czech Republic, that would change Ethan's life dramatically. The directive of the mission is to prevent a U.S. diplomat named Alexander Golitsyn from selling the Non-Official Cover (NOC) list - a comprehensive list of all covert agents in Eastern Europe. The mission is inextricably wrong, resulting in the deaths of the team, leaving Ethan the sole survivor. Fleeing the scene, Ethan meets with Eugene Kittridge, the CIA-based director of the IMF, at a restaurant. The spy, very much in shock, is disturbed to learn from Kittridge that a mole, code-named Job, had infiltrated IMF, and that the Prague operation was meant to ferret Job out by allowing the mole to acquire the NOC list and attempt to sell it to \"Max\", an illegal arms dealer known for corrupting IMF agents. The NOC list in Prague was fake, the real list being held in CIA headquarters in Virginia. With Ethan the sole survivor, Kittridge believes he is the mole but he realizes this, and mounts a daring escape from the cafe, fleeing into Prague.\n\nEthan returns to the IMF safe house, where he discovers fellow IMF agent Claire Phelps, Phelps's wife, actually survived the mission. Ethan begins a correspondence with \"Max\" (a woman), explaining that the NOC list was a fake and offering to deliver the real NOC list in exchange for the identity of the mole. Max agrees to the deal and offers Ethan a cash advance, which the secret agent uses to assemble a team of disavowed former IMF agents, including computer specialist Luther Stickell and pilot Franz Krieger. The new team infiltrates the heavily fortified headquarters of the CIA in Langley and successfully steals a copy of the full NOC list before escaping to a safe house in London. Once there, Ethan discovers that his uncle and mother are been falsely arrested for drug trafficking in an attempt to lure him out. An infuriated Hunt contacts Kittridge, who offered to drop the false charges the moment he surrendered to authorities. Ethan hangs up, after allowing Kittridge to trace him to the London area, turns around and walks right into Jim Phelps.\n\nPhelps, presumed dead in the Prague operation, reveals that Kittridge is the mole and is tying up loose ends by trying to apprehend Ethan. Ethan reflects on this, while in reality piecing together the clues he discovers leading up to his operation and realizes that Phelps is the mole, Job. Ethan pretends to accept the story while being uncertain about Claire's place in the conspiracy. The next day, Max and Ethan arranges to meet aboard the TGV on route to Paris, with Claire and Luther aboard to provide backup. Kittridge is also aboard, having recently arrived in London and receives tickets for the TGV and a video watch from Ethan. In the train, Ethan delivers the supposed NOC list to Max, who directs him to the luggage compartment to find his money, and Job. Max then attempts to transmit the NOC list to a server, an operation hindered by Luther, who activates a jamming device to prevent the upload. Claire, observing Kittridge's presence aboard the train, vacates her seat and met with Phelps in the luggage car, confirming her part in the conspiracy. A silent \"Phelps\" slowly peels away his mask, revealing himself as Ethan. Suddenly, the real Phelps appears, armed and demanding the NOC list and the money. Ethan surrenders it before pulling out a pair of glasses. He slips them over his eyes, activating the camera inside and transmitting Phelps's image to Kittridge, proving beyond a doubt that Phelps is still alive.\n\nPhelps, now revealed as the traitor, shoots Claire in anger when she speaks against killing Ethan. He then beats Ethan down before escaping to the roof of the train, where Krieger, also a traitor, waits to extract him with his helicopter. Ethan recovers and follows Phelps, impedes his efforts to escape and tethers Krieger's helicopter to the train as it heads into the Channel Tunnel. The fight continues, with the helicopter now following the train inside the tunnel. The two fight continuously atop the wind-swept train before Phelps disconnects the helicopter from the train and attempts to escape. Ethan follows, leaps onto the helicopter's landing skids and attaches an explosive gum to the windshield. The ensuing explosion kills Phelps and Krieger, with Ethan narrowly escaping. Kittridge, now in possession of the NOC list and Max's true identity, drops his investigation against Ethan and reinstates Luther as an IMF agent.\n\nA little while later, as Ethan is on a plane flying home, a flight attendant approaches him and through a coded phrase asked if he's ready for another mission; because of his actions during the crisis, Ethan was promoted to the position of team leader. After being given the new cover legend of a traffic engineer who studies traffic patterns for the Virginia Department of Transportation, he officially becomes a \"senior field operations agent.\" Since then, Ethan Hunt becomes the Impossible Mission Force's premier field agent.\n\nChimera Mission[]\n\nIn March 1999[1], Ethan Hunt, while on holiday, is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist Russian molecular biologist, Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich, of Biocyte Pharmaceuticals to enter the United States, only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver a new biological weapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon, both of which he was forced to develop by Biocyte, into the IMF's hands. With his death, IMF is worried that the virus is out in the open, believing that rogue IMF agent Sean Patrick Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover it. Ethan is told that he can use two members of his team to help him, but the third person to help him must be Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain, as she will be able to get close to Ambrose, being an ex-girlfriend.\n\nAfter recruiting Nyah, Ethan meets two members of his team - computer specialist Luther Stickell and Australian pilot William Baird in Sydney where Biocyte laboratories are located along with Ambrose's residence. As Ethan and the others stake out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to work him for information related to the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose quietly meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy, and shows him a video of the Chimera virus affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues, taken from Biocyte, so he can blackmail McCloy into cooperating with them. Nyah is able to pocket the video footage long enough to transfer it to Ethan and his team, who learn that the Chimera virus has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death through mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can save the victim only if used within that 20-hour window.\n\nThe IMF team kidnaps McCloy and learns that Nekhorvich had actually injected himself with Chimera, the only way he could smuggle the virus from Biocyte, and had all the known samples of Bellerophon, now presently in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose had forced McCloy to sell him the virus for £37,000,000 in exchange for the samples of Bellerophon. Ethan's team plans to break into Biocyte and destroy the virus. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing Ethan's plan. Ambrose secures Nyah and prepares to raid Biocyte himself to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of the virus before Ambrose interrupts him, and a firefight ensues. Ethan learns that Ambrose is holding Nyah and stops firing, during which Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the last sample. When she does so, she injects herself with it, thus preventing Ambrose from simply killing her to get it. As Ambrose takes Nyah and Ethan escapes from the laboratory in the ensuing gun battle between Ambrose's men and Biocyte security personnel, Ethan starts a 20-hour countdown on his watch before the virus takes over Nyah's body.\n\nAmbrose opts to let Nyah wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to trigger a Chimera pandemic in Australia, and orders McCloy to effectively hand over enough control of Biocyte to make him the majority shareholder; Ambrose's plan is now to make a fortune when prices of Biocyte's stock skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon. Ethan's team is able to locate and infiltrate the meeting, stealing the samples of Bellerophon while taking out many of Ambrose's men. Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent Chimera from spreading. As the two IMF agents bring Nyah to Ethan, he and Ambrose engage in a fist fight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Ethan finally gains the upper hand over Ambrose and kills him, and Luther injects Nyah with Bellerophon. IMF clears Nyah's criminal record, and allows Ethan to continue his vacation with her in Sydney.\n\n[]\n\nIn 2006, Ethan Hunt has retired from field work and instead trains new IMF recruits while settling down with Julia Meade-Hunt, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. Ethan is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's proteges, Lindsey Farris, who was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell who are waiting in Berlin.\n\nThe team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee via helicopter, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp.\n\nIMF technician Benjamin Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the \"Rabbit's Foot\". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.\n\nOn the flight back to the U.S., Davian threatens to kill Ethan and his loved ones. Ethan then threatens to drop Davian out of the plane, during which Davian overhears Luther calling Ethan by his first name. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that she believes Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is suddenly attacked, and Davian escapes. Fearing for Julia's safety, Ethan races to the hospital, only to find she has already been taken. Davian gives Ethan 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life, but Ethan is soon captured by the IMF.\n\nMusgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation, but discreetly mouths that the Rabbit's Foot is located in Shanghai, China, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan and his team raid the building where the Rabbit's Foot is secured and inform Davian that they have the Rabbit's Foot. Ethan, delivering the Rabbit's Foot alone, is forced to take a tranquilizer. As he comes to, he realizes a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian apparently holding Julia at gunpoint (the full scene opens the movie). Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves.\n\nMusgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed by Davian was not Julia, but Davian's head of security in a mask, executed for failing to protect Davian in Vatican City. The Julia-mask was used to force Ethan to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit's Foot. The real Julia is alive and held as Davian's hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole, having arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot to sell to a terrorist group so the IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike. Musgrave asks Ethan about the microdot Lindsey sent, wanting to know if Lindsay had compromised him. To convince Ethan to cooperate, Musgrave dials his phone for Ethan to hear Julia's voice to confirm she is alive. Ethan bites on Musgrave's hand and knocks him unconscious, freeing himself, and uses Musgrave's phone (with Benji's help) to track down the location of Musgrave's last call.\n\nEthan reaches the hideout of Davian, beats two armed guards revealing the real Julia who is gagged. Davian intervenes, triggers the countdown of the micro-explosive in Ethan's head and savagely beats him, kicking and dragging him through the room. He then takes a pistol to kill Julia. Unfortunately for Davian, Ethan attacks him and gains the upper hand, knocking the terrorist through a wall into the street, where he is run over by a passing truck. Freeing Julia, Ethan instructs her to electrocute him, deactivate the explosive, and then revive him. He also instructs her in using a gun for her protection. While reviving Ethan, Julia fatally shoots Musgrave. She successfully revives Ethan, and he explains his true IMF career to her.\n\nBack in the U.S., Brassel congratulates Ethan as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia. Ethan is unsure if he will return to the IMF. Brassel promises that he will tell Ethan what the Rabbit's Foot is if Ethan will promise to return. Ethan smiles and walks off with Julia.\n\nEndangered Marriage[]\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, Ethan and Julia were both together in Croatia until Hunt realized that the only way to protect her from death was to fake it. Agent William Brandt was assigned to watch the family, following Ethan one day as he went for a jog. Brandt assigned two men to watch Julia before he left and after returning, he found them both unconscious and Julia missing. Days later, Brandt was told that what was left of Julia's body had been found. In apparent retaliation for his wife's murder, Hunt killed six Serbian nationalists linked to the crime, and was sent to Rankow Prison as a result. In reality, the IMF invented this cover to allow Hunt to infiltrate the prison, in the hopes of gaining information in regard to a terrorist code-named Cobalt. Julia, now safe, was kept in secret by Ethan, who had to keep his distance from her.\n\nDisavowed[]\n\nIn 2011, in the wake of the bombing of the Kremlin at the hands of Kurt Hendricks, Hunt and the entire IMF team was disavowed, and the remaining crew were branded as terrorists.\n\nOn assignment in Budapest to intercept a courier working for a person of interest code-named \"Cobalt\", IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed by an assassin named Sabine Moreau. Hanaway's team leader, Jane Carter, and newly promoted Benji Dunn extract Ethan Hunt and Hunt's source Bogdan from a Moscow prison. Hunt is recruited to lead Carter and Dunn to infiltrate the secret Moscow Kremlin archives and locate files identifying Cobalt. Partway through the mission, someone broadcasts across the IMF frequency, alerting the Russians to Hunt's team. Although Hunt, Dunn, and Carter escape, a bomb destroys the Kremlin, and Russian agent Anatoly Sidorov accuses Hunt of masterminding the attack.\n\nThe IMF extracts Hunt from Moscow. The Russians have called the attack an undeclared act of war, and the U.S. President activates \"Ghost Protocol\", a black operation contingency that disavows the entire IMF. Hunt and team are to take the blame for the attack, but they will be allowed to escape from government custody so that they may operate to track down Cobalt. Before Hunt can escape, the IMF's secretary is killed by Russian security forces led by Sidorov, leaving Hunt and intelligence analyst William Brandt to find their own way out. The team identifies Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist who believes the weak must die for the strong to survive, so he plans to start a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution. Hendricks bombed the Kremlin and acquired a Russian nuclear launch-control device, and now needs its codes from the Budapest courier in order to launch a nuclear missile at America.\n\nThe exchange between Moreau and Hendricks's right-hand man, Marius Wistrom, is due to take place at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. There, Hunt's team members separately convince Moreau and Wistrom that they have made the exchange with one another. However, Moreau identifies Brandt as an agent. While Hunt chases Wistrom — only to realize that Wistrom is actually Hendricks in disguise, escaping with the codes — Carter detains Moreau. Moreau attempts to kill the inexperienced Dunn, and Carter throws her out a window to her death. Brandt accuses Carter of compromising the mission for revenge against Moreau, but Hunt knows that Brandt is keeping secrets from them, as he has displayed fighting skills atypical of an analyst. While Hunt seeks more information from Bogdan, Brandt admits he was assigned as security detail to Hunt and his wife Julia while on assignment. Julia was killed by a Serbian hit squad, prompting Ethan to pursue and kill them before he was caught by the Russians and sent to prison.\n\nBogdan and his arms-dealing cousin inform Hunt that Hendricks will be in Mumbai. Hendricks facilitated the sale of a defunct Soviet military satellite to Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath, which could be used to transmit the order to fire a missile. While Brandt and Dunn infiltrate the server room to take the satellite offline, Carter gets Nath to reveal the satellite override code. However, Hendricks has anticipated Hunt's plan and takes Nath's servers offline before sending a signal from a television broadcasting station to a Russian submarine in the Pacific. The submarine fires a nuclear missile towards San Francisco. Hunt pursues Hendricks and the launch device while the other team members attempt to bring the broadcast station back online. Hunt and Hendricks fight over the launch-control device before Hendricks jumps to his death with it to ensure the missile's detonation. Dunn kills Wistrom, allowing Brandt to restore power to the station and enabling Hunt to deactivate the missile, while a dying Hendricks witnesses the failure of his plan. He is confronted by Sidorov, who sees Hunt has stopped the missile, proving the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.\n\nThe team reconvenes weeks later in Seattle. Hunt introduces the team to his former colleague Luther Stickell, and then issues them new assignments. Benji and Jane accept, but Brandt refuses to accept the mission. Hunt reveals that Julia's death was staged, as he knew he could not protect her and used her death as a pretext to infiltrate a Russian prison and get close to Bogdan, an IMF source on Hendricks. Relieved of his guilt, Brandt accepts his mission while Hunt watches Julia from afar. They share a smile before he goes off on his next mission.\n\nConfronting The Syndicate[]\n\nAfter intercepting a consignment of V.X. nerve gas in Minsk, bound for Syria, Ethan Hunt is convinced that he can prove the existence of the Syndicate, an international criminal consortium of rogue agents and trained killers. Reporting into an IMF substation to receive his orders, the Syndicate reveal their existence to Hunt, having infiltrated the station to subdue him. Hunt is rescued by disavowed British agent Ilsa Faust, a Syndicate operative who offers no explanation for her actions. With their existence confirmed, Hunt begins following his only lead: a blond man in glasses who oversaw his capture, later identified as former MI6 agent and Syndicate leader Solomon Lane.\n\nMeanwhile, CIA director Alan Hunley and William Brandt are summoned before a Senate oversight committee to justify the continued existence of the IMF. Citing their reckless behavior and near-miss in San Francisco during the events of 2011, Hunley demands that the IMF be disbanded and absorbed into the CIA. With Brandt unable to reveal operational details without permission from the IMF Secretary, the committee side with Hunley, whose first act is to name Hunt as the CIA's most-wanted man.\n\nSix months later, Hunt leads a CIA team to an empty safe house as a means of passing information on the Syndicate to Benji Dunn. Suspicious of Hunley's actions and believing he will kill Hunt at the first opportunity, Brandt recruits Luther Stickell to discreetly find Hunt, using a likeness of Ilsa found at the safe house. Hunt arranges for Dunn to attend an opera in Vienna, recruiting him to take part in a covert mission to locate the man in glasses. Realizing that the Syndicate plans to assassinate the Chancellor of Austria at the opera, Hunt intervenes by shooting him before the Syndicate can. Escaping with Ilsa, one of the intended shooters, he is powerless to prevent the Chancellor from being killed by a car bomb put in place as a redundancy, with Lane nowhere to be found.\n\nIlsa partners with Hunt and Dunn to locate a file hidden by a Syndicate traitor on a high-security server terminal used to regulate a Moroccan power station. Believing it to be a ledger containing the names of all Syndicate agents, the trio secure it before Ilsa betrays Hunt and Dunn. She returns to London, passing the file on to her handler, Atlee. However, Atlee discreetly erases the file, forcing Ilsa to return to the Syndicate and prove her loyalty to Lane.\n\nRegrouping with Brandt and Stickell, Hunt and Dunn follow Ilsa back to London, where they debate the nature of their work. Having betrayed one another so many times, they can no longer be certain of their own loyalty, question what to do next as they cannot be sure that Lane has not anticipated and moved to manipulate them. When Dunn is abducted by Lane's men, Hunt realizes that Lane will always have a plan to acquire the files, and that the only sure way to stop him is to force a confrontation with him. He agrees to Lane's ultimatum to abduct the British Prime Minister and use his voice print to unlock the file.\n\nDisturbed by this turn of events, Brandt contacts Hunley and reveals their location. Hunley arrives at a charity auction to try and prevent Hunt from attacking the Prime Minister and take him with Brandt and Atlee to a secure room. Having posed as Atlee, Hunt reveals himself and has the Prime Minister confirm the existence of the Syndicate: a top-secret black project that sought to recruit disavowed foreign operatives to carry out clandestine missions; an initiative that the Prime Minister rejected as too extreme. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt subdues him, and he admits that Lane hijacked the project for his own ends and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6, and that Atlee has been covering up its existence ever since.\n\nStickell discovers that the file is not a ledger of agents but contains the location and access codes for billions of dollars in untraceable funds that Lane has been desperate to get to expand the Syndicate's operations. Hunt memorizes the data and destroys the file to force Lane to release Dunn in exchange for what he knows. He lures Lane out into the open and into a trap set up by Stickell. Imprisoned in a bulletproof cell, he is gassed and taken into custody.\n\nSometime later, Hunley and Brandt return to the oversight committee to reinstate the IMF. Hunley suggests that their original meeting gave them a pretext to let Hunt's team infiltrate the CIA and take down the Syndicate without arousing suspicion. The committee is skeptical, believing Hunley is trying to save face, but agree when Brandt again refuses to discuss operational matters without permission. Outside, Brandt addresses Hunley as the Secretary of the IMF, revealing that the entire scheme was an elaborate ploy to destroy the Syndicate.\n\nConfronting The Apostles[]\n\nThree years later, Ethan is given a mission to intercept three stolen plutonium cores before a splinter cell of The Syndicate known as \"The Apostles\" can sell them to a fundamentalist named John Lark. He joins Benji and Luther for the mission but fail when Ethan chooses to save Luther's life and the plutonium is taken by the Apostles. The team capture nuclear weapons specialist, Dr. Nils Delbruuk, and learn that he built three portable nuclear weapons for the Apostles.\n\nEthan and CIA Special Activities Division agent August Walker infiltrates a fundraiser party in Paris by HALO jump where Lark is believed to be buying the cores from an arms dealer known as the White Widow. They track a man whom they suspect to be Lark, but he is killed when Ilsa Faust intervenes. Ethan impersonates Lark and meets the White Widow. He warns her that agents of the Apostles have been sent to kill her and the two evade their pursuers.\n\nEthan is tasked with extracting Solomon Lane from an armored convoy moving through Paris and provided with one of the plutonium cores as a payment in kind for the mission. Ethan and Walker attack the convoy and lead the police and the White Widow's men on a chase across Paris while Benji and Luther secure Lane at the same time.\n\nSuspecting that Walker is working with The Apostles and is John Lark, Ethan and his team hatch a plan to expose him by having Benji to disguise as Lane and send Hunley to arrest him. They inform CIA Director Erica Sloane of this information, who sends a task force to capture everyone indiscriminately. However, the IMF team is attacked by members of The Apostles disguising as task force and Hunley is murdered in the process. Ethan pursues Walker in London and is unable to arrest him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethan and his team discover that Lane and Walker plan to detonate two remaining nuclear weapons over a glacier in Kashmir and contaminate the water supply of Pakistan, India, and China to starve a third of its population. Reaching the medical camp, Ethan finds that Walker has arranged for his estranged wife Julia to be assigned there to raise stakes against him. Ethan pursues Walker in a helicopter while Luther, Benji and Ilsa find the bombs in two separate locations.\n\nAs the lengthy chase goes on, Walker discovers Ethan and attempts to shoot him down with his light machine gun until Ethan quickly rams Walker's helicopter out of the sky. They crash onto the snowy mountain where both Ethan and Walker fight on the cliff edge and Ethan kills Walker using the helicopter's hook. In the process, Ethan gains control of the detonator, allowing Luther, Benji and Ilsa to disarm the bombs at the same time and recover the remaining two plutonium cores.\n\nWith the crisis averted, Sloane hands Lane back to MI6 through the White Widow, in which earns Ilsa's exoneration. Ethan is taken to the medical camp by helicopter and recovers from his injuries with Julia's help while the rest of the team joins him in victory.\n\nKeys to the Entity[]\n\nEthan Hunt is seen recruiting a new member via \"food delivery\", to which afterwards the operative leaves him with a package of mission details: he is to retrieve a key via Ilsa Faust, who has a $50 million bounty on her head. Hunt travels to the Arabian Desert where he saves Ilsa from bounty hunters and fakes her death to stay off the grid.\n\nHunt leaves to the US in disguise where he attends a meeting between various intelligence operative heads known as the Community, along with current CIA director Eugene Kittridge and Director of National Intelligence Denlinger present. They discuss how two keys are being used to unlock a powerful AI known as \"the Entity\", designed to infiltrate and sabotage any digital system before removing its own traces. The Entity spirals out of hand and resurfaces on the Internet, as it grows to gain more sentience. In its current state, the Entity has infiltrated all major defense and military systems and intelligence networks, leading to various global superpowers are engaging to back up their most valuable data to prevent sabotage and to gain control of the Entity, Believing the Entity is too powerful for anyone's control, Hunt goes against orders and decides to destroy it.\n\nAssembling his team with Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell, they meet at the Abu Dhabi airport to meet with the other holder of the key, with Community agents Jasper Briggs and Degas hunting them in tow. In the process, Hunt loses the key to Grace, a professional thief and meeting up Gabriel, a man from his pre-IMF past. Benji also comes in danger when he finds a suspicious luggage bag containing a nuclear explosive, only managing to solve it in time when asked personal questions and realizing it lacks a core, per the Entity's prediction. Hunt calls off the mission as it goes away and decides to go after Grace, who is headed to Rome.\n\nUpon arriving to the capital of Italy, Ethan tracks down Grace to the Roman authority's headquarters, where she is being interrogated for committing numerous crimes around the world under several different identities. He manages to convince the authorities to leave Grace to him by pretending to be her lawyer and Grace informs him that she must deliver Ethan's half of the key to a party held in Ducale Palace, Venice, in order to receive her payment. The two walk outside to meet with Luther and Benji, only for Grace to manage to slip away from Ethan and escape in a police car. Ethan gives chase to her and saves her from both the Roman authorities and assassins working for Gabriel, including a French one named Paris.\n\nFollowing an intense chase throughout the streets of Rome, they manage to escape their enemies, only for Grace to once again leave Ethan behind and he would've been hit by a subway had he not escaped quick enough. He finally reunites with Luther, Benji, and Ilsa and learns that the midnight gala in Venice is being held by Alanna Mitsopolis/White Widow before briefly explaining his past with Gabriel, whom Ilsa admitted being the Entity's chosen messenger. Realizing the only way to affect him as through his teammates, Ethan tries to convince the three of them to leave and they tell him they are sticking together to prevent Gabriel from gaining the complete key.\n\nMission: Impossible 8[]\n\nOther appearances[]\n\nBecause of his popularity and his role as the main protagonist, Ethan Hunt appears in video games derived from the film series.\n\nMission: Impossible (1998 video game)[]\n\nEthan Hunt was deployed to retrieve CIA Non-Official Cover list as well as exposing the mole, Jim Phelps, within the IMF and killed both Phelps and the secretive dealer known as Max in order to clear his name and suspicion.\n\nMission: Impossible (2000 video game)[]\n\nTo be added.\n\nMission: Impossible – Operation Surma[]\n\nIn 2003 (set between the second and third film), Ethan Hunt, Luther Stickell and the IMF are brought into an investigation of a shady international corporation, known as SURMA, that is in possession of a highly advanced computer virus known as Ice Worm. It has the power to break through any type of security system and could lead to the theft of any data ranging from nuclear weapons specs to intelligence of any government. When their own operations are sabotaged, Ethan and the IMF team find out that their secure databases have been hacked and that their enemies are now in possession of some of their deepest, darkest secrets. The team must find this worm to protect global internet security.\n\nCharacteristics[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\n“ Hunt is uniquely trained and highly motivated - a specialist without equal - immune to any counter measures. There is no secret he cannot extract, no security he cannot breach, no person he cannot become. He has most likely anticipated this very conversation and is waiting to strike in whatever direction we move. Sir, Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny. And he has made you his mission. ”\n\n–Alan Hunley\n\nEthan is proactive, tending to initiate events rather than respond to them. Even before Jim Phelps betrayed him, Ethan tended to act independently; that trait became his dominant one after his time as a fugitive. He is capable of planning and undertaking very intricate schemes, particularly covert intrusions.\n\nAccording to Ambrose, he prefers misdirection to confrontation, as expected as a covert operative, and Ethan will do his best not to endanger innocent bystanders.\n\nEthan is extremely observant, with an almost-photographic memory, and his ability to make profound deductions with limited clues is very impressive. He is also very good at hiding his reaction to critical information; for example, during one mission he realized one of his hired hands was also one of the people who assassinated his former team, but he did not show any visible reaction that would have given away this revelation.\n\nEthan enjoys engaging in playful banter in conversation and often wins people over quickly by virtue of his charm.\n\nHe is also incredibly intelligent, and almost recklessly daring in his missions. He is highly cunning and extremely astute and calculating, especially when it comes to knowing his enemies. He is highly idealistic and devises philosophical traps during debates.\n\nFinally, Hunt's personality is subdued in the first movie, but becomes more extravagant and extroverted during the next two.\n\nHe is described as a tough, uniquely trained and highly motivated individual who is an unequaled professional - immune to any countermeasures. In most of the films, he is depicted as an individual who is able to extract any secret data, breach any security system, and become any person in the world easily via the latex masks provided by the IMF.\n\nAlan Hunley, former director of the CIA, had described Hunt as the ultimate personification of destiny, and it is proven the whole time during every mission. Most of all, Hunt is a man of work as he loves his job and almost nothing would stand in his way to finish his missions and defend the world as he knows it.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nPeak Human Condition with Superhuman Attributes: As an IMF agent and former Army Ranger along with being a former CIA's Special Activities Division Operative, Ethan is in top physical condition to the point he can surpass human limitations. His strength, speed, agility, reflexes, endurance and durability are all at peak levels for a man in his age, height and weight. Ethan has shown himself capable of performing incredible physical feats such as breaking a chunk of concrete, lifting up people with one hand, holding his breath for long periods, cracking reinforced glass, knocking out people wearing anti-riot gear armor with his bare hands, dodging bullets and missiles in close range, withstanding intense physical pain and torture, jumping from great heights and between buildings, withstanding extended physical altercations and recovering quickly, clinging to the side of an airplane in flight, climbing up the side of a mountain with no equipment, surviving from the Kremlin Explosion and fatal crashes easily, running at incredible speeds for long periods of time without tiring and even running with a visibly twisted ankle. He is capable of easily overpowering people like Paris and Agent Carter whom can easily break bone and break the necks of larger grown men. Ethan keeps himself in shape in between missions through an intense workout regime as well as hobbies like rock climbing and calisthenics.\n\nExpert Martial Artist: Ethan is a very well-trained martial artist as he is able to show his excellent martial arts prowess in combat, kicking a CIA employee while stealing the NOC list, but he is later knocked out in a confrontation by the elderly, but more experienced Jim Phelps. He uses various kicks, holds and flips during attacks on terrorist personnel during the next two movies. In the second installment, we see him using techniques inspired by Capoeira, which fits with his profile from the first movie. He also uses Aikido, Karate, Boxing, Judo, Wrestling, Taekwondo and Brazilian Jujutsu techniques during his fight with Ambrose. In the third installment, while still using some Capoeira, he also utilizes techniques from Keysi, and in a training scene with Lindsey Farris, he was teaching her the Filipino martial arts of Eskrima. He displays several extremely complex techniques in the fourth movie, including a selection of Capoeira and Taekwondo moves. During his prison escape, he mainly utilizes Karate and judo moves, and resorts to combined Capoeira, Ninjutsu, Taekwondo and Karate moves and strategies. During the fifth film, he uses Taekwondo and Wrestling moves in fights, including drop kicks during his escape from capture with Ilsa and later in the fight at the Opera, as well as Muay Thai. During the sixth movie, he is shown to be using fighting techniques from Keysi, as well as techniques from Eskrima, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Wrestling, Muay Thai and Krav Maga. During the seventh film, he uses Taekwondo push and back kicks, Muay Thai elbow strikes and Wrestling and Judo moves to hit her against the wall while fighting Paris as well as Boxing strikes and a Hapkido counter when she tries to kick him and later uses Brazilian JiuJitsu and Karate during his fight with Gabriel.\n\nWeapon Mastery: Ethan is highly trained skilled with a variety of weapons including handguns, rifles and knives. He is also very skilled at using whatever is available to him as a weapon and using his environment to his advantage in combat.\n\nMaster Marksman: Ethan is highly trained and skilled in the use of a variety of firearms and can dual-wield without sacrifing his accuracy. He shot and killed Sean Ambrose while Ambrose had the drop on him, he also draws on and kills multiple armed targets within seconds. He is also capable of shooting down a speeding drown while the sun was hitting his eyes.\n\nMaster Spy: Ethan is very skilled at breaking into even the most secure facilities and breaking out without being detected. In the first movie, Hunt is a master of disguises, stealth, and espionage tactics. As the series progresses, however, Hunt abandons many of his stealth tactics in favor of force. Ethan reused his mastery of stealth and surprise while battling Kurt Hendricks. Through the use of latex masks and voice modifiers as well as other changes to his appearance, Ethan is able to impersonate high ranking officials and is skilled at remembering their behavior enough to fool even those close to them. Ethan is a master escape artist, able to free himself from various confinements. He is also skilled at escaping capture and breaking others out when necessary.\n\nGenius-level Intellect: Ethan is incredibly intelligent, creative and a methodical man. He has shown himself to be very skilled in espionage, infiltration, counterintelligence and is skilled at adjusting his plans to account for changes as well as knowing how to plan well in advance and improvising new plans when necessary. He also has an excellent memory and can remember messages and details of missions easily.\n\nMaster Tactician: Ethan is a highly trained tactician who is skilled at coming up with and executing plans for a variety of missions and is very good at understanding his opponents and using their flaws and plans against them. One of his favorite measures is to let those he is targeting think they have him beaten and enact counter measures that he was relying on for his own plans to succeed.\n\nExpert Driver: Ethan is a very skilled driver who is able to drive both cars and motorcycles and can even fly helicopters at dangerously close ground.\n\nMultilingualism: In addition to English, Ethan is also fluent in multiple languages without accent like Spanish, Russian, German and French. He is skilled enough to fool even native speakers.\n\nLip Reading: Ethan is able to read lips. He first demonstrates this ability when he is able to understand what Julia and her friends are talking about, despite not hearing them, and later uses it to figure out a hidden message from John Musgrave.\n\nRock Climbing: Ethan enjoys engaging in rock climbing as a hobby and form of exercise and is very skilled at it. He is able to climb up a cliff face with no equipment and jump from one area to another and is able to pull himself up a mountain side using only his strength.\n\nHigh Pain Tolerance: Ethan is very skilled at overcoming pain and can withstand excruciating injuries and torture without breaking.\n\nIndomitable Will: Arguably Ethan's greatest skill is his incredible determination. Regardless of what he has to do, he will not stop until he succeeds in his mission and refuses to ever accept defeat, no matter what setbacks he endures. When Alan Hunley attempted to shut down investigations on the missing plutonium after receiving evidence that Hunt is \"John Lark\", Ethan tries to talk him out of it, and ultimately, he is successful. In 2023, Ethan and the team embarked on their most dangerous mission, one which forced them to realize that none of their lives could matter more than the success of the mission.\n\nEquipment[]\n\nEthan's weapon of choice remains the Beretta 92FS, which he uses in all three films before changing to SIG Sauer P226 in the next two films.
