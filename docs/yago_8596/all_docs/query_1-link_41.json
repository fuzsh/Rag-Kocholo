        "text": "An audience of readers sits in the dark as words flash on a screen. It’s a strange situation: reading together as a group, listening by reading, reading a translation of foreign sounds into English characters. How did we get here? The movies developed synchronized sound at a time of global depression, unstable exchange rates, and economic and ideological protectionism. Many in the movie business viewed the introduction of spoken dialogue as an unwelcome additional impediment to international distribution. Their complaints constitute most of the content of this chronology. Of their quick fixes and long-term solutions, only superimposed subtitles and dubbing survive to the present day. If these sometimes seem annoying, consider the alternatives.\n\nFairbanks spoke of the wonderful work a young German named Selnik has been doing in Hollywood lately. This clever linguist, he says, translates the lines spoken by the actors into half a dozen languages. These translations run the same length as the original lines, so that they synchronize perfectly with the actor’s gestures. A good elocutionist is then requisitioned from Germany, France, Spain or China to speak the lines. The foreign movie public sees the American actor, but hears the voice of one of its countrymen.\n\n“Thanks to the successful experiments Selnik has already made,” Mr. Fairbanks continued, “we can be sure now of keeping the foreign market. Did you know that American films do more business in China than in any other single country to which we export?”[9]\n\nA year after Hitler took power in Germany, industrial protectionism merged with Nazi cultural policy in a decree that imposed an import license fee of 20,000 Reichsmarks on all foreign films, which, in the view of Hollywood, meant “termination of business in the market.”[13] In 1938, Italy achieved a similar de facto ban by frightening away major Hollywood studios with a threat to nationalize their film-importing partners, leading to the potential reduction of an important revenue stream.[14]\n\nbecause the benshi has done his work so well, the talkies are not highly regarded. In the American sound film, the explanations must be crowded in between unintelligible English speeches. The Japanese talkies have not as yet been developed satisfactorily. Japanese producers have not the resources to buy American equipment. They are working out their own devices. In the meantime, the stage chorus continues his story-telling, and the Japanese continue to patronize the movies.[30]\n\nThough well-established, benshi were attacked in the 1930s by both Japanese cinephiles who felt they interfered with the cinematic experience, and by a rigid licensing system imposed by the Japanese authorities.[31] Live narration/translation nevertheless spread throughout Asia, and also developed in Africa, as in the Senegalese cinema featured in Coup de torchon (Bertrand Tavernier, 1981).[32]\n\nHowever, some films were released in the US in dubbed rather than subtitled versions. For example, the New York Times review of the panegyric on Mussolini, Camicia nera (Giovacchino Forzano, 1933; released in the US as Man of Courage), noted that “the sound dubbing, whereby the remarks of the Italian players roll forth in perfect English, is skillfully done.”[39]\n\nThe dubbing versus subtitling debate went public in 1933 after the release of a version of Grand Hotel (Edmund Goulding, 1932) dubbed into French. One critic, Henri-André Legrand, denounced the French dub “an assassination” of the American film, to which critic Maurice Landeau responded, “What do the voices of Greta Garbo, the Barrymores and Joan Crawford matter? Their tones as given correspond to the demands of our French ears. Why should it matter when their doubles are chosen with such art?”[42]\n\nAt this early moment of the sound era, a class position was beginning to be demarcated: dubbing was for the masses, subtitles were for the cinephile intelligentsia. Thirteen years after Landeau pronounced dubbing an irrelevance, Jorge Luis Borges insisted that “Hepburn’s or Garbo’s voices are not accidental” but “defining attributes.” Hence, the practice of dubbing was inherently inartistic, offering “monsters which combine the illustrious features of Greta Garbo with the voice of Aldonza Lorenzo.”[43] Maurice Merleau-Ponty subsequently insisted that he couldn’t conceptually connect dubbed dialogue with the images on the screen.[44]\n\n“Prestige” foreign films are still dubbed occasionally for US exhibition. The animated feature Princess Mononoke (Hayao Miyazaki, 1997) was dubbed, and proved a popular success, but a 1999 dubbed version of Life Is Beautiful (Roberto Benigni, 1997) was a box-office disaster, despite the overwhelming success of the earlier subtitled version.[46] However, most dubbing in America today is done for English-language TV commercials made for broadcast in Spanish-language US media.[47]\n\nIn 1976, the Federal Communications Commission reserved line 21 of the vertical blanking interval (VBI) for transmitting “closed captions”—i.e., normally hidden and only seen with an appropriate decoding device. The first real-time closed-captioning was provided for the 1982 Academy Awards broadcast.[55] The 1996 Telecommunications Act imposed a schedule of mandatory captioning requirements on US broadcasters, so that by 2012 all new programming would be fully captioned in English (or in Spanish, if the original language), and 75 percent of old re-broadcast programming would be captioned.[56]\n\nThe laborious task of spotting has been revolutionized in the last ten years by the introduction of English-language, universal template subtitle files, which provide the basis for all translations into all other languages.\n\nIn other words, the subtitles process has been split into two distinct tasks. The timing of a film or audiovisual programme is made by English native speakers who produce a unique timed subtitle file in English, that is, a file where all the in- and out-times have been decided. This file is then used as the basis for translation into other languages as required, with the translation carried out by native speakers of those languages.[60]\n\nHence movies are almost always translated from an English template, rather than the original dialogue.[61]\n\nSubjects do not read the subtitle. They first look at the visual image, jump quite accurately to the keywords of the subtitle (i.e., the words conveying the most important parts of the conversation) and then go back to the visual image. If the subtitle is still available, they occasionally jump back to the subtitle for more processing of the text. … In fact, many subjects reported that reading behavior was automatically triggered off when the subtitle was given. … Only one or two keywords are fixated.[63]\n\nJohn Minchinton, a subtitler for Britain’s Channel 4, maintained that genre makes a difference: subtitles are vital to follow detective stories, but for love stories, “viewers need not read many of the titles; they know the story, they guess the dialogue, they blink down at the subtitles for information, they photograph them rather than read them.”[64]"
