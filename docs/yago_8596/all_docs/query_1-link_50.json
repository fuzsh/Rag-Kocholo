A tiny, faint spot on the front board else fine in a nice, very good or better dustwrapper, but for an old internal tape repair that has bled through near the crown. Inscribed by the author. A very uncommon title in the first edition. Basis for the 1937 film directed by Jacques Feyder, adapted by Frances Marion, and featuring Marlene Dietrich and Robert Donat. Dietrich herself claimed to have directed a few scenes of this rousing film of the Russian Revolution, to the delight of the film's producer, Alexander Korda, who on seeing the footage told his star, \"You can direct here any time you want.\"\n\nItem #84817\n\nitem image\n\nJames Hilton\n\nbirth name: James Hilton\n\nborn: 9/9/1900\n\ndied: 12/20/1954\n\nView Reference Info\n\nBiography\n\nEnglish novelist whose popular works include Lost Horizon (1933), Good-bye, Mr. Chips (1934), and Random Harvest (1941), all of which were made into highly successful motion pictures. - Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literaturemore\n\nCollecting tips:\n\nJames Hilton is best known for his two novels Lost Horizon (1933), and Goodbye, Mister Chips (1934), presumably their popularity has been enhanced by the beloved movies made from both. Lost Horizon is preferred in the English edition, though fine copies of the American will usually draw a crowd if they are in reasonably nice condition. The true first edition of Goodbye, Mister Chips is actually the scarcer American edition, though the English edition is also desirable. What isn't generally known is that he wrote a Haycraft-Queen Cornerstone, Murder at School (1933) under the pseudonym Glen Trevor, that is very uncommon, especially in jacket, and probably will be as expensive as his better known works. We have also occasionally been tempted to buy the English editions of his earlier titles when we have found them in nice jackets, and have not been disappointed in their ability to find homes in a reasonably prompt manner.\n\nEmail us to request a printed copy of our catalog of James Hilton Rare Books and First Editions (or download it via the link as a 4.39 MB pdf file).more"
