        "text": "At best I have watched in a cinema/on television and/or own some dozen ‘silent’ French films which makes me just about the worst qualified person to write about French Cinema in the Silent Era.\n\nOn the other hand I own approximately 700 French sound films on dvd and I have actually watched – again in the cinema and/or television – somewhere between 4 and 5 thousand so that if and when – like now, for instance – I choose to write about, say, French Cinema From 1930 To The Present, then I am on somewhat firmer ground.\n\nFrance was somewhat late entering the Sound era with some eight titles released in 1929, so that the 'Talkies' really began in 1930, which allows me to deal with a whole decade from January, 1930 to December, 1939. Suppose we start by getting the flat, inanimate stats out of the way and then overlay them with a little cable stitching. With the exception of 1930 (98 releases) and 1939 (93 releases) there were in excess of one hundred films released in each year of the decade, from a high of 157 in 1932 to a low of 120 in 1934 making a grand total (I've done the math for you) of 1,295 French talking pictures.\n\nNow I don't know any more than you do what went through the minds of those early pioneers; we'll take it as a given that first and foremost they were looking to make a buck because, let's face it, everyone needs what to eat with, but I for one don't think it's too fanciful to speculate that several of them, whether consciously or not, thought of themselves as craftsmen - architects, draughtsmen, carpenters, electricians, plumbers - who, together, were building a monument, a temple if you will, to French cinema and you and I know that an edifice requires sound foundations and it's those foundations I'll be looking at starting right now.\n\nYou may get an argument from those petulant schoolboys who thought of themselves as a new wave back in the late fifties/early sixties, but most sensible people are in agreement that a film begins with a screenplay; no screenplay and the director has nothing to shoot and the actors have nothing to say. French 'Sound' cinema had writers right from the start and by the middle of the decade there was a solid corps.\n\nMarcel Pagnol was one of the earliest. He began as a playwright but, quick to see the possibilities of cinema, he adapted his stage success, Marius, for the screen and having no idea how to direct a film, he hired Alexander Korda to do the honours, with Pagnol himself on set constantly in order to watch and learn. The actors who had been so successful on the Paris stage - Raimu, Fernand Charpin, Pierre Fresnay, Orane Demazis, Alida Rouffe - moved seamlessly from stage to screen, and with a hit on his hands Pagnol adapted the sequel, Fanny, for the screen, this time hiring Marc Allegret to direct. Marius was released in 1931 and by the end of the decade Pagnol had seen his name on fifteen films, the first two of which listed him as writer whilst the last thirteen listed him as writer/director. Apart from Cesar, the last of the great trilogy, which he wrote directly for the screen and with which he made his directing debut, he also released Le Schpountz, Regain (both starring Fernandel), La Femme de boulanger, starring Raimu, and had the distinction of writing and directing the very last domestic film produced in France prior to the occupation, this was La Fille de la puisatier (The Well-digger's daughter), which was actually shot in 1939.\n\nOur second scenarist, Charles Spaak, was not only the first to see his credit on the screen (The New Gentlemen) on one of the very first 'Talkies' released in 1929, he was also the most prolific, with 37 credits throughout the decade. Belgian-born and Paris-based he approached fellow countryman Jaques Feyder (also Paris-based) for a job, however menial, on any future Feyder production; a bright young man, he soon impressed Feyder sufficiently to be invited to write the screenplay for Les Nouveaux messieurs (The New Gentlemen) and he went on to write Feyder's three most successful films of the decade, Le Grand Jeu, Pension Mimosas and La Kermesse Heroique, which in themselves were sufficient to assure his place in the Pantheon, but he was far from done and before the decade was out he had written La Bandera (Gabin's breakout role), La Belle Equipe and Le Fin du jour for Julien Duvivier, Le Bas-Fonds and La Grand Illusion for Renoir, L'Etrange Monsieur Victor for Jean Gremillon, plus several memorable films such as the Gabin-Morgan Le Recif de corail, for less well-known directors.\n\nAlready, with only two screenwriters namechecked the foundations are looking pretty solid. Another early starter (1932) was\n\nJacques Prevert, who was, in fact, the subject of my very first entry in LJ, Dead Poet's Society. As part of the foundations of our temple he does, of course have a part to play and rates a mention if only for the fifteen screenplays he wrote during the decade - technically this should be sixteen but the last one, Remorques, written for Jean Gremillon, and starring his favourite actress Madeleine Renaud as one third of a triangle with Jean Gabin and Michele Morgan (their third and final teaming) was suspended half-completed in 1939 and finished the following year shortly before Gabin and Morgan fled to Hollywood on the brink of the Occupation. Apart from forging his great partnership with Marcel Carne and scripting the first four of the seven films they made together Prevert also worked for Jean Renoir, Claude Autant-Lara, his own kid brother Pierre, and Christian-Jacque.\n\nWeighing in with a round 20 credits, Henri Jeanson was another writer who started out at the beginning of the decade working on bread-and-butter domestic fodder but in mid decade he really hit his stride when he scripted two iconcic titles for Julien Duvivier both in the same year, 1937, and Pepe le Moko and Un Carnet de bal are still talked about today. The following year he wrote no less than three excellent films; Le Drame de Shanghai for G.W. Pabst, Entree des Artistes for Marc Allegret and last but by no means least Hotel du Nord for Marcel Carne (Jacques Prevert was unavailable so Henri Jeanson and Jean Aurenche shared screenwriter credits), indeed it is Jeannson who is credited with putting the word \"Atmosphere\" into the mouth of Arletty and in passing creating the most quoted line in French Cinema.\n\nIf this were a radio show rather than a blog then Jeannson would be the perfect link to our next writer for he is none other than Jeannson's writing partner on Hotel du Nord,\n\nJean Aurenche, who was the last of the major screenwriters to get started. It was, in fact, 1937 before he launched his career and though the first directors he worked with were not household names even within France, they were highly respected amongst their peers; I'm speaking of Pierre Chenel and Leo Johannon, though he also worked with Christian-Jacque and actors like Raimu, Saturnin Fabre and Pierre Brasseur.\n\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention one more writer, indeed there are those who would argue that I should have placed him immediately after Marcel Pagnol for he is, in fact not only a writer-director but also an actor who wrote a total of 124 plays and gave Raimu his first stage role as long ago as 1916. French movie buffs will long ago have guessed who I mean but the readers I am targeting here are those who know a little about French cinema, like what they do know and would like to know more and for those readers I am happy to reveal that the man in question is\n\nSacha Guitry, dramatist, screenwriter, director, actor, who, like Marcel Pagnol, initially saw talking pictures (he had dabbled in 'Silent' cinema as long ago as 1915) as a means of gaining greater exposure for his stage plays but came to recognize the potenential for creativity possessed by Talkies and took full advantage of this. He wrote, directed and acted in no less than twelve films during the nineteen thirties albeit waiting until 1935 to get started.\n\nI think we can safely say that as foundations go these are some of the most solid to be found in any creative arena and in a moment I hope to show how top-of-the-line writers were supplemented by top-of-the-line directors and actors so that by the end of the decade French cinema was so solid in all departments that even a World War and four years of Occupation could not bring the Temple tumbling down. As a matter of interest I should like to add that all the writers cited here continued to turn out high quality screenplays for three further decades with the exception of Pagnol, who abandoned the cinema in the mid-fifties, and Guitry, who died in 1957 with his last film unfinished.\n\nWere this a jig-saw puzzle rather than a blog/essay, then we could argue that we have now constructed the border and can concentrate on the interior, and the image holds for as we supplement writers with directors and actors in Part Two we shall see how fluidly they interlock, with writers 1) forming close links with given directors and 2) switching easily from one director to another, and this holds true with actors so that eventually, when we reach 1939, we can be forgiven for thinking of French cinema as more than a tad incestuous.\n\nSome of the great directors (and actors for that matter) began their careers in the Silent era and had little or no trouble segueing to Sound; names like Abel Gance, who made his first film in 1911, and his last in 1971, Maurice Tourneur, active between 1913 and 1948 but left behind an equally talented son Jacques, who made his first French sound film in 1931 and later made some notable films (Cat People, Out Of The Past) in Hollywood, Marcel L'Herbier (first film, 1917, last film 1963), Rene Clair, active 1924 to 1965 and then there are those we have already encountered above - Julien Duvivier, 1919-1968, Jean Gremillon, 1928-1954, Marc Allegret, 1927-1970 and Jacques Feyder, 1916-1946.\n\nSome regular writer-director teams are better known than others. For example even the casual French film fan can tell you that Jacques Prevert forged a strong working partnership with Marcel Carne though that casual fan might be hard pressed to name all seven films made by the team (Jenny, Drole de Drame, Quai des brumes, Le Jour se leve, Les Visiteurs du soir, Les Enfants du Paradis, Les Portes de la nuit) and/or state which were in the 1930s (the first four). In terms of both number (7) and quality - none less than excellent, five Beyond Excellent and the sixth, Les Enfants du Paradis, by general consensus the finest film ever made in France - this was arguably the strongest writer-director team but that doesn't mean, of course, that other collaborations - Spaak/Gremillon, 3, Spaak/Feyder, 4, Spaak/Duvivier, 4, Spaak/Renoir, 2, Spaak/L'Herbier, 2, Jeannson/Duvivier -2, Jeannson/Carne, Jeannson/Allegret, Jeannson/Tourneur, Aurenche/Carne, Aurenche/Richebe, Aurench/Jacque, Aurenche/Chenel, Aurenche/Johanon, were chopped liver (and these collaborations only apply to the decade under discussion, the majority of these collaborations were reprised in subsequent decades.\n\nNice talking to you.\n\nIf I have beenfrugal with director images it is because I have featured them in other entries on French cinema and when I come, as I will in Part Two, to add the third ingredient - actors - to the mix the same fact obtains. If you found this sufficiently interesting and/or informative I'll see you in Part Two, if not, thanks for taking the time to check this out."
