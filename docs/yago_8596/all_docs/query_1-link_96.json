MJTFC is a proper inside-look at French films and their directors. Naturally, summer presents the most opportune time to binge your favorite shows and movies. And to be honest Netflix reigns supreme for me in this regard. Still, at times I tire of Netflix, HBO, and the lot. In order to locate a finer quality of content, or at least something new, it may be more productive to look backwards instead of forwards. MJTFC is a solid survey for an expert of film history, but not everyone is a cinephile. And if you haven’t seen any films from France’s poetic realism era now is as good a time as any to get your feet wet.\n\nAt first glance the phrase ‘Poetic Realism’ seems confusing. I get it. Poetry is usually thought to be the opposite of realism. In other words, poetry utilizes the figurative language of metaphor to convey feelings and thoughts that can’t be presented in a matter-of- fact way. Conversely, something realistic is striped of complexities until the emotions lay bare for the audience to absorb. Realism hearkens to the vulnerability of the auteur and a willingness to express the topic with objectivity. So the movement of Poetic Realism essentially combines these two different methods. It blends Surrealist innovations with the more pragmatic mode of sequenced filmmaking.\n\nPoetic Realism has a tendency to emphasize working class narratives that expose the flaws of society. The majority of these films were produced in the early sound era while the French film industry awaited the onset of WWII, providing discouraged if outright cynical perspectives of prewar French culture. The principal films of the movement focused on the theme of doomed love, the confluence of tragedy and comedy, and a proclivity for long-shots. Still, there’s something truly optimistic about such consistent aesthetic preferences and a devotion to the production of art in the midst of hostility.\n\nHere are my Five favorite films from the era.\n\n5. L’Atalante (Director — Jean Vigo, 1934) Vigo’s final work and perhaps the most prototypical film to begin your survey of French cinema. L’atalante artfully pivots into a thoroughly chaotic tone, upending the typical poetic realist style — yet somehow the contrasting nature of the work\n\nplays seamlessly into a story that is as compelling as it is unorthodox.\n\n4. Le Grand Jeu (Director — Jacques Feyder, 1934) A precursor to the American melodrama and one of the foremost examples of romantic misery in the poetic realist era. The French Foreign Legion takes center stage in this film about the pitfalls of love and fate.\n\n3. Pépé le Moko (Director — Julien Duvivier, 1937) Pépé le Moko is an anomalous gangster film and the obvious complement for Le Grand Jeu. French cinema in the 1930’s was characterized by theatrics which were intermittently diluted by sorrow. In this case Duvivier positions the protagonist, Jean Gabin, in between freedom and love.\n\n2. La Règle du jeu (Director — Jean Renoir, 1939) Jean Renoir’s depth of staging and use of foreground, middle, and background is unmatched. La Règle du jeu or The Rules of the Game is one of my favorite films from this era or any. Renoir is particularly skilled at rendering a humanist landscape in\n\ntrue documentarian form within the opaque confines of fiction. The Rules of the Game, is the supreme critic of European societal division and somehow an equally comical and pensive reflection of humanity's shortcomings.\n\n1. Children of Paradise (Director — Marcel Carne, 1945) You’d have to be a pretty brazen artist to critique the Nazi occupation of France, during the Nazi occupation of France. It’s maybe a little like Kanye West calling out VMA voters in the middle of the VMA’s. More tastefully executed in this case, but still — savage. Carne bundled his evaluations into a three-hour epic split into two periods, Boulevard du Crime (Boulevard of Crime) and L’Homme Blanc (The Man in White). Carne scarcely provides resolutions for the drama in this circus, wherein love is artfully divided between a beautiful escort and her four suitors. While Children of Paradise is part political polemic, it's also a dense romance that slowly unravels in on itself."
