He wrote the script himself based on the literary original from 1845. Luis BuÃ±uel , who leans towards surrealism and was also an assistant director alongside Charles Spaak , plays a small role as a smuggler.\n\nPlot\n\nDon JosÃ©, a young soldier, caught up in passion for the gypsy Carmen, leaves everything behind and first becomes a deserter and then a smuggler just to be close to her. In order to have the woman all to himself, he kills her lover Garcia. But Carmen, a free woman, is not loyal to him and leaves him for Lukas, a bullfighter, which drives JosÃ© crazy and commits murder.\n\nâCarmen knows neither the past nor the future, but lives exclusively in the here and now. Love means nothing to her, it’s just a fleeting whim. Their main characteristic is precisely the changeability that Don JosÃ© detests most.â (Ulf Kjell GÃ¼r)\n\nBackground\n\nCarmen was a production by the company Les Films Albatros, founded in 1919 by Russian exiles , around the producer Alexandre Kamenka and his production assistant Charles Barrois. It was released by Les Films Armor . Lazare Meerson created the stage design. Maurice Desfassiaux and Paul Parguel were responsible for the photography . The editing was done by Jacques Feyder, assisted by Henriette Caire . The costumes were designed by Vasily Shuchayev and Jeanne Lanvin . The title role was played by Spanish actress and singer Raquel Meller\n\nThe illustration music was written by the Spanish-Mexican composer and conductor Ernesto Halffter Escriche . A student of Manuel de Falla and Maurice Ravel , he avoided the leitmotif characterization of individual figures in favor of an atmosphere in impressionistic colors.\n\nCarmen was first performed in Paris on November 5, 1926. In Germany the film was given the title âThe White Gypsy Womanâ and was announced as âa drama in 5 acts from the life of the Spanish bullfighters, with Raquel Meller in the title roleâ .\n\nCarmen also ran across Europe in Denmark, Finland, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Poland. Overseas, the film was also shown in the United States and Brazil.\n\nQuoted from Wikipedia\n\n(Visited 148 times, 1 visits today)"
