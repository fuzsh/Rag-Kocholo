However, Shaw did not publish a book with either of the aforementioned titles, and his script for The Big Gamble was described as an “original screenplay” in the 2 Sep 1961 NYT review.\n\nThe project was part of a ten-picture slate to be produced by Darryl F. Zanuck Productions, Inc., in 1959 and 1960. Richard Fleischer was brought on to direct, as reported in the 6 Feb 1960 NYT, and the budget was set at $4 million.

An item in the 9 Jun 1960 DV stated that production had just relocated to Dublin, where eleven days of shooting were planned. Cast and crew returned to France for filming in the southern part of the country, where locations standing in for Africa included sections of the Camargue; Vallon-Pont-d’Arc; Port-de-Bouc; Arles; and rock caves below the town of Les Baux. In an interview published in the 14 Aug 1960 NYT, Zanuck claimed France was used as much as possible due to the difficulties of shooting in Africa, which he had experienced firsthand on the set of The Roots of Heaven (1958, see entry). Zanuck was concerned about the heat, threat of dysentery and fever, and primitive living conditions that his cast and crew would be subjected to, but acknowledged that, for verisimilitude, a certain amount of filming had to take place in the Ivory Coast cities of Abidjan, Sassandra, and Grand-Bassam. An 8 Jan 1961 LAT article also quoted Zanuck as saying that the film company were “worried about cannibalism,” since it was known to be a practice there.\n\nWhile filming in Vallon-Pont-d’Arc, actor Stephen Boyd slipped and struck his head upon jumping into the River Ardèche, in a scene in which he was supposed to free a truck from the water. As noted in the 5 Jul 1960 LAT, co-star David Wayne saved Boyd from drowning after he slid under the water unconscious.\n\nProduction was scheduled to move to the Ivory Coast on 7 Aug 1960, a day which marked the country’s independence from France. African locations were completed by mid-Aug 1960, when cast and crew travelled to London for filming at Twickenham Studios, the 17 Aug 1960 Var noted. There, the final three weeks of shooting were set to take place, with an emphasis on process shots, which were done in a far superior manner there as opposed to the U.S., according to Zanuck in the 8 Jan 1961 LAT.\n\nAn article in the 28 Jun 1960 DV noted that The Big Gamble was shot in Cinemascope using Eastman Kodak’s new 52-50 superspeed color negative. Despite recent complaints about the film stock from filmmaker Stanley Donen, Fleischer and director of photography William C. Mellor were said to be happy with its capacity to extend “clarity and definition to the outer edges of the frame to an extent never before realized” with the Cinemascope process.\n\nPhil Gersdorf served as unit publicist, as stated in the 8 Jun 1960 Var. Although he did not receive onscreen credit, Gersdorf’s name was said to appear on “300 cartons and 7,200 cans of beer” used as props, according to a 21 Jul 1960 DV brief. Also working on the crew were French-Belgian film director Jacques Feyder’s three sons, as pointed out in the 3 Aug 1960 Var: assistant directors Paul Feyder and Bernard Farrel, and Marc Feyder, who acted as assistant to the art director.\n\nLess\n\nIrish seaman Vic Brennan persuades his Dublin family to finance a truck-hauling business in the remote African town of Jebanda.
