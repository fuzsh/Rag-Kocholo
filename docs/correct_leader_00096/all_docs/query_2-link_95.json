The main objective of the 1st Cycle (Bachelor) Degree in biochemistry is to provide a solid theoretical and experimental education in the fundamentals of biochemistry, to form high level professionals able to exercise their activity in diverse scientific and technological fields, including health sciences, environmental sciences, and the food industry.\n\nAnother crucial target is to endow students with the necessary autonomy, critical thinking and creativity to attend a second cycle of studies, both to expand their knowledge basis and to specialize at a more advanced scientific level, thus easing integration into constantly evolving national and international job markets, and promoting lifelong learning opportunities.\n\nKey learning outcomes The Biochemistry Bachelor should be able to:\n\nObtain, organize and use information from multiple sources including scientific and bibliographic databases.\n\nCommunicate relevant biochemical information in an organized manner, which includes reports of laboratory classes, in a effective way, both in writing and orally and using different audiovisual media.\n\nDemonstrate and perform technical and practical skills relevant in biochemistry.\n\nConstruct reasoned arguments to support support their position on ethics and the social impact of advances in biochemistry.\n\nApply numerical and computer skills, including statistical analysis to the experimental results.\n\nEstablish strategies for upgrading, maintaining and expanding their knowledge and skills in biochemistry, such as the continuing formation in the 2nd and 3rd cycle programmes, and throughout life.\n\nDemonstrate the importance of Biochemistry in advanced areas such as biosensors and biomaterials.\n\nWork in Portugal or abroad.\n\nAssume responsibility for the selection, implementation, execution and monitoring of methods of analysis in the laboratory environment.\n\nTeamwork.\n\nDescribe and explain the chemistry that supports biochemical reactions as well as the techniques used to investigate them.\n\nDescribe the principles that determine the three dimensional structure of biological macromolecules and give examples of structure-function.\n\nAcquire a critical understanding of the molecular basis of genetics, including structure, expression and gene regulation, as well as relevant experimental methods.\n\nExpose the features and functions of different types of cells, both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and explain how their properties are suitable for their biological function.\n\nEnumerate and run appropriate experimental methods for solving problems in fundamental and applied biochemistry.\n\nDescribe the essential functions of cellular metabolism and its control.\n\nDescribe the principles of chemistry and thermodynamics behind enzymatic catalysis and the role of enzymes in determining the function of cells and organisms.\n\nDescribe the relationship between biochemical parameters and physiological changes.\n\nShow the importance of biochemistry in monitoring and treatment of effluents.\n\nIdentify toxic substances for the body and mention the mechanisms of toxicity.\n\nExplain the structure, dynamics and functions of the immune system.\n\nExplain biological processes involved in food production and metabolism."
