        "text": "Maria Ramos (born February 22, 1959, Lisbon, Portugal) is a Portuguese South African economist and businesswoman who served as CEO of the transportation company Transnet (2004–09) and later of the financial group Absa (2009–19).\n\nRamos moved to South Africa with her parents when she was a child and later became a citizen there. She studied economics at the University of the Witwatersrand (Bachelor of Commerce, 1987) in Johannesburg and at the University of London (M.Sc., 1992). As a student, she heard about a men-only scholarship offered by Barclays Bank, where she worked as a clerk to pay for her education; she lobbied for the prize and in 1983 won the Barclays Bank Graduate Scholarship. In her early career Ramos worked in banking and finance (in both private- and public-sector jobs), taught economics (1989–94), and served (1990–94) as an economist for the African National Congress’s Department of Economic Planning. In 1996 she was appointed the country’s director general of finance. In that position she worked closely with Finance Minister Trevor Manuel (whom she married in 2008) to strengthen the country’s economy by increasing exports and cutting debt; the two effectively guided South Africa toward a free-market economic model. Ramos held the finance post into 2003."
