Thus, when endometrial proliferation is suspected, hysteroscopy is the most adequate propaedeutic method to evaluate uterine cavity in women, either asymptomatic or with vaginal bleeding, since it provides direct visualization of diffuse or focal abnormalities within the endometrial cavity. Objective: To investigate the correlation between findings derived from direct visualization of the uterine cavity by hysteroscopy and results of uterine cavity biopsy in women provided with care at a referral hospital for gynecology in Recife city, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methodology: Cross-sectional epidemiological study, with a quantitative and retrospective approach, conducted at the âAgamenon MagalhÃ£esâ Hospital, in Recife, a referral institution in specialized gynecological care. Data was obtained from the 68 medical reports issued as results of hysteroscopic examination, collected within the period from September 2015 to March 2016. The study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the âAgamenon MagalhÃ£esâ Hospital. Results: Endometrial thickening caused 36.9% of the hysteroscopic procedures and uterine polyps caused 51.3% of these procedures. The histopathologic reports evidenced the occurrence of endometrial polyps (59%). Analyzing the correlation between hysteroscopy and histopathology showed a concordance of 82.4%. The occurrence of cancer corresponded to 7.35% in the total sample. Among women with cancer, the average age was 62.7 years. Conclusion: The correlation between hysteroscopic findings and sample analysis of the histopathologic study has been considered favorable, thus we may claim that the behavior of methods to support the diagnosis of endometrial pathologies analyzed in this study is effective.\n\nKeywords: Biopsy, Histological techniques, Endometrial neoplasms, Uterine cervix neoplasms, Hysteroscopy"
