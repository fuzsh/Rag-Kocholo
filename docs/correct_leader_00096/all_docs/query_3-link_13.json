        "text": "The gateway\n\nOn a New Year’s Day of a forgotten year in the 80’s, my father decided to walk me through the ancient village of Rachol where he had spent his youth. On the way to the village, he showed me the shop where he and his father worked as tailors stitching cassocks for the priests of the Seminary in the village. I don’t recollect whether I saw the gate way of the Fortaleza, but I do remember going upto the Seminary door which was closed on that day. Next we made our way to the village church situated on the Zuari river bank from where we proceeded to Shiroda– a village on the opposite bank of the river, crossing the river in a canoe. That was some 30 years back.\n\nToday when I revisited that village as part of a Heritage walk, I was armed with some history about the place. Situated on the left bank of the Zuari river, Rachol or Fortaleza de Rachol as it was known during the heydays of the Portuguese rule, was the military centre of the colonial power in the Ilha de Salcette. The Portuguese, I guess, had a penchant for islands. They meticulously studied the geography of the regions they conquered in Goa, and if any region was bordered even by narrow rivers or streams they never failed to name it as an ‘Ilha’- Portuguese for an island. So we have in Goa- Ilha de Goa, Ilha the Rachol, Ilha de Salcette, etc.\n\nA 1630 Portuguese map of Goa showing the Ilha de goa\n\nFortaleza de Rachol\n\nThe fortified perimeter of Rachol was one of the largest European fortified complexes in pre-modern Asia. There is practically nothing left of it today: two churches, the Seminary, the indistinct remnants of the great fortification that surrounded the Church of Our Lady of the Snows, and a monumental door near the Seminary, dating from the beginning of the 17th century.\n\nThe Church of Nossa Senhora das Neves was embraced by the walls of the fortress and the palatial and fortified house that would probably be the Capitao of Rachol. It was described as the “Mother of all Salsete(churches) for being the first”, by Padre Francisco de Sousa, the writer of Oriente Conquistado.\n\nTo the west, at the other end of the perimeter, dominating a hill and the main entrance of the wall, is the old Jesuit College (now seminary). Slightly in the middle, there is the Santo António Chapel.\n\nRachol, also known as Raitura, was ruled by the Muslim Bahmani kingdom known as Bahmani Sultanate and the Sultan of Bijapur under Ismail Adil Shah. The rulers of Vijayanagar and Bijapur fought long battles to take control of this place. It was only in 1520 that King Krishnadevaraya, also known as Krishnaraya, from the Vijayanagar empire with help of the Portuguese took complete control of Rachol. Later the Vijayanagar king Krishnaraya ceded it to the Portuguese in exchange for all the military help against the Muslims and in gratitude for the former’s alliance with him against Adil Shah of Bijapur.\n\nFrom 1554 to 1577 the captain of the Fort was Diogo Rodrigues. It was renovated and rebuilt in 1604, and the fort continued to remain in Portuguese possession over the years, defending the area against Muslim and Hindu attackers, including a siege by the Maratha ruler Sambhaji in 1684, a feat that is marked by the following: Sendo o conde de Alvor vice-rei da India mandou reformar esta fortaleza depois de se defender do cerco de Sambagy, em 22 de abril de 1684 (in English: “The count of Alvor being the viceroy of India ordered the repairs of this fortress after its defense against the siege of Sambhaji, on 22 April 1684”). [Source:Wikipedia]\n\nToday this fort has completely disappeared, leaving behind the traces of the dried-up moat and the main stone gateway.\n\nIgreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves\n\nThe Church of Our Lady of Snows (Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Neves) at Rachol is said to be the first church of Salcette and is called the Matriz (mother church) of South Goa.\n\nThe church located outside the fortress “but beside her”, was founded in 1576 by the Jesuits. It was erected in turbulent times, requiring the protection of the fortress. There had already been within the walls since 1566 a house of the Companhia de Jesus (house of the Jesuits) with a small chapel. The church of 1576 was made of mud. The church of stone and lime was made between 1584 and 1596 and is roughly the one that is there today.\n\nThe church is splendid, seen from west to east in its isolation against the wooded hill that hides the ruins of the fortress. In front of the church is the “terreiro” with the cross and the vast alluvial plain. In the background are the bare heights of the mainland, on the other side of the Zuari.\n\nThere have been two historical burials in the church near the altar: the first was the captain of the Fort (Capitão desta Fortaleza) Diogo Rodrigues in 1577; the second in 1583 being the martyrs of Cuncolim , victims of the Cuncolim Revolt as there was a massacre on Jesuit priests and civilians in Cuncolim, Goa on Monday, 25 July 1583. The martyrs’ bodies remained there until 1597, after which they were shifted to Saint Paul’s College, Goa. All the martyrs’ bodies were finally shifted and laid to rest in Old Goa at the cathedral in 1862. [Source:Wikipedia]\n\nSeminário de Rachol\n\nThe Rachol Seminary, also known today as the Patriarchal Seminary of Rachol, is the diocesan major seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman. The edifice that presently houses the seminary was constructed by the Jesuits with donations from the king of Portugal, Dom Sebastião.\n\nArmas del Rei Dom Sebastiao Fundador do Collegio\n\n(Coat- of-Arms of King Dom Sebastiao, Founder of the college )\n\nThe foundation stone for the main quadrangular portion was blessed and laid on 1 November 1606 by Fr. Gaspar Soares. The first mass in the church (dedicated to All Saints) took place in 1609, and the College was inaugurated in 1610. It was the viceroy, Frei Aleixo de Menezes, who blessed the church, the College, the Hospital, a seminary of poor children, the house of catechumens and the school of doctrine, the various programs that filled the complex.\n\nBut the original church of Rachol College did not survive. The information – though uncertain – was that it was replaced by a new construction that took place between 1622 and 1640. Supposedly in response to the canonization of St. Francis Xavier and St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1622, a new church was dedicated and the name of the College was changed to the “College of St. Ignatius” (Colégio de S. Inácio).\n\nThe College changed hands several times. It remained in the hands of the Jesuits for a century and a half. Having begun as a school for the training of natives, it gradually adopted the curriculum for training Jesuits and later even secular priests from 1646.\n\nIn 1759, the Prime Minister of Portugal, Marquis de Pombal expelled the Jesuits from Goa. So, the College had to be shut down. Three years later, in 1762, Archbishop-Primate Dom António Taveira da Neiva Brum e Silveira, converted this abandoned College into the “Diocesan Seminary of the Good Shepherd”. He entrusted to the native Oratorian Congregation of St. Philip Neri the work of priestly training. This was the first diocesan seminary erected in Asia.\n\nIn 1774, the ruling Royal Treasury Junta of Goa abruptly suppressed the seminary on the pretext that certain conditions were not being fulfilled, the real reason being that of economy.\n\nIn 1781, owing to a mass-petition by the people of Salcete and the Municipality of Margão, the Court of Portugal ordered the seminary to be restored. The Municipality of Salcete even financed the required repairs for the building. The College was thus reopened, and its management was entrusted to the Congregation of the Mission, popularly called Vincentians or Lazarists.\n\nThe Vincentians helped in the administration of the seminary. These priests who came from Italy, brought with them the sacred relics and a vial containing the blood of a Roman saint and martyr, St. Constantius. ( Writer’s note: Not to be confused with the Byzantine Emperor Constantine) The seminary functioned well till 1790, when it was closed down for three years, after the Vincentians left the seminary.\n\nIn 1793, the Oratorians were again deputed to run the diocesan seminary. They continued their work for about forty-two years. In 1835 all religious institutes were forced to shut down in Portugal and in all its possessions.[Source:Wikipedia]\n\nA 1940s aerial photograph of the seminary (Courtesy: Memórias da India Portuguesa)\n\nRachol, since it was a military base, probably was the first place in Salcette where the first Mass was celebrated, though there are conflicting claims that that honour should go to either Cortalim or Verna.\n\nThe heritage walk\n\nThe Rachol heritage walk organized by ‘SoulTravelling’ afforded a wonderful opportunity to savour the history and local legends of this ancient village. Mrs.Mitha Bhandekar, Varun and Ramchandra gave interesting inputs about the life in Rachol in former times. The walk started from the gateway of the ruined fort.\n\nAt the foot of the gateway one could see some coconut shells and candles, a testimony to the superstitious beliefs of the inhabitants in the ritual of lighting candles and breaking coconuts at the gate to attract good luck or success.\n\nThe royal coat-of-arms on the gateway\n\nWe then proceeded to the Rachol seminary to learn something of its history. In the seminary church, towards the left side of the main altar we were shown the cleverly concealed door and latch- probably a place to hide the sacramental especially during the period when the Jesuits came under attack from the native inhabitants of the village. Towards the main door in the left side chapel are the little known relics of St.Constantius, one of the patron saints of Perugia, Italy.\n\nThe main altar in the seminary church\n\nThe main door and the choir above\n\nThe pulpit\n\nIn the courtyard or cloister of the seminary complex, we had a peek into one of its underground cisterns or passage ways.\n\nA peek into the underground cistern\n\nA visit to the local bakery along the way offered a rare glimpse into one of the traditional methods of making bead.\n\nThe village bakery\n\nOn the way to the Rachol church w came across the cemetery which was once the final resting place of one of the most illustrious sons of Goa, the venerable Fr.Agnelo, who collapsed in the pulpit while preaching in the seminary church. His mortal remains were later shifted to the Pilar monastery.\n\nThe cemetary\n\nWe then proceeded to the now renovated wharf which was the unloading point for the merchandise which made its way to the market in Margao since ancient times. It, of course, bears no resemblance to its former status.\n\nAt the wharf\n\nThe walk then wound its way through the courtyard of the Church of Our lady of Snows, whose parish priests–we were told– in former times were never transferred and served the office of the parish priest until their deaths.\n\nOur Lady of Snows Church\n\nThe walk terminated at the new ferry point where a solitary unflustered cockerel trotted on the ramp, perhaps waiting in anticipation for his sweet heart to arrive from across the river.\n\nAn arched bridge\n\nThe River ferry\n\nWe finally trotted back to the starting point at the gateway for some hot Bhajjas, a bhaji-pao and a hot cup of tea.\n\nThe walk back\n\nNumerous European travellers to India in general and to Goa in particulars have left us their accounts of the Inquisition at Goa. Jan Huygen van Linschoten who visited Goa under the patronage of the newly appointed Archbishop Vincente de Fonseca in 1583 remarks, “it is common to them all, and they are under Portugals law, and he that is once christened, and is after found to use any heathenish supersitions, is subject to the Inquisition, whatsoever he be, or for any point of Religion whatsoever”.\n\nFrancois Pyrard de Laval, who was in Goa between 1608 and 1610, observes that the justice administered here was more severe in the case of the richer classes, a point which is important in understanding the operation of the inquisition at Goa.\n\nJohn Fryer, who visited Goa in the late 17th century, gives a vivid eyewitness account of the punishment meted out to the victims of the Inquisition after the “Auto da Fe.”\n\nThe best account of the Inquisition is given by the Frenchman Charles Dellon in his book, “Relation de l’Inquisition de Goa” published in 1687. In this book, Dellon narrates his trial and incarceration by the Inquisition in Goa, and later in Brazil and Lisbon, totaling 18 months. He was accused of denying the validity of baptism and having blasphemed against the adoration of a crucifix, and in addition to having criticized the Inquisition. He was was sentenced to five years in the galleys.\n\nNiccolao Manucci in his “Storia do Mogor” describes the ordeal of Fr.Ephraim of Nevers, a capuchin Franciscan who was lured to Sao Tome from Madras, arrested by the commissary of the inquisition, bound in chains and shipped to Goa. The accusations he was charged with and his defence at the Inquisiton is well documented by Manucci.\n\nThe following account describing the Palace of the Inquisition at Old Goa is an excerpt from the book “An historical and archaeological sketch of the city of Goa” byJose Nicolau Fonseca. An account of the functioning of the inquisition will be covered in a future post.\n\nThe Palace of the Inquisition(Casa da Santa Inquisicao) was located near the Se Cathedral, to the south of its courtyard. This magnificent palace was flanked on both sides by two high-roads, one of which, to the east, was the famous Rua Direita. This palace was, according to the testimony of all travellers, a stately and superb edifice. It had three stories, and a beautiful façade which appears to have been of black stone . Captain Franklin, who visited it, says, ” its black outside appears a fit emblem of the cruel and bloody transactions that passed within its walls.” It was the residence of the Sabaio ( a term used by the Portuguese to refer to Adil Shah of Bijapur from whom they wrested Ilha de Goa) before the Portuguese conquest, and subsequently of the Viceroys and Governors, till 1554.\n\nPalace of the Inquisition (from wikipedia)\n\nSix years later, on the establishment of the tribunal of the Inquisition in India , the vacant palace was appropriated for its use. The Inquisition made the requisite changes to the edifice that were necessary for its operations . It contained many halls and chambers.\n\n(Picture only for illustration)\n\nOne of the halls known as the Mesa do Santo Officio was decked with curtains of green taffeta and in it stood a huge crucifix (now shifted to the St.Sebastian chapel at Fontainhas in Panjim) leaning against the tapestry work, and so raised that it almost touched the ceiling.\n\n(The crucifix now at St.Sebastian Chappel, Panjim?Needs to be verified)\n\nAccording to a tradition current among the inhabitants of Goa, every individual charged with witchcraft, or any offence against the Catholic religion, was placed before this crucifix, when all of a sudden a thrill would appear to pass through his whole body, and trembling from head to foot would at last drop senseless on the ground, incapable of fixing his eyes on it any more.\n\nIn the middle of this hall a dais was raised about a foot high, on which a table nearly fifteen feet long and four feet broad was placed, with chairs for the Inquisitors, the Secretary and other officers, when they examined the culprits brought before them. The edifice had also galleries, a chapel, quarters for the residence of the principal Inquisitor, and a great number of prison cells.\n\nDellon, who was confined as a prisoner in one of its cells in 1674 writes thus, “The house of the Inquisition, which the Portuguese call Santa Casa (Holy House), is situated at one of the sides of the great square in front of the Cathedral dedicated to St. Catherine. This is a large and majestic edifice, having in front three doors, the central one being the largest, and the hall I have spoken of is reached after ascending a staircase by this door. The side doors lead to the chambers of the Inquisitors, each of which is sufficiently large to contain suitable furniture. Besides these there are many other apartments for the accommodation of the officials of the house. Proceeding to the interior, a large two-storied building is visible, divided into many partitions, and separated by a courtyard. Each floor has a gallery in the shape of a dormitory of seven or eight cells, each ten feet square. The number of cells rises to two hundred.\n\n“The cells of one of these dormitories are dark for want of windows, and are lower and smaller than those of the other dormitories ; when I complained one day of harsh and severe treatment, these cells were shown to me, with a view to make me understand that I might have been placed in a much worse situation. The other cells are square-vaulted, whitewashed and clean, into which the light of day is admitted by means of small grated windows without shutters, and placed so high that the tallest man could not reach them.\n\n” The walls, on the whole, are five feet thick ; the cells are shut by means of two doors, one opening into them, the other opening out. The former has two strong iron handles, and when the lower half is left open exhibits a kind of railing with a small window upwards, to allow of the prisoner’s being supplied with food, clothes, and other necessary articles, which were thrown in. This window has a small shutter secured by two strong chains. The other door is neither so strong nor so thick, and is made of a single plank without an opening. It generally remains open from six to eleven in the morning, for ventilation and for purifying the air in the cells.”\n\nThe increased number of the cells was due to the increasing number of arrests made by the orders of the Inquisition. From time to time several other additions continued to be made to the Palace of the Inquisition, so that it became the largest of all the palaces of Goa.\n\nThe tribunal of the Inquisition was initially abolished by a royal letter dated the 10th February 1774.The Marquis of Pombal ordered that the palace should be occupied by the Viceroys and Governors, as in the first years after the conquest. Dom Jose Pedro da Camara, who was Governor and Captain General at the time, pointed out, however, the unfitness of the palace for the residence of the Viceroys, and the extreme inconvenience to which they would be put on account of the alterations that had been made for the accommodation of the late tribunal, not to speak of the expense attendant on the demolition of the numerous cells whilst the remodelling of the building to render it suitable to the Viceroys would, without affording any commensurate advantage\n\nOn the death of Dom. Jose I., the Marquis of Pombal lost his influence at court, and his project of converting the Palace of the Inquisition into the Viceregal residence fell to the ground. The Inquisition being re-established in the reign of Donna Maria I., in 1779, the palace was again set apart for its use.\n\nBut, though revived, it did not retain its original powers, which were considerably curtailed, and was finally abolished in 1812. Thus this famous Palace of the Inquisition was once more closed its rare archives, with some other valuable articles, were transferred to the Arsenal.\n\nDr. Buchanan, the last traveller of distinction, who visited the palace in 1808, just on the eve of its being closed for ever, says that, on entering the spacious hall where the prisoners used to be arrayed before they joined the procession of the Auto da fe, he could not fail to be reminded of the tragic scenes which must have been enacted in that very hall. At the time of his visit the Palace was not in a decayed state, though it required some repairs. The edifice being after wards completely abandoned, began to show signs of dilapidation in 1815, and the decayed parts were pulled down in 1820.\n\nThe Abbe Cottineau, who visited Goa in 1827, could not fail to discern its original grandeur even amidst its ruins. He says : ” Its front, adorned with three lofty vaults and ascended by large stone steps, must have been very handsome ; it is now raised one story above the groundfloor. The breadth is about seventy feet, and as to the length it cannot be ascertained, being surrounded with walls covering about two acres of ground . At present the whole is fast decaying ; there are no doors nor window-cases now existing ; shrubs, thorns, and rubbish choke up the entrance, and the interior must be filled with serpents and other reptiles.”\n\nThe edifice, such as it was about the period of Cottineau’s visit, would have stood a little longer, had it not been razed to the ground in 1828-30 by order of the Government, its materials being employed to erect another building at Pangim. The debris was suffered to remain on the spot till it was removed in 1859, on the occasion of the exposition of the body of St. Francis Xavier. The labourers who were employed in its removal discovered a subterraneous staircase, and human bones buried under a thick piece of lead of the shape of a whale or a boat.\n\nThe Palace of the Inquisition stood, an object of terror and dismay to the common people of Goa, who trembled at the mere mention of its name, and, not daring even to point the finger at it, spoke of it as “Odlem ghor”, or the Great House."
