        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nPortugal discovered and colonized the uninhabited islands in the late 15th century, setting up a sugar-based economy that gave way to coffee and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with African plantation slave labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. While independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the various political parties precipitated repeated changes in leadership and four failed, non-violent coup attempts in 1995, 1998, 2003, and 2009. In 2012, three opposition parties combined in a no confidence vote to bring down the majority government of former Prime Minister Patrice TROVOADA, but in 2014, legislative elections returned him to the office. President Evaristo CARVALHO, of the same political party as Prime Minister TROVOADA, was elected in September 2016, marking a rare instance in which the positions of president and prime minister were held by the same party. Prime Minister TROVOADA resigned at the end of 2018 and was replaced by Jorge BOM JESUS. Carlos Vila NOVA was elected president in early September 2021 and was inaugurated 2 October 2021. New oil discoveries in the Gulf of Guinea may attract increased attention to the small island nation.\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Africa, islands in the Gulf of Guinea, just north of the Equator, west of Gabon\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n1 00 N, 7 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 964 sq km\n\nland: 964 sq km\n\nwater: 0 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 184\n\nArea - comparative\n\nmore than five times the size of Washington, DC\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n209 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12 nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200 nm\n\nmeasured from claimed archipelagic baselines\n\nClimate\n\ntropical; hot, humid; one rainy season (October to May)\n\nTerrain\n\nvolcanic, mountainous\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Pico de Sao Tome 2,024 m\n\nlowest point: Atlantic Ocean 0 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nfish, hydropower\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 50.7% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 9.1% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 40.6% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 1% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 28.1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 21.2% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n100 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nSao Tome, the capital city, has roughly a quarter of the nation's population; Santo Antonio is the largest town on Principe; the northern areas of both islands have the highest population densities as shown in this population distribution map\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflooding\n\nGeography - note\n\nthe second-smallest African country (after the Seychelles); the two main islands form part of a chain of extinct volcanoes and both are mountainous\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n217,164 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 183\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Sao Tomean(s)\n\nadjective: Sao Tomean\n\nEthnic groups\n\nMestico, Angolares (descendants of Angolan slaves), Forros (descendants of freed slaves), Servicais (contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cabo Verde), Tongas (children of servicais born on the islands), Europeans (primarily Portuguese), Asians (mostly Chinese)\n\nLanguages\n\nPortuguese 98.4% (official), Forro 36.2%, Cabo Verdian 8.5%, French 6.8%, Angolar 6.6%, English 4.9%, Lunguie 1%, other (including sign language) 2.4%; note - shares sum to more than 100% because some respondents gave more than one answer on the census; other Portuguese-based Creoles are also spoken (2012 est.)\n\nReligions\n\nCatholic 55.7%, Adventist 4.1%, Assembly of God 3.4%, New Apostolic 2.9%, Mana 2.3%, Universal Kingdom of God 2%, Jehovah's Witness 1.2%, other 6.2%, none 21.2%, unspecified 1% (2012 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nSao Tome and Principeâs youthful age structure â more than 60% of the population is under the age of 25 â and high fertility rate ensure future population growth. Although Sao Tome has a net negative international migration rate, emigration is not a sufficient safety valve to reduce already high levels of unemployment and poverty. While literacy and primary school attendance have improved in recent years, Sao Tome still struggles to improve its educational quality and to increase its secondary school completion rate. Despite some improvements in education and access to healthcare, Sao Tome and Principe has much to do to decrease its high poverty rate, create jobs, and increase its economic growth.\n\nThe population of Sao Tome and Principe descends primarily from the islandsâ colonial Portuguese settlers, who first arrived in the late 15th century, and the much larger number of African slaves brought in for sugar production and the slave trade. For about 100 years after the abolition of slavery in 1876, the population was further shaped by the widespread use of imported unskilled contract laborers from Portugalâs other African colonies, who worked on coffee and cocoa plantations. In the first decades after abolition, most workers were brought from Angola under a system similar to slavery. While Angolan laborers were technically free, they were forced or coerced into long contracts that were automatically renewed and extended to their children. Other contract workers from Mozambique and famine-stricken Cape Verde first arrived in the early 20th century under short-term contracts and had the option of repatriation, although some chose to remain in Sao Tome and Principe.\n\nTodayâs Sao Tomean population consists of mesticos (creole descendants of the European immigrants and African slaves that first inhabited the islands), forros (descendants of freed African slaves), angolares (descendants of runaway African slaves that formed a community in the south of Sao Tome Island and today are fishermen), servicais (contract laborers from Angola, Mozambique, and Cape Verde), tongas (locally born children of contract laborers), and lesser numbers of Europeans and Asians.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 39.77% (male 42,690/female 41,277)\n\n15-24 years: 21.59% (male 23,088/female 22,487)\n\n25-54 years: 31.61% (male 32,900/female 33,834)\n\n55-64 years: 4.17% (male 4,095/female 4,700)\n\n65 years and over: 2.87% (male 2,631/female 3,420) (2020 est.)\n\n2022 population pyramid\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 77.9\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 71.2\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 6.7\n\npotential support ratio: 14.9 (2021 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 19.3 years\n\nmale: 18.9 years\n\nfemale: 19.7 years (2020 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 204\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n1.48% (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 65\n\nBirth rate\n\n28.19 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 36\n\nDeath rate\n\n6.2 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 149\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-7.19 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 214\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nSao Tome, the capital city, has roughly a quarter of the nation's population;

Cocoa production has substantially declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome depends heavily on imports of food, fuels, most manufactured goods, and consumer goods, and changes in commodity prices affect the countryâs inflation rate. Maintaining control of inflation, fiscal discipline, and increasing flows of foreign direct investment into the nascent oil sector are major economic problems facing the country. In recent years the government has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies. In 2017, several business-related laws were enacted that aim to improve the business climate.\n\nÂ\n\nSÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. In April 2011, the country completed a Threshold Country Program with The Millennium Challenge Corporation to help increase tax revenues, reform customs, and improve the business environment. In 2016, Sao Tome and Portugal signed a five-year cooperation agreement worth approximately $64 million, some of which will be provided as loans. In 2017, China and SÃ£o TomÃ© signed a mutual cooperation agreement in areas such as infrastructure, health, and agriculture worth approximately $146 million over five years.\n\nÂ\n\nConsiderable potential exists for development of tourism, and the government has taken steps to expand tourist facilities in recent years. Potential also exists for the development of petroleum resources in SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe's territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, some of which are being jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but production is at least several years off.\n\nÂ\n\nVolatile aid and investment inflows have limited growth, and poverty remains high. Restricteded capacity at the main port increases the periodic risk of shortages of consumer goods. Contract enforcement in the countryâs judicial system is difficult. The IMF in late 2016 expressed concern about vulnerabilities in the countryâs banking sector, although the country plans some austerity measures in line with IMF recommendations under their three year extended credit facility.

in 2021, there were 34 reported incidents of piracy and armed robbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea region; although a significant decrease from the total number of 81 incidents in 2020, it included the one hijacking and three of five ships fired upon worldwide; while boarding and attempted boarding to steal valuables from ships and crews are the most common types of incidents, almost a third of all incidents involve a hijacking and/or kidnapping; in 2021, 57 crew members were kidnapped in seven separate incidents in the Gulf of Guinea, representing 100% of kidnappings worldwide; Nigerian pirates in particular are well armed and very aggressive, operating as far as 200 nm offshore; the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation has issued a Maritime Advisory (2022-001 - Gulf of Guinea-Piracy/Armed Robbery/Kidnapping for Ransom) effective 4 January 2022, which states in part, \"Piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom continue to serve as significant threats to US-flagged vessels transiting or operating in the Gulf of Guinea\""
