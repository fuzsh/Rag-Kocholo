        "text": "Main Text\n\nWhite-nose syndrome (WNS), also called white-nose disease (WND) [1, 2, 3], is an emergent bat disease first reported in 2006 [4], caused by a novel fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus (=Geomyces) destructans (Pd) [4, 5, 6]. Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a psychrophilic dermatophyte which has caused severe pathogenic effects in North American hibernating bats, leading up to catastrophic mortality rates, with over 6 million dead [3, 6, 7]. WND has turned into one of the most devastating wildlife epidemics in the recorded history of United States of America (US). Clinical signs of WND in bats include the distinctive presence of white fungal proliferation on glabrous skin of wings, ears and muzzle, cutaneous lesions, frequent arousal from torpor during hibernation, premature depletion of fat reserves, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance [1, 2, 4]. WND exhibits some of the worst possible epidemiological characteristics: (a) a highly virulent pathogen (Pd); (b) long-lasting persistence in hibernacula; (c) viability of conidia at elevated temperatures (24-37°C) suggesting survival on or within the bodies of bats and enabling long-distance dispersal; (d) a frequency and density-dependent transmission; and (e) a wide range of bat host species [8, 9].\n\nIn North America, WND has spread rapidly [10], having been identified in 33 US states and 7 Canadian provinces so far; meanwhile, Pd has been detected in 5 additional states. Bats represent approximately one-fifth of the total mammalian diversity [11], and as \"key species’ in several ecosystems, play pivotal roles in plant pollination and control of insect populations, preventing huge losses in crops and forest production [12]. Over half of the 47 bat species living in the US and Canada depend on hibernation for winter survival [7]. Presently, 12 bat species, two of them endangered (Myotis grisescens and Myotis sodalis) and one threatened (Myotis septentrionalis), have been confirmed with WND in North America, which poses a risk for regional extinction in these populations [7, 13]. Hence, the massive bat population decline resulted from WND has caused severe ecological disequilibrium in ecosystems, and the loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses of over $3.7 billion/year [13].\n\nGlobally, the fungus has been recorded in the majority of European countries and in China [1, 3, 8, 11, 14, 15], despite no mass mortality having been detected. In the Palearctic region, Pd has been detected in at least 21 bat species, highlighting its worldwide presence [7, 8, 15]. The majority of research studies corroborate the theory that Pd was introduced to North America from Europe [16, 17, 18], probably due to global trading or tourism. Its astonishingly rapid dispersion and epidemic character illustrates a classic case of the introduction of a highly lethal novel pathogen into a naïve host population, for example the well-known cases of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis in amphibians, Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola in snakes, and Cryptococcus gattii in mammals [18-21].\n\nGiven the worldwide dispersion of Pd, understanding population structure and genetic diversity, and recombination is of utmost importance in understanding pathogen evolution, adaptation, and virulence [22, 23]. The presence of two different mating-types in same hibernacula in Europe, mating-type 1 (MAT 1-1) and mating-type 2 (MAT 1-2), hinted that Pd populations are undergoing meiosis [24]. However, numerous research attempts have been carried out worldwide and it has been noticed that the population expansion is clonal throughout. Phylogeographic studies based on strains collected from Eastern Europe and adjacent Russia [8], and from different Central and Western European countries across different years [17], did not report any recombination. Similarly, a clonal expansion of Pd has been reported repeatedly among different US states and Canadian provinces [12, 18, 25-28].\n\nIn the present study, a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) approach was undertaken using five loci to study the population genetics of 17 Pd isolates collected from hibernating bats in Portugal (Table S1). A total of eight haplotypes were found in the data (Fig. S1). Mean allelic diversity within Portuguese strains of Pd was 0.6176 ± 0.0556. Genetic diversity and related details, and phylogenetic trees based on each locus are presented in supplementary information (Table S2 and Figs. S2-S7). To identify evidences of genetic recombination among fungal populations, different tests were used. A concatenated alignment from five loci was analyzed using DnaSP version 5.10.01 [29] and at least one event of genetic recombination in history (Rm [30]) was detected among MAT1-1 strains. Clear phylogenetic conflicts were noticed among different gene trees (Fig. 1), thus rejecting linkage disequilibrium.\n\nMoreover, index of association (IA) and its modified statistics (rBarD) [31] were calculated to verify the null hypothesis of no linkage disequilibrium among loci, or recombination among the population from Portugal. Population haplotype data was analyzed with and without clone-correction as an earlier study has stressed on the sampling bias during fungal epidemics [23], and clone-correction has been successfully used in detecting recombination among populations of human and animal pathogenic fungi [19, 21]. In the five-locus based haplotype analysis of Portuguese Pd population, different sets with a minimum of three of more loci were tested for linkage disequilibrium analyses. No clone-correction failed to accept the null hypothesis of linkage equilibrium among loci (Tables 1 and S3). However, recombination was detected in the majority of the locus combinations while maintaining eight unique haplotypes in the clone-corrected data (Tables 1 and S4). Therefore, the clone-correction approach was further tested with the allele data from studies conducted earlier in different parts of Europe [8, 17]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data from North America [28] was also tested.\n\nBy analyzing a previous European study [8], recombination was not found in the original data (Table S5), however, it was detected in clone-corrected haplotype data (Table S6) of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 populations of Pd from Eastern Europe and adjacent Russia (IA=0.256281, P=0.1797; rBarD = 0.0865197, P=0.1797) (Table1). Similarly, while original data of Pd populations collected from several Western and Central European countries and along different years [17] (Table S7) failed to reject linkage disequilibrium, the clone-corrected multilocus data (Table S8) yielded signs of recombination (IA = 0.74026, P = 0.116; rBarD = 0.148111, P = 0.116) (Table 1).\n\nIn North America, an earlier study reported clonal accumulation of mutations in 22 Pd strains [28]. To analyze recombination in the population history, they incorporated only those genomic positions where SNPs were reported in at least two strains, i.e., minor allele was represented at least two times (Table S9). We also considered this criterion. Moreover, to ensure accurate clone-correction, the genomic position with reoccurring missing information (14231511) was removed from the analyses. Out of the remaining ten positions, two of them, 4641354 and 4641566 were in very close proximity, and therefore two sets of nine positions were tested for linkage disequilibrium in North American Pd population, with and without clone-correction (Tables S9, S10 and S11). With all 22 strains, the clone-not-corrected data supported linkage disequilibrium among two sets of nine positions (IA = 0.875542, P = 0.001; rBarD = 0.110593, P = 0.001) and (IA = 1.19423, P < 0.001; rBarD = 0.150847, P < 0.001). However, clone-corrected data with seven strains and nine genomic positions (Table S10) rejected linkage disequilibrium among them (IA = 0.289888, P = 0.2177; rBarD = 0.0363383, P = 0.2177). Similarly another set of clone-corrected data with six strains and nine positions (Table S11) resulted in the detection of genetic recombination in North-American populations (IA = 0.461538, P = 0.1696; rBarD = 0.0577395, P = 0.1696) (Table 1).\n\nBeing the first study to report genetic evidence of sex in the causative agent of WNS or WND, since its discovery in 2006, highlights how little we know about the ecology of Pd. The present finding raises some relevant questions: (a) does the occurrence of sexual MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 recombination between strains of Pd throughout loom an outbreak in Europe?, (b) was WNS or WND also caused by a sudden invasion of a highly-virulent lineage that was recombining sexually in Europe, as was the case of the rapid expansion of frog chytridiomycosis through a hypervirulent recombining lineage of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis [32]?"
