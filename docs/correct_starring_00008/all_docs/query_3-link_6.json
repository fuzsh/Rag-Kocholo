However, the role kind of called for it - the movie has more than a hint of the surreal - kind of like Dark City - both surreal and neo-noir.\n\nPosted by wadewilson\n\nMember since Sep 2009\n\n36944 posts\n\nto deuce\n\nquote:\n\nMy personal take is that while there are some strong moments in the scene for him, when he gets to the \"oh goddd\" the delivery seems so odd and out of place (perhaps this was his goal) that I'd have to go with bad acting (since any bad acting in an individual scene outweighs the good).\n\nI think it went along with his propensity towards reacting angrily and violently throughout the entire movie.\n\nI mean shite, just look at his reaction about 10 seconds after opening Dante's Inferno.\n\nPosted by DirtyMikeandtheBoys\n\nMember since May 2011\n\n19431 posts\n\nto deuce\n\nHis actions are awkward to watch.\n\nI wonder if it wouldn't have been better to go almost emotionless with shock/curiosity instead.\n\nI would have like to see him play it cool, less screams/crys. More controlled questions. He could show his torment through facial expressions well enough. The internal struggle, and then the shock would send him into an almost zen state.\n\nAnd then bam, he shoots Spacey's fricking head off.\n\nIt would have been a nice addition to his character, who is clearly in the struggle for the sin of wrath, to completely change his personality the in the instant when he fails/succeeds with his struggle.\n\nThis post was edited on 3/7/14 at 12:38 pm\n\nPosted by Baloo\n\nFormerly MDGeaux\n\nMember since Sep 2003\n\n49645 posts\n\nto deuce\n\nI'm a fan of Brad Pitt's work and think he is a great supporting actor cursed with leading man good looks (he'd enjoy a better reputation as an actor if he looked like Steve Buscemi).\n\nThat said, the what's in the box scene is not one of his high points. It's pretty bad.\n\nPosted by DirtyMikeandtheBoys\n\nMember since May 2011\n\n19431 posts\n\nto wadewilson\n\nquote:\n\nI think it went along with his propensity towards reacting angrily and violently throughout the entire movie.\n\nI mean shite, just look at his reaction about 10 seconds after opening Dante's Inferno.\n\nHis aggression throughout the movie comes from his internal struggle with wrath.\n\nOnce he accepts his fate, whether he considers it successful or failure on his part, his personality should change. He should be calm and calculating in that moment.\n\nETA:\n\nI should be a director\n\nThis post was edited on 3/7/14 at 12:43 pm\n\nPosted by wadewilson\n\nMember since Sep 2009\n\n36944 posts\n\nto DirtyMikeandtheBoys\n\nquote:\n\nOnce he accepts his fate, whether he considers it successful or failure on his part, his personality should change. He should be calm and calculating in that moment.\n\nI don't think so. Somerset even comments earlier in the movie \"It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions\". It was expected for Mills to react poorly to seeing his wife's head in a box. I'm surprised he didn't shoot himself too.\n\nPosted by DirtyMikeandtheBoys\n\nMember since May 2011\n\n19431 posts\n\nto wadewilson\n\nExactly. He has been feeding off his emotions because of the existence of his struggle.\n\nOnce the stuggle is over, the feeding off his emotions is over.\n\nHe is no longer fighing the wrath. He has accepted it, which should allow for clarity in his decision making, calmness in his demeanor, and calculation in his reaction.\n\nHe should have taken on a personality like Spacey's character in that scene. It would have warped the minds of Sommersett and Spacey. Their reactions to his this change would have been epic. Everything would have culminated over the entire course of 5 minutes or so instead of the last 2 seconds when he finally squeezes the trigger.\n\nPosted by SPEEDY\n\n2005 Tiger Smack Poster of the Year\n\nMember since Dec 2003\n\n83658 posts\n\nto deuce\n\nIt was bad\n\nBrad Pitt needs to be eating something in order for him to deliver a believable performance\n\nHe is at his best when he is delivering lines while eating food\n\nThis post was edited on 3/7/14 at 1:35 pm\n\nPosted by GCTiger11\n\nOcean Springs, MS\n\nMember since Jan 2012\n\n45233 posts\n\nto deuce\n\nI may be in the minority, but I thought it was good acting. I couldn't tell you how one is supposed to act after finding out their wife's head is in a box and that she was pregnant.\n\nPosted by Mad_Mardigan\n\nBaton Rouge\n\nMember since Aug 2012\n\n1926 posts\n\nto DirtyMikeandtheBoys\n\nHe wasn't struggling the entire movie with wrath. It was in the instance that he saw his wife's head in a box and shot John Doe when he committed the sin of Wrath. Mills \"becomes\" wrath at the end as John Doe explains."
