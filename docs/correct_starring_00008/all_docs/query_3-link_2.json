        "text": "There are few greater thrillers in existence than David Fincher’s sublimely grotesque Se7en – a bitter, nihilistic, resentful portrait of humanity at its lowest and most despicably decrepit, with brief flashes of light and optimism interwoven throughout. And at the heart of every great serial killer film, of course, is a memorable villain for our cunning detectives to contend with: The Silence of the Lambs had Hannibal Lecter; the Saw franchise had Jigsaw; M had Peter Lorre’s grovelling turn as Hans Beckert in one of the most gut-wrenching performances ever put to screen. But Se7en, I would argue, tops them all and then some: John Doe lies at its centre, an embodiment of facelessness turned evil incarnate, and perhaps the finest sadist to ever grace our cinema screens… which is admittedly quite the achievement.\n\nREASON #1: The Performance of a Lifetime\n\nIn hindsight it may not appear overly impressive for Kevin Spacey to portray a remorseless psychopath with zero empathy to who he hurts and a complete disregard for human decency… but back in 1995, at arguably the peak of his career (he won Best Supporting Actor for The Usual Suspects that same year), this was — and remains today — a masterclass in cruelty and evil, equal parts relentlessly cold as it was sadistically transfixing. His default mode is apathy for the majority of his screentime and yet captivates every second of it — he less chews the scenery and more disapprovingly mumbles at its texture, yet commands every moment on screen in the playfully cruel way only Kevin Spacey can. From his agitated bellowing of “DETECTIVE!” at the Police Station, smothered in blood, to the chillingly vapid tone in which almost every subsequent line of dialogue is delivered, Spacey provides a presence, poise, and emotionally empty detachment that helps makes John Doe, in startlingly little screen time, so utterly unforgettable.\n\nREASON #2: The Precision of a Madman\n\nAlthough many serial killers are terrifying in how unpredictable, inhumane, and purely chaotic their actions are, the poise and precision of John Doe — dubbed, in one corner, “insane” by Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and, in the other, “methodical, exacting and, worst of all, patient” by Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) — is part of what makes his superficial craziness all the more disturbing. He is neither unhinged nor senseless and always acts with a calculating resolve; it takes an uncomfortable amount of willpower to keep the Sloth Victim bed-bound for an entire year, or to boldly enter a BDSM shop and order the ungodly contraption he uses on Lust, or even to spend a weekend shovelling tomato soup into a overweight man’s bowl purely to spite his perceived gluttony — even returning to the supermarket, presumably drenched in an ungodly smell, to do a bit of grocery shopping at half-time — and yet Doe, with a smile on his face no less, does so. His determination is terrifying, and at every stage he is toying with the police until surrender, and even then, in words no-one ever wants to hear over the radio, “John Doe [still!] has the upper hand.”\n\nREASON #3: The Brutality of a Killer\n\nWhen David Fincher — the glorified sadist responsible for bringing Gone Girl‘s champagne-rape, Zodiac‘s entire story, and the utterly dreadful line “I haven’t been f*cked like that since grade school,” to our collective minds — decides that a scene is far too ungodly to properly depict on-screen, you know that the Lust sequence in Se7en must have been majorly f*cked up. Past this, of course, Se7en never, ever shows any restraint in what it wishes to depict, and is among the greatest horror films of all time partly because of how disturbing it is without ever crossing the line into senseless gore. The Sloth scene, in particular, springs to mind as both an all-time brilliant jump scare and an all-time classic example of the prosthetics department going off the rails in the absolute best way possible. And all the relentless cruelty at the heart of Se7en – including the climactic Box – stems directly from John Doe himself… the sick, sick b*stard, a messiah of misery.\n\nREASON #4: The Corruption of a Hero\n\nAt one corner of Se7en is William Somerset, an aging detective on the cusp of retirement after watching his city crumble beneath nihilism and cruelty for a decade. In the other, at the heart of the story, is David Mills, an up-and-coming detective recently reassigned to said city who still has just enough pep in his step to reject Somerset’s outlook on life: his spirits are yet to be crushed, he still, perhaps foolishly, believes goodness can be found beneath the city’s gritty chic. It is this innocence, optimism and, at a flash, naivety that corrupts slowly-but-surely over the run-time of Se7en — his temper is demonstrated early on when hurling obscenities at the Photographer (in hindsight, knowing that was Doe, hurling a chair wouldn’t have even sufficed) and erupted in the climax when, after the murder of his wife and unborn child, he embodies Wrath and executes the villain in cold-blood. John Doe, consequently, wins: he takes the newest White Knight of the city and corrupts his soul, not even prompting an out-of-character reaction but instead untethering an in-some-ways inevitable one. Of the three, he may be the only one to literally die, but his masterpiece is nonetheless complete.\n\nREASON #5: The Falsity of a Prophet\n\nOne of the greatest traits a villain can possess is that they are the hero of their own story — not motivated purely by power or evil the pennies in your piggybank, but truly, instead, out of the the belief they are superheroes. The uneasiness of John Doe, subsequently, is that he, in his world, is not just a hero; he is a Prophet — a messenger for God, exercising his will on Earth. He lectures Somerset and Mills on the nature of innocence and its relationship with the sinner, claiming that “Only in a world this sh*tty would you call these people innocent” and phrases his belief with such a warped, sickening logic that though never justified or empathetic… you see how right he is in his own brain. The brilliance of the monologue – written by Andrew Kevin Walker, an unsung hero of Se7en – is that while anyone in their right mind would never agree with Doe’s slightly OTT take on humanity, the uncomfortable mixture of regrettably commonplace beliefs — that overweight people are disgusting, or that sex workers are despicable — and vigilante “justice” make his standpoint eerily realistic and believable. There is no self-awareness in his actions like Hannibal Lecter or even the slightest tinge of regret a la M — he is pure-evil motivated by an undying belief he is pure-good, even further rooted in the ideals many may tragically still hold. And that, frankly, is far, far scarier than any piggybank thief could ever hope to be."
