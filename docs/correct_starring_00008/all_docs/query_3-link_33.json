        "text": "Why David Fincher’s Masterpiece Was Actually a Tribute to Horror and A Better Version of Horror Films to Come\n\nMultiple times when I was reading the otherwise superb magazine Entertainment Weekly, they referred to the classic The Silence of The Lambs as ‘the only horror movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.”\n\nTo be fair, I can understand why certain film scholars might think in those terms. Yes Hannibal Lecter is one of the great monsters in history. I am reminded that Roger Ebert once referred to a vampire as ‘basically a cannibal with table manners’ which perfectly sums up Hannibal Lecter. And there are certainly elements of the film that have that appearance, particularly Clarice Starling’s descent to his Lecter’s cell and the tension that fills everyone of their initial confrontations. But while Silence of The Lambs is a brilliant suspense film and clearly a thriller, that does not necessarily mean it is a horror film. Alfred Hitchcock was very good at walking the fine line between the genres throughout his career but only some of this films are clearly on the other side of it: Psycho and The Birds yes, Lifeboat and Vertigo, no.\n\nI think far fewer people will dispute me when I think that the extraordinary Seven, David Fincher’s official coming out party in the world of movies, far more deserves to be considered a horror film than Silence of The Lambs does. I think that is why when Roger Ebert listed the film in what would be his final book of Great Movies he admitted it was a masterpiece but couldn’t understand all the reasons why. I think it’s because he was looking it under the trope of the mystery when its far more clearly to that of horror. Indeed, the film received several nominations from organization that give prizes for Horror, including the Saturn Award (though it was nominated as an action film)\n\nConsider the fact that we never know where the film takes place. The city is never identified, all we know is that always dark, usually raining and looms over all the major characters. It’s actually shocking that the climax of the film takes place in the middle of what essentially a landscape: we didn’t think there was a deserted area in this city. None of the characters in the dialogue give a hint as to where we are, even so far as to say the state. One is reminded of Dark City which came out just a few years later (another film Ebert considered a masterpiece as much for the setting as the plot). At one point in that film, we learn there is nothing beyond the city and it seems just as much the same in Seven.\n\nI have little doubt Ebert was inclined to think that the film was a mystery: this is the kind of setting that we fundamentally consider as film noir (Dark City seemed to exist on a planet that was modeled after those kind of films). But in a sense that is just as keeping with so many horror films that had come before. Most of the slasher films that had come before the setting itself was irrelevant: we didn’t know where Elm Street was or what town Crystal Lake was close too; all we know was that there was a madman on the loose, and if you momentarily led your guard down, he would strike and kill you horribly.\n\nIndeed, the methods of the killing throughout Seven are far more keeping in line with the traditional horror film (though to be fair, the serial killer genre that was about to become part of the TV landscape would have fine with the killings here). From the moment that Mills and Somerset begin their investigation, it is clear that the killings are being done by a fanatic who is obsessed with the seven deadly sins. The way that he commits his murders are actually more keeping with the fundamental killings of horror, if you think about it.\n\nHe leaves his work on display; he clearly is proud of his work. Oddly, while many horror films focus on gore, Fincher rarely lets us see the whole nature of the awfulness of the crimes. Much more is done by implication: the medical examiner telling us a victim died by eating himself to death, the way we see a pound of flesh weighing on a scale, a sharp weapon that makes it very clear what it was used for. Perhaps more interesting is the fact that in the five murders that we see the killer has committed, in none of them did he actually orchestrate the act that led to the victim’s death; in the case of sloth, he’s actually left the victim alive but in a place that is a far worse fate. I have never seen any of the movies in the Saw franchise, but I am reminded of the scenarios in the trailers that we here Tobin Bell related to the victims he has left behind to essentially face the worst fate imaginable. (There’s another commonality which I’ll get to later on.)\n\nThis brings me to the next point. Almost no one in the film is given a name. I don’t just mean the victims, many of whom are identified in the credits only by the sin that the killer has used; I mean almost everybody else. Looking through the end credits of the film, the only characters who are identified by name specifically are Brad Pitt’s David Mills, Gwynneth Paltrow’s Tracy and Morgan Freeman’s Somerset (we never even learn Somerset’s name in the film, making him more anonymous) Almost everyone else in the credit is identified by their job: Police Captain, DA, Defense attorney, medical examiner. John C. McGinley’s operation officer is called California, but that’s a nickname and we never know how he got it.. Some of them are identified in the dialogue but they don’t seem to matter much. Fincher fundamentally relies on the actors themselves to express more with their personalities and when you have so many great character actors in your film such as R. Lee Ermey, Richard Roundtree, Reg E. Cathey and smaller roles played by Richard Schiff, Leland Orser and Michael Massee, you don’t need to know anything more.\n\nDavid Fincher would later go on to make several masterpieces in the mystery genre, among them Zodiac, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl but at the end of the day I think in mood and style is far closer to his follow-up film, the vastly underrated The Game. All of the movies are as much about atmosphere as plot but both The Game and Se7en fundamentally make you feel like the ground is always being pulled out from under your feet.\n\nThere were many who laid the surprising box office success of the film (it grossed over $100 million domestic and nearly $330 million worldwide) almost on the appeal of Brad Pitt, who was just in the start of becoming the sexiest man in Hollywood. There is also a general consensus that this isn’t one of Pitt’s better performances, which few would argue. That said Pitt was not yet the brilliant actor he would become in the next several years (he would receive his first Oscar nomination for 12 Monkeys the same year Se7en came out, which did show signs of his potential) and having watched him over the last thirty years I am fundamentally inclined to think that directors like Quentin Tarantino and Andrew Dominik were far better at getting the best possible performances out of Pitt than Fincher has been.\n\nWhat Pitt does perfectly is play the notes of the wide-eyed rookie who clashes with authority and every turn. When Mills and Somerset are clashing throughout every aspect of the movie, Se7en has much of its best energy. And in a sense it is a necessity to have a character like David Mills in this movie with Pitt’s enthusiasm: he spends almost the entire film chafing at how beaten down everybody in the movie seems to be by the city and is determined not to let it. He needs to be that way for the final half-hour to work.\n\nMore remarkable, frankly, is Gwynneth Paltrow as Tracy. Paltrow was only twenty two when Se7en was being made and as you might recall, romantically connected with Pitt. She had previously appeared in small roles mostly in films where no one noticed her or art films that nobody watched. This was her first major role of significance and it’s astonishing how completely she nails it.\n\nTracy should be the ultimate thankless role — she’s the wife of one of the detectives and they are almost always window dressing in any movie. She is also fundamentally helpless and meek, which is not a characteristic you tend to associate with most female characters in Fincher’s films, certainly not the characters Helena Bonham Carter, Rooney Mara and Rosamund Pike have played. Tracy is that rarest of things: she is a supportive presence who is being beaten down by the city very quickly. Tracy has to seem this way in her few scenes for the impact of the ending to hit us the way it does and Paltrow’s nails it perfectly. After this she began to get cast in the kind of roles she was entitled too, though she has never received the respect as either an actress or the individual she is.\n\nThe movie, of course, rises and sets on Morgan Freeman as Somerset. Roger Ebert once said he’d never seen Freeman give a bad performance and I do believes that’s true. Freeman has always had gravitas and just an often capable of playing world-weariness. He rarely has gotten a chance to use them to better effect than he did in Se7en. Somerset should be the character who reminds us of Murtagh in Lethal Weapon — when the movie begins he is a week away from retiring and he doesn’t like his young partner. But Freeman isn’t retiring to be with his family; he’s retiring because the job has beaten him. There’s a vivid description early in the film he gives to the captain about why he wants to quit and it’s the kind of thing that clearly is running through every aspect of his performance. He knows from the start what kind of killer he’s up against and he knows just how to catch him.\n\nAs the case progresses, however, we witness something about Somerset. There is a part of him that is truly fascinating by what the killer is doing. He spends a lot of time going through the research, trying to figure out the next step. Near the end of the movie, he is telling Mills that even though it’s his last day he’ll stay on until this case is resolved. An earlier scene has made it likely that they will never catch the killer. What does that say about Somerset? That he wants to catch this man and bring him to justice or that he will not be able to rest until he truly understands this killer.\n\nA side note. Before I first saw the movie I saw a literary adaptation of the film in my library and read it. It was far superior to most novel adaptations of screenplays as it tried to fill in blanks that might not have been in the film. There’s a scene in the book. The detectives have found the killer’s apartment and the journals he’s been keeping. We see Somerset read them in the movie but says they’re hopeless in figuring out who the killer is. In the book, Somerset can’t sleep that night and is considering getting a book out. He admits to himself that the only thing he really wants to read is the killer’s journals. The prose in the journals is very close to Somerset’s opinions of the city and mankind.\n\nConsider the scene when Somerset and Mills are driving the killer in the leadup to the climax. Mills treats him with disdain and contempt. Somerset treats him with respect that seems far more than trying to understand what the man he’s been chasing does. Does Somerset see something of the mindset of the killer in himself? Is that the real reason he’s been chasing him?\n\nI should note right now that in both his original review of the film and the Great Books review, Roger Ebert does not say the actor who plays the killer. Since it’s been nearly thirty years I don’t think I’m spoiling anything to say that it’s Kevin Spacey. Frankly, if you’d followed the awards cycle in 1995 it would have been hard to avoid that fact. Spacey would receive the Best Supporting Actor Prize from both the New York Film Critics and the National Board of Review, and because critics group will honor actor for a group of performances in the course of the same year, he won for both Se7en and The Usual Suspects. He would also tie for the Critics Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor with Ed Harris and receive the prize for Best Villain from the MTV Movie Awards which also named it the Best Movie.\n\nIn retrospect it’s kind of remarkable what John Doe and Verbal Kent have in common. Both are criminal masterminds capable of hiding their secrets of everyone around them, both are capable of hiding in plain sight, both are capable of completely manipulating law enforcement under their noses and both completely get away with their crimes. And while John Doe is clearly more insane that Verbal, both men are soft spoken in their scenes. The only time John slightly raises his voice is when Mills questions whether the people he killed are actually innocent and when he mocks Mills about his ability to catch him. Otherwise Doe is completely calm through the final scene.\n\nThis is another reason why John Doe is clearly similar to many of the ones in slasher films: Jason and Michael Myers never said a word when they killed their victims. It also explains why Roger Ebert could not understand why John was doing what he was doing. He understood that John thought he was making a statement but couldn’t understand the nature of it. (I don’t think he had it in him to understand the idea of the copycat murder even though versions of it were common in procedurals even then.) Now consider how each sequel to the Scream film unfolds with each new killer taking on the methods of the idea of Ghostface. Or how so many movies in the Saw franchise involve acolytes of the original Jigsaw.\n\nI’m also reminded of the Joker in John Doe’s work, more so the most famous film versions than the ones in the comic book. Heath Ledger’s, like John Doe, has no identity beyond the clothes on his back; Doe has made sure he has no fingerprints. The Joker claims to be an agent of chaos but he clearly has a master plan. Remember Joaquin Phoenix’s versions whose actions in the movie inspired a series of clown-faced acolytes around Gotham in the climax. I can see both version being inspired by the action of John Doe.\n\nNow comes the ending which I will never be able to find a flaw in. There is the fact that Morgan Freeman, from the moment he sees what’s in the box that’s been delivered is terrified as he says: “John Doe has the upper hand.” Freeman’s performance is pure desperation. He has to talk down Mills from killing Doe even though he is trying to invoke intellect and logic over pure emotion. His tone from the moment he arrives is that of someone who knows he will fail. Spacey is completely calm in the scene that follows never raising his voice, never showing off. He knows he doesn’t even have to show the box to Mills. He knows he’s won. He closes his eyes in the final moments with a beatific smile on his face.\n\nAnd yes I know that Pitt’s final moments have been mocked on the internet and pop culture. But I don’t think anyone can argue about what happens after his outburst. He calmly walks up to Doe, shoots him in the head and then empties his gun. Our last shot of him shows him, staring blankly ahead. It’s never spelled out directly but it seems obvious that Mills hasn’t said a word since he shot Somerset and there is an excellent chance his mind has snapped. The way the captain says: ‘We’ll take care of him” clearly means more than making sure that his career or even prison is the least of their concerns for Mills.\n\nThe ending of Se7en has been hotly debated ever since it came out. At the time of its release Ebert withheld giving it a four-star review because he thought the perfect ending would have been to make one detective kill the other. An original draft had Somerset killing Doe so Mills wouldn’t have too. The original ending had the screen going to black after Mills shot the killer. The final scene was shot with Somerset just saying: “I’ll be around” and the voiceover was added by the studio because they just thought it was too bleak.\n\nAt the end of the day I think the voiceover was needed because Se7en is fundamentally a horror film and not a mystery. When you’ve gone through all the horrors that we’ve seen in this movie, when the monster has finally surrendered but you learn that the killer has one last trick up his sleeve, when the killer manages to complete his masterpiece in full view of the heroes, the viewer needs something to hang on to, some form of light. The implication in both the last line and the voiceover is that Somerset has regained his determination to keep fighting, even against a world as evil as the one we’ve just lived through. It’s not much, but in the darkness in the final shot, it’s the one sliver of light we can hold on to.\n\nIn recent decades, some of the best horror films have been willing to commit to the bleakness of the vision most famously in movies like Hereditary and Us. I can see their virtues but we also need films like Se7en which tells us that no matter how much carnage they have witnessed, someone will keep fighting against it. The bad guys won in this film, but the one good guy left standing will keep trying."
