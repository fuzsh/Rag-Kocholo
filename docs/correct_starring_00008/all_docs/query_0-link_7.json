        "meta_description": "Purchase Seven on digital and stream instantly or download offline. \"Nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work. I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.\" Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride, lust, everyone has a sin. For detectives William Somerset and David Mills they live among these sins, everyday, a crumbling city of crime all around them. But nothing can prepare the partners for the killings they are about to experience, all of which begins when they find a morbidly obese man who has died from the forced ingestion of spaghetti. What starts as one bizarre crime turns into a case of serial murders as a predator named John Doe begins to execute victims by paying homage to the \"deadly sin\" they represent. Directed by David Fincher and starring Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kevin Spacey, Seven is hailed by critics as, \"An intensely claustrophobic, gut-wrenching thriller.\"",

        "text": "When Seven, with its velvety world of bottomless evil, taps you on the shoulder, your instinct will be to dive under the theater seat.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to call David Fincher's Seven the most terrifying film ever, but it's right up there on the top shelf with Psycho and The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nSeven doesn't take you to hell and back; it takes you to hell and keeps you there, looking around and wondering how it had come to this.\n\nApril 4, 2024\n\nThere is no denying that Seven is a deeply unpleasant movie. But I believe it is a fine one, too. It doesn't glory in its depravity, but keeps a distance from it.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nAll the literary allusions and cinema school self-consciousness can't save Fincher from drowning in the tawdry waste of this dreadful, brutal, abusive movie. Go, our little moviemaker, and sin no more.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe performance that eventually emerges from the shadows gives both Anthony Hopkins and Anthony Perkins a run for their money. By the end of the film you'll run to your car and lock the doors.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThere's a great deal of talent on display in the serial-killer thriller Seven, which only makes it worse when you finally recognize this is a heartless, soulless, pointless exercise in audience manipulation.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThe results of the killings are needlessly grotesque and don't really serve the smart screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker and the artful direction of David Fincher. All of this talent is worth seeing if you can look past the gruesome details.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nSeven, a dark, grisly, horrifying and intelligent thriller, may be too disturbing for many people, I imagine, although if you can bear to watch it, you will see filmmaking of a high order.\n\nMarch 30, 2024\n\nA spectacular piece of cinema -- a vision of evil triumphant, distilled into deadly psychic poison by a world that is itself corrupt and fallen. After Alien 3, Fincher shows himself a real artist of the medium.\n\nMarch 29, 2024"
