        "text": "2023 single by Jungkook featuring Latto\n\n\"Seven\" is a song by South Korean singer Jungkook of BTS featuring American rapper Latto, released as a single on July 14, 2023, through Big Hit Music. It was produced by Andrew Watt and Cirkut who co-wrote it with Jon Bellion, Latto, and Theron Makiel Thomas. The song is a romantic UK garage pop track about wanting to spend all of one's time with one's lover. An explicit version was also released, and later included on Jungkook's debut studio album Golden.[1]\n\nThe single entered music charts in over fifty territories and topped rankings in India, Latvia, Malaysia, and Singapore. It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States and the Global 200, becoming both Jungkook and Latto's first number-one. It also topped Billboard's Hits of the World charts in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, South Korean, Philippines, and Taiwan.\n\n\"Seven\" debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart and set a new record as the highest debuting single by a solo Korean act in history. Elsewhere, it charted in the top ten in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Lithuania, Peru, Paraguay, New Zealand, South Korea, and Switzerland. It also broke the record for the fastest song in history to surpass one billion streams on Spotify, and eventually became the most-streamed collaboration of 2023 on the platform.[2][3]\n\nBackground and release\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon hearing “Seven,” I thought, “This is it.” After that, I focused on practicing and recording the track multiple times to perfect it. I hope that many people can feel as I felt when I first heard the song.\n\n— Jung Kook talks about 'Seven', Variety[4]\n\nOn June 29, 2023, Big Hit Music announced via Weverse that Jungkook's single \"Seven\" would be released on July 14, 2023.[5] Prior to the digital single's release, \"Still with You\" and \"My You\" were made available on streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music on July 3, 2023. Both songs were previously only available on SoundCloud or YouTube.[6] On July 7, concept photos and a short film were released. This was followed by the official music video teaser on July 13.[7]\n\nA progressive house dance remix by Swedish DJ Alesso was released on August 25, 2023,[8] while a second remix, by French DJ David Guetta, was released at the end of October.[9]\n\nLyrics and composition\n\n[edit]\n\nDescribed as an \"invigorating summer song\", \"Seven\" was produced by Andrew Watt and Cirkut, both of whom co-wrote it with Jon Bellion, Latto, and Theron Makiel Thomas. The song is in 4\n\n4 common time in the key of B major with a tempo of 126 beats per minute and a vocal range that spans from F♯4 to D♯6.[10] Musically, it is a pop[11] song of the UK garage genre with acoustic guitar sounds and a catchy melody. Lyrically, \"Seven\" is a romantic serenade about wanting to spend every moment of every day with one's lover. The explicit version's lyrics express a more sexual desire.[12][13]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nWriting for NME, Rhian Daly gave \"Seven\" a four star rating out of five, praising Jungkook's \"polished mid-register and honeyed falsetto\" and opining that the song \"set the bar high for his solo era\".[12]\n\nYear-end lists for \"Seven\" Publication List Rank Ref.

It earned a further 97 million streams and 12,000 sales worldwide, and 88.2 million streams and 8,000 sales outside of the US, for the period dated August 25–31.[34] It spent an eighth consecutive week atop the Excl.

Chronicling an entire week (in reference to the song's lyrics), the video depicts Jungkook comedically attempting to win back Han's affection, often to her annoyance.\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe video opens with Jungkook and Han arguing at a restaurant on Monday, during which an earthquake causes a chandelier to crash down from the ceiling onto a table and the walls to explode.[66] On Tuesday, he serenades her while hanging off the window of a train she is on then walks atop the train, following her as she switches cars.[67] On Wednesday, Jungkook tries to capture Han's attention at a flooding laundromat, to which she responds angrily. On Thursday, he is hit by a car while attempting to give her flowers. On Friday, Jungkook follows her during a rainstorm, which culminates with him being blown away by the wind. Latto appears during Jungkook's funeral on Saturday and performs her verse atop his coffin at one point before he suddenly resurrects and greets Han. On Sunday, Jungkook sings to her while on a suspended platform. At the end of the video, which returns to the rainstorm on Friday, Han eventually reaches for Jungkook's hand and the two walk away together in the rain.[67][68][69]\n\nLive performances\n\n[edit]\n\nJungkook performed \"Seven\" live for the first time on the day of its release, along with \"Euphoria\" and \"Dynamite\", in Central Park as part of Good Morning America's Summer Concert series.[70] He appeared on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge segment on July 20 and performed the song in studio together with a cover of \"Let There Be Love\" by Oasis.[71] The follow day, he performed the single on The One Show, on an outdoor stage next to the Thames River in London.[72] Jungkook co-headlined the 2023 Global Citizen Festival on September 23 in New York City and performed \"Seven\" as part of his setlist, with Latto joining him onstage for the first time.[73]\n\nHis only domestic performance of the song was on the July 30, 2023, episode of Inkigayo.[74]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications for \"Seven\"\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease dates and formats for \"Seven\" Region Date Format(s) Version Label Ref.
