        "text": "<BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by agents_4_peace:<BR> Quote: \"Originally posted by JerkyChew:<BR> Funny you ask about the SE DVD. It has the original planned ending - In the original storyboards, Morgan Freeman's character (Who looked an AWFUL lot like Tommy Lee Jones in the boards View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_wink.gif ) ends up killing Doe. Brad pitt asks him, \"What the hell are you doing?\", to which he replies, \"I'm retiring.\"\"<P>Ahhh, excellent! That's quite more fitting, IMO. I was gonna buy the damn thing anyway, but now I'll just have to buy it sooner.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>What are you, INSANE?? View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif<P>Somerset in the original ending creates a happy ending, which is totally, completely out of context with the rest of the film. Throughout the whole of Seven, you are getting the message that the world sucks, that people are evil, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Sticking this fairy tale ending onto this type of movie would have been a travesty. Pitt recognized this in Mills' character, ie. Mills' only choice is to shoot John Doe, and Somerset's only choice is to stand helplessly by. Hence, Pitt argued successfully for the new ending, the one which makes sense. I'm sorry, but having Somerset defeat John Doe like that, and then throwing that moronic dry-wit action-hero type line out there to end the movie, would have destroyed a brilliant movie. Having John Doe lose in any way would have destroyed the movie. <P>Even that last bit with Mills being taken away in the cop car is a little silly, but I understand the need for the audience to have <I>some</I> hope to cling to. Somerset's line \"I'll see you on Monday\", provides that hope, and his monologue provides some sort of closure for the audience, but I really would have preferred that part not be there. This is a movie that sets out right from the start to make you as uncomfortable as you possibly can be, and succeeds so well in overturning all your expectations in a cop action movie, that many people just can't handle it. It has set a new standard for its genre, and having Somerset shoot Doe would have reduced all of that to a pile of standard action movie rubble.<P><BLOCKQUOTE><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR> I would have got up and yelled at the screenwriter. The guy already threatened his wife and he left her at home unattended? Farking moron. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Actually, Doe never threatened Mills' wife. The only time Doe ever spoke to Mills is during the altercation in the hallway after the Sloth murder, where Mills shows his temperment and chases Doe away. Doe never speaks during the chase when Mills and Somerset find Doe's apartment, and in fact, that is the point where Doe figures out how to end his string of murders. The next time we see Doe, he is surrendering in the police station, his hands and clothes bathed in blood, which we assume is the blood of his latest found victim, Pride, but which is in fact the blood of Mills' wife.<P>Edit: Oh yeah, I would have shot him a few times in the legs first, then kicked him a lot, then uhhhh... cut his heart out with a spoon. Yeah, that's the ticket View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif<P>[This message was edited by KaiS on February 10, 2002 at 14:16.]<P>[This message was edited by KaiS on February 10, 2002 at 14:16.]<P>[This message was edited by KaiS on February 10, 2002 at 14:36.]\n\nI'm with Semi. You can, in fact, yank a heart out and show to someone before they die, if you're efficient. Just remember, the heart is actually more to the center, not under the boob as most seem to place it.<P>And for Pete's sake, don't go through the sternum to get it out, it's all about a vertical KaBar incision just under the front of the rib cage. Then, you'll want to run both hands north till you feel the pumpy, moving thing. (It'll be going really fast by now.) A simple perimeter slash or two, and then yank it out. For added effect, go ahead and take a bite out of it and then spit it in his face. View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif<P>(Note: The forgoing should be interpreted as black humor. IRL, I'd use a vertical kidney slash, and sever the renal artery. It's extremely painful, and even if you do it to someone in a hospital with a trauma surgeon standing right there, they still can't save him. View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif )\n\nI think that all the replies to this thread underscore the message of Seven, that morality is out the window in this day and age View image: /infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif<P>I mean really, killing the guy is not moral or ethical, but it would be considered right, or at least justifiable, in a court of law and indeed in many people's minds. Doe represents this paradox in his own character, as he is working to save the people he kills, to save society in his own way, by opening the eyes of all of us who are blind and apathetic to the deadly sins going on around us. \"We see a deadly sin, every day, on every street corner, and we do nothing.\" By instilling all of us with the desire to kill him, with the desire for Wrath, he turns the audience into the ultimate example of his message to the world.<P>A lot of us would disagree vehemently with his view of the world, and his solution to its problems, but some of his points we have no choice but to agree with, which increases our hatred of him ever more.<P>\"Only in a world this shitty, can we think of such people as 'innocent'.\"<P>In the end, all of us are guilty."
