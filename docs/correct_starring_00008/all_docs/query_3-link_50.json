        "text": "Another breaking down structure today with a top ten all time favorite, Se7en, directed by David Fincher, a dark, visceral masterpiece that blew everyone away in 1995. Only his second film, after the much maligned debut Alien 3 (which I actually liked), Fincher proved he was a force to be reckoned with, and has gone on to have an envietable career as a Hollywood director. He’s definitely one of my favorite directors period….but enough blabbering! I could go on forever about this film, but let’s get this structure plane flying! Film: Se7en Director: David Fincher Year: 1995 Length: 2:06:50 min.\n\nACT ONE\n\n1. The Introduction\n\nWe open on Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) getting ready for the day in a robotic fashion. He investigates a murder scene, character moment: “Did the kid see it?” His coworker: “We’re all gonna be real glad when you retire.” Character and story reveal with Somerset’s dark question and learning he’s retiring soon. Young Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) arrives on the scene and immediately butts heads with Somerset. Their differences are clear.\n\nIt could be argued that this is a dual protagonist story, but this is definitely Mills’s journey, and Somerset is along for the ride. Another crime scene; the first of the deadly sin murders. Two character moments when Mills pesters the beat cop about making sure the victim is dead. Somerset: “What exactly was the point of that conversation lyou were about to get into?” Mills still has that idealistic attitude that Somerset once had, but now can’t stand. They find a morbidly obese man, dead, face down in a plate of spaghetti. Mills: “Who said this was murder?” Somerset: “No one.” A fleeting moment of agreement between the two, foreshadowing their eventual friendship. Time: 10:00 min\n\n2. The Incident\n\nOh it’s definitely a murder. Tired of his incessant yapping, Somerset asks Mills to go help question the neighbors like he’s some rookie cop. Mills: “You’ve seen my file right?” Somerset: “Nope.” He doesn’t even care enough anymore to read his new partners file. Somerset wants to be reassigned and thinks it’s “too soon” for Mills to take on such a case. They butt heads again. Somerset isn’t reassigned, but Mills is. Time: 17:07 min.\n\n3. The Exposition\n\nMills investigates the murder of a lawyer, but his inexperience is clear to everyone, even himself. Somerset learns that “Greed” was scralled at the scene, becomes more intrigued in the case and revisits the first crime scene. He uncovers “gluttony” written in grease behind the fridge. Scene of Somerset explaining (‘splainin) about the seven deadly sins and its connection to the recent murders. “This case is just beginning” and Somerset wants no part in it, but Mills is “all over it.” Two character moments back-to-back. That’s good writing. Time: 24:27 min.\n\n4. The Obstacles\n\nSomerset gets restless and decides to study the deadly sins at the library. He’s starting to feel that old excitement again. Mills reads Cliff Note versions of Dantes Inferno, too proud to ask for any help. But they’re both investigating the crime in their own way, which soon brings them together. Time: 30:27 min.\n\nACT TWO\n\n5. The New World\n\nMills and Somerset are literally forced together in the latters former, cramped, office. Mills wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset to their house for supper, much to Mills’s dismay. They’re forced together again. But their bond starts over supper when Somerset finds their “vibrating home” very hilarious. After supper, Somerset helps Mills research the case, impressed that he’s not just some “quarterback punk” by referencing material from Dante. Somerset claims he’s only helping to “satisfy his curiosity.” 41:00 min.\n\n6. The Journey Begins\n\nThey question the dead lawyers wife, uncovering another clue behind an upside down painting. CSI uncovers “Help Me” written behind the painting. The prints lead them to “Victor” who could be their guy, but Somerset isn’t convinced. At Victor’s apartment it’s like a horror scene, SWAT bust in to find him chained to a bed, looking like a corpse. In a truly horrifying moment, Victor comes alive, but he’s a vegetable Time: 54:25 min.\n\n7. The Plan\n\nMills wife, Tracey, calls Somerset for “someone to talk to.” Over breakfast she tells him she’s pregnant but David (Mills) doesn’t know. Somerset tells her how he wore down his ex to have an abortion, but still wonders every day if he’d made the right choice, big character moment. Mills is sick of waiting for the “lunatic to do it again.” Somerset: “It’s dismissive to call him a lunatic.” Still polar opposites. 1:04:20 min.\n\n8. The Midpoint\n\nAlso sick of waiting, and of the bureaucracy of his job, Somerset decides to “break bad” and pays off “stinky man” at a greasy pizza joint. Somerset reveals to an irritated Mills that the FBI flag certain library books and have the names of who took them out. Mills: “How is this legal?” It’s not, just something from an old-timer like Somersets bag of tricks. Stinky Man’s list of names leads them to the apartment of “John Doe”, who shows up just in time to start shooting at them. Cue Blade Runner-ish chase through the rainy, New York streets, where Mills is almost executed by John Doe, before showing mercy. Time: 01:14:44 min.\n\n9. The New Plan\n\nMills is beat up bad and pissed. Somerset tries to talk him out of breaking into Doe’s apartment because they found it illegally. But Mills kicks the door down anyways. Somerset shows anger for the first time; Mills is impulsive, but he’s stirred that old fire inside him. Doe’s apartment is turned upside down, Mills is getting better at leading. Somerset reads from one of Doe’s journals: “What sick ridiculous puppets we are.” The phone rings, it’s Doe. Mills is his usual hothead self. Doe “doesn’t want to ruin the surprise.” Time: 01:24:07 min.\n\n10. The Downpoint\n\nAnother murder. “Lust.” Doe forced some poor sap to bang a prostitute using a bladed strap-on. Mills and Somerset have some beers and argue over their different philosophies. “Agree to disagree” has become the theme of their relationship. A dead model is found with her nose cut off; “Pride.” More victims and they’re barely anywhere, getting hopeless. Somerset decides to stay until the case is closed, but is it that or the new companionship that’s keeping him around? Then John Doe inexplicably arrives, bloodied, at the police station, giving himself up. But he hasn’t “completed his masterpiece,” and both detectives agree (for once) that it isn’t over, Doe wouldn’t just give himself up. Time: 01:34:00.\n\nACT THREE\n\n11. The Showdown\n\nDoe’s asked to have Mills and Somerset drive them to an undisclosed location. A last moment of levity between the two. On the drive with Doe, Mills and Somerset are still diametrically opposed, but they work as a team, a partnership, with how they each talk to Doe. They both antagonize him in their own, good cop/bad cop way. Doe leads them to a secret location where a mysterious box is delivered. Time: 01:56:57\n\n12. The Outroduction\n\nSomerset opens the box: “John Doe has the upper hand!” Cue iconic “Whats in the box?”scene that still makes the heart race. Doe’s sin is Envy and wants Mills to kill him to “become Wrath” thus completing the murders. Mills can’t let it go, and kills Doe. His life is effectively over. Somerset is ambiguous about whether he’s going to retire. “I’ll be around,” a line that speaks volumes, while also completing his arc. Mills doesn’t really change even though he’s the protagonist. He kills Doe due to his impulsiveness. In this case Somerset is the one who changes through Mills’s journey. End.\n\nAnd that’s the story breakdown as I see it folks. Let me know what you think below.\n\nKeep writing,\n\n– Tim\n\n@timaucoinscreenwriter"
