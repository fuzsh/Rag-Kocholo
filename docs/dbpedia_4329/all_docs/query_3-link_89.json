        "text": "Farm was a large stone wall that Slew refused to approach. It took some rough handling, but in time Turner was able to ride Slew up to and along the wall. “You pick out something they don't want to do,” says Turner, “and you just make them do it. When you finally get to the race track later on, you'll have much more control. You'd rather have them hate the farm or hate the barn — discipline them there — but love the racetrack. Racing or training, that's the one place you don't want problems.” Handling classy young horses is, according to Turner, “just like raising smart kids. Without discipline, they're not worth five dead flies. But it's got to be done right — channel their spirit but don't break it—and it's got to be done early, or it's just too late.” More than once, when he was too frisky for his own — or Turner's—good, Slew felt the sting of a shank end across his nose. But by early spring he'd got the\n\nThe horse's first real workout, at Belmont Park in March 1976, confirmed what Turner had been hoping: “He was a runner, a runner for sure, but he was still a little awkward. Sometimes, with a really good 2‐year‐old, I'll drag my feet. I'll try to look down the road and see his ultimate. And if there's something there that says, ‘Not yet,’ then it's not yet. I won't hurry them. And I didn't hurry Slew.”\n\nThrough the spring and summer mornings, first at Belmont and then at Saratoga, Turner gave Seattle Slew what he needed most time. At 6 A.M., Turner would slip into Slew's stall “to check his legs for anything that might have happened overnight — a glance tells you if the animal's normal.” Quickly, on went the tack and up went exercise rider Mike Kennedy. “Slew's biggest problem was learning to relax,” Turner says. “He's just a hell of a lot of horse who always wants to run. So every morning we'd take our time getting him to the track —walk him through the barn area, talk to passers‐by, show him the paddock.” On the track, aboard stable pony Steamboat, Turner channeled Slew to the outside rail, staying slightly ahead of him, turning in his saddle to watch Slew's eyes, note his action, look for signs of nervous sweat. Once in a while, Turner would let Kennedy “breeze” the horse — let him go a quarter‐mile or more at racing pace. But usually it was just “walking, maybe galloping a little, letting him watch horses breaking from the starting gate, but just taking it easy, just fussing.” Turner varied his routes to and from the track because Slew became too playful when he recognized a set pattern. “We worked on keeping him confused. Any teacher knows you've got to do that with a star pupil.”\n\nTurner also worked on developing a rapport with Slew, as he does with all the horses in his public — i.e., shared by several owners —stable. “The idea is for them to see me as an equal.” So Turner allows his horses “to go after me now and then.” It's an odd thing to watch. Some mornings, Turner will walk slowly down a row of fillies’ stalls in his barn. They jump at the webbing, knowing what's coming. “One'll nip me on the shoulder, the next one gets me in the back, and the one after that's just dying for her shot. They take their frustrations out on my jackets and sweaters. All they want is a bite out of the boss, just one good bite. Good for their courage and confidence. Makes ‘em feel great.” So, along with the customary short‐hold workouts and the occasional breeze, Slew got in a nip or two of his own. What emerged were a disciplined horse, a hard‐bitten trainer and a mutual respect.\n\nOnly when both man and horse were good and ready did Turner finally take Seattle Slew to the races— at Belmont in September of last year. It was like switching on a giant strobe light: The teak‐dark son of Bold Reasoning was a dazzler. After two quick wins, he came up to mid‐October's prestigious Champagne Stakes for 2‐year‐olds and devastated nine of the best of his peers, covering the mile in a stakes‐record 1:34.2. Veteran horseman E. Barry Ryan observes, “After two races Turner figured he had something, but after the Champagne he knew it. The real signal is when you send a young horse against good ones and he wins from here to the ‘21’ Club.” Slew was clearly a horse to be reckoned by and reckoned with.\n\nBut Turner decided to give Slew the rest of the year off, even though shelving him just then jeopardized his chances of being named Two‐Year‐Old of the Year (which he was later designated anyway). The trainer's rationale was characteristic: “The heck with titles. He was such a generous horse — all he wanted to do was run—but he was ready to tear around the world twice, wound up so tight we'd have risked injuring him if we raced him again too soon. So we called it a season. Horses are so fragile all you can do is try to hold them together. If you can get them to the gate sound, and they can run, they will.”\n\nThrough the winter of ‘76, old racing hands and instant savants caviled that the horse had been too lightly trained, too sparingly raced. But Turner knew what he was doing. “After the Champagne, we knew the horse was exceptional, but it was all speed he was a speed‐burning sprinter. I wanted to train him away from that ‐ something he'd always have anyway—and get him in line for the longer Triple Crown races. That's why the relaxing, that's why the long gallops and so few stiff works.\n\n“Look: The book says there's no way you can bring a horse to the Derby without a lot of breezes. But you've got to let instinct, intuition, have their say; if they're good, they're better than the book. There aren't any tools in this trade, really, no sure‐thing tricks. If you're honest, you'll admit you don't really know what you're doing until you're right on top of it and have to jump one way or the other. Training is some knowledge, a lot of experience and a backyardful of intuition. It's the difference between science and art.”\n\nTurner's art is almost an obsession. According to Mickey Taylor, “On the track he's in a trance‐that's the only way to put It. Anybody in his barn is lucky. ‘Course, in other ways he's a little disorganized. Last year he was overjoyed when only 81 of his checks bounced.”\n\nThe critics (and Turner's creditors) might have been silenced by Slew's first two outings as a 3‐year‐old. On March 9, 1977, unraced for nearly five months, the colt ran a record 1:20.3 for seven furlongs at Miami's Hialeah Park (and, according to New York Times columnist Red Smith, “broke every stopwatch in Florida'). Seventeen days later, Slew blazed through the mile‐andan‐eighth Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah In 1:47.2, just threefifths of a second off the stakes record. Those two races were an impressive start on the road to the Kentucky Derby, making Turner's training look a bit less suspect and reconfirming Slew as the early Derby favorite. “The Flamingo was so easy,” Turner recalls, “that Slew cooled out in 10 minutes. We walked him twice around the barn, he took two swallows of water, and that was that.”\n\nNot quite. ABC had televised the race, and Eddie Arcaro, Hall‐of‐Fame jockey and the network's expert commentator, had told America that rider Jean Cruguet had almost botched the ride‐letting Slew go too fast in opening up a backstretch lead of 12 lengths before gathering him to coast home by four. The implication was that Cruguet was a bad tactician and/or had been unable to handle the colt. Turner was shocked by a videotape of the ABC show and, privately, furious. “Cruguet did exactly what I'd told him to do: ‘At the fiveeighths pole [five‐eighths of a mile from the finish], stand them on their heads right there for a quarter‐mile or so.’ It was a disgrace, an exercise in idiocy, knocking the rider that way.” And now the press was pressing Turner for comparisons of Slew with Secretariat, the Big Red Machine that had swept the Triple Crown in 1973. Turner did his best to ignore such distractions, Arcaro's comments included, and took his horse north to New York on schedule.\n\nThe Wood Memorial at Aqueduct in late April was Slew's last pre‐Derby race. It was among the first races of the season run over Aqueduct's main track, which had lain dormant over the long winter. The strip came up dead and “cuppy”—no spring to it, the top‐cushion of dirt slightly loose. Slew ran a creditable 1:49.3 for the nine furlongs, good enough for his sixth win in six lifetime starts, but the gainsayers, now spitting into a stiffening wind, were still out in force. Slew was overrated, the party line ran. Or the other 3‐year‐olds were substandard. Or Slew hadn't truly been tested, hadn't been “asked the question” by another tough horse. Such is the pressure on the hot horse in any Triple Crown campaign, and Turner was smart enough to know it. He kept his own counsel and headed for Louisville and his first Derby.\n\n“When you ship to Kentucky and you've got the favorite,” says Turner, “you don't trust anybody, starting with everybody. You're dealing with horsemen who're after the same thing you are, and you've got to watch your backside. We brought our own security [six people and a grouchy Doberman] because we knew we were strictly on our own.” Securely encamped, Turner made it a point to “find the old‐timers, just to sit around and talk and listen to the stories.”\n\nThe tales Turner heard—of post‐Derby wine specimens tossed out instead of tested out, of Derby winners running on dope or with fewer than the mandated 126 pounds—are the hardy gossip of generations. “Maybe 80 percent of them are just stories,” figures Turner, “but then there's the rest. Like it's a fact that Ben Jones [trainer of five Derby winners for Kentucky's Calumet Farm) always got the racing surface to suit the horse he was running. They'd water it or dig it up or roll it, whatever he needed. With 3‐year‐olds going a mile‐and a quarter for the first time, that's a hell of an edge. And Jones always had that edge. That's just a known fact in Kentucky.” For a man about to saddle his first Derby horse, such stuff can turn the Run for the Roses into the run for neurosis.\n\nAnd, as always, there was criticism of Turner's training. Two mornings before the race, he took Slew onto the track for what had been trumpeted as a final, pre‐Derby “blowout.” Instead, with exercise rider Mike Kennedy aboard Slew, Turner simply walked the country's hottest horse. Now the colt edged up to the starting gate, now he ambled along the backstretch. That was it. Jammed at the rail were reporters, Racing Form clockers, horsemen, celebrities; at literally every turn were still and TV cameramen. The consensus: Turner's nuts. But veteran trainer Woody Stephens, for one, saw it differently. “The horse won't be short [under‐conditioned),” he said. “Turner's a jumpinghorse man, and they don't send out short horses.”\n\nBut Turner did send out a nervous one. Every Derby colt has to run a circuslike prerace gantlet of pressing, clamorous crowds, blaring bands, darting photographers and a small, hot paddock. Slew took it wretchedly. He was already breaking out in sweat as the saddle went on him. At his side, Turner wore a look of nearly nauseated concern. It's just as well he didn't have a portable TV set with him.\n\nFor as part of ABC's preruce show, Toward Casell and Eddie Arcaro narrated a splitscreen “comparison” of Seattle Slew and Secretariat. The basis was Secretariat's final strides in the 1972 Champagne Stakes and Slew's in his recent Wood Memorial. On‐screen, Secretariat's nose touched his finish line first ; on cue, Arcaro picked up the beat: “… Here at the finish of the race, Slew may be getting a little tired. He is losing his action, shortening his stride…. ” Later, again in private, Turner would blow his stack: “The single phoniest thing I've ever seen on television.”\n\nSecretariat's Champagne was run on a fast track at one mile; Seattle Slew's Wood was over a dead track at a mile and one‐eighth. Had both horses’ Champagnes been shown, “we'd have blown him away,” says Turner, since Slew's time was three‐fifths of a second faster (rule of thumb: onefifth of a second equals a length of ground). “But, no, they didn't have a slow race of Slew at Belmont, so they took his Wood from an Aqueduct track that was like running through a plowed field. Different distances, tracks, racing surfaces—a cheap, phoniedup attempt to show Secretariat as a better horse than Slew.” ABC might have taken Secretariat's Wood (the only other pre‐Derby race both horses had run), but Secretariat finished third in that race.\n\nElsewhere in the prerace show, ABC's Jim McKay ruminated: “Is Seattle Slew another Secretariat? It's almost heresy around the race track to speak of any other horse in the same breath…. ” Reviewing his tape of the program, Turner stiffens: “There it is ‘heresy.’ If they're trying to keep Secretariat's balloon pumped up, it's a bad way to do it. I mean, if you don't have the product, you just don't say anything. And they knew they didn't have the product.”\n\nTalk of “the product” and of “keeping Secretariat's balloon pumped up” crackles with overtones in 1977, the fourth year after the son of Bold Ruler was retired to stud by a 32‐share, $6.08 million syndicate. Secretariat's first 2‐yearolds got to the races in 1977, and they have not been prepossessing; in the argot, the sire may not have “stamped his get.” Turner patiently explains breeder thinking: “They want to get their money out in the first three years [either by selling the stud's services or by mating him to their own mares and capitalizing on the offspring]. Then they're O.K. even if he's a bust as a sire. If the kids are good, of course, they're really set. It's a gamble, a business speculation in blood and luck.'’ (Continued on Page 64)\n\nWhat may have made 1971 even dodgier for Secretariat. boosters is that up popped a horse owned by people with ix ties to Kentucky (the capital 01 the multibillion‐dollar breed. ing industry), a horse rolling up the racing credentials and acquiring the glossy mystique demanded of a potential foundation sire—up popped, in short, a Seattle Slew. “If 1 owned a chunk of Secretariat and this other horse came along? Sure, I'd be edgy,” Turner says. “Who wouldn't be? You hate to see a shadow of any kind come over a horse that you love or that you've got $190,000 tied up in.” An insider on all of ABC's 1977 thoroughbred telecasts allows, with tiptoed cautiousness, that “if Seattle Slew had had Kentucky connections, he might have come in for more favorable comment.” Says Turner: “There's just no question that Slew suffered from threatening to win the Triple Crown so soon after Secretariat.”\n\nAnd on the Churchill Downs track, Slew certainly suffered at the outset of his first Triple Crown race: When the bell rang for the Kentucky Derby, the overwhelming favorite got off to one of the worst starts in the event's 103 runnings. The colt's head whanged against the right side of his stall door and, as it recoiled, carried his whole body into the leftwardskewing exit from the gate. The mishap nearly unseated Jean Cruguet, and drew gasps across the land. Turner replays the close‐up, slow‐motion tape of the start. “Now watch. There: See how the assistant starter [the handler in the gate] has hold of him? He's got hold of his bridle. So when the gate opened, the horse yanked against that hold. That's why he whacked his head, and that's why his mouth was bleeding slightly after the race.”\n\nTurner's videotape runs freely, but his horse does not. He is behind a fast‐closing wall of colts that got off without incident. “We're in a box. Get rid of us here and anybody's got a shot. It's a bust‐out race. The riders who know the game, the old boys, they know you just get the hot horse in a bad switch early, and he'll be nowhere in the Derby. Time he gets finished beating his way through the pack, he won't have anything left for a winning move. No Derby horse ever has.”\n\nBut Seattle Slew did. All but on his own, he bulled through early and then, grinding down For The Moment, held off Run Dusty Run and Sanhedrin for a length‐and‐three‐quarters win. Times do not always tell. Secretariat, for instance, ran a 59.2 Derby, nearly three seconds faster than Slew's. But Secretariat had a trouble‐free trip over a substantially harder and faster track; he did not have to be “used” so early in order to gain position. Turner spoke a brief mouthful into ABC's post‐Derby microphones: “He overcame adversity. That's the sign of a race horse.” But Eddie Arcaro would see it radically otherwise: The colt was merely “the best of an ordinary lot.”\n\nTurner's long view of the Derby: “We won the thing, and it's the hardest race in the world for the favorite to win. Hey, it's the Derby and you've got to be set for it. We had some, ah, difficulties and we got past them. I did a lot of homework just to get to Kentucky and out of there again in one piece. Next time, I'll just do a little more.”\n\nComing up to the Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown at Baltimore's Pimlico Race Track on May 21, Slew had beaten a total of 66 horses in seven races. Only two Derby starters chose to take him on again, and they and six others were demolished. Seattle Slew ran the fastest first mile in Preakness history 1:34.4—and coasted home the last three‐sixteenths of a mile for a final time of 1:54.2, only two ticks off Canonero II's 1971 stakes record. Again he'd been asked the question. Again he'd had the answer.\n\nAnd ABC's Howard Cosell had an off‐camera question for Slew's trainer. Eddie Arca ro's comments at the Flamingo, Wood and Derby had finally drawn critical fire from the racing press. Now, waiting for the post‐Preakness interviews, Cosell buttonholed Turner. “He asked me,” Turner recounts, “ ‘How come they're trying to bury Eddie? All we're doing is creating a little controversy. We've got to hype these races ‐you've got such a heavy favorite we might lose people's interest.’ I told him that if he'd said what Arcaro had, he'd have been ignored because he didn't know a thing about racing. But Arcaro did, so there was no excuse. I said, ‘Knock me, knock the owners if you want to stir It up a little, but don't knock the horse. People can see the horse, can see what he's done. So they can see what a bunch of dummies you are for slamming him.’ “\n\nTurner says that Cosell did more than merely admit to selling It like it wasn't. “He asked me, ‘Is there anything you can do to help Eddie?’ I told him I'd go up to the news conference and take him off the hook.”\n\nCosell professes outrage on all points: “Totally false. In my lifetime I have never told anybody that we need controversy in the races, that we have to hype the races, or anything else. And I never asked him to help Eddie. Eddie Arcaro didn't need help from Billy Turner, good Lord.”\n\nWithal, minutes after their conversation, Turner was telling the press, “Eddie Arcaro rode many great horses in his time. He's just looking at this horse and saying greatness can't be proven off a few races.” Turner says he said it’ because “when I was a jumpjock, I idolized Eddie Arcaro.” It's also because Turner has a generous sense of dignity. Even more to the point, Turner, unlike many in the backstretch, is neither chronically annoyed nor paranoid. At 37, he looks about what you'd hope Henry Aldrich would look like 20 years later. His angular face is friendly, open, curious. The body is spare and lanky, and when he speaks he leans forward slightly as tall men will. His greeting to just about everybody is a palms‐up “Good t’ see you. How are you, anyhow?” Turner is loose and intelligently outgoing; as horsemen would put it, he has a nice way of going.\n\nThe interval between the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, the final Triple Crown race, should have made Turner's outlook all the more sanguine. On June II, his colt would be shooting for his fifth $100,000‐plus stakes‐race win in less than three months. The horse was fit. Turner had been getting on well with Slew's owners despite the increasingly stressful glare of the Triple Crown spotlight. So Turner and Slew returned to Belmont Park, where it had all started nine months earlier. But as a home base, Belmont had been and would remain a mixed blessing.\n\nIt wasn't so much that when he'd come north for the Wood, Turner had found his barn unready for occupancy—a crumbling office ceiling, inadequate lighting, no phone and a clogged drainpipe had forced him into temporary quarters. Turner himself was the first to point out it had been a tough winter. True, “other people's barns were ready, but I was eyes‐front, just trying to train my horses. I decided not to sweat the nickel‐and‐dime stuff. Besides, I was, and am, a rank apprentice next to a lot of other trainers.”\n\nNo, what galled him now was “going home at night and watching TV ads hyping the Belmont—with clips of Secretariat. You know: ‘Come on out to dear old Belmont and you may see another Secretariat.’ I know this sounds corny, but Slew was the people's horse. Coast to coast, people loved him. Christ, here was the world's biggest drawing card and they didn't play it. They just didn't give a damn.”\n\nTed Demmon, the New York Racing Association's vice president for marketing, said recently that “a special preBelmont TV spot featuring Seattle Slew—and this was a group decision—just wasn't necessary. It would have cost, oh, $10,000 to produce [the N.Y.R.A.'s yearly advertising budget is $4.5 million], and there'd have been trouble with lead times and scheduling. We had print ads and radio spots on Slew. Besides, everybody knew about the horse anyway.” The extraordinary circumstances of Seattle Slew did not, in short, merit an ordinary TV ad for his biggest race.\n\nSome 30 years ago, an astute racing journalist named Joe Palmer wrote, “It is diffidently moved in this corner that Belmont Park recognize the 20th century.” Palmer was nettled that the Belmont Stakes was habitually treated as just another feature race among many in the season. He wanted the decisive Triple Crown race proudly self‐proclaimed. And if there was a star, say so. “I want a band,” he wrote with only slight hyperbole, “that can spell out ‘Native Dancer’ on the steeplechase course and I want a guy dressed like an apostrophe in case it has to spell out ‘Man o’ War.’ “\n\nIn 1977, the N.Y.R.A., blinking at the glare, began to recognize the 20th century, using gimmicks and giveaways to reattract Off Track bettors and to blunt the impact of flat racing at New Jersey's Meadowlands. But Seattle Slew did not figure in any N.Y.R.A. promotions, although free T‐shirt iron‐ons celebrated the three‐time Horse of the Year, Forego.\n\n“Well, naturally they're going to push Forego rather than us,” says Mickey Taylor. “Forego's the house horse [the I gelding is owned by N.Y.R.A. trustee Martha Gerry]. We're new, and they don't like new things or people. At a party this summer in Saratoga, I I overheard one of the old‐liners say about us, ‘Give them three years. You won't know their names.’ The Belmont Stakes? nothing special for them. Just another eighth race, just business as usual.”\n\nBut not for America's racing public. On a damp and windy June 11, Seattle Slew outdrew Secretariat's Belmont Stakes by more than 2,500 in attendance and by a full percentage point in CBS's audience share. The fans’ faith was rewarded: Over a muddy track, Slew led seven others in a wire‐to‐wire victory. The colt had swept the Triple Crown, and with oatleaf clusters for distinction: He was the first auctionbought horse ever to pull it off, and the first horse, period, to do it with a perfect record. Minutes after the race, Turner appeared in the jammed Belmont press box. He was smiling, naturally, and in delicious shell shock. But before he turned to make his happy stand, he took off his lucky tweed cap and handed it to Jimmy (Squirrel) Weininger, a longtime press‐box aidede‐camp. Long before the Wood Memorial, Squirrel had asked Turner if he could have the cap “if the horse goes all the way.” Turner had said yes, and, in his moment of centerstage triumph, he remembered.\n\nAn hour later, Turner was in Esposito's Tavern, just off the backstretch on Plainfield Avenue. For years it has been his watering hole/office/campsite. From a barstool there in his jump‐jock days, he had accepted upcoming steeplechase rides even if they were a few hundred miles away, hence another nickname: Turnpike Turner. Now the new Triple Crown trainer was mobbed by friends offering him a choice of Scotch or Maalox. Turner said he had to make an appearance at a “swells’ party down the road, but only for a minute or so.” There were mutterings of “Sure, Billy,” but within half an hour he was back, elbowing his way into the modest little joint. He was greeted by resounding applause. Think of it: a racetrack bar giving somebody a standing ovation. “Can you believe this?” Turner asked softly of a friend, and all he could do was shake his head and look at the floor.\n\nLate that night, Turner said his only regret was that the Belmont track had come up muddy. “If it'd been right, we'd have just let Slew roll. We've never done that before, and it would have been devastating. I really wanted the public to see what he could do, and I wanted to chase all the disbelievers back to their caves. That was the plan: Get to the last one and let him tear the place down.”\n\nIn Turner's mind, the Belmont Stakes was to have been “the last one” for a while. Racing history is sadly littered with the names of horses that campaigned hard for the Triple Crown and raced too soon afterward. “There just isn't any encore for the Triple Crown,” says Turner. “The record told me, and instinct did too, that you should just pull your colt's shoes and let him roll in the sand—for about as long as it takes your own fingernails to grow back.”\n\nBut to the victors (including Jim Hill, who, it was revealed, had been a hidden partner of the Taylors all along) had gone the spoils—more than $700,000 by now—and they were spoiling for more. Already begun or contemplated were aggressive flirtations with outfits pushing feed, petgrooming clippers, shirts,\n\nMany second‐guessed Turner for rarely allowing Slew, a natural sprinter, to “breeze” like this in a morning workout.\n\nsportswear and pajamas. Book and TV‐movie rights were in the works, and the Hills and Taylors were now “available for personal appearances and TV shows.” Slew was being greened, and Turner is still seeing red: “The commercializing just detracts from the horse's aura of greatness. Gad, there's even a Seattle Slew Suite at the Sands Hotel in Vegas. Slew's not a circus animal, not a King Kong.”\n\nDifferences over merchandizing paled next to those arising from the decision to run the colt in the $300,000 Swaps Stakes on July 3 at California's Hollywood Park, Taylor recalls a unanimity of opinion, but Turner says he wasn't having any of it: “We hadn't trained for the race, hadn't planned for it. We were ready to yank his racing shoes, and suddenly it's a new ballgame. I felt I was losing control of the animal.” (Two days before he shipped West, Slew was tranquilized for a Xerox commercial; he was, of course, tranquilized once again for the flight itself.) “There was so much money involved, and Jim and Mickey were so far gone, that I never said a word. Anything shy of ‘The horse is going to break down if you run him’ would have been overruled. No question — big bucks were talking and they were all ears.” And in the Swaps, Slew, failing to fire, finished fourth.\n\nMickey Taylor says Turner doesn't always have the foresight he claims. But Turner's uncharacteristic behavior indicated a trainer at odds with his owners long before the colt's first loss. Atypically, Turner wasn't aboard the shipping flight, and he made his reservations well in advance to return to New York directly after the race, while Slew and his owners would be heading for a parade date at Longacre Park outside Seattle.\n\n“No, on this one I just stepped into the background and stayed there,” Turner says. “I was exhausted. The pressure'd started with the Champagne and hadn't let up. I was so tired I just didn't c‐a‐r‐e.” Turner was more than a little cynical, too, having decided to “make the best of it in other ways” on the Coast. He rested his head in a Beverly Hills mansion once owned by both Charlie Chaplin and Cecil B. De Mille. One evening before the Swaps, he invited Slew's owners over for a drink. “Wait till they see this,” he said, knee‐deep in an Oriental rug and surveying Oscars, the shooting script of “The Ten Commandments,” and shelf upon shelf of other Hollywood memorabilia. “They'll flip.” So they did. And when owner Taylor asked trainer Turner how he'd arranged it, Turner replied, “Mickey, this is a pretty fair example of where one fast‐runnin’ race horse can take you.”\n\nJust after the Swaps, Turner's seasoned racing perspective stood him in good stead once again. “John Pittston, our groom, and I were walking the horse back to the barn, and he said to me, ‘You know, we can take this gettin’ beat, ‘cause we're race‐trackers. But they’ — meaning the owners ‘they won't be able to.’\n\n“The Hills took it the worst. ( Back at the barn, Jim Hill blew up at Turner, forbidding him to talk to the press immediately.) But look, I was the only one in the whole outfit who'd ever faced ultimate disaster in racing — I mean, my whole damned career was on the line with that stable fire and the owners who canned me. Jim Hill wasn't used to this side of the game. Only thing he was used to was being a super vet, patching up somebody else's disasters. This was the first time he'd been that close that long to a great horse, had seen him fly — up, up, no reason not another notch higher and then, boom. He was Just green at losing. Losing's hard, and I'd had a little more practice at it, that's all.”\n\nTurner was soon to have yet a little more practice at losing. Shortly after the decision to race Slew in the Swaps, Turner had ducked into his shedrow office one morning to take a phone call. He came out crying. Syl Labrot, one of the other owners in his barn, was in the final stages of cancer. Labrot had a filly named Carry It High, a 3‐year‐old Turner had carefully trained but never raced. Instant decision: Accelerate her training and find a race for her. On June 27, she was a close second to the fine colt Buckfinder. Nine days later—Seattle Slew in the interim suffered his only loss—Turner raced her again and again she was second. Two days thereafter, Labrot died. Carry It High's second defeat was, according to Turner, “the single worst thing that happened all year.” All year long, Slew or no Slew, Turner had worried about his other horses, his other owners. “I wanted that man to go out a winner,” he says, “and I couldn't get the job done.” On July 21, Carry It High won a six‐furlong race in style, but that was cold comfort to the trainer with the Triple Crown champion in his barn.\n\nSometime in the weeks upcoming, that champion will be out of the barn again. Unraced since the Swaps fiasco, the colt has been painstakingly guided through an early‐fall siege of slight fevers, coughing and a mild neck rash. “Any other horse, you'd be training or even racing him. But no, we're going slow again. Maybe a race at Aqueduct late in the year, but for sure the Hialeah Invitational [a mile and an eighth for 4‐year‐olds] in late January. He'll be there and he'll be fit.”\n\nIn the meantime, Turner keeps training for the TaylorHill interests and the four other ownerships in his barn. And he keeps looking for another big horse. As he remarked before the Derby, before Slew answered the question for the first time, “You can't buy horses like this one. It's a long shot to breed ‘em and it's hard to steal ‘em. One day you just look up and there it is. And then you just stumble along as best you can”—Billy Turner winks like a man with a headful of secrets—“and you take things from there.”"
