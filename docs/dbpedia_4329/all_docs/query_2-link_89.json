        "text": "TODAY'S BRIT MEDAL HOPES\n\nKeely Hodgkinson is among the favourites to win gold in the women’s 800m final (8.45pm), three years on from silver in Tokyo.\n\nKimberley Woods, Mallory Franklin and Joe Clarke could secure a triple-header in the maiden Olympic kayak cross finals (3.55pm).\n\nGB will hope to retain their triathlon mixed relay (7am) and the women’s cycling team sprint (6.55pm) offers a real medal chance on the opening day in the velodrome.\n\nBRITS TO WATCH\n\nThe sport climbing gets underway with four Brits - Hamish McArthur and 19-year-old sensation Toby Roberts starting with their bouldering in the boulder and lead event (9am).\n\nAnd the women’s hockey team face a nightmare quarter-final against the all-conquering Dutch (4.30pm).\n\nGLOBAL STARS TODAY\n\nSweden’s Mondo Duplantis will try and break his own latest world record once again in the men’s paul vault final (6pm).\n\nThe men’s football reaches the semi-finals with hosts France facing Egypt (8pm) after Spain vs Morocco (5pm).\n\nAnd this will be the last we see of Simone Biles in Paris. She is set to go in the women’s balance beam (11.30am) and floor finals (1.20pm).\n\nFANCY SOMETHING DIFFERENT?\n\nIt is the final day for both the 3x3 basketball and the surfing.\n\nThe 3x3 basketball finishes with the gold medal matches from 9pm at La Concorde.\n\nOver in Tahiti, Gabriel Medina appeared to defy gravity with THAT incredible levitating photo and has a shot at gold today.\n\nSTATS MAD\n\n0 - A rule change to the artistic swimming (formerly synchronised swimming) means men are now able to compete in the team event for the first time in Olympics history… but the new legislation only came in 18 months and precisely ZERO males were selected."
