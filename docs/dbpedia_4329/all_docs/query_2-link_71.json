        "text": "A big chunk of the recently reimagined Mickey’s Toontown is once again behind construction walls as Disneyland crews work to address persistent problems that continue to plague the popular kiddie playland.\n\nCentoonial Park remains closed through Oct. 22 for a month-long refurbishment and Goofy’s How-to-Play Yard will close Oct. 23 for additional work, according to MiceChat.\n\nSign up for our Park Life newsletter and find out what’s new and interesting every week at Southern California’s theme parks. Subscribe here.\n\nSEE ALSO: Disneyland trades Toontown’s cartoon chaos for family-friendly calmness\n\nThe recently refreshed Mickey’s Toontown that reopened in March at the Anaheim theme park has undergone a series of tune-ups and touch-ups in the ensuing months to address issues with everything from artificial turf and rubber flooring to playground equipment and water features.\n\nDisneyland temporarily closed a few areas of Mickey’s Toontown on a rolling basis in June and July for maintenance work. Some of those areas are once again behind construction walls for a second round of fixes.\n\nSEE ALSO: I ate everything at Cafe Daisy in Disneyland’s Toontown — Here are my favorites from best to worst\n\nWork in Mickey’s Toontown will occur in two phases this fall starting with Centoonial Park and followed by Goofy’s How-To-Play Yard with a goal of completing the work by early November, according to Disneyland officials.\n\nThe Centoonial Park work includes adjusting the soft surface around the Dreaming Tree, repairing a leak under the Mickey and Minnie fountain and replacing a section of artificial turf with brick pavers, according to Disneyland officials.\n\nSEE ALSO: I wore Disneyland’s new mix-and-match Toontown costumes with 1,000 combinations\n\nPlay elements will be added and repaired in Goofy’s How-To-Play Yard, according to Disneyland officials.\n\n“This will be the second long closure for Centoonial Park since the land reopened,” according to MiceChat. “Not only have many of the interactive elements of Goofy’s yard broken and been removed, but the water play area has never opened.”\n\nSEE ALSO: Disneyland rebuilds Mickey’s Toontown from the ground up for kids with special needs\n\nDisneyland officials understand the frustration of seeing construction walls and apologize for the inconvenience during the critical work to improve the guest experience.\n\nDisneyland has been forced to address a host of issues in Toontown since the popular kiddie land that regularly teems with wall-to-wall visitors returned from a yearlong refurbishment.\n\nDonald Duck’s water play area has yet to open. Teeter totters and a colorful bird house have been removed from Goofy’s Play Yard. Visitor traffic patterns over a section of turf between the Mickey & Minnie fountain and the Walt’s Dreaming Tree are forcing Disneyland to install pavers as a replacement."
