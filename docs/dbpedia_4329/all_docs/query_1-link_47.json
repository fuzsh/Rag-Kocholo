        "text": "OFFICIALS of Muttontown may want to check the zoning laws. One resident keeps a horse in his basement.\n\nHe was riding it the other day -- hunched over, knees together, flicking a whip quicker than one could blink. Faster and faster he rode, until rider and horse moved in perfect synchronization. It was beauty in motion, even if the ride shared space with an old television set and a pile of discarded Tonka toys.\n\nThe basement horse, a mechanical version of a thoroughbred, is the well-kept secret of Jerry D. Bailey, the No. 1 jockey in America.\n\nMr. Bailey may be Long Island's well-kept secret. He has lived in Muttontown with his wife, Suzee, for 10 years. Their son, Justin, 4, goes to school there. Yet outside the racing world, few people on the Island realize that in their midst resides the winner of just about every prestigious horse-race.\n\nKentucky Derby? He has won two. Plus a Preakness, Belmont Stakes, Breeders Cup -- the list goes on and on. He has been the Jockey of the Year for the last two years. Then there is the Racing Hall of Fame. He has also headed the Jockey Guild for seven years. This is the jockey who rode Cigar, the most famous racehorse since Secretariat.\n\nAt 39, Mr. Bailey is at the top of his profession. He is the Muhammad Ali, Mickey Mantle and Bart Starr of horse racing. Yet, because of the fewer followers of his sport, and perhaps because of the simplicity of his name, he is not a household word.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
