        "text": "Three things that my family loves are Disney World, reality TV, and competition. So once a year during our summer Disney World vacation, we combine all of these together into what we affectionately call ‚ÄúThe Amazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù. In case you aren‚Äôt familiar with the popular reality TV series ‚ÄúThe Amazing Race‚Äú, the basic premise is that teams of two compete in challenges while racing around the world for a million dollars. We follow this same format (minus the million) and create new challenges each year.\n\nPlease read on for a complete copy of one of our races and to learn more about how to create your very own ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù for your next vacation!\n\nCreating Your Own ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù\n\nCreating our ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù takes some prep work so we generally start putting it together about a month or two before our vacation.\n\nTeams\n\nWe begin by setting up teams. Teams of two work well for our race, because we generally travel with six people. You can adjust your team size for what will work best for your group. For our race, we like to have three teams so that there will be a first, second, and third place. Grandma and grandpa always make up one team, then my husband and I each partner up with one of our boys. In the interest of fairness, every year we switch up which child we are paired with. Depending on who you are traveling with, you can assign people to teams or even draw names from a hat. Of course, a team isn‚Äôt complete without a name. We like to stick with the Disney theme, so we have Team Mickey, Team Pluto, and Team Donald.\n\nTeam Attire\n\nTo get into the team spirit, we like to wear something special on ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù day. We‚Äôve worn everything from Disney shirts to homemade Amazing Race lanyards. You could even wear DisneyBounding style outfits to represent your team‚Äôs character name if you would like.\n\nThe Rules\n\nIt is always a good idea to set up some ground rules before any competition. You can make the rules for your ‚ÄúAmazing Race‚Äù as complex or as simple as you want. To get you started, here are the basic rules that we use:\n\nAll tasks must be completed and documented as noted (with photo, object, answer, etc.).\n\nChallenges may be completed simultaneously, but teammates may not split up.\n\nWe are using the honor system; if a challenge requires you to experience an attraction, you must complete the entire attraction.\n\nYou may ask other guests or cast members for help, but they may not complete your challenges for you.\n\nFor each task skipped or completed incorrectly, a 20 minute time penalty will be added to that team‚Äôs arrival time at the Final Pit Stop. For any park skipped, a 90 minute penalty will be added to that team‚Äôs arrival time at the Final Pit Stop in addition to the per task penalty.\n\nAs you may have guessed by these rules, I have one person in my group that is always looking for a loop-hole. He likes to keep me on my toes by trying to figure out different ways to beat the game every time! Watch out for those sneaky Disney villain-types in your group and make your rules accordingly. üòâ\n\nPrizes\n\nThe sky‚Äôs the limit on what you would like to choose for prizes. We‚Äôve done lots of different things like Disney pins, medals, and plush animals. Think about what would appeal most to your group and choose prizes for first, second, and third place.\n\nChallenges\n\nNow this is where it gets really exciting! You can get creative and come up with any type of challenge that you can imagine. Over the years we‚Äôve included several different tasks such as trivia, finding hidden Mickeys, riding attractions, and more. When creating your challenges you‚Äôll want to consider who is participating and how long you want your race to last. Depending on how complicated your race, I like to make up booklets for each team that include all of the rules and challenge information.\n\nAn ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù\n\nNow that we‚Äôve taken a look at the basics, here‚Äôs an ‚ÄúAmazing Race‚Äù that my family completed: Please feel free to use it on your next Disney World vacation. For this particular version of the ‚ÄúAmazing Race‚Äù, we chose to only visit three parks ‚Äì Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Hollywood Studios.\n\nThe Mission\n\nTo be the first team to arrive at the Final Pit Stop Location in Downtown Disney after completing all of the required tasks.\n\nThe Basics\n\nAll teams will depart for the bus stop at 8:45am and will take the first available bus to the Magic Kingdom.\n\nOnce at the Magic Kingdom, each team must complete the Road Block, the Detour and the Check Point.\n\nOnce those tasks are completed, each team must take Disney Transportation to Epcot.\n\nOnce at Epcot, each team must complete the Road Block, the Detour and the Check Point.\n\nOnce those tasks are completed, each team must take Disney Transportation or walk to Hollywood Studios.\n\nOnce at Hollywood Studios, each team must complete the Road Block, the Detour and the Check Point.\n\nOnce those tasks are completed, each team must take Disney Transportation to Downtown Disney.\n\nOnce at Downtown Disney, each team must complete the Road Block and proceed to the Final Pit Stop.\n\nThe winning team will be the first team to arrive at the Final Pit Stop with all tasks completed (after any penalties have been assessed).\n\nThe Rules\n\nAll tasks must be completed and documented as noted (with photo, object, answer, etc.).\n\nRoad Blocks and Detours may be completed simultaneously, but teammates cannot split up.\n\nWe are using the honor system; if a challenge requires you to experience an attraction, you must complete the entire attraction.\n\nYou may ask Cast Members and other guests for help, but they cannot complete your challenges.\n\nFor each task skipped or completed incorrectly, a 20 minute time penalty will be added to that team‚Äôs arrival time at the Final Pit Stop. For any park skipped, a 90 minute penalty will be added to that team‚Äôs arrival time at the Final Pit Stop in addition to the per task penalty.\n\nThe Prizes\n\nEach player from the First Place team wins a 1st place medal and that team gets to choose which park we will visit that night.\n\nEach player from the Second Place team wins a 2nd place medal and that team gets to choose a dinner place for that night.\n\nEach player from the Third Place team wins a 3rd place medal and that team gets to choose a dessert place for that night.\n\nFirst Leg ‚Äì Magic Kingdom\n\nRoad Block\n\nEach team must complete one of the following activities:\n\nRide Buzz LightYear‚Äôs Space Ranger Spin ‚Äì At least one racer must score 5000 points or more.

Document this by bringing both racers completed Duffys to the Final Pit Stop.\n\nCheck Point\n\nOnce your team has completed the Road Block and Detour, one racer must text the other teams with the following information:\n\nA photo of the exit of Epcot\n\nThe current time that you are leaving the park\n\nOnce your team has completed the Check Point, proceed to Hollywood Studios using Disney transportation or on foot.\n\nThird Leg ‚Äì Hollywood Studios\n\nRoad Block\n\nEach team must find 2 of the following hidden Mickeys.

Look between the pizza-slice constellation and the comet.\n\nNear the Stage 1 Company Store, there are several Hidden Mickeys in the purple and yellow spilled paint splatters on the sidewalk outside the Muppet Store in Disney‚Äôs Hollywood Studios.\n\nAt the Stage 1 Company Store, inside the store, high up on the mural, a Mickey hides in the clouds.\n\nIn Pixar Place, there is a snack stand across from Toy Story Midway Mania.

We range in age from early elementary school kids to retired seniors. Everyone was able to keep up, but most of us were exhausted by the end. We ran this race in June so the heat, humidity, and crowds were certainly a factor. The ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around Disney World‚Äù is meant to be fun and not grueling, so through the years we‚Äôve made adjustments based on how intense of a race our traveling group can handle. This year we‚Äôll be changing it up and doing an ‚ÄúAmazing Race Around World Showcase‚Äù that I‚Äôm working on right now. If you get the chance to add a little of this kind of Disney magic to your vacation, I highly recommend it. Our races are some of our most cherished Disney memories!"
