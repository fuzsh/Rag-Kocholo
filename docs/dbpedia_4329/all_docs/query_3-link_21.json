        "text": "Days ago, as the old year drew to a close, there was a cheerful power struggle here between Richard Hannon the 68-year-old champion trainer and Richard Hannon his 38-year-old son, who took over the licence on 1 January. The point at issue was when a youngster called Unscripted should make its debut, the older man being understandably keen to run him in December and enjoy one final winner to go with the previous 4,197.\n\n\"I said, no, no, the right race for him is after New Year's Day,\" says Hannon Jr with a broad grin. \"I rang the owner quickly, got my point across.\" The horse duly became his first runner and first winner at Wolverhampton on Friday night, hacking up by 10 lengths. \"Fantastic,\" he says of the experience. \"I was there myself, I haven't been to Wolverhampton for two years but it was great. Nice to actually be there. First race I've watched live for a long time.\"\n\nHannon Jr was the label attached to him for the past 15 years as he served a long apprenticeship under his father but he will appear on racecards simply as Richard Hannon, offering a reassuring sense of continuity. He is plainly gratified to be the man in charge but the job will still be shared between the pair and there is a good deal of amiable clowning between them.\n\nOn New Year's Day, as they went out to lunch, the handover was marked by what seemed, to the new trainer, a significant moment when his father donned the jacket marked \"Jnr\". \"He didn't know, I had to tell him. He said: 'I wouldn't have put that on if I'd known'. Next thing, he's down the pub, showing everybody he put it on by mistake.\"\n\nThe oft-repeated line here is that nothing is new beyond the man holding the licence but in fact several things are, notably Hannon's mint home which he and his young family have been trying out for two months. Both front and rear offer perfect views of the stable's gallops, though the trainer does not expect to benefit, planning to be on the ground, examining his horses from yards away.\n\nEliza, his two-year-old, stands on the dining table to observe each day's work. Jack, born on Christmas Day, watched Unscripted's race with his eyes closed and will therefore make a good trainer, his father says.\n\nAlso new is the office, larger and smarter than the one before, a fit place to welcome Qatari royals and the other powerful, deep-pocketed owners who have joined the yard in recent years. It has something of the Bond villain command centre about it now, with seven tall computer screens mounted on the far wall, facing a row of staff who use them to sort through the details of 240 horses, each in need of a suitable race.\n\nAnother innovation: horses are weighed at regular intervals, and before and after each race. \"Dad would never have had that. 'What do you need scales for, the best pair of scales you've got are your eyes.' I used to think I'd rather not go and do a job with that guesswork, I'd rather have facts written down in front of me that I know are correct.\"\n\nThe intuition of the Hannons will still play a large part in how the job is done. \"The system is the same as it always has been and I think you can say that it works, so there's no reason … if it ain't broke, don't fix it, you know?\"\n\nRichard Hannon on …\n\nHis team for 2014 We've got some really, really nice two-year-olds. Spent a bit more money this year than we have done in the past, just because we had the firepower, and obviously Sheikh Hamdan's brought some lovely horses here. He has about 20 here. He sent us 12 yearlings, smashers, all of them. We're very lucky to have his patronage.\n\nToormore The champion two-year-old. He gets no penalty for the Greenham [a 2,000 Guineas trial at Newbury in April]. And he won his maiden on soft ground, so if it turned up soft there, it wouldn't do him any harm.\n\nBunker He won the Francois Boutin, which is normally a good race, and he beat the subsequent Lagardere winner, Karakontie. And then we put him away for the year. So hopefully he's going to go for the Dante and then the Derby. He'll definitely get the trip, he's by Hurricane Run.\n\nShifting Power A really nice, dark horse. He won his first two races very easily. He beat Treaty Of Paris six lengths in a conditions race at Newmarket. He has done well, he's as big as any [horse of his age] I've seen in this yard, ever. He's really filled out and done well. I don't know where we're going to go with him yet because we have to sort the others out.\n\nNight Of Thunder A really nice horse. He's done very well. For some reason, Hughesie [Richard, stable jockey and the trainer's brother-in-law] always bangs on about him. Hughesie loves him, he obviously gave him a great feel at Doncaster. The owner had the third in the 2,000 Guineas last year, so hopefully this horse can go a couple of places closer, you never know. He's got loads of speed. Up to now, he's done extremely well. He's filled out. He wasn't the biggest of horses last year but he's plenty of size now.\n\nToronado There's a chance he might go to Dubai but I would think unlikely. I'd like to save him for Royal Ascot and then his season will start from Royal Ascot forward. The Queen Anne would do him.\n\nSky Lantern There's the obvious races like the Falmouth and go on from there, the Rothschild and, if she gets a mile and a quarter, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. She's away at Highclere now, having a very nice rest. She went there last year and it did her the power of good. She's going to stay there a bit longer this year, a couple of months, because she had a bit of a hard trip to Hong Kong. It was the end of a long year and she was only three.\n\nOlympic Glory His first target will be the Lockinge at Newbury in May.\n\nPiping Rock, who died from colic recently That was a big feather in my cap, to train one for Godolphin. I was looking forward to that. Just having a foot in the door. But there was nothing the vets could do, they tried their best and that's that. We might get another chance, you never know. It was a big thing for them to show support and it was a shame we couldn't repay Sheikh Mohammed. But hopefully we'll get another chance. When I was growing up as a kid, I was at school, always had the Racing Post, I always used to say, 'Oh, I'd love to train for Sheikh Mohammed, imagine if you had one for him!' So I get one and that happens. But, you know we're all in long trousers, as Simon Crisford [Godolphin spokesman] said to me. These things happen, it's very unfortunate and it's a big loss for both teams.\n\nDomestic ambitions I'd like to train more Classic winners [than Hannon Sr]. English Guineas, he won with Mon Fils, Don't Forget Me and Tirol. Sky Lantern, if you get my drift, was a bit of a grey area, because that was mine but it went under his tally. So he trained four. Obviously, I'd love to train a Derby winner. You'd love to do all those things but, if it doesn't happen, we're not going to get massively disappointed. We want to keep it existing as a thriving business and a place where people come and are able to enjoy their horses. As long as we enjoy it, then they'll enjoy it. I think setting goalposts is quite a dangerous thing to do but we'd love to train 200 winners [this season] and win a lot of prize money. If that means we're champion trainer, that would be fantastic. It's not necessarily about me, the place is run as an outfit and it's a very big team, good lads, riders, jockeys, my Dad. It's everybody, though it's my name at the top."
