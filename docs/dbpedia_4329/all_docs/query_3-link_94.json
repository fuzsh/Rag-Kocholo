        "text": "The films on this list would be great for horse-loving patrons and students. Many of these titles would be well-suited for children's film collections. Outdoor venues should consider hosting a public screening for these heartwarming equine selections.\n\nHidalgo (2004)\n\nViggo Mortensen stars in this picture, portraying the legendary long-distance rider (and possible conman) Frank Hopkins. Hopkins begins the film as part of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West show and is then drawn into a long-distance race in the Saudi Arabian desert known as the “Ocean of Fire.” Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo race against purebred Arabian horses and Bedouin and Arab riders. Co-starring Said Taghmaoui, Omar Sharif, and J.K. Simmons, this film combines history with action for one hell of a ride.\n\nRead our review of Hidalgo\n\nNational Velvet (1944)\n\nBased on the 1935 novel by Enid Bagnold, this film features stars Angela Lansbury, Anne Revere, Mickey Rooney, Reginald Owen, and a young Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor portrays the horse-obsessed Velvet Brown, who wins a horse in a raffle she names “The Pie.” Mickey Rooney portrays former jockey Michael “Mi” Taylor, who ends up training Velvet and The Pie. This is one of the preeminent films about horses (it was added to the National Film Registry in 2003) and won two Oscars. This one is a must for any equestrian fanatic.\n\nThe Horse Whisperer (1998)\n\nAlso based on a novel, this film features Robert Redford as the titular horse whisperer Tom Booker. He tries to remedy injured horse Pilgrim, as well as her rider Grace (Scarlett Johansson), who was severely injured in an accident with Pilgrim. The film works well, as it demonstrates various relationships including Grace and her mother Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), Tom and Grace, and Pilgrim with the rest of the family. A true tearjerker, but one that’s good for the whole family.\n\nRead our review of The Horse Whisperer\n\nSecretariat (2010)\n\nSecretariat’s unbelievable Belmont win (31 lengths, over 80 yards) is the stuff of legend. This biopic, however, is more concerned with how Secretariat became the legend we all know today. Diane Lane, Scott Glenn, John Malkovich, Margo Martindale, and Graham McTavish all star in this thrilling true story. You may know about how Secretariat became a legend. But this is the story of what happened before.\n\nRead our review of Secretariat\n\nSpirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002)\n\nBefore he was shilling cryptocurrency, Matt Damon provided the voice…of a horse in an animated film. What a life. He plays Spirit, a stallion who endures mistreatment at the hands of US cavalrymen in the 19th century (including “The Colonel” based on Civil War icon George Armstrong Custer). This animated flick is good for kids and families and teaches lessons on identity, love, and perseverance."
