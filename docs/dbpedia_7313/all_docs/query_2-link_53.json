        "text": "It was another in a succession of strong years for the N.H.L.: exciting play, soaring television ratings, record revenue and the fourth straight Stanley Cup finals between traditional hockey cities. But even as the Boston Bruins were raising the silver chalice on June 15, the riot was on outside in the streets of Vancouver, a four-hour orgy of destruction that injured scores of people and caused millions of dollars in damage.\n\nThus began perhaps the N.H.L.’s worst off-season. A league reeling from the accidental death of Derek Boogaard from a drug and alcohol overdose was further saddened by the apparent suicide of two other enforcers and the deaths of several former players in the Lokomotiv plane crash near Yaroslavl, Russia.\n\nIt is with a sense of relief that the 2011-12 regular season begins Thursday with games in Boston, Toronto and, perhaps a bit ominously, Vancouver. But as the summer reminds us, in the N.H.L. nowadays enormous success and optimism coexist with dark clouds and trepidation. So it is with the season ahead.\n\nThe crackdown on concussion-causing boarding and checks to the head is burnishing the league’s reputation, but will that be offset by what could emerge about the widespread use of painkillers, or a civil trial involving a 2004 attack by Todd Bertuzzi that ended Steve Moore’s career?\n\nWill the euphoria of the Winnipeg Jets’ rebirth be dampened by continued misery in Phoenix? Will financial growth and fan popularity be tempered by February’s talks on the expiring collective bargaining agreement?\n\nPerhaps, but starting Thursday night, hockey takes center stage.\n\nThe Rangers look strongest among the three teams in the New York metropolitan area. The arrival of center Brad Richards, seventh among active players in assists per game, brings the promise of a potent scoring partnership with Marian Gaborik. The young core is a year older and, presumably, better, but can the blue-line linchpin Marc Staal recover from the concussion he returned from too early last season? Will goalie Henrik Lundqvist be overworked a sixth straight season, leaving him too tired to excel in the playoffs?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
