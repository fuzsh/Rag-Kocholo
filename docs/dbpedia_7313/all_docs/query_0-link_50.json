        "text": "Toronto, ON – The Ontario Hockey League today announced that Arizona Coyotes prospect Noel Hoefenmayer of the Ottawa 67’s is the OHL ‘On the Run’ Player of the Week for the first week of playoff action ending March 25 scoring twice with four assists for six points in two games.\n\nHoefenmayer recorded back-to-back three-point performances for the Eastern Conference’s eighth place 67’s who opened the 2018 OHL Playoffs with a split on the road against the first place Hamilton Bulldogs. The defenceman played a role in 75% of the 67’s scoring last week tying for the league lead in points through two post-season games. In Game 1 on Thursday he scored twice and added an assist receiving second star honours despite a 6-3 loss, then recorded three assists in Game 2 on Sunday including a helper on Sam Bitten’s game-winner as the 67’s grinded out a 5-4 victory. The series shifts to the nation’s capital for Game’s 3 and 4 on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nA 19-year-old from North York, Ont., Hoefenmayer is playing in his third OHL season with the 67’s since chosen by the club in the second round of the 2015 Priority Selection. He led the 67’s blue line in scoring for the second straight season producing seven goals and 26 assists for 33 points in 65 games. Hoefenmayer was a fourth round pick by the Coyotes in the 2017 NHL Draft.\n\nWatch video highlights of Hoefenmayer and the 67’s against the Bulldogs in Game 1 and Game 2.\n\nAlso considered for the award this week was St. Louis Blues prospect Robert Thomas of the Hamilton Bulldogs who equaled Hoefenmayer’s six points in two games by also scoring twice with four assists. Ottawa Senators prospect Alex Formenton of the London Knights scored five goals in two games against the Owen Sound Attack, and goaltender Mario Culina of the Kitchener Rangers posted a 2-0 record against the Guelph Storm stopping 77 shots for a goals-against-average of 1.50 and save percentage of .963.\n\n2017-18 OHL ‘On the Run’ Players of the Week – Playoffs:\n\nMar. 19 – Mar. 25: Noel Hoefenmayer (Ottawa 67’s)\n\n2017-18 OHL ‘On the Run’ Players of the Week – Regular Season:\n\nMar. 12 – Mar. 18: Nick Suzuki (Owen Sound Attack)\n\nMar. 5 – Mar. 11: Dmitry Sokolov (Barrie Colts)\n\nFeb. 26 – Mar. 4: Robert Thomas (Hamilton Bulldogs)\n\nFeb. 19 – Feb. 25: Jordan Kyrou (Sarnia Sting)\n\nFeb. 12 – Feb. 18: Aaron Luchuk (Barrie Colts)\n\nFeb. 5 – Feb. 11: Liam Foudy (London Knights)\n\nJan. 29 – Feb. 4: Kenny Huether (Oshawa Generals)\n\nJan. 22 – Jan. 28: Jeremy Helvig (Kingston Frontenacs)\n\nJan. 15 – Jan. 21: Jordan Kyrou (Sarnia Sting)\n\nJan. 8 – Jan. 14: Taylor Raddysh (Sault Ste.

He became the first rookie in franchise history to lead the team in scoring, and is the first OHL defenceman since London’s Rick Corriveau in 1987-88 to lead all rookies in scoring.\n\n“It is an honour to be selected as the OHL Rookie of the Year,” said Merkley. “Knowing that there are so many talented first year players, makes the award extra special. I would like to thank my teammates and the Storm organization for all their help and support.”\n\nThe 16-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., selected first overall by the Storm in the 2016 OHL Priority Selection, is just the second member of the organization to earn the award following fellow Storm first overall pick Jeff O’Neill during the 1992-93 season. Merkley’s 55 points are the most by a Storm 16-year-old since O’Neill’s 79 during his first campaign.\n\n“Being selected as OHL Rookie of the Year is a special honour, but one that Ryan richly deserves,” said Mike Kelly, Guelph’s departing General Manager. “Even as a 16-year-old, Ryan was a critical part of a very young Guelph Storm Hockey team, and he provided our fans, and fans throughout the OHL with some spectacular hockey memories. As good as Ryan was this past year, he will be even more special in upcoming seasons.”\n\nMerkley joined the OHL after earning GTHL Player of the Year honours with the Toronto Jr. Canadiens and made an immediate impact with recognition as the OHL’s Rookie of the Month for October and December and represented Team Canada Red at the 2016 World Under-17 Hockey Challenge in Sault Ste. Marie. He recorded 16 multi-point performances during 2016-17 and was voted third in both the Best Playmaker and Best Stickhandler categories in the Western Conference Coaches Poll.\n\nFirst presented in 1973, Emms Family Award recipients include Wayne Gretzky (Sault Ste. Marie 1977-78), Joe Thornton (Sault Ste. Marie 1995-96), Rick Nash (London 2000-01), Taylor Hall (Windsor 2007-08), and most recently Alex DeBrincat (Erie 2014-15), and Alex Nylander (Mississauga 2015-16). Merkley is the eighth player to earn the Emms Family Award after also earning the Jack Ferguson Award as the first overall pick in the OHL Priority Selection beginning with O’Neill, Patrick O’Sullivan (Mississauga 2001-02), Rob Schremp (Mississauga 2002-03), John Tavares (Oshawa 2005-06), Aaron Ekblad (Barrie 2011-12), Connor McDavid (Erie 2012-13), and Travis Konecny (Ottawa 2013-14).\n\nThe Emms Family Award was donated by Leighton “Hap” Emms, former owner of the Barrie, Niagara Falls, and St. Catharines OHL franchises. The award is selected by all 20 member club General Managers. Teams were asked to submit only one nominee from their own club for consideration on the ballot and were not permitted to vote for the player from their own hockey club. Players received five points for a first vote, three points for a second place vote, and one point for a third place vote.\n\nMerkley earned 75 of a possible 95 voting points ahead of forward Akil Thomas of the Niagara IceDogs who finished second with 44 voting points and forward Allan McShane of the Oshawa Generals who finished in third with 24 voting points.\n\nThe Emms Family Award will be formally presented to Merkley at the OHL’s annual Awards Ceremony at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto on Thursday June 8. He will be the OHL’s nominee for CHL Rookie of the Year to be announced at the Mastercard Memorial Cup on Saturday May 27.\n\nMerkley was also announced to the OHL’s First All-Rookie Team alongside NHL Draft prospect Eemeli Rasanen of the Kingston Frontenacs on defence, and goaltender Jacob Ingham of the Mississauga Steelheads. First team forwards include McShane at centre, Thomas at right wing, and Kingston’s Linus Nyman at left wing. Second team honours went to NHL Draft prospects Adam Ruzicka of the Sarnia Sting, Alex Formenton of the London Knights, and Greg Meireles of the Kitchener Rangers at forward, while 16-year-olds Giovanni Vallati of Kitchener, and Owen Lalonde of the Sudbury Wolves comprise the defence. Second team goaltending honours went to Matthew Villalta of the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds.\n\nThe OHL All-Rookie Teams were also selected by the OHL’s General Managers. Players were voted on initially by position within their conference receiving five points for a first place vote, three for a second place vote, and one for a third. Top vote getters in each position made up the final ballot that was then circulated to all 20 teams.\n\n2016-17 OHL All-Rookie Teams (voting points in brackets):\n\nFirst Team:\n\nCentre – Allan McShane, Oshawa Generals (85) Left Wing – Linus Nyman, Kingston Frontenacs (73) Right Wing – Akil Thomas, Niagara IceDogs (93) Defence – Ryan Merkley, Guelph Storm (91) Defence – Eemeli Rasanen, Kingston Frontenacs (74) Goaltender – Jacob Ingham, Mississauga Steelheads (73)\n\nSecond Team:\n\nCentre – Adam Ruzicka, Sarnia Sting (51) Left Wing – Alex Formenton, London Knights (38) Right Wing – Greg Meireles, Kitchener Rangers (39) Defence – Giovanni Vallati, Kitchener Rangers (44) Defence – Owen Lalonde, Sudbury Wolves (39) Goaltender – Matthew Villalta, Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (70)\n\nHeight: 6’1”\n\nWeight: 167 pounds\n\nDate of birth: September 13, 1999\n\nHometown: King City, Ontario\n\nPosition: Left Wing\n\nShoots: Left\n\nOHL Draft: Round 11, 216th overall, 2015 Priority Selection\n\nKing City Ontario native Alex Formenton of the London Knights played his minor midget hockey during the 2014-2015 season for the Mississauga Rebels. In 65 games he scored 27 goals and 28 assists. The Knights would select him in the 11th round, 216th overall at the 2015 Ontario Hockey League Priority Selection. But don’t let that selection cloud your judgement. He was a tiny winger who had a huge growth spirt prior to breaking onto the Knights’ roster. It would not be incorrect to call him a steal in that draft.\n\nOne season ago, Formenton played in the Ontario Junior Hockey League for Aurora Tigers. He appeared in 54 games and scored 13 goals while adding 13 assists. He would add 2 more goals in 5 playoff games for the Tigers. The OJHL is Ontario’s Junior A league.\n\nIn 64 games this season, Formenton has 16 goals and 18 assists. He can play in any situation and his skating makes him a threat on the penalty kill as well – he has one goal on the PK. His 16 goals have come on 138 shots, good for a 11.6 shooting percentage. He can also take faceoffs when called upon and is 53.3% on the dot.\n\nFormenton’s 16 goals ranks him 9th among OHL rookies in goals and his 34 points is tied for 9th.\n\nWith a September 13, 1999 birth date, Formenton is one of the youngest players in the draft class and makes the 2017 National Hockey League Draft cut off by just two days.\n\nFormenton is an excellent skater with excellent top end speed – could very well be one of the top 10 fastest skaters in the OHL. His acceleration is also top end. He finished atop the list in on-ice testing at the combine at the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game.\n\nFormenton will not shy away from the gritty part of the game. He will battle along the walls and is willing to drive to the net both with and without the puck. He possesses soft hands and can beat defenders one-on-one. He’s also learning that he can beat defenders wide with his skating and speed and is becoming more comfortable doing so. He’s also a very good forechecker using his speed to get on top of opponents quickly.\n\nFormenton creates space with his skating and his elusiveness. Once he learns that he can slow the game down at times, use his good playmaking abilities and vision, he will become more of an offensive threat.\n\nAs with all Dale Hunter coached teams, being able to play at both ends of the ice is a requirement. Formenton may be ahead of the curve there given his willingness to put the effort in his own zone as he does in the offensive zone.\n\nFormenton was ranked 24th among north American skaters on NHL Central Scouting’s mid-term rankings in January.\n\nAlex Formenton\n\nThis is the profile page of Alex Formenton at Elite Prospects"
