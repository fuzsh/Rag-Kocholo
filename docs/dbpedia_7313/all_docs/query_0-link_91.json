        "text": "Stanley Cup Semi-Finals Game 2\n\nFrom United Press International\n\nMONTREAL – Rookie John Kordic’s biggest fear about going head-to-head with the goons of the NHL is displeasing his parents.\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens defenseman, who has yet to lose a hockey fight, is basically a pacifist.\n\n“It’s nothing I love doing,” the 6-foot, 190-pound Kordic said after pummeling physical New York Ranger Mike McPhee during the Stanley Cup semifinal. “I like to hit and take the body but I don’t like fighting.\n\n“I know what people are thinking right now; that I’m just a goon. I heard (Hockey Night in Canada commentator) Dick Irvin say, ‘Well, that’s why he’s out there.’ That doesn’t make me feel good.\n\n“I’m sure my parents heard that on TV and they’ll be upset, too. I’m not worried so much about myself, more about my parents. I just wish they’d understand that this is how I’m getting my chance.\n\n“They’re European, and hockey is new to them.”\n\nKordic’s parents, Ivan and Regina, came from Yugoslavia to settle in Edmonton, Alberta, and John’s father took him to see the Canada Cup competition in 1972.\n\n“He liked it,” Kordic said. “I was nine, so I started late. He just liked what he saw.”\n\nWhat Kordic didn’t see, in fast-flowing international competition, was fighting.\n\n“I never fought until junior,” Kordic said. “I was fat, up to Grade 4, I didn’t know any English. They called me ‘DP,’ for Deported Person. I always got beat up, I was always scared.”\n\nWhat scares Kordic now is that the Canadiens won’t give the hockey player a chance to surpass the fighter.\n\n“I know why I’m here,” he said. “I just turned 21, and I’ll pay my dues, but I wouldn’t mind playing a little more. I know it’s not going to happen this year, they’re going with the guys who got them here.”\n\nThe problem for Kordic–not to mention his victims–is that his punches are what got him here. Kordic’s flying fists and immovable body have a way of making intimidators think twice about slashing Montreal’s fleet center Guy Carbonneau or running at goalie Patrick Roy a second time.\n\nSlashing Carbonneau’s face was McPhee’s ticket to an introduction to Kordic. Immediately after Carbonneau left the ice for stitches to his gored chin, Montreal coach Jean Perron sent Kordic on the ice.\n\n“He just told me to go out there,” Kordic said. “He didn’t tell me anything but I don’t need to be led to water.\n\n“I gave McPhee a shove and said, ‘Keep your stick down.’ He gave me a slash and said ‘Let’s go.’ Later, when I was in the penalty box, he came over to me again and told me we weren’t finished yet and called me a few four-letter words and I thought ‘Geez, I don’t know why he’d want to go on with it,”‘ Kordic said, amazement showing in his eyes. “I thought, ‘Either this guy is very intense or he’s forgetting what’s going on.’\n\n“I didn’t want to have to remind him again. I didn’t want to have to do it the first time but . . . he slashed Carbo and Carbo’s one of our main players. It wasn’t fun but maybe it got our guys a little excited.”\n\nAbsolutely. Immediately after Kordic made McPhee look like a punching bag, the Canadiens scored again and ended up with a four-goal second period, capped by Carbonneau’s second goal, short-handed and unassisted.\n\n“I was just scared I broke my jaw,” Carbonneau said. “I’m not happy John did it, but it’s good to know people care for you.”\n\nApparently that’s something Kordic hears often from his teammates.\n\n“Guys on this team come up to me all the time and say, ‘What you do–well, I’d never be able to do your job.’ They appreciate what I do though and make me feel wanted.\n\n“I’ve talked to Chris Nilan (Montreal’s other enforcer, a veteran who plays a regular shift on Carbonneau’s checking line). I was sitting down on the bench once and I was discouraged, not playing. I asked him: ‘Chris, did you start out this way?’ He’d tell me he used to just sit on the bench never knowing when he was going to play. He told me to keep my head up. He’s probably not aware of it, but he really keeps my spirits up because no one else in the world would know better how I feel.”\n\nNilan knows, not only because he’s had Montreal’s enforcer role for so long, but also because he’s had the same view of it; the same pressure from parents who drove to minor league games only to see him be thrown out for fighting.\n\n“I understand it from the viewpoint that that’s how I came into the league,” Nilan said, “how I got my chance to play hockey. I know it’s what got me here and you shouldn’t forget what brought your game out. I fight but I don’t like it. Some guys in this league like it, I don’t. I know anybody looking at my penalty minutes (274 season, 1699 career) would have a hard time believing that, but I don’t like to fight. I do it because it’s part of my job.\n\n“I like John. I don’t think it’s an enviable position for anybody. When you have to do it, sometimes it’s lonely. He definitely has the tools to develop into a much better hockey player. He’s big and strong, he can shoot the puck, he can skate OK, he’s a natural defenseman,” the right winger added. “If he works hard on all those things, he can improve. But the way I look at it, he can get that chance by the physical part of his game; he has to be there. It’s not fun, but if a guy like John wants to make it…”\n\nKordic badly wants to make it as a defenseman, and is willing to go Nilan’s fighter turned complete player route, but not remain solely an enforcer.\n\n“If I have to keep doing this, I’ll probably quit, go back to school,” Kordic said. “I wouldn’t mind being a police officer or a fireman, it’s something different every day.”\n\nThat, Nilan says, Kordic will have to decide soon in order to endure the wait and work required to play a regular role for the Canadiens.\n\n“His parents are against it,” Nilan said. “But he’s a big boy, and he’s got to be able to say, ‘What do I want to do?’ I tell him you’ve got to put things in perspective and say, ‘Do I want to be a hockey player, do I want to be in the league for 10 years, or do I want to start another career?’ ”\n\nKordic’s father had wanted John to go to University of Alberta at Edmonton, like his sister Tony, who played for Canada’s 1984 Olympic women’s basketball team.\n\nInstead, Kordic went to the Portland (Ore.) Winter Hawks of the junior Western Hockey League, where the Canadiens discovered him–after he discovered his fists.\n\n“When I got in junior, I got in a fight and he was supposed to be a really tough guy,” Kordic said of Troy Loney, now with the Pittsburgh Penguins. “I never thought I was fighting out of fear. But I got a bad temper, eh? So I beat him. I didn’t find him so tough. I won a few fights after that, and Montreal drafted me because I was tough. But by my second year, I didn’t have to fight as much because I got my respect, so I had a chance to play my game and work on my hockey.”\n\nWhen Kordic did return to Edmonton, it was not to attend the University, but as a Montreal Canadien facing the mighty Edmonton Oilers–and his first NHL fight.\n\n“Against Kevin McClelland, on my first pro shift,” Kordic said, smiling. “I’m from Edmonton, I’ve seen him fight a lot of times. My friends work for the Oilers, one’s a stick boy. They told Kevin McClelland, ‘Kordic’s coming to town and he’s going to fight you,’ and they tell me, ‘Kevin McClelland wants to fight you,’ so the fight was set before the game, it was a pre-set fight but we didn’t know it. They were even building it up on the radio in Edmonton.\n\n“My dad liked it–that one time he did–my sister and brother were cheering…”\n\nKordic smiles when he tells the story. He has a great smile that reaches his eyes and comes often but for no other fighting story.\n\nYet, if he doesn’t enjoy the fighting, he clearly likes his superiority at it.\n\n“If I’m going to fight, I want to win,” Kordic said, giving the impression that physical pain is not the issue. “Have I ever lost? No, I never had a busted nose or anything like that. I’ve heard people say here and there a fight that I was in was pretty even. Every lopsided fight I’ve ever been in, though, I’ve totally won. I can’t say I’ve ever been beat like that or heard anybody say I was. If you find one, I’d like to talk to him.”\n\nNot many NHL players should be rushing.\n\nThe following are articles associated with the ‘day after’ Tie’s epic tilt with Bob Probert.\n\nFirst the Video (Detroit Feed)\n\nRangers Feed\n\nFrom Tie’s Video “What It Takes” with commentary by Tie, Bob, Don Cherry\n\nWith Head Shaved And Fists Cocked, Domi Finds Trouble\n\nBy FILIP BONDY\n\nPublished: March 9, 1992\n\nGoon.\n\nThere it was, that word. Coming from Bob Probert, of all people, wayward enforcer for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\n“He’s a goon,” Probert had said, after the big fight at Madison Square Garden last month. “He’s out there for one reason. He’s a dummy.”\n\nThe words wounded Tahir Domi, son of an Albanian restaurateur, proponent of the hard-knuckles, soft-rules school of ice hockey. The Ranger forward, nicknamed Tie long ago in elementary school, could not believe that Probert, one of his heroes, a heavyweight much like himself, would say such a thing.\n\n“That bothered me,” Domi said. “He’s been heavyweight champ for a long time. I still respect him. I’d been wanting him for three years. I just hope he remembered what got him where he is.”\n\nDomi will never forget what got him from Belle River, Ontario, all the way to a Ranger team that is ready — labor relations and springtime hexes aside — to challenge for the Stanley Cup. Domi’s edge, the asset that transformed him from lightweight pug to National Hockey League heavyweight, is his head.\n\nNot the inside, where Domi’s nimble brain works overtime figuring out which of his elaborate superstitions needs updating.\n\nThe outside.\n\nThe big skull. Shaved by his brother, Dash, “down to the wood.” Adorned with as little hair as possible, to give Domi what he calls “kind of a unique look.”\n\n“I’m fortunate my parents put me on this earth with a hard head,” Domi said. “I’ve got short arms, so I’ve got to take a lot of punches before I sort of work my way in there.”\n\nDomi pokes this skull of his where it is not welcome. He is in the face of Probert, in the face and fists of Mick Vukota of the Islanders. He is jabbing and jabbering. That is his job. In itself, that would not offend those in the National Hockey League who long ago accepted, even embraced, the morality of violent intimidation.\n\nWhat bothers Probert, and the others, is something else entirely. For Domi, this rumbling is not only a way to eke out a living. He has gone beyond that, beyond the 229 penalty minutes, beyond professionalism. Tie Domi, uppercuts flying, helmet spinning, manic grin on his unshaven mug, revels in the warfare. At times, he appears to be a madman in a mad sport, which makes a lot of people squeamish.\n\nThere is the way he goes hunting for trouble, even where there is none to be found. Domi chased after the United States Olympic team during a gentlemanly exhibition match at the Garden. At one point, he challenged David Quinn, who is a hemophiliac, to a fight with a slight smack to the cheek. He could not stop treating this game, any game, as if it were the seventh game of the Stanley Cup final.\n\nThere is the way Domi has celebrated after his fights and his two goals this season. He has spun his fingers, like Hulk Hogan, toward one side of the rink and then toward another. He has donned an imaginary heavyweight title belt. He has banged away at a speedbag, suspended somewhere above center ice where only Domi could see it. And after his two goals this season, Tie Domi has ridden his stick over the ice like a witch on midnight prowl.\n\nThe stick shtick, he says, will go. Maybe.\n\n“Nobody told me to stop, I just decided, I think,” said Domi, who borrowed that routine from his hero, the legendary bruiser Tiger Williams of Toronto. “If it’s a big goal in the playoffs, who knows? The speedbag, that’s my trademark. That’s got to stay.”\n\nPeople have stood up and noticed. At the Garden, fans groan audibly when Domi is scratched from the lineup, which still happens about every other game when Joe Kocur is healthy. Domi, with his big black shoulder pads and cartoon mannerisms, is a folk hero in the blue-turned- teal seats.\n\nPart of the allure, no doubt, is his size. At 5 feet 10 inches, tops, Domi can never be typecast as a bully.\n\n“It’s an advantage I have,” Domi said. “If I beat the other guy, he looks bad. I’m expected to lose.”\n\nAccording to Domi, he has not lost yet. Other judges have awarded Probert and Vukota their fights on points. Do not suggest this to Domi.\n\n“I read where I was supposed to have lost to Vukota,” Domi said. “He didn’t hit me once. My shirt went up. I don’t even consider him a featherweight. He’s just a wrestler.”\n\n“Probert?” Domi said. “I’m not scared of anyone, no matter how big. I can’t be intimidated.”\n\nSince every team in the N.H.L. has an enforcer, every team needs one. That is the logic of the league. Kocur and Domi are the Rangers’ two runaway libidos. They will continue to alternate for the rest of the season, unless the Rangers are playing a team with two bad guys. Then, the Rangers will need both their blue meanies.\n\nKocur, a close friend of Probert, is also an adviser to Domi. The two Rangers often hold sparring sessions at the team’s practices, but they are clearly at different stages of their careers. Domi is trying to gain respect, to promote dread in opponents who sneer at him. Kocur, still feared for his jawbreaking punch, would prefer to avoid confrontation these days. His wounded right fist has smashed into too many helmets.\n\nDomi, the pit bull on ice, is a poodle mascot in the locker room. He is everybody’s little brother. Mark Hardy, James Patrick, Mark Messier take care of him.\n\n“Thanks, big brother,” Domi will say, at the tiniest bit of advice.\n\n“If I’m his big brother, I did a great job, huh?” Hardy will say.\n\nTo his teammates, Domi is an endless source of amusement. They watch him, shake their heads at his practice rituals, at his pranks and boasts. The team is part of his extended family now, like the relatives from Albania and in-laws from Yugoslavia that his father, Islam, and mother, Meryem, helped to settle in Canada.\n\nDomi’s father died last year. This past summer, Domi broke off an engagement with a woman back in Toronto, in part because his teammates advised him he was too young to settle down. “They were right,” he said. “I mean, I’m in New York. What was I thinking?”\n\nNow the 22-year-old eligible bachelor’s most important dates are with the front teeth of opponents.\n\n“Tie is Tie,” said Adam Graves, who rooms with Domi in Port Chester, N.Y. “I knew him when we were both in the Ontario Hockey League, when he already had a reputation. He was just always more aggressive than everybody else. You’ve got to respect him for what he is.”\n\nThere was a time, in Junior A hockey, when Domi was considered a scorer, not a fighter. Later on, he could still skate, but his stickhandling and shooting skills were purely minor league. He had to transform himself into something else, something scrappier and scarier.\n\nRangers General Manager Neil Smith saw Domi playing for Peterborough, Ontario, and remembered to remember him. In June 1990, Smith acquired Domi in a trade from Toronto along with Mark Laforest in exchange for Greg Johnston.\n\n“Nobody at that point took him seriously,” Smith said. “But I always try to make a list of tough guys with skills good enough to play in the league. The toughest guy in junior hockey can be as effective sometimes as a skill player.”\n\nHe battles to stay under control, to contribute with some clean forechecking and an occasional streak down the right wing. He does not use his stick to carry out vendettas, as some players do.\n\nThere is a thin line between intimidation and stupid penalties, and Domi has been trying to cross it fewer times lately. He did so against the Islanders at Nassau Coliseum on Feb. 20, when he went into the penalty box twice while the Islanders’ lead grew from 2-1 to 5-1.\n\nHe did it again on Saturday at Philadelphia, when he was whistled for interference against Rod Brind’Amour, and Philadelphia scored a go-ahead goal on the power play. But he baited Flyer bully Dave Brown into a roughing penalty in the third period, and skated away from trouble.\n\n“They’re going to blow a much tighter whistle with Tie than with the other players,” Smith said. “It’s human nature to keep an eye on the young, wild players. But Tie can’t change. His game is to make the other team watch out.”\n\nWhen he is at his most effective, Domi will shove a more valuable opponent off his game, then take him to the penalty box for coincidental majors. The man that Domi really wants to take with him is Probert, when the two meet again on March 20. The last time they warred, it was a battle to remember.\n\nIt started with Probert calling Domi “dummy,” three times, outside the face-off circle. Domi was afraid Probert would skate away when he dropped his gloves, making him look stupid. He lurched at his antagonist. Probert landed some punches and pulled Domi up, away from the ice. Domi struck back, despite an injured right arm, cutting Probert for four stitches above the eye.\n\nLast week, Domi wanted to know whether he would get a second shot at Probert, on March 20. Neilson told him he would.\n\n“I’ll be there in Detroit,” Domi said.\n\nFor the heavyweight championship of something.\n\nFit to be Tie\n\nby Eric Adelson\n\nESPN The Magazine (2001)\n\nWhat makes Tie Domi tick? The thrill of the fight.\n\nJust ask Domi’s old nemesis, Bob Probert. The two met way back in 1989-90, when Probert stood unchallenged as the league’s best fighter. Domi, in his first NHL game as a Maple Leaf, dropped the gloves with Red Wings Joey Kocur and Kevin McClelland. Then Domi, who’s charitably listed at 5’10”, skated over to the 6’3″ Probert. “I want a shot at the title!” he yelled.\n\nProbert laughed, returned to the bench and thought, “Who is this guy?”\n\nA rivalry was born. Domi got dealt to the Rangers, paid his dues and bided his time, waiting to battle Probert. Finally, in 1992, the two dropped the gloves in Madison Square Garden.\n\nProbert did not expect Domi, who is ambidextrous, to come at him from the left. “I’m more powerful with the right,” Domi says, “But quicker with the left.” Domi opened a cut over Probert’s left eye. The referees stepped in, and Domi skated away grinning. Before he left the ice, Domi strapped an imaginary championship belt around his waist. The crowd at MSG roared.\n\nAnd, despite warnings from the NHL, Probert and Domi met again just months later. That night, Probert took his first shift just after the opening face-off. The Garden crowd began to rumble. Domi then felt a tap at his shoulder. Before the next face-off, Domi lined up beside Probert. “Well,” Probert shouted over the din. “Let’s get it over with.”\n\nThat was almost 10 years ago. Probert, 36, rarely does battle anymore. Most of the time, he’d rather not bother. “As you get older, you lose a little bit of that fight,” says Probert, now with the Blackhawks. “It becomes more of a job.”\n\nAnd it can also become more of a humiliation. No hockey player grows up dreaming of penalty minutes. And no matter how much triumph fighting can bring, no hockey player wants to be considered a goon. “Sometimes you want to play the game,” Probert says, “and you don’t want to be sitting in the penalty box.” But enforcers who try to change their stripes usually don’t last. As noted hockey hothead Don Cherry likes to say, “A crusher who becomes a rusher soon becomes an usher.”\n\nSo it’s no coincidence that quite a few fighters retire early, or even give themselves over to drugs. Probert’s cocaine problems came at the height of his career — when he was arguably the league’s second-most-popular player (after Wayne Gretzky). Probert fought his way back from drug abuse, but never fought with the same passion again.\n\nDomi, who turns 32 on November 1, is different. He has never had a drinking problem. He has never been in trouble with the law. He has a wife and three children. He is heavily involved in the Toronto community. Put simply, he still gets his fix with his fists. “I still like doing it,” he says over oatmeal at the Toronto Westin. “I still get that itch. And the day I don’t is the day I’m hangin’ ’em up.”\n\nThing is, Domi is the only enforcer in the league — including Probert — who could stop dropping the gloves and still earn a place on his team. He is one of the fastest skaters on the Maple Leafs, and his scoring output has inched up steadily since he returned to Toronto in 1995. Domi does not feel like he has to injure in order to eat. But even after getting vilified (and suspended) for knocking out New Jersey defenseman Scott Niedermayer in last spring’s Eastern Conference semis, Domi won’t change a thing. He simply doesn’t want to. “I brought [my reputation] upon myself,” he says, “and I don’t mind at all. Nobody can take that away from me.”\n\nSo what happened in Probert vs. Domi II? Domi explains it this way: “It looked like he hit me and I went down. But I was just tired.” After the tussle, Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman stood up on the Detroit bench and strapped on that imaginary belt, in Probert’s behalf.\n\nA decade later, Tie Domi is the last old-school enforcer standing.\n\nRangers and Red Wings In a Tie on Brawl Way\n\nBy JOE LAPOINTE\n\nPublished: Monday, February 10, 1992\n\nThis wasn’t free-flowing, fight-free, Olympic-style hockey last night at Madison Square Garden. Despite the match of two good first-place teams, it wasn’t even the honestly rugged style of the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nAt times, it seemed as if the Rangers and the Red Wings should have taken off the skates, left through the back door and continued in the alley using broken broom handles for sticks, crushed tin cans for pucks and clenched fists as instruments of debate. The ice on the pavement couldn’t have been any worse than that inside the building, and the behavior of the street people on Eighth Avenue couldn’t have been more ornery than that of the players.\n\nWhen it was over, more than three hours after it began, both teams had to settle for a 5-5 tie, no more and no less than either deserved, before a roaring, sellout crowd of 18,200.\n\nIn addition, there were these developments: One Detroit player and his coach faced suspension; Mike Gartner of the Rangers tied a prestigious record; 10 players scored, three of them while their team was shorthanded; four players were ejected, and Tie Domi had opened the Garden’s annual dog show a day early by playing pit bull to big Bob Probert’s Doberman in one of those classic hockey fights that everyone both loves to hate and hates to love.\n\nBryan Murray, coach and general manager of the Red Wings, said, “It was a dirty hockey game.”\n\nThe Red Wings’ Probert said about Domi: “He’s a goon. I’ll get that little dummy back in Detroit.”\n\nDomi said about Probert: “Funny that he keeps calling me ‘dummy, dummy, dummy.’ He’s not known to be a rocket scientist.”\n\nThe Rangers led, 3-2, after one period and the score was tied, 5-5, after two. Adam Graves and Mark Messier scored while New York was short-handed. Darren Turcotte scored on the power play. Brian Leetch and Gartner scored at even strength. It was Gartner’s 13th consecutive season with at least 30 goals, tying him with Bobby Hull and Phil Esposito for that record.\n\nFor Detroit, Steve Yzerman, Keith Primeau and Sheldon Kennedy scored while Detroit was at even strength. Ray Sheppard scored a power-play goal and Bobby Dollas scored a short-handed one.\n\nBoth teams complained about the chippy ice and many had much to say about the chippy play in the first two periods, a style that dominated the mood of the game. Meanwhile, Yves Racine of Detroit faces a 10-game suspension for leaving the penalty box to join a multiplayer brawl.\n\n“I just lost it,” he said.\n\nN.H.L. rules say the coach of a player who does that is suspended for five games and fined $1,000.\n\nThe main event featured Domi, who is generously listed at 5-foot-10 and 195 pounds, and Probert, who is 6-3 and 215. Domi said he took it upon himself to fight Probert midway through the first period after Probert had checked several Rangers with body and stick.\n\nDespite not using an injured right arm, Domi opened a four-stitch cut over Probert’s right eye. Probert punched Domi’s helmet from his head and landed several blows that seemed to stagger Domi. At one point during the fight, Domi seemed headed for the ice, a situation that always results in officials breaking up the battle. Probert seemed to hold him up so that the bout could continue.\n\nSeveral other players paired off in two different incidents. Ejected were Steve Chiasson, Gerard Gallant and Racine of Detroit and Joe Cirella of the Rangers.\n\n“I don’t know if I won, but I showed up,” Domi said. “Probert has been heavyweight champ a long time. I like long fights. The longer I go, the better I get. I wasn’t stunned, not one bit. When I saw the blood on his face, I was kind of happy. I heard the fans going crazy when I was fighting and that kept me going.”\n\nMurray wasn’t happy with the way Ranger coach Roger Neilson used Domi. Later, Domi baited Probert again so that both went off together with 10-minute misconducts.\n\n“I understand why Al Arbour has a hard time with Roger,” Murray said.\n\nBoth teams have many players who have played for both sides. Long after the game, they lingered in the corridor, socializing with the enemy. They meet only once more, on March 20, unless both reach the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nPreface: I wrote this, as my very first blog post back in 2011. Even in the 4 short years since then (i’m editing this as of Sept. 2020 – so now it’s been 9 years! My how time flies.), & much has changed on the Hockey Fight landscape. I’ve tidied this post up a bit (again), and updated part of it (again), otherwise, here is my annual Prospect Tournament Post on the all-time toughest players/best fighters to attend this tournament.\n\nA Brief History\n\nI have (had) been attending the NHL Prospects Tournament in Traverse City, Michigan Off & On for the past 15 years. The tournament began in the 1998-99 NHL Season, and served as an opportunity for NHL teams to get an early look at their June NHL Entry Draft picks, young undrafted free agent invitees, as well as other prospects already drafted or within their respective minor league systems.\n\nBelow is a list of teams that have participated in past tournaments. An * indicates the teams scheduled for the 2015-16 tournament.\n\nDetroit*\n\nColumbus*\n\nSt Louis*\n\nChicago*\n\nNashville\n\nWashington\n\nMinnesota*\n\nNew York Rangers* Dallas* Atlanta Carolina*\n\nPresent\n\nI recently read a blog listing the top NHL players to have played in this annual tournament (http://www.theleftwinglock.com/2011/08/03/nhl-prospect-tournament-all-history-team/), prompting me to immediately think about not only the best NHL players I’ve seen play, or to have made their debut at the Centre Ice Arena (http://www.centreice.org/page/show/483955-nhl-prospect-tournament), but rather the toughest. I have been a fan of hockey fights and the players who have performed that role for as long as I can remember, and found categorizing these players to be much more near and dear to my heart. It’s a shame that today’s game seems to be trying to phase this aspect out of today’s NHL.\n\nThe List\n\nSome of the names you will immediately recognize, while others might be a bit more of a mystery to you (youtube them). I created this list from memory, although I have every tournament program from the years I attended, which would have greatly helped me finalize my list, but I was so excited to get this going, that I am ‘changing on the fly as they say down on the ice. Without further adieu, here is my list of the top 50+ toughest players/best fighters to ever attend the NHL Prospects Tournament in Traverse City, MI.\n\n(The team listed is the team they played for during the tournament.)\n\nThe Top Ten\n\n1. Derek Boogaard – The former Minnesota Wild and New York Ranger recently passed away this past season at the tender age of 28. Derek was drafted 202nd overall during the 2001 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild. He played 3 seasons in the minor leagues prior to playing the next 5 in the NHL, for the Wild, where he became an instant fan favorite. Considered one of the best fighters ever to lace them up, he signed as a free agent with the New York Rangers just prior to the 2010-11 season starting. He ended up playing 22 games for the Rangers before complications from a fight with Matt Carkner ended his season. Other ongoing problems from the condition kept him out of the lineup. Derek Boogaard died at his Minnesota apartment on May 13, 2011 from a lethal mixture of oxycodone and alcohol. I will personally never forget Derek smashing through the glass at his first tournament. The footage was shot by a buddy and myself and was submitted to ESPN who showed the footage during their “10 Most Smashing NHL Moments” countdown around 2003-04.\n\n2. Brian McGrattan – DET – For a team that rarely gives any sort of toughness a second look these days, the Red Wings had invited, then free agent, Brian McGrattan to Traverse City for a looksie after he remained unsigned by the Los Angeles Kings (the team who drafted him in 1999). While he never played a game for the Red Wings, Brian’s rambunctious, physical, and aggressive style would get him noticed by other NHL teams looking to add toughness to their roster. McGrattan, or Big Ern as he’s affectionately known by, would go on to play for the Ottawa Senators in a full time role from 2005-08. He also suited up for the NHL’s Calgary Flames, Nashville Predators, and the Phoenix Coyotes.\n\n3. Mike Sgroi – DET – While Mike Sgroi may not be a household NHL name to most people, anyone that follows the minor league circuit will know Mike was a very active ECHL & AHL brawler who has donned the shirt of many minor league teams. Mike is also dabbled in MMA fighting when he wasn’t playing hockey. Another very tough competitor who got his start in Traverse City, and another fighter who somehow got his start from playing college and then the Detroit Red Wings inviting him to Traverse City in 1999 as a free agent. Mike suited up for 2 games last year (2014-15) with the ECHL’s Orlando Solar Bears. I had no idea who he was until he took on long time NHLer Darcy Hordichuk at center ice during the 2000 tournament. Mike was also fortunate enough to play 1 preseason game with the Red Wings that year as well.\n\n4. D.J. King – StL – Another tough Western League kid who got his start at the Traverse City Tournament is former NHLer D.J. King. DJ last played for the Washington Capitals during the 2010 & 2011 NHL season, after being traded by St. Louis, the team who drafted him, in 2009-10 season. D.J. would go on to play 118 regular season games in the NHL, amassing 215 penalty minutes before retiring from hockey in 2012-13.\n\n5. Tim Spencer – STL – Tim Spencer is probably another non-household name, but Tim is making a name for himself as he climbs the minor league ranks. He has shown that he has what it takes to play the physical game at the lower levels, and now needs a chance from someone to show what he can do in the show. The tough forward finally got a break last season, when Washington dressed him for a preseason game. Tim has bounced around playing in North America & across the pond. Hopefully an NHL team will give him another shot in the near future as he is a tough, exciting, skilled fighter looking for a break. His recent fights with minor league legend Jon Mirasty are worth youtubing. Tim is still lacing them up in the AHL.\n\n6. Graham Belak – STL – The younger brother of former NHLer Wade Belak, Grahm was a free agent invitee by the St. Louis Blues. Graham played roughly six years of professional hockey, at the minor league level in North America and overseas, prior to hanging up the blades after the 2005-06 season. Not the pugilistic force Wade was, but no walkover either. Cut his teeth in the WHL, and usually fared well in his tilts.\n\n7. Matt Kassian – MIN – Minnesota Wild prospect Matt Kassian had been waiting for his call from the current club for the better part of 4 seasons when he finally got his shot during the 2010-11 season. Kass played 4 games for the Wild that year and fought another Tournament alumni, Jared Boll of the Columbus Blue Jackets. He also fought veteran Jody Shelley that year. Matt was later signed by the Ottawa Senators, playing two seasons there, before falling victim to the ‘blackballing’ of enforcers put forth by the NHL (or so it would seem). Matt played a total 76 regular season NHL games in 4 partial seasons. Considered one of the top WHL fighters during his time there.\n\n8. Trevor Ettinger – CLB – Another tragic story among the enforcer brotherhood is former QMJHL enforcer, & Columbus Blue Jacket prospect Trevor Ettinger. Trevor was drafted by Edmonton in the 1998 NHL entry draft. He was a free agent invitee to the tournament, by Columbus in 1999, where he made enough of an impression, that he was signed by the Blue Jackets, and sent to their ECHL affiliate in Dayton for some professional seasoning. Trevor kicked around Syracuse in the AHL as well before he took his own life on July 26th, 2003. He finished his last professional season with the Syracuse Crunch in the AHL during the 2002-03 season. A tough customer who was fondly remembered by the fans who he grew close with during his time in major junior & professional hockey.\n\n9. Raitis Ivanans – DET – Another former NHL tough guy who got his start by accepting a free agent invitation from the Detroit Red Wings to the Traverse City Prospects Tournament. Raitis has spent time with Montreal, Los Angeles and Calgary during his NHL career. His season was cut short during the 2010-11 season, after just one game, when he suffered a concussion during a fight with Edmonton’s Steve MacIntyre. The big Latvian has played 282 NHL games during his 14 year professional career.\n\n10. Riley Emmerson – MIN – After Derek Boogaard became a household name in Minnesota, the Wild thought they got his twin brother (at least stature wise) when they took big Riley Emmerson 199th overall during the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Emmerson, who stands 6-8, 248 lbs has paid his dues playing in the various North American & European leagues the past several seasons. Another big time enforcer from the WHL.\n\nSo many more names to mention:\n\nIn making a list like this, you’re always going to leave someone out. I tried to go with pure heavyweights, and the impact they had in those roles on various teams through the years. As much as I like Darcy Hordichuk, I decided to leave him off. However, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention players like him who also appeared in Traverse City. So, with that, here are 10 more names you probably know who may have been overlooked in our list.\n\nDarcy Hordichuk – ATL – Former NHLer, has played 11 seasons in the NHL. His first professional fight was against Mike Sgroi, at the Traverse City tournament. The veteran winger has played 542 games in the NHL and piled up over 1,100 penalty minutes. Darcy played his 13th NHL season with the Edmonton Oilers in 2012 before hanging them up in 2013.\n\nJosh Gratton – ATL – Gratton played a total of 86 games in the NHL, while amassing 294 Penalty Minutes for Phoenix and the Philadelphia Flyers. If you’re bored, youtube Gratton Vs Colton Orr AHL, for the one of the best hockey fights you will ever see. Update – Josh was a late season signee for the Manchester Monarchs of the AHL in 2015, where he helped bring a Calder Cup championship to that team, the 2nd of his career.\n\nJay Rosehill – TB – Jay got his big break with the Toronto Maple Leafs the last two seasons playing in 41 games for Brian Burke’s Leafs. Never one to shy away from the rough stuff, Rosehill would find himself riding shotgun for Colton Orr while with the Leafs, and more recently with the Philadelphia Flyers. Update – Jay played the 2014-15 season for the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the AHL.\n\nAnthony Peluso – StL – Another young toughie in the countdown, Peluso was considered a heavy puncher during his time in the OHL. The Blues agreed and took him 160th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. He’s been doing his time in the Blues minor league system, but I have a feeling Anthony is getting close to making his debut in the show. A good leader, he needs to continue to improve on his hockey skills if he’s to make the jump to the NHL. Update – Anthony has played sparingly the last 3 seasons for the Winnipeg Jets, having now played 117 NHL games.\n\nJared Boll – CLB – Jared Boll, a former Plymouth Whaler, has racked up 1134 PIMs during his 488 NHL games played, while amassing fight totals of 26, 24, 26, and 33 in each of his 4 years of service with the Columbus Blue Jackets. His 33 in 2007-08 lead all NHL scrappers that season. Jared continues to flank the wing for the Blue Jackets as he enters his 9th NHL season.\n\nLuke Gazdic – DAL -Like Anthony Peluso, Luke Gazdic has got a chance to play in the “New NHL” with the Edmonton Oilers. During his time in the OHL, he & Peluso were considered two of the, if not the two toughest kids in the league. I was fortunate to watch them both play in that league, as well as making names for themselves in Traverse City. Luke has now played over 100 games in the NHL, quite a feat in today’s league.\n\nDylan McIlrath – NYR – A first round draft Pick by the Rangers in 2010, McIlrath was selected 10th overall. The Rangers have big plans for the tough rearguard to play a more complete game, and become the physical stay-at-home defenseman they envisioned when they took him #10. There is no denying the toughness he brings from his time in the WHL, where he was considered one of the top fighters over his time there. Update – Dylan got another shot last year playing 1 game for the Broadway Blue Shirts, but the clock is ticking on his prospect status, and the game changing the way it has, hasn’t done him any favors. This kid would have played 10+ seasons, had he started his career in 1991 instead of 2011.\n\nTom Sestito – CLB – Another former Plymouth Whaler who got an opportunity to play in the show. Tom was drafted in the 3rd Round, 85th overall in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, by Columbus. Sestito has played 137 NHL games for Vancouver & Philadelphia. Update – Tom has signed a PTO with the Pittsburgh Penguins for the 2015-16 season.\n\nMatt Walker – StL – The former NHLer played 314 games in the NHL before retiring after the 2011-12 season.\n\nBrandon Mashinter – CLB – Mashinter got his call last season with the San Jose Sharks, playing in a total of 13 NHL games. We hope Brandon can become a regular fixture in the current NHL. The big physical winger has improved his hockey skills while in the AHL, but is still a force when the gloves come off. Update – Brandon played in the AHL for the 2014-15 season.\n\nJosh Caron – MIN – Josh Caron turned heads by having a very impressive rookie tournament in 2010. He took on all comers and never once looked overmatched. Minnesota signed him immediately following his free agent tryout in Traverse City. Josh played defense in the WHL, but may have to make the switch to wing if he is to ever see the ice surface at an NHL arena. Update -We’re not sure of Josh’s current status, but according to http://www.hockeydb.com, he last suited up in 2013-14 for the Iowa Wild.\n\nBrett Ponich – STL – Another huge defenseman, Ponich was selected 48th overall by St Louis in the 2009 NHL entry draft. Ponich displays excellent fighting skills to go along with his giant frame. Look for Ponich to develop in the same mold as a poor man’s Hal Gill, or Braydon Coburn, but with much more of a mean streak, and much better pugilistic skills. Update – Brett has yet to get a game in the show, splitting the 2014-15 season between the ECHL & AHL.\n\nThe Best Of The Rest:\n\n(In no particular order)\n\nDave Kaczowka – ATL\n\nBill Kinkel – MIN\n\nKyle Neuber – CLB\n\nCody Sol – ATL\n\nBrett Scheffelmaier – StL\n\nJeff Feniak – DET Jeff Smith – NAS\n\nBrad Voth – StL\n\nMatt Suderman – ATL\n\nJevon Desautels – WAS/DET\n\nNate Kiser – DET\n\nLane Manson – ATL\n\nPatrick Wellar – StL\n\nBrandon Elliott – TB\n\nMyles Stoesz – ATL\n\nRobin Big Snake – DET\n\nRandy Ponte – NAS\n\nRyan Stokes – MIN\n\nGuillaume Desbiens – ATL\n\nJordin TooToo – NAS\n\nSean Avery – DET\n\nLouis Robitaille – WAS\n\nDarryl Bootland – DET\n\nDavid Jarram – DET\n\nDannick Paquette – ATL\n\nMitchell Callahan – DET\n\nDevin Didiomete – CLB\n\nKody Musselman – CLB\n\nNick Tarnasky – TB\n\nTy Jones – CHI\n\nRyan Graham – MIN\n\nScott Hartnell – NAS\n\nJustin Falk – MIN\n\nEric Gooldy – NAS\n\nMike Berube – NYR\n\nLibor Ustrnul – ATL\n\nJamie Benn – DAL\n\nSteven Delisle – CLB\n\nTeigan Zahn – TB\n\nCole Grbavac – DAL\n\nCody Beach – StL\n\nBob Gassoff Jr. – StL Matt Nickerson – DAL Tysen Dowzak – NYR Justin Soryal – NYR\n\nLeigh Salters STL Randy McNaught – NYR Adam Huxley – WAS\n\nUp & Coming (this was from my 2011-12 Preview and is now dated)\n\nZack Kassian – BUF – First Rounder 13th Overall pick by Buffalo in 2009, has the skill set to be a good power forward that many teams covet, with the ability to fight when called upon. Think Milan Lucic-lite. Update: Zack was recently traded to the Montreal Canadians for Brandon Prust, for the upcoming 2015-16 season. He has played in 198 NHL games while amassing 307 PIMs, prior to this upcoming season.\n\nMaxime Villemaire – StL – Maxime is free agent invitee by the Blues, and should be looking for some fight action come September in Traverse City. Update: Max now plays in the rough and tumble LNAH Quebec Professional Hockey League.\n\nBrenden Dillon – DAL – A tough defenseman is looking to turn pro for 2011. A free agent invitee who will also be looking for attention in Traverse City. Played the last 4 seasons for Seattle in the Western Hockey League. Update: Dillon has become a real steady stay at home defenseman in the NHL. He has played 209 NHL games with Dallas and San Jose.\n\nRichard Nedomlel – DET – Another tough defenseman, Nedomlel is a big Czech who the Wings think can develop into a good stay at home, physical defenseman, who will drop the gloves when needed. Selected 175th overall by the Wings this past June. Update: Nedomlel appears to have fallen off the Wings radar a bit, playing a full season for the Toledo Walleye of the ECHL. Hopefully the big defenseman continues to work his way up to the NHL.\n\nColin Jacobs – BUF – The Sabres took Jacobs 107th overall this past June, and are hoping the forward can play the pro game like the junior game. Good mix of toughness and skill. Update: Jacobs split time between Rochester of the AHL & Elmira of the ECHL during the 2014-15 season.\n\nKeegan Lowe – CAR – Son of former NHL defenseman Kevin Lowe, Keegan has shown an ability to be a physical force, and is not shy about dropping the gloves, if need be. Also brings a good hockey sense, and skill set. Selected 73rd overall by the Canes in 2011. Update: Lowe earned a 2 game NHL promotion last year, while playing full time for the Charlotte Checkers of the ECHL.\n\nVIDEOS\n\nThe first video I shot was this matcup between then unknown Mike Sgroi of Detroit, & Darcy Hordichuk of Atlanta.\n\nI would deem this as the most ‘famous’ footage from the tournament. A vicious missed-check by Derek Boogaard put him right through the glass in front of us. My friend Al, was fortunate to shoot the beginning, I recorded the end of the clip & edited it as one. Al then sent it to ESPN and it eventually showed up on their “NHL Countdown” segment, as one of the top “crashing moments in NHL history”. This was uploaded by my friend Tory, who had a website called Wild Enforcers (back in the day), and he & I always corresponded after the tournament, to get him the Minnesota Wild fights that happened. He was thrilled to see Derek Boogaard footage from there.\n\nDerek Boogaard MIN Through The Glass\n\nThe tournament was good to me that season, so once again, I packed up the camera and headed North (2002-03) for another week in the hopes of catching some more up & coming scraps. Derek Boogaard was back, which probably scared a few youngsters, but the kid that impressed me was Josh Gratton. Here he takes on former OHL foe and personal favorite Nate Kiser of Detroit.\n\nNate Kiser DET Vs Josh Gratton ATL\n\nThe highlight of the 2003-04 tournament was a 10 fight game between Washington & Atlanta. With the score out of hand, the only thing left to do was get noticed. The last few minutes took an eternity to play, and I was probably one of the few that was glad it did. That was the same season I got the opportunity to have a very lengthy conversation with former NHL linesman Leon Stickle, a very nice man who answered every question I could throw at him. I don’t see any my videos on youtube from this season, but I swear one day I will upload them all.\n\nWith the NHL lockout of 2004-05, the tournament was cancelled, but I was right back up there for the 05-06 season primer! That was the season Riley Emmerson and Matt Kassian suited up for Minnesota to terrorize the tournament. Here’s one I shot between Myles Stoesz ATL & Reid Jorgensen DET, and as you can see the camera had finally been updated for this one.\n\nMyles Stoesz ATL Vs Reid Jorgensen DET\n\nI was not able to attend the 2006-07 tournament but returned in 2007-08 and was happy to see many familiar faces in uniform. Jared Boll was there again for Columbus, Matt Kassian for Minnesota, Myles Stoesz with Atlanta, and newcomers Tim Spencer StL, Luke Gazdic DAL & Anthony Peluso StL. One of the best was this one:\n\nDavid Jarram DET Vs. Myles Stoesz ATL\n\nThe following season of 2008-09 I was pleasantly surprised to see that the NHL Network was televising a few of the games. This made my life easier, running back between the two rinks, trying to cover two games at once, with one camera was becoming tough to do. Knowing the NHL was recording one, I covered the other. Here is one of the better tilts from that year:\n\nLuke Gazdic DAL Vs Devin Didiomete CLB\n\nHere’s one I shot, from the somewhat of a lackluster tournament of 2009-10\n\nAnthony Peluso StL Vs Tim Filangieri CLB\n\nI made the trek north once again for the 2010-11 tournament and found some fresh, well, new faces. I was excited to see some of the invitees like Randy McNaught, Josh Caron, & Steven Delisle. I was even more excited when Josh Caron & Randy McNaught engaged in one of the best scraps I’ve caught from this tournament.\n\nRandy McNaught NYR Vs Josh Caron MIN\n\nI was pleased to see the NHL Network back for the 2011-12 tournament, as once again, I knew my life would be somewhat easier in covering as many games as possible. They were lucky enough to catch Randy McNaught and Cody Beach – as was I, but we’ll post their footage today.\n\nRandy McNaught NYR Vs Cody Beach STL\n\n2012-13 would once again have us miss the tournament, due to another work stoppage by the NHL. There were no prospect games, and the season didn’t begin until January that year.\n\nBy 2013-14 my life had changed enough to the point where I wasn’t available to attend the tournament any longer. Fortunately, with the advances in video streaming, and the ability to shoot great quality footage on a phone, most NHL team websites now provide highlights of their teams from the tournament. Fans are also vigilant enough to capture the odd fight, or a portion of it on their cell phones and upload them to youtube for us to view. I’m very fortunate to live where I do, and was able to take a week out of my life and drive from Detroit to Traverse City in the hopes of capturing some footage NOBODY would have seen otherwise. I got to see a young Derek Boogaard crash through the glass, and then his teammates mark his territory. I got to talk to Brian McGrattan about his future. I got to see Bob Gassoff Jr. play for his Dad’s same St Louis Blues. I’ve talked to so many current & former players, NHL/AHL/ECHL scouts, coach’s, GM’s, & officials (Two of the best conversations I had were with former NHL linesman Leon Stickle & referee Andy Van Hellemond) at these tournaments I began to feel I was in the club! Ok, obviously i’m getting a bit out of hand here. I can still remember my first tournament though, & trying to figure out how to copy the Ettinger-Belak fight my buddy shot, off a vcr tape & onto my camcorder and onto something of my buddy Al’s! Yes, we ended up shooting it off the tv, as I had packed a VCR (remember those?), a much larger camcorder than I used at my last tournament, and a pile of tapes, batteries, and cables that year. It’s true! I think I had more electronics packed than clothing. Fond memories for sure.\n\nMany of the videos I have shot from previous tournaments can be found at my youtube page: Hockey Fight History\n\nFight Statistics provided by www.hockeyfights.com, www.hockey-fights.com, and www.dropyourgloves.com\n\nHockey Statistics provided by www.hockeydb.com\n\nPhotos were obtained from google & getty images.
