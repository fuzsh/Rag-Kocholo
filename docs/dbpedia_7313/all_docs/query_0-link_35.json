        "text": "Throughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we look at the Vancouver Canucks, the Sip Advisor’s hometown and favourite squad. I’ll try my best to not show any bias!:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Canucks joined the NHL as an expansion team in 1970. Previously, minor league versions of the Canucks played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League and Western Hockey League from 1945-70. Canucks owners had bid to join the NHL for its 1967 expansion, but were denied. They also tried to have the Oakland Seals moved to Vancouver, but that was vetoed by the NHL.\n\nStanley Cups: The Canucks have not won the big one, despite appearing in three Stanley Cup Finals (1982 vs. New York Islanders, 1994 vs. New York Rangers and 2011 vs. Boston Bruins). In two of those championship series, they played to a seventh and deciding game, coming up short both times. Vancouver did win back-to-back President’s Trophies in 2011 and 2012, but the ultimate prize has always eluded the franchise.\n\nCelebrity Fan: Singer Michael Bublé is a passionate supporter of the Canucks, as the Burnaby native has been for most of his life. Bublé even has an ownership stake in the Western Hockey League Vancouver Giants junior team. Bublé is such a hockey fan, part of his concert contract rider asks each promoter to include the puck of a local team in his dressing room.\n\nSuper Fan: First appearing on December 22, 2009, the infamous Green Men – wearing full-body spandex outfits – quickly became recognizable fixtures at Canucks games. Taking their seats next to the visitor’s penalty box, the Green Men (Adam ‘Force’ Forsyth and Ryan ‘Sully’ Sullivan) would mercilessly mock those sent to the sin bin with signs and other antics. The duo was inducted into ESPN’s Hall of Fans, before retiring after the 2014-15 season.\n\nMascot: Fin the Whale was introduced on June 4, 2001. Among the orca/killer whale’s favourite things are B.C. salmon, the book Moby Dick and the movie Free Willy… not to mention arena popcorn! His least favourite team, of course, would be the defunct Hartford Whalers. While Fin is perhaps best known for his charity appearances, he also has a habit of chomping unsuspecting fan’s heads.\n\nTradition: Towel Power was born during the 1982 Campbell Conference Finals. When coach Roger Nielson grew frustrated over what he viewed to be lopsided officiating, he waived a white towel attached to a raised stick as his sign of surrender. Upon the team’s return to home ice, fans began waving towels in support of the coach and team. The Canucks won three straight, advancing to their first Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nAppearances in Media: Thanks to actress Cobie Smulders hailing from Vancouver, like her How I Met Your Mother character Robin Scherbatsky, a number of references to the Canucks occurred over the course of the sitcom’s nine seasons. These included multiple occasions where Scherbatsky is clad in a Canucks jersey, mentions players from the team and attends a Canucks-New York Rangers game.\n\nEvents/Scandal: Following their defeats in both the 1994 and 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Downtown Vancouver became engulfed in riots that destroyed property and caused numerous injuries. Thankfully, in both incidents, no deaths were reported. In the aftermath of the 2011 riot, 887 criminal charges were laid against 301 suspects, hopefully deterring future similar behaviour.\n\nRivalry: The Canucks lacked a true geographic rival until the Seattle Kraken entered the NHL in 2021. Up to that point, rivalries with fellow western Canada clubs the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers have always existed, as well as incident- and playoff-born rivalries with teams such as the New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, Chicago Blackhawks and Boston Bruins.\n\nTragedy: The Canucks franchise has been struck with tragedy on a few occasions. One of the team’s first stars, Wayne Maki, was diagnosed with brain cancer in 1972, succumbing to the disease in 1974, aged 29. Then, in 2008, defenseman Luc Bourdon was killed in a motorcycle accident at the young age of 21. Finally, forward Rick Rypien committed suicide in the 2011 off-season, after his tenure with Vancouver, but before debuting with the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: Canucks history is loaded with great nicknames. Among them: Russian Rocket (Pavel Bure), Steamer (Stan Smyl), Captain Kirk (Kirk McLean), Brockstar (Brock Boeser), King Richard (Richard Brodeur), and JovoCop (Ed Jovanovski). An underrated entry would be Cowan the Brabarian, given to Jeff Cowan after a bra was thrown on the ice following a goal from the enforcer.\n\nLine: Two Canucks lines had very successful runs as a unit. First, the West Coast Express (Markus Naslund, Todd Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison) terrorized opponents from 2002-06. The line was named after Vancouver’s commuter train line. Second, the Lotto Line (Brock Boeser, Elias Petterson and J.T. Miller) had a shorter but memorable stint together. The trio received its moniker when a Twitter user realized their numbers 6, 40 and 9, matched the local 649 lottery.\n\nCaptain: While the Canucks have had a number of memorable leaders, including Stan Smyl, Trevor Linden and Henrik Sedin, in 2008, the organization abandoned all convention, naming goalie Roberto Luongo as the team’s captain. He was the first netminder to hold such an honour since 1947-48. Luongo’s reign as team leader lasted only two seasons, before it was mutually agreed he should relinquish the role.\n\nEnforcer: Canucks history is littered with teams that couldn’t beat opponents on the scoreboard, so they just tried to beat them up. Among the franchise’s many fighters, perhaps the most beloved was – and still is – the ‘Algonquin Assassin’ Gino Odjick. Odjick holds the team record for total penalty minutes at 2,127, over eight seasons with the club. Odjick also holds five of the top 10 slots for penalty minutes in a season.\n\nFamily Values: The Canucks have a long history of family relations within the organization. This is best highlighted with the Sedin twins, who were able to come to Vancouver together thanks to the incredible draft day dealings of GM Brian Burke. The Canucks also united the Courtnall brothers – Geoff and Russ, from nearby Vancouver Island – for 13 games in the 1994-95 season.\n\nReturning Players: The trading of Trevor Linden during the 1998 Olympic break never seemed right for both the player and the organization. That was all remedied in 2001, when Linden was reacquired by the Canucks. Linden played out the rest of his career with the team, reaching 1,000 games played and points scored with the club it was meant to happen with.\n\nShort Stint: A free agent in 2008, Toronto Maple Leafs icon Mats Sundin weighed contract offers from a number of teams, while also considering retirement. The Canucks two-year, $20 million offer would have made Sundin the highest paid player in the NHL. After sitting out the start of the season, Sundin finally put pen to paper with Vancouver on December 18, 2008, being paid a prorated $5 million for the season. Sundin played 49 games combined (regular season and playoffs) with the Canucks, before retiring.\n\nUndrafted: Alex Burrows story of perseverance from undrafted to star player is inspiring. He quickly rose through the ranks of the minor leagues, joining the big league squad in January 2006 and never looked back. Originally a checker, Burrows eventually found himself on the top line, where he and the Sedins became a popular trio. Burrows was added to the Canucks Ring of Honour in 2019.\n\nTrade: Among the best moves the Canucks have made are acquiring Roberto Luongo from the Florida Panthers and stealing Markus Naslund from the Pittsburgh Penguins. Both trades are among the most lopsided in NHL history. On the flip side, dealing a young, homegrown Cam Neely to the Boston Bruins has always been lamented by Canucks fans. While the return was decent, Neely blossomed into a superstar, plus they also gave up a first-round draft pick in the transaction.\n\nSigning: There are more bad signings in Canucks history than good ones. Among the worst would be Mark Messier’s three-year, $18 million pact in 1997 and Loui Eriksson’s six-year, $36 million deal in 2016. Messier was a cancer in the Canucks locker room, while Eriksson vastly underperformed his contract, both drawing the ire of the fan base. Also, Roberto Luongo’s 12-year, $64 million resigning in 2009, eventually led to a three-year, $3 million cap recapture penalty, upon Luongo’s retirement.\n\nDraft Pick: The Canucks have never selected first overall, but have done fairly well with the number two pick, using their first ever choice in 1970 on Dale Tallon and also getting Trevor Linden (1988) and the Sedin twins (1999) at second and third. Their greatest draft steal was Pavel Bure in the sixth round, 113th overall. The Nucks drafted Bure in 1989, despite confusion over his eligibility.\n\nHoldouts: Once the team’s most popular superstar, Pavel Bure’s exit from the Canucks was ugly. Following the 1997-98 season, Bure gave new GM Brian Burke the first headache of his tenure, stating he would not play the final year of his contract. It took until January 17, 1999, for Bure (along with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference and a third-round draft pick) to be sent to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and a first-round draft pick.\n\nBuyouts: The Canucks own the largest non-compliance buyout in the NHL salary cap era, used to terminate the contract of defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson. Ekman-Larsson had joined Vancouver via trade in 2021, lasting only two seasons before his eight-year, $66 million deal was bought out with four seasons remaining. Ekman-Larsson will be paid by the Canucks $19.33 million over eight years.\n\nUnique Game: The Canucks have taken part in a number of NHL international firsts. The first regular season games played outside North America saw Vancouver and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim meet for a pair of 1997-98 season-opening contests in Tokyo, Japan. In 2017, the Canucks would play two pre-season games against the Los Angeles Kings in Shanghai and Beijing, China. These were the first NHL matches ever played in the country. Vancouver also hosted the 2014 Heritage Classic, facing the Ottawa Senators.\n\nGoal: Two Alex Burrows goals during the 2011 run to the Stanley Cup Finals are among the greatest in team history. First the ‘Slay the Dragon’ Game 7 overtime winner versus the Chicago Blackhawks finally put the Canucks past their nemesis. Later, Burrows tally mere seconds into overtime of Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals versus the Boston Bruins gave Vancouver a 2-0 series lead, causing mass hysteria across the province.\n\nFight/Brawl: When Canucks coach John Tortorella saw the Calgary Flames starting lineup flush with goons prior to a 2014 game, he knew something was up. Kellen Lain was playing his first NHL game and a receipt was due for an injury he’d caused in an earlier minor league contest. A line brawl ensued to start the game, with Lain and others ejected from the match. At intermission, Tortorella went to the Flames dressing room, trying to confront Calgary coach Bob Hartley. This resulted in a 15-day suspension for Tortorella.\n\nInjury: On February 11, 2000, Canucks enforcer Donald Brashear fought and defeated his Boston Bruins counterpart Marty McSorley. McSorley pursued a rematch, which Brashear turned down. Late in the contest, McSorley hit Brashear in the side of the head with his stick, knocking Brashear unconscious. Brashear suffered a seizure and concussion, while McSorley was suspended indefinitely, ending his career. McSorley was later convicted of assault with a weapon and sentenced to 18 months probation.\n\nPenalty: The Todd Bertuzzi-Steve Moore incident is one of hockey’s biggest black eyes. The Canucks were out for revenge after Moore had previously elbowed Canucks captain Markus Naslund, resulting in a concussion. In the midst of a blowout loss, Bertuzzi punched Moore in the back of the head, knocking him out. The resulting fall fractured three of Moore’s neck vertebrae. Criminal and civil action followed, along with Bertuzzi being suspended for the rest of the 2003-04 season and throughout the 2004-05 lockout.\n\nWildest Story: Canucks fans have long had a feeling the team is cursed, dating back to one of the team’s first official activities. To decide which of Vancouver and the Buffalo Sabres would get the first overall choice in the 1970 NHL Draft, a roulette wheel was used. NHL president Clarence Campbell declared the Canucks the winners, before it was pointed out the ball didn’t stop on number one, but 11 instead. Thus, the Sabres earned the right to select junior standout Gilbert Perreault.\n\nBlooper: In the first round of the 2002 playoffs, the surprising Canucks were up 2-0 in their series against the Presidents’ Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings. What happened next changed the entire course of the series, as Red Wings defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom launched a shot from center ice, beating Canucks goalie Dan Cloutier. Detroit won four straight games, eliminating the Canucks, en route to another Stanley Cup.\n\nMiscellaneous: Wayne Gretzky, the greatest player in NHL history, twice almost became a Canuck. In 1988, before he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, the Canucks could have had ‘The Great One’ for $25 million, Kirk McLean, Greg Adams and three first-round draft picks. A decade later, Gretzky was a free agent and had committed to signing with Vancouver, until he was pressured to put pen to paper and didn’t like the pushy approach. He ended up with the New York Rangers to finish his career.\n\nVancouver Canucks: Vancouver Canucks Cocktail\n\n1 oz Vodka\n\n0.5 oz Melon Liqueur\n\n0.5 oz Blue Curacao\n\nSplash of Lemon Lime Soda\n\nFor this cocktail, you mix the Vodka, Melon Liqueur and Lemon Lime Soda, before adding a float of Blue Curacao. The Canucks are looking good this season, renewing the faith of the countless disappointed diehards of this franchise. Go Canucks Go!!!\n\nThroughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we journey through the Gateway to the West, checking in with the St. Louis Blues:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Blues entered the NHL during the 1967 expansion from the Original Six to 12 teams. The league had previously dabbled with the city by relocating the original Ottawa Senators there, becoming the St. Louis Eagles. The Eagles played one season (1934-35) before folding. The Blues are named for the W.C. Handy song Saint Louis Blues, released in 1914.\n\nStanley Cups: The Blues lone Stanley Cup victory occurred in 2019. The team also made the Stanley Cup Finals three times in their first three seasons, when the league’s divisions were split into the Original Six and the 1967 expansion teams (Next Six). St. Louis lost each time, twice to the Montreal Canadiens and once to the Boston Bruins. Revenge against Boston finally came with that 2019 championship.\n\nCelebrity Fan: There are a number of famous supporters of the Blues, including actors Jon Hamm and Jenna Fischer, who both call St. Louis home. Hamm and Fischer were honourary coaches during the 2020 NHL All-Star Game in St. Louis and were prominent in the Blues Stanley Cup run in 2019. Because of his lifelong love of the Blues, Hamm has also done a fair bit of work for the NHL, including hosting the NHL100 event.\n\nSuper Fan: Laila Anderson is often credited with inspiring the Blues to turn around their 2018-19 season, which climaxed with their Stanley Cup championship. Anderson, who battled a rare auto-immune disease during that season, became a mascot of sorts for the club, as she celebrated the Stanley Cup win with them on the ice and at their rally. Anderson was also presented with a Stanley Cup ring, which is etched with her name on the inside.\n\nMascot: Louie is a blue polar bear, who debuted during the 2007-08 season. Louie’s backstory says he travelled to St. Louis from the Arctic Circle, inspired to search out his favourite hockey team. A 2021 poll conducted by Play Canada ranked Louie as the fourth most popular mascot in the NHL, but given the winner of the poll was Carlton the Bear of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the poll loses all credibility.\n\nTradition: The Blues and their fans have a couple rituals of note. First, following a goal, a bell tone is played for each tally scored that night, as the crowd counts along. Also, during the team’s 2018-19 season turnaround and Stanley Cup run, the song Gloria by Laura Branigan became the Blues theme track, played after each win. The tune was retired after St. Louis celebrated raising their Stanley Cup banner.\n\nAppearances in Media: The Tom Hanks post-apocalyptic movie Finch is set in St. Louis and features his characters wearing a classic Blues jersey. Also, musician Nelly, a proud St. Louis native, can be seen alternating between St. Louis Cardinals and Blues gear throughout the music video for his hit song Country Grammar. Nelly can often be seen in Blues paraphernalia and is a big fan of the team.\n\nEvents/Scandals: Just days after the Blues were eliminated from the 2004 playoffs, player Mike Danton was arrested on a conspiracy to commit murder charge. Danton had attempted to hire a hitman to murder his agent David Frost. Danton was sentenced to 90 months in prison, serving 63 before he was released. Danton later claimed his estranged father was the intended target of the murder-for-hire plot.\n\nRivalry: The Blues have had a long-standing feud with the Chicago Blackhawks, as the two teams have shared a division since 1970. While brawls between the clubs were common, one particular melee in 1991 is known as the St. Patrick’s Day Massacre. The result of the fights was 12 players ejected and three players suspended. Interestingly, all six Sutter brothers were members of each team in 1991-92.\n\nTragedy: Bob Gassoff played for the Blues from 1973 to 1977. At a party following the 1976-77 season, hosted by teammate Garry Unger, Gassoff was involved in a motorcycle accident, killing him at only 24 years old. Following his death, Gassoff’s number 3 jersey was retired by the Blues and the Bob Gassoff Trophy was created, rewarded to the most improved defenseman of the Central Hockey League. Gassoff holds the Blues record for penalty minutes in a season at 306.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: Brett Hull’s father, Bobby Hull, was nicknamed the Golden Jet during his illustrious hockey career. Therefore, the moniker the Golden Brett was bestowed upon Brett, who shared his father’s scoring touch. Once Brett joined the Blues in 1988, he became one of the league’s most dangerous scorers, holding the franchise records for single-season and career goals. Hull’s jersey number 16 was retired by the Blues in 2006.\n\nLine: Sometimes, it doesn’t matter who the third member of a line is, so long as the first two pieces have tremendous chemistry. Such was the case when Brett Hull and Adam Oates were paired together, comprising the duo of Hull & Oates, a play on the musical tandem Hall & Oates. Together, Hull and Oates played together from 1989 to 1992, with Hull scoring 212 goals during that span, while his frequent playmaker Oates recorded 228 assists.\n\nCaptain: Brian Sutter was the longest-serving captain in Blues history, holding the mantle from 1979 up until his retirement in 1988. Sutter played his entire career with St. Louis, drafted by the team 20th overall in 1976. After hanging up his skates, Sutter became head coach of the Blues, leading them behind the bench from 1988 to 1992. Sutter’s number 11 jersey was retired by the organization on December 30, 1988.\n\nEnforcer: Kelly Chase and Tony Twist were known as the Bruise Brothers while they played together for the Blues in 1989-90 and later from 1997 to 1999. The two had been together in junior hockey with the Saskatoon Blades and the minor leagues with the Peoria Rivermen. Despite being good friends and Twist living in Chase’s house while he was with the Hartford Whalers, the two even fought each other during a March 9, 1996 game.\n\nFamily Values: The Plager brothers (Bobby, Barclay and Bill) played together for the Blues from 1968 to 1972. The trio helped lead St. Louis to their three straight Stanley Cup Finals appearances after the Blues joined the NHL. Another brother set to suit up together with St. Louis was Gino and Paul Cavallini. They were both members of the franchise from 1987 to 1992.\n\nReturning Players: David Perron has had three stints with the Blues. He was drafted by the team in 2007, playing six seasons, before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers in 2013. Perron returned to St. Louis as a free agent in 2016, but after one season, was the Vegas Golden Knights Expansion Draft choice from the Blues. He was back in St. Louis in 2018, playing four seasons, before signing as a free agent with the Detroit Red Wings in 2022.\n\nShort Stint: Some of the greatest players of all-time have had such short stints with St. Louis, that seeing them in a Blues jersey looks odd. This includes goalies Martin Brodeur (seven games after two decades with the New Jersey Devils), and Tom Barrasso (six games), along with Peter Stastny (27 games, regular season and playoffs combined), and even Wayne Gretzky (31 games, regular season and playoffs combined).\n\nUndrafted: Curtis Joseph, nicknamed Cujo, from the Stephen King novel of the same name, was signed out of the NCAA University of Wisconsin in 1989. He would remain in St. Louis until 1995, gaining a reputation as one of the best goalies in the league, including being a Vezina Trophy finalist for the 1992-93 season. In 2015, Joseph was inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nTrade: Among the Blues better acquisitions were bringing in Brett Hull from the Calgary Flames in March 1988 (along with Steve Bozek for Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley), followed by Adam Oates from the Detroit Red Wings in June 1989 (along with Paul MacLean for Bernie Federko and Tony Mckegney). The two combined to make one of the most lethal offensive duos in NHL history, as noted above.\n\nSigning: In the early 90s, the Blues made a number of offer sheet signings to restricted free agents. They threw out contracts to the likes of Scott Stevens (twice!), Dave Christian, Brendan Shanahan, Michel Goulet, Marty McSorely, Petr Nedved, and Shayne Corson. Only Goulet, McSorely and Stevens (the second time) didn’t end up with the club, but the cost of the acquisitions was a number of draft picks and key players lost in compensation.\n\nDraft Pick: The Blues have had an interesting draft history. The team passed on their opportunity to make any picks in their very first draft in 1967, didn’t participate in the 1983 draft, and had five straight first rounders (1991-95) transfer to the Washington Capitals, as compensation for the successful Scott Stevens offer sheet. They have selected first overall just once, taking defenseman Erik Johnson in 2006.\n\nHoldouts: Alex Pietrangelo only missed one training camp practice before signing a seven-year, $45.5 million contract with the Blues in 2013. The hope was that Pietrangelo would spend his entire career with the team, but the defenseman, who was selected fourth overall in 2008, joined the Vegas Golden Knights in free agency in 2020 (seven years, $61.6 million), upon the expiry of the aforementioned pact.\n\nBuyouts: The Blues have only used two buyouts in their history and none since 2009. In 2007, the team parted ways with captain Dallas Drake, following six seasons in St. Louis. Drake would move onto the Detroit Red Wings for a season, retiring as a Stanley Cup champion. Two years later, defenseman Jay McKee was bought out of the final year of his four-year, $16 million contract signed in 2006. His final campaign came with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nUnique Game: The Blues have participated in two Winter Classic games. First, they hosted the rival Chicago Blackhawks in 2017, followed by facing the Minnesota Wild in 2022. St. Louis and the Edmonton Oilers also participated in the 1990 Epson Cup in Dusseldorf, West Germany, which included a game against each other as part of the tournament. Finally, the Blues opened their 2009-10 season with a pair of games against the Detroit Red Wings in Stockholm, Sweden, for the 2009 NHL Premiere.\n\nGoal: Blues fans waited 52 years for the club’s first Stanley Cup and it took a 4-1 win in Game 7 of the finals against the Boston Bruins to get that title. The St. Louis faithful were put at ease when Ryan O’Reilly tallied the opening goal of that game at 16:47 of the first period and the Blues never looked back. O’Reilly was later named the Conn Smythe Trophy recipient as playoff MVP.\n\nFight/Brawl: Blues history is littered with infamous brawls. These include melees against the Philadelphia Flyers (1972), Pittsburgh Penguins (1973), New York Rangers (1974), Chicago Blackhawks (1991 St. Patrick’s Day Massacre), and Detroit Red Wings (1993). The fracas with the Penguins occurred during a pre-season contest and lasted 20 minutes, with fighting occurring in the penalty boxes and the hallway leading from them to St. Louis’ dressing room.\n\nInjury: Two Blues defensemen have suffered serious heart issues during games with the team. First, during the 1998 playoffs, Chris Pronger was hit with a slapshot to the chest in a contest against the Detroit Red Wings. This caused Pronger to go into cardiac arrest due to his heart rhythm being disrupted. Next, in 2020, Jay Bouwmeester collapsed on the bench due to cardiac arrest. Thankfully, both players survived their ordeals, but Bouwmeester never played in the NHL again.\n\nPenalty: During a 1969 pre-season game, Wayne Maki got into a stick swinging fight against Ted Green of the Boston Bruins. Maki clubbed Green over the head, resulting in a fractured skull and brain injury. Both players were charged with assault, becoming the first NHL players to face criminal prosecution for an on-ice incident, but were acquitted. Maki was suspended 30 days, while Green missed the entire season recovering.\n\nWildest Story: The Blues were almost moved to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1983, but the NHL’s Board of Governors voted to reject the proposed $12 million sale. This led to lawsuits between then owner Ralston Purina (of the Purina animal food empire) and the NHL, with control of the franchise taken over by the league. The result was the Blues stayed in St. Louis, when a new ownership group, led by businessman Harry Ornest, was put together.\n\nBlooper: In February 2006, Blues defenseman Dennis Wideman made one of the most memorable shootout attempts of all-time… memorable for all the wrong reasons. As Wideman swiftly skated towards Chicago Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford, he made a nice deke move, but lost a skate edge and went flying up in the air, landing flat on his back, with the puck sliding into the corner of the rink.\n\nMiscellaneous: Bernie Federko deserves some mentioning, as he’s the Blues career leader in games, assists and points, while sitting second all-time in goals. Federko was drafted by St. Louis seventh overall in 1976, remaining with the team until a 1989 trade to the Detroit Red Wings. Federko would have his number 24 jersey retired by the Blues in 1991 and for an extended period was the color commentator on the team’s TV broadcasts.\n\nSt. Louis Blues: Monday Night Miracle\n\n1.5 oz Gin or Vodka\n\n1 oz Blue Curacao\n\nSplash of Lime Juice\n\nGarnish with a Lime Slice\n\nThis cocktail is named after the greatest comeback in Blues history, Game 6 of the Campbell Conference Finals, which occurred on Monday, May 12, 1986. The Blues were down 5-2 with 12 minutes left in the contest, when they rallied to force overtime and won 6-5. Despite the momentum change, they would still lose the series to the Calgary Flames.\n\nThroughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we head to the Big Apple and take a bite out of the New York Rangers:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Rangers are one of the NHL’s Original Six franchises, founded in 1926. The club was originally owned by George ‘Tex’ Rickard, who wanted a second team to play out of Madison Square Garden (MSG), which he was president of, based on the success of the New York Americans. Rickard’s team quickly earned the nickname ‘Tex’s Rangers’ and the latter half stuck.\n\nStanley Cups: The Rangers were the first U.S. team to win the Stanley Cup and have won a total of four championships. The team ended a 54-year drought when they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in 1994. Since then, they have appeared in one Stanley Cup Final, losing to the Los Angeles Kings in 2014. Other championship round losses include 1929, 1932, 1937, 1950, 1972 and 1979.\n\nCelebrity Fan: Playing at one of the most famous arenas in the world, in a VIP hub like New York City, brings a lot of star power to games. Some particular luminaries known to drop by MSG, sporting their Rangers threads, includes Liam Neeson, Kate Upton, Spike Lee, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, John McEnroe, Jason Bateman, and others. On any given night, you can spot multiple celebs supporting the Rangers.\n\nSuper Fan: Bobby Granger was a fictional super fan, created by the Rangers for a series of TV commercials. The character was played by real-life fan Kev Kage, with ads including Granger teaching Rangers players how to say “Fuhgeddaboudit”, learning to speak Czech from Jaromir Jagr and taking a slap shot to the groin from Brendan Shanahan. Granger was also used to pump up the crowd prior to playoff games.\n\nMascot: The Rangers have never had a mascot in their close to a century-long history. As of the 2022-23 season, the Rangers remain the only team in the league to not have a mascot and that may never change. Some have suggested a Statue of Liberty type, while others lean towards some sort of animal. There’s even an online petition, launched with the hopes of the team adding a mascot.\n\nTradition: Denis Potvin hasn’t played in the NHL since 1988, but that hasn’t stopped Rangers fans from chanting “Potvin Sucks” at every home game since the former New York Islanders captain inadvertently injured Ulf Nilsson in February 1979. The chant became so popular, spurred on by the organ tune Let’s Go Band, it was released on a vinyl album by the band Bobby Nyse and the Scrotums.\n\nAppearances in Media: The plot of the 1999 movie Mystery, Alaska deals with an amateur hockey team preparing for an exhibition game with the Rangers. The film starred Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Burt Reynolds and Mike Myers, while the likes of Phil Esposito, Little Richard, Jim Fox and Barry Melrose appeared as themselves. Unfortunately, the movie did not do well critically or financially.\n\nEvents/Scandals: Some believe the Rangers half-century championship drought was due to the Curse of 1940, aka Dutton’s Curse. The story goes that MSG owners paid off their mortgage to coincide with the Rangers 1940 Stanley Cup win, so burned the document in the treasured trophy, resulting in the curse. Another version has New York Americans owner Red Dutton declaring the Rangers wouldn’t win again in his lifetime, after his team was not reinstated into the NHL following World War II. Dutton died in 1987.\n\nRivalry: The Rangers have long-standing rivalries with a number of their Metropolitan Division adversaries. This includes the New York Islanders (Battle of New York), New Jersey Devils (Battle of the Hudson River), Philadelphia Flyers (Broadway vs. Broad Street), and Washington Capitals. During their founding years, they also feuded with the New York Americans, which they practically drove out of the NHL… and were cursed for doing so.\n\nTragedy: There is a lot of death surrounding the Rangers. Minor leaguer Wayne Larkin (heart attack in training camp), legendary goaltender Terry Sawchuk (pulmonary embolism weeks after a roughhousing accident with a teammate), forward Roman Lyashenko (suicide), prospect Alexei Cherepanov (heart attack during Kontinental Hockey League game), and enforcer Derek Boogaard (accidental overdose) all died as members or recent members of the organization.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: At a height of 5’9”, tenacious winger Pat Verbeek was given the nickname ‘Little Ball of Hate’ by teammate Glenn Healy in 1995. Fellow teammate Ray Ferraro was known as the ‘Big Ball of Hate’, standing a whole inch taller than Verbeek. Another popular moniker in the franchise’s history was ‘The King’, attached to goalie Henrik Lundqvist by fans and media during his stellar rookie season.\n\nLine: The Rangers have had some really great line names. This includes the Mafia Line (“Godfather” Phil Esposito and his two “Dons” Don Maloney and Don Murdoch), as well as the Czechmates (Petr Nedved, Jan Hlavac, Radek Dvorak). Their most productive line of all-time, was dubbed the GAG Line or Goal-A-Game Line. Comprised of Jean Ratelle, Vic Hadfield and Rod Gilbert, the unit played together from 1968-69 to 1973-74.\n\nCaptain: Mark Messier is so synonymous with the term leader in hockey that the Mark Messier Leadership Award has been given to an NHL captain or other leader since the 2006-07 season. Perhaps Messier’s greatest leadership moment was guaranteeing the Rangers would win Game 6 of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals. They did, thanks to a natural hat trick for Messier, then went on to take Game 7 and later won the Stanley Cup.\n\nEnforcer: Jeff Beukeboom played eight seasons for the Rangers, leading the team in penalty minutes in a season three times. Beukeboom sits second for the franchise record for total penalty minutes at 1,157, just 69 minutes behind the leader, Ron Greschner, who spent his entire 16-season NHL career with the club. Beukeboom was used in a popular ESPN This is SportsCenter ad, where he attacked sportscaster Steve Levy, after Levy referred to him as “Puke-a-boom”.\n\nFamily Values: The Patrick family is synonymous with the long history of the Rangers. Lester Patrick was the first GM in team history, guiding the club from 1926 to 1946 and winning three Stanley Cups. Lester’s sons, Lynn and Muzz, both played for the team during Lester’s reign, with Lynn later becoming a coach and Muzz a GM for New York. Finally, Lynn’s son Craig served as GM of the franchise from 1980 to 1986, including temporarily coaching the team at times.\n\nReturning Players: Following the 1996-97 season, the Rangers were prepared to part ways with captain Mark Messier. Messier moved on to the Vancouver Canucks for three disastrous seasons personally and organizationally, before returning to New York in 2000. Messier regained the captaincy from Brian Leetch, as well as his previous playing form. Messier would remain with the team through the 2003-04 campaign, officially retiring in September 2005.\n\nShort Stint: NHL Hall of Fame members Guy Lafleur and Pat LaFontaine played 67 games each for the Rangers. Lafleur had been retired from the league since 1985, when he staged a comeback and joined New York in 1988. After one season, Lafleur left for the Quebec Nordiques. As for LaFontaine, he joined the Rangers for the 1997-98 season, with a history of concussions following him. In a March 1998 contest, he collided with a teammate, suffering another head injury and never played again, officially retiring in 1999.\n\nUndrafted: In 1978, World Hockey Association (WHA) stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson were lured to the NHL by twin $600,000 deals offered by the Rangers. Their WHA team, the Winnipeg Jets, simply couldn’t afford to match those offers. Another European fan favourite, Mats Zuccarello (nicknamed The Hobbit, for his 5’8” stature), came to the Rangers organization in 2010, playing with the team for nine seasons.\n\nTrade: GM Neil Smith earned the nickname ‘Big Deal Neil’ during his tenure with the Rangers from 1989 to 2000. His biggest acquisition was trading for Mark Messier in 1991, giving up Bernie Nicholls, Louie DeBrusk and Steven Rice in exchange. Messier would lead the team to their 1994 Stanley Cup, which also included other Edmonton Oilers dynasty members Kevin Lowe, Adam Graves, Glenn Anderson, Esa Tikkanen, Craig MacTavish, and Jeff Beukeboom.\n\nSigning: For a time, the Rangers seemed to try and sign every top free agent available, often to awful deals they would later regret. Wade Redden (six-year, $39 million), Brad Richards (nine-year, $60 million), Scott Gomez (seven-year, $51.5 million), Chris Drury (five-year, $35.5 million), Bobby Holik (five-year, $45 million), Theoren Fleury (four-year, $28 million), and Kevin Shattenkirk (four-year, $26.65 million) all signed loaded contracts they never lived up to.\n\nDraft Pick: Despite their long history, the Rangers have rarely had a top pick to utilize. The jury is still out on 2020 first overall selection Alexis Lafreniere, as well as 2019 second overall choice Kaapo Kakko. Pavel Brendl, taken fourth overall in 1999, never played for New York and only had 78 total NHL games. Some great picks for the Rangers were diamond in the rough goalie finds Henrik Lundqvist (205th overall in 2000) and Igor Shesterkin (118th overall in 2014).\n\nHoldouts: Mark Messier, who ended up in New York after a holdout with the Edmonton Oilers, became a legend in the city as the team won their first Stanley Cup since 1940. His popularity waned a bit before the next season could start, as Messier wanted to negotiate a new contract with the Rangers. The 1994-95 NHL lockout meant nobody played until January, but Messier was still without a new contract until days into the shortened season.\n\nBuyouts: The Rangers have capitalized on using buyouts to get themselves out of bad free agent deals, but a stunning buyout was that of goalie Henrik Lundqvist, a fan favourite and backbone of the team for years. He was sent packing in 2020, with one year remaining on his deal, landing with the Washington Capitals. Before he could ever play for another team, it was discovered Lundqvist was suffering from an irregular heartbeat, which would eventually lead to his retirement.\n\nUnique Game: The Rangers have been featured in many NHL special events, including the 1991 Las Vegas outdoor game vs. Los Angeles Kings, a 2006 pre-season game in San Juan, Puerto Rico vs. Florida Panthers, the 2011 NHL Premiere (two games in Stockholm, Sweden), the 2012 Winter Classic vs. Philadelphia Flyers, a pair of 2014 Stadium Series contests vs. New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders, and the 2018 Winter Classic vs. Buffalo Sabres. The Rangers and Islanders will play as part of the 2024 Stadium Series.\n\nGoal: The Rangers 1994 Stanley Cup would not be possible had it not been for Stephane Matteau’s Game 7 double overtime winner in the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals. The tally is best remembered for play-by-play man Howie Rose’s call of ‘Matteau, Matteau, Matteau!” Another memorable goal was Marek Malik’s 2005 between-the-legs shootout winner to end the longest shootout in NHL history. Malik was not known for his scoring ability, but ended the game in fashion in the 15th round.\n\nFight/Brawl: Brawls with the Boston Bruins (1979) and Los Angeles Kings (1981) have already been covered during this project, so we’ll focus on a 1971 melee with the Toronto Maple Leafs, that is best remembered for Leafs goalie Bernie Parent’s mask going missing for 41 years. During the fracas, Rangers captain Vic Hadfield tossed Parent’s face shield into the crowd and it wasn’t seen again by Parent until a memorabilia collector asked him to authenticate the mask in 2012. It was the real deal.\n\nInjury: During a November 1998 game against the Los Angeles Kings, Jeff Beukeboom was sucker punched by Kings enforcer Matt Johnson. This resulted in another concussion for Beukeboom, whose physical playing style had resulted in other head injuries throughout his career. Johnson was suspended 12 games for his actions. While Beukeboom did return to action, another hit to the head in 1999 ended his career, due to post-concussion syndrome.\n\nPenalty: During the 2008 playoffs, the Rangers were facing the New Jersey Devils. While on a power play, super pest Sean Avery decided to use a new tactic against legendary goalie Martin Brodeur, by wildly waving his arms and stick in front of the netminder to distract him. The next day, the NHL ruled that this could be penalized as unsportsmanlike conduct in the future, resulting in a minor penalty. The statute is commonly known as ‘The Avery Rule’.\n\nWildest Story: Tony DeAngelo’s time with the Rangers came with much controversy, especially the end of his tenure. DeAngelo was put on waivers on January 31, 2021, following a reported physical confrontation with teammate Alexandar Geogiev. The altercation stemmed from DeAngelo saying something to the goalie following a loss and Georgiev electing to attack the defenseman. DeAngelo was dismissed from the Rangers and bought out of his contract at the end of the season.\n\nBlooper: Wayne Gretzky played the final three seasons of his career with the Rangers (1996-99). Despite being the most famous hockey star of all-time, on October 30, 1997, for a game against the New York Islanders, the equipment team spelled the Great One’s name GRETKZY on the back of his jersey. Gretzky would have a similar jersey name bar mishap when visiting English Premier League team Tottenham Hotspur, who gave him a custom jersey with GRETSKY on the back.\n\nMiscellaneous: On March 13, 1948, Larry Kwong became the first non-white and Asian player in NHL history, breaking the colour barrier, when he played one shift with the Rangers at the end of what would prove to be his only NHL game. Kwong, who played most of his later career in Quebec senior leagues, had previously been invited to training camp with the Chicago Black Hawks in 1942, but the Canadian government declined to process the paperwork needed for Kwong to leave the country.\n\nNew York Rangers: The Broadway Blueshirts\n\n2 oz Tequila\n\nTop with Coconut Water\n\nSplash of Lime Juice\n\nDash of Agave Nectar\n\nDashes of Angostura Bitters\n\nGarnish with a Lime Wedge\n\nThis recipe comes from Hornitos Tequila, with its name coming from a nickname for the Rangers. For those wanting more Rangers cocktail options, the Blueshirts Bartender on Instagram creates a new Rangers-themed beverage before every game.\n\nThroughout the year, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel the National Hockey League (NHL), discovering the best and worst each team has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink based off the franchise. Today, we hit the bright lights of Hollywood… or Hockeywood as it has come to be known, with a look at the Los Angeles Kings:\n\nEstablishment Story: The Kings joined the NHL in the 1967 expansion from six to 12 teams. Along with the Oakland Golden Seals, they became the first west coast teams in the league. A fan contest was held to name the team, with the winning entry being Kings, thanks to owner Jack Kent Cooke wanting the franchise to have “an air of royalty”. This is also why the team’s original colour scheme was purple and gold.\n\nStanley Cups: The Kings have won two Stanley Cups, in 2012 and 2014, defeating the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers, respectively. Prior to that, they had only appeared in one Stanley Cup Final, losing to the Montreal Canadiens in 1993. The Wayne Gretzky years were supposed to bring more success, but the 1993 Finals appearance was preceded by playoff struggles and followed by not making the post-season at all.\n\nCelebrity Fan: With the arrival of Wayne Gretzky in 1988, the Great Western Forum in Inglewood was the place to be, drawing many Hollywood celebrities to games. Actors such as John Candy and Alan Thicke (both transplanted Canadians) could regularly be seen at games, while Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts were spotted on occasion. Today, the likes of Will Ferrell and Snoop Dogg are supporters of the Kings.\n\nSuper Fan: Original fans who greeted the team at the airport as they arrived to move into their new Los Angeles home dubbed themselves the Kings Court. Supporters groups are still part of the Kings fan experience today, with an official club known as the Royal Army. Royal Army membership perks include a gift from the Kings, access to exclusive events and various discounts.\n\nMascot: Bailey is a lion, who debuted for the Kings in 2007. He wears jersey number 72, a reference to Los Angeles’ average temperature and was named after Garnet ‘Ace’ Bailey, who was the Kings Director of Pro Scouting, when he was aboard one of the flights crashed into the World Trade Center on 9/11. Previously, the Kings mascot was a snow leopard named Kingston, but it was introduced and retired within the same year in 1990.\n\nTradition: For a team that has existed since the 1967 expansion, I had a surprisingly tough time finding content to fill this section. The Kings current goal song is called Hey Hey by Twilight Trio, while a former track used to celebrate scores was Randy Newman’s I Love LA. For a time, each player on the Kings had their own goal song, with a mix of rap, country, pop and rock songs comprising the list.\n\nAppearances in Media: The Kings have appeared in a couple of movies, including Tooth Fairy and The Love Guru, making Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Justin Timberlake fictional members of the team, as Derek ‘Tooth Fairy’ Thompson and Jacques ‘Le Coq’ Grande, respectively. Wayne Gretzky also rocked Kings paraphernalia in a couple skits as part of his Saturday Night Live hosting gig in May 1989.\n\nEvents/Scandals: On October 20, 2014, defenseman Slava Voynov was arrested for domestic violence against his wife. He was immediately suspended by the NHL and later charged with a felony count for “corporal injury to a spouse”. In July 2015, Voynov plead guilty to a lesser misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation. In order to avoid deportation, Voynov voluntarily returned to Russia. His six-year, $25 million contract signed in June 2013 was terminated.\n\nRivalry: The Kings two biggest rivals are their fellow California clubs. First, there’s the Anaheim Ducks, as both teams play within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Their feud is known as the Freeway Face-Off, as Interstate 5 separates the two locales. Next, is the San Jose Sharks, with the team’s rivalry being part of a Northern vs. Southern California comparison. The Kings beat both teams en route to the 2014 Stanley Cup.\n\nTragedy: During the 1978-79 season, forward Scott Garland played six games for the Kings, along with 45 contests for their American Hockey League affiliate, the Springfield Indians. That off-season, Garland was killed while driving in Montreal, Quebec, when he blew a tire and crashed into a retaining wall. Garland was only 27 years old. He had previously played for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nPlayer Nicknames: There are some pretty good nicknames from the Kings history. For example, Luc Robitaille was dubbed Lucky, while Bernie Nicholls – a personal favourite of mine from childhood, after he winked at me while watching the Kings warm up for a game against the Vancouver Canucks – was called Pumper, a reference to pumpernickel bread. More recent memorable monikers include The Colonel for Kyle Clifford and Mr. Game 7 for Justin Williams.\n\nLine: One of the most prolific lines in NHL history was the Triple Crown Line, comprised of Dave Taylor, Charlie Simmer and Marcel Dionne. The trio played together from 1979 to 1984, with the 1980-81 season being their most successful, as the unit combined for 328 points. They became the first line in NHL history with each player recording a 100-plus point season.\n\nCaptain: Dustin Brown played his entire 18-season career with the Kings, after being drafted 13th overall by the team in 2003. Brown was named captain in of the Kings in 2008 and held the mantle for both of their Stanley Cup championships. In 2016, the captaincy was passed to Anze Kopitar. In April 2022, Brown announced plans to retire following the playoffs and was named captain for his final regular season contest. He was honoured with a statue outside Crypto.com Arena on the night of his jersey retirement.\n\nEnforcer: When Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Kings, he requested Marty McSorley be part of the deal, ensuring he had someone to watch his back coming along with him to Los Angeles. McSorley knew his role well, piling up a franchise single-season record 399 penalty minutes in 1992-93. McSorley also holds the Kings all-time penalty minute record with 1,846 over two stints with the club.\n\nFamily Values: From 1996 to 1998, brothers Jan and Roman Vopat were members of the Kings organization together. Similarly, brothers Mario and Adrian Kempe were both signed with the Kings in 2019, although Mario only played 16 games in the minors, before having his contract mutually terminated, while Adrian has been an NHL mainstay since 2017-18.\n\nReturning Players: Luc Robitaille had three stints with the Kings. Drafted by the team in 1984, he spent the first decade of his career with the franchise. After stints with the Pittsburgh Penguins and New York Rangers, Robitaille returned to Los Angeles for four more seasons. Robitaille would then move to the Detroit Red Wings for two years, before retiring with the Kings in 2006, wearing the captain’s ‘C’ in his final game.\n\nShort Stint: Jarome Iginla wrapped up his celebrated career with a 19-game stint with the Kings, after being traded to Los Angeles on March 1, 2017. Although he produced six goals and three assists in those contests, Iginla was not re-signed following the season. He announced his retirement on July 30, 2018. The run with the Kings allowed him a final appearance against the Calgary Flames, allowing fans to cheer for the former face of the franchise one more time.\n\nUndrafted: Steve Duchesne was signed by the Kings in October 1984, debuting for the team for the 1986-87 season, where he would be named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. Duchesne played five seasons with Los Angeles, before bouncing around the league for a number of years. He played another 60 games with the Kings in 1998-99. Duchesne’s final three campaigns were spent with the Detroit Red Wings, where he would retire after winning the 2002 Stanley Cup.\n\nTrade: Well, the deal that brought Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles not only shook the NHL’s foundation, it also changed the entire North American sports landscape. So, I think that has to go here. Gretzky was acquired, along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski, in exchange for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, $15 million and three first-round draft picks. The deal is cited as the reason the NHL was able to expand into much of the U.S. over the next decade.\n\nSigning: The Kings best free agent signing was Willie Mitchell, who they landed in 2010. Mitchell’s rugged defensive play greatly helped Los Angeles on their road to both the 2012 and 2014 Stanley Cups. Among the team’s worst signings were Simon Gagne and Ilya Kovalchuk. Gagne was signed to a two-year, $7 million deal, but only managed to appear in 45 games over those two seasons. Kovalchuk returned from Russia to join the Kings, before a messy contract termination in the second season of his three-year pact.\n\nDraft Pick: The Kings have only selected first overall once in franchise history, when they picked Rick Pagnutti in 1967. Pagnutti never played in the NHL. The team has done well with the second overall pick, selecting Jimmy Carson (1986), Drew Doughty (2008) and Quinton Byfield (2020). Carson was used as part of the package to bring Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles, while Doughty was a leader for the team’s two Stanley Cup championships. Byfield comes to the Kings as a highly-touted prospect.\n\nHoldouts: Speaking of Drew Doughty, prior to the 2011-12 season, the star defenseman needed a new contract. A sticking point in the negotiations was the team not wanting to pay Doughty more than Anze Kopitar’s $6.8 million per year. With the regular season fast approaching – Doughty missed most of the Kings pre-season – the sides finally settled on an eight-year, $56 million deal ($7 million per year), going on to win the 2012 Stanley Cup.\n\nBuyouts: After two seasons with the Kings, defenseman Dion Phaneuf was bought out of the final two seasons of his seven-year, $49 million contract, signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs on December 31, 2013. The buyout was split between Los Angeles and the Ottawa Senators, who had retained 25 per cent of Phaneuf’s salary, when they traded him to Los Angeles. The Kings paid Phaneuf $4.25 million over four years.\n\nUnique Game: On September 27, 1991, the NHL staged an outdoor pre-season game in Las Vegas, Nevada. The contest took place between the Kings and the New York Rangers, played on a rink constructed on the parking lot of the Caesars Palace resort. This was the NHL’s first outdoor game and it saw the Kings win 5-2. Temperatures reached as high as 95 °F (35 °C). A rematch between the teams was scheduled for two days later in Charlotte, North Carolina, but was cancelled due to unsafe ice conditions.\n\nGoal: A number of Wayne Gretzky goals remain highlights for the franchise. These include breaking Gordie Howe’s all-time points (1989 – assisting on a Bernie Nicholls marker) and all-time goals (1994) records. There’s also Alec Martinez’s double overtime winner, clinching the 2014 Stanley Cup for the Kings and Daryl Evans OT tally, completing the 1982 Miracle on Manchester triumph, the largest comeback victory in NHL playoff history.\n\nFight/Brawl: During Game 2 of the Kings 1981 playoffs series against the New York Rangers, a bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the first period. The resulting chaos included players not dressed for the game getting involved, such as Nick Fotiu of the Rangers coming down from the stands in a suit to join the fray. Fotiu wasn’t in the lineup because he was serving an eight-game suspension for previously going into the stands to fight fans. The Kings won the game, but the Rangers won the series.\n\nInjury: Tony Granato’s career was almost ended in January 1996, when following a game against the Hartford Whalers, bleeding was discovered on his brain. It did mark the end of Granato’s time with the Kings, but the winger was able to return with the San Jose Sharks the following season. Sadly, head injuries did prematurely end the career of Adam Deadmarsh during the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nPenalty: During Game 2 of the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, the Kings were up 2-1 in the game and 1-0 in the series. All was going well until Montreal Canadiens coach Jacques Demers asked for a check of Marty McSorley’s stick. McSorely’s stick had an illegal curve and he was given a minor penalty. Montreal scored the tying goal on that power play and won the game in overtime, going on to win Game 3-5 and clinch the Stanley Cup.\n\nWildest Story: The Kings went through some serious turmoil in the mid 1990s, when owner Bruce McNall was levied with conspiracy and fraud charges after he swindled six banks of $236 million over 10 years. McNall was sentenced to 70 months in prison, with the Kings ultimately forced to declare bankruptcy in 1995. In the end, you can’t the guy too much, given he was partly responsible for bringing the movie Weekend at Bernie’s to the world as a producer.\n\nBlooper: Although Jonathan Quick is arguably the greatest goalie the Kings have ever had, we all make mistakes. On October 7, 2013, against the New York Rangers, Quick came out of his net to play a puck dumped in from his own zone by Ryan McDonagh of the Rangers. As Quick lost his stick, the puck ricocheted off his blocker and into the net, making for an easy goal. Quick was understandably upset at the gaffe, which became the insurance tally in a Rangers 3-1 win.\n\nMiscellaneous: In September, the Kings will take part in the first ever NHL games to take place in the Southern Hemisphere, when they play two pre-season contests against the Arizona Coyotes in Melbourne, Australia, as part of the 2023 NHL Global Series. Los Angeles has also played international games – mostly exhibition matches – in Austria, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and China.\n\nLos Angeles Kings: The Kings Ice\n\nRim glass with Sugar\n\nSage Leaves\n\n1.5 oz Vodka\n\n0.5 oz Elderflower Liqueur\n\nSplash of Lime Juice\n\nDash of Simple Syrup\n\nGarnish with a Sage Leaf\n\nThis cocktail comes from the Tipsy Diaries blog. I haven’t worked a whole lot with sage as an ingredient, but I liked the earthiness it brought to this cocktail. The drink can be served either on the rocks or martini style.\n\nEach month, the Sip Advisor will alphabetically travel Canada, discovering the best each province has to offer in a variety of subjects. We will also feature a drink the area is known for. Today, we journey to Ontario, which likes to think of itself as the center of the universe. Does that theory hold up? Let’s find out:\n\nMotto: “Loyal she began, loyal she remains” – This has some abusive vibes to it…\n\nFood: While popular across the country – and even internationally – Tim Hortons is an institution in Ontario. It was founded in Hamilton in 1964 by hockey star Tim Horton. The company’s headquarters are now in Toronto. As of 2022, there were 1,713 Tim Hortons locations in Ontario, accounting for 48 per cent of all the chain’s locations in Canada. I can attest, Tim Hortons donut holes, called Timbits, are quite addictive.\n\nDrink: The Labatt Brewing Company was founded by John Labatt in 1847 in London, back when the area was known as Canada West, rather than Ontario. The company is headquartered in Toronto, but is now owned by the Anheuser-Busch InBev conglomerate. Labatt is the largest brewery in Canada, with brands including Labatt Blue (lager) and Labatt 50 (ale).\n\nSite to See: Niagara Falls, on the border of Ontario and New York State, is the top tourist attraction in the province. Most fascinating to me is the number of daredevils who have tried to survive going over the falls. Sadly, many did not live to tell the tale, including those who used the falls to commit suicide. An estimated 5,000 bodies have been found in the waters below the falls between 1850 and 2011.\n\nStreet: Yonge Street in Toronto was, for a time, called the longest street in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records. Although this was a mistake, one title that has remained is ‘Main Street Ontario’. Notable sites along the route include the Eaton Centre shopping mall and Dundas Square, where a number of eating, entertainment and shopping options can be found.\n\nTV Show: I’ve enjoyed a number of series set in Ontario, chief among them Letterkenny. The show highlights the lives of those living in the country community, based on star Jared Keeso’s hometown of Listowel. The townsfolk are broken up between being hicks, jocks, skids and natives. The quick dialogue has created many popular catchphrases and added numerous idioms to the lexicon.\n\nMovie: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, starring Michael Cera, is about a young man pursuing the girl of his dreams, only to find out he has to defeat her seven evil exes to be with her. The film, based on the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series, uses many video game references. It’s set in Toronto, featuring landmarks such as Casa Loma, St. Michael’s College School and a Toronto Public Library location.\n\nBook/Author: Margaret Atwood, born in Ottawa, is a Canadian literary icon. Atwood has published numerous works, including 18 novels, 18 books of poetry, eight children’s books and two graphic novels. Perhaps her most notable work is The Handmaid’s Tale, which was adapted into a 2017 TV series. Among her many accolades, Atwood received the Order of Canada in 1981 and Order of Ontario in 1990.\n\nFictional Character: A few other characters/shows deserving of mention include Mr. Kim (Kim’s Convenience), William Murdoch (Murdoch Mysteries), Red Green (The Red Green Show), Hobo the Dog (The Littlest Hobo), and Bob and Doug McKenzie (SCTV). Combined, the characters/shows give a good representation of Ontario from the late 19th century – the setting of Murdoch Mysteries – to present day.\n\nFictional City: Since Letterkenny was already mentioned above, I’ll use this category to feature Schitt’s Creek, both the show and the invented locale. When video store mogul Johnny Rose loses his entire fortune, he and his peculiar family are forced to move to the one property they still own, the rural town of Schitt’s Creek. Here, they interact with the eclectic citizens, while trying to rebuild their lives.\n\nActor/Actress: There are too many folks that fit this category, so I’ll just list them: Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Ryan Gosling, Jay Baruchel, Rachel McAdams, Keanu Reeves, Michael Cera, Will Arnett, Dan Aykroyd, Phil Hartman, Matthew Perry, John Candy, Neve Campbell, Eugene Levy, Rick Moranis, Catherine O’Hara, Sandra Oh, Martin Short… did I miss anyone?\n\nSong: A Place to Stand, A Place to Grow is the unofficial anthem of Ontario. It was written by Dolores Claman, best known for writing The Hockey Theme, which is viewed as a secondary national anthem in Canada. The song was used at the Ontario pavilion at the Expo 67 World’s Fair in Montreal, Quebec. It was also featured in the short film A Place to Stand, which won a 1967 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nBand/Musician: Once again, there are many options for this category. If I had to narrow it down to one, I think I’d select Justin Bieber. Just kidding, I’d probably go with Rush, but others deserving of mention include Alanis Morissette, The Tragically Hip, Drake, Barenaked Ladies, Avril Lavigne, Neil Young, The Weeknd, Shania Twain, Paul Anka, Blue Rodeo, Alessia Cara, deadmau5, Gordon Lightfoot, Our Lady Peace, Sum 41, etc.\n\nPeople: Another tough category to narrow down, so I’ll split it between two long-time media personalities, one universally beloved and the other incredibly controversial. First, Alex Trebek, born in Sudbury, hosted TV game show Jeopardy! for 37 years before his death in 2020. On the other end of the spectrum, hockey pundit Don Cherry was a fixture of Hockey Night in Canada for 33 years before being unceremoniously fired in 2019.\n\nAnimal: A few giant pandas have had notable stays at the Toronto Zoo. First, Qing Qing and Quan Quan appeared at the zoo in 1985, shattering all attendance records over the zoo’s history. Decades later, Er Shun and Da Mao arrived in Toronto and in 2015, Er Shun gave birth to twin cubs, the first birth of giant pandas to occur in Canada. The cubs were named Jia Panpan (Canadian Hope) and Jia Yueyue (Canadian Joy).\n\nInvention: Insulin, co-discovered by Sir Frederick Banting (born in Alliston) has to take this spot, thanks to the hormone’s ability to save the lives of those with diabetes or at least allow them to enjoy a safer, more comfortable existence. For his discovery, Banting was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Medicine, at the age of 32, making him the youngest winner in that field to this day.\n\nCrime: In the early 1990s, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, known as the Ken and Barbie Killers, raped and murdered three teenagers, including Homolka’s own sister. On his own, Bernardo was a prolific serial rapist, given the nicknames Scarborough Rapist and Schoolgirl Killer. The pair were convicted of their crimes, but while Bernardo was sentenced to life imprisonment, Homolka cut a controversial plea deal and only served 12 years.\n\nSports Team: Ontario is home to the most sports franchises in the country. Toronto has the Maple Leafs (NHL), Raptors (NBA), Blue Jays (MLB) and Argos (CFL), while Ottawa offers the Senators (NHL) and Redblacks (CFL). There’s also the CFL’s Hamilton Tiger Cats. The province also has the Ontario Hockey League, with 17 of the circuit’s 20 junior teams located within Ontario.\n\nAthlete: Among other options, this category has to go to Wayne Gretzky. Born in Brantford, ‘The Great One’ owns countless NHL records and is generally regarded as the greatest hockey player the game has ever seen. Gretzky won four Stanley Cups, to go along with many individual awards, over his 20-year career. When Gretzky retired, he was immediately enshrined into the Hockey Hall of Fame and his #99 jersey was retired league-wide.\n\nFamous Home: While the Canadian Prime Minister’s residence seems like an obvious choice, I’ll go in a different direction, highlighting McCrae House in Guelph. It is the childhood home of Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae, who wrote the poem In Flanders Field during World War I. Sadly, McCrae died of pneumonia before the war concluded. The home was named a National Historic Site in 1966.\n\nUrban Legend: The Baldoon Mystery is a curious tale. Taking place in the community of Wallaceburg, the story states the family farm of John T. McDonald experienced many paranormal encounters, said to result from a witch’s curse. McDonald was advised to shoot a black-headed goose with a silver bullet, which would wound the witch as well. Upon shooting a goose in its wing, McDonald came across an old woman with a broken arm and the hauntings ceased.\n\nMuseum: The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in Toronto in 1943. With the 2021 induction ceremony, a total of 417 players, builders and officials have been enshrined in the Hall. The museum also allows visitors to get close to the Stanley Cup, which reminds me of the joke that the Hall of Fame was placed in Toronto, as that’s the closest folks living there would ever get to the championship!\n\nFirsts: For a league that has only one Canadian team, it’s amazing the first-ever National Basketball Association game was played on November 1, 1946, in Toronto. The contest, played at Maple Leaf Gardens, was between the Toronto Huskies and the New York Knickerbockers, with the Knicks winning 68-66. The Huskies only lasted one season before folding and Toronto would be without a team until the Raptors were founded in 1995.\n\nCompany: As department stores go the way of the dodo, they were once major shopping institutions. All of the biggest Canadian department stores were headquartered in Ontario, including The Bay, Eaton’s and Sears. Of these, only The Bay, in existence in various forms since 1670, still exists, but they have struggled in recent years, due to discount stores and online shopping.\n\nEvents: The War of 1812, fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, featured a number of battles in Upper Canada (what is now Ontario). The war is credited for helping to create a sense of national identity in Canada. For Canadians, the war is perhaps best remembered for the burning of Washington, which included setting the White House, then known as the Presidential Mansion, and Capitol building ablaze.\n\nMiscellaneous: The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) is one of the largest film festivals in the world, highlighted by the premieres of star-studded movies and creating buzz for films leading up to the award season. The festival was founded in 1976 and today lasts 11 days in mid-September. Some notable movies to debut at TIFF, include American Beauty, Ray, Slumdog Millionaire, Precious, and The King’s Speech.\n\nOntario: Raymond Massey\n\n2 oz Canadian Whiskey\n\nDash of Ginger Syrup\n\nTop with Bubbly\n\nGarnish with a Lemon Twist\n\nThis cocktail is named after actor Raymond Massey, who was born in Toronto, where the drink enjoys its popularity. It is a variation of the classic French 75 beverage, subbing in the Canadian Whiskey and Ginger Syrup, in favour of Gin and Lemon Juice.\n\nCanadian Chauvinism\n\nMaple is a cultural icon of Canada, whether you’re talking about trees, syrup or anything else. We put it on everything, including in booze. Hell, the maple leaf is even featured on our country’s flag, giving us one of the most unique banners in the world. With national pride in mind, here are some of Canada’s greatest patriots and icons:\n\nDon Cherry\n\nCherry has about as many detractors as he does fans, but one thing everyone agrees on is that ‘Grapes’ is a staunch supporter of Canada, its hockey players, its military troops, and its national sport. He may go about this the wrong way sometimes, such as questioning the heart of European players, for example, but his heart is usually in the right place. The guy practically bleeds red and white maple leafs, which is sometimes hard to detect given the distracting nature of his wardrobe!\n\nBret Hart\n\nWrestling is full of patriotic characters, but you don’t see too many Canadians waving the ol’ red and white maple leaf too wildly. Bret Hart, however, along with his Hart Foundation stable, ventured on a unique storyline in 1997, where he criticized the United States and the fans that called the country home. This made him wildly popular in Canada and vehemently hated south of the border. For the rest of his career, Hart always wore Canadian pride on his sleeve and cemented his legendary status.\n\nWayne Gretzky\n\nAmong many great athletes, ‘The Great One’ is Canada’s most iconic and not just because he played the country’s national sport. Gretzky’s influence spread throughout the world and he can be credited with the rise of hockey’s popularity as a sport, not only across the southern United States, but also in many other countries across the globe. Gretzky represented Canada on many occasions, perhaps most notably as part of the management team that brought Olympic hockey gold back to the country after 50 years.\n\nThe Beaver\n\nAh, the majestic beaver… and let’s be clear, the Sip Advisor is actually talking about the noble dam-building animal. The North American beaver has found its way to being featured on the nation’s five-cent piece, the country’s very first postage stamp, and beaver sculptures can also be found adorning the Canadian Parliament Building. Canada also has a number of other creatures that are culturally appreciated, including Canadian geese, loons, and Canadian horses.\n\nMolson Canadian Beer\n\nThe country’s national beer might not be much to brag about, in comparison to craft beer options across the nation, but it’s still something to be more proud of than Budweiser, Coors, and many of the other beverage options our continental neighbours seem to be so satisfied with. Molson Canadian has a brewing tradition that dates back to 1959 and for many young Canucks, is the first beer they ever enjoy. The Sip Advisor is one of these people and I am forever grateful for my earliest suds.\n\nTim Hortons\n\nNothing is more Canadian than donuts! Others would insist that the company’s coffee be included as part of the national identity combo, but not the Sip Advisor. Tim Hortons has grown across the country and even into other parts of the world. With products ranging from donuts to Timbits (donut holes), as well as sandwiches, soups, muffins, cookies, and everything else in between, Tim Hortons is one international contribution that can be enjoyed across the globe.\n\nPoutine\n\nCanada can’t be given much credit for creating items that have taken over the culinary scene, but poutine is one thing we devised and have shared – to great success – with the world over. You can’t go into a pub nowadays without the place having at least one poutine dish on their menu. Even most fast food chains, such as McDonald’s and Burger King, have made the creation available for eaters on the run. Add some bacon (preferably Canadian) onto the meal and you’re ready to gorge!\n\nFlavour Revolution: Poor Sap\n\n2 oz Whiskey\n\n1 oz Maple Liqueur\n\nSplash of Grenadine\n\nDash of Bitters\n\nGarnish with a Maraschino Cherry\n\nAs a whole, Canada isn’t necessarily known for staunch patriotism… unless we’re talking about hockey and then it’s time to knuckle up. Many of our homegrown stars leave the country and never look back, trying to remove every hint of their Canadian ancestry. You will often hear debates over whether a celebrity is Canadian or not or the statement “I didn’t know he was from Canada.” The same can’t be said for the above entries.\n\nSip Advisor Bar Notes (3.5 Sips out of 5):\n\nWith three ounces of liquor, this is a strong martini, but the taste is pretty solid. Of course, I used a Canadian Whiskey (Crown Royal) for the cocktail. I might have slightly overdone it with the Bitters, but it all depends on your taste preferences. All in all, a good drink.\n\nWe’re Going Streaking\n\nAs tomorrow marks the conclusion of the 365-day cocktail project, my efforts will be included with some of the greatest streaks known the world over. In fact, it’s probably the greatest compilation ever put together in human existence… and you little sippers were all a part of history. Here are some other notable runs.\n\nCal Ripken, Jr. – 2,632 Consecutive MLB games\n\nWhile baseball lacks so many of the physical demands of other sports (hell, players spend more than half the game simply standing around and do so little that they can sometimes play two contests in one day), Cal Ripken, Jr.’s 2,632 straight games is still an amazing achievement. The streak started on May 30, 1982 and ended on Sept. 20, 1998, as the shortstop wanted to wrap it up on his own terms and avoid any controversy that may follow in the twilight of his career.\n\nDoug Jarvis – 964 Consecutive NHL games\n\nTo play that many successive games in one of the most physical sports on the planet is quite the impressive feat. When that streak spans your entire professional career (from 1975 to 1987), while winning four Stanley Cups, as well as the Selke Trophy (NHL’s top defensive forward) and Bill Masterton Trophy (awarded for perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey) that makes the record that much sweeter.\n\nBrett Favre – 297 Consecutive NFL Quarterback Starts\n\nGiven how rough and tumble professional football can be, it’s astonishing that Brett Favre was able to start 297 games in a row, all while sending pictures of his junk via cell phone to select female members of team staff. Okay, so some of Favre’s shine rubbed off (perhaps bad word choice) near the end of his career, but you can’t take away the guy’s grit and passion.\n\nJoe Dimaggio – 56-Game Hit Streak\n\nIt has been written before that the hardest thing to do in professional sports is hit a fastball. While I vehemently disagree with that assertion, I do agree that there are unique skills required to be a pro ball player and Joe Dimaggio’s streak is pretty impressive because of this. Perhaps more notable, the dude married Marilyn Monroe… not too shabby!\n\nLance Armstrong – 7-Consecutive Tour de France Victories\n\nWhile Lance Armstrong’s streak of victories has since been tainted by his steroid scandal, the man competed in a world rife with cheating and he still managed to win seven straight Tour de France titles. Armstrong’s celebrity also boosted funding for cancer treatments, so regardless of his name being sullied, he still did some great things for the world.\n\nWayne Gretzky – 51 Consecutive Game Point Streak\n\nWayne Gretzky is the most prolific scorer in NHL history, putting up so many records that will never be touched. Among those, is his 51-game point scoring streak in 1983-84. The Great One averaged 3 points per game during that run and had he sat out the rest of the season after the stretch was ended, he would have still won the scoring title by 27 points!\n\nByron Nelson – 11 Consecutive PGA Tour Wins\n\nToday, you’re likely to see a different leader atop the PGA Tour each week. To win 11 straight in today’s golfing world is totally unfathomable. Not ever Tiger Woods in his prime came anywhere near touching that mark. Nelson won 18 of 30 tournaments in 1945 and 52 throughout his PGA career. He also added 12 wins on other professional circuits.\n\nA.C. Green – 1,192 Consecutive NBA Games\n\nI think I’m more impressed with the fact the deeply religious man waited until the age of 38 to finally lose his virginity. Now THAT’S an iron man streak! Green’s foundation promotes abstinence before marriage and he was finally wed in 2002, following his playing career, which lasted from 1985-2001, including three NBA Championships.\n\nDrink #364: Iron Man Cocktail\n\n1.5 oz Amaretto (I used Disaronno)\n\n1 Shot of Orange Juice\n\nSplash of Grenadine\n\nSo, what’s next for The Sip Advisor? You’ll have to stay tuned for a big announcement on New Year’s Day. The excitement is palpable, isn’t it!?\n\nSip Advisor Bar Notes (3 Sips out of 5):\n\nThis recipe comes courtesy of The Drunken Moogle site and while it is meant for the comic and movie character Iron Man, I think it applies here, as well. Simply place the shot of Orange Juice into the Amaretto/Grenadine Mix and slam the whole concoction back. The drink is sweet, so if you have a tooth for that, you’re in luck. Most will want to have a more tart taste mixed in, so this cocktail doesn’t work for all.\n\nWelcome to Canada\n\nTo celebrate Canada Day (my home and native land) I decided to take a look at the pros and cons of this country’s make-up. Why bother looking at what needs improvement, you ask? Well, I feel we should all be always striving to better ourselves and I expect no less from my country. That, and I’m a massive jerk, who likes to rant about things that displease me. On with the ranting!\n\nPro: Hockey\n\nIf you are ever in need of defining what an athlete should be, look no further than a hockey player, preferably of the Canadian variety. There, you will see true glimpses of sportsmanship, humbleness, work ethic, ruggedness, and manliocity. Think of icons like Steve Yzerman, Joe Sakic, Gordie Howe, and ‘The Great One’ Wayne Gretzky.\n\nCon: Expensive Alcohol\n\nDo you know how much easier this 365-day liquor challenge would be if I lived in almost any other country, rather than Canada. Even Canadian manufactured products are ridiculously priced. Whenever Mrs. Sip and I travel south of the border, we make sure to grab a ton of booze because it is just so much more reasonably priced. Sadly, we have limits on what we can bring back and as a law-abiding citizen, I actually follow these allotments… for the most part!\n\nPro: Good People\n\nCanada has a reputation for its citizens being overly nice and helpful population. This standing is well-earned and as a fictional leader of this great land, I must say that I’m proud of our people and the work we all do to not only make our home a better place, but to welcome strangers from foreign lands.\n\nCon: No Dill Pickle Round Slices\n\nThere are a lot of products that I can’t find in Canada, that are available south of the border (in fact, I wrote an entire article about this phenomenon). But one that absolutely flummoxes me is the absence of dill pickles in round slices. If it can be done for sweet pickles, why not dill? Clearly dill pickles can be sliced, but all I ever see is the elongated variety. It has driven me to become an ex-pat of this great nation and must be rectified.\n\nPro: Beautiful Women\n\nI can say with full conviction that Canada has to have the most beautiful women in the universe. A long walk on a glorious summer day – with dark shades fully ensconced on my noggin’ – is an absolute treat with all the eye candy available to every red-blooded male. Sadly, that beauty gets hidden away during the cold winter months, when everyone is bundling up in toques, scarfs, and jackets, but it’s all worth it again on that first patio-suitable day of spring.\n\nCon: Inclement Weather\n\nAs mentioned above, it can get cold and nasty during the winter, up here in the Great White North. Even here in Vancouver, where we have much more mild temperatures, we live in an urban rainforest where we get drenched by buckets of cold rain every year. I know we’re not alone in the not-so-nice weather department, but that doesn’t mean I can’t bitch about it. On the bright side, if you like to ski (or just enjoy watching snow bunnies), we’ve got you covered!\n\nPro: Strip Clubs with Alcohol\n\nImagine my shock when my crew saddled up to a strip club in Seattle, Washington for my stag last year and were told that we had a choice: either see naked ladies or keep drinking. Before my friends could answer, I’d already left the lobby, en route to the next liquor establishment. Truth be told, I’m not a strip club regular, but if I do go, I want to be able to have an overpriced brew or cocktail while a young lady makes love to a pole!\n\nCon: No Singles ($1 bills)\n\nHow are you supposed to get your money’s worth at the strip club!? The smallest denomination you can tuck into a dancer’s G-string is a fiver. That means you can go through a lot of money in very little time. And don’t even think about making it rain. A small wad of fives, tens, and twenties will pale in comparison to a massive wad of American ones. I guess you could take a jar full of loonies and toonies and toss it into the air and do some serious damage!\n\nDrink #182: Red Maple Sunset\n\n1 oz Campari\n\n1 oz Maple Syrup\n\nTop with Lemon Juice\n\nSplash of Egg Whites\n\nGarnish with Canadian Flag\n\nSo, happy birthday Canada! I hope you get all the gifts you’ve wanted and that your next year is as fabulous as the last!\n\nSip Advisor Bar Notes (3.5 Sips out of 5):\n\nThis was my first opportunity to play around with not only Campari, but also Maple Syrup. The drink was a nice mix of sweet and bitter, as the Campari has a fruity taste, with a bitter finish. The Maple Syrup actually worked well with the cocktail, which was a pleasant surprise given it’s a bit of an odd ingredient."
