You got 16 days before training camp formally starts at the Ice Sports Forum in Brandon. 19 days from now, the Bolts will be playing in St. Louis, Missouri with the preseason opener against the Blues.\n\nFolks, it’s just about here. Hockey season is here. Heck, they’re putting ice down at Times Palace! How much more proof do you want?!\n\nStill a skeptic? Try this: This afternoon, the Tampa Bay Lightning announced their 2011-12 training camp roster. A total of 58 players (34 forwards, 19 defensemen, 5 goaltenders) will participate… These can change with other roster invitees added, or last-minute subtractions.\n\nThe press release from the team and the full roster is below the jump. Start your speculation, start your salivation. Start your euphoria – for hockey is about to return.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nSeptember 1, 2011\n\nContact: Brian Breseman (813.301.6871, bbreseman@sptimesforum.com)\n\nLIGHTNING ANNOUNCE 2011 TRAINING CAMP ROSTER\n\nPlayers to Hit the Ice in Brandon Sept. 17\n\nTAMPA BAY – The Tampa Bay Lightning announced the roster today for its 19th training camp, which opens with physicals and fitness testing on Friday, September 16. Though there will be optional ice available to players on the 16th, the full squad will hit the ice on Saturday, September 17.\n\nLightning fans will recognize many of the same faces from the team that carried the Bolts to within one game of the Stanley Cup Final in 2011. Captain Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, Steven Stamkos, Nate Thompson, Teddy Purcell, Ryan Malone and more return up front along with a group of high-end prospects that include Carter Ashton, Brett Connolly, Vladislav Namestnikov and Richard Panik. On the blue line, the Lightning will have a few new faces that include Matt Gilroy who comes in after spending last season with the New York Rangers as well as Bruno Gervais who skated with the New York Islanders in 2010-11. They join a defensive corps that already includes Eric Brewer, Victor Hedman, Brett Clark, Mattias Ohlund, Marc-Andre Bergeron, Pavel Kubina and more. Between the pipes, Dwayne Roloson returns as the incumbent while offseason signing Mathieu Garon enters his first Lightning camp after tending nets for the Columbus Blue Jackets last season.\n\nIn all, the Lightning training camp roster includes 58 players, made up of 34 forwards, 19 defensemen and five goaltenders. A total of 20 players who played in at least one game with Tampa Bay last season will be at the Ice Sports Forum for the start of training camp.\n\nAll on-ice sessions are open to the public. A full schedule and fan activities will be announced at a later date.\n\nTickets for the Lightning’s preseason games against the St. Louis Blues at the Amway Center in downtown Orlando on September 21 and against the Florida Panthers at the St. Pete Times Forum on September 23 are now on sale.
