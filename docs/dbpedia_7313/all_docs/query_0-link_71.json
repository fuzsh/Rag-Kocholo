        "text": "Every NHL head coach was involved in hockey at a high level prior to coaching in the world’s best hockey league. Some were NHL players, while others played major junior, collegiate, or minor pro hockey before coaching. Thus, all 32 NHL head coaches have had at least one hockey card issued sometime during either their playing or coaching careers.\n\nHere is a list of rookie cards for every head coach in the NHL. Some had mainstream “rookie cards” found in sets like Topps, O-Pee-Chee, Upper Deck, and Pro Set cards. Others did not play — or did not play long — in the NHL. In their cases, I tracked down the earliest trading card that coach had. I’ve indicated the value of each card and how difficult the card is to find today.\n\nAnaheim Ducks: Dallas Eakins\n\nRookie Card: 1997-98 Pinnacle Be A Player #86\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents (standard version)\n\n$3 (autographed version)\n\n$5 (silver autographed version)\n\n$10 (prismatic die-cut autographed version)\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ (standard)\n\n★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ (autographed)\n\n★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ (silver autographed version\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ☆ (prismatic die-cut autographed version)\n\nAge in Picture: Assuming that this photo was taken during Eakins’ second stint with the Panthers in 1997-98, he is 30 years old.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Eakins made his NHL debut in February of 1993, but didn’t get a rookie card until 1997-98. In his first six years in the NHL, he played with the Winnipeg Jets, Florida Panthers, St. Louis Blues, Jets (again), Phoenix Coyotes, New York Rangers and Panthers (again). He’d also play for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders and Calgary Flames. Talk about a journey, man!\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Edmonton Oilers (2013-14 & 2014-15); Anaheim Ducks (2019-20 to present).\n\nArizona Coyotes: André Tourigny\n\nRookie Card: 2020-21 By Cards Team Canada IIHF U20 World Championship #25\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 46 years old.\n\nAge Today: 47 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Touringy was a head coach in junior hockey for 14 years.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Arizona Coyotes (2021-22 to present).\n\nBoston Bruins: Bruce Cassidy\n\nFirst NHL Card: 1985-86 Chicago Blackhawks Team Issue Set\n\nAverage Value: $3 to $5\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nAge in Picture: Around 20 years old.\n\nAge Today: 56 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Cassidy never had a mainstream rookie card (Topps, O-Pee-Chee or otherwise) during his NHL career, but he was included in the 1985-86 Blackhawks team-issued set, despite playing just one game for the ‘Hawks in 1983-84 and then spending the entire 1984-85 season in junior. The ‘Hawks had high hopes for their former first round pick, but injuries limited him to just one NHL and four AHL games in 1985-86. This particular card is very difficult to find.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Washington Capitals (2002-03 & 2003-04); Boston Bruins (2016-17 to present).\n\nBuffalo Sabres: Don Granato\n\nSecond-Ever Card: 2000-01 Choice Worcester IceCats AHL #30. (I don’t have — and could not track down — Granato’s first-ever card, so his second-ever card will have to do here. Image courtesy of Center Ice Collectibles.)\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: Around 34 years old.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Don Granato is the younger brother of former NHLer Tony Granato and the older brother of former Olympian and Hockey Hall of Famer Cammi Granato.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Buffalo Sabres (midway through the 2020-21 season to present).\n\nCalgary Flames: Darryl Sutter\n\nRookie Card: 1981-82 O-Pee-Chee #65 & Topps #W77 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: $1 to $2.\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆☆\n\nAge in Picture: 22 years old.\n\nAge Today: 63 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Darryl is one of six Sutter Brothers to play in the NHL. His brothers Brian, Duane, Brent, Rich and Ron also played in the league. Darryl’s son Brett played in the NHL, too. Sutter’s Topps rookie card was only available in some U.S. markets due to regional distribution.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Chicago Blackhawks (1992-93 to 1994-95); San Jose Sharks (1997-98 to 2002-03); Calgary Flames (2002-03 to 2005-06); Los Angeles Kings (2011-12 to 2016-17); Calgary Flames (2020-21 to present).\n\nCarolina Hurricanes: Rod Brind’Amour\n\nRookie Cards: 1990-91 Bowman #23, O-Pee-Chee #332, Pro Set #259, Score American #131 (pictured), Score Canadian #131, Topps #332, Upper Deck #36 & Upper Deck French #36\n\nAverage Value: $1 for his Upper Deck RC — and that might be pushing it — and 25 cents each for the others.\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 19 years old.\n\nAge Today: 51 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Brind’Amour’s rookie cards came out during the 1990-91 season, and were so overproduced that they have virtually no value today.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Carolina Hurricanes (2019-20 to present).\n\nChicago Blackhawks: Derek King\n\nRookie Cards: 1989-90 Topps #6 (pictured) and O-Pee-Chee #6\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: Around 22 years old.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old.\n\nFun Facts: King played 830 regular season games in the NHL and was the last Toronto Maple Leafs player to score a goal at Maple Leaf Gardens. He was hired as Interim Head Coach of the Blackhawks after Jeremy Colliton was fired early in the 2021-22 season.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Chicago Blackhawks (2021-22 to present).\n\nColorado Avalanche: Jared Bednar\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1991-92 11 Seventh Inning Sketch WHL #11\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 19 years old.\n\nAge Today: 49 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Bednar grinded out a nine-year career playing minor league hockey, followed by another 14 years of coaching before getting a shot as an NHL coach. He played for three different teams — Spokane Chiefs, Medicine Hat Tigers and Prince Albert Raiders — during his final year of junior hockey.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Colorado Avalanche (2016-17 to present).\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets: Brad Larsen\n\nRookie Cards: 1994-95 Parkhurst SE #269, Select #164 & Upper Deck SP #187 (pictured).\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ (Parkhurst SE)\n\n★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ (Select)\n\n★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ (Upper Deck SP)\n\nAge in Picture: 17 years old.\n\nAge Today: 44 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Larsen was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in 1995, but then traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 1996. The Avalanche did not sign Larsen, so he re-entered the NHL Draft and was selected by…the Avalanche! This time, the Avs signed him. Larsen was traded three times in his career — and all three times, he was traded for a defenseman.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Columbus Blue Jackets (2021-22 to present).\n\nDallas Stars: Rick Bowness\n\nRookie Card: 1977-78 O-Pee-Chee #265\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 21 or 22 years old.\n\nAge Today: 66\n\nFun Fact: Bowness was traded from the Atlanta Flames to the Detroit Red Wings prior to the start of the 1977-78 season, so O-Pee-Chee added the text “Now with Red Wings” on Bowness’ first-ever card. It sucks when you are “traded” on your own rookie card.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Winnipeg Jets (1988-89); Boston Bruins (1991-92); Ottawa Senators (1992-93 to 1995-96); New York Islanders (1996-97 to 1997-98); Phoenix Coyotes (2003-04); Dallas Stars (2019-20 to present).\n\nDetroit Red Wings: Jeff Blashill\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 2017 By Cards IIHF World Championships Team USA #25\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 43 years old.\n\nAge Today: 47 years old.\n\nFun Fact: When I wrote about the rookie cards for every NHL coach for the 2017-18 season, Blashill did not have a card. Since then, a company in Europe called By Cards made a set of trading cards for the 2017 IIHF World Championships, and included Blashill, who coached Team USA. This is his first card after seven years of playing (three years junior and four years college) and 19 years of coaching. It took forever, but Blashill finally got a card.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Detroit Red Wings (2015-16 to present).\n\nEdmonton Oilers: Dave Tippett\n\nRookie Cards: 1986-87 Topps #148 (pictured) and O-Pee-Chee #148\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: About 25 years old.\n\nAge Today: 60 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Tippett didn’t get a rookie card until his fourth season in the NHL. He made his debut at the end of the 1983-84 season, then played 80 games in 1984-85 and another 80 games in 1985-86 before finally getting an RC in the 1986-87 sets.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Dallas Stars (2002-03 to 2008-09); Phoenix/Arizona Coyotes (2009-10 to 2016-17); Edmonton Oilers (2019-20 to present).\n\nFlorida Panthers: Andrew Brunette\n\nRookie Cards: 1996-97 Fleer #124 (pictured), Fleer Ultra #173, Skybox Impact #147 & Upper Deck #184\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: Around 22 years old.\n\nAge Today: 48 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Brunette scored the first-ever goal in Nashville Predators history. He was named Interim Head Coach of the Panthers after Joel Quenneville resigned earlier this season.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Florida Panthers (2021-22 to present).\n\nLos Angeles Kings: Todd McLellan\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1983-84 Saskatoon Blades Team Issue Set #14\n\nAverage Value: $1 to $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: Well, the card does state on the front that he is 16.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old.\n\nFun Facts: McLellan played in only five games with the Islanders, so he never had an NHL card. Funny thing is, in four years of junior hockey, two years of minor-pro hockey and 25 years of coaching at the various ranks, McLellan has exactly three hockey cards; one from juniors (pictured), one as a minor league player and one as a minor league coach.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: San Jose Sharks (2008-09 to 2014-15); Edmonton Oilers (2015-16 to 2018-19); Los Angeles Kings (2019-20 to present).\n\nMinnesota Wild: Dean Evason\n\nRookie Cards: 1987-88 Topps #166 & O-Pee-Chee #166 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents to $1\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 22 years old\n\nAge Today: 57 years old\n\nFun Facts: Evason was the captain of the Canadian National Team during the 1997 World Championships. The team won the gold medal. He has been involved in coaching for more than 20 years, though this is his first stint as an NHL head coach.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Minnesota Wild (2019-20 to present)\n\nMontreal Canadiens: Dominique Ducharme\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 2018-19 Halifax Mooseheads 25th Anniversary Team Issue Set\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: The color photo of Ducharme is from 2013, when he coached the Halifax Mooseheads to a Memorial Cup Championship. So, he would be 40 in that photo. The black-and-white picture is most likely from around that time as well.\n\nAge Today: 48 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Despite coaching the Halifax Mooseheads for five seasons, including a Memorial Cup Championship in 2013, Ducharme was never included in any of the Mooseheads regular team sets. He did not get a hockey card until the Mooseheads issued 25th Anniversary Set in 2018-19.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Montreal Canadiens (2020-21 to present).\n\nNashville Predators: John Hynes\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 2009-10 Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins #28\n\nAverage Value: $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 34 years old.\n\nAge Today: 46 years old.\n\nFun Facts: When Hynes was hired by the Devils, he was, at the time, the youngest head coach in the NHL. He played college hockey at Boston University for four years, and participated in four straight Frozen Four tournaments.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: New Jersey Devils (2015-16 to 2019-20); Nashville Predators (2019-20 to present).\n\nNew Jersey Devils: Lindy Ruff\n\nRookie Card: 1980-81 O-Pee-Chee #319\n\nAverage Value: $1\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 19 or 20 years old\n\nAge Today: 61 years old\n\nFun Facts: Even though Ruff was a regular in the NHL from 1979-80 to 1989-90, he only had mainstream hockey cards issued every other year during his career: 1980-81, 1982-83, 1984-85, 1986-87, 1988-89 and 1990-91. Ruff has coached in the NHL — either as an assistant or a head coach — for every year since 1993-94.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Buffalo Sabres (1997-98 to 2012-13); Dallas Stars (2013-14 to 2016-17); New Jersey Devils (2020-21)\n\nNew York Islanders: Barry Trotz\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1981-82 Regina Pats #21\n\nAverage Value: $1 to $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 19 years old.\n\nAge Today: 59 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Trotz played four years of junior hockey, but only appeared on one card during his playing days. Check out those sweet Cooperalls he’s wearing.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Nashville Predators (1999-2000 to 2013-14); Washington Capitals (2014-15 to 2017-18); New York Islanders (2018-19 to present).\n\nNew York Rangers: Gerard Gallant\n\nRookie Cards: 1987-88 O-Pee-Chee #67 & Topps #67 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents to $1 (either version).\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 23 years old.\n\nAge Today: 58 years old.\n\nFun Fact: It took Gallant three seasons in the NHL until he was deemed worthy enough to get a rookie card. All he had to do was lead the Red Wings in goals in 1986-87 and be an alternate captain to get the attention of the card companies. Still, both Topps and O-Pee-Chee goofed and misspelled his first name as “Gerald” instead of “Gerard.”\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Columbus Blue Jackets (2003-04 to 2006-07); Florida Panthers (2014-15 to 2016-17); Vegas Golden Knights (2017-18 to 2019-20); New York Rangers (2021-22 to present).\n\nOttawa Senators: D.J. Smith\n\nRookie Cards: 1997-98 Donruss #206, Donruss Canadian Ice #142, Donruss Limited #37 & Upper Deck #194 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: Around 20 years old.\n\nAge Today: 44 years old.\n\nFun Fact: Smith played 8 games for the Maple Leafs in 1996-97, which was good enough to be included in some card sets next season. All of his cards from junior call him “Denis Smith” instead of “D.J. Smith.”\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Ottawa Senators (2019-20 to present).\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers: Alain Vigneault\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1987-88 Hull Olympiques #20\n\nAverage Value: $3\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\nAge in Picture: 26 years old.\n\nAge Today: 60 years old.\n\nFun Fact: These cards were given out by the Police in the Hull area. In lieu of statistics, these had safety tips on the back. The advice on the back of Vigneault’s card, translated from French, says “Did you know that the mixture of alcohol + drugs = death!”\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Montreal Canadiens (1997-98 to 2000-01); Vancouver Canucks (2006-07 to 2012-13); New York Rangers (2013-14 to 2017-18); Philadelphia Flyers (2019-20 to present).\n\nPittsburgh Penguins: Mike Sullivan\n\nRookie Card: 1991-92 Parkhurst #383\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 23 or 24 years old.\n\nAge Today: 53 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Despite playing in 64 games with the San Jose Sharks in 1991-92 — 6th most on the team — only Parkhurst bothered to make a card of Sullivan that year. The back of the card states that Sullivan “appears to be on his way towards a solid NHL career.” That turned out to be true, since he played in 709 NHL games; but even more so if you consider his back-to-back Stanley Cup Championships as the Penguins’ head coach.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Boston Bruins (2003-04 & 2005-06); Pittsburgh Penguins (2015-16 to present).\n\nSan Jose Sharks: Bob Boughner\n\nRookie Card: 1996-97 Be A Player #178\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents (standard version)\n\n$3 (autographed version)\n\n$5 (silver autographed version)\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ (standard version)\n\n★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ (autographed version)\n\n★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆ (silver autographed version)\n\nAge in Picture: 24 or 25 years old.\n\nAge Today: 50 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Boughner toiled in the minor leagues for five seasons with four different teams before getting his shot in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Florida Panthers (2017-18 to 2018-19); San Jose Sharks (2019-20 to present).\n\nSeattle Kraken: Dave Hakstol\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1992-93 Indianapolis Ice Team Issue Set\n\nAverage Value: $15 — yes, you read that right.\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 24 years old.\n\nAge Today: 53 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Since Hakstol is the first-ever head coach for the Seattle Kraken, naturally there has been a bump in interest in his cards. However, his only cards were either issued by minor league or collegiate teams and aren’t printed in the same quantities as, say, Rod Brind’Amour’s rookie cards from 1990-91. So, this minor league card of Hakstol isn’t very easy to find, and one sold on eBay late last month for $15. It isn’t a card that shows up for sale too often, so Kraken fans wanting this card will look hard and be patient.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Philadelphia Flyers (2015-16 to 2018-19); Seattle Kraken (2021-22 to present).\n\nSt. Louis Blues: Craig Berube\n\nRookie Card: 1990-91 O-Pee-Chee #448, Pro Set #498 (pictured), Upper Deck #450\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 24 or 25 years old.\n\nAge Today: 55 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Berube started the 2018-19 season as an Associate Coach for the Blues, was promoted to interim head coach when Mike Yeo was fired, then named head coach for real when the Blues won the Stanley Cup.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Philadelphia Flyers (2013-14 & 2014-15); St. Louis Blues (2018-19 to present).\n\nTampa Bay Lightning: Jon Cooper\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 2010-11 Norfolk Admirals #10\n\nAverage Value: $1 to $2\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 43 years old.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old\n\nFun Fact: Cooper has exactly two hockey cards to his name — and he is in almost the exact same pose on both of his cards.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Tampa Bay Lightning (2012-13 to present)\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: Sheldon Keefe\n\nRookie Cards: 1999-2000 Black Diamond #96, MVP Stanley Cup Edition #195, Ovation #64, SP Authentic #123, Topps #264 (pictured), Upper Deck #309, Ultimate Victory #107 & Victory #361\n\nAverage Value: 50 cents to $1 for most; $2 for his Black Diamond RC.\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 19 years old\n\nAge Today: 41 years old\n\nFun Fact: Even though Keefe is pictured with his junior team, the Barrie Colts, this is considered his “NHL Rookie Card” because it was a part of a licensed set of NHL trading cards. Confusing? Yes it is!\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Toronto Maple Leafs (2019-20 to present)\n\nVancouver Canucks: Travis Green\n\nRookie Cards: 1992-93 Fleer Ultra #343 & Parkhurst #343 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents.\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 22 years old.\n\nAge Today: 50 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Green had two cards issued during his rookie year. The cards were released by competing companies, but coincidentally are both number 343 in each set.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Vancouver Canucks (2018-19 to present).\n\nVegas Golden Knights: Peter DeBoer\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1989-90 ProCards IHL #189\n\nAverage Value: $1\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 21 years old.\n\nAge Today: 53 years old\n\nFun Facts: DeBoer was drafted by the Maple Leafs in 1988, and traded to the Canucks in 1989, but didn’t crack the lineup for either team. His earliest card pictures him with the Milwaukee Admirals of the old International Hockey League.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Florida Panthers (2008-09 to 2010-11); New Jersey Devils (2011-12 to 2014-15); San Jose Sharks (2015-16 to 2019-20); Vegas Golden Knights (2020-21).\n\nWashington Capitals: Peter Laviolette\n\nRookie Cards: 1993-94 Fleer PowerPlay #508 & Fleer Ultra #488 (pictured)\n\nAverage Value: 25 cents\n\nRarity: ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 29 years old.\n\nAge Today: 56 years old.\n\nFun Fact: P-Lav played 12 games with the Rangers in 1988-89, but did not get a rookie card until the 1993-94 season, when he captained Team USA at the 1994 Winter Olympics. That year, card company Fleer included players from Team USA and Team Canada in its PowerPlay and Ultra sets. This is considered one of Laviolette’s two rookies card, even though it actually came out five years after he played in the NHL.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: New York Islanders (2001-02 & 2002-03); Carolina Hurricanes (2003-04 to 2008-09); Philadelphia Flyers (2009-10 to 2013-14); Nashville Predators (2014-15 to 2019-20); Washington Capitals (2020-21).\n\nWinnipeg Jets: Paul Maurice\n\nFirst-Ever Card: 1993-94 Detroit Jr. Red Wings #23\n\nAverage Value: $1\n\nRarity: ★ ★ ★ ☆ ☆\n\nAge in Picture: 26 years old.\n\nAge Today: 54 years old.\n\nFun Facts: Maurice wore two hats, as both the head coach and general manager of the OHL’s Detroit Jr. Red Wings.\n\nNHL Head Coaching Experience: Hartford Whalers (1995-96 & 1996-97); Carolina Hurricanes (1997-98 to 2003-04); Toronto Maple Leafs (2006-07 & 2007-08); Carolina Hurricanes (2008-09 to 2011-12); Winnipeg Jets (2013-14 to present).\n\nJust a few notes about card values and rarity.\n\nCard values are based on recent eBay sales, historical sales data from Check Out My Cards, and sales prices from the Beckett Marketplace and at Center Ice Collectibles, which specializes in team-issued cards. As you can see, most of these cards do not sell for more than $2.\n\nAs for rarity, that is based on my experience on how easy or hard it is for me to find a card. Even though I live in Chicago, that Bruce Cassidy card was difficult for me to find. It was given away at a Blackhawks home game in 1985, but it didn’t exactly grow on trees. Contrast that to the rookie cards of Rod Brind’Amour or Craig Berube, which were printed in the tens of thousands.\n\nHowever, rarity is not always an indicator of value. Alain Vigneault’s card is tough to find, but isn’t something that most card collectors seek out. And while Dave Hakstol’s first card selling for $15 seems more like an outlier, keep in mind that the card is tough to find and he’s the first head coach of a popular new team.\n\nSo, which rookie card from this list do you like the best?
