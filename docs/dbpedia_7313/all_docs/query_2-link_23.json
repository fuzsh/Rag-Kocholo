        "text": "As the NHL offseason approaches, veteran netminder Brian Elliott appears to be calling it a career after 16 remarkable seasons. St. Louis Blues general manager Doug Armstrong confirmed today that the team has hired Elliott in a goalie development and scouting role, signaling the end of his playing days and the beginning of a new chapter in his hockey journey.\n\nElliott last played in the NHL with the Tampa Bay Lightning during the 2022-23 season. After not being re-signed, he became an unrestricted free agent and did not play during the 2023-24 campaign. This hiatus from the ice set the stage for his transition into a mentoring and scouting role.\n\nEdmonton Oilers Begin Extension Talks with Leon Draisaitl\n\nSt. Louis Blues Considering Trading Brandon Saad\n\nOttawa Senators Start Shopping Seventh Overall Pick\n\nEarly Career and College Success\n\nSelected by the Ottawa Senators in the ninth round of the fabled 2003 NHL Draft, Elliott’s journey to the NHL was not straightforward. His path began with a standout college career at the University of Wisconsin, where he was pivotal in leading the Badgers to the 2006 national championship. His stellar performance that season earned him a finalist spot for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top player in the NCAA. This collegiate success laid a strong foundation for his professional career.\n\nTransition to the NHL\n\nTurning pro with Ottawa, Elliott made his NHL debut in the 2007-08 season, playing one game but showcasing his potential. He became a full-time NHL goaltender in the 2008-09 season, splitting time with Alex Auld and Martin Gerber. He posted a solid 16-8-3 record with a .902 SV% and a 2.77 GAA in 31 games. His promising performance earned him the starting role for the Senators in the 2009-10 season.\n\nChallenges and Trade to Colorado\n\nElliott’s tenure as the Senators’ starter continued into the 2010-11 campaign, but his performance dipped amidst the team’s struggles. Despite his efforts, the Senators’ underpowered offense and his .894 SV% that season were far below the league average. In a move to shake up their goaltending situation, Ottawa traded him to the Colorado Avalanche in a one-for-one swap for Craig Anderson shortly before the 2011 trade deadline. Unfortunately, Elliott’s time in Denver was brief and challenging, winning just two of his 12 games with a .891 SV%. The Avalanche decided to let him walk as a free agent that offseason.\n\nResurgence with the St. Louis Blues\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Elliott signed a one-year, two-way deal with the St. Louis Blues, a move that would become one of the best value signings in club history. Under the guidance of Blues’ general manager Doug Armstrong, Elliott quickly proved his worth. Initially brought in as a backup to Jaroslav Halák, Elliott’s exceptional performance forced a goaltending tandem. He posted a league-best .940 SV% and 1.56 GAA in 38 appearances during the 2011-12 season, earning the Jennings Trophy alongside Halák for the fewest goals allowed by a team. Elliott also finished fifth in Vezina Trophy voting, solidifying his reputation as a top-tier goaltender.\n\nPeak Years and Consistency\n\nElliott’s tenure with the Blues was marked by consistent excellence. Over five seasons, he made 164 starts and 17 relief appearances, compiling a sparkling 104-46-16 record behind one of the league’s better teams in the mid-2010s. His stats in a Blues uniform were impressive: a .925 SV%, a 2.01 GAA, and 25 shutouts. Elliott’s stellar play helped the Blues make the playoffs each season he was there, including a memorable run to the Western Conference Final in 2016. During that playoff run, Elliott posted a .921 SV% and a 2.44 GAA in 18 postseason games, further cementing his legacy in St. Louis.\n\nLater Career and Final Seasons\n\nDespite his success, the emergence of Jake Allen as a promising young goaltender made Elliott expendable. The Blues traded him to the Calgary Flames in exchange for draft picks, one of which turned into current Blues star Jordan Kyrou. Elliott’s career continued with stints in Calgary, Philadelphia, and Tampa Bay. In Calgary, he played 49 games in the 2016-17 season, posting a respectable .910 SV% and a 2.55 GAA. His time with the Philadelphia Flyers saw him in a more transitional role, where he provided veteran leadership and stability in net.\n\nElliott’s final NHL season was with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2022-23, where he played 22 games, posting a .891 SV% and a 3.40 GAA. Though his performance dipped, his experience and presence were invaluable to the team.\n\nLegacy and Future\n\nElliott’s career stats reflect his resilience and skill. Over 16 seasons, he played 543 games, with a 281-179-60 record, a .910 SV%, and a 2.55 GAA. His journey from a late-round draft pick to a respected veteran underscores his dedication and impact on the game.\n\nAs Elliott transitions to his new role with the Blues, he leaves behind a legacy of excellence and mentorship for future generations of goaltenders. His experience and knowledge of the game will undoubtedly be an asset to the Blues’ organization, as he helps develop the next wave of goaltending talent and contributes to the team’s scouting efforts."
