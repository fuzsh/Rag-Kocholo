        "text": "Former Louisville and Tulsa football coach Steve Kragthorpe has died at 59.\n\nBoth schools announced his death, which came Sunday night, on social media.\n\nHe was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011.\n\nA Montana native, Kragthorpe played quarterback at Eastern New Mexico and Western Texas in the mid-1980s before beginning his coaching career at Northern Arizona in 1990. He rose through the college coaching ranks and spent two seasons as quarterback coach of the Buffalo Bills (2001-02) before being hired as head coach at Tulsa.\n\nHe was asked to turn around a Golden Hurricane program that went 2-21 in the two previous seasons and delivered in his first season with an 8-5 record and a bowl berth. In all, he led Tulsa to a 29-22 mark and three bowl games in four seasons (2003-06) before being named head coach at Louisville.\n\nKragthorpe was inducted into Tulsa's Hall of Fame earlier this year.\n\n\"We are truly heartbroken at the loss of a TU Hall of Fame Coach who rekindled the championship spirit of Tulsa Football in a remarkably short period of time,\" athletic director Justin Moore said in a school statement. \"Our deepest sympathies go out to Coach Kragthorpe's family, friends and former players during this difficult time.\"\n\nHe spent three seasons (2007-09) at Louisville and tallied a 15-21 record. He later coached quarterbacks at LSU (2011-12) but stepped down after two years and moved into an off-field role with the Tigers."
