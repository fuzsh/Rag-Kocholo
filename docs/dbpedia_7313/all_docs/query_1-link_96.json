        "text": "Aug. 28, 2012\n\nBOSTON - Head coach Jack Parker has announced that nine newcomers will comprise the Class of 2016 for the Boston University men's ice hockey program. The group includes five forwards, two defensemen and two goaltenders.\n\n\"It's safe to say that we have very high expectations for this year's incoming group,\" said Parker, who enters his 40th season as head coach of the Terriers. \"We got what we needed in numbers and we've gotten better in overall depth up front. We've added two highly skilled defensemen and changed the look of our team a little bit with more physical forwards.\"\n\nFive of this year's newcomers were selected in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft this summer and three members of that group helped Team USA capture its fourth straight gold medal at the U-18 World Championship. The two goaltenders in the class were standouts in their respective leagues (BCHL, USHL) and will be counted on to excel while quickly adjusting to the college game.\n\n\"The importance of the two goaltenders makes or breaks the class because that position is so important, but we think we got two real good ones,\" added Parker.\n\nThe team returns to campus this week and will begin preparations for the 2012-13 season, which begins with a home exhibition against the University of Toronto on Sunday, Oct. 7.\n\nMatt Grzelcyk\n\nD &#149; 5-9 &#149; 171 &#149; Charlestown, Mass. &#149; U.S. National Under-18 Team\n\nTallied 23 points (3g, 20a) last season in 60 games with the Under-18 Team ...

He'll get power-play time and he's a real smart defensive player on the initial rush, down low, killing penalties. He'll get a lot of ice time right off the bat. He's a guy who has a lot of poise and gives his teammates a lot of confidence.\"\n\nSam Kurker\n\nF &#149; 6-2 &#149; 208 &#149; Reading, Mass. &#149; St. John's Prep\n\nLed St. John's in scoring with a 32-28&shy;--60 line in 24 games as a senior last season ...

It doesn't matter where you put him, he'll produce points and give us a physical presence. We were originally going to take him next year, but he was playing so well we decided to take him now.\"\n\nMatt Lane\n\nF &#149; 5-10 &#149; 170 &#149; Rochester, N.Y. &#149; U.S. National Under-18 Team\n\nTotaled 30 points (13g, 17a) in 59 games with the Under-18 Team last season ...

He's a very talented, strong-skating left wing who really came on in the second half of the year for the Under-18 Team. He performed extremely well in the international tournaments and he's going to bring strength, speed and a pretty good scoring touch to the forward group.\"\n\nSean Maguire\n\nG &#149; 6-2 &#149; 202 &#149; Powell River, B.C. &#149; Powell River Kings (BCHL)\n\nPlayed two seasons with Powell River, posting a record of 27-15-1 with a 2.39 goals-against average and a .910 save percentage in 52 games ...

Two-time co-winner of the BCHL's Wally Forslund Memorial Trophy (lowest combined GAA) ... Selected by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the fourth round (113th overall) in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nParker on Maguire: \"Maguire's a big guy who fills a lot of the net and he's got a lot of talent. He had a real good junior career in Canada. We've known him for a couple of years and really like him. We knew we were coming to this point where we were losing two senior goalies and we were very fortunate to get him.\"\n\nMike Moran\n\nF &#149; 6-1 &#149; 200 &#149; Marshfield, Mass. &#149; Bay State Breakers (EJHL)\n\nPlayed 2011-12 season in BCHL with Victoria Grizzlies - where he was an assistant captain and on same line as fellow BU recruit Wesley Myron - and Penticton Vees, tallying a combined 46 points (18g, 28a) in 39 contests, before returning to Massachusetts to join Bay State (11-4--15 in 18 games) for the end of their season ... 2010-11 team captain at Taft School, where he scored a team-high 13 goals and tied for team lead in points with 23 ...

Nephew of BU associate head coach Mike Bavis.\n\nParker on Moran \"Moran's a hard-nosed, big, strong skater. He's going to give us depth on the wing. He could establish himself pretty early as filling a void that we have, and that's size and physical play.\"\n\nWesley Myron\n\nF &#149; 6-2 &#149; 190 &#149; Victoria, B.C. &#149; Victoria Grizzlies (BCHL)\n\nPlayed three seasons for hometown Grizzlies, centering a line in 2011-12 that included fellow BU newcomer Mike Moran ...

He's a good puck handler and a good point producer. He should fit in on the power play and be on our top three lines for sure.\"\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nG &#149; 6-5 &#149; 195 &#149; Toronto, Ont. &#149; Youngstown Phantoms (USHL)\n\nSpent last two seasons with Youngstown, helping Phantoms reach 2012 USHL Eastern Conference semifinals ...

He was the backstop of a pretty good USHL team, but he was the go-to guy for that team. He saw a lot of pucks. He had a real good career there, and despite an injury that kept him back a little bit, he emerged as one of the premier goalies in the league. We're confident that he and Maguire can give us a one-two punch right off the bat.\"\n\nAhti Oksanen\n\nD &#149; 6-3 &#149; 195 &#149; Espoo, Finland &#149; Espoo Blues (Jr. A SM-Liiga)\n\nTop scoring defenseman for Espoo Blues U20s in 2011-12 with 41 points (14g, 27a) in 51 games ...

He will fill the gap left behind by Adam Clendening's early departure.\"\n\nDanny O'Regan\n\nF &#149; 5-10 &#149; 175 &#149; Needham, Mass. &#149; St. Sebastian's\n\nJoined the U.S. National Under-18 Team after a standout career at St. Sebastian's ...
