        "text": "NHL PLAYER, Ryan O'Reilly\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn Feb 07, 1991 -- Clinton, Ontario, Canada\n\nSelected by Colorado Avalanche round 2 #33 overall 2009 NHL Entry Draft\n\nRyan O'Reilly (born February 7, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre who plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League. He is the younger brother of former NHL player Cal O'Reilly.\n\nO'Reilly was drafted 33rd overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft by the Colorado Avalanche. O'Reilly became the youngest player in Avalanche history to appear in a regular season game when he surprisingly made the opening night roster for the 2009–10 season. Ryan earned his first NHL point in his Avalanche debut on October 1, 2009 against the San Jose Sharks, becoming the first non-first round draft pick to immediately make the NHL in his post-draft year since Patrice Bergeron in 2003–04. He scored his first NHL goal, a game winner, on October 15, 2009 against Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens. On October 19, 2009, following his strong play, the Avalanche announced that O'Reilly and his fellow 2009 draftee Matt Duchene would spend the entire season with the Avalanche. Initially leading all rookie forwards in scoring through October, O'Reilly recorded an assist in a 3-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on October 24, to cap a 7 game point streak, that stood as the longest by a rookie throughout the season.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, O'Reilly signed a two-year offer sheet with the Calgary Flames worth $10 Million. With a game coinciding between the two clubs on that day, the Avalanche announced during the contest that they opted to forgo compensation and secured O'Reilly to a contract by matching the Flames offer sheet.\n\nO'Reilly made his international debut at the 2008 World U-17 Hockey Challenge scoring 6 points in 6 games as captain of gold winning Team Ontario. As an underage 17 year old, O'Reilly gained selection to Team Canada the 2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in Slovakia. He scored 5 points in 4 games as and was named game MVP in the final against Russia as he helped Canada capture the Gold Medal for the fourth time in five years.\n\nThe following year Ryan was selected as captain of Team Canada, at the 2009 IIHF World U18 Championships. In 6 games he contributed with 5 points before finishing in fourth place after losing 5-4 in the bronze medal game against Finland.\n\nOn June 26, 2015, the Avalanche traded O'Reilly, alongside Jamie McGinn, to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Nikita Zadorov, forward Mikhail Grigorenko, prospect J. T. Compher and the 31st pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nOn July 2, O'Reilly then signed a seven-year contract extension with Buffalo worth $52.5 million, which comes into effect for the 2016–17 season. O'Reilly's signing came on the same day as the Sabres organization signed his brother Cal O'Reilly to a two-year contract.\n\nAfter three seasons with the Sabres, O'Reilly was traded by Buffalo to the St Louis Blues in exchange for Tage Thompson, Vladimír Sobotka, Patrik Berglund, a 2019 1st round draft pick, and a 2021 2nd round draft pick.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nNEWS"
