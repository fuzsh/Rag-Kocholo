        "text": "2011â12 NHL seasonLeague National Hockey LeagueSport Ice hockeyDuration October 6, 2011 â June 11, 2012Number of games 82Number of teams 30Regular seasonPresidents' Trophy Vancouver CanucksSeason MVP Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh)Top scorer Evgeni Malkin (Pittsburgh)PlayoffsEastern champions New Jersey Devils Eastern runners-up New York RangersWestern champions Los Angeles Kings Western runners-up Phoenix CoyotesPlayoffs Playoffs MVP Jonathan Quick (Los Angeles)Stanley CupChampions Los Angeles Kings Runners-up New Jersey Devils\n\nThe 2011â12 NHL season was the 95th season of operation (94th season of play) of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Los Angeles Kings defeated the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup Final four games to two to win the team's first Stanley Cup (in their second Stanley Cup final; they had lost to Montreal Canadiens in the 1993 Finals).\n\nDuring the off-season, the Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, to become the Winnipeg Jets. It was the first NHL team relocation since the 1997â98 season, when the Hartford Whalers relocated to become the Carolina Hurricanes. The league did not change its divisional structure to accommodate the move, and the Jets took the place of the Thrashers in the Southeast Division. In December 2011, the board of governors eventually approved a proposed realignment for the following season, which would result in four conferences with the first two rounds of the playoffs being divisional, but this was rejected by the NHL Player's Association (NHLPA).\n\nIt was the fifth consecutive season with games in Europe at the start of the season. The Winter Classic was held on January 2, 2012, in Philadelphia between the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers. The 59th All-Star Game was held at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa, Ontario, the home arena of the Ottawa Senators, on January 29, 2012.\n\nLeague business\n\nFranchise relocation\n\nAtlanta Spirit, LLC, which previously owned the Atlanta Thrashers, sold the team to True North Sports and Entertainment, who relocated them to the True North-owned MTS Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba[1] and renamed the Winnipeg Jets, after a previous NHL team in the market. Winnipeg took Atlanta's place in the Southeast Division for 2011â12.[2]\n\nSalary cap\n\nOn June 23, 2011, the NHL announced that the salary cap would be increased by $4.9 million. As a result, the new salary cap ceiling was set at $64.3 million while the salary cap floor was $48.3 million.[3]\n\nUniform changes\n\nSeveral teams announced plans to change their uniforms in the 2011â12 season.[4]\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers unveiled a new away uniform parallel to their \"retro\" home uniform used from 1979 to 1996. They retained the navy blue, copper and red uniforms as their alternates.\n\nThe Nashville Predators unveiled new home and away uniforms on June 22, complete with the updated saber-toothed cat logo. Their use of gold as the home colors marked the first time since 1988 that an NHL team wore gold in their home uniforms.\n\nThe Florida Panthers made minor changes to their home uniform, using red as the primary and relegating navy blue as a trim color.\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings returned to the silver and black motif they used from 1988 to 1998, by designating their alternate home black and silver uniform as a regular uniform and unveiling a new white away uniform with black and silver trim. The purple and black uniform were retained as an alternate uniform.\n\nThe Ottawa Senators unveiled a new alternate home uniform based on the original Senators barber pole design. The uniform does not use the Roman centurion logo, instead using an outlined \"O\" on stripes. The Senators' uniform will also have an All-Star Game patch.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins promoted their dark blue uniforms, worn during the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, as the home alternates, replacing the 2008 NHL Winter Classic alternates.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning unveiled new home and road uniforms, featuring the simplified lightning logo. Originally the uniforms were simply blue and white, but by popular demand, black was added as a trim color to the uniform numbers, and added the lightning bolt to the pants. The \"Bolts\" alternate home uniform was retained.\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs unveiled a new alternate home uniform based on the Leafs uniforms worn during their run to the 1967 Stanley Cup title, including the 11-point maple leaf logo.\n\nThe Washington Capitals also promoted their 2011 NHL Winter Classic retro uniforms as their road alternates.\n\nThe new Winnipeg Jets unveiled uniforms consisting of navy with silver and light blue trim, containing a logo based on the roundel of the Royal Canadian Air Force; these were significantly different from, but in a similar color scheme to, the original Jets uniforms.\n\nThe New York Islanders unveiled a new black alternate uniform, featuring the team name above the player's number, a similar template the Dallas Stars' uniforms currently use. Speaking of the Stars, they officially retired their alternate away jersey featuring the team crest, instead using their regular away jerseys with the city name and number in front for all 41 road games.\n\nThe New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers wore special commemorative uniforms for the 2012 NHL Winter Classic. The Flyers unveiled theirs on November 21, and is in a classic sweater design in orange featuring black numbers and different striping patterns on the yoke. The Rangers unveiled theirs on November 28, and features a mix of designs used from previous jerseys. The shield logo in front is a variation of the logos used during the 1930sâ1940s, while the shoulder, arm and tail striping was taken from the current jersey. Both teams would wear their Winter Classic uniforms again on February 5 and 11 at Madison Square Garden and Wells Fargo Center respectively, with the away team wearing the regular uniforms.\n\nIn addition several teams sported memorial patches throughout the season; many of these memorials were for related events (see \"Off-Season\" section below). Unless specified, the patches were seen on the team helmets:\n\nAnaheim Ducks â Ruslan Salei (24) memorial on uniforms\n\nCalgary Flames â Harley Hotchkiss (HH) memorial\n\nCarolina Hurricanes â Josef Vasicek (63) memorial; worn on uniforms\n\nDallas Stars â Karlis Skrastins (37) memorial\n\nDetroit Red Wings â Brad McCrimmon, Ruslan Salei and Stefan Liv (BMÂ·RSÂ·SL) memorial; worn on uniforms\n\nMinnesota Wild â Pavol Demitra (38) and Derek Boogaard (24) memorials\n\nNashville Predators â Wade Belak (3) memorial\n\nNew York Islanders â 40th anniversary of the franchise; worn on uniforms\n\nNew York Rangers â Derek Boogaard (94) memorial\n\nVancouver Canucks â Rick Rypien (37) memorial\n\nWinnipeg Jets â Rick Rypien (RR) memorial\n\nSt. Louis Blues â Pavol Demitra and Igor Korolev (38) memorial\n\nFurthermore, a new league-wide rule required that player numbers be displayed on the front of their helmets, as well as on the back.\n\nEven though the New Jersey Devils and the Phoenix Coyotes unveiled anniversary logos commemorating their 30th and 15th anniversaries of their respective relocations from Colorado and Winnipeg, they opted not to use them on their uniforms or helmets.\n\nRule changes\n\nBoarding\n\nPrior to the 2011â12 season, the Board of Governors unanimously agreed to update and re-word rule 41 involving boarding penalties. The new wording requires the player delivering the check to avoid or minimize contact if the opponent is defenseless.[5]\n\nIllegal hits to the head\n\nThe Board of Governors also approved an update to rule 48 involving illegal checks to the head. The new rule will penalize all hits where the head is the principal point of contact. The previous version of this rule only made checks from the blindside illegal. However, determination if the check is legal will depend on various factors including whether or not the player put himself in a vulnerable position or if the hit was unavoidable. A two-minute minor penalty, or a major penalty in the event the hit was deemed to be deliberate with intent to injure, may be assessed.[5]\n\nOff-season\n\nThree young (under 40) \"enforcer\"-type players died within a four month span during the off-season. The deaths of Derek Boogaard, Rick Rypien and Wade Belak led to speculation about the effect of fighting on the mental health of players.\n\nSeveral former NHL players died in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster involving the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team in Russia. Those who perished in the plane crash included NHL All-Star Pavol Demitra, Alexander Karpovtsev, Igor Korolev, Brad McCrimmon, Karel Rachunek, Ruslan Salei, Karlis Skrastins and Josef Vasicek.\n\nPre-season\n\nEuropean exhibition games\n\nThe four teams going to Europe to open their regular seasons there as part of the NHL Premiere games also played exhibition games against European teams under the banner of NHL Premiere Challenge to close out their pre-seasons. The NHL teams had an overall record of 6â1â0 against the European teams, with the New York Rangers, playing four games in five days in four countries, having a record of 3â1â0.\n\nDate City NHL team European team Score September 29 Prague, Czech Republic New York Rangers HC Sparta Praha 2â0 September 30 Gothenburg, Sweden New York Rangers FrÃ¶lunda HC 4â2 October 2 Bratislava, Slovakia New York Rangers HC Slovan Bratislava 4â1 October 3 Zug, Switzerland New York Rangers EV Zug 4â8 October 4 Helsinki, Finland Anaheim Ducks Jokerit 4â3 OT October 4 Hamburg, Germany Los Angeles Kings Hamburg Freezers 5â4 October 4 Mannheim, Germany Buffalo Sabres Adler Mannheim 8â3\n\nRegular season\n\nPremiere games\n\nMain article: 2011 NHL Premiere\n\nFour teams participated in the 2011 Compuware NHL Premiere in Europe. The Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings and New York Rangers made their second trip to Europe while the Buffalo Sabres made its first trip. On October 7, Anaheim played Buffalo at Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland, and Los Angeles faced New York at the Ericsson Globe Arena in Stockholm, Sweden. All four teams played again on October 8 with Los Angeles against Buffalo at the O2 World Arena in Berlin, Germany, and Anaheim against New York in Stockholm.[6]\n\nThanksgiving Showdown\n\nAs part of the league's updated television contract, the NHL debuted the Thanksgiving Showdown, a nationally-broadcast game on the day after American Thanksgiving in 2011. The game, which was sponsored by Discover, featured the Boston Bruins (who have traditionally hosted Black Friday matinÃ©es since 1990) hosting the Detroit Red Wings, with Detroit winning the game in a shootout, 3â2.\n\n2012 Winter Classic\n\nThe 2012 NHL Winter Classic was held at the Citizens Bank Park baseball stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Monday, January 2, 2012. This season, the Philadelphia Flyers hosted the New York Rangers. It was the first Winter Classic game for the Rangers and the second for the Flyers. The result of the game was a 3â2 Ranger victory. Philadelphia last played in the 2010 NHL Winter Classic against the Boston Bruins at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts. The Bruins won that game in overtime by a score of 2â1 on a goal scored by Marco Sturm.[7]\n\nThis was the first time that the Winter Classic was not played on New Year's Day, which fell on a Sunday in 2012. If the Winter Classic was held on New Year's Day, it would have conflicted with the final game of the National Football League season (in which the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Washington Redskins at nearby Lincoln Financial Field), and the annual Mummers Parade in downtown Philadelphia. The FlyersâRangers rivalry is one of the NHL's most frequently televised rivalries on U.S. television networks; it was televised three times nationally on NBC in 2011â12, including the inaugural Hockey Day in America.\n\nNo Heritage Classic was played this season.[8]\n\nStandings\n\nEach of the 30 teams play an 82-game season of an unbalanced schedule. Teams play six games against division opponents; four games against other conference opponents; and one or two games against teams of the other conference. The first-place teams in each division place first, second and third in the conference standings. The top five finishers from the rest of the teams in each conference will also qualify for the playoffs, making a total of eight playoff teams in each conference.\n\nEastern Conference[9] R Div GP W L OTL ROW GF GA Pts 1 z â New York Rangers AT 82 51 24 7 47 226 187 109 2 y â Boston Bruins NE 82 49 29 4 40 269 202 102 3 y â Florida Panthers SE 82 38 26 18 32 203 227 94 4 Pittsburgh Penguins AT 82 51 25 6 42 282 221 108 5 Philadelphia Flyers AT 82 47 26 9 43 264 232 103 6 New Jersey Devils AT 82 48 28 6 36 228 209 102 7 Washington Capitals SE 82 42 32 8 38 222 230 92 8 Ottawa Senators NE 82 41 31 10 35 249 240 92 8.5 9 Buffalo Sabres NE 82 39 32 11 32 218 230 89 10 Tampa Bay Lightning SE 82 38 36 8 35 235 281 84 11 Winnipeg Jets SE 82 37 35 10 33 225 246 84 12 Carolina Hurricanes SE 82 33 33 16 32 213 243 82 13 Toronto Maple Leafs NE 82 35 37 10 31 231 264 80 14 New York Islanders AT 82 34 37 11 27 203 255 79 15 Montreal Canadiens NE 82 31 35 16 26 212 226 78\n\nDivisions: AT â Atlantic, NE â Northeast, SE â Southeast\n\nbold - qualified for playoffs, y â Clinched division, z â Clinched conference (and division)\n\nWestern Conference[10] R Div GP W L OTL ROW GF GA Pts 1 p â Vancouver Canucks NW 82 51 22 9 43 249 198 111 2 y â St. Louis Blues CE 82 49 22 11 45 210 165 109 3 y â Phoenix Coyotes PA 82 42 27 13 36 216 204 97 4 Nashville Predators CE 82 48 26 8 43 237 210 104 5 Detroit Red Wings CE 82 48 28 6 39 248 203 102 6 Chicago Blackhawks CE 82 45 26 11 38 248 238 101 7 San Jose Sharks PA 82 43 29 10 34 228 210 96 8 Los Angeles Kings PA 82 40 27 15 34 194 179 95 8.5 9 Calgary Flames NW 82 37 29 16 34 202 226 90 10 Dallas Stars PA 82 42 35 5 35 211 222 89 11 Colorado Avalanche NW 82 41 35 6 32 208 220 88 12 Minnesota Wild NW 82 35 36 11 24 177 226 81 13 Anaheim Ducks PA 82 34 36 12 31 204 231 80 14 Edmonton Oilers NW 82 32 40 10 27 212 239 74 15 Columbus Blue Jackets CE 82 29 46 7 25 202 262 65\n\nDivisions: CE â Central, NW â Northwest, PA â Pacific\n\nbold - qualified for playoffs, y â Won division, p â Won Presidents' Trophy (best record in NHL)\n\nAttendance\n\nTeamArenaHome GamesAverage AttendanceTotal AttendanceCapacity Percentage Chicago Blackhawks United Center 41 21,533 882,874 109.2% [11] Montreal Canadiens Bell Centre 41 21,273 872,193 100.0% Philadelphia Flyers Wells Fargo Center 40 19,770 790,787 101.2% Detroit Red Wings Joe Louis Arena 41 20,066 822,706 100.0% Toronto Maple Leafs Air Canada Centre 41 19,505 799,686 103.6% Ottawa Senators Scotiabank Place 41 19,357 793,612 101.1% Calgary Flames Scotiabank Saddledome 41 19,289 790,849 100.0% Vancouver Canucks Rogers Arena 41 18,884 774,250 100.1% St. Louis Blues Scottrade Center 41 18,810 771,207 98.2% Buffalo Sabres First Niagara Center 40 18,680 747,209 99.9% Pittsburgh Penguins Consol Energy Center 41 18,569 761,224 101.0% Washington Capitals Verizon Center 41 18,506 758,746 100.0% Tampa Bay Lightning Tampa Bay Times Forum 41 18,468 757,192 96.2% New York Rangers Madison Square Garden 41 18,191 745,852 99.9% Los Angeles Kings Staples Center 39 18,109 706,236 99.9% Minnesota Wild Xcel Energy Center 41 17,772 728,683 98.4% Boston Bruins TD Garden 41 17,565 720,165 100.0% San Jose Sharks HP Pavilion at San Jose 41 17,562 720,042 100.0% Edmonton Oilers Rexall Place 41 16,839 690,399 100.0% Nashville Predators Bridgestone Arena 41 16,691 684,324 97.5% Florida Panthers BankAtlantic Center 41 16,628 681,763 86.4% Carolina Hurricanes PNC Arena 41 16,043 657,747 85.9% Colorado Avalanche Pepsi Center 41 15,499 635,440 86.1% New Jersey Devils Prudential Center 41 15,397 631,258 87.4% Winnipeg Jets MTS Centre 41 15,004 615,164 100.0% Anaheim Ducks Honda Center 40 14,784 591,371 86.1% Columbus Blue Jackets Nationwide Arena 41 14,660 601,061 80.1% Dallas Stars American Airlines Center 41 14,227 583,306 76.8% New York Islanders Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum 41 13,191 540,838 81.3% Phoenix Coyotes Jobing.com Arena 41 12,421 509,241 72.3%\n\nNotes\n\nTotals do not include four regular-season opening games played in Europe, and one outdoor regular season game.\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres played one home game against the Anaheim Ducks at Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks played one home game against the New York Rangers at the Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings played two home games, one against the New York Rangers at Ericsson Globe in Stockholm, Sweden, and one against the Buffalo Sabres at O2 World in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers played the New York Rangers outdoors in the Winter Classic at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPlayoffs\n\nMain article: 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs\n\nThe 2012 playoffs started on Wednesday, April 11, 2012, and ended with the sixth game of the Stanley Cup Final in June 11, 2012, in which the Los Angeles Kings defeated the New Jersey Devils 6â1 to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The Boston Bruins and Vancouver Canucks, the Stanley Cup finalists from 2011, were eliminated in the first round, ensuring a new champion in 2012. In the East, three of the four series went to seven games in the opening round, and two of those went to overtime to decide their series. The series between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh set new playoff scoring records, while the Boston-Washington series had only a single goal differential. In the West, none of the first-round winners had won the Stanley Cup, and the Phoenix Coyotes won their first playoff series since moving to Phoenix from Winnipeg. All West series were decided in six games or less, and five of the six games in the Chicago-Phoenix series went to overtime. This will mark only 1 Canadian team; Ottawa Senators\n\nBracket\n\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Final series, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2â2â1â1â1 format: the higher-seeded team plays at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team is at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six).\n\nConference Quarterfinals Conference Semifinals Conference Finals Stanley Cup Finals 1 NY Rangers 4 1 NY Rangers 4 8 Ottawa 3 7 Washington 3 2 Boston 3 Eastern Conference 7 Washington 4 1 NY Rangers 2 6 New Jersey 4 3 Florida 3 6 New Jersey 4 4 Pittsburgh 2 5 Philadelphia 1 5 Philadelphia 4 6 New Jersey 4 E6 New Jersey 2 (Pairings are re-seeded after the first round.)

In the Finals the team with the better regular season record has home ice.\n\nNHL awards\n\nAwards are presented at the NHL Awards ceremony, held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 20, 2012. Finalists for voted awards are announced during the playoffs and winners are presented at the award ceremony. Voting concluded immediately after the end of the regular season. The Presidents' Trophy, the Prince of Wales Trophy and Clarence S. Campbell Bowl are not presented at the awards ceremony.
