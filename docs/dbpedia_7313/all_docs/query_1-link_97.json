        "text": "A weight may have been lifted off Jaden Schwartz’s shoulders when the Wilcox product hoisted the Stanley Cup on Wednesday.\n\nSchwartz’s father, Rick, spoke with The Green Zone’s Jamie Nye on Friday and said that Jaden has been wanting for a long time to win the NHL title to honour his late sister.\n\nMandi Schwartz died in April of 2011 at the age of 23 after a battle with acute myeloid leukemia. Jaden wears Mandi’s jersey number, 17, and writes her initials on his sticks to honour her.\n\nHe paid her perhaps the ultimate tribute Wednesday after the Blues beat the Boston Bruins 4-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final. When Jaden got his turn on the ice with hockey’s ultimate prize, Rick said the moment had been on his family’s mind for years.\n\n“She never got to see him play (in the NHL), which was hard on us,” the elder Schwartz told Nye from St. Louis. “We knew that lifting that cup would be the next step in his life and (in) honouring Mandi, so that meant the world to us. Thank God that day came and we are so happy for him.”\n\nMandi played hockey at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox before going on to Yale University. She was diagnosed with cancer in December of 2008 and fought it for 27 months before her death.\n\nOn Friday, Rick recalled the moment when Jaden was selected by the Blues in the first round (14th overall) of the 2010 NHL draft. Mandi was receiving treatment at the time.\n\n“I remember seeing a video because we were at the draft and she was in the hospital with her grandma while we were away,” Rick said. “When (Jaden) got drafted, we saw how excited (Mandi) was. She jumped out of bed with those IVs in her body and she was just ecstatic.”\n\nJaden’s minor hockey career featured stops in such locales as Melfort, White City, Pilot Butte, Weyburn and Wilcox. He played junior hockey with the SJHL’s Notre Dame Hounds and the United States Hockey League’s Tri-City Storm before heading to Colorado College.\n\nThe forward joined the Blues during the 2011-12 NHL season and has been a fixture in their lineup for the past seven seasons.\n\n“All of those organizations on the way up, that’s who that victory (Wednesday) is for and that Stanley Cup is for as well — but mostly my daughter, Mandi,” Rick said.\n\nAs usual, Rick had Mandi’s Upper Deck hockey card with him for Wednesday’s game. The family members also were wearing their orange wristbands that say “Mandi inspires me” and “Never Lose Heart.” The latter words are the motto at Notre Dame.\n\nWhen the Blues finished off Wednesday’s victory, Jaden’s family members were able to join him on the ice for the celebration.\n\n“The tears were flowing pretty good,” Rick said. “It was a very emotional moment. He was so happy; you could just see it in his face. He was just, ‘Rick, can you believe this?’ He says, ‘Why are you crying?’ We were so happy for him.\n\n“We knew what it was all about. We knew who it was for. The first five minutes (of the post-game festivities) were pretty tough, but then it got to be a lot of fun after that.”\n\nThe revelry also included the families of two other Saskatchewan-born players: Regina’s Tyler Bozak and Saskatoon’s Brayden Schenn.\n\nRick said he has come to know the Bozaks and Schenns very well over the season and getting to celebrate with fellow Saskatchewan residents added to the experience.\n\nThey’re now getting to enjoy the same feelings as the family of Saskatoon product Chandler Stephenson, who won the Stanley Cup with the Washington Capitals in the 2017-18 season.\n\n“It’s just nice to see Saskatchewan be rewarded and (the Saskatchewan Hockey Association) having these players come through the system and putting their name on the map — and (on) the Stanley Cup,” Rick said.\n\nThe party has continued in St. Louis since Wednesday’s victory, with gatherings for the team and for family members taking place around the city.\n\nA parade is set for Saturday, and Rick has heard that half a million people will fill the streets.\n\n“It’s just an amazing feeling,” he said. “I think (the players) are getting a little tired, though. We’ll see how it goes tonight (at a team dinner). Some of the guys, I couldn’t believe the hours they put in.”\n\nParents also put in a lot of time and effort to help their sons get to a point where they have a chance to win a Stanley Cup. For Rick Schwartz, the sacrifice was worth it.\n\n“At the end of the day, this is the reward you get,” he said. “You can’t even imagine the feeling of something like this.”"
