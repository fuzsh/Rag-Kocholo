        "text": "Pavol Demitra (born on November 29, 1974 in Dubnica nad Váhom, Slovakia) was a Slovak professional ice hockey player who played in the NHL for the Ottawa Senators, St. Louis Blues, Los Angeles Kings, Minnesota Wild and the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nHe also played in the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League (CSL), Slovak Extraliga (SVK) and the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) where he played for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl until his death in a plane crash in 2011 that involved most of the players from Lokomotiv Yaroslavl prior to the 2011-12 KHL season.\n\nDemitra was drafted 227th overall by Ottawa in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPlaying Career[]\n\nEarly Playing Career[]\n\nInitially a soccer player, like his father (who played professionally), Pavol only began to focus on hockey when he was 15 years old. He began playing at the senior level with ZŤS Dubnica in Czechoslovakia's second-tier league; he recorded 23 points (13 goals and 10 assists) over 28 games.\n\nThe following season, he joined HC Dukla Trenčín of the premier Czechoslovak Extraliga in 1992–93, where he scored 11 goals and 28 points in 46 games.\n\nAfter the season, Pavol was drafted by the Ottawa Senators in the ninth round, 227th overall in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft. He came to be considered one of the best draft steals in NHL history.\n\nProfessional[]\n\nPavol began the 1993–94 season with the Ottawa Senators. In his first NHL game on 9 October 1993, he scored on St. Louis Blues goaltender Curtis Joseph for his first NHL goal and point. He played in 12 games for Ottawa during the season, scoring a goal and two points.\n\nPavol mainly spent the season with Ottawa's AHL-affiliate team, the Prince Edward Island Senators. In 41 AHL games, he recorded 41 points, sixth on the team. He spent most of the following season in the AHL, scoring 74 points in 61 games.\n\nPavol also spent time with Ottawa, as he scored four goals and seven points in 16 games. He began the 1995–96 season in the AHL, but after scoring 81 points in 48 games, he was recalled to Ottawa permanently. With Ottawa, he had seven goals and 17 points in 31 games.\n\nTo start the 1996–97 season, Pavol was a contract hold-out with Ottawa. He played a game with HC Dukla Trenčín of the Slovak Extraliga, getting a goal and two points, before joining the Las Vegas Thunder of the IHL. With the Thunder, he had eight goals and 21 points in 22 games.\n\nOn 27 November 1996, the Senators parted ways with Pavol as Ottawa traded him to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Christer Olsson.\n\nThe St. Louis Blues assigned Pavol to the Grand Rapids Griffins of the IHL, where in 42 games, he had 20 goals and 50 points. He was called up to the Blues and played in his first game with the club on 17 March 1997, getting no points in a 3–2 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes.\n\nPavol scored his first two goals with St. Louis on 3 April 1997, scoring twice against Tommy Salo in a 5–5 tie with the New York Islanders. He finished the season appearing in eight games with St. Louis, scoring three goals.\n\nPavol made his NHL playoff debut on 16 April 1997, recording his first playoff point, an assist, in the Blues 2–0 win over the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nOn 22 April 1997, he scored his first playoff goal, beating Red Wings goaltender Mike Vernon and added two assists in a 4–0 win over Detroit. Overall, he had a goal and four points in six playoff games.\n\nPavol made the NHL full-time in 1997–98, as he played in 61 games with St. Louis, scoring 22 goals and 52 points to finish fifth in team scoring. In 10 playoff games, he had three goals and six points.\n\nThe 1998–99 was a break-out season for Pavol, as he finished tenth in NHL scoring with 89 points, as he scored 37 goals and added 52 assists in 82 games.\n\nHe appeared in the 1999 NHL All-Star Game held in Tampa Bay, Florida, scoring a goal for the World team in an 8–6 loss to North America. In the playoffs, he added five goals and nine points in 13 games.\n\nPavol continued his success in 1999–2000, as he scored 27 goals and 75 points in 71 games to lead the Blues in scoring once again. He played in the 2000 NHL All-Star Game held in Toronto, Ontario, where he scored two goals in a 9–4 World victory over North America.\n\nPavol also scored his first career hat trick, scoring three goals against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim on 12 February 2000 in a 6–3 Blues victory. Demitra suffered a season-ending injury on 24 March 2000, and missed the playoffs. After the season, he was awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy after he accumulated only eight penalty minutes throughout the season.\n\nInjuries cut short Pavol's season in 2000–01 when he appeared in only 44 games with St. Louis. He scored 20 goals and 45 points to finish fifth in team scoring. He scored a hat trick and added two assists for a five-point game against the New York Rangers on 20 December 2000 in a 6–3 win.\n\nLess than a week later, on 26 December 2000, he had another high scoring game, scoring two goals and four points against the Columbus Blue Jackets in a 5–0 victory. On 30 December 2000, Pavol suffered an injury; however, he came back with the team late in the season, and appeared in 15 playoff games, scoring two goals and six points.\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Pavol was healthy, as he appeared in all 82 games for St. Louis, scoring 35 goals and 78 points to lead the team in scoring and finish seventh in the league scoring race.\n\nHe had a league high ten game-winning goals. He had a four-point night against his former team, the Ottawa Senators, on 27 November 2001, scoring two goals and two assists in a 4–2 victory.\n\nPavol appeared in the 2002 NHL All-Star Game held in Los Angeles, California; however, he was held off the scoresheet in an 8–5 World win over North America. In the playoffs, he appeared in 10 games, scoring four goals and 11 points. He had a four-point night against the Detroit Red Wings on 7 May 2002, scoring a goal and three assists in the Blues 6–1 victory.\n\nThe 2002–03 season was Pavol's most productive in the NHL, as he set a career high with 93 points (which placed him sixth in NHL scoring) as he scored 36 goals and 57 assists in 78 games.\n\nHe had a hat trick and a season high four points on 29 November 2002 in a 7–2 win over the Calgary Flames. In the playoffs, he had two goals and six points in seven games.\n\nPavol had a disappointing 2003–04 season, scoring 23 goals and 58 points, his lowest totals since his injury plagued 2000–01 season, in 68 games. In the playoffs, he had a goal in five contests; this would be his final season with the Blues as he left the team fifth in franchise scoring with 493 points in 494 games.\n\nWith the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the season, Pavol signed with HK Dukla Trenčín of the Slovak Extraliga on 17 September 2004. He led the league in scoring with 28 goals and 82 points in 54 games. He scored four goals and 17 points in 12 playoff games with the team.\n\nOn 2 August 2005, Pavol signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. On 5 October 2005, he played his first game with the Kings, scoring an assist in a 5–4 loss to the Dallas Stars.\n\nThe next night, on 6 October 2005, Demitra scored his first goal with his new team, scoring against David LeNeveu of the Phoenix Coyotes in a 3–2 win.\n\nPavol had three four-point games during the season, including one on 22 November 2005 against his former team, the St. Louis Blues in a 6–3 Los Angeles win. He missed 24 games with injuries (including an eye problem) during the season. In 58 games during the season, he had 25 goals and 62 points to finish third in team scoring.\n\nOn 24 June 2006, Los Angeles traded Demitra to the Minnesota Wild for Patrick O'Sullivan and a first round draft pick in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPavol joined the Wild and fellow Slovak Marian Gaborík for the 2006–07 season. He played his first game with the Wild on 5 October 2006, recording two assists in a 3–2 win over the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nIn his next game on 7 October 2006, he scored his first goal with Minnesota, scoring against Tomas Vokoun of the Nashville Predators in a 6–5 victory. He finished the season tied for first in team scoring, as he had 25 goals and 64 points in 71 games. The 64 points were the highest by him since 2002–03.\n\nHe played in his first playoff game with Minnesota on 11 April 2007, scoring a goal against Ilya Bryzgalov of the Anaheim Ducks in a 2–1 loss. He appeared in five playoff games, scoring a goal and four points.\n\nPavol was named the captain of the Wild for the month of October 2007 as part of the Wild's rotating captaincy to begin the 2007–08 season. He had a tough season, scoring only 15 goals, his lowest total since 1996–97, and 54 points through 68 games as he finished fourth in team scoring.\n\nIn the playoffs, he had a goal and three points in six games. At the end of the season, he became an unrestricted free agent.\n\nOn 10 July 2008, Pavol signed a two-year, $8 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks. He played in his first game as a Canuck on 9 October 2008, getting no points in a 6–0 win over the Calgary Flames.\n\nIn his next game, also against Calgary, he scored his first goal with Vancouver, the game winning overtime goal against Miikka Kiprusoff in a 5–4 win. He finished the season with 20 goals and 53 points in 69 games, finishing fourth in team scoring.\n\nPavol appeared in his first playoff game with Vancouver on 15 April 2009, recording an assist in a 2–1 win over the St. Louis Blues. He scored his first playoff goal with the Canucks on 30 April 2009, scoring against Nikolai Khabibulin of the Chicago Blackhawks in a 5–3 victory.\n\nOn 2 May 2009, he suffered a shoulder injury against the Blackhawks that would end his season. In six playoff games, he had a goal and three points.\n\nThe 2009–10 season would be a tough season on Pavol, as he missed most of the regular season with the shoulder injury that occurred in the 2009 playoffs. In 28 games, he had three goals and 16 points, his lowest totals since 1996–97. In the playoffs, he had a three-point game against the Los Angeles Kings on 23 April 2010, helping Vancouver to a 7–2 win. Overall, he appeared in 11 playoff games, scoring two goals and six points.\n\nAfter the season, Pavol became an unrestricted free agent; this would mark the end of his NHL career where he played in 847 career games, and scored 304 goals with 464 assists for 768 points.\n\nOn July 15, 2010, he joined Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the KHL.

In 18 playoff games with Yaroslavl, he had six goals and 15 assists for 21 points which placed him second in KHL playoff scoring. He returned to the team for the 2011–12 season; however, on September 7, 2011, he was killed in a plane crash along with the entirety of the team roster and most of the flight crew.\n\nCareer Statistics[]\n\nRegular season and playoffs[]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1991–92 Spartak ZŤS Dubnica nad Váhom CSR.2 28 13 10 23 12 — — — — — 1992–93 CAPEH Dubnica nad Váhom CSR.2 4 3 0 3 2 — — — — — 1992–93 ASVŠ Dukla Trenčín TCH 46 11 17 28 — — — — — — 1993–94 Ottawa Senators NHL 12 1 1 2 4 — — — — — 1993–94 P.E.I.
