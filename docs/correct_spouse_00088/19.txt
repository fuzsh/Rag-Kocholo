THE BLUE HORSE REP is a professional theatre company dedicated to providing an inclusive and collaborative environment where professional actors, writers and musicians can rediscover the classics, develop new work, and apply themselves to creating a richer cultural experience for the whole community. In addition to providing quality performances, our goal is to offer educational opportunities for people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds and gender identities as well as programs for people with special needs.

Founded by actress/teacher Lora Lee Ecobelli and actress/director Peggity Price, Blue Horse is the embodiment of a vision held by Ms. Ecobelli’s late husband, actor Leo Burmester. It was Leo’s wish to create a safe space where newcomers to the theatre, young and old, could call on the creative spirit to shape ideas into actions and actions into art.

Encouraging these artistic ambitions is an essential part of the Blue Horse Rep mission. Carried out through acting, voice and movement classes, personal consultation and mentoring, the aim of our teaching program is to develop a nurturing and supportive atmosphere where performers can explore the connections between personal revelation and well-crafted professional forms of expression.

Strongly committed to celebrating the unique character and resources of New York’s Hudson Valley, its people, history, industry, and economy, Blue Horse Rep strives to become a self-sustaining theatre company, integrally embedded in the Hudson community.
