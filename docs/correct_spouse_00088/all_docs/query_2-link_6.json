Further in April 2018, she released her second eye shadow palette, \"Nudie Patootie\" along with three liquid lipsticks and an eyeliner.[10]\n\nIn August 2018, tweets dating from 2012 were found in which she made racist comments that Lee herself described as \"vile and disgusting\". Lee was criticized for releasing an apology video that many of her fans deemed insincere.[11] In a one-week span she lost over 300,000 subscribers and several sponsorships.[11][12] In 2019, Lee posted a video explaining the situation, as well as apologizing for the first video.[13]\n\nIn the fall of 2020, Lee launched her second company, Nudie Patootie, a self-funded, contemporary fashion line.[4] The fashion line includes lounge wear, sweaters, earrings, hats, outerwear, dresses, pants, plus size and more.[14] Lee said feedback from her audience inspires the fashion line. For example, her followers requested Nudie Patootie release more loungewear, oversize T-shirts and flannels. There were also requests to offer more plus sizes.[4] Nearly all items in the line sold out on the first day of sales.[14]\n\nLee was born in Montgomery, Alabama.[1] She has two siblings, an older brother and sister.[1] Prior to beginning her YouTube channel, Lee worked as a medical assistant for a dermatologist in Montgomery, Alabama.[5][9] She has also worked as a preschool teacher.[1] Lee currently resides in Los Angeles with her husband and her niece.[1][5] She became the legal guardian of her niece Eryn in 2019, [15] whose grandmother had died due to COVID-19 complications, according to Lee two years later.[16]"
