Stranded at a bus station, Judith (Heather Matarazzo) and Jimmy (Mark Weston) spin tales about the people they see there and reveal things about each other through their extemporaneous fictions. Ms. Skyler gets standout performances, and her patience and skill are revealed in small, satisfying ways throughout the film. &#151; Elvis Mitchell",

        "text": "''That's why people lie, out of necessity,'' says Judith (Heather Matarazzo), the clear-eyed protagonist of Lisanne Skyler's entrancing ''Getting to Know You.'' The movie, which opens today at the Film Forum, is based on Joyce Carol Oates stories and conjures an alluring spell of mistrust and hope, getting to the self-deception that Ms. Oates's characters often weave for themselves.\n\nMs. Matarazzo's Judith -- her face a conglomeration of angles and rounded curves with a hint of a dimple in her cheek -- is stuck in a bus station with her older brother, Wesley (Zach Braff). The squabbling between the siblings, who have that way of getting on each other's nerves as only a brother and sister can, is an honest outcropping of their defense mechanisms.\n\nThe easygoing Judith, with her clear blue eyes, has a friendly streak of curiosity in her, compared with the closed-off ambition of her brother, who pursues his studies as if school were a one-way ticket out of his misery. Judith's interest leads her to Jimmy (Mark Weston), who claims to know her from school.\n\nJudith and Wesley have been essentially abandoned by their parents, Trix (Bebe Neuwirth) and Darryl (Mark Blum), a pair of former ballroom dancers. These self-absorbed failed performers play-act at being a grown-up couple; they have turned their marriage into dinner theater.\n\n''They don't talk much about the future or us, just themselves,'' Wesley observes as he and his sister hide on a staircase while their parents float across the living room of a house from which they will probably soon be evicted.\n\nThe soured practicality of these children, who have become like a married couple as they fend for themselves, is chilling and, like many of the details in ''Getting to Know You,'' is underplayed.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
