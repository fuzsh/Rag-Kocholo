        "text": "The small, bent woman walked past our car, where Don, Paige and I were enjoying our Starbucks breakfast. Dressed in a wool skirt and sweater, black tights, shoes, and a black cap, the woman looked warm enough to be outdoors. Carrying two plastic shopping bags, she walked over to the two garbage containers outside Starbucks and rummaged around, then continued on her way. I thought she was hungry.\n\nTurning to Don, I asked, “Shall I ask if she needs food?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI walked around the corner of the Starbucks and didn’t see the woman, so asked a gentleman sitting outside if he’d seen her. He pointed to the right, around another corner. “She went that way.”\n\nI Wanted to Help\n\nFollowing his lead, I looked around the corner to see her standing about four parking spaces from me.\n\n“Ma’am,” I said, “are you hungry?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I’d be glad to buy you breakfast.”\n\n“No, thank you. I have no upper teeth and can’t chew anything.”\n\n“Not even a cup of coffee?”\n\n“With lots of cream? That sounds great. Wee-hee!”\n\n“We can do that.” I smiled and walked to meet her. As we walked back to Starbucks, I noticed the heart-shaped pin on her sweater that said “I love Jesus.”\n\n“You love Jesus!” I spoke. “I do too.”\n\n“Oh, yes, he’s so good to me.”\n\nShe Began to Tell me About Herself\n\nHer name was Lora Lee Spurlock, and she had a winsome sweetness about her. She and her husband, Jack, taught at Valley Christian School for many years before going as missionaries to Africa between 1968 and 1980.\n\n“Do you have enough food?” I asked.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nLora Lee said she lived about three blocks from this shopping center. I asked if there was anything I could do for her.\n\n“You’re doing it,” she said. “You’re giving me fellowship.”\n\nInside the store, I suggested a vanilla latte and she accepted. As we exited Starbucks, I waved to Don to bring Paige and join us. I couldn’t leave this amazing woman just yet.\n\nLora Lee’s Story\n\nDon pulled up a chair and he and Paige sat with us as Lora Lee told us more of her story.\n\nIn 1968 her husband, Jack Spurlock, and she relocated their family of six to Zaire, Africa (formerly Belgian Congo). There Jack served as a missionary pilot, delivering medical supplies, Bibles and other supplies to various jungle mission stations he served.\n\nOne morning in July 1980, Jack told Lora Lee to which station he was flying. She kissed him and sent him on his way. He soon radioed her to tell her one engine had stalled. Later she received word that his plane had crashed, taking Jack’s life and sending him into the presence of his Savior and Lord, Jesus Christ. https://bobspurlock.wixsite.com/wingsofcalvary/what-s-in-a-name\n\nIt took Lora Lee forty-five minutes to walk to the mission where her husband died. Jack knew he could land safely in the station’s gardens. But his wife later learned that he looked down and saw a woman working in the garden and realized he could not land there without killing her. By this time his windshield was covered with oil. He tipped the plane to see if there was another safe place to land—and crashed.\n\nLora Lee remained in Zaire about six months after Jack’s death before returning to America.\n\nI Thought She Was Hungry …\n\nAnd she was. But not for food. For company, for fellowship. I couldn’t have enjoyed our time more, learning of her love for our God and her years of service.\n\nWas she looking in the garbage for food?\n\nNo. She collects cans “so I can have something to give in the church offering.”\n\nMy heart was delighting in our time together and I didn’t want to leave. Lora Lee is beautiful.\n\nWee-Hee\n\nEvery time she liked something – “Wee-hee!”\n\n“This is my husband, Don,” I said. “God brought us together after we both lost our first spouses.”\n\n“Wee-hee.”\n\nWhen we finally parted and I asked if I could give her a hug, she said “A hug—wee-hee!” Loved it!\n\n“May I write about our meeting?” I asked. It was such a divine appointment. She said no. Only if I wrote about the God who has cared for and guided her all these years. At 93, this woman is radiant. “God is so good. All I am is because of him.”\n\nI pray I meet Lora Lee again in this life but, if not here, I am eager to meet her again in heaven.\n\nGod’s Purposes\n\nDon and I marveled at God’s leading.\n\nDon and I went to a Starbucks we’ve never been to before, which was actually out of our way.\n\nSaw a woman we thought was hungry.\n\nMet a woman, radiant in the love of God.\n\nLearned a story of a life lived faithfully in service of, and trust in, our Lord.\n\nDiscovered that, at 93, Lora Lee is still looking for ways to give, to serve, to care for others in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nWe. Were. Blessed! https://www.carolloewen.com/its-a-god-thing/\n\nWhat Are You Hungry For?\n\nWe tend to fill our hungers with food, material goods, shopping, accomplishment, the world’s measures of success. But what is the basic hunger beneath all those surface ‘treatments’?\n\nIs it a hunger to know God better?\n\nFor deeper connection with others?\n\nOr for peace? Or security?\n\nThen Jesus said, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28 NLT\n\nI am leaving you with a gift—peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don’t be troubled or afraid. John 14:27 NLT"
