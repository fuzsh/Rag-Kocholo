        "text": "​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTHE BLUE HORSE REP is a professional theatre company dedicated to providing an inclusive and collaborative environment where professional actors, writers and musicians can rediscover the classics, develop new work, and apply themselves to creating a richer cultural experience for the whole community. In addition to providing quality performances, our goal is to offer educational opportunities for people of all ages, ethnic backgrounds and gender identities as well as programs for people with special needs.\n\nFounded by actress/teacher Lora Lee Ecobelli and actress/director Peggity Price, Blue Horse is the embodiment of a vision held by Ms. Ecobelli’s late husband, actor Leo Burmester. It was Leo’s wish to create a safe space where newcomers to the theatre, young and old, could call on the creative spirit to shape ideas into actions and actions into art.\n\nEncouraging these artistic ambitions is an essential part of the Blue Horse Rep mission. Carried out through acting, voice and movement classes, personal consultation and mentoring, the aim of our teaching program is to develop a nurturing and supportive atmosphere where performers can explore the connections between personal revelation and well-crafted professional forms of expression.\n\nStrongly committed to celebrating the unique character and resources of New York’s Hudson Valley, its people, history, industry, and economy, Blue Horse Rep strives to become a self-sustaining theatre company, integrally embedded in the Hudson community.\n\n​\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nLeo Burmester (1945-2007) was the founding member of the Blue Horse Repertory Company which is dedicated to his continuing vision.\n\n​\n\nLeo was an actor, writer, musician and artist. As an actor, Leo appeared in thirty-seven films, thirty-two television appearances and nine Broadway plays. Some of his signature roles in films include: The Abyss, A Perfect World, Passion Fish and The Last Temptation Of Christ to name a few. On Broadway, he starred in the original cast of Le Miserables. He was nominated for Best Actor in Robert Altman's, Rattlesnake in a Cooler and won the New York Fanny award for best supporting actor in Ah Wilderness at New York's Lincoln Center. His last film, Aftermath will be released in 2013.\n\nLeo was also an accomplished musician and singer/ songwriter. He recorded an album of original blues and folk music in 2003 called Blue Horse.\n\nThe Blue Horse Repertory Company Acting School is a professional acting school located at The Theatre Institute at Sage College in Troy New York. We offer Method based scene study and technique classes to adult students of all ages. We offer an 8 week ongoing class every Monday night at 5pm-8pm in the Schacht Fine Arts Center on the Theatre Institute campus, 65 1st Street, Troy, N.Y. Classes are made up of people of all ages and abilities taught by Lora Lee Ecobelli. It is a very supportive and safe environment in which to develop your skills. Beginners thru professionals are always welcome. The cost of the 8 week session is $250 which includes private zoom audition coaching. Students are encouraged to participate in the many performance opportunities we provide including stage and film projects. Every 4 months we present a student showcase of classwork open to the public.\n\nFor more information and registration contact Lora Lee at: 845 721-2493 or by email at: Bluehorseloralee@gmail.com."
