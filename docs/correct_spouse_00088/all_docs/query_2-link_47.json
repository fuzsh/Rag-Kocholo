        "text": "If you’re a fan of beauty YouTuber Laura Lee, you already know that her relationship with hubby Tyler Williams might be the cutest thing on the Internet. Recently, Laura proved that she and her man are #CoupleGoals when she shared an adorable pic in celebration of their upcoming 10-year anniversary. With a twist on a glow-up post, something that many beauty gurus are doing right now, she showed fans what the couple looked like a decade ago!\n\n“We glowed up together,” she wrote, adding a laughing emoji. “Me and @tylerdub008 will have been together for 10 years on 2/28/18. A decade with my best friend! What more could you ask for.” Clearly, a lot has changed over the years, from Tyler’s adorable retainer to Laura’s barely-there brows. Fans quickly took to the comments section to congratulate the famous duo. “Love the pictures. You guys are so cute. Congratulations,” one fan wrote. Another added, “Congrats to 10 and many more. Aw y’all look sooo young.”\n\nThough Laura and her man have been together for almost a decade, they only got married in 2015. In a video where Laura introduced her hubby to fans, she explained that they waited three years after their engagement to get married. “We put off our wedding for so long because Tyler was in college obtaining his Industrial Engineering degree,” she said. “He graduated May 2014 and we moved across the country. We decided FINALLY we have the time to actually get married and so we did! We just eloped!”\n\nThe couple met as teens and were basically high school sweethearts. “We met for the first time in high school through an acquaintance and Laura was, I guess, a little short on lunch money,” Tyler explained in the Q&A vid. “I literally didn’t know him,” Laura added. “Apparently, my friend was like, ‘Hey, my friend here doesn’t have lunch money, can you give her some?’ And that’s how we met and we didn’t talk to each other again until senior year pretty much.” Well, happy anniversary, you two!"
