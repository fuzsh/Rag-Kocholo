        "text": "Ghost Dusters\n\nBy Jeffrey M. Anderson\n\nRight on the heels of his critical and box-office smash Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood made this outstanding, haunting tale of an escaped convict (Kevin Costner in his greatest performance), and it was completely ignored. The convict kidnaps a little boy wearing a Casper the Friendly Ghost costume on Halloween night and spends the rest of the film trying to evade the law. The two form a strange bond during their trip, which takes place among the wide-open cornfields of the Midwest. Eastwood co-stars in an atypical role as an ineffectual lawman who drives around in a big, clunky, high-tech trailer. Laura Dern plays a criminologist who gets to verbally spar with him.\n\nWarner Brothers did a fine job with this beautiful widescreen transfer, although they more or less dumped this film and two other Eastwoods -- Firefox and Heartbreak Ridge -- onto DVD with no fanfare."
