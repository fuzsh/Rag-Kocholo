        "text": "Theatre Program\n\nThe Theatre Program at Arts on the Lake both develops productions in house and presents productions developed elsewhere.\n\nSome highlights have been Kent Stories, the Liberty Free Theatre�s production of Vaclav Havel�s Audience and the musical Troll-Loll-La! and regular presentations of Open Mouth � new and revived works in a vaudeville-type performance.\n\nNeighbors and performers who have helped AotL get started include Jenny Allen whose I Got Sick Then I Got Better previewed in Lake Carmel before going to a well-received off-Broadway opening in NYC, Vincent Dowling who enlivened an Irish Open Mouth with Wild on Wilde. Jim Dale whose Jim Dale: Still Carrying On was a Spring Fund-Raiser in 2010 and Jamie Wax�s The Scutley Papers directed by Eleanor Reissa.\n\nAotL�s holiday presentations were inaugurated by the late Leo Burmester as Scrooge in a memorable reading of A Christmas Carol. For three years the Center presented a version of The Nutcracker Tale that mixed puppets, live dancers and spectacular visuals.\n\nThe Theatre Program has a relationship with the Bare Bones Theatre Company and the Blue Horse Repertory Company to nurture new plays. Some Blue Horse highlights have been new plays by Paul Coleman, Lora Lee Ecobelli, Stuart Hample and Bob Rogers as well as It Takes Two, a cabaret performance with Nancy Johnston and Doug Coates directed by Peggity Price.\n\nOrganized in 2010 under the leadership of Mary Schreiber, The Puppet Group produced Canterbury Tales in April 2013 and Robert Burns� Tam O�Shanter in Library Stories in May 2014."
