        "text": "4/4/2022\n\nBrothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nIt is with deep sadness that we inform you that our sister, Laura Lee Starbuck, surviving spouse of Rev. Harry Starbuck, died on April 4, 2022.\n\nLaura Lee was born on Oct. 19, 1922 in Los Angeles, California. Laura was devoted to her family and to Jesus. She loved singing and leading worship at Christian Family Camps over the years. She also enjoyed gardening, teaching English to second language learners, and volunteering her time and energy to a variety of causes that were important to her. She had a passion for prayer, music, and helping people recognize their God-given potential.\n\nLaura Lee married Harry Starbuck in 1983, following the death of his first wife Audrey. As the spouse of a clergy-person, Laura Lee experienced the Christian community and fellowship of Fremont, First UMC until Harry’s retirement in 1986.\n\nShe is survived by her 4 children and 2 step-children: Bill Soldwisch (retired Presbyterian pastor) of Los Angeles CA, Laurel Maynard of Houston TX, Marilyn Rodriguez of Long Beach CA, Susan Caton of Watsonville CA, Ed Starbuck (retired UMC pastor) of MA, and Jeff Starbuck of New Jersey, and by 13 Grandchildren and 11 Great-Grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service is planned for early October 2022 at Aptos, Community UMC, after one of Laura Lee’s children returns from travel abroad.\n\nGifts in memory of Laura Lee may be sent to the Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz County, 800 Ohlone Parkway, Watsonville, CA 95076, or to Teen Challenge of Monterey Bay, PO Box 1807, Watsonville, CA 95077.\n\nLet us continue to give God thanks for Laura Lee’s life and witness and hold her family close in prayer. In our living and in our dying, we belong to God! (Romans 14:8)"
