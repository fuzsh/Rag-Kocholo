        "text": "Baxter \"Bubba\" Lee Denton III, born in Houston, Texas on April 15, 1979, passed away peacefully on June 11, 2023, surrounded by his beloved wife and children. He was married for 22 years to his loving spouse, Brittney Denton. Bubba will be deeply missed by his daughter Shelby Denton and sons Stormey Denton and Karson Denton. He is survived by his sister Kristi Denton, brother Harold Denton, and a large circle of family and friends.\n\nBubba was known for his many talents and diverse skills, earning him the title of a jack of all trades. He had a deep love for the outdoors, particularly fishing, hunting, and working on trucks. His enthusiasm for these activities brought him great joy and fulfillment.\n\nOne of Bubba's exceptional qualities was his ability to excel at sarcasm, which he wielded to bring laughter and happiness to those around him. He had a natural talent for making people laugh and creating a lighthearted atmosphere.\n\nBaxter \"Bubba\" Lee Denton III will be remembered as a loving husband, a devoted father, and a person who brightened the lives of others with his humor and wit. His memory will forever remain in the hearts of his family and friends. Bubba was preceded in death by his father, Baxter \"Sonny\" Lee Denton Jr., his mother Lora Lee Denton, and his grandmother Margie Lockhart.\n\nMay he rest in peace, knowing that his legacy lives on through the love and laughter he shared with all those who had the privilege of knowing him."
