A long time member of the Presbyterian Church and Eastern Star, she volunteered many hours to their causes. As well she was a faithful volunteer at the Carson City Senior Center where she was on the board. Lora enjoyed playing Bridge, cooking, sewing and walking. But most of all she loved her family.",
