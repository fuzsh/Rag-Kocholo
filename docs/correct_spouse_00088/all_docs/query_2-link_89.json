        "text": "Mrs. Laura-Lee (Ellis) Clark, age 53, of Eastbrook, Maine passed away on June 4, 2018. She was born in Hyannis, Massachusetts on Sunday, February 21, 1965. Mrs. Clark was the daughter of the late Edward Ellis, Sr. and the late Polly Jane (Rodriguez) Ellis. Besides her parents, Mrs. Clark is preceded in death by one brother, Chris Ellis; and mother-in-law Marcia Clark.\n\nSurvivors include her husband Roland Clark Jr. of Eastbrook, Maine; two sons and one daughter-in-law, Jeremy and Kevy Ellis of Bangor, Maine and Jordan Ellis-Clark of Hampden, Maine; two step-daughters and their spouses, Emily Clark and her fiancé Robbie Poulin of Martensville, Saskatchewan and Tami and David Lane of Palm Bay, Florida; four brothers and two sisters-in-law, Edward Ellis Jr. of Massachusetts, Nate Ellis of Maine, Mark Ellis of Georgia, and Edward and Julie LeBlanc Jr. of Georgia; sisters, Sonja Leblanc of Massachusetts, Deanne Mansell of Maine, and Julie Clark of Maine; seven grandchildren, Chanelle and Ryan Poulin, Brady, Aiden, and Zoey Lane, and Everly and Bruin Ellis; her father-in-law Roland Clark Sr.; cousins, Darlene and Dennis Hoyt of Massachusetts and a number of other relatives.\n\nLaura's greatest passions in life included hunting for treasures, the ocean, traveling, creating art, and spending time with her family which included her dog Lexi. She loved to explore, taking beautiful photographs and collecting sea glass and other treasures along the way. She had a gift and could take what many saw as trash and turn it into beautiful art. No matter where her adventures took her she left an impression on all that she encountered. Her family brought her immense joy, especially her grandchildren, with whom she shared her passion for collecting treasures. In short, Laura was someone who truly lived in the moment and enjoyed the journey no matter where it took her.\n\nIn accordance with Mrs. Clark’s wishes, she will be cremated.\n\nThe family plans to hold a memorial service at a later date.\n\nMessages of condolence can be made to the family by signing the online guestbook.\n\nCremation services are being provided by Hutcheson’s Memorial Chapel & Crematory of Buchanan."
