She is American by nationality and European by ethnicity. Before becoming a beauty fanatic and influential beauty blogger, Laura Lee worked in a variety of jobs, including preschool teacher and medical assistant to a dermatologist.\n\nLee’s journey into the beauty industry was actually inspired by her medical assistant work. She had always been a makeup enthusiast, but the environment she worked in required her to tone down her makeup. Since she couldn’t wear much makeup in the office, she put on the makeup at home and shared the video on Instagram. She got so much love and positive reaction and soon her passion turned into a full time job.\n\nShe launched her first YouTube channel in June 2009. The channel offers makeup tutorials, product reviews, life hacks, etc. It has reached at least five million subscribers and over 450 million views.\n\nyour fortune\n\nLee has grown from a beauty influencer to an entrepreneur. She now has her own makeup brand called Laura Lee Los Angeles. The brand offers products such as eyeshadow palettes, lipsticks, highlighters and eyeliners. The Alabama native has also collaborated with other cosmetic brands such as MAC Cosmetics and Benefit Cosmetics."
