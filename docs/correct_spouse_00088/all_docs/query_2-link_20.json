        "text": "Laura Lee Dawson (nee LaRussa) age 66 passed away on April 1, 2024, after her 5-year long battle against cancer. Laura was born on May 3, 1957, to James and Faye LaRussa, (nee Brown) in Key West, Florida. She was the second oldest of six children, Dorothy (Bob), Donna (Jim), Ed, Jimmy, and Jeff (Dan). She met her loving husband Terry at Plainfield High School, and they began dating shortly after they each graduated. Despite their bickering, their love was relentless, exemplifying a perfect marriage. Those who knew the couple admired their love for music, baseball, gatherings for holidays, and spending time with their loved ones. They had been married for 45 years. Laura and Terry have two children, Terese Bernicky (Jason) and Dan (Marissa). Laura was a proud grandmother to three grandchildren, Nolan, Annabel, and Jasper Bernicky.\n\nShe dedicated 45 years to Jewel-Osco where she met and worked with some of her closest friends. Laura enjoyed shopping, which she often did with her best friend Shirley Wharrie. She also was a huge fan of the Chicago Cubs, and always had the game on in her home. She enjoyed watching baseball with son Dan, who is also an avid Cubs fan. She loved the summer and all the things that come with the season, such as gardening, the pool, and sunbathing. Laura also found interest in fashion, reading, and baking sweets.\n\nLaura was the ideal grandmother, dedicating herself to her children and grandchildren. Her daughter Terese and the Bernicky family were next door neighbors to Laura and Terry. Tereseâ€™s children testify to the love they received from Laura. From home cooked meals to impromptu sleepovers, her three grandchildren recollect on the countless memories they associate with their grandma.\n\nThose who had the privilege of knowing her will be impacted greatly by her passing. Laura will truly be missed by the many people who loved her. The family grieves the loss but have gratitude for everything they learned and the memories they shared with Laura. Her remembrance will be long-lived.\n\nVisitation for Laura will be held at the Fred C. Dames Funeral Home, 3200 Black (at Essington) Rd., Joliet on Thursday, April 4, 2024, from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. Funeral services will be held directly after at 7:00 p.m. Interment will be held privately by the family.\n\nFor more information, please call 815-741-5500 or visit her Memorial Tribute at www.fredcdames.com where you can share a favorite memory or leave a condolence."
