It is also the administrative center of the Sana’a governorate. This city profile describes and examines living conditions and needs in the city of Sana’a across a variety of sectors. It addresses key thematic findings made prominent by the impact of the ongoing conflict, its toll on the city’s population, and the ability of institutions to provide basic services.\n\nEach individual section paints a picture of the prevailing situation and the needs of the city’s residents through triangulation of different data types, including secondary data analysis which draws on available publications and media reports; remote sensing, and structured interviews with community leaders and key sector experts. The aim of this profile is to provide partners with the widest possible canvas, assisting them in their operational programming and strategic policy development."
