It is situated at the western foot of Mount Nuqum, at an elevation of more than 7,200 feet (2,200 metres) above sea level, in the western part of the country. Sanaa has for many centuries been the chief economic, political, and religious centre of the Yemen Highlands. The city’s name means “fortified place.”\n\nHistory\n\nSanaa is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, although an exact date for its establishment is unknown. According to Yemeni legend, it was founded by Shem, one of the three sons of Noah. It occupies the site of the ancient pre-Islamic stronghold of Ghumdān, which may date to the 1st and 2nd century bce. Sanaa was an Arabian centre for Christians and Jews before it was converted to Islam by ʿAlī, fourth caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, in 632 ce. The city’s history as a Muslim centre is one of sporadic rivalry between the heterodox Zaydī (see Zaydiyyah) imams (leaders) and rival dynasties; the Zaydī imamate, whose original capital was at Ṣaʿdah in the north, lasted, with frequent interruptions, from the 9th century to 1962. There was a sharp decline in the city’s fortunes in the 12th–15th century, as successive conquerors of Yemen set up their capitals in other cities. During the reign of ʿAbd al-Wahhāb ibn Ṭāhir of the Ṭāhirid dynasty in the early 16th century the city was embellished with many fine mosques and madrassas (Islamic theological schools).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld Capitals Quiz\n\nNominally under Ottoman sovereignty from the mid-16th century, Sanaa was effectively controlled by the imams from the early 17th century to 1872; only then did the Ottomans succeed in capturing and holding the city. Civil strife between the Ottomans and the imams continued until 1911, when a treaty gave the latter almost total autonomy. Sanaa became the national capital of independent Yemen after Ottoman defeat in World War I. Under the imam Aḥmad (reigned 1948–62), the capital was moved south to Taʿizz, but Sanaa again became the capital with the 1962 revolution and the proclamation of the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen). The revolution ousted the Zaydī imamate and opened Sanaa to political and cultural change, but it also sparked an eight-year civil war. In 1990 Sanaa became the unified country’s capital when the North Yemen merged with the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen).\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nThe old city is surrounded by a massive wall 20–30 feet (6–9 metres) high, pierced by numerous gates. Most notable architecturally is the Yemen Gate (Bāb al-Yaman), renamed Liberty Gate after the revolution of 1962. Old Sanaa includes 106 mosques, 12 hammams (baths), and 6,500 houses, all built before the 11th century ce. Multistoried tower houses, built of dark basalt stone and brick, are decorated with intricate frieze work and beautiful carved windows. Sanaa’s most notable mosque, Al-Jamīʿ al-Kabīr (Great Mosque), contains a sacred shrine that was once a principal object of Zaydī veneration. The old souks (Arabic suqs, marketplaces) begin at Bāb al-Yaman and extend northward past the Great Mosque. The area is called Sūq al-Milh (Salt Market) but consists of many smaller souks selling a wide variety of goods. Northwest of the old city is the former summer palace of the imam, perched on a steep rock outcrop overlooking the Wadi Dharr. The garden suburb of Rawḍah, due north of Sanaa, has a fine mosque in the Moorish style. Qāʿ al-Yahūd (Jewish Quarter), a walled ghetto in the western part of the city, was long a centre for the practice of traditional crafts, such as fine gold and silver metalwork and embroidery. Virtually all the capital’s Jews emigrated to Israel in 1949–50, dealing an almost fatal blow to the handicraft economy.\n\nSanaa’s traditional isolation was mitigated by the opening (1961) of an all-weather road to the port of Al-Ḥudaydah to the southwest; the road was funded by China. Another highway leads to Taʿizz, which is linked to the old port of Mocha (Al-Mukhā), now little-used. Sanaa’s international airport is at nearby Al-Raḥabah.\n\nIn addition to the city’s function as a regional trade centre, modern industry has been stimulated by foreign assistance; a cotton textile mill built by the Chinese (opened 1966) is particularly important. Many of the city’s residents are government workers. Several houses and public buildings in and around the capital were damaged in the civil war of 1962–70. The University of Sanaa was established in 1970.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The city has expanded in all directions with the increase in population, but Old Sanaa, reduced to one-tenth of the city’s population and area, was neglected until the 1980s, when UNESCO and the Yemeni government initiated efforts to preserve and repair the walled city. In 1986 it was designated a World Heritage site. Pop. (2004) 1,707,586; (2009 est.) 2,022,867.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Adam Augustyn."
