        "text": "Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen have signed a deal for a new unity government, little over a month after organising the first armed protest camps in the country's capital, Sanaa. The events have left the city's residents in shock, as Iona Craig reports.\n\nSqueezed into the back of a pick-up truck around an anti-aircraft gun, while parked outside Yemen's parliament, three young men stuff green khat leaves into their mouths.\n\nChewing the mild, narcotic plant is a daily routine for most Yemenis. The men have curved daggers at their waists and AK-47 rifles resting in the laps of their traditional long, loose robes. The plate on the back of the sand-coloured truck says \"al-Jaysh\" - the army, but these men are not soldiers.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I ask. \"Saada,\" comes the reply.\n\nSaada - a northern Yemeni province, sharing its border with Saudi Arabia - is the stronghold of the Shia Houthi movement, whose militiamen have fought six wars with the government in the province since 2004.\n\nThe usual contingent of soldiers tasked with guarding the parliament and nearby cabinet office is nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Where is the army, the soldiers?\" I press.\n\nA passing pedestrian who has stopped to listen butts in: \"They surrendered. This is the army now.\" He grins and walks on.\n\nAfter four days of heavy fighting centred around a major military base in the north-west of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, Houthi gunmen walked up to government institutions across the city and asserted their control without a shot being fired.\n\nThe interior minister ordered troops under his control to stand down. Within a couple of hours, the fighters had control of the city. Its residents were in shock.\n\nConfused and curious men spilled out onto the street from their homes where many had been sheltering from the artillery fire and mortar rounds that had earlier rocked the city.\n\nWhile the militiamen set up checkpoints throughout Sanaa, their political leaders sat down in the presidential palace to sign an agreement to calm the crisis which had been threatening the capital for the last month.\n\nBut before the ink was even dry on the deal, the Houthi rebels' victory was complete.\n\nFew had foreseen that the group's push south for territory over the past six months would end in the takeover of the capital Sanaa.\n\nNo-one could have imagined the speed with which the rag-tag force of tribesmen would seize the city.\n\nMany suspect Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh - who was forced to hand over power following the country's 2011 political uprising - had a hand in it.\n\nThey believe he facilitated the rebels' advance as they fought tribal militias aligned to the Islah party - Yemen's equivalent to the Muslim Brotherhood and Saleh's arch enemy.\n\nIn just a few months, the Houthi fighters had managed to do what Saleh could not in 2011 - destroy the tribal power base of Islah and bring down his powerful foe, Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who also led wars against the rebels in Saada.\n\nThe general - a senior military adviser to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi - is now being hunted down by Houthi fighters.\n\n\"We will kill him if we find him,\" warns one Houthi loyalist, brandishing a vintage bolt-action rifle.\n\nAll passengers leaving the airport in Sanaa are now being rigorously checked by the militiamen in search of the general and other opponents who may be attempting to flee the city.\n\nOther political rivals have had their homes raided in apparent attempts to intimidate the rebels' adversaries."
