        "text": "Introduction\n\nSana'a is the Political and historical Capital city of the Republic of Yemen.\n\nIt was never easy to reach Sanaa, situated as it is in the heart of mountainous Yemen. Yet those who did take upon themselves the tiresome journey on donkey or camel back were awed and inspired by the tall , beautifully decorated houses of the age-old city. According to popular legend the city was founded by Shem, the son of Prophet Noah, and its first name was Sham City. This name still used to this day in Yemeni culture and art.. Yemenis thus claim it to be the oldest living city in the world. \"Labod min Sanaa Waeen tal alssafar\" \"Sanaa must be seen even if the travel takes along time\" are famous words known to all Arabs. Generations of visitors have expressed their admiration for the city in countless pieces of literature. And the old city continues to inspire foreign residents and tourists alike who enjoy the genuine oriental air of its markets and narrow lanes, and the unique architecture . Harold Ingrams, who visited Sanaa in 1934 to negotiate the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty, described the town as \" The Greatest Arab City I Had Seen - Unspoiled by European Influence \" On December 1984, UNESCO declared Old Sanaa a World Heritage City, signalling the start of a campaign of safeguarding the Old City.\n\nPhysical layout\n\nSanaa lies in the Sanaa basin at an altitude of 2350m. Mount Nuqum in the east, Hadah hills in the south, Ayban mountain from the west, and Aser ridge in the south west form natural boundaries . Further expansion of the city is possible only along the Taiz Road from the south side . The Saylah, a dry river bed, cuts east-west through the city and becomes a torrent after a heavy rainfall. The walled city had the shape of a butterfly, and at its juncture lies the modern city centre, At-Tahrir Square, or Liberation Square . . The eastern part of the old city has not been touched at all by modern construction activity and thus remains the organic settlement of past centuries . The old city has about 40 mosques , some of which sport beautiful minarets making for a distinct skyline . Beyond Bab al Yemen (old city gate) lies the Old Suq, public commercial centre Suq al-Melh (Salt Market) The Old suq albeit smaller, still functions in the former Jewish quarter Al qaa.\n\nAt\n\nthe end of the civil war in 1972, the Yemeni government passed a law to protect its architectural and archaeological heritage, with particular reference to the old city of Sana'a. But the government's resources were very limited. UNESCO also wished to help to preserve what could still be saved , and in 1980 its General Conference adopted a resolution authorising the Director-General to collaborate with the Yemeni government in drawing up a plan of action for the preservation and restoration of the old city. In 1981 and 1982, architects, historians, sociologists and engineers were mobilised to study the problems posed by the safeguarding of a site which, it was felt, should not be mummified but given new life in accordance with its old traditions.\n\nBy 1983 the plan had been approved by the Yemeni government and UNESCO, and its implementation began. In December 1984, before the city's inclusion on the World Heritage List (which did not take place until 1987), the restoration and safeguard of Sana'a were placed by presidential decree under the authority of a High Committee chaired by the Prime Minister. The Director General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the international community to help the Yemeni government carry out a rescue operation with an estimated cost of $300 million. Several countries responded to UNESCO's appeal. Italy played an active part in pluridisciplinary studies connected with the rescue operation and became the first country to take part in the rehabilitation of an entire district of the old city. Its example was followed by the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, France, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Japan, and by the United Nations Development Programme, whose contribution notably sought to revive traditions of craftsmanship.\n\nIn June 1988, the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr. Federico Mayor, visited Sana'a to get a first-hand impression of the extent and complexity of the task. It will take fifteen years of constant effort and much devotion to save Sana'a.\n\nPrincipal Hotels\n\nSpecial Hotels\n\nA number of hotels are established in the old city of Sanaa in original houses modified for hotel purposes . They offer a unique living experience , at modest prices , in the enchanting environment of old Arabia.

Letters and parcels can be posted from there or from any of the smaller post offices in the city . There is no mail delivery and letters are received at customers Post Office Boxes. The telephone system is efficient and dependable, but in some areas there is a shortage of new telephone lines . Yemen International Telecommunication Co.
