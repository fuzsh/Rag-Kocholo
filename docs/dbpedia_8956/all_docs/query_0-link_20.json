        "text": "Sana’a’, the capital of Yemen, has for many centuries been the chief economic, political, and religious center of the country. According to legend, Yemen was founded by Shem, one of the three sons of Noah. Today, Yemen is home to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis after a brutal civil war started 6 years ago.\n\nSince then, over four million people have fled their homes and there have been 233,000 casualties from the war. There are currently over twenty million people in Yemen that rely on some form of humanitarian aid for their survival.\n\nThe global Church must stand in this hour for Yemen, and believe that the country can live into its legend and receive a flood-like baptism of God’s mercy and grace, transforming the nation through the blood of Jesus."
