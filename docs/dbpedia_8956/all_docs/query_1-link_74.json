        "text": "In five words\n\nA city that breathes history.\n\nSound of the city\n\nThere isn’t a day that passes in Sana’a when you do not hear the enchanting melody of minarets. As night gives way to the early signs of morning light, you hear blended tones of praise and prayers rising from the minarets that surround you, usually performed by old men who are declaring the birth of a new day. Citizens gather for the first prayer of the day, before dispersing throughout the city to go about their daily business.\n\nBest building\n\nAll roads inside the city lead you to Al Saleh Mosque, the biggest in Yemen. Built by ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh and completed in 2008, it was supposedly constructed from his personal funds and thus named in his honour. With six colossal minarets towering over one of the city’s main squares, the main hall alone covers 13,500 sq m and can hold more than 44,000 people. The best view of the mosque can be seen from rooftops in the old city.\n\nHomegrown talent\n\nIn 2011, during the latest conflict, Murad Subay, a Yemeni graffiti artist (one of very few in the country) took it upon himself to use the war-battered walls for artistic expression. He painted a message of peace and beauty over all the death and destruction, organised several artistic campaigns and invited people to join him in the streets, letting the damaged city walls speak up for the people of Sana’a. Since then, the popularity of graffiti art has grown, particularly among young people. At 28, Murad is the first notable street artist here, and in April 2014, he won the Art for Peace Award from the Veronesi Foundation, an annualprize that goes to an artist promoting peace through their work.\n\nTop insider’s tip\n\nInside the legendary old city of Sana’a, the historical market known as Souq al-Melh is where you will find all that is unique and beautiful in the city, Its small streets retain their traditional character and are divided into several sections, in which you will find all sorts – from gold and silver to raisins and spices to a wide range of crafts and ornaments. It also has some of the best breakfasts in the entire city.\n\nWhat does your city do better than anywhere else?\n\nEvery afternoon, Yemenis gather to enjoy qat gatherings. It’s a traditional activity that goes back hundreds of years, to when qat – a mild stimulant plant leaf that is chewed – was first discovered. We sit, relax, listen to Yemeni oud music and chat about everything from our personal lives to sport and politics.\n\nUnder-rated location\n\nSana’a is the city that wakes up before you do. It is one of those places that you do not leave without carrying some of its glamour with you – the smell of its spices, the singing of its hawkers and the sound of the Yemeni oud songs that permeate everyday life. And there’s nowhere better to find all of this than at Nogom Central Market, located on the eastern side of the city. Nogom also has several shops selling wild animals – not for the faint-hearted!\n\nBiggest controversy\n\nIn March 2010 child marriage became a crucial debate on the city’s streets following several tragic stories, including that of Sally Al-Sabahi, who, after being married at the age of 10, was raped and beaten by her much older husband, and 13-year-old Ilham, who died in 2010 from internal bleeding four days after her forced marriage. Following international condemnation and campaigns by charities such as Unicef and Equality Now, the country’s government finally appears ready to end the shocking tradition.\n\nBest cultural Instagram\n\nMoment in history\n\nIn February 2011, youth activists and university students started a series of protests in the streets. Following this, more members of the community, as well as politicians and human rights activists across the country, began calling for change. They wanted the existing political regime to be replaced, in order to improve the lives of Yemeni people.\n\nThis resulted in armed clashes, and many people being arrested and killed by the military. In early 2012, the Gulf cooperation countries broked an agreement, which was signed by all parties, including ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh, for a new presidential election. The result: Abd Rabbuh Mansur became Yemen’s new president in February 2012. Now, five years since we marched on the streets, what we fought for still hasn’t quite materialised. Instead, we now live in a prolonged war zone – exploding bombs shake my window frames on a weekly basis.\n\nBest local artist\n\n“A poet flooded in love” or “the inspiring”, as people here call him, Dr Abdul Aziz Al-Maqaleh is the most famous and prominent poet in the city. He is a huge inspiration to the young, and some of his poems are said to have had a great impact on the 2011 youth revolution that lead to the political regime being overthrown.\n\nHow green is your city?\n\nSana’a suffers from a style of construction that can only really be described as “random”, and there is limited green space at the city’s core. However, there is a strong will among citizens to improve our city, be it through small greenification campaigns, or city-wide clear-ups.\n\nIn December 2012, I participated, along with many other residents, in the biggest cleaning campaign Sana’a has ever witnessed, known as Brooms not Guns. After all the hard work, the city looked beautiful, and this mass participation was a great sign of the power of collective activity in Sana’a.\n\nFive to follow\n\nIbi Ibrahim\n\nMurad Subay\n\nBushra Al-Fusail\n\nBoushra Almutawakel\n\nSanaa Rohi\n\nFrom me"
