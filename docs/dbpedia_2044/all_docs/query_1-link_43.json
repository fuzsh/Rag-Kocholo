As society becomes increasingly digitalized, there are new opportunities for older adults to engage in the digital economy and contribute to the workforce.\n\nOne aspect of the digitalized silver economy is the growing market for technology and services targeted at older adults. For example, there is a rising demand for health and wellness apps, smart home devices, and other technology that can help older adults live independently and safely. This presents an opportunity for companies to create and market products specifically for this demographic.\n\nAnother aspect is the ability for older adults to work remotely and engage in the gig economy. With the rise of digital platforms, older adults can find flexible work opportunities such as freelance writing, consulting, and online tutoring. Additionally, the internet provides new opportunities for older adults to start their own businesses, sell products online, and reach customers across the world.\n\nHowever, there are also challenges that come with the digitalization of the silver economy. Older adults may face barriers to accessing and using digital technology, such as lack of digital literacy and physical impairments. Additionally, there is a risk of exacerbating existing social inequalities if older adults with limited access to technology are left behind.\n\nThe digitalization of the silver economy presents both opportunities and challenges. As technology continues to advance, it will be important to ensure that older adults are not left behind and are able to fully participate in the digital economy.\n\nSeniors centricity is important in a digital society for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, older adults are a growing demographic that is often overlooked in the development of digital products and services. This is a missed opportunity for businesses to tap into the potential of this group as consumers, entrepreneurs, and workers. By prioritizing seniors centricity, companies can develop products that meet the needs of older adults and make the digital world more accessible and user-friendly for this group.\n\nSecondly, seniors centricity is important for promoting social inclusion and reducing the digital divide. Digital technology has the potential to bring people together and facilitate communication and connection, but older adults may face barriers to accessing and using technology. By focusing on seniors centricity, businesses and organizations can work to bridge this gap and ensure that older adults are not left behind in the digital age.\n\nFinally, seniors centricity is important for promoting healthy aging and independence. Digital technology can play an important role in helping older adults stay connected, active, and engaged in their communities. By developing products and services that support these goals, companies can help older adults maintain their quality of life and independence.\n\nSeniors centricity is important in a digital society because it promotes inclusion, accessibility, and healthy aging. By prioritizing the needs and preferences of older adults, businesses and organizations can tap into the potential of this growing demographic and help ensure that everyone can benefit from the digital revolution.\n\nRecent Publication\n\nDeveloping the Silver Economy and Related Government Resources for Seniors. A Position Paper.\n\nSeptember 19, 2022.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe Global Network of Associations & Networks: Retirees Developing Silver Economy wants to encourage retirees not to wait for what the Silver Economy will bring them, but to be actively involved in its development so that it is in line with their needs and desires. Seniors centricity is needed in developing the Silver Economy. The professors emeriti are apt to signal the direction and engage in action since they are well positioned in interdisciplinarity.\n\nKey Words:\n\nlong-lived society; aging population; active aging; seniors’ use of eTechnologies, e-services; seniors 55+ eServices Guide; lifelong learning; digital literacy; e-learning; age-friendliness; senior centricity; minister of seniors; seniors’ council; silver economy.\n\nThe focus of the Zoom Meeting Contribution from a Network of the Associations to the Development of a Silver Economy on Wednesday, April 6, 2022, was to create a Network of all the Associations worldwide active to join emeriti, retired, senior researchers. This Project must consider the great dishomogeneity that characterizes these associations due to differences of feeling to the theme, of cultural interest (North Countries more looking at safety and environment, South Countries more at social aspects), of the demographic situation. Beside these differences, these associations have common activities related to their role in the lifelong learning, in the advancing functions to solve social and scientific problems, in acting as sentinels of the unity of culture. This unity was in the past threatened by particular interests of academic or politic nature and youngs due to their career needs cannot act as sentinels what on the contrary can do emeriti, retired, old cultured persons. The first question we have to put ourselves is why in some countries this kind of associations is less present if not absent and answers can be two: no feeling to the concern or adoption of a social policy able to respect all the components of the population independently on their education and age level so that no specific attention must be paid to any component of the population. The right answer between the two clearly is related to the different social ethics levels in the different countries. But it must be observed too that during last 30 years many things changed starting from the continuous mean ageing of the population in the developed countries so that even advanced social policies need updating and new integrations. So the proposed Network can help toward the right direction. By it the exchange of experiments, of expertise, of projects will become possible so that intellectual capital can be shared in favor of a general increase of the levels of knowledge.\n\nOne of the focus of the rising Network could and should be the institution in all the countries of the Network of a Minister of Seniors, of Old Age, of Silver Economy. Only 6 countries in the world have such a Minister (Australia, Canada, Malta, New Zealand, Scotland, Wales). She/he represents the responsible for a policy approach in order to guarantee that the needs of specific services, of health protection, of safety are respected in a condition of progressive increase of the mean age of the population. On the other side, he/she as member of the Cabinet can interact with the other ministers so that the specificity of old age can be considered in the politic choices adopted by the latter ones in the different branches of the Government activity such as health, industry, environment, education, transportation.\n\nRelated is the support that by this minister can be ensured to the Silver Economy. This looks holistic ally at the ageing of population and at the opportunities it presents starting from permanent education able to ensure citizens responsible choices in occasion of referendums and petitions, from new available technologies and new sectors of market, from the percentage (meanly 20%) of Gross Domestic Product dedicated to it, from health prevention and, last but not least from the disables policy due to the connection of it with the focal points of Silver Economy.\n\nBy Dr. Luigi Campanella, Professor Emeritus, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy & General Secretary, European Association of Professors Emeriti\n\nZoom meeting of Professors Emeriti Network on April 6, 2022.\n\nInvitation to Associations and Networks\n\nGlobal Network of Associations & Networks: Retirees Developing Silver Economy\n\nApril 25, 2022\n\nTo a representative of the network or association of aged professionals (emeriti, retired, senior researchers) in the world\n\nDear Representative,\n\nWe are sending you this message with the intention of proposing the signing of a formal agreement on the program between all addressed networks and associations, which looks at two objectives:\n\n– Create conditions for the professionalism and knowledge of older people, especially cultural and professional ones, to be made available to society for life counseling and for lifelong adult education. Knowledge is the engine of life and whoever has it must be willing to share it with others.\n\n– Encourage the establishment of a Minister of Seniors and the Silver Economy in all countries (Minister of Seniors Appointment. Position Paper, April 21, 2021; An appeal for the establishment of ministries for seniors in all countries of the European Union, The Bulletin of the European association of professors emeriti, 2022).\n\nThe envisaged cooperation is aimed at accelerating the use of eServices provided by the Internet. It is not related to costs.\n\nIf, as we warmly hope, your network / association is interested in signing the proposed agreement, let us know. Please also let us know the reasons for any negative response.\n\nThank you and best greetings.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nDr. Luigi Campanella, Professor Emeritus\n\nSapienza University of Rome, Italy\n\nGeneral Secretary, European Association of Professors Emeriti\n\nLuigi.Campanella@UniRoma1.it\n\nDr. Jože Gričar, Professor Emeritus\n\nUniversity of Maribor, Slovenia\n\nSecretary, Professors Emeriti Network & Secretary, eSeniors 55+ Network\n\nJoze.Gricar@UM.si\n\nAction Focused Online Meetings\n\nZoom Meeting on Wednesday, June 1, 2022, 17:00 – 19:00 Central European Summer Time (CEST)\n\nDiscussion on further steps in the Network direction.\n\nChair:\n\nDr. Luigi Campanella, Senior Professor, Department of Chemistry, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy\n\nPast General Secretary, European Association of Professors Emeriti – EAPE\n\nGeneral Secretary of Italian Committee of EAPE\n\nLuigi.Campanella@UniRoma1.it\n\nGlobal Network Meeting June 1 2022 Participants\n\nCoordinators\n\nDr. Luigi Campanella, Senior Professor, Department of Chemistry, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy\n\nPast General Secretary, European Association of Professors Emeriti – EAPE\n\nGeneral Secretary of Italian Committee of EAPE\n\nLuigi.Campanella@UniRoma1.it\n\nDr. Jože Gričar, Professor Emeritus, University of Maribor, Slovenia\n\nSecretary, Professors Emeriti Network\n\nProgram Coordinator, Inter-Municipality Initiative: Cross-border eCollaboration in the eRegion\n\nJoze.Gricar@UM.si\n\nFounding Members\n\nDr. Luigi Campanella, Professor Emeritus\n\nSapienza University of Rome, Italy\n\n& General Secretary, European Association of Professors Emeriti\n\nLuigi.Campanella@UniRoma1.it\n\nGeorge Christodoulou, Professor Emeritus\n\nUniversity of Athens Medical School, Greece\n\n& President, Society Preventive Psychiatry\n\nProfGChristodoulou@gmail.com\n\nDr. Lucija Čok, Professor Emerita, Scientific Counselor\n\nFormer Rector, University of Primorska, Slovenia\n\nLucija.Cok@UPr.si\n\nDr. Jože Gričar, Professor Emeritus\n\nUniversity of Maribor, Slovenia\n\nProgram Coordinator, Inter-Municipality Initiative: Cross-border eCollaboration in the eRegion\n\nSecretary, Professors Emeriti Network & Secretary, eSeniors 55+ Network\n\nJoze.Gricar@UM.si\n\nDr.Dr.h.c.

Having a dedicated Minister of Seniors is beneficial in ensuring that the unique needs of this demographic are being met.\n\nAdditionally, a Minister of Seniors could be responsible for addressing issues related to healthcare, social security, and pension plans, which are important concerns for many seniors. They could also work to promote policies and initiatives that improve the quality of life for seniors, such as providing more affordable housing options, improving access to transportation, and increasing funding for programs that support mental and physical health.\n\nHonourable Mark Butler, MP, Minister for Health and Aged Care\n\nHouse of Representatives, Australian Government\n\nHonourable Seamus O’Regan Jr., MP, Minister of Labour and Seniors\n\nGovernment of Canada\n\nHonourable Mary Butler TD, Minister for Mental Health and Older People\n\nGovernment of Ireland\n\nHonourable Jo Etienne Abela, Minister for Health and Active Ageing\n\nGovernment of Malta\n\nHonourable Dr Ayesha Verrall, Cabinet Minister of Health and Research, Science and Innovation\n\nNew Zealand Government\n\nHonourable Emma Roddick, Minister for Equalities, Migration and Refugees\n\nScottish Government\n\nHonourable Heléna Herklots, Older People’s Commissioner\n\nWelsh Government\n\nHonourable Dubravka Šuica, Commissioner for Democracy and Demography & Vice-President, European Commission\n\nMinister of Seniors.
