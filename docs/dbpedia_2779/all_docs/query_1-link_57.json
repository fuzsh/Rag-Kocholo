        "text": "Case in point, this album is extremely underrated. I don't see how this album gets SO much shit, because it is a very good album. Critics now and days just bash shit without giving it a real chance, and all of the \"purists\" hate mostly anything new that digresses from the sound of the late 80's/early 90's, which is plain ignorance. So, if you are one of the \"purists\" of metal, than don't give this album attention, and by that I mean don't even review it.\n\nFor people with an open mind, this isn't TOO far from the normal death metal. The only major difference with this band is the industrial/electronic influence. To some this is an automatic turn-off, but for others (including myself), I think it's very innovative and sounds great. There really aren't many bands, if any, that sound like Daath.\n\nThe lyrics are very in depth and interesting. The whole concept of the album is the thirteen different sides to the human Pysche, or something like that. The vocals are good, but nothing extraordinary. The guitars are one of the highlights, because Daath really knows how to write a song. They focus more of rhythm than lead, which I like alot. Also, the guitarists are amazing at syncing while playing, I've seen them do it live and man they play as if they were one. The bass is good, audible, but nothing over the top, basically follows the guitars. The drumming is another highlight of the album. Kevin Talley is just a great drummer. Aside from his amazing drumming skill, he also has a very good taste for sound. He knows how to adjust his cymbals, kicks, snares, and toms to match the music. To say the least, the man knows what he is doing. The biggest highlight to this album is the keyboards. They really add a depth to the atmosphere that many bands couldn't touch. Some songs are more traditionally oriented, such as subterfuge and ovum, but most songs have a great deal of keys. Cosmic Forge and Under A Somber Sign really show off the greatest keys in this album. Some songs are also dance influenced, such as Who Will Take The Blame? and Dead on the Dancefloor. I really love this song because it's just a different kind of metal song. I never thought a metal band could produce something like this and do it so well.\n\nOverall, I found this album incredibly enjoyable. Great riffs and great melodies. The keys add an important role to the music. A lot of people hate this album, maybe because they are signed too roadrunner? I don't know. But too those who enjoy many genres of music, you will enjoy this gem.\n\nStarting in 2003 in Atlanta, the band self-released their debut album Futility on their own before getting signed onto Roadrunner Records. Daath has been positioned as Roadrunner's hot new signing and re-entry into the extreme metal genre. A lot of hype, and hyperbole has been used up to describe this band. The band has been called everything from Avant-garde to industrial metal.\n\nSo what is this band all about ? Do they deserve the hype surrounding them or is it all a part of the usual Roadrunner pre album release hoopla ?\n\nWell, sadly, Daath does not really live up to expectations. Take every form of extreme metal thats been popular over the last five years; say Swedish melodic death metal, Dimmu Borgir style symphonic black metal and Strapping Young Lad styled industrial metal. Now, put all three in a blender and the resulting cocktail will give you a rough idea of what Daath does.\n\nCase in point is the song Illuminator. Starting off with a Strapping Young Lad style riff, the band moves onto some really lame sampled drum sounds, some even lamer synth sounds and riffs that you know you've heard before. Now, I don't have a problem with bands throwing in different styles of music into their sound. Some of my favourite bands do just that, but when you're ripping off At The Gates, SYL and Dimmu Borgir song after song, things get a little tiring. Dead On The Dancefloor's use of electronica is embarrassing to say the least and again this is something that bands like Front Line Assembly did in the 90s. Inversion starts off sounding like a SYL song before going off into some really generic metalcore riffing and then on to some At The Gates and The Haunted style riffing and finally a melodic guitar harmony part that reeks of Euro-metal and it's not that great a part either. There isn't a hint of originality on these songs. Blessed Through Misery has hints of Euro metal again particularly in the lead guitar section and the ending where the band sound a little like Evergrey. Everything here has been done before by far superior bands.\n\nI must say that the production on this album is terrific and serves as a good smoke screen to hide the fact that Daath is doing absolutely nothing new and the songs aren't all that great.\n\nStill, being an unoriginal extreme metal band is hardly cause for a death sentence and the band are very competent musicians. I just wish they'd written better songs. I think Roadrunner is counting on kids who are buying into the current trend of metalcore to be same ones to buy into Daath (maybe even as their ticket to the metal underground). Now, don't be surprised if, the next time you meet your baggy pant and wallet chain wearing friend he talks to you about this great new underground band called Daath. Seriously, don't believe the hype.\n\nI'm sorry that this review isn't very objective and it's turned into more of a rant but honestly, this is unoriginal, insipid music and the sort of metal that really pisses me off.\n\nhttp://www.kvltsite.com\n\nAs a maturing adult with many memorable life experiences, I think bullshit can be spotted a mile away. We’ve all have had times when we see someone or hear something that makes us feel uncomfortable for no good reason, but we always hold our gut feeling over fact itself no matter what happens. With that being said, I’d like to share a little tale about a negative atmosphere I sensed after hearing some fishy news about the union of Daath and Roadrunner Records in 2006.\n\nIt usually isn’t a big deal when a label picks up a band; however, I felt my bullshit meter hitting an all-time high when I got wind of Roadrunner’s latest pickup. I never liked our friends at Roadrunner, because they always favored trendy poopers over real substance, and I felt the signing of Daath was a bit too hazy for such a record company. Needless to say, Roadrunner hyped Daath’s label debut, “The Hinderers,” as a real death metal album until the spotlight was focused on this mysterious faction, which was a very clever move, because they forgot to mention something during all the press: Daath isn’t death metal!\n\nWhat a surprise, right? Roadrunner Records had once again done the unexpected by switching terms to get more sales from devoted metal fans. With the sarcasm sidelined, “The Hinderers” is all you could expect, meaning it’s a ridiculous attempt to sound heavy and brutal, but is actually one of the worst efforts in both heavy metal, and mainstream rock. To put it in simple terms: it sucks in every way you could possibly think of.\n\nWhy is this album so terrible? Well, there are countless reasons, but I think Daath’s self-proclaimed “death metal” approach unquestionably takes the cake. “The Hinderers” is not a death metal album in any way at all, but rather a mindless tribute to Devildriver, Static-X, Fear Factory, and other mallcore bands under the impression they are somehow metal. Everything that makes nu-metal so awful is glorified here, including repetitive groove riffs, poorly-performed solos, terrible lyrics, directionless samples, and almost no bass audio at all. Sure the singer uses growling vocals and you’ll hear any occasional blastbeat section, but does that instantly grant a death metal label to whoever uses it? I didn’t think so.\n\nBeside all the nu-metal masturbation, “The Hinderers” is ruined by failed attempts to sound epic, annoying electronica beeps, horrible growling vocals, and guitar playing with no technical qualities whatsoever. All these problems are found in every waking moment of this CD, but some of the tunes deserve an award for how shitty they are. Here’s some of the nominations and a brief reason why they should be acknowledged: “Cosmic Forge,” because it has sloppy piano arrangements with awful vocal patterns; “From The Blind,” because it’s covered in total nu-metal riffing and has a horrible chorus; “Festival Mass Soulform,” because it sounds like an actual circus with a ghastly attempt to play a revolving keyboard pattern over dumb groove riffs, and the viewer’s choice: “Dead on The Dance Floor,” because it’s a disco-laden tribute to Saturday Night Fever with dance beats and some of the worst instrumentation I’ve ever heard. “Ovum” is the one song worth mentioning because it actually sounds somewhat metal, but it still suffers from constant repetition, breakdowns, and a JUMPDAFUCKUP chorus. I’m convinced a teebag from a walrus would be more enjoyable than hearing this bowel movement again, and that’s total honesty.\n\nI concluded Daath to be musically worthless ages ago, but the grueling reviewing process of “The Hinderers” has opened my eyes to the philosophical attack this group is trying to execute. The rules of death metal have been practically spoon fed to its followers, but Daath apparently thinks they can just defecate on everything that made brutal music what it is today and do things their own way. Death metal touches have been forced unwillingly into a melting pot of nu-metal and electronica among other lame things, but here’s the catch: it’s considered good death metal by the mainstream! Folks with no death metal experience will hear this and assume this is what death metal is supposed to be; they’ll hear the disco, the nu-metal, the breakdowns, and they’ll want more of it. It’s much like the fiasco of Trivium being a thrash group, but with a more fragile genre, and certainly one that hasn’t gained any modern exposure at all. Daath has the power to screw over the virtues of death metal with the flick of their wrists, and the chance of them doing so is heavily increased by the band’s growing base of mindless zombies who ignore true talent and worship what’s hip to them. It’s a sad reality, but one must realize it is a very likely scenario with “The Hinderers” floating around.\n\nBad things have passed my ears before, but “The Hinderers” is one of the most repulsive musical attempts I’ve ever heard. No argument of any kind could convince me this is decent music on any level, and I think it’s a total embarrassment to death metal in every way possible. Nu-metal mallgoths will certainly orgy to this, but anyone who takes their metal seriously should simply leave “The Hinderers” on the rack and let the posers have fun. Not sure about you guys, but I think this record deserves a score you can see through: a zero.\n\nEvery time I hear about a death metal band getting signed to Roadrunner, I always play the extreme skeptic. The days when the label could call Death, Obituary, and Cynic their own are long behind us. Would an acquisition like Daath harken to the glory days of old, or become another forgettable band aimed squarely at the Hot Topic crowd?\n\nThe answer is a resounding no to both claims. The Hinderers is not a “true” death metal release by any stretch of the imagination, but it should not be automatically lumped in the mallcore category with most of Roadrunner’s lineup. What we have here is an earnestly entertaining effort, a little lacking in depth yet bursting with catchy riffs and rhythms. Eyal Levi and Emil Werstler certainly know their way around a fretboard, and the precise drumming courtesy of well-known band-whore Kevin Talley adds a solid groove to the experience.\n\nBut what do they actually sound like? I’ve heard them called Industrial Metal and I’ve heard them called Death Metal although they don’t really fit the mold of either. Daath seems to be the lovechild of Wages of Sin-era Arch Enemy and Arsis. They demonstrate the melodies and harmonies of the former combined with the technicality and brutality of the latter and some fairly run-of-the-mill vocals. Just to be a little different though, Daath spends the weekends with uncle Static-X to get an electronic cherry on top. While these electronics are certainly not the prime focus of most songs (save for the funky, club-tastic “Dead on the Dancefloor”), they certainly help Daath stand out from the rest of the melodic death metal pack.\n\nThe production, handled by the very proficient James Murphy, is excellent as one would expect. The drums sound punishing, the guitars are clear and crisp, and the keyboards complement the sound well without overwhelming the mix. The only thing that gets smothered by it all is the Jeremy Creamer’s bass, but seeing that the bass doesn’t seem to be doing anything interesting anyway it’s not exactly a tragic loss. Writing more interesting parts for metal’s forgotten instrument could certainly add another layer of depth for future releases.\n\nThe most memorable tracks on The Hinderers tend to be the fastest ones; whirlwind songs like “Ovum” and the wisely-selected first single “Subterfuge” keep the album moving at a brisk pace. Where Daath seems to falter, however, is in the slower mid-paced songs: for the most part they’re just not very interesting. I found myself hitting the skip button after just a few listens of “Under a Somber Sign” and “Festival Mass Soulform”, while filler like “Above Lucium” could put a cokehead to sleep. Another complaint could be that the tracks are too short, all hitting around the 3-4 minute mark. For other bands this might be all well and good, but Daath’s epic sound in places (like the close of the title track) cries for more development and progression.\n\nOverall though, the good tends to outweigh the bad on this album, and it is a very big step ahead of their much simpler independent debut, Futility. Metal elitists will turn up their noses due to the more mainstream sound, but those with an open mind can find plenty to love here. The Hinderers isn’t going to change your life, but it’s a good listen and an excellent major label debut for these guys from Atlanta.\n\nOriginally written for: www.smnnews.com\n\nI'll be honest. This review is mostly to correct the drivel I just read in the other review of The Hinderers. Daath deserves way better. Try listening to this album without your head in your ass and you'll hear what I did.\n\nIf you heard Daath's previous release, Futility, you'll still hear a few traces of the old electronic driven material, but for the most part this is just some seriously catchy and seriously heavy death metal. Yes, death metal. The riffs are easily the most infectious thing I've listened to in quite a while. Even the vocal lines get stuck in my head and they're nothing but a solid roar with none of the clean singing found on Futility. On top of all that, the leads and solos are amazing courtesy of Eyal Levi and Emil Werstler and guest solos from James Murphy (Who Will Take the Blame?) and James Malone of Arsis (Blessed Through Misery). They manage to be very technical but fit with the songs and be memorable.\n\nFrom start to finish this is a well written album. Even an entertaining track like \"Dead on the Dancefloor\" slowly becomes heavier and heavier until you've forgotten that you just heard a dance beat on a death metal album. The keyboards add some depth to the tracks as well but are rarely the focal point. There are parts in nearly every song where a bouncing riff or killer lead comes out of nowhere and forces me to exclaim aloud, \"Fuck yes!\" and I'm frequently forced to rewind and experience it all over again. Colin Richardson, Andy Sneap and James Murphy all had a hand in parts of the mixing/production/recording so you should know ahead of time that The Hinderers sounds fantastic. In addition, Kevin Talley joined the band after the record was finished so he doesn't get to take credit for the excellent drumming that supports this fantastic music.\n\nAnother plus for the album is intelligent lyrics that are the beginning of a 13 album concept highlighting the various aspects of the Tree of Life. There's plenty of information on all that on Daath's official site if you're interested.\n\nChoosing the best tracks is extremely difficult because there isn't a weak track on here. Best of the best would have to be \"The Hinderers,\" \"Blessed Through Misery,\" \"Subterfuge,\" \"From the Blind,\" and of course \"Dead on the Dance Floor\" for not being afraid to throw in something a little different and still maintaining the feel of the record. Every time I listen I change my mind on which tracks are the best so that should tell you something as well.\n\nDaath have progressed light years from Futility (which I still like) and I'm really not sure how they're going to pull off another 12 albums if they've set the bar this high with the Hinderers."
