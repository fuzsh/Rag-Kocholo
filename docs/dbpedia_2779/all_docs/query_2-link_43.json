        "text": "Kind of an offshoot of the \"do you have friends who mock your taste\" thread. If this is a repost fail then obviously go ahead and delete this thread.\n\nWarning: Mental masturbation ahead, this is nearly an essay:\n\nI've attempted to think about why I actually like death metal but I've never really been able to come to anything conclusive. I mean, I listen to music that can involve having sex with dead children, raping animals, murdering women, torture, murder in general, hatred of the human race, etc. Lyrically, death metal is perverse, disgusting, and vulgar (not in the \"omg swearing lol\" sense, vulgar meaning conspicuous, not sugar-coated, frank). Musically it is nearly impossible to decipher. The vocals are usually unintelligible and to an untrained ear, death metal really does sound like a bunch of pots and pans being bashed together and none of the guys really sound like they have any talent, besides the drummer, provided the mix is good. Apparently there have been sociologists who say that people have an interest in the body and a sense of morbidity, which death metal obviously appeals to. I'm not an especially morbid person, I don't like real death. Death metal certainly doesn't \"glorify\" its subject matter. How can a band that maybe 0.001% of the population know about be \"glorifying\" anything with any appreciable effects? Cannibal Corpse isn't saying \"I killed a man earlier today and I highly recommend it to anyone. I was more highly regarded by my peers after doing so. We ought to kill more often.\" in their lyrics, are they? Over the top death metal (such as Torsofuck) are obviously tongue-in-cheek, it's purely shock value catering to an audience who are aware of the extreme nature of what they listen to and so can laugh at a song about a cat being raped or erotic fantasies about diarrhea or whatever. It's obviously supposed to be somewhat funny.\n\nMusically, death metal has a truly visceral element that I love for some reason. It makes the hair on my arms stand on end. I have the most difficulty trying to nail down the aesthetic of death metal which appeals to me. It's definitely an acquired taste. The first time I heard \"The Bleeding\" by Cannibal Corpse I was dying laughing at it, but eventually something clicked and I actually loved the music and began taking it very seriously. A few years pass and now I'm a full blown death metal fan who seeks out new music. I know what I like and I get it. It's definitely a form of mid-high culture in the sense that it's not \"lowbrow\" mainstream music, a lot of it is independently produced (IE anything on Relapse, but Metal Blade is apparently owned by Sony) and the people who like it are seeking to cultivate a specific taste, death metal fans are certainly a sort of connoisseur. That's not to say we're a bunch of pretentious toolboxes, but we do have a lot in common with a \"hipster\" as far as the nature of our musical taste goes. There does not exist a single \"mainstream\" death metal band. Cannibal Corpse was in an Ace Ventura movie for a few minutes, that is it. There probably (hopefully) never will be a mainstream death metal band. It's even questionable that a death metal fan is buying into a commodity (I study sociology, forgive me). I mean yes, records are for sale and therefore have a profit in mind so yeah they are a commodity in that sense but for a lot of bands, their music does not earn them an appreciable income so their music is effectively supported by their day jobs. I'm bringing this up because your stereotypical \"indie\" kid buys \"indie\" music because he thinks he's not contributing to capitalism because he's not buying Lil Wayne, but he's completely wrong. Maybe they're just being ironic. I'm getting a tad off track though.\n\nPolitically, I am against forms of oppression (so I guess I'm technically against most forms of government but I live in a cushy Western country with a high standard of living so my mouth is kept shut for the most part) so I guess that rebellious streak is satisfied by the rebellious nature of metal. Still, there's the contradiction of rebellion in that it depends on the thing it is rebelling against. A punk with liberty spikes is against the grain only because most other people don't have liberty spikes. There would be no point in having liberty spikes to be rebellious if everyone else had them, let alone the whole \"you can be non-conformist too if you look just like me\" deal. I see rebellion (where it applies like cultural rebellion, not stuff like armed coups or anything) as inherently conformist in that regard.\n\nSo if you say \"I like it because it's brutal.\" What exactly makes it brutal/heavy/savage/whatever? Pat O'Brien (Cannibal Corpse, from the Wretched Spawn DVD) doesn't exactly put it eloquently \"it's the most brutal music there is...it's a slap in the face to queer kinds of music.\" What makes the other music \"queer?\" Is he trying to get at some kind of gendered thing? Is death metal extremely \"manly?\" Does it satisfy his ideals of \"manliness?\"\n\nI don't know. Maybe the gory aspect of death metal is symptomatic of something in society or even human nature, if such a thing exists. I still don't know why I really like death metal.\n\ntl;dr, why do you like death/extreme metal of whatever variety? Why do you REALLY like it? \"It's brutal\" is a cop out. Try to pin down the main reasons why you like what you like. Mentally masturbate if you want, I don't judge.\n\nI don't really feel like typing out an essay, but I'll just post one I had to write a while ago.\n\nThere's a lot of bullshit in this essay but whatever right?\n\nDeath metal is the most diverse genre in modern music today; and arguably, the worlds most technical demanding from of music standing next to genres such as jazz and classical. How is death metal the least bit diverse? How is it even remotely technical? All I hear is a bunch of static with some barking. Those were my initial thoughts as well, but the more I listened and the more time I spent researching it, the more I became persuaded otherwise.\n\nSo how is death metal full of variety? Its diverse in a variety of different ways. First and foremost is the plethora of sub-genres that fall under death metal. They manage to blend genres such as folk, classical, jazz, and even Pink Floyd-esque progressive rock with death metal. Some even take things a step further, abandoning common western/European concepts all-together and instead opting to fuse death metal with eastern sounds; instead using Arabic or Indian scales. One band, Alchemist, is heavily influenced by aboriginal music. In sharp contrast, when is the last time you heard a rock band successfully incorporate classical elements?\n\nThis all plays into the instrumentation of the music when you listen to it. While not at all blatantly obvious sometimes, its the nuances in the execution of the music that give testament to its diversity. A great example of this is the drumming used by the technical death metal band Cryptopsy. While at first the drumming may sound like someone hitting everything as fast as they can; in reality its actually jazz drumming sped up to ridiculous speeds with double kick (a jazz drummer usually has one kick pedal) work incorporated. A number of techniques have also been borrowed from other genres. Perhaps the most obvious example of this is the usage of the blastbeat in death metal. Its a staple technique to death metal, much like rice is a staple food of many Asian cultures. Except that this staple was taken from jazz musicians such as Tony Williams (famous for his work with Miles Davis), and Sunny Murray (an influential free jazz drummer). Another fantastic example is tremolo picking. This technique involves playing a number of notes as fast as possible by a guitarist/bassist in the band. It originally popularized on the guitar by surf rock guitarists, then sped up and complexified by death metal guitarists.\n\nNow what makes this all so technical? Death metals prime source of technicality comes from its devastatingly high speeds. Most music we hear today on the radio is played at a standard 120 bpm (beats per minute), the fast paced music is probably around 160 bpm. In sharp contrast a slower death metal song is around 160 to 180bpm with speeds sometimes reaching up to 300bpm. Another huge contributor to the technicality of this music is the fact that there are no rules for writing death metal. Most pop songs tend to follow a strict structure that goes something like, intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, final chorus and the maybe an outro. Much like the five paragraph essay, this structure is overused and boring. While still capable of creating great pieces of work; it gets more than a little tedious. In sharp contrast, death metal follows no strict structure, often omitting choruss all together in order to avoid being repetitive and forcing the writer to be creative instead of reverting to a chorus. Finally, the timing used in death metal is very complex. Most music on the radio tends to be in 4/4, or sometimes 3/4; and stay in the same timing for the duration of the song. Conversely, death metal is played in several different time signatures such as 7/8, ,5/4, 9/8 and many more.\n\nBy way of example, it is evident that death metal is easily the most diverse genre in modern music as well. Its many sub-genres that host other genres ranging from jazz to electronica are a perfect testament to this. Death metal is also undoubtedly technically demanding. Forcing its musicians to not only be able to reproduce what musicians from other genres are capable of doing, but at a significantly higher calibre."
