        "text": "An Extremely Fascinating Worldview\n\nBoston has given us a few pretty good rock bands over the years. There is The Cars, J Geils Band, The Pixies, Aerosmith, and of course, Boston. But one stands out for their musical creativity, sheer technical ability, and the variety of styles they have demonstrated over their multi-decade career. Extreme, like the name of the band, also describes their musical acumen and performance ability.\n\nFounded in 1985 when Nuno Bettencourt (guitars, keyboards, and vocals) and Gary Cherone (vocals) found their mutual love for the band Queen, Extreme went on to release their first album in 1989 and found superstardom with their 1990 acoustic ballad, More Than Words. Over the intervening years, they have released a total of 6 albums with their latest, SIX, dropping this year. Their current lineup consists of Nuno, Gary, Pat Badger (bass and vocals), and Kevin Figueiredo (drums). Previous lineups have included founding drummer Paul Geary and stellar percussionist and current Dream Theater drummer Mike Mangini.\n\nGary Cherone, the main lyricist, writes many introspective songs and has never been afraid to sing about his deep catholic faith. This spiritual bent also shines through in his other projects like Hurtsmile and Tribe of Judah. As far back as the very first album (Extreme, 1989) we find the song Watching, Waiting describing the crucifixion of Christ:\n\nHanging above the ground\n\nAll my limbs are bound\n\nYou’re on the right hand\n\nWith your head down\n\nTears from eyes that cannot see\n\nHe took the blame from me\n\nSo shall it be written\n\nSo shall it be done\n\nWatching, waiting\n\nStaring at the Son\n\nNot even knowing\n\nWho you are\n\nThree hours have gone by\n\nWe start to question why\n\nDarkness falls in finding out\n\nWhy you must die\n\nWe can no longer see the Son\n\nThe three unite into one\n\nPlease forgive us Father\n\nWe know not what we’ve done\n\nThe Christian worldview is all over their breakthrough release, Pornograffitti. The entire album is a loose concept about an innocent tempted by the decadence in the world. Songs like Money (In God We Trust) explore the emptiness of money worship and the track Stop the World is a modern retelling of Ecclesiastes Chapter 1. This theme of the emptiness of the world continues into their third album, III Sides to Every Story. God Isn’t Dead? Laments the pain in the world and the search for a loving God:\n\nI look at all the lonely people\n\nLosing faith\n\nIn a world full of despair no one who cares\n\nWondering where God disappeared\n\nI see the pain in everybody’s faces\n\nAsking why\n\nThe God up in the sky\n\nDidn’t say goodbye please tell me\n\nGod didn’t die\n\nPlease tell me God isn’t dead\n\nPlease tell me God isn’t dead\n\nPlease tell me God isn’t\n\nI wanna know if He’s\n\nPlease tell me God isn’t\n\nTell me God isn’t dead\n\nThe very next song on III Sides to Every Story is a creative amalgamation of the book of Daniel’s prophecies and another look at Ecclesiastes. No, nothing under the sun is new but hope is free and a new day is coming:\n\nI had a dream, not unlike the one from old\n\nOf a man king, whose head was made of gold\n\nStand castles of sand\n\nWeather sundials rise ‘n fall\n\nChasing wind through your hands\n\n‘Til water runs dry the well\n\nDream, Daniel dream\n\nFor what’s yet to come\n\nSee, Daniel see\n\nFor every thing’s under the sun\n\nAnd in the west, a cloud appears\n\nFor shadows of a coming shower near\n\nOh, so near\n\n(Hypocrites)\n\nYou analyze the earth and the sky\n\nI ask you why you can’t analyze the signs\n\nOf the present time?\n\nVanity\n\nYes, all is vanity\n\nVanity\n\nYes, all is futility\n\nFor one that dies, another’s born\n\nWhere laughter’s heard, comforters mourn\n\nThere’s a time for everything\n\nA song for love, even abhor\n\nAn olive branch or a winter’s war\n\nThere’s a time for everything\n\nUnder the sun\n\nUnder the sun\n\nRise, rise ‘n shine\n\nA new day is coming\n\nRise, rise in time\n\nFor every thing’s under the sun\n\n(Rise) A new day is coming\n\nWhen there’s the time for everything under the sun\n\nYou know a time for everything under the sun\n\nBecause a new day is gonna be begun\n\nGary’s most introspective lyric comes from the III Sides song, Am I Ever Gonna Change. The lyrical theme is lifted straight from Romans 7 and looks at a man who is tired of doing what he knows is wrong and wants to change:\n\nI’m tired of being me,\n\nAnd I don’t like what I see,\n\nI’m not who I appear to be\n\nSo I start off every day,\n\nDown on my knees I will pray,\n\nFor a change in any way\n\nBut as the day goes by,\n\nI live through another lie,\n\nIf it’s any wonder why\n\nAm I ever gonna change\n\nWill I always stay the same\n\nIf I say one thing,\n\nThen I do the other\n\nIt’s the same old song,\n\nThat goes on forever\n\nAm I ever gonna change\n\nI’m the only one to blame\n\nWhen I think I’m right,\n\nI wind up wrong\n\nIt’s a futile fight,\n\nGone on too long\n\nPlease tell me if it’s true,\n\nAm I too old to start anew,\n\n‘Cause that’s what I want to do\n\nBut time and time again,\n\nWhen I think I can,\n\nI fall short in the end\n\nSo why do I even try,\n\nWill it matter when I die,\n\nCan anyone hear my cry?\n\nAm I ever gonna change\n\nTake it day by day\n\nMy will is weak\n\nAnd my flesh too strong\n\nThis peace I seek\n\nTill thy kingdom comes\n\nThe III Sides final song, Who Cares?, shows Gary asking Jesus himself if he is angry at him for being a sheep gone astray. As he slips further from Christ, the brightness of God’s glory fades:\n\nTell me, Jesus, are you angry?\n\nOne more sheep has just gone astray\n\nA hardening of hearts, turning to stone\n\nWandering off so far from home\n\nSo many children losing time\n\nWalk in darkness, looking for a sign\n\nChasing their rainbows, the future looks so bright\n\nSlowly we’re losing sight of the light\n\nWho cares?\n\nWho cares?\n\nWho cares?\n\nTell me who cares?\n\nWho cares?\n\nAll alone out in the cold\n\nCan’t look back, am I growing old?\n\nI chose a path, is this my fate?\n\nAm I finding out the truth too late?\n\nWho cares?\n\nWho cares?\n\nWho cares?\n\nTell me who cares?\n\nHere I am, a naked man\n\nNothing to hide with empty hands\n\nRemember me, I am the one\n\nWho lost his way, your Prodigal Son\n\nAm I ever gonna change?\n\nWill I always stay the same?\n\nSay one thing, then I do the other\n\nSame old song goes on forever\n\n(Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?\n\nTell me who cares? Who cares?)\n\nRise, rise and shine\n\nA new day is coming, yes, it is\n\nIII Sides closes on the promise of a new day and the stripped down Waiting for the Punchline album opens by seemingly declaring that God doesn’t exist. But upon further examination of There Is No God, Cherone is saying the opposite:\n\nConfused, they talk in parables\n\nAccused, they walk in parallels\n\nA simple game of Simon says\n\nThis month’s flavor sciences\n\nToday’s fact, tomorrow’s fiction\n\nLeave the rest to superstition\n\nIf knowledge comes from learning books\n\nWisdom comes from discerning looks\n\nA fool that says there is no God\n\nDon’t feel for that sorry sod\n\nWho needs proof then he’ll believe\n\nI wonder if he’s been deceived\n\nThe Waiting for the Punchline album also tackles the subject of cults (Evilangelist) and shallow faith (Fair Weather Faith). And where Fair Weather Faith looks at the empty prayers of the non-believer, the next album, Saudades de Rock, employs us to turn to prayer when life suffocating:\n\nHeavy is the burden\n\nThat brings you\n\nTo your knees\n\nLost in the confusion\n\nOf life’s uncertainties\n\nFeel you’re suffocating\n\nWith every breath you take\n\nMoment left remaining\n\nTime for you to pray\n\nTime for you to pray\n\nPray for peace\n\nExtreme’s latest offering SIX brings back Extreme’s ferocious biting examination of society’s obsession with image and tribalism. The song The Mask does not mince words:\n\nWe’re all sinners we’re all saints\n\nWe’re all the people we say we ain’t\n\nWe’re all winners and we’re all cheats\n\nWe’re all the things that we want to defeat\n\nWe’re all innocent and we’re all pure\n\nWe’re all deceased and we’re all the cure\n\nWe’re all living and we’re already dead\n\nWe’re everything that we need to pretend\n\nRip of your mask and show me who you are\n\nShow me who you are, show me who you are\n\nRip of my mask show you who I am\n\nShow you who I am, show you who I am…\n\nWe’re all doubters and we’re all faith\n\nWe’re all the things that we want to replace\n\nWe’re all fiction and we’re all fact\n\nWe’re all the good and we’re all the bad\n\nI’ll take the blame for all my sins\n\nBut I won’t take the hate\n\nFor what you imagine…\n\nAnd neither does Thicker Than Blood:\n\nTranscending space and time\n\nBoundary or borderline\n\nNo nationality\n\nTribe or ethnicity\n\nNo link or lineage\n\nBloodline nor heritage\n\nNo genealogy\n\nFruit from a family\n\nLove is all, all you need\n\nLove is all, let it bleed\n\nDoes not discriminate\n\nWith color creed or race\n\nNo substitution\n\nOr blood transfusion\n\nBlood running through your vain\n\n(Blood) taking thy name in vain\n\n(Blood) faith hope and charity\n\n(Blood) blood has no guarantee\n\nJust take a look around\n\nThere’s so much to be found\n\nOpen your heart and you’ll find in you\n\nRomans 7 makes another appearance in Save Me:\n\nSave me from myself\n\nSave me from this hell\n\nHelp me heaven I’m forsaken\n\nLay me down to die\n\nCleanse me of these lies\n\nI’ve become what I despise\n\nTake me undertaker take me\n\nLay me down to die\n\nTake me as I am\n\nThis exploration of the spiritual side of Extremes lyrics ends with the song X OUT from Six. Gary seamlessly merges the parables of the prodigal son and the rich man and Lazarus. The wayward son is also the rich man who fell from grace and finds himself in torment. He looks across the great divide and sees Lazarus in paradise. He realizes that had he practiced Faith, Hope and Love, his eternity might look very different:\n\nOne man suffering forever damned\n\nThe other in the bosom of Abraham\n\nLooking on beyond the great divide…\n\nDarkness drapes both sun and moon\n\nAfter the rain storm clouds return\n\nStrong men bow and the house keeper’s quake…\n\nSevered is the silver chord\n\nBroken like the golden gourd\n\nDust returns to death from whence it came…\n\nX Out X Out, Faith\n\nX Out X Out, Hope\n\nX Out X Out, Love\n\nSo, is Extreme a “Christian” band? No, they have never claimed to be. Is Extreme a band that displays a decidedly Christian world view? In many of their songs, yes. Gary Cherone is outspoken about his beliefs and is not ashamed to sing about spiritual matters. Nuno Bettencourt is a fantastic player (one of the best) but he keeps his personal beliefs close and seemingly wants to talk music only. His interviews are very entertaining as his enthusiasm for music is contagious. They are sprinkled liberally with profanity though, so beware! The other two members do not give many interviews but none of the band seem to have a problem with Gary’s incredible lyrics.\n\nPrayer for this band is warranted as their new album is bringing new found fame and a new audience. Gary has welcomed his platform as a chance to challenge and speak out about his deeply held pro-life views. His two open letters to Eddie Vedder are incredibly poetic treatises on the value of all human life:\n\nAn Open Letter to Eddie Vedder\n\nWhen is a woman not a woman?\n\nTherein lies the only clear refutation of a woman’s rights.\n\nA woman’s rights —\n\nseems a mere tautology, a redundant catch phrase.\n\nAre not rights self evident?\n\nIntrinsic assumptions of the inalienable?\n\nSo, when is a woman not a woman,\n\na right not a right?\n\nWhen she doesn’t exist.\n\nWhen does a woman become a woman?\n\nIs it when\n\nher first ballot has been cast?\n\nOr when\n\nshe graduates from her class?\n\nIs it when\n\nshe makes a wish on her sweet sixteenth?\n\nWould I be amiss if it were her first kiss?\n\nIs it when\n\nshe’s diagnosed by the boy next door?\n\nOr as ambiguous as the cutting of the cord?\n\nIs it the time\n\nit takes to travel the distance through the canal?\n\nOr when\n\nshe’s kicking and becomes viable?\n\nIs it when\n\nher sex is discovered by a sonogram?\n\nOr after eight weeks when\n\nthe changes in her body will be mainly in dimension?\n\nIs it when\n\nher brain waves are detected after 40 days?\n\nOr is it around three weeks when\n\nher primitive heart beats?\n\nCan there be only one true line of demarcation?\n\nOne finite measurable point in time that differentiates\n\nlife from non-life?\n\nWomanhood from non-womanhood?\n\nRights from no right?\n\nIs it the moment of conception —\n\nthat point when all of the above is set in motion?\n\nThat precise moment when\n\n“a separate human individual, with her own genetic code,\n\nneeding only food, water, and oxygen, comes into existence”?\n\nIndeed,\n\nIt is at that point,\n\n“like the infant, the child, the adolescent,\n\nthat the conceptus is a being who is becoming,\n\nnot a becoming striving toward being.\n\nShe is not a potential life,\n\nshe is a life with great potential”.\n\nShe is not the mother,\n\nshe is an other —\n\na somebody other than the mother.\n\nA woman,\n\nhowever beautiful, however complex when fully grown,\n\nbegins life as a single cell, a zygote —\n\nthat stage in human development through which we all pass.\n\nShe fulfills “the four criteria necessary to all life —\n\nmetabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.\n\nHer genetic makeup is established at conception,\n\ndetermining to a great extent\n\nher own individual, physical characteristics”:\n\nher eyes, her hair, her skin color, bone structure, her gender.\n\nSo let us not be confused,\n\n“she did not come from a zygote — she once was a zygote.\n\nShe did not come from an embryo, she once was an embryo.\n\nShe did not come from a fetus, she once was a fetus”.\n\nShe did not come from a little girl — she once was a little girl.\n\nWhen is a woman not a woman?\n\nThe answer is absolute, non-negotiable.\n\nTo argue against would be to ignore the innate,\n\nthe fact of the matter.\n\nThe answer can never be a matter of opinion or choice.\n\nThis is not a metaphysical contention.\n\nThis is biology 101.\n\nThe answer is scientifically self-evident —\n\nas inherent as the inalienable.\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe ability to pursue happiness\n\nis contingent upon liberty —\n\nher liberty,\n\nand her freedom is solely dependent upon\n\nthe mother of all human rights…\n\nthe right of life.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGary Cherone\n\n(June 1999)\n\nWhat About the 98.6 Degree Angle?\n\nAnother Letter to Eddie Vedder\n\nby Gary Cherone\n\nThe vast majority of people who support abortion\n\ntake that position with the firm conviction\n\nthat life does not begin at conception\n\nThat being said…\n\nIf one personally felt “terminating pregnancy is not an easy thing”\n\nbut was the right of the individual to make that “decision”\n\nIs the life within the mother’s womb a human person?\n\nIf the answer is no, it is not a human person\n\nWhy would one feel it “is not an easy thing” to do?\n\nIf the answer is yes, it is a human person\n\nWhy would one advocate “terminating” it?\n\nIf the answer is I don’t know, if it is, or isn’t a human person\n\nHow many more “decision(s)”\n\nwould one make in an uncertain “situation”?\n\nIf the unborn is not a human person\n\nNo justification for abortion is necessary\n\nHowever…\n\nIf the unborn is a human person\n\nNo justification for abortion is adequate.\n\nNearly all arguments for abortion\n\nare based on the faulty premise\n\nthat the unborn are not fully human.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGary Cherone\n\n(1/22/2001)\n\nDoes Extreme belong in a publication like Heaven’s Metal Magazine? By looking at many of their lyrics, It appears they do. They have more direct “Christian” lyrics than many bands who openly claim to be Christian. Enjoy their music, enjoy their lyrics, pray for them as their audience expands.\n\nAbout Author"
