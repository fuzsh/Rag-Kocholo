Derivative Forms' Subgenres Melodic death metal − Technical death metal − Brutal death metal - Slam death metal Fusion Genres Deathgrind − Death/doom − Deathcore − Blackened death metal - Death 'n' Roll\n\nDeath metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It typically employs heavily distorted guitars, tremolo picking, deep growling vocals, double kick and/or blast beat drumming, minor keys or atonality, and multiple tempo changes.\n\nBuilding from the musical structure of thrash metal and biker metal. death metal emerged during the mid-1980s.[3] Metal bands such as Slayer,[4][5] Kreator,[6] Celtic Frost,[7] and Venom were very important influences to the crafting of the genre in extreme metal.[3] Possessed[8] and Death,[9][10][11] along with bands such as Obituary, Carcass, Deicide, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse and Morbid Angel are often considered pioneers of the genre.[12] In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as popular genre niche record labels like Combat, Earache and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.[13] Since then, death metal has diversified, spawning a variety of subgenres.[14]\n\nThe specific traits of death metal generally date back to the mid-1980s from the heavy metal of the 1970s, always characterized by having rhythmic elements coming from biker metal, when several bands began to incorporate the aggressive hard sound of thrash metal. , when death metal developed strongly towards the very specific and very dark rhythm of extreme metal, with the raw sound of hardcore punk. This genre is strongly much heavier compared to its relative, thrash metal.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEmergence and early history[]\n\nEnglish heavy metal band Venom, from Newcastle, crystallized the elements of what later became known as extreme metal, thrash metal, death metal , black metal and biker metal with their 1981 album Welcome to Hell.[15] Their dark metal, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands.[16] Another highly influential band, Slayer, formed in 1981. Although the band was a thrash metal act, Slayer's music was more violent than their thrash contemporaries Metallica, Megadeth and Exodus.[17] Their breakneck speed and instrumental prowess combined with lyrics about death, violence, war and Satanism won Slayer a rabid cult following.[18] According to Allmusic, Slayer's third album Reign in Blood \"inspired the entire death metal genre\".[19] It had a big impact on the genre leaders such as Death, Obituary and Morbid Angel.[17]\n\nPossessed, a band that formed in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1983, was attributed by Allmusic as \"connecting the dots\" between thrash metal and death metal with their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches.[22] While attributed as having a Slayer influence,[23] current and former members of the band had actually cited Venom and Motorhead, as well as early work by Exodus, as the main influences of their sound.[24][25] Although the group had released only 2 studio albums and an EP in their formative years, they have been described by both music journalists and musicians as either being \"monumental\" in developing the death metal style,[26] or as being the first death metal band.[27][28][29] Earache Records noted that \"....the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they were doing in their formative years on the Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary Seven Churches recording. Possessed arguably did more to further the cause of 'Death Metal' than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80's.\"[30]\n\nDuring the same period as the dawn of Possessed, a second influential metal band was formed in Florida: Death. Death, originally called Mantas, was formed during 1983 by Chuck Schuldiner, Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz. In 1984 they released their first demo entitled Death by Metal, followed by several more. The tapes circulated through the tape trader world, quickly establishing the band's name. With Death guitarist Schuldiner adopting vocal duties, the band made a major impact on the scene. The fast minor-key riffs and solos were complemented with fast drumming, creating a style that would catch on in tape trading circles.[31][32] Schuldiner has been attributed by Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia as being \"widely recognized as the Father of Death Metal\".[33] Death's 1987 debut release, Scream Bloody Gore, has been described by About.com's Chad Bowar as being the \"evolution from thrash metal to death metal\",[34] and \"the first true death metal record\" by the San Francisco Chronicle.[35]\n\nAlong with Possessed and Death, other pioneers of death metal in the United States include Autopsy, Necrophagia, Master, Morbid Angel, Massacre, Atheist, Post Mortem,[36][37][38] Obituary and Deicide.\n\nGrowing popularity[]\n\nBy 1989, many bands had been signed by eager record labels wanting to cash in on the subgenre, including Florida's Obituary, Morbid Angel and Deicide.[39] This collective of death metal bands hailing from Florida are often labeled as \"Florida death metal\". Death metal spread to Sweden in the late 1980s, flourishing with pioneers such as Carnage, God Macabre, Entombed, Dismember and Unleashed. In the early 1990s, the rise of typically melodic \"Gothenburg metal\" was recognized, with bands such as Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, and In Flames.\n\nFollowing the original death metal innovators, new subgenres began by the end of the decade. British band Napalm Death became increasingly associated with death metal, in particular, on 1990s Harmony Corruption. This album displays aggressive and fairly technical guitar riffing, complex rhythmics, a sophisticated growling vocal delivery by Mark \"Barney\" Greenway, and socially aware lyrical subjects, leading to a merging with the \"grindcore\" subgenre. Other bands contributing significantly to this early movement include Britain's Bolt Thrower and Carcass, and New York's Suffocation.\n\nTo close the circle, Death released their fourth album Human in 1991, an example of modern death metal. Death's founder Schuldiner helped push the boundaries of uncompromising speed and technical virtuosity, mixing technical and intricate rhythm guitar work with complex arrangements and emotive guitar solos.[40] Other examples are Carcass's Necroticism – Descanting the Insalubrious, Suffocation's Effigy of the Forgotten and Entombed's Clandestine from 1991. At this point, all the above characteristics are present: abrupt tempo and count changes, on occasion extremely fast drumming, morbid lyrics and growling vocal delivery.\n\nEarache Records, Relativity Records and Roadrunner Records became the genre's most important labels,[41] with Earache releasing albums by Carcass, Napalm Death, Morbid Angel, and Entombed, and Roadrunner releasing albums by Obituary, and Pestilence. Although these labels had not been death metal labels, initially, they became the genre's flagship labels in the beginning of the 1990s. In addition to these, other labels formed as well, such as Nuclear Blast, Century Media, and Peaceville. Many of these labels would go on to achieve successes in other genres of metal throughout the 1990s.\n\nIn September 1990, Death's manager Eric Greif held one of the first North American death metal festivals, Day of Death, in Milwaukee suburb Waukesha, Wisconsin, and featured 26 bands including Autopsy, Broken Hope, Hellwitch, Obliveon, Revenant, Viogression, Immolation, Atheist, and Cynic.[42]\n\nLater history[]\n\nDeath metal's popularity achieved its initial peak between the 1992–93 era, with some bands such as Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Obituary enjoying mild commercial success. However, the genre as a whole never broke into the mainstream. The genre's mounting popularity may have been partly responsible for a strong rivalry between Norwegian black metal and Swedish death metal scenes. Fenriz of Darkthrone has noted that Norwegian black metal musicians were \"fed up with the whole death metal scene\" at the time.[43] Death metal diversified in the 1990s, spawning a rich variety of subgenres which still have a large \"underground\" following at the present.\n\nCharacteristics[]\n\nInstrumentation[]\n\nThe setup most frequently used within the death metal genre is two guitarists, a bass player, a vocalist and a drummer often using \"hyper double-bass blast beats\".[44][45] Although this is the standard setup, bands have been known to occasionally incorporate other instruments such as electronic keyboards.[46]\n\nThe genre is often identified by fast, highly distorted and down tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking by the very intense sound of biker metal and thrash metal. The percussion is usually aggressive and powerful\n\nDeath metal is known for its growled vocals and for abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes. Death metal may include chromatic chord progressions and a varied song structure. In some circumstances, the style will incorporate melodic riffs and harmonies for effect. This incorporation of melody and harmonious playing was even further used in the creation of melodic death metal. These compositions tend to emphasize an ongoing development of themes and motifs.\n\nVocals and lyrics[]\n\nDeath metal vocals are referred to as death growls; hoarse roars/snarls. Death growling is mistakenly thought to be a form of screaming using the lowest vocal register known as vocal fry, however vocal fry is actually a form of overtone screaming, and while growling can be performed this way by experienced vocalists who use the fry screaming technique, \"true\" death growling is in fact created by an altogether different technique.[47]Template:Specify The three major methods of harsh vocalization used in the genre are often mistaken for each other, encompassing vocal fry screaming, false chord screaming, and \"true\" death growls.[48]Template:Full Growling is sometimes also referred to as Cookie Monster vocals, tongue-in-cheek, due to the vocal similarity to the voice of the popular Sesame Street character of the same name.[49] Although often criticized, death growls serve the aesthetic purpose of matching death metal's aggressive lyrical content.[50] High-pitched screaming is occasionally utilized in death metal, being heard in songs by Death, Exhumed, Dying Fetus, Cannibal Corpse, and Deicide.\n\nThe lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence,[51] but may also extend to topics like Satanism, religion, occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, philosophy, science fiction, and politics.[52][53] Although violence may be explored in various other genres as well, death metal may elaborate on the details of extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. Sociologist Keith Kahn-Harris commented this apparent glamorization of violence may be attributed to a \"fascination\" with the human body that all people share to some degree, a fascination which mixes desire and disgust.[54] Heavy metal author Gavin Baddeley also stated there does seem to be a connection between \"how acquainted one is with their own mortality\" and \"how much they crave images of death and violence\" via the media.[55] Additionally, contributing artists to the genre often defend death metal as little more than an extreme form of art and entertainment, similar to horror films in the motion picture industry.[3] This explanation has brought such musicians under fire from activists internationally, who claim that this is often lost on a large number of adolescents, who are left with the glamorization of such violence without social context or awareness of why such imagery is stimulating.[3]\n\nAccording to Alex Webster, bassist of Cannibal Corpse, \"The gory lyrics are probably not, as much as people say, [what's keeping us] from being mainstream. Like, 'death metal would never go into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?' I think it's really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream.\"[56]\n\nOrigin of the term[]\n\nThe most popular theory of the subgenre's christening is Possessed's 1984 demo, Death Metal; the song from the eponymous demo would also be featured on the band's 1985 debut album, Seven Churches.[57] Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school English class assignment.[58] Another possible origin is a fanzine called Death Metal, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation Death Metal released by Noise Records.[59][60] The term might also have originated from other recordings. A demo released by Death in 1984 is called Death by Metal.[61]\n\nSubgenres[]\n\nIt should be noted that cited examples are not necessarily exclusive to one particular style. Many bands can easily be placed in two or more of the following categories, and a band's specific categorization is often a source of contention due to personal opinion and interpretation.\n\nMelodic death metal: Scandinavian death metal could be considered the forerunner of \"melodic death metal\". Melodic death metal, sometimes referred to as \"melodeath\", is traditional heavy metal mixed with some death metal elements. Unlike most other death metal, melodeath usually features screams instead of growls, slower tempos, much more melody and even clean vocals are heard at rare times. Carcass is sometimes credited with releasing the first melodic death metal album with 1993's Heartwork, although Swedish bands In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and At the Gates are usually mentioned as the main pioneers of the genre and of the Gothenburg metal sound.\n\nTechnical death metal: Technical death metal and \"progressive death metal\" are related terms that refer to bands distinguished by the complexity of their music. Common traits are dynamic song structures, uncommon time signatures, atypical rhythms and unusual harmonies and melodies. Bands described as technical death metal or progressive death metal usually fuse common death metal aesthetics with elements of progressive rock, jazz or classical music. While the term technical death metal is sometimes used to describe bands that focus on speed and extremity as well as complexity, the line between progressive and technical death metal is thin. \"Tech death\" and \"prog death\", for short, are terms commonly applied to such bands as Nile, Edge of Sanity, and Opeth. Necrophagist and Spawn of Possession are known for a classical music-influenced death metal style. Death metal pioneers Death also refined their style in a more progressive direction in their final years. The Polish band Decapitated gained recognition as one of Europe's primary modern technical death metal acts.[62][63]\n\nDeath/doom: Death/doom is a style that combines the slow tempos and melancholic atmosphere of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double-kick drumming of death metal.[64] The style emerged during the late 1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s.[64] It was pioneered by bands such as Autopsy, Winter,[65] Asphyx,[65] Disembowelment,[65] Paradise Lost,[65] and My Dying Bride.[65] This style spawned the more extreme subgenre of funeral doom metal, which is even slower and more atmospheric.\n\nGoregrind, deathgrind and pornogrind[67][68] are styles that mix the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore with the complexity of death metal. They differ from death metal in that guitar solos are often a rarity, shrieked vocals are more prominent as the main vocal style (though death growls are still utilized and some deathgrind bands make more use of the latter vocal style), and songs are generally shorter in length, usually between one and three minutes that keep with grindcore's tradition of short time lengths in songs. All three of these styles differs from grindcore in the more technical approach and less evident hardcore punk influence and aesthetics. Some notable examples of deathgrind are Brujeria, Cattle Decapitation,[69] Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer,[70] Circle of Dead Children, Rotten Sound, GUT[71] and Cock and Ball Torture.[72][73]\n\nDeathcore: With the rise in popularity of metalcore, some of its traits have been incorporated into death metal. Bands such as Suicide Silence, Carnifex and Salt the Wound combine death metal with a variance of metalcore influence.[74][75] Characteristics of death metal, such as fast drumming (including blast beats), down-tuned guitars,tremolo picking and growled vocals, are combined with the screamed vocals, melodic riffs and breakdowns of metalcore.[76] Decibel magazine stated that \"One of Suffocation's trademarks, breakdowns, has spawned an entire metal subgenre: deathcore.\"[77]\n\nDeath 'n' roll: is a style that combines death metal's growled vocals and highly distorted detuned guitar riffs along with elements of classic rock and roll and 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.[78][79] Notable examples include Entombed,[78] Gorefest[79] and Six Feet Under .\n\nBlackened death metal: is a style that combines death metal and black metal.[80][81] Examples of blackened death metal bands are Belphegor,[82] Behemoth,[83] Akercocke,[84] and Sacramentum.[85]\n\nBrutal death metal: is a style developed by combining certain aspects of the song structures of grindcore / goregrind with death metal but it should not be confused with deathgrind (grindcore that is very close in form to, and maintains the complexity of, death metal) because it has nothing to do with hardcore punk. The bands in this genre are often categorized as technical death metal, and as of now there is a sizable overlap between the two genres, with the boundary in many cases being negligible. Brutal death metal is associated with bands like Deeds of Flesh, Disgorge, Nile, Sect of Execration, Sarcolytic, Benighted Images of Violence, Aborted, Disinterment and Suffocation. The death grunts are very low-pitched and the lyrics are often, but not always gore related. In addition, the guitar riffs are usually slow chunky grooves or hyper fast and down-tuned, often with pinched harmonics. Typically, if guitar solos are played, they usually make large use of tremolo picking, varied arpeggios, and wailing harmonics. The drumlines are usually highly varied in style, ranging from slow rhythms to churning blast beats.\n\nSlam death metal is similar to standard brutal death metal, slam death metal differs in the focus shifting away from speed and blast beats and more toward groovy \"slamming\" mid - paced riffs although blast beats are used sporadically. Vocals, generally, register no higher than the standard death growl and are usually much lower, often with a \"gurgle\"-type sound. Guitar tuning is usually dropped B or lower with frequent pinch harmonics and the prevalence of guitar solos many times sacrificed in favor of crunching riffs. Technicality is often used but is not mandatory, while melody, if present at all, is kept to an absolute minimum. Regionally, slam death metal has been predominately associated with the United States, and more specifically, New York and Texas. However, recently, the genre has spread world-wide. Slam death is considered a style of brutal death metal, meaning that it shares many characteristics with the former. This means that every slam band is brutal, but not all brutal bands are slam. Bands usually associated with slam death metal are Devourment, Ingested, Abominable Putridity and Cephalotripsy\n\nOther fusions and subgenres[]\n\nThere are other heavy metal music subgenres that have come from fusions between death metal and other non-metal genres, such as the fusion of death metal and jazz. Atheist and Cynic are two examples; the former went so far as to include jazz-style drum solos on albums, while the latter incorporated elements of jazz fusion. Nile have also incorporated with Egyptian music and Middle Eastern themes into their work, while Alchemist have incorporated psychedelia along with Aboriginal music. Some groups, such as Nightfall, Septic Flesh, Fleshgod Apocalypse, and Eternal Tears of Sorrow, have incorporated keyboards and symphonic elements, creating a fusion of symphonic metal and death metal, sometimes referred to as symphonic death metal.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of death metal bands\n\nDeath growl\n\nBlast beat\n\nExtreme metal\n\nHagane\n\nReferences[]\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nChriste, Ian.
