        "text": "\"The Senior\" features notable actors\n\nThe comeback story of former Sul Ross State University football player Mike Flynt is getting closer to making a debut on the silver screen.\n\nFlynt made history by becoming the oldest person to play NCAA college football when he returned to the gridiron at the age of 59 to complete his last year of eligibility.\n\nBack in 1971, Flynt, a junior, was coming off a stellar season as the Lobo team captain and tackles leader, giving him All-Conference honors, when a fist fight with a teammate led to him getting kicked off the team at the start of his senior season.\n\nIn 2007, Flynt came back to finish his career at Sul Ross State.\n\nDirected by Rod Lurie and produced by Mark Ciardi, \"The Senior\" is set to be released sometime in late November.\n\n\"It's been a blessing beyond words,\" Flynt said. \"It was surreal to see the things that we had lived out being portrayed by these actors that were very professional.\"\n\nLurie notably directed the 2001 film \"The Last Castle\" along with the 2007 sports drama \"Resurrecting the Champ.\"\n\nCiardi has been known for his work in many prominent sports movies such as \"The Rookie,\" \"McFarland, USA,\" \"Invincible,\" \"Miracle,\" and \"Million Dollar Arm.\"\n\nThe film, which is based off a biography by Don Yaeger and Flynt, also called \"The Senior,\" includes several notable actors.\n\nMichael Chiklis was cast to play the lead role as Flynt. He is best known for his role in the FX television series \"The Shield.\"\n\nMary Stuart Masterson, who is famous for her role in the 80's classic \"Some Kind of Wonderful,\" was cast to play Flynt's wife, Eileen.\n\nRob Corddry, a former correspondent on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,\" is also set to star in the film.\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Fort Worth this past fall. The film is currently nearing post production.\n\n\"I never dreamed that anybody would be interested in an old guy going back to play his senior year of college football,\" added Flynt.\n\nFlynt still shows a lot of pride in his alma mater.\n\nHe and fellow alumni are returning to Alpine for homecoming festivities in late October to be present for the dedication of the fieldhouse to the late, great Sul Ross booster Randy Jackson.\n\nThe film is more than just a story about Flynt â€“ it is also a chance for SRSU and the community of Alpine to be showcased for the nation.\n\n\"I think it's going to be fantastic for my school, the alumni that participated. It's going to reenergize their love for our school. I'm excited about that,\" said Flynt."
