        "text": "In the tradition of such films as All the President’s Men, The Candidate and The Parallax View, The Contender is a political thriller that takes us behind the scenes of political power plays.\n\nWhen the sitting Vice President dies, Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) is chosen by the President (Jeff Bridges) to be the first woman to hold the office. The selection meets with opposition from members of both parties, in particular a powerful political adversary (Gary Oldman) who will seemingly stop at nothing to discredit her. The confirmation hearings set off a firestorm of controversy as shocking secrets from Hanson’s past are revealed, threatening her personal life as well as her political future.\n\nLaine Hanson has what it takes to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Now she must prove she has the stomach for what it takes to get the job.\n\nThe DreamWorks Pictures film stars Gary Oldman, Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges, Christian Slater, William Petersen, Philip Baker Hall, Saul Rubinek and Sam Elliott. Rod Lurie wrote and directed the film, which is produced by Marc Frydman, Douglas Urbanski, Willi Baer and James Spies. Dr. Rainer Bienger, Gary Oldman and Maurice Leblond are the executive producers, with Scott Shiffman and Steve Loglisci serving as co-producers.\n\nLincoln\n\nSteven Spielberg directed this inspiring and revealing drama which focuses on the 16th President's tumultuous final four months in office as this visionary leader pursues a course of action to end the Civil War, unite the country and abolish slavery.\n\nView\n\nAll the Way\n\nBryan Cranston stars as President Lyndon B. Johnson in his first tumultuous year in office in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination, the escalation of the Vietnam War and the launch of his landmark Civil Rights bill.\n\nView\n\nThe Post\n\nKatherine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, and hard-nosed editor Ben Bradlee join forces to expose a decades-long government coverup. But the two must risk their careers—and their freedom—to bring truth to light in this powerful film directed by Steven Spielberg.\n\nView"
