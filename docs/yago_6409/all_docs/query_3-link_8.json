        "text": "Nothing But the Truth director Rod Lurie (The Contender)\n\ntook a circuitous route to Hollywood — he was an army officer and an\n\nentertainment reporter before perching himself in the director’s chair. He’s\n\nalso an engaging conversationalist, full of insight on the key issues of the\n\nday, especially where the worlds of film, politics, and journalism collide.\n\nIn Lurie’s latest film, Nothing But the Truth, Rachel Armstrong (Kate\n\nBeckinsale), a reporter for a fictional Washington newspaper, is jailed after\n\nrevealing the identity of Erica Van Doren (Vera Farmiga), a CIA agent who’s\n\nmarried to a government official critical of a U.S. attack on Venezuela.\n\nArmstrong’s imprisonment takes a toll on her family life, while Van Doren and\n\nspecial prosecutor Patton Dubois (Matt Dillon) try to find the source of the\n\nleak. The film has a number of parallels to the real-life cases of Judith Miller\n\nand Valerie Plame, although Lurie says he was not trying to make a fictionalized\n\naccount of their stories. Rather, he wanted to make a thriller that examined the\n\npersonal toll on these two women.\n\nIn an interview with RT, Lurie not only waxed poetic on his favorite movies, he\n\nalso discussed his approach to melding fact and fiction, and bemoaned the\n\ncurrent state of the mass media.\n\nNext: Rod Lurie talks about mass media, film distribution, and the politics\n\nof awards season.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=5&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nIt’s really interesting that you started off this whole thing with a\n\ndiscussion of All the President’s Men, because that harkens back to a\n\ntime when the general public thought of journalists as heroes, after Watergate.\n\nIn the current climate in which Nothing But the Truth finds itself, not\n\nonly are newspapers folding left and right, but there’s a general distrust of\n\nthe mainstream media?\n\nRod Lurie: I think there is a good reason for that. As\n\ncorporations started buying up newspapers and magazines and television stations,\n\nthe need for profit overwhelmed every other aspect of that business, which was\n\nnot the case years ago. The networks looked at news divisions as loss leaders,\n\nand they felt, “Really, no problem, as long as we got it right and we did well.”\n\nBut the need for profit has forced all of these organizations to get the widest\n\npossible audience that they can, and one of the ways to do it is to become\n\npartisan, to know that you’re gonna get all the Republicans to watch Fox, and\n\nthe vast majority of liberals are gonna watch MSNBC. As a result, this\n\npartisanship has created a bias in the news. That bias, then angers a gigantic\n\nsection of the population. It never was that Walter Cronkite had people who\n\nhated what he stood for. At the same time he was on, people didn’t hate John\n\nChancellor, or Harry Reasoner, or Howard K. Smith. But now, people really have\n\nanimus toward Sean Hannity on the right, or Chris Matthews, say, on the left.\n\nThey’re calling themselves journalists, and that’s not really what they are.\n\nThey’re just more politically–oriented Andy Rooneys. The bias has found its way\n\ninto the reporting of news.\n\nI’ll tell you what: I’m a lefty, so let me take away my own bias and attack\n\nthe New York Times for a second. If you look like something like that\n\nstory about McCain having a mistress, or maybe she wasn’t a mistress, or they\n\nweren’t sure what she was but they had to report somethingâ€¦In the old days, this\n\narticle never would have been published, because there wasn’t enough information\n\nto report what they said were the facts. In today’s world, in order to feed\n\ntheir liberal readership, they plastered it on the front page.\n\nIn Nothing But the Truth, there are a lot of parallels to\n\nthe cases of Judith Miller and Valerie Plame, but you twisted it a bit. When you\n\nheard those stories, what did you want to leave in, and what did you want to\n\ntake out when making this film?\n\nRL: Whenever you make a movie, when it’s done, as a\n\nfilmmaker, you never sit there and say, “Boy, I really got that right.” It’s, “Where did I screw up?” I’ve not confessed to anyone yet, but I really feel,\n\nafter having read a lot of reviews of the film — which have been overwhelmingly\n\npositive — but those negative ones, every one of them make objection to the\n\nfact that we have quote-unquote “gotten wrong” the Judith Miller sorry, or that\n\nwe have romanticized Judith Miller in some way, who by most people’s accounts is\n\nnot a glamorous figure. I never intended for this to be a roman a clef\n\nof Judy Miller versus Valerie Plame. What I wanted to do was to take their\n\nsituation and put completely different characters in it, and see how different\n\nhuman beings would behave in their situation. Of course, the story goes wildly\n\noff the Plame story. But I dug myself a bit of a hole having enough parallels\n\nthat some of the lazier critics or some of the critics who have a political bias\n\ncould use that against the film. It probably would have been wise of me not to\n\nmake it a CIA agent. I could have made it some other sort of national security\n\n[employee]. Maybe I shouldn’t have made her the wife of an ambassador. Most\n\npeople seem to seem to think it’s a high quality film, particularly for its\n\nperformances, [but] they’ve been sidetracked by [the facts versus the fictions].\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=2&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nWith this film and The Contender, are you attempting to\n\nprovide a civics lesson — for lack of a better term — within the framework of\n\na thriller?\n\nRL: The answer to that is not just no, but unequivocally no.\n\nI don’t think I’m equipped enough to be giving anyone a civics lesson, or any\n\nkind of message. What I’m trying to do with both The Contender and Nothing\n\nBut the Truth is to try to find entertaining stories that could come out of\n\n“what-if” situations with regard to things that really happen in the world. For\n\nexample, in The Contender, a lot of people thought it was influenced by\n\nthe Monica Lewinsky scandal. In fact, it was influenced by me watching the\n\nClarence Thomas hearings and thinking, “Could you imagine if this person was a\n\nwoman, and this woman had to answer all these sexual questions, and how un f—-ing\n\ncomfortable that would be?” It would be outrageous. And I thought, “That’s a\n\ngood movie!”\n\nIn the case of Nothing But the Truth, its real genesis was I was\n\ngonna do an episode on a smaller lever of this for Commander in Chief.\n\nBut I was fired, and Steven Bochco came in and killed it. So I really wanted to\n\ndo a story of a journalist in jail for protecting their source. When Miller and\n\nPlame happened, I didn’t really follow their case, but I really wondered what\n\nwould happen if these were both moms, and their kids went to school together and\n\nthey had some sort of connective tissue between them. Once I started thinking\n\nabout that, the dominoes started falling into place. In fact, I wrote the ending\n\nfirst. I felt it was a very a very cool and interesting idea to put the lead\n\ncharacter into an impossible situation.\n\nAs someone who came out of the world of journalism, what do you think\n\nthe future holds for newspapers?\n\nRL: I think with the print newspaper business, it is\n\nempirically obvious that it’s going the way of a disaster. I’ve noticed Rolling\n\nStone has literally shrunk from its classic large size. The New York\n\nTimes has also physically shrunk, and there are layoffs left and right.\n\nIt’s really a shame to me, because in 30 years my grandchildren probably won’t\n\nknow what a newspaper is. It’s rather stunning, and not good for the\n\ndissemination of news, because there seems to be a less thoughtful and\n\ncalculated amount of research and investigation done by purely internet-run\n\npublications.\n\nNow, I love the internet. I’m on it all f—ing day long. I do read my print\n\nnewspaper in the morning, but all day long, I’m on the Internet. I love the\n\naccess to information, I like to be able to find anything I want, but there are\n\na couple things you don’t find that you’d be able to find in a print newspaper.\n\nA newspaper will run a lead story that will go 2,500 to 3,000 words filled with\n\ninformation. Being able to physically hold the newspaper and read it over a cup\n\nof coffee at a diner lends itself to that. Stories of that length just don’t\n\nappear on the internet almost ever. It’s kind of a shame; I wish both worlds\n\ncould coincide, but the internet has put a dagger in the heart of newspapers in\n\nmany ways.\n\nThe Contender came out at the tail end of the Clinton\n\nadministration, and Nothing But the Truth is being released at the end\n\nof the Bush administration. Are you optimistic about the current state of\n\naffairs?\n\nRL: It seems to me that even the people on the\n\nright seem to be watching Obama perform in the transition, and they’re putting\n\ntheir fingers on their chin and they’re saying, “You know, let’s give this guy a\n\nchance. Maybe there is something here after all.” I think there is a tremendous\n\namount of hopefulness. Now, I say this at the exact moment when the company\n\nthat’s releasing Nothing But the Truth, [Yari Film Group], last Friday\n\nwent into chapter 11 bankruptcy. And I’m seeing my own film, as far as the\n\nimmediate distribution beyond this qualifying run get obliterated. And I’m\n\nseeing almost everyone at the Yari Film Group being fired, and these are people\n\nI really like. And it’s all part of the economy that George Bush sank us into.\n\nI’m hoping the confidence that the economy that the world seems to have for Obama is going to help our economy. Too late for my film, but people are having\n\nfar worse problems.\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nRL: Well, if I tell you, it’s gonna open up a line of\n\nquestioning that’s gonna take foreverâ€¦. I’m remaking Straw Dogs.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1202524&MapTypeID=2&photo=4&legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nWhat’s the new take, given that a lot of what Sam Peckinpah was doing\n\nin that film is very much of its time?\n\nRL: It was very much of its time, because it was about a\n\nliberal anti-Vietnam guy who goes into an Irish town where he discovers he’s\n\ncapable of as much brutality and violence as those who he’d had objection to. I\n\ncertainly admire Peckinpah’s movie, but anyone who watches it objectively — and\n\ncertainly if they take the mythology about Peckinpah out of it — would find it\n\nto be a film that’s more notorious than it is great.\n\nWhen you’re making a film, do you ever think of awards recognition?\n\nRL: I’ll be honest with you: the answer is yes, for Kate Beckinsale, and Vera Farmiga and Alan Alda in particular. I think the movie’s\n\nimpeccably acted. And in fact, both of them {Beckinsale and Farmiga] are both in\n\nthe mix; the both got nominated for the Critic’s Choice Awards. Here’s the\n\nthing: the awards at the end of the year are absolutely driven by the ability to\n\nfinance a very aggressive marketing campaign. In today’s New York Times,\n\nthe ad for Revolutionary Road runs six full pages. That must be\n\n$500,000 to $750,000 ad in just the New York Times. The truth is the\n\nYari Film Group couldn’t get anyone to see the film. What can you do when you’re\n\na tiny distributor with a high level film, and you’re sending out screeners, and\n\n[a critic] gets a screener for Nothing But the Truth, but at the same\n\ntime you’re getting Benjamin Button and Doubt and Revolutionary\n\nRoad and Slumdog Millionaire. These movies just have major\n\nfinancial clout behind them. I contacted about a third of the Broadcast film\n\ncritics just to make sure they were looking at the film, and almost everyone I\n\nspoke to said they had the screener but they hadn’t gotten around to it, which\n\nmeant they weren’t gonna see it before they voted. And I asked them just to look\n\nat the film, and they looked at the film and voted for the women. I feel that if\n\nwe had a little more marketing power, we would have been more successful,\n\nbecause I really do believe, as many of the critics pointed out, that Kate and\n\nVera are absolutely on fire in this film."
