        "text": "My brief reaction to Ron Lurie’s Oscar-nominated political drama. And the catch? I’m only allowed one word per minute of film. Nothing more.\n\nDirected by: Rod Lurie\n\nStarring: Joan Allen, Gary Oldman, Jeff Bridges, Sam Elliot, Christian Slater\n\nRun Time: 126 min.\n\nIMDb Plot: Senator Laine Hanson is a contender for U.S. Vice President, but information and disinformation about her past surfaces that threatens to derail her confirmation.\n\nReview:\n\nIs a Contender rewatch hurt by its third act ‘twist’? (Spoilers, obviously.)\n\nOn its first watch, Contender is about dignity in the face of slut shaming. You fume as Hanson’s integrity is crucified over past, private trysts. However, once Hanson reveals that the voyeur wasn’t her, revisiting Contender just feels like watching Joan Allen drag out Celebrity Poker with a flush. (I get that Contender is about ‘test of character’ but The Crucible this ain’t.)\n\nAllen’s character work is top-notch. But, for a lead, she lacks major agency as her scenes are largely reduced to, either, giving speeches or getting scolded. What’s more: Her ‘victory’ is only achieved via other men’s actions. She can’t even spike her own football. Which is probably, partially, Contender’s whole point."
