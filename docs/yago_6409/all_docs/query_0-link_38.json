        "text": "Rod Lurie on \"The Contender\"\n\n(CNN) -- Rod Lurie, formerly a film critic for Los Angeles radio station KABC debuted as a director/screenwriter with his film, \"Deterrence.\" He then wrote \"The Contender,\" due out this month, which is already expected to receive an Oscar nomination. DreamWorks Pictures picked up \"The Contender,\" which marked the first time they'd picked up a film that had already been produced.\n\nChat Moderator: Thank you for joining us today, Rod Lurie, and welcome.\n\nRod Lurie: How's everyone doing?\n\nChat Moderator: Can you tell us a little about your film, \"The Contender.\"\n\nRod Lurie: \"The Contender\" is a sexual thriller set in Washington, D.C., about a female vice presidential candidate who is destroyed, bit-by-bit, by having her sexual past revealed by her opponents.\n\nQuestion from Susie-CNN: Was this movie planned to be released around election time?\n\nRod Lurie: The movie is going to be released this Friday, so I want everyone to go see it, and then tell three of your friends to go see it. In other words, pay forward.\n\nChat Moderator: Where did you get the inspiration for the story line?\n\nRod Lurie: The inspiration for the story line was the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1992, but really what I wanted to do was write a screenplay that my favorite actress, Joan Allen, could not say no to.\n\nQuestion from SE: Hi, Rod. Why the choice of Joan Allen to play the role?\n\nRod Lurie: I think that Joan Allen is like a female Gregory Peck. She is so dignified and attractive that you just wish that people like her were leading the country.\n\nChat Moderator: Joan Allen has never carried a movie. What made you think she could carry this off?\n\nRod Lurie: I think it's a sin that she has never been given the opportunity to carry a film. Every scene she has ever been in in one of her films completely belongs to her, so why not give her the opportunity to do it all the way through a film?\n\nChat Moderator: You were a reporter and a critic before becoming a director. What made you want to change from reporter to reportee, and have you ever thought of going back?\n\nRod Lurie: I had a lot of fun as a film critic, but I never thought I was a particularly astute one until I decided to change professions and see if I could be better at something else. I don't know if I will return to that arena. I think I would be a much wiser critic after having made this film.\n\nQuestion from SiskelEbert: Is the timing of the movie release intentional -- close to the elections?\n\nRod Lurie: I made this film independently and had no idea that a studio would pick it up. It was never our intention to release it right now, but we really had no date picked out. We were just hoping it would be released.\n\nChat Moderator: What fascinates you about the politics?\n\nRod Lurie: I think that politics is as exciting as a football game, a boxing match, a domestic squabble or a war. Politics is the search for power. What could be more violent than that?\n\nChat Moderator: Why did you want to back away from the trend of political satire that we have seen recently in movies such as \"Bullworth\" and \"Bob Roberts\"?\n\nRod Lurie: That's a fantastic question. The reason is that they exist. I wanted to go into a world that wasn't currently being explored. I don't know that I could make a movie that is better than \"Wag the Dog,\" or better than \"Bullworth.\"\n\nQuestion from Akira: Who was the [cinematographer]? I saw a screening, and it was beautifully shot. It reminded me of Dante Spinotti's work in \"The Insider.\"\n\nRod Lurie: The film was shot by Dennis Maloney. Dennis is a terrific cinematographer who has a real documentary style that I love.\n\nQuestion from Krollman: Do you think political drama in cinema has taken its tone from current political parties?\n\nRod Lurie: I think that there is very little current political drama on film, so I can only speak for our movie. I think it very much takes its tone from the current Washington status quo.\n\nChat Moderator: Do you have any funny stories from the set to share with us?\n\nRod Lurie: Gary Oldman showed up on the set, and he looked so different from what he looks like that he was almost thrown off the set. In fact, I almost threw him off the set, because I thought he was a nutcase pretending to be Gary Oldman. That's how effective his look in the film is.\n\nQuestion from Akira: How was it, working with Gary Oldman?\n\nRod Lurie: Gary is the most professional man I know, in terms of bringing a fully developed character to the set. He'll nail everything in the first take, and then proceed on every subsequent take to show you just how much more brilliant he can be.\n\nQuestion from GodfreyPark: Who are some actors you look forward to working with?\n\nRod Lurie: There are many. I am particularly interested in working with actresses Julianne Moore and Diana Lane. I would love to work with Ed Norton, Paul Newman and Morgan Freeman. Those are just names that are sort of bouncing off my head right now.\n\nChat Moderator: Are there any projects you are working on currently?\n\nRod Lurie: We have several films to choose from. One thing I will be doing is a pilot for DreamWorks Television and CBS.\n\nChat Moderator: What was your favorite part about working on this film?\n\nRod Lurie: As a writer, I was really thrilled to hear my words spoken by these masterful actors. There is nothing that can give a writer a greater high.\n\nQuestion from Krollman: How do you compare this movie with \"Deterrence,\" in terms of personal experience?\n\nRod Lurie: Well, \"Deterrence\" was a tiny movie, shot in 18 days. \"The Contender\" was slightly larger, but I really learned that what money buys you is this: It buys you time. Time is a crucial element on any set.\n\nQuestion from Akira: Any advice for an aspiring screenwriter?\n\nRod Lurie: It's going to sound corny, but never, never, never give up. I wrote many screenplays before my first one was picked up. In my experience, almost everybody I know who really hung tough got his or her shot. In fact, I am producing a movie right now that stars Jeff Bridges and is being directed by a man who has spent the past five or six years trying to get his screenplays into a movie.\n\nMESSAGE BOARD\n\nMovie reviews\n\nQuestion from Scohn: Did you worry about offending those in the political inner circle? Are these characters closely based on real politicians?\n\nRod Lurie: They're all fictional characters, and their behavior is based on nobody. We did get a phone call from Arlen Specter's office, wanting to make sure that he was not the model for Gary Oldman's character.\n\nQuestion from Krollman: I understand you wrote Joan Allen's part with her specifically in your mind. How did you convince her about the part?\n\nRod Lurie: Joan knew about me from my days as a film critic and assured me that, at the very least, she would read a screenplay if I wrote it for her. The part, I suppose, spoke for itself. She also requested to see \"Deterrence\" before she signed on board.\n\nQuestion from Akira: Did you find it difficult to get anyone to give you your first shot directing your own material?\n\nRod Lurie: I think the only way to get a first shot at directing these days is if you write the material and somebody really, really wants to make it. You tell them, \"You've got it... you just have to let me direct.\"\n\nQuestion from Scohn: This cast contains so many great actors. Can you describe something that stood out about someone's acting process, or how they prepared for the roles?\n\nRod Lurie: I think that all the actors approached roles differently. Jeff Bridges researches like crazy. He studied speeches of Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and Mario Cuomo.\n\nChristian Slater was the person I was worried about, because I had heard so many stories about him from past films. However, his sobriety has created a professional to the nth degree, and a very kind man.\n\nStatement from Guest39556: But I heard you say on \"Charlie Rose\" the other day that Gary Oldman's character was partly based on Henry Hyde.\n\nRod Lurie: That is correct, but I was referring to his speech mannerisms. The behavior of the character is unique.\n\nQuestion from Akira: What new directors are you keeping an eye on these days?\n\nRod Lurie: I just saw \"Girl Fight,\" and I find that to be one of the most wonderfully directed films by a first-timer that I have ever seen. I recommend you see it the day AFTER you see \"The Contender.\"\n\nQuestion from PulpFiction: Rod, what's your favorite movie?\n\nRod Lurie: \"All the President's Men,\" followed by \"Paths of Glory.\"\n\nQuestion from Scohn: What directors do you admire, stylistically?\n\nRod Lurie: I admire very much Alan Akula, Stanley Kubrik, and I'm becoming very fond of Steven Soderberg.\n\nQuestion from Josh: What was the moment in the film -- the process -- that you knew, \"hey this is going to work. This is going to be a good movie\"?\n\nRod Lurie: I never had a moment like that. A director is always sure he is screwing everything up. The one thing that I knew was that my actors would, in the end, save the day. Their performances are impeccable.\n\nQuestion from Akira: Is it difficult, this being your second film, to \"direct\" such talent without their \"celebrity\" getting in the way?\n\nRod Lurie: Their celebrity never got in the way, except when we were hounded by autograph-seekers in restaurants.\n\nQuestion from RandMC: Hello, Mr. Lurie. Do you think there will be a female vice president or president of the United States?\n\nRod Lurie: Yes. There are, right now, nine really qualified female senators, and my guess is that in 2004, one of them will be seriously considered for the vice presidency, if not the presidency.\n\nChat Moderator: Do you have any final thoughts to share with us?\n\nRod Lurie: Im looking forward to the opening of the film. I hope that each and every one of you sees it and take everyone in [your] neighborhood with [you].\n\nChat Moderator: Thank you for joining us today.\n\nRod Lurie: Goodbye, everybody, and thank you very much for your time and your great questions.\n\nRod Lurie joined the chat via telephone from New York. CNN provided a typist or him. The above is an edited transcript of that chat, which took place on Wednesday, October 11, 2000.\n\nCNN COMMUNITY:\n\nCheck out the CNN Chat calendar\n\nPost your opinion on our message boards\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nCNN.com/SHOWBIZ\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
