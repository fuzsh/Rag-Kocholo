More recently, I watched The Contender. The multi-talented Oldman also produced the film.\n\nOldman’s character, this time, is the polar opposite of Smiley. Congressman Shelley Runyon, is malevolently and unappetizingly evil. Even the way he eats bloody steaks (and talks with his mouth full) is disgusting."
