        "text": "Election day is upon us, so a balls-out movie unafraid to pitch a few high hard ones at political hypocrisy should be just the ticket. Rod Lurie, the former film critic for KABC radio in Los Angeles, who wrote and directed this rouser, really wants The Contender to be that movie. He pumps honest energy into it, and enough potent performances to stuff the Oscar ballot box. What a shame that Lurie, a 1984 West Point grad and the son of political cartoonist Ronan Lurie, backs off nearly every provocative issue he raises. But until The Contender slips into partisan politics and platitudinous piety, it’s a lively, entertaining ride.\n\nThe eye of the storm is Sen. Laine Hanson, played with fiery verve by Joan Allen. Forget all those prim, repressed housewives Allen embodied to perfection in Nixon, The Crucible, Pleasantville, Face/Off and The Ice Storm. The Contender gives this perennial supporting actress her first shot at a leading role, and she delivers a bust-out star performance. Laine is a take-charge lady. She defied her governor daddy (the great Philip Baker Hall) by switching parties to win a Democratic seat in the Senate. She even voted to impeach Clinton (“He was not guilty but responsible”), even though her husband, William (Robin Thomas), the father of her son, was once happily married to her best friend, Cynthia (Mariel Hemingway).\n\nAnd yet departing President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), faced with the death of the vice president, has nominated this woman to be his VP. It’s not just the Republican opposition, led by Congressman Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), that’s up in arms; chief of staff Kermit Newman (Sam Elliott) and communications director Jerry Toliver (Saul Rubinek) also have qualms. Those qualms turn to quakes when Shelly claims that Laine fucked and sucked her way through a frat-house sex party during her college days. Says one alleged witness: “There was come all over her face.”\n\nYou don’t see this stuff on The West Wing. Lurie misses no lurid touch to out-sleaze Monicagate. Laine will neither confirm nor deny the charges, refusing to submit to what she calls “sexual McCarthyism.” Will the president stand behind a sex-crazed homewrecker? To call the outcome contrived would be putting it mildly. The fun comes from watching the actors rip into their roles.\n\nTrending\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nOldman, also the film’s executive producer, rips the most. This British dynamo, whose talent is as outsize as his best-known roles (Sid Vicious, Lee Harvey Oswald, Dracula), is barely recognizable as a senior Midwestern pol with a receding hairline. But he’s still a force of nature, making Shelly a demonic amalgam of Arlen Specter, Henry Hyde and Ken Starr. Just watch him try to corrupt the ideals of congressional freshman Reginald Webster (Christian Slater). But Oldman also gives the devil his due. Handed the caricatured role of a villain, he digs deep to show the human side of a man who has let revenge compromise his values and undercut his marriage to Maggie (a pained, powerful Irene Ziegler)."
