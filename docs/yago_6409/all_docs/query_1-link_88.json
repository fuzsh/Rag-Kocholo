        "text": "Politics is a dirty business and lacking heroes, so when Jack Hathaway (William Peterson) risks his life in an attempt to save a drowning girl he would seem the obvious choice for the vacant post of Vice-President to President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges).\n\nBut the Prez is determined that his legacy will be to leave a woman in high office, so he goes against the grain of public opinion and nominates Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) for the post. Enter Hathaway supporter Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman), as that most dangerous of men, Someone Who Understands The Need For a Greater Good.\n\nDetermined to have his man as VP, he chairs a committee with the sole aim of destroying Laine Hanson. (\"The public will believe me. And you know why? Because I'll have a big microphone in front of me.\") And it doesn't look too difficult for him, as it seems that Laine has some unfortunate skeletons in her cupboard, most notably a frat-party gang-bang in her college years.\n\nDesperate to salvage the situation, the President's right-hand man (Sam Elliot) attempts to turn the tables on Runyon, only to find mere stock irregularities in his past. (\"Stocks?! That's all you can get me! I want something deviant! Midgets! Boys! Animals!\")\n\nBut are any of the participants in this political game what they seem? And will idealistic young Senator Webster (Christian Slater) have the stomach to assassinate Laine Hanson's character publicly?\n\nThe most intelligent political satire to come along since Bob Roberts, The Contender is by turns fascinating, funny and horrifying. Especially the ever-wonderful Gary Oldman, all self-righteous ire and fury on the committee, while schmoozing and manoeuvering behind the scenes, secure in the belief that He Knows Best.\n\nJeff Bridges also does a wonderful, funny turn as the Reaganesque, food-obsessed President, who may or may not be a darn sight smarter than he pretends.\n\nThe Contender takes a vicious swipe at the moral McCarthyism and humbuggery that has taken over modern politics, and the continuing double-standards applying to men and women in public office. If it abandons its early cynicism for a Capra conclusion, in which Jeff puts on his Jimmy Stewart hat and delivers a barnstorming speech, well I see nothing wrong with this.\n\nAfter all, if George Bush: The Sequel and Tony Blair can't provide us with principled examples of leadership, then I reckon it's only right that Hollywood should.\n\nReviewed on: 11 Apr 2001"
