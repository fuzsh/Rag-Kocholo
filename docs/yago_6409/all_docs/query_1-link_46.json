        "text": "Most recent movies set in Washington DC have been either political comedies of a fairly farcical nature or thrillers involving high-level malfeasance and cover-ups. So it's pleasing to welcome writer-director Rod Lurie's The Contender, a fairly serious movie dealing with the actual process of politics.\n\nHis Vice-President having recently died, Democrat President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges), a confident, manipulative Clinton type (but personally uncompromised and seemingly without a wife), nominates Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as the first female Veep to end his second term with a flourish. He is vociferously opposed by wily right-wing Republican Representative Shelley Runyon (Gary Oldman), chairman of the Congressional committee that will advise and consent in the appointment.\n\nRunyon hates Hanson because she's a political turncoat; his preferred candidate is Governor Hathaway of Virginia (William Peterson), a moderate Southern Democrat. So battle commences with wheeling, dealing, mudslinging and FBI investigations. The biggest threat to the confirmation turns out to be the accusation that as a university student Hanson took part in a sex orgy, a matter on which she refuses to comment, believing her private life irrelevant. In fact, the double standard is alive and well in Washington.\n\nThe movie is entertaining, plausible, and often very funny, with an outstanding performance from Oldman as a seemingly honest, sincere reactionary. But in the final half-hour or so, the film changes character and direction, losing all sense of balance. A skeleton the size of a dinosaur is dragged from the cupboard of a major character; Senator Hanson states her liberal credo before the committee with accompanying emotional music; and the President makes an impassioned Capraesque address to a joint session of Congress that publicly humiliates his chief opponent and is accompanied by triumphalist chords which threaten to modulate into the 'Ode to Joy'.\n\nApart from being dramatically phoney and unconvincing, the film ends up misrepresenting the political process, and concludes with the sanctimonious dedication 'For our Daughters'. The Contender is in every way inferior as a piece of filmmaking and as a guide to life in the Capitol to Otto Preminger's 1962 classic, Advise and Consent, which was also a study of a controversial presidential nomination."
