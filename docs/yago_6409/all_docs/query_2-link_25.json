        "text": "The President of the United States must deal with an international military crisis while confined to a Colorado diner during a freak snowstorm\n\nI got caught up in the global chess game, in the bluffing and the dares, the dangerous strategy of using nuclear blackmail against a fanatic who might call the bluff.\n\nSenator Laine Hanson is a contender for U.S. Vice President, but information and disinformation about her past surfaces that threatens to derail her confirmation.\n\nCritics say this political thriller is solidly made, with top-notch performances, screenplay, and direction for about two third of the film. Unfortunately, the ending almost tank the whole movie.\n\nThe Last Castle is well acted and rousing for the most part, but the story can't stand up to close scrutiny.\n\nUp-and-coming sports reporter rescues a homeless man (\"Champ\") only to discover that he is, in fact, a boxing legend believed to have passed away. What begins as an opportunity to resurrect Champ's story and escape the shadow of his father's success becomes a personal journey as the ambitious reporter reexamines his own life and his relationship with his family.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a reporter faces a possible jail sentence for outing a CIA agent and refusing to reveal her source.\n\nA well-crafted political thriller, Nothing But the Truth features a strong cast that helps the real-life drama make an effortless transition to the big screen."
