        "text": "The filmâ€™s political posturing is frequently simplistic, but the dialogue is exceptional, and the big-name cast delivers.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Apr 2, 2024\n\nThe movie has plenty going for it: a terrific cast led by Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges and Gary Oldman, a captivating story line, a sharp script. Most important, The Contender has timing.\n\nFull Review | Jan 18, 2018\n\nSex, lies and politics--they all boil together beautifully in \"The Contender,\" a strong political drama that understands Washington, knows its dirty secrets, and uses its excellent cast to fine effect.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A- | Oct 18, 2007\n\nPretty much shameless leftist propaganda being sold as conventional Hollywood entertainment, but it manages to satisfy on the traditional genre terms.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Oct 14, 2007\n\nWhen Republicans speak, it's a bitter voice we hear; when Democrats speak, the music swells proudly. There's not must to think about here. It's a personality contest.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: C+ | Dec 6, 2004\n\nLeave ten minutes early and you'll see the best White House film in years, stick around and get the big screen version of The West Wing. No contest really.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Apr 29, 2003\n\nAbout fairness,privacy,shrewdness in politics,witch hunts,dignity,pride, and service to one's country and sticking to your guns.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Apr 26, 2003\n\nThe Contender has renewed my faith that good movies can indeed be produced if enough care is given to the production. It's too bad so many of 2000's films have failed to do that.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Feb 8, 2003\n\nIt can be said that politics is a filthy business and if you don't want to get your hands dirty, you shouldn't participate.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 29, 2003"
