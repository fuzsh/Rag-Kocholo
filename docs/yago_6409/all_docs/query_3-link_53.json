        "text": "This IndieWire article featuring Christine Vachon is truly compelling. In it the film producer shares a few words of wisdom to those who aspire to build indie films within the market and one piece of advice which struck me was \"Pay attention to what’s going on around you.\" Now the additional topics she touches on such as \"Recognize the value of a great script,\" and \"Juggle multiple projects\" are just as valuable, but I think this idea of having your finger on the market's pulse is the baseline to everything. It is not enough to simply produce a product... you have to push it out into the world in a strategic method which is guided by other elements and staying in tune with all those elements is key. I could honestly go on and on about the importance of understanding market / risk analysis, the effects of collective narrative, the creative economy bubble - but give the article a read and let something resonate with you. - https://lnkd.in/eNgW-ucR\n\nThe Big Short on America... \"The Big Short,\" directed by Adam McKay and co-written by McKay and Charles Randolph, is an extraordinary biographical crime comedy-drama that masterfully brings the complexities of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to the big screen. Based on Michael Lewis's 2010 book \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\", the film unravels the intricacies of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent economic meltdown. The star-studded cast, including Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt, delivers captivating performances that illuminate the human and systemic failings leading to one of the most significant financial collapses in history. Head over to Movies to History, where you can find my recommendation for the 2015 film, along with an extensive eexplanation of the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, a breakdown of the events leading up to the crisis, as well as the aftermath that was The Great Recession in the United States from 2008-2009. You can also read all about the cinematic triumph that is five time The Academy award nominatied and winning film for Best Adapted Screenplay, The Big Short, and then you can head over to Hulu and watch the Adam McKay film tonight! #moviestohistory #featuredfilmblog #thebigshort #recommendation #ChristianBale #stevecarell #ryangosling #bradpitt #AdamMcKay #thebigshortinsidethedoomsdaymachine #MichaelLewis #financialcrisis #housingmarketcrash #academyawards #BestAdaptedScreenplay #ParamountPictures https://lnkd.in/ey9qawJT\n\n✅ The Best Way to Say Goodbye to Endless Revisions Once and For All! Are the endless design revisions driving you crazy? Of course it is! Do we even need to ask? Every time you think that the content is finally done, there comes another change to be made. Wouldn't you like to put an end to these revisions? Watch as Trisha pushes back against endless changes in this comedic short film - https://lnkd.in/gs6QPDhd Will Trisha finally say goodbye to revisions for good?\n\nThe Rising Significance of Auteurs in Today’s Film Industry In a recent Lucas Shaw at Bloomberg News, WME | William Morris Endeavor partner and agent Robert Newman underscored the pivotal role of creative leadership in the film industry: Empowering Visionaries: Newman asserts, “The lesson with Barbie is to bet on #filmmakers. This is not TV. Do not devalue the expertise and vision of great filmmakers. The #auteurs matter more than they ever did.” A Shift in the Narrative: Newman believes, \"I think we're in the midst of a big cultural change. Look at the 1960s with Westerns or Bible movies. They got swept away.\" I yearn for the day when superhero movies and other CGI-heavy amusement park films are replaced. I hope that studios won’t resort to another poor choice, like toy or game movies, but instead prioritize original stories imbued with genuine meaning and emotional depth. The success of “Oppenheimer” serves as a potent reminder of the captivating power of such #films. Oppenheimer’s Triumph: A hearty congratulations to the team behind “Oppenheimer,” which has become a box-office sensation, grossing $957 million worldwide. It bagged seven awards in total and became the highest-grossing film to win Best Picture in over two decades, exemplifying the power of original filmmaking. Bravo to Cord Jefferson! His Oscar win for the satirical film \"American Fiction\" is a well-deserved recognition. This film, especially relevant for the literary world, uses humor to explore representation in publishing. ‘American Fiction’ instigates a dialogue about the prevailing trends in the literary industry. The film satirically highlights how the focus has shifted from the quality of the narrative to the identity of the author. It underscores the growing emphasis on representation, often overshadowing the intrinsic value of the work itself. This trend raises questions about the future of literature and storytelling, and whether an author’s identity has become a determining factor in the success of a book. Lastly, I had the pleasure of watching #Dune 2 in #IMAX, and it was nothing short of breathtaking! If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend you do. #FilmIndustry #Auteurs #OriginalStorytelling\n\nA Big Review... Michael Lewis's 2010 book \"The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine\" is a riveting and incisive exploration of the 2007-08 financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of the United States housing bubble. Lewis, a masterful storyteller with a keen eye for detail, delves into the complexities of the financial markets and the individuals who foresaw the impending disaster. The book serves as both a detailed chronicle of the events leading up to the crisis and a critique of the systemic failures that allowed it to happen. Head over to Movies to History, where you cand read a review of the 2010 book, that includes context and background on the 2007-08 financial crisis, as well as the key figures and institutions leading up to and involved in the crisis that led to the Great Recession of 2008-09, with an analysis of key themes discussed by Lewis in the book, as well as a description of \"The Big Short\", the 2015 film adaption of Lewis's book directed by Adam McKay from Paramount Pictures. After you have read the review for the \"Featured Film Blog\" of the month for June, you can stream the film adaption on Hulu or Paramount+, and short the couch market with The Academy award winning film for Best Adapted Screenplay tonight! #moviestohistory #featuredfilmblog #thebigshort #review #ChristianBale #stevecarell #ryangosling #bradpitt #AdamMcKay #thebigshortinsidethedoomsdaymachine #MichaelLewis #financialcrisis #housingmarketcrash #academyawards #BestAdaptedScreenplay #ParamountPictures https://lnkd.in/e-xFHPEr\n\nThe Grab is probably the most important film you will see this year and a stark reminder of the power of film. Not only for entertainment, (and this doc is so well done) but also for information. Last night I was able to attend the screening for The Grab at WME. And I still can’t believe what I watched. I won’t take up your time explaining what the film is about just please go see it when it releases next week. This is some of the best investigative journalism I have ever seen. And while this could have been in an article, a book or chopped up into smaller pieces for social media. The power of this information resonated even more by being on the big screen. I can’t wait for you all to see it, because there is a deeper discussion to be had. But today I just want to remind us of how important our industry is. Film brings people together from different walks of life in ways that nothing else can. Film allows us to see each other and this world in ways we normally wouldn’t. Film shows us what is, but also what is possible. The Grab reminded me of why I do what I do and look forward to continuing to do it. In our world where we are so divided on many issues. The Grab challenges us to consider this. That as different as we are there is one thing that will always unite us…….our humanity.\n\nWhen I studied history at school, people used textbooks. These days, kids watch Netflix! Does it really matter if the Crown isn't 100% accurate, or if it carries a \"truth\" warning? It's just entertainment?! It can matter in the sense that drama is actually an incredibly powerful way of engaging people's attention in issues - and potentially of shaping the public's understanding of past events. Just look at the Post Office Horizon scandal - the facts have been in the public domain for many, many years, but it only really received any attention when ITV ran their drama Mr Bates v ... Dramas about v historic events obviously carry limited/zero defamation risks, but films about more recent stories need to tread a bit more carefully. Some of the real people featured might not appreciate how they are characterised. The High Court has ruled today that the portrayal of an academic in Steve Coogan's film about the discovery of King Richard III's remains was defamatory... In a nutshell, the claimant argued that the film cast him in a v bad light and, amongst other things, suggested that he wrongfully tried to take all the credit for finding Richard's bones (underneath a car park). The scoundrel! He disputes the film's version of events ... The court proceedings will now progress - unless they get settled at this relatively early stage ... #libel #defamation #media #publicrelations #netflix #pr Brabners https://lnkd.in/e2EC56Cb\n\nDear Adam McKay, As we are now mentioned in an article together - I assume we are now best of friends and I expect to be invited on set on your next feature film (or hilarious spoof ad). Let me know. x Aimée McLaughlin interviewed me and Staci Roberts-Steele who is co producer at Adam McKay's production company - Yellow Dot Studios. Staci is also a frequent collaborator with Adam on his movies including Don't Look Up. Here's some words that I apparently said which actually makes me sound like I marginally know what I'm talking about: The secret to getting climate humour right, much like comedy in general, is to make sure that your audience can relate to what you're saying. \"I think it's about tangibility; when you make the problem seem so big and grand - trees are burning and the world is falling apart - it's such a big problem that you can't grab it,\" says White. \"What humour does which is really interesting is it makes that problem smaller.” 10 Days London / Yellow Dot Studios #dontlookup Link in bio but it is behind a paywall so only gives you a snippet. #humour #greenwashing #funny #sustainability #advertising #advertisingagency"
