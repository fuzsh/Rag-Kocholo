        "text": "Explosive star-power meets spectacular action when Robert Redford (3 Days of the Condor) goes up against James Gandolfini (TV’s The Sopranos) in this powerhouse action-thriller. His service to his country made him a hero. But one mistake made him a prisoner. For General Eugene Irwin (Redford), it’s just a matter of serving out his sentence—until he makes the shocking discovery that his fellow inmates are being murdered. Now, Irwin is taking command one last time—and unifying the inmates in a desperate battle to overcome a brutally corrupt system and show the world the truth. Directed by Rod Lurie (The Contender), The Last Castle crackles with action, drama and a top-notch cast that includes Mark Ruffalo (Avengers: Infinity War), Paul Calderon (King of New York), Clifton Collins Jr. (187), Robin Wright (Unbreakable) and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty).\n\nPress & Exhibitors\n\nBelow please find additional information and promotional materials for this film.
