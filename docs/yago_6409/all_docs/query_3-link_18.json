        "text": "The New Yorker, October 16, 2000 P. 256\n\nTHE CURRENT CINEMA reviews of “The Contender” and “Dr. T & the Women”... In “The Contender,” a new thriller about scandal and power in Washington, Jeff Bridges, as President Jackson Evans, combines a little of Bill Clinton with a great deal of Lyndon B. Johnson. ...“The Contender,” which was written and directed by Rod Lurie, alters a key element from the Lewinsky affair—it’s a female politician who is damaged by sexual scandal—but the inquisitorial Runyon is clearly meant to remind us of impeachment players like Bob Barr, Bill McCollum, and the other Republican congressmen who thrust the spear of sanctimony into Bill Clinton’s gut. ...“The Contender” is good, juicy fun—more vivid and entertaining than such overtly funny Presidential satires as “Dave” and “Dick.” In democratic politics, you have to settle for tricking, seducing, or humiliating your opponent when you really want to kill him or throw him in jail, and Rod Lurie knows that the containment of open violence can liberate bad manners. If Lurie’s name seems slightly familiar, that’s because he was once a film critic of sorts, the kind of critic who spreads praise far and wide and who then asks famous actors to appear on his radio show—clearly a man who knows a thing or two about politics. But if Lurie’s hack-journalistic practice opened the way to his becoming a director, no one could now say that his opportunism has misfired. He has assembled a first-rate group of actors and written good roles for them. ...In Robert Altman’s “Dr. T & the Women,” Dallas seems to be the town that feminism forgot. ...At first, the movie seems to be an amiable, whirligig farce about a man who sugars women, and the women who love him in return. Altman works with his customary fluid tracking shots, his camera picking up one of the women as she enters the office, following her to the reception desk, dropping her for someone else, picking her up again, and so on. To our surprise, however, everything falls apart for Dr. T.—his wife (Farrah Fawcett) strips off her clothes in a mall and fades into a loony bin, his daughters fall into turmoil, and the doctor throws himself into the arms of an independent woman (Helen Hunt) who doesn’t want much of anything from him. “Dr. T” concerns little of importance, yet it develops a strangely apocalyptic tone. ...Some of the women are so giddy that they seem to have stepped out of an Almodovar comedy, but with this crucial difference—Almodovar loves women and Altman, from the evidence of this film and others, such as “The Player,” does not. There is an aura of condescension hanging over “Dr. T & the Women,” and it sours one’s pleasure in the director’s skill long before the movie is over."
