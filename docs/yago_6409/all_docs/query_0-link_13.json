        "text": "ROD LURIE (Director/Producer) wrote and directed the widely praised Academy AwardÂ® and Golden Globe Award nominated political thriller The Contender, starring Joan Allen, Jeff Bridges, Gary Oldman and Christian Slater. The film was also honored by the Broadcast Film Critics with the first-ever Alan J. Pakula Award. Most recently, Lurie directed the military prison thriller The Last Castle, which starred Robert Redford, James Gandolfini and Mark Ruffalo.\n\nLurie created and served as an executive producer on ABC's highly acclaimed hit series, Commander in Chief. Imaging a world in which the President of the United States is a woman, the popular series stars Geena Davis and Donald Sutherland. Lurie also executive produced the ABC one-hour FBI drama, Line of Fire, starring Anson Mount, Leslie Hope and David Paymer.\n\nIn 1998, Lurie made his film writing and directing debut with the dramatic short Four Second Delay, which won the Best Short Film award at the Atlanta Film Festival and the Crested Butte Reel Fest. The short also won the Prix du Jury at the Festival of American Cinema in Deauville, France. In 2000, he made his first feature film Deterrence, a drama about America coming to the brink of nuclear war, starring Kevin Pollak and Timothy Hutton, and in 2003 his short film, The Nazi, was in the Official Selection of the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nBefore becoming a filmmaker, Lurie completed a career in the military and enjoyed success as a film critic and entertainment reporter. Lurie graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1984 and went on to serve for four years as a Combat Arms officer in the U.S. Army. He broke into journalism as an entertainment reporter for the New York Daily News, and was a film critic and interviewer for Channel 12 in Fairfield, Connecticut, as well as a frequent contributor to Premiere, Movieline and Entertainment Weekly.\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Lurie worked as a film critic, investigative reporter and contributing editor to Los Angeles Magazine from 1990-1995. As an investigative reporter in the entertainment industry, Lurie's discovery of unethical and illegal practices of tabloid newspapers gained him national exposure on programs such as 60 Minutes, Entertainment Tonight, The Larry King Show, Nightline, Geraldo and The Jane Whitney Show.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1999, Lurie was the film critic for 790 AM KABC Radio in Los Angeles, where his top-rated movie review show entertained Southern California moviegoers every Saturday. His on-air guests included: Tom Hanks, James Woods, Billy Bob Thornton, Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Landau, James Cameron and Mel Gibson.\n\nIn addition, in 1995 Lurie authored the book Once Upon A Time in Hollywood."
