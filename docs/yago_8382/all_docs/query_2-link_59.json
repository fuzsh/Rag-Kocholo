A black comedy in which a divorced man falls for a beautiful woman, who uses magic to turn him into a sex slave. He doesn't seem to mind, until she gets bored and wants to leave him, and the things take a darker turn. Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes. 11.75 x 7.5 inches. Light creasing to the corners, else Near Fine."
