        "text": "presents her selection of films\n\nPostED ON 01.10.2019\n\nHer precocious burst onto the film scene could have foretold of a swift and short-lived career. But the fearless Marina Vlady has had the talent to choose great directors and build herself an impressive path. She will grace us with her presence at the festival this year!\n\nShe is only sixteen when André Cayatte's Before the Deluge earns her the SACD Suzanne-Bianchetti Award, given to the most promising young actress of the moment. Marina Vlady impresses by her maturity in her role as a lure, an accomplice of a theft of valuable stamps that will allow her and her friends to flee Europe, which they believe is on the brink of WWIII...\n\nBorn of noble parents, Russian immigrants, Catherine Marina de Poliakoff-Baidaroff, her birth name, follows the example of her older sister Etiennette, known as Odile Versois, who started out in the cinema a year before her. At the end of the 1950s, Marina Vlady has established herself as a captivating beauty, notably in films by her then-husband, actor and filmmaker Robert Hossein (like the thriller Nude in a White Car / Night Is Not for Sleep). But Vlady does not aspire to become a starlet. She makes bold decisions, which will lead her to a series of remarkable encounters with stellar directors: Marco Ferreri (The Conjugal Bed, which garners her a best actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1963), Orson Welles (Chimes at Midnight), Jean-Luc Godard (Two or Three Things I Know About Her).\n\nThe little-known and remarkable movie, Time to Live by Bernard Paul (1969), documents France in the late 1960s. Afterwards, in a whirlwind, Marina Vlady abruptly puts her career on hold for love, marrying Vladimir Vissotski, a singer, actor and poet protester, whose records are made in France, yet can only be found in the USSR on pirated mini-cassettes! Vlady later returns to the cinema and shoots a film in Russian, Lika: Chekhov’s Love / Subject for a Short Story by Sergei Yutkevich, known for Othello. In the years that follow, she works with an international array of filmmakers: Bertrand Tavernier (Let Joy Reign Supreme), Hungarian Márta Mészáros (The Two of Them) and Argentine Fernando Solanas (Tangos, The Exile of Gardel), among others…A rich career of an inspired actress and a liberated woman.\n\nDuring the Lumière festival,\n\nMarina Vlady will introduce\n\nBefore the Deluge by André Cayatte\n\nIn the psychosis of a new world conflict, five young people decide to flee.
