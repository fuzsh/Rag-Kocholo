        "text": "BY LORENZO CODELLI*\n\nDuring the closing ceremony at the 1960 Festival de Cannes, the presentation of the Palme d’Or to Fellini for La Dolce vita and the Jury Prize to Antonioni pour L’Avventura (The Adventure) were greeted by loud whistling. Georges Simenon, the President of the Jury, had appreciated the stylistic and thematic innovations of both works and would go on to strike up a brotherly relationship with Fellini. Both films marked the transition from a period of slow economic recovery to one of sudden economic boom, denouncing the disappearance of traditional moral values along the way.\n\nDuring the golden age of Italian cinema in the 1960s, the Festival honoured masterpieces such as Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), directed by Visconti (Palme d’Or), Signore & signori (The Birds, the Bees and the Italians), directed by Germi (Grand Prix), and Blow up, directed by Antonioni (Grand Prix), as well as the exceptional performance of Sophia Loren in La Ciociara (Two Women), directed by De Sica (an Award for Best Actress which would be a prelude to an Oscar for the actress). It also brought into the limelight Valerio Zurlini’s lyricism (La Ragazza con la valigia – Girl with a Suitcase), Pier Paolo Pasolini’s experimentalism (Uccellacci e uccellini – The Hawks and the Sparrows), Marco Ferreri’s irony (L’ape regina – The Conjugal Bed), Francesco Rosi’s disillusionment (Il Momento della verità – The Moment of Truth), Elio Petri’s fierceness (A ciascuno il suo – We Still Kill the Old Way) and Ermanno Olmi’s mysticism (I Fidanzati – The Fiances).\n\nB.

Redgrave\n\nBlow Up, 1967 © AFP\n\nLa Ciociara (Two Women), Vittorio De Sica, 1960\n\nFOCUS\n\nThe “before the revolution” generation\n\nThanks to the support of nonconformist producers such as Franco Cristaldi, Angelo Rizzoli, Mario Cecchi Gori, Goffredo Lombardo, Alfredo Bini and Moris Ergas, a wave of young talent was able to assert itself in the first half of the 1960s: Ermanno Olmi, Valerio Zurlini, Marco Ferreri, Marco Bellocchio, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Bernardo Bertolucci, Elio Petri, Franco Rossi, Ettore Scola, Ugo Gregoretti, Luciano Salce, Tinto Brass, Vittorio De Seta, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Florestano Vancini, and so on. Their generational revolt, which was aesthetic and political as well, was frequently in antithesis of the principles espoused by Visconti, Fellini, Antonioni, Germi and De Sica. Because of this sons-versus-fathers rebellion, as President of the Jury in 1969, Luchino Visconti decided to snub Marco Ferreri’s Dillinger è morto (Dillinger is Dead), a desperate ‘harakiri’ using ultramodern language. In parallel, during the same decade, a remarkable group of busy craftsmen emerged who would bring new blood – often literally – to popular genres, from horror films to westerns, “sword-and-sandal” epics and erotic films: Mario Bava, Sergio Leone, Sergio Sollima, Sergio Corbucci, Antonio Margheriti, Pasquale Festa Campanile, Damiano Damiani, Salvatore Samperi, Duccio Tessari, Franco Giraldi, and several others.\n\nArabian Nights,\n\nPier Paolo Pasolini, 1974\n\nThe Grande Bouffe\n\nMarco Ferreri, 1973\n\nBefore the Revolution\n\nBernaldo Bertollucci, 1967\n\nIn the 1970s, baptised the “Years of Lead” due to increasing terrorism and the threat of a military coup, the commedia all’italiana (Italian-style comedy), which served as a hilarious antidote to the ideological clashes going on at that time, made Festival audiences laugh loudly: Dramma della gelosia (The Pizza Triangle), directed by Ettore Scola (Best Actor Award went to its versatile protagonist, Marcello Mastroianni), Per grazia ricevuta (Between Miracles), by the brilliant comic and first-time director, Nino Manfredi (Best First Work Award), La grande bouffe (The Grande Bouffe), directed by Ferreri (FIPRESCI award), Vogliamo I Colonelli (We Want the Colonels), directed by Mario Monicelli, Profumo di donna (Scent of a Woman), directed by Dino Risi (Best Actor award went to the irresistible Vittorio Gassman), Brutti, sporchi e cattivi (Ugly, Dirty and Bad), directed by Ettore Scola (Best Director Award), L’ingorgo – Una storia impossibile; Black Out in Autostrada – Traffic Jam) directed by Luigi Comencini, and so on.\n\nAnn Margret, Vittorio Gassman\n\n1975 © AFP\n\nUgly, Dirty and Bad, Ettore Scola, 1976\n\nFabio Traversa, Moretti, Paolo Zaccagnini, Lina Sastri\n\nEcce Bombo, Cannes 1978 © AFP\n\nThe 1972 Grand Prix was awarded jointly to two very lucid counter-inquiries: Il Caso Mattei (The Mattei Affair), directed by Francesco Rosi and La classe operaia va in paradiso (The Working Class Goes to Heaven), directed by Elio Petri. This important event marked the return of social and political commitment, some twenty years after the end of the neorealist movement. And it was with great pride that Roberto Rossellini, President of the Jury in 1977, awarded the Palme d’Or to Padre Padrone (Father and Master) directed by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, two of his protégés, who, like their mentor, had decided to turn their attention to “pauperistic” television.\n\nThe arrival of Nanni Moretti on the scene in 1978 with Ecce bombo signalled the beginning of an era of autarchic screenwriter-actors that would leave a permanent mark on the film scene, from Maurizio Nichetti to Francesco Nuti, Adriano Celentano, Carlo Verdone, Massimo Troisi and Roberto Benigni.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Italian cinema faced a general shortage of resources and ideas. I remember that Once Upon a Time in America directed by Sergio Leone was awaited eagerly at Cannes after taking several years to shoot, backed by an astronomical budget and ambitions, the likes of which have not been seen since.\n\nAt the 1987 Festival, Fellini made a comeback with Intervista, a subdued, but very brilliant autobiography which tackled the crisis of the film industry massacred by TV, and made clear that the golden era of la dolce vita was indeed a thing of the past. At the same Festival, Mastroianni, who appeared as himself in Intervista, received the Award for Best Actor for Dark Eyes directed by Nikita Mikhalkov.\n\nThe rising original filmmakers were rather few in number and did not really form a homogenous group: Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso, Special Grand Prix), Daniele Luchetti (Domani accadrà –It’s Happening Tomorrow), Michele Placido (Pummarò –Tomato), Gabriele Salvatores (Turnè – Strada blues), Pupi Avati (Magnificat), Francesca Archibugi (Il grande cocomero –The Great Pumpkin), Mario Martone (L’amore molesto –Nasty Love), Mimmo Calopresti (La Seconda volta -The Second Time), Peter Del Monte (Compagna di viaggio – Travelling Companion) and Gianni Amelio (Il Ladro di bambini –The Stolen Children, Jury Grand Prix).\n\nCinema Paradiso, Giuseppe Tornatore, 1989\n\nAVAILABLE FROM 1st MARCH: \"ITALIAN FILMS AT CANNES 2000-2010\" (3/3).\n\n> DOWNLOAD THE PDF VERSION\n\n* Lorenzo Codelli is a journalist and historian. He also contributes to the Festival de Cannes, the magazine \"Positif\", the \"International Film Guide\" and other publications.\n\nThe Festival de Cannes would like to thank the authors for contributing for free."
