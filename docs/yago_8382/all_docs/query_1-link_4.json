        "text": "ARE you a bachelor pushing 40 and planning to take as your wife a beautiful girl of good family, excellent manners and scrupulous morals? If you are and don't want to be discouraged, don't go to see \"The Conjugal Bed,\" an Italian film known originally as \"L'Ape Regina\" (\"The Queen Bee\"), which came to the Fine Arts and the Forum yesterday.But if you aren't in that category—if you are anything else, youthful or old, male or female, fancy free or already hooked—and if you are in the market for a lot of immoderate laughs (and some moderate philosophizing) go to see this film.For here is another ripe and racy Italian satiric comedy about the grimly potential hazards of the matrimonial state—at least, for mellowing gentlemen who marry verdant wives. It is not quite as sly and sardonic as \"Divorce—Italian Style,\" not as wittily written or devastatingly played. But it is of that sort — a lushly Latin, completely candid job that makes fun of the eternal battle between the females and the males.The hero is a nice fellow who makes a classic mistake. He thinks he is marrying a woman when he's actually marrying a queen bee. Figuratively speaking, that is. She's a beautiful, honey-making thing who delights him with a spell of wild indulgence and then, in the sweetest, tenderest way—and in the cyclical fashion of the insect—slips him a deadly sting.Obviously, Marco Ferreri, who directed and helped to write the script, is a close and amused observer of the Italian middle class. For he has crowded his film with delightful details of Roman family life—little glints of the matriarchal complex and religious formalities that are craftily used by the females to intimidate the males. And he has filled it with rather amazing scenes of intimate domesticity. So much conjugal clattering about a boudoir has seldom been seen on the screen.He has also intruded into it some frank and wry intimations of the eventual embarrassments of a husband who is blessed with what is known as a demanding mate and some rather bold observations of the behavior of a wife in pregnancy. As I say, this is not a picture to mince domesticity or words. But it is vividly recognizable and done in comparatively good taste.What is more—and most important—it is disarmingly droll and precise about the pitfalls awaiting the drone bee that obligingly mates with the queen. Few sights are more funny and pathetic than the one of the hero wasting away, hopefully husbanding his stamina for the future we know cannot be, while his healthy young wife proceeds serenely to be the monarch in the home.Much of the charm of the picture is in the wonderfully dry comic style of Ugo Tognazzi as the husband and the pungency of Marina Vlady as the wife. Mr. Tognazzi has a wonderfully mild, harassed air and a beautiful sense of timing that puts comment into his every move. When he pleads with a priest, for instance, to bless a hardboiled egg because, as he tells the cleric, \"I'm counting on that to help,\" he is brilliantly serio-comic. And when he simply looks at his wife, he washed-out and she briskly blooming, there's a world of humorous pathos in his eyes.And Miss Vlady's cool, initial primness, her avidity when released by the act of matrimony and her delicate, ladylike hauteur when she has accomplished her sexual and social mission are very tasty, indeed. It is no wonder that this job got her the laurel as best actress at the Venice festival this year.Igi Polidoro as the wife's dumb cousin, Riccardo Fellini as the husband's friend and Achille Maieroni as a horse-faced hair-triggered, domineering aunt contribute to the flavor and funniness of this film.A nicely handled camera, a congenial musical score and very good English subtitles are further felicities. They add to the sum of entertainment to be found in \"The Conjugal Bed.\""
