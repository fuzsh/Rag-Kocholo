        "text": "Norms, middle-class, religion – worlds of Marco Ferreri’s films\n\nMarco Ferreri should have been a veterinarian. That was what he studied but\n\nnever finished. At the age of 22 he started working on film as production\n\nmanager and producer. In 1950 he founded Film Monthly (Documento mensile)\n\nwith Ricardo Ghone. Although it had only two issues, and those were screened\n\nvery rarely, his helpers were some of the most famous Italian directors, writers\n\nand screenplay writers: Visconti, Fellini, Moravia, De Sica, Zavattini, etc. His\n\nqualities as manager and producer proved to be very valuable in the film-omnibus\n\nLove in the City (Amore in Citta, 1952),the film that Carlo Lizzani in\n\nhis history of Italian cinema labels as ‘one of the most important experiments\n\nof pure neorealism’. Film is an actual survey shot under the supervision of\n\nCesare Zavattini. Through different episodes it speaks of different aspects of\n\nlove, emotional and erotic life in a contemporary metropolis. Ferreri as\n\nproducer and organizer cooperated again with many great directors such as\n\nAntonioni, Fellini, Lattuada, Lizzani, Risi, and Maselli.\n\nWith experience Ferreri acquired knowledge and skill. Working with great Italian\n\nauthors he came to an understanding of film as a medium through which one can\n\nexpress one’s beliefs. He also came to realize that focusing on one idea or\n\nthesis does not necessarily result in a lousy film, although all the elements\n\nare subordinated to expressing a single attitude.\n\nThe thematic range of his films in its widest sense encompasses the relationship\n\nof an individual towards other individuals and society on all levels: he deals\n\nwith (sexual) identity as in Bye Bye Monkey (Ciao Maschio, 1978), with\n\nmale-female relations in The Conjugal Bed (Una storia moderna: l’ape\n\nregina, 1963), where he openly ridicules marital relations of an utterly\n\ninferior man and his wife. He goes on to mock social institutions such as the\n\nwedding and marriage itself. In the film The Wedding March (Marcia\n\nnuziale, 1966) we follow elaborate wedding preparations only to finally\n\nattend to the wedding of house pets of two wealthy families. Ferreri, however,\n\nwas conscious of his cinema heritage and the quality of those films. He also\n\nunderstood that the ideas of neorealists such as Vittorio de Sica were outdated.\n\nA year before Love in the City (1952) Vittorio de Sica shot one of the\n\nbest and most critical neorealist films Umberto D. Poor De Sica’s retiree\n\nis a lonely man who lives in a rented house with a small dog. Unable to rebel\n\nagainst life, he follows his path with his only friend towards a bitter, short\n\nfuture.\n\nFerreri’s old man from the Wheelchair (El cochesito, 1958) is the\n\nantithesis to De Sica’s. The old devil would kill most of his family to get the\n\nwheelchair that would enable him to socialize with his neighbours. The ending,\n\nof course, is rather bizarre much in Ferreri’s style: screaming police cars\n\nsurround the old man and take him to prison.\n\nFerreri’s solutions are always quite drastic, and viewers often have difficulty\n\ndigesting them: one of his characters cuts off his penis with an electric knife,\n\nwhile Ornella Mutti ‘closes’ her vagina with a safety pin in Tales of\n\nOrdinary Madness (1981). For Ferreri this signals disorientation and loss of\n\nidentity. Physical mutilation often serves as foreplay to bizarre suicides, as\n\nwas the case with the most bizarre suicide attempts in European film La\n\nGrande Bouffe, 1973. Four friends bring themselves to the brink of death,\n\nstuffing themselves with foods of all sorts and shapes. Gluttony is definitely a\n\ndeadly sin, but committing suicide by gluttony is certainly even worse. The\n\npunishment must be much more severe.\n\nSex, violence, tradition, norms, bourgeois attitudes, and religion dominate the\n\nworlds of Marco Ferreri’s films. Everything is drastic. Nothing is hidden and\n\nall is heading towards a global genocid, as in Don’t Touch the White Woman!\n\n(Touchez pas la femme blanche, 1975), with Marcello Mastroianni. Mastroianni\n\nplays a longhaired Buffalo Bill at the parking lot of the Paris Les Halles who\n\nis attempting to deport old Parisian ‘Indians’ from the spleen of Paris in order\n\nto build an ultra-modern polyvalent building. This happens before they kill his\n\nfiancée – Catherine Deneuve. Silly Pinkerton agents conduct a phoney\n\ninvestigation of his building permits, in the name of the opposition, of course.\n\nIt is no wonder that Marco Ferreri often had problems with censorship.(Dario\n\nMarković)"
