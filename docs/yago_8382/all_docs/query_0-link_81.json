        "text": "CONVICTED. DUSAN TADIC, 41, brutal Bosnian Serb prison guard; of killing and torturing Muslim civilians in 1992; concluding the first trial of the war-crimes tribunal; in the Hague.\n\nSENTENCED. CHADREL RINPOCHE, 58, high-ranking Tibetan monk accused of leaking information to the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader; to six years in prison; on charges of disclosing state secrets and conspiracy to split China; in Xigaze, Tibet. Chadrel is a casualty of China’s determination to assert its authority over Tibet’s spiritual life.\n\nDIED. MANUEL ELIZALDE, 60, unfairly maligned Philippine official or rogue amateur anthropologist, depending upon whether his “discovery” of a primitive tribe in Mindanao is to be believed; of undisclosed causes; in Manila. No savage seemed nobler–or more unreal–than the bare-bodied Tasaday, whom Elizalde introduced to the public in 1971. When journalists found in 1986 that these simple, food-gathering folk had traded in their leafy loincloths for jeans, T shirts and baseball caps, skeptics charged foul play.\n\nDIED. MARCO FERRERI, 68, satirical Italian director who explored the human appetite in all its savage absurdity; of a heart attack; in Paris. Morality runs amuck in Ferreri’s erotic works. In The Conjugal Bed (1963), a groom is consumed by his wife’s lust; in The Grande Bouffe (1973), four middle-aged men gorge themselves to death.\n\nDIED. NARCISCO YEPES, 69, classical Spanish guitarist who redesigned his beloved instrument, adding four strings, to accommodate his technical prowess; of cancer; in Murcia, Spain. Fans took to Yepes’ theme song to Rene Clement’s Forbidden Games (1951), but his peers never accepted his 10-stringed fingerboard–despite the enhanced resonance under his deft touch.\n\nDIED. MURRAY KEMPTON, 79, maverick, moralistic columnist whose baroque language could never hide an unwavering sympathy for the oppressed and an abiding sense of fair play; in New York City. A liberal labor reporter for the New York Post in 1942, Kempton continued his sometimes quixotic fight for underdogs on the left and right–he even defended the fallen Richard Nixon when the former President was rejected by a New York co-op board. His many awards included a 1985 Pulitzer for his Newsday commentary.\n\nDIED. ART HANES, 80, die-hard segregationist Southern mayor; in the city he ruled for a single, notorious term, Birmingham, Ala. In 1962 Hanes shut down Birmingham’s parks rather than open them to blacks; in 1968 he became James Earl Ray’s first lawyer.\n\nDIED. BOB DEVANEY, 82, pre-eminent coach in college football in the early 1970s when he led the University of Nebraska to back-to-back national titles; in Lincoln, Neb. His wisecracking style and plump, rumpled figure sometimes made rivals underestimate him. But he never coached a losing season during 11 years with the Cornhuskers."
