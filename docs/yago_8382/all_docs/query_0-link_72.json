So, when you have a director with such a singular vision and style, it’s often intriguing to ask them what types of film and TV series get them excited. Surely, Wes Anderson is able to name some works that you’ve never heard of that will open your eyes to his earliest influences, right?\n\nREAD MORE: Wes Anderson’s ‘The French Dispatch’ Moves To October, ‘Artemis Fowl’ Goes Straight To Disney+\n\nSpeaking to the French agency, Centre national du cinéma et de l’image animée, Anderson was asked to provide some suggestions for what films and TV series he thinks people should watch.\n\nOn the film side, Anderson mentioned filmmaker Marco Ferreri’s 1973 movie, “The Big Feast.” The filmmaker admits that he “discovered” the film years ago, but “I hadn’t really gotten into it.” But upon a recent rewatch, Anderson “loved it.”\n\nIn addition to “The Big Feast,” he also recommends two more Ferreri films, “The Conjugal Bed” and “The Ape Woman.” If you’re looking for films that aren’t directed by Ferreri, Anderson suggests checking out William Wyler’s “The Westerner” and Seth Holt’s “Station Six-Sahara.”\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The French Dispatch’: Wes Anderson Wanted His Cast & Crew To Study Films From Godard, Clouzot & More\n\nAs for TV series, the “Grand Budapest Hotel” filmmaker only has one recommendation, “Better Call Saul.” And why does he suggest everyone check out the “Breaking Bad” spin-off series?\n\n“It’s simply my favorite series,” Anderson explained. Well, that really does say it all, huh?\n\nREAD MORE: ‘The French Dispatch’ Trailer Breakdown: Analyzing The 4 Sections In Wes Anderson’s Short Story Anthology Collection"
