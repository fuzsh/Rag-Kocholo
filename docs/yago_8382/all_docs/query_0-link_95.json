        "meta_description": "German postcard by Ufa, Berlin-Tempelhof, no. CK-76. Photo: Unifrance Film.\n\t\n\tSensual, alluring French actress <b>Marina Vlady</b> (1938) had the makings of just another blonde bombshell, but in 1963 the feline beauty stunned everybody with her performance in <i>L’Ape Regine/The Conjugal Bed</i>. At the Cannes Film Festival she won the award for Best Actress.\n\t\n\tMarina Vlady was born Marina De Poliakoff-Baidaroff in Clichy, France, as the daughter of a noted, Russian born painter and opera singer. She is the youngest sister of actresses Odile Versois, Hélène Vallier and Olga Baïdar-Poliakoff. Like her siblings, she began acting as a child and for a while pursued a ballet career. Marina and Olga made both their minor film debuts in Orage d'été/Summer Storm (1949, Jean Gehret) which featured their oldest sister Odile. Marina caught the eye of talent agents. She was a vision of loveliness alongside Marcello Mastroianni in the touching WWII drama Penne nere/ Black Feathers (1952, Oreste Biancoli). The following year she co-starred with Italy's top character actor Aldo Fabrizi as her father in L’età dell'amore/Too Young for Love (1953, Lionello De Felice). In 1955, at the ripe young age of 17, Marina met and married director/writer/actor Robert Hossein, who featured her prominently and seductively in a number of his films including Les salauds vont en enfer/ The Wicked Go to Hell (1956, Robert Hossein), as a femme fatale bent on revenge, Pardonnez nos offenses (1956, Robert Hossein), La nuit des espions/ Double Agents (1959, Robert Hossein) and, notably, Toi, le venin/ Nude in a White Car (1958, Robert Hossein), which co-starred her sister Odile. With her sensual and alluring image she gained international renown. The marriage with Hossein lasted only a few years.\n\t \n\tMarina Vlady could have ended up in film history annals as merely a second-rate Brigitte Bardot, but the provocative sex kitten proved that she was capable of much more. In 1961 her role in the costume drama La Princesse de Clèves/Princess of Cleves (1961, Jean Delannoy) at the side of Jean Marais was reviewed favorably. In 1963 she gave a stunning performance as the sexually insatiable wife in L’Ape Regine/The Conjugal Bed (1963, Marco Ferreri) opposite Ugo Tognazzi, and was nominated for a Golden Globe, and won the Best Actress Award at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. She also starred in Godard’s essay on Paris, prostitution and cinema, 2 ou 3 choses que je sais d'elle/Two or Three Things I Know About Her (1967, Jean-Luc Godard). Gracing both French and Italian productions throughout most of her career, Marina was not shy at playing unsympathetic, even caustic characters, and proved adept at both saucy comedy and edgy drama. One of her rare English roles was Kate Percy in the Shakespeare adaptation Campanadas a medianoche/Chimes at Midnight (1965, Orson Welles). In 1967 she played at the théâtre Hébertot in Paris with her three sisters, Hélène Vallier, Odile Versois, and Olga Poliakoff, and they had 250 performances. Her later years included films like Ök ketten/The Two of Them (1977, Márta Mészarós), Tangos, l'exil de Gardel/Tangos, the Exile of Gardel (1985, Fernando Solanas), and Splendor (1989, Ettore Scola), and much tv. She was married four times. She has two sons with Robert Hossein. Her second husband wasJean-Claude Brouillet. In 1969 (or 1970) she married Russian poet, song-writer and actor Vladimir Vysotsky, who died in 1980 of drug overdose aggravated by chronic alcoholism. About their love affair she wrote the memoir Vladimir, or the Aborted Flight. Her fourth husband, Léon Schwartzenberg, passed away in 2003.\n\t\n\tSources: Gary Brumburgh (IMDb), Hal Erickson (All Movie Guide), Bios Stars International, Wikipedia, and IMDb.",
