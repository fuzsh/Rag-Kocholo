        "text": "In the shadow of the Vatican, charming and well-behaved newlywed Regina (Marina Vlady) wants to have a baby. Alfonso, her husband, once a roistering singleton, has to do his marital duty for as long as it takes—or perhaps until his death do they part. Starring Ugo Tognazzi in a spry first appearance in Ferreri’s films, The Conjugal Bed is an implacable parable about maternal desire as dictated by society and religion to all women, especially in opposition to joyous sensuality. The film experienced fierce censorship, but was nonetheless selected for the Cannes Film Festival, thus establishing Vlady as a major actress for her breathtaking performance as Regina. Courtesy of Cinecittà.\n\nScreening with:\n\nIl professore\n\nMarco Ferreri, 1964, Italy, 29m\n\nItalian with English subtitles\n\nFerreri’s contribution to the Controssesso omnibus film is a funny depiction of the kinky, unmentionable little manias of an old bachelor (Ugo Tognazzi) nostalgic for the Fascist era.
