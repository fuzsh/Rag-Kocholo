        "text": "If you are new to iridology you've probably had questions like the five I've listed below and it's highly likely you've not found satisfactory answers. I know because from the questions I see it's pretty obvious that MOST iridologists CAN'T answer the first one, and fumble over answering the rest of them. 1. What is iridology? 2. Why does it work? 3. What can it teach us? 4. Why should professionals use constitutional iridology? 5. How is it best used in clinical practice? Let me help you out here, especially if you are new to iridology. We'll do some iris analysis cases as I explain the answers to the questions. On Wednesday, Oct 25 I'll be doing a free mini-class to answer those questions. Here are the details. Date: Wednesday, Oct 25, 2023 Time: 12:00-1:00pm MDT Registration link: tinyurl.com/Li-2023-oct-25 Which of those questions would you like the answer to? Drop the number of the question in the comments and I'll send you the zoom registration link to join us. The replay link will be sent to registrants so even if you can’t join us live you can still receive the recording by registering before the event!\n\nPATHFINDER: THE ANSWER TO STREAMLINING YOUR HAEMATOLOGY WORKFLOWS Bottlenecks occur in haematology due to difficulty identifying samples that need to be shared, sent out, or rerun due to flags. This can cause too many films to be made, delays in results or missed tests due to sample misplacement. The PathFinder solves these problems by working in the following way: - The full blood count racks are used as an ‘input’, and samples would be loaded directly onto the PathFinder from the analytical systems post-analysis. - The PathFinder will then check the LIS/middleware to ensure all tests are completed. - If the tests are completed, the sample will be stored in a storage rack. - If the tests are not completed, the sample can be sorted into a further destination rack for testing, such as: - Rerun - Blood Film - ESR - HbA1c - Send Outs This allows the scientist to focus only on the tubes they need to interact with, rather than scanning, sorting and searching for samples. In early workflow studies, a lab processing 1000 samples per day could see a saving of approximately 4 hours per day as a minimum.

I suspect you have/had questions. Read to the end to find out how to register for this mini-class and how to receive the replay. In this mini-class we're going to look at 5 critical questions every iridologist should be able to answer, and as importantly, every aspiring iridologist should ask before enrolling in a course: 1) What is iridology? 2) Why does it work? 3) What can it teach us? 4) Why should health professionals use constitutional iridology, specifically? 5) How should iridology be used in clinical practice? We're going to look at many eye photos and work through several case studies to illustrate the answers to these questions. Date: Thursday, April 24, 2024 Time: 11:00am mountain daylight time Registration link: https://lnkd.in/gBUp7vaj The replay link will be sent to registrants only - so whether you attend the event live or not, if you want the replay, you must register before the event happens. The replay link will be sent by email approximately 24 hours after the event."
