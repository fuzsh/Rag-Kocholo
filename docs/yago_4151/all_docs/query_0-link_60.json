        "text": "Shimizu is an important Japanese film-maker, though he has been overshadowed by other film-makers like Mizoguchi Kenji and Ozu Yasujiro. Both of these film-makers admired Shimizu;\n\n“Ozu and I create films through hard work, but Shimizu is a genius.” a quotation by Mizoguchi Kenji.\n\n“A friend and contemporary at Shochiku of Ozu Yasujiro, Shimizu was one of Japanese cinema’s most individual talents, and seems at last to be receiving the recognition for his subtle, spontaneous technique, and humanity of his oeuvre.” (Alexander Jacoby in A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors).\n\nDespite Alex’s final note of optimism the films of Shimizu remain very difficult to see. A four title box set by Criterion seems to have been withdrawn. So it is both laudable and exciting that the Museum of the Moving Image in New York together with the Japan Society is offering a substantial retrospective throughout most of May. I was fortunate in being able to attend the opening weekend which included four silent films.\n\nMOMI is screening the films that Shimizu made for the Shochiku studio between 1931 and 1941. Shochiku, initially a theatrical concern, moved into film in 1920 and continues to this day. It was noted for using western-style techniques, as in the films made in Hollywood. In the silent era Japanese film was dominated by the Benshi, a narrator who stood alongside the screen improvising dialogue, commentary and even sound effects. Shochiku was an early studio to use onscreen titles, making Benshi style commentary redundant. It was partly because of the pressure from Benshi to retain their function that Japanese film continued producing silent titles up to the mid-1930s.\n\nAs with other film-makers a number of Shimizu’s early films are lost. The retrospective opened with a two part silent film from 1931 and 1932.\n\nSeven Seas Part 1– Virginity Chapter / Nanatsu no umi: Zenpen: Shojo hen, 72 minutes\n\nThe film opens with a distinctive framing; a reverse show of a young woman, dressed in modern style, and standing in the rear door of a final train carriage. She, a Lady, is a minor character but catches the attention of Takehiko, the elder son of the wealthy Yagibashi family. Takehiko shares derogatory comments about the young woman because of her modern style and disregard of traditional values; but he is also attracted. Later the Yagibashi family throw a garden party for the returning Takehiko. Here we meet a number of key characters. Sone Yumie (Kawasaki Hiroko) is engaged to a younger son Yuzuru (Egawa Ureo); her father is a retired civil servant and she has two younger sisters. Also at the party is Ayako (Murase Sachiko) who works as a reporter on a newspaper and is also in love with Yuzuru.\n\nEvents following the garden party disrupts the lives of all these characters. The actual event, involving a rape, is treated with great circumspection; though comments by a Benshi may have made the action clearer. The Yagibashi family use their wealth to protect their interests. Yumie’s family suffers a death and the severe illness of one sister. Yumie emerges as a strong willed young woman though adhering to traditional values. Thus by the end of Part 1 she is destined to marry Takehiko rather than Yuzuru who leaves home and becomes independent.\n\nSeven Seas Party 2 – Chastity Chapter / Nanatsu no umi: Kōhen: Teisō hen, 82 minutes\n\nThe second film focuses on Yumie’s married life with Takehiko. She crafts revenge on Takehiko and exploits the Yagibashi wealth to care for her ill sister. Yuzuru makes good as a writer and translator. And the Yagibashi family’s wealth and status fail to protect them when another son sells an exposé to the newspapers, causing the family public shame. Yumie and Yuzuru are finally able to find happiness together. However, Ayako is rather left out in the cold and in a slightly odd plotting discovers an absent father and leaves with him for the USA.\n\nThe two films run for 154 minutes in total. Both offer a complex plot and a fairly large cast of characters. The films were adapted by Noda Kogo from a novel by Maki Itsuma, [also known as Hasegawa Kaitaro). The cinematography is by Sasaki Taro who also worked on other films by Shimizu. The film has some distinctive stylistic tropes that were common in the silent films of Shimizu. There are some fine tracking shots; and in particular sequence set in a mountain rest home there are a series of pans and cuts across a hillside ending by a lake where we see the inverted reflection of a couple, then broken as the man throws a stone in the water. The style is naturalistic and the mise en scène uses sets and costumes to define the differences between the two families.\n\nThe cast are mainly experienced players at the Shochiku studio and are all fine in their characterisations. And the young Takemine Hideko appears as the youngest sister in the Sone family. One of the conflicts in the film is between the traditional and the modern, emphasised in a number of ways including in the dress of the female characters. Thus in one sequence Ayako tells Yuzuru of her love for him, dressed not in her usual western style but in a traditional kimono. Meanwhile Yumie usually wears traditional style dress but in one scene after her marriage confronting Takehiko she is dressed in expensive westerns style clothes.\n\nThe main conflict in the film is between the wealthy Yagibashi family, corrupted by their wealth, and Yumie and her family, less affluent but more moral. This relates the film to the ‘social tendency’ titles of the period, where class conflict took centre stage, sometimes with a Marxist influence.\n\nThis provided a fine opening to the programme. Whilst the plotting was at time challenging the tone and style of the film made this a pleasure to view.\n\nA Hero of Tokyo / Tôkyô no eiyû, 1935, 63 minutes\n\nThe title of this film refers to a male character but the central character is a mother, Nemoto Haruko (Yoshikawa Mitsuko). The film is part of a genre of haha-mono (mother story). A widow with two children she marries a widower, Nemoto Kaichi (Iwata Yûkichi), who also has a young son. Nemoto is involved in a Manchuria-Mongolia gold mining venture. Shortly after the marriage the company is exposed as a fraud and Nemoto disappears. Haruko is left to bring up her own two children, Hideo (Yokoyama Jun as the young boy) and Kayoko (Ichimura Mitsuko as the young girl), and her new stepson Kanichi (Aoki Tomio as the young boy) all alone. In order to support the family she takes a job as a hostess. The job of hostess and of a geisha shaded over into prostitution and in this period suffered from moral disapproval. This point is made when Haruko and her family, after bailiffs take possession of the home and furniture, move into a block of flats and we hear the local women gossiping and claiming she is\n\n“different from our sort.”\n\nHaruko keeps her work secret from the children.\n\nTwelve years later the children are grown up. Kanichi (Fujii Mitsugi) is a newspaper reporter; he appears to be married but the wife is a minor character. Hideo (Mitsui Kôji) and his sister Kayoko (Kuwano Michiko) find their lives disrupted when Haruko’s work becomes public knowledge. This leads to both leaving home and only Kanichi remains supporting Haruko. Then the father re-appears involved in another mining scam. This leads to tragic consequences but Kanichi’s actions lead his role as a ‘hero’.\n\nThe film demonstrates the way that Shimizu handles the contemporary society and its issues. Alex Jacoby comments;\n\n“His characters are almost always those who are alienated from the mainstream of society, whether by personal situation (poverty, family breakdown), profession (his men are often artists; his women hostesses or prostitutes), …”\n\nIn this Shimizu’s films parallel those of a contemporary, Naruse Mikio.\n\nThis film, like others, also offers a critical sub-text. The scams of the father reference Manchuria, which in this period Japan invaded and where they set up a puppet government. Alex comments,\n\n“the father is, metaphorically, a representative of the militarists and of the business interests that colluded with them…”\n\nI could not see a writers credit so it seems that this is very much down to the director; he was known to improvise with his production teams. Some of his films did not have a formal script but more a story line which he could change and vary as filming progressed.\n\nThe cinematography is by Nomura Hiroshi who worked on a number of Shimizu films in this period. And the film displays stylistic tropes which feature in several of these. One distinctive trope appears in the opening the film. We see a shot of a number of boys sitting on large pipes alongside a railway line. Several dissolves gradually reduce the number of boys to only one, the young Kanichi. In another shot with all the boys present they tease Kanichi because his father comes home later than theirs. Kanichi replies that this is because his father is more successful in business. The comment is repeated later in the film with a touch of humour; the mother arriving home late the stepson asks if she has been promoted.\n\nShimizu also has a tendency to open scenes with people’s feet in close-up. Late in the film this is seen in a scene following a criminal act and the arrival of police. These distinctive techniques contribute to Shimizu’s reputation as a stylist. He has a great sense of mise en scène; one nice touch in the film is when we see the young boys drawing each other and then the drawings appear later in the film as family dissensions disrupt the earlier relations.\n\nThis was Shimizu’s final silent film and it had a music track recorded on a Tsuchihashi sound system, though Shochiku went on to develop their own sound system.\n\nJapanese Girls at the Harbour / Minato no Nihon musume, 1933, 78 minutes\n\nThis is an early masterpiece by Shimizu. In the notes for the Criterion Eclipse discs Michael Koresky writes\n\n“with its delicate social commentary, rendered in minute gestures and precise mise-en-scene, is a perfect example of his naturalistic yet symbolic technique, as well as a proper introduction to his abiding interest in life’s outliers'”\n\nThe film is set in the port city of Yokohama and an early title identifies ‘The Foreign Settlement’ as the setting. Yokohama was one of the ports forced open by U.S. gunboat diplomacy in mid-C19th; Britain joined in and the developing city acquired a protected compound and even a servicing commercial sex district. The extra-territorial position ended in 1899 but it seems that the city retained an openness to western influences and imports.\n\nThe two Japanese girls are Sunako (Oikawa Michiko) and Dora (Innoue Ichiko), close friends who attend a European-style school and appear to live in a dormitory at a convent, [though we do not see any nuns). We first see the girls in a cliff-top viewpoint as a liner sails away. Here they meet Henry (Egawa Ureo), who rides a Harley-Davidson motor cycle, and is admired by both young women. However, it is Sunako who is his girlfriend and the two ride off together leaving Dora alone. Later we, and Dora, discover that he is connected to a group of likely petty criminals, [‘those hoodlums’] but also that he has another older girlfriend, Yōko (Sawa Ranko). Learning of this leads to a confrontation between Sunako and Henry and Yōko in the church [likely Catholic] alongside the dormitory. The result of this is that Sunako leaves Yokohama and seems to wander through several cities. We find her again in Kobe, another once extra-territorial port. Here she works as a geisha in a bar- i.e. a prostitute. Her fellow geisha is Masumi (Aizome Yumeko) and Sunako also has a sort of camp follower, Miura (Tatsuo Saitō Tatsuo), an itinerant painter who constantly paints portraits of Sunako. Masumi prompts Sunako to accompany her back to Yokohama to work in a bar run by Harada ( Nanjō Yasuo). Here Henry has married Dora and Sunako’s return creates a disruption in their lives and a turning point in hers.\n\nThis melodrama is finely presented and the cast convince in often emotional sequences. As Michael Koresky noted Shimizu frequently uses location filming and there are many fine exteriors in the film. The cosmopolitan air of the cities is captured; nearly all the characters wear western style clothes; the exception is Sunako when she becomes a bar hostess and dresses in a traditional kimono. The casting reinforces this sense: Oikawa Michiko was born to Christian parents, her film career was cut tragically short at the age of 29: both Innoue Ichiko (half-Dutch) and Egawa Ureo (partly of German descent)have something of an Eurasian look. And the motor cycle, the liners and the cars we see on a quayside, all betray strong western influences.\n\nThe mise en scène and the cinematography have numerous examples of Shimizu’s distinctive stylistic tropes. There are two fine tracking shots along the cars on the Yokohama quay where a ball is held. The use of dissolves to place and displace characters are really effective; frequently we see a shot of a character caught perhaps in a doorway; the following dissolve presents the same doorway with the character vanished. The most notable technique, and likely very rare for the period, occurs at the dramatic confrontation in the church; a series of jump cuts first ‘zoom’ in on a character then reverse out again. And later in the film a repeat series accompanies a moment of dramatic recognition.\n\nThe camera often places characters in doorways or through windows and with deep staging. And one memorable set where Sunako resides uses blocking of objects and bars to comment on the scene and the characters within. Props also become significant. In the home of Dora and Henry we see at one point a ball of wool which entangles characters; a little later the passing of a skein of wool comments on characters responses. Shimizu also uses cutaways to emphasise the emotional content of a scene. Thus, we watch a scene as someone dies and the several cutaway shots present an exterior with rain and a flower perched in a slot near the window of the room where they lie.\n\nThe titles and sub-titles of the print are distinctive. Titles that comment or provide information are in the Japanese equivalent of upper case: titles presenting dialogue use inverted commas with a capital and then all lower-case. The sub-titles in English follow this but without the inverted commas.\n\nShimizu’s films have parallels with those of Naruse Mikio, especially in the use of characters outside or excluded from respectable society. In Naruse the resolution is often downbeat, though with heroines determined to ‘soldier on’. Shimizu’s resolution tend to be more hopeful.\n\nNote, plot information.\n\nIn Japanese Girls at the Harbour the resolution is an example found in Michael Walker’s research and analysis’s of Endings in the Cinema (palgrave macmillan 2020). Under ‘Water – Ship and Boat Departures’, he notes,\n\n“At the end, Sunako asks Miura to throw his two remaining paintings of her into the harbour – which he does. The liner then leave, and much emphasis is given to the severing of the streamers connecting the passengers on the ship to the people on the key seeing them off. Only after the liner is sailing away do the film’s other couple, Dora and Henry, arrive. They join Harada, Sunako’s ex-pimp, who is still observing the liner; he tells them, a little mockingly, ‘they sent you their regards’. Their lateness is a reflection of their ambivalence towards Sunako, who at one point, jeopardised their marital happiness. After Harada has left, the couple continue to stand and observe the liner, but the film actually ends with images which stress the threshold and, in the distance, the departing liner: a shot from the beach, then shots from the quayside as torn streamers blow in the wind. The shots no longer include characters, and with each one the liner is further away; finally it is gone. The last shot is one of Miura’s painting of Sunako floating in the water.\n\nAlthough the emphasis here is on the ship’s departure itself, the final image carries another intimation. Sunako’s portrait floating in the harbour suggests that a part of her will remain in Japan. “\n\nThe sequence of shots take on added resonance as the film opens with a departing liner and the cutting of streamers from shop to quay. Sunako’s destination is not stated, and whilst she and Miura are on an ocean going liner she is still dressed in traditional Japanese garb. I should add that it is Henry, as much as Sunako, who threatens the marital order. He is one of those rather weak and ineffectual males often found in melodrama, where as Dora and Sunako are stronger characters.\n\nI have been fortunate to see this film twice on 35mm. Even on second viewing I was discovering fresh resonances among the characters and fresh stylistic tropes and the way they illuminate characters. I find this a genuine classic of Japanese film.\n\nSeven Seas and this film were accompanied on an electric piano by Matsumura Makia who received well deserved applause. She is a frequent accompanist for silent film around New York. She has a fine lyrical style. Her accompaniments contributed to both the emotions and the pleasures of these films.\n\nA number of actors and craft people turn up in several of the Shimizu films screened here. All were working at the Shochiku Studio in this period, so there is the familiarity and shared experience that one finds in a classical studio model. Clearly the studios long-running success over a century rests to a degree to the quality of its productions in these founding decades.\n\nThe films were accompanied by printed notes for each title available before the screenings and introduced by Choi Edo, Assistant Curator of Film at MOMI and Alexander Fee, the Film Programmer at the Japan Society. I have noted some of their comments alongside individual titles. Both provided helpful information and drew out some of the developing aspects of Shimizu’s early film career.\n\nThe Museum of the Moving Image is sited in the old Astoria Studio in Queens’ Borough. It has a permanent exhibitions on the production side of the industry and one dedicated to the work of Jim Henson. There are also frequent temporary exhibitions and a small book shop with some interesting titles. There are two film auditoriums; the larger Redstone, seats over 250 people and is a large airy space. The projection box, which look spacious can handle 16mm, 35mm and 70 mm prints, plus digital files; [Century JJ 35/70mm projectors and a Elmo LX-2200 for 16mm]. At weekend there are regular screenings of films, both contemporary and classic, including silent films. All, bar Forget Love for Now, of the retrospective prints were screened in Redstone auditorium. One of the practices I have found and enjoyed elsewhere in the USA is the audience expressing appreciation for the projectionists. So we applauded Carolyn Funk, who handled the sometimes delicate and worn prints very well. And Rebecca Fiore, Manager of Visitor Experience, kindly handled all our questions. The prints themselves mainly came from the National Film Archive of Japan; all provided with English sub-titles. The curators explained that the prints are not restorations but surviving ones at Shochiku, so they were limited to single screenings of each title. They are also destined for a further programme screening on the U.S. West Coast. Hopefully the studio will produce new prints and possibly proper restorations.\n\nI was able to discuss the films with my friend Bob Mastrangelo, who made some helpful observations. He contributes the annual obituary article for Sight and Sound. He remembered including a couple of the long-lived cast members in earlier years. The retrospective also included 35mm prints of sound films made at Shochiku. A second part of the retrospective is at the Japan Society venue and feature Shimizu’s post-war work including what is perhaps his most famous title, Children of the Beehive / Hachi no su no kodomotachi (1948, which I was fortunate to see at an edition of Il Cinema Ritrovato. A number of his surviving silent films were shown at the 2010 edition of Le Giornate de Cinema Muto. And the BFI South Bank had a major retrospective in 1988. I was really happy to have caught even some of these memorable films. If any titles by Shimizu happen near any readers I strongly recommend them. If one of the 35mm prints happens than they are very fortunate.\n\nQuotations from the English subtitles on prints.\n\nSources of material in the Film Programme Notes.\n\n“Hiroshi Shimizu: A Hero of His Time” by Alexander Jacoby on Senses of Cinema, July 2004.\n\nNotes on the now deleted Eclipse Criterion Box set by Michael Koresky, Travels with Hiroshi Shimizu, 2009.\n\n“Hiroshi Shimizu – Silent Master of the Japanese Ethos” by William M. Drew, Midnight Eye, April 15, 2004.\n\nI was able to see this film in a 35mm print at a Festival and then later at the Lincoln Centre in New York. It is a recognized classic: of German film: of gay movies: a predominately women production: and an early sound film. It is set in an oppressive girl’s school, dominated by traditional Prussian values, where female desire produces resistance and rebellion to authoritarian control.\n\nAt the start of the film young Manuela von Meinhardis (Hertha Thiele), 14 years old, is enrolled at the a boarding school for the daughters of aristocratic and generally wealthy military families. Apparently all the girl students and all the German teaching staff have surnames preceded by ‘von’ this was the traditional identification for the nobility. We do not learn the surnames of the manual staff but one can assume they do not enjoy the preposition ‘von’. The Headmistress (Emile Unda) is a repressive figure who aims to inculcate a traditional subservient role on the girls, as\n\n‘God willing … mothers of soldiers”.\n\nThe repressive regime is symbolized in many ways. For the majority of time the girls have to wear black and white striped dresses rather resembling prison dress, and black pinafores. Hair is short and plaited; the short hair is like the fashion of the 1920s, but any longer hair is pinned back in buns, even for the teachers. Manuela is first seen wearing a hat, but later her hair is shown as tied back in a loose lock; she soon has her hair pinned in a bun. Clothes from past students are re-used, so Manuela gets an ill-fitting dress. Intriguingly it includes a hidden heart symbol by the previous owner for a teacher, Fräulein von Bernburg. We learn that books bought in by students are banned; the volume that Manuela carries is not identified but an illustration on a page suggests melodrama, even the gothic. The regime is organised on military lines and the food is generally basic, rather as for infantry.\n\n“Prussians are raised on hunger.” [The Headmistress].\n\nThe milieu of the film is set in the opening. A bell chimes over a blank screen followed by a series of exterior shots of Prussian architecture, the sound of military bugles and then chiming bells. These types of images recur throughout the film, rather in the manner of the ‘pillow shots’ common in films by Ozu Yasujiro. We then see marching troops and there is a cut to a line of regimented girls, in the striped dresses, filing though a park.\n\nThere follows the interior in an office where Manuela’s aunt has bought the young girl. She is seen by a Fräulein von Kestern, who seems to be the assistant to the headmistress; we later see her bringing bills for signature to the head. Manuela stands by the window, possibly watching the line of girls marching by. We learn that her father is an officer whilst her mother died whilst she was young. The aunt stresses her sensitivity and emotionalism; and in an unexpected gesture Manuela offers a handshake to the surprised teacher.\n\nManuela is shown round by Marga (Ilse Winter), a young pupil who we find is both a teacher’s pet and generally supportive of the values of the school. Manuela finds out about the uniform and regimentation of the school., As the pair visits different areas the school building appears as a labyrinth of corridors, hallways and two stairwells; one reserved for staff and visitors, the other a high square structure frequently presented in a high angle shot looking down the stairwell and with guard rails on its sides. It runs to six levels but we only see two or three of these; dormitories, staff rooms, including that of the head: and the ground floor hall class rooms, dining rooms: with the kitchens seemingly in the basement.\n\nThe young women that Manuela meets clearly find the regime repressive; all come from a similar background with the double-barreled surnames including the ‘von’. One particular rebellious girl is Ilse (Ellen Schwanneke); when we first see her in a choir she is singing her invented words to what is likely actually a hymn. In the dormitory she shows Manuela her pin-ups on the back of her cupboard door, including a popular film star with ‘sex appeal’. Two other girls gaze with rapture at a photograph of an almost naked male. And a group the girls all express their admiration for what we discover is the one liberal teacher in the establishment, Fräulein von Bernburg (Dorothea Wieck); ‘The Golden One’.\n\nManuela is considered fortunate in being allocated to the dormitory under her care, where Ilse also sleeps. It is a sign of Ilse’s rebellious character that her bed is the only one that is not in line with the uniform layout. We see the nightly ritual where Bernburg stops at the bed of each girl and kisses her chastely on the forehead. Ilse, in the next bed to Manuela, grows in excitement as her turn approaches. And when it is Manuela, whose emotionalism is already apparent, the young girl throws her arms around Bernburg who kisses her, not on the forehead, but full on the lips.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Manuela develops a serious crush on Bernburg. The teacher tries to discourage this whilst also in other ways encouraging it; for example, by giving Manuela a slip to replace her own tattered garment. We see a class under the tutelage of von Bernburg. She asks Edelgard (Annemarie von Rochhausen), Manuela’s fellow student, to recite a verse from a German hymn;\n\n“Oh, that I had a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths …”\n\ntaken from a Passion hymn by a Lutheran theologian Johann Mentzer. Manuela is asked to continue it with the second verse, she becomes tongue-tied. Whilst the hymn is addressed to the deity the passionate words might express Manuela’s emotional desire for Bernburg. This scene includes one of two instances of a lap-dissolve between Bernburg and Manuela.\n\nMeanwhile there is a rebellious spirit among the girls, notably on the part of Ilse. She defies the rules by writing and smuggling a letter home complaining about the inadequate food. The letter comes back undelivered and Ilse is disciplined. At a teacher’s meeting it is apparent that Bernburg is the odd one out,\n\n“I want to be a friend of the girls”;\n\nespousing liberal views frowned on by the head, who is supported obsequiously by the other teachers.\n\nMatters come to a dramatic head when the school performs Schiller’s play Don Carlos as part of a celebration for the headmistresses’ birthday. Ilse, as punishment for her letter, is removed from her role as Domingo in the cast. Ilse packs to return home but von Bernburg persuades her to stay and watch the play.\n\nManuela, displaying acting talents, is cast as Don Carlos. The play is selected as a classic of German literature. This rather overlooks the play’s expression of liberal values and opposition to censorship. In fact, during refreshments for visiting guests one woman wonders if Schiller is\n\n‘sometimes rather free’.\n\nWe see three short scenes from the play The stand-in as Domingo tells Don Carlos,\n\n“Give us Freedom of thought.”\n\nThen Don Carlos faces the Queen, “your mother”: she is in fact his step-mother for whom he has unrequited love: Faced down he retires without expressing his passion. The performance apparently ends here rather than with the rebellion in Schiller’s original.\n\nThe play is a success warmly greeted by the audience of girl students, teachers and guests., including praise for that by Manuela. Von Bernburg tells her that she has the potential to become an actress. Later, Manuela asks Ilse about von Bernburg’s response during the play, to which Ilse responds\n\n“the way she looked at you, you can’t imagine…”\n\nWhilst the guests have tea with the Headmistress the girls are served a punch made in the kitchen. Most of the girls find it unpalatable but Manuela, high on emotion, drinks copious amounts and is soon drunk. She then declaims to the assembled girls, telling of von Bernburg’s present of an undergarment and ending,\n\n“ She loves me.”\n\nfollowed by\n\n“Long Live our beloved Fräulein von Bernburg.”\n\nThe last is heard by Fräulein von Kestern who comes to see what all the noise is about.\n\nThis leads to the final reckoning for Manuela and von Bernburg. Manuela’s is not expelled because of an unexpected visit by a Royal princess, [possibly a Grand Duchess], and the headmistresses desire to avoid a scandal. This event sees all the girls change their stripped dresses for long white ones. The girls plan to tell the princess of Manuela’s travails but their nerve fails them.\n\nThe headmistress calls von Bernburg to her office where there is a confrontation. Von Bernburg tells the headmistress\n\n“What you call sing, Headmistress, I call the spirit of love.”\n\nThe headmistresses response is that there can be\n\n“no more contact between you and her.”\n\nReturning to her room von Bernburg is met by distraught Manuela. Ignoring the headmistresses’ stricture she sends Manuela to her room. There she tells the girl that she is to be segregated in an isolation room and that she, will not be able to see her;\n\n“You’re not allowed to love me in that way.”\n\nManuela leaves; von Bernburg starts to follow her but is confronted by the Headmistress who tells her that\n\n“I will not permit revolutionary ideas …”\n\nand that von Bernburg will leave the school that day.\n\nThe distraught Manuela heads for the stairwell that connects the various floors for girls and staff.\n\nThis is a four-sided tower, six floors high, a stone or concrete structure with metal railings all the way up; it has a different and starker looks that the other parts of the building. . As Manuela climbs the stairs she recites the ‘Our Father’. Meanwhile, the other girls realise that she is missing and start to search for her. Soon they are running round the building, in and out of rooms; there is a growing hysteria as if Manuela’s heightened emotional state has affected the whole school. Manuela reaches near the top of the stairs, climbs over the railings and is clearly preparing to jump. A high angle shot down the stairwell shows girls on every landing. Her close friends, including Ilse and Edelgard, climb up and pull her back over the railings.\n\nThe headmistress arrives and asks,\n\n“Did everybody go mad?”\n\nTo which von Bernburg responds\n\n“The girls have prevented a tragedy.”\n\nManuela and her friends remain at the stop of the stairwell, the girls crowding down the staircase along with Miss von Bernburg. The headmistress turns and descends the stairs past the shocked girls and then walks slowly down the ground floor corridor in a reverse shot which ends with a fade-out to ‘The End’. There is an air of defeat in her manner. Yet it is not clear what will happen now to Manuela or whether von Bernburg will remain or leave the school. It seems likely that the hegemony exercised over the school girls will have been severely damaged.\n\nThe film presents a critical view of traditional education in Germany: of the Prussian values that remind influential in Weimar Germany, even after the changes following World War I: and celebrates a subversive set of relations between women. Manuela becomes a disruptive force in the authoritarian school: the absence of a mother means that she is more exposed to the dominant Prussian military masculine culture. She arrives in a school where there is already a groundswell of resistance both to the repressive culture and the mean-spirited provisions. The possibilities of resistance are embodied in the character of Ilse; when we first see her she is already, in a guarded manner, expressing rebellion. The girls are involved in half-expressed sensual relationships. This is apparent in the desire expressed over imagery of the absent males in the school. But it is also there visually in the shots of pairs of girls involved in physical contact and in references in their dialogue to ‘crushes’ both on other girl students and on the teacher von Bernburg.\n\nMiss von Bernburg is an ambiguous character; a point made in the first comment that Manuela hears from a fellow student Ilse,\n\n“You never know how to take her. First she throws you a terrible look. Then, all of a sudden, she is awfully nice. She is also a bit creepy.”\n\nHer first name is Elizabeth, only used once in the dialogue by the wardrobe mistress explaining a ‘heart’ symbol in the garment given to Manuela. In her official persona she combines an emphasis on discipline with a warmth towards the girls. In Manuela’s case she twice makes the point that their relationships is that between a teacher and a student. However, in her non-verbal responses she suggests something more. Isle describes her response whilst watching Manuela’s performance in the play. And twice in the film there is the use of an overlapping dissolve between a close-up of Manuela and of von Bernburg; a technique that suggests a powerful bond between the two women. Her rejoinder to the headmistress of ‘the spirit of love’ also suggests something of desire. Apparently the play had s similar ambiguous emphasis but that there were some productions which emphasised a maternal rather than a love relationship; clearly an attempt to tone down the subversive quality in the drama.\n\nThese characteristics in both the girl students and in the one liberal teacher are counterpointed by the headmistress and the subservient relationship with her by the other teachers. The headmistress emphasises traditional roles for the students and the other teachers appear to support this. There is also clearly a rivalry between von Bernburg and the other teachers which seems to relate to her greater effectiveness as a teacher and in her positive relationship with the students. It is interesting that the manual staff in the school, seamstress, nurse and kitchen maids do not seem to share the values of the teachers. At times their brief comments are caustic and in the case of Isle’s letter to home actually subverting the discipline of the school. There is a 1958 version of the play produced by France and West Germany. It appears to soften the subversion: the play performed is ‘Romeo and Juliet’, a less critical choice in the context of the school: and the plot synopsis suggests that it also softens the ending though including the attempted suicide.\n\nThe key influences on the film are the director Leontine Sagan and the writer of both play and film, Christa Winsloe. Sagan was a film actress and this was her first work as director. It seems that she bought a fairly co-operative approach to the production. Winsloe was assisted by another writer, Friedrich Dammann. Her play was titled Gestern und heute (‘Yesterday and Today’) (1930). she was known as a lesbian; and orientation that Sagan may have shared. Both women and Dammann left Germany after the ascent of the Nazi regime. However, the producer, Carl Froelich continued working in Germany right through the war and in the 1950s. Heitha Thiele, who played Manuela, also left in 1937. Dorothea Wieck did make some films abroad but continued living in Germany where she was married to a Baron reckoned to be influential in Nazi circles. All of these key characters contributed very effectively to the screen production.\n\nThe sets of the film were chosen by Sagan. Much of the film was shot in an actual boarding school though the impressive stairwell was found in a separate building. The actual geography of the school in the film is not that clear. There is a reception room on the ground floor off the hall where visitors are greeted. The Headmistress’s room is up the wide front staircase, presumably on the first floor. Oddly, in the final shot she does not appear to be going to her office, though it may be that the only access is the mains staircase. The classroom also appear to be on the ground floor. At least one dormitory is on the first floor, the others may be there or on other floors. The wardrobe is on the third floor and the hospital room may also be there. The rooms of the teachers seem to be on the fourth floor. What is on the fifth or sixth floor is not clear though the ‘isolation room’ is possibly up there. The square almost prison-like staircase appears a number of times, including the railings that line and surround it. At least one shot down the stairwell is used more than once, so it is not easy always to decide which floor is in use by the characters in this scene.\n\nThe opening credits only include Sagan, Winsloe’s play, Froelich and the lading cast members. The cinematography, by Reimar Kuntze and Franz Weimar. I would reckon that Kuntze was the main cinematographer; he had worked on [among other films] Walter Ruttman’s distinctive Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt / Berlin: Symphony of a Great City. The filming is sharp, using mainly frontal set-ups but also including many large close-ups. There are frequent pans and occasional tracking shots; the latter tending to track in on a character. The camera work also uses shadow very effectively. The dormitory scene where von Bernburg kisses the girls goodnight has a soft, romantic feel. But later we see Manuela visited by the headmistress and the shadow of bars falls across her. And there are the two distinctive lap dissolves of von Bernburg and Manuela.\n\nThe film was edited by the Oswald Hafenrichter, who later edited The Third Man (1949). The majority of scenes are brief and the film uses frequent intercutting between parallel settings and characters. Some of this is about plot; so there are cuts between the headmistress and von Kestern stressing economy to THE girls discussing food or the lack of it. Others highlight the operation of the school and its repressive qualities. So we see Ilse rehearsing a scene where her lines involve an intercepted letter which is cut to the scene where the Headmistress and von Kestern discover her secret letter. There is a stark scene when von Kestern confronts the girls after Manuela’s outburst. A close-up of von Kestern makes her look like one of Eisenstein’s villains whilst the reverse show shows the girls huddled against a wall. And there are an interesting selection of exterior shots. There is one shot of the girls outside the building on a Sunday afternoon. And there is the shot at the beginning when a shot of marching troops cuts to a line of marching girls in the school uniform. Preceding this has been a number of insert shots of architecture and statues with a Prussian and militaristic feel. This type of insert occurs twice later in the film, including a shot that precedes the girls being marched to prayers in the hall. These shots emphasise the dominant feel of conservative and militaristic values in the school.\n\nThe music is by Hanson Milde-Meissner, who had a long career in film. The music track includes trumpets and bells in the insert shots and both of these are repeated in the music that accompanies much of the action. At the end, as the Headmistress walks slowly down the corridor, w hear again a trumpet; this time with a melancholy air that resemble The Last Post.\n\nAll these contributions come together in a powerful and effective movie. It also offers a clear and subversive drama about sexual orientation and authoritarian control. The sexual element was something that occurred frequently in Weimar cinema. As early as 1919 a film entitled Anders al die Andern / Different from the Others dramatised the situation of homosexuals. However, the result was that new censorship laws were passed and the film was only allowed in specialised screenings; the Nazi later banned the film. A reconstructed version was screened as part of the Weimar Programme at the Berlinale. Subversive treatment of heterosexuality managed to pass censorship laws; notably in the 1929 Die Büchse der Pandora / Pandora’s Box.\n\nIn one way Mädchen in Uniform is a last example of Weimar’s liberal film output. And it was successful both in Germany and abroad. It did suffer from censorship. In Germany it was at first banned for young people, a revealing restriction. In 1932 there was a shorter cut version, but even this was banned by the Nazi. There was an initial ban when it was released in the USA but this was lifted. I have not found any indication that it was censored in Britain.\n\nThe quotations are from the English sub-titles in the BFI version of the 2018 digitised version from Deutsches Filminstitut & FilmmuseumThe original film was in early sound ratio, 1.20:1; not all video versions or stills are in this ratio.\n\nThe Hebden Bridge Picture House celebrated its centenary recently. It opened on July 8th 1921. Among the records still held is a listing of films screened in the early months of the venue. There are only the titles but in many cases, given the approximate time of release, it is possible to identify and fill out details. In the listing that follows I have been able to do this for almost all the films; a few remained unknown. In a couple of cases there were both British and US releases of the same name; however, US titles tended to arrive in Britain a year after their US release and thus can be distinguished from the British title. Most weeks two feature titles would be screened, likely in succession over the week.\n\nThe original release titles in this period were shot on nitrate film stock which was extremely flammable. There were a number of major incidents involving fatalities when the nitrate film stock caught fire. However, thousands of screenings did take place safely. Nowadays there are strict requirements for the screening of surviving nitrate film prints; so there are few opportunities to see such prints. Because of the silver involved in the stock,[which led to the pulping of many prints to extract this material], the prints have a luminous quality not completely reflected in safety print copies and not visible in digitised versions. The usual stock was also orthochromatic which required liberal use of certain colours of make-up. In the 1920s panchromatic film stock was introduced. This required much less use of make-up and a consequent change in appearance of characters. Alongside this was a move from acting which tended to a more apparent natural style, [i.e. less use of dramatic gesture].\n\nIn the teens and 1920s many film prints originating on black and white film stock were tinted and toned. There were also specialist stencil colouring techniques. And early examples of colour film were in use, notably in Britain was Kinechrome, an additive process where filters were used in the projection of black and white film stock. An earlier additive process Kinemacolor had fallen out of use. The first major subtractive process which actually produced a colour film print was Technicolor which developed from 1922 onwards. Whether a print was tinting or toned is often not recorded but even in 1922 this would have been a common practice.\n\nThe history of the Hebden Bridge Picture House includes a description of the opening screening of the new venue. The programme offered two feature length films. This was a change from the teens when the usual programme would have been a feature length film and a number of shorts, including newsreel, travelogues and short comedies. The listing that follows appears to mainly consist of several feature length titles, though the number vary in different weeks. It is not usually clear exactly what was in a particular programme and titles such as serials probably affected this. And in many week which was the ‘A’ feature is not necessarily clear. There would still have been shorter attractions including newsreels and, possibly, the growing number of animations. The genre of the serial very popular in the teens. These were usually screened weekly. The titles in the listing usually only appear once and in a couple of instances not as the overall serial title; presumably these were screened weekly in line with practice.\n\nThe opening screening was accompanied by a musical quartet: violin, flute, violin-cello and piano. It is likely that for the regular programmes that the music was usually a solo piano, perhaps with a quartet for special features. Large urban cinemas presenting a major release might occasionally employ an orchestra. But there would also have been screenings in this period when the films were projected silent, though that was less and less common.\n\nBritish film production in the early 1920s was increasingly suffering from the competition from burgeoning Hollywood studios. The general production values of British films were lower than those of the Hollywood studios and their box office performance was lower. Increasingly British producers had problems with distribution and booking of their titles. Some of the existing studios went into decline; new companies emerged but often only lasted for a few years. It was only in the late 1920s that British production picked up for a period with the introduction of the 1928 Film Act.\n\nDistribution was carried out by film ‘renting’ companies. Some of these were part of larger integrated companies: some were regional distributers: and some were part of major foreign companies. In the early days the French companies had been important, like Pathé. By the 1920s the growing US companies had British based renting firms; these were able to exert strong pressure on exhibitors because their product was so popular. And early example were the film of Charlie Chaplin in the teens where exhibitors need to sign up a for package of titles in order to screen those by Chaplin: this developed into a regular system known as block bookings. Increasingly in the 1920s British companies had problems getting contracts with rentals; a factor the demise of several studios.\n\nBy this date the British Board of Film Censors, set up by the Industry in 1912, was mainly effective in its certification; either U universal or A adults. The actual censorship control rested with local authorities under the acts for licensing entertainment venues. Even in the 1920s there were occasional films that ignored the BBFC certification.\n\nThe use of titles had appeared around 1900 and developed into the title card, which conveyed explanation: dialogue: and comment. there were also insert shots with printed information on such items as letters, telegrams, signs and even printed material like books. In the earlier films title cards often proceeded the action to explain what would be seen. By the 1920s title cards were inserted either side of particular actions. And some cards were ‘art’, often with producers’ logo apparent. The 1920s saw the move to limit the amount of title cards and rely more on visualisation. Britain was, as in other aspects, slow to realise this.\n\nI have used Rachel Low’s history of this decade in British film, the relevant volumes ‘The History of the British Film 1918 – 1929 (1971) : the British Film Institute’s Collection list of titles: The American Film Institute Catalogue: IMDB: and Wikipedia. Different sources have provided film length; either in feet or meters for reels, and running times. However one cannot be sure that this is the same as the version screened in Hebden Bridge where the speed or frame rate would have been determined by the projectionist. The production details and synopsis vary with titles and I include as much as I can. Information on tinting and colour vary, though in this period quite a proportion of films would have had either tinting or toning or some of the additive colouring systems; but not all prints available for screening would have had these benefits. None of the films at this period would have had soundtracks so they relied on title cards which would have been in English, even for most foreign language titles. Invariably films had musical accompaniment.\n\nWhere the company or people involved in a title are noteworthy, I have included information on them. What emerges is a portrait of what audiences could see in a provincial town in this period; this strikes me as of significant interest. Many of these titles are now lost. Tony Fletcher has advised me –\n\n“I viewed quite a few British films from 1921 which are held by the BFI: The Black Tulip: Jessica’s First Prayer: The Puppet Man: Ships That Pass in the Night ;Laughter and Tears; Tansy; and The Twelve Pound Look.”\n\nI have noted in the text where a surviving print of a title is recorded. The BFI Collections also lists other materials and reviews. However, many of the titles screened do not even appear in this archive record. The problem of lost titles is greater for British film than those from the USA. Generally it is reckoned that about a third of silent film production is lost but missing titles still re-appear and/or are restored. In the case of missing films it is often possible to elucidate the pilot from surviving distributor and newspaper descriptions. Several examples are found in these listings.\n\n“The Hebden Bridge Picture House is another rare 1920’s survivor.
