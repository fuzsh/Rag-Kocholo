        "text": "Directed by Teresa Lavina\n\nProduced by Teresa Lavina and Gavin Lennon\n\n‘Mincéir' is a very important and unique piece conveyed in the shape of a 55min documentary that will bring the audience onto a journey across the Irish traveller’s tradition their past traditions, present transitions and future views. It portrays how their culture has evolved through the collaborations of various members of the community from very different backgrounds.\n\nAbout Micéir\n\nThe challenge of this documentary is to balance an accurate portrayal of Traveller life seen through the eyes of travellers and the necessary story elements needed to produce a great documentary and keep an audience engaged throughout. ‘Mincéir’ contributors tell intimate secrets and stories about the Traveller traditions that have never been told before. The project will be an archive of information for future generations to access and this is a very important point for the Travellers mental health. The documentary is driven by progressive, modern Traveller women and men that are a precedent for their community. It highlights how strong women are and have fought to follow their passions and become independent.\n\nThe documentary shows how the community’s resilience, adaptation skills and strength have carried them from being nomads to be settled. These members of the Traveller community share their passion for their culture, their art and how their uncomplicated means of living have made their tradition survive with very little records aside of word of mouth, singing and story telling. The Irish traveller community have a very important imprint in Irish history with a story to tell that evolved parallel to the settled community, a community that has endured a lot of harm caused by discrimination. It is very important to allow their stories to be told from their perspective without being colonised by a settled community voice and reach an international audience. ‘Mincéir’ will allow to carry their true stories not only to an Irish audience but also to an international one.\n\nThe content includes the contributions of many influential members of the Traveller community and groups which have helped highlighting their needs and give a voice to the voiceless. People and groups that have fought for years for Traveller rights, health and a better means of living.\n\nAs part of the documentary we filmed a traditional wagon maker. This is a rare and very valuable contribution. We also filmed the oldest matchmaker alive as well as the last two tinsmiths left in the community, they kindly share their memories with the audience.\n\nThe film explores the craft of tin smithing and paper flower making, biddy pockets, tent making and music. We talk to healers and singers, actors and writers, ordinary members of the community, match makers and bread makers giving a full insight of the Traveller community.\n\nAll these wonderful contributors will bring us to their bases in their picturesque locations across Ireland.\n\nThe documentary is delivered in English. ‘Mincéir’ brings together a diverse production team that will deliver this content being consistent with the very core of the piece, traveller well-being through art and cultures working together to create a top class 55 minute cultural stand alone documentary.\n\n​\n\nScreenings:\n\n​\n\nSeminci - 67th edition Valladolid (Spain) - Time in History Section\n\nDIFF - Dublin International Film Festival - Official Selection"
