        "text": "AEW Rampage\n\nDate: August 2, 2024\n\nLocation: Bon Secours Wellness Arena, Greenville, South Carolina\n\nCommentators: Excalibur, Tony Schiavone, Matt Menard\n\nWe are now officially less than a month away from All In and that means the show’s card has already started coming together. Most of the bigger matches are either set or have been teased and there is a good chance of moving things forward this week. If nothing else, we should be in for solid action, as tends to be the case around here. Let’s get to it.\n\nOpening sequence.\n\nWheeler Yuta vs. The Butcher\n\nBryan Danielson is on commentary. Feeling out process to start until Yuta strikes away as Danielson is right there to explain the idea behind what Yuta is doing. Butcher shoulders him down to take over and a backdrop keeps Yuta in trouble. Back up and Yuta manages to send him outside for the suicide dive, only to be knocked out of the air back inside. Butcher plants him down and we take a break.\n\nWe come back with Yuta hitting a high crossbody as Danielson talks about wanting to face Jeff Jarrett on Dynamite. A flying forearm drops Butcher and a German suplex gives Yuta two. Butcher backbreakers his way out of a Kimura and grabs a sitout powerbomb for two of his own. Yuta fights up and sends him shoulder-first into the buckle, setting up the up-and-down elbows. Cattle Mutilation of all things finishes Butcher at 10:39.\n\nRating: C+. This is one of those ideas that will always work as you have the smaller Yuta fighting the scary-looking monster in Butcher. It was made even better by having Danielson there to push the idea, which he can do rather well. They didn’t reinvent the wheel here, but they didn’t have to as they made a simple idea work well.\n\nThe MxM Collection are only addicted to shampooing and conditioning and the only shots they take are beauty shots.\n\nBrian Cage vs. Manny Lo\n\nCage grabs a suplex to start, followed by posing and Weapon X for the pin at 1:01.\n\nWe look at Kyle Fletcher yelling at MJF to set up their match on Dynamite.\n\nFletcher is cut off by Don Callis before Brian Cage comes in. Cage vs. Fletcher is set for Collision. That will be three straight nights of Cage wrestling (counting Ring Of Honor), which seems a bit excessive.\n\nNyla Rose vs. Harley Cameron\n\nCameron says this is for Saraya (who isn’t here). For some reason, Cameron tries to go straight after Rose, who just glares at her. A kick to the back of Rose’s head only makes her mad, with Cameron being sent outside for a baseball slide. Cameron manages to send her into the barricade to take over, followed by some boot choking back inside.\n\nWe take a break and come back with Rose grabbing a backbreaker and elbowing her down for two. Cameron gets in a shot of her own but misses the Cannonball. A knee to the head gives Cameron two, followed by a Bronco Buster. That doesn’t work for Rose, who sits up with a Beast Bomb for the pin at 8:58.\n\nRating: C+. This was Cameron hammering away on the much bigger monster to limited avail. At the end of the day, Rose basically treated her like a fly and smashed her to wrap things up. I could go for more of more of Rose in almost any kind of role and if that means having a more competitive-than-expected match with Cameron, so I’ll be glad with what I’m getting.\n\nPrivate Party is ready for the MxM Collection but doesn’t seem to be taking them seriously.\n\nBryan Keith vs. Jackson Drake\n\nThe rest of the Learning Tree is here as Keith strikes away to send him into the corner. Keith ties him in the Tree of Woe and stomps away, allowing Big Bill to get in some choking from the floor. A suplex into a running kick to the chest sets up Diamond Dust to finish for Keith at 3:10.\n\nRating: C. I can only get so annoyed at anyone who uses Diamond Dust, which is still one of the coolest-looking moves anywhere. This was a quick way to build Keith up a bit, especially after his hiatus due to the injury. The Learning Tree needs something to do and I’m not sure what that is at the moment.\n\nKatsuyori Shibata is ready to hurt Bryan Keith to even the score.\n\nThe Kingdom is ready for FTR.\n\nPrivate Party vs. MxM Collection\n\nMansoor and Isiah Kassidy start things off with the latter being taken down for a walk over his back. Back up and they argue over how serious this is before flipping to a standoff. Mansoor gets dropkicked out to the floor and it’s off to Mason to power Kassidy into the corner. Everything breaks down Mansoor gets double flapjacked down to the floor as we take a break.\n\nBack with Kassidy faceplanting Mansoor, setting up a neckbreaker/ for two with Mason making the save. Mason gets kicked down but manages to power both of them over with a double suplex. An exchange of strikes leaves everyone down for a breather. Mason is sent outside, where he catches Kassidy’s dive with a swinging Boss Man Slam. Back in and Mason chokeslams Quen off the top, setting up an assisted double arm inverted DDT for the pin at 12:02.\n\nRating: C+. So far the Collection has been getting to showcase a few different sides of themselves, with the promos being much more goofy while the matches themselves are more on the serious side. It’s a mixture that is working so far and they are certainly getting television time. We’ll have to see where it goes, but it could be a far worse start.\n\nResults\n\nWheeler Yuta b. The Butcher – Cattle Mutilation\n\nBrian Cage b. Manny Lo – Weapon X\n\nNyla Rose b. Harley Cameron – Beast Bomb\n\nBryan Keith b. Jackson Drake via\n\nMxM Collection b. Private Party – Assisted double arm inverted DDT to Quen"
