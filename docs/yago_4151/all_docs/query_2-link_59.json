        "text": "Vogue World: London was a hard event to top—the Supers! Annie Lennox! A pregnant Sienna Miller in baby-bump-revealing Schiaparelli!—but prepare yourself, because this year’s edition is taking place in arguably the most iconic fashion city in the world: Paris.\n\nFind everything you need to know about Vogue World: Paris below, including where the event will take place, which fashion and arts luminaries will be working behind the scenes, how sports will be braided in, and—most—importantly how you can watch.\n\nWhen is Vogue World: Paris?\n\nVogue World: Paris took place on Sunday, June 23, 2024.\n\nWhere will Vogue World: Paris be held?\n\nThe famed Place Vendôme—a fashionista-favorite square of Paris that has served as everything from a global hub for fine jewelry to the inspiration for a Catherine Deneuve film—hosted Vogue World this June.\n\nHow can I buy tickets for Vogue World: Paris?\n\nTickets to Vogue World are sold out. For inquiries, please email paris@vogueworld.com.\n\nIf I can’t make it to France, how can I watch Vogue World: Paris from home?\n\nYou can rewatch the Vogue World: Paris livestream if you missed the live event, and revisit the best moments from Vogue World 2024 here.\n\nDoes the Vogue World: Paris livestream have a host?\n\nYes! Model and actor Cara Delevingne was on the air during Vogue World, talking viewers through the event.\n\nWho else is helping to bring Vogue World: Paris to life?\n\nCarine Roitfeld, Ib Kamara, Juan Costa Paz, and Palais Galliera curator Alexandre Samson helmed this year’s fashion events at Vogue World: Paris, with Dame Pat McGrath returned to lead makeup design and world-renowned dancer (and Rihanna Super Bowl halftime show choreographer!) Parris Goebel oversaw artistic direction and choreography. The globally broadcast livestream was directed for the third time by Sam Wrench, who is perhaps best known for his work on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. Among the special guests were also be Ciara, Maluma, Sabrina Carpenter, Emma Chamberlain, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, Serena and Venus Williams, Bad Bunny, and Aya Nakumura. See all of the celebrity cameos from Vogue World 2024 here.\n\nWhat else about the event has been announced?\n\nThis year’s edition of Vogue World has been conceived in collaboration with youth athletic academies from throughout France, pairing different sports—cycling, gymnastics, tennis, fencing, and breaking, among others—with a decade in French fashion, going back to the 1920s.\n\nThe show’s fashions will foreground French designers both contemporary and historic, as well as houses that traditionally show their collections in Paris. There are also rumored to be numerous surprise live performances in the works—including from Bad Bunny and Aya Nakamura—though you’ll have to tune in for more details.\n\nHow will Vogue World: Paris differ from previous versions of the event?\n\n“If Vogue World: New York was a street fair, and Vogue World: London was a glamorous night at the theater—supporting arts and cultural organizations in London—Paris will be a kind of opening ceremony; one that celebrates 100 years of fashion and sport, as well as this extraordinary city,\" said Vogue Global Editorial Director and Condé Nast Chief Content Officer Anna Wintour at a press conference in February. She was joined at the Place Vendôme’s famous Ritz Paris by designers Simon Porte Jacquemus, Olivier Rousteing, Marine Serre, and Pharrell Williams, as well as by Executive President of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode Bruno Pavlovsky and a number of French athletes, including fencer Enzo Lefort.\n\nWhich local organizations is Vogue World: Paris working with?\n\nA portion of the net proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to the humanitarian organization Secours Populaire, which help facilitates access to essential equipment for young, aspiring athletes across France."
