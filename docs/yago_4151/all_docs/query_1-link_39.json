        "text": "This major archive film festival is a fine opportunity to catch many, and often rare, films from the early years of cinema. And quite a number of these films are screened in copies close to the originals, on 35mm safety film stock. One important factor is the l’imagina ritrovato film restoration and conservation centre.\n\nThese can be found on the Ritrovato web pages under The Time Machine section.\n\nA Major strand is Century of Cinema: 1904, curated by Mariann Lewinsky and Karl Wratschko. In previous years they have provided some fine examples with screenings full of discovery, interest and pleasure. This year promises to be as fine.\n\nThere are nine sessions during the week. These include films presented by travelling showmen in the years before the widespread arrival of dedicated venues: actualities offering outdoor pursuits and the world around audiences: films of fantasy and the fantastic: cinegraphic newspapers: tours and travelogues: the arrival of electricity: and that special delight, early clowns.\n\nThe screenings offer both black and white films and films with early colour systems. Intertitles are not that common but usually have English sub-titles. And there is live music, mostly on the piano, by a team of fine accomplished musicians, with real skill in adding to the image.\n\nA particular favourite is the screening in the Piazzetta Pier Paulo Pasolini on the Sunday evening where the prints are run through a 1950s carbon arc projector. This is always crowded for the delights of the special image quality.\n\nA second strand is One Hundred Years Ago: 1924, curated by Oliver Hanley. This strand has been described as a “travel agency, organising excursions into the past”. This has sixteen sessions through the week.\n\nOn the opening Saturday, in the newly restored Modernissimo Cinema, there are three classics from this year. Max Linder’s Au Secours! working with Abel Gance: Kino-Pravda No. 18 from Dziga Vertov and the Factory of Facts: and the avant-garde Ballet Mécanique by Dudley Murphy and Man Ray, with colour inserts in the print. These are original version prints, so without English sub-titles.\n\nOther sessions offer a Harold Lloyd feature, Hot Water: the two parts of the Gösta Berlings Saga: the Italian Quo Vadis – Parte 1 and 2, involving Gabriellino d’Annunzio: F. W. Murnau’s seminal Der Letze Mann: Victor Seastrom’s [Sjöström anglicized] He who Gets Slapped with Lon Chaney. And there are other films that I have not seen before, both from Europe and the USA, including a second Piazzetta screening on the Wednesday.\n\nAnd there are two silent features in the Piazza Maggiore in the evening. On the Thursday there is My Cousin, a USA feature from 1918, with an original score composed by Daniele Furlati and performed by the ensemble of Teatro Comunale di Modena: plus Chaplin’s The Adventurer from 1917.\n\nOn the Thursday there will be s screening of Victor Seastrom’s The Wind from 1928. The film features a fine performance by Lillian Gish. The screening is from a digital restoration by MOMA in New York. The accompaniment will use the score by Carl Davis adapted and directed by Timothy Brock, performed by Orchestra del Conservatorio G.B. Martini.\n\nIn the Documents and Documentaries section there is a feature by Wim Wenders which includes the early years of German cinema and in particular invention of the Bioskop (the machine by which the Skladanowsky brothers managed to capture moving images) together with the programme of nine shorts (lasting roughly 15 minutes) presented to the public in Berlin’s Wintergarten on 1 November 1885 – prior to the first Lumière screening in Paris. This will be in the Damslab on Friday.\n\nAnd there titles from the silent era in Cinephiles Heaven. These will be found in the programmes dedicated to Marlene Dietrich, Café elecktric (1927) and Die Frau, nach der man sicht sehnt (1929)"
