        "text": "A friend recommended a Quebec television series on Netflix called Au Secours de Beatrice (Saving Beatrice) about an emergency room doctor in her forties who begins to experience some rather mysterious health symptoms and turns to a therapist for help in uncovering their cause.\n\nI am enjoying the show for three reasons.\n\n1. Many of the episodes deal with real issues that make you think.\n\nThere’s a storyline about an extremely qualified doctor from Haiti who ends up initially working in the emergency department as a security guard because his foreign qualifications as a medical professional aren’t recognized in Canada.\n\nThere’s another storyline about a young boy who lives in Beatrice’s apartment building who is dealing with OCD(Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and we see how OCD impacts his life.\n\nA storyline that spans quite a few episodes shows Beatrice torn about whether to report a mother who is a drug addict and whose behaviour Beatrice feels is endangering her teen age daughter’s life. Should she breach patient confidentiality to help the daughter?\n\nThere’s a storyline about the competition between private and public health care.\n\nAnd then of course there is the whole issue of doctor shortages and doctor’s being overworked that Dr. Jillian Horton addressed in her popular book We Are All Perfectly Fine.\n\n2. About a quarter to a third of each episode shows Beatrice with her therapist talking about the issues in her life and in particular how her life has been influenced by her childhood.\n\nI have never been to therapy so the show provides for me a fascinating look at how one can view things from different angles and with renewed perspective after discussing it with a professional therapist.\n\nIt makes me wonder if that kind of introspective analysis of one’s life could be helpful and meaningful for me.\n\n3. The acting on the show is stellar and I am enjoying the story arcs of the various characters. It makes the series a nice little get away for me when I’m too tired to do writing work or need a little break from household chores.\n\nSaving Beatrice is a Canadian drama filmed in Montreal in French with English subtitles.\n\nThere are four seasons each with some 24 episodes. I am only on Season 2 and I’m not binge watching so Au Secours de Beatrice should provide me with engaging entertainment for quite a while yet.\n\nOther posts…………\n\nWould You Want Your Child to Be A Doctor?\n\nAn Extraordinary Netflix Series"
