Harry Piel and Gerard Bourgeois directed the film. Gaillant is the artist for the poster. The crime film, also referred to by the title Face Ã  la mort, was released in France in October 1925.\n\nThe poster measures 23.5\" x 31.75\" and is in good to very good condition. It has never been folded since being printed for display in 1925. The poster has minor creasing, areas of paper loss on the left and lower right borders and two small tears at the bottom edge of the poster.\n\nPlease look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.\n\nThis very rare and collectible poster, printed in 1925 to promote the French theatrical release of Au Secours, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
