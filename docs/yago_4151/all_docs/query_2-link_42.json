The film shows the band's creative process in the studio. Of course, there will be creative differences & disagreements. Its not like they were insulting each other in public. Imagine the rooftop concert expanded & remastered! Plus, there must be so many other good out-takes they can include. Paul has given the o.k. Is Yoko the one holding this up?\n\nyankeefan7:\n\nJoeySmith:\n\nI still dont get it. The film shows the band's creative process in the studio.

I truly doubt if you did this same type of movie with any band there would not be disagreements and moments of nastiness. I did not know the rooftop concert was longer so any additional l footage would be cool. In a way, I am kind of surprised they did not try to release movie again when they released \"Let It Be Naked\"."
