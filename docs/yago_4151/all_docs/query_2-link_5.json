        "text": "It took me a couple of months to finally decide to sit down and watch this movie, but it's a pity I didn't go for it before. I like French humor, and this was really a good piece of it! Although the original setting is sad - one of the main actors gets cancer -, but it is played in a funny way that only French do. It remembered me to the style of the Luis de Funes or the Belmondo series. Probably the character I liked the most was the idiot husband of Tara with the cat but I also loved the aging 'artist' starring the commercial. So I enjoyed most parts of the movie, funny dialogs and funny scenes, and the few minutes of trivial conversations are forgivable. I guess this movie is a best choice if you want to practice some recent everyday French language and want to keep your mood happy, like for people in a class of French as a foreign language."
