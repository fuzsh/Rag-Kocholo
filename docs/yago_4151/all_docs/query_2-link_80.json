        "text": "We know the silent canon quite well: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and German Expressionism, Battleship Potemkin and Soviet montage films, The Lodger and Hitchcock’s first films. The European Silent Cinema Project moves beyond these well-known silent European films to delve deeper into the continent’s four decades of silent cinema. Charting a course through the development of film thousands of miles away from Hollywood, we’ll discover lesser-known films from silent cinema giants like France, Germany, and Sweden and explore under-the-radar filmmakers, national silent cinemas, and genres.\n\nStarting with the world’s first publically projected moving pictures in 1895 and ending with the transition to talkies in 1930, I will review two European silent films each year. For the first few years, especially in the 1890s, I will discuss each year’s two chosen films in a single entry. When I reach 1910, I will start reviewing one feature and one short in separate posts to better highlight short films which are often sadly not given the attention they deserve.\n\nThe following list includes all films I have reviewed (with links to that blog post) and those that I plan on reviewing next. Films listed for future review are subject to change based on personal taste, the availability of the films, and possible suggestions from readers."
