        "text": "Deadline: 25 Jun 2024\n\n…..\n\nThe Pare Lorentz Documentary Fund supports feature-length documentary films that reflect the spirit and nature of Pare Lorentz’s work, exhibiting objective research, artful storytelling, strong visual style, artistic writing, and outstanding music composition, as well as skillful direction, camerawork, and editing.\n\nThe Pare Lorentz Documentary Fund began in 2011, making it the International Documentary Association’s oldest fund, and has granted $1,285,000 to 69 projects. Starting in 2023, the Fund began accepting Immersive Nonfiction projects as part of the Pare Lorentz slate. Now, the Fund accepts applications from all over the world.\n\nThe fund provides production and post-production grants to be used in the creation of original, independent documentary films that illuminate urgent issues. Noteworthy Pare Lorentz grantees include Black Mothers, Not Going Quietly, Hummingbirds, After Sherman, and Crip Camp. A complete list of Pare Lorentz grantees can be found in the Grantee Database.\n\nProjects must focus on one or more of Pare Lorentz’s central concerns—environmental issues, justice for all, or the illumination of pressing social problems. The 2024 theme is Gender Justice and will be part of the IDA open call in May.\n\nFunding Information\n\nThey will select three projects, and each will be awarded a grant of $25,000 USD.\n\nThe official grant period of concentrated support is one year from the date of the grant award. Filmmakers are strongly encouraged to use their grant funds within that first year. The project will continue to receive bespoke IDA support after the first granting year until the film is complete. The team is expected to send an annual report and updated budget until the project is complete.\n\nSupported Activities\n\nEligible projects will be in the production stage, having completed the bulk of research and development but still having substantial production or post-production-related work and expenses remaining. Grant funds may be used for production and post-production related expenses incurred during the period of support.\n\nExpenses may include line items such as principal photography, travel, equipment purchase or rental, insurance, rights and clearances, editing, and crew salaries. The fund does not support expenses related to fundraising, distribution, publicity, marketing, or outreach.\n\nBoth 2-D and Immersive Nonfiction visual projects are eligible to apply for the Pare Lorentz grant.\n\nProject Eligibility\n\nThe project must address the theme of Gender Justice.\n\nThe film budget must not exceed $700,000 USD.\n\nThe project must focus on one of Pare Lorentz’s central concerns—environmental issues, justice for all, or the illumination of pressing social problems.\n\nThe project must be in production or post-production, having completed the bulk of research and development but still having substantial production and post-production-related work and expenses remaining.\n\nAccess to major film participants must be secured.\n\nThe film must be intended to reach a large and broad audience. A broadcast or distribution commitment is not required.\n\nStories must be original, relevant to contemporary audiences, and of an urgent or critically important nature. Purely historical films will only be considered if they have a significant contemporary component or narrative.\n\nNot eligible to apply: Biographies, branded content, student films, completed films, films that are purely historical, and short documentaries (under 40 minutes finished run time).\n\nEligibility Criteria"
