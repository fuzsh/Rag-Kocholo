        "text": "Beginnings in the 17th century\n\nThough there may have been published material similar to a magazine in antiquity, especially perhaps in China, the magazine as it is now known began only after the invention of printing in the West. It had its roots in the spate of pamphlets, broadsides, ballads, chapbooks, and almanacs that printing made possible. Much of the energy that went into these gradually became channeled into publications that appeared regularly and collected a variety of material designed to appeal to particular interests. The magazine thus came to occupy the large middle ground, incapable of sharp definition, between the book and the newspaper.\n\nThe earliest magazine appears to have been the German Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen (1663–68; “Edifying Monthly Discussions”), started by Johann Rist, a theologian and poet of Hamburg. Soon after there appeared a group of learned periodicals: the Journal des Sçavans (later Journal des Savants; 1665), started in France by the author Denis de Sallo; the Philosophical Transactions (1665) of the Royal Society in England; and the Giornale de’ letterati (1668), published in Italy and issued by the scholar and ecclesiastic Francesco Nazzari. A similar journal was started in Germany a little later, the Acta eruditorum Lipsiensium (Leipzig; 1682); and mention may also be made of the exile-French Nouvelles de la République des Lettres (1684), published by the philosopher Pierre Bayle mainly in Holland to escape censorship. These sprang from the revival of learning, the need to review its fruits, and the wish to diffuse its spirit as widely as possible.\n\nThe learned journals summarized important new books, but there were as yet no literary reviews. Book advertisements, by about 1650 a regular feature of the newssheets, sometimes had brief comments added, and regular catalogs began to appear, such as the English quarterly Mercurius librarius, or A Catalogue of Books (1668–70). But in the 17th century the only periodicals devoted to books were short-lived: the Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious (1682–83), which offered some critical notes on books, and the Universal Historical Bibliothèque (January–March 1686). The latter invited scholarly contributions and could thus be regarded as the true forerunner of the literary review.\n\nThe lighter type of magazine, or “periodical of amusement,” may be dated from 1672, which saw the first appearance of Le Mercure Galant (renamed Mercure de France in 1714). It was founded by the writer Jean Donneau de Vizé and contained court news, anecdotes, and short pieces of verse—a recipe that was to prove endlessly popular and become widely imitated. This was followed in 1688 by a German periodical with an unwieldy title but one that well expressed the intention behind many a subsequent magazine: “Entertaining and Serious, Rational and Unsophisticated Ideas on All Kinds of Agreeable and Useful Books and Subjects.” It was issued in Leipzig by the jurist Christian Thomasius, who made a point of encouraging women readers. England was next in the field, with a penny weekly, the Athenian Gazette (better known later as the Athenian Mercury; 1690–97), run by a London publisher, John Dunton, to resolve “all the most Nice and Curious Questions.” Soon after came the Gentleman’s Journal (1692–94), started by the French-born Peter Anthony Motteux, with a monthly blend of news, prose, and poetry. In 1693, after devoting some experimental numbers of the Athenian Mercury to “the Fair Sex,” Dunton brought out the first magazine specifically for women, the Ladies’ Mercury. Finally, another note, taken up time and again later, was struck by The London Spy (1698–1700), issued by a tavern keeper, Ned Ward, and containing a running narrative of the sights and sounds of London.\n\nDevelopments in the 18th century\n\nGreat Britain\n\nWith increasing literacy—especially among women—and a quickening interest in new ideas, the magazine filled out and became better established. In Britain, three early “essay periodicals” had enormous influence: Daniel Defoe’s The Review (1704–13; thrice weekly); Sir Richard Steele’s The Tatler (1709–11; thrice weekly), to which Joseph Addison soon contributed; and Addison and Steele’s The Spectator (1711–12, briefly revived in 1714; daily). Though they resembled newspapers in the frequency of their appearance, they were more like magazines in content. The Review introduced the opinion-forming political article on domestic and foreign affairs, while the cultivated essays of The Tatler and The Spectator, designed “to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality,” did much to shape the manners and taste of the age. The latter had countless imitators not only in Britain, where there were in addition the Female Tatler (1709–10) and the Female Spectator (1744–46), but also on the Continent and later in America. The Stamp Tax of 1712 had a damping effect, as intended, but magazines proved endlessly resilient, easy to start and easy to fail, then as now.\n\nSo far various themes had been tried out; they were first brought together convincingly by the English printer Edward Cave, who began to publish The Gentleman’s Magazine in 1731. It was originally a monthly collection of essays and articles culled from elsewhere, hence the term magazine—the first use of the word in this context. Cave was joined in 1738 by Dr. Johnson, who was later to publish his own Rambler (1750–52); thereafter The Gentleman’s Magazine contained mostly original matter, including parliamentary reports. Rivals and imitators quickly followed, notably the London Magazine (1732–85) and the Scots Magazine (1739–1817; to 1826 published as the Edinburgh Magazine); and, among the increasing number of women’s periodicals, there were a Ladies’ Magazine (1749–53) and a Lady’s Magazine (1770–1832). Their progenitor, however, outlived them all and perished only in 1907.\n\nThe literary and political rivalries of the day produced numerous short-lived periodicals, from which the critical review emerged as an established form. Robert Dodsley, a London publisher, started the Museum (1746–47), devoted mainly to books, and Ralph Griffiths, a Nonconformist bookseller, founded The Monthly Review (1749–1845), which had the novelist and poet Oliver Goldsmith as a contributor. To oppose the latter on behalf of the Tories and the Church of England, The Critical Review (1756–1817) was started by an Edinburgh printer, Archibald Hamilton, with the novelist Tobias Smollett as its first editor. Book reviews tended to be long and fulsome, with copious quotations; a more astringent note came in only with the founding of the Edinburgh Review in 1802 (see below).\n\nContinental Europe\n\nOn the Continent development was similar but was hampered by censorship. French magazines containing new ideas had to appear in exile, such as the philosopher Pierre Bayle’s Nouvelles de la République des Lettres, which was published largely in Holland; some 30 titles were published in Holland up to the time of the French Revolution. Within France, there were the short-lived Spectateur Français (1722–23) and Spectateur Suisse (1723); and Le Pour et le Contre (1733–40; “For and Against”), issued by the Abbé Prévost (author of Manon Lescaut). Of more literary interest were the Gazette Littéraire de l’Europe (1764–84) and La Décade Philosophique, Littéraire et Politique (1794–1804).\n\nIn Leipzig the poet and philosopher Johann Christoph Gottsched issued a periodical for women, Die vernünftigen Tadlerinnen (1725–26; “The Rational Woman-Critics”), and the first German literary review, Beiträge zur kritischen Historie der deutschen Sprache (1732–44; “Contributions to the History of the German Language”). German literary movements were connected with the production of new magazines to a greater extent than in Britain. Examples of such vehicles include Friedrich von Schiller’s Horen (1795–97) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s Propyläen (1798–1800), the influence of which was often greater than their duration. Of more general and lasting influence was the Allgemeine Literatur-zeitung (1785–1849), founded by Friedrich Justin Bertuch, “the father of the German periodical.”\n\nThe first Russian periodical, published by the Academy of Sciences, was a learned journal called “Monthly Works” (1755–64). The first privately published Russian magazine, a critical periodical with essays and translations from the British Spectator, was called “Industrious Bee” and began in 1759. Catherine II used her Vsiakaia Vsiachina (1769–70), also modeled on the Spectator, to attack opponents, among them Nikolay Novikov, whose “Drone” (1769–70) and “Windbag” (1770) were suspended and whose “Painter” (1770–72) escaped only by being dedicated to the Empress.\n\nAmerica\n\nIn America the first magazines were published in 1741. In that year appeared Andrew Bradford’s American Magazine, the first publication of its kind in the colonies. It was joined, a mere three days later, by Benjamin Franklin’s General Magazine. Both magazines appeared in Philadelphia; neither lasted very long, however—Bradford’s magazine survived only three months and Franklin’s six. Franklin was more widely known for another of his publications, Poor Richard’s Almanack (1732–57), which contained maxims and proverbs. Before the end of the 18th century, some 100 magazines had appeared, offering miscellaneous entertainment, uplift, or information, mostly on a very shaky, local, and brief basis. Among the more important were, in Philadelphia, the Pennsylvania Magazine (1775–76), edited by Thomas Paine, and the American Museum (1787–92) of the bookseller Mathew Carey; the Massachusetts Magazine (1789–96), published in Boston; and the New-York (City) Magazine (1790–97)."
