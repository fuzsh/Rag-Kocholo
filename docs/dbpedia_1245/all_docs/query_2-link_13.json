        "text": "Benson was born on 3 August 1773 in New York to Stutson Benson and Bathsheba Lewis. Benjamin was living in Pompey, New York, by 1795; his brother Peter moved there in 1793. Benjamin married Keziah Messenger in 1795 and moved to Indiana by 1820. Benjamin joined the church in Indiana in 1832 and sold his land in Indiana in October of that year. By 1837 he appears to have moved his family to Missouri.

He also may have seen forts built during the French and Indian War, some of which were constructed on the ruins of American Indian villages. The forts described by Benson also may have had connections to other indigenous people. Contemporary accounts identified several mounds in western New York and associated these mounds and their fortifications with an ancient moundbuilding people.

Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1986.\n\nThe theory of polygenism, or different origins for different races, emerged in European scholarly thought in the sixteenth century. As Europeans encountered new cultures and races, polygenism attempted to explain their origins. Discussions of this theory were particularly widespread in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as Enlightenment thought led to the development of racial science and the categorization and ranking of different races. Some scholars tried to make the Bible compatible with polygenism, creating theories of multiple or simultaneous creations besides the creation of Adam. Polygenism and its underlying racial concerns are found throughout nineteenth-century popular and religious literature. For many nineteenth-century Christians, the theory was a direct challenge to Christianity’s single biblical creation and the religious requirement of redemption after the fall of Adam and Eve. JS, like other Christians of his day, emphasized the single creation found in the Bible and humanity’s common descent from Adam and Eve.
