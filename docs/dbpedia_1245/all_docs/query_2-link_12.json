The original collection was acquired by the Library of Congress through the generous gift of Woodbury Blair, Minna Blair Richey, Gist Blair, and Montgomery Blair in 1903, with additional acquisitions from 1901 to present.\n\nThis web presentation is a portal to the materials contained in the Jackson Papers collection only, not to all documents by, about, or related to Jackson in the Manuscript Division. The Manuscript Division holds many additional Jackson and Jackson-related documents located in the collections of other individuals, including Jackson's friends and/or colleagues Willie Blount, Amos Kendall, and Francis P. Blair and the Blair family. Additional Jackson-related resources can be found in other presidential papers collections, including the papers of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk.\n\nAbout the Collection\n\nThe Andrew Jackson Papers collection documents Jackson's life in its several phases, including Jackson's military career in the War of 1812, the Creek War, and Florida; his transactions as a land-holder and Tennessee businessman; his personal and family life, including correspondence with his wife, Rachel Jackson, and other family members and wards associated with the Hermitage; and his controversies with associates and strangers, which sometimes came to confrontation. Prominent is documentation related to his complex two-term presidency, during which the nation debated issues of nullification, tariff rates, banking procedures, Indian policy, public improvements, and the relative power and sovereignty of the individual states in the Union in relation to the federal government. The collection also contains information on military orders and court martial proceedings, diplomatic and Indian treaty negotiations, and the experiences and/or opinions of those Jackson led in battle, collaborated with or opposed in politics, or trusted as cabinet members, allies and friends.\n\nNotable correspondents represented in the Andrew Jackson Papers include Francis Preston Blair, Willie Blount, John C. Calhoun, William C. C. Claiborne, John Coffee, Andrew Jackson Donelson, John Henry Eaton, Andrew Jackson Jr., Rachel Donelson Jackson, Amos Kendall, Henry Lee, James Monroe, Franklin Pierce, James K. Polk, John Randolph, John C. Rives, John Ross, John Sevier, Roger Brooke Taney, and Levi Woodbury.
