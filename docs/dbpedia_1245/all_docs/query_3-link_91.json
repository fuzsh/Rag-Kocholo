        "text": "Did you know that when you are researching your family history you can get invaluable information from birth, marriage, civil partnership and death certificates? The General Register Office for England and Wales (GRO) holds records for all births, marriages, civil partnerships, and deaths registered in England and Wales from 1 July 1837, and can help you in your search. (Civil partnerships are available from 5th December 2005)\n\nThis booklet tells you about:\n\nThe General Register Office for England and Wales, what its role is and which records it can offer you\n\nThe information you will find on civil registration records\n\nThe information you will need to order civil registration records\n\nIt will give you an introduction to how the General Register Office can help.\n\nFor more details please go to Research your family history using the General Register Office.\n\nWhere should I start my search?\n\nWhen you are starting to research your family history, gather together family memories, photos and documents and you may be able to quickly develop an understanding of the last couple of generations. To find out more detailed information, birth, marriage, civil partnership and death certificates are an invaluable material. They provide links back to the previous generation by giving details of a relative’s address, occupation or cause of death. Certificates will also give clues about the individual’s parents or husband/ wife.\n\nHow can GRO help?\n\nPeople come to the GRO because it has the records of every birth, marriage civil partnership and death registered in England and Wales available in one place. Some commercial organisations also offer a service to get certificates for you, but these organisations apply to the GRO or the local registration service on your behalf. It is therefore cheaper and quicker to order direct.\n\nGRO also holds overseas records containing details of births, marriages, civil partnerships and deaths of British citizens that have taken place abroad since the late 18th century. These include those registered with British Consuls, High Commissions, HM Forces, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen. It is not compulsory to register every birth, marriage, civil partnership or death that occurs overseas and GRO is not automatically notified of every event that has taken place.\n\nWhat services does GRO provide?\n\nThe GRO can provide you with birth, marriage, civil partnership and death certificates covering England and Wales from 1 July 1837 onwards (civil partnerships are available from 5th December 2005). If you use the standard service, the certificate will be dispatched from GRO on the fourth working day (if the GRO index reference number is provided).\n\nIf you use the priority service, the certificate will be dispatched from GRO on or before the next working day (if the order is received before 4pm, excluding weekends and Bank Holidays).\n\nThere is also a Portable Document Format (PDF) service covering England and Wales for birth registration records from 1837 to 100 years ago and for deaths from 1837 to 1957. Additionally, we have launched an Online View digital image service for birth registration records from 1837 to 100 years ago and for deaths from 1837 to 1887.\n\nThe online service is the cheapest and simplest way of placing an order.\n\nLocal parish records contain details of baptisms, marriages and burials. You will usually find parish registers at the local County Record Office or through various websites where registers have been digitised.\n\nIt may also be worth checking the GRO regimental records if there was a connection to the British Army.\n\nWhat information will I find on a birth, marriage or death certificate?\n\nAs well as the full names of the individuals, you will find the following information:\n\nBirth certificate\n\nIncludes date and place of birth, the name and residence of the mother (and sometimes the mother’s maiden name). The name and occupation of the father is also shown on the certificate. See Annex A on pages 18 and 19 for an example certificate.\n\nMarriage certificate\n\nIncludes the full names each party to the marriage. It will usually include their occupations, residences and the date and place of the marriage and, in addition, the names and occupations of the fathers of both party, if the marriage took place before 4 May 2021. See Annex B on pages 20 and 21 for an example certificate.\n\nCivil Partnership certificate\n\nIncludes the full names each party to the civil partnership. It will usually include their occupations, residences and the date and place of the civil partnership and, in addition, the names and occupations of the mother and father of each party, if the civil partnership was formed before 4 May 2021. Where the civil partnership was formed on or after 4 May 2021, the name and occupations of the mother, father or parents of both each party will be included.\n\nDeath certificate\n\nIncludes the date of death, age, occupation, final residence and cause of death, as well as the name and relationship of the person who acted as the informant. See Annex C on pages 22 and 23 for an example certificate.\n\nWhat is the difference between a short and a full birth certificate?\n\nA short certificate is an extract of the full record and only shows the name and surname, date of birth, place of birth and sex of the child.\n\nThe GRO Index Reference\n\nIt is cheaper to order certificates online and provide a GRO index reference although you can also apply by telephone or post.\n\nThe GRO index reference provides unique reference information that helps find the birth, marriage, civil partnership or death in England and Wales that you are interested in. It includes:\n\nthe year when the birth, marriage, civil partnership or death was registered\n\nthe quarter (for example Oct-Dec is the December quarter, Jan-March is the March quarter) when it was registered\n\nthe earliest index is for September quarter 1837. After 1984 the indexes are organised by year only\n\nthe district in which the event was registered\n\nthe volume and page number\n\nThe entries within the indexes are arranged in alphabetical order by surname, with first names listed alongside (as recorded on the certificate). The full index data varies depending on the type of event (birth, marriage, civil partnership or death) and the year when the event was registered.\n\nWhere can I find a GRO index reference?\n\nThe GRO provides a public index that lists basic details of every birth, marriage, civil partnership and death recorded in England and Wales since 1837. If you provide details of the index reference number, it will be cheaper for you and also help speed up your application.\n\nThe historical birth and death index - births over 100 years old and deaths up to 1957 (those records that have been digitised) are available to search free of charge on the GRO website.\n\nYou can also visit FreeBMD which contains a transcription of the index from 1837 to 1983.\n\nFind further information on researching GRO index reference numbers.\n\nAlternatively a complete set of GRO Indexes is available in microfiche format to view free of charge at:\n\nBridgend Local and Family History Centre\n\nCity of Westminster Archives Centre\n\nManchester Central Library\n\nNewcastle City Library\n\nPlymouth Central Library\n\nThe British Library\n\nThe Library of Birmingham\n\nYou are advised to check opening times and availability with the libraries directly before making any travel arrangements.\n\nSome public libraries and other organisations such as family history societies, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints family history centres or local record offices hold partial sets of the GRO Indexes on microfiche or CD ROM.\n\nA number of organisations make the index available online and you can use these to find the index reference that you need. Most web sites that offer access to these records will make a charge for this service.\n\nThe GRO index reference isn’t clear. Can the GRO help?\n\nYes. If you can’t decipher part of an index reference number you can use the GRO’s unclear “microfiche service”. GRO will provide clarification of the index reference number. You can contact the GRO by:\n\nEmail\n\nunclearfiche@gro.gov.uk\n\nPhone\n\n+44 (0) 300 123 1837\n\nMonday to Friday 8am-6pm\n\nSaturday: 9am-1pm\n\nPost\n\nThe aim is to reply within one working day of receipt of your request and the service is free. This service clarifies the reference number for you but won’t confirm that it is the entry you are looking for.\n\nHow can I order a certificate?\n\nOnline\n\nThe cheapest and quickest way to order a certificate is to go to www.gov.uk/bmdcertificates and then follow the link to order certificates online.

In addition, some events may have taken place outside of England and Wales. An important factor to remember when searching is that there could be some variations in the spelling of names, as many people could not read or write and the registrar would have to interpret spellings.\n\nBirths\n\nThe child may have been registered under a forename/surname other than that by which he/she was known in later life\n\nThe child could have been registered before the parents had chosen a forename, in which case, the entry in the indexes would be at the end of the listing for the surname under female/male\n\nThe child could have been born in a period other than that searched\n\nWiden the search for the place of birth – the child may have been born in a different location as births must be registered in the district they occurred\n\nAges on census records and marriage certificates should be treated with caution. No proof of age was required and often people did not actually know their own age\n\nMarriages\n\nMarriages sometimes took place after the birth of the first child – therefore widening the timescale searched may help\n\nOne party may have been married more than once, and used a different name – try checking previous surnames, or the name of the other party to the marriage.\n\nHistorically, couples may have continued to live together as man and wife as divorce was rarer. Also, some couples may never have married, or did not remarry after their spouse died.\n\nDeaths\n\nWiden the timescale that the death occurred as it could have been registered some time after the event i.e. if an inquest was involved\n\nWiden the search for the place of death – the person may have died in a different location to where they actually lived (deaths must be registered in the district they occurred)\n\nIn a very small minority of cases, deaths would be registered without a name i.e. if there was nobody to identify a body. These are listed as ‘unknown’ in the indexes and appear at the end of each quarter\n\nScotland\n\nTel: +44 (0) 131 314 4411\n\nWebsite: www.nrscotland.gov.uk\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nTel: 0300 200 7890 from the UK or +44(0)2891 513101 from outside the UK\n\nWebsite: www.nidirect.gov.uk\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\nThe Registrar General for events outside Dublin and at non-Catholic Churches Government House in Dublin:\n\nTel: +353 (0) 1671 1000\n\nFor events in the greater Dublin area: Tel: +353 (0) 906 632 900\n\nTel: +353 (0) 1671 1929/1968/1974\n\nWebsite: www.groireland.ie\n\nIsle of Man – Civil Registry\n\nThe registration of births and deaths was compulsory from 1878 onwards, and the registration of marriages was obligatory from 1884, although records go back to 1849 for non-Anglican births.\n\nTel: +44 (0) 1624 687 039\n\nJersey – General Registry\n\nHolds births, marriages and deaths from 1842.\n\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 441335\n\nGuernsey – Register Office\n\nHolds births and deaths from October 1840, non-Anglican marriages from States Offices January 1841 and Anglican marriages from 1919.\n\nTel: +44 (0) 1481 725 277\n\nBirth certificate help sheet\n\n(for births registered before 1 April 1969)\n\nThe columns on the birth certificate show, from left to right:\n\n1.

Entry number in the death register and when the person died.\n\n2. Name and surname: This is the name used at time of death, which is not always the same name given at birth.\n\n3. Sex of the deceased.\n\n4. Age: The informant gives the deceased’s age at the time of death to the best of their knowledge and belief; therefore it is possible that this may not be accurate.\n\n5.
