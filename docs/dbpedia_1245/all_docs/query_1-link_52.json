        "text": "Q: Just finished watching the IMSA race from Road America with its lengthy commercials and full course yellows. Any guess how much time/laps of the total race time were under yellow?\n\nTo my complaint: With about 12 minutes left and following a restart after a lengthy yellow, we had an almost three-minute commercial break, returning to race with about eight minutes left. So with all the previous lengthy yellows and with the tight racing resuming at the end, why? Who determines to go to a three-minute commercial break?\n\nVery poor timing by whoever made the decision.\n\nPeter, Phoenix, AZ\n\nMP: According to IMSA’s timing and scoring, the 2h40m race had: Green: 1h17m33s (6) Yellow: 1h23m12s (5). Race broadcasters are the ones who choose when to go to commercial.\n\nQ: With the numbers of entries every IMSA class has now, and more to come in 2025/2026, is it time to go back to Camel GT days and split GTP/LMP, and GTD PRO/GTD into two separate races? Maybe on separate days?\n\nMark, Springfield, OH\n\nMP: I’ve been hoping for GTP/LMP2 to reach a total car count that would warrant using the split prototype/GT race format I loved at the sprint races back in the day. But I also know that unlike 30-plus years ago when it last happened, easy TV options to show a feature-length GT race at 2h40m and then a second feature 2h40m broadcast for GTP/P2 is highly unlikely.\n\nAnd yes, one could be aired on Peacock, but manufacturers and sponsors don’t pay to have feature races routed to streaming anymore than necessary, so there’s that.\n\nQ: Do you know when we can expect a public announcement on Honda’s future intentions in IndyCar?\n\nJoe\n\nMP: They’re signed through 2026. I’d expect something by summer of 2025 on its future intent.\n\nQ: I thought I would write in this week with multiple questions. First, have any sponsor deals for the teams come out of the Thermal Club connection? Second, GM is moving its headquarters from the Renaissance Center to the new Detroit Hudson Tower. Does this mean IndyCar will be abandoning the current terrible track they’ve raced on the last two years?\n\nThree, instead of doing a doubleheader at Iowa, which is super-hard on the teams, why not do two races at Mid-Ohio or Road America? If I still lived in Ohio I would definitely go to see two IndyCar races. They could schedule one for early summer and maybe the second one as the season finale.\n\nFourth, why does IndyCar not race at Road Atlanta? I’ve seen the huge safety improvements they’ve done over the last several years. If the super-fast IMSA prototypes can race there, why can’t IndyCar?\n\nFinally, why is it being implied that Firestone is responsible for improving the racing at Iowa? Iowa is a NASCAR-owned track where they only did a partial repave, which definitely affected the IndyCar race having more than one groove.\n\nRick Schneider, Charlotte, NC\n\nMP: Not that I know of with Thermal. The Detroit race isn’t tied to where GM executives work each day. A Road America doubleheader would be the most popular weekend of the year, outside of the Indy 500.\n\nI’ve crawled over Road Atlanta for decades, including last October, and I can’t think of where the huge recent safety improvements you reference are found. Fully-enclosed prototypes and GT cars are just that, fully enclosed, and not smaller and less sturdy open-wheel cars. Those four tires are the only thing that connect race cars to the circuits they race on. If the tires aren’t a match for the surface and don’t make for good racing for whatever reason, changes need to be made.\n\nQ: Will the IndyCar Series introducing the full-throwback paint scheme race weekend for all competitors in the future like NASCAR Cup and Xfinity did at Darlington?\n\nTherius Oktavario, Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia\n\nMP: It’s been suggested many times by many people, but I’m not aware of it being in the works for next year.\n\nQ: There is a picture of a 1991 GTP Spice in last week’s Mailbag. Its rear tires are completely covered. How were its tires changed? It seems like the tire covers would slow the pit stops.\n\nKyle\n\nMP: Tom Walkinshaw Racing wasn’t the first to use the rear-wheel slats, but TWR popularized it when they came over in 1988 and some of the other marques gave then covers a try. Yes, removing and reinstalling them added some extra time; there were sliding latches that held them in place, but pit stops weren’t crazy-fast since big fuel tanks needed to be refilled.\n\nQ: Whatever happened to the Canadian presence in IndyCar? The home fans had nobody to cheer on! From the pioneers like Billy Foster and Eldon Rasmussen to the golden age of the Villeneuves, Tracy, Goodyear, Tagliani, Carpentier and Greg Moore, the Maple Leaf was prominent on the grid. Claude Bourbonnais, Marty Roth and Andrew Ranger all added in their own ways to Canada’s IndyCar legacy as well.\n\nBut now? Hinch is in exile in the commentary booth; Robert Wickens, due to circumstances beyond his control, is being an absolute hero elsewhere, and Scott Hargrove had the talent but not the dollars to back it up in Indy Lights a few years back. This is when you truly appreciate how much money Player’s and Molson poured into racing in the 1990s. Unless Devlin DeFrancesco rocks up with another suitcase full of money, is Lance Stroll the best Canada has to offer? To be fair to Lance, he’s now graduated to the dreaded “journeyman pro” status.\n\nAre there any promising young Canuks trying to claw their way up the ranks to look out for, or has the domestic stock car series killed Canada’s IndyCar participation off?\n\nPeter Kerr, Hamilton, Scotland\n\nMP: Hinch has been trying to help nudge young Mac Clark along, and then there’s Nico Christodoulou. Both are in the USF Championships, and that’s as close as it gets in open-wheel. In IMSA, there’s a bunch of supremely talented Canadians like Parker Thompson, Roman De Angelis, Zach Robichon, Mikael Grenier and OG Daniel Morad.\n\nBut yes, there are no Greg Moore or David Empringham types on the way up who’ve left no doubt that they have the talent to go to the top.\n\nQ: I keep reading that IndyCar went hybrid because manufacturers use racing to sell cars, and their passenger cars use hybrid technology. For me, the huge disconnect is that hybrid cars, for the most part, are very boring fuel economy appliances that have nothing in common with a race car.\n\nHonda passenger car hybrids are slow and lack power compared to just a few years ago when they offered the J series in the Accord. Long gone are the high-revving VTEC V6s, replaced with the whirl of electric motors. I’m not sure how racing sells economy appliances. Honda’s one performance car, the Civic Type R, is a turbo four-cylinder non-hybrid. Am I missing something? Honda won’t put a hybrid in its own performance car, so why would it want to put a hybrid in an IndyCar?\n\nI know this is just anecdotal but we just bought a new car. And specifically bought a car from a manufacturer that didn’t even offer a hybrid choice for us. We opted for the upgraded turbo for our new car, the exact opposite of a hybrid. We test drove Hondas new hybrids and it’s just not for us. If IndyCar hybrids are an exercise in marketing passenger cars, it missed the mark with us. If auto racing really sold passenger cars, you’d think Tesla would be in Formula E.\n\nIndyCar hybrids are a bunch of something for nothing. All that money and research should have been put in the next gen chassis/engine combo. Not hybrid gobbledygook.\n\nPatrick\n\nMP: So the 100-plus years of racing being used by manufacturers to sell cars, a reality that isn’t up for debate, is erased because Tesla isn’t in Formula E? C’mon, man."
