Here, you’ll find unique board books, beautiful picture books, laugh-out-loud chapter books, the New York Times Best-Selling Who HQ series, Mad Libs, and Penguin’s award-winning leveled reader program.\n\nWe make readers laugh. We make readers feel accomplished. We make readers.\n\nFrancesco Sedita is the publisher of Penguin Workshop, where he works with an incredible team of people. Together, they make lots of things. Things like books of all shapes and sizes, from the sweetest of board books and pictures books like Jessica Hische’s Tomorrow I’ll Be Brave to Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors. And series like Johnny Marciano and Emily Chenoweth’s Klawde, about an evil alien warlord cat who really is just looking for a friend on planet Earth. And beautiful middle-grade like She Loves You (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) by the incomparable Ann Hood.\n\nFrancesco and the Workshop team also make the bestselling Who HQ series—and even made the Emmy Award winning and hilarious The Who Was? Show on Netflix.\n\nAs VP & Publisher, Grosset & Dunlap, Brands & Licenses, Daniel oversees both Art and Design, and Licensing Acquisitions for the group. He collaborates on the development of more than 250 books a year, including Penguin Young Readers Licenses, Mad Libs, The World of Eric Carle, Grosset & Dunlap, and the New York Times Best-Selling series, Who Was?\n\nDaniel has spent the last thirty in children’s publishing and entertainment products. He has worked for some of the leaders in books and television, including Scholastic, Disney, Nickelodeon, and Simon & Schuster. Daniel loves to work collaboratively to create new and innovative experiences for children.\n\nCecily Kaiser joined Penguin in 2019 with a mission to create engaging, empowering, and elegant books for babies, toddlers, and preschoolers. She has previously worked with major contributors to this category such as Norman Bridwell, Caroline Jayne Church, Barney Saltzberg, Jean Jullien, Leslie Patricelli, Chris Raschka, and Lotta Nieminen, and looks forward to continuing to publish groundbreaking talent for the youngest readers.\n\nCecily was previously the Children’s Publisher at Phaidon Press, and prior to that, launched the Appleseed imprint for 0-5 year olds at Abrams Books. She began her career almost 20 years ago at Scholastic, first as a Book Clubs manager, and then as Editorial Director of the Cartwheel imprint for 0-6 year olds. Cecily earned a degree in child development at Tufts University and a Masters in Business from NYU.

Together, they share music, books, plants, chocolate & snuggles.\n\nRenee Kelly is an Executive Editor acquiring early readers, picture books, chapter books, and select middle grade.\n\nShe’s drawn to diverse, dynamic voices and seeks stories that focus on friendship, humor, and the nuances of growing up. She hopes to see more narratives that explore neurodivergence, gender identity, and social justice. Above all, she aspires to publish books that are inspiring, inclusive, and entertaining.\n\nRenee earned her BA in English at Rutgers University with a brief stint abroad at University College London. She adores animals, including her constant companion, a miniature poodle named Buddy.\n\nBrian Clark earned his MA degree in Children’s Media/TV Writing & Gender Studies from NYU, his BA in English at the University of Miami and is a former member of the Groundlings Sunday Company Improv/Comedy Troupe.

Brian and the rest of the writing team received an Emmy nomination for their work on The Who Was? Show on Netflix (based on the highly successful Penguin Random House book series). Brian loves Mad Libs because he loves comedy and part of speech equally! Well, almost equally!\n\nElizabeth Lee is a senior editor dedicated to showcasing and uplifting marginalized voices, particularly in stories that push storytelling boundaries and center around joy, hope, and healing. She primarily acquires contemporary and light fantasy middle grade and young adult fiction and graphic novels, as well as the select, lyrical picture book.

These include The Comeback, The Queens of New York (YALSA and NYPL Best YA Fiction Book of the Year), and Maybe It’s a Sign.\n\nAlex Wolfe is an associate editor who works on picture books, middle grade, graphic novels, and everything in between. She is particularly passionate about fiction that emphasizes humor, strong female characters, distinctive artwork, joyful stories, and anything weird, whimsical, and absurd! When not editing, you can usually find her listening to a comedy podcast, watching musical theater, or drinking copious amounts of coffee.\n\nTyiana is an assistant editor who works on picture books, leveled readers, middle grade titles and YA. She has a specific interest in character-driven narratives that focus on telling various stories of people of color, with an emphasis on Black fantasy tales, Black contemporary and romance works and historical fiction projects.
