        "text": "1607: John Harvard, the College’s future namesake and first benefactor, was baptized at St. Saviour’s Church (now Southwark Cathedral), London.\n\n1635: John Harvard received his M.A. from Cambridge University, England.\n\n1636: First College in American colonies founded. The “Great and General Court of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England” approves £400 for the establishment of “a schoale or colledge” later to be called “Harvard.”\n\n1637: The Great and General Court orders the “colledge” established one year earlier to be located at Newetowne (renamed “Cambrige” in 1638).\n\n1764: Original Harvard Hall burns, destroying some 5,000 volumes and all but one of John Harvard’s books.\n\n1775: Continental soldiers are quartered in Harvard buildings.\n\n1776: Eight Harvard alumni sign the Declaration of Independence.\n\n1780: The Massachusetts Constitution went into effect and officially recognized Harvard as a university. The first medical instruction given to Harvard students in 1781 and the founding of the Medical School in 1782 made it a university in fact as well as name.\n\n1781: Oldest continuous chapter of Phi Beta Kappa formed at Harvard.\n\n1782: Twenty-nine-year-old John Warren was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at the Medical School. During the previous year while head of the army hospital in Boston, he had given Harvard students their first formal medical instruction. Benjamin Waterhouse was named to a second Medical School professorship, in the “Theory and Practice of Physic.”\n\n1783: With high ceremony, Harvard Medical School officially opened as the “Medical Institution of Harvard University.” Its first home was the ever-versatile Holden Chapel.\n\n1787: John Quincy Adams, future U.S. president, graduates.\n\n1791: A writer in the Boston press accused Harvard of poisoning students’ minds with Edward Gibbon’s monumental “History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (1776-88). President Joseph Willard replied that far from even considering Gibbon, the College used a text by French historian Abbé Millot. Nathaniel Ames, who left Harvard around 1812, recalled Millot’s as “the most utterly worthless and contemptible work of that kind or any other extant.”\n\n1845: Rutherford B. Hayes, future U.S. president, graduates from the Law School.\n\n1846: John Collins Warren, Medical School professor, conducts first public demonstration of ether as surgical anesthetic.\n\n1847: Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific School is founded with a $50,000 gift from Abbott Lawrence, a Massachusetts captain of industry, marking the beginning of the university’s formal programs in engineering and applied sciences.\n\n1849: Dr. George Parkman disappeared at the Medical School in one of the most famous murder cases in Harvard history. Earlier, Parkman had lent money to colleague Dr. John White Webster. To secure the loan, Webster gave Parkman a mortgage on his personal property, including a valuable collection of minerals. When Parkman learned that Webster had backed another loan with the same collection, he began relentlessly pursuing Webster to collect the debt. A week after the disappearance, a suspicious janitor broke through a brick vault below Webster’s lab and found human body parts, which the authorities soon discovered all around the lab. Found guilty of first-degree murder, Webster belatedly confessed and appealed for clemency, but was hanged on Aug. 30, 1850. Parkman’s widow led a fund drive to support Webster’s wife and children.\n\n1852: Harvard wins first intercollegiate sports event, a boat race against Yale on Lake Winnipesaukee.\n\n1855: Holworthy Hall gets first gas lights in the Yard.\n\n1862: The Overseers confirmed the Rev. Thomas Hill, Class of 1843, as Harvard’s 20th President. His brief tenure brought higher admissions standards, a series of public “University Lectures” (est. 1863) by distinguished Harvard and non-Harvard scholars that paved the way for the “Graduate School of Arts and Sciences” and University Extension, and progress toward a system of elective courses. Hill also conducted nationwide searches for new faculty appointees.\n\n1865: Election of Overseers placed in the hands of alumni, severing legal ties with the Commonwealth.\n\n1867: The Harvard Dental School made its first appointments: Daniel Harwood, professor of dental pathology and therapeutics; and Nathan Cooley Keep, professor of mechanical dentistry.\n\n1869: At the meetinghouse of First Church, Unitarian, Charles William Eliot was formally installed as Harvard’s 21st President. From the outset, Eliot’s 105-minute address delineated his broad educational purposes: “The endless controversies whether language, philosophy, mathematics, or science supplies the best mental training, whether general education should be chiefly literary or chiefly scientific, have no practical lesson for us to-day. This University recognizes no real antagonism between literature and science, and consents to no such narrow alternatives as mathematics or classics, science or metaphysics. We would have them all, and at their best.”\n\n1870: The Rev. Phillips Brooks laid the cornerstone of Memorial Hall.\n\n1872: Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is founded.\n\n1872: Arnold Arboretum is established.\n\n1873: Charles Sprague Sargent officially began a 54-year term as first director of the Arnold Arboretum. Sargent soon enlisted the aid of pioneering landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted – then busy designing the Boston park system – to help him lay out the grounds. “Olmsted immediately grasped the idea that an arboretum where the public could see varied plantations of rare and exotic trees and shrubs skilfully [sic] selected, artistically arranged, and grown under scientific oversight, would not only be an appropriate feature in the park system [now known as Boston’s “Emerald Necklace”] but might well become its culminating attraction,” Benjamin Lincoln Robinson, the Asa Gray Professor of Systematic Botany, wrote in the late 1920s. Nonetheless, the Arboretum proved a hard sell, Robinson noted. “Neither the City [of Boston] nor the Harvard Corporation welcomed the idea. The press was indifferent, and the public apathetic. Nine years of persistent effort were required before it was possible to draft a plan of procedure acceptable both to the City and to the University and to secure its approval by the General Court of Massachusetts.”\n\n1874: Department of Fine Arts is established.\n\n1901: First course offered in landscape architecture and city planning.\n\n1903: Franklin D. Roosevelt elected president of the Harvard Crimson.\n\n1903: Country’s first concrete football stadium is built.\n\n1904: FDR graduates.\n\n1908: With 59 students, the Graduate School of Business Administration formally opened as a Graduate Department of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Through this initial connection to established departments, President Eliot and Dean Edwin Francis Gay hoped to get the newcomer off to a well-supported start. Other U.S. universities began offering business training as early as 1886, but the course of study was overwhelmingly undergraduate. In seeking to establish business as a profession, Harvard Business School became the country’s first business program limited to college graduates. By the end of the first academic year, the School had 80 students from 14 colleges and 12 states.\n\n1909: Abbott Lawrence Lowell begins his 24-year presidency.\n\n1910: President Lowell establishes Commission on Extension Courses, now the Harvard Extension School.\n\n1910: Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, served as the 34th president of the Harvard Alumni Association (est. 1840).\n\n1913: School of Public Health is established.\n\n1913: Harvard University Press is established.\n\n1914: Professor Theodore William Richards wins Nobel Prize in Chemistry for determination of atomic weights; he is the first of 50 Harvard Nobel laureates.\n\n1914: Henry Cabot Lodge, Class of 1871, served as the 38th president of the Harvard Alumni Association (est. 1840).\n\n2012: MIT and Harvard announce edX.\n\n2012: Harvard announces plans to renew the University’s 12 undergraduate houses.\n\n2012: Harvard releases first University-wide Sustainability Impact Report.\n\n2013: President Drew Faust launches a $6.5 billion Harvard Campaign, the largest ever in higher education.\n\n2013: Financial aid increases by $10M, bringing the total to a record $182 million.\n\n2014: Kenneth Griffin ’89 makes $150 million gift to Harvard College, principally focused on supporting Harvard’s financial aid program.\n\n2014: A $350 million gift comes from The Morningside Foundation, established by the family of the late T.H. Chan. The gift renames the Harvard School of Public Health to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n2015: John A. Paulson, M.B.A. ’80 made the largest gift in the University’s history, a $400 million endowment to support the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). The School is renamed the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.\n\n2018: Harvard’s redesigned Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center officially opens as a “front door” for University visitors.\n\n2019: A years-long effort by dozens of researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics reveals the first-ever image of a supermassive black hole.\n\n2019: Professor Michael Kremer is awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on world poverty and Professor William G. Kaelin is awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on anemia.\n\n2020: Harvard University announces the suspension in-person classes and shift to online learning in an effort to combat the spread of COVID-19.\n\n2021: The newly completed Science and Engineering Complex in Harvard’s Allston campus welcomes students en masse for the first time.\n\n2022: Harvard President Larry Bacow releases the Report of the Committee on Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery, accepting the committee’s recommendations in full, and announcing a historic commitment of $100 million to fund their implementation."
