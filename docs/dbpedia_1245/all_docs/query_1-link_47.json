        "text": "Data from the World Bank shows that paid leave for early childcare varies a lot around the world.\n\nThe chart shows several key differences. In some countries, like India, only mothers get paid leave. In France, fathers also get paid leave. Parents in Russia can partially share the leave.\n\nThere are also differences in the purpose of the leave. In countries like South Africa, it’s for childbirth. In others, like the United States, it’s for childcare in the months after birth. In countries like China, paid leave covers both childbirth and early childcare.\n\nThe length of paid leave differs immensely, too. In Egypt, for example, only 90 days are available, while in Japan, parents have a combined total of 800 days.\n\nWhat’s not shown in the chart is how much money parents receive. This also varies a lot between countries.\n\nThese differences in government support affect young families’ finances, how childcare is shared, and how much time newborns spend with their parents.\n\nExplore this data over time and for more countries →\n\nThere are two ways to produce seafood: catch fish in the wild or farm your own. Seafood farming is often called “aquaculture”. Aquaculture is dominated by the farming of fish, but also includes other organisms, such as crustaceans and aquatic plants.\n\nAquaculture has grown rapidly over the last few decades. In fact, as the chart shows, it has overtaken wild catch since 2013.\n\nThis has relieved some pressure on wild fish stocks: if this increased demand for fish had been satisfied by wild catch, then many more would be severely overexploited.\n\nExplore the data →\n\nThe chart shows that in wealthy countries, many more women are now in the workforce compared to 50 years ago.\n\nData from the OECD and researcher Clarence Long shows that in the late 1960s and 1970s, only 25% to 40% of women were economically active.\n\nThis number has increased to more than 50% in all countries shown. In Spain, for example, the share of women in the workforce more than doubled, going from about one in four to more than half.\n\nEven with these increases, women’s participation in the formal workforce is still significantly lower than men's. However, women are more likely to be informally employed than men in many countries and devote more time to unpaid work.\n\nRead more about the changes in women’s employment →\n\nOutdoor air pollution is a significant health issue that impacts well-being and mortality.\n\nIt can increase the risk of several leading causes of death, including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases like asthma.\n\nThis chart shows that death rates from outdoor air pollution vary widely across countries. These rates, measured as the number of premature deaths per 100,000 people, are based on data from the IHME's Global Burden of Disease study.\n\nOutdoor air pollution tends to worsen as countries transition from low to middle-income status and industrialize. This is often due to increased energy and industrial emissions without adequate regulation and cleaner technologies.\n\nHowever, as countries reach higher income levels, death rates decline again as air quality improves.\n\nExplore outdoor air pollution death rates for all countries →\n\nInfants, children, adults, and the elderly are all less likely to die than in the past.\n\nThe chart shows death rates by age in France since the early 19th century, combining data from the Human Mortality Database and the United Nations World Population Prospects. Death rates have fallen in every age group.\n\nWhen data collection began in 1816, around 1 in 5 babies in France died during infancy. Two centuries later, that figure was 1 in 274, a 50-fold reduction.\n\nIn 1816, around 1 in 20 people aged 65, died. In 2021, it was 1 in 106, a five-fold reduction.\n\nThese reductions mean that death continues to be delayed, and life expectancy continues to rise.\n\nRead more about the fall of death rates over time →\n\nIn 1980, Ethiopia had the highest death rate from tuberculosis in the world. Almost 400 people died per 100,000 people, according to data from the latest edition of the Global Burden of Disease study.\n\nSince then, the country has achieved a sixfold reduction in the death rate. This steep decline is shown in the chart.\n\nThe nation's widespread health initiatives have likely significantly improved access to tuberculosis care and treatment. These efforts have significantly exceeded the progress of other countries with similar tuberculosis rates in the 1980s.\n\nDespite these advances, Ethiopia's tuberculosis mortality rate remains significantly above that of wealthier nations, where fewer than 1 in 100,000 people die from the disease annually.\n\nExplore tuberculosis mortality rates in other countries →\n\nAccording to the latest trade statistics from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the sum of exports and imports across countries amounted to 63% of global GDP in 2022, the most recent year available.\n\nThis metric, also known as the trade openness index, represents the ratio of total trade (exports plus imports) to global output. The higher this ratio, the greater the influence of international trade transactions on global economic activity.\n\nThe chart shows the trade openness trend since 1970. After a decade of ups and downs, with a noticeable dip in 2020, trade rebounded above pre-pandemic levels in 2022.\n\nIn fact, from a long-run perspective, the 63% observed in 2022 was historically unprecedented.\n\nEconomic historians estimate that in 1912, at the peak of the “first wave of globalization”, the trade openness index reached 30%. Global trade declined substantially during the First and Second World Wars, then increased again with the onset of the “second wave of globalization”, exceeding 50% of GDP at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThe fact that global trade openness was higher in 2022 than ever before may seem surprising, given that several countries that followed different trajectories received considerable attention in the media. For example, imports and exports peaked at 65% of GDP in China in 2006 but have since declined to 38% in 2022.\n\nRead more about the first and second waves of globalization →\n\nUnder-five mortality rate Long-run estimates combining data from un & gapminder\n\nWhat share of children die before their fifth birthday?\n\nWhat could be more tragic than the death of a young child? Child mortality, the death of children under the age of five, is still extremely common in our world today.\n\nThe historical data makes clear that it doesn’t have to be this way: it is possible for societies to protect their children and reduce child mortality to very low rates. For child mortality to reach low levels, many things have to go right at the same time: good healthcare, good nutrition, clean water and sanitation, maternal health, and high living standards. We can, therefore, think of child mortality as a proxy indicator of a country’s living conditions.\n\nThe chart shows our long-run data on child mortality, which allows you to see how child mortality has changed in countries around the world.\n\nExplore and learn more about this data"
