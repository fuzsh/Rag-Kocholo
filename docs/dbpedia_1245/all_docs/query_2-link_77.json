        "text": "Racism. No Way! is committed to providing accessible content for all users. This includes those with physical and cognitive disabilities, as well as anyone using assistive technology.\n\nThis website adheres to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG 2.1) at the AA level.\n\nThis website utilizes an accessibility interface that allows persons with specific disabilities to adjust the website’s UI (user interface) and design it to their personal needs.\n\nAn AI-based application runs in the background of the website and constantly optimizes its accessibility level. This application remediates the website’s HTML, adapts Its functionality and behaviour for screen-readers used by people who are blind or have low vision, and for keyboard functions used by individuals with motor impairments.\n\nScreen-reader and keyboard navigation\n\nOur website implements the ARIA attributes (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) technique to optimise screen-reader functionality.\n\nScreen-reader optimisation: we run a background process that learns the website’s components from top to bottom, to ensure ongoing compliance. We provide accurate form labels; descriptions for actionable icons (social media icons, search icons, cart icons, etc.); validation guidance for form inputs; element roles such as buttons, menus, modal dialogues (popups), and more. The background process scans all the website’s images and provides an accurate and meaningful image-object-recognition-based description as an ALT (alternate text) tag for images that are not described. It also extracts texts that are embedded within the image, using an OCR (optical character recognition) technology. To turn on screen-reader adjustments at any time, users need only to press the Alt+1 keyboard combination. Screen-reader users receive automatic announcements to turn the Screen-reader mode on as soon as they enter the website.\n\nThese adjustments are compatible with all popular screen readers, including JAWS and NVDA.\n\nKeyboard navigation optimization: The background process adjusts the website’s HTML and adds various behaviours using JavaScript code to make the website operable by the keyboard. This includes the ability to navigate the website using the Tab and Shift+Tab keys, operate dropdowns with the arrow keys, close them with Esc, trigger buttons and links using the Enter key, navigate between radio and checkbox elements using the arrow keys, and fill them in with the Spacebar or Enter key. Additionally, keyboard users will find quick-navigation and content-skip menus, available at any time by clicking Alt+1, or as the first elements of the site while navigating with the keyboard. The background process also handles triggered popups by moving the keyboard focus towards them as soon as they appear, and not allowing the focus to drift outside of it.\n\nShortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) can be used to jump to specific elements.\n\nDisability profiles supported in our website\n\nEpilepsy safe mode: this profile minimises the risk of triggers by removing flashing or blinking animations and risky colour combinations.\n\nVisually improved mode: this mode improves the website’s visuals for users with low vision.\n\nADHD friendly mode: this mode helps users with ADHD and Neurodevelopmental disorders to read, browse, and focus on the main website elements more easily while significantly reducing distractions.\n\nBlindness mode: this mode configures the website to be compatible with screen-readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack.\n\nKeyboard navigation profile (motor-impaired): this profile enables people with motor impairments to operate the website using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and the Enter keys. Shortcuts such as “M” (menus), “H” (headings), “F” (forms), “B” (buttons), and “G” (graphics) can be used to jump to specific elements.\n\nAdditional UI, design, and readability adjustments\n\nFont adjustments –users can increase and decrease its size, change its family (type), adjust the spacing, alignment, line height, and more.\n\nColour adjustments –users can select various colour contrast profiles such as light, dark, inverted, and monochrome. Additionally, users can swap colour schemes of titles, texts, and backgrounds, with over 7 different colouring options.\n\nAnimations – users living with epilepsy can stop all running animations with the click of a button. Animations controlled by the interface include videos, GIFs, and CSS flashing transitions.\n\nContent highlighting –users can choose to emphasize important elements such as links and titles. They can also choose to highlight focused or hovered elements only.\n\nAudio muting –users with hearing devices may experience headaches or other issues due to automatic audio playing. This option lets users mute the entire website instantly.\n\nCognitive disorders –we utilize a search engine that is linked to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, allowing people with cognitive disorders to decipher meanings of phrases, initials, slang, and the like.\n\nAdditional functions –we provide users the option to change cursor colour and size, use a printing mode, enable a virtual keyboard, and many other functions.\n\nBrowser and assistive technology compatibility\n\nRacism. No Way! uses a wide range of browsers and assistive technologies. Supported systems include: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera and Microsoft Edge, JAWS and NVDA (screen readers), both for Windows and for MAC users.\n\nNotes, comments, and feedback\n\nWe continually improve accessibility by adding, updating and improving options and features, as well as developing and adopting new technologies.\n\nAt times, we link to content or documents from third parties. This content may not adhere to the standards we follow."
