        "text": "Trauma is an emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, crime, natural disaster, physical or emotional abuse, neglect, experiencing or witnessing violence, death of a loved one, war, and more. Immediately after the event, shock and denial are typical. Longer term reactions include unpredictable emotions, flashbacks, strained relationships, and even physical symptoms like headaches or nausea.\n\nWhile these feelings are normal, some people have difficulty moving on with their lives. Psychologists can help them find constructive ways of managing their emotions."
