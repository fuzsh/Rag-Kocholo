What a shame it would be to loose any donotivo because those of us who can afford to give decide here’s a chance for a “free lunch.”\n\nMy guess is that we’ll see more donotivo-type albergues setting a price for accommodations and food like Casa da Fernanda has.

There will always be complainers, sometimes with reason and other times without!\n\nSimply donating more will not help the particular problem described. Those who are afraid of the competition will be even angrier, because the donativo owner is doing better and is still not subject to the regulations around commercial establishments. Nevertheless, I think that users of the donativos should be generous for other reasons.

For example, some communities don't have breakfast or supper due to community wishes that pilgrims spend their money in town. It's a balance for the community for the non-private donativos sponsored by parochial, amigos, or municipality. I don't know much about the private ones, but I can see where they may be scrutinized more closely by private businesses.\n\nRex\n\nOne Step at a Time\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVF Lucca to Roma 2024\n\nAug 6, 2024\n\n#7\n\nThe costs of some of the old monastery/convent donativos are much higher than we know (but having been a trustee of a monastery, I do know!) And since I \"know\", a combination of gratitude and guilt often result in my donation being similar to what I would pay a small hotel. I understand that donativos can/will help out Pilgrims who don't have the means (a sliding scale, if you will), but I am rather abrupt at correcting pilgrims who refer to it as \"free\". Note: many monastic orders welcome strangers as a part of their rules, but it is rarely, if ever, stated that such hospitality is \"free\".\n\nBuen Camino\n\nobinjatoo\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2012 Dieppe, FR Bici CF.\n\n2014 Ruta Vasco/CF/Primativo\n\nAug 6, 2024\n\n#8\n\nThis is the reason I'd live to just sleep outside.

If anything this thread puncuates, once more, that the need for generous donations is much greater than some folks may thnk (and unfortunately, in some cases - care)\n\nThat said - I am also sad that you had such bad experiences in private albergues as to cause you to dismiss all of them outright.\n\nI pretty much stayed in privates through most of my Camino; to be fair I'd say 99% (due in no small part to the fact that I started pushing my belongings by transfer company). only 3 come to my mind where I would not stay again because of the owners (grumpy or not, bullies or not). But then I also had WONDERFUL hosts (Arturo at San Miguel in Hospital d'Orbido and Christina at Albergue La Apalgateria in Villafranca Montes des Oca come to mind almost immediately)\n\nNot all people are \"bad\" just some....\n\nLast edited: Aug 6, 2024\n\nScouseKeith\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nJuly 2023\n\nAug 6, 2024\n\n#11\n\nAt San Anton, it was quite disappointing to hear someone drops a few coins in the donativo box.

He took pilgrims when we were full and he patiently spoke with Phil for about an hour when neither understood the other's language. He gifted us pilgrim shells made by the people who the Anfas albergue benefits.

They don’t receive government support they purely survive on the income from pilgrims. In 2017 I was late arriving about 3pm after a long really hot day’s walking and when I checked in they brought me iced cold warter and allowed me to cool down. I was talking to patron who is the manager and he explained the whole background of the Anfas and how they survived so I took it upon myself to make sure every pilgrim staying there that night was aware of it, I even wrote in the comments book and asked everyone to give whatever they could to help raise additional funds. Just after 11pm the patron came looking for me all excited, during the past 8hrs pilgrims had donated just under 500 euros additional funds to help Anfas, I was so pleased for them I drew up a poster coming from a pilgrim to all pilgrims to follow with a short message outlining how they could help support a worthy charity that offers a great experience and lovely and clean.\n\nThe patron asked me for my email address to keep in touch and for weeks that followed even on the quieter days raised anything from 150 to 600 euros each day.\n\nI went back and stayed in 2019 at Anfas and someone had drawn up another poster with the same message raising money.\n\nMoral of this is, there are always true pilgrims willing to share the less fortunate.\n\nThank you to every pilgrim that has stayed and donated extra at the Anfas Albergue.\n\nThank you for this wonderful info. I now plan to stay here on my pilgrimage through Estella this September.\n\nScouseKeith\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nJuly 2023\n\nAug 7, 2024\n\n#16\n\nThank you for this wonderful info.

Each should pull their weight, financially and physically , helping where they can, clean and find pride in their place. Pull more than your weight you're on the Way.\n\nBarbara\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSince 2000 French and Spanish, bikes and walking\n\nAug 9, 2024\n\n#18\n\nBe careful not to confuse the sometimes virulent hostility in France towards anything even marginally related to the Church with the generally less hostile situations in Spain.\n\nI think the French hostility to the clergy came before the Spanish history of hostility. I e. French Revolution versus Spanish civil war. In both countries it seems to have subsided somewhat.\n\nI do like donativos in both countries, and I like even more family hospitality, which is more a french thing. It's found on all the routes where pilgrim housing is limited, and it's usually accessed either by the local Saint James's association or the parish. It's quite often difficult to leave money, so I will usually ask the kind person who has housed and fed me to give it to their favourite charity if they won't take my money. If you use this network, and it's possible for you, please \"pay it forward\" by helping another pilgrim. Oh, and send them a postcard from Santiago.\n\nbks\n\nMember\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nArles Route\n\nAug 9, 2024\n\n#19\n\nI meant to suggest not any hostility from those who run these establishments, but hostility against them - - very many donativos or even free places in France that were attached to parish churches have been forcibly shut down over the decades.\n\nSorry for the misunderstanding!!\n\nbullingtonce\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nI plan to do the Ruta de la Lana in August/September 2021\n\nAug 10, 2024\n\n#20\n\n\"In 2014, Jean-Marc Lucien, who graciously received 700 to 800 pilgrims each year in St Privat d'Allier, was sued for unfair competition.

The world we live in. Therefore, for those willing to give, perhaps consider a donation not for that night but for a true donation, as one would make to a charity or non-profit organization. Your kids will get an adequate estate inheritance; they do not need to get all of it. If the means exist, a $100 donation or even higher, would go a long ways toward making up for the skinflints and scrooges that exist and, for those accounting/financial types like me, it can be a tax write off. After all, one does not do a Camino every year for goodness sakes and many people spend a decent amount on flights.\n\nAnyway, a thought.\n\nChuck"
