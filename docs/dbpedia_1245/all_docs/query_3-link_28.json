        "text": "To find a law review or journal in the library’s print or electronic collection, conduct a title or keyword search using words from the law review or journal title in MARQCAT (e.g., “Quinnipiac probate law journal”). MARQCAT is accessible via a search box in the left navigation menu of the law library’s landing page. MARQCAT does not permit searching for individual law review or journal articles. If the library has the journal, the catalog record should indicate its availability in print or via a specific electronic database such as HeinOnline. If the title is available on HeinOnline, it will be available in PDF. If it is available in print, it will be on the fourth floor of Eckstein Law Library. Periodicals are arranged in alphabetical order.\n\nIf a catalog search does not turn up a title, conduct an independent search on HeinOnline. Search the Law Journal Library and the Bar Journal Library depending on the title (coverage varies by title). If you know the legal journal is held by HeinOnline, it is fine to start with HeinOnline and search for the journal or the article title, author, or by citation.\n\nIf the law review or journal is not available through the library, then run a search in Google with the journal name in quotation marks to see if it is available for free on the Internet in PDF format. Many law reviews and journals are now using freely available online repositories of recent and historic articles, on platforms like Bepress. Some law schools, like Harvard, are publishing PDFs of their law journals from their school websites. Make sure that you are reviewing an image of the published version of the article rather than a working paper or a proof.\n\nStart by conducting a search in MARQCAT using ENTIRE COLLECTION. For non-legal newspapers, your best bet is to include the Raynor catalog and and use the Raynor Memorial databases. Search for the name of the newspaper (publication), not the title of the article (document). The catalog record often will link to electronic databases with original images or provide information on how to access the newspaper on microfiche. If the newspaper is available at Raynor or the law library in print, PDF, or on microfiche, you are responsible for obtaining it.\n\nIf your newspaper publication title search in the catalog fails, try the Raynor Memorial Library list of A-Z Databases and search that list for Access World News. Like many MU databases accessible from the Raynor Libraries page, you can access the material using your WIFI connection and simply sign in with your MU login credentials, from anywhere. This database is also known as Newsbank, but search the A-Z menu for the Access World News name. There are three such databases in the Raynor A-Z list. Usually you would search the broadest one (linked above) that includes international newspaper sources. If you know it is a Wisconsin newspaper, you might use the smaller database focused on Wisconsin. Once in a database, experiment with search strategies. Try Author/Byline and world region. Or, try the newspaper title in a title search with author/byline. Often, too much information can be unsuccessful; if one word is different in a headline (title), for example. If so, try a different search like date range and author/byline.\n\nBeyond Access World News, Raynor Memorial's list of databases also offers sources with original images or electronic versions of newspaper articles. Use these links to search current and older newspapers by name in ProQuest or EBSCO; America’s Historical Newspapers, etc. You can reach these databases and information about them using the links in this paragraph or on the HISTORICAL NEWSPAPERS list on Raynor’s website. Consult the chart below for custom links and more guidance for finding newspapers via ProQuest or other databases. You may have to try several of these locations to find the newspaper article you seek.\n\nIf MARQCAT or your search of the above databases is unsuccessful, try searching the Milwaukee Public Library’s catalog. Remember it can take up to four weeks to obtain materials via the ILL process and MPL is only steps away from the law school. If the material is at MPL Central, go there and get it.\n\nIt can be very difficult to obtain copies of newspaper articles in hardcopy or microfilm. The University of Minnesota Law Library offers this tip: “Most law review authors cite to newspaper articles they found on Westlaw, Lexis or the Internet. If they cite to a hard-to-find newspaper, or to wire services like Reuters or Associated Press, you can sometimes use newspaper databases to find a nearly-identical story in one of the major newspapers (Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times).” Ask your editor.\n\nBadgerlink, Wisconsin's free online library for state residents has access to Newspapers.com, a source for online and scanned versions of newspapers in the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, N. Ireland, England, and Panama. Newspapers.com is not comprehensive, but has hundreds of local papers and extended coverage dates for many, ranging from 1700-now. NewspaperARCHIVE is another database that has a lot of older material, with a paywall; it could be worth getting a free, one-time 7-day trial to search for a source that is hard to find anywhere else."
