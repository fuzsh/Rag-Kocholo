        "text": "Last week, MUSEA Curate Shiloh Sophia had the opportunity to visit the Pulitzer Prize winning author of The COLOR PURPLE, Alice Walker to enage in conversation Nurtured by Nature. In preparation for the upcoming event on June 3, Living the Truth, the two engaged in conversation in Anderson Valley at Alice's home. Shiloh Sophia was raised as an artist activist and Alice's work had a huge influence on her development and the work she brings forward at MUSEA Center for Intentional Creativity. The two discuss our essential relationship with nature, the safety of women, the quality of solitude, the importance of creativity and access for children, the power of self-expression, poetry and the joy that is possible when doing deep work.\n\nShiloh also shares with Alice her earliest memory of her name and the connection with our MUSEA Art Matriarch, Sue Hoya Sellars, a dear friend of Alice. Shiloh Sophia also shares about the impact Partibha Parmar's Film, Warrior Marks had on her and why she wants to share it with her community. Warrior Marks is a part of the 3 film Cinema event at The Sebastiani Theater in Sonoma.\n\nJoin us Saturday, June 3 for the Living The Truth screening event featuring three films by award-winning filmmaker Pratibha Parmar, and special guest Pulitzer Prize winning novelist Alice Walker. Passes for all three films also feature conversations with the artists. This collaboration between Musea Center and the Sonoma International Film Festival, also features a limited capacity private reception with Parmar and Walker, and includes the screening of the film Alice Walker: Beauty In Truth.\n\nFor our Community,\n\nWe are delighted to share three events with you centering on the work of award-winning filmmaker, Pratibha Parmar with threads to the early work of Alice Walker. Threads of friendship, social justice, resistance, and activism inspire us to take our own stands.\n\nSaturday, June 3rd film screening is in collaboration with the Sonoma International Film Festival (SIFF) and takes place at Sebastiani Theatre and Sunday, June 4th gathering is at MUSEA Center in Sonoma. For those of you in the Bay Area who can attend Day 1 (June 3rd), consider adding Day 2 (seating for Day 2 is very limited and only open to ticket-holders for Day 1.)\n\nFor those of you who are not in the Bay Area, or who are unable to attend the weekend before, join us virtually for a daylong global gathering on Sunday, June 11. This event takes place a week later, featuring footage from the weekend before, including Q&A in the theatre about the films with Parmar and Walker, as well as intimate footage with Curate Shiloh Sophia at MUSEA in Sonoma with the two activists in conversation. Each guest will make their own âArts of Justiceâ poster to explore their own stands. No experience is needed.\n\nABOUT PRATIBHA PARMAR\n\nPratibha Parmar has spent her life creating films that make the invisible visible. With a focus on the arts centering on women, social justice, resistance, friendship, and love. Parmarâs films evoke deep emotion and inspire action. For over three decades, Pratibha Parmarâs body of work includes landmark life-changing films; such as Warrior Marks and Beauty in Truth, both featuring Alice Walker, Queer South Asian films, Khush and Ninaâs Heavenly Delights, and revolutionary, iconic films like A Place of Rage, that features Angela Davis and June Jordan. Her most recent film is, My Name Is Andrea, a stunning retelling of the story of Andrea Dworkin.\n\nParmarâs films are rooted in deep soulful storytelling, and they invite the viewer to enter into the visceral and the beautiful. How she accomplishes both making accessible what is hard to hear and generating a desire to dive into the story is a wonder to those of us who are her avid fans. Some of us commit to seeing every single film. Her body of work includes feature films, narrative and non-fiction, experimental film and video, and episodic television. She is a true artist devoted to her craft.\n\nIn Girls in Film, Roberta Graha says this of Parmar âShe is a key component in a history of creative resistance,â and, âher work examines the creativity of women of color alongside the politics of oppression to give a voice to the marginalized, often with the view of depicting the strength of womanhood. Being of Indian descent and from a family history of migration across three continents - themes of diaspora, colonization, and persecution.\n\nJune Jordan said this of Parmar on June 22, 1993, at the Castro Theatre on the occasion of Parmar being presented with The Frameline Award. \"The work of Pratibha Parmar illuminates her steady determination to depict and to defend the love and to depict and to end the pain and to depict and to defend the dreams/to depict and to end the screaming terror of people who would otherwise remain hidden away from most of us, and silent. She has come far and fast, and she has never forgotten/never abandoned the root origins of her complex identity and her moral concerns.\""
