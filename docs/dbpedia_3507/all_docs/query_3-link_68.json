        "text": "Umrao Jaan (Narrative Feature)\n\n2006, Hindi\n\nScreening: Thursday, Nov 2, 8:30pm\n\nCourthouse, Anthology Film Archives\n\n32 East 2nd Street (corner of 2nd Avenue) New York City\n\nCast: Aishwarya Rai, Shabana Azmi, Sunil Shetty, Abhishek Bachchan.\n\nSynopsis:\"Luft hai kaun si kahani mein…\n\nAap beeti kahun ki jag beeti\"\n\n\"What story will more absorbing be…\n\nHow fared the world in which I lived\n\nOr what fate hath held in store for me.\"\n\n- Umrao Jaan Ada\n\nThe real wealth of a people is their culture and literary work, which reflects the times, the place and the people.\n\nOne such work was Mirza Hadi Ruswa¹s Umrao Jaan Ada. Ruswa was a teacher in mathematics, science, philosophy & Persian. Ruswa was born in 1857 in Lucknow and his parents died when he was 16 years old. ŒRuswa¹ means a person without reputation. After going through the book, many literary minds felt that Ruswa could have named it 'Kahani Avadh Ki' or 'Sham-e-Avadh', because it is a vivid depiction of life in Avadh. But then , 'Sham-e-Avadh' or 'An Evening in Avadh' means 'mehfils'of song and dance and gatherings of poets and the literati -- a veritable celebration of life…And any such evening would be inconceivable without the presence of Umrao Jaan Ada.\n\nA courtesan and a poetess in her own right, Umrao Jaan was a name to be reckoned with in any description of life in Avadh. If Lucknow was the heart of Avadh, Umrao was the heart beat.\n\nWhen she first came to Lucknow, she was Amiran, the eight year old daughter of a lower middle class family. Her father was a Jamadar at the 'Bahu Begum ka Makhbara' in Faizabad. A pious and simple man, he gave evidence in a case against Dilawar Khan, a habitual offender. Dilawar was sentenced to jail for ten years. After finishing his sentence Dilawar came out , only to kidnap little Amiran , cart her to Lucknow and sell her to a kotha owned by the astute Khanum Sahib. This was the vengeance and a few rupees as bonus. \"Let her suffer a death worse than a death,\" he said.\n\nA kotha in that age, especially that of Khanum was not only a cultural hub known for excellence in performing arts but also a temple of learning the art of living. As an inmate of the kotha , little Amiran benefited the most. Khanum gave her the name 'Umrao' , Bua Hussaini brought her up in style, Maulvi Sahib imparted education, Khan Sahib initiated her into the world of music while the great Kathak Acharya made her feet move to rhythm. In the company of Bismillah, Khurshid and Gauhar Mirza, Umrao developed varied skills including poetry. The pen name 'Ada' was ample proof of the proficiency in writing and presenting poetry that she went on to acquire.\n\nGraduating in years, Umrao became a rage in Lucknow. A beauty that was stunning, a manner that was enticing and words that were soul stirring, made the name of Umrao Jaan mean sheer joy of watching and listening.\n\nStepping into youth, she had to seek the love of her life. His name was Nawab Sultan. With the whole of Avadh at her feet, Umrao craved for Sultan's company. Somewhere deep inside her being, she had a dream of a husband, a family and a home. She chased her dream from one end of the rainbow to the other.\n\nWould she realize her dream ever? Would she come face to face with Amiran once again? They say the child in you never dies…Just as hope never dies…\n\nDirector: J.P. Dutta\n\nWhen grandiose vision and splendorous creativity meet incessant passion and single mindedness of purpose, it creates a synergy that is seldom seen. And yet it is this very synergy that is not only manifested in every J.P.Dutta film, but in fact forms a hallmark.\n\nMaverick, Auteur, Visionary, Technical genius, Master film maker, are only some of the tag words that follow the name J.P.Dutta. He took the worlds on either side of the cinema screen by storm with his very first directorial venture Ghulam in 1985. The technical brilliance , visually compelling frames and arresting look were backed by strong socio-economic content & high emotional quotient.\n\nThe commendable standard that he set for himself did not bow down to the law of gravity with the films that he went on to direct. Yateem (1989), Hathyar (1989), Batwara (1989) & Kshatriya (1992) firmly entrenched J.P.Dutta as one of Hindi Cinema¹s sparkling originals which were a diminishing breed. Firm in his convictions, uncompromising in his ideals, sure about not following the trodden path & fearless in expressing himself, he ended up altering audience perceptions forever.\n\nHis banner J.P.Films, was flagged off on 30th March 1993.With the three films that were to follow under his baton, J.P. Dutta not only re-created history but also created it. Border (1997) a hard- hitting & sensitive film that saluted the unflinching valour of soldiers, created box-office hysteria, won numerous awards & went down in the history of Indian Cinema as one of it proudest moments. J.P. Dutta who was known for the masculinity & machismo prevalent in his films strangely emerged the one who touched on the aspect of the agony experienced by the women & families of the soldiers as they stood on the tight rope of life & death. The necessity and urgency of peace could not have been signified better than in this film.\n\nHis next film Refugee (2000) was significant for its endeavor of showcasing the Œnothingness¹ associated with geographical boundaries as love proved universal. After Border J.P.Datta did not fathom making another war film. But following the Indo-Pak Kargil war when J.P.Dutta met many war heroes & was sensitized first- hand to the bravery of the martyred, he could not puncture his fervoured feeling of honouring their valiance and emphasizing on the sheer futility of war. And his labour of love LOC-Line of Control illuminated the silver screen. Such has been the impact of LOC and Border that J.P.Dutta has been acknowledged as the Supremo of war-based films.\n\nIndeed ,there is no missing the overwhelming passion and painstaking detail that is rampant is every J.P. Dutta film. Not surprisingly he has also written and edited most of the films directed by him.He has a penchant for large canvases with a feeling of endlessness and ruggedness & mostly prefers shooting in sprawling outdoors. Seldom has he felt magnetized towards the synthetics of sets. His films have mainly been shot in unexposed locales of Rajastan, Gwalior & Agra as well as the Rann of Kutch and he has given them a look that only he could have . Needless to add that though his films are shot beautifully, one can see, feel and even experience the human emotions of the characters in his films shimmering all the way through, and that is what makes a J.P.Dutta film a heart- wrenching experience.\n\nHowever diverse have been the subjects that J.P. Dutta has tackled, they are unified by one common thing the triumph of the human spirit. His latest venture Umrao Jaan is no exception .Though in many other ways it is a film unique from any other directed by him- A biopic, with a female main protagonist & a complete musical . Of course in terms of detailing, finesse, visual appeal & strong emotions, Umrao Jaan bears the J.P.Dutta stamp all the way.\n\nChoices are arguably often the most difficult challenges a human being faces. A cinema lover is often faced with choices. Art film or Commercial? Content or Form? Socially relevant or entertaining? For the masses or the classesŠ? J.P. Dutta¹s films spare one of making these choices as they comprise a heady mix of them all. No mean achievement for someone who is in the craft of film-making for the sheer love of it. Who stoically follows his heart & never the trend. Who always works by instinct & never by manipulation . A man with gutsŠ. A man who follows his gut...... What better way to describe J.P.Dutta?"
