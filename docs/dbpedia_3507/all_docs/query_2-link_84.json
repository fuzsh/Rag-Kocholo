It follows the mixed fortunes of a Glaswegian family, the Shahs, and their award-winning Indian restaurant, The New Taj. ¶ The story is told through the eyes of Nina Shah, a young Scottish-Asian woman engaged in her own highly personal identity crisis. Nina had left home under a cloud after a row with her father, but when he dies suddenly, Nina is forced to return. Her return reunites her with her childhood friend Bobbi, a wannabe Bollywood drag queen, and brings her face to face with Lisa, a charismatic young woman who now owns half the restaurant. ¶ Then Nina discovers her father's secret - The New Taj has been selected for The Best of the West Curry Competition. In the turbulent days that follow, Nina (helped by Lisa) embarks on a personal mission to win the trophy for the third time. But Nina's feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises that she is falling in love. ¶ Can her feelings ever be reciprocated? And, if they are, what will this mean for Nina and her family?\"\n\nHere's a synopsis for Nina's Heavenly Delights from the website of international sales agent Fortissimo Film Sales B.V.: \"Nina Shah is a feisty young Indo-Scottish woman with an identity crisis. Nina previously left home under a cloud after a row with her father. When her father dies suddenly, Nina is forced to return and run the family-owned curry house. This reunites her with her childhood friend Bobbi, a Bollywood drag queen, and brings her face to face with Lisa, a charismatic young woman to whom Nina's father sold 50% of the restaurant. ¶ Nina embarks on a personal mission to win the 'Best of the West' curry competition, a highly coveted prize in the world of Indian cuisine. But Nina's feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises that she is falling in love... with Lisa!
