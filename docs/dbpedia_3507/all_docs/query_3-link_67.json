        "text": "Online platform commissioning artists within a DIY TV show format\n\nTRANSMISSIONS is back for Season 3! In the past year, we have learned that all forms of community are vital in providing mechanisms to support each other through this precarious time. In the continued pandemic landscape that we occupy many artists, writers and thinkers have had and continue to have exhibitions, opportunities and subsequent fees postponed or cancelled. In response to this, TRANSMISSIONS established itself in 2020 as an online platform that commissions artists to share their work within a classic DIY TV show format. Their new season for 2021 comprising 6 episodes will stream every month via their website from March to October 2021.\n\nSeason 3 of TRANSMISSIONS will run as six episodes screening once per month on Wednesday at 10 pm CET, repeating on Friday at 11 am CET on TRANSMISSIONS TV. The 1st episode will air on 17th of March 2021. Each artist included in TRANSMISSIONS is paid a fee in return for their contribution. In some instances, artists have waived their fees in order to donate the money to a charity of their choice. With a sense of community, all the money used to pay artists in season 3 has been kindly donated by established art institutions and commercially stable artists.\n\nSeason 3 is funded & supported by BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Chisenhale Gallery, Forma, Manchester International Festival, Netwerk Aalst, Somerset House Studios, South London Gallery & Wysing Arts Centre.\n\nProgrammed and founded by Anne Duffau, Hana Noorali and Tai Shani\n\nProduced by Lori E Allen and associate producer Mika Lapid\n\nEpisode 1 – Group Show\n\n17 March, 10PM CET\n\nReplay: 19 March, 11AM CET\n\nWith Ron Athey, JJ Chan, Jamie Crewe, Valie Export, Ioanna Gerakidi, Will Harris, Caspar Heinemann, Ayesha Tan Jones, Martha Rosler, Julietta Singh, Peter Spanjer and boychild + Wu Tsang\n\nImage Courtesy Peter Spanjer, Every Piece of You 2020.\n\nEpisode 2 – Not a gimmick, a punchline\n\n28 April, 10PM CET\n\nReplay: 30 April, 11AM CET\n\nLow key obsessed with reality TV, the multidisciplinary artist and musician Oyiri presents a specially commissioned episode for Transmissions.\n\nCHRISTELLE OYIRI (b. Nogent-sur-Marne, 1992) is a multidisciplinary artist based in Paris: she is a sound artist and DJ as well as a performer.

How can a nation-state be seen as land when settler/post/decolonial critique’s applications are questionable? How do we speak about our own ethnicity when the doors behind us remain closed, and with walls around each of us? One participant’s provocation, “Does China really exist?” is brought into a dialogical structure that asks, “Can fear be cute?” Discussions around ethnicity are pumped into our air hammers and ghostly encounters are channeled across lifetimes, painted in smoke and fire.\n\nDr. YOU MI is a curator, researcher and lecturer at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne. Her long-term research and curatorial projects spin between the two extremes of the ancient and futuristic. She works with the Silk Road as a figuration for deep-time, deep-space nomadic imageries and old and new networks/technologies. Under this rubric, she has curated programs at Asian Culture Center in Gwangju, South Korea, Ulaanbaatar International Media Art Festival, Mongolia (2016), and with Binna Choi, she is co-steering a research/curatorial project “Unmapping Eurasia” (2018-2021).

She is one of the curators of the 13thShanghai Biennale (2020-2021).\n\nHer academic interests are in media theory and performance philosophy, science and technology studies, as well as new and historical materialism.

Through his performative manipulation and intervention in intellectual legacies such as literature and historical narrative, Wang Tuo employs mediums of film, painting and performance to examine the unreliable relationship between the contemporary human status, myth and cultural archive. Wang’s practice also seeks to develop a discourse on how present ideology is derived from its historical context continues to adapt to changing condition.\n\nWang has recent solo shows at Present Company, New York, Salt Project, Beijing, Taikang Space, Beijing, and recent group shows at Power Station of Art, Shanghai, National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, Julia Stoschek Collection, Düsseldorf, Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, Zarya Center for Contemporary Art, Vladivostok, OCAT, Shenzhen & Shanghai, How Art Museum, Shanghai, Queens Museum, New York, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Taichung.\n\nWang Tuo was an Artist in Residence at the Queens Museum, New York from 2015 to 2017.

He is an architect, visual artist, educator, and cultural producer. He is co-founder of Radio Alhara.\n\nSometimes but especially during our current time, places and images have collided and became one. The image is the place, and the place is an image. The 5 videos by Palestinian artists included within “Place? What Place? I don’t see a place here… ” are asking, contemplating, and playing with this confusion between place and image. They inhabit one and run away from the other. They jump between what they are, videos on a screen, to claiming to be the only possible places where social and political events can occur. Are these images of places? Or are they places that exist only in images? Do these questions matter anymore?\n\nNoor Abed (1988, Jerusalem) works at the intersection of performance, media and film, a process of image making that is intertwined with forms of movement and choreography.\n\nAbed attended the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in New York in 2015-16.

Her work addresses the memory, history, archive, and the possibilities of tracing absence. Abuarafeh’s video and performances are text based that questions the complexity of history, how is it shaped, constructed, made, perceived, visualized and understood. And how all these elements are related to fact and fiction.\n\nNoor recently participated In Berlin Biennale (2020), Sharjah Biennale13 (2017), Off-Binnial – Gaudipolis, Budapest (2017), Qalandia International, Jerusalem (2018), In 2019 she had her first solo show “The Moon is a Sun Returning as a Ghost” in Jerusalem that is curated by Lara Khaldi.\n\nYazan Khalili lives and works in and out of Palestine.
