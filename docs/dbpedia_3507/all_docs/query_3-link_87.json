Her first documentary was “Where the waves sing” (2002), tracing the life of a former painter and governor in the forgotten Danish-Norwegian colony Tranquebar in India. While living in Sri Lanka from 2003 to 2006, she started exploring the concept of women in war, which turned into the film “My daughter the terrorist.”\n\n6 Yards to Democracy\n\nNishtha Jain and Smriti Nevatia, India, 2006, 55 minutes, Hindi (subtitled), DVD\n\n‘6 Yards to Democracy’ revisits a gruesome incident that took place during an election rally in north India. Thousands of women from poor localities of Lucknow city, lured by the promise of free saris, had been waiting for hours in the harsh sun for the cheap six-yard cloths. A stampede occurred: 22 died and hundreds were injured. This seemingly stray happening uncovers the sordid side of Indian democracy, and connects in significant ways with the daily humiliations forced upon these women and their families. As boom town dynamics keep pushing them further into the margins, we observe the women’s struggles to keep their homes, hopes and dignity intact while petitioning an apathetic state for their dues.

She has participated in conferences on media and gender issues, and cultural studies, and is co-editor of Sites and Practices: An Exercise in Cultural Pedagogy (Majlis 2006).\n\nCritical Panel Discussion\n\nSunday March 30th, 2008, 4:00 PM – 7:00 PM\n\nSouth Asian Women: Fundamentalism, Religion, Violence, and Governance\n\nThis panel looks into the ways that issues of religion, fundamentalism, violence, and governance intersect with each other and simultaneously impact the lives of South Asian women located in a multiplicity of situations. The panel is composed of the following speakers:\n\n1. Prof. Elora Chowdhury (University of Massachusetts) will be exploring the question of violence and women in Bangladesh and in particular will focus on the growing epidemic of acid attack against women in the country. By focusing on the story of Bina Akhter, a survivor/activist of acid violence, she will explore how feminists in Bangladesh navigate Orientalist, modernist, and transnational discourses of women’s empowerment in developing strategies and initiatives in response to gendered violence.\n\n2. Prof. Shahnaz Khan (Wilfred Laurier University, Ontario) will be speaking on notions of rescuing Muslim woman as a form of colonial feminism through which accounts of their de-contextualized lives by some western feminists help produce a discourse that suggests timeless tradition, Islam and their misogynist men as the cause of their oppression. She maintains that in identifying local patriarchies as the sole cause of women’s oppression support for military missions masked as rescue missions are generated. Using examples from Afghanistan and Pakistan, she argues for an analysis which examines the complexities of local arrangements and their interaction with transnational forces so that we may to better recognize the conditions under which women live as well as all the players who helped bring them about.\n\n3. Prof. Tayyab Mahmud (Seattle University) will address the relationship between modes of governance and the rise of fundamentalism in Pakistan. Bringing four distinct phases between 1950-2000 into focus, he would argue that the “rise” of religious fundamentalism was orchestrated by a state whose mode of governance rests upon lack of representation and denial of federalism. Regional and global geo-politics furnished the broader context within which this process unfolded. His talk will also incorporate the symbolic and substantive role of women leaders in Pakistani politics. In particular he will talk in a comparative mode about Fatima Jinnah (Jinnah’s sister who challenged Ayub Khan in the 1965 elections) and Benazir Bhutto.\n\n4. Brahmy Poologasingham (Attorney, Dorsey & Whitney, and Human Rights Commissioner, Seattle) will give an overview of the human rights violations in Sri Lanka as they relate to the terrorist activities and the government’s part in the ethnic Tamil/Singhala conflict. Specifically as it pertains to women, she will be talking about the cycle of violence the conflict has created as well as the unique position women have within the terrorist organization (LTTE) and their contribution to the peace keeping process.\n\n5. Prof. Meenakshi Rishi (Seattle University) will focus on issues of Grassroots governance in India, Iconic political persona, Women in Business, and Fundamentalism in India.\n\nSponsored by: South Asia Center, University of Washington\n\nClosing Night Program: Nina’s Heavenly Delights\n\nSunday March 30th, 2008, 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM\n\nPratibha Parmar, UK/India, 95 minutes, English/Hindi, DVD\n\nIt is a love story where Scottish humor meets Bollywood spectacle!

In the turbulent days that follow, Nina (helped by Lisa) embarks on a personal mission to win the trophy for the third time. But Nina’s feelings are thrown into turmoil when she realises that she is falling in love.\n\nCan her feelings ever be reciprocated?
