        "text": "Reel Affirmations 2007\n\nReview by Tim Plant\n\nRating: (4 out of 5)\n\nFriday, 10/12/2007, 7:00 PM\n\nFeature presentation, $10 at Lincoln Theatre\n\nDELICIOUS. THERE’S NO better way to describe Nina’s Heavenly Delights. It’s like Como Aqua Para Chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate) with spice — or the lesbian version of the Cooking Network.\n\nNina (Shelley Conn) stirs up a storm when she returns to Scotland following the death of her father, a renowned Indian chef. In addition to grieving, Nina has many fences to mend since her unceremonious departure on what should have been her wedding day. Her nuptials were not only going to join two prominent Indian families in Glasgow, but also two of the best restaurants in the city. Now her family’s restaurant is about to be sold, every member of her family is harboring a secret, and Nina must figure out a way to save what she holds dear.\n\nNewly added to the ”hold dear” category is her business partner Lisa (Laura Fraser), a childhood friend who holds all sorts of new potential. Together the two have chemistry — undeniable yet forbidden. If they can work together, they can win the Best of the West Curry Competition and save the Taj. If their budding romance is discovered, it may ruin everything. It’s slightly melodramatic, but handled so masterfully it surpasses many of the ”sexual awakening” films out there.\n\nDirector and writer Pratibha Parmar has created a beautiful film. Using the slightest touch of magical realism, Parmar incorporates beautiful shots of everything from falling rose pedals to the ethereal spirit of Nina’s father (Raad Rawi) helping her through the challenging times.\n\nNina’s Heavenly Delights is ultimately a story about being true to oneself vs. being true to one’s family. This film will leave you filled with warm fuzzies yet hungry for some Indian food. Dig in.\n\nSupport Metro Weekly’s Journalism\n\nThese are challenging times for news organizations.
