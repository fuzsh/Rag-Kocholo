        "text": "Panel: Gender and Sexuality in Independent Films\n\nPanelists: Gayatri Gopinath, Sonali Gulati, Pratibha Parmar, Veena Sood. Moderator: Sandip Roy\n\nPanel discussion will focus on representations of LGBT South Asians in independent films with a comparative analysis to such representations in more popular forums such as Bollywood cinema. We chose the panelists particularly because of their unique experience with and immersion in films that give voice to women and sexual minorities. The moderated discussion will allow ample opportunity for the audience to dialogue with panelists via questions and comments. Our goals for this discussion are for our audience to gain a greater understanding of the challenges of cinema that dares to highlight the human condition of women, transgendered persons and other sexual minorities, and to appreciate the complex and rich diversity of such cinema.\n\nISAFF 2008\n\nPANEL OF EXPERTS:\n\nGayatri Gopinath: Gayatri Gopinath is an Associate Professor of Gender and Sexuality Studies in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University.
