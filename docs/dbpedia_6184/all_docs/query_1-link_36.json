        "text": "Now that the latest Forza games have driven over the horizon, Turn 10 Studios is going back to its roots with Forza Motorsport. The game launches October 10--or October 5 for those with early access--which means reviews are now starting to cross the finish line,\n\nTurn 10 returns to the lead developer role of a Forza game for the first time in six years, with the last Turn 10 entry being Forza Motorsport 7 on the Xbox One. This new title was first announced during the Xbox Showcase in July 2020, which was one year before the most recent game in the franchise--Forza Horizon 5, which launched in November 2021.\n\nGameSpot's 9/10 Forza Motorsport review said that \"Forza Motorsport has been gone for a long time, but it's evident that Turn 10 has used the time to reevaluate its formula and implement some striking changes that will likely ignite a new passion for simulation racing for petrolheads and bring in a swathe of new players.\"\n\nYou can see a selection of review scores and excerpts from around the internet below. For more Forza Motorsport reactions, you can check out GameSpot sister site Metacritic.\n\nGame: Forza Motorsport\n\nPlatforms: Xbox Series X|S, PC\n\nDeveloper: Turn 10 Studios\n\nRelease Date: October 5 for early access, October 10 full release\n\nPrice: $70 on Xbox and PC\n\nGameSpot -- 9/10\n\n\"It would be nice to have more locations to enjoy Forza Motorsport breadth of vehicular content on, but it would be a lie to say I didn't have a massive grin on my face during every lap that I completed.\" -- Alessandro Barbosa [Full review]\n\nBut Why Tho? -- 9/10\n\n\"Forza Motorsport is masterfully made. The driving feels fantastic. The races at first are exhilarating. Plus, all multiplayer modes are enjoyable, and hours will pass in the blink of an eye.\" -- Mick Abrahamson [Full review]\n\nGame Informer -- 8.75/10\n\n\"Forza Motorsport may not have the most in-depth career mode, but it executes nearly every aspect of the package exceptionally well. Though some of the progression and dynamic visual elements fall short of the realism the rest of the title achieves, Forza Motorsport currently vies for the pole position in the sim-racer field.\" -- Brian Shea [Full review]\n\nDigital Trends -- 4/5\n\n\"Forza Motorsport cements itself as one of the best-looking and most approachable racing simulators to date. It can sometimes feel too clinical, but the core driving is perfectly fine-tuned..\" -- Tomas Franzese [Full review]\n\nEurogamer -- 4/5\n\n\"The idea is that Forza Motorsport is something that you install not just onto your Xbox (with its storage-busting 130GB) but onto your life - to be studied and picked away at in the months and years ahead. Whether that sounds like a weight or a welcome invitation will depend on your sensibility. For Turn 10, cars and life are inextricable, worthy of each other, and deserving of a tribute such as this.\" -- Josh Wise [Full review]\n\nIGN -- 8/10\n\n\"Forza Motorsport is, by a significant margin, the best feeling game in the Motorsport franchise to date. It isn’t necessarily a total reinvention of the Forza formula, and it still has that familiar level of forgiveness baked into it when you’re at and just beyond the limits of control..\" -- Luke Reilly [Full review]\n\nTheGamer -- 8/10"
