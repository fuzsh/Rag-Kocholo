        "text": "Petrolheads had lots to celebrate during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit earlier this month. There were plenty of exciting announcements revealed, such as the revival of the iconic Acura NSX and the unveiling of the brand new Ford GT, but alongside the American two-seater sports car, digital racing fans were also in for a treat.\n\nMicrosoft and Turn 10 Studios announced that Forza Motorsport 6 is on the way to Xbox One, with Ford’s latest motor on the cover, just in time for the series’ 10th anniversary. Launch title Forza 5 was a strong start for the franchise on a new platform, but there was plenty of space for improvement too. Here’s what we want to see fixed under the bonnet for the sixth instalment.\n\nPipe down with the Top Gear already If you’re anything like us and you’re tired of the likes of Jeremy Clarkson popping up on your TV almost everywhere, to have the whole Top Gear crew invading your Xbox takes things to a whole new level. While plenty of the Top Gear-themed additions to Forza 5 are pretty cool (that ‘66 Chaparral 2E? Oh yes please), we just wish that we were actually able to skip through some of the scenes from time to time – after all, we often boot up our Xbox One to get away from what’s on telly.\n\nMicrotransactions can be left in a pile of smoke We loved Forza 5, don’t get us wrong, but our biggest annoyance had to be the game’s microtransactions. It looks like Turn 10 and Microsoft took a page from the free-to-play mobile gaming world, as while you’re able to earn over 100,000 credits for an hour’s play in a racing series (if you’re good), some of the best cars in the game cost you upwards of a million in-game credits, meaning you’ll be grinding for a while. But if you’ve got the real life cash to splash, you’re able to head over to the Xbox Marketplace and buy tokens to grab that lavish car you’re after – or even to let you earn experience points at a faster rate. We’d rather see the microtransactions ditched and the game made fairer, so you’re rewarded with the game’s top cars for your hard work rather than just throwing money at the game which you’ve already had to buy a console and the disc for.\n\nWork with more than one (£350) steering wheel at launch Between the console, the game and the wheel, Forza 5 was on paper, one of the most expensive video games of all time. Thrustmaster’s TX Racing Wheel Ferrari 458 Italia Edition was pretty much the only choice you had during the Xbox One’s launch to get your hands behind a physical wheel for Forza 5, but it came in at a pretty steep £349.99. Add that to the cost of the £429.99 console (which may or may not have come with Forza), and the costs all add up. While gamers now have a few more wheels to choose from, Forza 5’s launch is still a sore point for many, especially if you invested in a Xbox 360 compatible wheel which still might not work on Xbox One.\n\nBring back some classic tracks While Forza 5 marked the series’ debut on next-gen, bringing even better graphics and cars, it omitted some classic tracks from the series. What happened to Forza 4’s epic Fujimi Kaido? Or Maple Valley? Or how about Forza 3’s Rally di Positano? We’d love to see these tracks from yesteryear pop back up into the next edition of Forza, letting us recreate some of our favourite races from the past few console generations – we still remember those racing lines!\n\nRelated\n\nThe AI needs real improvement Racing online against other people is easily the best part of Forza, but when you’re kicking back by yourself and taking on the AI, there’s room for improvement. Forza 5 introduced Drivatars to create AI racers based on real life drivers (In other words you could be racing against an AI that drove like another real world gamer), but a lot of the time it felt more like racing against bumper cars in a destruction derby rather than a real life race. It’s an improvement over your typical rubberband AI, but it’s still not perfect – let’s see how Forza 6 taps into the cloud to make racing against the computer even better.\n\nLet’s see some true to life weather Forza 5 shipped without any weather – or night racing for that matter – and it’s something we want to see brought over from the excellent Horizon 2 in the series’ sixth main outing. Instead of just different variations of tracks with rain or snow in, we want to see Turn 10 deliver dynamic weather this time around, or even tap into the power of the cloud and deliver real conditions in line with what’s going on in real life. If it’s raining at Silverstone today, we want to slip and slide our way through the wet too. Turn 10 and Microsoft have put a lot of time into creating Drivatars that use the cloud, and we’d love to see that happen with the in-game weather too.\n\nAnd one thing not to change: 1080p, 60fps Forza Motorsport 5 got plenty right on its next-gen debut though, and its Full HD resolution and 60fps fluid frame rate really helped show what the Xbox One is capable of. The frame rate drops down to 30 frames per second in replays, but the in-play visuals are cranked up to another level for you to kick back and watch back – feats that rival racers DriveClub and The Crew have barely hit, with the former still suffering from problems that have plagued it since launch. We’d love to see Turn 10 improve replays and up the frame rate to a rapid 60fps when you’re viewing back your best races, with the same, improved level of detail and leaving its rivals truly in the dust. We’re excited to see what’s in store for the next instalment of Forza, and we’re sure you are too."
