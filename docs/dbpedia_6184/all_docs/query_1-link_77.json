        "text": "Forza Motorsport has recently been under scrutiny as the fan base addresses some of the issues within the game. This Xbox-published title features realistic driving controls for each car, making the game more of a simulator than a video game. It gives hardcore racing gamers a proper platform to showcase their skill. Although Forza Motorsport is one of the most acclaimed simulators for racing, it is not perfect.\n\nGaming perfection is achieved when the entire community is happy with the product and the devs can work on feature updates for the game. So far Forza Motorsport is one of the top racing simulators, but the game has just gotten even better. In the “A Message to the Motorsport Community – January 2024” update from Turn 10, several key issues in Forza Motorsport have been identified, and the development team outlines their plans to address these concerns. Let’s break down each of the three main issues mentioned:\n\nThe big update that changes the face of Forza Motorsports\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nOne of the main issues that players face while playing Forza Motorsports is Car Progression. The car progression system in Forza Motorsport is not meeting player expectations, and it’s not delivering the desired upgrade experience. The new update addresses that this feedback is a top priority for the development team in 2024 and the team showcases that they listen to player feedback to make the game an enjoyable experience. However, the message from the devs acknowledges that implementing improvements will take some time. This shows us how the team is committed to overhauling or refining the car progression system to meet player expectations.\n\nAnother point that has been touched on is the Forza Race Regulations (FRR) which are not functioning as intended. The devs worked on the issue related to the effect their server has on accuracy and reliability during races. The development team acknowledges these problems and is actively working on implementing tweaks to give the players what they want. They also aim to improve the accuracy and reliability of FRR. Along with this, they are making sure that it functions as intended. This provides a fair and consistent experience for all players.\n\nRead More – Starfield Becomes the Most Popular Game on Xbox Game Pass, Surpasses Giants Like GTA V and Minecraft!\n\nThe last issue that the fans have raised is the AI in Forza Motorsport that is exhibiting aggressive driving behavior. This includes sudden braking, slowing down, and not accelerating out of exits. Addressing the overly aggressive behavior of AI is identified as a top priority for early 2024.\n\nTurn 10 Studios’ announcement is still not enough\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nForza Motorsport players got frustrated with Turn 10 Studios’ recent statement. The statement addressed issues since the 2023 game launch, like car progression, race regulations, and aggressive AI. The devs promised quarterly updates but didn’t give clear solutions or timelines. Players criticized the lack of a roadmap, progress updates, or a call to action.\n\nSome also felt disappointed about unaddressed single-player career mode issues. Overall, players saw the statement as a PR move to buy time, not a real response. Frustration came from the perceived lack of transparency and solutions, given the game’s launch being as recent as October 10, 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWith this, we now know the direction the devs are heading. Accepting community feedback and giving the players what they want is peak priority. With that said, do you have any suggestions on where Forza Motorsport can be improved? Let us know in the comments below."
