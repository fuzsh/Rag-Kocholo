I think this sort of promotion should be done on merit rather than tenure.\n\nRecore, Crackdown 3, Perfect Dark, Bleeding Edge, Halo MCC, Halo Infinite, the Phantom Dust debacle... first party has been mismanaged for years.\n\nThe statement was rough, buggy games multiple games in your list did not release rough and/or buggy. Xbox first party has enough issues without having to make some up.\n\nRodelero\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,594\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#43\n\nGot any more first party examples from the last decade other than Forza?\n\nJust listing games I played at launch...\n\nMaster Chief Collection\n\nHalo Wars 2\n\nSea of Thieves\n\nCrackdown 3\n\nBleeding Edge\n\nAge of Empires IV\n\nHalo Infinite\n\nForza Motorsport\n\nThere are also some extremely obvious examples that I haven't played, like Redfall.\n\nMicrosoft have also released a lot of games over this period that released in good and great states, of course. It's somewhat rotten luck that means it's coincided with the games I was most excited for. It should also be said that while Microsoft have overseen too many rough launches, they have rarely if ever abandoned those games quickly. In some cases, most obviously with Master Chief Collection and Sea of Thieves, those efforts have lead to great turn arounds, and I reckon Forza will be in that group in six months to a year.\n\nSplader\n\nFeb 12, 2018\n\n5,082\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#44\n\nBig contest congrats to him, that's a nice promotion!\n\nThough like most things, I imagine we don't see the effect of this for at least a year if not more.\n\nSilentEagle\n\nJan 9, 2021\n\n6,978\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#45\n\nI always love how Era talks about random gaming company execs like they're NBA players or something.\n\nWe need Peter Moore at Xbox like Jordan winning his second tree-peat.\n\nrrc1594\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n9,970\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#46\n\nThe statement was rough, buggy games multiple games in your list did not release rough and/or buggy. Xbox first party has enough issues without having to make some up.\n\nOn top of that many of those games didn't come from 1st-party studios so how is it mismanagement? That's not to exonerate MS of any poor handling, but it's not mismanagement.\n\nSplader\n\nFeb 12, 2018\n\n5,082\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#47\n\nAaand this thread has already turned into a \"Xbox studios have a big mismanagement problem!\" This time it took all of... 20 replies?\n\nNever change Era, never change.\n\nJust listing games I played at launch... Master Chief Collection Halo Wars 2 Sea of Thieves Crackdown 3 Bleeding Edge Age of Empires IV Halo Infinite Forza Motorsport T\n\nThese games all released rough or buggy enough to compare to FM? I could go through your list individually and talk about which part of that is and isn't true, but somehow I don't think it's worth the effort.\n\nJaded Alyx\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n36,690\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#48\n\nGood luck to him. Obviously, he must have shown he has the capabilities. I don't think the performance of one game matters much.\n\nextremely low reviews on Steam\n\nBut Steam users reviews as being the bellwether of a game's reception is.. less than ideal.\n\nExtremely low Steam players is the bigger thing there.\n\nThe Dave\n\nAlt Account\n\nJul 16, 2023\n\n2,093\n\nNov 8, 2023\n\n#49\n\nForza is the force it is today due to his leadership at Turn 10."
