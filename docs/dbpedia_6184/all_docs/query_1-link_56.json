        "text": "Forza Motorsport (2023)\n\n- Forza Motorsport review\n\n- Forza Motorsport car list\n\n- Forza Motorsport track list\n\n- Accessibility in Forza Motorsport\n\n- FM Xbox Dynamic Background\n\n- Forza Motorsport early access\n\nThe highly anticipated launch of Forza Motorsport (2023), the spiritual reboot for the long-running simulation racing franchise, is finally here. At least, the game is now rolling out to its first players thanks to early access offered through its Premium Edition and Premium Add-Ons Bundle DLC. While Forza Motorsport appears to be relatively stable at launch, and is already an easy contender as one of the best Xbox games of the year, no video game release is 100% perfect.\n\nTurn 10 Studios and Xbox are closely monitoring the release of Forza Motorsport to ensure players have the best experience possible in the latest Forza release, and we are, too. There's a growing list of known and confirmed issues reported by players, all of which Turn 10 is tracking and working on fixes for. Some of those issues even have workarounds that players can take advantage of now, and others will undoubtedly be patched in future updates.\n\nHere's all the biggest known issues in Forza Motorsport (2023), as well as any upcoming or released fixes, possible workarounds, and resources to keep track of other issues and help report problems you're running into.\n\nForza Motorsport: Top issues and bugs\n\nHere are all the top issues in Forza Motorsport that Turn 10 Studios is currently investigating to work on fixes. Some of these issues have workarounds for players, which we'll also note.\n\nSteam version failing to launch\n\nForza Motorsport will fail to launch on Steam if players don't have Xbox Game Services installed.\n\nWORKAROUND: Players can open the Xbox PC app to prompt an installation of Xbox Game Services, or follow this Xbox support article.\n\nImporting Forza liveries not working on Steam\n\nPlayers can import liveries from all past Forza games to use and share in Forza Motorsport, but this function only works on Xbox Series X|S and Windows PCs through the Microsoft Store. The Steam version does not support livery importing.\n\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter\n\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nForce feedback not working with Xbox controllers on PC\n\nOn Steam, some players may notice that the rumble or force feedback isn't working with their Xbox controllers with Forza Motorsport.\n\nWORKAROUND: Players will need to install the \"Xbox Extended Feature Support Driver\" in Steam by going to Settings > Controller.\n\nSuper sampling may not provide expected performance gains\n\nPlayers may notice that NVIDIA's DLSS and AMD's FSR technologies, which aim to improve performance by rendering games at a lower resolution and then upscaling them, is not providing the expected boost to performance in Forza Motorsport.\n\nHDR not working on PC\n\nPlayers with multiple GPUs in their PCs may notice that HDR isn't working in Forza Motorsport.\n\nWORKAROUND: Forcing the use of the discrete GPU in its respective control panel or using Windows \"Graphics\" Control Panel to manually set the PC to the \"High Performance\" GPU may resolve this issue.\n\nImage stretched on widescreen monitors\n\nPlayers may notice that Forza Motorsport appears stretched on wide and ultrawide monitors.\n\nWORKAROUND: Changing the resolution in Forza Motorsport's settings to \"Native\" or a resolution matching the aspect ratio of the monitor should fix this issue.\n\nWheels may not function every time\n\nPlayers may notice that their steering wheels may not function as expected every time they play Forza Motorsport.\n\nWORKAROUND: Steering wheels without drivers are the source of this issue, so players need to ensure they've installed necessary drivers from the steering wheel manufacturer.\n\nGame crashing after leaving multiplayer session\n\nPlayers are having issues with crashes after leaving a multiplayer session, caused by the game not cleanly removing the player.\n\nAMD-powered PCs building shaders every time\n\nPlayers are noticing that gaming PCs powered by AMD hardware are building the shaders for Forza Motorsport during every launch, which can take several minutes with older PCs.\n\nPlayStation and Switch controllers may not work\n\nPlayers are noticing that PlayStation 4 DualShock, PlayStation 5 DualSense, and Nintendo Switch Pro controllers are not working properly with Forza Motorsport on PC.\n\nXbox Cloud Gaming not available yet\n\nForza Motorsport is currently not available to play through Xbox Cloud Gaming, even for early access players. The game will be available to stream through the cloud on supported devices on Oct. 9, 2023 at 10:01: p.m. PT / Oct. 10, 2023 at 1:01 a.m. ET / 7:01 a.m. CEST.\n\nLong unpacking times on Steam\n\nPlayers are reporting issues with Forza Motorsport taking a long time to unpack after its initial download on PC (Steam).\n\nCrashes on PC\n\nPlayers are also experiencing more crashes on Steam versus other platforms.\n\nForza Motorsport: Other known issues\n\nTurn 10 Studios is keeping a running list of all the more minor known issues currently afflicting Forza Motorsport.
