The lack of a support process directly to Turn10 is very poor to say the least.\n\nReally? Do share the fix to this particular problem as there are many inquiring minds that would love to know.\n\nMy Motorsports 5 game froze well when I turned my Xbox back on I only had two cars I had a lot of cars and I can’t get any of them back\n\nI used all the methods of contact you all had said I email them & PMed that name you all gave. I’d like to thank you for giving the info!!! I lost like 4500 tokes they just disappeared. I have no idea what happened…Sadow212\n\nI think they’re still working on trying to fix whatever is wrong. I’d check out this thread:\n\nhttp://forums.forza.net/turn10_postsm254590_Tokens-not-working.aspx#post_254590\n\nI’d guess that that would be where they’d let people know when/if they fix it.\n\nYou could try using the search box in the upper left of the forums. Many people have had token issues as of late and Turn 10 is working on it.\n\nhttp://forums.forza.net/turn10_postsm254590_Tokens-not-working.aspx#post_254590\n\nAll illegal modifications of vehicles, even paint schemes outside the parameter of what can normally be done with the in-game tools, draw bans. Not too smart to also attempt to post the Internet link to a “forza hack” website either. Bans are not discussed on these forums, but you may write the developers at forzafb@microsoft.com, if you wish"
