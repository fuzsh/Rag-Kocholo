        "text": "The list of developers as part of Xbox Game Studios has been growing year-on-year - and with plans to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard, is only set to continue.\n\nEven if you're not close enough to the games industry to need to know who-owns-who, if you are an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, it can give you an idea of what will be coming in the future - especially with Microsoft's commitment to put everything it makes from its first-party studios onto the subscription service - as well as what's playable now through Xbox backwards compatibility.\n\nWith the likes of Halo, Forza, Minecraft, Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Doom - and soon Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Crash Bandicoot - there's an awful lot of games now under the Xbox Studios umbrella.\n\nThis page offers a complete Xbox Game Studios list, the headline games they have worked on, and upcoming Xbox studios games worth knowing.\n\nIf you are interested in Xbox Cloud Gaming in particular, our colleagues at Jelly Deals have recommendations for the best Xbox Cloud Gaming phones and tablets and best Xbox Cloud Gaming controllers.\n\nXbox Games Studios list\n\nIn alphabetical order, here is a complete list of Microsoft-owned game studios:\n\n343 Industries\n\nActivision Blizzard (pending)\n\nAlpha Dog Games\n\nArkane\n\nBethesda Game Studios\n\nCompulsion Games\n\nDouble Fine\n\nid Software\n\nInxile Entertainment\n\nMachineGames\n\nMojang Studios\n\nNinja Theory\n\nObsidian Entertainment\n\nPlayground Games\n\nRare\n\nRoundhouse Studios\n\nTango Gameworks\n\nThe Coalition\n\nThe Initiative\n\nTurn 10 Studios\n\nUndead Labs\n\nWorld's Edge\n\nXbox Games Studios Publishing\n\nZenimax Online\n\n343 Industries games and upcoming releases\n\nFounded by Microsoft as \"home to the Halo universe\" following the departure of Bungie from the company, 343 leads on all things Halo - from games to books and media. Its first projects were Halo: Combat Evolved (a remaster of the Xbox original) and Halo 4, and has produced main Halo entries and collaborated on spin-offs alike.\n\nBest known for: Everything Halo post-Bungie, including Halo Infinite (2021) and Halo: The Master Chief Collection (2014).\n\nUpcoming games: Halo Infinite will continue to see updates for the forseeable - with 2021 seeing co-op and likely a form of campaign level select.\n\nActivision Blizzard games and upcoming releases\n\nNote: The acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft is pending, and is expected to be approved in 2023.

From the Blizzard side of things, World of Warcraft continues to be popular, and the likes of Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are still to come - though both have been delayed to 2023.
