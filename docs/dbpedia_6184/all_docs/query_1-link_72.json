        "text": "Forza Horizon 4 is an open-world racing game developed by Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios.\n\nThe Steam release was developed by Sumo Digital, and the Series X/S release was developed by Panic Button.\n\nIt was announced during Microsoft's E3 2018 briefing. Set in Great Britain with a new seasons feature, each week the game world alters across spring, summer, autumn, and winter. As well as showcasing co-operative racing and a Great Britain setting, a 60 frames per second mode was unveiled.\n\nIt was released on October 2, 2018 for the Xbox One and Windows 10 platforms, with an early access release on September 28, 2018 for the Ultimate Edition bundle. Similar to Forza Motorsport 7, it is available on the Xbox One X as an enhanced title, featuring 1080p resolution at 60 fps or improved visuals at 30 fps.\n\nOn November 10, 2020, an enhanced version of the title was released for the Xbox Series X and S platforms, with the Series X release being playable on 4K resolution at 60 fps.[1]\n\nThe Windows 10 release was announced on February 8, 2021 to be available on Steam starting on March 9, 2021.[2]\n\nSetting[]\n\nThe title is set in a \"heavily-stylised version of Britain\" within Scotland and the Lake District of North West England. It features Edinburgh and villages in Cotswolds as one of many locations.\n\nEnvironments and weather types are determined by dynamic seasons that include spring, summer, autumn and winter. Depending on the season, players may have access to new temporary locations such as a frozen lake in winter or dried-up rivers during the summer.
