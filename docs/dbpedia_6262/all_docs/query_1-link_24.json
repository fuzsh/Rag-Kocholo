        "text": "That tally will take a beating when they catch up with you and you’re competing as the Great Britain* Olympic Committee in four years’ time.\n\n*not England, which isn’t a country\n\nThe bitterness flows through you when we do well.\n\nTo be fair, in contrast to previous Olympics I think 3 of our 19 gold medals have had involvement from athletes who weren't born in England (and in those case were born in Wales/Scotland). That's pretty much bang on what the population split says it should be.\n\nAs opposed to 5 out of 17 for Australia.\n\nAt this rate by the 2024 Games you'll be paying Kenyans to run for you like the countries in the middle east\n\n61st medal got. Already guaranteed 62 with the boxing tomorrow so need 3 more to match total medals from London and 5 more to match Rio. Been a great effort to keep the numbers so high even if the golds have been lower this time.\n\n61st medal got. Already guaranteed 62 with the boxing tomorrow so need 3 more to match total medals from London and 5 more to match Rio. Been a great effort to keep the numbers so high even if the golds have been lower this time.\n\n3 more might be possible I suppose?\n\nWe've got Laura Kenny in the omnium tomorrow, two guys still in the keirin, Jo Choong in the pentathlon, team showjumping and a few unlikely shots in the athletics.\n\nAs opposed to 5 out of 17 for Australia.\n\nAt this rate by the 2024 Games you'll be paying Kenyans to run for you like the countries in the middle east\n\nI mean, that's a lower proportion than the actual % of the Australian population not born in Australia (just).\n\nI wonder what country has the highest proportion of medals won by people born not in that country.\n\nCbf but I’d start looking at one of the countries that has a low medal count, or perhaps one which has only recently became a country. Maybe both.\n\nI wonder what country has the highest proportion of medals won by people born not in that country.\n\nQatar has 4 medallists this year and 3 of them weren't born in Qatar.\n\nAll of Kosovo and Montenegro's medallists are older than their country so were maybe born in a different country?\n\nA little hubris to close the games from Kenya\n\nJepchirchir predicts Kenyan podium sweep ahead of women’s Olympics marathon\n\nTOKYO, Japan, Aug 6 – World Half Marathon champion Peres Jepchirchir believes Kenyans have what it takes to deliver a podium sweep in tomorrow’s women’s marathon in Sapporo, Japan. Jepchirchir, a half-marathon specialist turned marathoner, reckons that the field is formidable in Sapporo “but...\n\nI suppose having the world marathon and world half marathon world record holders helps. Suddenly these Olympics, and the extensive bubble camp which was put up at the expense of so many other sports, are looking much more worth it.\n\nGold medal in the male modern pentathlon as well!\n\nWhat was the old pentathlon?\n\nEdit:. It was this\n\nThe first was the classic pentathlon, an athletics competition which was a variation on the Ancient Olympic pentathlon, comprising the long jump, javelin throw, 200 metres, discus throw, and a 1500 metres race. The competition featured at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics but was discontinued thereafter.\n\nGold medal in the male modern pentathlon as well!\n\nIn triathlon, omnium and pentathlon so far GB have 4 gold and 2 silver with one medal possibly still to come. We have events of 3-5 disciplines properly nailed down.\n\nWhat was the old pentathlon?\n\nThe ancient greek pentathlon was running, jumping, discus, javelin and wrestling. Supposedly it was meant to be the disciplines an ancient soldier needed. The 'modern' version was created in the late 19th century so it's meant to evoke that era of soldier."
