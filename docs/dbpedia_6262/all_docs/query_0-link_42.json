        "text": "20Q: Catching up with Janesville bar namesake Alta May Steinke\n\nBy Greg Little glittle@gazettextra.com\n\nJul 15, 2020\n\nAlta May Steinke\n\nShe might not own the place, but her name is right up there—front and center.\n\nFor those who wander in to Alta May’s Place in Janesville, it doesn’t take long to figure out who the bar’s namesake is. She’s most likely the one sidled up to a gambling machine, grinning ear to ear when she pulls herself a winner.\n\nAt 92 years old, Alta May Steinke has been around Janesville for a while. A Bower City native and Janesville High School graduate, she has also created some strong local roots as the matriarch of a brood that includes six kids, 15 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.\n\nBut Alta May is much more than just “Grandma.” She’s also a former pro roller skater, a late-life skydiver, a high-end automobile driver, a feature film extra and a killer-whale-shaped blimp navigator. She’s certainly got some stories and, if you’re around the bar at just the right time, you might even get to hear one or two.\n\nTo learn more about Alta May’s Place, visit the bar at 708 S. Jackson St., Janesville, or check out the its Facebook page.\n\n1. You are the namesake for Alta May’s Place, a bar owned by your daughter, Suzanne Hamilton. How do you feel about having your name attached to a tavern? My daughter (who also owns Hammy’s Roadside Bar in Janesville) bought it and used my name. I was so excited that I cried. It was the best thing anyone could do for me. My name will live on.\n\n2. As namesake for Alta May’s Place, what are your official duties? I would love to bartend, sweep the floors, pull the weeds. But I am 92, and I can’t see or hear. It’s tough aging.\n\n3. I would assume since your daughter owns the place, you can play any music on the jukebox you want. What would be the first song you’d want to hear? “Yellow Submarine” by The Beatles. Myself and my three girls sang it at the grand opening. It’s our family’s karaoke song.\n\n4. Do you collect anything? I collect watches. I have 65 of them. My favorite was very expensive—$350—and I have a SeaWorld watch from Texas that I got for $50. I also have pins from all over the country to put on my Hard Rock Cafe coat. My coat is very heavy.\n\n5. Name the one item you own that you would not want to live without. My dog, Doovey. I got him at 80 years old. He brought so much joy to my life, and it’s been difficult to live without him. I had him for 12 years. I miss him so much.\n\n6. People would be surprised to find out that I: Drove cars at Manheim Auto Auction in Orlando, Florida, until I was 91 years old. I also jumped out of an airplane at 91. Skydiving at 80 was the best thing I’ve ever done. I would do it again.\n\n7. I understand you appeared in the movie “Jaws 3.” How did that come about and what was your role? I was working at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida. I was an extra, and my sister Joyce was an extra, too. My daughter Tamie Steinke Shoener had a skiing-talking part.\n\n8. Have you ever met anyone famous? On the set of “Jaws 3,” I met Lou Gossett Jr., Dennis Quaid and Lea Thompson.\n\n9. You went skydiving when you were 80 years old. What made you try that, and would you like to do it again? It was very exciting. President George H.W. Bush went when he was 80, so if he could do it, so can I. I would have gone again at 90, but my family said no. I’d go once a month if I was strong enough.\n\n10. For a time, you were a professional roller skater. How does one become a professional roller skater, and what makes someone a “professional”? I got paid. I was a roller skater as a performer at my school and at a roller rink in Delavan. I liked to be around people.\n\n11. You used to drive the “Shamu blimp” at SeaWorld in Florida. How did you end up doing that? It was for an advertisement back in the ’80s. I just told the SeaWorld ambassador I wanted to drive that blimp. What an honor.\n\n12. You used to drive for Manheim Auto Auctions in Orlando, Florida. What was the nicest car you ever drove? Manheim is the biggest car auction in the United States. The nicest car I ever drove was a Maserati.\n\n13. I understand you perform music. When did you start, and what do you play? I started at age 5, and Marshall School (in Janesville) also had an orchestra. I have five violins, and I also play the cornet and drums. My kids and grandkids have my instruments now.\n\n14. I understand gambling is one of your favorite hobbies. Got any good stories about big wins? I love it, love it, love it. My advice is don’t put too much money in at once. Also, get out of one game and go back later. I won a big amount 20 years ago and threw $100 bills all over the house. The grandkids thought they were rich.\n\n15. What is your worst habit? Gambling.\n\n16. You’ve got six boys and six girls. Where did you find the time to do so many things with so much family responsibility? I did everything with my kids. I went to all of their events and got bleacher butt. I was a chaperone regularly. We lived on the river, and the Rock Aqua Jays was a big part of life for our family.\n\n17. Some people don’t believe Elvis Presley really died in 1977. What do you think? I saw him in Madison once when my son Steve was in college. At the time, Elvis was big and fat, and it was one of the last concerts before he died. I’ve seen his grave in Memphis. He’s dead.\n\n18. What was your first car? I drove a 1927 Chevy that was my dad’s car. He was a mechanic in Janesville.\n\n19. If you won the lottery, what would you do? Gamble, because I love to gamble. I’d also buy an island for my family and friends so they don’t have to work.\n\n20. Share one thing you haven’t yet done in life that you wish you could try. I love the Orlando Magic (NBA basketball team), and I went to a lot of free games because my boss at Manheim Auto Auctions liked me. It always came with a free buffet. I would love to meet (the players).\n\n20Q: Catching up with Green Beret Marching Band Director Jack Schroeder\n\nGreg Little\n\nSep 26, 2018\n\nEditor’s note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nJohn “Jack” Schroeder\n\nForget about the hills; John “Jack” Schroeder is alive with the sound of music.\n\nThe Janesville native and Craig High grad has been an integral part of the Rock County-based Green Beret Marching Band since its inception in 1966. Aside from arranging and composing music for the group, Schroeder also has served as its director for the past 30 years.\n\nThis summer, the band earned a gold rating and Best in Class in the Sound Sport International Division of DCI in Indianapolis, Indiana; firsts at events in Fort Atkinson and Traverse City, Michigan, and seconds in competition in Racine at at a Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association finals event in Whitewater.\n\nIn addition to his work with the Green Berets, Schroeder also arranges and composes music for his church choir at St. Matthew’s Lutheran Church in Janesville, and assists the Milton High School Marching Band with its fall program each year. He also has performed with the Choral Union in Janesville, and with the Southern Lakes Masterpiece Chorale in Elkhorn.\n\nAcademically, Schroeder holds a degree in avionics from Blackhawk Technical College. He also studied music theory and composition at the Anatowind Music Clinic in Beloit under founder Joe Simmons. Personally, Schroeder retired from AT&T in 2007 after 34 years with the company. He is married to Diana, and the couple have two sons: John T. and Ronald.\n\nIn his spare time, Schroeder enjoys fishing, working in his yard and offering private lessons to music students.\n\nTo learn more about Schroeder and the Green Beret Marching Band, visit Green BeretMarchingBand.org or search for “Green Beret Marching Band” on Facebook.\n\n1. With so many music opportunities available to young people today, why should they consider joining the Green Beret Marching Band? Most other music opportunities are music clinics/band camps that last only one or maybe two weeks. Some of these camps are school specific. We are open to everyone 10-21 years of age and from all over Rock County.\n\n2. You have been with the band since its inception 52 years ago. What first drew you to the Green Berets? I didn’t want to put down my drumsticks when summer came, so when a friend asked me to join the Green Beret Band, I jumped at the opportunity.\n\n3. What type of music did your parents listen to when you were a child? Did it influence your future tastes? Mom listened to big band and vocals such as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and The Andrews Sisters. She had stacks of 78s. Dad was into polka, dance music and old-time country and western such as Gene Autry and the Sons of the Pioneers.\n\n4. How many different instruments do you play? Are there any you wish you had taken the time to learn? It all depends on your definition of “play.” I can demonstrate several instruments to start new students, but to actually play, I can play any percussion instrument and saxophone.\n\n5. When I’m not listening to marching band music, I enjoy listening to: Classical and jazz. I like the variety and complexities of sounds and rhythms of a large orchestra. Jazz has spontaneity and some wild chords.\n\n6. The Green Berets is a sort of family affair for you, as your son, daughter-in-law and three grandchildren are involved. How does it feel to know other generations of your family share your love of music and the Green Berets? It is wonderful having the whole family involved! We can spend a lot of time together being creative, expressive and still have our own space. Our son and daughter-in-law write all of our show charts. Our oldest grandson, who is 22, is so talented, and he has been composing music since the age of 11. Just seeing what he comes up with gives me great pleasure and pride. The two younger grandchildren are definitely taking after mom, dad and brother. When they are at our house, there are always instruments being played.\n\n7. I’ve always been curious about the uniforms. What material are they made from? When it’s 95 degrees in summer and you have to march and perform, how do you stay cool? When it’s 95 degrees on the performance field, it’s just plain hot! Our uniforms are not heavy wool but a lightweight polyester. They breathe quite well, plus we have plenty of water with us at all times.\n\n8. Discuss your method for teaching music theory to musicians with little experience. 1. Be patient; 2. Go slow; 3. When the music gives you an opportunity to teach, take it; 4. Do a little bit every day; 5. See No. 1.\n\n9. What is your favorite food? Restaurant? My favorite food depends on what is in the refrigerator. I would love a good prime rib once in a while, but who can afford that? I like to try new foods when we go out. I once ordered oysters on the half shell and was shocked to find out they were raw (I still laugh about that one). We like going to Domenico’s in Beloit. I can never make up my mind what to order, so we get the buffet. I can try lots of great food, plus the people are super (wow, this looks like I’m a food critic). I just like food, and we go to a wide variety of restaurants, but most of the time we eat at home.\n\n10. Name a skill you wish you had. I know someone who tunes pianos, and I wish I could. I know someone who welds, and I wish I could. I wish I could drive a race car. I wish I could speak German. There’s a lot of wish-I-coulds.\n\n11. How did the Green Beret Marching Band get its name? The band was started by the Kienow-Hilt VFW in Janesville when ‘The Ballad of the Green Beret’ by Barry Sandler was popular, so it was a natural step to name the band The Green Beret.\n\n12. Do you have a pet peeve? People with talent who refuse to use it. People who take two sips of a can of soda or water bottles then walk off and leave it.\n\n13. Name the one item you own that you could not live without. My calendar. With the Green Beret Band, Milton High School Band, Anatowind Clinic, church choir, Choral Union, etc., I could never keep my schedule straight. Also, with me being the first to retire, it is up to me to keep track of doctor/dentist/chiropractor appointments.\n\n14. Without looking in the dictionary, what would you guess it means to be “panglossian”? Panglossian would be something from the Pang dynasty in early China. (Panglossian actually means “characterized by or given to extreme optimism, especially in the face of unrelieved hardship or adversity.”)\n\n15. How do you come up with the formations the Green Berets perform each season? Now, my son, John, writes the drill. The drill shapes are determined by the music. If the music is soft, you see smooth, slow developing shapes such as arcs and curves. If the music is loud and forceful, you use strong shapes, such as squares and diagonals.\n\n16. If you could have tickets to see any musical act perform, who would it be, and why? If time is not a consideration, I would love to go back and listen to Bach perform his contatas.\n\n17. What do young people learn through their experiences performing with a marching band? Most of all, they learn responsibility. They are responsible for getting to and from rehearsals, for having all of the things they need for rehearsals, such as instruments, music, field show chart book. When they are going to parades/field shows, they are responsible for having everything they need for the performance. They have several performances that require them to pack for overnighters. They are responsible for keeping their things together and for cleaning up after themselves. They learn to be part of a group. Marching band is not a “me” or an “I” activity; it is a “we” activity. Without working together, you would be a solo performer. There are times when we are short a specific instrument and the kids/or one of the instructors will grab a horn and fill in.\n\n18. What interests do you have that are totally disassociated with marching bands? Fishing. It is so quiet and relaxing—the complete opposite of marching band.\n\n19. A couple of years ago, there was concern about the Green Berets being able to continue because membership was down. Has that situation changed? What is the group doing to drum up continued interest? Recruiting is always a problem. In the last two years, membership has been up. More members come from current members, more than any other method. There is no better recruitment tool than the members themselves. Talking about their experiences in the band is the best draw. We have tried advertising in the newspaper, radio, Facebook, door hangers and personal visits. If I had the answer to this one, I would be a genius and also quite wealthy because I could sell it to other band directors. Several of the bands that used to march our circuit have folded because the members just weren’t there.\n\n20. If you won the lottery, what is the first thing you would do? I would buy the band an air-conditioned coach bus with a driver. That way, we could travel in comfort and take one BIG problem off of the officers and instructors.\n\n20Q: Catching up with senior center supervisor Janet McLean\n\nGreg Little\n\nAug 15, 2019\n\nEditor’s Note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nJanet McLeanJanet McLean has a vested interest in ensuring Janesville seniors have the chance to not only age gracefully but also live fully.\n\nAs a supervisor at the Janesville Senior Center, the retired teacher works to expand seniors’ cultural horizons by setting up trips and special events. She also helps organize countless center programs aimed at providing education and socialization opportunities.\n\nAfter graduating from Janesville Craig High School in 1974, McLean went on to obtain a bachelor’s degree in education from UW-Whitewater in 1978. A certified ceramic instructor, McLean worked as a part-time instructor for the Sheboygan Recreation Department before joining the city of Janesville in 1993. She was promoted to supervisor in 2003.\n\nAway from work, McLean has been married to her husband, Dave, for 26 years. She has two sons from a previous marriage: Ned Storer, an electrical engineer in North Carolina who, along with his wife, Maryann, has two children, Sophia and Eddie; and Adam Storer, a financial analyst in Oshkosh.\n\nThe Janesville Senior Center invites residents to tour the facility at 69 S. Water St., Janesville, and to participate three times in any program before being asked to become a member (annual fee is $25 per person). For more information, call 608-755-3040, search for “Janesville Senior Center” on Facebook or visit ci.janesville.wi.us.\n\n1. What considerations do you have to make when deciding which programs to offer at the senior center? We sometimes ask the seniors themselves whether they would be interested. Sometimes they bring us program ideas that they would like to see, and sometimes it’s hit or miss.\n\n2. What aspects of working at the senior center bring you the most joy/frustration? I get the most joy from working with the seniors, and the most frustration comes from all the paperwork.\n\n3. What are some of the common misconceptions people have about the Janesville Senior Center? That our center is strictly an activity center. We are not a nursing home.\n\n4. You have two hours of free time. What do you do? I watch my recorded TV programs because I don’t have time to watch them when they are on.\n\n5. You have a degree in education. How did you end up working at a senior center? With this job, I am able to teach. When I was hired 26 years ago, it was only for a three-month position. I previously had worked at the recreation department in Sheboygan for eight and a half years. This job was a perfect fit.\n\n6. People would be surprised to know that: Back in the summer of 1977, I was the first female to make it the entire summer working as a seasonal employee for the Janesville Parks Department. A Gazette reporter was surprised to see me cutting grass on the large mower and did an article on me. It was not common to see a female in that position. Times have changed.\n\n7. What is currently the wallpaper on your cellphone? My grandkids.\n\n8. Why is having a vibrant senior center critical to a community’s overall quality of life? It is extremely important to have an active senior center that offers a variety of activities, and it is important for the aging community to stay active and to interact with people. Loneliness is so common among this age group.\n\n9. Are you a “city person” or a “country person”? I’m a city person. I like living near to everything.\n\n10. Is there an activity or program at the senior center that you specifically had a hand in creating? Which was it, and why did you feel it was needed? Line dancing and ceramics. I took those over when I started and have continued teaching them. I teach three line dance classes each week, and they are very popular. I received my certification in ceramics which, at the time, no one was certified. We have ceramics twice a week. I also teach a Tuesday night ceramic class that is open to the public—all ages—from September through May, and I do ceramic birthday parties for kids here at the center.\n\n11. If you could learn to do anything, what would it be? Something working more with my hands such as carpentry or plumbing. It helps knowing these things around the house.\n\n12. Are there any particular programs that are being considered for addition to the Janesville Senior Center schedule? There are no new programs being considered at this time, but we are always open to suggestions.\n\n13. It seems the way people socialize, or don’t, is changing radically as the population ages. Do you see a steady number of members at the senior center, or has it increased or decreased? We are holding steady with our members. We had a great turnout at our open house in March, and people were amazed at how many things we offer here.\n\n14. My mom enjoys playing euchre at the senior center, but it seems the game isn’t overly popular with younger people. Are activities such as this destined to disappear as generations change? Euchre is very popular here. Duplicate bridge would be a game that is not being played as much. It depends on the generation. Some like to bring back the things they enjoyed doing in their younger years, but they also like to learn new things.\n\n15. Do you share a birthday with anybody famous? I share a birthday with Harry S. Truman, Enrique Iglesias and Melissa Gilbert (May 8).\n\n16. What are some of the more popular activities available at the senior center? Line dancing, euchre, special events, day trips, ping pong, woodcarving and billiards.\n\n17. Are ghosts real? What makes you say that? Ghosts are real. I have always believed there is another level that we go to when we die.\n\n18. Aside from family gatherings, it doesn’t seem that today’s senior citizens and younger people spend much time together. Are there any programs at the senior center that encourage generational interaction? We don’t have any intergenerational programs at this time. I did a program for 10 years where we had Patty Schneider’s “English for Life” class at Craig High School do a program with us. It was so rewarding to see the senior citizens interact with high school seniors. When Patty retired, so did the program.\n\n19. At the grocery store, what item always goes in your cart whether you need it or not? Candy.\n\n20. As a senior citizen yourself, what would you like younger people to know about seniors? That there is life after retirement. You should find a hobby you are passionate about. I have a lot of hobbies I enjoy, and I am fortunate I’m able to incorporate them into my job. I have a passion to encourage people to stay active through recreation.\n\n20Q: Catching up with El-Ra Bowl kingpin Chris Brose\n\nGreg Little May 9, 2018\n\nEditor’s Note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nChris Brose\n\nChris Brose’s career as a bowling alley proprietor was less about opportunity and more about expectation.\n\n“When I was finishing high school, I had some interest in horticulture,” Brose said. “But my dad, seeing the nature of things, said, ‘You’re coming to work with me, boy.”\n\nBrose’s dad, Bob, and two partners opened El-Ra Bowl in Janesville in 1959. Chris, a Parker High School graduate who is now 57, was taught at a young age how to do his part in the family business.\n\n“I started my training under the tutelage of Rosey Kemp (Vine) and was learning how to sling drinks when I was 18—even though Elmer Silbernagl (one of the other original owners) had me making martinis for the ancient gals in the Imperial Lounge when I was 6ish,” Brose said. “The rest is history.”\n\nChris has three brothers—John, Kurt and Gary—and one sister, Kathy, who all have worked at El Ray at one point or another. Chris’ own family includes his wife of 35 years, Denise, and five kids—Ben, Rob, Rich, Duncan and Dan.\n\nTo learn more about El Ra, stop by the alley at 1942 Center Ave., Janesville, visit ElRaBowl.com or call 608-757-3020.\n\n1. What’s your favorite bowling-related film? Why do you say that? None. “Kingpin” is the only one I can think of, and I didn’t like it too much. It had a negative view of bowling as a sport, to which the Dude can’t abide. Is “The Big Lebowski” a choice?\n\n2. When I was a younger, league bowling for kids, adults and couples was a big deal. In your experience, has the level of involvement increased, stayed the same or declined? The level of involvement obviously has declined due to overall societal changes, much more competition for recreational time and dollars, and an explosion in choices for what to do with your free time.\n\n3. You have bumper bowling and glow bowling at El Ra Bowl. What other steps have you taken to help bowling remain a popular pastime? Reinvesting profits back into our center. Folks want to have a modern, like-new place to hang. We fancy El Ra as the south-side country club. Also, we put a lot of effort into youth bowling, in-school bowling programs, youth leagues and tournaments, high school bowling and adult/youth leagues. Some people think youth are the future ...\n\n4. In your experience, what’s more common: picking up a 7-10 split or rolling a 300 game? 300 game, hands down. Lane conditions and modern balls have made hitting the pocket with authority more likely. 7—10 conversions are nearly impossible. The odds are better of a lucky bounce out of the pit.\n\n5. What is your most prized possession? Health. My family’s and friends’ health as well as my own.\n\n6. You have two hours of free time. What do you do? I like to vary my activities, but I always enjoy listening to and learning about music.\n\n7. What is one item you simply couldn’t live without? Laughter. I can’t imagine a life without a fair dose of levity.\n\n8. Let’s talk lane wax. Why is it so important, and how often does it have to be applied? Wax? You’re killing me, Schmalz! Oil reduces friction. Oil applied in a certain (top secret) fashion can give the ball guidance. In recreational bowling, this equals maximum guidance within the rules. When bowling is a sport, it provides contestants with a varying degree of challenge. Depending on our schedule, we will oil between 1 to 3 times per day.\n\n9. What’s the one pizza topping you absolutely won’t touch? That topping doesn’t exist.\n\n10. What fruit or vegetable do you absolutely hate? Not too fond of Brussels sprouts that are boiled for an hour and served with vinegar.\n\n11. What was your first car, and how did you get it? ‘68 Nova. Paid $500, drove it for a year, got hit by another vehicle, got $500 in insurance money and drove it for another year. Then I traded it in for $300 bucks. Yes, I’m a little frugal.\n\n12. In your opinion, is bowling a sport or a pastime? Bowling is both. You can go bowling just for fun with no pressure and have a great time. Competitive bowling requires much skill including hand/eye coordination, accuracy, consistency, endurance, experience with lane play, etc.\n\n13. What are the things I need to consider when I’m in the market for a new bowling ball? If you bowl mainly for fun, maybe you just want a ball that fits well and is a good weight for you. If that’s the case, and you don’t want to make it hook, then save your dough and go for a hard-plastic ball. They’re less expensive and are very durable. If you want to get the ball to hook and give you more power, then you want a performance ball. These come in several price points, all of which are more bucks than hard plastic.\n\n14. When you think of the 1980s, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Got married, got kids, got a mortgage …. oh boy.\n\n15. Who is the best bowler you’ve ever seen? Hard question. I am going to go with Earl Anthony. He was so smooth and accurate, had a simple game, and he simply won 43 titles.\n\n16. Why are the rental shoes at bowling alleys always so ugly? A friend once told me it’s to keep people from stealing them. Your friend is correct. We want to have the rentals stand out, so if you lace ‘em up without renting them, we can call the C.S.I. (crappy shoe investigation) team.\n\n17. Where is your favorite place to unwind? Quetico Provincial Park (in Northern Ontario, Canada). 1,800 square miles of wilderness. It’s a pain in the a#% to get there, but the beauty, sense of adventure and solitude is unmatched anywhere on the planet.\n\n18. El Ra is a pretty unique name. How did it come about? Some people think it means “the sunny boliche” spot, but actually, the original owners were ELmer Silbernagl, RAy Shaughnessy and BOb Brose, thus the original logo was EL RA BOwl.\n\n19. What was your first job? Worst job? Sorting empty beer bottles at The Evergreen, a 1960s tavern/restaurant that sat across the street from El Ra. Brown, clear, green, 7-ounce, 8-ounce, 12-ounce ... the idea of a marketing niche is not new. But as I think back right now, I can’t think of any that were too bad. I like to work. Of course, cleaning up bodily fluids ...\n\n20. What’s the craziest bowling alley mishap you’ve ever seen? During the Janesville City Tournament in 1979. The lanes were inspected just prior to the first squad bowled and were found not to be compliant (an employee made a mistake with the antiquated oiler of the day) as the lanes were too dry. My dad went ballistic (there may have been a personality conflict with the inspector) There was no time to re-oil the lanes, so my dad’s solution was to take a bug sprayer and, standing from the foul line, douse the lanes with oil. There was a fog of oil in the air across all 16 lanes, and you had to squint to see the pins. It was unbelievable. You could not get the ball to wrinkle that day. I happen to have bowled in that 1st squad myself, and I had a 279 in the first game. It was the highest game of the tournament that year (but not the highest series, too bad).\n\nJanesville's Brian Post establishing himself in Bassmaster Open professional fishing series\n\nBy ERIC SCHMOLDT Special to The Gazette Oct 3, 2022\n\nJANESVILLE—When Brian Post launches his white and black Falcon F20 Predator fishing boat onto Lake Hartwell in Anderson, South Carolina, he’ll be feeling a little less pressure and lot more confident.\n\nPost, 39, from Janesville, is in his third season of fishing professionally in the Bassmaster Open series. Lake Hartwell will mark the eighth of nine stops during what is his second time competing in every Open event on the schedule.\n\nAt the last stop in Louisiana, Post finished 15th in a field of 200 anglers. The $3,740 check pushed Post’s earnings on the year past the break-even point, offsetting his entry fees for the season.\n\nSo in the final two tournaments, Post goes in feeling like has nothing to lose.\n\n“It takes the pressure off and lets you fish a little more relaxed,” said Post, who will fish in the Southern Open at Lake Hartwell from Thursday to Saturday. “If you go into this gig thinking, ‘I’ve got to cash a check here,’ then you might as well stay home.”\n\nThat’s just one of the lessons Post has learned over the course of his first 20 Bassmaster events. He tasted great success right away, persevered through choppy waters in his first full season in 2021 and is seeing persistence pay off in 2022.\n\nEarly highs and lows\n\nThese days, Post isn’t ashamed to use the word “lucky.”\n\nBut in the summer of 2020, when he put together a breakthrough tournament in just his second try, he couldn’t help but feel he was right where he belonged.\n\n“In 2020, we were just getting our feet wet with the four (Open) tournaments,” said Post, who has been fishing in tournaments locally for about two decades. “And now, looking back, (the Open on Sam Rayburn Reservoir in Jasper, Texas) was definitely a lucky event.”\n\nBecause he was in the top 12 after the first two days, Post earned a spot in the third and final day. And his 12th-place finish out of 215 anglers earned him more than $5,000.\n\nThat was all the evidence Post needed to decide he would fish the entire Open series—nine tournaments—in 2021.\n\nBut Post learned that making the finals wasn’t nearly as easy as he made it look in his debut season. His best finish in the nine tournaments last year was 23rd place.\n\n“I’ve chalked that up as a learning experience,” Post said. “One thing I’ve always done to try and relax is put five fish in the boat, regardless of size, and then go find the big ones and upgrade. But at this level, if you do that, you’re already behind.\n\n“I learned you can’t try and do what everybody else is doing. Just fish your way.”\n\nLessons out of water, too\n\nIn professional fishing, finding success on the water is only part of the equation.\n\nTo support the costs of gas, lodging, equipment and more, Post and his fellow pros rely on sponsorships.\n\nPost has leveraged his two decades of tournament fishing into several equipment deals. And his work as a general contractor has helped him forge relationships that have led to local sponsors like Marling Lumber, Bee Line Alignment, Rock River Marina, J&D Car Care and Post Builders.\n\nBut further sponsorships sometimes require getting a little creative, and for those Brian leans on his wife, Rachael.\n\n“The whole social media thing is not my game; my wife does all that,” Brian Post said. “We were also able to put together a really cool packet with different levels of sponsorships that we took to a lot of local businesses.\n\n“And then you’ll see a lot of decals on my boat that are just names, and all of those came from shirt sales that we did.”\n\nThat campaign was so successful that the Posts are running it again for the 2023 season. Fans can visit bpostfishing.com, and for as little as $10 can have their name on a decal on the boat next year.\n\nThrough the ups and downs of the past two tournament seasons, Post has also learned to maintain perspective even at the low moments.\n\n“I’ve made a lot of new friends and met a lot of new people,” he said. “This year, expenses are a little bit higher with everything going on, but it’s been a lot of fun.”\n\nBack in the finals\n\nTasting success again has made the 2022 Bassmaster Open season even more fun for Post.\n\nOn the James River in Virginia in April, Post earned his spot back in the finals for the second time in his Bassmaster career. These days, that takes being in the top 10 in the standings after the first two days. Post was ninth, and he moved up one spot on the third day to finish eighth and collect a check worth $10,500.\n\nAfter two solid days, Post said he went back to one of his go-to spots on the third day only to find the water had muddied and the fish weren’t biting.\n\n“I just kept trying and kept switching baits and then at one point I found a tree where I caught nine fish in 20 casts,” Post said. “That event just really fit my style. It was fun.”\n\nEarlier in the year, Post opened the season by finishing in the money (top 40 finishers) at an event in Florida.\n\nAnd though it hasn’t been all trophy fish and honey holes for Post, his most recent 15th-place finish now has him in the top 30 in the seasonlong points standings out of more than 530 entrants, including nearly 100 who Post said are competing in all nine events.\n\n“This year has been a really good year but also an emotional roller coaster,” Post said. “I’m either on top or on the bottom. It’s a lot, but I’m ultra-competitive and I love it. I’m gaining confidence, for sure.”\n\nSo what’s next on Post’s list of goals? A top-three finish in either overall points, or within any of the three regional divisions, would land him a spot in the Bassmaster Elite series. Or winning an Open event would mean a spot in the prestigious Bassmaster Classic tournament.\n\n“Ultimately, I would love to make it to the Elites,” Post said. “That’d be an accomplishment.”\n\nAt this point, that might be too tall an order in 2022. But with two events left, he’ll be firing up his Mercury Pro XS 250 motor feeling like he has nothing to lose.\n\n20Q: Catching up with theatrical lighting legend Dawn Kenseth\n\nGreg Little Jul 18, 2018\n\nEditor’s note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nDawn Kenseth\n\nJanesville native and Craig High School graduate Dawn Kenseth is a head electrician/stage lighting technician for touring Broadway musicals and regional theater. Some of her favorite past tours include Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas,” “Something Rotten,” “American Idiot,” “Mamma Mia” and “Avenue Q.”\n\nKenseth has worked in hundreds of theaters in 49 states, in Canada, Japan and the U.K. Her nontouring work includes the Spoleto Festival USA (South Carolina), Ogunquit Playhouse (Maine), and Chautauqua Theater Company (New York).\n\nKenseth is a member of IATSE (stagehands union) and holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater tech/design with a minor in dance from Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. Her current position is as head electrician with “Ain’t Too Proud—The Life and Times of the Temptations” in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Toronto.\n\nTo learn more about Kenseth’s work, visit DawnKenseth.com.\n\n1. How did you end up in the lighting game? I started doing backstage work in the Craig High School drama guild and with Park City Dance Studio back in the late ‘90s. I found it to be a lot of fun playing with the lights and the light board. Before I knew it, I had a college degree in tech theater and was getting hired by summer stock theaters. A college classmate of mine recommended me for a touring job with “Rent” in 2006, and I’ve been mostly working in Broadway musical tour lighting ever since.\n\n2. When you were a kid, did you dream of growing up one day and becoming a lighting specialist on theater productions? I had no idea this was a viable career option until college. As a kid, I went through a long, meandering list of what I wanted to be. Teacher, TV meteorologist and architect are some that I remember.\n\n3. Is theater lighting one of those things that, if done well, goes unrecognized, or is it important that theater patrons notice it? Both options can be right, depending on the intent of the designer and director. Many design decisions might not be consciously noticed by an audience member, but they do impact the audiences’ experience. Color, shadows, brightness ... these things affect you in the same way a bright, sunny day makes you feel different than a gloomy, cloudy day—whether you realize it or not. Then there are the moments when lighting is an important storytelling device, such as with dramatic spotlights or ballyhooing lights.\n\n4. What is the most elaborate, challenging light set-up you’ve ever worked on? In 2016, the Spoleto Festival USA did a huge production of “Porgy and Bess.” It was the grand re-opening for the Gaillard Center performance hall after a long remodeling process. It was apparently a big deal, and it felt like we had lights everywhere you could possibly put them. The overhead lights were so high up that we rented a boom lift so we could reach and focus them above the set of Charleston row houses. The massive scenery also had interior lighting in all sorts of windows, doorways and under balconies. It might not have been the most technically complex show I’ve worked, but it definitely was one of the biggest in terms of scale.\n\n5. Some chefs don’t like to cook away from their restaurant, and some writers avoid reading after they complete big projects. How do you break from work? Sit in the dark? If by “sit in the dark” you mean “catch up on sleep,” then sure. When I’m not actively on a tour, I’ll be either at home bingeing on TV or on some crazy road trip adventure. I tend to stay mostly away from the theater but will occasionally pop in to see other shows and visit friends who work on them. However, I don’t experience shows the same way as an average audience member. I can’t help but notice what lighting gear they’re using or how they’re using it. It’s really hard to turn off those observations.\n\n6. If you cook/bake, what dish do you consider your specialty? I’ve been traveling for many years and living in hotels most of my adult life, so my culinary skills are really abysmal. However, I have succeeded in making grilled cheese and quesadillas using a hotel iron before.\n\n7. You have experience working with dry ice. Can’t it be kind of dangerous to work with? Indeed, dry ice can be dangerous if you don’t understand what it is. First, it’s dangerously cold even by Wisconsin standards, so I use thick gloves when loading it into the machines. It’s also important to make sure nobody lies down for a nap in the carbon dioxide-rich fog. However, that low-lying fog covering the stage floor is an awesome-looking theatrical trick for scary dungeons or fantasy dance sequences.\n\n8. Share some of the most recent innovations in theatrical lighting. LED stage lighting fixtures are the biggest recent innovation. The quality of these lighting fixtures is getting better and brighter every day, all while using less power than the incandescent sources we’re used to. Some big shows are now being completely lit by LED, which is something that would have been nearly impossible 10 years ago. In addition, smaller LED strips can easily be bought and built into custom creations. We used to put in some rope light to add some accent lighting on scenery, but we now can put LED strips on instead, which offers the ability to change colors and make all sorts of effects.\n\n9. What word do you always struggle to spell correctly? Receipts. I’m always getting the “I” and “E” screwed up.\n\n10. Do you have any superstitions? Theater people can be very superstitious, but I find I’m a little more practical and don’t buy into a lot of it. I do avoid saying “Macbeth” inside the theater though, mostly out of respect for others who might be more superstitious than I am. It’s rumored that saying it inside a theater will cause disaster, which is why many will just refer to it as “the Scottish play.”\n\n11. I can buy a 60-watt light bulb at the local hardware store. I’m guessing the lights you use are not that inexpensive or as readily available. What are the costs associated with light repair/replacement with the projects on which you work? We also have to replace bulbs (we call them lamps) for many of the lights we use. For the big moving lights, we usually replace all the lamps at the same time and before they burn out. Those lamps can cost $100 or $200 apiece, so it’s a big expense to do all of them at the same time. A good producer will budget for that cost when planning the show (while a bad one will scowl at the “surprise” expense of $2,000 to maintain the lighting). Some of the other expenses of running a show include periodically replacing the gel (the plastic piece that changes the color of the lights) and the gallons of fog, haze, snow or bubble fluids we might be using.\n\n12. People would be surprised to find out that I: Technically still live at home with my parents. Since I’m usually on the road or working at a theater company that provides temporary housing, it doesn’t make sense for me to keep a house or apartment. Thankfully, my parents have been supportive and haven’t kicked me out yet—probably because I’m only home for a few weeks a year (or maybe it’s because I can get them tickets to shows).\n\n13. What is the one item that, when you’re at the grocery store, goes into your cart whether you need it or not? My newest obsession is LaCroix water. I’m trying to quit my soda habit, and LaCroix has proven to be a great help in that endeavor.\n\n14. Does your company provide all lighting for projects or supplement what a theater already has to work with? A touring Broadway musical may play dozens of different theaters over the course of a tour. We need to create the same show every time, and we can’t rely on all those theaters having the right equipment. Therefore, the show will bring all of the lighting equipment (along with the scenery, props, costumes, audio, etc.) from city to city using semitrailers. My last tour (“White Christmas”) traveled in six semis, which includes about one and a half of lighting. Most of the lighting gear is rented from stage lighting rental companies, but the show will also purchase some unique items that are specific to the show, such as any lighting built into the set.\n\n15. What has been your favorite venue in which to work? There are so many that this alone could fill the whole article. Here’s one: The Orpheum in Memphis, Tennessee. First of all, the theater is right at the end of Beale Street, so we are next to all that fabulous food and live music when we aren’t in the theater. Secondly, the volunteer ushers host one of the best between-show meals for all the visiting touring shows. It’s a gigantic potluck-style buffet of all homemade Southern cooking. All these retiree/grandmother-figure ushers feed the tour staff as if we hadn’t eaten a proper meal in months. It’s so delicious.\n\n16. Do you collect anything? I’ve got a lot of hotel pens, soaps and shampoos. I don’t need these things, but somehow I keep taking them.\n\n17. What is the wallpaper on your cellphone right now? My lock screen is a picture of my Mustang. I love my car.\n\n18. If you could learn to do anything, what would it be? I’d like to learn more metal fabrication and welding skills at some point. It’s not really lighting-related, but I’d like to be able to make silly lawn art sculptures, fix race cars, or who knows what else it would come in handy for.\n\n19. If you won the lottery, what is the first thing you would do? I think I’d fund some vintage theater restorations and upgrades ... from my new beachside bungalow.\n\n20. Is it safe to say that lighting professionals such as yourself always have the coolest homes at Christmastime? Oh my gosh—it’s a chance to nerd out with our technology outside of the theater. Last year, a colleague of mine had his Christmas tree set up on the Internet. Friends could log in to change the colors or flash the lights on the tree while seeing what it was doing on a webcam.\n\nJanesville native Fredricks kept tabs on Olympics while manning post in Salt Lake\n\nBy Eric Schmoldt eschmoldt@gazettextra.com\n\nMar 8, 2018\n\nBefore this year, the last time Tucker Fredricks didn’t compete in the Winter Olympics was in 2012, when they took place in Salt Lake City.\n\nAs coincidence would have it, when the world’s best speedskaters were competing in Pyeonchang, South Korea, last month, Fredricks was back home—in Salt Lake.\n\nSomeone had to man the fort for those still training and practicing at the Utah Olympic Oval.\n\n“I stayed back. The national team coaches and one of the transition coaches (from Salt Lake) had some athletes over at the Games, so I stayed back and took care of my team and a couple other athletes while they were gone,” said Fredricks, now a high-level head coach, in a phone conversation Wednesday. “I wouldn’t say it felt weird, but it was definitely a little different watching it on TV.\n\n“I hadn’t watched a Winter Olympics on TV for a while.”\n\nWith two kids at home, Fredricks didn’t have a lot of time to take in curling or luge, but he said he didn’t miss a speedskating event.\n\n“I think I was either teammates with all of them (the Olympic qualifiers) or coached all of them at some point,” Fredricks said. “So I knew all of them pretty well.”\n\nFredricks competed in the 500 meters during his three trips to the Olympics in 2006, 2010 and 2014. He is one of two Janesville natives to ever compete in the Olympics, and he captured 30 medals—11 gold—on the World Cup circuit in his career.\n\nTeam USA won just one long-track speedskating medal in Pyeonchang, a bronze in women’s team pursuit.\n\n“I thought, actually, the team did quite well,” Fredrick said. “A couple of them were just on the wrong side of the tenth (of a second). There were some really close times to the podium, and they were just on the wrong side.\n\n“It could have been a different story on any given day.”\n\nWhile the Olympics ended a week and a half ago, Fredricks’ busy schedule continues through this weekend. Salt Lake plays host to the World Junior Championships, an event that Fredricks knows all too well as he won gold in 500 meters at the 2003 event. Fredricks said three skaters from his main team will be competing.\n\nHe was also in Milwaukee—where his speedskating career began at the Pettit National Ice Center—for the U.S. Olympic Trials during the first week of January.\n\n“It was nice to finally have it back there,” said Fredricks, a 2002 Janesville Craig High graduate. “Through my career, they had one Olympic Trials that I was too young, or too slow, to compete in. The rest of them were in Salt Lake City.”\n\nFredricks is now a long track FAST team head coach at the oval in Salt Lake. Depending on the season, he coaches junior, development and elite skaters ages 16-33, he said.\n\n“I get a mix of a bunch of different athletes,” said Fredricks, who has been coaching since his last Olympic competition in Sochi, Russia. “Each year, I’m learning a lot and getting more and more comfortable, understanding this side of it a little bit more. Just like an athlete, there’s peaks and valleys through a season, but on a whole, it’s the next closest thing for me to skating, so I’m really enjoying it and it’s fun to give back to the sport.”\n\nFredricks has high hopes heading into this week’s World Junior competition.\n\n“I’m pretty excited,” he said. “We have a pretty good group this year. They’re still young. I think it’s only two of the athletes’ last year as a junior, or maybe three out of the 10. The rest are fairly young and going pretty quick for their age. It should be a pretty good showing.”\n\nWho knows? Perhaps for a young skater or two it’ll be a step toward competing in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. Or, for Fredricks, a step toward returning to the Winter Games as a coach.\n\nEric Schmoldt is sports editor of The Gazette.

John Lewis.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders drawn as Ernie from “Sesame Street.”\n\nSimple pieces of whimsy featuring tin cans, tomatoes and dates.\n\nAll come from the mind of Catherine Moore, a highly-regarded freelance illustrator whose clients have included The Washington Post, Ralph Lauren, Men’s Health Magazine and more. Her work also has been featured numerous times in the international illustration quarterly Creative Quarterly, twice in the Atlanta AIGA Poster Show and also in the ICON Illustration Conference Art Show.\n\nThe Janesville native, who graduated from Craig High School in 2003, now makes her home in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition to a bachelor’s degree in psychology, she holds a Master of Fine Arts degree in illustration from the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in Savannah, Georgia, and works as an assistant art professor at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, Georgia.\n\nAway from work, Moore lives with her partner, Carlos; their year-old daughter, Ramona, and their dog-hter, Marta.\n\nTo learn more, visit CatherineAMoore.com, or search for @catamooreart on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Dribble.\n\n1. In looking at your work, I really like your “Ernie Sanders” illustration. Do you have any personal favorite projects you’ve worked on? The “Arrested Development” series will always be a favorite. I watched hours of the show to get the right expressions.\n\n2. From where do you draw inspiration/ideas for your illustrations? Most of my personal work revolves around portraits of political figures and entertainment celebrities, editorial social justice issues and plenty of puns.\n\n3. What is your preferred medium to express your artistry? I’ve always preferred graphite … grayscale work was my first love. In grad school, I learned how to watercolor and taught myself the pastel/colored pencil combo I’ve used for my color portraits over the past few years.\n\n4. What is currently the wallpaper on your cellphone? It’s buttons on the control panel of one of the Chernobyl nuclear reactors. I was fascinated by the HBO series and recently finished reading “Midnight in Chernobyl” by Adam Higginbotham.\n\n5. Who is your favorite Muppet? Sam Eagle, who, as noted on HottestHeadsOfState.com, bears a striking resemblance to Warren G. Harding.\n\n6. You have had your work featured in some prominent publications. What would you define as your big break? My packaging work for Paris Baguette USA generated a lot of future work, including my work for Ralph Lauren. However, I’ve always loved editorial work, so being commissioned to draw Justice Anthony Kennedy for The Washington Post was a real treat. The design team did an incredible job laying out the full-page image.\n\n7. Are there any other illustrators whose work you admire? Do you incorporate aspects of their style into your own work in any way? Too many. Christoph Niemann is an all-time favorite for his visual puns. Although it’s rather cliche, seeing the Norman Rockwell exhibition in the Guggenheim (Museum in New York City) was an influence in visual storytelling through realism. I’m also continually influenced by my peers and friends from grad school who have been doing exceptional work in illustration.\n\n8. Can you name a popular television show you either have never seen an episode of or that you don’t understand why it is popular? I couldn’t get into “Parks and Recreation.” It was too much like “The Office.” I’m very sorry, everyone else in the world.\n\n9. Your illustration of President Jimmy Carter is in the collection at his presidential library and museum. How did that come to be? It came from Atlanta being a small town that loves its heroes. A friend of mine worked for the Young African Leaders Initiative and had a meeting for their group scheduled with President Carter. After I completed the portrait, she offered to gift him a print of it at their meeting. That print hangs in the Carter Center next to my friend Annalise Kaylor’s photograph of him, which I used with her permission as the reference. Through another photographer friend, I made contact with his presidential library and museum, which also has a print hanging at the entrance to the research library. It’s truly the honor of my career to have these portraits displayed.\n\n10. Do you consider yourself political, or do you simply see opportunities for expressive illustrations in particular politicians? I think political personalities and their images provide the storytelling element people need to get behind a political idea. People are compelling in a way that dry political theories are not. I also don’t think anyone can ever completely align their personal political beliefs with another person’s. For the most part, in my personal work, I draw politicians whose stories I admire, even if I don’t 100% line up with them politically.\n\n11. At the grocery store, what item always goes in your cart whether you need it or not? Siggi’s yogurt. Low sugar, high protein!\n\n12. Before acquiring your Master of Fine Arts degree in illustration, you earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology. Why did you not pursue a career in psychology? The question is why did I not initially pursue a career in art. I did not understand how an undergraduate degree in art could translate into a job, and I also wanted to explore a lot of interests in college. However, I finished college without a job and with a withering connection to my calling. I knew that if I didn’t take a leap to pursue art then, it would be something I’d regret forever. I applied to SCAD, was accepted, and it was the most important leap of my life.\n\n13. If you could learn to do anything, what would it be? Dance.\n\n14. Have any of the human subjects of your illustrations reached out to you with comments about your work? I met a bar owner in Atlanta who told me (“Arrested Development” actor) David Cross was a regular at her restaurant and offered to give a print of my portrait of him to him next time he came in. Instead, he signed it and gave it back to me. That was pretty cool. The real Piper Kerman (author of “Orange is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison”) also retweeted my illustration of Piper Chapman from the “Orange is the New Black” series on Netflix. Also pretty cool!\n\n15. In addition to being a freelance illustrator, you also are an assistant art professor at Georgia Gwinnett College in Lawrenceville, Georgia. What is your teaching philosophy when it comes to art? The most important connection students will make is that between art and the communion of a diverse society, in which they will encounter viewpoints different from their own. Through all of my teaching, I hope to help students create meaningful and truthful work while participating in a cycle of inspiration, creativity and collaboration.\n\n16. As a writer, I know it’s sometimes hard to be creative on demand. Do you also sometimes struggle to be creative when deadlines approach for your illustrations? Creativity is, like any other skill, a practice. The adrenaline of a deadline fuels creative solutions. However, that said, over half of my jobs come to me with the art director already knowing exactly what he or she wants.\n\n17. Do you collect anything? I have a small coin collection of small coins.\n\n18. Describe your creative process. Being able to freely sketch, without edits or judgment, is the most important skill to develop for the creative process. Be able to open your ideas up to peer critique and allow that feedback to push your ideas further.\n\n19. Have you ever had a moment when you questioned your career entirely? Never. This career is a marriage—you have to work for it, but it is sustained by a constantly renewed passion.\n\n20. What advice do you have for any young illustrators who might want to follow in your footsteps? Proficiency follows practice, practice follows passion. Put your energy into proficiency in your craft, not pursuing a paycheck. Your calling lies in the intersection of what you love, what you’re good at, and what the world needs.\n\nEditor’s note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nAlex Burkart\n\nAlex Burkart is a theater artist who grew up in Janesville and now resides in Los Angeles. He holds an Master of Fine Arts degree in Performance Pedagogy from Virginia Commonwealth University and is currently a visiting assistant professor of theater at Beloit College this fall.\n\nBurkart has authored three full-length plays: “Atlas Pit” (which received a world premiere in 2016 with the Los Angeles New Court Theatre), “El Ciclope” (which was a finalist for the 2018 Eugene O’Neill Theater Center’s National Playwrights Conference and was a top-eight finalist among 1,200 submissions in the 2018 Moss Hart and Kitty Carlisle Hart New Play Initiative), and his latest effort, “Stone Point.”\n\nBurkart’s acting and directing work has been seen across the country at numerous professional and equity stages, and he has taught classes and workshops in performance at Virginia Commonwealth University, Adams State University, SETC, Beloit College and Zak Barnett Studios in Hollywood, California.\n\nTo learn more, visit AlexBurkart.com.\n\n1. You’re a twin (Burkart’s brother, Nathan, is executive director at the Janesville Performing Arts Center). Share a situation where being a twin is beneficial and one where it’s not. Besides being able to use each other’s IDs to get into a bar when the other has forgotten his (it’s worked several times in Los Angeles), the twin-ship has opened some amazing doors creatively. Ultimately, doors in the entertainment world are easier to open if you have something about you that is … well, different. Mine just so happened to be wired-in since birth. This has been a double-edged sword, however. It took me a while to identify who I was apart from being a twin (artistically), as I’ve often struggled to find my own individual voice, opinion, poetics, etc. I became quite used to thinking of us (me and Nathan) as a team rather than as individual persons. I think that was a unique challenge to overcome that proved to be enlightening.\n\n2. You’ve been living in California for some time. Do you miss Wisconsin, or have you gotten used to year-round sunshine? I love the “magic” in California’s air. It’s easy to believe you’re constantly on the cusp of something life-changing. That said, it does tend to be misleading, and I often miss the humbleness and friendliness of Wisconsin. I miss the change in seasons, and I miss my family and roots. Perhaps that’s why I tend to visit a fictional Wisconsin so often in my plays. My creative child constantly drives my imagination back home. Maybe one day I’ll come back for good.\n\n3. Your second play, “El Ciclope,” has received a lot of attention. What’s it about? The play takes place in the same world and in a parallel time frame as “Atlas Pit” (my first full-length play). “El Ciclope” centers on a homecoming queen (Courtney) who is failing Spanish, so her teacher sets her up with a tutor: a teenage, first-generation, Mexican-American foster child (Mateo) who teaches by giving her stories written in Spanish that she has to decode. The stories depict horrific and tragic events in Mateo’s life, and Courtney comes to discover the stories are true. The process ultimately leads to an astonishing transformation of a one-time homecoming queen into her now unrecognizable self. It’s about “otherness” and how embracing our differences can be liberating. I dig it.\n\n4. You’re back this summer to teach theater at Beloit College. How did that opportunity come about, and what do you hope to gain from it? I hold an MFA in performance pedagogy, which is a fancy way of saying I teach performance (acting and directing) for colleges and universities. I’ve been teaching at an acting school in L.A. for the last two years, but I’ve been itching to get back into a collegiate setting. I learned one of my past mentors, Amy Sarno, was actually taking a sabbatical last December, so I decided to throw my hat in the ring. I’m lucky they picked me. I’m ultimately looking to gain more experience working in the liberal arts college setting, working with a diverse group of students, learning from their stories and hoping they learn a little bit from my experiences as well.\n\n5. What first drew you to a life in theater? My impulse is to say my mother made me do it (letting me, as an 8-year-old, audition for shows with SpotLight on Kids), and I just happened to be relatively good at it, so I figured why not. I used to only be an actor, but that’s changed a lot since I left and found my own voice. Looking back, the real answer is probably that I always gravitated towards telling stories. I used to draw and write comic books with my mom and dad growing up, and I always loved using my imagination. I eventually found a way to put it to good use and be productive with it.\n\n6. When I’m not busy working on my career, I really enjoy: Reading Stephen King novels (I’m a junkie). I used to be crazy about “Goosebumps” growing up. R.L. Stine was my jam, and I was always the one to have the first copy out of all my friends in elementary school. With my love for horror, it didn’t take me long to gravitate towards King. His incredible character development didn’t hurt either. I also love the gym. I go into this zone there where the world is on pause. It’s kind of relieving with all of the hustle and bustle that is going on in L.A.\n\n7. If you could meet anyone living or dead, who would it be? My future children. I’d love to see what a mess I made of them.\n\n8. When it comes to acting, do you prefer doing it yourself or do you get more out of teaching? I get so much more out of teaching. It was weird; I developed this over self-consciousness with my acting work where I started to beat myself up about every little thing. My process became a selfish one, and I became concerned with my ability to break through and climb to the top of this seemingly endless Hollywood career ladder. Teaching however, is completely different. It is never about me in that classroom; it is always about my students, in the most positive sense. And instead of wallowing in my own failures, I’m celebrating theirs. I’m giving them keys that help them unlock doorways into understanding themselves, others, and this world. It is amazing, and I’m really into it.\n\n9. Ever been star struck? I nearly threw up once when I walked around a corner in Macy’s and saw Steve Carell trying on a jacket. I’m such a fan of his work. It can be funny, tragic, and everything else all at once. His performances are incredibly human. I’m insanely jealous.\n\n10. Everyone knows struggling actors have to start out waiting tables. How did you pay the bills early in your career? I waited tables. Just as you said: “Everyone knows struggling actors have to start out waiting tables.” It’s so very true. It’s flexible, pays good money, and you talk to a lot of people.\n\n11. What is your dream project? I’d love to work on a play of mine in New York City. I write mostly for the voices of people I know, so the cast and director would all be my usual suspects. Of course, there are the ongoing politics that help give a play more traction in a city like that, but honestly, dream-wise, I like to work with artists I respect and trust.\n\n12. What is the screensaver on your cell phone right now? It’s a picture of my wife and me on my wedding day. It’s there because she’d probably change it back if it was anything else.\n\n13. In your opinion, what is the single greatest asset most successful playwrights share? Honesty. If a playwright can be honest with himself or herself, the voices of the characters and the worlds they live in will be successful. It doesn’t matter what type of play you write as long as it is honest.\n\n14. Share something “California” that Wisconsinites wouldn’t understand, and vice versa. I had a job once where one day it took me three hours to go 20 miles. The traffic is real. One day, my air conditioner went out in my car. I figured that must be what hell is like: sitting on the 101 in a black car without air conditioning for three hours. California people never understand cheese curds. Deep-fried balls of cheese aren’t really in their diet plans.\n\n15. Ever sung karaoke? I met my wife at a karaoke bar. I sang “Mack the Knife” (I’m a sucker for that older stuff), and the rest was history.\n\n16. Your plays seem to carry very heavy subject matter (drugs, sexuality, death). Why no comedy? I just write what comes out. There are always moments that have humor in my plays, but I don’t write for genre. I write about what I notice in life. Perhaps one more funny than the others will pop out eventually, but none yet.\n\n17. Do you believe in karma? Sure. I mostly believe in it because I want it to be true. Those who give out good vibes should be rewarded for that, and vice-versa for the opposite people in this world.\n\n18. Share the best piece of advice about theater you’ve ever received. I had a teacher who once told me my acting work was a really good coat, and that the only problem was my coat was turned inside-out and I was showing people all of my seams. That teacher said my choices ultimately looked like choices rather than coming out of truth and honesty. It was the best constructive criticism I’ve ever received. We as performers have a mission to give our audiences experiences, and we should never expect them to see our processes. It’s a part of the magic.\n\n19. Has there ever been a time when you almost walked away from acting/directing? After a terrible audition for “Modern Family” where I forgot all my lines, I fell apart crying at the steering wheel of my car (so much happens in cars in Los Angeles!). I decided to drive straight to the beach, where I sat with my now wife and told her I was giving up. I decided to go back and get my MFA instead. It was there I wrote “Atlas Pit,” and I realized my audition catastrophe was all for a reason.\n\n20. Who inspires you? Those who are free. Those who aren’t. Those who fight. Those who love. Those who hate. Those who dream.\n\nNew Minnesota mayor is Janesville product\n\nBy Frank Schultz fschultz@gazettextra.com\n\nEvery day after leaving St. Mary’s School in Janesville, Maria Regan Gonzalez would walk to her mother’s place of work, the YWCA, and help out by watching kids or cleaning.\n\n“Growing up as a kid, I saw my mom and dad extremely involved in our community, and they taught us the values of community service,” Regan Gonzalez said Wednesday in a telephone interview.\n\nShe never considered politics for a career, but she said her parents’ example led her on a path to being elected mayor of Richfield, Minnesota, on Nov. 6.\n\nHer afternoons at the Janesville YWCA—located near the courthouse back then but now on the city’s south side—came at a time when the city was seeing an influx of Spanish speakers, many of whom looked to the YWCA for help. Her mother, Belem Regan Gonzalez, was the organization’s Hispanic outreach coordinator.\n\n“Of course I was inspired by my mom, who just works tirelessly in our community to help people get resources,” she said.\n\nMaria graduated from Craig High School in 2004. She had been involved in the Human Relations Club with an inspiring teacher, Santo Carfora. She was one of three members of the Gay-Straight Alliance and wrote a column about social and environmental issues for the school newspaper, she recalled.\n\nVolunteering “was just what I did. It was a part of my everyday life,” she said.\n\nHer classmates voted her most likely to change the world, and while she makes no claims to being on that track, she is dedicated to serving her constituents, many of whom come to her regularly because she looks like them and speaks their native language, she said.\n\nRegan Gonzalez graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in international relations and Spanish.\n\nShe eventually took a job with the city of Richfield, where she bought a house, helping connect residents with city services. She was struck by the opportunity to make change through local government, something she had known little about.\n\nWhen an opening on the city council came up two years ago, she ran against an established candidate, getting 57 percent of the vote.\n\nWhen nobody ran for mayor two years later, she was encouraged to run. She won without opposition.\n\nRegan Gonzalez will be a mayor in a city of 36,000 that is governed similarly to Janesville: A city manager runs the operations, while four council members and a mayor set policy and direction.\n\nThe landlocked city has a school district in which 72 percent of students are people of color, she said.\n\nRichfield has been named the Twin Cities’ best suburb. It’s a hot real estate market with no vacant land, so re-development is common. Homeowners sometimes find their neighborhoods transformed by multi-unit rental housing, she said.\n\nBusinesses are attracted to Richfield, she said, “but we don’t want to price our families out of their homes and our community, and unfortunately that’s dictated by the market. We can put protections in place, but at the end of the day, it’s the market.”\n\n“I think the No. 1 challenge I’ll face as mayor and we’ll face as a community is change, and change is happening quickly,” she said. “And how are we going to respond to that change? (Will we be) proactive or push it away? Will we open doors to whoever wants to come in or accept change in way that fits our community?”\n\nAs mayor, “You aren’t necessarily the most popular person. You have to make decisions for your community and think 30, 40 years out,” Regan Gonzalez said. “And you have to do that on top of a full-time job.”\n\nHer full-time job is as a senior project manager for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota. She helps the insurance provider in its efforts to address the root of health-care needs in communities.\n\nShe also is working on master’s degree in public health.\n\nMaria sees “huge inequities in who holds leadership in our state,” so she sees the election of a woman and the state’s first Latina mayor as a significant step forward.\n\n“One of things I love the most is going to schools and talking to kids and the way they glow, the way they get excited to know that somebody like me is the leader of our city,” she said.\n\nShe said she feels a connection to the wave of women voted into public office around the country this fall, but as the winner of a nonpartisan election, she is glad she doesn’t have to stick to any party’s ideology.\n\n“I absolutely love that it’s nonpartisan. I think it’s a huge asset to our community. I don’t have to adhere to any political party,” she said “I get to focus on what’s best for my community.”\n\nEditor's Note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area's arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person's artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nNathan Burkart\n\nNathan Burkart, a Janesville native and 2004 Craig High School grad, is back in town as the executive director of the Janesville Performing Arts Center.\n\nAfter graduating high school, Burkart earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in musical theater from Webster Conservatory in St. Louis. From there, he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a professional actor for eight years, appearing in everything from a national McDonald's commercial to the Adam Sandler film “Jack and Jill.”\n\nWhile in L.A., Burkart started his own theater company, the Los Angeles New Court Theatre, and helped triple the size of an acting school in Hollywood in just six months.\n\nBurkart lives in Janesville with his wife, Megan, and their newborn son, Holden.\n\nFor more about the Janesville Performing Arts Center, visit JanesvillePAC.org.\n\n1. You were born and raised in Janesville but moved west to work professionally. What do people who have never left Janesville take for granted about living here? Having affordable housing and education. You need literally a million dollars to own a house in any area that has nice schools and decent living situations. You also live what feels like half your life in your car. It would take me 45 minutes to drive 12 miles to work every day. I saw my hair losing its color in my car mirrors.\n\n2. You're a new father. What aspect of parenthood were you least prepared for? The incredible love you have for your child. Everyone tells you that parenthood changes your life, but actually feeling it is something that I really don't think you can prep for. I always knew I'd love my kid, but the overall emotion that I was overcome with was awesome and powerful to say the least.\n\n3. You and your brother Alex are twins. Name three things people assume about twins that make no sense. 1.) Twin powers. So many people think Alex and I might have some sort of supernatural power because we are twins. Sometimes when people ask, I tell them light shoots out of our hands when we touch to see their reactions.\n\n2.) We are not the same person. Many people lump twins into a group. I always say that when you have salt and pepper, they are “salt and pepper,” not “the shakers.” 3.) All twins like the same things. Alex and I do share common interests, but we also like tons of different things. Some people think we need to like the same things because we have identical DNA.\n\n4. What do you miss most/least about living in L.A.? My friends. I had a wonderful friend group in Los Angeles that was incredibly supportive and stretched me so much as a person and artist. Some of them have already visited, but I miss them every day. I bet you thought I'd say the weather. I don't miss the traffic or paying my massive rent bill every month.\n\n5. Who is the most famous actor/actress you've met, and what were the circumstances? Adam Sandler cast me in one of his movies. I walked into the audition room and he was lying on the couch. I froze for a second before proceeding. Adam was awesome. I also got to work with Edward Albee quite a bit. Edward won three Pulitzer Prizes for his plays and was an incredible person to study from. Another fun story is that, while managing my café in Los Angeles, I routinely took care of Clay Matthews' parents. We became pretty good friends. The first day Clay actually came in, I went and hid in the kitchen and called my dad.\n\n6. Do you have any pets? I have a blind Yorkshire terrier named Oliver. He is 10 years old and still loves to play with his ball.\n\n7. Do you have any superstitions? Not really. I try not to say “Macbeth” backstage. If I accidentally do, I always brush it off and say, “Let's see what happens.”\n\n8. If you could choose someone to play you in a film about your life, who would it be? Andrew Garfield. I think he is an incredible actor, and his acting is very similar to mine. Not to mention my wife thinks he's attractive.\n\n9. Do you plan to do any acting locally? I do. I would love to act and direct eventually. I am taking the time to really dive into my new role at JPAC, but in a few months, I think I'll be ready to take on those other opportunities. Maybe a project or two a year tops. My wife is also a super talented singer/actor, so I look forward to her participating eventually, too.\n\n10. Can you cook? I am a terrible cook. One time, I felt inspired to cook something for Meg, so I made pasta and threw green beans in there. She laughed when she tasted it and let me know I was relieved from any future cooking duties.\n\n11. You're a sports fan. If you had to choose between tickets to your favorite theater production and tickets to Lambeau Field, which would you choose? If they were NFC Championship tickets, I would take those. Otherwise, I would take the theater tickets. I can go to other sporting events. You throw “Hamilton” tickets in front of me, and it's a no-brainer.\n\n12. Share something the executive director of a performing arts center gets excited about that the general public wouldn't understand. When I hear that someone will donate a large tech item I was going to have to rent. When bringing in shows, I need to budget for much more than just the artist fees. There is tech, backline and hospitality. When I can find ways to drive those other costs down, it gives me flexibility to be creative with the rest of my budget. Flexibility makes me excited.\n\n13. Do you have a mentor? I have many mentors. I look at the board at JPAC as my current mentors. They have taught me so much since I've been here, and I look up to them very much. The owner of the acting school I managed in L.A. was another mentor of mine. He taught me how to integrate spirituality and activism into the entertainment field. I work hard to incorporate that into my job as ED at JPAC.\n\n14. Share a memorable experience you've had while auditioning. I was asked to eat a cold burger during my audition. They told me to pretend I loved that burger. After I got done, the person running the audition asked if I was a vegetarian. I said, “No,” and they said, “You looked like that burger was the worst thing you have ever eaten in your life.” We did it again, and I actually booked that McDonald's spot.\n\n15. What is your main objective as executive director of JPAC? To listen to what ideas the community has and to find ways to bring them to life.\n\n16. Ever sung karaoke? My friends used to rent a karaoke room in Korea Town in L.A. Anything from a musical was usually a good way for me to jump into the fun. I prefer to do it with a partner than by myself.\n\n17. Describe the underlying cultural differences between the Midwest and the West Coast. The West Coast is incredibly diverse. Almost every single country in the world is represented in Los Angeles. You get to see how different groups live, worship, eat and communicate with each other. Schools and public buildings would have days off for holidays that weren't just Christian holidays. I got to have so many experiences. I actually went to my first quinceanera and participated in a few events where English was not the primary language spoken.\n\n18. Share something people would be surprised to find out about you. I still get nervous every time I go on stage. Some people don't realize that actors get nervous, too. I have always justified it by saying it's because I care so much. I always thought the minute I stop getting nervous is the minute I stop loving it.\n\n19. When you were living in L.A., was there anything in particular about Janesville you missed, or vice versa? I missed a Janesville fall. I used to google images of “Autumn in Janesville” and make that my desktop picture. I missed my mentors and teachers from Janesville. I also missed clouds, which provide this awesome filter when you look at the sky. In L.A., there were times where I just saw too many clear blue skies. I know … how could that be possible? Now that I'm back, I would say I definitely miss the mountains and beaches. LA has an incredible terrain.\n\n20. Were you looking for a reason to return to Janesville, or did this position just come along at the right time? I was looking to come home under the right circumstances. I always knew in my heart I'd be coming back to Wisconsin one day—I just didn't know when. When this position came up, it was something that I wanted. I cared so much about this building since (JPAC) was being organized back in the early 2000s. I wanted to raise my family in Janesville, and I wanted my son to know his grandparents. Janesville is an incredible place.\n\n20Q: Catching up with Lou Dog frontman Andy Wilson\n\nBy Greg Little glittle@gazettextra.com\n\nApr 12, 2020\n\nEditor’s Note: Kicks presents 20Q, a feature that introduces readers to people involved in the area’s arts and entertainment community. Compiled by kicks Editor Greg Little, each piece will include a short bio, photo and answers to questions that provide insight into not only that person’s artistic interests but also his or her unique personality.\n\nAndy Wilson For singer Andy Wilson, music is truly Sublime.\n\nAs lead voice for reggae/rock/ska band Lou Dog, Wilson and his cohorts celebrate the entire catalog of the 1980s-90s California group. Other members of Lou Dog include Zane Bawazir (guitar), Zach March (bass), Jamie Shere (drums) and Adam Tollefson (turntables).\n\nWilson, a Janesville native, is a 2005 graduate from Craig High School. When he’s not on stage—or on his motorcycle, Wilson is spending time with his wife, Desiree Robinson, and the couple’s sons Carter Robinson, 13, and Sawyer Wilson, 5. The family also includes a rather jealous Australian cattle dog-shepherd Nova Jean and a “giant furry snob” in tomcat Jarvis Wumbo.\n\nTo learn more about Wilson and Lou Dog, search for the band on Facebook or seek out “LouDogBand” at Soundcloud .com to stream the group’s album.\n\n1. Where does the name “Lou Dog” comes from? “Lou Dog” was the name of (Sublime guitarist/vocalist) Bradley Nowell’s dalmatian. The iconic dog was kinda the mascot for the band.\n\n2. Lou Dog is defined as a Sublime tribute band. Why cover Sublime? When I was in high school, I really wanted to do a Sublime cover band. It wasn’t until after graduating that I found the right people to do this with me. Sublime appeals to a wide variety of audiences, and nobody was really performing that kind of music around here.\n\n3. When did you first discover your interest in performing music? In 2001, I was living in Sioux City, Iowa. A friend of mine asked me if I would do a guest spot and perform “Sober” by TOOL for his band at a small club show. It was that performance for me that took me to the edge of the cliff, I knew after that I wanted to jump.\n\n4. You’re a motorcycle guy. How did you get into bikes, and what do you ride? Do you have a dream ride? I ride a 2014 Harley-Davidson Limited and a 2005 H-D Dyna LowRider. I don’t have a dream ride, I just like making motorcycles rad. My brother from another mother Jerad (RIP) would say, “It ain’t custom til ya cut it,” and that’ll hold true with any bike I get my hands on.\n\n5. The greatest snack food of all time is …? Defend your answer. I’m not a snack time kind of dude—but I never turn down a piece of jerky. I just don’t buy it very often. I’d rather make it in my smoker. $10 for a little bag of beef jerky is robbery!\n\n6. Along with music and motorcycles, you’ve also spent some time bartending in Janesville. What is your favorite drink to make, and why? My favorite drink to make is when someone comes up to the bar and takes 15 minutes to basically tell me they don’t know what they want. “Something fruity!” Then I pour five different juices and vodka in a glass with a neon straw. (Insert eyeroll here.)\n\n7. At the grocery store, name the one item that goes into your cart whether you need it or not? Dill pickles. Specifically the deli kind—Claussen ... giant plastic jar. If you’re a dill pickle fan, you will not be disappointed.\n\n8. When it comes to music, what bands or artists do you like aside from Sublime? I’m fairly eclectic when it comes to music, and I like a lot of different styles/genres. Deftones, Highly Suspect, Outkast, IDLES, Nothing But Thieves, Excision, Joyner Lucas, Tyler Childers, Led Zepplin, Black Flag, Bad Brains, Wu-Tang, Zomboy, Dirty Heads ... I can keep going but I think you get the idea. I’m everywhere.\n\n9. In your opinion, is Lou Dog simply a fun endeavor, or are you guys hoping to someday take the band to the next level? When we recorded our self-titled album, there were times where we thought we might want to swing for the fences and really try to put Lou Dog on the map. It’s a difficult thing when your foundation has been that you’re a tribute to an established band. We ended up going through some member changes and taking extended breaks between playing/practicing. I think it’s really just a fun thing for us now. The more stress we place on ourselves, the less fun it becomes. We’re just trying to have a good time.\n\n10. The best thing about performing live is: Watching people dance, sing along and enjoy themselves. The free beer part doesn’t hurt either.\n\n11. People would be surprised to find out that I: Am fluent in American Sign Language. My mother is deaf, so ASL was my first language.\n\n12. You provide the vocals for Lou Dog. Have you ever taken any sort of vocal lessons, and how do you warm up before a show? Never taken a vocal lesson outside of choir classes. Singing has always just been kind of a natural thing for me (shout out to Bob Schrank at Craig High School). I use Schrank’s vocal exercises before each performance—especially the breath control exercises.\n\n13. Do you think you have a good voice, or was it a tough sell getting you to sing in public? I’m a modest dude. I don’t think my voice is all that great, but it can’t be that bad I guess since people still come to our shows. I used to have to do solos at choir concerts and stuff, so I didn’t always get a choice if I was going to be in the spotlight or not.\n\n14. When it comes to music or life, what is the best piece of advice you’ve ever received? “Life is 10% what happens and 90% how you react to it.” Shout out to Mr. Newy at Craig High for that life lesson. I live by it still today and make sure my kids understand it, as well. Best advice I’ve ever gotten.\n\n15. Do you have any useless talents? My feet are so flat they suction to the kitchen floor when I walk around barefoot. I tell my kids I can walk up skyscrapers like a lizard.\n\n16. Have you done any songwriting? Is that something you’re interested in doing? Songwriting has always been a collective thing with band members. I write all the lyrics and vocal melodies/harmonies and give my input with some instrumental things, but I’d say everybody kind of writes their own parts. I’ve attempted songwriting on my own but have never accomplished anything I’m truly proud of on my own.\n\n17. When you’re not singing in Lou Dog, what do you do for a living? If you could be doing anything for a career, what would it be? I work for Harley-Davidson of Madison currently as a service advisor. I was former service manager for Boardtracker Harley-Davidson (sore subject). If I could be anything, I’d be a chef or a food critic. I always wanted Anthony Bourdain’s job, honestly.\n\n18. Did you grow up in a musical household? Did your parents’ tastes influence your own in any way? My brother and I were heavily influenced by music growing up. Our parents are deaf, so it wasn’t something that was an influence from them but more of an escape or solace for us. Mom’s family is so musically talented it’s unbelievable. My aunts and grandfather play music like nobody’s business.\n\n19. Are you a video game guy? If so, what sort of games do you play? Not really. When I do play, I get on my son’s PS4 and fire up some “Grand Theft Auto.” Otherwise, I like to play some of the classics such as “Super Mario Bros,” “Street Fighter” and “Goldeneye.” Video games don’t hold my attention for too long.\n\n20. When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up? I always wanted to be a zookeeper. I had “Ranger Rick” magazines memorized, and I still watch “Animal Planet” documentaries on the regular before bed. As I got older, I realized zookeepers have to clean up after animals, and yo, they stink. I can’t even handle a litter box.\n\n20Q: Catching up with Parker High art teacher Sam Van Galder\n\nBy Greg Little glittle@gazettextra.com\n\nSep 9, 2020\n\nSam Van Galder\n\nWhen he’s not surgically dissecting the landscape at one of the area’s lush, green golf courses, it’s quite likely Sam Van Galder might be re-creating it as a painting with oils on canvas.\n\nA recognized figure in Janesville sports, Van Galder is a seven-time winner of the annual city men’s golf tournament. And you might have seen his surname on the side of countless coach buses that travel regularly throughout the region.\n\nBut most days, Van Galder is helping mold the minds of a new generation of creatives as an art teacher at Parker High School.\n\nA 2005 graduate of Craig High School, Van Galder earned his bachelor of fine arts degree at UW-Whitewater and holds educational licensure through Norda Project Teaching. In his seventh year of teaching with the Janesville School District, Van Galder also coaches the Parker boys golf team and runs the school’s chapter of the National Art Honor Society.\n\nVan Galder and his wife, Emily, have a 4-year-old daughter, Caroline, and a 2-year-old son, Vincent. A golden- doodle named Charlee June rounds out the family.\n\nTo learn more about Van Galder, his art and information on commission opportunities, visit his Instagram page (@samvangalderart). To see artwork from his students, check out his classroom’s Instagram (@vgs_art_room) and Facebook (VG’s Art Room) pages.\n\n1. You recently published a book you created with a former student called “Ethan’s Animal Alphabet.” Can you explain the idea behind the book? The idea came from just watching Ethan draw. He has a unique way of drawing out his ideas. He loves to draw animals, school supplies, cars, trucks, etc. Meanwhile I have my own two young kids that love to read children’s books, and I came up with the idea of turning Ethan’s drawings into this neat little animal alphabet book after seeing other various children’s books pull off the same playful, illustrative look. It all came together nicely, and I think the book really hits home with a lot of people.\n\n2. Traditionally, educational emphasis is placed on math and sciences. Why is art is so important? Art forces students to solve problems in their own way. In a world where most answers or information can simply be Googled in a matter of seconds, art physically makes students attempt to solve the assignment in front of them. There isn’t one correct formula they must use or one exact answer. You can look up examples and information via research, but in the end, it is the student who must take the leap and trust his or her instincts and ideas on each project. I also think art creates a great form of interaction between students. I promote a social setting in my classroom, and I want students to gather, chat, work together and observe what others are doing. Kids need this verbal interaction more than ever as I see more and more kids relying solely on their smartphones to communicate with their peers.\n\n3. When did you first discover you wanted to become an art teacher? Well, my mom was an art teacher and an artist herself. So I guess since I showed that art was definitely a strength of mine (probably somewhere around age 8-10), it has always been in the back of my head as a possibility. The graduating Class of 2019 really proved to me that I’ve made the right decision, at least for this part of my life. It was my fourth year at Parker, and my first graduating class I had known for all four years. It was a group I made some great connections with and gained the trust of a lot of students. It was very reassuring to have a solid group of students who really valued my opinion and help.\n\n4. You’re a pretty decent golfer. I am not. Do you have any advice that might help me enjoy being on the course a bit more? Get a handicap. Regardless of your ability, everyone who plays or wants to play should get a handicap through the course you most commonly play. The handicap will allow you to compete with anyone of any skill level and will make the game more competitive for you. Just going out swinging a club aimlessly is only so much fun. Golf is one of the only sports that the recreational players could square up in a head-to-head match with, let’s say, Tiger Woods and possibly beat him—using the handicap system, of course.\n\n5. Are you more of an introvert or extrovert? I feel like I fall more in the middle. I think being a teacher forces you to be a bit of an extrovert just because every day you have to put yourself out there in front of groups of people and entertain the crowd. But I certainly enjoy lounging at home and keeping to myself as well.\n\n6. In your own opinion, what is your worst habit? Procrastination. I am awful at planning ahead. I always get so mad at myself for putting things off to the last minute, and I have been this way my entire life. My brain seems to function better when I am under the stress of a strict deadline.\n\n7. Name a popular actor/singer/artist who doesn’t appeal to you. This will be an extremely unpopular opinion, I’m sure, but I have never been able to get into Bruce Springsteen. I just never understood the hype. I have a very clear memory of driving in my mom’s car back when I was probably 6 or 7, and one of his songs was a big hit and always on the radio. I can’t remember the song, but I do remember it was just so depressing, and I used to make fun of it by mocking the tone of his voice. Ever since then I just haven’t been able to understand the hype around “The Boss.” Sorry to all the huge fans out there. Don’t take it personally.\n\n8. There is an entire fleet of coach buses in the area that have your family name on the sides of them. Did you learn a lot about buses through osmosis growing up, or was that simply a subject you weren’t too interested in? My sister and I were always down at the bus lot growing up. My dad would go into work a lot, and he would drag us along. We’d go exploring all over the place. It was a real family operation back then, and many of the employees would let us hang out with them and do whatever jobs they were doing. I drove a school bus after college for a few years. My route consisted of schools on Janesville’s south side, and many of the students I picked up in the morning and took home after school have now been my students. Interesting how that all turned out.\n\n9. It’s your night to select a board game for the family to play. Which one are you picking? Monopoly. It is probably the longest game you can choose, but I’ve always loved playing it. Not really sure why I would pick Monopoly over anything else, but to be honest with you, I’m not much of a board game person to begin with. I grew up in an UNO family. We were pretty serious about it. We have a championship belt we play for and everything.\n\n10. People would be surprised to know that I: Believe it or not, I think I have to say “make art” for this one. Even though I don’t feel like I hide my artistic skill, I don’t think to this point in my life I’ve done a very good job at promoting myself.\n\n11. If you could hang one famous piece of artwork in your home, which one would it be, and why? “Nighthawks” by Edward Hopper. “Nighthawks” is a city landscape, but it also includes a few figures to help tell a story. It is my favorite painting and is what really opened my eyes to what I like to do within my own personal work, which tends to be a combination of figurative work within a landscape of some sort—much like the work of Edward Hopper.\n\n12. When you go to the grocery store, name one item that goes into your cart whether you need it or not. Milk. Having kids now has shown me you can never have enough milk in the fridge.\n\n13. Select your favorite Muppet. Kermit the Frog. I guess when I think of the Muppets, Kermit just seems to be the face of the brand and what comes to mind on the spot. I think I was more of a “Sesame Street” kind of kid.\n\n14. You have two hours of free time. What do you do? I would hit range balls. I love going to the driving range and working on my golf swing. It’s like a reset button for me. Some people like to go running or ride their bikes to get their minds right, but for me, a couple of buckets of golf balls usually does the trick.\n\n15. Name a skill you wish you had. I wish I could play an instrument good enough to be a part of a band. To me, that just seems like such a rush to perform music in front of a crowd. I am always envious of people I know who do this, even if it’s just at local bars. It just looks fun.\n\n16. Right now, what is the wallpaper on your cell phone? A picture of me and my dad on a golf course. It popped up a few months ago as a memory on Facebook, and it has always been one of my favorite photos with him, so I made it my background that day.\n\n17. Name one movie or TV show that, if you happen to come across it even though it’s half over, you’ll still sit down and watch it. I can sit down and watch “Seinfeld” at any time. I just love the characters, the roles they play and all the everyday problems they seem to encounter. My favorite episode is when George pretends to be a marine biologist and saves a whale by removing the golf ball Kramer hit into its spout.\n\n18. If I had to choose one meal to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be: I think I would choose breakfast. There are just so many options for breakfast, and I don’t think any one of them has ever been bad. If I have to get more specific, I would say a Denver omelette with hash browns.\n\n19. Health food or junk food? I think everyone would love to choose healthy food here, but let’s be honest with ourselves—who doesn’t love a bit of good junk food? I mean, if you’re stranded on an island and someone presents a plate of assorted vegetables or a cheeseburger and fries, I am choosing the latter every time.\n\n20. If you weren’t an art teacher, what would you be doing? I would most likely be a golf professional giving lessons and running a golf course somewhere. I’ve thought a lot about giving up my amateur status at some point and begin giving lessons on the side while continuing to teach, but I’m not quite ready to stop playing competitively. More recent"
