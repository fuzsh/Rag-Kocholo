        "text": "1000\n\nHercule Poirot (, ) is a fictional Belgian detective created by British writer Agatha Christie. Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-running characters, appearing in 33 novels, two plays (Black Coffee and Alibi), and 51 short stories published between 1920 and 1975. Poirot has been portrayed on radio, in film and on television by various actors, including Austin Trevor, John Moffatt, Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, Ian Holm, Tony Randall, Alfred Molina, Orson Welles, David Suchet, Kenneth Branagh, and John Malkovich. Overview Influences Poirot's name was derived from two other fictional detectives of the time: Marie Belloc Lowndes' Hercule Popeau and Frank Howel Evans' Monsieur Poiret, a retired French police officer living in London. Evans' Jules Poiret \"was small and rather heavyset, hardly more than five feet, but moved with his head held high. The most remarkable features of his head were the stiff military moustache. His apparel was neat to perfection, a little quaint and frankly dandified.\" He was accompanied by Captain Harry Haven, who had returned to London from a Colombian business venture ended by a civil war. A more obvious influence on the early Poirot stories is that of Arthur Conan Doyle. In An Autobiography, Christie states, \"I was still writing in the Sherlock Holmes tradition â eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp\". Conan Doyle acknowledged basing his detective stories on the model of Edgar Allan Poe's C. Auguste Dupin and his anonymous narrator, and basing his character Sherlock Holmes on Joseph Bell, who in his use of \"ratiocination\" prefigured Poirot's reliance on his \"little grey cells\". Poirot also bears a striking resemblance to A. E. W. Mason's fictional detective Inspector Hanaud of the French SÃ»retÃ©, who first appeared in the 1910 novel At the Villa Rose and predates the first Poirot novel by 10 years. Christie's Poirot was clearly the result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. The large number of refugees in the country who had fled the German invasion of Belgium in August to November 1914 served as a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective would be available to solve mysteries at an English country house. At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians, since the invasion of their country had constituted Britain's casus belli for entering World War I, and British wartime propaganda emphasised the \"Rape of Belgium\". Popularity Poirot first appeared in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, published in 1920, and exited in Curtain, published in 1975. Following the latter, Poirot was the only fictional character to receive an obituary on the front page of The New York Times. By 1930, Agatha Christie found Poirot \"insufferable\", and by 1960 she felt that he was a \"detestable, bombastic, tiresome, ego-centric little creep\". Despite this, Poirot remained an exceedingly popular character with the general public. Christie later stated that she refused to kill him off,\n\nHercule Poirot\n\n10000\n\nEiffel may refer to: Places Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France, designed by Gustave Eiffel Champ de Mars â Tour Eiffel station, Metro station serving the Eiffel Tower Eiffel Bridge, Ungheni, Moldova, designed by Gustave Eiffel Eiffel Bridge, LÃ¡char, Spain, built by the studio of Gustave Eiffel Eiffel Bridge, Zrenjanin, Serbia, built by Gustave Eiffel's company Eiffel Building, Sao Paulo, Brazil; a mixed use building Eiffel Peak, a summit in Alberta, Canada Education Eiffel School of Management (est. 2007), Creteil, France Gustave Eiffel French School of Budapest, Hungary Gustave Eiffel University (est. 2020), Champs-sur-Marne, Marne la VallÃ©e, France LycÃ©e Gustave Eiffel (disambiguation) Music Eiffel 65, an Italian electronic music group, originally called Eiffel Eiffel (band), a French rock group 5 Eiffel (EP), a 1982 record by Kim Larsen \"Alec Eiffel\", a song by the alternative rock band Pixies Other uses Eiffel (company), successor of Gustave Eiffel's engineering company Eiffel (film), a 2021 French film Eiffel I'm in Love, a 2003 Indonesian teen romantic comedy film directed by Nasri Cheppy.

A colorless solid, it is an oxidized derivative of glucose. It is typically produced by the aerobic oxidation of glucose in the presence of the enzyme glucose oxidase. The conversion cogenerates hydrogen peroxide, which is often the key product of the enzyme: Gluconolactone spontaneously hydrolyzes to gluconic acid: Applications Gluconolactone is a food additive with the E-number E575 used as a sequestrant, an acidifier, or a curing, pickling, or leavening agent. It is a lactone of D-gluconic acid. Pure GDL is a white odorless crystalline powder. GDL has been marketed for use in feta cheese. GDL is pH-neutral, but hydrolyses in water to gluconic acid which is acidic, adding a tangy taste to foods, though it has roughly a third of the sourness of citric acid. It is metabolized to 6-phospho-D-gluconate; one gram of GDL yields roughly the same amount of metabolic energy as one gram of sugar. Upon addition to water, GDL is partially hydrolysed to gluconic acid, with the balance between the lactone form and the acid form established as a chemical equilibrium. The rate of hydrolysis of GDL is increased by heat and high pH. The yeast Saccharomyces bulderi can be used to ferment gluconolactone to ethanol and carbon dioxide. The pH value greatly affects culture growth. Gluconolactone at 1 or 2% in a mineral media solution causes the pH to drop below 3. It is also a complete inhibitor of the enzyme amygdalin beta-glucosidase at concentrations of 1 mM.

It is a Local Nature Reserve, a Ramsar site and a Special Protection Area. It is part of the Berney Marshes and Breydon Water nature reserve, which is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It is a large stretch of sheltered estuary. It is at the gateway to The Broads river system on the eastern edge of Halvergate Marshes. It is the UK's largest protected wetland. It is long and more than wide in places. Breydon Water is overlooked at the southern end by the remains of the Roman Saxon Shore fort at Burgh Castle. Centuries ago, Breydon Water would have been one large estuary facing the sea. At the western end the water may be considered to start at the confluence of the River Yare and River Waveney; smaller sources including The Fleet flow in from the surrounding marshland. Safe passage for boats is indicated by red and green marker posts. Unlike most of the navigable waterways in the Norfolk Broads, Breydon Water is not subject to a speed limit. At the east end of Breydon Water the river returns to a narrow channel, passing under Breydon Bridge after which it is joined by the River Bure then under Haven Bridge from where it is through the harbour into the North Sea. Features At low tide there are vast areas of mudflats and saltings, all teeming with birds. Since the mid-80s, Breydon Water has been a nature reserve in the care of the RSPB. It has been a popular shooting area for centuries, and the shooting continues, but on a very much reduced scale. In the winter, large numbers of wading birds and wildfowl use it to overwinter, including 12,000 golden plovers, 12,000 wigeons, 32,000 lapwings and tens of thousands of Bewick's swans. Other species that have been noted there include dunlin, sanderling, Eurasian whimbrel, several (escaped) flamingos, pied avocets and on one occasion a glossy ibis. There is a bird observation hide at the east end of Breydon Water, on the north shore, looking out towards a breeding platform used mainly by common terns. Other breeding species include common shelducks, northern shovelers, Eurasian oystercatchers and yellow wagtails. Naturalist Arthur Henry Patterson (1857â1935), who published under the pseudonym \"John Knowlittle\", extensively documented the wildlife of Breydon and the disappearing lifestyles of the boatmen, wildfowlers and fishermen who made a living from the estuary. Short sections of the Wherryman's Way and Weavers' Way long-distance paths follow the northern bank of the estuary from Yarmouth to Berney Arms, a distance of about 5 miles. Breydon Water is the site of events in Arthur Ransome's popular Swallows and Amazons series book, Coot Club.

Born in Gloucestershire, Reid obtained his BA degree in languages from Cambridge University, after which he taught in English high schools. He went on to conduct curriculum research at the University of Birmingham, where he obtained his PhD and subsequently taught MEd students. He took early retirement from the University of Birmingham in 1988 and was appointed as a visiting professor at the London Institute of Education, and subsequently the University of Texas, Austin. He also undertook collaborative projects with colleagues at the University of Oslo and taught summer schools at the University of Victoria, British Columbia. Some of his reminiscences were published in 2009 in \"Leaders in Curriculum Studies\", edited by E.C. Short and Leonard J. Waks (Sense Publishers, Rotterdam, 2009). In retirement he self-published pamphlets and books concerning archaeology and other local history in his native Cotswold landscape, as well as memoirs, articles on chess, books of poems and a novel. A series of articles published in \"Glevensis\", a journal of the Gloucestershire Archaeological Society were formed into a self-published book (Chantry Press; Windmill Print and Graphics) entitled \"From Roman to Saxon in a Cotswold Landscape\" (2006). Reid's major academic works elaborated on curriculum theorist Joseph Schwab's notion of \"curriculum deliberation\". He was the author of numerous scholarly articles and several books, and was a regular contributor to the Journal of Curriculum Studies of which he was European Editor from 1975 to 1983 and General Editor from 1986 until the mid-1990s. He regularly presented papers at the annual meetings of the American Education Research Association. Reid had a penetrating grasp of the nature of learning and a deep understanding of the link between theory and classroom realities - an approach both philosophical and practical. Few writers in the field combined his intellectual edge with a solid perspective on teaching and a readiness to address complex issues. In 2007 his article \"Strange Curricula: Origins and Development of the Institutional Categories of Schooling\" (JCS 22, 203 (1990)) was selected as one of the seminal articles that had appeared in the Journal of Curriculum Studies in the previous 25 years. In 2014 Reid moved to Nottingham to be close to his family and he died there in September 2015.

Founded in 1906, it is the oldest Sikh society in Greater Vancouver, and its original location was the largest gurdwara in North America. The current gurdwara is located at the intersection of Southwest Marine Drive and Ross Street, in South Vancouver. History The Khalsa Diwan Society was founded on July 22, 1906, and was registered on March 13, 1909. Their first site and gurdwara was built in 1908 at 1866 West 2nd Avenue, inaugurated on January 19. The financial situation of the Society depended on the number of Sikhs living in British Columbia, and donations rose considerably as more Sikhs came to the province. The population of Sikhs rose in the period of 1904â1908 to 5,185, but fell to 2,342 in 1911. The Sikh population dwindled even more, to 1,099, as the year 1918 approached. Verne A. Dusenbery, Professor of Anthropology and Chair of the Global Studies Program at Hamline University in Minnesota, wrote that the gurdwara served as \"truly a religious, social, political, cultural, and social service center for the entire South-Asian immigrant population of the lower mainland\" during its early history. In the 1940s, the KDS served in a leadership role as Indo-Canadians demanded for voting rights, and it did so in a secular capacity. The gurdwara had a homeless shelter and a langar or kitchen. The KDS had a secular social role as a community centre and also served Hindus and Muslims among the Indo-Canadian community. Raj Hans Kumar stated that in political affairs the KDS represented all \"Hindus\", which at the time meant all people of East-Indian origin. In the early 1950s, a serious split occurred in the Canadian Sikh community, when the Khalsa Diwan Society elected a clean-shaven Sikh to serve on its management committee. Although most of the early Sikh immigrants to Canada were non-Khalsa, and a majority of the members of the society were clean-shaven non-Khalsa Sikhs, a faction objected to the election of a non-Khalsa to the management committee. The factions in Vancouver and Victoria broke away from the Khalsa Diwan Society, and established their own gurdwara society called the Akali Singh Society, which opened in 1952. Relocation By the late 1950s, there were plans to establish Punjabi-language schools for Canadian-born children and to collect funds for a new community centre. In 1963, the Society began planning for a new gurdwara and community centre. The Society purchased of city land in 1968 at the intersection of Southwest Marine Drive and Ross Street, in South Vancouver. Construction began in winter 1969, and was completed in the first week of April 1970 for a price of $6,060. Sri Guru Granth Sahib was moved from the 2nd Avenue gurdwara to the Ross Street gurdwara on the day of Vasakhi 1970. The initial plans asked for a library and community centre, but these aspects were eliminated from the plans. The celebration for Guru Nanak's 500th birthday was held prior\n\nKhalsa Diwan Society Vancouver\n\n10000228\n\nJulien R. Leparoux (born July 15, 1983 in Senlis, Oise, France) is a French Eclipse Award winning jockey currently racing in the United States. He has won seven Breeders' Cup races, including the 2015 Breeders' Cup Mile with Champion Turf Mare Tepin and the 2016 Breeders' Cup Juvenile with Classic Empire. Background Leparoux grew up in a racing family, the son of Robert Leparoux, a jockey turned assistant trainer. He worked at the Chantilly Racecourse as a stable hand and in January 2003 emigrated to California to work as an exercise rider for fellow Frenchman, trainer Patrick Biancone. In 2005, he became an apprentice jockey. Leparoux is known as a finesse rider. \"I just try not to fight so much with my horses,\" he said in a 2012 interview. \"I try to be gentle around their mouths.\" Family In December 2012, Julien married Shea Mitchell who, like Julien, is the child of a racehorse trainer. During one of the races that Shea attended, Julien fell off and broke his hand. Later that week, Shea tweeted at Julien a simple \"I hope you're ok\". Not long after, they got married. Shea tweeted a picture of Julien and her father with the caption \"2007, when Julien rode On the Acorn for dad. He probably never guessed he was looking @ his future son in law\". On September 24, 2015, their first son, Mitchell Leparoux, was born. At only 4 days old, Mitchell was out at Keeneland watching his dad warm up horses in the early morning and racing during the day! Racing career Leparoux embarked on his professional riding career in the summer of 2005 at Saratoga Race Course where he earned his first win on July 26 on Easter Guardian. He finished the Saratoga meet with 28 wins, the most in track history by an apprentice. In 2006 he was also the leading winning jockey during the Turfway Park winter/spring meet, Churchill Downs spring/summer meet, and Keeneland Race Course spring meet (where he tied with Rafael Bejarano). For 2006, Julien Leparoux won 403 races to lead all jockeys in the United States. His total wins and earnings of $12,491,316 for the year were the most by an apprentice jockey in racing history. He was voted the 2006 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey. He was also the subject of the Eclipse Award-winning photograph, which showed him being unseated when the filly Sanibel Storm ducked into the rail in the stretch at Keeneland. Leparoux somersaulted over her head and landed in the infield: both he and the filly were unhurt. Leparoux \"lost the bug\" in September 2006, referring to the five-pound weight allowance an apprentice (bug) jockey is given. Despite this, Leparoux continued winning riding titles, including Turfway's winter/spring meet, Keeneland's spring meet and Churchill Downs' spring/summer meet. On June 27, 2007, Leparoux became only the fifth jockey in the 133-year history of Churchill Downs to ride six winners on a single card. On November 11, 2008 he rode seven winners on\n\nJulien Leparoux\n\n10000242\n\nRod J. Rohrich ( ), F.A.C.S. is a Dallas-based plastic surgeon, author and educator. He is the editor-in-chief of the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and a founding member of the Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute and the Alliance in Reconstructive Surgery. He is board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. A June 2014 journal article in Annals of Plastic Surgery recognized Rohrich as one of the \"10 most influential surgeons of the current era\" after surveying the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) and the Southeastern Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (SESPRS). In 2021, Newsweek recognized Dr. Rohrich as the top ranked plastic surgeon in the United States for both rhinoplasty surgery and facelift surgery. This ranking is based on other surgeon and field memberâs opinions, not on patient testimony or results. Actual results from Dr. Rohrich have varied across patients. Many patients report breathing defects after surgery. Early life and education Rohrich grew up in rural North Dakota. He completed his undergraduate and postgraduate education at North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota, then earned his medical degree from Baylor College of Medicine. After general surgery and plastic surgery residencies at the University of Michigan Medical Center, he did further training in pediatric plastic surgery at Oxford University in England, and a hand and microvascular fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Career Rohrich joined the Division of Plastic Surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas in 1986 and succeeded Fritz E. Barton as department chair in 1991. In 2003 he was elected president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons for the year 2004. In 2005, Rohrich was appointed editor-in-chief of the journal, Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery. Rohrich was chairman of the UT-Southwestern plastic surgery department when it became the largest plastic surgery department in the country, and helped to open an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. Until 2014, Rohrich was one of highest paid state employees in Texas as a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center faculty member. He stepped down as chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center after \"an allegation of unprofessional conduct.\" In 2016, he resigned from UT Southwestern Medical Center, and was later a founding partner at the Dallas Plastic Surgery Institute. He is a clinical professor of plastic surgery at the Baylor College of Medicine and has been the president of the Association of Academic Chairs of Plastic Surgery, The Rhinoplasty Society, the Dallas Society of Plastic Surgeons, the Texas Society of Plastic Surgeons, as well as a chair on the Residency Review Committee for Plastic Surgery and American Board of Plastic Surgery. Rohrich was recognized as one of the top plastic surgeons in the United States by Castle Connolly's Top Doctor Program for 2019. He is author or coauthor of 900 scientific articles, 50 textbook chapters in plastic surgery, and editor of 5 plastic surgery textbooks or monographs. Selected bibliography Rohrich, Rod J; Adams Jr, William P; Ahmad, Jamil\n\nRod Rohrich\n\n10000292\n\nOrganized crime in Minneapolis refers to the illegal activity of the early 20th century in Minneapolis. This issue was first brought to public attention by Lincoln Steffens in the book The Shame of the Cities which chronicles the widespread corruption in major political parties in the 19th century and the continued efforts to fix this ongoing issue. A. A. Ames was a notable figure who was exposed due to this book, as he and the Minneapolis police force were caught dealing with illegal businesses syndicates. In 1902, Ames fled to Indiana and resigned as mayor on the 6th September. In his memoir Augie's Secrets, Twin Cities journalist Neal Karlen concedes that the power temporarily wielded in Minneapolis by Jewish-American organized crime figures like Kid Cann and David Berman beginning in the Prohibition-era gave a major boost to local anti-Semitism, for which Minneapolis became infamous nationwide. Karlen further argues, however, that the pervasive criminality during Mayor Ames' last term demonstrates that the city of Minneapolis was even more corrupt when Scandinavians and White Anglo-Saxon Protestants were still running it.

The brick station was built in 1910 by the Great Northern Railway and is located at the southern end of Williston's downtown. An interior and exterior restoration, begun in 2010 and costing almost $2 million, has returned the station to its original look. With the opening of the Bakken oil fields in the 21st century, many oil production workers now also board and detrain in Williston, adding additional passengers to the route. Many workers from as far as the Pacific Northwest opt to travel to their jobs via the station rather than fly or take the bus. Amtrak conductors frequently let passengers use Williston as an unofficial smoke break or fresh air stop, partly due to delays caused by the sheer volume of passengers boarding and alighting at the station. Ridership at the station had a particular spike in Amtrak's 2012 fiscal year, when ridership grew by almost 82 percent to 54,324 from 29,920 the year before (though 2011 ridership had been partly degraded due to flooding along the route). This patronage continued even in the wake of terrible delays that plagued the Empire Builder for much of 2013 and 2014 due to increased freight traffic related to the Bakken boom. As of fiscal year 2018, Williston is North Dakota's second busiest Amtrak station, behind Minot.

The novel takes place in the 1940s and represents standing on the threshold of a modern era in Cairo and the rest of the nation as a whole. Characters Each character is expressed like a caricature in which one quality or trait is over-emphasized. Mahfouz is not satirizing the individual character â he is satirizing the character type.

Initially known as the Ballarat Rebels and wearing green and gold, the team was established in 1993 as one of four regional under-18s clubs, set up as part of a plan by the AFL Commission to have clubs set in all regions of the state of Victoria. The club became affiliated with the new VFL's North Ballarat Football Club in 1996, and changed its name to North Ballarat Rebels and its colours to black and white to reflect this. In January 2017, the club again changed its name to Greater Western Victoria Rebels to reflect their expanded recruitment zone. This was to help aid in player development and the process of the AFL draft, which allows U18 players the opportunity to be selected by AFL clubs. Greater Western Victoria has produced many notable AFL players including Adam Goodes, Drew Petrie, Troy Chaplin, Jed Adcock, Tim Notting, Shannon Watt, James Walker and Shane O'Bree.

Furthermore, it also honors the special forces agent who died when seven suicide bombers blew themselves up on 3 April 2004 during a raid on an apartment used by the bombers. The tall cylinder stands above Atocha station, the destination of the four trains that were attacked. Texts composed of hundreds of expressions of grief sent in the days after the attack from all over the world are printed on a clear colourless membrane that is inflated by air pressure, rising balloon-like inside a cylinder. That structure is composed of glass blocks and sits on a platform or terrace overhead. The light in the empty blue room below comes from this source alone. At night the cylinder is illuminated by lamps within its base and can be seen throughout the station neighborhood. King Juan Carlos, Queen Sofia and Prime Minister JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero attended a ceremony at the site on the third anniversary of the bombings, 11 March 2007. Wreaths were laid at the foot of the tower and mourners observed three minutes of silence.

Filmography Dark Shadows (1969â1970) (Phillip Todd/Opening Voiceover) Broadway on Showtime (1980) (Dracula) Guiding Light (1977â1988) (Alan Spaulding) Life and career Bernau was born in Santa Barbara, California to Herbert Bernau, a physiotherapist, and Emma Bernau (nee Vercellino), a homemaker. Bernau showed a love for the theatre at an early age, and was frequently cast in high school plays. Bernau trained in the drama department at the University of California before getting his big break, appearing in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of Antony and Cleopatra in 1962. He continued in that role until 1964, when he toured nationally in the production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? These roles, in addition to performing at Canada's Stratford Festival, led to an appearance in a brief story arc on Dark Shadows in 1969 and 1970, where he portrayed Philip Todd. His most famous role, however, was that of villain Alan Spaulding on the soap opera Guiding Light, a role he played from 1977 to 1984 and again from 1986 until 1988. He left the show due to illness shortly before his death in 1989. Though his famous character was portrayed as a habitual womanizer, Bernau is considered to be one of the only truly \"out\" soap opera actors, as it was fairly well known by both the actors he worked with and the soap press at large that he was gay. Death Bernau was diagnosed with HIV but continued to work on Guiding Light. He left the show in the summer of 1988, when he became too ill to show up at work, with his role being recast with Daniel Pilon. Bernau died of a heart attack brought on by complications from AIDS on June 14, 1989, at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in New York City at the age of 49. At first, Bernau's AIDS diagnosis was kept private, with his death certificate listing 'natural causes' as the cause of his death. He is buried at Santa Barbara Cemetery, Santa Barbara, California.

A graduate who received an MFA from the Yale School of Drama, he is the author of both plays and fiction. Career His various plays include: Shearwater (American Place Theater) (1974) Heat (The Public Theater) (1974) And Domino Courts and Comanche Cafe (1976) at the American Place Theatre which won a Village Voice Obie Award (1977). Big River (1985), his adaptation of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn, written in collaboration with composer Roger Miller, won seven Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical when it opened on Broadway. It has proven very popular in stock and amateur theatrical productions. Hauptman joined the project after being approached by former Yale classmate Rocco Landesman. Hauptman is also a writer of fiction. His first published story, Good Rockin' Tonight, about an Elvis impersonator, made The Best American Short Stories Collection of 1982. Later, Hauptman wrote a screenplay of this story for 20th Century Fox, going on to write several other screenplays for the studios, including Amblin Entertainment and Merchant Ivory Productions. Bantam published his collection of short stories, including Good Rockin' Tonight and Other Stories (1988). Larry McMurtry gave him this quote: \"William Hauptman, for my money, is the most promising young fiction writers to come out of the Southwest in a long time.\" This collection won the Jesse Jones Award for Best Work of Fiction given by the Texas Institute of Letters in 1989, along with an award for Best Short Story, which was given to Moon Walking. In 1992, Bantam published his novel about tornado-chasers The Storm Season, which was later reprinted by the University of Texas Press. This novel was praised by Carolyn See in the Los Angeles Times, who said, \"Storm Season is about family, the working class, the crimes human beings have committed against the land, and the hypnotic, redemptive quality of disaster--why human beings enjoy being scared out of their wits. It's spooky, beautiful, bizarre.\" His most recent novel, about his experiences in the 60s, is called Journey to the West (2017) which has been described by James Magnuson, director of the Michener Center at the University of Texas as \"by turns hilarious, sweet, and harrowing...It deserves to be a classic.\" Big River was also produced by the Deaf West Company in both Los Angeles (2002) and New York, (2003) at the American Airlines Theater, and received a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. Big River was also produced as part of the Encores Series at City Center Theater in New York in 2017. Program Notes: From Playbill of Encores Production of Big River, 2016: \"It was a time when everybody played by the rules of Satchel Paige: Don't worry about the things you can't do nothing about, dance like nobody's watching, and love like you can't get hurt.\" He has also contributed articles to The Atlantic Monthly,\n\nWilliam Hauptman\n\n10000591\n\nKatha (, , sometimes also spelled Kathar,) (Shan: áµá¢ááºáááá) is a town in Sagaing Region, Myanmar, on the west side of the Irrawaddy River on a bluff with an average elevation of . Most of the town is more than above the river. Katha is known for having inspired Kyauktada, the fictional setting of George Orwell's Burmese Days. Location Katha is 12 hours by rail north of Mandalay through the railroad junction town of Naba which is to the west of Katha. A small branch of railway runs east from Naba to Katha. Katha can also be reached by ferries that run on the Irrawaddy River between the upstream town of Bhamo down to Mandalay. There is also direct bus service from Mandalay to Katha, but it is a bumpy ride. Climate Katha has a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification Aw) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cwa). Temperatures are very warm to hot throughout the year, with milder winter months (DecemberâFebruary). There is a winter dry season (NovemberâMarch) and a summer wet season (AprilâOctober). Economy Katha is the administrative seat of Katha District which comprises seven small townships. Katha is populated with government offices and many of the early town settlers were from every part of Burma and usually had background history of civil service under at least one of ministerial departments. The main economy of the town is fisheries and farming of kidney beans. Production of rice in the Katha Township is less than its consumption and Katha has to depend on imports from the nearby townships such as Indaw or Kawlin. Katha is a legendarily bureaucratic stronghold, and its prosperity is crippled by it. Setting of George Orwell's Burmese Days Katha is known in literature as the real place underlying the fictional Kyauktada, setting of George Orwell's first novel Burmese Days (1934). Orwell himself served at Katha in 1926-27 in the Indian Imperial Police. The British Club (including active tennis court), police station, and town jail are locations mentioned in the novel that can still be visited today. More accounts on this section is readable in Emma Larkin's \"Finding George Orwell in Burma\". Katha links with prominent Burmese writers such as Shwe U Daung, Thaw Tar Swe, Theik-Pan Muu Tin, and AFPFL leader Kyaw Nyein from Stable faction. In September 2019, the Katha Heritage Trust opened a museum at the house that Orwell lived in during his time in Katha. The two-story wooden building had been an attraction for Western tourists. The museum features portraits and a picture of Orwell, and a painting of the house. One stated aim of the trust was to cooperate with the Orwell Trust in the United Kingdom to restore momentos of Orwell's time in Katha.

It was the location of many of the sporting events at the Ancient Olympic Games. History During the 2004 Summer Olympics, it hosted the shot put events. Features The physical landmarks of the stadium are long and wide, and it served mainly for running races that determined the fastest person in the world. The track was made of hard-packed clay to serve as traction for the contestants in the running events. As in current day athletics, a white block was placed on one end of the track where the athletes would line up to place their feet and got ready to start of the race. The white block was used to align all the athletes so they would all run the same distance.

The song was released on 25 November 1997 by Columbia and Ruffhouse, and peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Jean's highest-charting solo hit in the UK alongside 2000's \"It Doesn't Matter\". In the United States, the song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also reached number four in both Canada and New Zealand The album version differs noticeably from the more-familiar pop version found on the single and used in the video. The album version has a different bass line and more, different, voiceover. The pop version is more recognizable due to radio play but is not found on the actual album. Both album and pop versions differ from the \"remix\" version. Composition The orchestral accompaniment, which was arranged and conducted by Sonny Kompanek, was performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Chart performance \"Gone till November\" peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and spent a total of 20 weeks on the chart. It also peaked at number nine on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In the UK, the song debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart and spent a total of nine weeks on the chart. This became Wyclef's highest-charting single on the chart. The single was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million copies in the United States. Critical reception British magazine Music Week wrote, \"This laidback ode to a footloose lifestyle by the Fugees rapper is desperately catchy and features pleasing arrangements, but somehow seems a bit lifeless.\" Remix The remix of \"Gone till November\" features R. Kelly and Canibus, with backing vocals by Destiny's Child, and contains interpolations of the songs \"Michelle\" by the Beatles and \"Karma Chameleon\" by Culture Club. A separate music video was also made for the remix version. Music video The music video for \"Gone till November\", directed by Francis Lawrence, was filmed at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on 20 November 1997, and released in December 1997. It features a cameo appearance by Bob Dylan when Wyclef sings, \"knockin' on heaven's door like I'm Bob Dylan.\" Canibus and Destiny's Child also make appearances respectively, but R. Kelly does not.

Splenocytes consist of a variety of cell populations such as T and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, which have different immune functions. Overview Splenocytes are spleen cells and consist of leukocytes like B and T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. The spleen is split into red and white pulp regions with the marginal zone separating the two areas. The red pulp is involved with filtering blood and recycling iron, while the white pulp is involved in the immune response. The red pulp contains macrophages that phagocytose old or damaged red blood cells. The white pulp contains separate compartments for B and T cells called the B cell zone (BCZ) and the T cell zone (TCZ). B cells make antibodies to fight off bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, and T cells are activated in response to antigens. The marginal zone (MZ) separates the red and white pulp regions and contains macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells. MZ macrophages remove some types of blood-borne bacteria and viruses. MZ B and dendritic cells are involved in antigen processing and presentation to lymphocytes in the white pulp.

The two rims are separated by a distance of only a couple of kilometers. To the west is the bowl-shaped crater Schmidt, and farther to the north are Manners and Arago. Its diameter is 30 km. It was named after Irish physicist and astronomer Edward Sabine. Description The outer rim of this crater is roughly circular and relatively featureless. The interior floor has a pair of small craterlets and a central rise. There is a ridge at the western edge of the floor that is concentric with the inner wall. About 85 km to the east-southeast is 'Statio Tranquillitatis' (Tranquility Base), the landing site of the Apollo 11 mission and the first human beings to step on the Moon. Ranger 8 flew over Sabine prior to impact in Mare Tranquilitatis. Both Sabine and Ritter were originally believed to be calderas rather than impact craters. In To A Rocky Moon, lunar geologist Don E. Wilhelms summarized: \"They are identical twins in morphology and size (29-30 km). They lack radial rim ejecta and secondary craters despite their apparent youth. They are positioned at the presumably active edge of a mare. They are even aligned along graben, the Hypatia rilles. Most significant, they lack deep floors recognized since the days of Gilbert as diagnostic of impacts.\" However, after the Apollo landings were complete, it was realized that \"all craters inside basins suffer enhanced isostatic uplift,\" because \"the thin crust and greater heat inside basins lower the viscosity of the craters' substrate, allowing it to reach isostasy with its surroundings more quickly than can other craters.\" Satellite craters By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sabine. The following craters have been renamed by the IAU, after the three astronauts of Apollo 11. Sabine B â See Aldrin. Sabine D â See Collins. Sabine E â See Armstrong. A crater near the southeast rim of Sabine was referred to as Dark Crater by the Apollo 11 astronauts.

FVI garnered a notorious reputation within the industry for producing films that were highly derivative of many blockbusters of the era. The company mainly specialized in producing and distributing B movies and horror fare. History The entrepreneur who spearheaded the company was Edward L. Montoro. He wrote, directed, and produced the company's first feature film Getting Into Heaven in 1968. The adult film was made for $13,000 and grossed almost 20 times its cost. FVI was known for acquiring Italian genre films and distributing them within the United States. These films included the 1968 spaghetti Western Boot Hill, a sequel to the famous Trinity films, and the 1974 horror thriller Beyond the Door starring Juliet Mills. FVI acquired Beyond the Door for $100,000 and the film went on to earn $9 million at the box office, making it one of the most successful independent releases of that year. Detailing a woman possessed by a demon, Beyond the Door was labeled a rip-off of The Exorcist. Warner Bros. promptly filed a lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement. The lawsuit failed after it was determined Warner Bros. had no rights to key horror scenes depicted in The Exorcist. FVI produced and distributed Grizzly in 1976, one of the first of the Jaws imitations. Montoro financed the film for $750,000 and it was directed by William Girdler. Grizzly was a surprise hit, earning more than $39 million and becoming the most financially successful independent film of 1976. Montoro decided to keep the profits for himself, resulting in a lawsuit against FVI by Girdler and producer/screenwriters Harvey Flaxman and David Sheldon. FVI eventually returned the profits to the filmmakers. Montoro's FVI worked with Girdler on the animal horror thriller Day of the Animals the following year, though this collaboration did not achieve the success of Grizzly. Montoro eventually moved FVI's headquarters to Hollywood and began churning out multiple genre films over the next seven years, including Search and Destroy (1979) starring Don Stroud, The Dark (1979) starring William Devane, The Visitor (1979) starring Glenn Ford, H. G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come (1979) starring Jack Palance, Kill or Be Killed (1980), Kill and Kill Again (1981), the sequel to Kill or Be Killed, The Incubus (1981) starring John Cassavetes, Texas Lightning (1981) starring Cameron Mitchell, Pieces (1982) starring Christopher George, They Call Me Bruce? (1982), The Pod People (1983), Vigilante (1983) starring Robert Forster, The House on Sorority Row (1983), Mortuary (1983) starring Bill Paxton, The Power (1984), Alley Cat (1984), and Mutant (1984) starring Bo Hopkins. Demise In 1980, FVI acquired the rights to the Italian film Great White, a thinly veiled Jaws rip-off starring James Franciscus and Vic Morrow. Montoro and FVI spent over $4 million in advertising in the U.S., but Universal Pictures promptly filed a lawsuit, claiming that the film was too derivative of Jaws.

The rules state that the chosen luxury item must not be anything animate or indeed anything that enables the castaway to escape from the island, for instance a radio set, sailing yacht or aeroplane. The choices of book and luxury can sometimes give insight into the guest's life, and the choices of guests are listed here. Very rarely, programmes will be repeated in place of new shows as a tribute to former guests who have recently died â for example Radio 4 repeated Humphrey Lyttelton's show, originally aired on 5 November 2006, on 15 June 2008. Desert Island Discs takes two short breaks, in April and August/September.

It is served by Charlton railway station, which is less than a five-minute walk away from the stadium. An alternative route is the Jubilee line; exiting at North Greenwich, and changing for route 161, 472 and 486 buses, which stop outside the stadium. History In Charlton's early years, the club had a nomadic existence using several different grounds between its formation in 1905 and the beginning of World War I in 1914. The ground dates from 1919, at a time when Charlton were moderately successful and looking for a new home. Mr Fred Barned, the clubâs honorary chairman, found an abandoned sand and chalk pit in Charlton, but did not have sufficient funds to fully develop the site. An army of volunteer Charlton supporters dug out a flat area for the pitch at the bottom of the chalk pit and used the excavated material to build up makeshift stands. The ground's name most likely comes from its original valley-like appearance. The club played its first game at the ground before any seats, or even terraces, were installed; there was simply a roped-off pitch with the crowd standing or sitting on the adjoining earthworks. The unique circumstances of the ground's initial construction led to an unusually intense bond between the club's supporters and the site that exists to this day. In the 1923â24 season, Charlton played at The Mount stadium in Catford but in a much more highly populated area. A proposed merger with Catford South End FC fell through and thus Charlton moved back to the Valley. In 1967, Len Silver the promoter at Hackney made an application to open Charlton as a British League speedway club, and plans were put forward to construct a track around the perimeter of the football pitch. The application to include speedway at the Valley was enthusiastically supported initially, but was eventually ruled out on the grounds of noise nuisance. For many years, the Valley was one of the largest Football League grounds in Britain, although its highest maximum capacity of 75,000 was only half the capacity of Glasgow's Hampden Park. However, Charlton's long absence from the top level of English football prevented much-needed renovation, as funds dried up and attendances fell. Charlton were relegated from the First Division in 1957 and did not return until 1986, and in 1972 were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in the postwar era. Eventually, the club's debts led to it almost going out of business in the early 1980s. A consortium of supporters successfully acquired the club in 1984, but the Valley remained under the ownership of the club's former owner. However, the club was unable to finance the improvements needed to make the Valley meet new safety requirements. Shortly after the start of the 1985â86 season, Charlton left\n\nThe Valley (stadium)\n\n10000937\n\nIn Immanuel Kant's philosophy, a category ( in the original or Kategorie in modern German) is a pure concept of the understanding (Verstand). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced (a priori). Following Aristotle, Kant uses the term categories to describe the \"pure concepts of the understanding, which apply to objects of intuition in general a prioriâ¦\" Kant further wrote about the categories: \"They are concepts of an object in general, by means of which its intuition is regarded as determined with regard to one of the logical functions for judgments.\" The categories are the condition of the possibility of objects in general, that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular. Kant enumerated twelve distinct but thematically related categories. Meaning of \"category\" The word comes from the Greek ÎºÎ±ÏÎ·Î³Î¿ÏÎ¯Î±, katÄgoria, meaning \"that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something.\" A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. \"â¦I remark concerning the categoriesâ¦that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects.\" Kant called them \"ontological predicates.\" A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. John Stuart Mill wrote: \"The Categories, or Predicamentsâthe former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin languageâwere believed to be an enumeration of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the summa genera (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever.\" Aristotle had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because \" â¦ as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him...\" The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of\n\nCategory (Kant)\n\n10001199\n\nAlan Scott LeDoux (January 7, 1949 â August 11, 2011) was a politician, professional heavyweight boxer, professional wrestler, and referee. Career Boxing LeDoux began his professional boxing career in 1974. His first boxing match was a knockout victory over Arthur Pullens. LeDoux's final bout in 1983 was a technical knockout loss to Frank Bruno. LeDoux retired from the ring with a record of 33-13-4 (including 22 knockouts). LeDoux's opponents included Ken Norton, Ron Lyle, Gerrie Coetzee, Leon Spinks, Greg Page, Frank Bruno, George Foreman, Mike Weaver, and Larry Holmes. In his match with Leon Spinks, LeDoux earned a 'draw', just months before Spinks defeated Ali. He also knocked off broadcaster Howard Cosell's toupee in a scuffle that followed a losing effort with Johnny Boudreaux. LeDoux insisted the fight was fixed by Don King and he ranted to Cosell to \"Tell it like it is\" mimicking Cosell's famous catch phrase. A pushing match ensued and in the process, Cosell's headset along with his toupee was dislodged by an errant LeDoux shove in front of live ABC cameras. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece from the floor and replaced it on top of his head. LeDoux also took part in a five round exhibition match with Muhammad Ali. LeDoux over the course of his career also sparred with Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. LeDoux's best achievements were that he scored draws against Leon Spinks and an aging Ken Norton, who won the first 8 rounds clear but then tired. But Scott nearly knocked out the past-his-peak Ken Norton in round ten, when after some confusion as to whether the ref had signalled the fight over or not it was declared a draw. On April 22, 1976, LeDoux lost to fellow Minnesotan Duane Bobick before a crowd of 13,789, which is still a Minnesota record. LeDoux later worked as a ringside commentator for ESPN and in 1986 as a referee for the American Wrestling Association. It was announced on July 5, 2010 that LeDoux would be a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the Minnesota Boxing Hall of Fame. Politics LeDoux was elected to the Anoka County, Minnesota Board of County Commissioners and re-elected in 2008, defeating challenger Becky Fink. In 2006, the Minnesota Legislature authorized the creation of a state Boxing Commission, the Minnesota Board of Boxing having gone out of existence in 2001 with the retirement of longtime Boxing Commissioner and Executive Secretary Jimmy O'Hara (LeDoux and O'Hara had served together on the Minnesota Board of Boxing for 18 years). LeDoux was appointed boxing commissioner by the state Governor Tim Pawlenty. In August 2006 LeDoux was also named Executive Director of the Minnesota Combative Sports Commission. Controversy In 2007, the Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, Melanie Benjamin, objected to LeDoux's public criticism of her band and their boxing matches at the Grand Casino Hinckley Casino in Hinckley, Minnesota. In November 2007, LeDoux was accused by boxing promoter John Hoffman of \"insulting and assaulting\" him at a\n\nScott LeDoux\n\n1000128\n\nThe Terry Fox Run is an annual non-competitive charity event held around the world to raise money for cancer research in commemoration of Canadian cancer activist Terry Fox and his Marathon of Hope. The event was founded in 1981 by Isadore Sharp, who had contacted Terry in hospital by telegram and expressed his wishes to hold an annual run in Terry's name to raise funds for cancer research. Sharp had lost his son to cancer in 1979. The event is held every year on the second Sunday following Labour Day. Since its inception, it has raised via the 'Terry Fox Foundation' over $750 million (CAD). The run is informal which means that the distance often varies, usually between 5 and 15 kilometres; participation is considered to be more important than completing the set distance. There are also runs set up by schools of every level, often with shorter distances than the \"official\" ones. The Terry Fox Run has no corporate sponsorship, in accordance with Terry Fox's original wishes of not seeking fame or fortune from his endeavour. During his cross-Canada run, he rejected every endorsement he was offered (including from multinational corporations such as McDonald's), as he felt that it would detract from his goal of creating public awareness. The Terry Fox Runs have no advertisements on any race related materials (such as T-shirts, banners, etc.). History The Terry Fox Foundation was founded in 1988 after it separated from the Canadian Cancer Society. Since its inception, The Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $800 million for cancer research. Currently, Terry Fox Runs take place every year with many participants from all over the world. The Run is a volunteer led, all-inclusive, non-competitive event with no corporate sponsorship, incentives or fundraising minimums. Fox laid out these wishes before his death in 1981. In 2007 The Terry Fox Foundation created the Terry Fox Research Institute to conduct transnational research to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, The Terry Fox Foundation directed $27.7 million to its cancer research programs. The Terry Fox Foundation has expanded beyond the traditional Run as well, by holding various other events. These events include National School Run Day, where schools throughout Canada hold a Run to commemorate Fox and raise funds, and The Great Canadian Hair \"Do\", which is a fundraising event that can take place at any time of the year. Participants are able to make the event as creative as they wantâ shave their heads, dye their hair a wacky colour, include a manly leg wax, and recruit friends to shave their heads as well. Debuts by country Canada -September 13, 1981, at 760 sites Cuba - 1998. In 2005, over 1.9 million people used 3,600 sites. In 2006, it had around 2.6 million participants. The tenth run in 2007 had 4,652 sites and 2.267 million runners.

It is the subject of popular or pseudohistorical speculation on Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. The pattern was first described as a possible Native American carving in 1873. The identification as a \"medieval knight\" dates to 1954. Early references The rock and carving are first mentioned in print in an 1873 edition of the \"Gazetteer of Massachusetts\" and was described as \"There upon its face a rude figure, supposed to have been cut by some Indian Artist.\" In an 1883 town history, the carving is described as \"A broad ledge which crops out near the house of William Kitteredge has upon its surface grooves made by glaciers. Rude outlines of the human face have been traced upon it, and the figure is said to be the work of Indians.\" The carving was subsequently interpreted not as a human figure but as a broken Norse Sword by William Goodwin in his book on the America's Stonehenge site. Frank Glynn, president of the Archaeological Society of Connecticut, re-located the carving and following discussions with T. C. Lethbridge about Goodwin's theory, chalked in a full figure in 1954, resembling a medieval knight, with a sword and shield, and he is usually said to be the \"discoverer of the Westford Knight.\" It was Lethbridge who suggested to Glynn that the sword was not of Viking origin, but was \"a hand-and-a-half wheel pommel sword\" common in 14th century North Britain. Contemporary interpretations Archaeologist Ken Feder has compared weathering on the stone with weathering on New England gravestones whose inscriptions have become indecipherable in the last twenty years, while \"the Westford petroglyph, rather miraculously, appears to have improved through time, getting fresher every year with new elements appearing that previously had gone unnoticed. In truth, this simply isnât possible. The new imagery on the Westford Knight stone either has been recently added or is entirely imaginary, and probably a bit of both.\" He argues that the Indian petroglyph described in the 19th century probably existed as did the parallel glacial striations, and that later a metal row or awl was used to punch the partial shape of a sword into the rock, and that \"The knight in all his regalia resides only in the imagination of Frank Glynn. Other imagesâfor example, a boat, which I could not discern on my visitsâmay have been added later.\" The current interpretation by those who advocate that the feature on the rock is a human figure is that it commemorates a fallen member of the party of Henry Sinclair, a Scottish Earl from Orkney, whom some believe to have made a voyage to the New World in 1398, traveling to Nova Scotia and New England. According to Raymond Ramsey in 1972, the shield carried by the knight in the image was\n\nWestford Knight\n\n10001462\n\nMario Scheiber (born March 6, 1983, in Sankt Jakob in Defereggen) is an Austrian former skier who competed in all World Cup disciplines apart from slalom. He first started in a World Cup race on March 15, 2003, in Lillehammer. However, it was not until season 2004/5 that he would start again in the World Cup, this time on a regular basis, finishing second twice and third once. In season 2005/6 he participated in only one race because of a training injury. However, he had a successful comeback in season 2006/7, finishing in podium positions several times. Biography Scheiber lives in St. Jakob in Defereggen and graduated from the ski high school in Stams. Very early he joined the ski club of his hometown and soon he was accepted into the squad of the Tyrolean Ski Association. As a 15-year-old, he competed in his first FIS races in November 1998. Scheiber turned into a good all-rounder. In 2000, he became three-time Austrian youth champion in his age group (downhill, super-G and slalom) and was subsequently accepted into the junior squad of the Austrian Ski Association (ÃSV). In January 2001, he made his first appearance in the European Cup at the races in Altenmarkt-Zauchensee, but was still far from scoring points. Three weeks later he finished twelfth in the slalom at the 2001 Junior World Championships. After further European Cup races without points in January and February 2002, Scheiber won the silver medal in the downhill at the Junior World Championships in 2002 and thus made it into the B squad of the ÃSV. In the 2002/03 season, Scheiber already achieved several top 10 placements in the European Cup. On February 19, he stood on the podium for the first time with third place in the downhill of Tarvisio. Shortly afterwards, he won the gold medal in the giant slalom and bronze in the super-G at the 2003 Junior World Championships, at the same time as the Swiss Daniel Albrecht. As junior world champion he was first allowed to start in the world cup at the season finale in Hajfell, though he dropped out in the second round of giant slalom. Scheiber became Austrian champion in super-G in March 2003 and after that winter was promoted to the A-squad of the Austrian ski organization. On December 18 in 2003 he claimed his first win in the European cup at the downhill of the Tonale Pass and by getting to the podium three more times in the season of 2003/04 he came in fifth in the overall standings and third in each of the downhill and super-G rankings, which guaranteed him a spot in those disciplines for the world cup in the upcoming winter. In his third world cup race in the season of 2004/05 Scheiber was already able to claim the third spot on the podium in the super-G of Beaver Creek. In February and March, he continued his run with two second places in the downhills of Garmisch-Patenkirchen and Kvitjfell.\n\nMario Scheiber\n\n1000153\n\nCastle Walk is a dance originated and made famous by Vernon and Irene Castle. The moniker was coined from the Castle's signature dance step styling, and their touring stage show of 1913 lead with this as their signature. The Castle Walk became popular through its introduction into the Tango. \"Castle Walk\" is also a popular American song composed for Vernon and Irene Castle by James Reese Europe (1880â1919) and Ford Thompson Dabney (1883â1958). It was first recorded in 1914, commissioned by the Castles to accompany and provide music for their social dancing programs, having been one of these resulting pieces. Though many dance accompaniments of the time are syncopated rhythms, Castle Walk in particular carries syncopation in half-measure. The dance In this dance, the man (the leader) continually goes forward and the lady (the follower) backward. In order that the lady may be properly guided about the room, the man's arm encircles her right under her arm, while her left hand rests on the man's right arm. The position of the lady's right arm and the man's left arm is high, with their hands clasped, as portrayed in the illustration. The man starts forward with his left foot and the lady backward with her right, walking with gliding steps, keeping on the toes to one count of the music with each step. This is continued to the end of the room, where a large circle is begun, which is gradually made smaller and smaller, until it is ended by whirling completely around three times to corresponding counts of the music, ending with a dip. The three whirls must be done rapidly to accomplish a complete revolution to one beat of the music. The Castle Walk may be varied by describing the figure eight or zig-zag instead of the large circle in the steps taken. Troy Kinney describes the Castle Walk as part of One-Step as follows: This is a walking step of direct advance and retreat, not used to move to the side. The couple are in closed position, the woman, therefore, stepping backward as the man steps forward, and vice versa. The advancing foot is planted in fourth position, the knee straight, the toe down so that the ball of the foot strikes the floor first. The walk presents an appearance of strutting, although the shoulders are held level, and the body firm; a sharp twist that punctuates each step is effected by means of pivoting on the supporting foot. The shoulder and hip movements that originally characterized the \"trot\" are no longer practiced in the dance. The song \"The Castle Walk,\" trot and one-step, Jos. W.

It's about an employment agency for out-of-work cartoon characters. Some of the comics characters include: Bixby, the former child star and now a dirty rat; Fritz, a dog and boss of the agency; Hamhock, a pig who is trying to get his 15 minutes of fame; Captain Victorious, a lazy super hero with a would-be sidekick, Scrappy Lad, that he doesn't want; Ralston, a rabbit who is just looking for a higher group of people, and Tyr, the Norse god of single combat, trying to pull his decent weight around anger management and Valhallan Attitude. There is also Dynaman, the rival of Captain Victorious; Mr. Negato, the enemy of Captain Victorious, and Scrappy Lad, the useless weak sidekick who is more interested in a girl named Moxie Gumption (a more streetwise version of Little Orphan Annie). Jenn Erica is a female filler character who tries repeatedly to get a lead character. Hela is the Norse goddess of the Underworld, with a surprisingly cheerful disposition. She claims to be related to Tyr, but their kinship is rather tenuous. Ms. Amazement gives the impression of being a parody of Wonder Woman, but her background is Celtic rather than Greek. the daily strip went in reruns, with plans to have new weekly comics running concurrently after a brief hiatus.

The ship was named after Mark Hanna Crouter (1897â1942), U.S. Navy officer and Navy Cross recipient. Namesake Mark Hanna Crouter was born on 3 October 1897 in Baker, Oregon. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy on 7 June 1919. After extensive service at sea and ashore, he served as executive officer on the heavy cruiser . He was killed in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. Construction and commissioning Crouter originally was intended for transfer to the United Kingdom as BDE-11, but was instead retained by the U.S. Navy. She was laid down on 8 February 1942 at the Boston Navy Yard at Boston, Massachusetts and launched on 26 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. M. H. Crouter, widow of Commander Crouter. She was commissioned on 25 May 1943. Service history Departing Boston on 24 July 1943, Crouter deployed to the Pacific Ocean for World War II service. She reached NoumÃ©a, New Caledonia, on 3 September 1943. After several convoy escort voyages to Efate and Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides and to Viti Levu in the Fiji Islands, she escorted convoys between NoumÃ©a and Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons, aiding in the consolidation of the Solomon Islands until 31 March 1944. After overhaul on the United States West Coast, Crouter escorted a convoy from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to Eniwetok between 14 June 1944 and 3 July 1944. Returning to Pearl Harbor, Crouter conducted submarine training exercises, and rescued nine survivors of a crashed PBY Catalina flying boat on 15 July 1944. She departed Pearl Harbor on 3 August 1944 for continued operations with submarines from Majuro between 13 August and 24 October 1944. Arriving at Eniwetok on 26 October 1944, Crouter operated out of that port as convoy escort to Ulithi Atoll, Kossol Roads, and Saipan until 15 March 1945. At San Pedro Bay, Leyte, in the Philippine Islands, Crouter joined the screen of the transport convoy bound for Okinawa, arriving on 1 April 1945 for the invasion landings. She remained on patrol off Okinawa, joining a hunter-killer group from 19 April 1945 to 28 April 1945. Her service in anti-aircraft work included shooting down two suicide planes. Crouter reported to Guam on 21 May 1945 for training with submarines, remaining there through the end of the war and until 18 September 1945. Crouter returned to the United States at San Pedro, California, on 5 October 1945, and was decommissioned on 30 November 1945. She was sold for scrapping on 25 November 1946.

Some of these political positions have changed, while others have remained unchanged. In 1994, during his campaign for US Senate in Massachusetts, \"Romney has cast himself as a moderate Republican, socially liberal and fiscally conservative\" and The New York Times likened his views to those of Governor William F. Weld. During his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, Romney described himself as a centrist saying of himself: \"I'm someone who is moderate, and ... my views are progressive.\" The Boston Globe, reporting on the 2004 Republican National Convention list of speakers, wrote that \"Massachusetts Republicans with moderate positions on most social issues, Romney and [Lt.

Kerry] Healey also fit into the moderate tone that the Bush campaign wants to project for its [2004] convention.\" In 2005, Romney described his views as being \"moderate on the national scene.\" However, in 2007, Romney launched his first presidential campaign and referred to himself as consistently conservative. In 2011, again running a presidential campaign, he described himself as being \"'in sync' with the conservative Tea Party.\" In 2012, speaking at CPAC, a conservative political action committee, Romney described his tenure as a 'severely conservative' Governor of Massachusetts. Since 2019, while serving as a United States Senator from Utah, Romney was considered to be among the Senate's moderate Republicans. In 2012, Gallup surveyed Americans about their perceptions of presidential candidates and 45% perceived Mitt Romney as conservative, 29% as moderate, and 12% as liberal with 14% having no opinion about his ideology. In 2016, Romney considered endorsing and voting for the Libertarian Party's presidential ticket. Romney announced that he did not plan to make an endorsement for president in 2020. He was one of three Republican Senators, the others being Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, who refused to co-sponsor a resolution opposing the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. He was one of two Republicans voting with Democrats to allow witnesses during the impeachment trial, being disinvited from CPAC as a result. In February 2020, he became the sole Republican to vote in favor of convicting President Trump under the first article of impeachment. In the U.S. Senate, as of January 2021, Romney had voted with President Trump on legislative issues about 75% of the time. As of October 2022, he has voted with President Biden's legislative positions about 56.4% of the time. Economic policy Agriculture In his 1994 Senate campaign, Romney called for the \"virtual elimination\" of the federal Department of Agriculture and for reductions in farm subsidies. In 2007, when questioned about these views, a Romney for President Iowa campaign spokesman responded: \"Governor Romney believes that investing in agriculture is key to our economy and\n\nPolitical positions of Mitt Romney\n\n10001629\n\nThe Moneychangers is a 1975 novel written by Arthur Hailey. The plot revolves around the politics inside a major bank. Plot summary As the novel begins, the position of CEO of one of America's largest banks, First Mercantile American, is about to become vacant due to the terminal illness of Ben Roselli, the incumbent chief, whose grandfather founded the bank. Two high-ranking executives groomed for the succession begin their personal combat for the position. One, Alex Vandervoort, is honest, hard-charging, and focused on growing FMA through retail banking and embracing emerging technology; the other, Roscoe Heyward, is suave, hypocritical, and skilled in boardroom politics, and favors catering more to business than to consumers. Heyward lives in a \"rambling, three-story house in the suburb of Shaker Heights,\" Cleveland, Ohio. Many characters and plot lines interweave. Senior bank teller Miles Eastin is discovered to be defrauding the bank whilst casting guilt on another teller, a young single mother named Juanita Nunez. He is dismissed, arrested, and convicted. While in prison, he is gang-raped by a gang of fellow inmates. In prison, his knowledge of counterfeiting brings him to the attention of a gang of credit card forgers, who offer him a job on his release. Owing money to loan sharks, and desperate not to have to go to work for a criminal organization, he tries going back to his former employer to ask for some kind of job. Nolan Wainwright, the bank's Head of Security, obviously won't hire him to work directly for the bank, but with the approval of higher management, is allowed to pay Eastin to go undercover as an affiliate of the forgers and secretly report back details of their operation to Juanita Nunez, who had forgiven him after he came to see her and apologize for what he did. She agrees to be the \"cut-out\" whom Eastin will contact, and she will report back what he tells her to Wainwright. Eastin is discovered to be a planted spy by the criminal organization and tortured, only to be rescued in the nick of time as a result of Juanita being captured by the forgers and forced to identify Eastin. She is released, but uses her photographic memory to count the amount of time she spent blindfolded in the car and the movements it made, and as a result is able to lead police to the safe house where Eastin was being held and tortured. At the end, Eastin, Juanita and her daughter, Estella, move out of the state where both get new jobs. Also featured is Edwina D'Orsey, the head of FMA's flagship downtown branch, through whom a reader gains much insight into day-to-day branch banking, and her husband, Lewis, who writes a financial newsletter. As readers increasingly appreciate Vandervoort, the protagonist, they learn of his troubled personal life. His advancement in banking circles has come as his marriage is failing; his wife Celia is confined to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Vandervoort is shown as having developed a relationship\n\nThe Moneychangers\n\n1000165\n\nTsiolkovskiy is a large lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. Named for Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, it lies in the southern hemisphere, to the west of the large crater Gagarin, and northwest of Milne. Just to the south is Waterman, with Neujmin to the south-southwest. The crater protrudes into the neighbouring Fermi, an older crater of comparable size that does not have a lava-flooded floor. Tsiolkovskiy is one of the largest craters of Upper (Late) Imbrian age. Characteristics Tsiolkovskiy is one of the most prominent features on the far side of the Moon. It possesses high, terraced inner walls and a well-formed central peak, which rises over 3200 m above the floor of the crater. The floor is unusual for a crater on the far side, as it is covered by the dark-hued mare that is characteristic of the maria found on the near side. The distribution of the mare material is not symmetrical across the floor, but is instead more heavily concentrated to the east and south. There is also a protruding bay of darker material that reaches the wall to the west-northwest. The remainder of the floor has the same albedo as the terrain surrounding the crater. A row of small craters in Mendeleev crater far to the northeast are called Catena Mendeleev, and the row points directly at Tsiolkovsky. For this reason the craters are believed to be secondaries from the Tsiolkovsky impact. This feature was discovered on photographs sent back by the Russian spacecraft Luna 3, and was subsequently imaged by several of the American Lunar Orbiters and then by Apollo astronauts. Apollo 17 Astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt and other scientists (Schmitt was the only trained scientist, a geologist, to walk on the Moon) strongly advocated Tsiolkovskiy as the landing site of Apollo 17, using small communications satellites deployed from the Command/Service Module for communication from the far side of the Moon. NASA vetoed the idea as too risky, and Apollo 17 instead landed in the TaurusâLittrow valley on December 11, 1972. Views Satellite craters By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Tsiolkovskiy.

It has a flat stone (the batÃ¡n proper) and a grinding stone called an uÃ±a. The uÃ±a is held in both hands and rocked over the food in the batÃ¡n. Depending on the process wished, the uÃ±a's weight is slightly held back, let loose over, or pressed on. The rocking movements also vary depending on the procedure. The grinding is done dry or with water or oil. South America The batÃ¡n has been used since before the arrival of Spaniards in South America. In Andean households many different dishes are prepared in this manner, in rural and urban areas. The most important use it has is for preparing llajwa. For many Bolivians, Peruvians, Ecuadoreans and Colombians it is not the same when done in a blender. It is also used to husk grains, wash quinoa from its alkaloid (saponin), grind grains, crush papalisa and even to prepare small quantities of flour. South Asia In Nepal, it is known as silauto-lohoro. It is also used in India in a large number of households. It is known there as \"sil-batta\" in Hindi with sil referring to flat stone and batta referring to a cylindrical grinding stone. It is known as pata-varvanta in Marathi and used in the state of Maharashtra. It is known as ammi kallu in Tamil and Malayalam. It is known as \"shil nora\" in Bengali and is basically found to be used in almost every household in West Bengal. In Odisha, it is called sila puaa where it is also worshipped as Bhu Devi or mother Earth during traditional Odia weddings and the Raja festival. It is traditionally used to grind spices and lentils in the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. These grinding stones are primarily used to prepare chutney and spice mixes for cooking and occasional use including grinding soaked lentils in preparation for dosas, vadas, or papadum.

Rock formations are usually the result of weathering and erosion sculpting the existing rock. The term rock formation can also refer to specific sedimentary strata or other rock unit in stratigraphic and petrologic studies. A rock structure can be created in any rock type or combination: Igneous rocks are created when molten rock cools and solidifies, with or without crystallisation. They may be either plutonic bodies or volcanic extrusive. Again, erosive forces sculpt their current forms. Metamorphic rocks are created by rocks that have been transformed into another kind of rock, usually by some combination of heat, pressure, and chemical alteration. Sedimentary rocks are created by a variety of processes but usually involving deposition, grain by grain, layer by layer, in water or, in the case of terrestrial sediments, on land through the action of wind or sometimes moving ice. Erosion later exposes them in their current form. Geologists have created a number of terms to describe different rock structures in the landscape that can be formed by natural processes: Butte Cliff Cut bank Escarpment Gorge Inselberg, or monadnock Mesa Peak Promontory River cliff Sea cliff Stack Stone run Tor Here is a list of rock formations by continent.
