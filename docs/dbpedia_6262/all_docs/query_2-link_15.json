        "text": "Many people celebrate their birthday. What better way to celebrate it than to win an Olympic medal on one’s birthday? And this has happened at the Olympics, in fact, 86 athletes have done it 90 times.\n\nOnly one athlete has won 3 Olympic medals on his/her birthday and that was French archer Eugène Richez, who won 2 silvers and a bronze in team target archery events at the 1900 Olympics. Those Olympics were so unusual, and the archery events were especially so, so let’s look at the 2 athletes who have won 2 medals on his/her birthday.\n\nThe first was Sidney Merlin, a British shooter who won a gold and bronze medal in 2 trap shooting events at the 1906 Olympics and, again, the 1906 Olympics are somewhat controversial.\n\nSo that leaves only German equestrian Michael Jung who won 2 gold medals on 31 July 2012 in eventing, the day he turned 30-years-old. Jung is the only Olympian to have won 2 gold medals on his/her birthday – a fact that seemed to escape most of the world’s media in London, including our OlympStats group, to be fair.\n\nHow many athletes have won gold medals on their birthday, the ultimate celebration? That has been done 32 times, by 31 Olympians, with Jung winning 2 in 2012. That has been done 6 times at the Winter Olympics, and 26 times at the Summer Games. Seven women have won an Olympic gold medal on their birthday, two at the Winter Olympics – Madeleine Chamot-Berthod (SUI) in downhill skiing at the 1956 Cortina Olympics, and Cathrine Lindahl (SWE) in 2010 curling.\n\nSo Lindahl won her gold medal in a team event. How often have Olympians won medals or gold medals in individual events, probably the uber-ultimate birthday present? That has been done 29 times, by 28 athletes, with Merlin winning two in 1906 on his 26 April birthday.\n\nWinning an individual gold medal on your birthday is fairly rare, done only 13 times by 13 Olympians. The only woman to have done it is Chamot-Berthod at the 1956 Winter Olympics – no woman has done it at the Summer Olympics. Only 4 Winter Olympians have pulled this off while it has been done 9 times at the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe youngest birthday medalist was Mariya Filatova, actually a gold medalist in the 1976 gymnastics team all-around, on her 15th birthday. The oldest was Richez, who was 56-years-old when he won his 3 medals in 1900 archery on 5 August. Again, discounting him, the next oldest was Merlin in 1906, who was 50-years-old, so we’ll look further, and find that William Dod was 41-years-old in 1908 when he won a gold medal on his birthday (18 July) in Double York Round archery. The oldest female to pull this off was Lindahl in curling, who was 40-years-old on 26 February 2010. The youngest man was Jamaican Greg Meghoo, a silver medalist in the 4×100 relay, when he turned 19 on 11 August 1984.\n\nNot easy to do and if you want to do this, in addition to being a great athlete, you better hope to have been born in February, July, or August anymore.\n\nHere is the complete list of the 90 birthday medals:\n\nSidney Merlin (M / GBR / Summer) (1906 Shooting;

They are as follows:\n\nAlpine Skiing – mixed team event\n\nCurling – mixed doubles event\n\nSnowboarding – Big Air for men / women\n\nSpeed Skating – mass start for men / women\n\nIn addition, snowboarding will lose two events – parallel special slalom for men and women.\n\nThis will bring the Winter Olympic Program to a total of 102 events, the first time the Winter Olympics have had more than 100 events. The following is how the Program has inflated over the years at the Olympic Winter Games. The biggest changes have occurred in 2002, with the addition of 10 events, and 2014, when 12 events were added.\n\n[table]\n\nYear,Men,Wom,Mix,Total,Men%,Wom%,Mix%\n\n1908,2,1,1,4,50.0%,25.0%,25.0%\n\n1920,2,1,1,4,50.0%,25.0%,25.0%\n\n1924,14,1,1,16,87.5%,6.3%,6.3%\n\n1928,12,1,1,14,85.7%,7.1%,7.1%\n\n1932,12,1,1,14,85.7%,7.1%,7.1%\n\n1936,14,2,1,17,82.4%,11.8%,5.9%\n\n1948,17,4,1,22,77.3%,18.2%,4.5%\n\n1952,16,5,1,22,72.7%,22.7%,4.5%\n\n1956,17,6,1,24,70.8%,25.0%,4.2%\n\n1960,16,10,1,27,59.3%,37.0%,3.7%\n\n1964,20,12,2,34,58.8%,35.3%,5.9%\n\n1968,21,12,2,35,60.0%,34.3%,5.7%\n\n1972,21,12,2,35,60.0%,34.3%,5.7%\n\n1976,22,12,3,37,59.5%,32.4%,8.1%\n\n1980,23,12,3,38,60.5%,31.6%,7.9%\n\n1984,23,13,3,39,59.0%,33.3%,7.7%\n\n1988,27,16,3,46,58.7%,34.8%,6.5%\n\n1992,31,23,3,57,54.4%,40.4%,5.3%\n\n1994,33,25,3,61,54.1%,41.0%,4.9%\n\n1998,36,29,3,68,52.9%,42.6%,4.4%\n\n2002,41,34,3,78,52.6%,43.6%,3.8%\n\n2006,44,37,3,84,52.4%,44.0%,3.6%\n\n2010,45,38,3,86,52.3%,44.2%,3.5%\n\n2014,49,43,6,98,50.0%,43.9%,6.1%\n\n2018,50,44,8,102,49.0%,43.1%,7.8%\n\nTotals,608,394,60,1062,57.3%,37.1%,5.6%\n\n[/table]\n\nSo after 2018, there will have been 1,062 Winter Olympic events, or 1,054, if you wish to include the 1908 and 1920 figure skating and ice hockey as part of the Summer Olympics, and not include them as Winter Olympic events. So one of the 2018 Winter Olympic events will be the 1,000th event at the Winter Olympics – can’t tell you which one until the schedule comes out, and with weather problems and re-scheduling at the Winter Games, probably not until it actually happens.\n\nBy comparison, through 2012, the Summer Olympics will have had 4,856 events (the numbers for 1900 and 1904 are always disputed), including 1906, or 4,782, if you wish to be a purist, and omit 1906, as the IOC does. (The International Society of Olympic Historians [ISOH] considers the 1906 Games as Olympic Games.)\n\nThe last time a Summer Olympics had less than 100 events was at St. Louis in 1904, with 95 events. There were 302 events at both the 2008 Beijing and the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nThis continues the IOC policy of trying to equalize the program in terms of gender equity. However, because there are more mixed events now (8 in 2018), the men’s and women’s percentages both go down slightly. However, men will be competing in 56.8% of the events on the 2018 Winter Program, and women in 50.9% of the available events, counting the mixed events.\n\nCounting sports and disciplines, there will be no change in 2018 as no new disciplines were added. Here is the breakdown for the various sports-disciplines at the Winter Olympics. Women do not compete in Nordic combined, as the men do. The only other sport in which women have not competed is military patrol, which was on the program in 1924, and is somewhat similar to a biathlon mass start team event. Women also have only one event in bobsledding, unlike the men, who have two; and only one event in ski jumping, while the men have three.\n\n[table]\n\nYear,Men,Women,Mixed,Total\n\n1908,1,1,1,1\n\n1920,2,1,1,2\n\n1924,9,1,1,9\n\n1928,8,1,1,8\n\n1932,7,1,1,7\n\n1936,8,2,1,8\n\n1948,9,2,1,9\n\n1952,8,3,1,8\n\n1956,8,3,1,8\n\n1960,8,4,1,8\n\n1964,10,5,2,10\n\n1968,10,5,2,10\n\n1972,10,5,2,10\n\n1976,10,5,2,10\n\n1980,10,5,2,10\n\n1984,10,5,2,10\n\n1988,10,5,2,10\n\n1992,12,8,2,12\n\n1994,12,8,2,12\n\n1998,14,11,2,14\n\n2002,15,13,2,15\n\n2006,15,13,2,15\n\n2010,15,13,2,15\n\n2014,15,14,3,15\n\n2018,15,14,5,15\n\nTotals,16,14,5,16\n\n[/table]\n\nAppearing on the cover of Vanity Fair last week, Caitlyn Jenner revealed her new identity and name to the world. She was previously known as Bruce Jenner, and was the 1976 Olympic decathlon champion. Probably the most famous transgender worldwide, Jenner’s definitely the most famous transgender Olympian. But is she also the first?\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nJenner after winning Olympic decathlon gold in 1976.\n\nThe answer is, as you might expect on this site, no. As far as we know, Jenner is the second transgender Olympian, the first one being Balian Buschbaum, who announced his gender reassignment surgery in 2008. Under the name Yvonne, Buschbaum had competed in the women’s pole vault at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The reigning European Junior Champion, she placed a credible sixth.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nBuschbaum after winning a medal at the 2002 European Championships\n\nJenner and Buschbaum are not the only transgender athletes in history, of course. A few famous examples:\n\nIn the 1930s, Czechoslovakian middle distance runner Zdena Koubková, winner of the 800m at the 1934 Women’s World Games, underwent surgery to become Zdeněk Koubek.\n\nIn 1979, tennis player Renée Richards reached the third round of the US Open ladies’ singles, and semi-finals in mixed doubles. She had been born as Richard Raskind, and had competed in the men’s tournament in the 1950s. Richards had to go through a long legal battle before being allowed to play, but she achieved a landmark victory for transgender rights in sports.\n\n1986 European shot put champion Heidi Krieger (DDR) became Andreas in 1997, although this was heavily influenced by the immense doses of anabolic steroids that Krieger had received from the DDR doping program as an athlete.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAndreas Krieger, formerly known as shot putter Heidi Krieger.\n\nBoth Jenner and Buschbaum only underwent gender reassignment after their Olympic appearances. To our best knowledge, no Olympians have competed after transgender surgery. It may only be a matter of time before transgender athletes do compete, as transgender athletes are appearing in several sports, such as cyclists Natalie van Gogh (Netherlands) and Michelle Dumaresq (Canada). However, their involvement in sport is still controversial. Especially in the case of men becoming women, many perceive this as an unfair competitive advantage. While transgenders might have some physical advantages (such as a greater height), their hormone treatments actually puts them at a disadvantage compared to their competitors.\n\nA glimpse of the expected controversy of transgenders competing in the Olympics might be seen by looking at intersexual athletes. Often confused with transgenders, intersexuals have both male and female characteristics from birth. Some, but not all also decide to undergo surgery to become either a man or a woman. The history of intersexuals in the Olympics has been troublesome.\n\nPolish sprinter Stanisława Walasiewicz (also known as Stella Walsh), who won the 100 m at the 1932 Olympics, had on several occasions been accused of being a man. Upon her death, it was revealed she was a gynandromorph, implying normal external sexual characteristics, but mixed internal sexual organs. In many sources, however, this is (still) simplified to her being a man.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\n1932 sprint champion Walasiewicz and 1936 champion Stephens.\n\nA contemporary of Walasiewciz, German high jumper Dora Ratjen, fourth at the 1936 Olympics, was “exposed” as a man after winning the 1938 European Championships. Ratjen was, in fact, intersexual, and had been raised as a girl. Ratjen did officially register as a man subsequently, under the name of Heinz.\n\nDue to suspicions that some (Eastern European) female athletes competing in the 1950s and 1960s were in fact men, the IOC and other sports federations introduced so- called “sex-tests”. Polish sprinter Ewa Kłobukowska, Olympic relay champion in 1964, was banned from sports in 1967 after failing the original IOC gender test (see below). Kłobukowska would have passed later versions of the test, and to prove her womanhood, she gave birth to a son in 1968.\n\nAnother noted victim of the sex tests was 1966 giant slalom champion Erika Schinegger. Prior to the Grenoble Winter Olympics, she failed a sex test due to being intersexual, and was not allowed to compete. Schinegger later officially became a man, Erik Schinegger.\n\nIn the 1990s, prompted among others by lawsuits by Spanish hurdler Maria José Martínez-Patiño, most sports governing bodies abandoned the tests.\n\nThe whole concept of gender identity is a difficult one, both in sports and scientifically and psychologically in society, and in sports it has a long history. In the 1960s, concern about the problem of men posing as women to gain a competitive advantage led to the introduction of gender verification by the IOC, at the time called sex testing. Several female track & field athletes were then suspected of being genetically male.\n\nFrom 1968-88, all women wishing to compete in the Olympics were required to undergo sex testing, with one exception, that being Princess Anne of Great Britain, who competed in the 1976 Olympics in the equestrian events. Testing was initially done by obtaining a buccal smear, or a scraping of the cells of the inner wall of the mouth. The cells were examined for the presence of a Barr body, which occurs almost exclusively in females. Females are genetically labeled as XX, while men are labeled as XY, those being the classifications of the respective sex chromosomes. The second X chromosome possessed by women contains a structure termed the Barr body.\n\nThough some men did attempt to breach the rules and compete as women, the entire subject of mixed sexual characteristics is a highly complex and emotional one. A number of people with mixed sexual identity may have elected to compete as women for psychological reasons. In addition, doctors typically label babies with indeterminate genitalia as women. And in certain cases of mixed sex classification, some people who would be considered women lack a Barr body, and would thus have been disqualified.\n\nBecause of these problems, the test was later changed and the buccal smear no longer used. Women were then cleared for international competition by doctors after simply undergoing a physical examination. In the late 1980s, this method was replaced by a polymerase chain reaction evaluation, looking for the Y-linked SRY gene (sex-determining region Y), and this method was used at both the 1992 and 1996 Olympics\n\nBut problems still existed. It was noted that the test failed to exclude all potential impostors, was discriminatory against women with disorders of sexual development, and could be psychologically devastating for a female athlete failing such a test. Thus, during the 1996 IOC World Conference on Women and Health, the IOC passed a resolution “to discontinue the current process of gender verification during the Olympic Games.” The IOC Athletes’ Commission recommended to the IOC Executive Board in January 1999 that gender identification should be eliminated, and this decision was ratified by the IOC Executive Board in June 1999.\n\nHowever, the IOC Medical Commission addressed the issue of sex reassignment in 2003-2004. Their recommendations were approved by the IOC Executive Board in May 2004. The conclusions of this study were: 1) individuals undergoing sex reassignment of male to female before puberty should be regarded as girls and women (female); 2) individuals undergoing sex reassignment of female to male before puberty should be regarded as boys and men (male); 3) individuals undergoing sex reassignment from male to female after puberty (and vice versa) be eligible for participation in female or male competitions, respectively, under the following conditions: 3a) surgical anatomical changes have been completed, including external genitalia changes and gonadectomy; 3b) legal recognition of the assigned sex has been conferred by the appropriate official authorities; 3c) hormonal therapy appropriate for the assigned sex has been administered in a verifiable manner and for a sufficient length of time to minimize gender-related advantages in sport competitions; 3d) eligibility should begin no sooner than two years after gonadectomy; and 4) evaluation will occur on a confidential case-by-case basis.\n\nThe entire subject is very difficult, in many ways. Interestingly, Renée Richards, described above as playing on the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) tour after changing to female gender, has come to believe that the IOC ruling is incorrect, and that men changing to women should not be allowed to compete at the highest levels of sport, because they could have an advantage. Of note, Richards is a medical doctor and likely understands all aspects of this discussion far better than anyone. See her interview and discussion on the topic here.\n\nAll these multiple administrative decisions paved the way for Brazilian judoka Edinanci Silva to compete in the Olympics from 1996 through 2008. Born intersexual, she underwent surgery to become a woman.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEdinanci da Silva after winning at the 2007 Pan American Games.\n\nBut the abolition of gender testing did not kill all controversy. In 2009, South African Castor Semenya won the women’s 800 m at the athletics World Championships. There were wild speculations about her being a man and/or having a genetic disorder. The IAAF responded non-tactfully and with a re-instated gender test, but her results were allowed to stand. Semenya went on to carry the South African flag at the opening of the 2012 Olympics, and won a silver medal in the event.\n\nLet’s hope that Caitlyn Jenner’s public transition will help future transgenders and intersexuals in being accepted as regular competitors."
