That is, after all, the point of these things - it's fun to argue about. So that's exactly what we'll do today. Emily Kaplan and Kevin Clark join guest host Jeremy Schaap to examine why the players missing from the list may be more telling than those actually on it (no Brianna Stewart?!), why the term GOAT may be losing its meaning, and why Serena Williams, Tiger Woods, Lionel Messi, Tom Brady and beyond are all more deserving of the top slot than Michael Phelps.\n\nJuly 17: The Girl Who Fell Two Miles and Survived\n\nTen years ago, during a skydiving accident, Emma Carey and her instructor plummeted some 14,000 feet into an empty cow pasture in Switzerland. Miraculously, both survived the more than two-mile fall. Our own Ryan Hockensmith had the chance to speak with Emma about that experience. And to find out how she overcame the nightmare, processed her recovery, came to terms with the miracle and used her story to inspire others, without letting it define her.\n\nJuly 16: Taking MLBs Temperature at the All-Star Break\n\nThe Midsummer Classic is upon us once again. And once again, there are more questions than answers in Major League Baseball. What will the Pirates do with Paul Skenes, their rookie phenom? How can we get players interested in the All-Star Game again? How should we honor the late legend Willie Mays? And with a couple weeks left until the trade deadline, what should the powerhouse teams on both coasts do to make sure they are more than ready for October baseball? Today, Buster Olney sits side-by-side with Clinton Yates in Texas to answer all these questions and more on the eve of the 2024 MLB All-Star Game.\n\nJuly 15: Athletes Grant Childrens Wishes with ESPNs My Wish\n\nThere is no greater pain than seeing a child suffer through an illness. But also, there is no greater joy than seeing that child smile.That full spectrum of emotions is at the heart of ESPNs annual My Wish series that debuts this week. An elite slate of athletes will meet with several children to bond over their shared love of the game and a belief that hope, passion and a good team are the recipe for victory in whatever challenge they face. So today, our very own Chris Connelly reflects on the legacy of this program and shares what his experience has been like having a front-row seat to every My Wish ever granted.\n\nJuly 12: Continental Championships and the USMNT Looks For a New Coach\n\nPlayers scrapping with fans in the stands, continental championships up for grabs on both sides of the pond, and US Men's Soccer is once again searching for a new manager. There's a ton going on in the international soccer world, so today Luis Miguel Echegaray helps us break it all down, and lets us know who he thinks will capture the crown in Europe and the Americas.\n\nJuly 11: Why the Championship Celtics Are For Sale\n\nAfter 22 years, Wyc Grousbeck and his family announced they'll be selling their controlling stake in the Boston Celtics. The announcement marks a seismic moment not just for the Celtics, but for the NBA. Our own Tim Bontemps is here to talk about how the sale of one of the most iconic franchises in the world connects to greater trends in sports team ownership worldwide, and to explain who or what entity could be Jayson Tatum and Jalen Brown's new boss.\n\nJuly 10: How EA Sports Brought Back College Football\n\nGamers of a certain age have fond memories of building dynasties with their favorite schools in the NCAA College Football video game series. But - because of a lawsuit filed by former UCLA Bruin Ed O'Bannon over name, image, and likeness violations - it's been more than a decade since EA Sports released the game. That wait is almost over, as the game returns next week. Today, ESPN staff writer, Michael Rothstein, who broke the news of the games return in 2021, and has been covering the journey ever since, explains why college sports video games were shelved, and tells us just how EA Sports worked to return gamers holy grail.\n\nJuly 9: Why Klay Thompson's Exit Spells the End of the Warriors Dynasty\n\nAfter 13 seasons as a splash brother with the Warriors, Klay Thompson is trading in the boats in the Bay for cowboy boots in Dallas, Texas. And it feels like the end of the most recent dynasty in the NBA. But how exactly did it all come to an end? Today, ESPN senior NBA writer Ramona Shelburne explains what forced Klays hand, and details how he ended up choosing to moor his boat to the Mavericks.\n\nJuly 8: How the NBAs Contenders Look to Be Not Like The Rest\n\nThe NBA has been busy since the Celtics locked down their 18th championship. In Los Angeles, JJ Redick has traded in his microphone for a clipboard, becoming the new coach of the Lakers. And one of the first moves on his watch? Drafting Bronny James, fulfilling a father and son moment that the world has been waiting on. Meanwhile, Paul George says goodbye to the Clippers and heads over to Philly, while DeMar Derozan pulls back up to the west coast, heading from Chicago to Sacramento. So today we talk with ESPN NBA writer Tim Bontemps about which teams look like chevy hitters. And explore which moves could lead to the beginning of the next NBA dynasty.\n\nJuly 3: Is the Godfather of Competitive Eating Ready to Reclaim his Title?\n\nLast month, we learned that the rivalry between legendary competitive eaters, Japan's Takeru Kobayashi and America's Joey Chestnut, would be renewed this Labor Day. It will be their first head-to-head, hot-dog-eating-showdown in 14 years. A dispute with the organizers of Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating contest, a July 4th tradition, had forced Kobayashi out of the competition in 2010. A similar dispute this year for Chestnut set the stage for a long awaited rematch between two men who had accounted for 22 of the last 23 Nathan's Famous titles. So today, we bring you an interview with Takeru Kobayashi himself, exploring what drove him to rethink and revolutionize the sport of eating in the early 2000s, why his rivalry with Chestnut wasn't as fun as it looked, the false reports of his retirement, and what we should expect to see when these two finally meet again on Labor Day.\n\nJuly 2: Jeff Passan takes the temperature of MLB\n\nNow that we are heading to the midpoint of the 2024 MLB season, it's time to take the temperature of the league. Can the surprising Cleveland Guardians stay hot and catch pennant fever? Will the Orioles arms stay healthy enough to take down the Yankees? Are the Phillies and Dodgers simply inevitable in the National League? Or will Grimace continue to hold court in Queens and somehow bring the Mets to the table? To get the answers to all this and more we once again turn to our friend ESPN MLB insider Jeff Passan as he breaks down what stood out to him over the first few months and tells us how things might shape up down the stretch.\n\nJuly 1: Luis Miguel Echegaray Breaks Down Global Soccer Madness\n\nThere are two absolutely gigantic continental soccer tournaments happening side by side across the globe. In the western hemisphere Copa America features the United States, the Caribbean, and the best of South America on the pitch. Giving Uruguay a spotlight to shine. While across the pond the UEFA European Championship, better known as the Euros, are giving us all of the traditional national rivalries we are used to seeing. Of course, it wouldn't be soccer on a global stage, if the USMNT didn't have some sort of controversy going on, and following their upsetting loss to Panama last week, the questions about Gregg Berhalters fitness to lead the team are starting to swirl. So today, Luis Miguel Echegaray is here to: Get us set for tonight's U.S. vs Uruguay match up, breakdown everything he's been seeing in both tournaments, and to let us know who he likes to take home championships on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nJune 28: Will Connor McGregor Ever Return to the Octagon\n\nIt's a big week for the UFC. Out in Vegas, the premier combat sports company is celebrating International Fight Week, and on Thursday night, inducted its latest class to the Hall of Fame. Saturday night, the festivities culminate in UFC 303. But the sport's biggest star, Conor McGregor, won't be there, after pulling out of the main event due to injury, and forcing UFC to scramble and find other fighters to carry the card. So today, our Andreas Hale explains why McGregors three year absence has proven detrimental for him on all fronts, and why another delayed return has everyone wondering if Mr. Notorious will ever step into the Octagon again.\n\nJune 27: Is Sha'Carri Richardson Finally Ready for Her Olympic Moment?\n\nThree years ago, a positive marijuana test forced Sha'Carri Richardson off of team USA, robbing her and her country of a chance at an all-time Olympic moment. But in the years since, with a style reminiscent of the great Florence Griffith Joyner, Richardson has more than made her mark on the sport. So with 100-meter qualifications complete and the 200-meter on the horizon this weekend, our Coley Harvey explains how Richardson bounced back and why the Summer Games could make her one of the biggest stars on the planet.\n\nJune 26: A Fond Farewell to the Say Hey Kid\n\nFrom his time in Negro Leagues as a teenager to his epic run of success with the Giants, Willie Mays was always student and ambassador of Americas Pasttime Mays performance on the field has him in the conversation as one of the best players ever. 24 All Star Games, 12 Gold Gloves, two MVP awards, and 660 homers leave him in the most rare of air. In short, putting his legacy into words is almost impossible, so we let his actions tell his story. And the stories you will hear about Willie are that he was the one player from Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle to Reggie Jackson and Ken Griffey Jr. that left every major leaguer simply star struck by his otherworldly skills and his graceful presence.\n\nJune 25: What's Happening in the WNBA Besides Caitlin Clark vs Angel Reese?\n\nWith all of the air in the WNBA room being sucked up by loud takes on Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, and what their rivalry means to America, it's easy to forget that we're about a month and a half into the season. So today ESPN women's basketball writer Michael Voepel takes us around the league to fill us in on what we've been missing. Tonight's Commissioner Cup final between the New York Liberty and Minnesota Lynx is one of the stories that has gotten lost in the shuffle. Ironically, we haven't been talking much about what's happening on the court with the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky. And A'ja Wilson is doing it again, looking like a pretty solid bet to take home her third MVP award.\n\nJune 24: Will the Oilers Finally Bring the Stanley Cup Back to Canada\n\nBy the end of tonight, the world will know if the Edmonton Oilers will be the first Canadian team to hoist the Stanley Cup in more than three decades. Despite an initial 3-0 lead by the Florida Panthers, the Oilers have pushed forward and forced a Game 7. Our own Emily Kaplan is here to tell us how both these teams got to the finals, why key players like Connor McDavid and Stuart Skinner have been crucial to the Oilers comeback, and what tonight's outcome could mean for all of hockey.\n\nJune 21: Which Gymnasts Will Make Team USA?\n\nThe 2024 Olympics are almost upon us. Trials are taking place around the world to determine who will represent their countries in Paris. And next week, all eyes will be on USA gymnastics trials in Minneapolis as 16 women compete for one of five coveted spots on Team USA. Olympic superstar gymnast Simone Biles is looking to make it to her 3rd Olympics, but alongside her are 15 other women with just as much a shot to make the team as her. So today, our Olympics expert DArcy Maine joins us to break down how we got to trials and why this Olympic team might be the hardest to make in the history of the sport.\n\nJune 20: Is the USMNT Ready to Compete with the World's Best?\n\nThe Copa América is South America's fiercely competitive international soccer tournament, historically dominated by Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. But this summer, the games are happening in the United States, and the Americans have been invited to compete along with other North and Central American teams. So, as this unprecedented tournament gets underway Thursday night, our soccer savant Luis Miguel Echegary explains how it all landed in the states to begin with, why it will be a major measuring stick for the American squad, and whether Argentina's Lionel Messi has anything left to prove.\n\nJune 19: Roy Wood Jr. on Rickwood Field and Growing up a Black Baseball Fan\n\nThe St. The Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants will meet in a special ballgame at Birmingham, Alabama's historic Rickwood Field tomorrow. That ballpark is 114 years old, the oldest professional field in America, and was the home to two teams named The Barons: one black and one white. And what happened on that field: a community gathering to cheer both squads, and the nation's first integrated baseball game was a reflection of what happened in the city during the Civil Rights struggle. Today we are joined by Roy Wood Jr. Comedian, Daily Show veteran, baseball fan - who grew up in the shadow of Rickwood Field. He explains: what the city was like during his life, how ready Birmingham is for its spotlight, and how the lessons he learned on the diamond still carry weight in his life today.\n\nJune 18: How Kyle Larson Took on the Memorial Day Double\n\nThe Indianapolis 500 is a sacred tradition in the racing community. But so is the Coca Cola 600, NASCARs longest race. And both of these events just happen to fall on the same day. So when a brave driver decides to tackle all 1100 of these miles, a challenge affectionately known as the Memorial Day Double, the eyes of the race world fall on them. This year, NASCAR champion and IndyCar rookie of the year Kyle Larson took his shot, battling: the logistics; the tracks; and, most of all, Mother Nature. And our good friend Ryan McGee was there to chronicle the attempt. So today, McGee shares the history of folks trying to tackle The Double, and explains how the people who dare to get behind the wheel are built differently from the rest of us.\n\nJune 17: How Jerry West Dedicated His Life to Basketball\n\nIt's difficult to identify a true contemporary to Jerry West. He's the man who spent 14 consecutive years as an All Star for the Los Angeles Lakers. The guy who helped engineer and sustain not one, but two dynasties with the team. A figure whose silhouette literally loomed above the league as the NBAs logo. So when the news broke last week of his death, at the age of 86, it marked the passing of a giant. Today, Jeremy Schaap memorializes the great Laker. He explains West's West Virginia origins, explores his life and legacy with the Lakers and across the NBA, and tells us how, in spite of all of his great accomplishments, the harshest critic of Jerry West was always Jerry West.\n\nJune 14: Why the Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Feels Different in 2024\n\nYankees vs. Red Sox. It's one of the fiercest rivalries in all of sports and includes names like: Derek Jeter, Pedro Martinez, David Ortiz, Bucky Dent, and of course Babe Ruth. But these days Major League Baseball has become so obsessed with data, that it feels like the human element can fall by the wayside. So, ahead of their three game weekend series, culminating with a matchup on Sunday Night Baseball, Jeff Passan joins the show to explain just what this rivalry is like in 2024. And to tell us why things have been uncharacteristically quiet these days in Fenway Park.\n\nJune 13: The WNBAs Identity Debate Began Long Before Caitlin Clark\n\nThe first month of the WNBA season has been full of compelling on-court storylines. The Connecticut Sun looks ready to contend for a title. The defending champion Las Vegas Aces have struggled to find their footing with veteran Chelsea Gray injured. But all of that is getting crowded out by one big distraction: a debate over whether or not the league is being fair to its rookie megastar, Cailtin Clark. Chennedy Carter's hard foul on Clark is the match that lit the flame, but the firestorm had been brewing long before that. So today, Elle Duncan, host of ESPNs women's basketball coverage, is here to help understand how we got here, unpack what's really going on in this conversation, and gauge if and when we can get back to actual basketball. Check out The Elle Duncan Show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or YouTube.\n\nJune 12: Can Anything Keep the Celtics from Raising Banner 18?\n\nTwo games into the NBA Finals, and it looks like nothing can keep the Boston Celtics away from lifting an 18th championship banner to the rafters. They've been able to limit the Dallas attack to just Luka Doncic, and everything seems to be going their way. ESPN NBA reporter Tim Bontemps has been at both games of the series, and he joins the show to explain just how Boston is keeping the Dallas attack in check. And explore if a shift in venue to the Lone Star state will be enough to give the Mavs a fighting chance.\n\nJune 11: America Shocks the World In Cricket?!\n\nFor Americans who've never watched a cricket match before, now may be the best time to start. Because for the first time ever, Team USA has drawn global attention, after shocking the world in an upset over Pakistan last Thursday. And that feat looks all the more improbable when you learn who exactly is on this roster. So today, ESPNs own Aishwarya Kumar explains how they pulled it off, and why this Men's T20 World Cup tournament looks like a watershed moment for American cricket. You can stream Team USAs Wednesday and Friday matches against India and Ireland at 10:30 AM Eastern Time.\n\nJune 10: How Maya Brady Carried the Family Name into the Next Generation\n\nWith all of the energy surrounding women's basketball these days, it can be easy to lose sight of the fact that the interest in women's sports is growing beyond just the hardwood. We've seen a professional women's hockey league return to the ice this season, stars continue to shine on the tennis courts and the track. And interest in the Women's College World Series has steadily increased year over year leading to an average of two million fans tuning in to the most watched title series ever. So today, Jake Trotter, who covers college sports at ESPN, introduces us to Maya Brady, a prolific shortstop at UCLA, who just completed a decorated college career on the softball field. And Jake tells us why Maya's rise is about more than just her shared family lineage with her uncle, one Tom Brady.\n\nJune 7: Who Will Get Over the Hump? Emily Kaplan Previews the Stanley Cup Final\n\nThe teams meeting in the Stanley Cup Final this season, the Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers, are both trying to get over the hump. For the Panthers, this is year three in their recent turnaround. Having the best record in the NHL two seasons ago didn't get it done, and last year they fell a step short of lifting Lord Stanley's trophy into the air for the first time as a franchise. Up in Edmonton, the Oilers have not won it all since 1990, when a guy named Wayne Gretzky was still lacing them up. And after falling short in the playoffs themselves over the past few seasons, they are looking to bring home the cup not just for their city, but for the entirety of the nation. So today, ESPN NHL reporter Emily Kaplan tells us what to watch for ahead of Saturday's game one.\n\nJune 6: How a City Sponsorship Could Signal Change in the WNBA\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock the WNBA continues to be a hot topic, showing fans and the world that excitement around women's basketball is expanding beyond a moment. With all the chatter about aggression towards rookies, vet players, crazy record stats, and even team mascots dominating the floor, there is one thing that has been looming top of mind for many over the last few weeks: money. The two-time reigning WNBA champion Las Vegas Aces are again at the forefront, as all twelve of the players on the team are negotiating with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA) on a $100,000 sponsorship deal. A number even higher than the league salary minimum. The news came as a welcome surprise to many, but also sparked an investigation from the league. So today Aces beat reporter, Callie Lawson-Freeman of the Las Vegas Review-Journal is here to share what she has been able to find out on the ground about this sponsorship and what it could mean for the league.\n\nJune 5: Brian Windhorst Previews a Fascinating NBA Finals Matchup\n\nThis year's NBA finals feature one team everyone saw coming and, according to Brian Windhorst, another we probably should have seen coming. The Boston Celtics have been on a hot streak all season long, easily claiming the league's best record while the Dallas Mavericks have been pushing their way towards the mountaintop week by week. Game 1 of the NBA Finals tips off Thursday night and there's so much to think about, including how Dallas might actually have the two best players on the court, whether or not Kyrie Irving can shake his Celtics curse, and why it's win now or maybe never for this iteration of the Celtics. Brian Windhorst has been in the building with both teams as they've made their run through the playoffs and joins us to share what we can expect as the Finals begin.\n\nJune 4: What the Negro Leagues' Statistical Integration Really Means\n\nFor years, names like Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, and Satchel Paige were well known as legends in the Negro Leagues, but unrecognized in the record books alongside their white contemporaries. Last week that changed, as a nearly quarter-century long endeavor to collect and verify decades of statistics was unveiled for the first time. The news seems to have been met with every emotion under the sun: confusion, anger, disdain, but not joy. And part of that is because many are confused as to what's actually happening. This story was never about Josh Gibson unseating Ty Cobb as the single season batting average leader. It was about presenting the statistics of major professional baseball leagues as evidence to support the legends that played. So Today, our host Clinton Yates sits on the other side of the table and joins our very own Alex Hyacinthe to break down what this process undertook, and what this really means for baseball.\n\nJune 3: One Pitcher May Have Secretly Changed the Balance of Power in MLB\n\nMajor League Baseball teams have developed a habit of manipulating contract rules so as to prevent a player from realizing his true financial value. Many contend it's all part of a player exploitation system perpetrated by the league under the guise of maximizing efficiency. But five years ago, while pitching for the Brewers, reliever Josh Hader and his agent employed an unprecedented strategy to fight back. Today, Buster Olney joins us as we explore Haders story, the greater context of how MLB uses and abuses pitchers, and the impact this new tactic could have not only on their contracts, but also their long-term health.\n\nMay 31: Will a Shuttered School Win a College World Series Title?\n\nBirmingham Southern College sits on a lovely campus three miles from downtown Birmingham, Alabama. But today, that college is officially ceasing operations. Nonetheless, the school's baseball team will play on, as they take the field this afternoon in the Division III college world series. So our Kyle Bonagura is here to explain how the school's looming closure actually inspired the Panthers to turn their season around. And how the team's final run may turn out to be its best ever.\n\nMay 30: Is Bronny James Good Enough for the NBA?\n\nBronny James has been in the public spotlight his whole life. Being the son of all-time great LeBron James has set expectations that would be too high for most NBA Draft prospects, let alone one with a less-than-guaranteed shot in the NBA. Bronny James wont be a lottery pick, and probably won't be picked in the first round either. What makes this more complicated than your average draft prospect analysis is LeBron has the opportunity to opt out of his contract and become a free agent this summer, and has stated publicly that he would like to play with his son. So today, ESPNs resident NBA Front Office expert Bobby Marks joins the show to break down Bronnys value as a player, and how his father plays a part in where and when Bronny gets drafted.\n\nMay 29: Inside the Mind of Bill Walton\n\nOn Memorial Day the world lost one of the gems of the sports world, the one and only Bill Walton. He was a two-time NBA champion and won two NCAA titles as a young man at UCLA. But his reputation as the most cheerful, colorful, and contemplative personality in sports, especially in his many decades as a broadcaster, has extended his legacy beyond the generations who first watched him on the court. In tribute to Walton, today we revisit our January 2021 conversation with the man himself, and revel in the joy he brought into our lives.\n\nMay 28: Has Shohei Ohtani Pitched His Last Game?\n\nOver the previous six seasons, Shohei Ohtani's prowess as a hitter and a pitcher made him the most talked about player in baseball. But when the Dodgers signed him to a record-setting $700 million contract in December, they knew an elbow injury would prevent him from pitching in 2024. Now, after 53 games this season, we are seeing Ohtani reach new heights at the plate. Which begs the question: Do he and the Dodgers really want to mess with that? Today, our Bradford Doolittle explains why, like Babe Ruth before him, Ohtani's bat skills may keep him off the mound forever.\n\nMay 24: One Racial Slur Tore a Baseball Team Apart\n\nOn April 6th, 2023, a startling scene played out on a baseball field in Fort Myers, Florida. Shortly after the start of the annual rivalry game against nearby Estero High School, nearly the entire roster for Fort Myers High School, along with the coaching staff, walked off the field, leaving two teammates of color behind. According to witnesses on the scene, chaos ensued, as parents on both sides of the divide began trading insults. That incident was the latest manifestation of racial tensions that have existed in Fort Myers for decades. And the direct result of an assistant coach being dismissed for using a racial slur in a team group chat on Valentines Day of that year. Today, our Howard Bryant takes us inside this story, unpacks a chain of smoldering racial resentments, and provides a new understanding of what it means to be outnumbered.\n\nMay 23: How Men, Moonshine, and the Need for Speed Birthed NASCAR\n\nWe know that the roots of NASCAR can be traced back to the American South in states like North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee. But what you might not realize is that particular motorsport was conceived through the hills of those very same states by bootleggers running moonshine while racing for bragging rights.

Waiting in the wings are Slovenia's Luka Doncic and Canada's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. But this worldwide explosion of talent did not happen overnight. Like any other explosion, it starts with a single spark. In Europe that spark was named Radivoj Korac. Korac played for the Yugoslavian national basketball team in the 1950s and 60s, and quickly gained acclaim after winning The Best Athlete of Yugoslavia (Zlatna znacka), and Yugoslav Sportsman of the Year (Sportske novosti award). He laid the path for future European superstars to follow in the years to come. Sadly, Korac never got to see his true peak or join the NBA after passing away in a tragic car accident at the age of 30.

It's undoubtedly a great business decision for both Nike and Clark as she transitions into becoming the most hyped WNBA rookie of all time, but the announcement begets a conversation about equity in the WNBA.

This winter, with the Coyotes in the midst of a second season in a college hockey barn, the NHL finally had enough. Enter Ryan Smith, owner of the NBA's Utah Jazz. In an abnormal arrangement, Smith is taking over ownership and moving the team to Utah. But they won't be called the Coyotes. Control of that brand, as well as its logos, records, and history remains in the hands of former owner Alex Meruelo, who intends to restore the Arizona club in the coming years.

They have all been considered the King of New York at some point in time. And now it appears the time has come to place the crown atop the head of Jalen Brunson. But what kind of king would Brunson be? And where does this idea come from in the first place? There's no king of Baltimore, or Tulsa, so why does this title exist for that city? Andscape's Justin Tinsley has explored this concept in his book It Was All a Dream: Biggie and the World That Made Him. So today he explains it all, and tells us why Brunson is perfectly suited to rule the five boroughs right now.\n\nMay 3: How Bryce Harper Taught Philadelphia to Love Again\n\nPhillies star Bryce Harper has always been about blue collar hard work - and the spotlight.

And in a town notorious for wearing their hearts - and hate - on their sleeve, Harper has become one with the City of Brotherly Love. Today, ahead of the Phillies' Sunday Night Baseball matchup with the Giants, ESPN's Jesse Rogers joins us to break down how this all happened and why the Harper Effect isn't going anywhere.\n\nMay 2: How Reggie Bush's Heisman Reveals New Landscape of NIL, NCAA\n\nThe world watched as Reggie Bush's Heisman Trophy was revoked in 2010 after an NCAA investigation that uncovered improper gifts to Bush.

The 71 year old has been a scrappy utility player, a pennant winning manager, and a coach with a knack for unlocking his players full potential. But there have also been downs in Washington's career: a failed drug test, an extramarital affair, and a decade of thinking he would never manage again.

And explains why this current job could be his greatest achievement yet.\n\nApr. 23: Why does everyone hate Rudy Gobert?\n\nNo one was surprised to learn that Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert experienced the same darkness retreat that Jets QB Aaron Rodgers made famous, or maybe infamous. And no one was surprised that the reaction was just as polarizing for Gobert, as it was for Rodgers. But what is it about the Timberwolves center that makes the Frenchman so dislikable to his peers? What exactly is it about his specific je ne sais quoi that has the man who's won three Defensive Player of the Years awards, and a bank account to match, viewed as such a problem?

The team holding that pick is the Chicago Bears, who are well known for their inability to draft and develop quarterbacks to their potential. A couple of times throughout history, top prospects have used their leverage to force their ways out of unfavorable landing spots. The stories of John Elway, Bo Jackson, and most recently Eli Manning all come to mind. Even though Caleb Williams does not look to be joining their ranks, there is still a conversation to be had about how these \"can't miss' players can and have used their standing to buck the system and how NIL adds new leverage to that dynamic.

An ugly echo of America's unjust past and a crime leveled not just at the man who broke Major League's color barrier in 1947 but also at an urban community within the city. But as Bob Lutz, the founder of League 42, a youth organization geared towards exposing the city's black and brown youth to baseball and more, learned, Jackie Robinson was more of an accidental victim than a target.

So today, SportsCenter anchor and lifelong Kentucky fan Michael Eaves gives us the view inside the Big Blue fanbase and explains why picking the next head coach is an unenviable challenge.\n\nApr. 10: America's Caddie Untangles the Golf World at the Masters\n\nOn the eve of the Masters, it's no secret that the world of men's professional golf is currently in chaos.

It all comes to a head in Saturday's Final Four as DJ Burns and NC State face Zach Edey and Purdue, followed by Mark Sears and Alabama taking on Donovan Clingan and Connecticut.

Tim Keown spent time watching the Dodgers' newest star up close and personal recently, and he explains to us how Ohtani's newfound isolation might actually be the key to him opening up to the Dodgers, and maybe eventually the rest of us all.\n\nApr. 1: Is a Major Sports Betting Scandal Inevitable?\n\nHe may have been the biggest such star to become entangled in a gambling drama, but Dodgers' star Shohei Ohtani was not the first. Days after the scandal surrounding the global baseball star's interpreter came to light, a different set of suspicious bets emerged.

As more and more states have legalized sports betting, we've seen more and more athletes, many of them lesser known players, drawing headlines for potential betting violations.

So Mina Kimes drops by to take us inside the matchups.\n\nJan. 10: How Joe Flacco Went from Stay-at-Home Dad to Playoff Bound QB\n\nThis NFL season, we saw an alarming number of teams unravel after losing starting quarterbacks to injury, including the Jets (Aaron Rodgers), the Bengals (Joe Burrow), and the Vikings (Kirk Cousins), just to name a few. But week after week, Joe Flacco, the Super Bowl winning 38-year old veteran, remained stuck at home without a place to play. Mystified by the league-wide snub, Flacco held out hope. So, with help from the best NFL-wideout-impersonation his dad could muster, and the good fortune of an unlocked pee wee field near his home, Flacco kept his arm fresh and his body ready. And by mid-November he was rewarded. The Browns had just lost Deshaun Watson to a shoulder fracture and wanted to give the former Baltimore Ravens star a workout. Now, more than seven weeks and five starts later, Joe Flacco is the hottest quarterback in the league, has led the Browns to the playoffs, and is setting records in the process. So today, our Browns reporter Jake Trotter takes us inside one of the NFL's great comeback stories, explaining why the Browns were excited from the moment their new QB showed up and why Flacco and this team are no fluke.\n\nJan. 9: What's Next for Bill Belichick?\n\nBill Belichick is thought of by many as the greatest coach in NFL history. His tenure as the head coach of the New England Patriots has produced nine AFC Championships, six Super Bowl rings, and put Belichick within striking distance of catching Don Shula for the most wins of any coach ever. But after two decades of dominance, and a little bit of controversy, the past few years have been anything but what we've come to expect from the Patriots. Instead of being \"onto Cincinnati,\" they've fallen onto hard times, ultimately ending up with their worst record since 1992, landing at 4-13. And so now, with the season now over, we wait for the answer to the question people have been asking since midway through the 2023 season. Will Bill Belichick be the Patriots coach come next season? Or is it time for his career to move to a new city? Would the grass be greener in Atlanta, or Washington, or Los Angeles? Field Yates, host of the Fantasy Focus podcast, joins the show to tell us how this all looks to a lifelong New Englander. And explore what comes next for both Belichick and the Patriots.\n\nJan 8: CFP National Championship - Two Legacies at Stake\n\nWhen Michigan and Washington meet tonight in the College Football Playoff National Championship, there's more at stake than who can claim the top spot in the 2023 college football season. That's because Michigan head coach, Jim Harbaugh, has accomplished nearly everything a high level coach can. He's taken the 49ers to the Super Bowl, and appeared in the College Football Playoff multiple years in a row with the Wolverines. And Washington quarterback Michael Penix Jr., has gone from overperforming in Indiana, to becoming Heisman runner-up with the Huskies. Setting his sights on the first round of the NFL draft in the process. But neither has done one thing...win a championship. So today, Kyle Bonagura reports on what he's learned about both men, and how their paths led them to this moment, a national title matchup, tonight on ESPN.\n\nJan. 5: Can Ja Morant Reclaim his Megastar Status?\n\nLast month Ja Morant returned to his Memphis Grizzlies after a 25-game suspension for repeated gun related incidents and accusations.
