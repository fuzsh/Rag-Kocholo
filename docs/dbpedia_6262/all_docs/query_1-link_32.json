As some athletes had already gone home, Frantz Reichel presented their medals to other members of their teams.\n\nTrack at the Foot of the Glaciers\n\nThe bobsleigh competition was held on the Pélerins track, named after the glacier which dominates it. The equipment was transported to the top of the track using the old cable car of the Aiguille du Midi.\n\nEquipment on Shoulders\n\nFor the parade of the delegations during the Opening Ceremony, many athletes marched with their equipment on their shoulder (skis, hockey sticks, etc.). Indeed, according to the rules in place at the time, the athletes had to march in sportswear, and the skis or hockey sticks were part of their equipment. Today, the delegations no longer wear their sportswear, but they try to outdo each other in terms of imagination to appear in all their finery.\n\nLast, but at Least Ranked\n\nIn cross country skiing, in the 50km event, held in a violent and icy cold wind, the last ranked competitor finished 2h 30m after Norway’s Thorleif Haug, who won the event in 3h 44m.\n\nCeremonies\n\n25 January 1924, Chamonix. Delegations in the Olympic Stadium.\n\nOfficial Opening of the Games by:\n\nUnder Secretary for Physical Education, Gaston Vidal\n\nLighting the Olympic Flame by:\n\nA symbolic fire at an Olympic Winter Games was first lit in 1936 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.\n\nOlympic Oath by:\n\nCamille Mandrillon (military patrol)\n\nOfficials' Oath by:\n\nThe officials' oath at an Olympic Winter Games was first sworn in 1972 at Sapporo."
