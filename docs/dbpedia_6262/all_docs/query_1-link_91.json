        "text": "TOKYO -- The Springsteen family has gone platinum many times over. Time to make space for a little silver too.\n\nJessica Springsteen and the U.S. equestrian jumping team came up just short of Olympic gold, falling to Sweden in a jump-off Saturday night that still left the Americans with a record 10th medal in the event.\n\n\"I had really high hopes coming in today,\" Springsteen said. \"It really gave me a lot of confidence and the ability to have big dreams of riding with them, so I'm just so excited.\"\n\nIt's a first medal for 29-year-old Springsteen, daughter of famed rockers Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, who made her Olympic debut in Tokyo. Riding powerful stallion Don Juan van de Donkhoeve, she clipped one rail in the primary round Saturday, as did McLain Ward, leaving the U.S in a tie with the Swedes for first with eight penalty points.\n\n\"I was happy we were able to pull it together and fight for the rest of the course,\" Springsteen said.\n\nSpringsteen, Laura Kraut and Ward each moved cleanly through the shortened jump-off course in a combined time of 124.2 seconds.\n\nPeder Fredricson, the final Swedish rider, needed to circle the track in 40.30 seconds or better without error and cruised to a time of 39.01 for the country's record fourth gold medal but first since 1924. The Americans also entered this week with three golds.\n\nFrance had a clear line to a second straight gold when its final rider, Pénélope Leprevost, took the course. Needing to finish with fewer than five points to win without a jump-off, Leprevost's horse refused twice, disqualifying her and the French team.\n\nThat left the Americans and Swedes tied for the lead and necessitated the jump-off.\n\nIt's the second straight silver for the U.S. team, which won its last gold in 2008, also with Kraut and Ward on the team.\n\nSpringsteen said after Friday's qualifying round that her parents have been watching from home, as athletes weren't allowed to bring family to Japan amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe said she was inspired to begin riding after watching her mother take lessons and began her training on the family's farm in Colts Neck, New Jersey.\n\nSwedish riders Henrik von Eckermann and Malin Baryard-Johnsson joined Fredricson in earning the gold medal."
