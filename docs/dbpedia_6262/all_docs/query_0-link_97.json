Bobby Lackey is the starting quarterback, but Vince Matthews plays a critical role in winning this game.\n\nFullback Don Allen is the first person in College sport's history to convert a Two-Point conversion after a touchdown. Texas beat O.U. 15-14.\n\nIn `58, Texas fought back for a 15-14 victory on Bobby Lackey`s jump pass to Bobby Bryant for a late touchdown. That began an eight-game UT winning streak. The first six came against Wilkinson, who resigned after the `63 season, and the next two against Gomer Jones, promoted from line coach when Wilkinson left.\n\n''When we came to Dallas in `58, I had no hunch that we would win,''\n\nRoyal said. ''I just knew we would play hard. We started our winning drive with a few minutes left, and Vince Matthews (a seldom-used passing\n\nquarterback) became a hero for taking us down the field. Then we got inside the 10 and didn`t move for a couple of plays. Oklahoma was playing a gap-eight defense, and I was scared when I subbed Lackey (the starter) back in at quarterback that they would change it. I knew the jump pass was a good call if they stayed in a gap-eight, and fortunately they did.''\n\nRoyal shrugged off rave reviews for a great split-second coaching decision after switching to Lackey for the winning score.\n\n1958 Texas-OU: \"Turning It Into a Bloodletting Again.\"\n\nBy Stephen Ross Oct 6, 2008, 9:15pm CDT\n\nIt's Texas-OU Week. To fully understand the passion this brings to both sides, you have to understand the history involved. I thought I would put up a few posts on what are for me, some of the most significant games of this rivalry.\n\nBegining with the game that happened 50 years ago. Texas had a great run in the late 40's, as TaylorTRoom pointed out thanks mainly to the incomparble Bobby Layne.\n\nTexas never lost to OU or A&M during Layne's four years on campus. The Sooners hired Jim Tatum to change that in 1946. Oklahoma went 8-3 in his one and only season in Norman, including a 20-13 loss to Texas. The 8 wins was the 2nd most total in a season for the Sooners in 30 years, but when OU wouldn't give him a long term contract, he bolted for Maryland. His top assistant, Charles \"Bud\" Wilkinson, was given the job. OU promptly turned the series around, and the Sooners won in 1948 and 1949 by the identical score of 20-14, with Darrell Royal at quarterback.\n\nDarrell Royal was 2-2 as a player in the Texas-OU series.\n\nWilkinson went on to win 8 out of 9 against Texas, running Ed Price out of town with back-to-back shutouts in 1955-56. When D.X. Bible went looking for a replacement, he tried to get Bobby Dodd from Georgia Tech. Dodd was interested, but when the talks became public, he backed out. He did mention a young coach who had just finished his first year at Washington for the job.\n\nWhy would Bible choose a 32-year old with a 17-13 record as a head coach to take over the Texas program? He thought some young blood was needed, and he wanted to find a coach who could become Athletics Director in time as well. Some of the brightest minds in the game recommended Royal, and Bible was sure that Royal fully understood the depth of passion of the Texas-OU rivalry. Royal, out of Hollis, OK, had entered the Army Air Force in WWII. When he was discharged, he asked a friend who had played freshman ball at Texas to write a letter of recommendation for him to Texas. Nothing came of it, so Royal went home to OU and became an All-American for Wilkinson.\n\nRoyal came by his penchant for coaching defense and special teams play naturally. He returned two punts of 73 and 95 yards for touchdowns in 1948, and he still holds the OU career record for interceptions with 17.\n\nWhile Royal recogized that the Texas job was a dream come true for him, he also knew that it was open for a reason. The program had fallen into disarray, not just on the field. He also knew that his former coach had a monster program in Norman. OU was in the midst of a 47-game win streak. Between 1947-56, the Sooners were 83-8-3.\n\nComing into the 1958 game, Wilkinson and the Sooners had won 6 in a row over UT.\n\nRoyal immediately assured the fans that he knew what was his number one priority at Texas. \"We'll hit,\" Royal said. \"We'll find us some guys who want to dance every dance, and we'll turn that thing up in Dallas into a bloodletting again.\"\n\nWhen he got to Texas, Royal made some quick cosmetic changes, such as getting new turf on the practice and playing fields, and a secretary for himself and his assistants. He designed the T-Lounge, a combination snack bar-study lounge for current players, and a meeting place for alums on game day. He orderd brand new practice equipment, where most schools used old game jerseys.\n\nIn 1956 Texas had become the first state school to require entrance examinations for all freshmen. Royal became the first coach to hire a full-time academic counselor, whom Royal called a \"Brain Coach.\"\n\nRoyal oversaw every aspect of the program, from getting nicer hotels for away games, to what players could wear on the road. \"Things like that should never be an issue,\" Royal said. \"All of these things help sustain moral.\"\n\nRoyal's first team lost to OU in 1957 21-7.\n\nTexas opened the 1958 season hosting Georgia and it's new quarterback, Fran Tarkenton. The Horns led 7-0 when Tarkenton took the Bulldogs on a 95-yard scoring drive and then took advantage of a brand new rule, going for two after a touchdown. Tarkenton flipped a short pass for the conversion and an 8-7 lead. Texas came back to win 13-8, but after the game Royal again stated that he didn't like the new rule, saying that it \"let fans go to Vegas and play with somebody else's money,\" and it would be another reason for fans to second guess coaches.\n\nOU came into the 1958 contest with a chip on its shoulder, since the Sooners had started the year out #1, but were dropped to #2 behind Auburn after OU barely beat Oregon 6-0. Texas was also unbeaten going into the game (3-0), but the Horns were still two-touchdown underdogs. Royal hadn't gotten much out of his first recruiting class, and Texas relied on two juniors -- QB Bobby Lackey and HB Rene Ramirez for offensive fireworks.\n\nThe game started out as fierce defensive struggle. Royal had made good on his promise of turning the game back into a \"bloodletting\" at least as far as the hitting was concerned. Neither team made a first down for the first 10 minutes of the contest. Then early in the 2nd quarter, Texas drew first blood. On fourth and 4 from the OU ten yard line, the left-handed Ramirez took a pitch to the left, raised up and hit George Blanch for the touchdown.\n\nRene Ramirez, nicknamed the \"Galloping Gaucho\" gave Texas its first score on a trick play.\n\nRoyal then decided to use the new rule that he hated. Texas went for two.\n\nRoyal said he went for two after the first score because, \"it would totally catch them by surprise, and we didn't think one touchdown would hold up.\" After scoring on a trick play, Texas ran the most basic running play in the play book for the two-point conversion.\n\nRoyal reasoned that OU would expect some kind of razzle-dazzle, not just an up the middle handoff. He also worked his offense on this play over and over until they had such total confidence in it that they lined up and blew OU off the line for the conversion.\n\nFunny isn't it? How a coach with such a conservative reputation won so many crucial games with uncharacteristic calls. When folks expect you to keep the rent money in your pocket, rolling the dice is quite a shock.\n\nTexas went into halftime leading 8-0.\n\nOU dominated the 3rd quarter, and finally got on the scoreboard with 4 minutes left. The Sooners went for two, but it failed, and Texas led 8-6. After the kickoff, disaster struck for the Longhorns. Lackey\n\nmissed a handoff to Mike Dowdle, and the ball actually ended up on Dowdle's back, where OU's Jim Davis picked it up and moved 25 yards for the touchdown. This time the Sooners two-point conversion worked, and OU now led 14-8.\n\nIn the middle of the 4th quarter, Texas mounted a 13-play 74-yard drive that started with Royal sending Vince Matthews in at QB. Matthews, the better passer, quickly took the Horns down the field hitting 6 out of 7 passes, including a 4th down and 6 completion. The series ended when Bobby Lackey hit Bob Bryant with a jump pass (believe it or not Tim Tebow did not invent the jump pass), to tie the game. Lackey then kicked the go ahead extra point to give Texas the 15-14 lead. Lackey also ended up intercepting the final OU pass to give Texas the one point win and the first victory over the Sooners in 7 years. Lackey, Matthews and Ramirez combined to hit 12 out of 17 passes for 153 yards and both scores.\n\nRoyal had beaten his former coach on his second try. Texas fans tore down both goalposts. When OU President George Cross came to the UT locker room to congratulate Royal and the team he had to wait a minute. It seems Darrell had gone around outside the back to throw up.\n\nShort-term the loss didn't slow the Sooners down much as OU won out on the regular season, and thumped Syracuse 21-6 in the Orange Bowl to end up the season 10-1. Texas lost three of its last five games to finish 7-3 and rejected bowl feelers from the Gator Bowl.\n\nLong term, however, the win over the Sooners paid huge dividends. Texas also defeated A&M that year, making it the first time since Bobby Layne's senior year that Texas had beaten both OU and A&M the same season. The success of 1958 could not be underestimated in terms of helping recruiting as well. The 1959 recruiting class would supply 28 sophomores who would be listed among the top 44 players for the 1960 season. That sophomore class would go 26-5-2 on the varsity and set the table National Championship run of 1963.\n\nThe 1958 Texas win was the first of 6 in a row for Royal over his former Coach.\n\nIt was also the begining of the end for Royal's mentor. Going into 1958, Wilkinson was 9-2 against the Longhorns, but he would never win another contest in Dallas. Despite ending up with a 145-29-4 mark, with 13 conference and 3 national titles, Wilkinson was out of coaching at the age of 47. Before the 1963 season there were rumors of Wilkinson retiring to run for the U.S. Senate. As he suffered his 6th straight loss to his former player, one politico remarked, \"That's the shortest tenure in the Senate of anyone I know.\"\n\nBefore the game Royal said, \"The only way anybody's going to beat Oklahoma is to go out there and whimp 'em jaw to jaw. They get a yellow dog running downhill and they'll strap them pretty good. The thing\n\nI want to see is that they earn what they get with bumps and bruises...Texas has to develop a football tradition. It had one once, but lost it.\"\n\nThe joy of the 1958 win over OU reached all the way into 1959 when Lackey and the Horns graced the cover of SI.\n\nThis game was a major step in bring that tradition back.\n\n1959• No. 4 Texas 19, No. 13 Oklahoma 12\n\n1978• No. 1 Oklahoma 31, No. 6 Texas 10\n\nSooner Daryl Hunt against Texas had 18 tackles, one interception, and one sack in one game against the Horns. He set the Sooner career record with 506 tackles. Sooner Reggie Kinlaw\n\nBilly Sims of Hooks had 131 rushing yards for the Sooners en route to the 1978 Heisman Trophy.\n\nSooner Reggie Kinlaw caused a Longhorn fumble, and had 10 unassisted tackles and 5 assisted tackles in the Oklahoma win.\n\nOKLAHOMA FOOTBALL: A POWERHOUSE THAT BARRY BUILT\n\nCollege coach Barry Switzer is king in Oklahoma. Here’s a disturbing glimpse at how he has kept his team number one\n\nDECEMBER 51978 PHILIP TAUBMAN\n\nOklahoma’s varsity program is grossly out of control. It’s a story of football madness. The coach and team are running away with the university.\n\nOU’s winning tradition has always had certain trademarks. Powerful running. A tough defense. Consistent kicking. And the coaching staff cheats.\n\nThe Bud Wilkinson Complex is a great help in signing high school players. Oklahoma isn’t selling education. It’s selling football, pure and simple.\n\nWhether winning or sinning, Barry Switzer is the talk and toast of Oklahoma. The coach’s reputation as a ladies’ man fuels all kinds of rumors.\n\nCollege coach Barry Switzer is king in Oklahoma. Here’s a disturbing glimpse at how he has kept his team number one\n\nPhilip Taubman\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein never envisaged an Oklahoma like this. Down I-35 we come, barreling south from Oklahoma City like a runaway express train. A state police car leads the way, lights flashing and siren wailing. I’m tucked in behind the car in a Hertz Oldsmobile, followed closely by two silver-and-white buses rolling along at seventy miles per hour. It looks like the President of the United States is on the move. Actually, it is the University of Oklahoma football team. After spending Friday night in a hotel away from the distractions of the campus, in Norman, Oklahoma, the team is heading home to play Kansas State.\n\nThe highway ahead narrows to two lanes, both jammed with game traffic. There appears to be no way through the congestion. The state trooper doesn’t agree: In a maneuver that would cost anyone else his license, the lawman brakes momentarily, then cuts between the lanes of traffic. Startled drivers on either side veer to the shoulder as our caravan wedges past. It is like the Red Sea parting for Moses. Just at this moment, the trunk of my car pops open. My view to the rear is blocked, and the clothes and papers I tossed in the trunk are surely flying all over the road. A hell of a way to drive in a motorcade. I wave plaintively to the trooper. He takes one look at my problem and signals back a message that roughly translates, “You must be crazy, buddy, if you think the Oklahoma football team is stopping so you can rescue your laundry.”\n\nAfter a week in Oklahoma, I should have known better than to ask. The University of Oklahoma (OU) Sooners do not yield to anyone. It is no accident that they travel to games like royalty— in Oklahoma, they are. The state is infatuated with football, and Oklahomans spare nothing for their team. They want glory and will pay any price. They lavish the Sooners with attention, money, and facilities that would make a pro team weep with envy. They brook no criticism and treat anyone who questions the OU football program as a traitor. Most of all, the folks of Oklahoma revel in the success of the Sooners. The team puts the state on the map every autumn. It generates pride and helps people forget the dust bowl and its legacy of inferior Okies. When the Sooners are winning, everything is okay in Oklahoma.\n\nOne result of this intense devotion is the winningest record in contemporary college football. Under Bud Wilkinson in the Fifties, Oklahoma won forty-seven consecutive games and three national championships. After sputtering through the Sixties with more mortal seasons, the Sooners have jumped back to the top in the Seventies. Since 1971, Oklahoma has won eighty-one,\n\nPhilip Taubman is a roving editor of Esquire magazine.\n\nlost seven, and tied two, winning national championships back to back in 1974 and 1975. This year, they were undefeated, still number one going into the final games of the season, another national title within reach.\n\nThe other result of Oklahoma’s football fever is a college football program grossly out of control, a team and a head coach running away with a university. It is football madness, with a vengeance. OU is where the university president once said, “We want to build a university the football team can be proud of.” And he wasn’t kidding. Today, Oklahoma is the quintessential example of an academic institution warped by an athletic team. It is the story of how a football program, when unchecked, can grow into a corrupt and corrupting empire. But it is mainly the story of a head football coach—Barry Switzer—who has become a king, not only of his campus but of his state, overshadowing everyone from the university president to the governor. This season, King Switzer’s court has rivaled that of Louis XIV of France: Rabelaisian tales of cuckolds and scandals on the OU coaching staff and board of regents abound, stories that have left Oklahomans breathless to hear the latest rumor about infidelity.\n\nSometimes it is hard to know whether to cry or laugh about the football fanaticism of Oklahoma, it is so outrageous. One sad fact is certain, though: Oklahoma is not alone. It may do things on a bigger scale than most, but Oklahoma is part of a breed. At places like Ohio State, Alabama, Texas, Notre Dame, USC, Michigan, and Oklahoma, they’ve all forgotten football is just a game. It has become a big business, completely disconnected from the fundamental purposes of academic institutions. The goal of college ball is no longer for young men to test and strengthen their bodies, to learn about teamwork, and to have a good time. All that matters is winning, moving up in the national rankings, and grabbing a bigger share of the TV dollar that comes with appearances on NCAA’s game of the week on ABC. To achieve these aims, schools and coaches not only bend and break the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) rules governing college football but, far more destructively, violate the intellectual integrity and principles of the American university system. What I saw in a week at Oklahoma was a reflection of excesses and abuses at other schools. It was a disturbing, often frightening glimpse of what it takes to be number one in the nation.\n\nTHE PLANT\n\n“Hey, man, you got no hassles with regular students. ”\n\nA visitor can tell what the priorities are at Oklahoma U even before stepping onto campus. As you approach the town of\n\nOklahoma’s varsity program is grossly out of control. It’s a story of football madness. The coach and team are running away with the university.\n\nNorman, one building stands tall and clear above the rest— Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. It is located in the middle of campus and features a new upper level and press box that alone cost $9 million. The sumptuous press box, with its five levels and comfortable furnishings, is more like something you’d expect to find at the plush Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nAcross the street from the stadium is a complex of four redbrick buildings. Officially, it is called The Bud Wilkinson Complex. Around Norman, it is better known as the Sooner Hilton. Better accommodations Conrad Hilton himself could not provide. Three of the buildings are dorms—for athletes only— housing a total of 217 Oklahoma varsity players. Football ranks even here, however, and the nucleus of Coach Switzer’s team Stays in the newest of the three buildings, a $ 1.5-million luxury residence that is the galleria of student dorms in America. While normal Oklahoma students are accommodated two to a room, with a communal bath down the hall, the football heroes of the new athletic dorm are assigned two per suite. Each suite contains a bedroom, living room, and private bath. For entertainment, residents have a choice of eight pool tables in a large, carpeted poolroom on the first floor or a TV room with a six-foot screen and theater seats.\n\nThe fourth building in the Wilkinson Complex is the dining hall. Anyone who has ever eaten a dormitory meal would instantly appreciate the miracle of this place. The food is excellent and plentiful. Athletes walk away from the buffet area with plates piled high with steaks or prime ribs. The reason is quintessential\n\nOklahoma: the Sooner Beef Club. The beef club consists of over 200 individuals and businesses who support football by donating one steer annually to the athletic dining kitchen.\n\nThe dining hall, not surprisingly, is off limits to everyone but Oklahoma athletes. Other students are not welcome. Nor professors. Parents are welcome only on game days. Add to that the location of the complex—far from other student housing in Norman—and the result can be four years of segregated living and eating by Oklahoma athletes. Elvis Peacock, a star running back for the Sooners who now plays for the L.A. Rams, told me that the separate but unequal isolation was something he and his fellow players liked: “You don’t have to mess around with other students. You get no hassles.”\n\nIf spending four years closeted with fellow athletes is a definition of a college education, it’s news to me. I thought the whole idea of a university was exposure to different kinds of people and ideas. But Oklahoma isn’t selling education to high school football prospects—it’s selling football, pure and simple. By these standards, the Wilkinson Complex is a great help in signing up the best players. As Coach Switzer says, “I believe in first-class facilities for my players. I think they should be able to live together, play together, win together, and lose together.”\n\nThe extravagance of the football plant understandably irritates Oklahoma faculty members: OU is by no means a wealthy institution. The state of Oklahoma places thirtieth in its support of higher education, and the university has to share that meager funding with twenty-six other colleges and universities in Oklahoma, a glut of campuses only the state’s politicians try to justify. As a result, OU has spartan academic facilities and a large out-ofstate student body; its library is hurting; and faculty salaries are the lowest in the Big Eight. The football program is entirely selfsupporting—ticket revenue and donations exceed expenses by a wide margin—but that doesn’t make faculty members any happier. “It’s nice to have a football team,” fumes assistant political science professor Jean McDonald. “But this is, after all, supposed to be a university. Our priorities are skewed. Football fever here has gotten to the point of obscenity.”\n\nAnother way to put that is to count the number of books in a football player’s suite. I could find only fourteen books, most on business management, in one suite. This was the total library for two guys who have been enrolled for two years each.\n\nTHE SHARKS\n\n“Probation is a way of life at Oklahoma.”\n\nThe winning football tradition at Oklahoma has always had certain trademarks. A powerful running attack, for one. Oklahoma has produced star backs like Greg Pruitt, Steve Owens, Joe Washington, Horace Ivory, Elvis Peacock, and, this year, Billy Sims. The Sooners also play tough defense year after year. They always have great depth. Two, sometimes three top players for every position. The kicking game is generally consistent. Plus Oklahoma does one other thing well—it cheats.\n\nThe NCAA has put Oklahoma on probation three times since 1955, one of the worst records among major universities in the nation. In 1955-57, it was for making improper inducements to high school prospects. In 1960-61, for an athletic slush fund maintained several years earlier. In 1973-75, for improper inducements again as well as for a fraudulent transcript for Galveston, Texas, high school player Kerry Jackson. Two years ago, the NCAA conducted still another investigation, this time looking into ticket scalping by OU players. No public action was taken, but OU was told to stop letting players sell their season tickets at huge premiums to OU rooters. Even so, it is hard to spend any time at OU without hearing stories about continued scalping and huge profits raked in by coaches selling off large blocks of OUTexas tickets. Priced at $10, those seats sell for as much as $300 on the black market. The revenue is supposedly plowed into illicit payments to players for such items as cars and clothes.\n\nOklahoma has not been content with just recruiting violations. Several years ago, OU was caught spying on the opposition.\n\nThough technically not a violation of NCAA rules, the spying was unethical as hell. And comically clumsy. Before an OU game against California, four Sooners rooters drove down to Dallas to sneak in on a Cal practice at Texas Stadium. Questioned at the gate, they claimed to be interior decorators working on the Lincoln-Mercury Dealers’ Association box in the stadium. I met two of the spies when I was in Oklahoma, and less likely interior decorators it’s hard to imagine. They’re both heavy, roughlooking jocks. Officials let them in, but one stupidly signed his name in the security log. When rumors started spreading, newspapermen had no trouble unraveling the case.\n\nOther espionage schemes were tried. One spy infiltrated a Nebraska practice by posing as a painter. Another planned a more complicated alibi. He took a girl friend to the stadium with him and if caught was going to tell authorities they had merely been screwing in the bathroom.\n\nAll of this took a nasty turn when Oklahoma and Texas reporters started to write about it and the NCAA ticket-scalping investigation. Unfavorable publicity is not something Oklahoma rooters tolerate. After Oklahoma City Times reporter Frank Boggs broke the ticket story, he was subjected to the kind of harassment most Americans thought went out with the witchhunts. Dozens of death threats were phoned in to him and his family. Fellow reporter Jack Taylor got home one day to find police guarding his house. His editors told him that the Times had received thirty threats against Taylor and Boggs that day.\n\nBarry Switzer diplomatically says he doesn’t condone the hysteria, but he sums up the local feeling about Sooners football and its excesses when he says, “If you’re a reporter, be neutral or be for us, but don’t be against us. I don’t know why anyone would want to be against us.”\n\nTHE KING\n\n“That's one shrewd son of a bitch.”\n\nBarry Switzer is a multiple exposure. The more time you spend with him, the more personalities you see.\n\nThere is the coach. At age forty-one, with stylishly long blond\n\nOU’s winning tradition has always had certain trademarks. Powerful running. A tough defense. Consistent kicking. And the coaching staff cheats. Barry has a big smile and a contagious laugh, he is anything but an intimidating, arrogant football boss. In his white shirt and Oklahoma-red polyester pants, he hugs the ground on the sidelines during games, kneeling, crawling, always watching the flowing action, always tethered to the bench by the wires running to his headset. In the office, he is loose, gregarious, puffing on a fat cigar, ordering aides about, telling jokes. His record is unmatched: 59-5-2 since taking over Oklahoma in 1973. His method is simple: Recruit the best players; hire the best assistant coaches; build the best facilities; and, using his own superior football instincts, refine the wishbone attack at Oklahoma into the most formidable offense in the nation.\n\nThere is the public personality. Monday-noon press lunches— paper-thin ham steaks and rubber beans—at the Holiday Inn in Norman, where he parries questions from thirty reporters, giving them good lines to quote by being disarmingly frank but little else. Question: “Did you lose the Orange Bowl last year because there was too much partying?” Answer: “What the hell are you supposed to do after seven P.M. in Miami? Tell the players to go to bed?” Twice a week he appears on TV. First on Sunday nights in an hour-long show that reviews the previous day’s game. Then on Thursdays at 6:30, when he stars in The Barry Switzer Show, a breezy thirty-minute mix of commentary about the upcoming game, interviews with players, and analyses of the previous Sunday’s results. The first TV show is broadcast around the Midwest and Southwest: Dallas, Houston, Amarillo, New Orleans, St. Louis, Kansas City, plus Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Boosters\n\nThe Bud Wilkinson Complex is a great help in signing high school players. Oklahoma isn’t selling education. It’s selling football, pure and simple.\n\naround the state pick up the tab when advertisers won’t. “We do it,” says Switzer, “because it’s a great recruiting tool.” Finally, there is a daily five-minute radio program aired in Oklahoma.\n\nOn all these shows, Switzer is engaging, amusing, and extremely articulate. He projects like a seasoned movie star, never stumbling or hesitating. When something comes up on the monitor he is not prepared for, he improvises brilliantly.\n\nThere is the entrepreneur. Switzer earns only $42,000 as a football coach, but he probably makes five times that as a businessman. Some of the income comes from the TV shows. Some of it comes from local investments, such as an apartment house in Norman called Switzerland (after the coach, not the country). Oklahoma rooters in the oil business steer Switzer toward good investments in the oil fields. And he has even earned money by endorsing cars and air conditioners. It burned up OU faculty to see him on the air selling products in his Sooners jacket or cap.\n\nThen there is the good ol’ boy. Switzer grew up in tiny Crossett, Arkansas, and has never shed some of the flamboyant, fun-loving tastes he acquired at parties and bars. He loves to drink, especially beer. Give him forty minutes in a bar, and he’ll consume three or four cans of Coors. He likes to visit Las Vegas and New York, gambling a bit in the former, going to shows in\n\nthe latter. He likes to be around attractive women. When the show A Chorus Line was playing in Oklahoma City, Switzer had the actors down for a look at football practice, having joined them previously at the opening-night cast party. Switzer is married, with three children, but that seems hardly to have cramped his style.\n\nHis reputation as a ladies’ man has fueled all kinds of rumors around Oklahoma, particularly during the last year. Last spring, a member of the team’s staff told friends he discovered that Switzer was having an affair with his wife. The man said Switzer had paid him $25,000 hush money. Switzer vehemently denies the story, saying, “It’s all a fabrication.” Switzer’s accuser now refuses to discuss the matter, saying, “I just don’t want to hurt anyone.” Nevertheless, the story has persisted and flourished in the hothouse atmosphere of Oklahoma. You can’t set foot in the state these days without hearing someone talk about “Peyton Place at OU.” Switzer isn’t the only target. Another story holds that a member of the august board of regents is involved with an assistant coach’s wife.\n\nWhether winning or sinning, Barry Switzer is the talk and toast of the state. He is king of Oklahoma. When he walks into restaurants, people give up their table for him. When he sets foot in stores, shopkeepers refuse to take payment. Between Switzer and newly appointed Oklahoma president William S. Banowsky, a charming but uncharismatic man, there is no contest about who is big man on campus: Switzer, by a football field. Significantly, it was Switzer who introduced Banowsky to the people of Oklahoma by asking the president to be a guest on The Barry Switzer Show. Banowsky, a realist, accepts his fate. “Given the intense devotion of the fans and the expectations of the board of regents,” he says frankly, “it’s much easier to be president when we’re 8 and 0. If it was the other way around, both Barry and I would be looking for other jobs.”\n\nTHE HUNT\n\n“We’ve got to sign up ten to fifteen running backs. ”\n\nWhen Barry Switzer says he has no budget for recruiting— “costs never concern us”—he means it. I learned that firsthand on a sixteen-hour recruiting swing through Texas with Switzer. We left Oklahoma City at 9:30, flying to San Antonio. Not on Braniff or American. We traveled south on a private, gleamingwhite Lear Jet, loaned to Switzer by OU alumnus Steve Jernigan, now a wealthy oilman. In San Antonio, we traded in the jet for a prop King Air so we could land at small-town Texas airports. The King Air was borrowed from Jakie Sandefer, another oilman who played halfback at Oklahoma in the 1950s.\n\nIt turns out the two planes are part of Oklahoma’s “Big Red Air Force,” a fleet of over sixty jets and prop aircraft that Sooner supporters make available to Switzer and his staff for recruiting trips. The coaches use the fleet freely, heading out every other week to hit high schools throughout the Southwest. In January, when prospects make visits to Norman, the best are flown in on a private jet. “People ask why we don’t have our own planes,” Switzer told me as he settled back into the soft, brown-leather seat of the Lear Jet. “Hell, why should we when we’ve got access to planes like these? They aren’t doing anybody any good when they’re sitting on the ground.”\n\nIn San Antonio, we were met at the airport by OU assistant coach Rex Norris, the man responsible for recruiting in south central Texas. Our first stop was John Jay High School, where Switzer wanted to meet one of the state’s top running backs. Switzer, at his easygoing best, gave the prospect a sales pitch about the advantages of playing at Oklahoma: exposure on TV, appearances in bowl games, visibility for Heisman Trophy voting, modern facilities, and, of course, a winning team. The kid seemed impressed, probably not yet having heard the same thing from fifteen other college coaches.\n\nFrom the high school, we drove to a junior high where the prospect’s mother teaches homemaking. There, in the midst of sewing machines and screaming kids, Switzer repeated his num-\n\nber. The exercise was critical to recruiting. A coach must win the hearts and minds of parents to sign up the son.\n\nNext stop was Luling, Texas, a dusty hamlet of about 5,000 located between San Antonio and Houston, which looked as if it were the set of The Last Picture Show. We set down on a narrow, undulating airstrip that was overgrown with weeds and seemed far too short for takeoff. The local high school coach drove us into town. Everything was fine, until he couldn’t locate the player Switzer wanted to see. The coach, already unnerved by the presence of Barry Switzer in Luling, showed signs of incipient panic. Luckily, he bought time by taking us to the local barbecue joint where Switzer gorged himself on ribs, beef, and greasy sausage. Switzer was in his element, scarfing down the food without knife or fork, biting huge chunks out of a raw onion.\n\nThe Luling coach finally found his running back driving around town and chased him down. Switzer immediately jumped into the front seat of the kid’s souped-up Aspen, looking ridiculously out of place in his blue blazer and tie. Meanwhile, the luck of the high school coach wasn’t getting any better: When he started up his movie projector to show us films of the back in action, the projection lamp blew out. Then, in a tizzy, he answered his phone at home with the greeting, “Coach’s office.”\n\nWhen we finally left Luling, lifting off the ground no more than ten yards before the end of the runway, Switzer couldn’t stop laughing at the misfortune of the Luling coach. “The poor bastard,” howled Switzer. “He didn’t even know where he was.”\n\nAfter a brief stop in Rosenberg, Texas, another small town, this one located outside Houston, we took off for nearby Columbus to see Eric Dickerson, one of the most coveted high school running backs in the nation.\n\nGreat, except that it was now dark—the Columbus airport had no lights. Diverted, we landed at a forgettable airport called Eagle Lake, a crop duster strip in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately, we found three crop duster pilots working on the engine of a beat-up pickup truck, and in exchange for $20 one of them drove us to Columbus.\n\nSan Antonio, Luling, Rosenberg, and now Columbus. I felt as if I were running for governor of Texas. We still had to hit Houston, where the Lear Jet would be waiting to take us back to\n\nWhether winning or sinning, Barry Switzer is the talk and toast of Oklahoma. The coach’s reputation as a ladies’ man fuels all kinds of rumors.\n\nOklahoma City. Switzer was tired, but he pumped himself up for one more recruiting performance. It was a bust. Young Dickerson, clearly bored by yet another college football coach, listened with only one ear, interrupting Switzer to talk to several female fans. Switzer dutifully ordered himself a glass of milk. As soon as he left Dickerson and the Columbus Cafe behind, he emptied two cans of Coors.\n\nWe got back to Oklahoma City at 1:30 Saturday morning. Game day. In nine hours, the motorcade would be leaving for Norman. The hunt for new players was over, until the next week. “We got to get us a few running backs,” said Switzer as he headed off to his hotel room. That means three or four, I thought. “If we get ten or fifteen, we’ll be okay,” he added.\n\nFifteen running backs. That is absurd. No team can possibly use that many. What Switzer was saying was that he’d bring in fifteen, pick the best two or three, then discard the rest or turn them into defensive backs. Who cares about the kids or their education? The idea is to amass the best football talent. Get the cogs that will keep the machine running smoothly.\n\nWhen you rule an empire, you can do that. No one in Oklahoma is going to stop Barry Switzer. President Banowsky is cowed, the faculty is powerless, and the board of regents loves to have the number-one football team in the nation. The notion of a balance between academics and athletics has been completely abandoned, and these professional football bureaucrats do what they please to enhance their reputations. They’ve got a lot of nerve calling it college football. 4H-\n\n1979• No. 4 Texas 16, No. 3 Oklahoma 7 (pending more information)\n\nO.U. was held to 177 yards and Texas to 170 on a rainy afternoon. It featured one of the most controversial calls in series history — O.U. defensive back Keith Stanberry's apparent interception in the end zone on Texas' final possession.\n\nHowever, the play was ruled an incomplete pass, and Texas' Jeff Ward kicked a 32-yard field goal as time expired to tie the game. Ironically, it was an Oklahoma football that Ward said was so waterlogged that \"it must have weighed 10 pounds.\"\n\n#1 Oklahoma vs. Texas: The 10 Greatest Red River Rivalry Games\n\nClick on the link below for Jeff’s oral history\n\nJEFF WARD - THE GAME CHANGER (squarespace.com)\n\nBy Malcolm Moran, Special To the New York Times\n\nOct. 14, 1984\n\nCredit...The New York Times Archives\n\nAbout the Archive\n\nThe archive is a digitized version of an article from The Times before its online publication in 1996. To preserve these articles as they originally appeared, The Times does not alter, edit, or update them.\n\nOccasionally, the digitization process introduces transcription errors or other problems; we are continuing to work to improve these archived versions.\n\nThe 32-yard field goal by Jeff Ward of Texas, with zeroes on the clock at the end of a rainy, zany, slippery, mistake-filled afternoon, left the numbers tied on the scoreboard at 15.\n\nBut when it was time to leave the Cotton Bowl and head to the Texas State Fair, the emotions on the field, where Texas Longhorns leaped, and Oklahoma Sooners sat sadly, and in the stands, where a celebration began on one side and obscenities were screamed from the other, bore little resemblance to the final score.\n\nHistory will show that the 79th Texas-Oklahoma game ended in the fourth tie of the series, but emotional memories will say that Texas won, 15-15.\n\n\"It feels like a loss to me,\" said Keith Stanberry, the Sooner senior defensive back whose apparent interception on the next-to-last play of the game was ruled an incomplete pass that gave Texas a chance to tie.\n\n\"This is a lot better than losing,\" said a Texas senior, Rob Moerschell, who controlled a high snap on the last play and made the placement for Ward's game-saving kick.\n\nThe top-ranked Longhorns (3-0-1), who had led by 10-0 at the half, benefited from two penalties and the disputed incompletion that went against the Sooners (4-0-1), who had been ranked as high as No. 2 in one of the most recent news-agency polls and with the help of an Oklahoma decision to take an intentional safety with 2 minutes 10 seconds to play rather than punt from its end zone, Texas avoided the fourth defeat of a No. 1- ranked team this season.\n\nUntil the final moments, that defeat had seemed inevitable. The Sooner defense had stopped the Longhorns for four straight plays after facing a first-and-goal situation from its 2-yard line, giving Oklahoma the ball with 3:51 to play. But the Sooners moved just 5 yards, and the intentional safety, a high snap over the head of the punter Mike Winchester, cut the Oklahoma lead to 15-12. The free-kick gave the Longhorns the ball at the Texas 44 with 2:04 to play.\n\n\"I think it was the call, no doubt about it,\" said Barry Switzer, the Oklahoma coach. \"I'd rather kick from the 20 than punt from the back of the end zone with a rush coming at us.\"\n\n\"I was pleased that he did it,\" Akers said.\n\nWhat happened next can only fuel the debates that have grown since the series began in 1900. First, Switzer claimed that the first-down pass for 3 yards to Jerome Johnson should have been ruled a fumble. Instead, a pass-interference call against the Sooners gave Texas a first down after Todd Dodge's third-down pass for Brent Duhon had fallen incomplete. Then, an offside penalty against the Sooners on third-and-10 from the Oklahoma 41 gave the Longhorns the ball at the 36, with just 5 yards needed for the first down.\n\nA 15-yard pass to the tight end William Harris and an 11-yard pass to Bryant moved the Longhorns to the Sooner 10 with 19 seconds to play. However, an illegal-motion penalty moved Texas back to the 15.\n\nThen, on Dodge's last pass, the senior Bill Boy Bryant was double-teamed in the right side of the end zone by Stanberry and Andre Johnson, a freshman. The ball appeared to be intercepted by Stanberry with five seconds to play.\n\n\"It was an interception,\" Stanberry said. \"I went up to one official, and I asked him. He said I didn't catch the ball. Another official said, 'You caught the ball, but your feet weren't inbounds.' \"\n\nJust a few moments before, the Sooners had seemed sure of a victory after taking advantage of several Texas mistakes and setting aside their deceptive option offense to keep the ball between the tackles.\n\nThe sophomore Sooner punter, Winchester, set up the only Texas touchdown, a 25-yard pass from Dodge to Bryant when he could not handle a snap in the first quarter. But Winchester began Oklahoma's third-quarter comeback with a 48-yard punt downed at the Texas 2-yard-line. The Longhorn senior fullback, Terry Orr, fumbled two plays later at the 6. When Stanberry recovered the ball, the game had taken its turn.\n\nSteve Sewell, a senior running back who did not carry the ball in the first half, went straight ahead from the 5 for the score that brought the Sooners within 10-7. Foul on the Kickoff\n\nA dead-ball foul on the kickoff sent Texas back to its 10-yard line. On fourth-and-12 from the 18, Terry Steelhammer, the Texas snapper for punts, sent the ball high over John Teltschik's head and out of the end zone for an Oklahoma safety that cut the Texas lead to 10-9.\n\nFollowing the free-kick, the Sooners converted three third-down situations and drove 71 yards for the score that put them ahead. Sewell, who had made two catches on third-down plays to keep the drive going, bounced off a tackler and went to the left for a 12-yard touchdown that gave Oklahoma a 15-10 lead.\n\nBut when the Sooners attempted a 2-point conversion, a looping pass for Sewell was tipped away by Steven Braggs, a sophomore defensive back, and the Longhorns were still within 5 points near the end of the third period.\n\nWith less than five minutes to go in the game, Texas had its chance to go back ahead when it drove to the Oklahoma 2-yard line. Orr gained a yard on the first down but was stopped on the next two plays. Nelson took a pitchout to the right on fourth down, but Stanberry and Andre Johnson were there. Nelson slipped, and Texas was stopped for what seemed to be the last time.\n\nThat is, until the last time, the moment that will inflame future conversations at future state fairs.\n\n\"If we were the No. 1 football team,\" said Danny Bradley, the Oklahoma quarterback, \"we wouldn't have gone for the tie.\"\n\n\"Generally, you don't like a tie,\" said Fred Akers, the Texas coach. \"But this is not generally.\"\n\nA version of this article appears in print on Oct. 14, 1984, Section 5, Page 1 of the National edition with the headline: TEXAS TIES OKLAHOMA, 15-15.

The Sooners were ahead 15-12 with just 10 seconds on the clock. Texas quarterback Todd Dodge hailed a pass into the end zone, only to be intercepted by Oklahoma.\n\nThat is until officials called the pass incomplete. This controversial call angered fans, and Texas kicked a field goal with five seconds remaining.\n\n1985• No. 2 Oklahoma 14, No. 17 Texas 7\n\nEn route to another national title, O.U.'s defense held Texas to minus-27 yards in the second half and 70 for the game. Coach Switzer considered abandoning the wishbone to take advantage of Troy Aikman’s incredible arm, but Troy got hurt early in the season, so Barry stayed with the wishbone. Texas only had 4 first downs and negative yardage in the second half of this game. Switzer said this was O.U.’s greatest defensive performance in his 20 years coaching for the Sooners.\n\n1986• No. 16 Oklahoma 47, Texas 12\n\nO.U.'s defense was rock solid again, holding Texas to three first downs in the first half while building a 31-0 lead.

In the book \"Down and Dirty- The Life and & Crimes of Oklahoma Football\" by Charles Thompsons and Allan Sonnenschein, Charles says, \"I was always told by my coaches that they would take care of me. All the guys I played with were told that, and maybe that's why we carried on as we did—thinking that they'd take care of it, pick up after us. \"\n\n1988• No. 10 Oklahoma 28, Texas 13\n\nAnthony Stafford's 86-yard T.D. run keyed a 344-yard Sooners ground attack. It was the last Texas-Oklahoma game for Switzer, who resigned after the season due to O.U.'s continuing problems with the NCAA.\n\nThe drug-related arrest of quarterback Charles Thompson, Bookies, shootings, and alleged rapes of a 20-year-old woman by three Sooner football players rocked Norman.\n\nJamelle Holieway and Charles Thompson were called to Coach Switzer's office to discuss each associating with a bookmaker. The irony is that Coach is the one who introduced us to the bookies.\n\nWilliam Morris, a writer for Southern Living Magazine, has a unique spin on Texas and O.U.'s rivalry. He quotes Texas sportswriter Gary Cartwright, who suggests a more profound and perhaps ominous significance in the rivalry between the two universities. Oil and football, he contends, shape the two universities' characters and, to a degree, the states. Texas and Oklahoma are neighbors only by a quirk of geography. Gary says, \"They were separated by the Red River, which used to separate New France from New Spain. \"What separates them is a century and a half of history—the Alamo as opposed to the Dust Bowl. When you hear a Texan or an Oklahoman called the other neighbor, it just means they share ownership in an oil well. They are like tribes connected by a common hatred, two people who look on one another with a special loathing usually reserved for cannibalism.\"\n\n1989• Texas 28, No. 15 Oklahoma 24\n\nTexas had not beaten the Sooners since 1984.\n\nOf course, Coach Gibbs's primary responsibility was to clean up the Sooner image after Barry Switzer was forced out after a series of misdeeds under his watch. Sooner great Gary Gibbs was 44-23-2 in his tenure at Oklahoma but was 1-5 against Texas.\n\nEnter Peter Gardere. The redshirt freshman quarterback from Houston Lee moved the Longhorns 66 yards in seven plays to a game-winning 25-yard T.D. pass to Johnny Walker with 1:33 to play. Wayne Clements kicked two field goals, and Mical Padgett picked up a fumbled punt and ran it back 44 yards for a touchdown."
