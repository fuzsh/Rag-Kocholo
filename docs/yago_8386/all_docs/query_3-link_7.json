No one was more demanding nor more allegorical than he in showing the state of crisis of contemporary man. His best known film is La Grande Bouffe, starring Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Philippe Noiret and Ugo Tognazzi.\n\nHis 1979 film Chiedo asilo won him the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival.
