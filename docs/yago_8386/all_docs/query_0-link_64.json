        "text": "UPDATE: Lav Diaz’s The Woman Who Left scooped the Golden Lion at the 73rd Venice Film Festival tonight, while Tom Ford’s noir thriller Nocturnal Animals was triumphant in the director’s return to the Lido after 2009’s A Single Man. The best-reviewed film of the two weeks, Damien Chazelle’s La La Land, danced its way to a Best Actress Volpi Cup for Emma Stone.\n\nSpreading the wealth, Sam Mendes’ jury gave the screenwriting prize to Noah Oppenheim for Pablo Larrain’s raved-about Jackie, a study of Jackie Kennedy as played by Natalie Portman in the days after the assassination of John F Kennedy.\n\nAll told, this was a good night for films that have already entered the awards conversation and a somewhat more commercial band of winners than we’ve seen in recent years when Best Picture Oscar winners Spotlight and Birdman were overlooked here.\n\nFilipino director Diaz’ drama, The Woman Who Left, is one of the less commercial propositions. It clocks in at 226 minutes and centers on a woman who has spent 30 years in prison. Wrongly convicted of the crime, she is released and settles into a new life after a friend admits to framing her. It’s inspired by a Tolstoy short, God Sees The Truth But Waits. Diaz’ A Lullaby To The Sorrowful Mystery — at 485 minutes — won the Silver Bear in Berlin last year. Mendes said, “We’re here to encourage people to come to the cinema to see original films.”\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe full list of winners announced tonight is below; I’ll be back with some words from the jury.\n\nPREVIOUS The awards ceremony for the Venice Film Festival 2016 is just getting started in the Sala Grande. The jury, led by Sam Mendes, has a rich roster of movies to choose from this year. Among the best reviewed have been Damien Chazelle’s La La Land, Pablo Larrain’s Jackie, Tom Ford’s Nocturnal Animals, Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival and Terrence Malick’s Voyage of Time.\n\nAmong the offshore titles that have played to acclaim are Argentine dramedy El Ciudadano Ilustre (The Distinguished Citizen) from Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat; and French pics Stephane Brizé’s Une Vie and François Ozon’s Frantz.\n\nVenice juries can be fickle and sometimes the best reviewed movies leave the Lido empty-handed — as was the case recently with eventual Best Picture Oscar winners Spotlight and Birdman. But some are predicting this could be a big year here for Hollywood. We’ll know more in just a bit. The winners will be updated below as they are announced:\n\nVENICE 73\n\nGolden Lion:\n\nThe Woman Who Left, Lav Diaz\n\nGrand Jury Prize:\n\nNocturnal Animals, dir: Tom Ford\n\nSilver Lion, Best Director:\n\nTIE\n\nAmat Escalante, La Region Salvaje\n\nAndrei Konchalovsky, Paradise\n\nVolpi Cup, Best Actress:\n\nEmma Stone, La La Land\n\nVolpi Cup, Best Actor:\n\nOscar Martinez, El Ciudadano Ilustre\n\nBest Screenplay:\n\nNoah Oppenheim, Jackie\n\nSpecial Jury Prize:\n\nThe Bad Batch, dir: Ana Lily Amirpour\n\nMarcello Mastroianni Award for for Best New Young Actor or Actress:\n\nPaula Beer, Frantz\n\nVENICE HORIZONS\n\nBest Film:\n\nLiberami, dir: Federica Di Giacomo\n\nBest Director:\n\nFien Troch, Home\n\nSpecial Jury Prize:\n\nBig Big World, dir: Reha Erdem\n\nBest Actress:\n\nRuth Diaz, The Fury Of A Patient Man\n\nBest Actor:\n\nNuno Lopes, Sao Jorge\n\nBest Screenplay:\n\nWang Bing, Bitter Money\n\nBest Short Film:\n\nLa Voz Perdida, dir: Marcelo Martinessi\n\nLion of the Future – “Luigi De Laurentiis” Venice Award for a Debut Film:\n\nThe Last Of Us, dir: Ala Eddine Slim\n\nVENICE CLASSICS\n\nBest Restoration:\n\nBreak-Up – The Man With The Balloons, dir: Marco Ferreri"
