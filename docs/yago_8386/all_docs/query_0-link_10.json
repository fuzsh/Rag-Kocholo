        "text": "Hello my dear readers… it’s been a while since the last time we saw each other, isn’t it? :)\n\nI’ve reviewed a new rare movie, the very brilliant Break Up by the maverick and explosive Italian director Marco Ferreri, who gained notoriety for his very polemic movies in the ’60 and the ’70. I found Break Up to be a very fresh movie, in spite of it’s age, talking about topics that are still very actual.\n\nI plan to start some new music again, more or less regularly, and have some more reviews and article to bring online, I hope in a relative short time.\n\nIn the mean time you can read Break Up’s review here.\n\nSee you!"
