        "text": "Ferreri’s anti-bourgeois black comedy centres on the life of Rodolfo, a middleclass man who leases one room in the overcrowded apartment of Doña Martina, a crotchety octogenarian who is dying. Until he can afford his own place, Rodolfo cannot marry Petrita, his embittered fiancée. Petrita persuades her meek boyfriend to propose to Doña Martina so that he can inherit the apartment. Grotesque, funny, macabre, this is the result of the first union of two geniuses – Ferreri and the corrosive and highly intelligent screenwriter Rafael Azcona.\n\nMarco Ferreri was Born in Milan in 1928 and started as director in Spain. His films, black humor-tinged, has addressed the alienation of modern man. Films as controversial as The Buggy, Dillinger is dead, La grande Bouffe o La casa del sorriso which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.\n\nIsidoro Martínez Ferri, Barcelona (1925) is well know by his works in Spanish terror such a Face of Terror or Cruzada en el Mar."
