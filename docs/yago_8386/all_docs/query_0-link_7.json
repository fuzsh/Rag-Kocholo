The first of six films that Marco Ferreri made with Mastroianni, it was cut by two-thirds by producer Carlo Ponti and integrated as an episode into the omnibus film Oggi, domani, dopodomani (Luciano Salce, Eduardo De Filippo, 1965). After a meeting with Ponti, Ferreri shot a color dream sequence in 1967 and added it to the original version. However, there was never a theatrical release of the feature-length film in Italy. (hjf)"
