        "text": "Vintage borderless press photograph from the set of the 1964 film. Shown is Annie Giarardot (the \"ape woman\" in the film) in a dressing room with two other semi-clothed, \"normal\" women, conveying an immediate irony as she looks up at her husband (Ugo Tognazzi) standing in the doorway. With the stamps of both the French Dalmas and Italian Publifoto photo agencies on the verso. Inspired by the real life story of Julia Pastrana, who suffered from a condition that caused excessive hairiness, and was exhibited in a freak show and mummified after her death by her husband/manager. Nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes. 8.25 x 10.5 inches. Near Fine with a touch of rubbing to the edges and slight curl.\n\nVintage photographs from the 1968 absurdist comedy \"The Man with the Balloons,\" also known as \"Break Up,\" from the prolific Italian director Marco Ferreri. Marcello Mastroianni plays Mario Fuggetta, a wealthy industrialist, whose obsession with balloons derail his life and his relationship with his beautiful fiancee Giovanna (Catherine Spaak.) He'll drive himself mad trying to find out how much air a balloon can take before bursting. 8 x 10 inches. Near Fine, light wear on corners.\n\nFour vintage, oversize, borderless reference photographs from the 1963 Italian film. With the stamps of photographer Velio Cioni, and two press agencies on the verso. Two of the photographs show crew members putting the finishing touches on a mannequin of Jesus while director Ferreri looks on. A satire of masculinity and chauvinism, where a man marries a much younger woman, the woman wanting nothing more than to have a child. The mental and physical strain of trying to please her drives the man to a heart attack and death. Nominated for a Palme d'Or at Cannes, where Marina Vlady also won for Best Actress. 11.5 x 9.5 inches. Very Good plus."
