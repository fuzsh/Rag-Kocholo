        "text": "This polemical article objects to the pervasive use of realism as a value or prescriptive term in the writing of Italian cinema history. It also offers a dissenting appraisal of the ‘institution’ of neorealism: the body of critical work and discourse that constructs neorealism as the ethical and aesthetic centre of Italian cinema. The discursive recourse to neorealism has become the essential authoritative gesture: to fail to refer to it is to risk seeming ignorant, philistine and most of all politically suspect. We contest this insidious common sense of Italian cinema studies, a common sense that is underpinned by a notion of auteurist ‘paternity’ as the default explanatory metaphor of Italian ﬁlm history, and which leads to a dismissive tone in the discussion of genre ﬁlms, not to mention a disdain for the audience for such ﬁlms. We critique the idea of cinema as a ‘mirror’ of the nation found in some of the pre-eminent scholars of Italian cinema, and we ﬁnish by recommending a moratorium on the mention of neorealism for at least ﬁve years. What would a silence on realism allow us to reveal about other modes and genres? The article is followed by replies from Giulia Fanara (Rome), Millicent Marcus (Yale) and Robert Gordon (Cambridge), and then the authors’ own short response to the replies.\n\nCinema, as act of resistance, opposes the standardization characterizing the present audiovisual universe, proposing alternative solutions to conciliatory representation of world spread by mass-media. The political and ethical value of these images - antithetical to clichés in Deleuze's theory - is a pivotal feature that analysis should point out. This is one of the main goals of the different theoretical inquiries developed in these last years around cinema studies, whose ultimate aim is to remark the difference between the everyday praxis of the rule and the singular dimension of exception. More deeply, it seems that the most radical examples could be found in directors who pursue a constant comparison with this imagery, creating therefore devices able to reflect on sense construction mechanisms and strategies for representing the present. These theoretical objects - which carry out a perpetual movement between theory and praxis, between a general system and a local one - are elected places to testify theories efficacy and, at the same time, to implement analytical tools; such a process interpolates analysis and critics in order to achieve a broader comprehension of these texts meaning (Barthes, Greimas) and their feedback over the iconosphere (Lotman). My proposal is an attempt of investigation of filmic text through an interdisciplinary approach which could interpolate Semiotics and Aesthetics, focusing on the political value inherent artistic experience. The starting point is the specific notion of \"re-mediation\" (Bolter&Grusin), seen as peculiarity of contemporary audiovisual dimension. Although it could remind former concept of \"intertextuality\", \"re-mediation\" introduces the idea of comparison between media (i.d. system of rules, instead of specific device; Sontag), extending its effectiveness. The aim of this work is therefore to probe how cinema works in relation to those rhetoric strategies and devices (Foucault, Agamben) which propose a \"normal\" and \"agreeing\" representation of society and the present (Rancière). Contemporary Italian cinema represents the chartered ground of this reconnaissance. As a matter of fact, in its more self-conscious expressions, it seems to have renew its political attitude, tracing back Sixties and Seventies heritage of Pasolini, Rosi, Petri. Nanni Moretti, Matteo Garrone, Paolo Sorrentino, Alina Marazzi and Marco Bellocchio are directors who, more than other, have tried to reflect on conditions of representation of the real conceived by mass-mediatic system. In doing this, they oppose stratified and complex images, which demand to the beholder a cognitive work, to stereotyped and \"already-given\" ones: for instance, the different masks adopted to represent the figure of Silvio Berlusconi in Il caimano by Nanni Moretti, the confrontation with the historical or social inquiry in Gomorra and Il divo by Garrone and Sorrentino respectively, the use of found-footage in Marazzi's films, the iconic efficacy into a collective imagery construction in Bellocchio's Vincere. Through an analysis of these texts, the challenge consists therefore in finding those distinctive elements which could give an account of that ethical dimension conceived as image's double capability: \"to declare itself in lack of witness, and to invent the right forms to assume the whole debt\" (Montani).\n\nOf all the criticisms of André Bazin’s defense of cinematic realism, the most damning has been the claim that he did not account for its role in normalizing ideological and political interests. This article seeks to demonstrate that, on the contrary, he asserted a deep connection between the emergence of the medium and the political pressures of the age. The idea of ‘totality’ (and its three iterations indicated in the title) provides us the best clue to traces of these pressures and cinema’s complicity with them in Bazin’s writings. Through a philological approach, the article links some of Bazin’s most directly political writings—on Stalinist cinema, the war documentary, and Italian neorealism—to the original version of ‘The Myth of Total Cinema’. The argument it recovers is that the ideologically abusive uses to which cinema had been susceptible in Bazin’s time proceed in a deep way from its relationship to the contradictions of democratic politics of the century. In the course of this demonstration, the article traces Bazin’s response to Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the question of Stalin’s show trials, the influence on him of the Annales school, and his invocation of Joseph Goebbels’ understanding of ‘total war’."
