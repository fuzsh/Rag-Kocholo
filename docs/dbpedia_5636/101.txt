Ocean’s Twelve

“The gang goes to Europe! Released to mixed reception in 2004, I think this movie deserves a reevaluation. OCEAN’S TWELVE is director Steven Soderbergh maximizing the amount of fun that can be had in a star-driven Hollywood movie. Every scene has the energy of an inside joke, it feels like you’re hanging out with the coolest friend group in the world. A movie like this would not be made on this scale in 2023!

The people of New York need to witness the best wipe transitions this side of the 21st Century on the big screen!” — Staff pick by Sebastian, Projectionist.
