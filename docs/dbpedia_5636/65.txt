A new Ocean's movie? Warner Bros. is assembling a crew.

Four years after the premiere of Ocean's Eight, the most recent movie in the franchise, the studio is in active development on a new installment, one set to star and be produced by Harley Quinn actress Margot Robbie, EW has learned.

The concept, though not officially greenlit at this point, is set in 1960s Europe and will be directed by Jay Roach. The filmmaker previously worked with Robbie on 2019's Bombshell, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.

Plot details for the new Ocean's movie, from writer Carrie Solomon, are currently under wraps, but Warner Bros. is hoping to start production in 2023. Two things seem certain: There will be some sort of heist and some sort of team-recruiting. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news.

Re-imagining the 1960 Rat Pack movie, the Ocean's franchise began in 2001 with Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven. Starring Brad Pitt and George Clooney, the film saw a Mr. Danny Ocean (Clooney) assembling a crew to pull off the most sophisticated casino heists in history. This was followed by Ocean's Twelve in 2004 and Ocean's Thirteen in 2007, all with Soderbergh and the same main cast.

2018 welcomed a new take on the material with the female-led Ocean's Eight. This time helmed by Gary Ross, the movie focused on Debbie Ocean (Sandra Bullock), Danny's younger sister, who set her sights on New York City's illustrious Met Gala.

So far, those involved with the new movie beyond Robbie and Roach are producers Tom Ackerly and Michelle Graham, and executive producers Ross, Olivia Milch, and Josey McNamara.

Happy heisting!
