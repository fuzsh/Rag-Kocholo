        "text": "The undisputed cinematic hit of the Summer was, of course, Barbie, in no small part due to the winning, joyous chemistry between leads Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, the duo are set to team up again, starring together in a prequel to 2001 film Ocean's Eleven. The new film is set to be directed by Jay Roach and written by Carrie Solomon, and is expected to be set in 1960s Europe.\n\nNow, Josey McNamara, who was an executive producer on Barbie and is executively producing the Ocean's prequel film, has spoken with GamesRadar about what fans can expect from the film, saying: \"I can’t really say much. But I think we’re just trying to do right by the franchise. I’m excited for people to experience it when it’s ready.\"\n\nWhen asked specifically about the reunion of Robbie and Gosling, McNamara said: \"They’re wonderful together. The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.\"\n\nGet exclusive film newsletters from our award-winning editorial team\n\nSign up to get alerts for movie news, reviews and recommendations\n\nEmail address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.
