        "text": "2023 Sundance is behind us, and mega deals for films like “Fair Play,” “Flora and Son,” and “Theater Camp” were back in a big way. And while the market was healthy, there still are a lot of films yet to find homes.\n\nHere’s the latest deals we’re tracking after the festival.\n\nFilms Acquired After the Festival\n\nTitle: “Fremont”\n\nSection: NEXT\n\nDistributor: Music Box Films\n\nIt took until May, but Music Box Films closed the North American rights to “Fremont,” the immigrant dramedy from director Babak Jalali (“Radio Dreams,” “Land”) that premiered in the NEXT section at Sundance. Music Box is planning a theatrical release for the film later this year, followed by a home entertainment release.\n\nJalali, an Iranian and British filmmaker, tells the story of an Afghan refugee in her mid-20s as portrayed by a real-life refugee, newcomer Anaita Wali Zada, whose complicated feelings about her prior work as a translator for the U.S. military have left her troubled and unable to sleep. The film now follows her drifting through life in Fremont, California and working at a fortune cookie factory, struggling to connect with this new culture, up until she uses those fortune cookies as a bridge to the outside world.\n\n“On Cinema” comedian Gregg Turkington and Jeremy Allen White of “The Bear” also co-star in the film. IndieWire in its review compared “Fremont” to a Jim Jarmusch style comedy and drama, captured in black and white with a “quietly magical” feel.\n\nThe sale of the film was negotiated by Brian Andreotti of Music Box Films and CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmakers. Memento International is handling international sales. Fremont is produced by Marjaneh Moghimi, Sudnya Shroff, Rachael Fung, George Rush, Chris Martin and Laura Wagner. Director Babak Jalali is represented by Christina Chou at CAA.\n\nTitle: “Sometimes I Think About Dying”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Oscilloscope\n\n“Sometimes I Think About Dying,” the Daisy Ridley drama that made its premiere in competition on the opening night of this year’s Sundance, was acquired by Oscilloscope for a theatrical release. O-Scope scooped up the U.S. rights to director Rachel Lambert’s film and will release it later this year.\n\nThe film is set on the dreary Oregon coast and follows a lonely woman who finds solace in her cubicle and the doldrums of office life. She is ghosting through life until she meets a co-worker persistent about making a connection with her. O-Scope in its announcement describes the film as “an unexpected fable on the virtues of living.”\n\nDave Merheje stars as the male lead alongside Ridley, and the film also stars Parvesh Cheena, Marcia Debonis, Meg Stalter, and Brittany O’Grady. “Sometimes I Think About Dying” was written by Kevin Armento, Stefanie Abel Horowitz, and Katy Wright-Mead. Ridley also produced the film alongside Alex Saks, Dori Rath, Lauren Beveridge, and Brett Beveridge. The deal was negotiated with CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nTitle: “The Pod Generation”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment\n\nSophia Barthes’ futuristic fable “The Pod Generation” starring Emilia Clarke and Chiwetel Ejiofor has landed with Roadside Attractions and Vertical Entertainment. The distributors acquired the North American rights to the film and will release it theatrically later this summer.\n\nBarthes’ (“Madame Bovary,” “Cold Souls”) film, which is based on her own original screenplay, is set in a future where AI has become all the rage and lucky couples can now get pregnant through mobile, artificial wombs called pods. The film follows a New York couple looking to start a family despite the doubts of the couple’s husband. “The Pod Generation” also stars Rosalie Craig, Vinette Robinson, and Jean-Marc Barr.\n\nThe film is produced by Geneviève Lemal, Yann Zenou, Nadia Kamlichi, and Martin Metz. Executive producers are Clarke, Barthes, David Bensadoun, Paul Nelson, Adrian Politowski, Nessa McGill, Sierra Garcia, Nathanaël Karmitz, and Beniamin Mincu. Jarowey and Senior Vice President of Acquisitions Tony Piantedosi negotiated the deal on behalf of Vertical; Cohen, d’Arbeloff and Vice President of Acquisitions Angel An negotiated the deal on behalf of Roadside Attractions; and CAA Media Finance together with MK2 Films negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nTitle: “Eileen”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Neon\n\nIn Neon’s only big splash out of Sundance, the distributor acquired William Oldroyd’s darkly romantic drama and thriller “Eileen” starring Thomasin McKenzie and Anne Hathaway. Neon plans to release it in theaters this fall.\n\nSet during a bitter 1964 Massachusetts winter, young secretary Eileen becomes enchanted by the glamorous new counselor at the prison where she works. Their budding friendship takes a twisted turn when Rebecca reveals a dark secret — throwing Eileen onto a sinister path.\n\n“Eileen” also stars Shea Whigham, Marin Ireland, and Owen Teague, and the film is based on a 2015 debut novel by Ottessa Moshfegh. Moshfegh co-wrote the screenplay alongside Luke Goebel. The film was produced by Fifth Season, Likely Story’s Anthony Bregman, Stefanie Azpiazu, and Peter Cron, along with Goebel and Moshfegh’s Omniscient Productions, William Oldroyd, and with backing from Film4.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Jeff Deutchman for NEON, WME Independent and Fifth Season.\n\nTitle: “Shortcomings”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nSony Pictures Classics has nabbed the worldwide rights to “Shortcomings,” the feature directorial debut of Randall Park, making it the indie distributor’s fourth acquisition from this year’s Sundance.\n\nPark’s film is an adaptation of the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name by Adrian Tomine and offers a fresh perspective on the Asian American experience. The film follows a struggling filmmaker living in Berkeley, California with his girlfriend, only for him to examine what he really wants out of life when his girlfriend moves to New York.\n\nJustin H. Min, Sherry Cola, and Ally Maki star in “Shortcomings” alongside a cast that also includes Tavi Gevinson, Debby Ryan, Sonoya Mizuno, Timothy Simons, and Jacob Batalon. Park wrote, directed, and produced the film.\n\nHieu Ho and Michael Golamco also produced for Park’s Imminent Collision banner. Other producers include Margot Hand for Picture Films and Howard Cohen, Eric d’Arbeloff, and Jennifer Berman for Roadside Attractions. Executive producers are Ryan Heller, Michael Bloom, Jennifer Semler, and Maria Zuckerman for Topic Studios; Tim Headington, Lia Buman, Max Silva and Neil Shah for Tango; Ryan Paine, also for Roadside Attractions, and Daniel Hank.\n\nNo release date has been announced. Sony Pictures Classics now walks away from Sundance with “The Persian Version” and “Shayda,” both of which won the Audience Award in the U.S. Dramatic and World Cinema Dramatic competitions, respectively. SPC also acquired Angus MacLachlan’s “A Little Prayer.”\n\nUTA and WME brokered the deal.\n\nTitle: “Scrapper”\n\nSection: World Cinema Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Kino Lorber\n\nKino Lorber has acquired North American rights to “Scrapper,” the debut film from Charlotte Regan that won the Grand Jury Prize in the World Cinema Dramatic competition. Harris Dickinson (“Triangle of Sadness”) and newcomer Lola Campbell star in this father-daughter comedy.\n\nCampbell plays a dreamy 12-year-old girl who lives alone in her London flat, filling it with magic after the death of her mother. Out of nowhere, her estranged father Jason (Dickinson) arrives and forces her to confront reality.\n\n“Scrapper” will have a theatrical release later this year, as well as a digital and home video release, all after it plays as the opening night film at the upcoming Sundance London.\n\nScrapper is a DMC Film production, financed by BFI, awarding National Lottery funding, BBC Film and Great Point Media. It was developed with the support of Creative England and the iFeatures scheme, and with the assistance of BFI and BBC Film. The film is produced by Theo Barrowclough and executive produced by Eva Yates, Farhana Bhula, Michael Fassbender, Conor McCaughan, Daniel Emmerson and Jim Reeve.\n\nThe deal was brokered by Kino Lorber Senior Vice President Wendy Lidell with Anonymous Content and Charades.\n\nTitle: “Divinity”\n\nSection: NEXT\n\nDistributor: Utopia and Sumerian\n\n“Divinity,” Eddie Alcazar’s surreal and mind-bending sci-fi film that played in the NEXT section out of Sundance, was acquired in a worldwide deal by distributor Utopia and entertainment company known for its music and comics called Sumerian. Utopia is planning an exclusive theatrical release this fall with an opening date soon to be announced.\n\nExecutive produced by Steven Soderbergh, “Divinity” is the story about an inventor who develops a revolutionary immortality serum but follows Stephen Dorff as the inventor’s son who has manufactured the serum into a miracle drug called “Divinity” sold en masse. The drug however has a sinister side effect, leading two mysterious alien brothers to land on Earth in an effort to abduct the mogul and save the planet in a quest for true immortality.\n\n“Divinity” also stars Moises Arias, Jason Genao, Michael O’Hearn, Karrueche Tran, and Emily Willis, with Scott Bakula, and Bella Thorne.\n\nThe “Divinity” acquisition was the first film deal of its kind for Sumerian, which this year will launch a streaming division and VOD platform for film and music lovers.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by CAA Media Finance on behalf of the filmmakers and Danielle DiGiacomo and Ryan Anthony Menge on behalf of Utopia and Sumerian.\n\nTitle: “Magazine Dreams”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Searchlight Pictures\n\nSearchlight Pictures has closed a deal on the worldwide rights to “Magazine Dreams,” Elijah Bynum’s intense drama that stars Jonathan Majors in an Oscar-caliber lead role. Though it wasn’t one of the classic late-night bidding wars, several buyers were in the mix for the buzzy film.\n\nMajors in “Magazine Dreams” plays a reclusive and socially awkward amateur bodybuilder with ambitions of fame and recognition flexing on a magazine cover. The film however earned comparisons to Martin Scorsese classics like “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” for its character’s sobering spiral, with the film taking some truly dark and bloody turns.\n\nThe film played in the U.S. Dramatic competition out of Sundance, where it picked up the Jury Award for Creative Vision, and was the center of some unfortunate controversy when the Sundance competition jury walked out of its premiere screening over a closed captioning issue, prompting the jury to ask other filmmakers to show their movies with open captions if available.\n\nMajors also stars alongside Haley Bennett, Taylour Paige, Harrison Page, Michael O’Hearn, and Harriet Sansom Harris. Jennifer Fox, Dan Gilroy, Simon Horsman, and Jeffrey Soros produced the film, with Majors executive producing. CAA brokered the deal.\n\nSearchlight dated the film for a December 8 theatrical release.\n\nTitle: “Shayda”\n\nSection: World Cinema Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Sony Pictures Classics\n\n“Shayda” is not only the winner of the audience award in the World Cinema Dramatic competition out of Sundance, but it is also executive produced by Cate Blanchett’s Dirty Films and stars Cannes’ Best Actress winner from last year Zar Amir Ebrahimi, leading Sony Pictures Classics to swoop in and acquire the film’s North American rights, as well as other territories.\n\n“Shayda” follows the title Iranian woman living in Australia who finds refuge in a women’s shelter with her 6-year-old daughter, Mona. Having fled her husband, Hossein, and filed for divorce, Shayda struggles to maintain normalcy and create a new home for Mona. Buoyed by the approach of Nowruz (Persian New Year), Shayda tries to forge a fresh start with new and unfettered freedoms. But when a judge grants Hossein visitation rights, he reenters their life, fueling Shayda’s apprehension that he’ll attempt to take Mona back to Iran.\n\nIranian-Australian filmmaker Noora Niasari directed and wrote the film based on her own personal experiences and made her debut with the project out of Sundance. “Shayda” is an Origma 45 production, and was produced by Vincent Sheehan and Niasari in association with Dirty Films, Parandeh Pictures, and The 51 Fund.\n\nThe deal was negotiated with United Talent Agency. HanWay Films will be selling the remaining international territories and screening SHAYDA to buyers in the upcoming EFM. Metropolitan have come on board as the French distributor. Local distribution in Australia and New Zealand will be handled by Madman Entertainment. Niasari is represented at United Talent Agency and Granderson Des Rochers, LLP.\n\nTitle: “The Starling Girl”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Bleecker Street\n\nIn the latest deal to close post-Sundance, Bleecker Street acquired the North American rights to another U.S. Dramatic title, writer-director Laurel Parmet’s feature directorial debut, “The Starling Girl.” The film stars Eliza Scanlen (“Little Women,” “Sharp Objects”) as a 17-year-old girl who struggles to define her place within her fundamentalist Christian community in rural Kentucky. Even her greatest joy — the church dance group — is tempered by worry that her love of dance is actually sinful. The film shows her grappling with her own sexuality and her mom’s urging that she begin courting.\n\nScanlen stars alongside Lewis Pullman, Jimmi Simpson, Wrenn Schmidt, and Austin Abrams. David Ehrlich in his IndieWire review called the film “a sensitive and devilishly detailed coming-of-age drama.”\n\nBleecker Street is planning to release “The Starling Girl” theatrically later this year. The film is produced by Kevin Rowe and Kara Durrett. Executive Producers include Jessamine Burgum, Will Greenfield, Douglas Choi, Martina Bassenger, Chris Stolte, Heidi Stolte, William Reedy, Emily Reedy and David Hinojosa.\n\nThe deal was negotiated by Miranda King and Avy Eschenasy on behalf of Bleecker Street and UTA Independent Film Group and WME Independent on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nTitle: “The Persian Version”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nSony Pictures Classics won the North American rights to “The Persian Version,” which won the Audience Award in the U.S. Dramatic competition out of Sundance.\n\nWritten, directed, and produced by Maryam Keshavarz, “The Persian Version” is a colorful and pop-music inflected film about an Iranian-American woman named Leila who is striving to find the balance between her two different cultures. When her family reunites in New York City for her father’s heart transplant, Leila navigates her relationships from arm’s length in an effort to keep her “real” life separate from her family life. But we soon find that her double life is not all that different from her mother’s.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation upon its premiere at Sundance, and Keshavarz’ film also won The Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award.\n\n“The Persian Version” was produced by Keshavarz for Marakesh Films, Anne Carey for Archer Gray Productions, Ben Howe and Luca Borghese for AGX, and Peter Block and Cory Neal for A Bigger Boat. It stars Layla Mohammadi, Niousha Noor, Kamand Shafieisabet, Bijan Daneshmand, Bella Warda, Chiara Stella, Tom Byrne, and Shervin Alenabi.\n\nUTA Independent Film Group represented US rights with Stage 6 Films. Keshavarz is represented by UTA, Anne Damato, and Victoria Cook at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz.\n\nFilms Acquired During the Festival\n\nTitle: “Nam June Paik: Moon Is the Oldest TV”\n\nSection: U.S. Documentary\n\nDistributor: Greenwich Entertainment/PBS Films\n\nIn another documentary sale to close on the tail end of the festival, Greenwich Entertainment acquired all rights (excluding TV) to “Nam June Paik: Moon Is the Oldest TV,” which is directed and produced by Amanda Kim and played in the U.S. Documentary competition.\n\nThe film tells the story of Nam June Paik, widely regarded as “The George Washington of Video Art,” a pillar of the American avant-garde in the 20th century, the coiner of the phrase “Electronic Superhighway,” and arguably the most famous Korean artist in modern history. The documentary charts Paik’s artistic evolution, from his formative education in Munich, through his rise in the New York art scene, and his Nostradamus-like visions of a future in which “everybody will have his own TV channel.” Thanks to social media, Paik’s future is now our present, and “Nam June Paik: Moon Is the Oldest TV” shows us how we got here.\n\nThe film will begin its U.S. theatrical release at Film Forum in New York on March 24, 2023 before its exclusive U.S. broadcast premiere on American Masters on PBS. Films We Like has acquired Canadian rights and will release the film theatrically simultaneously with Greenwich. Dogwoof previously acquired UK distribution rights and international sales rights, excluding Korea. A Korean distribution deal and streaming (SVOD) partner will be announced shortly.\n\nThe deals were negotiated by David Koh of Curatorial, on behalf of the filmmaker and producers along with Ed Arentz, Co-President of Greenwich Entertainment, Michael Kantor of American Masters Pictures, and Ron Mann of Films We Like.\n\nTitle: “The Eternal Memory”\n\nSection: World Cinema Documentary\n\nDistributor: MTV Documentary Films\n\nMTV Documentary Films on Friday, January 27 acquired worldwide rights to “The Mole Agent” director Maite Alberdi’s latest film, “The Eternal Memory.” MTV is planning a theatrical release for the movie along with a “robust awards campaign” to hopefully land Alberdi another Oscar nomination after “The Mole Agent” managed the same.\n\n“The Eternal Memory” tells the story of a couple that’s been together for 25 years, eight of which have involved the husband being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Augusto, the man suffering from Alzheimer’s, is also one of Chile’s most prominent cultural commentators and television producers known for covering the Pinochet dictatorship. And the film shows how he tries to build an archive of his own memory, preserve his identity, and keep the bond between him and his partner intact.\n\nThe film was produced by Maite Alberdi, Juan De Dios Larraín, Pablo Larraín, and Rocío Jadue. It is executive produced by Marcela Santibañez, Daniela Sandoval, Nicholas Hooper, Julie Goldman, Christopher Clements, Chandra Jessee and Rebecca Lichtenfeld.\n\n“The Eternal Memory” is a Micromundo and Fabula production. Submarine and United Talent Agency Independent Film Group brokered the deal with MTV Documentary Films on behalf of the filmmakers. UTA also represents Maite Alberdi.\n\nTitle: “Talk to Me”\n\nSection: Midnight\n\nDistributor: A24\n\nTurns out A24 didn’t have enough movies at this year’s Sundance. An individual with knowledge told IndieWire the distributor is nearing a deal for the North American rights to “Talk to Me,” the film from twin brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, better known as Australian YouTubers RackaRacka. The film premiered in the Midnight section at Sundance and is about a new party craze among teenagers that involves performing séances with the dead. But when one teen who recently lost her mother performs her own séance that goes wrong, the boundaries between the living and the dead slowly begin to close in on her, forcing her to act before its irreversible.\n\nVariety reported that A24 acquired the film in a high seven-figure deal, and it’s expected to have a theatrical release some time this summer.\n\nBankside Films brokered the deal.\n\nTitle: “A Little Prayer”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nSony Pictures Classics got into the buying frenzy on Tuesday, January 24 by acquiring “A Little Prayer,” the latest film from “Junebug” scribe Angus MacLachlan, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire. Jane Levy, David Strathairn, Will Pullen, Anna Camp, and Celia Weston star in this family drama set in a small town in North Carolina that explores the relationship a father (Strathairn) and his daughter in-law (Levy) and how it’s strained when he discovers his son (Pullen) is having an affair.\n\nSPC picked up “A Little Prayer” out of the Premieres section of the festival within 24 hours of its debut at The Ray Theatre on Monday. SPC confirmed on Jan. 27 it had acquired the worldwide rights to the film. No release plans were outlined.\n\nWME Independent handled the sale.\n\nTitle: “Passages”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: MUBI\n\nThe art house streamer, distributor and production house MUBI on January 24 acquired the US, UK, Ireland, and Latin America rights to Ira Sachs’ “Passages,” a drama starring Franz Rogowski, Adèle Exarchopoulos, and Ben Whishaw. The film is a personal story for Sachs and follows a filmmaker (Rogowski) who cheats on his husband (Whishaw) with a woman, only to become enflamed with jealousy once his husband pursues his own new relationship.\n\nFollowing an international premiere at the Berlin Film Festival’s Panorama section next month, MUBI will release “Passages” theatrically later this year.\n\n“Passages” is Sachs’ eighth feature, not to mention his sixth feature to debut at Sundance. This one has Saïd Ben Saïd (“Elle,” “Bacarau”) and Michel Merkt (“Toni Erdmann”) as producers, and IndieWire called the film “raw and resonant” in its review out of the festival.\n\nWME Independent and SBS International brokered the deal with MUBI. Sachs is repped by WME and Fusion Entertainment.\n\nTitle: “Flora and Son”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Apple TV+\n\nApple on Jan. 24 acquired the worldwide rights in a competitive situation to John Carney’s musical romance and comedy “Flora and Son” out of Sundance in a deal that an individual with knowledge says is in the high eight figures, with some reports saying it reached as high as $20 million.\n\n“Flora and Son” is about a mother (Eve Hewson) in Ireland who bonds more deeply with her troubled son (Orén Kinlan) over their shared love of a guitar. She takes lessons over Zoom from an instructor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who’s half a world away.\n\n“Once” was a global box office success in 2007 and won the Oscar for Best Original Song for “Falling Slowly.” Since then director John Carney has carved out a unique path as a storyteller of small character studies, often with a musical flavor. For his first feature since 2016’s “Sing Street,” Carney assembled Hewson, Gordon-Levitt, and Jack Reynor to tell another story of how music can change people’s lives in “Flora and Son.”\n\nApple made a splash in 2021 by acquiring the Sundance audience and jury prize winner “CODA” for $25 million, and that paid off with a Best Picture win.

The deal was in the high seven-figures range, an individual with knowledge told IndieWire. The directorial debut of Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman, the film stars Ben Platt, Jimmy Tatro, Noah Galvin, Patti Harrison, Owen Thiele, and Gordon herself. The film is a love letter to drama teachers and the unique vibe of theater education which anyone knows can veer toward the delightfully bizarre quite quickly.\n\nGordon and Lieberman acknowledged “Waiting for Guffman” and the parody-covers collection “Forbidden Broadway” as influences on their film, which takes the form of a mockumentary.\n\nSearchlight, which will release the film theatrically and will announce release plans at a later date, is clearly hoping for another mainstream crossover comedy success, in the mold of “Napoleon Dynamite” and “Little Miss Sunshine,” which the studio steered to massive hits when it was still Fox Searchlight.\n\nWME Independent brokered the deal.\n\nTitle: “Fair Play”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDistributor: Netflix\n\nIn the first major, big money deal of the festival, Netflix is nearing the global rights to “Fair Play,” an individual with knowledge told IndieWire, and which IndieWire has learned is in the range of $20 million.

CAA Media Finance brokered the deal with Magnolia.\n\nTitle: “Little Richard: I Am Everything”\n\nSection: U.S. Documentary\n\nDistributor: Magnolia/CNN Films\n\nThough it originally sat with CNN Films, Magnolia has acquired the worldwide theatrical rights to distribute “Little Richard: I Am Everything” and will release the film in domestic theaters this April. And Magnolia will also rep international sales rights on the title at EFM later this year. The film will still air on CNN later this year following its theatrical run.\n\nLisa Cortés (“Precious,” “All In: The Fight for Democracy”) directs this documentary about the rock icon Little Richard but approaches his legacy in the context of Blackness and queerness, as well as his own personal identity as it relates to his faith and Christianity. It also boasts Dee Rees as an executive producer and was produced by Bungalow Media + Entertainment for CNN Films and HBO Max, in association with Rolling Stone Films.\n\n“I Am Everything” is a Day One movie at Sundance, but it’s also one of six of the final long-form movies to come out of CNN Films that were commissioned from outside producers and filmmakers.\n\nTitle: “Run Rabbit Run”\n\nSection: Midnight\n\nDistributor: Netflix\n\n“Succession” actress Sarah Snook stars in this Midnight title from director Daina Reed, known for “The Shining Girls” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” The film is a thriller and horror movie about a fertility doctor who believes firmly in life and death, but after noticing the strange behavior of her young daughter, must challenge her own values and confront a ghost from her past.

The film stars Beauty Gonzalez, Felicity Kyle Napuli, Jasmine Curtis-Smith, James Mavie Estrella, and Angeli Bayani.\n\n“This is truly a moment for Filipino filmmakers to be seen by the international audience, and I hope this opens doors for more Filipino content to be watched by the rest of the world,” Dagatan said in part in an official statement.\n\nAmazon Prime Video acquired global rights to the title and plans to release “In My Mother’s Skin” by the end of 2023.\n\nFilms Acquired Ahead of the Festival\n\nTitle: “Other People’s Children”\n\nSection: Spotlight\n\nDistributor: Music Box Films\n\nMusic Box Films on Tuesday, January 10 acquired the U.S. rights to Rebecca Zlotowski’s family drama “Other People’s Children,” which first premiered at Venice in competition and will make its U.S. premiere at Sundance on January 20.

Corbijn interviews talent like Paul McCartney, Roger Waters, and Jimmy Page to tell the stories of albums such as Wings’ “Band on the Run,” Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” and Led Zeppelin’s “Houses of the Holy” in a film that should be catnip for classic rock heads.\n\n“Squaring the Circle” first made its premiere at Telluride 2022 and will play in the Spotlight section of the festival.

Director Jacqueline Castel has collaborated with everyone from John Carpenter, Jim Jarmusch, and David Lynch and should be able to go beyond the traditional genre beats. Jae Matthews (“The Runner”) wrote the script.\n\nParamount Worldwide Acquisition Group picked up the worldwide rights (excluding Canada) to “My Animal” ahead of the festival, though whether the film will be theatrical, released through Paramount+, or another channel has yet to be determined.\n\nTitle: “The Deepest Breath”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Netflix\n\nFrom “Free Solo” to free diving.
