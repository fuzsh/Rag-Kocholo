        "text": "Challenge\n\nHow do we convert a broad thriller audience to purchase at Home Ents, when a film has been positioned as female-specific at theatrical?\n\nSolution\n\nBringing the heist to life by hosting an Ocean’s 8 inspired brunch with the Daisy Green Collection, complete with a delicious menu, hidden gems and fantastic prizes.\n\nConsumers, press and influencers were tasked to showcase their talented ‘sleight of hand’ skills whilst tucking into their poached eggs. Those who found gems hidden around the venue and sneakily passed them to staff were rewarded with prizes and Ocean’s 8 Blu-rays. We launched with a press preview and opened the activity up to consumers across the Daisy Green sites during digital release.\n\nThe activity was supported by feature placement with a behavioural expert on the Mail Online, an O8 hidden gem cake media drop tweeted by top tier names including Jamie East and Digital Spy, and finally, blanket review coverage across all relevant media targets.\n\nImpact\n\nThe press event was attended by MTV, Global Radio, ITN, Yahoo & Culture Trip and news of the consumer event was covered online by Metro and Stylist – At its week of release, Ocean’s 8 was at the top of the DVD charts."
