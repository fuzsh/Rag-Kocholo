        "text": "Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (Warner Bros. Pictures) is an American producer of film, television, and music entertainment. Itself it is a subsidiary of Time Warner, with its headquarters in Burbank, California and New York. It’s among the major film studios of Hollywood and it has several subsidiary companies, including Warner Bros. Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Animation, Warner Home Video, New Line Cinema, TheWB.com, and DC Entertainment. Warner owns half of The CW Television Network too.\n\nWarner Bros has given us some of the earliest cartoon characters that are engrained into our minds since our childhood. Some of the famous characters includes, “Bugs Bunny”, “Daffy Duck” and “Sylvester” and “Tweety”. Even in the early years Warner Bros. brought us some of the classic Oscar winning films such as “Driving Miss Daisy”, GoodFellas” (1990), “JFK” (1991) and “Unforgiven” (1992). We may not realize it but we have watched TV or films most of your life by this institution.\n\nIt is a global leader in all forms of entertainment and their related businesses across all current and emerging media and platforms. The fully integrated, broad-based company stands at the forefront of every aspect of the entertainment industry from feature film, television and home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to DVD, digital distribution, animation, comic books, product and brand licensing, international cinemas and broadcasting.\n\nIn addition to its long-standing position as the industry’s notable creator and distributor of feature films, television programs, animation, video and DVD, Warner Bros. Studios has also become one of the foremost authorities on utilizing licensing and merchandising to grow and reinforce its brands, on pioneering new forms of distribution, and on spreading its vast creative and business resources to build world-renowned entertainment franchises.\n\nEarly Days in Warner Bros:\n\nThis all started with four brothers Albert Warner, Sam Warner, Harry Warner and Jack L. Warner when they incorporated their immature movie company on April 4 1923. In the early days of its emergence, Warner Bros. had a hard time keeping up with older studios like Paramount, MGM and First National, which already had a lot of power in their hands.\n\nWarner bros became famous with the release of the world’s first talkie which was synchronized sound feature film “The Jazz Singer”. This set Warner Bros apart and they were finally able to enter the competitive market. Even more they were also able to release the first all talking feature film “Lights Of New York(1928)” and in 1929, they were the first to release an all-color talking feature, “On with the Show”.\n\nSince those early days, Warner Bros. Studios has accumulate an impressive legacy based on world-class quality entertainment and technological foresight and created a diversified entertainment company with an unparalleled depth and breadth. Its unmatched consistency and success is built on a foundation of stable management throughout its history (especially by entertainment industry standards), long-term creative relationships with many of the world’s leading talent, and an unwavering dedication to excellence.\n\nWhere M-G-M (also a major studio) went in for bright, colorful musical films, Warner Bros preferred black & white, and gritty, realistic dramas. The studio put out numerous top notch gangster films, such as “Little Caesar,” “I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang” (1932), “The Maltese Falcon” (1941), “The Big Sleep” (1946) and “Casablanca” (1941). They also gave us such Oscar winning dramas as “The Story of Louis Pasteur” (1936), “The Life of Emile Zola” (1937), and “The Treasure of Sierra Madre” (1948).\n\nTheir success continued in the 1950’s and 60’s with hits such as “Rebel without a Cause”, “My Fair Lady” and “Bonnie and Clyde”. In the 1970’s some of their most popular productions include “Superman”, “Every Which Way but Loose Boulevard Nights”, and “Monty Python’s Life of Brian”. The 80’s brought us more Superman films and the Lethal Weapon and Police Academy films. In 1989, Warner Bros. initiated its strategy of growing a market for its films by building state-of-the-art multiplex theaters in underserved territories overseas, operating them until they are mature businesses and then moving onto new frontiers. The first of these ventures was in Australia.\n\nThe 1990s was an influential decade for the Studio, starting with the 1990 merger of Warner Communications, Inc. and Time Inc. to form Time Warner, Inc., one of the world’s largest communications and entertainment companies. Other important milestones includes the Studio’s creation and utilization of a unique film co-financing and worldwide distribution business model,secondly there was the revitalization of Warner Bros. Animation with the animated television series “Tiny Toon Adventures”, thirdly there was the opening of Warner Bros.’ first international theme park (Movie World in Australia, 1991). Warner Bros also launched the Company’s first, and the country’s fifth, national television network, The WB (1995). They also became a dominant force in the production and worldwide distribution of first-run syndicated programming with taking over of the management of the Turner library (1996).\n\nIn 2001, Warner Bros and their parent company Time Warner Inc. merged with America Online Inc. This made them the world’s foremost media and Communications Companies.\n\nRecently they have had great success with the Harry potter movie Franchises which shattered many box office records and launched a cultural phenomenon. Just last year Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 became the biggest opening of all time smashing the box office records. Slumdog Millionaire won eight Academy Awards, seven BAFTA Awards and four Golden Globes. The list of films and awards each film has one is endless. The future of Warner Bros. Studio looks bright, it seems whatever they put their hand to they succeed. There will be more box office records broken and awards won.\n\nBox Office Rates of All Times\n\nNow I will be discussing some box office rates so that I get to know about the top films that have broken the box office records. I will be starting with 1990s era because that was the time when Warner Bros made the highest records. The decade took a great start and ended up also well. They won Academy Awards and Oscars for many films such as “Good Fellas” (1990), “JFK” (1991), “Unforgiven” (1992) and “The Fugitive” (1993). The Studio’s domestic box office surpassed the $1 billion mark and for the third time in the 1990s, it passed $1 billion internationally. “The Matrix,” alone, made $460 million at the worldwide box office and broke Warner Bros. Pictures’ worldwide revenue record and creating an extraordinary new brand for the Studio.\n\nNow moving towards the 21st century, the first year 2000 brought the Studio continued success with films such as “The Perfect Storm,” “Space Cowboys” and Castle Rock’s “Miss Congeniality.”\n\nIn 2001, Warner Bros. Pictures shattered every one of its own box office records and several industry records because of the beginning of the Harry Potter phenomenon (“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”), “Ocean’s 11,” “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” “Cats & Dogs” and “Miss Congeniality.” Domestic box office reached $1.23 billion, and international box office soared to $1.34 billion. “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” holds a worldwide box office of $973.6 million, and stands as the Studio’s highest-grossing film and the industry’s third-highest grossing film of all time in worldwide box office.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” the fourth-highest grossing film internationally of all time, “Scooby-Doo,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” “Insomnia,” “A Walk to remember” and “Two Weeks’ Notice” made 2002 another record-breaking year for Warner Bros. Pictures, with box office receipts surpassing the $1 billion mark for the third time domestically and the fifth time internationally. Warner Bros. Pictures’ $1.6 billion in international receipts led all studios and was both a new record for Warner Bros. Pictures, as well as the second-highest gross ever from a major studio.\n\nWarner Bros.’ various businesses continued to be category leaders in 2003. Warner Bros. Pictures had its second-best domestic box office year in history ($1.16 billion) and its best-ever year at the international box office ($1.63 billion), making for the Studio’s most successful worldwide box office year ever. Warner Home Video was number one in overall market share, and Warner Bros. Television was the industry’s number-one supplier of television programming.\n\n2004 was a history-making year for the Studio. Warner Bros. Pictures had its most successful year ever, with $3.41 billion in worldwide box office, which included $2.19 billion in overseas receipts, marking the first time a studio crossed the $2 billion mark internationally in a single year (it was also the fifth time domestically and seventh time internationally Warner Bros. Pictures broke the billion-dollar barrier). Contributing to this success were “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” “Troy,” “Ocean’s 12” and “The Polar Express.” WBTV was again the industry’s leading supplier of programming to the six networks, and Warner Home Video finished the year as the industry’s market share leader (for the sixth time in the preceding eight years).\n\nIn 2005, “Million Dollar Baby” brought the Studio four Oscars, including “Best Picture” and “Best Director.Next “Batman Begins” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” were two of the summer’s biggest hits with more than $370 and $470 million in worldwide box office, respectively. Warner Home Video, Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures International all finished 2005 as the market share leader in their respective business categories.\n\nIn 2006, Warner Bros. Pictures’ domestic and international divisions each had their sixth consecutive billion-dollar-plus years at the box office; Warner Home Video was the industry’s market share leader and the Warner Bros. Television Group was the industry’s leading supplier of primetime series to the broadcast networks. Moving on to the next year 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures’ domestic and international divisions each had their most successful years ever, as well as their seventh consecutive billion dollar-plus years at the box office. The Studio’s domestic box office reached $1.42 billion, and overseas receipts soared to $2.24 billion, an industry record. Warner Home Video was once again the industry’s leader, with an overall 20 percent market share.\n\nIn 2008, Warner Bros. had a worldwide box office of $3.59 billion. Warner Bros. Pictures set a Studio and an industry record with $1.78 billion in domestic receipts, international box office reached $1.81 billion, and the year marked the eighth time Warner Bros. crossed the billion-dollar mark domestically and the 11th time internationally.

Warner Bros.

Internationally, WHV became the number one studio with 14 percent world market share and a 21 percent world market share among all Hollywood studios.\n\nIn 2010, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group broke the all-time industry worldwide box office record with receipts of $4.814 billion, which surpassed the prior record of $4.010 billion (set by the Studio in 2009). Warner Bros. also established a new industry benchmark for the international box office with a total of $2.93 billion (marking a record third time of crossing the $2 billion threshold) and retained its leading domestic box office ranking with receipts of $1.884 billion. 2010 also marked the 10th consecutive year Warner Bros. Pictures passed the billion dollar mark at both the domestic and international box offices. Warner Home Video was, once again, the industry’s leader, with an overall 20.6 percent market share in total DVD and Blu-ray sales.\n\nIn 2011, the Warner Bros.

Horror films often deal with viewers’ nightmares, fears, revulsions and terror of the unknown. Plots within the horror genre often involve the intrusion of an evil force, event, or personage, commonly of supernatural origin, into the everyday world. Prevalent elements include ghosts, extraterrestrials, vampires, werewolves, demons, gore, torture, vicious animals, evil witches, monsters, zombies, cannibals, and serial killers. Movies involving such type of plot lines are classified as horror films. Horror films evoke negative emotional reaction from viewers by portraying fears and phobias of audience. Some horror films might also fall into sub genres including fantasy, supernatural fiction, psychological thrillers, slasher and zombie.\n\nBelow is the list of horror films produced and/or distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nThe Walking Dead (1936): Co-produced by: Warner Bros., First National.

Distributed by: Warner Premiere.\n\nAlmost all of the films follow the same codes and conventions of typical horror films. In most of the horror films the narrative is predictable as the plot revolves around a person or his family being targeted by a supernatural being or some evil force. There is a distinction shown between good and evil and no matter what good always wins in the end. Normally the common codes and conventions are typical scenario where an evil force is disturbing a family and how they fight to eliminate that from there life. In the past, many horror films were centered on a male character. He was shown the powerful one who fights with the evil force till the end. While the female character is in need of help and unable to protect herself. In such case, film is usually seen from male point of view. However in recent years there are such films that show female dominance such as,\n\nHorror films are mostly set in isolated places such as dark streets, narrow alleyways, a house far away from the city, the woods, a ghost town, a summer camp, a dormitory during the off season, an abandoned amusement park and etc. Normally the props used to make any film horror would be knife, chainsaws, dark costumes and other weapons. Almost all the films uses low key lighting which plays an integral role in making a horror film. Also more emphasis is laid on sound of such films because audience is evoked by screams and horrific voices. The codes and conventions I discussed are present in horror films released by Warner Bros. such as The Conjuring, Friday the 13th, Annabelle, A Nightmare on the Elm Street and The Exorcist are among those who had success on box office.\n\nNo doubt, Warner Bros is a big institution and I think backing by such institution that has already provided many horror film throughout these years would benefit my film on local, national and even international levels. As it have Home Box Office as its subsidiary and Warner Bros television would help my film to be distributed even on television. Time Warner being the biggest parent company would find it a lot easier to distribute my film and provide merchandise and other marketing techniques. They also have Warner Bros Home Video Market which would help in getting my film on DVD, HD-DVD and even Blu ray disc. I think my final film would be able to cover a huge range of audience as most of the horror films by them are put up on thousands of multiplexes screens throughout the year.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/warner-bros-entertainment-inc.html\n\nhttp://www.timewarner.com/our-content/warner-bros-entertainment\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-history.html\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-overview.html\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/warner-bros-entertainment-inc.html\n\nhttps://warnerbros.com.au/movies/horror"
