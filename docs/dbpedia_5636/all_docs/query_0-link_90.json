        "text": "It looks like we’d better get ready for one more heist. A new Ocean’s 11 movie is in development and it has an excellent team behind it. The Hollywood Reporter reveals that Margot Robbie “will star and produce a new Ocean’s movie that will be helmed by Jay Roach.” Robbie and Roach previously worked together on the movie Bombshell which earned Robbie a best-supporting actress Oscar nomination. Additionally, this movie will see Barbie and Ken reunite as Ryan Gosling joins the cast.\n\nThe Ocean’s 11 prequel producer Josey McNamara of LuckyChap Entertainment noted to GamesRadar, “They’re [Robbie and Gosling] wonderful together. The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.” But otherwise, McNamara couldn’t share much about the film.\n\nWe do know that Carrie Solomon will pen the script. But otherwise have received few other details on what this Margot Robbie-led Ocean’s 11 prequel movie would look like. But The Hollywood Reporter shared “it is known to be an original Ocean’s 11 that is set in Europe in the 1960s.”\n\nA little old-school glamor for Robbie, perhaps? Though we don’t know exactly what will go down in the movie, we’re excited to see Robbie front and center. While it feels unlikely another fully woman-oriented adventure like Ocean’s Eight will come our way, we hope to see Robbie’s character very much in charge in this new movie. Ostensibly, regardless of the details, she’ll lead a new team of sarcastic criminals as they pull off impossible odds with good humor and lots of style. We can’t wait to learn who else comes on board alongside Robbie and Gosling. If there’s one thing we can count on, it’s Ocean’s movies bringing a lot of fun to the table.\n\nIn the meantime, we can go back and appreciate what we already. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling’s turn in the Barbie movie truly captivated us. If there’s anyone who can seamlessly transition from playing a famous doll to becoming a master thief, it’s Robbie. May we be so bold as to suggest an eventual crossover?\n\nOriginally published May 19, 2022."
