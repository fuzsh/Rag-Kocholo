        "text": "\"Gothika\" Starring Academy Award® Winner Halle Berry Premieres April 29\n\n\"The Last Samurai\" Starring Academy Award® Nominees Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe Premieres June 17\n\nAMC Network Premiere of \"Murder By Numbers\" on February 19\n\nNEW YORK, January 11, 2006 – AMC, the channel for movie lovers, springboards GOTHIKA and THE LAST SAMURAI, two of Warner Bros. Pictures' hot releases, for the first time on network television this Spring 2006. In addition, AMC will premiere MURDER BY NUMBERS on the channel. Starring the biggest names in Hollywood – Sandra Bullock, Halle Berry, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe – these films from Warner Bros. Pictures continue to expand AMC's movie library with highly acclaimed dramas.\n\nSchedule and description are as follows:\n\nMURDER BY NUMBERS airs Sunday, February 19 with back-to-back presentations at 8 PM and 10:30 PM ET/PT:\n\nIn this psychological suspense-thriller, SANDRA BULLOCK stars as \"Cassie Mayweather,\" a seasoned homicide detective and crime scene specialist who is assigned along with her new partner \"Sam Kennedy\" (BEN CHAPLIN) to solve the case of a young woman found dead in a ditch in the woods. Following the evidence leads the two detectives to a man named \"Richard Haywood\" (RYAN GOSLING), and his unlikely, yet secret, friend and classmate, \"Justin Pendleton\" (MICHAEL PITT). Together these young men have forged a friendship in order to commit several crimes against women. Solving this \"perfect murder\" forces \"Cassie\" to face and free herself from a tormented past she buried long ago.\n\nGOTHIKA premieres Saturday, April 29 at 8 PM ET/PT with another presentation on Sunday, April 30 at 8 PM ET/PT:\n\nA brilliant and respected criminal psychologist, \"Dr. Miranda Grey\" (HALLE BERRY) awakens from a horrific incident and is shocked to discover that her husband (CHARLES S. DUTTON) has been murdered – and the bloody evidence points directly at her. As the chief administrator of the psychiatric ward at the Woodward Penitentiary for Women, \"Miranda\" treats dangerously disturbed patients like \"Chloe\" (PENELOPE CRUZ), but soon finds herself confined to the same fate. Forced to rely on her instincts rather than facts, \"Miranda\" begins to believe that a supernatural force determined to exact revenge at the expense of her sanity has possessed her. \"Miranda\" must determine if she is being driven to madness…or closer to the truth.\n\nTHE LAST SAMURAI premieres Saturday, June 17 at 8 PM ET/PT and repeats at 8 PM ET/PT on both Sunday, June 18 and Monday, June 19:\n\n\"Captain Nathan Algren\" (TOM CRUISE), a Civil War soldier adrift, is hired to train Japan's first modern army. Meanwhile, another soldier sees his way of life about to disintegrate: He is \"Katsumoto\" (KEN WATANABE), the last leader of the venerated Samurai, who dedicated their lives to serving emperor and country. The paths of these two warriors converge when the young Emperor of Japan, wooed by American interests who covet the growing Japanese market, hires \"Algren\" to eradicate the Samurai in preparation for a more Westernized and trade-friendly government. Thrust now into harsh and unfamiliar territory, with his life and perhaps more important, his soul, in the balance, the troubled American soldier finds himself at the center of a violent and epic struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his sense of honor to guide him.\n\nAMC retains the exclusive television exhibition rights to 22 films from Warner Bros. Domestic Cable Distribution, including the network window for such mega-hits as Two Weeks Notice, Million Dollar Baby, Terminator 3, Ocean's 12, Troy and Mystic River, as well as Batman Begins. The agreement will further expand the network's movie library, while building on its strategy to serve the full spectrum of moviegoers.\n\nAbout AMC\n\nAMC, a division of Rainbow Media's Entertainment Services, which also includes WE: Women's Entertainment and IFC Companies, is a 24-hour, movie-based network, dedicated to the American movie fan.
