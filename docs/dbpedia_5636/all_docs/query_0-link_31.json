        "text": "A semi-exclusive before we fully enter the winter break (and yes, I knew the original story some time ago, but I’m admittedly bad at breaking news). As you’ve likely heard by now, George Clooney says he has a script for “Ocean’s 14” that he is excited about. That’s got the internet all excited about the prospect of the ‘Ocean franchise’ movie going forward. Great (and if you remember, Don Cheadle was actually the first to give us a hint about all this back in 2021, though some of his intel was wrong).\n\nBut let’s take a closer look at the details of everything, things sources told us months ago and are now time to unpack (it’s almost Christmas, right?). And file under hot goss if you like and take it with a pinch of salt if that makes you feel better.\n\nREAD MORE: The 100 Most Anticipated Films Of 2024\n\nFirst off, yes, Clooney loves the script; he ought to. He and his longtime Smokehouse Pictures producing partner Grant Heslov wrote it together. Heslov has produced pretty much every movie Clooney has ever starred in since 2003, and Smokehouse began in 2006. Heslov also co-wrote with Clooney “Good Night, and Good Luck,” “The Ides of March,” (also co-written with Beau Willimon based on his play), “The Monuments Men,” and “Suburbicon.”\n\nBut the rub is, who will direct? Apparently, Steven Soderbergh isn’t an option, and he doesn’t want to do it out of respect for Bernie Mac’s passing.\n\n“With Bernie Mac being gone, I don’t think any of us would want to return to that,” Soderbergh said in 2008, the same year Mac passed away. “I was done [anyway],” Soderbergh confessed at the time, noting his chance to experiment in mainstream filmmaking. “I got to play on those movies visually in a way that I don’t normally.”\n\nAnd apparently, his feelings haven’t changed on the matter, and that’s that (let’s not forget Carl Reiner has since passed, too, and the film’s legendarily beloved producer Jerry Weintraub, see below; the original eleven gang is now down to nine).\n\nWhat I’d heard at the time— before “The Flash” came out, mind you— was that Clooney was pleased with the script, wanted to make it, but was trying to convince Warner Bros. to make it.\n\nHe and Heslov did engage Soderbergh again, a while ago, to see if he was interested, and the intel suggests that he didn’t even want to read a script— politely, to keep himself out of the mix and stay faithful to his original, ‘No Mac, No, No Oceans for me,’ but gave his blessing.\n\nThis part may be a bit more of my conjecture and speculation, but this intel popped up around the time early rumors about “The Flash”/other Batman surfaced. And I can’t help but wonder if Clooney appeared in the Warner Bros.’ superhero film to appease the studio—who were debating making their script—and show the studio he’s a team player who will help them out in a pinch (and maybe, hey, while you’re at it, “greenlight my Ocean’s 14” script, right?”). Rumors already suggest that “The Flash” people had already reached out to Christian Bale and got rejected (true); Clooney undoubtedly knew this through his agents, and hey, playing nice goes far, right?\n\nSo, who will direct it? Clooney could, obviously; he’s directed several excellent movies (and is even an Oscar nominee for directing —“Good Night and Good Luck”— and a two-time Oscar nominee for writing). But Soderbergh was their initial thought, and helming an ‘Ocean’s’ film while starring in it—traditionally, they are very technically adept, challenging, and visually dazzling—might be something the actor/director may want to leave to someone else while he focuses on charming alongside Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and company—presuming they all sign on to appear in it (but it ain’t really an “Ocean’s’ film without the original gang, right?)."
