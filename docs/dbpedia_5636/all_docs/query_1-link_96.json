        "text": "Turner Classics Movies Celebrates Warner Bros.' 100th Anniversary in April\n\nOn April 4 2023 Warner Bros. turns 100 years old. Turner Classic Movies will be celebrating the studio's 100th anniversary for the entire month of April. Every single movie airing during the month was either produced or distributed by Warner Bros. What is more, TCM will not only be showing Warner Bros.' best known feature films, but a wide variety of silent movies, animated shorts, live-action shorts, documentaries, and interstitials.\n\nAs part of the celebration, TCM will be showing restorations of 10 films. These films will also be available on HBO Max. Below are the ten films, with the times they are showing (all times are Central).\n\nMonday, April 3 12:15 AM One Way Passage (1932) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster\n\nMonday, April 3 4:45 PM Helen of Troy (1956) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster\n\nMonday, April 3 7:00 PM Safe in Hell (1931) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by filmmaker Alexander Payne\n\nFriday, April 7, 9:00 PM Storm Warning (1951) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by Martin Scorsese\n\nSunday, April 9, 10:15 PM A Lion is in the Streets (1953) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by Daphne Dentz and Robyn Sklaren from the Warner Bros. Discovery Library\n\nTuesday, April 11 11:15 PM The Strawberry Blonde (1941) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by Wes Anderson\n\nFriday, April 14, 7:00PM The Land of the Pharaohs (1955) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by Martin Scorsese\n\nMonday, April 17, 7:00 PM Rio Bravo (1959) – a 4k restoration introduced by filmmaker Martin Scorsese\n\nFriday, April 21, 9:00 PM Rachel, Rachel (1968) – a Blu-ray HD Remaster introduced by filmmaker and actor Ethan Hawke\n\nWednesday, April 26, 7:00 PM East of Eden (1955) – a 4k restoration introduced by filmmakers Wes Anderson and Joanna Hogg\n\nThe movies during Turner Classic Movies' celebration of Warner Bros.' 100th anniversary are scheduled according to theme. Among the themes are The Early Years; Warner Joins a Gang (Warner Bros. was known for its gangster movies, after all); Produced by Hammer, Distributed by Warner (yes, that's right, we get Hammer films outside of October); and The Superhero Era Begins (DC Comics has been a sister company of Warner Bros. since 1969) as well as themes centred on Warner Bros.' contract players (Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, et. al.). In addition to the classic feature films and short subjects, TCM will be showing original documentaries next month, including Cinema Finds Its Voice (2023) and Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul (1993). As might be expected, classic Warner Bros. cartoons are being shown throughout the month. Over all, it looks to be a great month for Warner Bros. fans.\n\nI have to admit that I am disappointed that TCM isn't showing Stand and Deliver (1988) next month. It was produced by American Playhouse, but has been distributed by Warner Bros. since its original release. I am also disappointed that some of Warner Bros.' greatest movies are rather awkwardly scheduled. The Letter (1940) late, late at night (or early, early in the morning, if you prefer)? King's Row (1940) early Saturday morning? These movies really should be in primetime, in my humble opinion.\n\nHere are my picks of what to watch next month. I am including the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, although TCM did not provide the exact time they will air. All times are Central.\n\nSaturday, April 1:\n\n11:00 AM The Dawn Patrol (1930) 11:30 AM Vitaphone Shorts: \"Gus Arnheim and His Cocoanut Grove Orchestra\"(1927), \"Baby Rose Marie: The Child Wonder\" (1929), \"Lambchops\" (1929)\n\nSunday, April 2:\n\n12:15 AM The Jazz Singer (1927)\n\n5:30 AM Little Caesar (1931)\n\n1:00 PM High Sierra (1941)\n\n3:00 PM Key Largo (1948)\n\n\"Racketeer Rabbit\" (1943) following Key Largo\n\n7:00 PM The Public Enemy (1933)\n\n\"The Scarlet Pumpernickel\" (1950), following The Public Enemy\n\nMonday, April 3:\n\n7:45 AM The Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936)\n\n\"Big House Bunny\" (1950), before Safe in Hell at 7:00 PM\n\nTuesday, April 4:\n\n4:15 PM Smart Blonde (1937)\n\n7:00 PM 42nd Street (1933)\n\n9:00 PM Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)\n\n10:45 PM Footlight Parade (1933)\n\nWednesday, April 5:\n\n5:00 PM Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935)\n\n7:00 PM The Sea Wolf (1940)\n\nThursday, April 6:\n\n7:30 AM Our Miss Brooks (1957)\n\n\"Rabbit Hood\" (1949), right before The Adventures of Robin Hood\n\n7:00 PM The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\n9:00 PM Life with Father (1947)\n\nFriday, April 7:\n\n1:15 AM The Letter (1940)\n\n1:00 PM The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939)\n\n4:30 PM The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)\n\n\"What's Opera, Doc?\" (1957), before They Won't Forget (1937)\n\n7:00 PM They Won't Forget (1937)\n\nSaturday, April 8:\n\n7:30 AM King's Row (1940)\n\n3:00 PM The Summer of '42 (1971)\n\n7:00 PM Casablanca (1942)\n\nSunday, April 9:\n\n8:00 AM Sergeant York (1941)\n\n7:00 PM A Star is Born (1954)\n\nMonday, April 10:\n\n12:15 PM The Curse of Frankenstein (1957)\n\n1:45 PM Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1970)\n\n\"Hair Raising Hare\" (1946), in between Hammer movies\n\n3:30 PM Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1969)\n\n5:15 PM Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970)\n\n7:00 PM The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nTuesday, April 11:\n\n9:15 AM Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)\n\n5:00 PM The Great Lie (1941)\n\n7:00 PM Now, Voyager (1942)\n\n9:15 PM Dark Victory (1939)\n\n11:15 AM The Strawberry Blonde (1941)\n\nWednesday, April 12:\n\n5:15 AM Nora Prentiss (1947)\n\n10:15 AM They Made Me a Criminal (1939)\n\n7:00 PM White Heat (1951)\n\n9:30 PM Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nThursday, April 13:\n\n1:45 AM The Sea Hawk (1940)\n\n8:45 AM They Drive by Night (1940)\n\n9:15 PM Sergeant Rutledge (1960)\n\nFriday, April 14:\n\n4:30 PM A Face in the Crowd (1957)\n\n9:00 PM Mister Roberts (1955)\n\n11:15 PM Dial M for Murder (1954)\n\nSaturday, April 15:\n\n1:15 AM House of Wax (1954)\n\n4:30 AM Doctor X (1932)\n\n6:00 AM The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)\n\n8:00 AM Them!
