        "text": "There’s something magical about movies and there’s something magical about stepping on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California to see how movies are made, to see costumes from almost every Warner Bros. film and TV series lined strategically in warehouse or apart of exhibitions, as well as to gaze upon the myriad of sound stages. This is the one-hundredth year of Warner Bros. and Max has debuted a four-part documentary special that is available today to watch.\n\nThe series is narrated by actor Morgan Freeman, directed by Academy Award® and Emmy® nominated filmmaker Leslie Iwerks, and produced by Warner Bros. Unscripted Television, Warner Horizon, and Iwerks & Co. Each special is executive produced by Leslie Iwerks, Mike Darnell, Brooke Karzen, Dan Sacks and Bridgette Theriault. While, Rebecca Ratliff Cameron, Richard Burgio and Stacey Thomas-Muir serve as co-executive producers. The first two specials debut today and showed at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday evening. The last two specials will be available for streaming on June 1st.\n\nCostume design is very much a part of the documentary, which is quite fascinating. Iswerks takes viewers on a tour of the Warner Bros. costume department with Lynda Carter, seeing her restored Wonder Woman outfit.\n\nThere are over sixty interviews that detail the studio’s founding in the early 1920s by four immigrant brothers. “Through decades of creative risks and impactful storytelling, to the historic mergers of the 2000s transformed the company into a global entertainment powerhouse,” notes Warner Bros. Each episode is detailed by Warner Bros.:\n\nEpisode 1: 100 Years of Warner Bros.: The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of-\n\nFour brothers set out to build a movie studio from the ground up-while making a giant leap from silent films to \"talkies.\" As the Warners stand up to WWII Nazism, personal ambitions lead to family betrayal.\n\nEpisode 2: 100 Years of Warner Bros.: Clint, Kubrick, and Kryptonite-\n\nAfter a historic sale, Warner Bros. navigates the upheavals of the '60s and \"70s. Under a new strategist. CEO, the company enters an era of unmatched storytelling with groundbreaking projects.\n\nEpisode 3: 100 Years of Warner Bros.: Heroes, Villains and Friends-\n\nIn the 80s, a new generation helps crown Warner Bros. as a forerunner in Hollywood's blockbuster age. After a historic merger, the company becomes one of the biggest entertainment giants in the world.\n\nEpisode 4: 100 Years of Warner Bros.: Wizarding World and the Big Bang-\n\nAs the millennium brings a new era of business partnerships bookended by mergers, Warner Bros. continues to champion authentic voices while harnessing the latest technologies of the digital age.\n\nThroughout each special, icons in film, directors, actors, and executives from Lynda Carter, to Baz Luhrman, to Ron Howard, Kevin Costner, Keanu Reeves, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Oprah Winfrey, Constance Wu, and Gal Gadot- and these are just a few names- open up about the costumes, what makes Warner Bros. unique, and why the one-hundredth anniversary is important.\n\nA documentary that the whole family will love, or those who are madly in love with film, it reminds you of the line Humphrey Bogart’s character said in the 1941 classic The Maltese Falcon, where he said: “this is the stuff that dreams are made of.”"
