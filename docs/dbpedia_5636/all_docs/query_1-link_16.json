        "text": "Logo:\n\nJuly 1980-February 1981: We start out with a very big \\\\' logo (that is white with a blue \"tube\") that fills the entire screen. It then zooms back slightly. Then above the logo, the words \"WCI HOME VIDEO\" between two horizontal lines appear, followed by a much smaller \\\\' logo besides the byline \"A Warner Communications Company\". The logo fades from black after the standard FBI Warning Screen and has a more-grainy film like quality to it. The \\\\' logo is slightly bigger than on the later version of the logo.\n\nSeptember 1980-January 1986: Same as before, but now the logo is re-done with WARNER replacing WCI (in a smaller font to accompany the lengthier text), and the FBI Warning Screen now cuts directly to this logo. The \\\\' is a little smaller as well, and the film scratches are gone.\n\nTrivia: The logo is derived from Warner Cable's logo, which was used as early as 1975-76. A still version exists at the end of all of pilots of the Warner Cable game show How Do You Like Your Eggs? from 1977, which can be viewed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utdiDHpn9Jc\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\n\nVariants:\n\nA variation exists in which the now-white logo is placed on a blue-purple background. The byline is in a different typeface as well.\n\nOn Australian Warner Home Video releases of United Artists films, the \\\\' is even smaller and is shifted to the top half of the screen, and on the bottom half is the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" text. The logo is completely still this time.\n\nA Spanish version of this logo has the blue circle zoom away from the screen and each section of the \"\\\\'\" animates, larger than normal. An asterisk and the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" line appears (there is no fade in). The asterisk then refers to the phase: \"Marca Registrada de Warner Communications Inc.\".\n\nA French version of the logo has the original animation intact, but the text \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" is much smaller than normal and the byline (all in capital letters) is a bit larger. Also, both the text and byline are in a different font.\n\nFX/SFX: The \"zooming out\" of the logo, not to mention the film scratches on the WCI version.\n\nMusic/Sounds: None.\n\nMusic/Sounds/Voice-over Variants:\n\nOn the 1985 VHS of The Exorcist, the film's opening music starts to play as the logo fades out.\n\nA Canadian VHS of Casablanca has the second half of the United Artists \"Turning UA\" music playing over the logo.\n\nOn some UK tapes with previews, the logo has music and a stoic, oddly American-accented male voiceover. Before the first trailer, the announcer says \"Some other great titles from the small screen. From Warner Home Video.\" After the last one, he says \"The titles you have just seen are available on VHS and Betamax. Ask your local stockists for details. Warner...Home Video.\".\n\nOn a German Warner Video News VHS release, we can hear a wavy synth sound, accompanied with an announcer saying \"Warner Home Video präsentiert!\"\n\nAvailability: Used on VHS, Betamax, Laserdisc, and CED releases at the time. Early releases (from 1979-80) went straight from the warning screen to the movie with the Warner Bros., Orion, or First Artists logo in use at the time, and tapes that actually have this logo are long out of print. It first appeared on Bullitt, starring Steve McQueen, and would appear on all WCI releases beginning in the fall of 1980, including Every Which Way But Loose and Gilda Live.\n\nThe first WCI releases included Blazing Saddles, The Green Berets, The Wild Bunch, and Dirty Harry. Some WCI releases are also packaged in WHV packaging, with WHV labels during a short 1980 transitional period. Caddyshack, Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, Just Tell Me What You Want, and Magnum Force are a few videos known to have this variation.\n\nThe 1980-1985 variant is available on Deal of the Century, The Road Warrior (a.k.a. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior), Death Race 2000, THX-1138, The Amityville Horror, Any Which Way You Can, The Great Race, The Man With Two Brains, Gremlins, National Lampoon's Vacation, Fandango, Vision Quest, A Fistful of Dollars, the James Bond franchise up to Octopussy, the first two Police Academy movies, and the Kung Fu pilot movie. The last tape to use this logo officially was the 1986 reprint of Just Tell Me What You Want, though the logo later made a surprise appearance on the 1987 Canadian VHS of Them!, a 1991 VHS reprint of Ensign Pulver, and a 1987 reissue of Call of the Wild (1972) from MPI Home Video. It also made a surprise appearance on both the 2000 and 2002 prints of The Gumball Rally as well as a 1998 print of Night Shift.\n\nThe variant with music and the announcer was seen on the original UK VHS of Risky Business. The small text variant of the logo is seen on a 1985 French VHS release of National Lampoon's Vacation.\n\nSome tapes have the next print logo on the cover but have this logo on the tape, such as Gremlins, Vision Quest, Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment, early prints of Lost in America, Ladyhawke, and Pale Rider. Oddly enough, it and the preceding warning scroll plaster the United Artists logo but keep its original music on a Canadian VHS release of Casablanca.\n\nGerman Warner Video News releases from early 1985 include this logo, with or without the German voiceover.\n\nEditor's Note: Not a bad logo, but it doesn't leave much of an impact.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(December 1985-March 1999)\n\nNicknames: \"The Cheesy Shield\", \"CGI WB Shield\", \"Bombastic WB\", \"Primitive Shield\"\n\nLogo: Over a time-lapsed animation of clouds, the camera zooms out between the tops of some gold-colored letters and the bottom of a gold plank. The camera then zooms out and the logo turns towards us, revealing that it is the words \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\", with two lines above it and two lines below it. It then zooms out to the bottom of the screen, followed by a giant WB shield logo appearing from the top of the screen, slightly tilted to the bottom, then rotating to face us. The Warner byline fades in at the bottom of the screen. \"Sparkles\" appear and white \"reflections\" appear on the logo.\n\nBylines:\n\nDecember 1985-1990: \"A Subsidiary of Warner Bros. Inc., A Warner Communications Company\"\n\nDecember 27, 1990-March 31, 1993: \"A Subsidiary of Warner Bros. Inc., A Time Warner Company\"\n\nApril 14, 1993-February 1997: \"A Time Warner Entertainment Company\" (This byline is in a different typeface.)\n\nA version of the Time Warner Entertainment variant sometimes has the byline slightly smaller, using a font similar to the first two bylines. This was used from 1993-1997.\n\nThe Time Warner Entertainment byline faded in at the last note of the theme. The Warner Communications and Time Warner bylines faded in as the shield rotated to its final position.\n\nMost releases outside the U.S., including United Artists films such as A Fistful of Dollars, some very early releases and some domestic releases during the Time Warner merger, including Lorimar-Telepictures releases such as The Sacketts, didn't have a byline.\n\nThe bylineless version oddly shows up on an early 1990s VHS of Journey Back to Oz from UAV Corporation (perhaps it was taken from a foreign master).\n\nVariants:\n\nThere exists a rare still version of the logo, which can be found on certain Kidsongs videos and Batman Returns (though the UK release of Batman Returns used the normal bylineless logo).\n\nOn some UK rental tapes, when the logo animation is finished, the logo splits in two horizontally down the middle, then the two sides compress up and down, respectively, revealing a blue background with the yellow words \"COMING SOON\". This is seen on the rental tapes of Lost in America and Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment.\n\nThere is an extended version of the logo in which the shield remains in place for a few seconds longer before swinging towards the camera and tilting forwards as it does so. A slightly longer version of this variant exists on German Warner Video Newstapes. Stills of this extended version would later appear on Warner Bros. trailers, plastering the Warner Bros. Pictures logo.\n\nThere is yet another different cloud background. This can be seen on the home video trailers for Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, Lethal Weapon 2, Chasers, A Time to Kill, and Tin Cup. (Note: On the latter three, the logo is only seen for a split second, but on the Daffy Duck's Quackbusters and Lethal Weapon 2 trailers, the logo lasts longer, with the cloud footage starting where it ended on the regular logo). This cloud background is, in fact, additional footage from the regular version.\n\nThere is a very rare promo variant where the giant WB shield rises up from the top and rotates to face forward, then zooms out slightly. In this version, there is no company name or byline. This can be seen on a June 1989 dealer preview tape and on a promotional feature on Batman Forever for its upcoming VHS release in October 1995. A slightly extended version was seen on a promo for Clint Eastwood movies on the original VHS release of The Dead Pool, and on a promotional trailer for Black Beauty (1994) on the demo tape of said film, where the shield zooms out and disappears into the clouds. On the end of German Warner Video NewsVHS.\n\nOn Australian videos from the 1980s, the logo fades away to a different cloud background. It has \"At Home With The Hits\" in cursive and arched, with the words \"PREVIEW ATTRACTION\" sandwiched between sets of two lines. All are gold and the cloud background eases back.\n\nA black & white version can be found on B&W releases, such as VHS tapes of the TV series Maverick.\n\nOn Mexican Spanish-dubbed tapes of The Never Ending Story II: The Next Chapter and Space Jam, we see the finishing logo (with the Time Warner byline, strange for the last film), except the shield animates like the reversed promo variant.\n\nA CGI demo reel from 1997 shows a shiny version of the shield on a dark marble background. The words flip into place from the sides and center, and then the lines slide in from the sides.\n\nSometimes, in Warner Video NewsVHS releases,footage of movies appear in front of the WB shield.\n\nA very early Warner Video News variant has a dark blue-white gradient background, and a white plane that has the print logo of the time. Behind the plane is a red flashing light. Eventually, the plane reveals another plane that is yellow reading \"VERRÜCKTER ALS DEL POLIZEI ERLAUBT\". The bottom has the same thing copied and pasted. The print logo moves to the top left corner of the screen.\n\nOne trailer variant featured the white text \"Cinecom Pictures Video Presentation\" chyroned-in below the shield; this showed up on a trailer for Miles from Home, which appeared on a VHS of Stealing Home.\n\nFX/SFX: The \"time-lapse\" cloud animation and the WB shield rotating into place.Music/Sounds: A proud, bombastic synthesized rendition of the 1937 Warner Bros. fanfare, which really fits the logo. As a side note, a lusher orchestrated theme with the same notes as the HV logo was briefly used as the fanfare for the movie WB shield when it returned to usage in 1984. Silent for the still version.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn the 1990 Laserdisc of S.O.B., the logo is silent.\n\nOn German Warner Video News releases, you can hear different background music, accompanied by an announcer saying \"Warner Home Video präsentiert.\", and sometimes \"Warner Video News.\"\n\nAvailability: Common. Seen on every Warner Home Video release from the era, beginning with the 1985 clamshell release of Cheyenne Autumn. Notice that the current print logo is seen on 1996-1997 tapes, but still uses this logo, however it also still uses the commonly seen \"DIGITALLY PROCESSED\" text on the side of the packaging, so this logo is an easy find. However, certain tapes with this logo on the box and the current print logo on the label may still have the next logo. Another easy way to find this logo is to look for the WB shield on the front of the tape.\n\n1985 variant: The Warner Communications byline variant is seen on Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, The Goonies, Spies Like Us, Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird, Pee-wee's Big Adventure, The Color Purple, National Lampoon's European Vacation, Beetlejuice,The Lost Boys, Innerspace, Vision Quest, Under the Cherry Moon, Heartbreak Ridge, The Witches of Eastwick, Empire of the Sun, the first two Lethal Weapon movies, and Batman. Despite the Time Warner byline appearing on the packaging, this variant still appeared on the 1990 VHS releases of Driving Miss Daisy, Tango & Cash, Next of Kin, Gremlins 2: The New Batch and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.\n\n1990 variant: The Time Warner byline variant is a tough find, but it appeared on My Blue Heaven, Presumed Innocent, Memphis Belle, The Bonfire of the Vanities, The Rookie, The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter, GoodFellas, Defending Your Life, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Out for Justice, Rover Dangerfield, Curly Sue, Batman Returns, Lethal Weapon 3, Stay Tuned, Under Siege, and Blade Runner: The Director's Cut (only the Japanese-subtitled VHS; the American release uses the Time Warner Entertainment byline). This variant is surprisingly retained on the 1997 reissues of Curly Sue and My Blue Heaven (both of which have the next logo on the packaging and labels). This can also be found on later copies of the 1985 VHS of Gremlins and reissues of Risky Business, The Man With Two Brains and National Lampoon's Vacation (all of which come in the 1986 packaging).\n\n1993 variant: The Time Warner Entertainment byline appeared during the waning days of the logo, and appeared on Demolition Man, The Fugitive, Dennis the Menace, It Takes Two (1995 film), The Bodyguard, Batman Forever, both Ace Ventura movies, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World among others. Among the last tapes to use this logo were Eraser (pan-and-scan VHS only; the letterboxed VHS uses the next logo), Twister (both pan and scan and letterboxed VHS releases), Joe's Apartment, Tin Cup, Carpool, and the demo VHS of Bogus. This also replaces the Warner Communications variant on later copies of the 1991 VHS reissues of Beetlejuice, Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. This was also retained on a 1998 Warner Bros HITS reissue of Disclosure.\n\nWarner Home Video handled worldwide distribution of MGM product from 1991-2000; however, this logo does not appear on most MGM/UA videos from the time period. One exception are international VHS prints of Thelma and Louise, which used the bylineless version. Warner movies, however, did get previewed on MGM/UA tapes (and vice versa) on a surprisingly frequent basis, and there are plenty of previews which included this logo.\n\nThis makes a very strange appearance on the Hong Kong Tai Seng/Megastar DVD of The Protector, after the 1st Media Asia logo and before the 1984 Warner Bros. logo of the time (this is likely because it uses the U.S. version of the film, which appears to be taken from a Laserdisc source, being it has this logo on it). The logo later appeared on the Blu-ray release of the first episode of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\n\nFrom 1996-1997, this logo was used concurrently with the next. In the U.S., WHV stopped using this logo in 1997, while some countries (mainly Asian) continued until 1999. It made a strange appearance on a 2004 Telemundo broadcast of Razorback, as well as the 2009 VCD of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, likely due in both cases to using old video masters.\n\nExtended variant: This is a very rare variant, and it can be seen on a demo VHS to The Best of John Belushi and German Warner Video News VHS releases from 1987.\n\nEditor's Note: This is a home video logo both fondly remembered and noted by many for its bombastic music, animation, and cheesiness.\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(December 30, 1996-2017)\n\nNicknames: \"CGI Invisible/Visible Shield\", \"Shield of Boredom\", \"Peaceful Shield\"\n\nLogo: Against a backdrop of clouds, a clear WB shield with a wordless banner slowly fades into view. Then the words \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" are wiped onto the banner as the colors slowly appear on the shield.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Transcription: In the logo, clouds swirl in the blue sky. The letters WB appear in a golden shield: Warner Home Video.\n\nByline: From 2002-2004, the byline \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" was seen below the logo. The shield is a lot smaller in this version. Some DVD releases of VHS releases, such as Scooby-Doo, A Walk to Remember, Ocean's Eleven, Feardotcom, and The Powerpuff Girls Movie, use the regular variant, even though their VHS releases use this variant.\n\nVariants:\n\nIn 1998, like other Warner labels, a 75th Anniversary version was made. This used a smaller shield with the banner reading \"WARNER BROS.\", and featured a giant \"75\" behind it. \"YEARS ENTERTAINING THE WORLD\" is seen below with \"YEARS\" a bit bigger and in spaced-out letters. This logo is seen during the year at the beginning of home video releases before the trailers, such as Lethal Weapon 4, The Outsiders, Trojan War, and some trailers. At the end of the trailers on VHS releases, the normal variant can be seen.\n\nA rare version had a still logo in the style of the 1992 WB logo with the Warner Home Video banner replacing the Warner Bros. Pictures banner and the Time Warner Entertainment byline below that.\n\nA silent version with an already-formed shield appears at the start of the featurette Bruce Lee: In His Own Wordson the 1998 VHS of Enter the Dragon.\n\nOn a French 1999 VHS of The Iron Giant, a darker/high contrast version of the logo is seen.\n\nSome early tapes with the AOL Time Warner byline have the byline sloppily chyroned in over the standard variant; the byline's fade out is also out-of-sync with that of the video behind it in this version. This can be seen on Uprising.\n\nThere is a 4:3 version of the AOL Time Warner byline variant that is rendered with wide angle lens. It is also videotaped without the byline in place. This has also appeared without the byline on several Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo DVDs.\n\nOn all Blu-ray, HD-DVD, and the 2010- DVD releases, the sky background is zoomed in by 20%. For Blu-ray, HD-DVD, as well as 2010- fullscreen DVDs, the Warner Home Video shield is zoomed out 10% and as with the full-screen open matte version of the logo (the one used on the AOL Time Warner years but without the byline), it has not appeared on any of the 2010- DVD releases. Some Blu-ray releases from 2006-2009 have the aspect ratio in 2:35.1.\n\nFX/SFX: A simple, effective logo animation; nothing really cheesy except for the \"wiping\" on of the text.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A quiet piano tune with two ending types:\n\nA calm string theme; this is used for all VHS, Laserdisc and UMD Video releases and Stereo and Mono DVD releases. Few 5.1 DVD releases from 2000-2005 use this tune\n\nA synthesized version of the tune; all 5.1 DVDs and Blu-ray releases use this variant. The piano section pans from the left channel to the right. On NTSC releases, it is dual, though this does not occur on 4:3 DVDs (DVDs that have the \"This film has been modified...\" notice after the logo).\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nSometimes on the NTSC AOL Time Warner version, the regular string theme is in a lower pitch. This can be found on the VHS and DVD releases of Scooby-Doo, The Powerpuff Girls Movie,LeapFrog: The Talking Words Factory, Caillou: It's a Party!, Uprising, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, Analyze That, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, A Mighty Wind, Insomnia, White Oleander, Ghost Ship,Tom and Jerry: Whiskers Away!, Kangaroo Jack, Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, South Park: The Original Unaired Pilot, The Majestic, Queen Of The Damned, The Animatrix, Death to Smoochy, Dreamcatcher,and Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, as well as Space Ghost Coast to Coast: Volume One and the first Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD sets. On the screener VHS of The Replacements and Mickey Blue Eyes, several DVDs of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo which feature it in open matte, and the 1997 WarnerVision Entertainment release of The Chain (1996), which WHV distributed, the regular WHV logo is used with this same pitch.\n\nOn a 2006 TV Land airing of Night Court, the beginning of the logo uses the closing theme to the show (plastering the 1984 WBTV logo, while omitting the Starry Night Productions logo), while the rest is silent.\n\nA silent variation can be seen on the DVD copy of The Big Red One.\n\nOn the 2003 Special Edition DVD of Dennis the Menace and Caillou's Holiday Movie, the NTSC AOL Time Warner byline version has the regular tone acoustic strings.\n\nMusic/Sounds Trivia: The music was originally written by Eggchair Music.\n\nAvailability: Very common. This was used concurrently with the previous logo on 1996-1997 WHV tapes (on a side note, the print version of this logo was introduced in mid-1996, and those tapes contain the previous logo, but you should also expect the \"DIGITALLY PROCESSED\" text on the side of its packaging, so the previous logo is an easy find). As of June 2017, it is also used in conjunction with the next logo below as this is still seen on Warner Archive Blu-ray releases.\n\nThe first products to have this logo include the 1996 rental VHS release of A Time to Kill, released on December 30, 1996, the VHS of Bogus, released on February 4, 1997, and the first DVDs from Warner Bros. (one of which was A Time to Kill), released on March 26, 1997.\n\nSome of the last films to use this logo on VHS were the 2005 releases of The Aviator, Racing Stripes, and The Polar Express.\n\nSurprisingly, this logo was seen at the end of some episodes of Whose Line is It Anyway? on ABC Family, a 1990 episode of Night Court on TV Land, and certain broadcasts of the 1983 movie The Outsiders on A&E. It is possible that the episodes were ripped from DVD sources/masters, and they forgot to edit the logo out for broadcast.\n\nThe version with the AOL Time Warner byline can be found on most tapes and DVDs from 2002-2004, including The Great Dictator and the 2003 Special Edition release of Dennis the Menace. This can be found at the end of Caillou's Holiday Movie after the Cinar logo, but on TV airings of the movie, this and the Cinar logo are plastered by the Cookie Jar logo.\n\nAs for the wide angle full-screen version of the byline variant on DVD, it has been spotted on the two Leapfrog DVD releases of Math Circus and Talking Words Factory 2: Code Word Caper released by Warner. It was also included on the Warner screener DVD \"Grow With Us\".\n\nIt can also be seen on international home video releases of Warner Bros. films that are distributed internationally, such as South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut, Beowulf, and Interstellar (which are all distributed domestically by Paramount Pictures).\n\nThe AOL Time Warner variant was also spotted in the 2006 PlayArte DVD of Caillou's Holiday Movie, but in a lower quality being sourced from a poor video master.\n\nDon't expect to find this on releases from Viz Media, Lightyear Video, Warner Archive DVD releases, or the Paramount DVDs that were reprinted by Warner Home Video (which contained the print logo on the back cover and sometimes, especially in the case of Paramount, the spine). This also goes for Sesame Street DVDs that were released by the company. The same applies for most MGM video releases from 1996-2000. Some later reprints of MGM/UA Home Video releases from the early '90s used the Warner Home Video print logo on the tape label or the packaging, but all were of the Turner library and used either this logo or an MGM/UA logo (examples which used this logo include a 2000 tape of the colorized version of Arsenic and Old Lace, which had a Warner label and used the 1992 MGM/UA box, and a 1999 tape of Casablanca, which used the 1994 MGM/UA box and had a later MGM label).\n\nThe still logo with the Time Warner Entertainment byline is extremely rare and was only seen on a few trailers from 1996-1997. Examples include the \"Reel Rentals\" trailer seen on the demo VHS of Kingpin, an ad for Cats Don't Dance on the VHS releases of Shiloh and The Swan Princess: Escape from Castle Mountain, and trailers for The Spitfire Grill and Lone Star on a 1997 VHS of Extreme Measures from, ironically, Columbia TriStar Home Video (the latter three titles are from Castle Rock Entertainment, and it is possible that Warner handled sales and marketing for these titles).\n\nPBS Home Video DVD and VHS releases from 1997 to 2004 had this logo. The 1997 PBS Home Video release of Barney: Families are Special had this logo (despite using Turner packaging).\n\nOn the VeggieTales VHS's and DVDs they released, the only time it appeared was on The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's, if not, look hard for a DVD/VHS with this logo.\n\nThis is also seen at the beginning of the direct-to-video movie A Cinderella Story: If the Shoe Fits.\n\nThis was also seen on 2016 UHD 4K Blu-rays that Warner released.\n\nEditor's Note: It's a clean logo, but it isn't as popular as the previous logo. It is also worth noting that it's one of the few logos that continues to carry the word \"VIDEO\" when most companies moved on to using the term \"Home Entertainment\".\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nWarner Bros.

It was first spotted on the DVD release of The Jetsons & WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!, and the Blu-ray release of Collateral Beauty, both of which were released on the same date, and will be seen on future home media releases from the company. Again, this doesn't appear on any Viz Media and Sesame Workshop releases.\n\nEditor's Note: Although not a horrible logo, it was initially thought to be a fan-made project. When it was confirmed to be real, a lot of logo fans were disappointed with the result.\n\nHere's a video showing the history of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment:"
