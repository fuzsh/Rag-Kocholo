        "text": "https://lnkd.in/gmM7kPDx TORONTO, July 11, 2024 /CNW/ - (TSX: CGX) – Cineplex, Canada's leading entertainment and media company, reported box office revenues of $51.4 million for June 2024, representing 92% of the same month in 2023 and 90% of 2019. Inside Out 2 has led the start of the summer blockbuster season on a high note, reaching over $1.0 billion at the global box office since its release and earning a spot as one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time. Other strong contributors last month included Bad Boys: Ride or Die, The Garfield Movie and A Quiet Place: Day One which was released closer to the end of the month. A Quiet Place: Day One generated 76% of its box office from Cineplex's premium experiences. International content remains a strong contributor to Cineplex box office revenues, capturing 11.15% of the box office year to date compared to North American peers at 4.79%. So far, the top three international films for the year are Fighter, Jatt & Juliet 3 and Shinda Shinda No Papa. \"The box office is heating up as summer moviegoing has officially begun with Inside Out 2 starting things off,\" said Ellis Jacob, President and CEO, Cineplex. \"As expected, we felt the prolonged impact of the Hollywood strikes and the disruptions in content supply in the first half of the year, but these impacts are now behind us, and we feel confident about a steady content supply going forward. We are excited about highly anticipated titles in July including, Despicable Me 4 which had a strong opening and Deadpool & Wolverine, which saw pre-sales hitting record numbers and is expected to be one of the highest grossing films for the summer.\"\n\nIt’s been a while since I have posted but here we are just one week out from the kickoff of the “official” Summer Moviegoing season (which by the way, for the first time since 2007-pandemic years not withstanding -does not have a Marvel Title on the date). It is not a surprise that we enter this weekend down 21% from last year (which had about $445 million of gross from SUPER MARIO) If you factor out the MARIO effect, 23 and 24 are virtually even during the same period. That may be a “Pollyanna” view, but it also illustrates that we are just one MARIO away from closing the gap. During my studio days, we would look at our slate of films using a “portfolio” approach, meaning that we would wait and judge the entire slate not just one film. It feels like 24 should be looked at using that “portfolio” approach as well. The 4th quarter is loaded and the story for the year is far from over. There were over 50 films that showcased footage at CinemaCon Comscore, Inc. Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian puts it this way “As we stand on the cusp of the summer movie season with a 21% YTD deficit the industry can take solace in the fact that the titles on the horizon starting with THE FALL GUY look truly amazing and moviegoers will focus on the solid array of films and not the necessarily the ebb and flow of the box office. Goodwill will be a powerful currency that will be generated by the eclectic and appealing lineup of films over the 18 weeks of this all-important corridor for theatres.” Before we get to next week, there is this week and thankfully, there are a couple of solid films opening to help weather the storm. Leading the way is a film that actually was one of those pushed out of last year as CHALLENGERS is opening this week in 3,477 venues and Amazon/MGM is reporting an opening day total of $6.22 million (Including $1.9 million from Thursday). That should playout for a 3 day total of around $15 million or so which would be on the higher side of most pre-release predictions. CHALLENGERS looks to have some nice runway in front of it as well as both critics and audiences responded to the film. CHALLENGERS currently sits with an 88% fresh rating with Rotten Tomatoes and earned a B+ CinemaScore grade last night. With Zendaya as the lead (and now a bona fide star) The audience leaned heavily female (60%) and younger (75% under 35). In the runner up spot from Lionsgate and the Kingdom Story Company is UNSUNG HERO. The film took in $3.65 million on Friday (including $1.67 million from Thursday shows and advanced screenings). The film received a rare A+ CinemaScore grade from an audience that was heavily female (61%) and older (77% over 35). The film is most likely on track for an opening weekend total of around $8 million or so which have the film exceeding most pre-release projections. Lionsgate really rolled up their sleeves on this one with a heavy gross roots program that doesn’t always show up on tracking and is clearly paying dividends.\n\nAmazon Prime Video Acquires Bray Film Studios in the U.K. Amazon Prime Video - https://lnkd.in/dRnYz5RZ is acquiring Bray Film Studios in the U.K., the historic site currently used for the second season of “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.” This marks Amazon's first purchase of a physical studio in the U.K., to be used for new and ongoing TV series and feature films. In early 2022, Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios entered a long-term lease with Shepperton Studios. In the U.S., Amazon owns The Culver Studios in Culver City, California. Bray Film Studios - https://lnkd.in/dvGerdpf, located about 26 miles from central London, comprises 53,600 square feet of sound stage space, 77,400 square feet of workshops, 39,400 square feet of offices, 182,900 square feet of backlot, and 156,000 square feet of parking space. Founded by Hammer Films in 1951, Bray Studios has a rich filmmaking history, producing classics like “Dracula” before the company moved in 1966. Filmmaking resumed at Bray in 2017 with the BBC series “Bodyguard” and the Oscar-winning biopic “Rocketman.” The second season of “The Rings of Power” began filming there in October 2022. U.K. culture secretary Lisa Nandy noted the studio's historic contributions to cinema and highlighted the economic growth and job opportunities the acquisition is expected to bring to the U.K.'s creative industries. Impact and Implications: Amazon's acquisition of Bray Film Studios reflects a significant investment in the U.K.'s creative infrastructure, bolstering the country's status as a top film production destination in Europe. This move is expected to create job opportunities and support the economic growth of the region while preserving the studio's historical significance.

That's Hollywood's yo-yo distribution strategy at work, making it a bust or success at the boxoffice every other weekend. Last year's #sagaftra strikes are blamed for today's lack of big movies -- but the crisis reflects how long the AMPTP took to reach a settlement with the striking actors and writers. Meanwhile, back at the multiplexes, Universal/DreamWorks Animation's KUNG FU PANDA 4 was still number one in weekend two with $30M -- down only 48.27% -- at 4,067 theatres ($7,376), per Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian. It reportedly was produced for a modest (for animation) $85M. It's done $107.7M domestic with a global cume of $176.5M. WB/Legendary Entertainment was a close #2 with weekend three of DUNE: PART TWO with $29.1M (-37.03%) at 3,847theatres ($7,564). It's done $205.3M domestic with a worldwide cume of $494.7M. D2 reportedly cost $190M (or more) to produce, with Legendary paying most of it. Comscore estimates that the overall market for the weekend was $88.2 million, down 37% from the previous weekend and 6% from this time last year. It's a good lesson - pay your writers more, get better productions made. #dune2 #studioproduction #revenue #boxoffice #kungfu #moviereviews #universalstudios #lionsgate #mediaandentertainment #hollywoodstudios\n\nMARTIN GROVE'S HOLLYWOOD REPORT FOR 12/10/23: It was another wasted weekend at the boxoffice with no wide studio releases to tempt moviegoers from holiday shopping & partying. Somebody had to be first, but it wasn't AMC's RENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONCÉ. GKIDS captured first place with its $12.8M launch of Hayao Miyazaki's THE BOY AND THE HERON (details below), per Comscore. Meanwhile, AMC's high profile concert film plummeted five slots from first to sixth place in weekend two with $5M at 2,542 theatres ($1,967) and a domestic cume of $28.1M. Hollywood handicappers see AMC's bad news as good news for the studios, which faced potential competition from the theatre circuit if its distribution of concert films worked well enough to start attracting filmmakers with fiction movies. RENAISSANCE's 77% weekend two plunge hammered home how essential marketing & publicity are in theatrical success. It takes costly media buys & ongoing promo appearances to generate the kind of boxoffice business the studios took for granted pre-pandemic and were starting to return to when strikes by writers & actors shut Hollywood down last summer. The buzz now is whether AMC missed the opportunity to emerge as a new theatrical distributor by relying on cheap social media postings instead of spending competitively on traditional marketing to reach moviegoers? Concert films are typically front loaded with fans eager to see the stars, but by not spending big on marketing did AMC leave money on the boxoffice table? That could also apply to AMC's release of TAYLOR SWIFT: THE ERAS TOUR, which did much better than RENAISSANCE thanks to Swift's appeal to younger women. ERAS did $178.9M domestically after eight weekends, but would it have been even bigger with a full-fledged marketing push? Meanwhile, back on the chart -- GKIDS opened Studio Ghibli's PG-13 animated adventure THE BOY AND THE HERON in first place to $12.8M at 2,205 theatres ($5,821). It's GKIDS' biggest launch ever. BOY went into the weekend tracking below norm for all demos. Nonetheless, Rotten Tomatoes' critics love it with 96% and audiences are cheering at 91%. Comscore's total for all films in the domestic marketplace was $70.99M, down 27.8% from the previous weekend, but up 85% vs. this time last year. Comscore's year to date tally puts 2023 at $8.48B, up 23% from $6.89B in 2022. Next weekend will finally bring a major studio wide release with WB/Heyday Films/Village Roadshow's PG family comedy adventure WONKA opening at about 4,000 theatres. Going into the weekend, it was tracking best with women under 25 (three points above norm) and next best with women over 25 (two points above norm). Rotten Tomatoes' critics are an okay 84%, but there's no audience score yet. It got off to a strong international start this weekend with $43.2M in 37 markets, per Comscore. #movies #boxoffice #martingrove #beyonce #amc #gkids"
