        "text": "Hollywood film Industry is referred to American film industry. It has a profound effect on cinema across the world since the early 20th century. Today the Hollywood film industry is positioned across the world. Without any doubt American cinema soon became the most dominant force in an emerging industry.\n\nHollywood studio systems are the ones that are ultimately behind those big big money making films that you go and watch every summer. They have been around since the beginning, since the first motion picture was distributed across the country. The Hollywood Golden Era was when many of the studios were firmly established. They took off in the 30’s and 40’s and have built up their industry and have maintained it throughout the changing of times and technology ever since.In this day and age they are the power house production companies, not even production companies any more. They are referred to solely as studios. They are Warner Brothers, Paramount, 20th Century Fox and in a way they kind of hold their corner of the market in that there aren’t any new major studios that have emerged since the 80’s I would say definitely. I mean there were a few small ones that spring up an develop names for themselves like say DreamWorks or The Weinstein Company which aren’t even really that small but small compared to Warner Brothers and Paramount or 20th Century. They’re the ones that have really been around forever and what they do essentially is they finance all the major studio films that get released. They invest in them, they develop them, they shepherd them through production and ultimately they distribute them all over the world. Hollywood film industry always tries to target the international audience rather than just concentrating on their local audiences\n\nThey are also ultimately the ones who reap the biggest financial rewards from the success of the films and if you are making a movie within the studio system there is a great deal of money that production will more than likely receive to help insure the greatest possible product in the end. Many don’t have nearly the amount of creative freedom that you have in the independent film scene and are responsible to a committee, to a board, they have got share holders and all these different people to please and there is money to be made so it is kind of a cut throat business but they are also responsible for producing some of the best movies that we have out there and some of the worst ones and so that in a nutshell is The Hollywood Studio System.\n\nLast year the genre of my film was chick flick and the institution that I choose was Warner Bros. This yeararound the genre of my film would be Romantic or Romantic Comedy and I had to look upon a suitable institution that would cater these types of films. After looking at the different film institutions that are available I again decided on using Warner Bros for my final film because, it already have a lot of Romantic or Romantic Comedy on its credit in the past five to six years and they have been proving themselves really well in this genre.\n\nWarner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (Warner Bros. Pictures) is an American producer of film, television, and music entertainment. Itself it is a subsidiary of Time Warner, with its headquarters in Burbank, California and New York. It’s among the major film studios of Hollywood and it has several subsidiary companies, including Warner Bros. Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Animation, Warner Home Video, New Line Cinema, TheWB.com, and DC Entertainment. Warner owns half of The CW Television Network too.\n\nWe may not realise it but we have watched TV or films most of your life and of them are brought to us by this production company. They brought us some of the earliest cartoon characters such as “Bugs Bunny”, “Daffy Duck” and “Sylvester” and “Tweety” and some of the classic Oscar winning films such as “Driving Miss Daisy”, GoodFellas” (1990), “JFK” (1991) and “Unforgiven” (1992).\n\nIt is a global leader in all forms of entertainment and their related businesses across all current and emerging media and platforms. The fully integrated, broad-based company stands at the forefront of every aspect of the entertainment industry from feature film, television and home entertainment production and worldwide distribution to DVD, digital distribution, animation, comic books, product and brand licensing, international cinemas and broadcasting.\n\nIn addition to its long-standing position as the industry’s notable creator and distributor of feature films, television programs, animation, video and DVD, Warner Bros. Studios has also become one of the foremost authorities on utilizing licensing and merchandising to grow and reinforce its brands, on pioneering new forms of distribution, and on spreading its vast creative and business resources to build world-renowned entertainment franchises.\n\nEarly Days in Warner Bros:\n\nThis all started with four brothers Albert Warner, Sam Warner, Harry Warner and Jack L. Warner when they incorporated their immature movie company on April 4 1923. In the early days of its emergence, Warner Bros. had a hard time keeping up with older studios like Paramount, MGM and First National, which already had a lot of power in their hands.\n\nWarner bros became famous with the release of the world’s first talkie which was synchronized sound feature film “The Jazz Singer”. This set Warner Bros apart and they were finally able to enter the competitivemarket. Even more they were also able to release the first all talking feature film “Lights Of New York(1928)” and in 1929, they were the first to release an all-color talking feature, “On with the Show”.\n\nSince those early days, Warner Bros. Studios has accumulate an impressive legacy based on world-class quality entertainment and technological foresight and created a diversified entertainment company with an unparalleled depth and breadth. Its unmatched consistency and success is built on a foundation of stable management throughout its history (especially by entertainment industry standards), long-term creative relationships with many of the world’s leading talent, and an unwavering dedication to excellence.\n\nWhere M-G-M (also a major studio) went in for bright, colorful musical films, Warner Bros preferred black & white, and gritty, realistic dramas. The studio put out numerous top notch gangster films, such as “Little Caesar,” “I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang” (1932), “The Maltese Falcon” (1941), “The Big Sleep” (1946) and “Casablanca” (1941). They also gave us such Oscar winning dramas as “The Story of Louis Pasteur” (1936), “The Life of Emile Zola” (1937), and “The Treasure of Sierra Madre” (1948).\n\nTheir success continued in the 1950’s and 60’s with hits such as “Rebel without a Cause”, “My Fair Lady” and “Bonnie and Clyde”. In the 1970’s some of their most popular productions include “Superman”, “Every Which Way but Loose Boulevard Nights”, and “Monty Python’s Life of Brian”. The 80’s brought us more Superman films and the Lethal Weapon and Police Academy films. In 1989, Warner Bros. initiated its strategy of growing a market for its films by building state-of-the-art multiplex theaters in underserved territories overseas, operating them until they are mature businesses and then moving onto new frontiers. The first of these ventures was in Australia.\n\nThe 1990s was an influential decade for the Studio, starting with the 1990 merger of Warner Communications, Inc. and Time Inc. to form Time Warner, Inc., one of the world’s largest communications and entertainment companies. Other important milestones includes the Studio’s creation and utilization of a unique film co-financing and worldwide distribution business model,secondly there was the revitalization of Warner Bros. Animation with the animated television series “Tiny Toon Adventures”, thirdly there was the opening of Warner Bros.’ first international theme park (Movie World in Australia, 1991). Warner Bros also launched the Company’s first, and the country’s fifth, national television network, The WB (1995). They also became a dominant force in the production and worldwide distribution of first-run syndicated programming with taking over of the management of the Turner library (1996).\n\nIn 2001, Warner Bros and their parent company Time Warner Inc. merged with America Online Inc. This made them the world’s foremost media and Communications Companies.Recently they have had great success with the Harry potter movie Franchises which shattered many box office records and launched a cultural phenomenon. Just last year Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 became the biggest opening of all time smashing the box office records. Slumdog Millionaire won eight Academy Awards, seven BAFTA Awards and four Golden Globes. The list of films and awards each film has one is endless. The future of Warner Bros. Studio looks bright, it seems whatever they put their hand to they succeed. There will be more box office records broken and awards won.\n\nWarner Bros Subsidiaries\n\nWarner Bros. Home Entertainment (Wbhe):\n\nWarner Bros. Entertainment created WARNER BROS. HOME ENTERTAINMENT (WBHE) to bring together all of its businesses involved in the delivery of home entertainment content to consumers.\n\nWBHE includes Warner Home Video, Warner Bros. Digital Distribution, Warner Bros. Advanced Digital Services, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, Warner Bros. Technical Operations and Warner Bros. Anti-Piracy Operations. Based on the constantly changing ways by which consumers access entertainment product, WBHE focuses on maximizing current and next-generation distribution scenarios to make the Studio’s content available to audiences through as many channels, platforms and devices as possible.\n\nWBHE is also charged with harnessing the benefits of emerging technologies, as well as managing the risks these technologies pose to the economic value of the content. By grouping like business units and streamlining the process of delivering the Studio’s content to consumers, in the format of their choice, as conveniently as possible, WBHE helps the Studio to maintain an industry-leading and defining role in the rapidly evolving home entertainment marketplace while moving consumers’ home entertainment experiences into a new era.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Group:\n\nThe Warner Bros. Pictures group brings together the Studio’s motion picture production, marketing and distribution operations into a single entity. The Group, which includes Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures International and New Line Cinema as its sister company was formed to streamline the Studio’s film production process and bring those businesses’ organizational structures in line with Warner Bros. television and home entertainment operations.\n\nWarner Bros. Television Group:\n\nThe WARNER BROS. TELEVISION GROUP oversees and grows the entire portfolio of Warner Bros.’ television businesses, including worldwide production, traditional and digital distribution, and broadcasting. It includes Warner Bros. Television, Telepictures productions, Warner horizon television, Warner bros. Animation, Warner bros. Domestic television distribution, Warner bros. International television distribution, Warner bros. International television production, Warner bros. International branded services, Studio 2.0 and The CW television network. WBTVG is rapidly developing new business models for the evolving television landscape, as well as moving aggressively into the global expansion of local production and broadening its operations in the digital space on a number of fronts, including distribution and production.\n\nBox Office Rates of All Times\n\nNow I will be discussing some box office rates so that I get to know about the top films that have broken the box office records. I will be starting with 1990s era because that was the time when Warner Bros made the highest records. The decade took a great start and ended up also well. They won Academy Awards and Oscars for many films such as “Good Fellas” (1990), “JFK” (1991), “Unforgiven” (1992) and “The Fugitive” (1993). The Studio’s domestic box office surpassed the $1 billion mark and for the third time in the 1990s, it passed $1 billion internationally. “The Matrix,” alone, made $460 million at the worldwide box office and broke Warner Bros. Pictures’ worldwide revenue record and creating an extraordinary new brand for the Studio.\n\nNow moving towards the 21st century, the first year 2000 brought the Studio continued success with films such as “The Perfect Storm,” “Space Cowboys” and Castle Rock’s “Miss Congeniality.”\n\nIn 2001, Warner Bros. Pictures shattered every one of its own box office records and several industry records because of the beginning of the Harry Potter phenomenon (“Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”), “Ocean’s 11,” “A.I. Artificial Intelligence,” “Cats & Dogs” and “Miss Congeniality.” Domestic box office reached $1.23 billion, and international box office soared to $1.34 billion. “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” holds a worldwide box office of $973.6 million, and stands as the Studio’s highest-grossing film and the industry’s third-highest grossing film of all time in worldwide box office.\n\n“Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,” the fourth-highest grossing film internationally of all time, “Scooby-Doo,” “Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,” “Insomnia,” “A Walk to remember” and “Two Weeks’ Notice” made 2002 another record-breaking year for Warner Bros. Pictures, with box office receipts surpassing the $1 billion mark for the third time domestically and the fifth time internationally. Warner Bros. Pictures’ $1.6 billion in international receipts led all studios and was both a new record for Warner Bros. Pictures, as well as the second-highest gross ever from a major studio.\n\nWarner Bros.’ various businesses continued to be category leaders in 2003. Warner Bros. Pictures had its second-best domestic box office year in history ($1.16 billion) and its best-ever year at the international box office ($1.63 billion), making for the Studio’s most successful worldwide box office year ever. Warner Home Video was number one in overall market share, and Warner Bros. Television was the industry’s number-one supplier of television programming.\n\n2004 was a history-making year for the Studio. Warner Bros. Pictures had its most successful year ever, with $3.41 billion in worldwide box office, which included $2.19 billion in overseas receipts, marking the first time a studio crossed the $2 billion mark internationally in a single year (it was also the fifth time domestically and seventh time internationally Warner Bros. Pictures broke the billion-dollar barrier). Contributing to this success were “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,” “Troy,” “Ocean’s 12” and “The Polar Express.” WBTV was again the industry’s leading supplier of programming to the six networks, and Warner Home Video finished the year as the industry’s market share leader (for the sixth time in the preceding eight years).\n\nIn 2005, “Million Dollar Baby” brought the Studio four Oscars, including “Best Picture” and “Best Director.Next “Batman Begins” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” were two of the summer’s biggest hits with more than $370 and $470 million in worldwide box office, respectively. Warner Home Video, Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. Pictures International all finished 2005 as the market share leader in their respective business categories.\n\nIn 2006, Warner Bros. Pictures’ domestic and international divisions each had their sixth consecutive billion-dollar-plus years at the box office; Warner Home Video was the industry’s market share leader and the Warner Bros. Television Group was the industry’s leading supplier of primetime series to the broadcast networks. Moving on to the next year 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures’ domestic and international divisions each had their most successful years ever, as well as their seventh consecutive billion dollar-plus years at the box office. The Studio’s domestic box office reached $1.42 billion, and overseas receipts soared to $2.24 billion, an industry record. Warner Home Video was once again the industry’s leader, with an overall 20 percent market share.\n\nIn 2008, Warner Bros. had a worldwide box office of $3.59 billion. Warner Bros. Pictures set a Studio and an industry record with $1.78 billion in domestic receipts, international box office reached $1.81 billion, and the year marked the eighth time Warner Bros. crossed the billion-dollar mark domestically and the 11th time internationally.

Warner Bros. Pictures set a Studio and industry record with $2.13 billion in domestic receipts, international box office reached $1.88 billion, and the year marked the ninth time Warner Bros. crossed the billion-dollar mark domestically and the 12th time internationally. Warner Home Video dominated the U.S. sales categories as the number one company in a number of key categories, including total video sales (DVD and Blu-ray combined). Internationally, WHV became the number one studio with 14 percent world market share and a 21 percent world market share among all Hollywood studios.\n\nIn 2010, the Warner Bros. Pictures Group broke the all-time industry worldwide box office record with receipts of $4.814 billion, which surpassed the prior record of $4.010 billion (set by the Studio in 2009). Warner Bros. also established a new industry benchmark for the international box office with a total of $2.93 billion (marking a record third time of crossing the $2 billion threshold) and retained its leading domestic box office ranking with receipts of $1.884 billion. 2010 also marked the 10th consecutive year Warner Bros. Pictures passed the billion dollar mark at both the domestic and international box offices. Warner Home Video was, once again, the industry’s leader, with an overall 20.6 percent market share in total DVD and Blu-ray sales.\n\nIn 2011, the Warner Bros.

Romantic film can be defined as a genre wherein the plot revolves around the love between two protagonists. This genre usually has a theme that explores an issue within love, including but not limited to: love at first sight, forbidden love, love triangles, and sacrificial love. The tone of Romance film can vary greatly. Whether the end is happy or tragic, Romance film aims to evoke strong emotions in the audience.\n\nHere I will be mentioning about the Warner Bros contribution to the romantic genre and in the recent years which films belong to this genre\n\nThe films produced and or distributed by Warner Bros are as follows:\n\nGossip (2000): Co-produced with Village Roadshow Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nA Walk toremember (2002) produced by Gaylord Film, Di Novi Pictures and Pandora Cinema. Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nTwo Weeks’ Notice (2002): coproduced with Castle Rock Entertainment and Village Roadshow Entertainment. Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nElephant (2003): Studio HBO films which is a subsidiary of Warner Bros and it is distributed by Fine Line Features.\n\nWhat A Girl Wants (2003): Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nLove Doesn’t Cost Anything (2003): Studio Alcon Entertainment and Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nThe Notebook (2004): Distributed by New Line Cinema\n\nA Cinderella Story (2004): Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nLaws of Attraction (2004): Distributed and Produced by New Line Cinema.\n\nThe Sisterhood Of Travelling Pants (2005): Co-produced with Alcon Entertainment, 12thStreet Productions and Di Novi Pictures. Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nRocket Science (2007): it was distributed by HBO Films and Picturehouse.\n\nP.S I Love You (2007): studios Alcon Entertainment, Grosvenor Park Productions\n\nAnd 2S Films.\n\nAnother Cinderella Story (2008): Distributed by Warner Premiere.\n\n17 Again (2009): Co-produced with Offspring Entertainment and distributed by New Line Cinema.\n\nGoing the Distance (2010): Produced by New Line Cinema and Offspring Entertainment. Distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nValentine’s Day (2010): Produced by New Line Cinema. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and Walker Pictures\n\nCrazy Stupid Love (2011): studio Carousel Productions and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nNew Year’s Eve (2011): Produced by New Line Cinema, Wayne Rice Films and Karz Entertainment. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nAlmost all of the films follow the same codes and conventions of typical romantic films. Mostly the plot revolves around the love between two protagonists this genre usually has a theme that explores an issue within love. Romance films aims to evoke strong emotions in the audience. Normally the common codes and conventions are typical scenario where a boy meets a girl. Often the film is centered on a female character and it’s seen from her point of view. The settings and props used are flowers, hearts and wedding cake. These films are normally set in an urban environment. In the middle there is some kind of agreement or disagreement and there ways part away. The couple ultimately reunites and settles down. I will discuss this thing in more detail when I would do my genre analysis.\n\nIn the end I think Warner Bros would be great to distribute my film on local, national and even international levels. As it have Home Box Office as its subsidiary and Warner Bros television would help my film to be distributed even on television. The Warner bros also owns half of the CW television which would add extra credits on my film. Time Warner being the biggest parent company would find it a lot easier to distribute my film. They also have Warner Bros Home Video Market which would help in getting my film on DVD, HD-DVD and even Blu ray disc. I think my final film would be able to cover a huge range of audience as the most of the romantic films by them are put up on thousands of multiplexes screens.\n\nReferences:\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/divisions/warner-bros-entertainment-inc.html\n\nhttp://www.timewarner.com/our-content/warner-bros-entertainment\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-history.html\n\nhttp://www.warnerbros.com/studio/about/company-overview.html"
