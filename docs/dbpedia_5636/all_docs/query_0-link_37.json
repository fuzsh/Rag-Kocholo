However, it’s been a while since they’ve come back together, which is all about to change. When one of their own, Reuben Tishkoff builds a hotel with known casino owner Willy Banks, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally by the loathsome Banks. Banks’ attitude even goes so far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff’s misfortune when the double crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. However, Danny and his crew won’t stand for Banks and what he’s done to a friend. Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against Banks, the crew is out to pull off a major plan. One that will unfold on the night Banks’ newest hot spot opens up, when the crew is out to bankrupt one of the city’s most despised businessmen. But they’re not in this for the money, but for the revenge.\n\nTrivia & Facts:\n\n• Steven Soderbergh filmed all of Al Pacino’s scenes in three weeks.\n\n• Al Pacino was director Steven Soderbergh’s first choice for the role of Willy Bank. The film’s producer, Jerry Weintraub, a friend of Pacino’s, persuaded him to join the cast.\n\n• The film’s translation in Russia is “13 Friends of Ocean”\n\n• Al Pacino and Andy Garcia have both acted in The Godfather: Part III (1990).\n\n• Two members of Ocean’s crew, The Malloy Brothers, are named Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott Caan). This is a reference to The Godfather (1972) in which Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) guns down a character named Virgil “The Turk” Sollozzo.\n\n• Danny tells William Bank (Al Pacino), “What I want, what’s most important to me….” This was the same dialog Pacino used when speaking with Virgil “The Turk” Sollozzo in The Godfather (1972).\n\n• The fake nose Matt Damon wears is an in-joke reference to The Brothers Grimm (2005). In the latter film, director Terry Gilliam wanted the actor to wear a fake nose but the studio vetoed it.\n\n• When Reuben wakes up and speaks to Danny and Rusty, he says “I hear cars coming and going, I hear Linus crying. I think you should tell me what everyone seems to know.” This is a variation on lines spoken by Don Corleone to Tom Hagen in The Godfather (1972). In that film, “what everyone seems to know” about was the death of Sonny Corleone, played by James Caan, whose son, Scott Caan appears in this film. Andy Garcia appeared in The Godfather: Part III (1990) as the son of Sonny Corleone.\n\n• Scott Caan co-stars with Al Pacino in this film. His father, James Caan, played Sonny Corleone in The Godfather (1972), which was Pacino’s breakthrough role in Hollywood.\n\n• Rusty’s ring-tone is “Don’t You Want Me” by The Human League.\n\n• The special scent that Linus puts on his neck to seduce Abigail is noted in a title card as “The Gilroy.” This is an in-joke on Tony Gilroy who wrote the screenplays for The Bourne Identity (2002), The Bourne Supremacy (2004), and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), all starring Matt Damon, and also wrote and directed Michael Clayton (2007), which stars George Clooney and is produced by Steven Soderbergh.\n\n• Towards the end of the film, when Rusty and Danny are in the airport, they each mock each other. Rusty tells Danny to try and keep the weight off in between jobs next time. This is a reference to George Clooney, who put on extra weight for his role in Syriana (2005) and in turn injured his back doing some stunts. Danny tells Rusty, “Settle down and have a couple of kids,” which is a reference to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s relationship and children.\n\n• Matt Damon’s characters final lines in this film are “I’ll see ya when I see ya.” This was the same final phrase spoken to Damon himself by Edward Norton’s character in the movie Rounders (1998) which was also written by Brian Koppelman and David Levien.\n\n• In the scene where Virgil and Turk are evicting The V.U.P from his room, you can clearly see that Virgil is wearing a name badge reading “Jerry Weintraub.” (The film’s producer, and also the actor playing Denny Shields)\n\n• When Danny and Rusty are reminiscing about meeting Reuben, they are wandering in front of the Bellagio. The tune that is playing is Clair de Lune. This is the same tune that played at the end of Ocean’s Eleven (2001) when all the characters are standing in front of the Bellagio watching the fountains.\n\n• When discussing the blueprints of the Bank Casino, Rusty mentions that among the architects responsible for the design was Frank O. Gehry, with whom Brad Pitt has collaborated personally on several projects at Gehry’s Los Angeles studio.\n\n• Linus’s fake nose ploy is “The Brody”, a reference to actor Adrien Brody.\n\n• Release prints were delivered to theaters with the fake title ‘License to Steal’.\n\n• In The Godfather: Part II (1974), Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) is at a meeting in Havana, Cuba when Cuban Pres. Fulgencio Batista receives a solid gold telephone. In ?Ocean’s Thirteen?, Willie Bank (also played by Al Pacino) receives a solid gold cellphone obtained by Abigail Sponder from the manufacturer.\n\n• The line “You shook Sinatra’s hand” mentioned several times in the movie is a reference to Frank Sinatra who played Danny Ocean in the original Ocean’s Eleven (1960).\n\n• This is the last film that Joel Siegel reviewed for “Good Morning America” (1975).\n\n• The Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow logos at the front of the film are styled in homage to the 1970s/1980s intro animation to New York station WOR-TV’s “4 O’Clock Movie,” and the accompanying music is identical.\n\n• In the scene where Danny and Rusty reminisce about their first respective encounters with Reuben, they list the casinos on the Vegas strips where Reuben taught them to gamble and, presumably, how to perform their first cons. These casinos are the same casinos that are robbed in the original Ocean’s Eleven (1960): The Sands, Desert Inn, Flamingo, Riviera and Sahara.\n\nFrom the gallery\n\nQuotes\n\nDanny Ocean: I know how that makes me feel.
