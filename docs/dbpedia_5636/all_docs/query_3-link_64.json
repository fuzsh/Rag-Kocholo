        "text": "Warner Bros. Pictures has released its jam-packed, epic movie schedule for the year.\n\n2024 is the year of the dragon, so it makes total sense that the movie line-up is #FIRE.\n\nWith Dune: Part Two, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, and Joker: Folie Á Deux leading the queue, Warner Bros. has a big year of cinematic masterpieces ahead of it.\n\nFollowing the Footsteps of 2023\n\nIn 2023, the studio made waves with spectacular movies that hit the mark on a global scale. One of the most notable ones is Wonka, a now-beloved prequel to Roald Dahl's classic. The story continues to inspire moviegoers revisit a world of pure (chocolate) imagination, and has surpassed $500 million at the global box office in less than two months after its premiere.\n\nIf Wonka was the king of 2023, Barbiewas the queen. Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie’s homage to the classic doll painted the world pink to the tune of $1.4 billion. Oh, and it certainly pulled our heartstrings like a fiddle covered in glitter.\n\nBox Office Hits in the Making\n\nOn January 8, Encore Films, through Warner Bros. Pictures, released Studio Ghibli’s The Boy and the Heron, the first Hayao Miyazaki film to be shown on the big screen in the Philippines. The film recently won the Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature and is one of the frontrunners for the Academy Award in the same category.\n\nCheck out what else Warner Bros. Pictures has in store for 2024!\n\n1.

DUNE: PART ONE Re-Issue (February 7, select IMAX locations)\n\nA mythic and emotionally-charged hero’s journey, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides—a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding—who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people. As malevolent forces explode into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence – a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential – only those who can conquer their fear will survive.\n\n3. Tokyo Revengers 2: Bloody Halloween - Decisive Battle (February 7)\n\nThe intense battle between former friends, which poses a threat to the collapse of Tokyo Manji Gang, has finally begun. Mikey sets out to bring back Baji, who has defected to the enemy, Valhalla. Kazutora, who remains with Valhalla, aims to crush Tokyo Manji Gang and kill Mikey. The tragic past that tore apart the founding members of Tokyo Manji Gang and broke the bonds between the former comrades comes to light. Embracing their respective convictions, will Takemichi be able to prevent the worst outcome and create a brighter future? And can he once again save Hinata and the future of his friends?\n\n4. DUNE: Part 2 (February 28)\n\nDune: Part Two will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides as he unites with Chani and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family.
