        "text": "In its march to become a portal to the entire internet, Warner Brothers will begin streaming movies on Facebook to test out whether the social network's 600-plus million users will be willing to pay to stream new movies from within the social networking site's virtual walls.\n\nWarner Brothers will start the trial with The Dark Knight, the 2008 Batman movie from Christoper Nolan, and Facebook users will have to pay 30 Facebook credits (about $3) to watch the movie. To rent the movie, Facebook users in the United States have to visit the movie's Facebook page, and start watching the movie from there. The rental period lasts for 48 hours — twice the standard from other streaming services — and users can post comments and do the typical Facebook things at the same time, including updating their status.\n\nThe studio says that additional titles will be coming soon and that it was a no-brainer to start offering video streaming rentals through Facebook.\n\n\"Facebook has become a daily destination for hundreds of millions of people,\" said Thomas Gewecke, President of Warner Bros. Digital Distribution. \"Making our films available through Facebook is a natural extension of our digital distribution efforts. It gives consumers a simple, convenient way to access and enjoy our films through the world's largest social network.\"\n\nThe deal is not exclusive. The movie is available to rent from Netflix as a DVD, but it can't be streamed. (It can be streamed via Amazon and iTunes, however.)\n\nBut the possibility that Facebook could become a competitor to Netflix made the latter's stock take a hit Tuesday, dropping $12 (nearly 5.75 percent) on an up day for the broader market. Facebook's advantages include their massive user base and built-in sociality, which could encourage users to share their thoughts on a movie with friends and provide a place to discover and then pay for new movies via reviews from friends.\n\nFacebook currently lacks the device integration that Netflix has achieved. For instance, watching Netflix streaming movies on a big TV is simple for those who own game consoles, TiVos, certified Blu-ray disc players, media playing devices like Apple TV, Google TV and the Roku Box, iPhones, iPads and Android devices (sort of).\n\nIt's not clear from the announcement if a specific browser is required or whether the playback requires Flash.\n\nBut it is clear that Facebook is willing to experiment to find new ways to expand its empire by letting outsiders come inside Facebook's borders. For its part, Facebook says the new movie streaming isn't a deal with Warner Brothers -- just that it is a fairly open platform that allows experimentation.\n\nSadly, The Social Network, the hit dramatization of the founding of Facebook, was produced by Columbia Pictures so is not likely to be streaming anytime soon from Facebook, unless Columbia mimics Warner Brothers and Facebook allows it. But when or if it does, you'll know that Facebook has become strong enough to eat it critics.\n\nSee Also:\n\nFacebook Movie Makes All the Right Geek Moves\n\nNetflix Everywhere: Sorry Cable, You're History\n\nAmazon Takes On Netflix With Movie Streaming Service\n\nNetflix Streaming on iPad\n\nYouTube Movie Rentals: Today Sundance, Tomorrow the World\n\nYouTube Plans Mainstream Film Rentals ...
