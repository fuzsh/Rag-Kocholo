        "text": "Warner Bros. has officially partnered with Apple Original Films for the upcoming theatrical release of the untitled Brad Pitt Formula 1 movie. The major studio has successfully acquired the global theatrical distribution rights to the upcoming sports drama movie.\n\nSet in the world of elite motor racing, the upcoming Formula 1 movie will feature Pitt playing a veteran racecar driver who comes out of retirement to become the mentor of a younger driver. Through this opportunity, Pitt’s character will try to return to his former glory by being the newcomer’s partner on the track. This marks the Oscar winner’s latest project with Apple, who have also acquired the rights to the Oscar winner’s upcoming reunion movie with Ocean’s 11 co-star George Clooney.\n\nAhead of its streaming debut on Apple TV+, Warner Bros. will be releasing the untitled Formula 1 movie in theaters on June 27, 2025. The film will also have an exclusive two-week run in IMAX theaters, which will also begin on June 27, 2025. It is expected to make its debut in the same month as other high-profile features, including Lionsgate’s John Wick spin-off Ballerina, Universal Pictures’ live-action How to Train Your Dragon, and Sony’s long-awaited horror sequel 28 Years Later.\n\nThe Formula 1 movie is being directed by Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski from a screenplay written by Ehren Kruger. Joining Pitt are Snowfall’s Damson Idris, The Banshees of Inisherin’s Kerry Condon, The Crown’s Tobias Menzies, and Dune’s Javier Bardem. It is produced by Pitt’s production company Plan B, along with legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer."
