        "text": "Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling‘s combined star power helped power “Barbie” to $1.4 billion in worldwide ticket sales, an all-time high gross for distributor Warner Bros. The studio is clearly hoping to duplicate this success with its upcoming “Ocean’s 11” prequel movie, which is set to reunite Robbie and Gosling on the big screen. The film will be the first “Ocean’s” project since the Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett-led “Ocean’s 8” in 2018. Not much is known about the prequel other than the involvement of Robbie, Gosling, director Jay Roach and writer Carrie Solomon.\n\n“I can’t really say much,” LuckyChap Entertainment executive and “Ocean’s 11” prequel producer Josey McNamara recently told Games Radar about the project. “But I think we’re just trying to do right by the franchise. I’m excited for people to experience it when it’s ready.”\n\nWhen GamesRadar+ asked him about Gosling and Robbie’s first post-“Barbie” reunion, McNamara said he hopes it’s the first of many future Gosling-Robbie collaborations.\n\n“They’re wonderful together,” he said. “The more projects even outside of that we can have them do would be amazing.”\n\nMcNamara co-founded LuckyChap alongside Robbie, Tom Ackerley and Sophia Kerr. The company produced “Barbie” and next has Emerald Fennell’s festival hit “Saltburn” opening in theaters. LuckyChap is also backing the “Ocean’s 11” prequel.\n\nPlot details for the prequel are still being kept under wraps, but the story is expected to take place in 1960s Europe and far removed from Las Vegas, where the Rat Pack-starring original 1960 film and the George Clooney-fronted trilogy of the early 2000s were based. “Ocean’s 8” set its action in New York City.\n\nAs for “Barbie,” the comedy is still playing in theaters and is also available on digital platforms."
