        "text": "When creating a horror trailer, it is important that you advertise the company in which produced the trailer as well as the company that will distribute it across the world to cinemas. Below is the distribution sequence that represents the company in which promotes the film across the globe, without a distribution company sequence the company itself will make money but no new contacts that can use the company for individual films within the future. This question shows some of the worlds most famous distribution companies and why they are so effective as sequences as well as the largest films in which they have distributed and their worth. Then looking at our own distribution company sequence and why that is effective as a whole followed by which we would choose as a distribution company sequence for our trailer if we had the choice of all.\n\nWARNER BROS\n\nOfficially Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. but known socially as either WB, Warner Bros or Warners, this distribution company is one of the worlds biggest companies in this role within the movie system. The distribution company was founded officially 4th April 1923 and over 90 years later is still distributing some of the globs most commonly known films of all genres. Warner Bros has no specific genre and so is able to tap into all genres of film therefore resulting in the highest possible volume of revenue and after-tax profit each year. The annual revenue for Warner Bros in 2015 was $12.992 billion with an operating income also in 2015 of $1.416 as well as holding an employee number of around 8,000; Warner Bros is therefore able to operate comfortably within its budgets as well as being able to take some risks on films that smaller companies wouldn't do, after all no film is a guaranteed success. Some of the most high profile films in which Warner Brothers have distributed include...\n\n\"Batman, The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012) (a box office income of $1.085 billion)\n\n\"The Hobbit Part 1\"(2012) (a box office income of $1.021 billion)\n\n\"The Hangover\"(2009) (a box office income of $467.5 million)\n\n\"Lethal Weapon 1\"(1987) (a box office income of $120.2 million)\n\n\"Nightmare On Elm Street 1\"(1984) (a box office income of $25.5 million)\n\n\"The Lego Movie\"(2014) (a box office income of $469.2 million)\n\n\"Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets\"(2002) (a box office income of $879 million)\n\n\"The Matrix\"(1999) (a box office income of $463.5 million)\n\n\"Police Academy 1\"(1984) (a box office income of $146 million)\n\n20th CENTURY FOX\n\nUnofficially named Fox and with more official names such as 20th Century-Fox Cooperation, TCF, Fox 2000 Pictures and 20th Century Fox Pictures, 20th Century Fox has become one of the worlds biggest distribution companies globally sending some of the worlds most popular and well known movies. Founded on 31st May 1935, the last 8 decades allowed 20th Century Fox to distribute world known films and create a 2015 annual revenue of $28.98 billion while holding a 2015 operating income of $9.84 billion. With such amounts of money comes that allowance to take some risks within the choice of what film to distribute and so the company can take a risk on a film that may become something huge or even a film that may flop upon cinema release; if this were to happen the dent in profits would be minimal however. 20th Century Fox has given the public such films as...\n\n\"Deadpool\" (2016) (a box office income of $745.7 million)\n\n\"Taken 1\" (2009) (a box office income of $226.8 million)\n\n\"Rio 1\" (2011) (a box office income of $483,635 million)\n\n​\"Alien vs Predator 1\" (2004) (a box office income of $172.5 million)\n\n\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\" (2011) (a box office income of $481 million)\n\n\"Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace\" (1999) (a box office income of $1.027 billion)\n\n\"Die Hard 1\" (1988) (a box office income of $140.8)\n\n\"Night At The Museum\" (2006) (a box office income of $574.5)\n\n\"Maze Runner\" (2014) (a box office income of $348.3)\n\nSONY/COLUMBIA PICTURES\n\nColumbia Pictures Industries Inc. more officially known as Columbia pictures is one of the worlds biggest distribution companies. Acting as the middle man between both the production company and the cinemas and mass market, Columbia Pictures is one of the very best and most well known at sending films from the production line and into cinemas and onto shop shelves as well as online platforms, without such distributors as Columbia Pictures the film industry wouldn't be worth entering as there would be no specialist way of sending out finished media forms to all areas of the mass market and out to consumers. The distribution company in cooperation with Sony Pictures itself has an annual revenue in 2015 of $7.332 billion and with an operating income of $488 million, this allows for the investment in top quality films as well as ones which may be a risk, they may not pay off but if they do then the film will become beneficial to Columbia/Sony in terms of its income. Columbia Pictures has distributed some of the worlds best loved and known movies including...\n\n\"22 Jump Street\"(2014) (a box office income of $331.3 million)\n\n\"The Monuments Men\"(2014) (a box office income of $155 million)\n\n\"Salt\"(2010) (a box office income of $293.5 million)\n\n\"2012\"(2009) (a box office income of $769.7 million)\n\n\"Zombieland\"(2009) (a box office income of $102.4 million)\n\n\"White Chicks\"(2004) (a box office income of $113.1 million)\n\n\"Charlie's Angels\"(2000) (a box office income of $264.1 million)\n\n\"Spectre\"(2015) (a box office income of $880.7 million)\n\n\"Men In Black\"(1997) (a box office income of $589.4 million)\n\nWALT DISNEY\n\nWalt Disney Pictures Inc. is one of the worlds most major film distributer, developing such a reputation that it has expanded out of film and into such market elements as shops and theme parks. The Walt Disney name dates back to October 16th 1923 and over those nine plus decades had been distributing movies across the globe and into both cinema and onto shop shelves as well as other forms of media distribution. As an overall company rather than just an individual film distributor, Walt Disney pictures Inc. has a 2015 revenue of $52.46 billion and a 2015 operating income of $13.17 billion and so is able to invest in the distribution side of the company in which acts as a middle man between both the production company and the media viewing platforms such as cinema and DVD. Some of the movies in which Walt Disney Pictures Inc. have produced have become world famous and they include...\n\n\"Alice In Wonderland\"(2010)(a box office income of $1.025 billion)\n\n\"Toy Story 3\"(2010)(a box office income of $1.063 billion)\n\n\"Frozen\"(2013)(a box office income of $1.276 billion)\n\n\"Into The Woods\"(2014)(a box office income of $213.1 million)\n\n\"Bolt\"(2008)(a box office income of $310 million)\n\n\"Up\"(2009)(a box office income of $731.4 million)\n\n\"The Chronicles Of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\"(2005)(a box office income of $745 million)\n\n\"Pirates Of the Caribbean: Dead Man's chest\"(2006)(a box office income of $1.066 billion)\n\n\"102 Dalmatians\"(2000)(a box office income of $183.6 million)\n\nPLANETARY PICTURES\n\n​Within our distribution sequence, colour is used to entice audiences as well as to represent certain attributes in which the distribution company is trying to portray. Within our distribution company sequence, orange is used as it as a colour of mass light and it resonates across the world, this in turn means that our distribution company stand for that of a worldwide company that covers the world. The blue represents trust, intelligence and wisdom and combines with the face that the colour of the globes oceans are blue, it also shows a representation of a worldwide brand that is able to penetrate the globe with the media forms in which are produced for the company to distribute.\n\nThe distribution sequence consists of shots, angles and movements as the globe spins around to the right and as the various streaks of white, orange and blue light swipe across the screen. Within the sequence zoom is used to show the emphasis upon the globe before showing the globe as well as its surroundings. This therefore allows the viewing audience to see the globe and know that it is the main basis of the distribution sequence. Furthermore, the fact that the flashing and streaking light beams going across the speed carry such pace suggests that the distribution company are able send the media form with great speed across the globe to all cinemas and subsequently all shopping outlets. The movement of the fast paced beams results in the portrayal of speed and success as well as the impression that the distribution company can get the media form across the globe with great efficiency and with \"light speed\".\n\nIn terms of lighting, the distribution sequence is nearly totally high key lighting in which there is a large focus upon both the beams of colour as well as the globe, this gives the impression to the viewer that the distribution company is one of clarity and honesty rather than deception and darkness which therefore allows the viewing audience to \"trust\" the company and moreover see it as a friendly instituting. When looking at the light streaks, they resonate light and so it allows the viewer to see this as symbolism for enlightening the globe (which is also shown) with film and media forms and so the streaks are seen as transport links across the world for the media forms in which production companies make. The globe shown within the distribution company is outlined with a light source as well as the countries within it and so the viewer sees this as again a transport link and as if the distribution company is some what enlightening the worlds audiences with film.\n\nText within the distribution sequence states the name of the distribution company, Planetary Pictures. This text is bold and in a deep grey colour which allows for it to stand out amongst the blues, oranges and whites of the other elements within the distribution sequence. The text has a 3D effect upon it also to make it stand out but furthermore to creates an effect of text flying into the screen from where the viewer is and leaving into the distance as if the text is being taken by space surrounding the globe image. The text enters the screen as two individual words at separate times rather than together and so the text is shown to the viewer with enough pace to not leave the viewer waiting but not too much pace in which it becomes a struggle to read.\n\nThe location chosen for this distribution company sequence is outer space. This was chosen because it represents the importance of the distribution company, that it can get media forms such as film to all parts of the earth, and beyond. The location suggests prosperity, ambition and success to achieve worldwide recognition for the distribution company and the films in which they represent. Only the globe suggests the location of space and \"galactic\" ambitions but as an audience an image of earth as a whole is enough to realise the space theme within the distribution sequence. ​\n\nWithin the distribution sequence, positioning is used with intelligence to allow for certain representation to occur and to be viewed by the viewer in a way in which they will understand. The globe is positioned at first as a close up image to the left of the screen before becoming a long shot with the globe in the centre of the screen. This positioning of the globe allows for the audience to see the importance placed upon the globe and how the distribution company is represented as world wide. The beams of light in various different colours are positioned to strike both horizontally and vertically as well as diagonally to once more stress the importance of the distribution company being a transport link between production companies and the cinemas as well as suggesting that without the distribution companies the film industry wouldn't thrive as well as it does. The beams of light cover the screen at points to stress that the distribution company is worldwide and that it enables media forms such as film to be sent across the globe. The text is positioned within the distribution sequence to appear across the light beams initially to represent that this particular distribution company is the transport link for the film in which follows in an opening title sequence or trailer. The words Planetary Productions are in the middle of the screen once more to show emphasis as well as to let the viewer know who the distribution company in question is.\n\nSound within the distribution sequence is of great power and arrogance as if the distribution knows that they are vital in the success of a film. The soundtrack for the distribution sequence is punchy and to the point once more suggesting the importance of the distribution company as a transport link for film into cinemas and shopping outlets. As the text appears upon the screen, the tempo and volume of the soundtrack increases to show the importance but also to stress the point of the sequence, to advertise the distribution so all viewers know who got the film to the big screens."
