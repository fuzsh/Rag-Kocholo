Warner Bros Movies have given me the same feeling before and make me think about the film long after i have seen them especially like Inception and The Prestige. Another Film which really inspires me and is truly a Masterpiece in this Genre is The Shining (1980) by Warner Bros thus this is one of the reasons that pushed me towards picking Warner bros as my film institution.\n\nReferences:"
