        "text": "STACKER.COM — In 1903, four Polish-Jewish immigrant brothers—Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack—pooled their money and purchased a projector and a single film reel (\"The Great Train Robbery\"). They began showing the film in the front yard of their small-town residence, attracting huge audiences.\n\nRealizing how popular and profitable the venture could be, they took their setup on the road, touring other small Midwestern towns, and saving up to buy a brick-and-mortar theater. Twenty years and a small fortune in ticket sales later, the brothers decided they were ready to take the next step in the industry and established their own production company in 1923: Warner Brothers Classics of the Screen.\n\nToday, with the studio marking its 100-year anniversary this year, Warner Bros. has a hand in everything from film production to TV series creation, animation, comic books, and video games. The media company has produced 10,000 feature films, 2,400 TV shows, and has consistently made a profit of well over $1 billion annually, landing them a place among the Big Five American film studios. Some of their most popular titles of the last several decades include popular films like \"The Matrix,\" the \"Harry Potter\" franchise, \"Clash of the Titans,\" \"The Lego Movie,\" \"Suicide Squad,\" and the \"Dark Knight\" trilogy.\n\nStacker compiled box office data from The Numbers on all 934 Warner Bros. movies that have been theatrically distributed and ranked in the top 50 by inflation-adjusted worldwide box office. Box office numbers were adjusted for inflation according to the year of release and the Consumer Price Index as of April 2023.\n\nSome of the aforementioned popular titles (spoiler alert: every entry in the original \"Harry Potter\" series) made the list, while other inclusions might be complete shockers (there's at least one 1970s western). Read on to see how many of your favorite Warner Bros. films were major moneymakers and which ones missed the mark.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#50. Ready Player One (2018)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $696 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2018: $579.1 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $165.5 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2018: $137.7 million\n\nSteven Speilberg directed this sci-fi classic about a teenager who sets out to win a contest in a virtual world that's all but replaced society. Based on a novel of the same name by Ernest Cline, \"Ready Player One\" is filled with pop-culture easter eggs and jaw-dropping special effects. Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Lena Waithe, and Simon Pegg make up part of the all-star cast.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#49. American Sniper (2014)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $697.8 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2014: $547.3 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $446.4 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2014: $350.1 million\n\nClint Eastwood's most recent contribution to the war film genre, \"American Sniper\" tells the story of Chris Kyle, the deadliest marksman in U.S. military history. Bradley Cooper's performance as Kyle garnered him an Oscar nomination (one of six the film earned). In addition to the critical acclaim the project won, fans also praised it for its raw and real look at the way our country treats its veterans and their families.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#48. The Matrix Revolutions (2003)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $701.1 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2003: $427.3 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $228.5 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2003: $139.3 million\n\nReleased just six months after \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" \"The Matrix Revolutions\" was the final installment in the original trilogy. The film's story follows Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity as they work to defend the last human city against the machines that have taken over the world. The Wachowskis wrote and directed the project, which starred Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#47. Sherlock Holmes (2009)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $701.3 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2009: $498.4 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $294.1 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2009: $209 million\n\nRobert Downey Jr. plays London's most famous detective in this original Sherlock Holmes story. Alongside Dr. Watson (Jude Law) and his sometimes-nemesis, sometimes-friend Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), the detective must solve a mystery and stop a criminal plot that threatens to destroy his beloved city. Guy Ritchie directed the film, which earned two Academy Award nominations.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#46. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $710.5 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2003: $433.1 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $246.7 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2003: $150.4 million\n\nSet 10 years after the events of \"Terminator 2,\" \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\" features an elaborate time-travel plot and the war between two highly skilled cyborgs intent on destroying each other in order to secure their opposing visions for the future. Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the titular character. James Cameron, on the other hand, didn't return as director, instead allowing Jonathan Mostow an opportunity to take the reins.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#45. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $718.8 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2011: $535.7 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $250.7 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2011: $186.8 million\n\nThe sequel to 2009's \"Sherlock Holmes,\" \"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\" sees the primary cast reprise their roles, setting out to take down famed villain Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). Guy Ritchie also directed this installment, though his efforts on the sequel earned him far less critical acclaim compared to the original.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#44. Billy Jack (1971)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $730.5 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 1971: $98 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $730.5 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 1971: $98 million\n\nA married creative team, Tom Laughlin and Delores Taylor co-wrote and starred in \"Billy Jack,\" an independent film about a Green Beret veteran and hapkido master who protects a hippie school and its countercultural students from folks in power who would rather see them disappear. Made for just $360,000, the movie bounced through three studios before Warner Bros. finally agreed to act as its distributor. Obviously a smash hit for the studio, the film was a much bigger commercial success than its sort-of prequel, \"The Born Losers.\"\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#43. Blazing Saddles (1974)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $731.5 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 1974: $119.5 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $731.5 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 1974: $119.5 million\n\nDescribed by Roger Ebert as being \"a crazed grab-bag of a movie,\" \"Blazing Saddles\" is an almost-plotless comedy Western that sees a Black sheriff and his drunken deputy facing off against a corrupt politician aiming to destroy their town. Mel Brooks directed the Academy Award-nominated picture that stars Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder. Shockingly, the outrageous movie almost wasn't released—according to Brooks, executives at Warners Bros. thought it would be too vulgar for audiences and suggested dumping the film and taking the loss. Thankfully, they went ahead and released it, as it would go on to be the studio's highest-grossing film in the summer of 1974.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#42. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $735.4 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2005: $475.8 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $319.1 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2005: $206.5 million\n\nThe most recent adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1964 classic children's novel, this version of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is also the most commercially successful. Freddie Highmore plays the eponymous poverty-stricken, golden ticket winner who inherits the bizarre candy empire from its equally strange owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). The musical has a much darker tone than many of its predecessors, largely thanks to director Tim Burton, who's famous for his more twisted takes on classic stories.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#41. The Fugitive (1993)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $739.1 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 1993: $353.7 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $384.2 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 1993: $183.9 million\n\nAfter being wrongly accused of the murder of his wife, surgeon-turned-fugitive Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) sets out to discover her real killer while evading a team of U.S. Marshals, led by the relentless Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones). The thriller was directed by Andrew Davis and Jones' performance garnered him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The film led to a spinoff titled \"U.S. Marshals\" which saw Jones reprise his role.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#40. The Last Samurai (2003)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $749.5 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2003: $456.8 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $182.3 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2003: $111.1 million\n\nIn \"The Last Samurai,\" Tom Cruise plays a 19th-century American military officer who's hired by the Japanese emperor to modernize—and Westernize—the country's military. While knee-deep in his mission, Cruise's character becomes impressed by the samurais he's been hired to eliminate and begins to rethink his entire approach. Edward Zwick directed the lauded historical epic.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#39. The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $758.4 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 1939: $34.9 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $752.7 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 1939: $34.7 million\n\nBelieve it or not, \"The Wizard of Oz\" was classified as a box office failure when the classic musical was first released back in 1939. Its outsized budget—which went to the salaries of its many actors (led by Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton), special effects, and elaborate sets—meant that the film would have had to have been a runaway success to make a profit, and it just wasn't. It would take 20 years, and plenty of rereleases and TV airings, for it to finally make back its original allowance. While MGM originally released the film, Warner Bros. distributed the film theatrically when it was rereleased in 1998.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#38. Ocean's Eleven (2001)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $768.3 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2001: $450.7 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $312.7 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2001: $183.4 million\n\nA remake of the Rat Pack original, \"Ocean's Eleven\" introduced audiences to a new gang of attractive, larger-than-life criminal masterminds. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Elliott Gould, Scott Caan, Eddie Jemison, Don Cheadle, Qin Shaobo, and Carl Reiner all star in this film about a gang of con artists who set out to rob three Vegas casinos in one night. Steven Soderbergh directed the massive commercial hit that was so successful it inspired two sequels and an all-female spinoff.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#37. Troy (2004)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $772.1 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2004: $483.2 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $213 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2004: $133.3 million\n\nThe second Brad Pitt-led movie to make the list, \"Troy\" is an epic war drama loosely based on Homer's \"Iliad.\" Eric Bana, Sean Bean, and Orlando Bloom are also featured in the project which was praised for its incredible sets and costume design. However, not everyone was blown away by the period drama—a large portion of the audience complained that the film's lack of faithfulness to its source material left something to be desired.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#36. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $779.4 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2018: $648.5 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $191.8 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2018: $159.6 million\n\nThe second installment in the \"Fantastic Beasts\" franchise, \"The Crimes of Grindelwald\" follows the exploits of magizoologist Newt Scamander. Eddie Redmayne stars as the primary character with Johnny Depp, Jude Law, Zoë Kravitz, Ezra Miller, and plenty of other big names rounding out the cast. Although the movie received mixed reviews, and was the lowest-grossing Wizarding World installment at the time, it still managed to garner two BAFTA nominations.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#35. The Hangover Part II (2011)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $787.4 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2011: $586.8 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $341.5 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2011: $254.5 million\n\nTwo years after the Las Vegas bachelor party that almost ended in disaster, the same unlikely group of friends reunites to send another one of them off into marriage, this time in Thailand. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, and Mike Tyson all reprise their roles in the off-color comedy, which was directed by Todd Phillips. While the film managed to sell a good quantity of tickets, many fans and critics alike complained that it was far too similar to the first installment, and lacked the originality that made \"The Hangover\" such a massive hit.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#34.

In the Matt Reeves-directed installment, the titular superhero, operating more like a detective, discovers a web of corruption when attempting to track down the Riddler (Paul Dano), and is forced to team up with the morally gray Catwoman (Zoë Kravitz) to put things right. Critics declared the film one of the darkest and most psychologically thrilling chapters in the superhero's saga, praising the way it provided a more intimate portrait of the man at the heart of it all.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#33. Justice League (2017)\n\n- Inflation-adjusted worldwide box office: $807.7 million\n\n- Worldwide box office in 2017: $655.9 million\n\n- Inflation-adjusted domestic box office: $282 million\n\n- Domestic box office in 2017: $229 million\n\nInitially directed by Zack Snyder and later reworked and completed by Joss Whedon, this live-action \"Justice League\" was many years in the making. Between trying to coordinate the busy schedules of its ensemble cast (Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Ray Fisher), budget concerns, and other production delays, it seemed, at certain points, that the film would never make it to the big screen. The studio pushed the film through with Whedon's cut but in 2021, Snyder released his version to fans' delight with this story about the superhero team coming together to defend Earth against Steppenwolf and his Darkseid's conquest.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#32.

Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss star in the often-parodied Wachowskis picture.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#31.

Will Smith stars in the sci-fi action thriller, which features one of the most expensive single scenes ever filmed (amounting to at least $5 million).\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#30.

Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, Christian Slater, Alan Rickman, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are the film's main actors, and their performances sang under the direction of Kevin Reynolds. Even if you haven't seen this cult classic, you're likely familiar with its Academy Award-nominated theme song, \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" by Bryan Adams.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#28.

Case in point: Her most famous single of all time, \"I Will Always Love You\"—a cover version of the country track written by Dolly Parton—is featured in the movie.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#26.

Written by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin, produced by Steven Spielberg (among others), and directed by Jan de Bont, the movie had all the makings of a summer blockbuster. And while viewers flocked to see the fast-paced action flick (and its jaw-dropping special effects) some critics disliked it, considering it to be generic and formulaic.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#23.
