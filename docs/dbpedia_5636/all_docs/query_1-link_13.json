        "text": "IT doesn't get any more glamorous here than the premiere last May of ''The Matrix Reloaded,'' the sequel to the wildly successful 1999 hit that turned actor Keanu Reeves into a cult hero.\n\n''Oh God, turn around!'' screamed one young woman at the impossibly trim Mr. Reeves as he posed for more than 200 photographers who were lining the black carpet. Will Smith, who did his own star turn in ''Bad Boys II,'' waved at cheering fans seated six deep on metal bleachers. Even David Geffen, the billionaire and DreamWorks SKG partner, showed up, quietly slipping into the theater lobby.\n\nOf course, the Warner Brothers Entertainment chairman, Barry M. Meyer, and the president, Alan Horn, were there, too. The two took over the entertainment unit in 1999 after Terry Semel and Robert A. Daly left at the end of a successful 19-year run. Under Mr. Horn, Warner Brothers Pictures has continued to dominate Hollywood, churning out blockbusters like the Harry Potter series, ''Scooby-Doo'' and ''Ocean's Eleven.'' The division had its best year in 2001, with $1.3 billion at the domestic box office. And the past two years have been among its most profitable.\n\nBut as Mr. Horn accepted congratulations that night, some attendees remarked that two people who had played a big part in the studio's success no longer worked there: Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a longtime production executive in the film division who oversaw development of the ''Matrix'' series, and Warren Lieberfarb, a 27-year Time Warner veteran who had turned the company's DVD unit into a profit juggernaut. Their departures spoke volumes about the far-reaching changes at Warner Brothers.\n\nWarner Brothers had long been regarded as a place where the fine art of corporate back-stabbing was as prized as a good table at Spago. Division presidents rarely talked to one another, let alone shared information, and fiercely defended their turf. In fact, it wasn't enough to have a great quarterly report; your rivals in, say, distribution or marketing had to have a bad one. As a former Warner executive joked recently about how the studio operated, ''It was more 'Survivor' than 'All in the Family.' ''\n\nEven in such a milieu, Mr. di Bonaventura and Mr. Lieberfarb stood out as world-class corporate infighters, according to former AOL Time Warner executives. But the two men had been asked to leave months before the Matrix sequel's star-studded premiere.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
