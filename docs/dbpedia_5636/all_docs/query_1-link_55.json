For the 21st year in a row, it is expected to show a profit, propelled by a string of television hits like ''ER,'' ''The O.C.'' and ''Friends,'' which is a hot seller on DVD. Warner has also revitalized its DC Comics movie franchise with the summer hit ''Batman Begins.'' And later this month, it will release ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth installment of a juggernaut that has already brought in $3.7 billion.     But instead of the popping of Champagne corks, the sound you are likely to hear on the Warner lot is that of a cleaver falling. Executives have been poring over thick binders filled with next year's budget, hoping to cut hundreds of millions in studio expenses. Warner Brothers, the television and film production unit of Time Warner, is anticipating a slowdown in growth in its lucrative home video division.

Executives have been poring over thick binders filled with next year's budget, hoping to cut hundreds of millions in studio expenses. Warner Brothers, the television and film production unit of Time Warner, is anticipating a slowdown in growth in its lucrative home video division. And that, combined with rising costs and uncertainty about new forms of digital distribution, has the studio fretting about its growth prospects.\n\nOn Tuesday, Warner laid off 260 employees, or about 6 percent of its staff of 4,500 in Burbank, Calif., with more job cuts expected in its overseas offices. And the studio is starting to re-evaluate everything from when and where it markets movies to how and what it pays its stars. Indeed, Warner executives met recently with agents at Creative Artists Agency and warned that top-tier actors, directors and producers would have to be flexible on upfront fees or else movies would be harder to make.\n\nWhat makes the upheaval so remarkable is that it is happening at a studio that has long been considered one of the most stable television and movie businesses around. But the challenges facing the division, particularly its movie production unit, Warner Brothers Pictures, reflect a bleak new reality in Hollywood. Film lovers are starting to shun theaters, the threat of digital piracy is growing, and the industry is only beginning to grapple with how to deliver new content for cellphones, video games and other portable devices, like the new video iPod."
