        "meta_description": "The plan is set. The rules are clear. If all goes right for Danny Ocean's grifters, the payoff is $150 million. Divided by 11. You do the math. The skill of Academy Award winning director Steven Soderbergh combines with enough star power to light up the Las Vegas strip in this classy caper. George Clooney plays Danny, defying the odds in a split-second heist of three Vegas Casinos - all owned by a magnate (Andy Garcia) who is dating Danny's ex-wife (Julia Roberts). A fixer (Brad Pitt), a pickpocket (Matt Damon), a blackjack dealer (Bernie Mac), a flimflammer (Carl Reiner) and others in well-defined roles are with Danny. Are you in or out?

        "text": "This is a good edited version, but the entire film glorifies this robbery attempt. It says the bad guy here is the casino owner and not those who are trying to rob him. So, if you can get around that, this is a very good “gangster” film. While I did not see the original Ocean’s Eleven with some of Hollywood’s most prestigious actors of their time, Frank Sinatra etc., this remake captures your attention and does a wonderful job telling the story of Danny Ocean trying to regain the trust and love of his ex-wife. Julia Roberts’s fans might be a bit disappointed at the limited role Ms. Roberts has in this film, but she performs the part royally. She is wonderful in almost every film she does in my opinion."
