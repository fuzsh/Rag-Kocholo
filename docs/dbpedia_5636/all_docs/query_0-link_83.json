        "text": "Jerry Weintraub, producer of 'Ocean's 11,' dies\n\nHollywood producer and legendary concert promoter Jerry Weintraub, who cast a bright light over the Coachella Valley as a resident and philanthropist, died Monday in Santa Barbara.\n\nHis publicist, Paul Bloch, said the producer of blockbusters such as \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Oceans\" trilogies, died of a cardiac arrest. He was 77.\n\nWeintraub had a home in Bighorn in Palm Desert and spent a lot of time in the Coachella Valley, serving for several years on Eisenhower Medical Center's board of directors in Rancho Mirage.\n\n\"A guy like Jerry comes along 1 in 10 million,\" said Harold Matzner, Palm Springs philanthropist and owner of Spencer's restaurant, who served with Weintraub on the Eisenhower board.\n\n\"We were good friends. He helped me a lot with the film festival,\" said Matzner, who is a major sponsor and organizer of the annual Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\nBorn Jerome Charles Weintraub in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Sept. 26, 1937, to Samuel, a jeweler, and Rose, a homemaker, he was the oldest of two sons.\n\nHe grew up in the Bronx, working as an usher in a theater and as a waiter at a Catskills resort as a teenager. His career in entertainment started as a talent agent in New York City.\n\nBefore finding success with movies, Weintraub spent more than 20 years promoting concerts for some of the top musical acts in the world, including Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. He also worked with Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, John Denver and The Carpenters.\n\n\"He was a remarkable man who found success in everything he did,\" Matzner said. \"He was extremely well liked all over the entertainment world.\"\n\nBob Alexander, president of the Palm Springs Walk of Stars, went to work with Weintraub's promotions partner when Weintraub turned his focus to movies.\n\nHe recalled that Weintraub called Presley's manager, Col. Tom Parker, daily for a solid year trying to get signed on as his promoter.\n\n\"At the end of a year, Parker told (Weintraub) to bring him $1 million in cash in a suitcase and 'we will sit and talk' in Vegas.' He got that money overnight,\" Alexander said.\n\n\"At the end of the first concert, which was a sellout, Parker took all the cash from the box office and dumped it on a table. With his cane, he cut the pile of money in half and slid half to Jerry and took the other half for himself,\" Alexander said.\n\n\"There are many, many, many fascinating stories about Jerry. He was a larger-than-life personality,\" Alexander said.\n\nWeintraub went on to produce several high-profile television specials and Broadway shows and was ultimately named chairman and CEO of United Artists. He later left UA to form the Weintraub Entertainment Group, then founded Jerry Weintraub Production, based at Warner Bros., Bloch said.\n\nHis productions garnered numerous awards, including 11 Emmys for \"Behind the Candelabra,\" the story of entertainer and showman Liberace, produced for HBO. The 2013 biopic also received a Golden Globe award for Best Picture.\n\nLocally, Weintraub not only gave his time to Eisenhower's board of directors but donated to the hospital and other charities as well, Matzner said.\n\n\"Eisenhower Medical Center has lost a valued friend and trustee with the death of Jerry Weintraub,\" president and CEO G. Aubrey Serfling said in a statement. \"Jerry was one-of-a-kind and will long be remembered by our community for his philanthropy. Our thoughts go out to his family today.\"\n\nWeintraub's first local home was in Palm Springs. He then lived at Morningside in Rancho Mirage and finally at Bighorn.\n\nIn March, Weintraub opened his home to an evening honoring Bighorn Golf Club founder and philanthropist R.D. Hubbard, hosted by Eisenhower Medical Center.\n\n\"He was a dear friend and a great member of Bighorn who will be missed around the world,\" Hubbard said Monday.\n\nAs news spread of Weintraub's passing, Hollywood celebrities, including good friend George Clooney, began expressing their condolences.\n\n\"In the coming days, there will be tributes about our friend Jerry Weintraub. We'll laugh at his great stories, and applaud his accomplishments. And in the years to come, the stories and accomplishments will get better with age, just as Jerry would have wanted it. But not today. Today our friend died. To his family and friends, Amal and I send our love. And to those who didn't know him, we send our deepest sympathy. You would have loved him,\" said Clooney, one of the stars of the \"Oceans\" movies.\n\nRalph Macchio, star of \"The Karate Kid\" films, tweeted out: \"So sad at loss of Jerry Weintraub, you were 1 of a kind, my friend. Last of a breed. So glad I got to be 'that kid'.\"\n\nNancy Sinatra, Frank Sinatra's daughter, also took to Twitter where she posted a selfie she took of her and Weintraub riding The Buzz together when they were among a number of celebrities who rode the trolley when it debuted in December.\n\n\"Jerry, #JerryWeintraub, I thought you would live forever. I can't express my sadness. I'll always love you,\" Sinatra wrote.\n\nWeintraub is survived by his wife Jane Morgan Weintraub and his longtime companion Susan Ekins; his four children, Michael, Julie, Jamie and Jody; grandchildren, Sarah, Rachael, Joseph, Ari and Samuel; and his brother, Melvyn Weintraub.\n\nFuneral services will be private, with a memorial service to be announced, Bloch said.\n\nDesert Sun reporter Bruce Fessier contributed to this story.\n\nJerry Weintraub on ...\n\nIn a December 2007 interview with The Desert Sun, Weintraub shared these thoughts:\n\nGreatest honor: \"The hand and footprints at Grauman's Chinese (Theatre in Hollywood). That was a big deal to me because no other producer ever had it. That one made me cry.\"\n\nBig regret: \"The one film I really felt that I failed with that should have been much better was 'The Avengers.' It just wasn't right. I couldn't get it. I tried and tried. I'd like to try it again, actually. But I made money with it.\"\n\nNext project: \"I'm going to make 'Tarzan.' I've got a script that John Collee wrote and it is brilliant. Guillermo del Toro, who did \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" is going to direct. But it's a story. It's about a great love affair between Tarzan and Jane.\"\n\nWho he admires: \"I just spent a week with Bono in the south of France. Here's a guy I think is hugely talented as an artist who has given of himself and made a difference in the world. He's going to make a bigger difference. He deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. If I can do anything to help him get it, I'm going to help him.\""
