        "text": "With plenty of high-quality flicks to satisfy your viewing needs, finding the best movies on Stan is no mean feat. Sure, there are plenty of good movies on Stan, but to find crème de la crème, you need to do some research. And that’s what we’re here for. You’re welcome. Diving deep into the top new movies on Stan, along with some classics that might have evaded your eyeballs, we’ve rounded up the best movies on Stan a monthly subscription can buy. Cancel all your plans for the week ahead people, you’re gonna need hours to get through these epic films.\n\nBest new movies on Stan\n\nLooking for new movies and titles on Stan released in the last few years? There’s always plenty of good stuff coming up, whether it’s original Aussie series or films and TV shows fast-tracked from the US. To keep up to date on everything coming to Stan this month, check out our guide.\n\n1. Minari (2020)\n\nUp first in our new movies on Stan is Minari, which translates to “water celery” and is a 2020 American drama written and directed by Lee Isaac Chung. Starring Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, and Alan Kim, Minari is a semi-autobiographical take on Chung’s upbringing and his life as a South Korean immigrant trying to make it in the United States in the 1980s.\n\nOn the outside, Minari is a tough and slightly tragic tale of assimilation but at its core, the film is a stunning encapsulation of the human spirit. Writer-director Lee Isaac Chung based it on his childhood spent on a farm in Arkansas. Steven Yeun’s performance as Jacob, a Korean newcomer to the United States in the Reagan era, is utterly captivating. His stoicism and optimism is challenged by a culture that seemingly doesn’t want him, but his perseverance is infectious. Minari will break you but in the best way possible.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.4\n\nStarring: Steven Yeun, Yeri Han, Alan Kim\n\nDirector: Lee Isaac Chung\n\nRelease date: 12 February 2021 (USA)\n\nDirector: Lee Isaac Chung\n\nScreenplay: Lee Isaac Chung\n\nProduction company: Plan B Entertainment\n\n2. Transfusion\n\nA new Australian film on Stan, Transfusion stars everyone’s favourite Avatar, Sam Worthington. It follows Worthington’s Ryan Logan, a former Special Forces operative, who is battling to cope with life after the loss of his wife. Unfortunately, he is thrust into the criminal underworld to keep his only son.\n\nWhile the plot strays towards the generic and Worthington isn’t exactly renowned for his acting chops, Transfusion‘s premise is an interesting one and Worthington’s cold and calculated character plays perfectly into his abilities, so it’s hard to not to feel sympathetic for the tortured soul (Worthington’s character that is, not Worthington himself).\n\nRelease date: 5 January 2023 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Matthew Nable\n\nCast: Sam Worthington, Matt Nable, Phoebe Tonkin, Edward Carmody\n\n3. City of Lies (2021)\n\nBased on a true story with some fictional elements, LAPD detective Russell Poole has spent years trying to solve his biggest case – the murders of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur. After two decades, however, he still hasn’t cracked the case. Enter Jack Jackson, a reporter dying to save his career, who’s on a mission to get to the truth.\n\nIMDB rating: 6.4\n\nStarring: Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, Toby Huss\n\nDirector: Brad Furman\n\nRelease date: 19 March 2021 (USA)\n\nDirector: Brad Furman\n\nBox office: USD$2.8 million\n\nDistributed by: Saban Capital Group\n\nMusic by: Chris Hajian\n\nProducers: Miriam Segal, Stuart Manashil, Paul M. Brennan\n\n4. Nitram (2021)\n\nNitram is a harrowing semi-fictional recount of the events leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, in which Martin Bryant killed 35 innocent people. The film is an attempt to understand why and how one of the most horrible moments in Australia’s history occurred.\n\nA harrowing story of isolation, Nitram is driven by lead actor Caleb Landry Jones, who earned best actor accolades at the 2021 Cannes film festival. His superb performance provides insight into the mind of Australia’s deadliest killer, but for all the story’s violence, we never see Bryant’s crimes on-screen. The devastation he wreaks is kept in the dark and left to our memories to decipher. A tragic story and must-watch for all Aussies.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.2\n\nStarring: Caleb Landry Jones, Judy Davis, Anthony LaPaglia\n\nDirector: Justin Kurzel\n\nInitial release: 16 July 2021\n\nDirector: Justin Kurzel\n\nScreenplay: Shaun Grant\n\nDistributed by: Madman Entertainment\n\n5. Goodfellas (1990)\n\nWith an all-star cast of De Niro, Liotta and Pesci and directed by none other than Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas is undeniably one of the best movies on Stan. It follows the story of Henry Hill and his life in the mob, covering his relationship with his wife and his mob partners doing life in an Italian-American crime syndicate.\n\nFrom mob wives and double-crosses to endless bickering between ‘Made Men’ and their lower-level lackeys, Goodfellas does more than a good job of ticking off every mobster movie trope in rapid succession. Throughout the film, we see Henry slowly traverse the different levels of Mafia life, making friends with don Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino), Jimmy the Gent (Robert de Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). The film follows the gang over the course of 30 years, firstly making their way in the world of crime before slip-ups derail their plans, and then again on the inevitable rise to the top.\n\nHowever, all is not hunky dory. When the trio accidentally kill rival gangster Billy Batts, the thread that binds the family together begins to unravel. With the Feds closing in and time not on Henry’s side, the jig runs dangerously close to being up.\n\nAs far as mobster movies go, Goodfellas is right up there with The Godfather Part II. A tragic story of greed unpinned by traditional values and family honour, the story arc is as rich as the tomato sauce we see splashed across the screen at several points.\n\nWant to learn more about how Martin Scorsese made Goodfellas? Check out out full guide here.\n\nIMDB rating: 8.7\n\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nRelease date: 18 October 1990 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nAdapted from: Wiseguy\n\nDistributed by: Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nBox office: $47.1 million\n\n6. I, Tonya (2017)\n\nAussie star Margot Robbie stars as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya, which is based on the unbelievable life of the disgraced American figure skater. Tonya was the first American woman to complete a triple axle in competition, but her legacy has been defined by her infamous attack on fellow Olympic competitor Nancy Kerrigan. While we know the story of Harding well, the famed figure skater who essentially tried to put a hit out on her countrywoman, this film takes a strangely sympathetic approach.\n\n“Director Craig Gillespie pulls off what would seem to be an impossible high-wire act: He’s made a movie that’s affectionately mocking—of this theatrical sport, of the idiots who surrounded Harding, of this hideous moment in fashion and pop culture—without actually mocking Harding herself,” film critic Roger Ebert wrote about I, Tonya. “It’s GoodFellas on ice—darkly comic and often just plain dark, but always breathtakingly alive. Despite the colourful glitz and cheese of the figure-skating setting, “I, Tonya” has an unmistakably tumultuous air from the very start. And at the centre of the storm is Margot Robbie in the performance of a lifetime as Harding.”\n\nIMDB rating: 7.5\n\nStarring: Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney\n\nDirector: Craig Gillespie\n\nRelease date: 25 January 2018 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Craig Gillespie\n\nBox office: USD$53.9 million\n\nScreenplay: Steven Rogers\n\n7. Chinatown (1974)\n\nLove a good crime drama? Get across Chinatown, starring Jack Nicholson as L.A. private eye J.J Gittes who’s hired to investigate the suspicious activities of Evelyn Mulwray’s husband. What J.J believes is a routine infidelity case soon becomes complicated when he meets the real Mrs Mulwray. Caught in a web of deceit and sinister family secrets, this Stan movie will keep you on the edge of your sofa.\n\nWhile Nicholson was already on the rise, courtesy of his performances in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown was the true beginning of a decades-long run at the top for old Jack. His stunning take on the complex and deeply unlucky private investigator earned him his fourth Oscar nomination and took his star to new heights. Even now, almost 50 years since it was released, Chinatown is an incredible piece of cinema that truly holds up.\n\nIMDB rating: 8.2\n\nStarring: Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nRelease date: 14 February 1975 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nBox office: USD$29.2 million\n\nScreenplay: Roman Polanski, Robert Towne\n\nProducers: Robert Evans, C. O. Erickson\n\n8. Inglourious Basterds (2009)\n\nA classic Tarantino movie through and through, Inglourious Basterds is set in the first year of Germany’s occupation of France. It follows the story of Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) who assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis. Both horrifying and comedic, this movie is a must-watch.\n\nAs Roger Ebert wrote after watching it at the premiere back in 2009, “After I saw Inglourious Basterds at Cannes, although I was writing a daily blog, I resisted giving an immediate opinion about it. I knew Tarantino had made a considerable film, but I wanted it to settle, and to see it again. I’m glad I did. Like a lot of real movies, you relish it more the next time.”\n\nIMDB rating: 8.3\n\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Diane Kruger, Eli Roth\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nRelease date: 3 August 2009 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\n\nAdapted from: The Inglorious Bastards\n\nBox office: $321.5 million\n\nProduced by: Lawrence Bender\n\nDistributed by: Universal Pictures Home Entertainment, Universal Pictures, The Weinstein Company\n\n9. Nightcrawler (2014)\n\nJake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job of portraying Los Angeles denizen Louis Bloom who gets by through scavenging and petty theft. With a chance at a new career, Bloom takes to the streets of L.A. with a camcorder and police scanner in an attempt to capture footage of grisly crimes he can then sell to local TV stations. His unnerving intensity sees him first to the scene at a number of murders, shooting incredible footage and selling it off to whichever newsroom is willing to be the highest price. It’s a tough job and not for the faint of heart, but Gyllenhaal’s Bloom appears nigh-on heartless.\n\nAs the New Yorker’s Anthony Lane wrote, “The movie is quite something, and, despite its title, it doesn’t really crawl. It scuttles ahead, wide-eyed, antennae waving, on a journey to the end of the night, and toward a future when nothing will not be shown. Don’t look now, it tells us. So we do.”\n\nIn a movie that’s all about catching “the money shot”, fans of Gyllenhaal will love him in Nightcrawler.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.8\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, Bill Paxton\n\nDirector: Dan Gilroy\n\nRelease date: 31 October 2014 (USA)\n\nDirector: Dan Gilroy\n\nScreenplay: Dan Gilroy\n\nBox office: USD$38.7 million\n\nBudget: USD$8.5 million\n\n10. The Departed (2006)\n\nWith a very respectable 8.5/10 on IMDB, The Departed features an all-star cast with Leonardo DiCaprio at the helm starring as a South Boston cop who goes undercover to infiltrate the organisation of gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). As DiCaprio’s Billy Costigan gains Frank’s trust, career criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) simultaneously infiltrates the police department and soon enough both teams discover they have a mole in their midst.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter‘s Kirk Honeycutt described DiCaprio’s performance as one of the most mature of his career, adding that he brought “a level of emotional intensity and maturity missing so far in his adult roles”.\n\n“His Billy has a tough soul, but the inner core is about to crack and the fissures are becoming too evident. Damon is a walking contradiction: He looks and acts more like a cop than anyone else in the movie, yet he’s a phony. Damon doesn’t let us inside his character the way DiCaprio does; instead his Colin buries emotions in a place he discovered so many years ago in Frank’s service.”\n\nIMDB rating: 8.5\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nRelease date: 6 October 2006 (USA)\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nAdapted from: Infernal Affairs\n\nBox office: USD$291.5 million\n\nBudget: USD$90 million\n\nBest action and sci-fi movies on Stan\n\nAction-packed flicks and sci-fi epics are the order of the day on Stan Australia. The streamer has put a lot of time and effort into creating a catalogue of hits that pull no punches. Here are the best ones we’ve found, but if you’re looking to broaden your horizons, why not check out our guide to the best action movies of all time or the best sci-fi flicks of the 21st century?\n\n11. Blade Runner: 2049 (2017)\n\nThere’s no better Stan movie in the action and sci-fi realm than Blade Runner: 2049. Ryan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new blade runner for the LAPD who uncovers secrets that’ll send what’s left of society into utter chaos. His journey leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford from the original Blade Runner movie) who’s been missing for 30 years.\n\nAs far as sequels go, Blade Runner: 2049 is one of the best to hit cinemas. Director Denis Villeneuve has somehow managed to tackle Ridley Scott’s revered sci-fi classic without ruining the lore surrounding Deckard and his past adventures. It’s breathtakingly shot, expertly choreographed and brilliantly written. Blade Runner: 2049 could very well be better than the OG.\n\nIMDB rating: 8\n\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nRelease date: 5 October 2017 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nBox office: USD$259.3 million\n\nCinematography: Roger Deakins\n\nArt directors: Paul Inglis, Lydia Fry, Stefan Speth, Tibor Lázár, Gergely Rieger, Bence Erdelyi, David Doran\n\nMusic composed by: Hans Zimmer, Benjamin Wallfisch, Ron Bartlett, Michael Hodges\n\n12. The Matrix (1999)\n\nA true classic and not just a good movie on Stan, but one of the best of all time – The Matrix depicts a dystopian future where humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality. It has twists and turns, features Keanu Reeves at his finest, and has also spawned three subsequent films. It’s a cult-fave, and for good reason.\n\nMore recently, we sat down with Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss to chat about The Matrix and the subsequent sequels that have since been released. In our chat, we found out just how crazy some of the stunts were and why Keanu will never stop being the best guy ever. For that reason alone, it’s worth rewatching this stone-cold classic.\n\nIMDB rating: 8.7\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss\n\nDirectors: Lana Wachowski, Lilly Wachowski\n\nRelease date: 8 April 1999 (Australia)\n\nDirectors: Lana Wachowski, Lilly Wachowski\n\nBox office: USD$467.2 million\n\nProduction companies: Village Roadshow Pictures, Warner Bros.

After his wife suddenly dies, a sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John’s prized car and kill the puppy that was the last gift from his wife. Naturally, John goes on a mission for revenge. But there’s also a huge bounty on his head. How’s it all end? Well, you’ll have to watch to find out.\n\nWith another sequel set to land soon, along with a spin-off that features Ana de Armas and a new television show, John Wick is the franchise that keeps on giving.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.4\n\nStarring: Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen\n\nDirector: Chad Stahelski\n\nRelease date: 30 October 2014 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Chad Stahelski\n\nBox office: USD$86 million\n\nCinematography: Jonathan Sela\n\nMusic composed by: Le Castle Vania, Tyler Bates, Joel J. Richard\n\nLanguages: English, Russian, Hungarian\n\n14. Ocean’s Eleven (2001)\n\nYou can’t go past Ocean’s Eleven when going down a Stan movies rabbit hole. Starring George Clooney as Danny Ocean, the movie sees him freshly paroled from a New Jersey penitentiary and already planning his next crime – the most elaborate casino heist in history.\n\nWhile this adaptation is a remake of a very underwhelming 1960s flick featuring the Rat Pack, Clooney and Co’s version is a far superior cinematic experience. It features an all-star cast that includes Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac and a whole host of other famous faces, so you’ll have more than enough fun pointing out the proverbial buffet of talent on offer.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.7\n\nStarring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nRelease date: 7 December 2001 (USA)\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nScreenplay: Ted Griffin\n\nMusic composed by: David Holmes\n\nAdapted from: Ocean’s 11\n\n15.

The Happytime Murders (2018)\n\nDon’t let the lower IMDB rating fool you – people are notoriously harsh when rating comedy films. Yet The Happtime Murders definitely isn’t one to miss. Starring Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks and Maya Rudolph, this strange but hilarious movie is set in a world where humans and living puppets co-exist. It follows the story of a puppet investigator and a human police detective who must solve a murder spree of retired sitcom stars.\n\nIMDB rating: 5.4\n\nStarring: Brian Henson\n\nDirector: Melissa McCarthy, Elizabeth Banks, Maya Rudolph\n\nInitial release: 22 August 2018\n\nDirector: Brian Henson\n\nBox office: USD$27.5 million\n\nDistributed by: STX Entertainment\n\nStory by: Todd Berger; Dee Austin Robertson\n\nProduction companies: STX Films; H. Brothers; Black Bear Pictures; TMP; Henson Alternative; On the Day Productions\n\n17. Entourage (2015)\n\nPicking up where the TV series left off, Entourage the movie stars the principal cast of the show, Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara and Jeremy Piven. The movie follows actor Vincent Chase, who goes over budget on his directorial debut, and is forced to ask newly appointed studio head Ari Gold for more money. If you loved the TV series, you’ll love the movie just as much.\n\nIMDB rating: 6.5\n\nStarring: Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Jerry Ferrara\n\nDirector: Doug Ellin\n\nRelease date: 4 June 2015 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Doug Ellin\n\nBox office: USD$49.3 million\n\nAdapted from: Entourage\n\nFeatured song: Superhero\n\nProducers: Doug Ellin, Mark Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson\n\n18.

The Stan movie follows the Logan family and their attempt to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway while avoiding security officers and the FBI.

The Nice Guys (2016)\n\nSet in 1970s Los Angeles, The Nice Guys follows down-on-his-luck private eye Holland March (Gosling) and his unlikely partnership with hired enforcer Jackson Healy (Crowe) as they search for a missing woman. The catch? Anyone who gets involved in the case seems to wind up dead.\n\nWhile the combination of Crowe and Gosling seems out of left field, the two superstars share an undeniable on-screen chemistry. Crowe’s brawn pairs perfectly with Gosling’s arrogant but incompetent detective, producing some hilarious moments that never fail to pull the laughs.\n\nIMDB rating: 7.3\n\nStarring: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nRelease date: 26 May 2016 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Shane Black\n\nBudget: USD$50 million\n\nBox office: USD$62.8 million\n\nArt director: David Utley\n\nDistributed by: Warner Bros.

This hilarious film follows the misadventures of a group of teenage friends on holiday in Malia after the end of their final year at school together.

The flick follows Michelle, who after an accident, finds herself locked in a bunker with Howard, a stranger who informs her that she is safe with him. Over the course of the next few hours, Howard reveals that the world outside is uninhabitable, but Michelle isn’t so sure. Uncertain if she is simply being held captive by a deranged lunatic or protected by a good samaritan, Michelle’s inner battle quickly rises to the surface.\n\nOne thing to note about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that while it is a horror, it doesn’t follow the general conventions of a scary film. The scenes are more tense than jumpy and the acting here, particularly from John Goodman, who plays Howard, is absolutely enthralling. If you are looking for a mind-bending film that will leave you guessing, 10 Cloverfield Lane is the perfect example of dystopian horror done right.\n\nRelease date: 10 March 2016 (Australia)\n\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\n\nSequel: The Cloverfield Paradox\n\nCinematography: Jeff Cutter\n\nBox office: USD$110.2 million\n\nDistributed by: Paramount Pictures\n\nHow Man of Many chose the best movies on Stan\n\nYou might be wondering who we are to tell you what’re the best movies on Stan.
