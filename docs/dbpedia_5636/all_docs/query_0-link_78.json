        "text": "The director, producer and cast of the Warner Brothers blockbuster Ocean's 11 will personally accompany a print of the film to a Turkish military base for a special screening for the US and British troops stationed there. The news is the latest chapter in an increasingly cosy relationship between Hollywood and Washington that has thrived since September 11.\n\nOcean's 11 producer Jerry Weintraub hatched the plan while chatting with the movie's cast. \"I said 'We've got troops over there in harms way. Why don't we go and show [the film] to them?'\" he recalls. When the stars agreed, Weintraub duly picked up the phone to Washington. \"I called President Bush, and he said he thought it was fantastic.\"\n\nAll the main cast - including George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon - will take the trip, alongside Weintraub and director Steven Soderbergh. Hollywood's elite squadron will depart the US immediately after the film's LA premiere on December 5 and alight in an as-yet undisclosed military base in Turkey. A remake of the Rat Pack outing of yore, Ocean's 11 opens in the US on December 11 and in the UK on January 18."
