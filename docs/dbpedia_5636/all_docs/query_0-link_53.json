        "text": "Awhile back, nearly four years ago, Brett Ratner was said to be circling a Hugh Hefner biopic at Universal with actors like Robert Downey Jr. and Hugh Jackman circling the role of the Playboy founder. However, the project never came together, and Hefner has gotten older and gone through more wives. Now Deadline has word that Warner Bros. and Ocean's Eleven franchise producer and show business veteran Jerry Weintraub are teaming up for the film, and while there's rumors circulating that Harry Potter franchise scribe Steve Kloves would write the film, Weintraub has apparently denied the claim for now. More below!\n\nIn addition, it's unclear at this time just how much of Hefner's life will be covered in the biopic. Obviously much of the recent years have been chronicled via a couple reality shows on E! channel, but it's the years where Hefner ushered in a sexual revolution through Playboy magazine, a late night show decades ago and eventually various home entertainment outlets and online exploits and is a mainstay in the world of adult entertainment. As of now it's not clear who might direct the film or who will star. If he was just a little younger, Dwier Brown, the man who played Kevin Costner's father in Field of Dreams, is a dead wringer. But I'm willing to bet the studio will want a big name to lead the film. Any suggestions?"
