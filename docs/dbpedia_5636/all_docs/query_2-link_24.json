My film would be based on horror and warner bros have made really amazing Horror movies, one of them is the conjuring which inspired me the most. The movie conjuring is a example of pure horror film brilliance by warner bros thus this is one of the reasons that pushed me towards picking Warner bros as my film institution. Warner brothers being the 2 largest media conglomerate after Walt disney is Vertically Integrated thus producing and distributing its films by using different subsidries under its own institution."
