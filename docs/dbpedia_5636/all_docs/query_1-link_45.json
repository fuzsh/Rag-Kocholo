        "text": "Let me allay some fears right away: Ocean’s 8 is fun. The sequel (of sorts) to Steven Soderbergh’s three Ocean’s films, this time with a mostly female cast of smooth criminals, is a lark and a laugh, an airy caper featuring a bunch of actors you love and a lot of great clothes. Who can argue with that, in June or any other time of year? In that way, Ocean’s 8 is a worthy continuation of a hallowed brand. So, breathe a sigh of relief. There’s no disaster here, no regrettable misfire to be chagrined about. Phew.\n\nThat said, I do wish Ocean’s 8 were a little more than fun. Directed by Soderbergh’s friend and frequent collaborator Gary Ross, the film makes some gestures toward Soderbergh’s snappy visual and narrative style, his zooms and cuts and other syncopated rhythms. But they’re only gestures, loving but half-hearted. The movie looks fine but flat, which has the unfortunate (and unintentional, I’d hope) effect of making it feel as though a mostly women-led Ocean’s movie doesn’t deserve the same luxe finishings as Clooney and the boys. (Ocean’s Eleven was given a higher budget, 17 years ago, than Ocean’s 8 was now.)\n\nPlot-wise, the movie lacks for any of the grander sleights of hand and logical leaps of the other Ocean’s movies. Mind you, very little in those films bears the weight of scrutiny, but at least they provided pleasingly intricate knots to pick through. Ocean’s 8, written by Ross and Olivia Milch, goes a simpler route, paring down the mechanics of its heist and fixing problems quickly and easily. Something about the film feels less thorough, less nourishing, as if it doesn’t trust its audience to contend with something more complicated. Or it could just be that Ross and Milch have written a weaker script than what’s come before. Either way, it feels dismayingly pointed that this Ocean’s movie, of all the Ocean’s movies, is the one that gets the more basic treatment.\n\nSo the film is certainly not without its faults. But many of them are covered up, in the moment anyway, by a sterling cast. Sandra Bullock, sardonic and cool with the faint hum of a sad secret, plays Debbie Ocean, sister to Danny Ocean and recent parolee. We eventually find out how she ended up in the clink, a backstory that’s slightly, but not entirely satisfyingly, woven into the present. But mostly Debbie’s journey in the film is her assembling a team for a bold, fabulous bit of thievery involving a version of the real-life Met Gala and a diamond necklace bigger than my apartment. Bullock handles all this scheming with restrained humor, never sinking into the ring-a-ding smugness that often tainted the earlier Ocean’s movies.\n\nShe’s joined most closely by Cate Blanchett as Lou, a slinky Chrissy Hynde-type who’s skeptical about Debbie’s plan but drawn in nonetheless. We sense an attraction there, perhaps the ghost of a past romance flickering between them, but the film doesn’t explore that dynamic the way that, in theory, a more invested, and also more freewheeling, movie might. Still, we get a lot from Blanchett’s lounge-lizard vibe, coy and pragmatic, as she does a lot of good leaning in a series of crisply tailored suits. We hope for an Ocean’s 9, if only so we can get to know a bit more about Lou.\n\nThe rest of the gang comes together swiftly: Mindy Kaling as a compromised jeweler, Rihanna as a weed-smoking computer hacker, Awkwafina as a caustic pickpocket, Sarah Paulson as some kind of merchandise-hoarding wholesale-goods fencer, and a birdish Helena Bonham Carter as a disgraced fashion designer in need of a quick payday. What a group! And when Ocean’s 8 lets its cast loose, the movie crackles and zings, becoming the clever, easygoing comedy we’ve long hoped it would be. I wish only that moments like that arose a bit more frequently in the film—or, you know, that that mood was sustained throughout. As is, Ocean’s 8 is more devoted to process than patter, more concerned with moving the story along than fleshing out and reveling in the world it hastily builds.\n\nAlso appearing in the movie is Anne Hathaway, playing swanning movie star Daphne Kluger, who will be wearing the sought-after necklace the night of the big job. Any further explanation of how Daphne fits into the story would be a spoiler (though you could count the number of actresses listed before Hathaway in this review and make a safe guess), but know that Hathaway is marvelous in the role. At first it seems she’s just doing an easy bit of haughty imperiousness, but then she gradually infuses that caricature with richly amusing dashes of an almost kinky quirk. She has one scene in particular in which an entirely sexier, more dangerous version of the movie is conjured up—all done through Hathaway’s shifts in breath and bearing. The scene is almost too good for Ocean’s 8, while also proving vital to the film’s success. Hathaway is having a great time, and we’re eager to join her.\n\nocean’s forever\n\nWho’s Having the Most Fun in the New Ocean’s 8 Trailer?\n\nTrick question: the answer is us.\n\nFashion\n\nThe Ocean’s 8 Cast Brings Their Color-Coordinated Style to the Met\n\nThe women reconvened at the museum for a stop on their press tour.\n\nConspiracy Corner\n\nYou Can’t Tell Me Ariana Grande’s Billboard Awards Performance Didn’t Include a Diamond Heist\n\nOcean’s 8, in theaters June 8.\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nHollywood\n\nIndustry Season 3 Is Dark, Addictive, and Filled With “Beautiful Fuckups”\n\nCreators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay open up about new cast member Kit Harington, Succession/Industry overlap, and the odds that their cult HBO drama gets a fourth season.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe 25 Best Shows on HBO and Max to Watch Right Now\n\nStop aimlessly scrolling: We’ve got all the recommendations you need.\n\nMovies\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux Gets More Musical in Latest Trailer\n\nThe sequel to Joker, featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, finds the villainous clown and Harley Quinn making musical mayhem all over Gotham City.\n\nTelevision\n\nIn The Day of the Jackal, Eddie Redmayne’s Shape-Shifting Assassin Meets His Match\n\nLashana Lynch faces off against Redmayne in Peacock’s bold reimagining of the classic cat-and-mouse novel, a thrilling escape with unsettling political parallels.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan Biopic Could Shape This Year’s Oscar Race\n\nWith A Complete Unknown, the Oscar nominee could be back in the race for the first time since his breakout in Call Me by Your Name.
