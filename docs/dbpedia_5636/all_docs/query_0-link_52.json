Together, they recruit a crew of specialists: jeweller Amita (Mindy Kaling), street con Constance (Awkwafina), expert fence Tammy (Sarah Paulson), hacker Nine Ball (Rihanna) and fashion designer Rose Weil (Helena Bonham Carter).\n\nThe target is $150 million in diamonds—diamonds that will adorn the neck of world-famous actress Daphne Kluger (Anne Hathaway), who will be centre stage at the event of the year, the Met Gala. Their plan appears rock solid, but it will need to be flawless if the team is to get in and get away—all in plain sight.\n\nBLU-RAY AND DVD ELEMENTS\n\n“Ocean’s 8” 4K UHD Combo Pack, Blu-ray Combo Pack and DVD Special Edition contain the following special features:\n\nA Heist in Heels\n\nOcean’s Team 3.0\n\nReimagining the Met Gala\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nDIGITAL DISTRIBUTION ELEMENTS\n\nOn August 21, “Ocean’s 8” will be available to own in high definition and standard definition from select digital retailers including iTunes, PlayStation, Xbox and others.
