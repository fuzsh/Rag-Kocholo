        "text": "The movies and entertainment industry is part of the larger media sector. In this guide, we focus not only on the movies and entertainment industry as a whole but also dive into a number of key sub-industries that include:\n\nBroadcasting\n\nCable Networks\n\nStreaming and Over-the-Top (OTT) Services\n\nStudio Entertainment\n\nTheaters\n\nMusic\n\nCompanies in the movies and entertainment industry are involved in the creation, marketing, and distribution of audiovisual pieces including television programs, commercials, content streaming, motion pictures, music, video and audio recording services, radio, gaming, and ancillary services and products.\n\nBroadcasting\n\nThe broadcasting industry comprises broadcasters that use public airwaves to transmit programs available to any television set within the range of a broadcast transmitter, at no cost to the viewer. The services rendered by companies in the industry are also known as free-to-air services. Before the arrival of cable TV, the television landscape in the United States was dominated by broadcasters. Companies in the industry include ABC (The Walt Disney Company), CBS (Paramount Global), and Fox (Fox Corporation).\n\nCable Networks\n\nThe arrival of cable TV was a major disruption for the broadcasting industry. The cable network industry comprises traditional multichannel video programming distributors (MVPD) that transmit live television programs to viewers via satellite and cable infrastructure on a subscription basis. Unlike broadcast channels, cable networks do not use public airwaves. Instead, they charge viewers subscription fees for transmission. Companies in the industry include HBO (Warner Bros. Discovery), Fox News (Fox Corporation), and Nickelodeon (Paramount Global).\n\nStreaming and OTT Services\n\nStreaming services allow viewers to watch content on demand. Also known as OTT, which stands for “Over-the-Top,” it refers to any streaming service that delivers content over the internet. Companies in this industry are online providers of entertainment including movies, TV shows, music, live events, and news, among others. Subscribers of streaming service providers can view the content on their smart televisions, computers, tablets, and/or smartphones. Companies in this space include Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, among others. Services offered by streaming and OTT platforms include:\n\nSubscription video on demand (SVOD)\n\nTransactional video on demand (TVOD)\n\nAdvertising video on demand (AVOD)\n\nThese services are explained in detail in the business model section of the guide. Streaming music providers are covered separately below.\n\nStudio Entertainment\n\nThe studio entertainment industry comprises motion picture studios and entertainment companies that facilitate the production of movies. These companies produce and distribute full-length movies, short films, and animated films, among others. Companies in the studio entertainment industry include Walt Disney Pictures (Disney), Universal Studios (Comcast), Fox Studio (Fox Corporation), and Lionsgate.\n\nTheaters\n\nThe theater or cinema industry comprises companies that primarily show movies produced by the studio entertainment industry in movie theaters. It includes cinemas, drive-ins, and outdoor movie theaters. Companies in the industry include AMC Entertainment, Cinemark Holdings, and Cineworld Group.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music industry consists of companies involved in the production and/or distribution/streaming of music. Music production companies produce, sell, and license musical recordings; and may also own and license musical copyrights. Major companies include Universal Music, Warner Music, and Sony Music.\n\nMusic distribution companies are providers of music streaming services and include companies such as Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify.\n\nRevenue\n\nBroadcasting\n\nBroadcasting companies primarily drive their revenue from TV advertising. The advertising model is based on viewer ratings and the time of day.\n\nCable Networks\n\nCable network providers generate a majority of their revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales. Affiliate fees are carriage fees paid by multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) per month per subscriber. MVPDs provide multiple broadcast TV channels on cable or satellite TV and generally work on a subscription-based business model, but they can also offer video-on-demand options. The amount a cable network provider charges the MVPD largely depends on the quality and quantity of content provided.\n\nCable networks also sell advertisers’ slots in between TV programs. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates that can be charged primarily depend on the size and the nature of the audience that the cable network can deliver to the advertiser.\n\nStreaming and OTT Services\n\nThe streaming and OTT services industry generates revenue from streaming content such as movies and TV shows to viewers. This content can either be self-produced or purchased as streaming rights from filmmakers. Companies in the industry generate revenue from their subscribers. OTT players follow one of the three models to generate revenue – SVOD, TVOD, and AVOD.\n\nSVOD stands for subscription video on demand and helps OTT players generate revenue from subscription fees paid by subscribers to view content on their platform. This model is adopted by players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, among others. TVOD stands for transactional video on demand and helps OTT players generate revenue from subscribers who purchase content on a pay-per-view basis. This model is the opposite of SVOD, where subscribers can choose content based on their needs. Key players in this space include Apple’s iTunes, and Amazon Prime Video Store, among others. AVOD stands for advertising video on demand and helps OTT players generate revenue by posting ads on their platforms. Here, companies allow users to view the content for free but with intermittent advertisements. In this ad-based revenue model, AVOD service providers charge a fee to advertisers to place commercials between their content. Examples of this include YouTube and Hulu.\n\nStudio Entertainment\n\nStudio entertainment companies generate revenue by selling licenses and broadcasting rights to different end markets. These include:\n\nTheatrical Market\n\nHome Entertainment\n\nTelevision Market\n\nOthers, including music groups and live events\n\nThe theatrical market comprises companies that produce and distribute short and full-length live-action or animated movies. Companies in the industry generate revenue from distribution rights and a certain percentage of the total revenue that is earned by the theaters after the release of the film.\n\nThe home entertainment market comprises studio entertainment companies that release movies under their own motion picture banner or through an independent distribution company and distribute their releases via Blu-ray discs, DVDs, and electronic formats to end consumers for at-home consumption. The source of revenue is the sale of DVDs or Blu-ray discs and licensing titles to video-on-demand (VOD) services for electronic delivery to consumers for a specified rental period. Home entertainment distribution usually starts three to six weeks after a movie’s theatrical release in the U.S. and differs from country to country.\n\nThe television market comprises cable and broadcasting networks, television stations, and other video service providers that buy movie licenses from studio entertainment companies. These companies provide content to their viewers on television or through internet-based devices. Here, the studio entertainment company generates revenue through licenses and broadcasting rights.\n\nTheater\n\nThe cinema or theater industry generates revenue from the money spent by movie-goers in movie theaters and advertising at the theaters including the on-screen advertisements before the movies. Revenue from food and beverage sales (typically called concessions) is also an important contributor to revenue. Some examples of theaters are AMC Networks, Cinemark Holdings, and PVR Ltd.\n\nFor the theater industry, total revenue is the sum of admissions or movie ticket revenue, food & beverage revenue, and other theater revenue. Admission revenue is the largest source of revenue for a theater company. It is calculated as the average number of admissions or the number of tickets sold in a given period multiplied by the average ticket price. Admission revenue also depends on the number of screens in a theater. The more screens in a theater, the higher the ability to generate more admission revenue.\n\nFood & beverage sales are the second largest source of revenue after admissions. Theaters use strategic placement of food and beverage items in theaters to reduce wait time, increase visibility and improve traffic flow. Food & beverage revenue is calculated as attendance multiplied by concession sales per patron sold in a theater.\n\nOther theater revenue includes revenue earned from on-screen advertisements before the movies, ads inside the movie theater, income earned from gift cards and package ticket sales, private theater rentals, and more.\n\nMusic\n\nWithin the music industry, music producers or publishers mainly focus on selling, marketing, promoting, and licensing recordings of musical compositions. A major revenue source for production companies is recording and publishing music. Recorded music revenue is the sum of digital, physical, and licensing music revenue.\n\nFor music streaming companies like Apple Music and Spotify, a key metric reported is monthly active users (MAUs). MAU is used by analysts to identify the number of unique users on a company’s platform. Another key metric for music streaming companies is average revenue per user (ARPU). ARPU is the revenue generated per unit or user by a company. ARPU is calculated as total revenue divided by the number of subscribers or users. ARPU is a unit pricing factor and is measured monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nMusic Publishing\n\nRecorded Music Revenue\n\nRecorded music revenue is the revenue generated from the creation, recording, and distribution of songs and albums.\n\nMusic Publishing Revenue\n\nMusic publishing revenue is the revenue generated from the promotion and monetization of musical compositions. Music publishers ensure that songwriters receive royalties for their compositions, and also work to generate opportunities for those compositions to be performed and reproduced.\n\nMusic Streaming\n\nNet Addition\n\nNet addition is the number of new subscribers that a company has after deducting the churn (disconnects) from the gross additions for a particular period.\n\nMonthly Active Users (MAU)\n\nMonthly active users (MAU) refers to the number of unique subscribers of a company within a month.\n\nAverage Subscribers\n\nAverage subscribers are the average number of subscribers a company has in a given period. It is computed by taking the average number of beginning and ending subscribers for that period.\n\nAverage Revenue Per User (ARPU)\n\nARPU, short for average revenue per user, is the revenue generated per unit or user by a company. ARPU is calculated as total revenue divided by the number of subscribers, users, or units. ARPU is a unit pricing factor and is measured monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nTheater\n\nNumber Of Theaters\n\nNumber of theaters is the actual count of theaters a company owns and operates in a particular region.\n\nNumber Of Screens\n\nNumber of screens is the total number of screens in a theater used for showcasing movies to paying audiences. These screens can be digital or non-digital.\n\nTotal Attendance\n\nTotal attendance is the total number of paying audiences that come to a movie theater in a given period.\n\nAttendance Per Average Screen\n\nAttendance per average screen is the total number of paying audiences per average screen in a theater.\n\nAverage Ticket Price\n\nAverage ticket price is the average price of a ticket that patrons pay at the cinema or theater in a given period.\n\nAverage Concession Per Patron\n\nAverage concession per patron is the average revenue received from the sale of food & beverage in a given period per paying customer."
