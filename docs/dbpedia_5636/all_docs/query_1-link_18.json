        "text": "Background\n\nIn 1980, amid the growth of the home video industry, WCI Home Video was renamed Warner Home Video to distribute on video the film and television library of Warner Bros. Studios, and when Time Warner acquired them, programs from other Time Warner companies. Internationally, it distributed the titles from Weintraub Entertainment Group and Cannon Films. During the late 1980s and the early 1990s, it distributed titles from Cannon Video and MGM/UA Home Video. In Australia, it was one of the Magnificent Seven home video distributors. Currently, they also serve distribution for television and/or movie products released by BBC (w/ 2 Entertain), Lifetime, Cartoon Network, Turner Entertainment Co., Viz Media, TruTV, TNT, National Geographic Society, and MGM in the United States, as well as sports products from the NBA, NFL, and NHL. It was one of the last major studios to offer new releases on the Betamax format, doing so until well into the mid-'90s. In 2005, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment was founded to bring together all of its parent company's businesses involved in the delivery of home entertainment content to consumers. The company structure includes subsidiaries such as Warner Home Video, Warner Bros. Digital and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The line was dissolved in 2017, with WBHE being used as the standard.\n\n1st Logo (July 1981-January 1986)\n\nVisuals: Fading in from black, the sequence starts out with a very big \"W\" logo (that is white with a blue \"tube\") that fills the entire screen. It then zooms back slightly. Then above the logo, the words \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" between two horizontal lines appear, followed by a much smaller \"W\" logo beside the byline \"A Warner Communications Company\".\n\nTrivia: This is basically the same as the WCI Home Video logo, but redone with \"WARNER\" replacing \"WCI\" (in a smaller font to accompany the lengthier text).\n\nVariants:\n\nMost, if not all, U.S. releases have the logo cutting in from the FBI warning screen. However, at least a few UK VHS releases have the logo fading in from black, like the WCI Home Video logo.\n\nA variation exists in which the now-white logo is placed on a blue-purple background. The byline is also in an alternate typeface as well.\n\nA still variant exists.\n\nAn abbreviated version that starts when the text fades in exists.\n\nOn Australian Warner Home Video releases of United Artists films, the \"W\" is smaller and is shifted to the top half of the screen, and on the bottom half is the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" text. The logo is completely still this time.\n\nA Spanish version of this logo has the blue circle zoom away from the screen and each section of the \"W\" animates, larger than normal. An asterisk and the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" line appears (there is no fade-in). The asterisk then refers to the phase: \"Marca Registrada de Warner Communications Inc.\" (Registered Trademark of Warner Communications Inc.).\n\nA French version of the logo has the original animation intact, but the text \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" is much smaller than normal and the byline (all in capital letters) is a bit larger. Also, both the text and byline are in an alternate font.\n\nOn some rental-only copies of Rollover, the logo and preceding FBI warning screen are slightly shifted upwards.\n\nThe logo can appear with a trademark symbol next to the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" text.\n\nWarner's now defunct music division used a special variant of this logo for their 1st logo, which can be viewed here.\n\nWarner Video News tapes from 1985 have the \"W\" in a white/blue gradient background, along with a black/blue gradient ground under it. This would wrap to the top right, showing the same frame again, with the text \"WARNER HOME VIDEO PRÄSENTIERT\" flying in with a trail.\n\nA trailer tape from June 1985 has a version that exists where in an evening sky background, a white cube with titles and the \"W\" logo zooms towards the camera, spinning. After a while, it stops at the logo, and the background turns white. The \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" text with the two lines zooms out to its position. The logo would break into a cyan background with the text \"Coming Soon\".\n\nAnother variant exists in the same tape as the previous variant, where on a white background, the \"W\" emblem and the text quickly zoom to us, apart from each other.\n\nOn a V2000 (Video 2000) trailer tape, a variant appears, when after the logo finishes forming, it transitions to a colored V2000 logo.\n\nTechnique: Cel-animation.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the 1985 U.S. VHS release of The Exorcist, the film's opening music starts to play as the logo fades out.\n\nThe Canadian VHS release of Casablanca has the second half of the 1982 United Artists \"Turning UA\" music playing over the logo.\n\nOn some UK VHS releases with previews, the logo has music (either a medium-paced synth strings score, or \"LA Woman\" by The Doors) and a stoic, oddly American-accented male voiceover (Bill McAllister). Before the first trailer, McAllister says \"Some other great titles from the small screen. From Warner Home Video.\" After the last one, he says \"The titles you have just seen are available on VHS and Betamax. Ask your local stockists for details. Warner...Home Video.\"\n\nOn the German Warner Video News VHS release, a wavy synth sound plays, accompanied by an announcer saying \"Warner Home Video präsentiert!\"\n\nAvailability: Seen on VHS, Betamax, LaserDisc, and CED releases at the time.\n\nThe logo itself first appeared on Die Laughing.\n\nThe standard variant was also seen on The Pinwheel Songbook, the only home media release Pinwheel ever had, back when Warner owned Nickelodeon.\n\nThe variant with music and the announcer can be found on the original UK VHS release of Risky Business. The small text variant of the logo is seen on a 1985 French VHS release of National Lampoon's Vacation.\n\nThe abbreviated version can be found on the 1984 LaserDisc release of Camelot.\n\nSome VHS releases have the next print logo on the cover but have this logo on the tape, such as Gremlins, and Pale Rider. It and the preceding warning scroll plaster the United Artists logo but keep its original music on a Canadian VHS release of Casablanca.\n\nGerman Warner Video News releases from early 1985 include this logo, with or without the German voiceover.\n\nLegacy: Considered to be a favorite to many VHS collectors, especially to those who collect \"W\" clamshell tapes.\n\n2nd Logo (December 9, 1985-March 1999 (2007 in Argentina))\n\nVisuals: On a time-lapsed animation of clouds, the camera zooms out between the tops of some gold-colored letters and the bottom of a gold plank. The camera then zooms out and the logo turns towards the camera, revealing that it is the words \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\", with two lines above it and two lines below it. It then zooms out to the bottom of the screen, followed by a giant WB shield logo (in the style of the 1953 movie print logo) appearing from the top of the screen, slightly tilted to the bottom, then rotating to face the camera. The Warner byline fades in at the bottom of the screen. \"Sparkles\" appear and white \"reflections\" appear on the logo.\n\nTrivia: This logo makes an appearance on the Ready Player One DVD special feature The 80s: You're the Inspiration when Ernest Cline mentions that he got his first VCR in the 80s.\n\nBylines:\n\nDecember 9, 1985-1990: \"A Subsidiary of Warner Bros. Inc. A Warner Communications Company\" (in two lines, with \"A Subsidiary of Warner Bros. Inc.\" on top of \"A Warner Communications Company\")\n\nDecember 27, 1990-March 31, 1993: \"A Subsidiary of Warner Bros. Inc. A Time Warner Company\" (same vein as the Warner Communications byline, except that the byline \"A Time Warner Company\" is in place of the old byline \"A Warner Communications Company\")\n\nApril 14, 1993-February 1997: \"A Time Warner Entertainment Company\" (This byline is in an alternate typeface.)\n\nA version of the Time Warner Entertainment variant sometimes has the byline slightly smaller, using a font similar to the first two bylines. This was used from 1993-1997.\n\nThere are two points in the logo when the byline fades in, which vary depending on the byline:\n\nThe Warner Communications and Time Warner bylines fade in as the shield rotates to its final position.\n\nThe Time Warner Entertainment byline fades in at the last note of the theme.\n\nMost releases outside of the United States, including United Artists films such as A Fistful of Dollars, some very early releases, and some domestic releases during the Time Warner merger, including Lorimar-Telepictures releases such as The Sacketts and the original VHS release of New Jack City, do not have the byline.\n\nVariants:\n\nA still version of this logo exists, which can be found on certain Kidsongs videos and Batman Returns (though the UK release of Batman Returns used the normal bylineless logo).\n\nAn extended version of this logo exists, in which the shield remains in place for a few seconds longer before swinging towards the camera and tilting forwards as it does so. A slightly longer version of this variant also exists, which can be found on German Warner Video News VHS releases. Stills of this extended version would later appear on Warner Bros. trailers, plastering the Warner Bros. Pictures logo.\n\nA B&W variant of this logo exists, which can be found on B&W releases, such as VHS releases of the TV series Maverick.\n\nOn Mexican Spanish-dubbed VHS releases of The NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter and Space Jam, it's the finished logo (with the Time Warner byline, strange for the latter film), except the shield animates like the reversed promo variant.\n\nA CGI demo reel from 1997 shows a shiny version of the shield on a dark marble background. The words flip into place from the sides and center, and then the lines slide in from the sides.\n\nOn some UK rental VHS releases, when the logo animation is finished, the logo splits in two horizontally down the middle, then the two sides compress up and down, respectively, revealing a blue background with the yellow words \"COMING SOON\".\n\nOn Australian VHS releases from the 1980s, the logo fades away to a different cloud background. It has \"At Home With The Hits\" in cursive and arched, with the words \"PREVIEW ATTRACTION\" squeezed between sets of two lines. All are gold and the cloud background eases back. On one occasion, this variant fades off before the words could fade in.\n\nOne trailer variant features the white text \"Cinecom Pictures Video Presentation\" chyroned-in below the shield.\n\nSometimes, on trailers, the finished logo and the cloud footage start where they ended on the regular logo. This cloud background is, in fact, additional footage from the regular version.\n\nA promo variant exists, where the giant WB shield rises up from the top and rotates to face forward, then zooms out slightly. In this version, there is no company name or byline. A version of this also exists where the shield zooms out and disappears into the clouds. Warner Video News VHS releases have a copyright stamp placed over the latter version of this.\n\nSometimes on Warner Video News VHS releases, footage of movies appear in front of the WB shield, or promotional text in gold appears over the logo.\n\nA Warner Video News VHS release has the logo flying in a city, whilst turning and swerving.\n\nA trailer tape variant exists, where a blue and white shield, which coincidentally makes it look similar to the future 2019 shield, spins around in a black background. Another version of this has it spinning in a static background.\n\nA trailer tape has the last few seconds of the animation with the text \"NEXT YEAR WE MEAN BUSINESS\" in red appearing under the \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" text.\n\nSome Polish releases distributed by ITI have a variant with the text \"iti proponuje\" flashing throughout the logo.\n\nSome Polish promos have the shield in orange zooming towards the camera on a black background.\n\nPolish VHS releases have a print logo slowly moving above the screen.\n\nArgentinian VHS releases have a variant where in a grey and blue gradient background is the WB shield in blue zooming out and four searchlights and the text \"PROXIMOS VIDEO ESTRENOS A.V.H\" in yellow.\n\nOn French promos, the bylineless logo is off-center, and as soon as the logo finishes animating, the shield turns shinier than normal. Sometimes, at the end of the promo, the variant is reversed.\n\nSometimes before promos, on French VHS releases, the logo does a trail effect around the screen, while the words \"PROCHAINES SORTIES LOCATIONS\" move from right to left. Eventually, the logo returns back to normal, with the text.\n\nA Hebrew \"Coming Soon\" text variant exists.\n\nOn the Greek VHS release of Little Giants, Greek text is seen while the logo is playing.\n\nOn a Swedish trailer tape, the logo plays out normally, but at the end, the name of a month appears in Swedish, after which the month text fades out and the logo disappears with a fold out-like transition.\n\nA cropped variant of this logo with the Time Warner Entertainment byline also exists, which can be found on Amazon Prime Video prints of the pilot for the Ace Ventura: Pet Detective animated series.\n\nTechnique:\n\nOriginally, a mix of live-action and CGI.\n\n2D animation for the UK \"COMING SOON\" and the Australian \"At Home With The Hits\" variants.\n\nCGI for the spinning shield variants, the disappearing shield variant, the Warner Video News city variant, as well as the Polish orange shield variant.\n\nAnalog computer effects for most of the text variants.\n\nComputer animation for the French \"PROCHAINES SORTIES LOCATIONS\" variant.\n\nAudio: A proud, bombastic, synthesized rendition of the 1937 Warner Bros. fanfare. Composed in the keys of F and C. There is also a brief gust of wind when the camera zooms out as the logo turns towards the camera. Silent for the still version.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the 1990 LaserDisc of S.O.B., the logo is silent.\n\nOn German Warner Video News releases, there is different background music, accompanied by an announcer saying \"Warner Home Video präsentiert\", and sometimes \"Warner Video News.\".\n\nThe French promo variant has a French announcer saying \"Warner Home Video vous présente, ses collections prestigiuses plus de 200 films, pour tous.\" (roughly translated to \"Warner Home Video presents, its prestigious collection of more than 200 films, for everyone.\")\n\nThe \"PROCHAINES SORTIES LOCATIONS\" variant has a French announcer, that says \"Warner Home Video vous presenté, une seléction de ses prochaines sorties location.\" (roughly translated to \"Warner Home Video presents a selection of its upcoming rental releases.\"), while the logo is silent.\n\nThe variant with the spinning shield has a dark and menacing announcer saying \"Remember, that's not all, folks!\" and laughing. Ironically, this was at the end of the VHS releases, right after the warning screen.\n\nAvailability: Seen on every Warner Home Video release from the era, beginning with the 1985 clamshell release of Cheyenne Autumn (a few new releases, including Pale Rider, would continue using the previous logo for a couple more months) and being retired starting in 1997, when Eraser was released on VHS in the U.S. (although only the pan-and-scan prints use it; the next logo is on the film's letterbox release).\n\nNotice that the print version of the next logo is seen on 1996-1997 VHS releases starting with The Stars Fall on Henrietta, but the VHS releases themselves still use this logo; in addition, such tapes also still use the commonly seen \"DIGITALLY PROCESSED\" text on the side of the packaging, so this logo is an easy find.\n\nThe bylineless variant of this logo is also seen at the end of the 1991 UK VHS release of Vid-ee-oh! Rap Toon Show, which is then followed by the 1982 MGM/UA Home Video logo.\n\nExtended variant: Seen on a demo U.S. VHS release of The Best of John Belushi and German Warner Video News VHS releases from 1987.\n\nWarner Home Video handled worldwide distribution of MGM products from 1991-2000; however, this logo does not appear on most MGM/UA videos from the time period with the exception of the international VHS release of Thelma and Louise, which uses the bylineless version.\n\nWarner movies, however, did get previewed on MGM/UA VHS releases (and vice versa) on a surprisingly frequent basis, and there are plenty of previews that included this logo.\n\nThis logo also makes an appearance on the Hong Kong Tai Seng/Megastar DVD release of The Protector, after the 1st Media Asia logo and before the 1984 Warner Bros. logo of the time (this is likely because it uses the U.S. version of the film, which appears to be taken from a LaserDisc source, being it has this logo on it).\n\nThe logo is also later preserved on the Blu-ray release of the first episode of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (the animated series).\n\nIn the United States and the UK, respectively, WHV stopped using this logo in 1997 with the sell-through release of the aforementioned Eraser in 1997, while some countries (mainly in Asia) continued until 1999.\n\nThe French promotional variants can be found on various French VHS releases.\n\nThe disappearing shield variant can be found on multiple promotional VHS tapes, such as a June 1989 dealer preview tape, a promotional feature on Batman Forever for its upcoming VHS release in October 1995, a promo for Clint Eastwood movies on the original VHS release of The Dead Pool, and on a promotional trailer for Black Beauty (1994) on the demo tape of said film.\n\nAn example of the UK rental \"COMING SOON\" variant can be seen on rental VHS releases of Lost in America and Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment.\n\nThe Cinecom Video Presentation variant showed up on a trailer for Miles from Home, which can be found on a VHS release of Stealing Home.\n\nThe \"logo floating in a city\" variant can be found on Warner Video News releases from July to September 1988.\n\nDespite international territories using the bylineless variant, a byline was occasionally seen on international releases. For example, the Time Warner byline variant of this logo is seen on the German VHS release of Akira.\n\nLegacy: It's fondly remembered and noted by many for its music and animation. It has been nicknamed \"The Cheesy Shield\" due to its CGI.\n\n3rd Logo (December 20, 1996-March 19, 2019)\n\nVisuals: Against a backdrop of clouds, a clear WB shield with a wordless banner slowly fades into view. Then the words \"WARNER HOME VIDEO\" are wiped onto the banner as the colors slowly appear on the shield.\n\nTrivia:\n\nOn NTSC releases of Ben 10: Alien Force, volumes 1-3 use the fullscreen version, while the remaining six volumes use the widescreen version.\n\nThe cloud background in the logo would be reused on the 1994 Angels in the Outfield trailer and the 1999 American Express Air Miles credit card commercial.\n\nBylines:\n\nThe 1992 WB-styled version (described below) uses the Time Warner Entertainment byline.\n\nAnother byline from 2002-2004 exists, where the byline \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" was seen below the logo. The shield is a lot smaller in this version. Some films' DVD releases, such as Scooby-Doo, A Walk to Remember, Ocean's Eleven, Feardotcom, and The Powerpuff Girls Movie use the regular variant, even though their VHS releases use this variant. A prototype version also exists, which has the shield exactly the same size as the original bylineless version.\n\nVariants:\n\nIn 1998, like other Warner labels, a 75th Anniversary version was made. This used a smaller shield with the banner reading \"WARNER BROS\", and featured a giant \"75\" behind it. \"YEARS ENTERTAINING THE WORLD\" is seen below with \"YEARS\" a bit bigger and in spaced-out letters. This logo is seen during the year at the beginning of home video releases before the trailers, such as Lethal Weapon 4, The Outsiders, Trojan War, and some trailers. At the end of the trailers on VHS releases, the normal variant can be seen.\n\nA version had a still logo in the style of the 1992 version of the 1984 theatrical logo with the Warner Home Video banner replacing the Warner Bros. Pictures banner and the Time Warner Entertainment byline below that which also exists.\n\nA silent version with a previously-formed shield also exists, which can be found at the start of the featurette Bruce Lee: In His Own Words on the 1998 VHS release of Enter the Dragon.\n\nOn a French 1999 VHS release of The Iron Giant, a darker/high contrast version of the logo is seen.\n\nOn the Bugs Bunny's Wildlife Series including the 1998 VHS release of Bugs Bunny's Silly Seals, the widescreen variant is used despite being squeezed in 4:3.\n\nSome early VHS releases with the AOL Time Warner byline have the byline sloppily chyroned in over the standard variant; the byline's fade-out is also out-of-sync with that of the video behind it in this version. This can be seen on Uprising.\n\nA 4:3 version of the AOL Time Warner byline variant which is rendered with wide angle lens exists. It is also videotaped without the byline in place. This is also seen without the byline on several Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo DVD releases.\n\nOn all Blu-ray, HD-DVD, and the 2010-2018 DVD releases, the sky background is zoomed in by 20%. For Blu-ray, HD-DVD, as well as 2010- fullscreen DVDs, the Warner Home Video shield is zoomed out 10%, and the full-screen open matte version of the logo (the one used on the AOL Time Warner years but without the byline) has not appeared on any of the 2010-2018 DVD releases. Some Blu-ray releases from 2006-2009 have the aspect ratio in 2:35.1.\n\nFrench VHS releases from the early 2000s have another variant, where it starts on a messy view of the logo. Eventually, the camera pans to the center of the part and zooms out, revealing a still version with the text \"PROCHAINES SORTIES LOCATIONS\" (roughly translating to \"UPCOMING RENTAL RELEASES\") in grey. Another variant, also seen on VHS releases, has a CGI clapperboard superimposed over the logo, stating \"APRÈS CE FILM, DECOUVREZ D'AUTRES BANDES ANNONCES LOCATION WARNER HOME VIDEO\" (roughly translating to \"After the film, check out other Warner Home Video rental trailers\") in a white Clarendon font, with a Warner Home Video logo under the text.\n\nOn some promos and TV spots, the logo is superimposed.\n\nA variant was seen on a TV spot for the DVD release of Nancy Drew in which the Warner Home Video banner from the print logo is chryoned onto the then-current logo's shield, and portions of the \"W\" and \"B\" can be seen above it. The 2003 Time Warner byline can also be seen below.\n\nTechnique: Live-action for the background, and 2D CGI for the shield.\n\nAudio: A quiet piano tune with two ending types:\n\nA calm string theme, used since 1996. This is used for all VHS, LaserDisc and UMD Video releases and Stereo and Mono DVD releases. Many laserdiscs if the AC3 RF track is selected and a few 5.1 DVD releases from 1999-2005 also use this tune. It can also be heard on many DVD and Blu-ray releases if selecting a different language on the player and the specific language track is only presented in stereo or mono such as Beetlejuice.\n\nA synthesized version of the tune, introduced on March 24, 1997. All 5.1 DVD and Blu-ray releases use this variant. The piano section pans from the left channel to the right. On NTSC releases, it is dual, though this does not occur on 4:3 DVD releases (DVD releases that have the \"This film has been modified...\" notice after the logo).\n\nAudio Trivia: The music was originally written by Mad Bus Music.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, the regular string theme is in a lower pitch. This only occurs on NTSC releases, and usually with the AOL Time Warner byline.\n\nOn a 2006 TV Land airing of Night Court, the beginning of the logo uses the closing theme to the show (plastering the 1984 WBTV logo, while omitting the Starry Night Productions logo), while the rest is silent.\n\nOn the 2003 Special Edition DVD release of Dennis the Menace and Caillou's Holiday Movie, the NTSC AOL Time Warner byline version has the regular tone acoustic strings.\n\nOn the 2003 European PAL DVD release of Friday After Next (2002), the AOL Time Warner byline version is used as always, but the synthesized strings are used instead.\n\nThe messy French variant has the same announcer from the 2nd logo's \"PROCHAINES SORTIES LOCATIONS\" variant, with an added whoosh-like sound. The clapperboard variant also has the announcer saying what's on the clapperboard.\n\nA PAL-pitched version of the acoustic strings variant also exists, which can be found on the Hong Kong VHS release of Space Jam.\n\nA mono version of the acoustic strings variant also exists, which can be found on DVD releases that only include a mono soundtrack such as Casablanca, Scooby-Doo! and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988) and King Kong (1933), among others.\n\nAvailability: Seen on the company's releases from this time period for 22 years.\n\nThe print version of this logo was introduced on both the February 20, 1996 VHS and LaserDisc releases of The Stars Fall on Henrietta; however, the logo was seen earlier on a promotional video in 1995.\n\nThis logo was used concurrently with the previous logo on 1996-1997 WHV VHS releases. VHS releases that are marked as \"DIGITALLY PROCESSED\" carry the previous logo.\n\nThis logo is used, ala the 1998 MGM DVD logo, on certain Warner Archive DVD releases that are simply repackaged versions of previous WHV releases that became out of print.\n\nThis logo was still used in conjunction with the Warner Bros. Home Entertainment logo until late 2018.\n\nThe first products to have this logo were in Japan, with Warner's first four Japanese DVD releases in the country on December 20, 1996. In the U.S., the 1996 rental VHS release of A Time to Kill, released ten days later on December 30, 1996, was the first to include the logo, as well as the VHS release of Bogus, released on February 4, 1997, and the first DVD releases from Warner Bros. (two of which were A Time to Kill and Twister), all of which were released on March 24, 1997.\n\nSome of the last films to use this logo on VHS were the 2005 releases of The Aviator, Racing Stripes, and The Polar Express, with Must Love Dogs, released on December 20, 2005, being the last retail VHS release to use this logo, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, released on March 7, 2006, being the last DVS VHS release to use this logo.\n\nThe version with the regular string theme can be found on VHS releases and DVD releases in stereo or mono.\n\nThe version with the AOL Time Warner byline can be found on most VHS and DVD releases from 2002-2004.\n\nAs for the wide angle full-screen version of the byline variant on DVD, it has been spotted on the two LeapFrog DVD releases of Math Circus and Talking Words Factory 2: Code Word Caper, and The NBA's 100 Greatest Plays released by Warner. The byline-less variant can be found on the screener U.S. VHS release of The Replacements and Mickey Blue Eyes, and several DVD releases of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo.\n\nThe still logo with the Time Warner Entertainment byline was only seen on a few trailers from 1996-1997.\n\nAfter Warner acquired the pre-1986 MGM catalog from Turner in 1999, they reissued all 1997-1998 MGM DVD releases of titles from the pre-1986 MGM library with this replacing both the 1993 MGM/UA Home Video and 1998 MGM DVD logos, although some early copies of the 1999 WHV reprint of 2001: A Space Odyssey do retain the latter logo (mainly review copies and early pressings of the original Stanley Kubrick Collection release).\n\nThis logo can also be found on 2016 and early 2017 UHD 4K Blu-ray releases that Warner released.\n\nThe French variant can be seen on the region's VHS releases from the time.\n\nThis logo was also surprisingly spotted on a TV spot for the VHS release of Batman Forever.\n\nThis logo is also preserved on all UK VHS and DVD releases such as the 1997 UK promotional VHS release of Space Tunes, the 1998 UK VHS release of Bugs Bunny's Overtures to Disaster, the 1999 UK VHS releases of Christmas Cartoon Capers and Mil-Looney-Um 2000: Bumper Collection, the 2000 UK VHS releases of Scooby-Doo!: Volume 1, Wacky Races: Volume 1 and Rudolph's Shiny New Year (1976), and the 2003 UK VHS release of Tom and Jerry's Christmas: Paws for a Holiday, among many others.\n\nThe last (known) release to use this logo is the Tom and Jerry: Cute & Cuddly DVD which was released in 2018, though it also makes a appearance on Ben 10: Out to Launch, released on February 12, 2019.\n\nIt also continued to be used on Cartoon Network releases until the DVD release of Craig of the Creek: Itch to Explore on March 19, 2019.\n\nWarner Archive releases normally do not tend to feature this logo.\n\nIts appearances on third-party distributed releases can vary on the company.\n\nThis logo is preserved on PBS Home Video releases from 1997-2004, as well as 2000-2007 U.S. BBC Video/2 Entertain releases.\n\nHowever, it does not appear on 2007-2017 U.S. BBC/2 Entertain releases, Sesame Workshop, Viz Media, and Paramount Home Entertainment reprints (which contained the print logo on the back cover and sometimes, especially in the case of Paramount, the spine) and such else. Almost all of these companies went with their own logos.\n\nLightyear Entertainment VHS releases Warner Home Video distributed do not use this logo, though it is still intact on DVD releases they distributed from the company, such as Westender and Millionaire Dogs.\n\nIt also does not appear on MGM/UA Home Entertainment/MGM Home Entertainment releases, nor overseas Walt Disney Home Video/Buena Vista Home Video DVD releases they distributed in Australia and Europe from 1999 to 2001, even though the logo can be seen on the back cover (earlier Disney/Buena Vista DVD releases only credit Warner Home Video in text), or UK Icon Home Entertainment releases (all of which use their own logos on-screen and sometimes have Warner Home Video logos on the packaging).\n\nLegacy: This is another fondly remembered logo for its animation and music; however, it's a bit notorious for having the 1993-1999 PBS Kids logo follow it on 1998-1999 VHS tapes of Teletubbies (with some believing that the latter's flashy nature is a gigantic mood whiplash in contrast to the former's peaceful nature)."
