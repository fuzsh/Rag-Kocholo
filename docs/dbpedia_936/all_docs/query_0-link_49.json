        "text": "Refugees are people fleeing violence and persecution—in Syria, Iraq, Eritrea, and other countries in crisis. They have left their homes—and have a proven well-founded fear of return—and crossed international borders. They are seeking safety and the chance to move their lives forward.\n\nThe United States has a long tradition of sheltering those fleeing conflict and persecution. Once refugees have been identified by the United Nations refugee agency and cleared for resettlement, the U.S. government works with the IRC and eight other national resettlement agencies to help them restart their lives in America. Out of the nearly 20 million refugees in the world, fewer than 1 percent are considered for resettlement worldwide.\n\nRefugees may be placed in a city where they have relatives or friends, or where there’s an established community that shares their language or culture. Other considerations include the cost of living and a community’s ability to provide medical services. However, as legal U.S. residents, refugees may live in any city and state they choose.\n\nThe IRC in San Diego opened in 1975 in response to the arrival of Vietnamese refugees resettling to the area, and has since welcomed hundreds of newly arrived refugees from places like Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and many other countries each year. To date, we have resettled over 30,500 refugees from 29 countries.\n\nHow refugee resettlement really works.\n\nOur work isn’t possible without your support.
