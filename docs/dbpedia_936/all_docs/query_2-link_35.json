        "text": "Top 20+ Matching Gift Companies: Leaders in Corporate Giving\n\nMatching gifts are an easy way for nonprofits to earn more revenue and are also one of the most convenient corporate giving programs for companies to implement and maintain. Best of all, recent CSR trends show that companies are becoming even more generous with their programs. To show off the potential of matching gifts, we’ve compiled a list of some of the most noteworthy companies that offer outstanding corporate matching gift programs.\n\nOf course, thousands of employers offer matching gift programs⁠, from Fortune 500 companies to local mom-and-pop businesses. What makes these top matching gift companies stand out from the crowd?\n\nThese are some key factors that play a role:\n\nAuto-submission ⁠— How employees participate in their matching gift programs varies from company to company, and a few trend-setting businesses have gone above and beyond to simplify the process with auto-submission. Companies that offer this functionality through their corporate giving management platform empower donors to request their matches in a single click. All employees need to do is enter their corporate email addresses when prompted to by a participating nonprofit’s donation page. Check out this video for an overview of the process:\n\nCLMA certification — Companies can become Certified Leaders in Matching Automation by working with a CLMA-certified CSR platform. This means they’ve committed to providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for matching gifts! And the easier it is for employees to get involved, the more inclined they’ll be to do so.\n\nLow minimums ⁠— Many companies establish minimums to ensure they are matching gifts to organizations their employees are truly passionate about⁠. However, high minimums can exclude low and even mid-range donations from matching gifts, lowering participation rates. The lower the minimum donation amount for matching gift requests, the more accessible the program is to all donors.\n\nHigh maximums ⁠— On the other end of the spectrum, offering high maximums also leads to increased participation among employees and optimal benefits for the nonprofits, companies, and donors who get involved. Higher maximums encourage larger donations as well as more giving overall for employees trying to hit their yearly match amount limit.\n\nLarge ratios ⁠— A matching gift ratio is the amount of match funding a donor can receive from their employer. While 1:1 is the standard match rate, some companies choose lower ratios (such as 0.5:1), and others set higher ratios (2:1, 3:1, or even 4:1) to magnify employee contributions. The higher the match rate, the larger the potential program benefits.\n\nNote that this type of corporate giving varies from matching or challenge grants, even though they have many of the same elements. While grants have a specific timeframe in which a nonprofit must generate support from their entire donor base, matching gifts are a year-round offering that focuses on donations exclusively given by your employees. While you certainly want to offer a generous program, you’ll need to be prepared to allocate sufficient resources on an ongoing basis.\n\nWithout further ado, let’s get into our top matching gift companies⁠ and what they do well.\n\nMatching Gift CompanyMatch RatioMax Match AmountOffers Auto-Submission?\n\nCLMA-Certified?Checkr1:1Inquire with Checkr.Yes – partnership with Millie.Yes!Ginkgko Bioworks1:1$2,500Yes – partnership with Selflessly.Yes!TSR Inc.1:1Inquire with TSR Inc.Yes – partnership with Millie.Yes!Gene B.

And each of those companies started somewhere!\n\nHere’s how your company can begin matching gifts:\n\nDetermine gift amounts that you’re willing to match per employee, per year. This is typically done by choosing a set minimum and maximum donation size.\n\nIdentify the types of employees whose charitable donations your company will match. Specifically, determine if you’ll match gifts for just current full-time employees or extend matching gift opportunities to part-time and retired employees or even employee spouses.\n\nChoose the nonprofit mission types your company will match donations to. Consider whether you’ll match gifts for all 501(c)(3) nonprofits, educational institutions (including or exempting K-12 programs), local charities, any organization with the exception of houses of worship, or have any other requirements.\n\nSet a deadline by which employees must submit a matching gift request to be eligible for a company donation. This should be a certain annual date or a number of months post-donation.\n\nDecide how employees will submit their matching gift requests and what donation information will be required. Many companies utilize online forms or CSR platforms to ask for a copy of the donation receipt and nonprofit contact information, including their EIN. If your company already uses a CSR platform, check to see if it integrates with Double the Donation’s matching gift software and get in touch with our team to learn about enabling auto-submission to make matching gifts even easier for your employees.\n\nPromote your new matching gift program to your employees to drive participation. Share information about your giving program in your internal communications, policy handbook, onboarding materials, and other relevant internal materials.\n\nThis is a quick overview, but there are plenty of available resources if you’re looking for a more in-depth guide of what to consider when starting a matching gift program.\n\nOffering to match employee donations is one of the simplest yet most effective ways to engage with your workforce while doing good at the same time. And companies of all shapes and sizes can partake⁠ in corporate partnerships.
