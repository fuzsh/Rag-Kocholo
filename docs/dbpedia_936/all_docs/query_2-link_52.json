        "text": "How do we measure the effectiveness of our volunteer abroad programs?\n\nIn case youâre wondering how we select the best volunteer abroad programs for 2024, hereâs some context to understand the criteria IVHQ volunteer programs are measured againstâ¦\n\nProgram Support\n\nAs the world leaders in volunteer travel, IVHQ has a specialist support team to help you find the right volunteer program to match your motivations, skills and the causes you care about. Once youâve found the right volunteer program and registered to volunteer overseas with us, youâll be connected with a dedicated Program Manager to support you on your journey. Youâll also gain access to the full suite of preparation tools within your MyIVHQ account. Here, you can access your detailed program guide, online volunteer training and customized preparation checklist to ensure youâre all set to volunteer overseas.\n\nOur local teams are also on-hand to support you throughout your volunteer experience, from the moment you step off the airplane. This includes organizing your airport pick-up, program orientation and 24/7 support while youâre abroad. IVHQ works closely with these local teams day in, day out to ensure that your volunteer abroad experience is the best it can be.\n\nVolunteer Work\n\nIVHQâs locally-led programs are designed to ensure you can make a positive contribution to important causes through your volunteer work abroad, while enjoying a culturally immersive experience. With our huge range of 300+ volunteer projects to choose from, there are plenty of options that give you the opportunity to pursue your passions, explore a career path or even share one of your hobbies with others. Youâll also need to consider how active you are, as some volunteer programs are more physically demanding than others. Our team of Volunteer Travel Specialists can help you choose the perfect program based on these factors.\n\nAccommodation\n\nAfter a day of volunteering, nothing beats coming home to a comfortable home away from home. When volunteering abroad with IVHQ, youâll be living in the company of like-minded volunteers from around the world. The accommodation options vary from country to country but you can be confident that youâll always have a safe and vetted place to call home. You could be living in a homestay with a few other volunteers, a volunteer house with dormitory-style rooms or you may wish to request a private room if that option is available.\n\nMeals\n\nDepending on the volunteer program you choose to join, you can be served up to three meals a day. Volunteer meals are typically made up of local cuisine so youâll have the opportunity to sample traditional home cooked meals that can often accommodate special dietary requirements. Check out our choice of the best volunteer destinations for vegetarians and vegans here.\n\nImpact\n\nThe best volunteer abroad programs are the ones that deliver the biggest impact through mutually beneficial exchanges between international volunteers and their host communities. When volunteering abroad with IVHQ, you can feel confident that youâll be contributing to locally-driven volunteer projects that are supporting important social and environmental objectives. This is achieved by working in collaboration with local people who are in the best position to determine where volunteer support is most needed. Itâs crucial that when youâre looking for legitimate volunteer abroad programs, you consider how your time abroad will impact the community and that volunteer work is driven by their needs.\n\nBest volunteer abroad programs for high school students in 2024:\n\nWeâve got 15 volunteer programs around the globe that high school students can take part in.
