        "text": "Hunter Burgarella\n\nZone 1 Representative\n\nHunter is a long-time resident and local realtor in the Mid City West neighborhood. He cares deeply about our neighborhood and consistently fights for the priorities his fellow residents care most about, with their values top of mind. Hunter started his career covering politics in Washington DC after graduating from the University of Southern California. It was there he worked as a political producer for a national news network in a variety of roles from producing shows, to covering the White House as well as the 2012 presidential election for which he was awarded an Emmy. After seven years in Washington DC, he moved back to his home state of California to the city he loves most, Los Angeles.\n\nhburgarella@midcitywest.org\n\nRamiro Castro Jr.\n\nRenters Representative\n\nRamiro is a seasoned producer and Director of Post with a proven track record of success in developing and managing production and post-production pipelines for major content providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Comedy Central, and Disney.\n\nAs a board member of Mid City West, Ramiro seeks to leverage his experience managing large teams into the role of community support and communication. Ramiro is originally from Chicago and has lives in Los Angeles for 12 years, 6 of them in the Mid City West are with his wife Jessica, his dog Milo, and his cat Marmalade.\n\nrcastrojr@midcitywest.org\n\nChris Dower\n\nNonprofit Representative\n\nChris Dower first joined MCW as a stakeholder in 2021, and has been serving as co-chair of the Planning and Land Use Committee and member of the transportation committee as a board member since November of 2022. He is a dedicated advocate for affordable housing and access to safe mobility for our community, our city, and everyone in it.\n\nChris has worked to streamline the cumbersome approval process for building new housing and takes a multifaceted approach to making housing affordable to everyone. He was first inspired to learn about local politics and housing policy in 2017 when his rent was illegally raised before the end of his lease. Chris takes a people-centered approach to making our communities more livable through infrastructure for cycling, walking, rolling and transit and is an advocate for making those modes of transportation safer, faster and more convenient. He believes that these policies will be an invaluable tool in fighting climate change and accomplishing equity for everyone in our community.\n\nSome of Chris’s accomplishments during his tenure at MCW include leading the charge for asking the City Council to support 11 pieces of State legislation that will increase the supply of housing in Los Angeles and ultimately make housing more affordable (AB 1633, AB 976, SB 423, SB 4, AB 835, AB 68, SB 684, SB 450, SB 294), and streamlining PLUC guidelines for restaurants to encourage more restaurants in our neighborhood.\n\nChris is also a board member of a non-profit where he is in charge of operating their scholarship program for college students.\n\ncdower@midcitywest.org\n\nDre Guttag\n\nAt Large Representative\n\nOriginally from Lexington, MA, Andrea “Dre” Guttag has lived in LA’s Mid City West neighborhood for over a decade. The daughter of an MIT professor and immigrant mother, Dre is a first generation American. Dre's first foray into public service was as a child. After witnessing a number of pedestrian and bicycle accidents in her home town, she put together a proposal to educate elementary and middle school students on street safety and sharing the roads. The proposal was scaled and was quickly implemented in multiple States. For this work, Dre was recognized by Safe Kids Worldwide and was flown to Washington D.C. to receive a commendation by retired Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop. Since then, Dre has gone on to serve in a meaningful capacity for multiple non-profits, public agencies, and political campaigns. In 2020, after their nominations were decided by the Democratic Party, Dre was honored when she was selected to serve on the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris finance committee. More locally, in Mid City West Dre spent two years as co-chair of the Under-40s group at LACMA and was officially recognized as a Community Leader by The Jewish Federation of LA. Dre's primary areas of focus in the non-profit world are social justice, the health and rights of refugees, women's issues, and environmental causes.\n\naguttag@midcitywest.org\n\nLynda La Rose\n\nRenters Representative\n\nLynda La Rose is a poet/performance artist who has been writing since 1993 and a longtime resident of Mid City West.
