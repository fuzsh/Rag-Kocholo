        "text": "By car\n\n[edit]\n\nGiven the size of the Mid-City, traveling by car is the most reliable way to get around. SR-94 passes east-west along the southern edge of the area, providing quick access to Downtown to the west and the suburbs to the east, while I-8 cuts across the northern edge of the area through Mission Valley. SR-15 and I-805 pass north-south through the area, crossing each other in Mid-City. Major east-west streets include El Cajon Boulevard, University Avenue, and (in the northeastern part of the region) Montezuma Road. Major north-south streets include Fairmount Avenue, Euclid Avenue, 54th Street, and College Avenue.\n\nBy public transit\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) operates transit service in the city. Frequent routes serve Mid-City, but given the size and often sprawling nature of the area traveling by bus can be time-consuming. Plan your route carefully. Frequent routes include the #7 and #10 on University Avenue, the #1 and Rapid #215 (stops only at major intersections) on El Cajon Boulevard, and the #11 on Adams Avenue, all of which connect either to Hillcrest or Balboa Park to the west, with some continuing on to Downtown. North Park is also served by the frequent #2 to South Park and Downtown and the #6 to Mission Valley. A transit center at SDSU is served by many bus routes as well as the San Diego Trolley Green Line service from Downtown and Old Town to the eastern suburbs."
