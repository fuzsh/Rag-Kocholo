        "text": "In simple terms, a nonprofit organization is one that functions to further a mission, social cause, or shared goal. Unlike businesses, nonprofit organizations do not exist to make a profit.\n\nNonprofit organizations exist in most communities and governments, businesses, and citizens support them in various ways for the overall benefit of the communities they serve.\n\nTo help you get a greater perspective on nonprofit organizations, we’ll explain:\n\nWhat a nonprofit is\n\nWhat nonprofits do\n\nWho governs nonprofits\n\nBest practices for nonprofits\n\nWe’ll also provide lots of examples of impactful nonprofits at the national, regional, and local levels.\n\nWhat Is a Nonprofit Organization and What Does It Do?\n\nNonprofit organizations are organized groups of people that form for the purpose of providing goods and services state and federal governments cannot do on their own. Each nonprofit established a board of directors to oversee the organization. Often, nonprofits have an executive director that leads teams of employees and volunteers to get the work done.\n\nWhile state and federal taxes support many vital programs and services, there aren’t enough funds to supply every need. Nonprofit organizations fill the gaps in services that everyday people could not access any other way.\n\nHow Do Nonprofits Work?\n\nNonprofit organizations must file certain founding documents with the IRS. From a leadership standpoint, the board of directors must hold meetings at least annually. Board positions carry many important duties and responsibilities as board members make important decisions regarding the nonprofit.\n\nNonprofit organizations engage in fundraising activities to ensure they have the funds to support the organization. Because nonprofit organizations provide valuable services to communities, state and federal governments do not require nonprofit organizations to pay taxes. It’s their way of supporting the good work that nonprofits do.\n\nWhat Are the 4 Types of Nonprofit Organizations?\n\nWhile people loosely refer to nonprofit organizations as charities, other organizations also qualify as nonprofit organizations.\n\nThe four main types of nonprofit organizations are listed below:\n\nCharitable organizations\n\nChurches and religious organizations\n\nPrivate foundations\n\nPolitical organizations\n\nVarious other types of organizations including civic leagues, homeowner associations, labor unions, social welfare organizations, and volunteer fire departments also operate as nonprofit organizations.\n\nNonprofit organizations commonly prepare for board meetings and activities using a board management system for maximum efficiency.\n\nBoard effectiveness reflects the board’s ability to deliver on its mission and achieve its goals. Download the Board Effectiveness Checklist, organized into key areas, to help your nonprofit board operate even more effectively.\n\n———————————————————————————————–\n\nWho Governs Nonprofit Organizations?\n\nState governments have the primary responsibility for governing and regulating nonprofit organizations. In at least 39 states, nonprofits must register their nonprofits with the appropriate state department.\n\nGenerally, nonprofits must take the following steps to establish a nonprofit organization:\n\nFill out an application to become a nonprofit organization\n\nFile a charter stating the nonprofit’s purpose with the designated state department (usually the Secretary of State)\n\nDraw up articles of incorporation\n\nForm a board of directors\n\nHold the first board meeting\n\nFollow any other requirements as the state mandates\n\nOnce the nonprofit is up and running, the board must continue to follow all applicable rules and file Form 990 with the IRS annually.\n\nBest Practices for Nonprofit Organizations\n\nWhile nonprofit organizations aren’t as heavily regulated as for-profit companies, reputable nonprofits abide by ethical standards and best practices as a means of practicing good governance.\n\nTake a look at these common best practices for nonprofit organizations:\n\nForming a diverse board of directors\n\nAvoiding conflicts of interest\n\nMaintaining financial viability\n\nBeing overseers rather than managers\n\nEstablishing reasonable compensation for employees\n\nCreating policies and workflows that support efficiency and cost-effectiveness.\n\nAssessing board performance at least annually\n\nPurchasing applicable insurance policies\n\nHaving appropriate succession plans\n\nThe National Council of Nonprofits provides a link of state-by-state resources for best practice resources for nonprofits.\n\nExamples of Nonprofit Organizations\n\nThe following table includes nonprofit organization examples according to the area they serve.\n\nNational NonprofitsRegional NonprofitsLocal NonprofitsNational Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)SoCal GrantmakersHope Meadows Intergenerational CommunityWounded Warrior ProjectFlorida Philanthropic NetworkThe Elephant Sanctuary in TennesseeCatholic Charities USACommunity to CommunityYouth VillagesNational Council of NonprofitsFarm Labor Organization CommitteeRebuilding Together OKCAmerican Red CrossNAMI Kane-south, DeKalb, and Kendall CountiesBrownsburg Health Care CenterGoodwill Industries InternationalUnited Way of Greater NashvilleCumberland Prevention CoalitionFood Chain Workers AllianceAkron-Canton Good BankPoverty 2 Prosperity PS IncJustice for Migrant WomenGoodwill of North GeorgiaThe Midnight MissionUnited Food and Commercial WorkersPineros Y Campesinos Unidos del NoresteGod’s Pantry Food BankCongressional Coalition on Adoption InstituteMid-America Carpenters Regional CouncilAscend JusticeHomeschool Legal Defense AssociationCommunity & Residential Services AuthorityMusic Maker FoundationYMCA of the USAThe Chicago Housing AuthorityPennsylvania Center for Adapted SportsNature ConservancyShriver Center on Poverty LawKnoxville Habitat for HumanityDAV: Disabled American VeteransSoutheast Texas Nonprofit Development CenterAlbuquerque InvolvedJuvenile Diabetes Research FoundationOccupational & Environmental Health Center of Eastern New YorkCommunity for Heroes\n\nNonprofit Organizations: Doing Good at Every Level\n\nThere are over a million nonprofits in the United States, each with its own mission and vision. As our list of nonprofit organizations shows, each of them provides programs, activities, or services for people who could otherwise not get them.\n\nWhile state and federal governments do their best to oversee nonprofits, it is ultimately up to the board to ensure compliance and good governance. Overall, a highly competent board is the driving force behind the good nonprofits do."
