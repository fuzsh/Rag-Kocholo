        "text": "What Lawyers Do About this section\n\nLawyers advise and represent clients on legal proceedings or transactions.\n\nDuties\n\nLawyers typically do the following:\n\nAdvise and represent clients in criminal or civil proceedings and in other legal matters\n\nCommunicate with clients, colleagues, judges, and others involved in a case\n\nConduct research and analysis of legal issues\n\nInterpret laws, rulings, and regulations for individuals and businesses\n\nPresent facts and findings relevant to a case on behalf of their clients\n\nPrepare and file legal documents, such as lawsuits, contracts, and wills\n\nLawyers, also called attorneys, research the intent of laws and judicial decisions and determine whether they apply to the specific circumstances of their client’s case. They act as both advocates and advisors for one party in a criminal (offense against the state or the nation) or civil (matters between individuals or organizations) proceeding.\n\nAs advocates, they may present evidence and argue in support of their client for settlements outside of court, such as through plea bargaining or arbitration, or during court appearances, such as in hearings and trials. As advisors, they counsel clients about their legal rights, obligations, and options and suggest courses of action.\n\nLawyers may have different titles and duties, depending on where they work.\n\nFor example, in law firms, lawyers perform legal work for individuals or businesses. Those who represent clients accused of wrongdoing or carelessness may be called criminal law attorneys or defense attorneys. Those whose expertise includes representing clients in trials are sometimes called litigators or trial lawyers.\n\nCorporate counsels, also called in-house counsels, are lawyers who work for a single organization. They advise the organization’s executives about legal issues related to its business activities, such as patents, contracts with other companies, taxes, and collective-bargaining agreements with unions.\n\nAttorneys in federal, state, and local governments may have a variety of titles, including prosecutor, public defender, or general counsel. Prosecutors typically pursue the government’s charges against an individual or organization accused of violating the law. Public defense attorneys represent criminal defendants who cannot afford to hire a private attorney. Government counsels help write regulations, interpret laws, and set up enforcement procedures, and they may argue cases on behalf of the government.\n\nPublic-interest lawyers work for organizations that provide legal services to disadvantaged people or to others who otherwise might not be able to afford legal representation. They often handle cases involving issues related to social justice or individual liberty, such as housing discrimination or consumer rights.\n\nLawyers may oversee the work of support staff, such as paralegals and legal assistants and legal secretaries.\n\nIn addition to working in different industries, lawyers may specialize in particular legal fields, including the following:\n\nEnvironmental lawyers deal with issues and regulations that are related to the natural world. They may work for advocacy groups, waste disposal companies, or corporations. In government agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, they help to ensure compliance with relevant laws.\n\nFamily lawyers handle a variety of legal issues that pertain to spousal, parent-child, and other familial relationships. They may advise and advocate for clients in proceedings on topics such as divorce, child custody, and adoption. Family lawyers also may work for local, state, or federal agencies to ensure compliance with relevant government regulations.\n\nIntellectual property lawyers deal with the laws related to inventions, patents, trademarks, and creative works, such as music, books, and movies. For example, an intellectual property lawyer may advise clients about whether they may use published material in a forthcoming book. Some intellectual property lawyers work for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nPersonal injury lawyers represent clients in civil proceedings who have been harmed by the actions or lack of action by another party.\n\nSecurities lawyers work on legal issues arising from the buying and selling of financial instruments. They may advise corporations that are interested in listing on a stock exchange through an initial public offering (IPO) or in buying shares in another corporation. In government, they may work for their state’s securities regulator or for a federal regulatory agency, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nTax lawyers handle a variety of tax-related issues for individuals and organizations. They may help clients navigate complex tax regulations, handle tax disputes, and represent clients in court on tax-related matters. Tax lawyers also may work for government agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThose who handle a range of legal issues without specializing in a particular area of law are known as general practice lawyers. These lawyers may handle criminal and civil matters related to common legal matters, such as traffic violations, wills and estate planning, and real estate negotiations.\n\nHow to Become a Lawyer About this section\n\nLawyers typically need a law degree and a state license, which usually requires passing a bar examination.\n\nEducation\n\nBecoming a lawyer usually takes 7 years of full-time study after high school: 4 years of undergraduate study followed by 3 years of law school. Although most law schools do not require a specific bachelor's degree for entry, common undergraduate fields of study include law and legal studies, history, and social science.\n\nMost states and jurisdictions require lawyers to earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). ABA-accredited programs include courses such as constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and legal writing.\n\nAs part of their admissions process, law schools may consider an applicant’s score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). LSAT questions cover reasoning, writing, and other aptitudes needed for the study of law.\n\nThose interested in pursuing a career in some legal fields may need to meet additional requirements. For example, patent lawyers typically need a degree, specific credits, or a background in science or engineering and must pass an exam administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (commonly known as the patent bar exam). Tax lawyers may choose to earn a Master of Laws (LL.M) degree in tax after completing a J.D. program.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nProspective lawyers take a licensing exam, called the “bar exam.” Most states have adopted the Uniform Bar Exam, which is coordinated by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE). A score from the uniform exam is transferable across jurisdictions that accept it.\n\nLawyers who receive a license to practice law are “admitted to the bar.” Each state’s highest court establishes its rules for bar admission. Rules for federal courts differ, and requirements vary by state and jurisdiction. For more details on individual state and jurisdiction requirements, visit the NCBE.\n\nMost states require that applicants graduate from an ABA-accredited law school, pass the written bar exam, and be found by an admitting board to have the character to represent and advise others. Prior felony convictions, academic misconduct, and a history of substance abuse are examples of factors that may disqualify an applicant from being admitted to the bar.\n\nLawyers who want to practice in more than one state usually must meet licensing requirements for each state in which they wish to work. Most states have reciprocity agreements that streamline the process for lawyers licensed in one state to get licensed in another state.\n\nAfter bar admission, lawyers must keep informed about legal developments that affect their practice. States may require lawyers to participate in continuing legal education to maintain licensure.\n\nOther Experience\n\nLaw students who have completed their first or second year of law school may be eligible for part-time jobs or summer internships in law firms, government agencies, and organizations’ legal departments. Gaining experience in these summer positions may help law students decide on an area of legal focus for their careers. As for students in many fields, successful completion of a summer job or internship may result in an offer of employment after graduation.\n\nSome law school graduates pursue a judicial clerkship prior to working as a lawyer. Clerkships are typically a specified length of time, such as 1- or 2-year terms, and help law school graduates develop skills required for a legal career. Judges may prefer to hire clerks who have passed the bar exam, but clerks may work without a law license because they have limited duties and are not yet practicing lawyers.\n\nAdvancement\n\nNewly hired attorneys usually start as associates and work on teams with more experienced lawyers. Some lawyers advance to become partners, which means that they are partial owners of the firm.\n\nAfter gaining experience, some lawyers go into practice for themselves. Others may move to a large organization, either working in its legal department or as in-house counsel.\n\nSome experienced lawyers become judges. Most judges must be appointed or elected to their positions, a procedure that often requires political support.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nAnalytical skills. Lawyers interpret the law as it applies to their client’s case. They must be able to evaluate large amounts of information, interpret relevant findings, and apply them to facts.\n\nCommunication skills. Lawyers must be able to clearly present and explain information to clients, opposing parties, and other members of the legal community. They also need to be precise when preparing documents, such as court filings and wills.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Lawyers must build relationships with current and prospective clients, as well as with their colleagues and other members of the legal community.\n\nPersuasion. Lawyers work to convince others that particular laws or findings apply to their client’s case in a way that is most favorable to their client.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Lawyers must evaluate information to propose viable solutions, mediate disputes, and reach agreements or settlements for their clients.\n\nResearch skills. Lawyers need to find laws and regulations that apply to a specific matter in order to provide appropriate legal advice for their clients."
