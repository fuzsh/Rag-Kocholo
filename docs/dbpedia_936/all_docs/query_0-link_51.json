        "text": "Nation’s Public Health System Needs Sustained Attention and Investment; The Report Provides Action Plan for the Administration and Congress Taking Office in 2021\n\n(Washington, DC – October 6, 2020) — The COVID-19 pandemic sharply illuminated weaknesses in the nation’s public health system and ways in which structural racism put communities of color at disproportionate risk of negative health outcomes, according to a new report, The Promise of Good Health for All: Transforming Public Health in America. The report was released today by Trust for America’s Health. Among its findings is that the nation’s public health system is dangerously inadequate. The report offers a blueprint for policymakers taking office next year on how to strengthen the system, protect against health security threats, address the social determinants of health, and combat racism and other forms of discrimination that negatively affect community and individual health and resilience.\n\nAmericans are facing increasing environmental and weather-related threats from wildfires to hurricanes. Infectious disease outbreaks are a constant and complex risk as world travel allows small outbreaks to become worldwide threats in a matter of hours. Additionally, Americans have higher levels of chronic disease and mental health and substance misuse issues than ever before. As a nation, we spend over $3 trillion annually on healthcare but lag behind other developed countries in practically every health metric. A key to addressing these threats to the nation’s health is a significant investment in the public health system, including programs rooted in prevention and working at the population health level. The report calls for an annual $4.5 billion investment in the nation’s public health infrastructure including in 21st century data systems and a robust public health workforce.\n\n“Even before COVID-19, numerous health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks like measles, Zika and Ebola, the opioid epidemic, weather-related events and lung injuries due to vaping demonstrated the urgency of a strong public health system,” says John Auerbach, President and CEO of Trust for America’s Health.\n\n“Each of these emergencies brought short-term attention to the importance of the public health system, but short-term attention is not enough. Without sustained investment the nation’s public health system we will not be ready to protect Americans’ lives and livelihoods during the next health emergency,” Auerbach said.\n\nThe conditions in which people live and work are key drivers of their health. Therefore, solutions to health risks and inequities largely exist outside the healthcare sector and reinforce the importance of investing in population health and the social determinants of health. Increasing the nation’s investment in health promotion and disease prevention will not only improve the quality of life for millions of Americans, it will help decrease the nation’s exploding healthcare spending.\n\nThe report focuses on five key priority areas:\n\nPRIORITY 1: Make substantial and sustained investments in a more effective public health system including a highly-skilled public health workforce.\n\nPRIORITY 2: Mobilize an all-out effort to combat racism and other forms of discrimination and to advance health equity by providing the conditions that optimize health.\n\nPRIORITY 3: Address the social determinants of health including economic, social, and environmental factors that result in preventable illness, injuries and death.\n\nPRIORITY 4: Proactively address threats to the nation’s health security.\n\nPRIORITY 5: Improve health, safety, and well-being for all people by providing pathways to optimal health across the life span.\n\nAmong the report’s recommendations for federal policymakers are:\n\nStrengthen and modernize the public health system by creating a $4.5 billion per year Public Health Infrastructure Fund to support foundational public health capabilities at the state, local, territorial and tribal levels.\n\nBuild 21st century public health surveillance systems at the federal, state and local levels to enable rapid detection and response to disease threats.\n\nCreate a Health Defense Operations budget designation to build sustainable funding for public health programs that prevent, detect and respond to outbreaks.\n\nMake advancing health equity and eliminating health disparities a national priority with a senior-level, federal interdepartmental task force charged with adopting policies and programs in housing, employment, health, environmental justice and education that reduce health inequities and address the social determinants of health.\n\nExpand grants to address health inequities and ensure funding is reaching under-resourced, marginalized, and disproportionately affected communities.\n\nPrioritize increased funding for state, local, tribal and territorial public health emergency preparedness and response programs, such as CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness program and HHS’s Hospital Preparedness Program.\n\nBuild surge capacity across the healthcare system and develop standards for healthcare facility readiness. Policymakers should provide payment incentives and reward facilities that maintain specialized disaster care capabilities.\n\nGrow the CDC’s Climate and Health Program so it can support every state, large cities, territories and tribes to be climate-ready. Clean air and water regulations should be restored and strengthened, including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.\n\nIncrease research and effective messaging to build vaccine confidence and ensure that no person faces barriers to receiving all necessary vaccinations.\n\nPromote optimal health across the lifespan through access to health insurance, job-protected paid leave for workers, and significant investments in programs proven to support families and improve health – from babies to older adults.\n\nThe report is endorsed by the American Public Health Association, the Asian & Pacific Islander American Health Forum, the Big Cities Health Coalition, the Public Health Institute, and the National Network of Public Health Institutes.\n\n# # #\n\nTrust for America’s Health is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that promotes optimal health for every person and community and makes the prevention of illness and injury a national priority. On Twitter at @HealthyAmerica1\n\n(Washington, D.C. – September 30, 2020)\n\nOn August 18, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released Healthy People 2030 – the 5th iteration of the nation’s 10-year plan that sets data-driven objectives and targets to improve health and well-being in the United States. Updated every decennial since 1980, Healthy People 2030 builds on the knowledge gained and lessons learned to address the nation’s most critical public health priorities and challenges.\n\nHealthy People 2030 includes 355 objectives in alignment with five overreaching goals. These goals include:\n\nAttain healthy, thriving lives and well-being free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death.\n\nEliminate health disparities, achieve health equity, and attain health literacy to improve the health and well-being of all.\n\nCreate social, physical, and economic environments that promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being for all.\n\nPromote healthy development, healthy behaviors, and well-being across all life stages.\n\nEngage leadership, key constituents, and the public across multiple sectors to take action and design policies that improve the health and well-being of all.\n\nHealthy People 2030 also includes prioritizing 10-year measurable targets for objectives related to the social determinants of health – which include economic stability, education, health care access, neighborhoods and the built environment, and social and community environments. For example, related to economic stability and food insecurity, HHS wants to reduce household food insecurity by 5 percent over the next 10 years (11.1 percent of households were food insecure in 2018).\n\n“Healthy People 2030 aligns with many of Trust for America’s Health’s priorities around health conditions such as diabetes and obesity; health behaviors such as vaccination and drug and alcohol use; population-level health for groups such as older adults; systems such as public health infrastructure and preparedness for emerging public health threats like COVID-19; and the social determinants of health,” said John Auerbach, President, and CEO at Trust for America’s Health.\n\n“It provides a framework of measurable objectives to evaluate the change that needs to occur to achieve optimal health and well-being for every person and community. COVID-19 is the most current example that demonstrates the longstanding disproportionate health and economic impacts faced by Black, Indigenous, and people of color along with other marginalized communities. Together, public health must work with multiple sectors to advance equitable policies that address these social and economic disparities, and work towards achieving the goals of Healthy People 2030.”\n\nFor more information, visit Healthy People 2030.\n\nHaving obesity is a risk factor for serious COVID consequences; pandemic could increase future levels of obesity due to increased food insecurity\n\n(Washington, DC – September 17, 2020) – The U.S. adult obesity rate passed the 40 percent mark for the first time, standing at 42.4 percent, according to State of Obesity: Better Policies for a Healthier America released today by Trust for America’s Health (TFAH). The national adult obesity rate has increased by 26 percent since 2008.\n\nThe report, based in part on newly released 2019 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BFRSS) and analysis by TFAH, provides an annual snapshot of rates of overweight and obesity nationwide including by age, race and state of residence.\n\nDemographic trends and the conditions in people’s lives have a large impact on their ability to maintain a healthy weight. Generally, the data show that the more a person earns the less likely they are to have obesity. Individuals with less education were also more likely to have obesity. Rural communities have higher rates of obesity and severe obesity than do suburban and metro areas.\n\nSocioeconomic factors such as poverty and discrimination have contributed to higher rates of obesity among certain racial and ethnic populations. Black adults have the highest level of adult obesity nationally at 49.6 percent; that rate is driven in large part by an adult obesity rate among Black women of 56.9 percent. Latinx adults have an obesity rate of 44.8 percent. The obesity rates for white adults is 42.2 percent. Asian adults have an overall 17.4 percent obesity rate.\n\nObesity and its impact on health including COVID-19 risks\n\nObesity has serious health consequences including increased risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and many types of cancers. Obesity is estimated to increase healthcare spending by $149 billion annually (about half of which is paid for by Medicare and Medicaid) and being overweight or having obesity is the most common reason young adults are ineligible for military service. Concerns about the impact of obesity have taken on new dimensions this year as having obesity is one of the underlying health conditions associated with the most serious consequences of COVID infection, including hospitalization and death. These new data mean that 42 percent of all Americans are at increased risk of serious, possibly fatal, health impacts from COVID-19 due to their weight and health conditions related to obesity.\n\n“Solving the country’s obesity crisis will require addressing the conditions in people’s lives that lead to food insecurity and create obstacles to healthy food options and safe physical activity. Those conditions include poverty, unemployment, segregated housing and racial discrimination,” said John Auerbach, President and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. “This year’s pandemic has shown that these conditions don’t only increase the risk of obesity and chronic illnesses, they also increase the risk of the most serious COVID outcomes.”\n\nChildhood obesity also on the rise\n\nRates of childhood obesity are also increasing with the latest data showing that 19.3 percent of U.S. young people, ages 2 to 19, have obesity. In the mid-1970s, 5.5 percent of young people had obesity. Being overweight or having obesity as a young person puts them at higher risk for having obesity and its related health risks as an adult. Furthermore, children are exhibiting earlier onset of what used to be considered adult conditions, including hypertension and high cholesterol.\n\nTwelve states have adult obesity rates above 35 percent\n\nObesity rates vary considerably between states and regions of the country. Mississippi has the highest adult obesity rate in the country at 40.8 percent and Colorado has the lowest at 23.8 percent. Twelve states have adult rates above 35 percent, they are: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. As recently as 2012, no state had an adult obesity rate above 35 percent; in 2000 no state had an adult obesity rate above 25 percent.\n\nFood insecurity and its relationship to obesity\n\nThe report includes a special section on food insecurity and its relationship to obesity. Food insecurity is linked to lower quality diets and tracks with higher levels of obesity in many population groups. Food insecurity is closely linked to economic conditions. There were higher levels of food insecurity during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and early data indicate a large increase in the number of American families experiencing food insecurity due to the COVID-19 crisis. According to U.S. Census Bureau survey data, 25 percent of all respondents and 30 percent of respondents with children, reported experiencing food insecurity between April and June of this year.\n\nSolving the obesity crisis will require multi-sector initiatives and policy change\n\nThe report includes recommendations on how best to address the obesity crisis grounded in two principles: 1) the need for a multi-sector, multi-disciplinary approach, and 2) a focus on those population groups that are disproportionately impacted by the obesity crisis.\n\nRecommendations include:\n\nWhile the COVID-19 public health emergency continues to be in place, continue USDA nutrition policy waivers and expand no-cost school meals to all enrolled students for the entire 2020-2021 school year.\n\nIncrease funding to allow for the expansion of critical CDC obesity-prevention programs including the State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program and the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health program.\n\nExpand benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as “food stamps”) by raising maximum benefit levels, extending Pandemic-EBT (P-EBT) for students and children, doubling investments in SNAP-Ed, and finding innovative, voluntary ways to improve diet quality without harming access or benefit levels.\n\nIncentivize businesses and public land use to increase access to healthy food options and safe places to be physically active.\n\nDisincentivize unhealthy food choices by closing tax loopholes and eliminating business-cost deductions related to the advertising of unhealthy food and beverages to children and by enacting sugary drink taxes where tax revenue is allocated to local efforts to reduce health and socioeconomic disparities.\n\nEncourage Medicaid to cover pediatric weight-management programs for all eligible beneficiaries.\n\nReport Full Text\n\nSupport for the State of Obesity report series was provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

This critical bill would address the social, economic and environmental conditions that affect the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans.\n\nIf enacted, the bill would create a Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Through grants, this program would improve the capacity of public health departments and community organizations to address social determinants of health and reduce health care costs by building multi-sector collaborations and addressing policies that currently inhibit good health. Grants would also be issued to nonprofit organizations and institutions of higher education to conduct research on SDOH best practices, provide technical, training and evaluation assistance and/or disseminate those best practices. Lastly, the program would coordinate, support and align SDOH activities at CDC.\n\nThe President and CEO of Trust for America’s Health, John Auerbach, congratulates Sen. Smith and Sen. Murphy on the introduction of the bill:\n\n“The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continued conversations our country is having about racism and racial justice, continue to put a spotlight on the social and economic conditions that contribute to an individual’s health outcomes during their life.\n\nWe know that a community’s resources directly impact the health outcomes of its residents. Now is the time to work to address these disparities, including those in housing, employment, food security and education.\n\nThis legislation would empower public health departments and community organizations to act as chief health strategists in their communities and lead efforts to convene partners across sectors to build integrated systems and programs that improve health and health equity.\n\nThe Improving Social Determinants of Health Act of 2020 is an important next step in improving health outcomes, would reduce overall healthcare spending and help address health inequities; TFAH is proud to support this bill and urges Congressional support.”\n\nThis bill is the Senate companion bill to Improving Social Determinants of Health Act of 2020 (H.R. 6561), which was introduced by Representative Nanette Diaz Barragán (CA-44) in April 2020.\n\nTFAH’s summary of the bill can be found here.

Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released preliminary data showing an increase in drug overdose deaths in 2019. These provisional data showed an estimated 71,999 Americans died from overdoses last year, a nearly five percent increase in numbers of deaths as compared to 2018 and a reversal of the prior year’s small decrease in such deaths.\n\nThe 2019 increase was largely driven by a rise in deaths from synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, as well as methamphetamine, and cocaine.\n\n“These new data are a stark reminder that we must fight the dual public health threats of COVID-19 and substance misuse at the same time,” said John Auerbach, President and CEO of Trust for America’s Health. “While understandably focusing attention on the pandemic response, we can’t neglect the devastation caused by substance misuse and overdoses.”\n\nAn area of concern is that the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to more substance misuse and overdose deaths. Preliminary data from the Office of National Drug Control Policy has found a substantial increase in suspected overdoses since the start of stay-at-home orders on March 19th, 2020. And a new study, out this week by RTI International, found that alcohol sales have surged nationally during the pandemic.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, policymakers have eased certain regulations on the delivery of mental health and substance use services. Telehealth requirements have been altered to allow for increased access through audio-only services and federal authorities have allowed for prescribing of buprenorphine and methadone, drugs t treat opioid use disorder, without an initial in-person examination.\n\nDespite these changes, challenges remain. COVID-19 has made access to substance misuse treatment more difficult for many. Millions have lost or will soon lose health insurance coverage as unemployment rises. Some are fearful of seeking care because of the threat of infection. And relatively little is being done to address the upstream factors that elevate the risk of substance misuse, such as lack of educational and economic opportunities and racial injustice.\n\n“How many more lives must we lose before we take seriously the need for a comprehensive call to action? We are going in the wrong direction and need to prioritize this larger epidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Benjamin F. Miller, Chief Strategy Officer for Well Being Trust. “We must begin by investing in solutions that work – those solutions that more seamlessly integrate mental health and substance use disorder treatment into all the places people show up for help.”\n\nTrust for America’s Health and Well Being Trust co-produce the Pain in the Nation series which has tracked alcohol, drug, and suicide deaths nationally since 2017.
