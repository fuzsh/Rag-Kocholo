        "text": "Transportation is so important to me. I am 92 years old and had a terrible accident two years ago. I am in terrible shape, losing 35 pounds since the accident. I can never drive again, so you can see how bad I need someone to take me to doctor appointments, shopping and to the bank. I have been treated very good by everyone and they act very concerned for me. Thank you very much. - John\n\n“In June of 1977, I enrolled my child in the Head Start Program and had no idea this meant connecting to a program which would change my life. I was encouraged to volunteer, nominated as “Parent of the Year,” and was hired as a Teacher’s Aide in 1978. Since then, I have been a Teacher, Parent Involvement Coordinator and Social Service Coordinator. With the support of staff, I graduated with a Bachelors of Science degree in June 2009. Because of the support and encouragement from the staff and other Head Start families, I currently serve as a Family Advocate where I am able to give back and encourage others to achieve their goals.”\n\n“I would like to thank Mid Florida Community Services for all their help restoring our home. My coughing has stopped … health is better now. I can’t say enough about Mid Florida Community Services, they rescued us.”\n\n“My experience with the Children’s Advocacy Center has far exceeded my expectations. My children were scared and hesitant when we were first referred to the program, but the CAC has now become a place of security for them. Even though the family situation my children have been through is not completely solved, they both have learned coping skills and a better understanding of things. I have come away many times with a sense of peace that I am doing the right thing for my children. I feel truly blessed to have made the decision to ask the Children’s Advocacy Center to help them.”"
