        "text": "Driver’s License Mid-City\n\nGentilly Alert\n\nDriver's Licenses can now be issued Monday through Saturday in Metairie and Harvey and Monday through Friday at all other offices! We are contracted with, and authorized by, the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles to issue Official Louisiana Driver’s Licenses. We interface with the State and use the same camera system, so we can issue first time licenses (TIP upgrades), renew your Driver’s License, issue a duplicate Drivers License, or change the address on your current Driver’s License. You are out in minutes instead of hours!\n\nABC TITLE OF Mid-City - DRIVER'S LICENSE\n\nSEE BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.\n\n1) NAME CHANGES\n\nWere you married, or divorced, or have you otherwise legally changed your name? ABC Title can assist with updating your license in two simple steps.\n\nFirst, you must visit the social security administration and update your name there. Then, you must wait 24 hours and bring us the letter they issue to you confirming the change.\n\nFinally, we need a certified copy of the official name change document (Usually divorce decree or birth certificate; marriage license; or court order). Don’t forget your proof of insurance if you own a vehicle\n\n*Note: If you have both a Driver’s License and State ID, you must change your name on both or cancel one.\n\n2) REAL ID UPGRADE\n\nAlthough you will not need to be Real ID-compliant for air travel until May 7, 2025, ABC Title can issue them now. After May 7, 2025, visitors seeking access to military bases and federal facilities must have a driver’s license or identification card that is Real ID compliant. Simply bring one primary form of ID, two secondary forms, and two proofs of residency. For your Real ID Checklist click here and for frequently asked questions regarding the Real ID, click here.\n\n*NOTE: If your primary document (Passport or Birth Certificate) reflects your maiden name, then you must also bring your marriage license.\n\n3) FIRST TIME DRIVER’S LICENSE\n\nEvery new driver must obtain a Temporary Instructional Permit (TIP) from the OMV, take Driver’s Education, and a road skills test at the OMV or with a third-party provider prior to obtaining a Driver’s License regardless of age. (Click here for a list of third-party providers)\n\nApplicants who are 16 years old are eligible for an Intermediate License (click for details) after having a learner's permit for 180 days. Once an applicant with a learner’s permit reaches the age of 17, he or she is eligible for a full license. Applicants over 17 years of age are not required to apply for a permit or intermediate license.\n\nBring your TIP, a sealed envelope containing the results of the road skills test, and proof of insurance if you own a car. If you are under 18 years of age, bring your birth certificate and your parent or legal guardian with their ID.\n\n4) DRIVER’S LICENSE RENEWAL\n\nWhen your Driver’s License expires, there is no quicker or easier way to renew than visiting ABC Title of Mid-City. Simply bring your proof of auto insurance (if you own a car) and be ready to take another picture. You will also be required to pass an eye exam, so be sure to bring your glasses or wear your contact lens. Most people are finished with their new Driver’s License in hand in under 15 minutes… Scaryfast!\n\n5) DUPLICATE DRIVER’S LICENSE\n\nLost your Driver’s License? Don’t worry, at ABC Title we can print a duplicate Driver’s License in minutes instead of hours. Be sure to bring your proof of insurance if you own a car and be ready to take another picture. (if you are under 18 years of age, bring your Certificate of Enrollment from school, birth certificate, and your parent or legal guardian with their ID).\n\n6) CHANGES OF ADDRESS\n\nDid you recently move from one address in Louisiana to another address in Louisiana? Did you know that you can be cited by a police officer for an incorrect address on your Driver’s License? ABC Title of Mid-City can update the Louisiana address on your Driver’s License in just a few minutes. Bring your proof of insurance if you own a vehicle and get ready to smile for your new picture. *ALL CHANGES OF ADDRESS MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE PROOF OF RESIDENCY. For a list of acceptable proofs click here.\n\n7) MOTORCYCLE ENDORSEMENTS\n\nAn applicant must possess a valid Louisiana driver’s license or learner’s permit. An applicant must provide an original certificate of completion of the Department of Public Safety, Motorcycle Safety, Awareness and Operators Training Program to ABC Title (this is a small card reading “Basic Motorcycle Operators Training Course).\n\nThe course can be taken at the Louisiana State Police and a course schedule may be found by clicking here.\n\nPublic Tag Agencies are not allowed to add the MC endorsement if testing is handled by any other entity at this time.\n\n8) WILDLIFE AND FISHERIES ENDORSEMENT\n\nIf you have a lifetime hunting license, lifetime fishing license, Firearm and Hunter’s Education certificate of completion or Boating Safety Education certificate of competition, ABC Title can add the appropriate endorsement to your driver’s license. Simply bring us your license and/or certificates. Regular driver’s license fees apply.\n\n9) DRIVER’S LICENSE EMERGENCY CONTACT\n\nDid you know that if you ask, you can have an emergency contact added to your Driver’s License record? In the event of an accident, a police officer can access emergency contact information using the Driver’s License number if you are unable to communicate. In a separate transaction, a contact name, address, relationship and multiple contact numbers can be added. Add a loved one’s contact information to your Driver’s License or add your contact information to your minor child’s Driver’s License. It is a fast and easy transaction that can be completed along with a duplicate, renewal, or change of address. This can also be a stand-alone transaction. Let ABC Title provide you with this additional level of security and peace of mind.\n\n10) BLOOD TYPE INDICATOR\n\nAsk us about adding your blood type to your driver’s license. This is a way to get some extra peace of mind for you or your minor children who drive and there is no additional fee if you are adding it in conjunction with another Driver’s License transaction. In the event of an emergency, medical provider’s can act fast. This also compliments the Organ Donor indicator and the emergency contact information.\n\n11) Autism Indicator\n\nEligible Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles customers can now request to have an “Autism” indicator added to their driver’s license. Qualified applicants include any person diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by a qualified medical or mental health professional. The autism indicator will appear under the customer’s picture on the license.\n\nApplicants must provide one of the following documents to the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles in order to have the designation added:\n\nMedical Examiner’s Certification of Autism Spectrum Disorder form completed by the medical or mental health professional\n\nA statement from a qualified mental health professional licensed in Louisiana or any other state or territory of the United States verifying the applicant’s disability.\n\n12) State to State Driver’s License (including the RealID)\n\nIf you are new to this state and have an out-of-state driver’s license, ABC Title can transfer your class E Driver’s License to Louisiana. Simply bring your current unexpired driver’s license, original birth certificate OR passport, and one proof of residency (If you want the RealID, be sure to bring two printed proofs of residency).\n\n13) COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSES (METAIRIE STORE ONLY click here)\n\nCDL transactions can ONLY be processed at our Metairie location Monday through Friday. We cannot issue first-time CDLs and we CANNOT process any transaction on a CDL that has a HAZMAT endorsement. ALL CDL TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE A CURRENT MEDICAL CERTIFICATE AND PROOF OF INSURANCE. Click here to visit the Metairie CDL page for more information.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ. I have a Chauffeurs License, can you upgrade me to a CDL?\n\nA. Unfortunately, we cannot move anyone up the ladder regarding Chauffeurs Licenses or Commercial Licenses. We can only Downgrade between Class A, B, C, and D.\n\nQ.
