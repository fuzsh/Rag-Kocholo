        "text": "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA), a not-for-profit organization founded in 1953, is the leading patient organization for people with asthma and allergies, and the oldest asthma and allergy patient group in the world.\n\nMore than 27 million people in the United States have asthma. The best way to manage asthma is to avoid triggers, take medications to prevent symptoms, and prepare to treat asthma episodes if they occur.\n\nAllergies are one of the most common chronic diseases. An allergy occurs when the body’s immune system sees a substance as harmful and overreacts to it. The substances that cause allergic reactions are allergens.\n\nAAFA offers a variety of educational programs, resources and tools for patients, caregivers, and health professionals. AAFA launches educational awareness campaigns throughout the year. We teach the general public about asthma and allergic diseases.\n\nResearch is an important part of our pursuit of better health. Through research, we gain better understanding of illnesses and diseases, new medicines, ways to improve quality of life and cures. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) conducts and promotes research for asthma and allergic diseases.\n\nAAFA works to support public policies that will benefit people with asthma and allergies. Advocacy and public policy work are important for protecting the health and safety of those with asthma and allergies. We advocate for federal and state legislation as well as regulatory actions that will help you.\n\nThere are several ways you can support AAFA in its mission to provide education and support to patients and families living with asthma and allergies. You can make a donation, fundraise for AAFA, take action in May for Asthma and Allergy Awareness Month, and join a community to get the help and support you need."
