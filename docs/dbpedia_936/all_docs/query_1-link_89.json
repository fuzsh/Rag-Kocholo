        "text": "Our Doctors\n\nChoosing the right physician for you and your family can be a key difference in how you're able to maintain or improve your health throughout your life. Skilled physicians Dr. Kara Farley and Dr. James Terry have experience with patients of all ages and get to know all about your unique health needs to help you and your loved ones achieve an elevated state of being. Together, they work with people and their families to diagnose chronic and acute illnesses, provide treatment, perform routine physicals and preventive care, and provide disease management. We also offer medically assisted weight loss programs and personalized healthcare plans.\n\n\"This service is perfect for our busy lifestyle. I live in Weatherford and it’s like I always have immediate care without sitting in a waiting room with other sick people. I’m traveling in Europe and getting updates on tests and how to proceed. A large reason why this works so well is Dr. Farley. Highly recommend her and her practice.\"\n\n\"Navigating the VA system is not for the weak hearted. Finding a Doctor that understood the world of aircraft maintenancers and the rigors of our lives, as well the world of being a flyer for 25 years . We deal with things many others dont, and most doctors truly dont care about your background. Then I found Dr Farley !!!! WOW just wow. As a Flight Doc and flyer herself, things just clicked. It was effortless. I knew my issues stemmed from my 20 plus years in the Air Force , I just didnt know how to communicate that to the VA. She was my voice and her voice got me to 100% VA connected just by telling my story and explaining my issues in VA language. ABSOLUTE ROCK STAR !! Thanks a million Dr Farley.\"\n\n\"Dr Farley is so personable and actually listens to me!! She is an amazing Dr and I recommend her to anyone in need of primary care. I wouldn’t see anyone else. She compassionate and takes her time with her patients. And also she is judgment free, which is HUGE!\"\n\n\"Dr Farley is so personable and actually listens to me!!
