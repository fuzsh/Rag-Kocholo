Every day was amazing and full of incredible experiences and new people.\n\nThe days flew by as we were so busy working on the farm, hanging out and making new friends, and learning about the wildlife in a very hands on manner. The staff is very helpful, friendly, and seem just as excited to be there as the volunteers. As mind-blowing as the actual project [was], the people I met were similarly incredible. It’s crazy that in just a few weeks you can develop friendships that seem like you’ve had for years. Leaving was very emotional, but still, I can’t recommend this trip enough to anyone who is considering it or may be on the fence, seriously, do it.\n\nHaving just returned home, I already miss everything that filled my days for those two weeks in South Africa. I find myself constantly looking back at photos and in the back of my mind planning a return visit as soon as possible. – Dave P, Wildlife Sanctuary, South Africa\n\nMaximo Nivel\n\nMaximo Nivel is Volunteer Forever’s top-ranked volunteer abroad program with over 250 reviews and a perfect 5-star rating.

Maximo was a big contributor to my positive experience. I volunteered with underprivileged kids and helped paint a battered women’s shelter. I also took inexpensive Spanish lessons with them.\n\nThe accommodation they provided was great (I recommend Arcopata Family House). I lived with fellow participants of the program in a house and was provided really good meals. When I got sick, they had a doctor come to the house to check on me and give me medicine too.\n\nAfter volunteering, I became TEFL certified with them during a 4-week course. All in all, I was very impressed, and I would recommend them to anyone. The experience changed my life.\n\nProjects Abroad\n\nProjects Abroad describes itself as providing the gold standard of volunteer support and safety so that travelers may fulfill their potential, discover themselves, and create positive change in the world.

This program is suitable for pre-med and medical students.\n\nIn Ghana, the organization runs regular medical outreaches in communities where healthcare services are limited.

Unlike many organizations, IVI has built many of its projects from the ground up. Beyond offering travel and volunteering experiences, they play a significant role in the humanitarian sector, aiding impoverished communities and refugees. They also provide university students the opportunity to fulfill their practicum hours in sectors such as mental health, medical, teaching, and veterinary projects.\n\nBeyond Volunteering: Internships, Teaching, and More\n\nMoreover, for those eyeing internships, destinations like Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Ghana, Nepal, and Sri Lanka offer openings in the medical, teaching, physiotherapy, dental, and nursing fields. IVI’s internships guarantee specific hours, and for university placements, the necessary documentation and supervisor approvals are given. Although IVI doesn’t provide paid teaching abroad, they offer teaching projects at almost every destination, catering to various age groups, predominantly aged 3-12.\n\nFamily and Group Adventures\n\nWhether one is a solo adventurer, a family unit, a group, or a teen, IVI has projects tailored to fit each need. Their family-friendly ventures encompass kindergarten teaching, construction, environmental initiatives, and animal care projects. For larger groups, IVI presents specialized itineraries combining volunteering programs with engaging activities, making them an ideal choice for school groups.\n\nFor volunteers aged 16-17, a signed parental consent from their guardians is a prerequisite. Some of IVI’s projects also accommodate younger kids, ensuring they remain under parental or guardian watch.\n\nDiscover More\n\nInterested in learning what sets IVI apart?

The Chiang Mai city tour was fab too!\n\nMy 3 weeks stay at the elephant camp was definitely the highlight of my Thailand trip. I enjoyed meeting other volunteers from around the world and getting involved in different tasks at the elephant camp. On the weekends, we enjoyed our time in Chiang Mai thoroughly exploring the night market, going to Doi Suthep and other plenty of Thai temples.

Meg, Sam and Aug were the main reason. They provided a balanced view on how to go about my role as a volunteer. I can not describe how inspired I was by the whole trip and the staff at the cottage.\n\nThe structure of the project was brilliant. You can clearly see the priorities. Keeping a good relationship with the village population and the elders was their main focus. Providing amazing support to the wound clinics, HIV support groups, nursery and home based care groups was incredible. I am very lucky I was part of the development of the different village I visited.\n\nAt the weekends I got to experience other parts of Malawi. Like the landscape and culture outside the village. I wish I could have stayed for longer. I hope to return to Malawi in the near future. – Maria, March 2015\n\nFrontier\n\nFounded over 25 years ago, Frontier combines community development, capacity building, ecosystem protection, economic growth, and the development of civil society through collaboration between local communities, researchers, and volunteers of all ages.\n\nFrom their first program in Tanzania – a marine park still operating today, developed in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund – Frontier has expanded to include more than 400 projects in 72 countries around the world.\n\nThis nonprofit scientific research organization employs dedicated staff who have been published in more than 450 articles in peer-reviewed journals – and whether you’d like to take on an internship abroad, volunteer project, gap year, or teach abroad / TEFL program, Frontier is a fantastic way to travel the world and make a positive impact.\n\nFrontier Opportunities to Check Out\n\nCosta Rica: Big Cats, Primates, and Turtle Conservation\n\nOn this program, you’re invited to gain practical research and conservation experience while helping to conserve the natural habitats of Costa Rica’s wildlife.
