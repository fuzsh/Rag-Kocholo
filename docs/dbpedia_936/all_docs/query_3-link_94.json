They may be responsible for running only one program in an organization and reporting to the agency’s upper management. They usually do not design programs but instead supervise and implement programs set up by administrators, elected officials, or other stakeholders.\n\nIn small organizations, social and community managers often have many roles. They represent their organization through public speaking engagements or in communitywide committees; oversee programs and execute their implementations; spend time on administrative tasks, such as managing budgets; and help with raising funds and meeting with potential donors.\n\nHow to Become a Social and Community Service Manager About this section\n\nSocial and community service managers typically need at least a bachelor’s degree and work experience.

Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nMuch of the job growth in this occupation is the result of a population increasing its number of older adults. This age group has a greater need for social services, such as adult daycare, creating demand for social and community service managers.\n\nIn addition, employment growth is projected as people continue to seek treatment for their addictions and as people with substance abuse disorders are increasingly being directed to treatment programs rather than sent to jail.
