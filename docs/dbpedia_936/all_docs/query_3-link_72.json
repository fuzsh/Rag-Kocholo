This is a priority. Treat all downed wires as live and dangerous.\n\n• We give priority to hospitals, police and fire departments and other critical facilities\n\n• Then repair transmission lines and substations that supply power to the local system\n\n• We then focus repairs to restore the largest number of customers"
