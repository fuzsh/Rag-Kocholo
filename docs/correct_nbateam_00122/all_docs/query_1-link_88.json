        "text": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) â Jamal Crawford is coming off a 51-point game.\n\nPeople may have forgotten. After all, it was more than 450 days ago. And for a while, it looked like that game might have been Crawfordâs last as a player â because for most of this season, the now 40-year-old guard remained unsigned.\n\nâTo be honest with you, I went through a range of emotions,â Crawford said. âI was frustrated at the beginning. I didnât understand. I didnât know what happened.â\n\nLuckily for Crawford, it doesnât matter anymore. Heâs back in the NBA, filling one of the spots that the Brooklyn Nets needed to address after their roster was decimated by injuries and coronavirus-related issues coming into the season restart at Walt Disney World. With Vince Carter now officially retired, Crawford comes back into the league as its oldest player â about 2 1/2 months older than Miamiâs Udonis Haslem.\n\nCrawford, a three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year and a past winner of the Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award, practiced with the Nets for the first time on Wednesday.\n\nâHeâs a guy that loves playing the game of basketball in the offseason, really keeps himself in shape, whether thatâs playing in pro-ams, whether thatâs playing pickup games, whether thatâs just being around the game with his kids,â Nets interim coach Jacque Vaughn said. âAnd then some people just have the genetics that go with it, that theyâre special human beings and they can still play at the age of 40 â or 20 times two, right?â\n\nThe Nets will become Crawfordâs ninth team in a career that, once he gets into a game at Walt Disney World, will reach 20 seasons.\n\nHis last game was April 9, 2019, when he came off the bench and scored 51 points for Phoenix against Dallas. Heâs the oldest player in NBA history to score 50 in a game â Michael Jordan was about seven weeks shy of his 39th birthday when he had his last 50-point outing â and for a while this season it looked like Crawford would join Kobe Bryant in a rare NBA club.\n\nBryant scored 60 in his final NBA game. If Crawfordâs last outing with Phoenix would have been his NBA farewell as well, he and Bryant would have been the only two players to score at least 50 in their on-court finales.\n\nâIf guys said your last game was a 51-point game off the bench, thatâs a heck of a exit,â Crawford said. âSo, I tried to find the peace within that and I got a chance to spend time with family. But Iâm so happy to be back.â\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
