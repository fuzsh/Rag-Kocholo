        "text": "Harry How/Getty Images\n\nJamal Crawford is reportedly considering the New York Knicks as his possible future team, but if the Knicks are smart, they'll do the one thing they can never seem do to on the court: pass.\n\nThe 32-year-old guard has opted out of his contract with Portland, and according to Sam Amico of FOX Sports Ohio, he is also looking at the Heat, Clippers, Kings and Cavaliers as possible options in free agency.\n\nAlthough Crawford was effective once in New York, if the Knicks know what's good for them, they'll let him sign elsewhere.\n\nDon't get me wrongâ€”Crawford is a solid veteran player. He's won a Sixth Man of the Year award (2010), he's one of four players to score at least 50 points in a game with three different teams, he's the NBA's all-time leader in four-point plays and his patented shake-and-bake move is one of the sickest things I've ever seen.\n\nHowever, his second stint in New York would likely be a disaster for everyone involved.\n\nCrawford is a relentless gunner, a ball-stopping guard who excels in one-on-one situations. Everything he does well is predicated around the ball being in his hand. And although his style is effective in the right situation, he's the last thing New York needs right now.\n\nThe Knicks are an exceptionally talented team, but they struggle because their pieces don't fit well together.\n\nAmar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony already have enough trouble sharing the rock. With Jeremy Lin returning from injury, they will have a third ball-dominating player on the court. If you add Crawford to that mix, their hideously stagnant offense will have another black hole to kill ball movement and jack up contested jumpers as the shot clock winds down.\n\nCrawford is a good player, but the Knicks have plenty of guys who can put points on the board. Now, they just need players who are sound defensively, aggressive on the boards and infectious with their passing."
