        "text": "When the NBA All-Star Game reserves were announced, Jamal Crawford didn’t make the cut. His LA Clippers teammates and coaches cried foul. Per the LA Times: “Obviously, we’ve got two guys in it,’ said head coach Vinny Del Negro, referring to Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, who were voted in by the fans as starters. ‘With our record and the way Jamal has performed for us and being such a catalyst for us, you always want your guys that have been having a good year to have an opportunity to play in that.’ Crawford is tied for second in scoring for the Clippers, averaging 16.6 points per game. He has been clutch for the Clippers late in games. Crawford is third in the NBA in total points (266 before Thursday night’s game) in the fourth quarter. His teammates say Crawford should have made the team. ‘He’s played an unbelievable role on this team, which is a good team,’ Chauncey Billups said. ‘He has a lot of responsibility on this team, and his responsibility is pretty much the same as most of the other All-Stars. He comes in when the team is struggling, puts them on his back and brings them back to life. He rarely lets us down. I feel bad that he didn’t make it because he really deserves it.'”"
