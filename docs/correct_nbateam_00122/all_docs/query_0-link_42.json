        "text": "New York Knicks point guard Brandon Jennings compared himself to arguably the greatest sixth man in NBA history: Los Angeles Clippers leader Jamal Crawford.\n\nBrandon Jennings has started 416 regular season and 11 postseason games during his seven-year NBA career. During that time, he’s accumulated regular season averages of 15.5 points, 5.9 assists, 3.1 rebounds, 1.3 steals, and 1.8 3-point field goals made per game.\n\nIn 2016-17, however, Jennings won’t be starting for the New York Knicks; he’ll be the sixth man.\n\nJennings may be entering unfamiliar territory, but his skill set is tailor made for the role he’s about to fill. He’s a volume shooter who can get as hot as any scorer in the NBA, but often runs into trouble by attempting to shoot his way out of slumps.\n\nJennings took to Twitter to loosely compare himself to arguably the greatest sixth man in NBA history: Jamal Crawford.\n\nThat’s actually a fair comparison.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Crawford is the only three-time Sixth Man of the Year in NBA history. The 36-year-old has enjoyed a 16-year career that will continue through the 2018-19 season.\n\nCrawford signed a three-year deal worth $42 million with the Los Angeles Clippers this past summer.\n\nIf Jennings can win even one Sixth Man of the Year award with the Knicks, he’d be of immense value to New York’s postseason push.\n\nThe Knicks have played home to three Sixth Man of the Year award winners. Anthony Mason won the award in 1994-95, John Starks took home the honors in 1996-97, and J.R. Smith won it in 2012-13.\n\nThe common thread: all three of those Knicks teams won at least 54 games.\n\nA 50-win season would be a dream come true for Knicks fans.\n\nHistory suggests the Knicks will prosper if Jennings manages to win Sixth Man of the Year in 2016-17. Unlike most players in the role, he has the unique ability to score and facilitate at a high level.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, Jennings has the unique distinction of having recorded both a 55-point game and a 21-assist performance.\n\nIn 2016-17, he’ll look to prove that he really is like Crawford on the court.\n\nMore from Daily Knicks\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
