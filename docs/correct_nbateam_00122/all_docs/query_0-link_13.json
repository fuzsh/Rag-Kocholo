        "text": "Immanuel Quickley may be gone but Jamal Crawford believes that the New York Knicks still have a viable Sixth Man of the Year candidate.\n\nNo stranger to heroics in relief, Crawford spoke about the modern Knicks' distinct advantage that they'll hold come playoff time, crediting the crowds that gather for games at Madison Square Garden as a vital x-factor in an interview with Betway.\n\n“I went to a playoff game there last year and it was unbelievable,\" Crawford recalled. \"Cleveland didn't have a chance because they were playing against the Knicks, but they felt like they were playing against the whole city, which was really cool.\"\n\n“They have the ingredients, and we all know when New York is raucous, it's a tough place to play.”\n\nCrawford is well used to hardwood heroics in relief, taking home the Sixth Man title on three occasions. He spent four seasons with the Knicks (2004-08) before his reputation as a reserve sparkplug was established but he never got to experience a Garden-hosted playoff run. Crawford was nonetheless welcomed back to take in the modern Knicks' five-game series victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, which earned their first postseason advancement since 2013.\n\nNew York was seeded fifth on last season's bracket but are now fighting for a top-four spot that will afford them homecourt advantage in the opening round. As it stands, the Knicks (36-26) are tied for fourth with the Orlando Magic, whom they face on Friday night at MSG (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG).\n\nCrawford never got to experience playoff time in New York but is intrigued by what the current group can do, especially based on their in-season transactions that have yielded Anunoby, Bojan Bogdanovic, and Alec Burks, who join a core led by Jalen Brunson.\n\nAnunoby and Randle are out indefinitely due to injuries but are expected to be back in time for the postseason.\n\n\"The Knicks are interesting because they can be a team that could definitely get to the playoffs, but I could see them struggling if it's the wrong matchup, but I can also see them going on a run if it's the right couple of matchups,\" Crawford said. “The way they're built with OG, Julius comes back healthy, Brunson could have been an All-Star last year.”\n\n“Their team is set up really nicely, they bought into what (head coach Tom Thibodeau) is doing, he's done a great job with those guys putting them in position. Now it's just about getting healthy and making that run and peaking at the right time.”"
