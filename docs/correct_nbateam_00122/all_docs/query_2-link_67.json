When you’re on the court, you’re just reacting. When you’re young, you think you can never get hurt. You’re like: “Get hurt? I just grew a new muscle. I don’t get hurt.” I don’t want them to overthink it and scare them. But I want it in the back of their mind and just introduce them to how to take care of their body. It’s so important. I would’ve played even longer if I knew the stuff I know now.\n\nSource: Bryan Kalbrosky @ For The Win\n\nWhat’s the buzz on Twitter?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BryanKalbrosky/status/1555538048393400321"
