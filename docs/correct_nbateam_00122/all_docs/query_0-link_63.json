        "text": "According to a recent report, the Knicks would like to bring Jamal Crawford back to New York.\n\nThe two-time Sixth Man of the Year played four seasons with New York, where he recorded career highs in minutes and total points. Crawford is in the final year of his contract and has maintained close ties with Knicks officials, including James Dolan and Isiah Thomas.\n\nMore from the Daily News:\n\nThe Knicks have expressed interest in acquiring Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, according to a source.\n\nThe Knicks would use the trade exception that they obtained from Cleveland in last yearâ€™s J.R. Smith trade. Coincidentally, the Cavs are also pursuing a deal for Crawford, the 35 year old former Sixth Man of the Year. Miami is another team that is also interested in Crawford."
