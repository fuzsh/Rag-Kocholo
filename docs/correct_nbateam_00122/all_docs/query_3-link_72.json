        "text": "HOUSTON – The Clippers locker room had almost completely emptied, as players hustled out into the Houston night for a rare chance to grab dinner and some drinks after a game.\n\nThe Clippers didn’t leave town until the next afternoon following their win over the Rockets, so there was good reason to get dressed up and head out on the town.\n\nBut after all his teammates had left, Jamal Crawford sat at his locker in Clippers sweats. He wasn’t going out for steaks or champagne; he was heading back to his hotel room.\n\nBut before he left, Crawford polled the people in the room.\n\n“If you didn’t know me,” he asked, “if you didn’t know the NBA, and you just watched me play, how old would you think I am?”\n\nCrawford turns 36 years old Sunday, a number he will pay zero attention to.\n\nWhen he talks about age, he gets Zen, asking philosophical questions without clear answers.\n\n“How old would you be if you didn’t know how old you were?” he asked. “Think about it. It’d be about how you feel.”\n\nAnd right now, Crawford feels great.\n\nFor maybe the fifth consecutive year, Crawford says he’s good to play for five more years.\n\nHe’s still got the baby face, he still has the high-arcing shot and he still has the crossover responsible for as many YouTube mixtapes as broken ankles.\n\n“I’m a product of clean living,” Crawford said.\n\nHe’s never smoked. He doesn’t drink, sipping alcohol only once in his life – on his wedding day.\n\nAs a result, he’s one of two players from the 2000 NBA Draft still in the NBA. In his 16th season, he’s squarely in the race for his third Sixth Man of the Year award, averaging more points off the bench than any other player on a team currently in the playoff race.\n\nSince Blake Griffin’s injury, Crawford has stepped up, averaging 15.5 points while the Clippers have gone 26-11.\n\n“He’s unique,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “I don’t know how he does it. When you look at him, he doesn’t look like he’s doing a lot of weightlifting and all that stuff. He really doesn’t.\n\n“He’s a baller.”\n\nAnd, that might be the key to his success. Crawford is always playing, even hosting a midnight pro-am game on the eve of his wedding.\n\n“If I took a bunch of time off and tried to come back and get into it, I’m sure my body would feel different,” he said. “… I hate being out of shape. I hate that process of it. You can be in shape forever, and it takes one week to get out of it. If you’re in shape, you can just keep going.”\n\nKeep going – it’s what Crawford wants to do.\n\n“God got me,” Crawford said. “I’m on a mission.”\n\nAnd, he won’t let age stop him."
