        "text": "According to Shams Charania of The Vertical, former Clippers guard Jamal Crawford reached an agreement yesterday to join the Minnesota Timberwolves:\n\nThe 37-year-old Crawford played the last five seasons with the Clippers before being dealt to the Atlanta Hawks last week in a three-team sign-and-trade deal that netted the Clippers Danilo Gallinari. The Hawks reached a buyout agreement to allow Crawford to hit free agency for what could be his last NBA contract.\n\nOne of Jamal’s biggest contributions to LAC was his veteran leadership. Several Clippers players, including Austin Rivers, have credited Crawford with mentoring them early in their LAC careers. When Crawford was a free agent last summer, the Clippers locker room essentially forced Doc Rivers to improve his offer to Jamal so as to not risk losing him. Jamal will bring the same kind of locker room leadership, with his calm, balanced persona, to a young Minnesota team looking to break through in the Western Conference playoff race next season."
