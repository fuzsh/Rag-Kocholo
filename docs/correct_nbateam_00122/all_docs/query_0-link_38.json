        "text": "The Knicks are nothing short of a mess right now.\n\nOn Episode 4 of the “Big Apple Buckets” podcast, Kazeem Famuyide was fired up about the Knicks’ blowout loss to the Cavaliers on Sunday. New York Post sports writer Zach Braziller drops by the studio to chat with Kaz about the 2-8 start to the season.\n\nThe guys discuss the unexpected postgame press conference from Knicks president Steve Mills and GM Scott Perry. Braziller argues that the duo cut coach David Fizdale’s legs out from under him by meeting with the media. They also talk about the roster Fizdale has been given and who could potentially replace him if the Knicks fired him, including whether Mark Jackson would be the answer.\n\nFormer Knicks guard, three-time NBA Sixth Man of the Year and current free agent Jamal Crawford then joins Kaz on the show. Crawford talks about his time in New York, the day he got traded by the Knicks and advice the sharpshooter would give RJ Barrett to address his struggles at the free-throw line.\n\nIf the Knicks called, would Crawford talk to them?\n\n“I definitely would talk to them,” he said. “Why not? My two favorite places to play in my career have been the Clippers and New York. Even when we weren’t the best team at the time, I just appreciated the fans. I appreciated the fan base. I appreciated the history. I appreciated everything that came with New York and I took pride in putting on that Knicks jersey. I only have two of my jerseys up in my house and that’s one of the two I have, a Knicks jersey. So if they called, I would definitely talk to them, to Steve Mills. He’s a friend of mine over the years.”\n\nThe Knicks could use help in the scoring department, and Crawford, who played for the Suns last season, has been a positive veteran in the locker room everywhere he has been.\n\nThis episode wraps up with a “From, The Fans” segment, a letter addressing the fans’ frustrations with the struggling Knicks."
