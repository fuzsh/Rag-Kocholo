        "text": "by Ryne Nelson\n\nSeveral early reports conflicted as to who Donnie Walsh would excommunicate from the Garden, but as the New York Post reports, Jamal Crawford will be getting on the next plane to join the Warriors.\n\nKnicks New York Knicks president Donnie Walsh is within hours of announcing a trade with the Warriors for Al Harrington that is expected to include Jamal Crawford in a move geared to get under the salary cap for 2010 rather than to help the present.\n\n‘Mal leaves the New York media microscope to play much closer to home. He’ll be in a similar atmosphere in Oakland under coach Don Nelson but potentially in a bench role behind Corey Maggette. Al Harrington won’t bring greatness to the Knicks, but he’ll bolster the Knicks’ weak inside presence. He’s the prototype D’Antoni big man.\n\nOh, and free David Lee!"
