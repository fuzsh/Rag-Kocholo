        "text": "Among the constant trade rumors surrounding both the LA Clippers and the New York Knicks, sources have reported that the Knicks do not have any interest in Clippers’ guard Jamal Crawford.\n\nCarmelo Anthony has been the main focus of trade talks as the NBA approaches the deadline. Both the LA Clippers and the Cleveland Cavaliers have emerged as the main potential suitors.\n\nRELATED STORY: Should the Clippers trade for Carmelo Anthony?\n\nAt one point, it was rumored that the Knicks would be interested in taking a combination of Clippers’ guards Jamal Crawford, Austin Rivers and J.J. Redick. However, today, sources have said that the Knicks do not have any interest in bringing Crawford back to The Big Apple.\n\nThat report came from Forbes’ Mitch Lawrence:\n\nAccording to industry sources, the Knicks don’t want to bring back Jamal Crawford, a player the Clips have offered. The ex-Knick still has three seasons at $45 million on his deal, and Jackson wants to avoid any lengthy deals. So the Clips and Knicks will need to find a third team to make the deal work, but it’s all elementary, anyway. Anthony can use his no-trade clause to veto any deal.\n\nJan 21, 2017; Denver, CO, USA; Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford (11) in the first quarter against the Denver Nuggets at the Pepsi Center. The Nuggets won 123-98. Mandatory Credit: Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLawrence also reported that President of Basketball Operations Phil Jackson is not asking for Blake Griffin, as his contract doesn’t work alongside Derrick Rose’s under the new CBA. A deal now would most likely involve dealing both Redick and Rivers, who Jackson has expressed interest in.\n\nCrawford, coming off of his NBA best 3rd Sixth Man of the Year award, is having a down season. He is currently averaging just 12 points on 40 percent shooting, while also contributing almost 3 assists per game.\n\nOver the summer, the Clippers, who couldn’t make any big moves due to the salary cap, re-signed Crawford for a 3 year deal, worth $45 million. They hoped his play could continue to elevate the bench, who prior to this season, solely relied on him.\n\nThe team, coming off of a loss to the Golden State Warriors, travel to Boston on Sunday.\n\nMore from Clipperholics\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
