        "text": "Several outlets are reporting that the Atlanta Hawks, New York Knicks and an unnamed third team are discussing a three team trade involving Hawks free agent guard Jamal Crawford. Matt Moore of ProBasketball Talk reports that Knicks guard Toney Douglas is one of the pieces involved in the trade. However, CBS sports NBA writer Ken Berger reports that Douglas is not involved in the current discussions.\n\nAfter receiving a lot of interest prior to the free agent period opening, things have been quiet in regards to Jamal Crawford since signings began. There was rumored interest in a sign-and-trade with Chicago that may or may not have been true but would seem to no longer be an option with former Pistons guard Richard Hamilton likely headed there.\n\nIts hard to speculate about the trade discussions with the Knicks until we know for sure who the third team is and who the Hawks could potentially receive. In his blog post last night, MC cautioned that Hawks GM Rick Sund still does not have the green light to approve a deal that results in a luxury tax payment for the Hawks. If that remains the case then these discussions could be a moot point without the Hawks first finding a way to unload some salary elsewhere to get further below the tax line.\n\n2:15 PM Updatevia Michael Cunningham Twitter\n\nHawks GM Sund: \"We have never been a taxpaying team and our goal is not to pay the tax. You never say never.\" No tax=No Crawford S & T"
