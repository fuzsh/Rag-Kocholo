        "text": "On August 5th, 2004, the Chicago Bulls signed-and-traded guard Jamal Crawford and traded forward Jerome Williams to the New York Knicks for forward Othella Harrington, centers Dikembe Mutombo and Cezary Trybanski and guard Frank Williams.\n\nJamal Crawford signed a seven-year, $56 million with Chicago and was subsequently traded to the Knicks along with Jerome Williams. Williams had four years, and $25 million left on his contract as well The deal saved the Bulls about $18 million in cap space because all of the players acquired by Chicago had expiring contracts.\n\nInitially, Crawford mulled the offer from the Knicks and that held up the trade Here’s his agent Aaron Goodwin’s explanation (via The Naperville Sun):\n\n“I say that `fair’ is a relative term. Jamal was always looking forward to becoming a New York Knick. But all he did was take time to think about the deal and sleep on it just as (Bulls operations chief) John Paxson and (Knick general manager) Isiah Thomas slept on it. Remember, it took six weeks to do this deal, but Crawford has accepted the contract offer, and from our perspective, we have a deal. All that we have to do now is sign documents, and I hope to have all that done no later than Friday because I’m going on a vacation next week.”\n\nThis trade helped the Bulls free up cap space and add flexibility. It also helped them sign Ben Wallace as a free agent two years down the line. This was another move where the Knicks added long-term salary while trading away expiring contracts. That played a huge role in the Knicks long stretch of losing seasons.\n\nCrawford averaged 11.2 ppg, 3.8 apg, 2.4 rpg, 26.0 mpg, while shooting 40% from the field, 82% from the free-throw line and 34% from three-point range in 244 games with Chicago.\n\nIn his last season with the Bulls, Crawford started 73 of the 80 games that he played and averaged a team-high 17.3 ppg, 5.1 apg, 3.5 rpg and 1.39 spg in 35.1 mpg, while shooting 39% from the field, 38% from the three-point line, and 83% from the charity stripe.\n\nJerome “The Junkyard Dog” Williams was acquired by the Bulls in December of 2003 in a multi-player deal between the Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls. Williams played in 53 games for Chicago and averaged 6.5 ppg, 6.5 rpg, and 1.2 apg, while shooting 47% from the field and 65% from the free-throw line.\n\nOthella Harrington was acquired by the Knicks in a mid-season trade with the Vancouver Grizzlies back in 2001. In 237 games with New York Harrington averaged 6.8 ppg and 4.6 rpg while shooting 52% from the field and 75% from the charity stripe.\n\nDikembe Mutombo played in 65 games and made 56 starts and averaged 5.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg and 1.89 bpg in 23.0 mpg in his only season with the Knicks.\n\nCezary Trybanski was acquired by the Knicks as a throw-in for the blockbuster deal that sent Stephon Marbury to New York. Trybanski only played in three games for New York after being acquire mid-season.\n\nIn 77 career games and two years with the Knicks, Frank Williams averaged 3.2 ppg and 2.0 apg in 11.4 mpg.\n\nAfter the trade, Crawford’s play with New York was a mixed bag. While he gained a reputation for exciting game-winners and streetball-esque moves, his lack of defense and shot selection were not up to par.\n\nDespite averaging 17.9 ppg and 4.4 apg in 299 games and roughly four seasons, Crawford never made the playoffs as a member of the Knicks. His record as a starter in New York was 80-141. His shooting numbers amounted to 41% from the field, 35% from the three-point line, and 84% from the free-throw line.\n\nJerome Williams played only one season with the Knicks averaging 4.5 ppg and 3.6 rpg in 79 games and 15.3 mpg while shooting 50% from the field and 67% from the charity stripe in his time with New York. After a new collective bargaining requirement was reached in 2005, the Knicks waived Williams under the amnesty provision and Williams subsequently retired from the NBA.\n\nHarrington was solid for Chicago playing a solid supporting role as a veteran for a young Chicago roster. In two seasons with the Bulls, Harrington averaged 6.4 ppg and 3.1 rpg while shooting 50% from the field and 68% from the free-throw line. Harrington was waived in the summer of 2006 by Chicago.\n\nMutombo was re-routed by the Bulls about a month later in a four-player deal to the Houston Rockets.\n\nTrybanski was waived by the Chicago Bulls a few months after the trade and never played in another NBA game after.\n\nFrank Williams played in only nine games with Chicago during the 2004-05 season. For the majority of the season, Williams was on injured reserve and after the 04-05 season, his contract was not renewed by Chicago.\n\nJamal Crawford (via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“While I’m happy to be going to New York, I’m also really sad to be leaving the Bulls. I’m going to miss my old teammates, especially my good friend Eddy Curry. I was serious when I said my first choice was to stay in Chicago. I wanted to help those guys turn things around there, but I’m looking forward to my new opportunity with the Knicks, and I wish my old teammates well.”\n\nOn time with Bulls and joining the Knicks (via Chicago Tribune):\n\n“New York is the ultimate stage. There is no bigger place to play basketball.”\n\n“I’m excited because I think I fit in well with the Knicks, but it’s bittersweet. Everything wasn’t always perfect in Chicago, but I grew up there as a person. Chicago will always be special to me. I just always felt underappreciated there. The fans were great, but (management) drafted point guards (Jay Williams and Kirk Hinrich) in back-to-back drafts. And they’ve always had the wrong perception of me as a player and as a person. I had the most attendance (for offseason workouts) last summer. I took the early bus (for pregame workouts on the road) all season. I led the team in scoring. It was never enough. It’ll be good to get a fresh start.”\n\nOn joining the Knicks (via ESPN.com):\n\n“They have a good, young core of guys who are professionals. I’ve been watching them for a while. I’ve been a fan from afar, and I’m just happy to be a part of it. There’s a Hall-of-Fame coach here and president. I can pick their brains at any time.”\n\nJerome Williams (via ESPN.com):\n\n“I had my best years under Coach Lenny. I know the players I’m playing with. I know the coach, I know the City. The Dog is built for New York. Boos, cheers, the whole thing. What I want to tell the fans is that this is going to be really exciting. You’ll be in for a treat. I can’t wait to get started. When the Dawg Pound comes playing, it’ll be something to see.”\n\nChicago Bulls executive vice president John Paxson (via Bulls.com):\n\n“Over the course of these negotiations we’ve stated all along, that if we were going to move Jamal Crawford, it would be imperative for us to receive financial flexibility from a cap standpoint. Not only does this deal help us in that regard, but the players that we acquired have added depth to our roster and will help us this season.”\n\nOn Jamal Crawford (via Chicago Sun-Times):\n\n“We think a lot of Jamal, and it’s always difficult to let a player like him go, but the reality is that the dollars he was going to be demanding would be tough for us to take on. This deal gives us financial flexibility for next year and even more for the following year.”\n\nOn Frank Williams:\n\n“Frank is a young player who hasn’t played a lot in his two years in the league. Going into year three, we expect him to get a chance to play some minutes in our backcourt and he will have the opportunity to prove himself.”\n\nOn Othella Harrington (via Chicago Tribune):\n\n“Those Georgetown guys are tough and physical. He’s a solid role player who isn’t afraid to mix it up.”\n\nOn Dikembe Mutombo (via ESPN.com):\n\n“I just know Dikembe through other people. The one thing I know about him is he’s a true professional. He’s been around league and seen a lot of things, and he has a great, positive attitude about this business. It’s going to be a wonderful thing for our young guys to learn from him.”\n\nNew York Knicks general manager Isiah Thomas (via ESPN.com):\n\n“He reminds me of myself in the way he handles the basketball and his ability to create and score. The ability to score and pass the ball are two things that he possesses. He’s a tremendous talent and I’m honored that he would choose No. 11 to wear.”\n\n“Last year when Allan (Houston) went down, we were saying that if he was healthy we’d be able to go further. Before we started this whole chase and pursued it, we talked about if Allan was healthy and we talked about his coming off the bench. He (Crawford) had no problem coming off the bench.”\n\n(via ESPN.com) “I definitely think [Crawford] is All-Star caliber. He and Steph [Marbury] and Allan [Houston], those three in the backcourt, if they’re all healthy, they’re just about as good as you can get.”\n\n(via Chicago Sun-Times) “He (Crawford) definitely is a lot taller than I was. From the way he handles the basketball and his ability to create, score and make plays for others, he’s a young player who is just now starting to understand his talent level. Getting him at 24 years old and a high-energy player like Jerome, a rebounding machine and a physical player, is just what we needed. If Allan [Houston] had been healthy we could have gone farther [in the playoffs] this year. Jamal now gives us added backcourt insurance.”\n\nOn Jerome Williams:\n\n“Jerome Williams is a rebounding machine. We forget the most important parts of the game is rebounding and scoring.”\n\nKnicks coach Lenny Wilkens (via ESPN.com):\n\n“I’d like us to play a little more up-tempo, but I’d like us to be smart enough that we know how to execute. I’ve seen Jamal play since he was in high school, and I’ve had the pleasure to work with Jerome [in Toronto]. I’ll tell you this, we will be exciting. We will be aggressive.”\n\nBulls center Eddy Curry (via The Naperville Sun):\n\n“Jamal didn’t want to be traded, but it’s just part of the business. You never know when you’re going to get traded. So you just have to learn to accept that. But we’ll still be good friends.”"
