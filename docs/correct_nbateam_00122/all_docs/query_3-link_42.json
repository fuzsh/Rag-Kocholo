        "text": "After 20 seasons in the league, veteran guard Jamal Crawford is retiring from the NBA.\n\n\"Goodbye to the game, all the spoils the adrenaline rush,\" Crawford said in a tweet early Monday morning. \"Thank you basketball, I owe you everything …\"\n\nCrawford turned 42 years old on Sunday. Over his 20 seasons, Crawford played for nine different teams, with his longest stint being five full seasons with the Clippers from 2012 to 2017. While he was selected with the No. 8 pick in the 2000 NBA Draft by the Cavaliers, he began his career with the Bulls after being traded on draft day.\n\nCrawford also played for the Knicks, Warriors, Hawks, Trail Blazers, Timberwolves, Suns and the Nets. He has not played a game since appearing in one game for Brooklyn during the 2019-20 season.\n\nA three-time Sixth Man of the Year recipient, Crawford averaged a career-best 20.6 points per game for New York during the 2007-08 season — a season he started all 80 games he played in.\n\nCrawford still holds the league record for regular-season four-point plays with 55 in his career, and 60 when including postseason play.\n\n(Photo: Chris Elise / NBAE via Getty Images)\n\nWhat legacy does Crawford leave?\n\nSam Amick, NBA senior writer: Crawford just loved to play ball — like, he LOVED to play ball. Yes, that might sound simple and cliché.' But in 18 years of doing this, I'm not sure I've covered someone who loved to play ball more. Or, to be more specific, someone who helped the fans and media truly understand why he loved the game.\n\nNine teams, 20 years, 19,419 points and countless crossovers later, he retires with as unique a legacy as you'll ever find.\n\nOne moment he will be remembered by\n\nAmick: Jamal scored more than 50 points four times in the 1,327 regular-season games he played, but none was more memorable than the 51 he put on Dallas on April 9, 2019. It was a meaningless end-of-the-season affair between two bad teams — or so it seemed until he got going.\n\nBy the end of it all — after Crawford hit 18-of-30 shots, 7-of-13 3-pointers and even added five assists and five rebounds for good measure — the then-39-year-old had become the oldest player in league history to have a 50-point game. Truth be told, with his one-game stint in Brooklyn replacing this as his final game, it was a shame he didn't have a chance to keep entertaining the basketball-loving masses in the years that followed.\n\nCrawford’s announcement:"
