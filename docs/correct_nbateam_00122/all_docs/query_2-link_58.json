        "text": "The last time Jamal Crawford played in an NBA game, he scored 51 points on 60 percent shooting at a young 39 years old.\n\nNow the Nets are hoping he can pick up where he left off in Orlando.\n\nThe Nets have finalized a contract with Crawford as one of their replacement players for the NBA’s restart, per The Athletic’s Shams Charania, who also reports that the team is progressing toward a deal with veteran forward Michael Beasley. Brooklyn had three open roster spots as of Tuesday after Spencer Dinwiddie and Taurean Prince were ruled out due to positive tests for COVID-19. It was reported in late June that the Nets planned to use a roster spot on Justin Anderson, who starred with the Long Island Nets this season, but as of Wednesday night, Anderson remained unsigned. Brooklyn has also been linked to forwards Amir Johnson and Lance Thomas, the latter of whom spent the preseason with the Nets. Beasley and Durant have been friends since childhood and remain close.\n\nBy signing Crawford and Beasley, general manager Sean Marks indicated the Nets have every intention of being competitive when they restart the season against the Magic on July 31. Brooklyn will be without seven players in Orlando, three due to injury (Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and Nicolas Claxton), three due to positive tests for COVID-19 (Dinwiddie, Prince and DeAndre Jordan) and an opt-out in Wilson Chandler, who has elected to take care of his family instead of playing in Orlando.\n\nThe attrition has left the Nets with a young core led by Caris LeVert, Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen, but not much size or experience after them. Brooklyn will restart the season just a half-game up on Orlando for the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference and six games up on Washington, the No. 9 team. The Wizards will be without Bradley Beal due to a shoulder injury and Davis Bertans, a pending free agent with an injury history that factored into his decision to sit out the restart.\n\nConsidered one of the best ball handlers in history, Crawford is one of only two players to win the Sixth Man of the Year Award three times and is the league’s all-time leader in four-point plays. He has averaged 14.6 points per game on 41 percent shooting over his career. The Nets are Crawford’s eighth team; he last played for the Suns last season but went unsigned prior to Wednesday. Crawford had been attempting to make a comeback throughout the season. In his last game with Phoenix, Crawford made history, becoming the oldest player to score 50 or more points in a game. Against the Mavericks, Crawford scored 51 points on 60 percent shooting and went 7-for-13 from 3-point territory. He gives the Nets another veteran scorer to ease the offensive burden on LeVert, a fellow Michigan product, and a player who can get a basket when the Nets are struggling to score, which is something they have lacked at times during the season. He instantly becomes the elder statesman in terms of playoff experience, having played 74 career postseason games.\n\nWhile signing the 6-foot-5 guard helps the Nets offensively, it also keeps the front-court depth thin, and the lack of size remains an issue. On Saturday, interim coach Jacque Vaughn said he had talked to Marks that morning about possibly addressing the lack of size with one of the open roster spots. Jordan, Claxton and Durant are near-7-footers and the absence of Chandler and Prince, who are 6-9, makes Allen, at 6-11, and the trio of Dzanan Musa, Rodions Kurucs and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, all of whom are 6-9, the Nets’ tallest players. Luwawu-Cabarrot joked with reporters this past week that he might have to play center to help keep the stress off Allen at times.\n\nAn 11-year NBA veteran, Beasley gives the Nets some size as a 6-9 forward, but mainly plays as a small forward or stretch-4, which doesn’t change the lack of depth behind Allen. Vaughn might have to take up Luwawu-Cabarrot’s offer and play small with five shooters on the court at times to give Allen a break and protect him from foul trouble.\n\nBeasley played in China in 2019 and was last with the Lakers in the NBA for the 2018-19 season, but was away from the team at times to take care of his sick mother. For his career, he’s averaged 12.4 points and 4.7 rebounds per game on 47 percent shooting. The 31-year-old has been to the postseason with three different teams and has played in 25 playoff games and like Crawford, helps offset Brooklyn’s lack of playoff experience on the roster. Beasley won’t be able to immediately play for the Nets because he will have to serve a 5-game suspension for violating the NBA’s Anti-Drug policy in April 2019. Beasley’s first game for the Nets would be on Aug. 9 against the Clippers.\n\nAssuming he signs, Anderson is a 6-6 wing who helps the Nets defensively and gives them another perimeter player. The 26-year-old played alongside Harris at Virginia and was signed to a 10-day contract with the Nets in January. They added him to their G League team, the Long Island Nets, shortly after waiving him. Anderson has been unsigned for 10 days after reports of a reunion with Brooklyn, which puts into question if it still plans to sign him. Assuming Anderson signs, the Nets will have one remaining roster spot to fill.\n\nThey have already signed veteran guard Tyler Johnson, who played alongside Crawford in Phoenix in 2018-19, giving him a rapport with a fellow newcomer. Crawford also has ties to Jordan and Chandler, whom he played with on the Clippers and Knicks, respectively, but won’t get the chance to do so in the bubble. The Nets arrived in Orlando on Tuesday and entered the bubble shortly after, with the first team’s first practice expected to be on Thursday. It’s unknown how quickly Crawford and Beasley will be able to join the Nets in Florida.\n\n(Photo: Bill Baptist / NBAE via Getty Images)"
