        "text": "Jamal Crawford is a hooper.\n\nSome people love basketball, and there is Jamal Crawford, who loves the game of basketball.\n\nAt 40 years old, Crawford has been in the NBA for 20 years and played for nine different NBA teams. Last season, he only played one game for the Brooklyn Nets. After a solid run for the Phoenix Suns in 2018-19, he remained without a team for most of the 2019-20 season. Right as the NBA's bubble in Disney World began, he got the Brooklyn Nets call.\n\n\"The bubble experience was great for me,\" Crawford told me in an email. \"Getting that call to continue my career was exciting. I enjoyed being around the guys; it was almost like going to basketball camp as a kid, to be honest.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the legendary 3x 6th Man of The Year award winner got injured during the first game with a strained hamstring.\n\n\"Didn't get a chance to play after the one game I did with the injury, but overall good experience,\" he said.\n\nRight now, he is at home in Washington state. After 20 years of 82 game seasons and extensive travel, the downtime has given him a chance to be with his family. Most of his day revolves around working out and spending time with the family.\n\nThe 6'5\" 185 lbs guard may have gotten hurt during his first game with the Nets, but he has proven durability over the final years of his career. During his last season with the Clippers in 2016-17, he played 80/82 regular-season games the following season with the Timberwolves, he played all 82 games, and in 2018-19, he played in 64 games with the Suns.\n\nThe last time that Crawford played on an NBA court with fans in attendance, he scored 51 points on 60% shooting, tallied five rebounds and dished out five assists off of the bench.\n\n\"I feel 100% healthy, was playing full-court all the time again before this last lockdown,\" he said. \"So now, just individual work. But I feel really, really good.\"\n\nThere is no telling that the NBA has been going younger through the last few seasons. However, someone like Crawford can help on the floor and be a mentor off the court. Vince Carter played the previous season at 43-year-old and helped the young Hawks build a foundation in the last two seasons. Crawford can be that kind of player for a team in need of veteran leadership.\n\nEven at his age, there are still things he wants to improve upon to be a better basketball player. His work ethic can be a role model for some of the younger players on a team.\n\n\"I work on all facets of my game. I love being in the gym, outside, whatever,\" he said. \"Challenging my mind, body, to be better. Watch a lot of film of myself, others.\n\nCrawford has made over $120 million in NBA career earnings, according to Spotrac, and as for off the court, he says he invests money into the stock market.\n\n\"I would say I have a healthy, balanced portfolio,\" he said. I'm not the guy looking for the home run. I'll just hit the singles if that makes sense.‚Äù\n\nOverall, Crawford is a healthy, savvy veteran who many NBA players could look up to and learn from his experiences.\n\nAn NBA team should make the call."
