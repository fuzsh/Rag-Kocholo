The New York Knicks will pursue a shooting guard in free agency. Could Jamal Crawford be an option?

Jamal Crawford was with the New York Knicks from 2004-2008, smack dab in the middle of the Isiah Thomas nightmare. You’d think Crawford’s memories of New York would be terrible. Apparently not.

Crawford told the NY Daily News he “really enjoyed” his time in New York, raising the question of whether he’s an option to return.

Since his time in New York, Crawford has developed a reputation as an elite one on one scorer you can count on for a bucket down the stretch.

The Knicks were 20th in bench scoring during the 2015-16 season, so they could use help from one of the greatest bench scorers in league history. Crawford proved he can still be productive at age 36 after winning his record third Sixth Man of the Year Award with the Los Angeles Clippers.

Crawford enjoyed success while in New York. In 299 games, he averaged 17.6 points, 4.4 assists, and 2.9 rebounds, on a slash line of .407/.353/.840.
