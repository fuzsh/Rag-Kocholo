After leaving the Chicago Bulls, Jamal Crawford joined the New York Knicks, another young and rebuilding team, at the start of the 2004–05 NBA season. In his first year with the Knicks, Crawford made a significant impact, playing 70 games, with 67 starts, and averaging 17.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.4 steals per game. He showcased his scoring ability in games like the one against the Charlotte Bobcats on December 4, where he scored 41 points on 17-of-25 shooting. However, despite his contributions, the Knicks fell short of making the playoffs.

In the following season, 2005–06, Crawford transitioned into a reduced role coming off the bench as the sixth man under head coach Larry Brown. Despite initial adjustments, Crawford embraced his new role and averaged 14.3 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 3.8 assists across 79 games, with 27 starts. However, the Knicks finished the season with a disappointing record of 23–59, missing out on the playoffs once again.

The 2006–07 season saw changes in leadership for the Knicks as Isiah Thomas took over as head coach. Crawford's season was marred by an ACL injury, limiting him to 59 games, with 36 starts. Despite the injury, he managed to average 17.6 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game.

Returning for the 2007–08 season, Crawford regained his spot in the starting lineup for all 80 games he played. He had an impressive season, averaging 20.6 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 5 assists per game. One of the highlights of his time with the Knicks came on January 26, 2007, when he scored a career-high 52 points in a game, showcasing his scoring prowess.

However, Crawford's time with the Knicks came to an end during the 2008–09 season when he was traded to the Golden State Warriors after playing only 11 games for the Knicks, in exchange for Al Harrington.

Jamal Crawford seamlessly adapted to the fast-paced style of play employed by coach Don Nelson upon joining the Golden State Warriors during the 2008–09 NBA season. His exceptional three-point shooting, ball-handling skills, and court vision made him an invaluable asset to the team's offensive strategy. Crawford made an immediate impact, playing in all 54 games for the Warriors and starting each one. He averaged close to 20 points per game, along with 4.4 assists and 1.5 rebounds.

One standout performance during his tenure with the Warriors came on December 20, 2008, in a thrilling 110–103 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. Crawford exploded for 50 points in that game, joining an elite group of NBA players—Wilt Chamberlain, Bernard King, and Moses Malone—as one of only four players in league history to score 50 or more points with three different teams.

However, Crawford's time with the Warriors was short-lived, as he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks at the end of the season in exchange for guards Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.

Jamal Crawford made an immediate impact upon joining the Atlanta Hawks for the 2009–10 NBA season. One of his standout moments came on January 15 when he nailed a buzzer-beating three-point shot to secure a thrilling 102–101 victory over the Phoenix Suns. Additionally, Crawford set an all-time NBA record for the most career four-point plays during a win over the Los Angeles Clippers on February 3, 2010, surpassing Reggie Miller.

Despite coming off the bench behind All-Star guards Joe Johnson and Mike Bibby, Crawford showcased his scoring prowess, averaging 18 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 2 assists per game. His stellar performance earned him the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award for the 2009–10 season.

During the playoffs, Crawford played a crucial role in helping the Hawks advance past the Milwaukee Bucks in a hard-fought seven-game series. He led all scorers in the decisive Game 7 with 22 points. However, the Hawks were subsequently swept by the Orlando Magic, led by Dwight Howard, in the following round.

In the 2010–11 season, under new coach Larry Drew, Crawford continued to excel despite coming off the bench. Although his statistics saw a slight decline from the previous season, he still contributed significantly, averaging 14.2 points, 1.7 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. Crawford's clutch performances, including a game-winning three-pointer in Game 3 against the Orlando Magic, helped the Hawks secure a playoff berth once again. However, they were eliminated in the conference semifinals by the Chicago Bulls in six games.
