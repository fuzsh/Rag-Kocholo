Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings is paving the way for neo-soul. Formed in 1996 out of Brooklyn, the music the band plays intends to revive the funk/soul music as it was heard in the 60s and 70s.

Their new album, “Give The People What They Want”, has more character and emotional value than ever before. The album was supposed to be released in the spring of 2013 followed by a tour. However, the life-blood member of the band, Sharon Jones, was tragically diagnosed with cancer. The album was postponed until Jones was well enough to promote it and go on tour, which was January 14th of this year. So Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are back on stage with great, new songs.

Jones’ style is sassy and confident and many of my favorite tracks on the album reflect this, namely, “Now I See”, “You’ll Be Lonely”, and “Stranger To My Happiness” (check out the music video below). Her voice is authentic and rich and full of substance. The music is buzzing with vivacity through vintage horns, percussion, and stringed instruments.

Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are featured in Michael Buble’s song, “Baby You’ve Got What It Takes” and the Dap-Kings played in a number of Amy Winehouse songs, including “Rehab”.

Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings are on tour with more soul, passion and vigor than ever with “Give The People What They Want”. I would not only recommend checking out their music, but also seeing them live at The Englert March 5th.
