Ooh, well, well

Give the people

Give the people, whoa

Give the people what they want

They want justice

Give the people what they want

They want freedom, yes

Give the people what they want

They want love inside now

Give the people what they want

They want equal rights

Look how long you been trying to breathe, well

Look how long you′ve been trying your mockery

Tried it from the first generation

You spread the germ of sinfulness

Upon this here land, but no

Just can't work

No longer

Just can′t work

No more

Just can't work

No longer my friends

So here me say:

Give the people what they want

They want justice

Give the people what they want

They want love inside

Oh won't you keep them down

Keep them down

Keep them down

Oh won′t you give them

Look how long we′ve been-a fighting

Look how long you've been fighting

The time has come

The time has come

The time has come and you′re gonna pay

Oh well, oh well,

But I'm gonna give you one last warning

So change

So give the people what they want

Give the people what they want

They want justice, oh well

Give the people what they want

They want love inside

Give the people what they want

They want freedom, oh well

Give them

So won′t you give them now

Won't you give them

Give them, oh give them

Oh give them the love

Give them, oh give them

Oh give them the love

That they need

Oh well

Give the people what they want

They want justice
