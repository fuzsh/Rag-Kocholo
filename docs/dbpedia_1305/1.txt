(Sung by the Poet)

I don't think I can keep on knocking myself out anymore

I'm being buried by those I don't respect

I guess I never could face the truth before

That 'Sensation' is the synonym we use today for art

And if you want to be successful in this world

You got to give the people what they want

A sleight of hand, a degraded man, or perhaps a dirty song

Titillation's the best distraction

From dragging this old world along

Never mind the public good or doing what you think you should

You gotta give the people what they want

They won't listen anyway to a single word you say

You gotta give the people what they want

Damn your conscience, lies are fine

But don't forget the Bottom Line

You have to give the people what they want

Pearls to swine wastes your time

When they're deaf, dumb and blind

We got to give the people what they want

(Sung by the Clergy:)

We never stray too far away from our formula for success

People love a good mystery and the way we dress

Make the innocent feel guilty and they'll pay through the nose

But let the guilty start to feel a little innocent

That's when the real money starts to flow

Jesus was so revolutionary and difficult to please

Salvation's much easier with payoffs and false pieties

We'll exchange your tithe for greed; absolution's guaranteed

We only give the people what they want

Hocus-Pocus Domini and all that cryptic liturgy

We love to give the people what they want

A ring to kiss, a sip of wine, and damn you if you're out of line

We have to give the people what they want

God is too complex for you, just relax, we'll pull you through

We always give the people what they want

(Sung by the Nobility:)

We aristocrats have found the situation to be ideal

Laws were made for the little men we grind beneath our heel

We got on top so long ago by convincing the common man

To respect his betters, keep his place and appreciate the plan

We oppress with their consent and this right to rule we flaunt

Because we only exist to give you exactly what you want

The people have to have a king, so they can be his underling

You gotta give the people what they want

They'll kill themselves to make our tax

And carry us upon their backs

We love to give the people what they want

We could never subjugate if they did not cooperate

We only give the people what they want

Enlisting in the lie of caste, they thrive no matter how debased

You've got to give the people what they want

(All the people sing:)

And just like a giant tidal wave

The public sweeps along the latest rave

What's the use of fighting? Why don't you get smart?

Just don't aim so high, and then you'll hit the mark

Plundering economists, how do we get away with this?

By giving all the people what they want

Dispensing bread and circuses is how we line our own purses

You gotta give the people what they want

Only meet a basic need, your claim to fame is guaranteed

You have to give the people what they want

Don't moan about the way things are

Just sell your soul and you'll go far

Wake up and give the people what they want

And on some happy day we'll all begin again

Lumbering toward that inexorable end

Call it karma, it's inevitable

Even now it's being written on the wall

Let the world go up in flames, we are not the ones to blame

We only gave the people what they want

The downward spiral starts its flux

As Man becomes the things he does

We have to give the people what they want

Let the Devil take his turn, the lesson is we never learn

We gotta give the people what they want

Let the future go to hell, as long as we can make out well

We'll always give the people what they want!

We have to give the people what they want!

We want to give the people what they want!

You gotta give the people what they want!

You better give the people what they want!
