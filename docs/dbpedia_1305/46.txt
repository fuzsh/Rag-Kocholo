Lyrics

Give the people what you know they really want Give the people what they want Never what they ask for Never what they need They don't really want to need no more Give em what they want Give them beating hearts and sweaty palms Give them right and give them wrong Give them hope and give them closure Give them answers no one knows They won't catch on Give the people what you know they really want Give the people a distraction Give them entertainment Give them all the tools they need to build a better life and tell them they don't want it We don't want it We want children we can't care for Houses we can't pay for Jobs we can't stay awake for Schools that we can't raise for Laws we can't account for Who could want more? Give us what we want A moment in the sun Until the light don't come And it don't come back up We can't make this right But we've still got tonight Give the people what they want Give the people what you know they really want Give the people violence Give the people peace Give the people silence Let the people speak Give them new prescriptions So they don't have to think Give them television So they don't wanna blink Give them new perspectives Give them old traditions Give them all the answers So they don't have to listen Give the people what you know they really want A motherfucking show Give the people what you know they really want
