Why don't you get smart?\n\nJust don't aim so high, and then you'll hit the mark\n\nPlundering economists, how do we get away with this?\n\nBy giving all the people what they want\n\nDispensing bread and circuses is how we line our own purses\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nOnly meet a basic need, your claim to fame is guaranteed\n\nYou have to give the people what they want\n\nDon't moan about the way things are\n\nJust sell your soul and you'll go far\n\nWake up and give the people what they want\n\nAnd on some happy day we'll all begin again\n\nLumbering toward that inexorable end\n\nCall it karma, it's inevitable\n\nEven now it's being written on the wall\n\nLet the world go up in flames, we are not the ones to blame\n\nWe only gave the people what they want\n\nThe downward spiral starts its flux\n\nAs Man becomes the things he does\n\nWe have to give the people what they want\n\nLet the Devil take his turn, the lesson is we never learn\n\nWe gotta give the people what they want\n\nLet the future go to hell, as long as we can make out well\n\nWe'll always give the people what they want!\n\nWe have to give the people what they want!\n\nWe want to give the people what they want!\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want!\n\nYou better give the people what they want!\n\nEND"
