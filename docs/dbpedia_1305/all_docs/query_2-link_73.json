The album was nominated for \"Best R&B Album\" at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. While many artists have come and gone, why have Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings only continued to grow steadily in popularity around the world? How can they continue to sell-out huge theaters, headline festivals, and sell hundreds of thousands of records year after year with neither major label support nor a single radio hit? The reason is simple: There is no other band around today that plays with the rhythm, feeling, or explosive power of the Dap-Kings, and there is no other singer that can match the energy and honest soul of Sharon Jones.\n\nThe culmination of these soulful attributes has never been so meticulously manifested as on their latest waxen treasure, Give The People What They Want. Its all here, from Retreat, the lushly orchestrated barnstormer, to the feel-good cruiser We Get Along, and the floaty balladry of Slow Down Love. Give The People What They Want is an exercise in Soul Music of the highest order, but more than that, it s a document of what happens when you fill a studio with some of the finest musicians and songwriters in the world and let the tape roll. The Baddest Band In All The Land are at the TOP of their game.\n\n\"These ten songs sound almost designed to be played on repeat, and keep with the always colorful and ecstatically fun sound audiences have come to expect from one of the best acts going in retrofitted classic soul.\" -Fred Thomas, allmusic.com\n\nFeatures:\n\n 150g Vinyl\n\n Stereo\n\n Includes coupon for MP3 download with bonus material\n\nSelections:\n\nSide One:\n\n1. Retreat!\n\n2. Stranger To My Happiness\n\n3. We Get Along\n\n4. You'll Be Lonely\n\n5. Now I See\n\nSide Two:\n\n1. Making Up and Breaking Up (and Making Up and Breaking Up Over Again)\n\n2. Get Up and Get Out\n\n3. Long Time, Wrong Time\n\n4. People Don't Get What They Deserve\n\n5. Slow Down, Love"
