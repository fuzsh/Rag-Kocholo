        "text": "A processed food is any food or drink that has been changed in some way when it’s made or prepared. Most foods we eat are processed in some way.\n\nProcessing can be used to:\n\nmake foods safe, for example milk is pasteurised to remove harmful bacteria\n\nmake foods suitable for use, such as pressing seeds to make oil\n\npreserve foods or help them last longer, such as tinned or frozen foods\n\nchange how food tastes, such as adding salt or sweeteners\n\ncreate ready meals and snacks\n\nUltra-processed foods\n\nSometimes the term ultra-processed foods (UPF) is used to refer to some processed foods and drinks. These have been through more processing than other foods.\n\nUltra-processed foods often include ingredients you would not usually have at home, such as preservatives, sweeteners and emulsifiers.\n\nUltra-processed foods include things like:\n\nsweetened drinks\n\ncrisps\n\npackaged cakes and biscuits\n\nice cream\n\nsweets and chocolate\n\nsome ready meals\n\npackaged meat pastries like pies and pasties\n\nProcessed foods in a healthy diet\n\nNot all processed foods are unhealthy, but many ultra-processed foods are high in calories, saturated fat, salt or sugar.\n\nEating too many calories, too much saturated fat, salt and sugar, and not enough fruit and vegetables and fibre is not good for you.\n\nDiets high in ultra-processed foods have been linked to an increased risk of health conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It’s not known if ultra-processed foods are unhealthy due to the processing or because of the calories, fat, salt and sugar they contain.\n\nEating a lot of processed and red meat is also linked with an increased risk of bowel cancer.\n\nSome ultra-processed foods can be included in a healthy diet – such as wholemeal sliced bread, wholegrain or higher fibre breakfast cereals or baked beans.\n\nMost people would probably benefit from eating less ultra-processed foods that are high in saturated fat, salt or sugar. These foods are not needed in our diet, so should be eaten less often and in smaller amounts.\n\nA healthy diet includes plenty of fruit, vegetables and wholegrain or higher fibre starchy carbohydrates such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice and whole oats.\n\nFind out what to foods to include for a healthy, balanced diet with the Eatwell Guide."
