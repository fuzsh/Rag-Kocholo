        "text": "Six years after announcing that he would embark on a special tour during which he would perform ACCEPT songs one last time under the DIRKSCHNEIDER banner before closing that chapter for good, former ACCEPT frontman Udo Dirkschneider is continuing to play ACCEPT material at select shows, including at the September 18, 2020 U.D.O. concert in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which was released on DVD and Blu-ray this past March. Speaking to El Cuartel Del Metal about why the ACCEPT tracks are still finding their way into the U.D.O. setlist, Udo said (as transcribed by BLABBERMOUTH.NET): \"I know I said I after the DIRKSCHNEIDER thing — we did it for nearly three years and nearly three hundred shows — after that, I said, 'Okay. Come on. That's enough. I don't wanna play ACCEPT songs anymore.' But in the meanwhile, it's already, yeah, nearly three years ago, and now the people say, 'Well, maybe you can play 'Balls [To The Wall]' and 'Metal Heart', 'Princess [Of The Dawn]' and 'Fast As A Shark'.' Yeah, okay. In a way, I mean, give the people what they want — let's say it in this way. And the people wanna hear that — they wanna hear old classic stuff. But it's getting more and more — more songs. But we try always to make it as interesting as possible. And in the end, of course, some people come up and [say], 'Oh, why are you not playing this song? Why are you not playing this song? And this song?' But, yeah, okay. Here we go.\"\n\nThis past March, Udo confirmed to Canada's The Metal Voice that U.D.O. will \"definitely\" play some ACCEPT songs if the band's North American tour materializes in 2022.\n\nWhen he first announced the DIRKSCHNEIDER tour more than half a decade ago, Udo said that had \"to make a clear break for myself — close the book and this is it. And I have the problem that people come to me and ask me to play more ACCEPT songs,\" he explained. \"Other people ask me why I play ACCEPT songs at all, because there are [more than] fifteen U.D.O. records. I want to avoid such things and avoid the repeating questions concerning ACCEPT. I just can't stand that anymore. There is nothing more to be said. U.D.O. exists longer than ACCEPT. We have more records than ACCEPT.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that some ACCEPT fans want to hear the band's classic songs performed by the group's original singer, Dirkschneider explained at the time that \"you always have these comparisons [between how these songs are played by ACCEPT and U.D.O.]. I don't want this anymore either. [The current lineup of ACCEPT] also play 'Metal Heart', they play 'Balls To The Wall' and 'Princess Of The Dawn'. And then some people tell me, 'Oh, [current ACCEPT singer Mark Tornillo] is doing it better than you.' And I go, 'That's fine. Enjoy yourself.' But I don't want this anymore. And to avoid all of this in the future, I said, 'We are doing this one more time.'\"\n\nDirkschneider said in 2016 that his vow to never play ACCEPT material again came with one caveat. \"If the band ACCEPT dissolves one day in the near future and I am still around with U.D.O., then there is a chance that I put ACCEPT songs back in the setlist,\" he said. \"But currently there is ACCEPT, so go see them [if you want to see those songs performed live]. They are playing these songs.\"\n\nUdo previously said the original plan was for DIRKSCHNEIDER to only \"a few shows,\" and \"then [the tour] got bigger and bigger [due to demand].\" But, he added, \"I don't want to complain about that.\"\n\nBack in 2018, ACCEPT guitarist Wolf Hoffmann declined to comment on Dirkschneider's decision to embark on one final tour during which the singer would perform nothing but ACCEPT songs. \"I have lots of thoughts about that, but I'm not gonna share 'em with you,\" he told SiriusXM's \"Trunk Nation With Eddie Trunk\". \"I'd rather not comment on that, because that seems so much 'back and forth,' and I think I should stay away from it… You can draw your own conclusions all day long, but I'm not gonna get into it; it's just not worth it.\n\n\"I get asked [about Udo] so many times, and, man, it's been so many years — it's such an old story by now,\" Wolf continued. \"We've moved on way past that, and we've had 10 brilliant years [with Mark Tornillo], we're making cool albums; I think we're doing fine. So I don't spend any time thinking about it."
