        "meta_description": "Give the People What They WantÂ is the 19th studio album by The Kinks. It was released in August 1981 in the US, but not until January 1982 in Europe. It was delayed because lead singer Ray Davies wanted to produce a full-length video for the album but financing fell through. Also scrapped were plans to remix the album for the European market. It was initially aimed to be a statement on the media. I love this album",

they get harder and harder to please\n\nThe Roman promoters really did things right.\n\nThey needed a show that would clearly excite.\n\nThe attendance was sparse so they put on a fight\n\nThrew the Christians to the lions, sold out every night\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nThe more they get, the more they need\n\nAnd every time they get harder and harder to please\n\nGive 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape\n\nGive 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nWhen Olswald shot Kennedy, he was insane\n\nBut still we watch the re-runs again and again\n\nWe all sit glued while the killer takes aim\n\n\"Hey Mom, there goes a piece of the president's brain!\"\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nBlow out your brains, and do it right\n\nMake sure it's prime time and on a Saturday night.\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nYou gotta give the people what they want\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nI see so little hope in you,\n\nSo much despair,\n\nAs I look in your eyes I wonder,\n\nWhat thoughts linger there.\n\nLife means nothing to you,\n\nAt least that's what they say,\n\nBut it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.\n\nHow were we to know what was going on inside your mind.\n\nYou never let it show what was going on behind\n\nThose killer's eyes\n\nKiller's eyes\n\nYou've seen your picture in the paper.\n\nYou're little sister's pinned it on the wall.\n\nShe thinks you're in some kind of movie.\n\nImagine her surprise when she saw you on the news.\n\nReporters came around and asked for interviews.\n\nSo little compassion, so icy cool.\n\nThey say you were a poor boy, you know that life can be cruel.\n\nHate builds up from childhood, your world was a slum\n\nBut you haven't got the right to blow it to kingdom come\n\nHow could we know what it was like inside a killer's mind\n\nIt never really showed, you kept the secret deep inside\n\nThose killer's eyes\n\nKiller's eyes\n\nYou say the world is full of bullshit,\n\nSo you kill just as you see fit.\n\nThey say that you're a fanatic with a mission.\n\nWe all go through hell in some kind of way,\n\nCan you tell me what it's like to be there every day?\n\nWhen you were young you had a vision\n\nWhy'd you go and do a thing like that?\n\nAnd now we see you on the television.\n\nImagine our surprise when we saw you on the news,\n\nAnd reporters came around and asked for interviews.\n\nI see so little hope in you,\n\nSo much despair,\n\nAs I look in your eyes I wonder,\n\nWhat thoughts linger there.\n\nLife means nothing to you,\n\nAt least that's what they say,\n\nBut it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.\n\nWhen you were just a child\n\nYou'd hide away when other children cried\n\nBut how were we to know\n\nThese tears that flowed were from a killer's eyes\n\nI see so little hope in you,\n\nSo much despair,\n\nAs I look in your eyes I wonder,\n\nWhat thoughts linger there.\n\nLife means nothing to you,\n\nAt least that's what they say,\n\nBut it doesn't mean that you have the right to take life away.\n\nThose killer's eyes\n\nSee the whites of their eyes\n\nThose killer's eyes\n\nSee the whites of their eyes\n\nDon't know why I'm even bothering.\n\n(Predictable)\n\nYeah, that's the mood I'm in.\n\nGo out for a walk then I come back in.\n\n(Predictable)\n\nYeah, the mood that I'm in.\n\n(Predictable)\n\nEvery day of my life\n\nCan't even communicate with my wife\n\n(Predictable)\n\nThat's the word of the year\n\n(Predictable)\n\nAll I see, all I hear.\n\nGo to my office, sit at my desk,\n\nPredictably just like all of the rest.\n\nI sit and I dream about far away places,\n\nAway from the people with frowns on their faces.\n\nAll of my life is monotony\n\nI'd go out for a walk but I know it would be\n\n(Predictable)\n\nSure as the nose on my face\n\n(Predictable)\n\nSame for the whole human race\n\nOnce we (once we) had so many options\n\nOnce we (once we) had dignity and grace\n\nNow we (now we) have got nothing but our own time to waste.\n\n(Predictable)\n\nYeah, that's the word of the year\n\n(Predictable)\n\nAll I see, all I hear\n\nWhy can't it be like never before?\n\n(Predictable)\n\nYeah, ain't life a bore\n\n(Predictable)\n\nLife gets more and more...\n\nJust like I've heard it all somewhere before.\n\n(Predictable)\n\nSure as the nose on my face\n\n(Predictable)\n\nSame for the whole human race\n\nOne day (one day) it's gonna get better some way (some way)\n\nI wish it would get worse any way (any way)\n\nWhat can I lose, it might turn into something better.\n\nIt gets harder and harder the harder I try\n\n(Predictable)\n\nFeels like a good time to die\n\nI kiss you hello then I kiss you good-bye\n\n(Predictable)\n\nJust like the stain on my tie\n\n(Predictable)\n\nJust like the jacket I wear\n\n(Predictable)\n\nThe way that I'm combing my hair\n\nTurn on the TV, just sit and stare\n\n(Predictable)\n\nThere's nothing happening there\n\nYeah, that's the word of the year\n\n(Predictable)\n\nAll I see, all I hear.\n\nThe first time that I saw you, you were modestly waiting for a bus\n\nNow you're driving around in hired limousines\n\nAnd you talk so upper class.\n\nThe cost is high, but it's not the only price you ultimately pay\n\nAdd it up, you might have got some money\n\nBut you lost me on the way\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAh, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci\n\nCartier, Cartier\n\nGucci, Gucci, Gucci\n\nAdd it up,\n\nYou multiplied and multiplied but what's it leading to?\n\nAdd it up,\n\nThe only thing subtracted is the love I had for you\n\nSo add it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nSymbols of perversion and insanity\n\nSymbols of social immorality\n\nSymbols of economic cruelty\n\nSymbolize all what you did to me\n\nAh, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci\n\nCartier, Cartier\n\nGucci, Gucci, Gucci\n\nCartier, Cartier\n\nMoney can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day\n\nAnd you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\nAdd it up, oh\n\n(repeat)\n\nMet a girl called Lola, and I took her back to my place\n\nFeelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere\n\nStop! Hold on, stay in control\n\nGirl, I want you here with me\n\nBut I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be\n\n'Cause there's a red under my bed\n\nAnd there's a little yellow man in my head\n\nAnd there's a true blue inside of me\n\nThat keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\nWell, I fell asleep, then I woke, feelin' kinda queer\n\nLola looked at me and said, \"Ooh, you look so weird\"\n\nShe said, \"Man, there's really something wrong with you\n\nOne day you're gonna self-destruct\n\nYou're up, you're down, I can't work you out\n\nYou get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out\n\nSilly boy, you self-destroyer\n\nSilly boy, you self-destroyer\n\nSilly boy, you got so much to live for\n\nSo much to aim for, so much to try for\n\nYou're blowing it all with paranoia\n\nYou're so insecure, you self-destroyer\"\n\n(And it goes like this, here it goes)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\n(Here it goes again)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\nDoctor, doctor help me please, I know you will understand\n\nThere's a time device inside of me, I'm a self-destructin' man\n\nThere's a red under my bed\n\nAnd there's a little green man in my head\n\nAnd he said, \"You're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad\n\n'Cause there's a man in ya, gnawin' ya, tearin' ya into two\"\n\nSilly boy, you self-destroyer\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\nSelf-destroyer, wreck your health\n\nDestroy your friends, destroy yourself\n\nThe time device of self-destruction\n\nLight the fuse and start eruption, yeah\n\n(Yeah, it goes like this, here it goes)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\n(Here's to paranoia)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\n(Hey hey, here it goes)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\n(And it goes like this)\n\nParanoia, the destroyer\n\n(And it goes like this)\n\nhere are many different people\n\nLivin' double lives\n\nOne for the office\n\nAnd one that they take home to their wives\n\nHe sits in the armchair, watches Channel 4\n\nWith his brains not expected home for an hour or more\n\nHe's still drifting to and from\n\nLike a yo-yo\n\nHis wife is in the kitchen, fixin' her old man's tea\n\nShe's thinking to herself\n\n\"He's not the man that married me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\n\nThey used to laugh together, now he's never at home\n\nNow she's fighting back the tears, she can't even laugh alone\n\nShe's just sitting by the telephone\n\nLike a yo-yo\n\nYou needed me when you were crying\n\nBut now you're laughing, I'm the last thing on your mind\n\nFirst, you love me, then you don't\n\nI'm up and down\n\nLike a yo-yo\n\nYo-yo\n\nAh, you thought you knew me pretty well\n\nBut with people like me, you never can tell\n\nYou can only guess which way I'll go\n\nYou got me sussed, but you don't know\n\nI'm a yo-yo\n\nJust like a yo-yo on a string\n\nI'm a yo-yo\n\nLittle child playing with a yo-yo\n\nYo-yo, yo-yo\n\nGirl, you had me dangling, like a yo-yo on a string\n\nBut with you at the controls I could accomplish anything, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYou were just playing, I was a little boy\n\nBut when I grew into a man, you threw away your toy\n\nLike a yo-yo\n\nYo-yo\n\nYou might be popular, but it won't last for long\n\nSo don't give up the day job, in case it all goes wrong\n\nLook at your ego, watch it go\n\nUp and down like a yo-yo\n\nYo-yo\n\nYou needed me when you were cryin'\n\nBut now that you're laughing, I'm the last thing on your mind\n\nFirst, you love me, then you don't\n\nI'm up and down like a yo-yo\n\nYo-yo\n\nI'm a yo-yo (yo-yo)\n\nLike a yo-yo\n\nust come back where I came from,\n\nLooks the same as something's wrong.\n\nAnd all my friends that used to be,\n\nHave gone and turned their backs on me.\n\nEveryone's got different views,\n\nNow I'm all shook up and all confused.\n\nEast is West, left is right,\n\nUp is down, and black is white,\n\nInside-out, wrong is right,\n\nIt's back to front and I'm all uptight.\n\nI've just come back from fantasy,\n\nRight back to reality.\n\nStayed away too long but now I've found,\n\nMy world is turning upside-down.\n\nI don't fit in but I don't stand out,\n\nI should stay cool but want to shout.\n\nEast is West, left is right,\n\nUp is down, and black is white,\n\nInside-out, wrong is right,\n\nIt's back to front and I'm all uptight.\n\nNo one knows where I come from,\n\n\"Who are you and what do you want?\"\n\nYou've thrown away all that we had,\n\nIt's down the drain, it's all gone mad.\n\nThe word is out, I've seen the sign,\n\nSo you go your way, I go mine.\n\nEast is West, left is right,\n\nUp is down, and black is white,\n\nInside-out, wrong is right,\n\nIt's back to front and I'm all uptight.\n\nEast is West, left is right,\n\nUp is down, and black is white,\n\nInside-out, wrong is right,\n\nIt's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright).\n\nIt's back to front and I'm all uptight (alright, alright, alright, alright).\n\nAre you listening?\n\n(NO!)\n\nWell then, I'll have to do it all over again!\n\nSunday afternoon there's something special, it's just like another world\n\nJogging in the park is my excuse to look at all the little girls\n\nI'm not a flasher in a rain coat, I'm not a dirty old man,\n\nI'm not gonna snatch you from your mother, I'm an art lover\n\nCome to daddy,\n\nAh, come to daddy,\n\nCome to daddy\n\nPretty little legs, I want to draw them, like a Degas ballerina\n\nPure white skin, like porcelain, she's a work of art and I should know\n\nI'm an art lover\n\nCome to daddy, and I'll give you some spangles\n\nLittle girl don't notice me watching as she innocently plays\n\nShe can't see me staring at her because I'm always wearing shades\n\nShe feeds the ducks, looks at the flowers, I follow her around for hours and hours\n\nI'd take her home, but that could never be,\n\nShe's just a substitute for what's been taken from me :(\n\nAh, come to daddy, come on\n\nSunday afternoon can't last forever, wish I could take you home\n\nSo, come on, give us a smile before you vanish out of view\n\nI've learned to appreciate you the way art lovers do,\n\nAnd I only want to look at you\n\nOne on the nose, one on the chin,\n\nYou bruise so easy, so why stay with him?\n\nHe uses you just like a human punching bag.\n\nBut you don't complain, you're too scared to speak.\n\nAnyway, it only really hurts you when you laugh,\n\nAnd when you eat.\n\nBut you can't break the pattern, week after week.\n\nThe bruises show,\n\nBut he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go.\n\nYou'll never let us know\n\nExactly how you feel.\n\nWhat's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse,\n\nYou keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.\n\nYou say it's okay,\n\nBut I say that it's not right.\n\nYou wind him up, but you're living in fear,\n\nYou keep going back but it ends in tears, oh.\n\nThat's quite a cut on the side of your head.\n\nIs it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed?\n\nOh, so uncouth,\n\nExcuse me, is this your tooth?\n\nWhy do you stay, no one knows.\n\nDo you really love him, or are you too scared to go?\n\nYou're always nervous and on the edge of tears.\n\nYou cry alone,\n\nBut you never tell us what it's like when you get back home.\n\nNo one will ever know\n\nBecause you never show.\n\nWhat's the use,\n\nEveryone says you've got no excuse,\n\nYou keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.\n\nYou say it's okay,\n\nBut I say that it's not right.\n\nOh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?\n\nIt takes two sides to know it's true,\n\nAnd maybe, he'll stay in love with you.\n\nNo one will ever know,\n\nBecause you never show."
