        "text": "Programmatically associate labels with all form controls. The recommended method for most circumstances is to use the label element and an explicit association using the for and id attributes. The examples here are ordered from the most common acceptable solution to the least common acceptable solution.\n\n<label for=\"firstname\">First name:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"firstname\">\n\nThe label can also be implicit by wrapping the <label> element around the input:\n\n<label>First name: <input type=\"text\"></label>\n\nIf the input is already labeled visually some other way, such as through a magnifying glass icon on a search submit button, it may be acceptable to use aria-label to create an invisible text label for screen readers to read.\n\n<input type=\"text\" aria-label=\"Search\">\n\nAn alternative method (sometimes used when adding a <label> tag would break functionality or styles, or when multiple labels apply to the same input), is to use aria-labelledby instead:\n\n<div id=\"firstname\">First name:</div> <input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"firstname\">\n\n<!--visual labels may be elsewhere in the content, such as in table headers-->\n\n<div id=\"temperature\">Temperature:</div>\n\n<div id=\"high\">High:</div>\n\n<div id=\"low\">Low:</div>\n\n<!-- the inputs -->\n\n<input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"temperature low\">\n\n<input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"temperature high\">\n\nLastly a placeholder attribute may be used to give text inputs an accessible name. This is not a recommended solution as the visual label (the placeholder text) will be removed once the user enters text into the input, causing them to not know what the input is for.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Search\">\n\nAlso ensure that all id elements are unique on each page, and that the label text makes sense to someone listening to them with a screen reader.\n\nForm elements that should have labels\n\nText entry fields, e.g. <input type=\"text\">, <input type=\"password\"> and <textarea>\n\nRadio buttons, <input type=\"radio\">\n\nCheckboxes, <input type=\"checkbox\">\n\nThe only exceptions for this requirement are:\n\nButtons - buttons are self-labeling\n\nHidden inputs - Inputs with the type attribute value of hidden (e.g., type=\"hidden\"). These inputs are hidden and unavailable for user input. They therefore need no label.\n\nWhen adding labels, be sure to avoid the following:\n\nFirst name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"fname\">\n\nThis markup renders to produce a textbox with the words \"First name:\" next to it. Sighted users have no problem associating the text with the input field. Nevertheless, this connection is not as clear for non-sighted users, especially as forms grow longer and more complex. This ambiguity can make errors more likely, especially when the information required is more complex than a first name.\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to implement these various labelling methods, see the Automated Checks that run as a part of this rule."
