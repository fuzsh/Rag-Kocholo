        "text": "Well, well, well, well” – O’Jays (Summer, 1975)\n\nIn the Summer of 1975, the R&B group, The O’Jays, wrote a song from their Survival album called “Give the People What they Want.” The song was number one for a week and peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 list. During this time, a lot of musical artists are speaking about politics, environment, human injustice, and other issues that are prevalent in this current decade. The issues that I have seen and expressed are related to cybersecurity. I am not the one to discuss politics on a marketing branding website, but instead give me insight on various cybersecurity issues.\n\nThe classic examples we have seen in cybersecurity ranges from the following:\n\n· Social Media\n\n· Gaming Industry\n\n· Music Industry\n\n· Education\n\n· Airlines\n\n· Automobiles\n\n· Internet of Things\n\n· Health Industry\n\n· Politics/Government\n\n· Entertainment\n\n· Mobile Devices\n\nThe list continues to grow daily but we are not being taken serious in the eyes of management. We have recruitment, retention, and education issues in the eyes of Cybersecurity. We are hearing various misinterpretations of how to embark in the field. There are questions being raised if one should obtain a certification or become heavily in debt to obtain a degree(s). To each is own regarding a degree or certification. As I embark on a new decade of 2020, I am reminded of my journey in this field. From 2004-2019, I’ve obtained several certifications and three out of four degrees are technology focused. Various naysayers have said that I don’t possess enough years of experience in the industry in order to be a part of the cybersecurity community. The negativity from peers have guided my thought process and have realized that people will never understand where you’re coming from and it’s not meant for them to understand you. Everyone has their own path that they must follow in order to become successful in this life. Perspective is everything! I will be the first to admit that technology wasn’t on my radar. However, I have been in STEM related activities throughout my childhood. I’ve taken a few computer courses and was in the computer club. As stated in my previous blogs, I’m an avid gamer and love the graphics and challenges from the game designer. However, how does this translate to having a career in gaming or even in cybersecurity? If you are passionate about technology, then there are several routes one may take in order to reaching their ultimate career?\n\nSo, what do you want for an ideal candidate? I am a part of the Purple Squirrel and My Little Pony Cyber Unicorn Campaign. In this campaign, I have seen and experienced rejection regarding my qualifications versus a job description. Network Engineering is a sub-category that falls under cybersecurity. The question that I pose is this: How can someone obtain experience in Cybersecurity or Network Engineering if the courses are not being taught in a traditional institution? Is it worth obtaining certifications vs. obtaining a degree? Maybe my opinion is totally bias because I was brought up where a good education will have more value when it’s time for you to obtain great employment. I’ve done extensive research regarding salary expectations, certifications, cybersecurity conferences, and networking in order to make my presence known. If you are going to make it in the world of cybersecurity or even technology, you must have the resilience to keep pushing forward.\n\nAccording to my Gallup Report, my top 10 skills are:\n\n· Restorative: You love to solve problems\n\n· Learner: You love to learn\n\n· Individualization: You are intrigued by the unique qualities of each person.\n\n· Achiever: You are very driven.\n\n· Command: You love to take charge.\n\n· Deliberative: You are careful, vigilant, private person\n\n· Context: You look back because that is where the answers lie.\n\n· Responsibility: You take ownership on anything you commit to.\n\n· Competition: It’s rooted in comparison\n\n· Ideation: You are fascinated by ideas\n\nI bring this up because I would like to know the justification of why I am not qualified for various roles. I thought that obtaining a higher education and certifications would justify my capabilities for a role. Obviously, if you are a high risk in an organization and not willing to play the Corporate America game, then you are more than likely a high risk for termination. I’ve learned that from various discrimination(s) and negativity I’ve experienced, I know that I need to move on from something that may not be for my benefit.\n\nGive the people what they want, Amber! Yes, I have given you my time, talents, perspectives, and realized that I am capable of being successful in this field. The lack of misinformation and direction has led me to writing various topics to poke the cybersecurity bear. There are some people that are jealous and envious of you while those are cheering you on to your destiny. Some people are in the field of cybersecurity because it’s a quick fix on an increased salary. Some people are in various STEM related fields and have lacked the direction on being in the industry. I can attest that since being in the field, I have to learn how to apply for job, create and tailor a resume, how to ace an interview, how to write a cover and thank you letter, and other life survival skills in order to remain relevant. These types of skills are not taught in a traditional school unless you have programs that are willing to help rising juniors and seniors in high schools and college and universities.\n\nThe following roles that I have embarked upon include:\n\n· Computer Lab admin\n\n· Tech Intern learning Computer Hardware and Software\n\n· Web Developer Intern\n\n· Tutor\n\n· Senior Technology Assistant\n\n· Networking Intern\n\n· Technical Support for a reputable Telecommunication Organization\n\n· Technical Support for a reputable technology company\n\n· Field Engineer\n\n· Network Engineer\n\n· IT Consultant\n\n· Security Consultant Senior Analyst\n\nAre these the career paths for someone to enter cybersecurity? Would you consider someone as someone to going into Help Desk? Wouldn’t you want to mentor and direct them in the right path in their career? Why is there a gap in the career path? All these questions are a formulation of negativity and why someone doesn’t want them to succeed. All I ask is that you pay it forward regarding the career path and help someone along their journey!\n\nAs we continue to dance and listen to the lyrics of the O’Jays…\n\n“Don't know you\n\nGot to give the people, give it up\n\nGive the people what they want?\n\nWell, well\n\nNo, don't know? You don't know, no\n\nGot to give the people\n\nWell, well\n\nGive the people what they want\n\nWell, it's about time for things to get better\n\nWe want the truth, the truth and no more lies\n\nWe want freedom, justice and equality\n\nI want it for you and I want it for me”\n\nWho am I?\n\nWhat do we want? Purple Squirrels and My Little Pony Cyber Unicorns!\n\nWhen do we want them? NOW!\n\nI will enclosing my resume via LinkedIn and e-mail for future considerations for roles in the Metro Atlanta, Georgia area. I am not in the position to relocate at this time, Thank You!"
