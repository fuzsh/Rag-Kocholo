        "text": "We live in times where labels are increasingly being assigned to individuals. However, most of us do not question the validity, relevance or in fact the impact of doing so. Often, the practice of labelling people can be disguised to almost seem authentic, and offering greater benefit than detriment.\n\nWhy do we label people?\n\nCategorizing people is usually a measure to identify specific groups or types of people for various reasons. This may not always be detrimental as long as those categories are broad, relevant and non-discriminatory. An example of this might be identifying children as the population below the age of 18 years. Clearly, there may be a necessity to quantify this part of the population for resources in education or future planning.\n\nLabelling can however attach negativity to specific groups. An example based on the term ‘children’, might be that of “children receiving free school dinners”. Arguably, some may suggest that this data is required on a resource or planning basis. However, we must also consider the stigma attached to receiving state assistance.\n\nIt is clear that the purpose, for which the data is collated, does have relevance on the positivity attributed to the task. Usually when there is ultimately a benefit to that particular group, it is easier to understand the need for categorization.\n\nWhat is the impact of depersonalizing people?\n\nPeople find it somewhat easier to lose care when the personality is removed from the perception of a human being. People are not objects, and carry varied traits and attributes. Assigning a label bypasses the multi-faceted person, preferring a monotone image of that individual.\n\nHuman beings are superior to other living things, in that they possess emotions, senses and the ability to reason. We form attachments to others as we learn to empathize with their personalities. Relationships are formed and nurtured as we acquire knowledge of an individual, until we bond with that person based on consistency and trust. We form very short-term and fragile bonds where the relationship is based on a particular trait or characteristic.\n\nImagine forming a relationship with say a “banker”, just because of that particular characteristic. I think it is quite evident that when the money disappears, the relationship would be lost as there was no attachment to the actual 'person', apart from the monetary interest.\n\nThe same applies when we loosely apply labels to different categories of people. It is easy to dismiss a “homeless” person for example. However, if we examine the person behind the label, it may be that this person was once a ‘respected’ banker, who had experienced a twist of fate, and found himself bankrupt after losing everything.\n\nIt is often the case that as human beings, we want to hide our vulnerabilities, to forget that we need others in order to exist in a meaningful way. Life is complex and very challenging, with each day opening a new chapter of life. Equally, events of late should show us that the world is changing with unpredictability. We did not see any analysts predict the mass migration from the Middle East. These people in turn probably had no intention to leave their homeland, but for recent events. Nevertheless, as human beings we ought to show compassion to others at times of disaster and conflict. Decision-making that causes these hardships, is often taken by others far removed from the streets, without proper examination of the effects.\n\nMaybe the decision-makers should accept 'contributory negligence' as a principle for recognizing their responsibility to aid those displaced by economic, conflict and war-related decisions.\n\nEvery person has a story, which encompasses life events, family and decisions. Sometimes these decisions have unfortunate consequences, which will leave them in danger or vulnerable. There is always a son, daughter, brother, sister, friend behind the veil of a label. It may even be you who is seeking the help or understanding of others.\n\nA label enables disassociation from the individual, and ultimately segregation within the population. People often judge others based on these labels, giving a distorted and often superficial view of that person.\n\nWords are very powerful things, so if negativity is attached to the particular category or label, a sense of contempt can become apparent, and indeed heightened.\n\nThe person subject to the labeling may also experience isolation, intimidation and bullying as a result of that label. We have seen a rise in the use of such words, to which public reaction is quite startling. I was very impressed to recently hear that the children’s word of the year for 2016 was “refugee”. The use of this word had tripled since last year, in stories by children aged up to 13 years in the '500 words competition'. It was even more impressive to hear that the younger generation, were using descriptions littered with compassion and empathy around their use of this word. It may well be that we can all learn from the lips of the young.\n\nA further example surrounds that of accusations of abuse of children, where media attention has literally created frenzy at the mention of those labels, irrespective of guilt or even investigation.\n\nLong-Term Effects?\n\nSociety will ultimately become divided and segregated. Individuals lose their identity and purpose, fracturing future generations by not developing individualism, personality and spirit. It is always better to be inspired by diversity, as it offers creativity, change and hope.\n\nIt can have the impact of ‘belief’ in the actual label, so the labeled individual amplifies that particular trait even where initially they may not have accepted this tag. This is actually confirmation bias influencing the labeled party, and this can be unsupportive and detrimental.\n\nCreativity and growth may be stifled by the constant need to categorize individuals.\n\nIt is not all bad, as labels can if used sensibly, offer protection to groups that might be otherwise be vulnerable or under-represented. They can also give a “special” status like members of ‘MENSA’, or identify risk factors, like the rare Duffy-negative or O-negative/Lutheran B-negative blood types, which requires the identification of donors worldwide.\n\nSeeing beyond the label\n\nA disabled person is still a person who is able to participate in society. A refugee is simply a person who is temporarily homeless. A person of different ethnicity or race is still part of the global community which affords the whole a unique variety; but moreover no human beings share the exact same genetic, cultural and social identity. This is indeed the beauty of humanity, in that we are all unique and diverse.\n\nAre there any positive effects?\n\nThere is always an alternative application to data, and maybe this one will offer a pause for thought. Groups of individuals identified by labels, may in fact be those categories, which need protection and resources. This is not suggested in a demeaning way, as this does not necessarily correlate to financial stability.\n\nThose labelled individuals actually offer diversity in many shapes and forms, from which society could ultimately benefit. I recall the Steve Jobs quote:\n\n“Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... the ones who see things differently -- they're not fond of rules... You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.”\n\nThis quote says it all concisely, as people label others because they are different. However, imagine a world of conformity and uniformity. It would be pretty dull, so be inspired to celebrate differences with respect and understanding, and not indifference and fear.\n\nSome labelled people may actually be inspired to challenge that label, showing great determination and strength of character. Recently, I read a story about a man who had migrated to the United States, and was seen on the street holding his young daughter over his shoulder, whilst attempting to sell pens. His image stirred a total stranger to find the man and start a crowd-funding campaign to help him to get back on his feet. This same man is now running three restaurants, where he employs and helps other refugees to rebuild their lives.\n\nThe world is experiencing unprecedented global humanitarian crises, the scale of which is likely to increase as economies around the world struggle. It is therefore important that we remember we are all part of the human race, and we should never judge a book by its cover, or even label!\n\nFor more inspirational articles, poetry or art, please visit:"
