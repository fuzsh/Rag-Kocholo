        "text": "Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings are giving the people what they want — a new record full of the attitude and tenacity you'd expect from the soul singer and the crisp horn arrangements from the Dap-Kings.\n\nIt's the same attitude and tenacity that allowed Ms. Jones to kick cancer. Originally slated for an August release, Give the People What They Want was delayed due to Jones' diagnosis. While this record was written before the diagnosis, it's a record with themes of strength and survival. Nothing's going to keep her down or hold her back; not cancer and not the ex we hear about in \"Retreat\"! You hear it in the line \"You'd be a fool to take me on.\" And no matter what happens, she sings about coming together and defying circumstances in \"We Get Along\".\n\nThroughout this soundtrack of strength is a backbone of gutsy horns and swinging guitars. The laid-back \"Making Up and Breaking Up (And Making Up and Breaking Up Over Again)\" is reminiscent of the Ronettes, while \"Long Time, Wrong Time\" is more '70s funk.\n\nGive the People What They Want is trademark Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings — sassy, strong and soulful, and we're glad she's kicked cancer to sing it to us."
