By bringing people together to work as one unified team, Slack transforms the way organizations communicate.\n\nWorking in Slack\n\nSlack helps you work in a more connected, flexible, and inclusive way.\n\nConnected\n\nSlack makes access to your coworkers easy — message anyone inside or outside your organization and collaborate just like you would in person. People can work in dedicated spaces called channels that bring together the right people and information.\n\nFlexible\n\nSlack supports asynchronous work. When work is organized in channels, no matter your location, time zone, or function, you can access the information you need on your own time. Ask questions, get caught up, and share updates without having to coordinate schedules.\n\nInclusive\n\nIn Slack, everyone in an organization has access to the same shared and searchable information. When teams work together in channels, information can be shared with everyone at once, helping keep teams stay aligned and make decisions more quickly.\n\nGetting started with Slack\n\nDoes your company already use Slack?\n\nIf you're a new Slack user, learn how to get set up and get started in Slack.\n\nLooking to set up Slack for your company?\n\nLearn more about Slack's pricing plans, visit our guide for workspace creators, and dive into more resources for administrators.\n\nReady to keep learning?\n\nFind detailed how-to articles and learning tutorials in our Help Center (hey, you’re already here!)."
