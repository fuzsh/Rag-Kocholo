        "text": "Sensitivity labels add security to confidential meetings. Certain meeting options, like recording a meeting, may be unavailable depending on which label you choose.\n\nSelect Sensitivity to choose a sensitivity label from the dropdown menu.\n\nDecide who gets into meetings directly and who should wait to be let in by using the lobby.\n\nIf you use the lobby, you (and anyone else allowed to admit people) will see a list of people in the lobby. From there you can choose to admit or deny them.\n\nUse the lobby to add another layer of security to your meeting.\n\nEasily manage larger meetings by allowing people from trusted organizations and accounts to bypass the lobby.\n\nTurn the People dialing in can bypass the lobby toggle on to allow anyone joining your meeting by phone to enter without waiting in the lobby.\n\nDepending on policies set by your IT admin, people dialing in might be placed in the lobby temporarily until someone from your org or a trusted org joins the meeting.\n\nTurn the Announce when people dialing in join or leave toggle on to receive alerts when people calling in by phone join or leave your meeting. Your admin might have enabled these alerts by default.\n\nUse this setting when you want to keep track of who is still in your meeting, and who has already left.\n\nSee Roles in a Teams meeting for details about selecting presenters and changing someone's role before and during a meeting.\n\nNote: Meeting rooms are part of your org, so they'll join meetings the same way any other participant in your org does.\n\nSpecify presenters and turn on the Manage what attendees see toggle to show only shared content and people you bring on screen.\n\nThis option will limit attendee mic and camera use.\n\nChange this setting to let attendees chat anytime, during a meeting only, or not at all.\n\nBy default, anyone invited to a meeting can participate in the meeting chat before, during, and after the meeting.\n\nIn Teams Premium, turn the Turn off copying or forwarding of meeting chat toggle on to prevent attendees from copying and pasting content from a meeting chat. When this is turned on, right-click to copy, ctrl + C, Forward message, Share to Outlook, and Copy link won't be available.\n\nThis does not prevent screen capture or third-party software from being used.\n\nTurn on the Provide CART Captions toggle to use Communication access real-time translation (CART) captions during a meeting.\n\nCART captions are generated by a trained CART captioner who listens and translates speech into text instantly.\n\nWhen you turn on the Apply a watermark to shared content toggle, available in Teams Premium, each meeting participant will see a watermark with their name and email address cast across shared visual content.\n\nTurn on the Allow participants to rename themselves toggle to allow participants to change their display name during a meeting.\n\nNote: For video tiles under 250 x 140 pixels, an attendee's full name will only appear on hover due to size limitations."
