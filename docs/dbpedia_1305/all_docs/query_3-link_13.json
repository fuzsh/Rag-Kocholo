        "text": "They love each other, right? Then why do they always feel like they're not on the same page?\n\nThe most common issue in any relationship is the communication barrier. Everyone experiences love differently, and it's easy to miss the mark when it comes to showing that you care.\n\nIn his early years as a marriage counselor, Dr. Gary Chapman noticed that over and over, couples voiced similar complaints regarding their marriage.\n\nOne spouse would say something like, \"I feel like he doesn't love me.\"\n\nAnd the other would protest, \"I don't know what else to do. I'm doing everything I should be doing.\"\n\nRecognizing this pattern and remembering the rocky start in his own marriage, Dr. Chapman pored three years of session notes.\n\nHe asked himself, \"When someone's saying, 'I feel like my spouse doesn't love me,' what did they want?\"\n\nSurprisingly, their answers fell into five different categories, revealing a unique approach for how to effectively love another person.\n\nThe premise is simple: Different people, with different personalities, give and receive love in different ways. Dr. Chapman called these ways of expressing and receiving love \"The 5 Love Languages®.\" He even wrote a best-selling book about it.\n\nThis revolutionary concept has improved millions of relationships across the globe.\n\nThese Love Languages don't only apply to couples, the concept holds true for friends, siblings, parents and their children, and relationships of every kind. Each individual has at least one primary love language that they prefer above the others and that is where it really starts to get interesting.\n\nWant to intentionally strengthen and improve your relationships? You can start right now, by taking The 5 Love Languages® quiz to find out how you prefer to give and receive love."
