        "text": "What's the deal with this guy?\n\nI remember reading a funny article when \"Jeepers Creepers 2\" came out, and the female author was just repulsed by Salva, and his obvious leering and sexualization (on film) of all these hot young guys in the movie.\n\nThe weird part is that it was so true.\n\nHow did he even manage to have a career in Hollywood, given his sketchy past with underaged males?\n\nThe movie started out with a cute blond boy being abducted by the Creeper.\n\nThen it moved on to a bus full of teen aged jocks. Half of them shirtless and tanning on top of a bus. The other half of them pissing next to each other in a field.\n\nThen the Creeper scopes out the jocks and \"chooses\" his favorite. He then proceeds to lick the window, as if he's licking the guy he chose.\n\nSalva was indeed a creep.\n\nSpeaking of the movie Powder, Sean Patrick Flanery is so hot.\n\nHe looked creepy in the movie, but in real life he's quite handsome.\n\nSean also has a banging body for a 57 year old.\n\nGlad we got to see him nude!\n\nIt's funny how Rose McGowan spent so much time \" calling out\" everyone from Meryl Streep to Alyssa Milano to her former manager ( who committed suicide after McGowan publicly trashed her). And yet when she was asked about working with Salva she answered that it was none of her business. So many of these self righteous \" advocacy\" types don't really advocate for anyone but themselves.\n\nThis was one of my favorite movies, it was hot to see the role reversal in horror and had decent characters. Then again, I was 15. I've read the article's about the guy, and its really impossible to distance anything created by someone who molested a 12 y/o kid while in the authority position as director. This was pre-90's-00's sex-offender registry so his time was within guidelines, but touching a kid as an adult is a deal breaker. There was no ambiguity in the case either, it was pretty much he video taped himself with the kid and they found a stash of mags in pics. He slipped just pre-internet, otherwise he'd never have made a pseudo-comeback.\n\nR24\n\nHis reputation is a shame, because both of them were ahead of their time. Powder had that usual Disney slickness to it, so I don't think he had a lot of creative control, I saw it in the theater as a kid, couldn't tell you more than a few scenes.\n\nI remember watching his first feature length film, Clownhouse, on HBO in the early 90s. It freaked me out and I liked it a lot. I recorded it when HBO replayed it later. It was Sam Rockwell's first movie and he had quite a screen presence even then as the smart assed oldest brother. I rewatched it several times throughout the 90s.\n\nI didn't learn Salva had molested (repeatedly and even recorded it once) the lead boy in the movie until Jeepers Creepers came out. But, it retrospect a few scenes were a red flag. He showed the lead that he molested bare assed and in tight white underwear were his penis imprint could be seen through them. Needless to say, I could never enjoy the film again after learning that.\n\nIt's amazing they let him keep making films.\n\nRose ignoring what he did shows how nuts and full of shit she is.\n\nClownhouse is quite sleazy. I saw it on TV one night as a teenager and had no idea about Victor Salva but all I could think was that it was directed by a paedophile. Years later, I read about the controversy when Jeepers Creepers cam out, looked up his filmography and there it was in black and white.\n\n[quote] The Creeper's obsession with the male lead\n\nYeah, like sniffing his dirty clothes in the car.\n\nAnd don't forget this doozy, where he cuts off the state trooper's head, and then makes out with it.\n\nOkay, well he doesn't make out with it. He just tongues him.\n\nHe visited a set that I was working on (I have no idea why)- I don't remember the year, but it was after the allegations, perhaps before JC2. Very repulsive in person- pallid, fat, with a thick layer of white sunscreen on his face, sweating profusely. Super dark energy- everyone avoided him.\n\nI agree, R43.\n\nI think both JC and JC2 were some of the scariest movies I've ever seen.\n\nBut Salva's association with both movies, really affects my appreciation for those movies.\n\nI'll still watch them, though. Lol.\n\nIn fact, they are both showing on SyFy tonight.\n\nR33 I've never seen it, but my sister told me she saw Clownhouse at a slumber party when she was young and looked it up online years later because it stuck with her. She said that there are a lot of shots where the camera \"lingers\" on the boys in the movie and that the girls at the party commented on it.\n\nI remember when Jeepers Creepers came out at the end of the summer of 2001, I thought it was odd that there was no hoopla over Salva directing the film. It became an unexpected hit. There was little promo aside from commercials but they definitely downplayed that Salva directed the film. And the fact that he was able to go on to do the sequel was another sign that United Artists didn't have any real concerns about involving Salva.\n\nWhich is odd because there was such outrage over Powder, but maybe that's because it was from Disney.\n\n[quote]I saw JC (the original), JC2 and JC3. The first two movies were good. The third was terrible. Meg Foster looked like Death warmed over in it.\n\nI'd really like to know whether Foster is bitter about been replaced on Cagney and Lacey.\n\nIf not, it doesn't matter what she looks like- she's a trooper in my book.\n\nR47 When I saw it, I was watching it with my friend and even she noticed how weird it was. Years later when I heard about Salva, I phoned her and said, \"See!\".\n\nAnd it's not like Jeepers Creepers 2 where they have 25 year olds playing 16 - they're actually 12, they look 12, and they spend half the movie being terrorized in their underwear. It's surprising no-one from the studio noticed.\n\nThe people calling out McGowan's supposed hypocrisy are overlooking two things: 1) This guy is an absolute nobody compared to Weinstein. He had at most 1/1000th of Weinstein's power and influence. What made Weinstein's case so disgusting was the enormous power he had and how he used it for vile destructive things. 2) Salva didn't get away with shit. He was caught long ago and now everyone knows about it, completely different from Weinstein raping his way through Hollywood while everyone looked the other way.\n\nThe McGowan hate on this site is as psychotic as the trans hate\n\nR65 biological aging is not a constant that varies at the same rate over time.\n\nIt is different for people even sharing genetics. It can speed up or slow down in periods of one's life.\n\nHabits and health practices can have an effect. So can stress. So can pretty much everything that happens to a person in life.\n\nI think they used makeup on Foster to make her look even more severe. She is very lined and wrinkled now, but the makeup to made it look much more pronounced.\n\nIf you want to see her look really scary, google image search her in the movie Lords of Salem.\n\n[quote] The first deserves to be considered a classic, up there with The Hitcher. One of the few road movie horrors that actually gets you in your creepy bone.\n\nI wanted to get Justin Long on my creepy bone.\n\nThe guy definitely has talent.\n\nJeepers Creepers was one of the most original horror movies when it first came out.\n\nAnd it was really scary too.\n\nCornelius Hawthorne : These are your friends, Pierce? Minorities, Jewesses, and the unseasonably tan?\n\nBritta Perry : That is inappropriate, and maybe you'll give that more weight since I'm white.\n\nCornelius Hawthorne : You've got a wide brow. What are you? Scandinavian?\n\nBritta Perry : Yeah, Swedish.\n\nCornelius Hawthorne: Swedish dogs! Your blood is tainted by generations of race mixing with Laplanders. You're basically Finns!\n\nSalva served just 15 months of only a 3 year sentence. And not n prison, but a mental health treatment center. Frances \"Victor was a kid himself\" Coppola hired hm some crackerjack lawyers. Coppola told the victim, Nathan Forrest Winters, that he would never work in the industry again - and even tried to countersue the family. A real class act.\n\nSalva and his lawyers used the standard \"it was a one time touching incident with a consenting minor\" when he went back to Hollywood. The people who worked with him either believed it or knew the real truth and didn't care.\n\nNathan Forrest winters was all over the internet giving interviews a few years ago. Kind of mum now. Hasn't even posted on SM in two years. Some might not agree with everything he says, but seems like the real deal and I admire that he hasn't turned into a right-wing grifting lunatic.\n\nr87, I've always wondered why Coppola never gets mentioned when the debate about Salva gets brought up. Coppola and his production company were directly involved in Clownhouse and the first 2 Jeepers Creepers. At one time I assumed he was maybe just a silent partner or opted to give Salva a second chance after his imprisonment but then I read about him threatening Winters and suing the family to keep them quiet. Really scummy but he seems to get a pass."
