        "text": "Written By: Casey Powers\n\nDirected By: Victor Salva\n\nCast: Ray Wise, Eric Nenninger, and Jonathan Breck\n\nJeepers Creepers II is Victor Slava’s 2003 sequel to his first film that came out in 2001. The cast is almost completely new with the only returning actors Jonathan Breck as the titular Creeper, and Justin Long with a couple cameo scenes. Aside from that the cast is completely revamped.\n\nAlso as a semi-interesting side note, I saw the trailer for this movie in theaters when I was about eleven years old, and it scared the crap out of me. And that was my first taste of horror on the big screen. Of course, I think my standards of what I find scary might have changed just a little in the past ten years or so.\n\nThe story starts off on a farm on a hot spring day. The Creeper (Jonathan Breck), posing as a scarecrow, attacks and kills the young son of farmer Jack Taggart (Ray Wise). Taggart wordlessly swears to get his revenge on the monster, and with that we shift focus to a school bus driving down an isolated Kansas road. The bus is carrying a high school basketball team on their way home after winning the state championship. The Creeper takes out the bus’s tires, and starts to pick off the students one by one.\n\nThis movie has a lot of good ideas behind it, but it never really delivers on them, at least not to their full potential. I think the primary idea about leaving these kids on an isolated road is to make them, well, isolated. But they never really feel isolated. The movie decides to continuously cut back to Taggart, or to randomly give one of the students’ psychic visions that lets them see the Creeper’s previous victims. All these moments take us away from the bus, which I think is a mistake. If Salva really wanted to ramp up the fear he should have forced us to stay on the bus the entire film. It would make us empathize a lot more with the stranded team because we would be feeling stranded and claustrophobic by simply being on the bus with them.\n\nHad this movie played its cards right it could have been very reminiscent of John Carpenter’s The Thing. A small group of people, completely isolated from the world, encounter a monster that eats them alive. They have no hope of escape and start to turn on each other. I think that is what the film was trying to go for, but ultimately fails to achieve. They gave the audience way too much breathing room, and it prevented this film from every being truly scary.\n\nThe cast is ridiculously large considering its premise. This is easily the largest high school basketball team I’ve ever seen, not to mention the fact that the bus also holds cheerleaders, coaches, the team manager, the school reporter, and the bus driver. There are twenty plus people on the bus and only half of them have speaking roles. Also, a lot of the characters simply vanish from the film. The opening scene on the bus has four cheerleaders, yet throughout the rest of them film there are only three. There is also a scene where the Creeper is chasing fifteen students through a field, and then it just cuts away. We never see the students again. Did the Creeper get them? Did they get away? Your guess is as good as mine. It really seems like such a waste to devote so much screen time to ten characters that never speak and ultimately don’t amount to anything significant in the story.\n\nThe movie has a serious case of who-is-the-protagonist-itis. Is it Taggart? No it can’t be. He isn’t even in half of the film. Is it the girl who randomly got psychic powers? No, she doesn’t really do much outside of exposition dumping. What about the student (Eric Nenninger) who claims to be the token white boy on the team, even though over half the team is white? Can’t be him either, because he is completely uninvolved in the climax. Storytelling 101 states that the key to telling a good story is to give a strong motivation to a protagonist, and then let the protagonist drive the plot forward. And Jeepers Creepers II simply doesn’t have that.\n\nNow strictly having a single protagonist isn’t an absolute law, but stories that don’t have a protagonist need to be careful about how they go about telling their story. Had this film cut down its cast and gave every single person on screen a decent amount of exposure and actually let them speak and have personality, then it could have worked. If every character was presented as equals so that the audience wasn’t sure who would be the next victim or who would survive then it who have been much more engaging. Instead the movie simply half develops these characters through a couple lines. This guy might be gay, this guy is a nerd, this guy is probably racist. They are superficial labels that highlight the characters’ lack of development instead of actually developing them.\n\nThat isn’t to say this movie is all bad, though. Salva is a very good visual director, and there are quite a few shots that are simultaneously beautiful and scary. Also, I can’t say enough good things about the Creeper himself. The make-up is fantastic and how he moves is great and creepy. He is easily the best thing about this franchise, and every time he is on screen it’s a treat. Though they do come dangerously close to overexposing him during the climax, but thankfully they don’t.\n\nOverall, Jeepers Creepers II is a decent film. There is nothing really in the movie that I can outright say is bad; it’s just misguided. It has a few entertaining moments that make it fun to watch, but the characters and the scares are a little bit lacking. It’s the type of movie you can leave on in the background while you do other things."
