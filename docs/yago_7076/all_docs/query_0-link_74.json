        "text": "For fans of Jeepers Creepers, this horror film features more of the scary winged Creeper seen in the original movie and will get viewers ready for the upcoming Jeepers Creepers: Reborn in 2022. Directed by Victor Salva, many of the scenes are filmed in daylight—allowing viewers to appreciate the visual effects and detail surrounding the creature’s face, weapons, and his supernatural truck/van containing a cow catcher on the front.\n\nSinister music, suspenseful moments, and scary surprises await the characters in the story. While the movie is not as scary as the original, it follows the original theme of a Creeper that appears every 23 years, hunts and eats for 23 days, and especially likes to feast on humans. Equipped with a harpoon, hidden lances, a steel teeth trap, bullet repelling armor, and other gimmicks, the truck is also a formidable foe.\n\nAt the start of the film, the Sheriff’s officers have captured the Creeper’s truck in Poho County. Soon after, officers are brutally killed when they look inside the truck and see dead bodies. Suddenly, the Creeper lands on the top of the truck, kills the driver, and escapes with the truck. Realizing the creature is back in the county to wreak havoc, Sheriff Dan Tashtego (Stan Shaw) begins preparations to find and kill the Creeper; he enlists other officers to help him, including a reluctant Sergeant Davis Tubbs (Brandon Smith) and one young man whose father was killed by the creature and now is out for revenge in his truck outfitted with a large machine gun.\n\nMeanwhile, on her farm, Gaylen Brandon (Meg Foster) sees visions of her son; he warns her to take her granddaughter Addison (Gabrielle Haugh) and leave the area. Her son buried something from the Creeper and he knows it will return for it. Despite her son’s warning, Gaylen digs up the find and discovers it’s a hand. When she touches it, the hand grabs her and Gaylen learns more about the origins of the creature. This insight is not revealed to the viewers. Gaylen decides to remain at the farm but tells Addison to leave. Addy goes to buy feed for the horses. At the livestock feed and supply farm, Addy goes with the owner’s son in his truck for a ride.\n\nAs the film progresses, the Creeper hunts and kills teenagers riding on their motorcycles. He attacks the feed owner’s son and Allison in their truck and captures Addison. Gaylen shares her information with Sheriff Dan and he also grabs the hand and learns something about the creature.\n\nStill alive, Addison is covered and placed in the truck. She remains quiet, waiting for her moment to escape. In the end, while the officers find and wound the Creeper, it is not destroyed, and viewers realize the creature could return again. Strong optional. Aud: P."
