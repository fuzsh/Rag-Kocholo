        "text": "“Every 23rd spring, for 23 days, it gets to eat.”\n\nJeepers Creepers 3, rumoured to be titled “Jeepers Creepers: Cathedral” is the still upcoming 3rd film in the Jeepers Creepers series. The film is set to be directed and written by Victor Salva, who wrote and directed the first 2 films. Salva has promised that the 3rd film “will be the most frightening Jeepers Creepers film to date”. That’s a mighty big promise.\n\nAs of present the storyline for this film reads “ Trish Jenner is now a mother of a teenage son named Darry, named after the brother she lost 23 years ago. Trish has a recurring nightmare where her son suffers the same fate as her brother did, killed by the Creeper. Determined to prevent this from happening, Trish, who is now a rich and powerful woman, sets out on a final quest with Jack Taggart Sr. and Jr. to end the Creeper's reign of terror once and for all”.\n\nThough Jonathan Breck has signed on to reprise his role as the Creeper, there has yet to be confirmation if Gina Phiilips will reprise her role as Trish Jenner, or if Ray Wise will reprise his role as Jack Taggart Sr. I would not be upset if Ray Wise turned it down, age does play a factor, but i would love to see Gina Phillips come back for one final showdown.\n\nJeepers Creepers 3 is set to be the film that finally looks at the Creepers origins, so on that note i’m very excited. Though the film has been in the rumour mill for around 3 or so years it was only officially given the green light on September 11th 2015 and is aiming for a 2017 release date.\n\nWhat we know about the Creeper is very limited and our best explanation of this creature comes from the films tagline “every 23rd spring, for 23 days it gets to eat”. We know the Creeper is a humanoid type creature. For 23 days it hunts and feeds on humans before returning to a state of hibernation. Where it will remain in slumber for 23 years until it awakes to repeat the process. It possess wings and an intricate type of webbing similar to that in it’s wings, that is around it’s head. It uses fear to sniff out what part of a person it wishes to eat. It has incredible strength and agility and even with missing limbs can continue to terrorise it’s victims. What it eats from his victims it takes into itself. In the cases of injury it regenerates by eating the organ or limb from another person that it is missing in itself, with regeneration occurring almost instantly. No one knows how old this creature is. We do not even know if it speaks. Although a deleted scene from the first Jeepers Creepers including the Creepers one line of dialogue to which he states “she didn’t smell good Darius” delivered with a southern accent. We even then can not take that to be the Creepers real voice. Since we know he takes things from others, it could have very well taken a voice too. All things we can hope will be answered in the 3rd film.\n\nAs i’ve found very common in 90% of trilogies, the 2nd film in the set is always cringe worthy, never matching up to the quality of the 1st, but the series usually redeems itself with the 3rd and final film. I would very much like to think the same can be said for this series.\n\nWhat i loved about the first film was that we didn’t know the Creeper was a “demon” until about the 2nd half of the film. All we know is something appearing to be a man is terrorising people along the highway and appears to be dumping bodies down a long shoot attached to an old abandoned church. These were the parts i enjoyed the most. Also the very fact the Creeper kept and preserved the bodies of his victims like living trophies was, at least to me, a very human aspect of its psychopathy. Perhaps indicating he is more man than we think. A creature would have no need for such prizes, so i found this intriguing. The number of bodies in it’s hide out and the supposed age of some of them although does not tell us how old this being is, but does tell us that assuming centuries is not overreaching.\n\nThe flaws of this film are perhaps not too bad and are just me being picky. I do ask myself how this thing has managed to go decades without being caught to one day being spotted and resorting to torching its own hide out. That seems extreme. And while we’re on the subject of extremes, if this creature is so determined to kill 1 or 2 people that it would risk killing a large group, which would no doubt be noticeable, how has no one ever heard of it before? I found that to be something they didn’t think about very much when they wrote it. In regards to plot progression i understand why it was written in. By half way through the film you need to build up to something and reveal more about this creature in the process. So i get it. But in terms of a logical storyline, it seems rather flawed. The only thing about this film that annoyed me was the introduction of a psychic who speaks in riddles and can never just answer a damn question. She claims she is trying to help, but her way of helping is in no way helpful. She never truly explains her visions or tells them in a way that could be of use. I would even blame her for one of the character’s deaths.\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 is where i felt the story truly began to fall apart. With this film only taking place a few days after the events of the 1st one and being the Creepers last day before hibernation, it seems the writers decided to say “all bets are off”. The Creeper is no longer attempting to be manlike, which was my favourite thing about him. He is in full demon mode just sporting a hat and coat. He has a new arsenal of weapons from daggers to death stars, each forged from the skin and bones of his victims. I did at first think this was reaching, until i remembered in the first film when the creature is struck with Trish’s car, items fall from his coat, one of which being a dagger. So i allow it on grounds of continuity.\n\nThe Creeper’s hunting style is very open and public and erratic yet strategic, where his previous kills seem methodical and he did try and cover them up. Perhaps simply for self preservation. If it remains unknown it can continue to hunt without interruption. However in this film intelligence is not a factor. It’s theorised that due to it being his last day active he becomes desperate to have his fill of people. I can’t help but disagree and blame this on bad plot development. If he was such a desperate hunter, even in his last day, why would he use his previous 22 days to hunt in disguise, to keep the bodies and to treat each body with care as he goes through the undoubtedly time consuming process of preserving them.\n\nI also must consider that if he has gone centuries without capture he would not allow himself to be out in the open just hours before his body becomes dormant. It seems adept at protecting itself from capture and discovery, so to suddenly be in a position where his body is caught and held captive during his dormant years makes zero sense to me.\n\nI do not believe these were the worst issues with the film. My biggest issues lie in the characters being hunted. A group of high school students returning from a football game when their bus is sabotaged and ambushed by the Creeper on the highway. We suddenly have racist, homophobic jocks which bring nothing to the story other than giving the audience characters they hope get killed first. But it seems not even the Creeper has a stomach for people like this. We also have another psychic in the form of a cheerleader, who up until the events of this film has never had a vision in her life. Now suddenly she’s the walking talking Encyclopedia for all things Creeper, not that it does anyone any good. Except maybe her. And what cheerleading squad only has 3 members? I’ve never heard of that before in my life. All of this just really let me down and didn’t make me as interested in this film as i was with it’s predecessor.\n\nI have been waiting a long time for the 3rd installment but i have complete faith that all questions will be answered. We will finally learn all about this creature with his own theme song (lucky!) and redeem the series for the events in the sequel. And for that 2017 can’t come fast enough."
