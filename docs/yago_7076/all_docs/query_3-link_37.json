        "text": "Connor Eyzaguirre\n\nSeptember 13, 2022\n\n8/10\n\nJeepers Creepers wasn't a movie that needed a sequel, but the follow-up was pretty decent anyway. With a new host of characters destined to be lodged in the lower intestine of the Creeper, Jeepers Creepers 2 gives us more of one of modern horror's freakiest monsters and a Captain Ahab-esque vengeful farmer hunting him down for eating his son. Did we need the endless parade of shirtless teenage boys and the uncomfortable amount of racism and homophobia? Not really. But it's a horror film from 2003 written and directed by a convicted pedophile. It could've been worse.\n\nA few days after the events of the first film, the Creeper makes the big mistake of stealing and eating the son of Jack Taggart (Wise). He's basically the John Wick of Poho County farmers, and he whips up a homemade harpoon out of farming equipment in like a day, just so he can hunt the monster that destroyed his family. Meanwhile, a bus full of douchey basketball players are bickering over who really deserved the win, when the Creeper blows out their tires and starts picking them off. I wish Taggart had been the sole focus of the movie, but he does show up again in the third act to dominate. Plus, most of the asshole teens get ripped to shreds. So, overall, it's a win.\n\nIn my opinion, Jeepers Creepers 2 stands right alongside the first film. It's a fun, exciting, freaky, and action-packed revenge thriller starring a monster that literally cannot be killed. The fourth film in the franchise is about to come out, and now that it's been ripped from the hands of Victor Salva, we can enjoy it again. I think we should reclaim those first two films too, because once art is released into the world, it belongs to the people."
