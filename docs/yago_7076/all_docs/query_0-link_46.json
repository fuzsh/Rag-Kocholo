        "text": "The Union of BC Performers (UBCP) has issued a warning to actors in the province about the casting for Jeepers Creepers III.\n\nThe director of the film, Victor Salva, was convicted of sexual misconduct in 1988 and the union says performers should remember they have the right to refuse work if they believe the work is unsafe.\n\nSalva was convicted of sexual misconduct with a 12-year-old boy, who was one of the stars of his movie Clownhouse. He also videotaped one of the encounters.\n\nHe served 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to lewd and lascivious conduct, oral sex with a person under 14, and procuring a child for pornography.\n\nUBCP says in a release “no minor shall be required to work in a situation which places the minor in danger to life or limb, is unsafe or unhealthy, or if the minor or parent/guardian has an honestly held belief that the minor is in such a situation.”\n\nTrending Now\n\n2nd-largest diamond ever unearthed found by Canadian company in Botswana\n\nRail shutdown: Ottawa imposing binding arbitration on parties\n\nThey want agents to let parents and guardians know about Salva’s history. They said they have reached out to the production and they are aware of Salva’s prior criminal conviction.\n\nJeepers Creepers III was set to shoot in B.C. this spring."
