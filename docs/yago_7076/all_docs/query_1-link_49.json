        "text": "(For my previous October Horror essay click HERE)\n\nJeepers Creepers is a pretty interesting film. It captured the imagination of a generation of horror film-viewers with its unique monster and interesting, albeit convoluted, plotline. The 2001 horror film was one of Victor Salva’s first forays into hard horror. his earlier works were more like sci-fi thrillers and dramas where the monsters were real people directed by their upbringings and abilities to act in horrific ways (not unlike Victor Salva himself, but I’m not going to go into that here). This time around he tackled the horror genre head-on, with mixed results.\n\nThe premise of the film is that a brother and sister are heading back home from college for break. Darry and Tricia are infantile, not very bright, and therefore, a perfect fit the base-level horror film. On the drive, a beat-up creeper truck with a curious license plate rolls up on ’em and almost runs them off the road before passing. Later, they see the truck parked beside a building on the side of the road. The man, or is it a man, is carrying human-sized packages wrapped in bed sheets and dropping them down a pipe. He sees them seeing him, gets in his truck, and runs them off of the road.\n\nShaken, but not scurred (sorry if these are bad, but so is the movie in a lot of ways), the two go back to investigate and see if the bodies were actually bodies who need saving. The building is a church where crows (ie. carrion) roost, the pipe leads to the basement, and the package was a barely living man who has been disemboweled and de-tongued, shoddily stitched-up and dies in Darry’s arms. The walls and ceilings of the basement are covered in bodies whose skin has been preserved in formaldehyde. A curious thing happens before Darry investigates and finds the House of Pain, however. His sister warns him that it would be stupid to climb into the pipe and even says that he is doing what some stupid kid in a horror movie would do. But he still does it!\n\nWhatever. From there, the kids go and find a roadside diner and make total asses out of themselves by demanding that the waitress call the cops (there is a payphone right next to the entrance) and generally making a big scene. The cops come out to help (something which almost never happens in a horror film- the phone is typically offline and the telephone wires are cut). But the cops are not up to snuff to complete the job. Dozens are massacred by the beast before the film is over. As is an old cat lady with a shotgun who tries to dispose of the scarecrow, cowboy, Jersey Devil, the Thing, thing monster. The very fact that the kids reach the cops and that the cops believe their story after the weight of overwhelming evidence is a breath of fresh air in the mostly stale B-Movie miasma however.\n\nAnother subversive delight in the film is when the kids first see the monster close up. He is eating the tongue from a police officer’s face, but framed by a billboard that advertises a local meat market: “Tastes so darn good!” The total effect of seeing the monster is taken away over the course of the film by his nearly constant presence (as opposed to fear generated by the Cat People in Jacques Tourneur’s film of the same name where he famously never actually shows the beast and generates that corner of the eye existential fear). The thinly-woven and largely unnecessary character of the psychic medium adds little to the story’s suspense (but carries on the theme of psychics and tele-kinetic powers in Salva’s earlier films), but it does give away the important plot point that one of the kids will not escape the monster’s clutches. Finally, with dialogue like “it’s eaten too many hearts for its own to ever stop” the film isn’t exactly grasping for much of anything (I guess its reach doesn’t exceed its grasp, but to what effect?)\n\nOh well. Hopefully the next horror film I revisit will be better. Ciao for now.\n\nCody Ward"
