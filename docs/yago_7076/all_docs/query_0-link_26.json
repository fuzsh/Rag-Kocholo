        "text": "Based off of isn't remotely the same as created by.\n\nBHVR has stated clearly that they don't want to be even remotely associated with the franchise. I support that decision, stay the ######### away from JC.\n\nAs a character, I would love The Creeper to join DBD\n\nBut as has been stated in this thread, the creator/director guy is kind of...disgusting and so there'd be no chance for it to happen.\n\nWhich is a shame cause I think The Creeper is an interesting character that you could do a lot with but I 100% understand and am fine with BHVRs reasoning for why it won't happen.\n\nThis.\n\nthough iirc that thing has sold the rights and wouldn’t directly profit from it anymore? (Wasn’t there even talk about some remake movies or something?)\n\nalso, BHVR have changed their mind on previously stated ‚never‘-s multiple times now, so can’t be sure about this one either..\n\nThe remake/reimaginating or whatever came out last year on Hulu\n\nWord on the street is that it is AWFUL\n\nI was actually going to watch it because I don't mind good bad horror but evidently the new movie is just bad bad horror.\n\nThough with the new movie, Victor Salva is not part of it in any way and according to the director, benefits zero from it so presumably yes, the rights have been changed.\n\nNot all of us are as informed as you are. Just Googled it and found the story. I also didn't know he helmed the entire trilogy.\n\nAnd no, now that I know it I do not want JC in DbD.\n\nYou're correct, after some digging he sold the rights, hence why JC Reborn could be made.\n\nBut if I'm being frank, I honestly don't care if he does or doesn't. The franchise is forever tarnished by him and his actions. Anything remotely related to supporting the nonce, even with just mere publicity, disgusts me to my core.\n\nI never really liked the movie to be honest, but after I found out the whole polemic about the director, I personally vouch for it to not come and I imagine the team at BHVR feels the same way. As some people pointed, maybe if the director dies or can no longer receive anything from the property, then maybe it could be implemented, though I myself wouldn't really want that at all if I'm being honest.\n\nDon't feel bad, i've came here with the same idea and got told the same thing..and I had never, ever even heard word of it all before. I even googled it after because I was like, there's no way this is true..but, unfortunately..\n\nThe director served his time, so he should still be punished for it? The costume designer, the artists/makeup, the cast, the crew and the fans didn't commit any crimes either, so why should they miss out? Don't like it, don't buy it.\n\nBut this is 2023 and people in the gaming community nowadays have skin about as thick as tracing paper, see Harry Potter and JK Rowling.\n\nHonestly I want Jeepers Creepers in the game it’ll make it more terrifying to play if it’s done right the recent killers we have gotten are cool but not really terrifying and it’s kinda a let down personally I don’t support what the guy did but he knew how to make a scary movie Jeepers creepers one was at its peak having a creature no one really knows its origin or where it came from or why it’s driven by this evil hunger he gets from eating humans would make a great character but I do understand why they don’t want him due to the guy even the reboot that has nothing to do with him still a terrible movie but could bring him to the game if they want to go with the reboot .\n\nOnly way ppl will be ok with it is if not a single penny goes to the Pedo that made it. If they can get the rights to the character without paying that dude anything, great. Unfortunately though I don't think this will be a repeat of Ghostface who they only had to get licensing agreements from the ppl who made the mask instead of the film franchise.\n\nIt was written and directed by Salva\n\nHe also did the sequels of which there are two. He wrote and directed both of those as well, but there is a reboot that he isn't attached to at all and as of last may that film was held up in court due to a lawsuit over the rights. it apparently got released in September of last year, but the court case seems to still being going ahead it seems. The suit involves Myriad Pictures and Infinity Films Holdings as Myriad says that the movie was made without knowledge or consent on top of being sold to their competitor Screen Media Films.\n\nSo, it's a giant mess that no matter how anyone wants to slice it should stay far far away from DBD.\n\nThank you for clearing that up. I remember watching the first two movies when I was like 11-12 and never bothered with the third upon learning about the director so I never really read into them any further."
