        "text": "1. Cinematography… Movie: Jeepers Creepers (2001) Directed by: Victor Salva\n\n2.  What is cinematography? Cinematography is the act of capturing photographic images in space through the use of a number of controllable elements. These include the quality of the film stock, the manipulation of the camera lens, framing, scale and movement.\n\n3. This image is the opening scene of the movie Jeepers Creepers that was out in the year of 2001. This shot is definitely an extreme long shot as it contains such a large amount of landscape and it sets the scene nicely showing you that they are on an long running, abandoned road.\n\n4. This is an image still from one of the scenes of Jeepers Creepers and I would class this scene image as being a full shot. It is a full shot because you have a good view of the background as well as the main subject and it shows you what place the scene is in also the other thing is you have other objects in subject too which of course is the villain who is standing there with a weapon in the right corner.\n\n5. This still is a long shot and I know this because you can see the characters fully, with the background showing as well . This shot is to show us audience what the characters are wearing as well as there relationship with each other. From this shot you get the sense of characters feelings and looking at this I feel as though the character Darry is quite disappointed or upset where as you have Trish who seems more shocked and not as disappointed.\n\n6. This image still is a mid shot of the two main characters in the movie and the characters names are Trish and Darry Jenner. They are both in the main view of the camera so that the audience watching the movie can have a good look of what they look like. You can only see the waist above and that is what a mid shot is. You can also get a good feel of their personality too and how they seem as individuals. You can even see the clothing that they are wearing quite clearly, I also think that this image still shows you can the relationship between the two characters as you have the girl Trish in the front and by looking at her she seems like a very bossy and demanding character and in the image you can clearly see that because of her body language and the way she comes across, however you have her brother Darry behind her and by looking at him he seems as though he is a quiet and scared character who is quite intimated by his sister so that’s why he is at the back.\n\n7. This shot is a close up of one of the characters in the movie and this photo clearly shows you what the character is feeling because by looking at his face you can see the actors emotions, and this allows us to feel what they are feeling. In this image you can tell very clearly that the character is happy as he is smiling and seems very pleased.\n\n8. This image is a perfect example of a extreme close up as it contains just one characters face, this image will definitely help you understand the actors emotions and feelings as it is clearly written on the face. In tis scene you can see that the character seems very in shock as his eyes are very wide open and his nostrils have even flared out showing he is in shock as well as he is scared.\n\n9. This shot is known as a birds eye angle and it is named that because the angle looks directly below the scene showing you the view from if you was looking above it.\n\n10. This is a high level shot as the camera angle looks down onto the subject and the subject is the body that is wrapped around inn the white sheet.\n\n11. This is an eye level shot as it puts the audience on the same level as the characters.\n\n12. This still is a low angle and it is a low angle as the camera looks up to the character."
