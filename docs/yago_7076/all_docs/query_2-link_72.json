        "text": "In every sequel there are certain rules. The sequel has to be bigger then the first. It should have action, more characters, and in some sequels, especially in the teenage-horror genre, the story has to be fast and easy to follow. Jeepers Creepers 2, however, lacks any originality.\n\nThe original Jeepers Creepers was about a man-eating creature that sets its sights on two siblings who are returning home from spring break. This was a good, creative horror movie.\n\nThe intensity of the original Jeepers Creepers horrifying first act ensured the film’s success and also managed to keep up the rest of the movie once the killer was revealed. Director Victor Salva forgets everything he did well in the first film, and does it the opposite way here – with much less success.\n\nJeepers Creepers 2 doesn’t have interesting characters like the first film – it merely has stereotypes posing as characters that are void of any interest or originality. So you don’t care when each victim becomes take-out.\n\nWhat does work however, is the teens’ struggle against a supernatural beast with an eating disorder called The Creeper.\n\nJonathan Breck returns to the role of The Creeper and is charismatic as the monster clothed in his favorite trench coat and ranch hat.\n\nAs its 23 horrifying days of flesh eating come to an end, the creature known as The Creeper embarks on a final feeding frenzy.\n\nAs the film reaches the end, The Creeper is a good horror character. In the first film you didn’t see too much of him, but in Jeepers Creepers 2 you get your fill. Overall Jeepers Creepers 2 contains nothing as good as the first, but, if you’re looking for a fun, fast-paced, monster movie with a few scares, tension, and a couple of cool kills, then this flick should do the trick but I don’t see it getting nominated for the Horror Hall of Fame anytime soon."
