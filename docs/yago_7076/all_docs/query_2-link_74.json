        "meta_description": "The Creepers (Jonathan Breck) dagger from the 2003 horror film Jeepers Creepers 2. In the film, the Creeper (Jonathan Breck) is reaching the end of his 23-day feeding frenzy and comes upon a championship basketball team that has become stranded in their school bus. The Creeper carries an arsenal of handheld weapons like daggers and throwing stars to bring down his victims.pMade from resin, the blade has been finished in a metallic grey to depict metal and the handle in a bone-like shade with a dark finish to portray use. The handle also includes an array of designs featured throughout including screaming bodies and skulls. A creatures face is depicted where the handle meets the blade as the mouth and tongue extend over the blade. pResidual signs of stage blood from production are left on the blade, and though the dagger shows some signs of wear from production use and age, it remains in very good overall condition.",
