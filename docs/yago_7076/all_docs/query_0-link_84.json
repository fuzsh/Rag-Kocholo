        "text": "This has been a big week for film details first we had the first exclusive photos for Silent Hill 2 and now we have an update on Jeepers Creepers 3 which has been long gestating. About every few months we get updates on the film and typically its nothing more then talk on the project.\n\nNow we have an interesting scoop from a reader who goes by the name Jordy. He writes to us to tell us that Jeepers Creepers 3 is finally more then just talk and planning. He writes;\n\nThey are currently filming the movie as we speak. Just got back from Universal Studios, where I saw the Creeper’s truck driving into a sound-stage.\n\nThere is a mixed bag reaction to the Jeepers Creepers movies but for me I absolutely loved them. I felt the first film was creepy beyond belief and had a great script and a talented cast. Jeepers Creepers 2 was not as good as the first film but it was still definitely a fantastic film and as such I have been waiting impatiently for the Creeper to return.\n\nJeepers Creepers 3′s full title is Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral. It is being directed by Victor Salva and will see Jeepers Creepers 2 star Ray Wise return as will Jonathon Breck who plays the creeper. This movie has ties to both the first and second film but also brings in a brand new angle as it goes back to the Wild West and brings in a Native American folklore angle.\n\nA portion of Jeepers Creepers 3 will focus on the character of Trish Jenner from the first film who has a son and names him after her brother Daryry who was murdered by the creeper. The film apparently segways into a revenge angle as she sets out to take down the creeper and avenge her brothers death.\n\nFor me the Creeper is the first good new monster movie we have seen in awhile that is a throw back to classic horror. If you have not seen the original Jeepers Creepers I strongly encourage you to check it out. Are you excited for another Creeper movie? Did you like the first two or am I alone in my passion for it?\n\nUpdate: According to Omaritoto who has commented below Jeepers Creepers 3 is not shooting. Seems that if they are using the truck for anything it might be pizza deliveries but its not for shooting jeepers creepers 3. He tells us;\n\nSorry, dude. Victor Salva is currently filming “Rosewood Lane” in Los Angeles. “Jeepers Creepers 3″ is still just a script waiting to go into production.\n\nTks for the update Omaritoto! Seems that we will have to continue waiting for Jeepers Creepers 3 for awhile yet."
