        "text": "It’s weird to think that Jeepers Creepers was likely one of the last new horror films to scare up a pre-9/11 audience. The film popped up in theaters on August 31st, 2001, an already unassuming time when everyone’s mostly focused on heading back to school and studios typically dump their summer trash before looking ahead at fall.\n\nBut, Jeepers Creepers wasn’t such trash. It was a return-to-form for the monster movie genre, welding roadside urban legends with the unforgiving tenacity of Tobe Hooper’s Texas Chain Saw Massacre. And thanks to a spirited chemistry between a young Justin Long and a post-Ally McBeal Gina Phillips, it was quite enjoyable.\n\nThe same can’t be said of its 2003 sequel, which welded the same story to an agreeable revenge arc led by a crossbow-wielding Leland Palmer (Ray Wise), but altogether, the two films grabbed $120 mil worldwide. Now, after years in development hell, convicted pedophile/director Victor Salva is ready for a third go-around.\n\nRelated Video\n\nAs Variety reports, Myriad Pictures will finance the picture and production is expected to start early next year in Vancouver. The creative team behind the previous two films will return behind the lens, in addition to the Creeper himself, Jonathan Breck. Francis Ford Coppola’s American Zoetrope will produce alongside both Odyssey Media and The Cartel."
