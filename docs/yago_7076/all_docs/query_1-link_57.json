(Very good review, didn't know that he was popular in America until finding out about his new contract with a US channel). Sorry if I am late in making this correction, but you state that Graham Norton is a British late night comedy talk show host, but in fact he's Irish. Born in Co. Dublin, Ireland. I'm not nit-picking, just thought you might like to know for future reference, because some Irish people get offended if they are referred to as British, or English. He also made appearances in an Irish comedy (tho' made by a British channel, Channel 4) Father Ted, as Fr. Noel Furlong, if you can catch the episodes he is in they, like the entire series, are hilarious (one such highlight is an irritating (intentionally) version of Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\").\n\n Sean Carmody\n\nThank you for taking the time to write, and I appreciate your email.\n\nWhat my poor American grammar meant was that the show was British, not that Graham himself was British. In fact, at the show, he mentioned that he was Irish, and was taking a poll of different ex-pats in the audience. There were even some Welsh people!\n\n\"British late night comedy talk show host\" perhaps could be rephrased as \"host of a British late night comedy talk show\".\n\n Adrienne Rappaport\n\nAn Exhibition of Comics by Women\n\nHello! I met the Sequential Tart crew at the last Comic Con, and you are a sharp bunch! I was collecting materials for San Diego State University's library, and your fact sheets thrilled the head of Special Collections. I'm pleased to report another project in the works. The Comics and Sequential Art Club of SDSU is organizing an Exhibition of Comics by Women. This event will run on the Wednesday of Comic-Con week, July 21, 2004, from 10am to 7pm. The exhibition will be at Aztec Center at SDSU. This event will have a unique academic focus, with panel topics selected by the instructors in the Art, Women's Studies and English departments at the university. There will be tables for women to display and sell their comics. There will be more news forthcoming, but spread the word!\n\n Daniel Hager\n\nThanks for letting us know, Daniel  it sounds like a project that will be of great interest to many of our contributors and readers! Please feel free to post press releases and updates about the exhibition on the Tartsville Messageboards.\n\n Marcia Allass\n\nRant Of The Month (Culture Vultures, November 2003)\n\nThe story you're recounting about stifling the creativity of children is the story of my older brother (from whom I gained a love of art) and many of my \"non\" artist friends  the ones that love creativity and loved drawing as kids or even into high school and then had their own creative spirits killed.\n\nIt's good to hear someone else say this.\n\nThe sad thing is, though  this doesn't end with kids. This happens in college, too. I ran into sooo many problems with local universities, before I was able to go to an out-and-out true art school.\n\nFor the SAME calibre of work and creative methods, use of the same mediums, and in the SAME class (life drawing), I have received a \"D\" at one school, and an \"A\" at my current school  the difference being that my current school ENCOURAGED experimentation and innovative techniques as essential to the creative process. I have also had the same piece banned from the school art show there that I was encouraged to display here.\n\nRadical difference in approach.\n\nWhy do people who are supposed to teach creativity so often set out to destroy it? It's always boggled me. I had a professor once who made me resubmit several painting assignments as totally unacceptable (so I just painted others, per her request and kept the originals) because I was, \"pointlessly\" experimenting with texture, mixed media and varied applications of media [which did not violate the criterion of the assignments]  only to see the exact same techniques exhibited in similar manner in the paintings she unveiled in the faculty show at the end of that semester!\n\nIt's ironic, because I'm an artist and I happen to LIKE my work because it's not the same, churned-out stuff I see so many places. It doesn't matter if I know some other artist surpasses me, and there are plenty of artists I look up to and learn from  I like picking up one of my drawings and knowing it's unique, my own, NOT interchangeable with someone else's vision. And when other people like it, too, when someone believes in me enough to put my work in print or up in a show, it makes me happy. But I wouldn't change it just to fit a popular opinion of how it should be if it wasn't something *I* felt, too.\n\nI think that's what art should be for people.\n\nEnjoyed, for God's sake.\n\n Shirl Sazynski\n\nI was very happy to see that so many people responded to my article, with opinions on both sides. And I was relieved to see that I wasn't the only one who had bad experiences with art classes.\n\nI agree with Shirl and others who have posted on the Tartsville boards that there is a time and place for graded art. My intent was never to suggest that people should get no kind of feedback whatsoever on their artistic work. Instead, I believe that there is a right and a wrong time to go about it. First grade  a little harsh  but high school or college  it's needed in order for someone to develop artistically. Further, I agree that there is a right and wrong way to do some elements of artistic work, such as perspective.\n\nIf anything, my article and the responses have made me appreciate artists like Shirl even more. They could take the criticism and continue right on experimenting, not fearing the consequences. But I was quickly discouraged by my bad experiences and have closed the door on drawing or painting. Perhaps this shows that I was never meant to be an artist in the first place.\n\n Deanna Lytle\n\nSmallville Season Three (Culture Vultures, November 2003)\n\nAiyo, just wanted to say how much I agreed with you on the article you wrote about Smallville. As much as I love Lana, I do think there should be more scenes with Clark's other friends (i.e. Pete). Hope the writers at the WB read some of your suggestions, cuz it'll be nice to see some of them materialize.\n\nP.S. Bruce Wayne ???\n\n Wing Chan\n\nGlad you liked the article! I really hope we see more Pete, too. Thankfully, we are seeing more of Chloe these days  and it's not \"mooning-over-Clark\" screen time. She's going to be one heck of a reporter someday.\n\nAnd why not Bruce Wayne?\n\n Rebecca Salek\n\nTart To Heart on Thanksgiving (Columns, November 2003)\n\nThanks to you for mentioning my strip in the \"Thanksgiving\" article! Sequential Tart is the tartiest, if that is an adjective.\n\n Lalo Alcaraz (La Cucaracha daily comic strip)\n\nThanks for noticing. I loved your Day of the Dead cartoon about the (literally) skeletal Muertoville resident who was planning to celebrate the holiday by dressing up as Callista Flockhart (www.ucomics.com/lacucaracha/2003/10/30). (I showed my co-worker Grace Hernandez the one about the dead looking forward to offerings of favorite foods like chicken mole and she said, \"That's what I'm making!\") And I still have a print-out of your St. Patrick's Day/Cinco de Mayo cartoon about ethnic holidays and alcohol marketing blitzes taped above my desk at work.\n\n Margaret O'Connell\n\nQueer Characters: Hook 'Em Up, Then Shoot 'Em Down (Features, April 2002)\n\nMidnighter and Apollo were important in terms of being gay characters as they were in a relationship. I know this sounds simplistic but consider how many neuter gay characters exist in comics  their orientation may be mentioned but they are never shown being gay and by that I don't mean fufilling stereotypes; I mean actually interacting with another gay character in such a way that their sexual preference is displayed.\n\nFuthermore, Morrison's treatment of Beast appals me  by keeping the question Beast's sexuality an open issue, he hopes to not offend certain readers while at the same time throwing some scrap to any gay readers. It's damn manipulative. Also this treatment of established female characters as possible bisexuals is seldom more than an attempt to titillate jaded reader's tastes and is not a serious treatment of the issue.\n\nWhat I would like to see is an openly gay character who, between saving the world, has to deal with what it's like to be a gay person in the real world and who faces challenges that they cannot simply overcome with their superabilities. For example, I got sick of the typical way of dealing with Mid/Apollo's sexuality which is yes, they're gay BUT look how big and tough they are. It's not realistic. For example, I would have liked to have seen Midnighter's reaction to Jack's bigotry at the end of the \"Shiftships\" story arc. You know, perhaps an issue where we saw him and Apollo discuss it or at least a bit more of a reaction.\n\nI am not saying that a gay superhero means that the comic book needs to be completely dedicated to gay issues but neither can the writers simply gloss over them or satirise them or sideline them. Being gay impacts on every aspect of your life  from peoples' reaction to you to your own self-presentation  and comic books should reflect this. Are we putting up with substandard treatment of gay characters because that's all we're getting? It's something we should ask ourselves.\n\nP.S. What interview did Mr. Millar make this statement about superman clones etc? I would like to read the quote in context.\n\n Lara\n\nYou raise a lot of interesting issues, Lara. To answer your last question first: the statement I quoted (in my April 2002 rant Queer Characters: Hook 'Em Up, Then Shoot 'Em Down) came from a March 2002 interview with Mark Millar.\n\nI completely agree with you that until recently, very few gay superheroes  or indeed, any gay characters at all  have been depicted as being in overt sexual or romantic relationships. See my Queer Characters rant and its followup, Queer Characters, Revisited, for a review of some apparently-queer superhero characters and how their relationships have been treated (or ignored).\n\nI do hope that things may be getting better, though. Take a look, for example, at the recent story arc in Gotham Central entitled \"Half a Life.\" In it, longtime DC Comics character Renee Montoya, who's a detective, was unexpectedly and involuntarily outed, and had to deal with the consequences in both her professional and personal lives. IMHO, writer Greg Rucka and artist Michael Lark did a beautiful job on the story. (And, remarkably enough, neither Renee nor her lover Dee got killed off, either at the end of the story or since then.) But even though superheroes and supervillains are woven into the story, neither Renee nor Dee is a superhero.\n\nIn a slightly-less-realistic superhero story in Marvel's Exiles #34, character Mariko (Sunfire), who's a lesbian, got involved with an alternate-universe Mary Jane Watson (that universe's Spider-Woman), even though both women knew that Mariko could be yanked into another dimension at any time. No sometime-bisexual titillation aspect here. Instead, writer Judd Winick appeared to be aiming for a bittersweet tone, though the story (which took up a whopping one issue) seemed a bit perfunctory to me.\n\nOh, by the way: Mariko didn't get killed in this issue. Nope  Judd waited a whole three issues to bump her off. And her death made it possible for the team's long-term hetero couple to get back together ... hmmm. Okay, so maybe Exiles isn't such a good example.\n\nThere are other examples, though. Like Tristan Crane and Ted Naifeh's four-issue mini-series, How Loathsome, from NBM Publishing. HL follows the adventures of a group of gender-queers \"finding [their] way through the endless lonely night.\" Not only do these people have relationships; they have sex. Actual sex. Heck, we get a full-frontal shot of one of the characters sporting a strap-on. Talk about your sexual preference being displayed .... But HL is decidedly not a superhero book.\n\nOther queer superheroes that have recently displayed their preferences? Well, there are Phat and Vivisector, in Marvel's X-Statix. And in Promethea, from America's Best Comics (a DC Comics line), two of the Prometheas, Grace and Stacia, have fallen in love with each other. (Of course, the two also share a body, so it's a bit difficult for them to have sex; but writer Alan Moore and artist J.H. Williams III make it clear that they manage.)\n\nThen there are longtime companions Prototype and Black Velvet, in CrossGen's The CrossOvers, written by openly-gay Robert Rodi. I haven't read any issues of that book in which the characters appeared, though, so I don't know how overt their relationship is.\n\nMy sister Tart, Suzette Chan, seems to agree with you that we're not getting high-quality stories about queer characters. See her opinion piece Hitting the Mylar Ceiling. And I think there's no question that we need to demand more-thoughtful portrayals of queer characters. I'd be interested in hearing what you and other readers think of the portrayals in the books I've mentioned in this response. Are these stories what you're looking for? If not, what's missing?\n\n Denise Sudell\n\nDark Horse Maverick: Happy Endings Review (Report Card, November 2003)\n\nThanks, Rebecca, for your kind words about Happy Endings. I was pretty surprised myself when the Eisner Committee ignored Craig's story altogether, because we did submit it to them for consideration  along with the two Mignolas' Magician and the Snake.\n\nAnd I am indeed putting together more anthologies  the first of which, AutobioGraphix, is currently at the printer and should be in stores by the beginning of December. It features true-life stories by the likes of Frank Miller, Will Eisner, Paul Chadwick, Matt Wagner, Jason Lutes, Eddie Campbell, and Linda Medley, among others.\n\nIn 2004, I'm planning to release my Sexy Chix anthology  the \"sexy chix\" in question being the cartoonists themselves.\n\nAnd in 2005, I will finally get to my dream project: Book of Love.\n\nI hope you'll be happy with the results.\n\n Diana Schutz\n\nHappy Endings was a great collection. Quality anthologies are a rarity, so it was a fortunate find.\n\nI'll definitely pick up AutobioGraphix in December. And I can't wait for Sexy Chix and Book of Love. Sexy Chix in particular sounds like a title the Tarts will like.\n\n Rebecca Salek\n\nUncanny Movies: Shades of Scary! (Culture Vultures, October 2003)\n\nSuzette Chan's review of Jeepers Creepers 2 was interesting. She equates the monster as a symbol of corporate America devouring young men. However, there may be another, simpler take on the movie.\n\nVictor Salva, the director, is a convicted child molester. He forced a boy to perform fellatio on him and made a home movie of it. The police raided his house and got the tape. Instead of the corporate machine symbology that Chan indicates, maybe it was just Salva's personal fantasy of an entity so powerful that not even the police could stop it from victimizing young males.\n\n Ted Skirvin\n\nThank you for reading my article, and for taking time to comment. Your message begged some important questions:\n\n1. Is there only one possible interpretation (or reading) of Jeepers Creepers 2?\n\n2. Does biographical interpretation negate all other readings?\n\n3. Is the threat or depiction of sexual violence toward adolescent males unique to work by child molesters?\n\nI address these points below, and provide some concluding remarks.\n\n1. Is there only one possible interpretation (or reading) of Jeepers Creepers 2?\n\nFirst, I must take issue with your choice of the phrase \"instead of\", which implies that there can be only one reading of the movie. You are certainly welcome to argue an alternate reading, but an alternate reading does not in its existence refute the legitimacy of all other readings. To elaborate on this point, allow me to quote Michel Foucault (cited in Harry M. Benshoff's 1997 book, Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film):\n\n\"... we must conceive discourse as a series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is neither uniform nor stable. To be more precise, we must not imagine a world of discourse and excluded discourse, or between the dominant discourse and the dominated one; but as a multiplicity of discursive elements that can come into play in various strategies.\"\n\nSecond, you have not refuted the signs which I indicated point to a socio-economic reading of Jeepers Creepers 2. The film draws the corporate parallel, with emphasis on the different classes in this football universe: the star athletes, the secondary players, the support staff, the coaches, the cheerleaders and the sportswriter, a precariously positioned figure as he is supposed to be at once a team booster and an objective reporter. Differences in race and sexuality are also explicitly discussed. Scott accuses the black coach of favouring the black quarterback on the basis of common skin colour at the expense of team performance. He also calls the closeted sports writer \"the biggest threat to every swinging dick on this bus\", echoing the societal suppression of gays in the polis (the argument that gays should not be seen, heard or acknowledged in public). These scenes contribute to a not-so-subtle subtext of the team as a microcosm for a stratified corporation, captained by a white, heterosexual patriarchy, competing in a martketplace economy against other, similar socio-economic units (i.e. rival teams).\n\nMany horror movies since the 1970s have placed an emphasis on socio-economic discourse. In her 1992 book Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film, Carol J. Clover notes that the murderous, human-sausage-making family in 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (recently re-made) were \"[o]nce top workers in the local slaughterhouse, now displaced by mechanization\". Benshoff writes that George Romero's 1978 shopping mall zombie flick Dawn of the Dead (a re-make will be released next year) \"suggested that US consumer culture had already turned 'normal' citizens into mind-numbing, flesh-eating monsters.\" Given that CBS recently pulled the broadcast of a new TV movie about Ronald Reagan, I doubt we will soon see a big studio remake of Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs (1991), a bald political allegory of an underclass kept hidden in the basement of a perfect suburban house lorded over by gross parodies of Ronald and Nancy Reagan.\n\nI mention this history of Marxist discourse in horror films because Jeepers Creepers 2 is very aware of its entry in the horror genre and employs or pays overt homage to the genre's major tropes, including socio-economic repression (as I've just outlined), sexual repression/gender performance (in films from Nosferatu to Psycho to Jeepers Creepers 2 and beyond), rural vs. urban/nature vs. civilization (e.g. The Birds, which is explicitly quoted in Jeepers Creepers 2, when a player, trapped in a seemingly innocuous murder of crows, is derisively nicknamed \"Tippi Hedren\" by the other boys). All these readings may co-exist, but none trumps the others.\n\n2. Does biographical interpretation negate all other readings?\n\nPersonal testimony dominates much of the mass broadcast discourse in America (I'm thinking of shows from Oprah to The Early Show to docudramas like the recently broadcast TV movies about Jessica Lynch and Elizabeth Smart). Biographically-centered readings of films are also seductive. We generally know a little bit about the filmmakers' personal lives, usually through mainstream interviews which focus on their lives rather than their craft or ideas. It's tempting to make use of this prurient information, however selectively it was transmitted (e.g. through a news story about a director's indiscretions) or revealed (often by the director him or herself in promotional interviews).\n\nBut while every work made by an artist contains by definition something of the artist  his or her experiences, views, or even just a favoured storytelling technique  not every work is confessional. Genre films especially are structured first and foremost upon generic precedent. Personal expressions are evident in any work of craft, but their meanings are often obscured by the demands of the genre.\n\nTo follow through your biographical reading of Jeepers Creepers 2, the director, Victor Salva, has created an avatar through which he can fulfill a fantasy of unfettered sexual access to young boys. (For the benefit of readers who have not seen the film, it should be noted that the characters are in their senior year, and assumed to be 18 or at least over the legal age for sexual consent in most jurisdictions. The actors appear to be of age, but I do not have access to complete and reliable biographical information for all cast members.) However, Salva chose the wrong genre to act as a vehicle for his escapist fantasies. The monster is always killed or at least quelled (however temporarily) at the end of every monster film, usually by a mob of angry villagers (the farmer and his family in Jeepers Creepers 2). Is Salva then signaling that he has committed pedophilic acts in the past, that he considers his time in jail to be a form of martyrdom, and that it is inevitable that he will re-offend?\n\nIn a subtler reading, you might suggest that the monster represents not Salva himself but repressed pedophilic urges within Salva's psyche. But for this reading to work, Salva would have to see himself not as the monster but as the busload of teens or rural folk who are doomed to fail in vanquishing the pedophilic monster. In other words, he would have to see himself as the eternal victim, and not as the fantastical perpetrator, as you suggest.\n\nSalva's criminal record been public for some years now. In 1988, Salva was convicted of molesting a boy whom he videotaped in sexual situations; he served 15 months of a three-year sentence (more information is available on Andrew Vachss's web site, The Zero). The conviction was revealed years later when the victim launched a campaign to boycott Salva's 1995 Disney-financed film Powder. The conviction is now as much part of Salva's resume as his films. It was widely reported upon the release of the first Jeepers Creepers movie in 2001, and, to a lesser extent, upon the release of Jeepers Creepers 2 in September 2003. It is also noted in unofficial biographies of Salva on Internet Movie Database, Yahoo.com and Tribute.ca. In 1999, Salva told the San Jose Mercury News:\n\n\"It's not like I don't know the terrible ramifications of my actions,\" he says. \"I've been very upfront with the family. I've been very upfront with everybody about what happened. I've done my time. I've paid restitution. I've done everything possible.\"\n\nIt's probably a very good thing that Salva's past is known and that he is supervised while, or kept away from directing children. However, he served his prison sentence and that, along with a vow never to repeat this type of crime, are all he owes society at large.\n\nStill, we have to consider how Salva's films would read to a person who does not know about the conviction. Is there anything in the films for the viewer to understand? What is a person to make of what they see in front of them? If a film, novel, play, comic book, painting or any other cultural product can be interpreted only through a biographical filter, would that piece of work be anything more than a diary entry?\n\nIt's interesting to test the usefulness of biographical interpretation in analyzing the works of Roman Polanski, a director with whom Salva has artistic and biographical commonalities. Polanski's personal life is more eventful and famous than most films. His biography was first famous for including a childhood escape from a trip to a Nazi death camp, where his mother eventually died. In 1969, his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was one of six people brutally murdered by the Charles Manson gang. In 1977, he was charged with having sex with a 13-year-old girl. (Some speculate that Polanski was still emotionally traumatized by Tate's murder and therefore not in his right mind when he had sex with the girl, an argument that uses Polanski's biography to interpret his biography.) Responding to rumours that the judge would impose a harsh 50-year jail sentence (a brief summary of the case is online at BBCi), Polanski fled from the United States, where he is still considered a fugitive.\n\nSo how does the knowledge of a small set of publicly known events in Polanski's life contribute to the interpretation of his movies? Polanski turned down an offer from Steven Spielberg to direct Schindler's List because it was a heroic narrative, and Polanski did not see heroism during the Nazi occupation of Poland, only arbitrariness and chance. The Pianist was a better reflection on his experience. But the film is not a strict biography of Polanski's life. In fact, it's about another man altogether, the concert pianist Wladislaw Szpilman. Because Polanski was a child when he was saved from the concentration camp, he would not have had any of the same experiences as Szpilman, who was an adult and a successful young musician at the time. If a biographical interpretation of The Pianist cannot hold up, what then, is the movie about? Is it about anything other than Polanski? Conversely, is it only about Polanski?\n\nAnd what of Polanski's other films? His body of work is eclectic: The Tenant, Repulsion, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Tess, Death and the Maiden, The Ninth Gate, The Pianist. These films show wide-ranging interests, but do not in themselves offer clues about the director's biography. We might glibly point to some instances of simpatico between elements of each film and highlights of Polanski's biography (Polanski survived the Holocaust and The Pianist is about a Holocaust survivor; Polanski's unfairly prosecuted sex crime is emblematic of an unjust regime in Death and the Maiden, etc.). But these references merely confirm knowledge of the handful of salacious events we happen to know of Polanski's life, rather than offer illumination on the ideas developed in Polanski's movies.\n\nOne last question: what can we possibly make of art that is made by people whose lives we know nothing about? Does our almost complete ignorance of the biography  even the identity  of Shakespeare impair our reading of plays published in his name? Four hundred years of Shakespearan scholarship seem to indicate that there is enough in the work itself to keep us going.\n\n3. Is the threat or depiction of sexual violence toward adolescent males unique to work by child molesters?\n\nInsofar as the biographies of directors of horror movies are known, a conspicuous minority are convicted child molesters (Polanski, Salva). The vast majority represent a wide range of sexual proclivities, from the unremarkably commonplace to the quirky to the possibly, but non-criminally, psychotic (I will leave it to the reader to decide who falls in which part of the spectrum): Clive Barker, Kathryn Bigelow, Tim Burton, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, David Cronenberg, Brian de Palma, Alfred Hitchcock, Peter Jackson, John Landis, David Lynch, M. Night Shyamalan, Ed Wood). Yet the trope of the violation of the male body by another male (the violation often plays as a displacement of homosexual desire), occurs in films from Nosferatu to The Lord of the Rings.\n\nIn Monsters in the Closet, film scholar Harry Benshoff argues that the conflation of homosexuality and monsters has a long history in film, but that the association of homosexuality and monstrousness dated further back, in the preceding \"pop culture\" vehicle of gothic novels. A revival of the literary form coincided with the emergence of a clinical discourse on homosexuality.\n\nThe novel which looms largest in the canon of gothic literature and film is Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus. Initially a benign creature, Frankenstein's monster sets off a murderous chain of events when he kills a five-year-old boy who refuses to befriend him. Uncannily, the literary passage is prescient of a criminal case studied by sexologist Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, who proposed the term \"Urning\" to describe \"a passive, effeminate, male homosexual\":\n\n\"After several relatively dormant decades, gothic writing flourished again during the latter half of the nineteen century. Also at this time, homosexual \"underworlds\" began to be acknowledged in many European cities, and early sexologists such as Richard von Kraftt-Ebing and Karl Heinrich Ulrichs began to argue that same-sex relations should be understood in terms medical rather than criminal. Ulrichs also perhaps unwittingly contributed to the monster-homosexual equation in 1869 when he wrote \"Incubus: Urning-love and bloodlust\" in response to a particularly violent rape and murder of a five-year-old boy.\"\n\nE. T. W. Hoffman's short story, \"The Sand-Man\", published one year before Frankenstein, depicted a coded molestation of a child by a man angry at being discovered engaged in a secret ritual with the boy's father. The angry man is characterized as lisping and hissing.\n\n\"\"Eyes here! Eyes here!\" cried Coppelius, in a hollow sepulchral voice. My blood ran cold with horror; I screamed and tumbled out of my hiding-place into the floor. Coppelius immediately seized upon me. \"You little brute! You little brute!\" he bleated, grinding his teeth. Then, snatching me up, he threw me on the hearth, so that the flames began to singe my hair. \"Now we've got eyes  eyes  a beautiful pair of children's eyes,\" he whispered, and, thrusting his hands into the flames he took out some red-hot grains and was about to strew them into my eyes. Then my father clasped his hands and entreated him, saying, \"Master, master, let my Nathanael keep his eyes  oh! do let him keep them.\" Coppelius laughed shrilly and replied, \"Well then, the boy may keep his eyes and whine and pule his way through the world; but we will now at any rate observe the mechanism of the hand and the foot.\" And therewith he roughly laid hold upon me, so that my joints cracked, and twisted my hands and my feet, pulling them now this way, and now that, \"That's not quite right altogether! It's better as it was!  the old fellow knew what he was about.\" Thus lisped and hissed Coppelius; but all around me grew black and dark; a sudden convulsive pain shot through all my nerves and bones I knew nothing more.\"\n\nIn an essay parsing \"The Sand-Man\", Freud theorized a \"substitutive relationship between the eye and the male organ.\" This would make Coppelius a male, castrating figure. Readers of Neil Gaiman's The Sandman may recognize something of The Corinthian in Coppelius. The Corinthian is the embodiment of a very bad nightmare; he has teeth for eyes and eats the eyes of young boys. In The Sandman Companion, Gaiman tells Hy Bender that the name The Corinthian is \"a seventeenth-century slang word for a licentious rake who does things like frequent brothels. But Sandman's Corinthian doesn't have sex; he eats eyeballs. And he's homosexual, in the sense that he prefers to eat the eyeballs of boys.\" (Clover theorizes that violence is what the impotent killers in slasher films do instead of having sex; Benshoff writes that violence is what repressed madmen do instead of acknowledging homosexual desire.)\n\nViewers of the first Jeepers Creepers movie will remember that the twist in monster's project is to harvest the eyes of not the sexy sister, as horror audiences might expect, but of the nubile brother. At that late revelation, the entire film gains a homo-erotic reading in retrospect.\n\nWith regard to The Lord of the Rings, which relies on elements of horror, Tolkien's text best articulates the underlying equation of homosexual desire and monstrousness which has been (faithfully) translated to the screen by Peter Jackson. In Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien describes Boromir's attempt to snatch the ring from Frodo in terms of an attempted rape. \"Why not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by force. For I am too strong for you, halfling.\" Note that Boromir tries to make Frodo complicit in his own rape, complicity being the chief element of modern horror, according to Joyce Carol Oates (see the introduction to her short story collection, Haunted).\n\nIn The Two Towers, Tolkien clearly describes Grishnakh's groping Merry and Pippin as a sexualized violation: \"A long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. Dimly, they were aware of Grishnakh's great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw and feel them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.\" In Freudian terms, Grishnakh's phallic fingers seek the child-like hobbit's sphincteral ring.\n\nPromotional stills of Jackson's Return of the King (to be released Dec. 17th) hints at the trauma Frodo faced after being defeated by the Shelob monster. In the novel, Frodo's report to Sam reads like testimony about a Rohipnol-assisted gang rape: \"Something hit me, didn't it? And I fell into darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. Orcs were all around me. I think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat. My head grew clear but I was aching and weary. They stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, questioned me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.\"\n\nYears into the literary association of homosexuality with the monstrous, the suggested sexual victimization of young men has lost none of its power to traumatize. However, the threats became as much internal as external.\n\nInattentive viewers of Wes Craven's 1984 film A Nightmare on Elm Street may have missed the cues that code Johnny Depp's character as gay. Depp plays Glen, a star quarterback (star quarterbacks have enormous gay cachet) who wears pink Izod sweaters and seems secretly relieved that his girlfriend Nancy wants to remain a virgin. Freddy, being a monster of the id, decides to dispatch the not-man by opening a giant vagina dentata underneath him while he sleeps chastely with a TV between his legs. Another boy, a juvenile delinquent and heterosexual Lothario, is also killed while sleeping, but in a prison bunk. One of the greatest fears associated with incarceration is the threat of male on male rape. The point is made explicit when a bedsheet winds itself into a long, hard phallus that snakes around the sleeping boy's neck and hangs him, suggestive of a sexual asphyxiation.\n\nThe bottom line is that the fear of bodily violation is a core human fear. It's expressed in every haunted house tale, in every rape narrative, in every military invasion story, in every vampire movie, in every viral epidemic novel. But it is in the topsy-turvy world of horror that textual and subtextual exploration of that fear can be pushed to socially unacceptable areas.\n\nB-movie director David DeCocteau told Outlooks Magazine that he's not a huge fan of horror, but chooses to work in the genre because \"horror is one of the few genres in which you can really experiment with sexuality and still get away with making it commercial or inoffensive.\"\n\nThe deal between the genre director and the audience is that, the director gets to depict or suggest horrifying scenarios that touch our deepest fears as long as the movie ends with the cessation of horror and the status quo is restored, more or less. Elm Street is safe to sleep in once Nancy defeats Freddy, but Nancy's mother has died for having harboured a terrible secret. Erin in the re-make of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre embraces the juvenile delinquent she was before the adventure began, but now she is as catatonic and incapable of warning others of danger as the doomed hitchhiker she tried to save. The monster in Jeepers Creepers 2 returns to a cocoon state and is safely hung on the wall for curious future audiences to gawk at, for a fee, until he wakes again.\n\nConcluding Comments\n\nAn individual horror film is the accretion of almost 100 years of plot, character, thematic and cinematic tropes. The primacy of fulfilling these conventions can admit biographical readings (while he did not write Vertigo, the film can be said to be about Hitchcock's obsession with Grace Kelly), but ultimately frustrates the biographical project. Horror is also a highly metaphorical form which derives much of its power from displacing deep fears into a known but fantastical (and therefore not-real) quantity, such as monsters.\n\nMainstream reviewers with an \"auteur\" bias have a difficult time discussing genre films specifically because the generic requirements obscure any personal statements which may be discerned. As Carol Clover suggests:\n\n\"[Cinematic horror's] basic structures of apperception are fixed and fundamental. The same is true of the stories they tell. Students of folklore or early literature recognize in horror the hallmarks of oral narrative: the free exchange of themes and motifs, the archetypal characters and situations, the accumulation of sequels, remakes, imitations. The is a field in which there is in some sense no original, no real or right text, but only variants; a world in which, therefore, the meaning of the individual example lies outside itself. The \"art\" of the horror film, like the \"art\" of pornography, is to a very large extent the art of rendition or performance, and it is understood as such by the competent audience. A particular example may have original features, but its quality as a horror film lies in the way it delivers the cliché.\"\n\nI've touched on Marxist, Freudian, queer and structural readings, but there are other strategies to explore: the relationship of the viewer and the text, the relationship of the movie to other horror movies, feminist interpretations, analyses of representation (Annette Kuhn outlines different interpretive strategies for science fiction films in the 1990 book Alien Zone). Your biographical reading of Jeepers Creepers 2 is not groundless. However, it is not the most strongly supportable, and is but one reading among many.\n\n Suzette Chan"
