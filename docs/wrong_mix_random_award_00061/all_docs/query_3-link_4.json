        "text": "Introduction\n\n“No competition can exist between two producers of a commodity when one of them has the power to prescribe both the price and output of the other.”\n\n—U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Interstate & Foreign Commerce\n\n“In short, the choice is between a Bell System restrained by neither regulation nor true competition and a Bell System reorganized in such a way as to diminish greatly the possibility of future anticompetitive behavior.”\n\n—U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n\nA handful of digital platforms exert increasing control over key arteries of American commerce and communications. Structuring access to markets, these firms function as gatekeepers for billions of dollars in economic activity. By virtue of setting marketplace rules for the millions of merchants, producers, and developers dependent on their infra­structure, dominant platforms today “function as regulators.”\n\nAs these platforms further concentrate market power, there are rising concerns about their size—usually in reference to the large share that each firm captures of its primary markets. Yet an equally important question concerns not the scale of these companies but their structure. One feature dominant digital platforms share is that they have integrated across business lines such that they both operate a platform and market their own goods and services on it. This structure places dominant platforms in direct competition with some of the businesses that depend on them, creating a conflict of interest that platforms can exploit to further entrench their dominance, thwart competition, and stifle innovation.\n\nConsider Spotify’s effort to reach users through Apple’s iPhone while Apple sought to promote Apple Music. In 2016, Spotify revealed that Apple had blocked the streaming application from the App Store, “continu[ing] a troubling pattern of behavior by Apple to exclude and diminish the competitiveness of Spotify on iOS and as a rival to Apple Music.” Or take the challenge faced by Yelp, Foundem, and scores of online services to reach internet users while Google sought to build out its own competitor offerings. In Europe and India, competition author­ities have found that Google ranks its own services higher than those offered by rivals, a “search bias” that means anyone competing with Google properties may effectively disappear from Google search results. Merchants that rely on Amazon to reach consumers are in a similar bind: Not only must they jostle for placement against Amazon’s own goods, but they also face the constant risk that Amazon will spot their bestselling items and produce them itself. Facebook, equipped with technology that lets it detect which rival apps are succeeding, would often give companies a choice: Be acquired by Facebook, or watch it roll out a direct replica. Competing with one of these giants on the giant’s own turf is rife with hazards.\n\nVenture capitalists now factor this risk into their investment decisions. Indeed, the power of these gatekeeper platforms to steer the fate of countless other firms is described by entrepreneurs and investors as “having a profound impact on innovation in Silicon Valley” and “choking off the start-up world.” Venture capitalists now discuss a “kill-zone” around digital giants—“areas not worth operating or investing in, since defeat is guaranteed.” Discussing how tech platform giants today use their integrated structure to undermine rivals, a product manager who worked for Microsoft leading up to its antitrust suit observed, “It’s what we did at Microsoft.”\n\nIndeed, the way in which dominant online platforms threaten to undermine competition and distort markets today is not entirely new. At its core, the problem traces to a basic challenge posed by firms that capture control over a critical network or channel of distribution. Regulators and competition authorities have traditionally harnessed a set of tools to ensure that bottleneck facilities do not distort competition. These tools include common carriage, which requires firms to offer customers equal access on equal terms, as well as interoperability, which requires networks to maintain an open interface, enabling users to switch between platforms with ease. These policies respond, respectively, to problems of discrimi­nation and lock-in.\n\nIn digital markets, however, third parties that depend on a platform risk not just discrimination and lock-in but also appropriation. Because dominant platforms monitor with unrivaled precision the business activity of third parties while also competing with them, a platform can harvest insights gleaned from a producer at the producer’s expense.\n\nThis Article argues that these combined problems of discrimination and information appropriation invite recovering common carriage’s forgotten cousin: structural separations. Structural separations place clear limits on the lines of business in which a firm can engage. Rather than prohibit particular business practices, separations proscribe certain organizational structures. In antitrust, structural remedies are contrasted with behavioral ones: Whereas behavioral remedies seek to prevent firms from engaging in specific types of conduct, structural remedies seek to eliminate the incentives that would make that conduct possible or likely in the first place.\n\nStructural prohibitions have been a traditional element of American economic regulation. They have been applied as a standard regulatory tool and key antitrust remedy in network industries, often to prohibit a dominant intermediary from competing with the businesses that depend on it to get to market. While common carriage regimes prevent a firm from discriminating—requiring equal service on equal terms—structural prohibitions eliminate one source of the incentive to discriminate. In this way, common carriage and structural separations often functioned as complements in the service of nondiscrimination.\n\nToday, structural separations have largely been abandoned. At the same time that lawmakers have significantly weakened or outright elimi­nated sector-specific regulatory regimes, judicial interpretation of antitrust law has drastically narrowed the forms of vertical conduct and structures that register as anticompetitive. And when antitrust enforcers have targeted these forms of conduct and structures in recent years, they’ve applied remedies that generally (1) fail to target the underlying source of the problem and (2) overwhelm the institutional capacities of the government actors assigned to oversee them. Neglecting structural separations results in both substantive harms and institutional misalign­ments—effects that are especially pronounced in digital markets.\n\nThis Article seeks to give structural separations a seat back at the table. Its contribution is twofold. First, it demonstrates that both the risk and cost of information appropriation are heightened in digital markets, rendering conduct remedies especially ineffective and structural remedies critical. Dominant digital platforms passively capture highly precise and nuanced data on their business customers, infor­mation that they can exploit when competing against those same customers. These data are more valuable by virtue of being more sophisticated—and more likely to be exploited given their value. This risk of appropriation coupled with discrimination, moreover, is especially harmful in digital platform markets, given the important role platforms play as innovation catalysts. Even within a framework where only welfare-based harms justify regulatory interventions, the likely innovation harms stemming from platform appropriation and discrimination invite serious consideration of structural limits.\n\nSecond, this Article identifies the host of functional goals that motivated previous separations regimes, ranging from fair competition and system resiliency to media diversity and administrability. These concerns register in a norma­tively pluralistic framework: While some are cognizable in terms of welfare economics, others appeal to a broader set of democratic and institu­tionalist values. In the context of business and market structure, these distinct values sometimes align—such that a separation that promotes a robust marketplace of ideas also promotes dynamic efficiency—while in other instances they are in tension.\n\nAfter identifying the tradition of structural separations and the diverse set of concerns that motivated them, this Article explores whether integration by dominant tech platforms poses risks and challenges analogous to those previously addressed through separations. It closes by briefly sketching out relevant considerations for separating platforms and commerce and identifying likely challenges.\n\nThis Article is a project in diagnosis and intellectual recovery. It seeks to provide a general analytical framework for thinking through problems stemming from integration by dominant digital platforms and to identify principles through which Congress and agencies can issue policy prescriptions to remedy them. Its goal is to enrich our under­standing of the tools and remedies through which lawmakers and regulators have previously addressed integration by dominant intermediaries—an effort in recovery necessitated by the abandonment of traditional regula­tory interventions and partial collapse of antitrust. Several questions that this Article only partially engages—such as how to scope and design specific separations in digital markets—invite deeper study.\n\nSeveral factors render this project especially timely. First, the central role dominant platforms play in structuring access to online commerce and communications is prompting both scholarly and policy discussions about whether these firms should be designated as forms of infra­structure or essential services, meriting regulatory interventions coupled with reinvigorated antitrust. Second, after years of retreating from structural remedies in favor of behavioral ones, antitrust enforcers are confronting the difficulty of enforcing pure conduct remedies and asking whether greater reliance on structural interventions would better promote competition. And third, a neo-Brandeisian movement is refo­cusing attention on the structural underpinnings of the competitive process, critiquing the current welfare-based approach for both betraying the founding values of antitrust and failing on its own terms.\n\nPart I of this Article documents how dominant digital platforms use their integrated structure to engage in both discrimination and infor­mation appropriation and reviews why this conduct likely undermines innovation. Part II traces the institutional and doctrinal shifts that account for the retreat from structural separations. Part III reviews five instances in which separations were implemented. Part IV identifies the set of harms that lawmakers, regulators, and enforcers sought to address through structural separations and the functional goals they aspired to promote. Part V examines whether integration by dominant platforms gives rise to analogous harms, briefly explores what a separations framework for digital intermediaries might look like, and identifies likely challenges and questions that remain unresolved. The Appendix engages the relevant economic literature to examine why platforms would act in ways that risk undermining their ecosystems.\n\nI. Integration by Dominant Digital Platforms\n\nDominant digital platforms serve as critical intermediaries of online commerce and communications. Reflecting on the vital role these firms now play, the Supreme Court has described Facebook, Google, and other online providers as serving as the “modern public square,” while law­makers have analogized Amazon to a nineteenth-century railroad. Govern­ments around the world have initiated studies and investigations examining the market power these firms enjoy. The dominant digital platforms differ in important ways: They have different business models, different value chains, and different primary markets. But one critical feature they share is the dual role they play in select markets: as both an operator of a dominant platform that hosts third-party merchants, content creators, or app developers, and as a market partic­ipant that competes with those same producers. This Part reviews some of the markets in which online platforms are integrated and the practices this integrated structure enables.\n\nA. Amazon\n\nAmazon provides a host of different services. It is the dominant online marketplace, the world’s largest cloud computing service, a massive shipping and logistics network, a media producer and distrib­utor, a grocer, a small-business lender, a live video-gaming streaming platform, a digital home assistant, a designer of apparel, and an online pharmacy. Two areas where it both serves as a bottleneck facility and competes with those reliant on its bottleneck include online retail and digital home-assistant systems.\n\n1. Marketplace/AmazonBasics. — In Amazon’s early days, it operated primarily as an online retailer: It would procure goods at wholesale prices from suppliers and then sell them at retail prices to consumers. In 1999 it introduced Auctions, an online auctions service, and zShops, a fixed-price marketplace business—services that would evolve into the Amazon Marketplace, an open platform on which other merchants could list their products to sell directly to consumers. Unlike selling wholesale to Amazon, selling through the Marketplace permitted suppliers to maintain control over retail pricing and shipping. Inviting producers to sell through Amazon Marketplace significantly expanded the catalogue of goods available on Amazon’s platform, while freeing Amazon of the risk of purchasing inventory.\n\nThis dramatic expansion in product selection has helped Amazon become the dominant online marketplace in the United States. The platform is estimated to capture 52.4% of all U.S. online retail spending and 56.1% of the segment’s traffic, while 54% of all product searches originate on Amazon. Amazon’s share of ecommerce is more than double the market share of its next nine competitors combined, and even merchants who list products on other sites can come to rely upon Amazon for up to 90% of their sales. For many merchants, “Not being on Amazon doesn’t feel like an option.”\n\nMarketplace sales are a lucrative and booming part of Amazon’s overall business. Amazon charges merchants either a $39.99 monthly subscription fee or a 99¢ per-item flat fee, depending on the plan, as well as a percentage of each transaction. Analysts estimate that 52% of unit-goods and 68% of total Amazon sales derived from Marketplace merchants in 2018. The service fees Amazon charges third-party sellers generated $42.75 billion in 2018, comprising around 18% of the company’s net sales and its second-largest revenue segment. Revenue from seller commissions is outpacing Amazon’s overall online sales.\n\nIn addition to serving as a major marketplace for third-party sellers, Amazon now also sells Amazon-branded goods on its platform. It first began offering private labels in 2009, primarily selling commodity goods such as batteries and HDMI cables. In the decade since, its private-label business has expanded to include toys, shoes, apparel, jewelry, coffee, baby wipes, furniture, mattresses, vitamins, towels, and pet food, among other products. Amazon has around 137 private-label brands—with just one of these brands accounting for over 1,500 distinct products. Analysts estimate that Amazon’s private-label sales amounted to $7.5 billion in 2018 and will reach $25 billion by 2022.\n\nAmazon exploits this dual role—marketplace operator and marketplace merchant—in two ways: first, by implementing Marketplace policies that privilege Amazon as a seller and give it greater control over brands and pricing, and, second, by appropriating the business infor­mation of third-party merchants. One way that Amazon has favored Amazon goods and services is by presenting itself as the default seller even when Marketplace vendors have offered lower prices. A ProPublica investigation discovered that Amazon engineers its ranking algorithm to favor its own products as well as those sold by merchants that buy Amazon’s fulfillment services. Since an estimated 82% of Amazon sales go to the top listing—namely, whoever wins the Amazon “Buy Box”—this self-preferential treatment is an “oft-decisive advantage.” Amazon also appears to have privileged Amazon goods in promotional place­ments. According to The Capitol Forum, Amazon prioritizes its own clothing brands in its space for sponsored placements and appears to restrict competitors’ access to this placement, directing consumers toward its own products over those sold by rivals. Even when a customer goes on a Marketplace merchant’s product page, Amazon will show prominent ads and pop-ups directing customers to Amazon’s own products instead.\n\nA second way Amazon has favored itself as a seller is through implementing Marketplace policies that enable it to become the exclusive merchant of certain products. According to news reports, Amazon encourages brands to sell directly to Amazon in exchange for Amazon’s commitment to enforce the brand’s minimum advertised prices (MAP) on Amazon. Enforcing this policy, Amazon expels any third parties selling lower than the MAP, sometimes leaving Amazon as the only remaining seller. Last November, Amazon also signed a deal to become an authorized reseller of Apple’s devices—an agreement that prompted Amazon to delist any Apple products sold by Marketplace merchants who are not authorized Apple resellers. Since one of the requirements for becoming an authorized Apple reseller includes purchasing a certain minimum amount of product directly from Apple, most independent merchants will no longer be able to sell Apple products on Amazon.\n\nAnother policy change Amazon has instituted is requiring certain brands on Marketplace to instead sell wholesale to Amazon—granting Amazon the ability to set the retail price and maintain exclusive access to certain sales and customer data.\n\nIn theory, efforts by Amazon to enter exclusive or semiexclusive agreements with brands could be understood as an effort by Amazon to combat counterfeits, which proliferate on Amazon. But in practice, Amazon also seems to use its ability to decide whether or not to police counterfeits as leverage against brands who might otherwise refrain from selling on Amazon. Nike, for example, for years refused to list its products on Amazon. Faced with a situation where merchants were selling both authentic and fake Nike goods on Marketplace anyway, Nike ultimately signed an agreement to sell wholesale to Amazon in exchange for stricter policing of counterfeits. An executive from Birkenstock—which stopped supplying products to Amazon in 2017—stated that the only way a brand or supplier can get Amazon to fully commit to policing counterfeits is to sell its entire catalogue to Amazon. Even as Amazon professes a “zero tolerance” policy for counterfeit products, reports suggest that not only has the company “resisted calls to do more to police its site,” but that it has “thrived” from this practice, given the additional leverage that counterfeiters give Amazon over brands and merchants. Indeed, sellers confronting any host of difficulties on Amazon’s site—ranging from abrupt account suspensions to sabotage campaigns by rivals—soon learn that “the solution is often to more fully meld with Amazon” in ways that provide Amazon with more revenue, more control, or greater access to a merchant’s sensitive business information. Earlier this year, Amazon announced that sellers looking to fight counterfeiters and manage other problems on its platform could purchase a new service from Amazon for $30,000 to $60,000 a year. The rapid growth of Amazon’s digital ad business suggests brands may increasingly need to buy advertising in order to attract more customer clicks.\n\nSeparate from policies that explicitly or implicitly require merchants and vendors to buy additional Amazon services, sellers worry about subtler forms of discrimination. There are numerous means by which Amazon can disfavor any particular merchant: It can suspend or shut down accounts overnight, withhold merchant funds, change page displays, and throttle or block favorable reviews.\n\nIn addition to implementing Marketplace policies that favor Amazon’s direct sales, Amazon appropriates Marketplace merchants’ data to shape its own retail strategy. By virtue of hosting a digital marketplace, Amazon’s ability to collect and analyze ecommerce data is unrivaled. While even large brick-and-mortar stores can track consumer purchase histories and brand sales, the information Amazon harvests is far more sophisticated and precise. In addition to tracking overall trends, it captures which goods a customer clicked on but did not buy, the exact price change that induced a customer to peruse an item or purchase it, how long a user hovers her mouse over a particular good, how customers are reacting to product images and videos, and a wealth of other microdetails that add up to a formidable—and constantly evolving—arsenal of market intelligence. It is as if a shopping mall tracked not only all the foot traffic into a store, but also which items caught a customer’s glance, which products made it into the shopping cart but were never purchased, as well as complete transaction and revenue data and all customer reviews. All of this information is gathered not just on products Amazon sells but also on third-party merchants, giving Amazon an unprecedented vantage point over 50% of ecommerce in the United States.\n\nReports suggest Amazon uses this trove of Marketplace data to inform both its retail business and its private labels. In some cases, Amazon has responded to popular items introduced by third-party merchants by sourcing those same products directly from the manufac­turer and demoting the third-party merchants in search results. One study found that in the case of women’s clothing, Amazon “began selling 25 percent of the top items first sold through marketplace vendors.” Its private label, meanwhile, has also closely tracked successful Marketplace items. While AmazonBasics—Amazon’s private-label brand—initially focused on generic goods like batteries and blank DVDs, it has since expanded into a much broader array of products. For a few years “the house brand ‘slept quietly as it retained data about other sellers’ successes.’” As Amazon now rolls out more AmazonBasics products, it is clear that the company has used “insights gleaned from its vast Web store to build a private-label juggernaut that now includes more than 3,000 products.”\n\nInitial empirical work suggests that Amazon’s entry into competition with third-party merchants does not affect product price or customer satisfaction but does dissuade third-party sellers from continuing to offer the product. Merchants, especially small ones, “are discouraged from growing their business on the platform.”\n\n2. Alexa/Alexa Devices/Alexa Skills. — Another area in which Amazon both serves as a primary platform and competes with platform services is the voice computing market. Amazon jump-started the voice assistant market in 2015 when it publicly rolled out the Echo, its smart speaker, embedded with Alexa, the artificial intelligence software that serves as a voice assistant. An early mover in this market, Amazon remains dominant.\n\nThe applications that power Alexa—that enable it to perform particular tasks—are called “skills.” Skills execute various requests: They can dim your kitchen lights, offer recipe ideas, and provide allergy forecasts with precise pollen counts. Skills are created by third-party developers, who have built over 80,000 skills for Alexa. Meanwhile, a host of manufacturers have produced Alexa-compatible devices or appliances.\n\nWhile third-party skills developers and manufacturers are critical to expanding the Alexa ecosystem, Amazon also actively competes with both. Amazon has recently introduced dozens of new features and devices, including an Alexa-enabled microwave, security camera, subwoofer, and smart plug—smart devices that existing Amazon partners had already been providing. Given how Amazon uses Marketplace data, it seems reasonable to assume that Amazon uses its retail platform for insight into sales of current smart devices, which then informs its production strategy. In 2015, Amazon launched the $100 million Alexa Fund, which supports voice-technology startups and was designed to help cultivate a “developer ecosystem” around Alexa. Some observers, however, say that Amazon is using the fund to mine product ideas that it then produces itself. Nucleus, for example—a startup that had received backing from the Alexa Fund to create a voice-controlled video device—went on to watch Amazon release an almost identical product. While startups backed by the Alexa Fund sometimes get unique access to Amazon, some investors advise businesses “to be wary of accepting Amazon’s investment, because of the risk of Amazon copying ideas.” Following allegations that Amazon appropriates from its portfolio companies, Amazon has privately reached out to startups to mitigate those concerns, saying that a “clear ‘firewall’ exists between the Alexa Fund and Amazon’s product development teams.”\n\nAmazon also competes with Alexa-skills developers. From its rollout, Alexa has had some built-in features, such as weather and timers. It regularly introduces new features, which sometimes offer the same service as an existing skill or tool provided by third parties. Three areas in which Alexa has entered into direct competition with third-party skill providers are analytics, testing tools, and Blueprints.\n\nThe primary advantage that Alexa domains enjoy over third-party skills is that they are set as the default. If a user asks a question that both an Alexa-native and a third-party skill can answer, the default skill activated will be the one native to the Alexa engine. This default setting can be justified as way to offer users a smoother experience and to solve the technical problem of knowing where to send a request. But the effect is to create a built-in bias to steer users toward Alexa domains over third-party skills. Recent announcements suggest that Amazon is looking to enable the surfacing of skills into the first domain, which would mean Alexa would be able to sort through its abilities to activate the one that best addressed a user’s request. While, in theory, this could place a third-party skill on equal footing with an Alexa domain, the transition could also strengthen Alexa’s role as a gatekeeper, rendering skills more captive to Amazon’s discretion.\n\nAmazon closely tracks usage patterns on Alexa. It also enjoys exclusive access to the voice data that Alexa collects—data that capture the questions consumers ask voice platforms. Alexa maintains access to this data even when the information is collected through third-party skills, and Amazon can use the information to both steer its future moves in the voice-assistant market and enrich other parts of its business, such as advertising. This unique dataset will also give Amazon a huge advan­tage in continuing to develop its machine learning.\n\nNo empirical work has closely examined what guides Alexa’s entry into certain skills or devices or how the threat of direct competition with Alexa affects third-party developers.\n\nB. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, is a conglomerate comprised of subsidiaries in digital advertising, internet services, artificial intelligence, biotech, broadband, and venture capital. Google—which encompasses digital advertising, Android, Chrome, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Search, hardware, search, and YouTube —remains the entity’s profit center. In 2018, Google pulled in $36.5 billion in operating income, while the combined total of Alphabet’s other segments posted a loss.\n\nThere are several markets in which Google both serves as a major platform and competes with platform participants. These include gener­alized search, Android operating system/apps, and its online ad exchange. Although Google’s integrations in the smartphone and online adver­tising markets have also attracted antitrust attention, this section focuses on Google’s integration in search.\n\n1. Google Search/Google Verticals. — Google is a dominant internet search company, capturing around 88% of the U.S. search engine market and 95% of mobile searches. It began as a general search provider, indexing the web and developing algorithms to identify which web content may provide a relevant response to a user’s search query. Search users do not pay money for their searches; instead, Google collects and analyzes data about users to sell targeted advertisements. In 2018, ad sales constituted 85% of all Alphabet revenue.\n\nThe search engine market is comprised of “horizontal” search—a general search engine that offers results regardless of subject area—and “vertical” search, which limits query results to a specific category of content. Even as Google became the dominant website for horizontal search, a stable of independent entities launched their own specialized search engines, focused on areas like comparison shopping, local search, flight search, and financial data. Because Google is the dominant pro­vider of online search, this ecosystem of vertical sites relies on Google to be seen and discovered by users.\n\nAlthough Google introduced its first vertical product around 2002, only in 2005 did it begin strategically investing in and promoting additional vertical properties, including in local search, finance, and travel. Its foray into these areas rendered standalone vertical properties, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor, dependent on their biggest rival.\n\nGoogle took advantage of this dual role in several ways—conduct that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated as part of an antitrust probe in 2011. As revealed by an FTC staff memorandum that was partially and inadvertently disclosed to the Wall Street Journal in 2015, the investigation found that Google used its position in general search both to give its vertical properties preferential treatment and to appro­priate content from third-party competitors in vertical search.\n\nAccording to FTC staff from the Bureau of Competition (BC), Google rolled out a new interface—“Universal Search”—to privilege Google content and demote third-party content. It relied on a host of tactics. For one, Google displayed Universal Search results at or near the top of its search engine ranking page, which had the effect of demoting and resulting in “significant loss of traffic” to many vertical rivals. Google also “embellished” its vertical results with “eye-catching inter­faces” that helped steer users to Google’s vertical properties—interfaces that Google did not make available to competitor vertical websites. Commission staff concluded that Google’s self-privileging had been at least partially motivated by fear that superior vertical competitors would divert search queries—and, subsequently, advertisement dollars—from Google. The tactic worked: Self-preferential treatment “led to gains in user share for its own properties.”\n\nGoogle also appropriated information from third-party rivals in order to boost the quality of its own offerings. As of 2012, Google primarily obtained its vertical content through “scraping” other websites. Google did so through pressuring website publishers to accept a license agreement that gave Google blanket consent to use third parties’ data feeds. When rivals tried to resist Google’s efforts to copy their information, Google gave them an “all-or-nothing choice”: They could either allow their content to be appropriated by Google or they wouldn’t appear within Google web search results at all. In short, Google “could now force local websites—that needed access to Google’s web search to reach users—to accede to Google’s use of the large storehouse of reviews that Google’s rivals had built in order to develop its own user base.”\n\nBC staff concluded that the “natural and probable effect” of Google’s scraping was “to diminish the incentives of vertical websites to invest in, and to develop, new and innovative content” and recom­mended that the FTC condemn this conduct as unlawful. BC staff also concluded that Google’s self-preferential treatment “likely helped to entrench Google’s monopoly power.” Although the BC recommended bringing an antitrust action against Google on three grounds, the Commissioners entered a voluntary settlement with the company instead. The European Commission, by contrast, investigated Google on similar grounds and brought two cases establishing that the corporation had abused its dominance.\n\nGiven Google’s integration across internet search, services, and desktop and mobile advertising markets, there are numerous other ways in which it competes with businesses dependent on its services. In addition to discriminating against vertical content, Google has been found to discriminate against rival horizontal search engines and browsers and to hobble competitors in the search advertising market.\n\nC. Facebook\n\nFacebook is a dominant social network. Around two-thirds of Americans use Facebook, three-quarters of them on a daily basis. In the United States, 80% of user time spent across social networks is spent on Facebook. Through having purchased Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook now owns the top three, and four of the top eight, social media apps. Like Google, Facebook monetizes its service by selling placement to digital advertisers.\n\nThere are at least two sets of market participants that both rely on Facebook’s network and find themselves in competition with Facebook: app developers and online publishers. In both markets, Facebook has used its dominant position to appropriate from rivals.\n\n1. Facebook APIs/Facebook Apps. — Facebook’s network of over two billion users gives app developers an opportunity to reach a large audience. Facebook, meanwhile, has an incentive to cultivate a rich ecosystem of apps built around Facebook’s network. To incentivize developers to invest in building this ecosystem, Facebook offers devel­opers access to its application programming interfaces (APIs), which lets apps access data from Facebook’s network and grow their number of users. Facebook also delivers certain apps and features directly, placing it in competition with developers. It has both foreclosed competitors from its platform and appropriated their business information and functionality.\n\nReports describe how Facebook has denied API access to those firms that it considers direct competitors. In 2013, for example, Facebook cut off API access to Vine, the Twitter-owned feature that let users create six-second videos. Emails released by the U.K. Parliament revealed that the decision to block Vine’s access came directly from CEO Mark Zuckerberg—presumably because Twitter, which owned Vine, is a Facebook competitor, and Facebook was building out its own video offering. Facebook similarly shut off API access to MessageMe, a messaging app (and competitor to Facebook Messenger) that had soared in popularity, within a week of its release. Voxer, another communi­cations app, was also cut off shortly after Facebook introduced a competing product. Explaining its decision, Facebook cited a provision of its platform policy that prohibited developers from using Facebook APIs to promote a product that replicated “a core Facebook product.” The firms that saw their API access revoked by Facebook all ended up either exiting the market or shutting down entirely.\n\nIn addition to blocking apps that it deemed competitive threats, Facebook has also systematically copied them. Through Onavo, a mobile-analytics company that Facebook purchased in 2013, Facebook tracked rival apps, identifying which competitors were diverting attention and usage from Facebook. Reports capture how the tool has helped Facebook either imitate rivals or seek to buy them out. Using information captured by Onavo, Facebook has copied the functionality of several apps—including Meerkat, Houseparty, and Snapchat—and bought out WhatsApp and tbh. Apps whose functionality Facebook has copied—like Snapchat—went on to see declines in user growth.\n\nLike Amazon and Google, Facebook has established a systemic informational advantage (gleaned from competitors) that it can reap to thwart rivals and strengthen its own position, either through introducing replica products or buying out nascent competitors. Strikingly, one of Facebook’s more recent acquisition—the burgeoning social network tbh—had achieved limited market penetration by the time Facebook purchased it. Analysts speculate that Facebook spotted tbh’s rapid pace of growth through Onavo and then bought it out.\n\n2. Facebook’s Publishing Network/Facebook Ads. — For online publishers, Facebook is both a massive communications network on which they’ve come to depend, as well as a major competitor in selling ad placement. Facebook, meanwhile, has leveraged its dominant position as a communi­cations network to extract sensitive business information from publishers. Collecting this information from publishers has enabled Facebook to significantly enhance the value of its advertising business at publishers’ expense.\n\nFor publishers, Facebook’s network offers a highly attractive distribution channel. Given that most online publishers earn revenue from user clicks and visits, greater exposure to Facebook’s 1.52 billion daily users can be a game changer. Citing the promise of greater user visits—and thus greater revenue—Facebook in 2010 started marketing a set of social plug-ins that publishers could add to their websites. Installing the “Like” button, for example, would mean that any user that visited a publisher’s website could easily share content from the pub­lisher’s website with the user’s Facebook network, drawing more readers back to the publisher’s site.\n\nIn order to add Facebook’s plug-ins, publishers had to install Facebook’s code onto their websites. In practice, installing this code “opened a backdoor communication between users’ devices and Facebook’s servers,” enabling Facebook to leverage the social plug-ins installed on third-party websites to track the users of those websites. In other words, Like buttons dramatically expanded the reach of Facebook’s tracking: Any time a Facebook user visited a site with the social plug-in, Facebook could use the user’s Facebook login cookies to identify the user. Some publishers were wary. The value that online publishers offer advertisers is access to their specific readers; it is this audience relation­ship that ultimately allows ad-based publishers to monetize their content. If Facebook were able to surveil a publisher’s readers, it could sell access to those readers at a fraction of the publisher’s price—undercutting the publisher’s pricing power in the ad market. For Facebook, meanwhile, access to this data would enable it to more precisely target Facebook users when selling ads, increasing ad revenue.\n\nTo assuage publishers’ concerns, Facebook maintained the percep­tion that it would not use these plug-ins to monitor users for the purpose of selling advertising. Keen to harness Facebook’s expansive network to increase clicks, publishers flocked to the plug-ins. Within the first week of the rollout, over 50,000 websites installed Facebook’s social plug-ins, helping Facebook embed its code across the internet. Contrary to Facebook’s representations, researchers later exposed that Facebook was using the Like button code to track what users were reading or buying—even if a user hadn’t clicked the Like button and even if the user had logged out of Facebook. Despite facing public backlash for both its appar­ent deception and its pervasive surveillance, Facebook did not change course—perhaps because it no longer faced serious competition in the social network market. In 2014, it officially codified its policy of using Facebook code embedded across third-party websites to track users. The new policy admitted that Facebook would now use this surveillance data to boost Facebook’s advertising business.\n\nIt is reasonable to consider this policy change a bait and switch. Facebook induced websites to install Facebook plug-ins by representing that the company would not use this installed code to channel user data to its advertising business. Thirty percent of the top million most-visited websites—including major news publishers—added Facebook’s plug-ins, becoming dependent on Facebook’s network for greater distribution. Facebook’s decision to switch course has meant that online publishers—and any third-party website that both sells ads and uses Facebook plug-ins—are now feeding valuable business data to a major competitor at their own expense.\n\nUnlike the case of Amazon or Google, Facebook’s appropriation of publishers’ business information is not a feature of Facebook being vertically integrated. Instead, it derives from the fact that Facebook is both a major communications network and a major advertiser, and the price it charges publishers for using its platform as a distribution network is the right to surveil publishers’ users—information that it uses to enrich its advertising business. In other words, collecting publishers’ business information is not a functional necessity of allowing publishers to use Facebook; it is instead the condition Facebook has set.\n\nThere are aspects of Facebook’s business in which it is integrated, such as in content. Through Facebook Instant Articles, for example, Facebook has vertically integrated into publishing media content on its own platform. Reports suggest that Facebook has used its integrated structure to preference its own offerings.\n\nD. Apple\n\nApple is a major provider of consumer electronics and digital services, spanning smartphone and smartwatch devices, desktop and laptop computers, digital assistants, a music store, and set-top boxes. The first publicly traded corporation in history to reach $1 trillion valuation, Apple is a major provider of mobile devices and operating systems in the United States.\n\nAcross its products, Apple has long championed a vertically inte­grated model that combines hardware, software, services, and retail. Unlike the Android operating system—which users operate on non-Alphabet devices—Apple iOS functions only on Apple devices. Like Android, Apple both operates an app marketplace, offering third-party app developers the opportunity to reach Apple customers, and directly markets its own apps in its app marketplace. Since it opened in 2008, the App Store has generated more than $120 billion in total sales for app developers.\n\n1. Apple iOS/App Store/Apple Apps. — App developers claim that Apple uses its integrated model to privilege its own apps by setting unfavorable terms for third parties. A recent complaint filed by Spotify in the European Union summarizes these allegations. First, Apple charges Spotify and certain other apps a 30% fee on in-app purchases—a fee that, Spotify points out, Apple enforces selectively. Apple’s own apps do not pay the fee, and neither do many apps, like Uber, that are not in direct competition with a comparable Apple service. Second, Apple prevents Spotify from communicating directly with Apple-based users or marketing certain services to them—potentially inhibiting Spotify’s sales. And third, Spotify alleges that Apple “routinely reject[ed]” Spotify’s app enhancements and bug fixes—degrading the product quality it could market through Apple, as Apple ramped up its compet­itor service, Apple Music.\n\nThis is not the first time that developers have alleged discrimination by Apple. Around 2008, Apple explicitly rejected apps on the basis that they “duplicate[d] the functionality” of built-in iPhone apps. More recently, Apple was reported to have removed a digital wellness app shortly after releasing its own rival product (Screen Time) and to have rejected a social location planning app that competes with its own “Find My Friends” app.\n\nFaced with slowdown of iPhone sales, Apple is expanding its service offerings, introducing new services in TV, news, payments, and video games. It has also “intensified monitoring of apps that benefit and threaten Apple,” in part by creating a “release radar” through which Apple tracks apps that pose competitive threats to Apple’s own services. It is unclear whether Apple’s monitoring efforts are drawing on data on rivals collected through its platform.\n\nE. Effects of Discrimination and Appropriation on Investment and Innovation\n\nThere are several reasons why permitting dominant digital platforms to discriminate against and appropriate sensitive business information from producers that depend on them to reach market might be harmful. Drawing on a Progressive Era framework, one could argue that allowing a firm that controls an essential service or form of infrastructure to exploit that control in ways that enrich the firm and harm third-party dependents amounts to a problematic exercise of private coercion. Seen through this lens, this conduct represents the accumulation of “arbitrary authority unchecked by the ordinary mechanisms of political accountability,” amounting to a “political problem of domination.”\n\nAs Part II of this Article traces, in recent decades this expansive framework for understanding and regulating private power has been abandoned in favor of a paradigm that focuses primarily on welfare costs. Yet, as this section outlines, platform discrimination and appropriation also risk undermining innovation, raising dynamic efficiency concerns. Therefore, even under a framework primarily focused on efficiency harms, discrimination and appropriation by dominant platforms merits serious concern.\n\n1. Are Dominant Digital Platforms Stifling Innovation? — One risk associated with foreclosure and value appropriation by dominant digital platforms is that this conduct could deter entry and chill innovation. If independent developers or producers rely on a dominant platform to reach customers and also face the constant risk that the platform will foreclose access, appropriate their business value, or both, producers may be less likely to secure funding and develop their product in the first place. In Microsoft, the district court found that Microsoft’s exclusionary conduct not only had hobbled innovation in middleware and applications software but had discouraged competition throughout the computer industry as a whole. The long-term effect of its conduct was to “deter[ ] investment in technologies and businesses that exhibit[ed] the potential to threaten Microsoft.”\n\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that both actual entry and the threat of entry by digital platforms into platform-adjacent markets is dampening investment in complementary segments, now known as a “kill-zone.” For example, a survey of more than two dozen Silicon Valley investors revealed that Facebook’s willingness to appropriate information from and mimic the functionality of apps has created “a strong disincentive for investors” to fund services that Facebook might copy. One founder observed, “People are not getting funded because Amazon might one day compete with them.” “We don’t touch anything that comes too close to Facebook, Google or Amazon,” said a managing partner at New Enterprise Associates. Another venture capital investor noted that the impact of dominant digital platforms on “what can be funded, and what can succeed, is massive.” This concern raised by venture capitalists makes sense: A potential innovator (or a potential funder of a potential innovator) decides whether to invest based on the anticipated risk and reward of realizing the innovation. Anticipating platform discrimination or appropriation will lower expected rewards, depressing the incentive to invest. Even the uncertainty of discrimination can dissuade entry by heightening risk.\n\nData on investment trends do not offer a decisive answer but generally seem consistent with the story told by surveyed investors. Venture capital funding as a whole appears to be booming: In 2018, the total annual venture capital invested surpassed $100 billion for the first time since the dot-com period. The number of angel and seed investments, meanwhile, has been declining since 2015, signaling that it has become harder for startups to secure an initial round of financing. Indeed, it is late-stage deals with mature companies that account for an “outsized proportion” of total capital today, while startups see fewer first financings, even as the deal value for startups has increased. In other words, venture capital markets seem to be following a winner-take-most model: Fewer firms receive funding, but those that do are raising more capital. These trends come against a backdrop of falling entre­preneurship: Startup formation is at a thirty-year low, contributing to a loss of business dynamism.\n\nThese overall numbers, however, offer limited insight into whether—and in what way—dominant platforms are affecting venture capital funding. Even sector-specific figures compiled by the industry database are based on industry classifications that are too generalized for a precise analysis of this question. Establishing high-level causality between platform conduct and investment decisions would prove extremely chal­lenging; there are a significant number of variables at play, and demon­strating but-for causality is tough. Achieving clarity on this question would require granular case-by-case analysis.\n\nThe theoretical literature examining how third-party producers and providers (also called “complementors”) manage or respond to head-to-head competition with platforms is vast. Empirical work, by contrast, is more limited.\n\nOne study found that Amazon is more likely to enter product spaces that have higher sales, better reviews, and that do not require significant effort by sellers to grow. The effect of Amazon’s entry, meanwhile, is to reduce shipping costs for consumers and increase sales—but its self-preferential treatment can also foreclose consumers’ access to competing products. Overall, Amazon’s entry has not yet affected customer perceptions of product quality, but it does “discourage[ ] third-party sellers from continuing to offer the products.” The authors of that study note that existing merchants discouraged by Amazon’s entry “may bring fewer innovative products to the platform.”\n\nA study assessing how app developers reacted to perceived or actual entry by Google, meanwhile, found that developers are “discouraged from innovating in the affected market.” Indeed, even the threat of direct competition by Google spurs developers to “significantly reduce[ ]” updates on affected apps—and to reallocate their efforts to markets unaf­fected by Google’s entry. Notably, the average small firm also responds by pivoting to a focus on short-term profits, leading to higher prices.\n\nEmpirical studies assessing how actual or potential entry by a dominant platform affects complementors are still limited. Investors acknowledge unequivocally that the dominance of digital platforms deters investment in certain markets, and data suggest that firms looking to compete with a core functionality of Google, Facebook, or Amazon have seen funding dry up. The few available case studies confirm that the risk of appropriation chills or at least diverts certain forms of invest­ment and innovation. More empirical work on this issue would help deepen public understanding of how funders assess the risk of platform foreclosure and appropriation, and what impact platform expansion into adjacent markets may have on innovation.\n\nAt first glance, the idea that dominant digital platforms may be using their integrated structure to undermine dynamic efficiency appears in tension with standard economic theory. The Appendix to this Article reviews leading theories on when integrated firms can be expected to discriminate against or exclude rivals in adjacent markets, identifies the set of conditions under which this is likely to happen, and explains why digital platform markets fit these conditions.\n\n2. Innovation and Platform Design Principles. — While initial evidence suggests that platform discrimination and appropriation is stifling innovation, definitively determining the net effects on innovation—which involves significant uncertainty, lengthy time horizons, and interde­pendencies —is complex. Indeed, the debate over what type of market structure and forms of business organization best promote innovation is longstanding and extensive. While contributing to this debate is beyond the scope of this Article, this section will briefly offer that (1) promoting innovation in platform-adjacent markets should be a key goal of platform policy, and (2) innovation architecture literature offers useful principles for thinking through how to create digital platform ecosystems conducive to innovation.\n\nThere is broad consensus that, over the long run, promoting dynamic efficiency is more important to well-being than static effi­ciency. For this reason, scholars have devoted a wealth of research to identifying how to cultivate and promote instrumentalities of inno­vation. Commonly recognized innovation catalysts include patents, standard-setting processes, and platforms.\n\nBecause platforms have the potential to lower the cost of entry for firms looking to market new products or services, platforms have the potential to “increase the rate at which product innovation can happen.” The Windows platform had the potential to ease entry for Netscape, which could access millions of consumers without having to create its own operating system—just as Android has the potential to ease entry for thousands of app developers. Given the critical role that platforms can play in spurring innovation, protecting the integrity of platforms as innovation catalysts should be a key goal of competition policy in digital markets. This would include preventing platforms from engaging in forms of discrimination, exclusion, appropriation, and self-privileging, conduct that can lead to “the corruption of the entire system of platform-based innovation.”\n\nSeparate from policing conduct that risks undermining innovation, policy can also draw from innovation architecture principles. This approach was central to designing the internet, whose original architecture was based on the “end-to-end” principle. In general, end-to-end stipulates that “the ‘intelligence’ in a network should be located at the top of a layered system—at its ‘ends,’ where users put information and applications onto the network[,]” while the “communications protocols themselves (the ‘pipes’ through which information flows) should be as simple and as general as possible.” Professors Mark Lemley and Lawrence Lessig observe that designing the Internet around end-to-end has had social significance, most notably in “the competition in innovation the Internet enables.” As they explain, because “there is no single strategic actor who can tilt the competitive environment (the network) in favor of itself, or no hierarchical entity that can favor some applications over others, an e2e network creates a maximally competitive environment for innovation.”\n\nThe end-to-end principle was embedded partly through the Internet Protocol, an open-standard networking protocol that empowered “developers at the network’s edge to design and deploy new services and applications without having to rely on network operators to build any new functionality into the physical core of the network.” This principle, in turn, traces to the concept of common carriage, which required common carriers to grant equal treatment to equally situated parties. The key attributes of common carriage are “nondiscriminatory public access and indifference to the nature of the goods carried.”\n\nDigital platforms exist in a different “layer” from the physical network providers governed by end-to-end. As scholars have noted, regulations at the “application” layer—which includes digital platforms—have encouraged “content awareness,” in part due to the role some of these services play in intermediating speech and expression. Still, these architecture design principles offer a fruitful way of thinking through what set of constraints should apply to dominant digital platforms in order to best promote innovation.\n\nII. Legal Scrutiny of Vertical Integration by Dominant Networks\n\nConfronting the risks of integration by dominant intermediaries is not new. Up until around the 1970s, a basic regulatory principle held that dominant gatekeepers should not be permitted to compete with third parties for access to the gatekeeper’s facilities. Limits on business entry for network monopolies, gatekeeper intermediaries, and other businesses deemed to have outsized control over key services were a mainstay of economic regulation.\n\nThis Part traces the evolution in both the institutional mechanisms and the substantive considerations by which government actors have imposed limits on business entry. It closes by sketching out how current antitrust law neglects to address harms from vertical integration that should trigger scrutiny even under the current framework.\n\nNotably, state and federal governments have issued line-of-business restrictions through a variety of legal tools: corporate charters, regulatory regimes, and antitrust law. In some cases, these limits prohibited firms from expanding into any distinct market; in others, they prohibited firms from entering only adjacent markets—namely, those markets that involve a successive stage of production or distribution. A categorical prohibition would, for example, ban a movie distributor from entering any nondis­tributor market, whereas a ban on integration would prohibit it from entering only the movie-production market or the movie-theater market. Since this Article examines the dual role that digital platforms play—as both marketplace operators and merchants in the marketplace—this Part primarily focuses on limits on entry into adjacent markets.\n\nA. Evolving Approaches to Restricting Business Lines\n\nEarly American corporations had their activities restricted by their charters. States issued corporate charters as a special grant of limited liability in exchange for the performance of specific duties and functions. Corporate charters generally limited the size, scope, and duration of operations and steered business activity toward serving community purposes. This effort to use charters to impose “some degree of social control” on firms lasted into the late nineteenth century, by which point most state legislatures had passed general incorporation laws—with the expectation that companies would now be regulated by competition. With this shift from special to general incorporation, the corporation largely ceased being viewed as an instrument of state policy and instead became seen as a “private institution” that had authority “to carry on virtually any kind of business.”\n\nFollowing this shift, restricting the lines of business in which a firm could engage mostly fell to regulatory regimes that Congress introduced to govern specific sectors. Typically overseen by an administrative agency, these regulatory regimes spanned industries including railroads, bank­ing, airlines, trucks, telecommunications, electricity, and natural gas—sectors considered both critical to the economy and, in some cases, susceptible to monopolistic market structures. In some instances, the statute creating the regulatory regime specifically prohibited regulated firms from entering certain markets. In other cases, these limits on entry (and exit) were instituted by the administrative agency.\n\nWhile each regime had its own specific policy goals and regulatory tools, government oversight of these “regulated industries” shared a general aim of ensuring reliability and nondiscrimination. Agencies applied restrictions on market entry and exit to promote both of these goals. In some cases, regulated firms were permitted to enter multiple markets so that they could cross-subsidize: Long-distance service, for example, could subsidize local service, enabling the provision of univer­sal service. In other instances, regulated firms were prohibited from entering certain lines of business in order to further the goal of nondiscrimination. While common carriage regimes would require a firm to offer equal service on equal terms, prohibiting a firm from competing with its business customers would eliminate one source of the incentive to discriminate. In this way, common carriage and structural separations often functioned as complements in the service of nondis­crimination. In addition to limiting entry and exit, standard agency interventions included regulating rates, requiring standard packages of services at uniform prices, and mandating universal service.\n\nNo precise set of criteria determined the sectors that Congress decided to oversee through regulatory regimes. Several of the regulated industries exhibited natural monopoly characteristics—including high fixed costs and low marginal costs—but these economic characteristics offer only a partial explanation. Direct government oversight tended to hinge more on the degree to which an industry was, as the Supreme Court termed it, “affected with a public interest.” In some cases, the “public-ness” of an industry correlated to the degree to which it was a public necessity, as was the case, for example, with electricity. Nondiscriminatory access requirements, however, were generally tied to physical distribution networks, which the government has a long history of overseeing. All regulated industries were related in some way to transportation and communication networks, even as “different eco­nomic and social facts seem to carry different weight” depending on the context.\n\nAs Professors Joseph Kearney and Thomas Merrill have described, starting in the 1970s this legal regime gave way to a different regulatory paradigm. Instead of promoting equal treatment and reliable service, the new framework sought to encourage competition both among providers and within their forms of service, the idea being that maximizing consumer choice would minimize the need for regulatory involvement. The specific way lawmakers applied this new framework varied by industry. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, for example, ended the public utility approach to regulating airlines, while the Telecommunications Act of 1996 loosened some restrictions and intro­duced a new set of requirements oriented around the goal of promoting competition. Across industries, tariffed services, integrated service packages, and regulatory control were abandoned in favor of individually negotiated contracts, unbundled services, and an abridged role for administrative agencies.\n\nThe transition away from the traditional regulatory paradigm took place against a background assumption that antitrust laws would robustly police formerly regulated dominant firms. Both Alfred Kahn and then-Professor Stephen Breyer, strong advocates of the shift in regulatory paradigm, described the new regime as a distinct form of regulation. And while most tools of the first regulatory paradigm (rate-setting, for example, or mandated universal service) were largely eliminated in favor of the new competition-based paradigm, structural restrictions on busi­ness have remained a feature of both. This is because even as the new model was less directly interventionist, it still relied on the antitrust laws to police markets—and structural limits have been a key remedy in antitrust.\n\nThe antitrust laws broadly prohibit anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive mergers. Structural prohibitions can apply in both contexts. When a company is found to be monopolizing or attempting to monopolize a market in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, breakup of the company is an available remedy. Separately, when a court determines that the effect of a particular merger or acquisition “may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly” in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, it can enjoin the merger. Compared to separations implemented through regulations, antitrust separations are less likely to categorically deny market entry, although consent decrees that govern a significant market segment may achieve that effect. In either case, the separation intervenes at the level of business structure rather than conduct.\n\nUnknown at the time of the shift away from regulated industries was how drastically antitrust law, too, would be transformed. Through the 1960s, antitrust courts and enforcers assessed business expansion into adjacent markets through “economic structuralism,” an approach that analyzed competition primarily through examining the structure of markets. Although the government was light on bringing antitrust actions in vertical merger cases up until the 1930s, scrutiny of vertical expansion picked up after the Great Depression, which wiped out thousands of small unintegrated businesses and catalyzed a political movement against integrated chain stores.\n\nSkeptics of vertical integration offered two primary theories of harm: leverage and foreclosure. The concern with leverage was that a dominant firm would use its market power in one line of business to establish an outsized advantage in an adjacent market. The risk posed by foreclosure meanwhile was that a vertically integrated firm would compel its subsidiary to deal exclusively with the parent, depriving unintegrated rivals of access to the firm’s good or service. At a minimum, critics worried that vertical integration increased barriers to entry by neces­sitating potential entrants to compete in both lines of business.\n\nIn 1950, Congress amended Section 7 of the Clayton Act to make it expressly applicable to vertical acquisitions. Through the 1970s, the Justice Department successfully challenged vertical deals, resulting in divestitures. Ruling that a merger between a major producer and leading retailer of shoes would undermine competition, the Supreme Court explained that\n\n[t]he primary vice of a vertical merger or other arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that, by foreclosing the compet­itors of either party from a segment of the market otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a ‘clog on compe­tition,’ which deprive(s) rivals of a fair opportunity to compete.\n\nAnd in holding that the second largest auto manufacturer’s acquisition of a leading auto parts dealer would foreclose market access for inde­pendent dealers, the Court concluded that “only divestiture would correct the condition caused by the unlawful acquisition.” Though enforcers’ analysis of vertical control—through ownership or contract—was case-specific, it was integration by dominant firms that was most commonly held to be anticompetitive, given that exclusionary conduct by dominant companies could, in practice, entirely close off markets to unintegrated rivals. In United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., the Court held that internal transfers within a vertically integrated firm could be anticompetitive if they denied competitors market access. And in the 1968 Merger Guidelines, the Justice Department stated that integra­tion achieved through a large vertical merger “will usually raise entry barriers or disadvantage competitors to an extent not accounted for by, and wholly disproportionate to, such economies as may result from the merger.”\n\nThis approach to vertical integration underwent a sea change during the 1980s. Though some economists had for decades maintained a benign view of vertical integration, it was work by Robert Bork, Ward Bowman, and Richard Posner, among others, that helped drive an overhaul in policy. Bork’s scholarship challenged both the leverage and foreclosure theories of harm as logical fallacies, while Bowman argued that the jurisprudence around tying agreements was deeply flawed.\n\nThese scholars, associated with the Chicago School, argued that, contrary to prevailing economic theory and antitrust policy, vertical integration was almost always procompetitive. This view was premised primarily on three arguments. First, they maintained, firms could not extract additional profits from extending a dominant position into a distinct market, because—assuming that a firm was already selling a combination of goods at its profit-maximizing price—increasing the price of one would result in a corresponding offset in the other. Second, the Chicago School held that an integrated firm would be able to foreclose rivals only to the degree that the firm had generated cost savings, outdoing less efficient competitors—an outcome that antitrust should encourage. Insofar as a vertically integrated entity did cut off both upstream sellers and downstream customers, those firms now had an opportunity to transact with one another. And third, they argued, vertical mergers would invariably generate significant efficiencies. Because the upstream division would transfer its input to the downstream entity at marginal cost rather than at a sales price, vertical mergers eliminated double marginalization, leading the downstream partner to lower prices for consumers.\n\nWith the election of President Reagan, these theories were stamped into policy through both the antitrust agencies and federal judiciary. For the next decade, antitrust officials did not challenge a single vertical merger and relaxed scrutiny of vertical restraints more generally. The transformation in how antitrust authorities approached vertical struc­tures and conduct was part of a broader revolution in antitrust law, which embraced “consumer welfare” as the lodestar of antitrust and adopted price theory as the proper methodology for analyzing competition. As courts incorporated this new learning into their analysis, they shifted from rules to standards, narrowing the range of dominant firm conduct treated as anticompetitive. Although the Chicago School’s influence drove these changes at the level of policy, the Harvard School—whose prominent members included Phil Areeda and Stephen Breyer—also played a critical role in setting the intellectual foundation for narrowing the zone of liability for dominant firms.\n\nSince the Chicago School’s “resounding victory,” scholars have critiqued some of its excesses and moderated its theories, delivering the “Post-Chicago School.” Today’s approach to antitrust law largely follows in this Post-Chicago tradition, where Chicago’s influence has been tempered even as it remains indelible. The following section reviews the current antitrust approach to vertical integration and why it risks neglecting potentially anticompetitive vertical conduct by dominant platforms.\n\nB. Contemporary Antitrust’s Treatment of Vertical Integration\n\nMost forms of vertical integration today are “viewed as economically beneficial and competitively benign.” Antitrust scrutiny of vertical integration has two legal hooks: (1) Section 7 of the Clayton Act, which states that mergers that may “substantially lessen competition” are unlawful, and (2) Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits monopo­lization or attempted monopolization. An unlawful vertical merger could be challenged under Section 7, and vertical conduct that consti­tutes monopolization or attempted monopolization could be targeted under Section 2. Given the dearth of cases challenging vertical mergers, the law governing vertical mergers has remained “undeveloped.”\n\nTwo factors that inform whether a vertical merger or vertical conduct is held to be anticompetitive are the competitiveness of a market and the presence of entry barriers. Economic analysis holds that foreclosure is a viable antitrust strategy in monopolistic and oligopolistic markets protected by entry barriers. Similarly, establishing monopo­lization generally requires showing both the existence of monopoly power and the existence of entry barriers.\n\nIn digital platform markets, two potential entry barriers worth assessing are network effects and unequal access to data. In markets characterized by network effects, the value of the relevant good or service increases with greater use of that good or service. Whereas supply-side economies of scale reflect declining average and marginal costs of production, network effects are a demand-side feature. Depending on the type and strength of the network effects, these externalities can serve as barrier to entry—a finding that formed the basis of the Microsoft decision. Scholarship analyzing the conditions under which unequal access to data serves as an entry barriers is still developing, but initial work suggests that the self-reinforcing advantages of data may give incumbents a sufficiently significant lead that potential competitors struggle to enter.\n\nGiven the turn away from structuralism, contemporary antitrust law generally requires that the allegedly anticompetitive merger or conduct have an anticompetitive effect, defined as harm to consumer welfare. This welfare-based framework is understood to include not just static concerns about price and output but also dynamic concerns about innovation.\n\nNotably, discrimination and appropriation by dominant tech platforms seem to generate antitrust harms cognizable even within this welfare-based framework. Insofar as platform conduct reduces investment and entrepreneurial activity by independent parties, any subse­quent loss in innovation would—in a dynamic efficiency frame­work—constitute a harm to competition. These dynamics are an echo of Microsoft, insofar as it was Microsoft’s conduct against Netscape that prompted the Justice Department to bring its antitrust suit alleging that Microsoft’s activity “adversely affect[ed] innovation,” by “impairing the incentive[s]” of rivals to “undertake research and development” and “impairing the ability” of “competitors to obtain financing.”\n\nSome former state enforcers and lawyers have argued that dominant platforms are engaging in exclusionary conduct to acquire and maintain monopoly power in ways reminiscent of Microsoft—but that enforcers have yet to rectify these marketplace harms, due to unfavorable case law in the United States and inadequate remedies by the European Commission.\n\nPlatform discrimination and appropriation also risk going unad­dressed by contemporary antitrust. This is because of both specific doctrinal changes that have significantly narrowed the range of instances in which single-firm conduct rises to an antitrust offense as well as general blind spots of a consumer welfare approach primarily focused on price and output effects. To appreciate the likely neglect of antitrust to these competition harms, it’s worth briefly reviewing the doctrinal obstacles to bringing an antitrust case against a dominant tech platform for discrimination or appropriation.\n\n1. Denial of Access and the Essential Facilities Doctrine. — Prior to 2004, a dominant tech platform that blocked independent parties in favor of its own goods or services might have been liable under the “essential facilities” doctrine. Under essential facilities, dominant firms that deny other businesses nondiscriminatory access to their unique facilities may incur antitrust liability.\n\nThis doctrine traces to the early years of the federal antitrust law, when the Supreme Court interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act to impose obligations of equal and nondiscriminatory access. In subse­quent decades, the Court interpreted the Sherman Act to require that the only railroad bridge across the Mississippi river grant open and equal access to all rivals; that the Associated Press grant nondiscriminatory membership to publishers that competed with its existing members; and that the sole power company in a region must transmit power gener­ated by rival firms to customers that sought to buy cheaper power from those rivals.\n\nIn 1983, the Seventh Circuit formalized essential facilities into a doctrinal test, requiring plaintiffs to establish four elements: (1) the monopolist controls access to an essential facility; (2) the facility cannot be practically or reasonably duplicated by a competitor; (3) the monop­olist denies access to a competitor; and (4) it is feasible for the monop­olist to provide access. In this way, essential facilities could be seen as “a means of protecting or injecting competition into a market susceptible to monopolization due to structural factors.”\n\nInsofar as independent producers or developers could prove these elements, the dominant platform would have been liable. The essential facilities doctrine, however, has died a “death by a thousand cuts,” having drawn academic criticism since the 1980s. As of 2004, the essential facilities doctrine lives in “near extinction.” That year, in Trinko, the Court ruled on whether a customer of a local phone monopolist could bring an antitrust class action challenging discrim­ination by a monopolist against a rival. Although the Court’s holding did not involve essential facilities, in dicta the Court all but rejected the viability of the doctrine. While courts continue to review essential facilities claims, in the wake of Trinko no plaintiff has successfully litigated one to judgment.\n\n2. Discriminatory Refusal to Deal. — A dominant tech platform that discriminates against those independent parties that provide competing goods or services could, in theory, be liable for discriminatory refusal to deal in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. The key precedent is Aspen Skiing, in which the defendant’s refusal to sell lift tickets to a rival resort was held to constitute unlawful monopolization. What distin­guishes a legitimate refusal to deal from an illegitimate one is whether the dominant firm’s actions discriminate between rivals and non-rivals. For example, if Android demoted from the Google Play Store apps that competed with Google-owned apps but did not demote non-rivals, the demoted competitors would likely be able to allege a discriminatory refusal to deal claim against Android.\n\nHere, too, the Supreme Court has thrown into doubt the practical viability of unilateral refusal to deal claims. In Trinko, the Court denied the existence of any duty to deal and characterized Aspen Skiing as “at or near the outer boundary of § 2 liability.” Stopping short of foreclosing refusal to deal claims entirely, the Court distinguished Trinko from Aspen Skiing on the grounds that (1) Aspen involved a defendant that had stopped participating in an existing venture, and (2) the existence of a regulatory structure that already governed the defendant’s duty to deal couldn’t be reconciled with a separate antitrust duty to deal.\n\nThe blow of Trinko is softened slightly in the context of the dominant tech platforms, which presently are not governed by a separate regulatory regime. But the Court also codified a heightened require­ment, establishing that discriminatory refusals to deal will only be actionable if the conduct is likely to create a new monopoly or entrench an existing one. In other words, the dominant platform must have a “dangerous probability of success” in monopolizing the adjacent market. Discrimination by Android against independent apps, for example, would constitute a viable claim only if that discrimination were enabling Google to capture a monopolistic share of the relevant app market. Although some commentators have read this requirement as “squeeze[ing] much of the remaining vitality out of Section 2 claims challenging unilateral refusals to deal,” it is possible that platform conduct in certain adjacent markets could be shown to meet even this heightened standard.\n\n3. Information Appropriation. — Antitrust enforcers recognize that appropriation of sensitive competitor information can undermine competition. When reviewing vertical mergers, the antitrust agencies assess whether the deal would enable the merging firm to use rivals’ information in anticompetitive ways. Enforcers recognize that posi­tioning a dominant firm to collect and analyze a rival-customer’s business information could “reduce the incentives of the rivals even to attempt . . . procompetitive moves,” resulting in longer-term harm.\n\nOutside of the merger context, appropriation of sensitive business information by a rival is more difficult to cognize as an antitrust harm. Exclusionary conduct cases are generally governed by the rule of reason. The standard follows a burden-shifting approach: In the first stage, the plaintiff must show a significant anticompetitive effect. If the plaintiff succeeds, then the defendant must demonstrate a legitimate procompetitive justification. If the defendant succeeds in doing so, then the plaintiff can show that the restraint is not reasonably necessary or that the objectives could be achieved by less restrictive alternatives. An empirical study of rule of reason cases found that courts dispose of 97% of cases at the first stage on the ground that there is no anticompetitive effect; courts balance the pro- and anticompetitive effects in only 2% of cases.\n\nAn exclusionary conduct case based on information appropriation is especially unlikely to succeed under the current antitrust framework because establishing anticompetitive effects purely on innovation-based harms is extremely challenging under the consumer welfare standard. In part this is because static harms are easier to measure than innovation harms, a fact that tends to bias antitrust analysis towards a focus on price and output effects. In part this is also because dynamic harms can involve significantly greater indeterminacy, such that conduct that yields short-term price reductions might also lead to long-term losses in innovation.\n\nIt is true that the Justice Department prevailed in United States v. Microsoft by focusing on innovation-based harms. Since Microsoft, however, the antitrust agencies have not brought a single case involving a pure-innovation theory of harm in a monopolization case. In the twenty years since, courts have raised evidentiary standards for plaintiffs, demanding “empirical proof of antitrust impact or injury for consumers that can be directly tied to the conduct.” Given both doctrinal hurdles imposed by courts since Microsoft as well as the general challenges of concretizing innovation-based harms, a growing set of scholars is conclud­ing that “antitrust generally, and the antitrust agencies specifically, are currently ill-equipped to effectively pursue a platform owner that commands sufficient market power to stifle innovation.”\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court recently made it even more difficult for plaintiffs to successfully allege even price-based anticompetitive effects in certain cases. In Ohio v. American Express Co. last term, the Court introduced a special rule for analyzing the conduct of companies operating in “two-sided transaction platforms,” requiring that plaintiffs alleging anticompetitive harm on one side of the market must—as part of establishing a prima facie case—also show that the purported harm was not offset by benefits on the other side. A drastic departure from traditional forms of antitrust analysis, this “netting” requirement redefines what constitutes anticompetitive conduct in the context of platforms that facilitate a “simultaneous transaction,” effectively creating an insurmountable hurdle for plaintiffs. While several commentators — including the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust — have said they interpret the holding as applying only to a small number of tech platform markets, it is too early to tell whether antitrust defendants will successfully expand its reach to cover exclusionary conduct by non-simultaneous transaction platforms.\n\n4. The Shift Away from Structural Remedies. — A final trend in antitrust worth identifying is the shift away from structural remedies in vertical merger cases. The 2004 merger guidelines strongly disfavored behavioral remedies. The 2011 guidelines, by contrast, established a preference for a combination of structural and conduct remedies. In practice, the Obama Administration proved reluctant to issue strong structural remedies in vertical cases; it approved two major vertical deals—both described by critics as raising significant anticompetitive concerns—by issuing primarily conduct remedies.\n\nThese conduct remedies—in the Ticketmaster–Live Nation and Comcast–NBC mergers—have proved difficult to oversee and enforce. Concerns that Live Nation has failed to abide by the remedies in any meaningful sense have prompted the Justice Department to open a Section 2 investigation, examining whether Live Nation is indeed using its control over concert facilities to pressure customers to also use its ticketing service and retaliating against those who decline its ticket service but still seek access to the concert facility. Comcast, too, has violated the conduct remedies that enforcers imposed when permitting the merger.\n\nThese incidents raise broader questions about the relative efficacy and administrative costs of imposing conduct remedies over structural ones. As Professor Spencer Weber Waller has noted, the retreat from structural remedies has led the antitrust agencies to adopt highly complex remedies that typically “exceed the resources and strengths” of the Justice Department and FTC. Another way to understand the trend is that the agencies have shifted away from structural remedies in favor of remedies that do more regulatory work —even as the agencies are institutionally structured to serve as enforcers rather than regulators.\n\nStark information asymmetries between enforcers and platforms suggest that enforcing conduct remedies in digital markets will prove even more challenging. Given that rebalancing away from an exclusive reliance on conduct remedies in favor of structural remedies could mitigate these administrability costs and challenges, the case for structural separations in digital markets is worth assessing.\n\n5. Adjusting Competition to Regulation? — These trends can be summarized as follows: In the wake of deregulation of network industries and dominant intermediaries, lawmakers expected antitrust to police dominant intermediaries. But in the decades since, courts and enforcers have drastically contracted the basis for antitrust liability in cases involving dominant firms. The result is a highly enfeebled and impov­erished set of tools for confronting dominant intermediaries in network industries.\n\nMeanwhile, even innovation harms seem to go unaddressed under the consumer welfare framework, although innovation is central to dynamic efficiency and long-term welfare. In instances when vertical mergers are scrutinized, moreover, growing reliance on conduct remedies has stretched the antitrust agencies beyond their institutional capacities, enabling exclusionary conduct. Notably, the Court has suggested in recent antitrust cases that remedies for injuries that result from dominant firm conduct may be better pursued through a regula­tory paradigm rather than through antitrust law—further suggesting that judicial aversion to antitrust will make addressing platform integration through current law extremely challenging.\n\nIn light of these trends, the question of whether structural separations should be recovered as a tool of competition policy is salient because digital platform markets seem to favor monopolistic market structures. Growing empirical research shows that dominant tech platforms enjoy uniquely durable market power. Network effects and the self-reinforcing advantages can lead to winner-take-all dynamics, where markets tip early and potential entrants face significant barriers. Expectations that the tech sector would be sufficiently fast-moving and rapidly innovating so as to justify a relatively hands-off approach to antitrust were too rosy.\n\nThe question of how to adjust expectations of competition to the reality of its absence has an analogue. As formerly monopolistic sectors were opened up to competition, a wave of scholarship in the 1990s and 2000s explored how the legal regime governing these markets should adjust accordingly. Specifically, these scholars asked: When should an increasingly competitive market lead us to abandon regulations whose justifications depend on monopoly market structure?\n\nWhat we lack is an understanding of the inverse question: When do we decide that what was perceived as a competitive market in fact is monopolistic or oligopolistic, warranting the application of rules tradi­tionally applied to dominant firms? And which traditional tools should apply?\n\nThese questions animate this Article, with a focus on one of these tools: structural separations. As Part III will discuss, structural separations have been a mainstay tool applied to network industries and dominant intermediaries. While much of the focus—and criticism—of the public utility regime has centered on rate regulation, vertical separations have been less closely studied. Separations differ from rate regulation and several other regulatory tools in that separations are ex ante rules whose application does not require continuous government intervention or constant monitoring. Insofar as a primary criticism of the public utility era is that many of the regulations proved too unwieldy for courts and enforcers to implement, structural separations appear far more appealing. Contrasted with other public utility tools, separations reduce regulatory burden and reflect humility about the capacity of public officials to manage business conduct.\n\nIII. Separations Regimes\n\nThis Part provides an overview of five separations regimes, as applied to railroads, bank holding companies, television networks, and telecom­munication carriers. Two of these separations were implemented through statute, two through agency regulations, and one as an antitrust remedy.\n\nTo be sure, this list is not exhaustive; lawmakers and enforcers have implemented structural prohibitions in a variety of other contexts. This section seeks to offer a representative sample across a few network industries to identify the range of concerns that arise when companies that play an infrastructure role in distribution networks integrate into lines of business that rely on those networks.\n\nA. Railroads\n\nBy 1900, a handful of railroads had captured the market for anthracite coal. Six firms owned 90% of the total anthracite resources, resulting in high, uniform prices and yielding massive profits for the railroads. Through controlling both the tracks and the coal, railroads came to engage in the same kinds of discriminatory conduct that Congress had outlawed through the Interstate Commerce Act. Independent coal companies found, for example, that the railroads refused to provide them with sufficient cars to transport their coal to market, giving the railroad-owned coal superior access to markets.\n\nSeeking to rectify this runaround, Congress included in the 1906 Hepburn Act a provision separating the function of transportation from the function of ownership over goods. While this specific prohibition was introduced last-minute in the Senate and therefore did not generate extensive debate, the concept was not new; a congressional committee in 1892 had undertaken an investigation of the railroad sector and concluded that “the public interest demanded that the business of a common carrier should be absolutely separated from any other.”\n\nKnown as the “commodities clause,” this provision forbade a railroad from carrying “any article or commodity” that it had “manufactured, mined, or produced,” or in which it “may have any interest[,] direct or indirect.” Under the original version of the bill, this rule would have applied to all “common carriers,” including pipelines for oil, natural gas, and other commodities. But business interests in the oil and gas sector managed to narrow the provision so that the final language emerging from conference covered not common carriers in general but only railroads. Several senators also successfully pushed to exclude timber and lumber from the general prohibition, arguing that a whole group of railroads that had invested in tracks for the sole purpose of transporting lumber would otherwise go bankrupt. More extensive debate and discussion might have yielded a more sweeping ban, had Congress not been “anxious to secure the speedy passage of the bill.” The Hepburn Act passed the Senate by 71-3, with fifteen senators not voting.\n\nThe backlash from the railroads against the law was almost immediate. States in the anthracite region—including New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania—had been encouraging railroads to purchase coal lands in order to develop those states’ natural resources. In some cases the states had embedded the right to own coal mines in corporate charters. Following state guidance and incentives, the railroads had invested heavily to purchase coal mines—only to see the Hepburn Act penalize them for it.\n\nShortly after the bill was enacted, the Attorney General filed suits against six railroad companies that had not divested their coal interests. One firm responded with a constitutional challenge, alleging that the act fell outside congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce and that the commodities clause would constitute an imper­missible “taking” under the Fifth Amendment. The Court rejected this view and clarified that, contrary to the government’s position, a carrier may transport goods that it had produced, so long as the carrier had clearly divested its ownership of those goods prior to commencing transport. The Court also construed the statute to permit railroads to carry goods produced by a bona fide distinct company in which the railroad was a stockholder.\n\nThree subsequent cases at the Supreme Court would further test the boundaries of the commodities clause. In 1911, the Court held that a railroad using direct stock ownership in a coal company to wield “complete power over the affairs of the coal company, just as if the coal company were a mere department of the railroad,” violated the Hepburn Act. Critically, the problem was not stock ownership per se but “the ‘commingling of the affairs . . . ,’ so as to make both corporations virtually one.” Four years later the Court confronted a coal operation that had been spun off as a separate organization yet remained beholden to its former parent railroad. The vice president of the railroad company also served as the president of the coal company, the two firms shared directors and an office building, and the railroad corporation dictated contractual terms to the coal company, effectively prohibiting it from doing business with other entities. The Court held that no single factor was decisive, but ruled that—taken together—the facts proved that “the relation between the parties was so friendly that they were not trading at arm’s length.” The key question was whether one company had been “converted into a mere agent or instrumentality of the other.” Lastly, the Court reviewed a case in which a single holding company owned both a railroad and a coal company, and the railroad company, in turn, was a majority shareholder in the mining company. Upon examining the circumstances, the Court found that the owners had sought the “abdication of all independent corporate action,” surrendering to the holding company the “entire conduct of their affairs.” Explaining that courts would “look through the forms to the realities of the relation between the companies,” the Court required that the businesses separate to establish “entire independence.” In doing so, the Court explained that it was “using the antitrust laws to close a gap” in the Hepburn Act,” which had banned railroads from owning commodities but not from entering contractual agreements. The Court recognized that railroads could achieve through exclusive contracting what the law forbade them from achieving through integration.\n\nBy the 1920s, any unity of control—through stock ownership or by means of a holding company—was recognized as a violation of the Hepburn Act. Rejecting the view that the statute outright prohibited railroads from having any ownership interest in the firms whose goods they transported, the Court adopted an approach that assessed the degree of control between the two firms. Any association of management between railway companies and commodity companies was prohibited.\n\nB. Banking\n\nA core principle at the heart of banking regulation in the United States is the separation of banking and commerce. This policy of sepa­ration traces back to the charter for the Bank of England —an example that the United States looked to when forming its own banks, and a principle that many state banking regimes also adopted. Between 1870 and 1910, the Supreme Court four times upheld rules enjoining banks from owning commercial businesses.\n\nIn 1956, the United States codified this separation principle in the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA). The Act applied to all firms controlling multibank holding companies (i.e., two or more banks). Specifically, § 4(a) prohibited banks from acquiring nonbanking companies and required banks covered by the Act to divest any nonbanking subsidiaries within two years of becoming subject to the law. The Act granted banks some latitude: They could own non­banking subsidiaries whose activities were deemed by the Federal Reserve to be “so closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.” But in practice, the Federal Reserve granted this exception extremely rarely.\n\nBecause the BHCA had applied only to multi-bank firms, it had created a loophole. By 1970, the six largest banks in the United States had formed one-bank holding companies in order to engage in commercial activities. Responding to this runaround, Congress amended the BHCA to extend its prohibitions to one-bank holding companies. Lawmakers described the revision as a way to “continue our long-standing policy of separating banking from commerce.”\n\nLawmakers and policymakers have appeared willing to also apply the separation to commercial entities. Starting in 2005, Walmart, Home Depot, Target, and several other commercial firms made moves to acquire FDIC-insured industrial loan companies (ILCs), a type of finan­cial entity. Had the FDIC approved the acquisitions, Walmart’s financial arm, for example, would have become the primary processor of payments for Walmart. Critics of the deals worried that Walmart would be able to pressure Walmart Bank to ignore credit problems and that Target and Home Depot would make loans to finance exclusive purchases of their own goods. In the face of opposition from business groups, labor unions, community activists, public interest groups, and members of Congress, Walmart withdrew its application. Applications by the other firms were stalled by FDIC’s moratorium.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve moved to erode the legal wall between banking and commerce in the late 1990s and early 2000s, renewed publicity around 2013 thrust the issue back into the center of policy debate, prompting congressional hearings and a Senate investi­gation. Scholarship and reporting newly identified the original hazards of permitting our biggest banks to serve as merchants of essential raw materials. In 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule to rein in banks’ nonbanking activities and largely return to the earlier regime. Although "
