        "text": "A Conversation with Mark Ulano\n\nWhat was it like working for an iconic director like Martin Scorsese?\n\nWell, first and foremost, filmmaking is my religion. I was born and grew up in New York City. My coming of age as a filmmaker was in the late ’60s, early ’70, and Martin Scorsese’s emergence into the iconography of cinema was at its beginnings then, so working with him now has been very significant for me. I believe he was an adjunct teacher under Haig Manoogian at NYU in those days. Haig really created the NYU film school, which eventually has become one of the giant places of learning for cinema and for emerging filmmakers. This was at a time when film school was really looked down upon in Hollywood, and even the New York community as an affectation. It’s very different now. Marty’s scholarship, then and now, and all the time in between, speaks to a very important part of my life.\n\nTo be asked to join the very evolved community around Marty at this point, and on this particular project is one of the high points of my career and my life, so it was very special. I consider it a profound privilege for the actual engagement, the sense of community it provides, and for the work itself. I think this film is a work of substance that will stand on its own indefinitely, a very rare thing. I’ve been blessed in this regard with various directors, but Marty is … well, if I had a string of pearls, he could be considered one of the most special gems. I’m very, very glad that at this stage of my life and career that we had the chance to work together. To partner with his family team, Tom Fleischman, his Re-recording Mixer, oh my God, thirty years with Marty, and Thelma Schoonmaker, sixty years working with Marty in the editing room, since Woodstock, the movie, and through all of the other films, that partnering. To be invited inside the secret halls of that friendship, to contribute day-by-day, it doesn’t get better.\n\nYou share your work with John Pritchett.\n\nAbsolutely. John was originally brought on to do the show through the Producer, Daniel Lupi, who I’ve also worked with in the past, and the same with the First AD, Adam Sumner. John had to leave the show very early on for personal reasons unrelated to the film and I was asked to come in. Obviously, this prevented my normal preparation. I was diving into a group of super professionals at the AAA list level. I’ve done that before. The DP and I, who I admire enormously, Rodrigo Prieto, the Gaffer, Ian Kincaid, many people in the crew, above and below the line, were people with whom I had creative work history. I got to overlap slightly with John’s last day of production. It was on a Friday, and I was taking over on a Monday, and we were together that whole weekend, me prepping my gear and my team. John was characteristically generous about helping me get in alignment with the show. If I had questions regarding continuity, we collaborated.\n\nMy friendship and experience with John actually began forty years prior, when I was asked to do a Robert Altman movie. John was not available, and he walked me through the setup in 1987 which was ½” reel to reel Otari 8-track. In my opinion, John Pritchett is one of the giants in our field. He’s had one of the most iconic careers in production sound. John’s history has been an amazing balance of the high-end tentpole projects, and the purposeful, passionate, independent art side of the work.\n\nMy team included Doug Shamburger, Patrushkha Mierzwa and Nick Ronzio, Brandon Loulias and Gary Raymond. All contributed enormously and knew we were on a special project with a special film family.\n\nWhen you’re called on to be in a circumstance at the highest level, it’s like going to the summit. Marty has enormous vitality, he has enormous respect for the content of his projects. He worked for a very extended time in preproduction building trust with the Osage Nation, including them in the run up to the work and their participation both at the concept, the emotion, the story level, and physically in the film. Many descendants of this event, these tragedies are participants in front of and behind the camera.\n\nThe Osage community that exists today, that emerged from these tragedies from the 1920s, represents a unique piece of American history. All the parties seem to have a great sense of appreciation for the respect shown in telling this story. Key creative relationships contributed to this journey. Robert De Niro and Marty have done ten films together. Leo and Marty have done seven. Combined with this ensemble, Lily Gladstone, John Lithgow, Brendan Fraser, Charlie Musselwhite, the list goes on. Everyone wanted to come and be a part of this film, and to join a seasoned filmmaker like Martin Scorsese in full possession of his powers, up close and personal, shot by shot through COVID and 108 degree in-the-shade weather, never flagging. It was rockin’ man. It was just rockin’.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon was filmed in Oklahoma.\n\nWe based out of a town called Bartlesville, which is the central town of the Phillips Oil Company and has a lot of Oklahoma history in terms of its oil wealth. In fact, there is a very significant Frank Lloyd Wright building there that is in the middle of this prairie universe that is beloved and well cared for. Bartlesville is about thirty miles out of the towns where these tragedies took place. Killers of the Flower Moon is the title of David Grann’s nonfiction book that was published in 2017. The book takes a deep dive into the events that this film is based on.\n\nWe filmed in the real places where these events took place, where these conspiracies and murders were hatched and executed by this community toward the Osage Nation. They turned the town back into the 1920s, they hauled in tons of dirt to return the paved town roads back to the period of the murders. We used an avalanche of ’20s period vehicles and horses for the background crosses. Basically, we time traveled to the early 1920s Oklahoma and everything around you was of that era, all the production design, costume design, etc., were lovingly created in great detail to evoke the period and bathe the cast in that special environment. We were forty-five miles from Tulsa, where almost simultaneously, the Black Wall Street tragedy was taking place. The two tragedies are unrelated in terms of individuals and shared conspiracy but are connected by the endemic racism in the local community, and the hostility toward the successful progression of people of color.\n\nIn Tulsa, it had to do with an emerging affluent, African American community. In Osage County and Washington County, counties that were inside the Osage Reservation, the members of the Osage Nation were per capita, the wealthiest humans on the planet Earth due to the oil wealth that befell them as a community. The first stages of the emerging toxic racism appeared when the local white community successfully lobbied governmental entities to create a corrupt gatekeeper system of the wealth of the Osage members. They were declared legally incompetent to manage their own financial affairs and had to self-declare, “I am incompetent.” Each time they would come before these attorneys, or local business people who decided whether or not they could spend their money the way they wanted to, they were told that they had no legitimate authority.\n\nThen came the larger conspiracy, which is centered around the notion of marrying the Osage women. Men were marrying the women and then murdering them, their siblings, their parents, their children, to acquire and concentrate the mineral rights or the head rights of the oil wealth. The conspiracy’s leader is the character played by Robert De Niro, based on a real person, William Hale. Hale used his acquired fluency in the Osage language to gain the trust of the community as the prime liaison with the white community. The vocal tonality employed by Robert De Niro for his character becomes a tool for deception. His nephew, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is ultimately a conflicted henchman torn between his love of his wife and family and fear and greed enveloping him in his uncle’s conspiracy. There were over two hundred murders, primarily people in their mid-to-late 20s, and only a very few were investigated.\n\nTo this day, there’s controversy over the roles played by all the parties, but the facts are indisputable. Being in those actual places, in those rooms, in those buildings, in the physical space of where these things happened, created a kind of special energy that you don’t often experience on a film. It tore away some of the artifice, creating a sense of authenticity for this story. There were moments that were moving from fiction into reality and back, that were almost surreal.\n\nThe mindset was Indians were lower than dogs, and you could murder them without worry of any consequence. They went to the President of the United States to get help, and that’s how the early FBI got brought into this situation. We filmed in those places where it happened, it was kind of spooky. The only other time I’ve had this kind of experience was on Inglourious Basterds where we were shooting in the Vermacht headquarters in rooms where Hitler and Goebbels and others walked the floor of the rooms with all of the power and insanity at their disposal. This was similar in a certain way.\n\nWhat is Marty’s style in terms of the way he shoots and how did that impact your work?\n\nWell, when you have a great conductor, composer, and leadership of an orchestra, the first order of business, usually for those who have risen above the rest, is that they bring a community, an ensemble around them of like-minded artists who will come and contribute at the maximum level of their capacity without reservation. 150% all in for the entire tour of duty. That’s his history, and that’s his methodology. He’s old school, and I mean that in the most respectful and appreciative way, because it’s not common. He understands the power of a director is through delegation to advocates who understand his intent and execute that intent flawlessly in concert with the other disciplines adjacent. When that happens, your percentages of achieving a magic above the mundane are greatly increased. Rodrigo Prieto, as a filmmaker contributes, he’s a cinematographer who is always about serving the project, not about serving territory. It shows in his body of work. Marty’s the same, he limits his communications in terms of the obvious and is generous in his communications in terms of the choice of options before him. Knowing the difference between these two is a joy to witness in the day-by-day, shot-by-shot process. It just warms my heart.\n\nHis process is completely focused. What are we doing? What is this shot? Where are we in the moment of the moments of this shot where the camera should be for emphasis. All of the other elements are tied to that idea of the grammar in place. It’s not, “Let’s get a bunch of stuff and then figure it out later.” It’s, “What do we need the audience to be experiencing at this moment and be around that realization all day long?” So, he does, and he expects everyone around him to have that already as part of their tool set. You have to be up to that game. You have to have that fluency in your work. My sense is that if you are not, and he knows it, you lean, I would suspect more toward disappointment than anger because he’s invited you into his house and you’re a guest in his house. “Please, I love the most that you can do, please bring that to this project because this project matters.”\n\nWith your long work history with Quentin Tarantino, is there any similarity or are there differences between Quentin and Marty?\n\nGreat similarity in this piece, in the predisposition to do the homework in advance of coming to the day. They’re both absolute students, perpetual students of cinema. That’s not a static thing. They haven’t packed up two pounds of film knowledge and figured they’re on their way. Every day they’re still learning by what we’re doing in the day, and they’re still learning at night because they’re watching everybody else’s contribution in the work. They’re archivists, they’re historians, they’re passionate about, “How do I best do my piece? How do I maintain my fluency as a filmmaker through the work? How much can I learn by the work of others?” So, there’s a great commonality. Also, their day-to-day shot approach. They don’t micromanage. They manage from above, they don’t waste their resources on second guessing. They made that investment in the people they chose to bring around them in the first place. And that frees that energy to be where it needs to be.\n\nHow about your crew?\n\nWe discussed the transition that I took over the show very early on. With minimal to zero prep, but had the good fortune of having had many pre-existing relationships with key departments, in particular, the entourages of Leonardo and even Bob De Niro, but also the Director of Photography, the Gaffer, the First AD and others were people that I had had done deep intensive projects with in the past, the Line Producer, etcetera. Also having a very healthy friend relationship with John Pritchett, who was gracious and helpful in the transition. My usual long-standing professional marriage with Tom Hartig as my colleague and Boom Operator since 1999, and Patrushkha Mierzwa, also Boom Operator colleague and alternating UST since 1982 or ’81. Tom was unavailable, he was involved in another project, this came up rather suddenly. He was committed to me for the following project, which was the Whitney Houston film, but he wasn’t available for the sudden arrival of the Scorsese project. So, I got very fortunate, I reached out to Doug Shamburger, who is one of the greats. He’s boom royalty who has a long, long history with many of the best mixers. Most recently, with Willie Burton on Oppenheimer. Doug and I have been trying to work together for literally fifteen years, twenty years. When I would call him, he’s not available, when he’d call me. I’d already be under way with my regular team.\n\nIt was kind of a running joke for us for years, and we’re friends socially, he and his wife and Patrushkha and I. But he was available, coming off another show, there was a slight overlap, he worked that out because it was another Apple show, and Apple was also in support of Marty. So, Doug was in, and came to Oklahoma. Patrushkha was not available for the beginning of the show. She helped with the run up and the transition, but had other commitments initially. Nick Ronzio, who’s fantastic, came on as our UST, Utility Sound Technician, and so I had this amazing team of Doug and Nick to start and to get us going, hitting the ground running.\n\nThe tricky part was they were not immediately familiar with my packages, my regular crew was, but the compensating part was they’re both such bulletproof hardcore veterans that didn’t matter in the least. They immediately were right at speed, which was great. Nick had a limited availability, so this was a bit of a patch work, which is really unusual for me, but he stayed on for, I think approximately the first 40% of the show, something like that. Patrushkha was still not available, so we had Brandon Loulias.\n\nBrandon came on to be the interim third until Patrushkha could break free and come and do the rest of the show. Brandon worked his butt off and was also an important contributing factor. One of his special skills was his knowledge of electronics, his engineering knowledge of Yamaha gear. That came in very handy because some of the environments we were in were particularly unfriendly to that gear. Although I have redundancy, there were moments where we needed to tear something apart, and Brandon had a skill set that could take care of that in the field.\n\nThen Patrushkha came on, completing the team. She also had prior relationships with other crew members like the Gaffer and others that were forty-year friends and working relationships. Ian Kincaid, a shout out to one of the most brilliant artists in the film world as a Gaffer. Our department is not a vertical hierarchy, we all share very different but overlapping responsibilities, and I look at us as a jazz trio if you will, or jazz quartet, depending on the situation.\n\nWe had a local trainee from the Oklahoma community, John Martinez, who continued from the week or two that he had with John Prichett’s crew, and that was very, very helpful. He worked very hard, he had excellent social skills, and was a quick learner. We needed that because of the physical geography and the environment, the weather and relentless heat, dust and assaulting factors, all pushing us to our better selves.\n\nWas there music playback?\n\nWe had playback. Gary Raymond came and did several playback scenes for us that were very important. We had a giant scene with a huge body count of extras. It was an evening, with a large band. We also had a wedding sequence that Gary did for us that was intertwined with dialog, dancing, giant crane shots, and music playback.\n\nWas there any live recording of music?\n\nThere was a little bit on a piano. There was a little bit at the wedding party. There was a thing with a guy with a guitar, which I don’t think made it into the film. They did a bit of additional material in New York with Tod Maitland, who had worked with Marty in the past, so there was a very good established relationship. Tod did that additional material. It’s the 1930s radio show, that was Tod’s work. They did a live recap with Marty cameoing in the scene, which is fun, kind of a delicious button, really. It’s a surprise. Tod did another couple of days of pickups in Oklahoma, much later in the year.\n\nWas that the final coda?\n\nThe final coda was the high angle shot, with hundreds of extras. This is a big film, it’s an epic film, and structurally, very akin to a Bolero, a climbing crescendo in plot, character arc and musicality. Robbie Robertson’s final film score, sparce and percussive is the ideal cohort to the film’s other elements.\n\nThis was my fourth film with Leonardo, and my second with Bob De Niro. Those prior relationships, particularly with Leo, created an immediate environment of trust. Leo, in his generosity, basically introduced me to Marty on set in front of others, which doesn’t always happen with a huge warm embrace and a, “Yeah, we just started right now.” So that was a good thing.\n\nWere they all practical locations or was there some stage work?\n\nThe radio show in New York was stage work. We had some stage work that was done in airplane hangars. They built sets that were repeats of some of the actual practical exterior locations. So it was a blend, I would put it at about 80/20 practicals to stage work, maybe 70/30.\n\nDuring the production, it was also the 40th anniversary of Raging Bull, and so for the Tribeca Film Festival, which is Bob De Niro’s baby. They set up a live streaming interview with Leonardo as the moderator interviewing Bob De Niro and Marty, to reflect on their journey together making Raging Bull. Marty could have done stand-up as an alternate career. He was hilarious, and the auditorium was absolutely packed to the gills, but it was being sent back to New York live streaming for the Tribeca event. There was a lot of good-will and good humor involved.\n\nThere was a fair number of driving sequences with period vehicles.\n\nAlong with that factor, there was a tendency to have frequent background crosses with period vehicles at full bore. I did engage passionately with our picture car department, because every time we were in the town or anywhere, that was always a visual code for the period. We incorporated spark suppression when possible. Can we get the quietest versions, working with the ADs, so that their choreography of a vehicle passing during a dialog scene wasn’t during the most intimate and significant information being said? It required an enormous amount of cooperation on the part of many people, primarily the production, AD department, and my team with Transpo. We worked it out shot by shot.\n\nAnd they accommodated you?\n\nCertainly, most of the time. If we were at a point where the scene’s information and the character revelation were at true risk and the threshold had been crossed, we’d engage in refining the coordinated timing. My threshold of concern, generally, is if there’s a competing element breaking the connection between the characters and the audience. You don’t want discordant, anachronistic sounds that disrupt the flow. But if it doesn’t break my threshold, if it doesn’t break the connection between the characters and the audience, and is functional in terms of how it can be handled editorially later, then we’re in the zone. That’s a moving target as we have more and more post-production tools that allow us to legitimately, through algorithms, separate certain elements after the fact that would, in the past, to be intrinsically married. But I also know that if you don’t become a student of that closely, you can make problematic assumptions about how much that can be applied.\n\nIf we go to the heart of the movie itself, the fundamental motivation of making the movie has a kind of purity to it, a social relevance. Not a bleeding-heart version but a just version of that. This was a stark indisputable, complex, profoundly racist event that took place in the 20th century in the American culture. The duality of the rights of man and the lack of perception that certain communities did not get recognized as full human beings is deeply explored. It was an extension of the Dred Scott decision in the 1800s that helped set the table for the Civil War. You’re looking at this whole community that conspired, in multiple murders, around the idea that the Indian Nation was less than human and non-deserving of what they acquired. They had been forced away from their native homeland into un-arable terrible property which they had the foresight to purchase inclusive of the mineral rights and ironically turned out to be the wealthiest oil strike in American history, twenty years hence.\n\nThe oil wealth led the Osage to live like wealthy white Americans.\n\nBefore they got their arms around the Osage Nation as a group, and had many of them legally declared incompetent to manage their own money, they had lived the way any one of those in the white culture would have themselves. Yes, they had the most Pierce-Arrows in the United States in one place, they bought furs, they sent their kids to European universities. Wouldn’t you? They had achieved a kind of cultural iconography of wealth in the 1920s, that was in parity to what wealthy Americans did in the 1920s. That just enraged the locals. They had multiple pricing schemes for the Indians who would pay ten, fifteen, twenty-five times for the same groceries and sundry products. It was brutal. Even so, the Osage took it all in stride, philosophically, un-materialistic, generous to a fault, carrying themselves with great dignity.\n\nThere are certain emotional and creative takeaways I had from this project that I think are significant. One is, Marty and company are among the few places where the tradition of stories that matter, being done with authenticity and integrity, can survive the gauntlet of interference that the industry provides frequently. It’s too rare, but it’s also an example of the possibility. When you are invited to enjoy the privilege of participating in that kind of environment, you can, and I did, have a spirit reward of being in the elevated place of the purity of intent.\n\nIt was a subject that had deep roots in significant issues that resonate beyond its own time, being done with the maximum integrity possible by great artists in their work. We were part of that. That affects you emotionally. It affects you creatively. It rewards you. It’s a kind of food that can’t be had in a grocery store. [laughs] It’s a kind of food that lets you know that you’re realizing your maximum potential and applying it in a worthy purpose. That doesn’t happen often enough, but it is sort of… It’s addictive.\n\nAre there scenes that carry some importance to you?\n\nYes. Several. One scene is when the De Niro character as the uncle, and the brother of the Leonardo’s character bring him to the Mason Hall and literally paddle him for his dissonance to their conspiracy. They punish him for not being on board completely for the murders and the consolidation of the mineral rights. We were in the real Mason Hall, one that carried the framed photo of the criminal Hale on its walls as stalwart member of the Local community. We were using real props and furnishings, and the environment was in the real place. This is the unveiling of De Niro the puppet master behind all of this. His facade to the community was as the benevolent intermediary between the Osage Nation and the white community, which was a cover for his true evil nature.\n\nThat was a very powerful scene to me, and it was also very challenging with huge wide framing, and a reverberant space. All the things that are sort of technical questions when you’re gearing up. I felt very, very happy about how we were able to take all of those challenging elements and somehow merge them into a coherent approach to the scene. We didn’t lose the space of the room, but we weren’t lost in the distance of the room, we were able to emphasize the accent points in the scene in terms of what the characters were doing by mic placement, by mixing, by levels, by all the different tools that seem like innocuous solely engineering things, but they’re actually paintbrushes. The way a camera can slightly move in on somebody for emphasis at a key moment, and to also do that with sound emphasizes that.\n\nAnother scene that really comes to mind that was hugely significant on an emotional level. This was the scene inside the ritual structure where the tribe was having their strategy session to send an emissary to Washington, DC to plead with the American government for some kind of relief for these continuing murders that were not being investigated, that were being ignored by local authorities, and state level. They met with the President of the United States. Consider the courage it took for the Indian Nation to go and create access, because their standing legally was as a separate nation. To be seen by the President of the United States, it was Calvin Coolidge, and to get a response. They’re one of the first cases of the FBI. That’s a central piece of the story in the original book.\n\nDuring that scene, in between setups, one of the Nation’s present-day leaders who’s in the scene and is one of the principal characters, stood up and made a speech spontaneously to everyone present. We were not shooting, this wasn’t part of the film. He spoke about how significant this was and what it meant to them as a community, and the authenticity of Marty’s team to be stringent about respecting their story and the meaning of their story. Not only to themselves, but to the larger community of the country, and how much it meant to them. He was passionate and it was personal. As he started to speak, and I will be proud about this because I said, “Doug, get in there, aim that mic at the speaker, be delicate about it but do it.” I hit record and I got the whole thing. I felt great because I went to Marty at the end and I said, “Marty, we have that whole thing, it was recorded. Marty’s such a New Yorker, and he just lit up. He was like, “Fucking great. Oh my God.” He went back into the set and re-positioned the camera to zero in on this speaker to repeat for the camera as an honest improv, which is now in the movie. So that was another moment where we were moving from fiction to reality, because a lot of these people are descendants of those murdered people, and this was their story. It’s complex, and yes, the book was a New York Times bestseller but here this is all being distilled into a movie which is potentially a more significant cultural event in our present-day culture.\n\n(Part 2 of this discussion will continue in the spring edition.)\n\nI was no stranger to the Mission: Impossible series and have worked on several films with Tom Cruise. Dead Reckoning Part One was my third outing in the Mission: Impossible franchise, following Fallout and Rogue Nation, all directed by Christopher McQuarrie and of course, starring Tom Cruise (TC). I also worked with Chris McQuarrie (McQ) when he was the writer on another TC project that I worked on called Valkyrie.\n\nOne of the advantages to having the writer as director is that on the previous two films, the script was continually evolving during production and even in post production. It is not unusual to complete principal photography and then return for several weeks of additional shooting to hone the plot and storytelling arc. This, my third film in the series, not counting some work that I did on the first Mission: Impossible, was to be different. We didn’t have a script at all! That is to say there was no script in pre-production and we would often only be given scenes on the day or a few days prior to shooting a sequence. During pre-production, McQ would call all HoDs to a meeting and tell us the plot and how he saw each scene developing, what stunts were being considered and hopefully, what requirements could be expected of us. Of course, this meant there was also no traditional scheduling. We mostly just worked from a block calendar. Good communication with the director and production would be key to making this work.\n\nMy first contribution to this latest episode started in October 2019 when I was already working on Black Widow. I had a message from TC’s team to say that he was in training for a speed-flying sequence that would be featured in the film but that it was not due to start shooting until February 2023. Fortunately, I was about to travel to Atlanta without my UK team so was able to send my 1st AS, Lloyd Dudley, to look after this aspect of pre-production. As always, TC needed communications for this stunt sequence and also as usual, there would be some dialog. Though it is well known that Tom always performs his own stunts, long ago I suggested that giving him dialog during the stunt sequence would also confirm to the audience that this is him and not a stunt double. I have sometimes come to regret that suggestion.\n\nOn every Mission: Impossible, the stunts get bigger and seemingly more dangerous though I should say that for Stunt Co-ordinator Wade Eastwood and his team, safety is paramount. As part of the safety requirement is good communications with TC and the stunt team, I decided to utilise the bone conduction technology that I had developed for use in the last Mission: Impossible (Fallout). The system uses custom ear moulds that are both microphones and earpieces. A small conductor is designed to sit on a specific part of the ear to pick up speech with minimal background noise. Though you may imagine speed flying to be near silent as opposed to the helicopter sequences that I had previously used bone conduction for, the wind noise could be quite high and difficult to keep off a conventional microphone. There were also safety considerations that we did not want a lot of loose cables that could interfere with the parachute when deployed. We were now using Audio Ltd. (now Sound Devices) A10 radios in simultaneous transmit and record modes as we are able to do outside of USA. Communications were using digital Motorola radios that gave good long-distance coverage to a base station setup. In conjunction with my long-term technical collaborator, Jim McBride, and his son Mark, custom interfaces were made to integrate both recording and comms systems. Lloyd and Mark spent most of the rest of 2019 with TC on various locations, including the Lake District in UK and in South Africa.\n\nHaving finished on Black Widow, I started my prep early in 2020 tech scouting various locations, including Venice where we were due to start shooting. It was on the tech scout that when standing in line for the buffet breakfast with McQ behind a large party of Chinese tourists, who were coughing and sneezing, that McQ remarked, “I’m not going to stay here when we shoot, you don’t know what you’ll catch.” Though it was said as a joke, we both requested to stay in different hotels, though for me, it was to a hotel that I had previously stayed in when shooting Spider-Man: Far from Home, because it had a very good space for equipment storage and better boat access than the typical tourist hotels. It was also in a part of Venice that was away from the tourist areas and a better place to spend several weeks in Venice.\n\nWe were a couple of days away from our first shoot day and testing our record function of the A10 radios for a boat sequence. Here, I planned to record on the body-worn A10’s and some well-placed A10’s for sound FX. I had recently been working with Paul Isaacs of Sound Devices to develop conform software so that all the recordings could be conformed to what is shot on camera and available for dailies as a poly wav file. We were testing with stand-ins on the canals when we started to hear in the news about COVID-19 causing some concerns in areas of Northern Italy not far from Venice. It was a matter of days and the day before we were due to start shooting that we were closed down and evacuated back to quarantine in the UK. A small number of the crew had symptoms but were unsure whether it was COVID or the flu and fortunately, no one suffered any serious effects.\n\nWe spent the rest of the year up until September expecting to restart as the epidemic grew bigger and more serious. The rest is history for all of us but McQ and TC were very keen to restart production as soon as possible but it was to be six months of downtime.\n\nBefore we eventually started back to work in September 2020, I spent some of the downtime looking into communication systems that could allow us to work efficiently whilst maintain social distancing and also that could allow remote working in the event that director, DP, or any of the key crew were forced to isolate. I discovered the BOLERO system from a company called Riedel https://www.riedel.net/en/products-solutions/intercom/bolero-wireless-intercom/.\n\nThe system was mainly used in F1 motorsport and big sporting events and allowed full duplex communications over large areas. I made contact with Paul Rivens, who ran the Riedel UK Operation. Good news for us was that due to the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics, there were lots of units available. Paul kindly set me up on a training course at Riedel in UK and then set up a demo for production. The producers asked me to specify a system which they then bought. I passed on most of this information to the British Film Institute, who were also investigating ways to get us all working again and many other productions in UK adopted the BOLERO system. We bought twenty-five BOLERO handsets for key HoDs, then integrated with our Motorola walkie-talkies so that everyone could communicate effectively from a safe distance. I also integrated my directors talk-back system and the video assist system and sent production audio to the BOLERO handsets so that there was no need to wear an IEM or to carry a walkie-talkie. A BOLERO antennae typically covers an area the size of a soccer pitch and multiple antennae connected by an Ethernet cable can be used to cover vast areas. I was even able to integrate cellphones when much larger distances needed to be covered, for example, when shooting the car-chase sequences in central Rome.\n\nWe restarted production in Norway. The first sequence was shooting the big motorcycle off the mountain stunt that was seen in most of the press and teaser trailers long before the film’s eventual release. Once again using the Bone Conduction Tech to communicate with TC and to record any dialog. We recorded this to a body-worn A10 and to my Scorpio and CL16 main unit cart setup.\n\nCOVID was still a big problem, so to create a bubble for the crew and actors, we all stayed on a Hurtigruten cruise ship. This was a brand-new ship that had only just come into service and was now laid up because there were no cruises operating. The beauty of being on the ship in addition to the comfort and great food was that when we needed to move to another location, we did so overnight waking up to the sound of multiple helicopters ready to ferry us to set.\n\nWe then stayed in Norway to shoot much of a sequence on trains that involved cast members on the roof of the train carriages and sequences inside the train. The majority of interiors were completed much later in UK in rail carriage sets built on the backlot at Longcross Studios.\n\nAlso, in Norway we shot some of the speed-flying and parachute sequences with TC often jumping from a helicopter. The Bone Conduction Tech once again allowed dialog to be recorded, as well as enabling communications with helicopters and cameras.\n\nAfter Norway, we moved to Italy to shoot in Venice and Rome. We shot fairly conventionally in Venice using our BOLERO system for communications which McQ, our director, had fallen in love with, as it allowed him to speak directly to his DP, AD’s, Gaffer, Key Grip, Operators, and to the Voice of God system if necessary. This included a big party sequence in Palazzo Ducale. Boat sequences and chase sequences through the streets and alleys of Venice were shot using body-worn A10 transmitters and the tracks conformed to a poly wav because it was neither possible for us all to be in the boats or for us all to cram into a following boat. The Rome car-chase sequences presented similar issues and employed similar solutions. This sequence has a lot of cars and a lot of dialog. We rigged the cars with A10’s and fitted them to the actors putting everything into record. There were no follow vehicles except when using Russian Arm or similar vehicle-mounted cranes or tracking vehicles. Mostly the cameras were mounted on the action vehicles the director was watching by high-powered video transmitters which were not always in range. I sent guide production audio to the video transmitters and also used cellphones connected to the car hands-free systems to communicate back to the BOLERO system to keep the cars always in communication. When we broke dailies at lunchtime, we did not actually break for lunch as we always work continuous days, I would conform the individual files recorded on the audio A10 and A20 transmitters to a single poly file for the editors. I did the same at the end of the shooting day. As explained earlier, this process is relatively simple. The best way is to leave all of the transmitters in record for as long as possible and not to stop them in between takes. The metadata for slate and take information is entered onto the main recorder, in this case, a Scorpio with a CL16. Even if there was no useable audio, the Scorpio is put into record just to capture the metadata info. Making a sound report in a CSV (Comma-separated Values) format creates an EDL (Edit decision list) that is used to conform all of the individual A10/A20 recordings into poly files for each take ignoring anything recorded between the takes using SD-Utility https://www.sounddevices.com/product/sd-utility/\n\nThis means that from an editorial perspective, they receive a single poly file for each take that is similar to what they would expect in conventional shooting. I became very fast at conforming, meaning this did not take up too much time at the end of the day. Of course, it did mean that my team had to be particularly vigilant at timecode synching all of the A10 and A20 radios. It was not until toward the end of production that the Nexus was available which made the whole process much easier. With the Nexus, all transmitters are automatically timecoded and it is possible to remotely stop and start recording on each device, as well as making other changes like file naming, sleeping/unsleeping, changing frequencies, and adjusting power levels. This has been quite a game changer for me since we now set up a network making access to the transmitters possible for any of my team from a phone or iPad.\n\nWe had several shutdowns due to COVID but on the whole, probably managed to keep going more than most productions.\n\nAfter Italy, our next location was Abu Dhabi. The good thing here was that there was already a vaccination program in place for any of the local crew and hotel staff we were likely to come into contact with. However, we were all still unvaccinated as there were as yet no vaccines approved in UK or Europe. We shot primarily in an airport that was under construction and yet to be opened, and for the first time, shot in a fairly conventional manner. We also shot the desert sequences which were tricky to protect so much equipment in what was intended to be a sandstorm. We worked mostly in Land Cruisers that we had fitted out. However, COVID was becoming a real problem in the UK with yet another wave and new strains of the virus being discovered. We had to leave Abu Dhabi before we had shot everything needed because the UK government was about to introduce an isolation program that on our return to the UK would force us to isolate in specific hotels for two weeks. We made it back just in time and eventually rebuilt parts of the airport set in a shopping centre in Birmingham, and the desert sets in a quarry, to complete the sequences.\n\nMost of the remainder of the film was shot on sets at Longcross Studio either on one of the two stages that we had specifically built for us during the COVID shutdown or on the backlot and on UK locations.\n\nIt is often said that “Necessity Is the Mother of Invention,” and in this case, the necessity to comply with COVID restrictions forced us to investigate new ways of working. Mainly with a complete change of how we shoot and record car and chase sequences to avoid the crew being jammed into follow vehicles by using the recording capabilities of radio mics and the ability to conform to a single poly file, and as well as the use of duplex communications to avoid having to work too closely together on set enabling us to communicate efficiently.\n\nCertainly, as far as the Mission: Impossible series is concerned, I do not think there will be any going back on the changes we made during the COVID pandemic. We have proved that recording on radio mics, particularly now that the A20 has 32-bit float and SD Utility has the capability of conforming the files for editors, is the way to go. I’m not certain that other productions will continue with the BOLERO communication systems but our director, Christopher McQuarrie, has requested the system to be expanded for Dead Reckoning Part Two which is already in production, though currently on hiatus due to the industrial action taken by writers and actors.\n\nWe are already planning how we will record dialog and facilitate communications for some even more daring stunts, including using some new technology to record underwater. Currently, I am not permitted to write about this or the even more amazing stuff that we are doing but look forward to telling you all about it in 2024.\n\nDue to the extended schedule because of COVID, we had a number of different team members for the shoot. These were the following: Lloyd Dudley, 1st AS/Additional Production Mixer; Tom Harrison, 1st AS/Boom Operator; Luigi Pini, 1st AS/Boom Operator (Italy); Freya Clarke, 1st AS/Boom Operator; Hosea Ntaborwa, 1st AS/Boom Operator; Ayesha Breithaupt, 2nd AS.\n\nby Amber Michaëlle Maher\n\nBefore electric turns the lights on and while the stages are still cold, you open the large elephant doors, do your morning walkthrough, strategize, and get your carts out of your truck and set up for the day.\n\nThe Video Assist Operator’s job involves setting up video villages, routing signals to other departments, recording camera and sound signals for playback, and more recently, streaming video and sound signals in sync to every director, producer, and crew member who needs to be able to see what is being shot. Most of the time, you’re a one-person department on set, so there is no time to waste. You have to plan where you’re going to land and hope you’ve picked the perfect spot for your director and producers to work. Hook it all up and go! Setting all this up typically is the first ten to fifteen minutes of the day.\n\nDoing all of this work typically requires three carts, each weighing approximately 200 lbs–500 lbs. First, the main cart is compact. It’s equipped with a fully engineered computer system to run QTAKE, AJA routers to support four or more camera/video and sound inputs, A-D camera outputs, secondary village outputs, and all the cables; snakes; and other miscellaneous items necessary to get through the day. These setups are typically designed by the most skilled and OCD engineers in the business and are designed to make use of every nook and cranny of space. Often you feel like the pit crew at the Indy 500 or at the Grand Prix because you need to be able to plug in and reset at a moment’s notice. Five minutes to move your all three carts or bang! You’re dead!\n\nThe second cart is the director’s cart, better known as a “Village,” and it is outfitted with three or four very expensive OLED monitors, an extra stand, and maybe even a robocup—if you’re fancy. This is all in order to provide the director with the tools they need to see and hear what’s happening on the set. Lastly, your third cart is for the producers so that they have a “Producers’ Village” of their own. This allows their own creative visions to be in a separate world from what’s going on in the director’s world. The two should not mix. Therefore, hooking up and servicing all three to your carts is a little like being a video and sound octopus, spreading out in many directions at a time. And that’s just with three carts; sometimes larger productions require additional carts. It can be physically overwhelming at times, especially when off-site, on location, or off road somewhere.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, video assist work was fairly standardized. The job revolved around taking in audio/video signals for the purpose of servicing the rest of the set. You’d play back footage as needed, mostly as reference material for whomever needed it. While it could be a large workload, most of the time you knew what you were signing up for. COVID-19 completely changed our jobs as we knew them. The need for social distancing and new safety measures caused an acceleration of remote technology that has had a massive impact on Video Assist Operators.\n\nDue to distancing restrictions imposed by COVID, the remainder of the crew can’t hover around video village like the old days. Instead, everyone else who needs a video feed gets an iPad setup. People working remotely and talent who need video in their trailers are usually given Apple TV’s. New people come and go all the time and they need to be streaming right along with everyone else. There are a lot more plates spinning in the air on any given day. The rest of the day is spent alternating between recordist, customer service, playback, emotional support person, creative consultant, and Apple Genius/IT specialist. Everyone on your set is watching and listening to the QTAKE feed, ready to get the day started and ended, and create Hollywood’s movie magic in-between.\n\nAll of this requires that the Video Assist Operator be a lot more involved in the minute-to-minute decision making than in the days before COVID. I’ve found myself on a first name basis with directors, showrunners, and executive producers a lot more than I did before the pandemic. By coordinating playback and communications among the top brass, I have had the wild privilege to be a fly on the wall and to be involved problem solving with these giants. We look over shots, sequences, and script changes for some of the best TV series and films in the business. Often the director or VFX team needs a quick mock-up and rendering to make sure that what we’ve been shooting is working. This means that the most-effective operators require multiple skill sets. Can you cut a few clips together? Can you do some on-the-spot VFX in a pinch? Can you figure out why one producer’s iPad just won’t seem to work? Great! Now can you do all of that while you’re also doing your regular recording, cataloging, playback, and streaming?\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the cameras and crew may be on the move while you are required to stay behind and review footage with the director/producer/showrunner/etc. Once you are no longer needed, there’s a mad dash to get your three carts moved to the next location so production isn’t waiting on you! This is one example of why having a Y-7 Video Assist Utility working with you is crucial; they can help move the carts and set up while you are working on other tasks with above-the-line staff. Utilities are integral to the ability to run, patch cable, and troubleshoot technical issues while the operator is otherwise occupied.\n\nFor example, I once was crawling underneath the stage because I had lost my internet connection and had to re-run the cable right quick. It was early in the morning before anything had really started. I was solo on this show and didn’t have a Y-7 with me, but I thought I had a brief second to investigate it. So I’m under the stage when suddenly, I heard, “Where is the Video Assist? Where is Amber?” over the walkies. I popped up out of the middle of a starship stage like a hamster out of a hidey-hole, shouting, “I’m here!” I was covered in dust while the whole cast and crew were staring at me. The Executive Producer needed me to return immediately to do a comp, so I ran right up to do it, but I knew I still had to fix the cable, too. Working our jobs is to constantly be on call while on set. It’s very difficult to leave your cart, even to do another part of your job. Time management is key, managing expectations is key, and under-promising and over-delivering helps. Video assist responsibilities on set have grown beyond what is reasonable to ask of a single person and the amount of work is only increasing as technology develops and is incorporated into our workflows. We need a bigger team. Time is of the essence and a precious commodity on any large production. There’s too much at stake and this department is one of the worst places to cut corners. You are, in essence, cutting your directors and producers off from quality checking your film. Mistakes that are missed on set can cost a fortune to fix in post or reshoot later.\n\nOn Star Trek: Picard, there was a previous shot that we had recorded that was “obviously” not working with our new crane footage. If not fixed, talent would have to be flown back into the country and crew would have to go into a sixth day. Due to my previous VFX know-how, I was asked to perform a miracle and composite the two shots. I was able to mask, animate, render, and comp the previous shot together with the new one to work seamlessly. The whole crew held their breath while I worked. And when our showrunner gave it his nod of approval, everyone cheered. Our VFX Director patted me on the back then told me, “Do you know you just saved them about one year of your salary in what it would have taken to fix that shot?” This was only possible because I had the necessary support to do my job well on that show, but if I hadn’t been a part of the conversation because I’d been off fixing a broken cable or rebooting a router because there was no one to help me, the show would have paid through the nose for it.\n\nAnd this isn’t an isolated incident. When I recently worked on Beverly Hills Cop 4, I was the Video Assist Utility and was able to make quick-reference video edits on the fly on my laptop, which were used by the Director to save time and to move on to the next shot quickly. It was very helpful to all involved. On Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, the advanced video engineering technology at our fingertips was mind-blowing. Video assist worked together with the video wall engineers and camera technicians to “scan” actors in these LED video wall stages in order to “paste” them into the films. This is done live, as we’re shooting, while we comp or overlay it all together. Then I had to use a secure double-encrypted link from QTAKE to stream it all to the above-the-line team in Japan and across the world. Video assist has revolutionized the entire creative process! When I worked on Space Jam: New Legacy, we were getting the motion capture composites and overlaying them live over the actors. This allowed the director and actors to see the 3D cartoons playing basketball together in real time while filming. Conversely, while working on Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, we used entire rooms of 180° video walls where the set is placed inside the walls, and the walls change the imagery while rolling. This means a green screen and huge sets are no longer needed. The backgrounds are baked into the picture and look seamless on camera. Video assist has revolutionized the entire creative process!\n\nWhat we can do now is amazing, but it is additional work. With the new demands of technology and the current shooting culture of wanting to see a quasi-final concept of the finished product while shooting it, extra demands are being made in the video assist world. After recently being part of Local 695’s LED wall training at Stargate Studios and going through ROE Academy’s LED wall certification program, I realized that modern Video Engineers and Video Assist Operators need multiple skill sets comprised of many visual components. You need to understand camera processes, video editing, VFX workflows, color timing, and video engineering to get these walls working in the camera frame. The technology available continues to get more complex and our skill sets as Video Engineers have to grow along with it. Yet getting additional staffing on any given production can be like pulling teeth!\n\nOn a conceptual level, all of this isn’t that different from what Video Assist Operators have always traditionally done. We’ve always been responsible for recording all the video and reference audio signals, cataloging that media for later reference, and playing it back for all parties. It’s the massive scope of what this work entails that has grown in a huge way.\n\nVideo engineering is entering a new renaissance right now. It is a very complex visual field now in palette which you collaborate with directors and producers continually. Your computer is your palette and you assist the directors to create these new worlds instantly while recording. You will need to be more ingenious in order to succeed. All of this happens from your three little carts, on a film set wherever in the world you are, with your little wheels pushing around your long octopus cables, running like the wind to get it all plugged in, streamed, and working before the camera sets up. It’s a whole new exciting game out there now. This is the next level of what’s happening, where video engineering is headed and we are all very much needed on set to perform these duties.\n\nI’m certain the role of video assist will continue to change in the coming years. Evolving technology and innovative filmmaking practices will drive the importance of more Video Engineers working on set. I have no doubt that we’ll see more responsibility in the future and, as someone who loves her job, I’m looking forward to all the new ways that I’ll be able to contribute to the filmmaking process. Expanding the video department and integrating the Video Engineers working in this particular specialist field to that of creative director/collaborator is in my opinion needed to be made to set a precedent for us to follow. If you are working alongside directors, conceptualizing the shots with showrunners and needed to do on-the-spot edits for post production to follow the director’s instruction, you are in essence an integral part of the creative team. There are lots of new lines of creative work being done here. The video engineering and technical challenges that we experience on set currently are very demanding intellectually and creatively. You are often the right hand of any director. We are heavily relied on and support the entire crew with our streams now. By defining these new technology roles, this will potentially enlist more Local 695 positions, it adds a layer of quality to any project. There are truly no downsides to expanding the video assist engineering team. We sometimes are the video wizards who create a magic miracle from our carts. We are the troubleshooters, the fixers, and the quality checkers needed while in production. We are the one-two stop shoppe and backbone for production. Therefore, our value needs to be known. Long gone are the days of just pressing the record and playback buttons. Our technology is ever-expanding, increasing, and manning up our departments is the most financially responsible decision that a production can make! On any given day, we can catch errors that could cost production hundreds of thousands of dollars and ample headaches.\n\nOtherwise, how much time and money is one willing to lose by not having a proper video assist team here servicing the cast and crew, streamlining the creative process for all. Not delegating enough manpower and funding in this department to function fluidly, well … that my friend is a double-edged sword that cuts both ways.\n\nFew things have the power to unite people quite like organized sports. From the tense moments before the game starts to the final buzzer, the electrifying atmosphere of it captivates fans around the world. There is a palpable tension that hangs in the air as a ball sails through the air, only to shatter as the roaring cheer of the crowd erupts as a goal is scored. Everything from the players to the music to poorly made hot dogs creates an energetic camaraderie felt amongst strangers, bonded by their shared passion for the game. The experience of attending a game transcends mere entertainment. However, for those who cannot attend in person, there is the art of the sports television broadcast.\n\nI had the pleasure of sitting down with Local 695 member Antony Hurd, a Sports Broadcast Audio Mixer with a career spanning three decades.\n\nQ: Let’s start with learning a bit about you and how your career began.\n\nIt’s all who you know. My dad was a career man at CBS, and in the early ’80s said he could get me work in Rams pre-season football. It just wouldn’t be paid work. Immediately, I was on my way to Anaheim Stadium. I started out with the intention of being a camera operator, and it was a fluke that I was assigned to the sound department. Steve Kibbons was mixing, and Bob Tully was the A2.\n\nA few weeks after I started, Bob told me they needed an A2 at Video Tape Enterprises (VTE). He pitched me to them with “I know this kid who doesn’t know anything, but he’ll work hard.” They took a chance on me, and I was hired to work a Dodgers game with Carolyn Bowden, who was mixing. She told me to go set up the booth, but I was so green I didn’t know what she was talking about. Carolyn took me under her wing and walked me over and showed me how to set up a booth and taught me how to be an A2.\n\nWorking with them and building connections through my start with them has kept me working ever since.\n\nQ: Are you a member of any other unions?\n\nIn addition to being a Local 695 member, I am also a longtime card-carrying member of IBEW and NABET. The network the game airs on dictates which union the work falls under. If given a choice, I choose to work under 695 as our Local provides the best benefits of the three.\n\nQ: What has been the bulk of your work?\n\nWhen I was 19, I mixed my first show. I am now 59, so it’s been a long career. 99% of my career in that time has been in live sports. The other 1% was comprised of E red carpet events and shows.\n\nI’ve been working Lakers games for 40 years, starting as an A2 for the first few years, and then moving to mixing. The home games were on FSN, and the away games were on Kcal. I traveled with Sue Stratton and Kcal for 17 years. When Kcal Sports was discontinued, I was no longer on road games, but still did the home games. When Spectrum acquired the entire Lakers package of home and road games, I began doing all non-network exclusive Lakers games, both home and road. I believe this is my 25th NBA Finals. I also work on about one hundred baseball games a year. I have worked on eight Olympics, some World Series, Stanley Cup, etc.\n\nA few years back, I counted how many days I worked in the year, and it was three hunderd four. Now I work less and have slowed down.\n\nQ: Since you have also worked on the E Red Carpet, how do sports and broadcast differ?\n\nMy E experience was not in the studios, it was strictly on the red carpet. I think my sports background helped me in that environment. For example, for the Oscars, they would do a live from the red carpet show and a countdown show, which began airing approximately four hours before the Oscars started. Once the celebrities start arriving, it’s very “fly by the seat of your pants.” You may end up switching focus abruptly if someone more interesting shows up. My experience with switching quickly in sports helped my ability to do the E red carpet. I have also worked on the SAG Awards, Grammys, Emmys, and Golden Globes.\n\nQ: Gotcha. So what does a typical day look like for you?\n\nI’m a sports fan, so I really enjoy my job.\n\nWe arrive about six hours before the game time for regional sports. We don’t strike the truck every game. At Dodgers Stadium, everything stays plugged in and laid over for ten days. Now that they have the pitch clock, it’s much nicer because we have a better idea of how long we’ll be working. I’m told that on average across the league, the pitch clock has cut thirty minutes from the game.\n\nThe A2’s will set up the microphones and run the cables and set up the booth. When I get to the baseball game I’m doing tomorrow, I will plug in whatever cables I need to, and recall my setup at my console. On the first day of the season, I build my console from scratch. One of the biggest difficulties about working in sports now is all of the commercial signage. All the processing is slow, so we have to delay the audio to match the video. An example is when we switch from camera four (pitcher/batter from centerfield), to camera two, the delays have to change. The guys at Sunday Night Baseball told me they have eight different delays depending on which camera is online. It’s a nightmare. If the system malfunctions, the bat crack sounds like a machine gun.\n\nQ: Do those delays stay consistent, or does it vary by game?\n\nIt stays fairly consistent within each stadium. It does vary by stadium. For example, the pitch cast at Dodgers Stadium is six frames, and at Anaheim Stadium it’s seven frames.\n\nQ: Are there issues or challenges that arise in the sports area that don’t pop up in other areas of Local 695 work?\n\nWe have 20,000-30,000 screaming fans that we have to consider. We often choose consistency over quality. If you hear the bat crack or the ball swish through the net or the announcers, we’ve done our jobs. We mount Sony ECM-77’s on a pad under the rim of the basket. We also have directional microphones, usually Sennheiser 416’s. Those point at the keys. We have seven stationary mics in basketball.\n\nQ: Typically, how many mics or audio feeds are you managing at any given time?\n\nIt’s generally about twenty mics for each sporting event. Golf has more, at about 6-7 mics per hole. For NBA Finals, we have extra effects mics. The amount of mics can vary a lot depending on the sport and venue. Tennis is probably my favorite sport to mix because the crowd is quiet. When covid started, they pumped in fake noise to make up for the lack of crowds, which I thought was ridiculous. It didn’t make sense to me; I thought it was great that we could hear everything. Then we were on a conference call with Major League Baseball, and they pointed out that with no crowd noise, you can now hear the catcher shift, which before the batter and pitcher wouldn’t be able to hear. So there’s a lot to consider about the sound.\n\nFor baseball, we’re now in stereo and we have about fifteen effects mics on the field for a regional game. I have three talent mics and I manage those and the fifteen effects mics the whole game. I have a 64-input board that is always being used.\n\nQ: How has sports broadcast work changed over the course of your career?\n\nThe analog-to-digital shift was huge. Also, audio has become more important over the years. When I started forty years ago, we only had one Bat Crack mic and one crowd mic in baseball, and now we have twenty mics on the field.\n\nIf you watch USFL or XFL, you will see everyone is wearing a microphone now. I haven’t worked on those, but it seems like a lot is happening at once. Sound being more important has definitely improved the end product.\n\nQ: How was the transition from analog to digital for you?\n\nI’m not great with technology, so for me personally, it was a difficult transition. I was lucky because Calrec, which is the main company that provides the consoles for sports, made its first digital deck look like its analog deck. When Yamaha went from analog to digital, it was totally different and was a difficult learning curve.\n\nQ: What teams are you most proud to have worked with?\n\nThe Lakers, by far. Traveling with the team on the team charter one hundred thousand miles a year is the only way to travel. I’m in a hotel about 100-120 days a year for my road games across the various sports. Traveling with the Lakers lets me stay in some pretty nice hotels.\n\nQ: That’s fun. Any interesting travel stories?\n\nYears and years ago, I was on a plane when we hit a sudden air pocket. I was asleep and woke up held down by my seat belt, but with my arms and legs in the air. Chick Hearn announced that we’d dropped ten thousand feet.\n\nWhen I worked on the Olympics in France, I had several days off that I was paid for, and I was just able to spend the time skiing.\n\nQ: Have you formed friendships with any of the players?\n\nI don’t know if I would say friendships, but I do have a picture of myself and Kobe Bryant playing Ping-Pong on Thanksgiving in Detroit. Any time we’re on the road for a holiday, the team usually does something. This time, they weren’t going to do anything, so Kobe said he would. He rented out the banquet hall at the Townsend Hotel in Birmingham, Michigan. He got a bunch of TV’s and the Ping-Pong table, and catered the whole thing. Kobe was very approachable. I also have a picture of him with my nephew’s Flat Stanley.\n\nQ: How do the Olympics differ from other sporting events?\n\nHauling cable up a snowy mountain is hard work! Overall, everything is just a much larger scale. It’s about two weeks of setup, and two weeks of the Olympics, so it’s approximately a month-long gig. When I worked for CBS mixing the freestyle skiing, the downhill kept being delayed due to the snow, so our team had to scramble to adjust our schedule and workflow so the network had enough content to make the day.\n\nQ: Any career advice for someone who wants to enter the sports world?\n\nBe computer-savvy. Everything is moving toward Dante at this point, so that’s an important skill to have. It’s almost more important than being able to mix the game. If you want to be a sports mixer, picture yourself as a fan and imagine what you want to hear watching the game. Though my best advice is: run for your life. Only a crazy person does this for a living.\n\nI’d like to thank Antony for his time and for sharing the benefit of his experiences with us for this publication. His work and the work of so many members like him help to connect sports fans across the globe with their games, their teams, and fellow fans. Learning a little bit about the behind the scenes of the process will definitely change how I look at a game the next time I have one on and I hope the same is true for anyone reading.\n\nby Brandon Loulias\n\nI’ve spent most of my adult life working on film sets; from the Wild West of nonunion indie movies to long-form narrative films and TV. It was a great way to collect experience. I also observed a common duality for most of us on regular shows: long hours, unpredictable wrap times, exhaustion, etc. Once the pandemic hit, it gave us an opportunity to reframe our lives and what we feel is important. I learned there are more things in life than living on a film set. This was a major shift for me, as I had never put a priority on my personal life. I took that time to reconfigure. The variety of work I’d get called for expanded vastly, from primarily narrative work to about ten different styles of sound work on large-scale productions with varying complexities. My post-sound career rekindled as well, which has always been a part of my life and I’ve always kept a mixing room wherever I’ve been for the past twenty years. These days, many of us don’t get the chance to choose the type of work we do. We either take the job, or someone else will and who knows when the next one will come. Regardless of the job requirements, I show up and solve problems, like any of us. I enjoy working in all the different disciplines under and around our little umbrella, albeit sometimes exhausting.\n\nMost of my career has been by the seat of my pants, with gear manuals and internet access keeping me honest and employed since I was a kid. I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t know everything and never will. That’s the joy of this line of work for me. I’m a lifelong student of the crafts and the people around me as long as there’s something new to learn. Our employment depends on relationships, and good gear allows you to be with people instead of all the toys. The point of our equipment is to get it out of the way and be present for the process.\n\nOnce upon a time, a sound person could choose a particular discipline and stay within that classification for an entire career if they chose to do so. Things have changed a bit, and now many of our members will take what they can get in any classification. When I got into the union, my intention was to keep mixing. Alas, I was 6’7” and in my twenties, so they gave me a boom pole instead. Booming taught me to navigate and collaborate with other departments, which is vital to achieving a great soundtrack and a positive work environment. Coincidentally, I had to give up booming for health reasons, which has led me to be more dynamic in my skill sets to stay busy.\n\nOne thing I love about day playing is the ability to bounce between different workflows and avoid complacency with a particular job. The downside is having to pivot on a dime and sometimes even wearing different hats with variable complexity for each day of the week. There’s also the turnaround issue; like having a split-call mixing job that goes late one day, and an early call on a playback job with a completely different gear package the following morning. Most of the time, we just have to tough it out and be exhausted, as we may not have another job for a long time.\n\nA double-edged sword of working in many disciplines is the need for multiple rigs that do multiple things. I believe in being prepared but will only purchase things out of necessity. Otherwise, we’ll just get into a loop of buying gear to make money to buy gear, which is a dangerous game I’ve been playing for most of my life.\n\nI look at all jobs like a math equation; the problem is what the job requires, and the solution is something we provide through technology and skillful planning. Here are a few examples of problems I’ve encountered in the past few years, and what solutions I devised as a result. A huge benefactor in audio solutions these days is how technology has evolved. I am ever-so-grateful for many of the audio-over-IP solutions that I can rely on for all the mission-critical applications.\n\nThen of course, the most important parts, like batteries and wheels.\n\nMusic Recording and Pro Tools Playback on Movies and TV\n\nThere’s been an increasing demand for recording live music on movies and TV, and I happen to get a lot of those calls lately. Here’s how I handle them:\n\nI ask for a tech rider, which gives me all the info like track lists, instruments, IEM requirements, mic choices, etc. I contact props and set dec, who are most likely already in touch with the stage and equipment companies, to determine who’s supplying the backline, stage tech, etc. A lot of the time, those companies will also provide additional workforce such as FOH mixers, A2’s, System Techs, etc. I always advocate getting additional A2 labor through Local 695 if we’re short on hands. I also like to have Pro Tools playback and band recording as two separate people if possible and the situation calls for it, although sometimes it has to be one. I have modular rigs that can accommodate both workflows via AES50 and Dante interchangeably. The flexibility of those interfaces gives me lots of options in various situations, and the Midas ecosystem is excellent for accommodating demanding and ever-changing workflows. I still use the good old Sound Devices 970 for large track counts, the Midas M32R & M32C mixers, and DL16 & DL32 stage boxes. Moving forward toward the shoot, I always ask for a rehearsal/pre-record day, if we can. It’s really nice when we can focus on recording with the artist on a click track, dial in IEM’s, and get a few clean takes without the hassle of “getting this next shot before lunch.”\n\nI worked on Yellowstone S5 for a minute, where there was a frequent need for live-music recordings throughout the season. I put the bat signal out to production about needing to connect with the backline company, and they hooked me up with Alex Bruce from Montana Pro Audio, who was an absolute champion about it. He and his team built the stage and got the instruments, and we combined our mic collections to facilitate the needs of recording for all the bands.\n\nI had to revise my system after the first round, as we were spread out on a ranch with a thumper for four hundred cowboys, and the band was in a tent with about five cameras floating around the premises. I returned with a smaller rig to do it all quickly and lightly. The coolest part is the mixer being able to jump between Midas and Pro Tools control at the push of a button, which proved extremely handy when recording thirty-two isos to play back on a dime against a thump with immediate turnover. I had a previous commitment, so my friend Nick Ronzio stepped in and finished the season on my rig. All went smoothly. A perfect reminder that simplicity, even with great technology, is sometimes the best choice.\n\nLive Broadcast Mixing for Justin Bieber’s Virtual Concert with Unreal Engine for WAVE\n\nI was hired to create a sound ecosystem for live broadcast motion-capture virtual concerts using Unreal Engine and various DAW’s. This is how we did it:\n\nThe problem we faced was a live concert in real-time with Justin Bieber in a motion- and face-capture suit driving an avatar in Unreal Engine. This was broadcast to millions of viewers. The solution was a lot of rehearsals, MIDI cue points, math equations, and headaches. I built a system that can drive Unreal Engine from Pro Tools through MIDI, LTC timecode, and GPIO. This information was generated by Pro Tools with stems for monitoring, as well as crowd interaction and FX triggering via Ableton Live.\n\nIt all interfaced with Unreal and the BTS camera for live picture-in-picture, and everything was in tri-level sync feeding a TriCaster.\n\nSome of the issues we faced in this process were calibrating the synchronization between various peripherals, even down to house sync and black burst. The face motion capture was about 23ms offset from body capture, which had to be ironed out by employing certain system delays. This also meant we needed to delay the audio by 384ms while still having the music in real-time for Bieber to perform. It ended up requiring a lot of different bussing and variable delays, including audio reactivity, which altered the lighting and graphics in the Unreal universe according to music intensity.\n\nWe developed a method for global sync calibration, where a technician wore the suit while moving to the beat and counted out loud so we could line up the body, face, and audio for all moving parts. We ran it for the duration of the concert to verify any detectable drift and cross-checked it with a 2-pop at the beginning and end of the show. All interconnects for our department were done using Dante and NDI on four computers. We had two identical Pro Tools HDX systems—one for playback and one for mixing. The other two computers were for systems management and crowd/FX triggers via Ableton. We controlled everything with two Avid S3’s, interfaced with Focusrite Red 8Pre’s, and recorded the whole thing on the good old Sound Devices 970. The result was music playback driving all visual cues and scenes within Unreal Engine while Bieber wore the suit to drive his avatar in that world. I got to work with one of my childhood best friends on this one, Will Thoren. This job was technologically ambitious and great to share together. It was also a good lesson in staying organized when it’s necessary to go big with our rigs.\n\nDolby Atmos Comedy Show in Dane Cook’s Backyard\n\nLately, I’ve been working in the niche circuit of live comedy, and we have a system for turning over Atmos-deliverable recordings. Here’s how:\n\nMy friend Thomas Cassetta does quite a lot of this work, and we usually do a lot of the production and post-sound on these together. On this one, I was the Production Mixer and Supervising Sound Editor, and he was the Re-recording Mixer. I’ve always found it to be an informative process to do both. Tom is a stellar colleague, and a pleasure to work with.\n\nOn live comedy, we like to use the Midas M32/970 workflow and boom recorder as backup. I’ve had a lot of success with those machines for higher track counts where you can’t have anything fail and millions of people are watching. Live comedy is a similar idea. My rig for this is fairly basic and the workload generally goes into hanging mics. On the Dane Cook special, we had to pull many stops as he wanted to do the special in an unusual place—his backyard. His house was in the Hollywood Hills, so loading in and logistics were an absolute nightmare for all involved. Luckily, he owned the house across the street as well, so we ran our base of operations from there over fiber on a crossover.\n\nMy main challenge was getting a full-sized LCR line array PA system to Dane’s top balcony while I was three stories down in his garage recording and mixing. Another thing was wind protection for twenty-six crowd mics. We rigged a combination of wired and wireless mics, hanging in spaced pairs along the perimeter, and an Ambisonic mic from above. We had the post contract on this, so any mess we made was ours to clean up. The game is to get full-bodied crowd sounds with all mics in sync and to run the PA quietly to give you enough separation in post for control. We had a Shure Axient System for his handhelds and Midas DL32 on the side of the stage, feeding into a Midas M32 at the FOH mix position via AES50. We daisy-chained the FOH to me downstairs in the garage on my Midas M32R into three backup recorders via Dante. This was a cool configuration as I could set the master trim and preamp controls from my mixer, and my FOH guy could do trims and such upstairs.\n\nOne thing I love about comedy stuff is prep days; you’d never see that on a film set. It’s also been a real pleasure meeting the other factions of A2’s and comms people who are 695 members—usually, we’d never cross paths. They are\n\nhighly intelligent, great to work with, and quite skilled. This gig showed me the importance of offline technical prep so that life can be easier on the day.\n\nPro Tools Playback Motion Control Workflow: The Flight Attendant S2\n\nI first got the call for The Flight Attendant to solve a tech issue. They wanted to “parent-trap,” which is where you have one actor play many characters in the same shot. Here’s how:\n\nWe stacked Kaley Cuoco’s performances in QTAKE, and by the time we wrapped the scene, had a complete sequence. They were all layered in on a VFX comp, with only her dialog heard from each performance. This was important for VFX as some of the scenes had to have perfect eyelines, throw stacks of paper, high fives, etc. The dialog timing had to be on point as it would motivate the moves, and there needed to be enough of a gap for each line, otherwise, it would throw her off.\n\nThis required a repeatable scene. My system would drive six or more peripherals that employed motion control for the camera, QTAKE auto-record and layering, DMX lighting cues, and sound FX on the Pro Tools timeline. I decided to run it with record-run timecode via an Avid Sync HD, and I’d record the isos over Dante into Pro Tools HDX and on a 970. I chose LTC over GPIO to drive this, given the nature of linear time frames of each scene—hitting cues at certain intervals for FX, actions, light, and not to mention the flow of dialog. GPIO had only basic transport functions, and LTC allowed me to adjust things in my repeatable timeline. Each segment would start at 00:59:56:00 so as to give everything enough time to catch sync.\n\nWe wired everyone, including the photo doubles, who ran lines to hold space for when Cuoco was to do those character’s performances. I ran a Dante feed from the production mixer’s rig so I could get anything I wanted over that line, including the mix and all isos. I would roll when they called action, kicking the LTC off, which would trigger QTAKE to roll four cameras, the bloop light for Moco would hit at 01:00:00:00, our AD would call out “three … two … one … action,” then they’d do the scene. We wrote motion control, focus racks, DMX lighting cues, and any other chronological scene information against my LTC stripe on all moving parts, recording all data. If we wanted another one, we’d have to write it all again based on the linear requirements of the scenes. After we got a keeper-take, we would then call that the base on which we would build. I would mark that in my session, then figure out which character would go next. I would clean up the dialog on the fly with iZotope and cut out photo double lines of the character she chose to play next, so she could perform it. Sometimes we’d rehearse while she was getting wired, and she would read her next character’s lines against the other lines to practice timing. I’d also retain the verbal “three … two … one” cue, although it was archaic, as it served the purpose of cueing everyone on the exact same start mark each time for the scene.\n\nWe had to drive QTAKE’s initial “keeper-take” to play back in sync with the new one and print both into a new VFX comp track. We were effectively “stacking” performances, similar to a sequencer or multitracking in a DAW. I also would run my updated dialog edit into the mixer’s board, so it would always represent the most recent dialog comp for VTR overlays. Sometimes, I’d cue three beeps to help give her a start mark if her character didn’t start the scene or if she needed a cue for action. This was a constant process throughout the season, requiring all departments’ collaboration. It was great practice in how to translate weirdly complex situations to others in a palatable fashion.\n\nTo Leslie: Good Old-Fashioned Filmmaking\n\nTo Leslie was a special experience for me and a total relief from all the other deeply technological jobs I had gotten myself into. Shot single-camera on film, this job was fun because it wasn’t about big tough problem-solving or new fancy wireless gear; it was about the relationships and organic processes of capturing great performances. It was classical filmmaking. Our Director, Michael Morris, was an absolute joy to collaborate with. From the beginning, we discussed the music as it was important in this film. He left me in charge of the jukebox, and I was always ready whenever he wanted something for needle-drop or otherwise. It was very enjoyable to delve into the “outlaw country” discography and learn about a style of music I hadn’t been entirely familiar with. Some songs helped convey feelings and underlying subtexts in particular circumstances. While other times, it was about creating the right vibe.\n\nThen there was Andrea Riseborough, who immediately caught me off guard and blew me away with her performance from day one. It was amazing to witness this powerhouse of a character, which shook most of us to the core. She had incredible dynamics, and keeping up with that was quite a task at times. Luckily, I had a killer crew of Johnny Kubelka as Boom Operator, and Dan Kelly as Utility. It was a real treat to have them both, Swiss Army knife-generation sound guys who have worked in many disciplines as well. We shot all over L.A. and out in the desert, all on location. It truly reminded me of the good old independent film days that felt like summer camp. Just filmmakers having fun.\n\nNo matter the application, it’s safe to say that our job requirements are evolving, and so are we. The amount of gear we have to keep is staggeringly more than ever, and we have to support each other to keep our rates up to accommodate for that. The gear is there to supplement our solutions, not to define us or our workflow. It doesn’t matter if you use Shure or Lectro, Zaxcom, Sound Devices, Cantar, Sonosax or Zoom—what matters is that we know how to use our equipment and adapt to the ever-changing landscape. A mixer’s gear loadout is reminiscent of their mind and what makes sense to them. We mustn’t forget the purpose of the gear is to get it out of the way and don’t forget to step away and live life.\n\nBehind the Video Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nby Dan Moore\n\nBeing a Video Engineer can be a lonely position on set. On occasion, like a Script Supervisor, you can convince production that additional help is needed because of added cameras, multiple location moves, or cameras that will leapfrog from set to set. Having more support is often the exception and not the rule. However, on Avatar: The Way of Water, with four and sometimes five stages in operation at Manhattan Beach Studios (MBS), quite often three to five operators were employed with some days reaching as many as eleven. With complicated setups and prepping upcoming scenes, planning and coordinating personnel was essential in making this project a success. This started in 2005, when the technical planning and pipeline development began for the first Avatar film.\n\nThe pipeline is the process by which all departments contribute their specific function to a main storage center, which then disseminates and organizes large volumes of information. The information being ‘bits of data.’ These digital files are cleaned up and sent to the visual effects house and other departments to use. In 2005, many were responsible for the development of the pipeline, including members from Local 695. Glenn Derry was a principal developer, supported by Gary Martinez and Mike Davis. Both had the creative talent, the engineering expertise, and field experience to build a pipeline that worked. Later in 2012, Ryan Champney, the Virtual Production Supervisor at Lightstorm Entertainment, continued to improve and streamline this pipeline. He was able to make rapid changes to the overall system and personalize it for different departments. For example, writing custom software for the automated publishing and metadata tagging of the audio, video, facial, and performance-capture datasets. This overwhelming task resided with these principal technicians, whose degrees in computer science, electrical, and mechanical engineering supported the groundbreaking work. I enjoyed observing and learning from skilled engineers overcoming complex challenges for this project.\n\nTo walk onto the set of Avatar would be deceiving and underwhelming because of its warehouse-like appearance. This is not a traditional film set like those constructed by carpenters, painters, and set designers, to then be populated later with stylized lighting and filmed with traditional cameras.\n\nOn one side of the stage are two raised platforms, which look like old-style TV phone banks. In this case, the phones and staff are replaced with computer workstations and technicians. Each station is responsible for different aspects of the show. These raised platforms, called the Brain Bar, are workstations for head rigs, QTAKE, RealTime, take assets, script, stunts, and the Editorial Department.\n\nOn Stage 27, in front of the Brain Bar, was the Volume that measured 120’ x 75’. The Volume is where the action sequences were recorded. The Volume was surrounded by one hundred eighty infrared cameras, suspended from the ceiling, casting IR light over the entire defined space. These cameras, which are calibrated for accuracy every morning, track the actors’ movements within the Volume. It also tracks a ‘virtual camera’ and the props for those action sequences. The actors wore black suits with reflective spherical markers on them that the IR cameras followed. When looking at a RealTime monitor of the Volume, the performers and the characters they were playing could be seen walking around in a 3-D field. The virtual camera, which put a frame and lens around the image, provided the visual background, creating the location and characters for the scene. On each stage, four 65” OLED monitors were placed around the Volume, and thirty smaller monitors at each workstation, showing the Avatar facial and body movements, as well as the scenery of this imaginative world. Instantaneously, the scene became a close approximation of what it would look like in the theater. Not photo-realistic, but close.\n\nAdditionally, within this crowded Volume, up to sixteen live Sony cameras were positioned to capture close-ups of the actors’ facial expressions and movements. This allowed the director to see the detailed performances of the actors and know what takes ‘to circle.’ These directors’ video notes of the articulation of the actors’ expressions helped to make references for final photo-realistic digital images done later. These movements, along with sound and video, were all digitally recorded in a massive, air-conditioned server room that accommodated several petabytes of storage.\n\nWhere does the Video Assist Operator fit into a project like Avatar? My primary function was to record the virtual image along with a 16-camera matrix that would be displayed on the monitors. The recording stations became stationary after hundreds of miles of Canare Belden BNC, and fiber-optic cable were laid to create the pathways. Hardware equipment from Evertz, Blackmagic Design, Decimator Design, Panasonic, and Sony were used in the build-out. Much of the equipment was sourced from B&H Photo and Adorama Camera. Production did source equipment locally, as well through Band Pro Film & Digital in Burbank. Air-conditioning, backup power supplies, and racks of digital storage units were in place before the first day of filming. In addition to the build-out, solar panels were placed on top of all stages, to cut down on the electric bill and all water used in the film tanks were delivered to the golf course right next to the MBS stages.\n\nOn the first Avatar film in 2005, the production used video assist Playback Technology devices to record the virtual camera and three-quarter-inch tape decks to record the live-action cameras. In 2015, Avatar: The Way of Water production used the QTAKE system to record the virtual camera and a matrix of the sixteen live cameras. In addition, the individual live cameras were recorded on AJA recorders and uploaded onto the digital server after each take. The matrix image for the video assist came from a Blackmagic MultiView 16 device. As a criteria, all devices had to have the capability to be remotely software controlled so that the media was properly named and published on roll and cut.\n\nThe Video Assist Operator was also responsible for troubleshooting and the overall reliability of the pipeline. Making sure that the sixteen live-action cameras, head rigs, and other departments had proper timecode, as well as tri-level sync and other reference outputs. All the workstations, about twenty in total, each had a monitor for live and playback images. The Video Assist Operator was also responsible for transmitting the images to the QTAKE workstations and to the Camera Department monitors for focus.\n\nIn June 2016, I was employed once again on Avatar to head and coordinate the Video Department. The build-out of the pipeline was almost complete. I assisted both Ryan and Gary to help finish and get ready to film Avatar 2 and 3. At this point, I needed to assemble a group of Video Engineers who would be able to work on this project at various times. I scheduled personnel who were able to commit to the show and maintain their own client base. I knew a few operators but needed to find more. Within a few weeks, I was able to assemble twenty-five video operators that I could schedule at any given time. As the show progressed, the Director and Virtual Camera Operators would sometimes have a preference and would want to be paired with Video Assist Operators who were suited for them. The operators came from all different backgrounds, which included features, commercials, and live TV. Their technical ability varied as well. From basic QTAKE functions to a variety of problem-solving issues, every day had different challenges. Some operators expressed that the pressure of working with the director would be too tense. In this case, the Director was James Cameron. For Mr. Cameron, you need to be always ‘on,’ anticipate what he might need, and be able to technically answer his questions. Like Mr. Spielberg, he demands an A team of professionals. Surprisingly, Video Operators that came from live TV were able to handle the most stress in terms of personalities and technical issues. In the end, our Local was able to provide the most experienced and proficient technicians.\n\nAll the Video Assist Operators were able to bring their talents to this otherworldly film. I would like to congratulate the following operators, and their contributions to the success of Avatar: The Way of Water.\n\nShahrouz (Shawn) Nooshinfar: From Tehran, Iran, Shawn had been employed by several Persian and Armenian broadcast channels serving as an Uplink Engineer and Technical Director. He is also fluent in Farsi, German, and English, making him in demand at other international broadcast stations. He was brought on Anchorman 2 as a Technical Advisor and Engineer in 2011 and joined the union in 2012. He has worked as the lead media server and LED Engineer on Dr. Phil and other live TV events. On Avatar, he handled the biggest technical challenges with ease and confidence. He is one of the principal owners of Lightning LED, which specializes in video walls, media servers, and video assist. His company is a QTAKE distributor and technical support center.\n\nJeb Johenning: From Lexington, VA, was employed by Strata Flotation in 1988 and was responsible for the in-house video productions of their product, which was being distributed nationally. He also served as an Industrial Designer and had twelve US patents on different products he designed. Jeb has been a Local 695 member since 1994 and established his company Ocean Video in 1993. His company is one of the few companies that is a worldwide premier agent/dealer for the QTAKE system, which builds carts and provides technical support. His role on Avatar was more behind the scenes, providing support and perfecting the build-out of QTAKE streaming. This allowed all five stages to be interconnected and view takes filmed on different stages. This was a secure and quick way for the director to comment on the work of others.\n\nDan Moore: From Chicago, IL, graduated from college in 1983, and trained as a Video Assist Operator with Cogswell Video Services in 1984, one of the first video assist companies. Steve Cogswell trained many Video Assist Operators and made an impact on how video assist is used on set today that includes a sense of organization and the consistent use of quality equipment. Besides managing the operations on the set of Avatar, Dan worked with Ryan Champney in setting up and dismantling the video infrastructure for all the performance-capture volumes. All cables used for video, timecode, tri-level sync, word clock, data, and even the cable’s length had to be color-coded and incorporated onto the stages. With thousands of connections going in so many directions, this made the ability to problem solve much easier. Dan is currently the owner of Video Hawks LLC.\n\nEduardo Eguia: From San Luis Potosi, Mexico, moved to Mexico City in 1995 to work at the Broadcast Televisa Studios as an Editor and Post-production Engineer. He moved to the US in 1998 and in 2010 joined the union. Working as a Video Operator on Avatar, Eduardo was also responsible for building the QTAKE systems and other recording and editorial carts for the 3-story tank on Stage 18 at Manhattan Beach Studios, as well as all the carts for New Zealand. This turned into a blessing for production, since once the carts were completed, COVID shut down the Los Angeles operations which later resumed in New Zealand with the carts that Eduardo built. With the help of Roly Arenas, Storm Flejter, Ernesto Joven, and Peter Joyce, a total of twenty carts were assembled and used in production.\n\nRoly Arenas: From Havana, Cuba, graduated from the University of Computer Science Havana as a Software Engineer. He worked in Havana as Graphic Artist and Video Engineer at Canal Havana Broadcast Studios and moved to the United States in 2010. He was hired as an Editor for the Caribbean Broadcasting Company in 2016 and joined the union in 2018. He worked on Avatar building carts and working as a Video Assist Operator.\n\nMike Pickel: From Dallas, Texas, graduated from University of Texas, Austin, with a degree in film. The same year, he moved to Los Angeles to work at Paramount Pictures as a Production Assistant and then transferred to Michael Bay’s company, Propaganda Films. There he worked as a PA and then later as a Video Assist Operator on commercial projects. He became a union member in 1995. Sadly, Mike passed away from cancer in 2018 during the filming. He was one of the first Video Assist Operators to work on Avatar: The Way of Water when production commenced. His presence, humor, and talents were greatly missed.\n\nSo many other Video Engineers from our Local were involved and instrumental in making Avatar: The Way of Water a success. They include Andrew Rozendal, Alex Sethian, R. Scott Lawrence, Joe Kroll, Justin Geoffroy, Ben Betts, Peter Joyce, David Santos, Storm Flejter, Ernesto Joven, and several others. Our Local came through with skilled Video Assist Operators who worked together and challenged that singular often lonely position we all have been accustomed to performing, merging our creativity for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nby Blas Kisic\n\nI remember the phone call very well—a producer I’ve known for years, Matthew McIntyre, was on the other end. He got straight to the point, “Blas, have you ever done a hidden-camera show?”\n\nIndeed, I’d worked on a few. They were typically in a contained space, and lasted a few hours at the most. I came to realize a few weeks later, when it was too late to back out of the job, that my notion of a “hidden-camera show” and the project Matt was asking me about were two very different"
