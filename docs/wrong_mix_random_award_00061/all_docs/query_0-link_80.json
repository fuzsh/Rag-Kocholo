        "text": "This is my 4th Rexing dash camera, I currently have 3 still running in vehicles one of which just turned 4 years old. As always Rexing’s build quality is great, no complaints.\n\nInstallation of the front camera is straight forward if you want a dangling wire. Installing the back camera, unless you know what you are doing, can be quite troublesome. You need to know which trim pieces to pull and where you can hide the wire from the back to the front. Took me about 15 minutes but this is not my first time I have wired a back camera in this car.\n\nThe quality is not bad, on the contrary it is quite good compared to my 1080p camera, but it does not look like true 4k. The resolution is there but the quality seems a little lackluster. I would love you know what sensor they have in this camera but I cannot find a spec sheet anywhere.\n\nPrice is maybe slightly higher than it should be based on some of the other premium brand dash cameras.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints, and this is a minor one, is the lack of USB plug in the 12v charger. Cheaper Rexing cameras have this but for some reason one of their more expensive cameras does not.\n\nAlso, Rexing, PLEASE remove the image of ÒRexingÓ at the bottom of the recordings and go back to the text of ÒREXING DASH CAMÓ.\n\nThis is replacing a V1LG Rexing camera in a 2019 Mustang.\n\nUHD front FHD rear camera much better video quality upgraded rear camera design.\n\nRear camera one complaint adjuster is plastic clicking is loose in some areas, tighter in others. Meaning rear camera swivels 360¡ to adjust to a vertical or a sloped windshield. When adjusting to a vertical windshield camera mount is loose cannot adjust or tighten camera in anyway! When in a sloped windshield position camera is more stable, could be a defect or a design flaw.\n\nNow, with this 33497 Front cigarette lighter power cord is not long enough if youÕre going to put it in a F-150 through F-450 and hide the wire being tucked in and hidden completely. This cord on 33497 is same length as a V1P Max 4K and the V1P Pro Rexing cameras. Have both installed in my 2020 F-350 Limited came up about 4 feet short of cable. This camera 33497 Will do the same thing. There is no cable extension that Rexing makes to extend power from cigarette lighter to camera! Would be nice if they made a 6 foot extension cable that is compatible with the cameras power. Tried using cables to extend power off Amazon most of them are not compatible. The only other option is to hardwire to your fuse box using the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nRear camera cable is 18/20 feet long plenty of length for a car or truck no shortage of cable for rear camera power/Record wire.\n\nAll in all nice new packaging, good design front camera. Could do better on rear camera design!\n\nThis is my review of the Rexing 33497 dashcam that I have used for 3 weeks.\n\nEverything in the box was packaged very well and no missing components. The initial setup was very straight forward. There are two bases to mount the front camera to your windshield along with 3m tape to ensure it wonÕt come off. I also liked that they included several small clips that allowed me to hide the wire better without the risk of them dropping down. I used the cigarette lighter adapter at first but wanted a more permanent setup so I opted for the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nWhat I really liked:\n\n– I have a large SUV (Cadillac Escalade ESV). I was worried that the cable for the rear camera would not be long enough for me to mount to my rear windshield. Not only did it reach but I still had slack left over.\n\n– The ease of use: Once you have it connected it automatically turns on and records. The time/date was set automatically and if I want to export video to my phone I just go into the menu and turn the wifi on.\n\n– The GPS feature is cool. When I watched some of the play back it had my location and speed embedded into the video for both the front and rear camera.\n\n– I recorded at the highest quality and video/audio playback was crystal clear. I purchased their recommended 64GB SD so space will not be an issue.\n\n– When connected to WiFi you can video live video from the dashcam on your phone. This was helpful when trying to get the camera placement just right.\n\nWhat could use improvement:\n\n– When transferring video via WiFi it is a bit slow. Since I am recording at the highest quality the files can be around 50MB real and 200-300MB for the front camera. When trying to transfer files that are larger in size it would often give me an error and not transfer. This is not really a big concern because if something did happen, I would just take the card out and download it to my computer.\n\n– It would be nice if WiFi could also be enabled full time vs having to turn it on when you want to use it.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a solid dashcam you can not go wrong with this purchase. Their tech support is also great, and you talk to a human not a robot.\n\nHave been a Rexing customer for several years now. Currently have 4 Rexing dash cameras installed in the family cars. Having two teenage drivers, its almost a must for any accidents that they may get into.\n\nHaving video prove that the accident was not your fault will pay for the cost of the camera and your piece of mind. Let alone the family drama if it was one of your kids that was in the accident.\n\nPrime example. My daughter was side swiped. The other driver lied to the officers at the scene and claimed my daughter had run a red light. My daughter kept her cool because she knew she had the video prove to back up her side of the story. Video recording proved that she did not run the red light and the other driver was at fault.\n\nInstall:\n\nInstall was straight forward for me since I was replacing an existing unit. Rexing does supply you with the good 3M black mounting adhesive. Compared to other companies that use a lesser quality mounting tape. Do leave a little room for the camera to slide off just in case you need to remove it sometime in the future. You may also want to hide it a little bit behind your rear-view mirror. In case you have the tendency to be looking at the camera screen while driving.\n\nHiding the wiring is the hardest part. Just take your time and hide the wires behind any interior trim. If you have any side air bags. I would recommend that you disconnect your battery prior to sticking any wires around the air bag trim pieces. You donÕt want the air bag to accidently go off. The rear camera cabling is long enough for an extended wheelbase vehicle. You should have enough cable to route around the air bag trim if you like, depending on your vehicle. I do prefer the older cable management tool that was included in previous versions. The new one to me is a little small.\n\nOperation:\n\nThe User Manual has been updated with more illustrations and covers setting up and operation. This is a welcome feature since most companies have forced you to go online for even a basic User Manual.\n\nThe 4K upgrade from previous models is a welcomed feature and the night vision is crisp and clear. The extra detail in the video image will be a benefit if you need to provide video playback. Due to the increased video quality and having a video file for the front and rear camera. You may want to consider going with a larger, up to the 256GB micro-SD card. Depending on how many videos you want to retain before they are over written. The built in GPS and speed monitoring are a great add-in feature for additional details for your accident report or in case you must prove you were not speeding. The included rear camera is a must have and is nice that it is included in this model. Front and rear camera adjustment allows you to adjust the camera for the best possible image. Depending on where it is located and if you have the available cigarette lighter socket available. You might want to think about the hardwire kit if you are planning on leveraging the parking monitor. It will take a little more work for its installation since it ties directly into your interior fuse panel. But it will free up the cigarette lighter socket and you or your kid wont figure to plug it in. If you are experiencing any issues with the Wi-Fi connection. Be sure to turn off your Wireless Data and that should address your connection issue.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs always, a great dash camera from Rexing with improved features over previous models. Well worth the upgrade.\n\nMy Review of the Rexing 33497\n\nWith all itÕs short comings, IÕm giving it four out of five stars and IÕd still buy another. This is the second REXING dash cam I have purchased. Overall well built, fairly easy to install and get started. I like having a rear camera. You will need to purchase a High Endurance SD card for the unit. I purchased a 256GB which is more than enough – especially given the camera does loop recording. Installation of the rear camera was a breeze but I couldnÕt place in the center of the rear window because my F150 has a sliding rear window and heated glass so placement was as close to center as I could avoiding the sliding window as well as the window heating lines. Still, my position offers a good view of the rear of the vehicle . I still have problems understanding how to activate some of the features. For instance, it took me some time to figure out how to switch from rear camera to front camera because the owners manual only says ÒScreen buttonÓ. Adding a little more definition like ÒFront to Rear CameraÓ would have offered more clarity. The front camera is low profile and hardly noticeable when placed near the rear view mirror out of driverÕs line of sight. One thing that is annoying, however, is the front camera picks up reflection glare of the dash that you can see in the videos. I wish there was a polarizing filter that could be added to avoid this Nevertheless, if you can deal with that, the images are still bright and clear. Like my first REXING, the little screen is basically useless and difficult to watch if thatÕs your intent. Given its slanted, mounted to a slanted windshield, off center from the driverÕs line of sight renders it only useful for initial programming and feature set-up – screen images are nothing like the advertisement you see. Finally, customer support needs work. When you look for guidance, you get a form letter/email telling you to submit a screen shot! I need to talk to a person and simply ask a question. I understand they are working on improving this. Hope this helps.. (This is an updated video – not as long and shows front and rear camera images)\n\nI have previously used the Rexing V1P 3rd Gen and the Viofo A129 Plus in my other vehicles, so I will be comparing those cameras to the Rexing 33497.\n\nFirst off setting up the dash cameras is pretty easy to do. I like to mount my camera up near my rear-view mirror so it looks like it is part of the vehicle. I run the rear camera wire to the rear camera though the headliner towards the side to keep the wires hidden out of the way. In comparison to the Viofo camera which uses a micro-USB, the rear camera on this Rexing 33497 uses a proprietary connection. LetÕs hope it lasts.\n\nComparing the video resolution of this camera to previous ones, the overall resolution does not at first appear that much different compared to other dash cameras. However, with this Rexing 33497 I do find it much easier to read the license plates of other vehicles when reviewing the footage on my computer. WhatÕs the point having a dash camera if you cannot read the license plate of the other car?\n\nI do not like that the video has a giant Rexing logo on the bottom left corner of the video. Other cameras IÕve used have had the GPS coordinates in place of the company logo, which I feel is a more useful feature.\n\nMy experience with Rexing Connect, their phone application, has not been the best. IÕve found it much easier and quicker to just remove the memory card and get the video on my laptop.\n\nFor memory cards, I have had the best luck with the Samsung Pro endurance memory cards. Definitely donÕt use SanDisk cards.\n\nIt is much easier to deal with your insurance when there is an issue, as you can just send them a video of the incident. When there are no other witnesses available, a dash camera helps.\n\nHaving a dash camera such as the Rexing 33497 is something that I consider a necessary requirement. With everyone driving like Ricky Bobby having to go back to work now, IÕm very glad I have a dash camera.\n\nRexing 33497 Review\n\nJust installed my fourth Rexing dash cam. I have been very pleased with the other three and have never had an issue with any of them. Fortunately, I have never had to use them to document an incident but it gives me peace of mind knowing they are there and running whenever I start the car.\n\nThe new one is Rexing 33497. It’s for my spare vehicle, a 2009 Hyundai Accent SE Hatchback. The device is an upgrade from my other units but the install process was very similar. Although the camera comes with a 12 volt cigarette lighter adapter I opted for the hardwire installation. The hardwire kit power supply comes at a small additional cost but it’s worth it to keep the cords out of the way. (However, I suppose anyone wanting to move the camera from vehicle to vehicle might find the plug in power adapter more useful.) Also don’t forget to purchase a high capacity Micro SDXC card since one is not included.\n\nSince the 33497 can be used with a smart hardwire kit I decided to go with that option. This allows the car to be monitored while parked, and if the car is hit or jostled then the camera will start to record. The best part is that it only turns on when activated so it wonÕt run down your carÕs battery. This is a new feature for me and I really like the concept.\n\nWell I just got everything installed. I think it looks pretty good and I have no doubt it will be just as reliable as my other three cameras have been. CanÕt wait to take it for a spin.\n\nI previously had the first generation of this dashcam and the 33497 is a major improvement and upgrade. The camera offers 4K resolution allowing for more detailed video and footage. The quality of the camera is top notch and improved considerably compared to the previous generation.\n\nI always like to have dashcams in my car. They are invaluable if in the unfortunate event there is a crash or accident. We also bring our dashcam while on vacation and mount it in the rental car since we can record our journey.\n\nOne feature that is nice is the WiFi transfer. With our original dashcam we would always have to take out the microSD card to transfer footage. Now, we can do this easily through the Rexing App and Wifi. You can also see a live view which is handy when you position the camera.\n\nOverall this is a very solid and reliable dashcam and it works great just like our first generation. Its nice to see the improvements\n\nNow for my concerns.\n\nSometimes the app doesnÕt always work when we connect to the WiFi access point on the dashcam and we will have to restart our phone or app.\n\nAnd finally, if you have an existing rexing dashcam that doesnÕt use the Mini-USB type power connector, it will require a complete re-wiring. Routing the wiring is a necessary chore, but it would have been nice if there was support for existing wiring setup.\n\nApart from these concerns, I would highly recommend this dashcam if you are in the market for your first dashcam or if you want to upgrade from a previous generation. The camera is a workhorse and will reliably record video when you need it the most.\n\nI have 4 Rexing dash cams in our familyÕs cars. I replaced the V1LG I have in my car with the newer 33497, and this unit does not disappoint. At first glance the front main unit is smaller which makes it less obtrusive in the front windshield. The rear camera appears a little larger though which may make it a little more visible from the rear depending on where on the rear window it is located.\n\nThe V1PGW powers up after the ignition is turned on. I connected it to the wiring in the ceiling console and ran the cable to the rear camera through the head liner from the ceiling console area to the rear window using the old cable as a fish tape to pull the new cable through. The video resolution is amazing and some screenshots are included with this review. The setup is straightforward, and the bonus is the ability to WiFi the camera to my iPhone. Storing the video on the phone makes it easier to replay at a momentÕs notice.\n\nThe controls are similar to the V1LG which makes for quick adaption to the new one. There is no battery in the V1PGW which means that there is no feature for a 15 second delay in shutdown as the V1LG has.\n\nAll in all a great dash cam.\n\nPros\n\nSmaller than previous models\n\nCrisp picture\n\nEasier to understand keys\n\nWiFi mode available\n\nCons\n\nConnectors on opposite side to previous models\n\nAM radio interference from rear camera.\n\nWiFi defaults ÒoffÓ very time power is cycled.\n\nI have been using Rexing camera systems now for over 3 years and I must say I just love them. Every car that I own or have owned in the last 3 years has had a Rexing dash camera installed in it. From the V1 basic to the newest one the 33497 that I just finished installing in my 2011 Camaro SS. All of them basically operate the same way, just a little better with each upgrade over the previous model. I love the fact that I can go from car to car and they operate in a very similar way. So I do not need to keep looking back at an owners manual to tell me how to do something. I have owned 6 different camera systems from Rexing now, 5 of them was a dash camera and 1 was a 2 way camera that I mounted on my motorcycle. (A motorcycle camera is next) The one thing that I wish Rexing would stop doing is making different windshield mounts for each type dash camera. V1 has one kind of mount, the V1P-Pro another and now the 33497 is another mount. If they would only make 1 it would be so much easier to upgrade my cameras without removing the windshield mount each time. But that is the only complaint that I have. Rexing dash cameras are pretty easy to install and set up in very little time you’re up and running. The newest one the 33497 is another great dash camera with a front and rear view camera along with 4K resolution is just breathtaking over the 1K units. I can see a much sharper image while IÕm looking over the video. They also added the parking monitor to this one and the V1 which will take 20 seconds of video if your car is hit in a parking lot (Ok that too could be a little longer). You will have to install the smart wiring kit to make that work, but I think itÕs worth it, and it does work from my test. Thank goodness I havenÕt needed that yet. Overall I donÕt think you can go wrong with any Rexing camera, but the 4K video is worth every penny to me.\n\nI purchased my first dash cam when I learned firsthand that the obvious truth doesnÕt matter without proof. I currently own a Rexing and have been very happy with it and like many on Amazon, I tend to upgrade my tech more often then probably necessary but always with good justification. I mean really, my wife most definitely needed a new dash cam __.\n\nThis new model of course has better quality video (not that my previous one was too shabby) but also some other nice touches. I appreciate the new design which has better button placement but more importantly the lens adjustment has a dial that is much easier to use, though once you set it youÕll rarely need to do it again. The front and back cameras work as expected and were still fairly easy to install. *One thing to keep in mind is that the suction mount for my V1P Pro didnÕt fit this new model. I personally like to use a suction instead of sticking it directly on the windshield. I looked up the one thatÕs listed on this oneÕs description, but to me it doesnÕt look like it will fit this newer model. IÕm going to email customer service to verify it but in the meantime a little Velcro and MacGyvering inelegantly got it to stay.\n\nThe main way I view the video is on my desktop (Mac) which as before works well and displays all the relevant information. I pretty much only use the iPhone app when IÕm adjusting the cameraÕs view. I find it easier than leaning over trying to use the screen which is hard to see clearly when the Southern California sun is shinning in my eyes. Speaking of which, I expect this model will hold up in the heat as well as my other one.\n\nOne addition I would like to have is an external battery that I can manually attach to power the camera when IÕm parked. My car is a Hybrid and I assume (I’m probably wrong and should stop procrastinating and do some research) I canÕt use the electrical to power the unit when the engine isnÕt on. It would be useful to be able to use it for when IÕm parked since itÕs rarely for long periods. Maybe this is possible with one of the batteries I already own but I have been reluctant to try it. Rexing could offer something like that, hint hint.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have found the Rexing dash cams to be reliable and well built. IÕm sure I will continue to buy this brand for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Don’t forget to check the website for updated firmware. It doesn’t happen often but it’s a good idea to check. It’s easy to do and they even have a video if you need it.\n\nI got this to upgrade my V1P Pro. The V1P Pro, which I’ve had for over three years, has continued to serve me well and is still worthy of continued use. With the release of the 33497, I thought now would be a good time to get an upgrade, given how ubiquitous 4K video quality is becoming. The first think I noticed is that the front camera/console has been slightly modified in button placement. Generally, the frame itself is almost identical, as well as the peripheral connectors. The quality of the video image is really good but only after it is downloaded from the SD card onto a 4K display. On the console itself, it is too small to notice the difference in quality between V1P Pro and the 33497. The HDR is very solid and so important when trying to capture details in shaded areas. The rear camera quality is also solid. It’s not 4K but that’s fine, as the rear camera was not designed for 4K.\n\nSome areas of improvement: I tried to replace the V1P Pro with this, hoping that the rear camera wouldn’t require the replacement of the entire cable, as I had to remove my carÕs panels to get to it. Unfortunately, I had no choice and had to pull out the cable. A shame, as I believe having a disconnect right on the rear camera would really encourage Rexing users to upgrade sooner than later. This is my biggest gripe. Ultimately, if youÕre already a user of the V1P Pro, I donÕt believe thereÕs any urgency in getting the 33497. If you are looking for a dash cam though, strongly recommend this camera.\n\nI have been an executive protection agent for 10 years now and also an auxiliary police officer. Dash cams and body cameras are part of my everyday business and are vital to the job.\n\nI have had Rexing cameras in the past and they were always good but this one is outstanding! If you had them before one thing you will notice is that this one is a little bit larger. I always like the smaller size of rexing cameras but it is clear why they made it slightly bigger. This new camera is far more sturdy it mounts very firmly. The the buttons seemed much more heavy duty as does the entire casing.\n\nThe response time also seems extremely faster than before while navigating the menus and connecting your Wi-Fi. There was always a short delay while using the rexing app on previous cameras to view video via Wi-Fi however not anymore! Operating system on this guy is super fast and reliable.\n\nI also like that they have added the second rear camera to this smaller unit. The wire that came with the camera was long enough to stretch to the back of my Yukon XL which I was very surprised about. It’s hard to find a car longer than mine LOL and this wire was plenty long enough.\n\nI noticed this will also record your mph and along with the date and plate number on the video If you so desire.\n\nAnd of course as with all rexing cameras the video quality is outstanding. The menus are very easy to navigate and give you lots of options to personalize the camera for your needs. I personally have mine hardwired in so that it is always recording which is what I highly recommend. Why not have an extra security camera running in your driveway . But if you so desire of course they have the G response in case somebody bumped your car while parked.\n\nI have had other brands of cameras in the past and never really liked any of them and have really settled in on rexing. I passed on upgrading for a couple years now but I’m so happy I did not delay on this one. This is by far the best camera I bought from rexing and I love it. If this camera works for me it’ll be fantastic for.\n\nBe safe!\n\nI got this camera to replace my Rexing V1 3G from 2018 which still works fine, just the display is dim and I wanted to try out the GPS features in this unit. That unit has served me well, operating probably 10 hours a day in my work truck. I have not hooked up the second camera yet, and not sure if I will.\n\nThe main issue I see so far is they are using the same DC cigarette style plug as before. This one seems to constantly pop out of my lighter socket. I had to put some electrical tape on the one contact to make enough pressure to keep it in place. I was hoping they had changed this. Since nothing changed with the plug, I decided to keep my existing power wire in place.\n\nFor the most part, this was a drop in replacement for my old camera. The mounting bracket is slightly different and needed to be changed, but I was able to use my same power cable. The unit was so slightly larger than my last one, so I had to adjust the mounting but it still works out fine. The new mount is much sturdier than the old one, the camera doesnÕt wiggle at all when interacting with the buttons or driving. The old style had a little more play and would wobble a little.\n\nLetÕs hope they changed the adhesive, though. The V1 G3 mountÕs adhesive failed within a few months of being installed in the summer heat. I had to fashion my own adhesive using 3M VHB. This unit is a bit heavier too, so letÕs see how the adhesive holds.\n\nInstall was a snap for me after changing the mounting. The menu system was just what I was used to, and easy to navigate. Wifi connection was fast, streaming video was seemless and downloads were pretty quick using the Rexing connect iOS app.\n\nNot sure if itÕs on my old model, but I found this useful screensaver (pictured) which I think is a nice touch. Overall so far I am impressed with the unit.\n\nBackstory\n\nI have been using the Rexing brand for my dash recording needs since 2016, and I have been a happy customer ever since. This is my 3rd camera (all upgrades as my needs changed) with the company, and there is plenty here in the Rexing 33497 dual channel dash camera.\n\nInstall\n\nInstalling the front camera goes as you expect, stick it to your front window behind the rearview mirror to get it out of your view. Something you do need to keep in mind when installing it is, locked on the windshield mount, the camera needs to travel 16 mm up to remove it from the bracket. If you do not leave this room from the top of your windshield, you will not be able to remove the camera from the windshield without peeling the bracket as well. Do yourself a favor and leave a little space. In the rear unit, you will need to figure out your path of travel during install to get the wire to the rear of the vehicle. When I had an older car, I ran the wire behind the weather stripping of the roof and got it to the back of the vehicle with little issue. With my newer car, that was not a great option since there are skirt airbags in that area of the car. I decided to follow the trim to the floor and run it under the gap of the carpet and bring it back up to the rear windshield, and I was in business. If you donÕt know where the airbags are in your car, I encourage you to watch a crash test video by NHTSA for their location, so you can avoid them.\n\nOperation\n\nThe cameras are both high quality, so you will have a nice picture to show off if you need it. The cameras do record together right out of the box with the default settings. You may need to set daylight savings if your area observes it. Since this is a GPS connected camera, the time is set automatically. My unit detected the time zone automatically, but there are settings to change that as well if need be. I used the included adapter and was up and running in a few minutes after getting my wires run. The unit powers on and off automatically with the car (assuming your power sockets shut off with your car) and it starts recording. They do have a GPS player for the Windows PC, so you can view all the GPS data on a large screen for review in addition, your speed is stamped on the footage. Rexing does sell a hard-wired kit, and it is required if you plan on using the parking monitor (It is sold separately). The parking monitor can be triggered by motion or the g-sensor. The setting for the g-sensor is set for both driving and parking mode, so if you set it to high sensitivity for parking, it will be highly sensitive for driving as well. In my opinion, I say stick with the motion trigger for the parking monitor to prevent unwanted locked clips.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is another slam dunk for Rexing, if you are looking for a dash unit, and you have a rear windshield (some work vans do not 🙂 ) you will want one that records the rear. You will be honestly surprised by the amount of texting drivers you will see from that camera, and if they hit you then you have high definition footage of them not following the law. I love the peace of mind that the camera gives. Give it a try, I think you will like the brand, I know I sure do.\n\nThis is my review of the Rexing 33497 dashcam that I have used for 3 weeks.\n\nEverything in the box was packaged very well and no missing components. The initial setup was very straight forward. There are two bases to mount the front camera to your windshield along with 3m tape to ensure it wonÕt come off. I also liked that they included several small clips that allowed me to hide the wire better without the risk of them dropping down. I used the cigarette lighter adapter at first but wanted a more permanent setup so I opted for the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nWhat I really liked:\n\n– I have a large SUV (Cadillac Escalade ESV). I was worried that the cable for the rear camera would not be long enough for me to mount to my rear windshield. Not only did it reach but I still had slack left over.\n\n– The ease of use: Once you have it connected it automatically turns on and records. The time/date was set automatically and if I want to export video to my phone I just go into the menu and turn the wifi on.\n\n– The GPS feature is cool. When I watched some of the play back it had my location and speed embedded into the video for both the front and rear camera.\n\n– I recorded at the highest quality and video/audio playback was crystal clear. I purchased their recommended 64GB SD so space will not be an issue.\n\n– When connected to WiFi you can video live video from the dashcam on your phone. This was helpful when trying to get the camera placement just right.\n\nWhat could use improvement:\n\n– When transferring video via WiFi it is a bit slow. Since I am recording at the highest quality the files can be around 50MB real and 200-300MB for the front camera. When trying to transfer files that are larger in size it would often give me an error and not transfer. This is not really a big concern because if something did happen, I would just take the card out and download it to my computer.\n\n– It would be nice if WiFi could also be enabled full time vs having to turn it on when you want to use it.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a solid dashcam you can not go wrong with this purchase. Their tech support is also great, and you talk to a human not a robot.\n\nThis is my 4th Rexing dash camera, I currently have 3 still running in vehicles one of which just turned 4 years old. As always Rexing’s build quality is great, no complaints.\n\nInstallation of the front camera is straight forward if you want a dangling wire. Installing the back camera, unless you know what you are doing, can be quite troublesome. You need to know which trim pieces to pull and where you can hide the wire from the back to the front. Took me about 15 minutes but this is not my first time I have wired a back camera in this car.\n\nThe quality is not bad, on the contrary it is quite good compared to my 1080p camera, but it does not look like true 4k. The resolution is there but the quality seems a little lackluster. I would love you know what sensor they have in this camera but I cannot find a spec sheet anywhere.\n\nPrice is maybe slightly higher than it should be based on some of the other premium brand dash cameras.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints, and this is a minor one, is the lack of USB plug in the 12v charger. Cheaper Rexing cameras have this but for some reason one of their more expensive cameras does not.\n\nAlso, Rexing, PLEASE remove the image of ÒRexingÓ at the bottom of the recordings and go back to the text of ÒREXING DASH CAMÓ.\n\nI have previously used the Rexing V1P 3rd Gen and the Viofo A129 Plus in my other vehicles, so I will be comparing those cameras to the Rexing 33497.\n\nFirst off setting up the dash cameras is pretty easy to do. I like to mount my camera up near my rear-view mirror so it looks like it is part of the vehicle. I run the rear camera wire to the rear camera though the headliner towards the side to keep the wires hidden out of the way. In comparison to the Viofo camera which uses a micro-USB, the rear camera on this Rexing 33497 uses a proprietary connection. LetÕs hope it lasts.\n\nComparing the video resolution of this camera to previous ones, the overall resolution does not at first appear that much different compared to other dash cameras. However, with this Rexing 33497 I do find it much easier to read the license plates of other vehicles when reviewing the footage on my computer. WhatÕs the point having a dash camera if you cannot read the license plate of the other car?\n\nI do not like that the video has a giant Rexing logo on the bottom left corner of the video. Other cameras IÕve used have had the GPS coordinates in place of the company logo, which I feel is a more useful feature.\n\nMy experience with Rexing Connect, their phone application, has not been the best. IÕve found it much easier and quicker to just remove the memory card and get the video on my laptop.\n\nFor memory cards, I have had the best luck with the Samsung Pro endurance memory cards. Definitely donÕt use SanDisk cards.\n\nIt is much easier to deal with your insurance when there is an issue, as you can just send them a video of the incident. When there are no other witnesses available, a dash camera helps.\n\nHaving a dash camera such as the Rexing 33497 is something that I consider a necessary requirement. With everyone driving like Ricky Bobby having to go back to work now, IÕm very glad I have a dash camera.\n\nThis is replacing a V1LG Rexing camera in a 2019 Mustang.\n\nUHD front FHD rear camera much better video quality upgraded rear camera design.\n\nRear camera one complaint adjuster is plastic clicking is loose in some areas, tighter in others. Meaning rear camera swivels 360¡ to adjust to a vertical or a sloped windshield. When adjusting to a vertical windshield camera mount is loose cannot adjust or tighten camera in anyway! When in a sloped windshield position camera is more stable, could be a defect or a design flaw.\n\nNow, with this 33497 Front cigarette lighter power cord is not long enough if youÕre going to put it in a F-150 through F-450 and hide the wire being tucked in and hidden completely. This cord on 33497 is same length as a V1P Max 4K and the V1P Pro Rexing cameras. Have both installed in my 2020 F-350 Limited came up about 4 feet short of cable. This camera 33497 Will do the same thing. There is no cable extension that Rexing makes to extend power from cigarette lighter to camera! Would be nice if they made a 6 foot extension cable that is compatible with the cameras power. Tried using cables to extend power off Amazon most of them are not compatible. The only other option is to hardwire to your fuse box using the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nRear camera cable is 18/20 feet long plenty of length for a car or truck no shortage of cable for rear camera power/Record wire.\n\nAll in all nice new packaging, good design front camera. Could do better on rear camera design!\n\nHave been a Rexing customer for several years now. Currently have 4 Rexing dash cameras installed in the family cars. Having two teenage drivers, its almost a must for any accidents that they may get into.\n\nHaving video prove that the accident was not your fault will pay for the cost of the camera and your piece of mind. Let alone the family drama if it was one of your kids that was in the accident.\n\nPrime example. My daughter was side swiped. The other driver lied to the officers at the scene and claimed my daughter had run a red light. My daughter kept her cool because she knew she had the video prove to back up her side of the story. Video recording proved that she did not run the red light and the other driver was at fault.\n\nInstall:\n\nInstall was straight forward for me since I was replacing an existing unit. Rexing does supply you with the good 3M black mounting adhesive. Compared to other companies that use a lesser quality mounting tape. Do leave a little room for the camera to slide off just in case you need to remove it sometime in the future. You may also want to hide it a little bit behind your rear-view mirror. In case you have the tendency to be looking at the camera screen while driving.\n\nHiding the wiring is the hardest part. Just take your time and hide the wires behind any interior trim. If you have any side air bags. I would recommend that you disconnect your battery prior to sticking any wires around the air bag trim pieces. You donÕt want the air bag to accidently go off. The rear camera cabling is long enough for an extended wheelbase vehicle. You should have enough cable to route around the air bag trim if you like, depending on your vehicle. I do prefer the older cable management tool that was included in previous versions. The new one to me is a little small.\n\nOperation:\n\nThe User Manual has been updated with more illustrations and covers setting up and operation. This is a welcome feature since most companies have forced you to go online for even a basic User Manual.\n\nThe 4K upgrade from previous models is a welcomed feature and the night vision is crisp and clear. The extra detail in the video image will be a benefit if you need to provide video playback. Due to the increased video quality and having a video file for the front and rear camera. You may want to consider going with a larger, up to the 256GB micro-SD card. Depending on how many videos you want to retain before they are over written. The built in GPS and speed monitoring are a great add-in feature for additional details for your accident report or in case you must prove you were not speeding. The included rear camera is a must have and is nice that it is included in this model. Front and rear camera adjustment allows you to adjust the camera for the best possible image. Depending on where it is located and if you have the available cigarette lighter socket available. You might want to think about the hardwire kit if you are planning on leveraging the parking monitor. It will take a little more work for its installation since it ties directly into your interior fuse panel. But it will free up the cigarette lighter socket and you or your kid wont figure to plug it in. If you are experiencing any issues with the Wi-Fi connection. Be sure to turn off your Wireless Data and that should address your connection issue.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs always, a great dash camera from Rexing with improved features over previous models. Well worth the upgrade.\n\nMy Review of the Rexing 33497\n\nWith all itÕs short comings, IÕm giving it four out of five stars and IÕd still buy another. This is the second REXING dash cam I have purchased. Overall well built, fairly easy to install and get started. I like having a rear camera. You will need to purchase a High Endurance SD card for the unit. I purchased a 256GB which is more than enough – especially given the camera does loop recording. Installation of the rear camera was a breeze but I couldnÕt place in the center of the rear window because my F150 has a sliding rear window and heated glass so placement was as close to center as I could avoiding the sliding window as well as the window heating lines. Still, my position offers a good view of the rear of the vehicle . I still have problems understanding how to activate some of the features. For instance, it took me some time to figure out how to switch from rear camera to front camera because the owners manual only says ÒScreen buttonÓ. Adding a little more definition like ÒFront to Rear CameraÓ would have offered more clarity. The front camera is low profile and hardly noticeable when placed near the rear view mirror out of driverÕs line of sight. One thing that is annoying, however, is the front camera picks up reflection glare of the dash that you can see in the videos. I wish there was a polarizing filter that could be added to avoid this Nevertheless, if you can deal with that, the images are still bright and clear. Like my first REXING, the little screen is basically useless and difficult to watch if thatÕs your intent. Given its slanted, mounted to a slanted windshield, off center from the driverÕs line of sight renders it only useful for initial programming and feature set-up – screen images are nothing like the advertisement you see. Finally, customer support needs work. When you look for guidance, you get a form letter/email telling you to submit a screen shot! I need to talk to a person and simply ask a question. I understand they are working on improving this. Hope this helps.. (This is an updated video – not as long and shows front and rear camera images)\n\nRexing 33497 Review\n\nJust installed my fourth Rexing dash cam. I have been very pleased with the other three and have never had an issue with any of them. Fortunately, I have never had to use them to document an incident but it gives me peace of mind knowing they are there and running whenever I start the car.\n\nThe new one is Rexing 33497. It’s for my spare vehicle, a 2009 Hyundai Accent SE Hatchback. The device is an upgrade from my other units but the install process was very similar. Although the camera comes with a 12 volt cigarette lighter adapter I opted for the hardwire installation. The hardwire kit power supply comes at a small additional cost but it’s worth it to keep the cords out of the way. (However, I suppose anyone wanting to move the camera from vehicle to vehicle might find the plug in power adapter more useful.) Also don’t forget to purchase a high capacity Micro SDXC card since one is not included.\n\nSince the 33497 can be used with a smart hardwire kit I decided to go with that option. This allows the car to be monitored while parked, and if the car is hit or jostled then the camera will start to record. The best part is that it only turns on when activated so it wonÕt run down your carÕs battery. This is a new feature for me and I really like the concept.\n\nWell I just got everything installed. I think it looks pretty good and I have no doubt it will be just as reliable as my other three cameras have been. CanÕt wait to take it for a spin.\n\nI previously had the first generation of this dashcam and the 33497 is a major improvement and upgrade. The camera offers 4K resolution allowing for more detailed video and footage. The quality of the camera is top notch and improved considerably compared to the previous generation.\n\nI always like to have dashcams in my car. They are invaluable if in the unfortunate event there is a crash or accident. We also bring our dashcam while on vacation and mount it in the rental car since we can record our journey.\n\nOne feature that is nice is the WiFi transfer. With our original dashcam we would always have to take out the microSD card to transfer footage. Now, we can do this easily through the Rexing App and Wifi. You can also see a live view which is handy when you position the camera.\n\nOverall this is a very solid and reliable dashcam and it works great just like our first generation. Its nice to see the improvements\n\nNow for my concerns.\n\nSometimes the app doesnÕt always work when we connect to the WiFi access point on the dashcam and we will have to restart our phone or app.\n\nAnd finally, if you have an existing rexing dashcam that doesnÕt use the Mini-USB type power connector, it will require a complete re-wiring. Routing the wiring is a necessary chore, but it would have been nice if there was support for existing wiring setup.\n\nApart from these concerns, I would highly recommend this dashcam if you are in the market for your first dashcam or if you want to upgrade from a previous generation. The camera is a workhorse and will reliably record video when you need it the most.\n\nI have 4 Rexing dash cams in our familyÕs cars. I replaced the V1LG I have in my car with the newer 33497, and this unit does not disappoint. At first glance the front main unit is smaller which makes it less obtrusive in the front windshield. The rear camera appears a little larger though which may make it a little more visible from the rear depending on where on the rear window it is located.\n\nThe V1PGW powers up after the ignition is turned on. I connected it to the wiring in the ceiling console and ran the cable to the rear camera through the head liner from the ceiling console area to the rear window using the old cable as a fish tape to pull the new cable through. The video resolution is amazing and some screenshots are included with this review. The setup is straightforward, and the bonus is the ability to WiFi the camera to my iPhone. Storing the video on the phone makes it easier to replay at a momentÕs notice.\n\nThe controls are similar to the V1LG which makes for quick adaption to the new one. There is no battery in the V1PGW which means that there is no feature for a 15 second delay in shutdown as the V1LG has.\n\nAll in all a great dash cam.\n\nPros\n\nSmaller than previous models\n\nCrisp picture\n\nEasier to understand keys\n\nWiFi mode available\n\nCons\n\nConnectors on opposite side to previous models\n\nAM radio interference from rear camera.\n\nWiFi defaults ÒoffÓ very time power is cycled.\n\nI have been using Rexing camera systems now for over 3 years and I must say I just love them. Every car that I own or have owned in the last 3 years has had a Rexing dash camera installed in it. From the V1 basic to the newest one the 33497 that I just finished installing in my 2011 Camaro SS. All of them basically operate the same way, just a little better with each upgrade over the previous model. I love the fact that I can go from car to car and they operate in a very similar way. So I do not need to keep looking back at an owners manual to tell me how to do something. I have owned 6 different camera systems from Rexing now, 5 of them was a dash camera and 1 was a 2 way camera that I mounted on my motorcycle. (A motorcycle camera is next) The one thing that I wish Rexing would stop doing is making different windshield mounts for each type dash camera. V1 has one kind of mount, the V1P-Pro another and now the 33497 is another mount. If they would only make 1 it would be so much easier to upgrade my cameras without removing the windshield mount each time. But that is the only complaint that I have. Rexing dash cameras are pretty easy to install and set up in very little time you’re up and running. The newest one the 33497 is another great dash camera with a front and rear view camera along with 4K resolution is just breathtaking over the 1K units. I can see a much sharper image while IÕm looking over the video. They also added the parking monitor to this one and the V1 which will take 20 seconds of video if your car is hit in a parking lot (Ok that too could be a little longer). You will have to install the smart wiring kit to make that work, but I think itÕs worth it, and it does work from my test. Thank goodness I havenÕt needed that yet. Overall I donÕt think you can go wrong with any Rexing camera, but the 4K video is worth every penny to me.\n\nI purchased my first dash cam when I learned firsthand that the obvious truth doesnÕt matter without proof. I currently own a Rexing and have been very happy with it and like many on Amazon, I tend to upgrade my tech more often then probably necessary but always with good justification. I mean really, my wife most definitely needed a new dash cam __.\n\nThis new model of course has better quality video (not that my previous one was too shabby) but also some other nice touches. I appreciate the new design which has better button placement but more importantly the lens adjustment has a dial that is much easier to use, though once you set it youÕll rarely need to do it again. The front and back cameras work as expected and were still fairly easy to install. *One thing to keep in mind is that the suction mount for my V1P Pro didnÕt fit this new model. I personally like to use a suction instead of sticking it directly on the windshield. I looked up the one thatÕs listed on this oneÕs description, but to me it doesnÕt look like it will fit this newer model. IÕm going to email customer service to verify it but in the meantime a little Velcro and MacGyvering inelegantly got it to stay.\n\nThe main way I view the video is on my desktop (Mac) which as before works well and displays all the relevant information. I pretty much only use the iPhone app when IÕm adjusting the cameraÕs view. I find it easier than leaning over trying to use the screen which is hard to see clearly when the Southern California sun is shinning in my eyes. Speaking of which, I expect this model will hold up in the heat as well as my other one.\n\nOne addition I would like to have is an external battery that I can manually attach to power the camera when IÕm parked. My car is a Hybrid and I assume (I’m probably wrong and should stop procrastinating and do some research) I canÕt use the electrical to power the unit when the engine isnÕt on. It would be useful to be able to use it for when IÕm parked since itÕs rarely for long periods. Maybe this is possible with one of the batteries I already own but I have been reluctant to try it. Rexing could offer something like that, hint hint.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have found the Rexing dash cams to be reliable and well built. IÕm sure I will continue to buy this brand for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Don’t forget to check the website for updated firmware. It doesn’t happen often but it’s a good idea to check. It’s easy to do and they even have a video if you need it.\n\nI got this to upgrade my V1P Pro. The V1P Pro, which I’ve had for over three years, has continued to serve me well and is still worthy of continued use. With the release of the 33497, I thought now would be a good time to get an upgrade, given how ubiquitous 4K video quality is becoming. The first think I noticed is that the front camera/console has been slightly modified in button placement. Generally, the frame itself is almost identical, as well as the peripheral connectors. The quality of the video image is really good but only after it is downloaded from the SD card onto a 4K display. On the console itself, it is too small to notice the difference in quality between V1P Pro and the 33497. The HDR is very solid and so important when trying to capture details in shaded areas. The rear camera quality is also solid. It’s not 4K but that’s fine, as the rear camera was not designed for 4K.\n\nSome areas of improvement: I tried to replace the V1P Pro with this, hoping that the rear camera wouldn’t require the replacement of the entire cable, as I had to remove my carÕs panels to get to it. Unfortunately, I had no choice and had to pull out the cable. A shame, as I believe having a disconnect right on the rear camera would really encourage Rexing users to upgrade sooner than later. This is my biggest gripe. Ultimately, if youÕre already a user of the V1P Pro, I donÕt believe thereÕs any urgency in getting the 33497. If you are looking for a dash cam though, strongly recommend this camera.\n\nI got this camera to replace my Rexing V1 3G from 2018 which still works fine, just the display is dim and I wanted to try out the GPS features in this unit. That unit has served me well, operating probably 10 hours a day in my work truck. I have not hooked up the second camera yet, and not sure if I will.\n\nThe main issue I see so far is they are using the same DC cigarette style plug as before. This one seems to constantly pop out of my lighter socket. I had to put some electrical tape on the one contact to make enough pressure to keep it in place. I was hoping they had changed this. Since nothing changed with the plug, I decided to keep my existing power wire in place.\n\nFor the most part, this was a drop in replacement for my old camera. The mounting bracket is slightly different and needed to be changed, but I was able to use my same power cable. The unit was so slightly larger than my last one, so I had to adjust the mounting but it still works out fine. The new mount is much sturdier than the old one, the camera doesnÕt wiggle at all when interacting with the buttons or driving. The old style had a little more play and would wobble a little.\n\nLetÕs hope they changed the adhesive, though. The V1 G3 mountÕs adhesive failed within a few months of being installed in the summer heat. I had to fashion my own adhesive using 3M VHB. This unit is a bit heavier too, so letÕs see how the adhesive holds.\n\nInstall was a snap for me after changing the mounting. The menu system was just what I was used to, and easy to navigate. Wifi connection was fast, streaming video was seemless and downloads were pretty quick using the Rexing connect iOS app.\n\nNot sure if itÕs on my old model, but I found this useful screensaver (pictured) which I think is a nice touch. Overall so far I am impressed with the unit.\n\nI have been an executive protection agent for 10 years now and also an auxiliary police officer. Dash cams and body cameras are part of my everyday business and are vital to the job.\n\nI have had Rexing cameras in the past and they were always good but this one is outstanding! If you had them before one thing you will notice is that this one is a little bit larger. I always like the smaller size of rexing cameras but it is clear why they made it slightly bigger. This new camera is far more sturdy it mounts very firmly. The the buttons seemed much more heavy duty as does the entire casing.\n\nThe response time also seems extremely faster than before while navigating the menus and connecting your Wi-Fi. There was always a short delay while using the rexing app on previous cameras to view video via Wi-Fi however not anymore! Operating system on this guy is super fast and reliable.\n\nI also like that they have added the second rear camera to this smaller unit. The wire that came with the camera was long enough to stretch to the back of my Yukon XL which I was very surprised about. It’s hard to find a car longer than mine LOL and this wire was plenty long enough.\n\nI noticed this will also record your mph and along with the date and plate number on the video If you so desire.\n\nAnd of course as with all rexing cameras the video quality is outstanding. The menus are very easy to navigate and give you lots of options to personalize the camera for your needs. I personally have mine hardwired in so that it is always recording which is what I highly recommend. Why not have an extra security camera running in your driveway . But if you so desire of course they have the G response in case somebody bumped your car while parked.\n\nI have had other brands of cameras in the past and never really liked any of them and have really settled in on rexing. I passed on upgrading for a couple years now but I’m so happy I did not delay on this one. This is by far the best camera I bought from rexing and I love it. If this camera works for me it’ll be fantastic for.\n\nBe safe!\n\nBackstory\n\nI have been using the Rexing brand for my dash recording needs since 2016, and I have been a happy customer ever since. This is my 3rd camera (all upgrades as my needs changed) with the company, and there is plenty here in the Rexing 33497 dual channel dash camera.\n\nInstall\n\nInstalling the front camera goes as you expect, stick it to your front window behind the rearview mirror to get it out of your view. Something you do need to keep in mind when installing it is, locked on the windshield mount, the camera needs to travel 16 mm up to remove it from the bracket. If you do not leave this room from the top of your windshield, you will not be able to remove the camera from the windshield without peeling the bracket as well. Do yourself a favor and leave a little space. In the rear unit, you will need to figure out your path of travel during install to get the wire to the rear of the vehicle. When I had an older car, I ran the wire behind the weather stripping of the roof and got it to the back of the vehicle with little issue. With my newer car, that was not a great option since there are skirt airbags in that area of the car. I decided to follow the trim to the floor and run it under the gap of the carpet and bring it back up to the rear windshield, and I was in business. If you donÕt know where the airbags are in your car, I encourage you to watch a crash test video by NHTSA for their location, so you can avoid them.\n\nOperation\n\nThe cameras are both high quality, so you will have a nice picture to show off if you need it. The cameras do record together right out of the box with the default settings. You may need to set daylight savings if your area observes it. Since this is a GPS connected camera, the time is set automatically. My unit detected the time zone automatically, but there are settings to change that as well if need be. I used the included adapter and was up and running in a few minutes after getting my wires run. The unit powers on and off automatically with the car (assuming your power sockets shut off with your car) and it starts recording. They do have a GPS player for the Windows PC, so you can view all the GPS data on a large screen for review in addition, your speed is stamped on the footage. Rexing does sell a hard-wired kit, and it is required if you plan on using the parking monitor (It is sold separately). The parking monitor can be triggered by motion or the g-sensor. The setting for the g-sensor is set for both driving and parking mode, so if you set it to high sensitivity for parking, it will be highly sensitive for driving as well. In my opinion, I say stick with the motion trigger for the parking monitor to prevent unwanted locked clips.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is another slam dunk for Rexing, if you are looking for a dash unit, and you have a rear windshield (some work vans do not 🙂 ) you will want one that records the rear. You will be honestly surprised by the amount of texting drivers you will see from that camera, and if they hit you then you have high definition footage of them not following the law. I love the peace of mind that the camera gives. Give it a try, I think you will like the brand, I know I sure do.\n\nThis is my 4th Rexing dash camera, I currently have 3 still running in vehicles one of which just turned 4 years old. As always Rexing’s build quality is great, no complaints.\n\nInstallation of the front camera is straight forward if you want a dangling wire. Installing the back camera, unless you know what you are doing, can be quite troublesome. You need to know which trim pieces to pull and where you can hide the wire from the back to the front. Took me about 15 minutes but this is not my first time I have wired a back camera in this car.\n\nThe quality is not bad, on the contrary it is quite good compared to my 1080p camera, but it does not look like true 4k. The resolution is there but the quality seems a little lackluster. I would love you know what sensor they have in this camera but I cannot find a spec sheet anywhere.\n\nPrice is maybe slightly higher than it should be based on some of the other premium brand dash cameras.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints, and this is a minor one, is the lack of USB plug in the 12v charger. Cheaper Rexing cameras have this but for some reason one of their more expensive cameras does not.\n\nAlso, Rexing, PLEASE remove the image of ÒRexingÓ at the bottom of the recordings and go back to the text of ÒREXING DASH CAMÓ.\n\nThis is replacing a V1LG Rexing camera in a 2019 Mustang.\n\nUHD front FHD rear camera much better video quality upgraded rear camera design.\n\nRear camera one complaint adjuster is plastic clicking is loose in some areas, tighter in others. Meaning rear camera swivels 360¡ to adjust to a vertical or a sloped windshield. When adjusting to a vertical windshield camera mount is loose cannot adjust or tighten camera in anyway! When in a sloped windshield position camera is more stable, could be a defect or a design flaw.\n\nNow, with this 33497 Front cigarette lighter power cord is not long enough if youÕre going to put it in a F-150 through F-450 and hide the wire being tucked in and hidden completely. This cord on 33497 is same length as a V1P Max 4K and the V1P Pro Rexing cameras. Have both installed in my 2020 F-350 Limited came up about 4 feet short of cable. This camera 33497 Will do the same thing. There is no cable extension that Rexing makes to extend power from cigarette lighter to camera! Would be nice if they made a 6 foot extension cable that is compatible with the cameras power. Tried using cables to extend power off Amazon most of them are not compatible. The only other option is to hardwire to your fuse box using the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nRear camera cable is 18/20 feet long plenty of length for a car or truck no shortage of cable for rear camera power/Record wire.\n\nAll in all nice new packaging, good design front camera. Could do better on rear camera design!\n\nThis is my review of the Rexing 33497 dashcam that I have used for 3 weeks.\n\nEverything in the box was packaged very well and no missing components. The initial setup was very straight forward. There are two bases to mount the front camera to your windshield along with 3m tape to ensure it wonÕt come off. I also liked that they included several small clips that allowed me to hide the wire better without the risk of them dropping down. I used the cigarette lighter adapter at first but wanted a more permanent setup so I opted for the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nWhat I really liked:\n\n– I have a large SUV (Cadillac Escalade ESV). I was worried that the cable for the rear camera would not be long enough for me to mount to my rear windshield. Not only did it reach but I still had slack left over.\n\n– The ease of use: Once you have it connected it automatically turns on and records. The time/date was set automatically and if I want to export video to my phone I just go into the menu and turn the wifi on.\n\n– The GPS feature is cool. When I watched some of the play back it had my location and speed embedded into the video for both the front and rear camera.\n\n– I recorded at the highest quality and video/audio playback was crystal clear. I purchased their recommended 64GB SD so space will not be an issue.\n\n– When connected to WiFi you can video live video from the dashcam on your phone. This was helpful when trying to get the camera placement just right.\n\nWhat could use improvement:\n\n– When transferring video via WiFi it is a bit slow. Since I am recording at the highest quality the files can be around 50MB real and 200-300MB for the front camera. When trying to transfer files that are larger in size it would often give me an error and not transfer. This is not really a big concern because if something did happen, I would just take the card out and download it to my computer.\n\n– It would be nice if WiFi could also be enabled full time vs having to turn it on when you want to use it.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a solid dashcam you can not go wrong with this purchase. Their tech support is also great, and you talk to a human not a robot.\n\nMy Review of the Rexing 33497\n\nWith all itÕs short comings, IÕm giving it four out of five stars and IÕd still buy another. This is the second REXING dash cam I have purchased. Overall well built, fairly easy to install and get started. I like having a rear camera. You will need to purchase a High Endurance SD card for the unit. I purchased a 256GB which is more than enough – especially given the camera does loop recording. Installation of the rear camera was a breeze but I couldnÕt place in the center of the rear window because my F150 has a sliding rear window and heated glass so placement was as close to center as I could avoiding the sliding window as well as the window heating lines. Still, my position offers a good view of the rear of the vehicle . I still have problems understanding how to activate some of the features. For instance, it took me some time to figure out how to switch from rear camera to front camera because the owners manual only says ÒScreen buttonÓ. Adding a little more definition like ÒFront to Rear CameraÓ would have offered more clarity. The front camera is low profile and hardly noticeable when placed near the rear view mirror out of driverÕs line of sight. One thing that is annoying, however, is the front camera picks up reflection glare of the dash that you can see in the videos. I wish there was a polarizing filter that could be added to avoid this Nevertheless, if you can deal with that, the images are still bright and clear. Like my first REXING, the little screen is basically useless and difficult to watch if thatÕs your intent. Given its slanted, mounted to a slanted windshield, off center from the driverÕs line of sight renders it only useful for initial programming and feature set-up – screen images are nothing like the advertisement you see. Finally, customer support needs work. When you look for guidance, you get a form letter/email telling you to submit a screen shot! I need to talk to a person and simply ask a question. I understand they are working on improving this. Hope this helps.. (This is an updated video – not as long and shows front and rear camera images)\n\nI have previously used the Rexing V1P 3rd Gen and the Viofo A129 Plus in my other vehicles, so I will be comparing those cameras to the Rexing 33497.\n\nFirst off setting up the dash cameras is pretty easy to do. I like to mount my camera up near my rear-view mirror so it looks like it is part of the vehicle. I run the rear camera wire to the rear camera though the headliner towards the side to keep the wires hidden out of the way. In comparison to the Viofo camera which uses a micro-USB, the rear camera on this Rexing 33497 uses a proprietary connection. LetÕs hope it lasts.\n\nComparing the video resolution of this camera to previous ones, the overall resolution does not at first appear that much different compared to other dash cameras. However, with this Rexing 33497 I do find it much easier to read the license plates of other vehicles when reviewing the footage on my computer. WhatÕs the point having a dash camera if you cannot read the license plate of the other car?\n\nI do not like that the video has a giant Rexing logo on the bottom left corner of the video. Other cameras IÕve used have had the GPS coordinates in place of the company logo, which I feel is a more useful feature.\n\nMy experience with Rexing Connect, their phone application, has not been the best. IÕve found it much easier and quicker to just remove the memory card and get the video on my laptop.\n\nFor memory cards, I have had the best luck with the Samsung Pro endurance memory cards. Definitely donÕt use SanDisk cards.\n\nIt is much easier to deal with your insurance when there is an issue, as you can just send them a video of the incident. When there are no other witnesses available, a dash camera helps.\n\nHaving a dash camera such as the Rexing 33497 is something that I consider a necessary requirement. With everyone driving like Ricky Bobby having to go back to work now, IÕm very glad I have a dash camera.\n\nHave been a Rexing customer for several years now. Currently have 4 Rexing dash cameras installed in the family cars. Having two teenage drivers, its almost a must for any accidents that they may get into.\n\nHaving video prove that the accident was not your fault will pay for the cost of the camera and your piece of mind. Let alone the family drama if it was one of your kids that was in the accident.\n\nPrime example. My daughter was side swiped. The other driver lied to the officers at the scene and claimed my daughter had run a red light. My daughter kept her cool because she knew she had the video prove to back up her side of the story. Video recording proved that she did not run the red light and the other driver was at fault.\n\nInstall:\n\nInstall was straight forward for me since I was replacing an existing unit. Rexing does supply you with the good 3M black mounting adhesive. Compared to other companies that use a lesser quality mounting tape. Do leave a little room for the camera to slide off just in case you need to remove it sometime in the future. You may also want to hide it a little bit behind your rear-view mirror. In case you have the tendency to be looking at the camera screen while driving.\n\nHiding the wiring is the hardest part. Just take your time and hide the wires behind any interior trim. If you have any side air bags. I would recommend that you disconnect your battery prior to sticking any wires around the air bag trim pieces. You donÕt want the air bag to accidently go off. The rear camera cabling is long enough for an extended wheelbase vehicle. You should have enough cable to route around the air bag trim if you like, depending on your vehicle. I do prefer the older cable management tool that was included in previous versions. The new one to me is a little small.\n\nOperation:\n\nThe User Manual has been updated with more illustrations and covers setting up and operation. This is a welcome feature since most companies have forced you to go online for even a basic User Manual.\n\nThe 4K upgrade from previous models is a welcomed feature and the night vision is crisp and clear. The extra detail in the video image will be a benefit if you need to provide video playback. Due to the increased video quality and having a video file for the front and rear camera. You may want to consider going with a larger, up to the 256GB micro-SD card. Depending on how many videos you want to retain before they are over written. The built in GPS and speed monitoring are a great add-in feature for additional details for your accident report or in case you must prove you were not speeding. The included rear camera is a must have and is nice that it is included in this model. Front and rear camera adjustment allows you to adjust the camera for the best possible image. Depending on where it is located and if you have the available cigarette lighter socket available. You might want to think about the hardwire kit if you are planning on leveraging the parking monitor. It will take a little more work for its installation since it ties directly into your interior fuse panel. But it will free up the cigarette lighter socket and you or your kid wont figure to plug it in. If you are experiencing any issues with the Wi-Fi connection. Be sure to turn off your Wireless Data and that should address your connection issue.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAs always, a great dash camera from Rexing with improved features over previous models. Well worth the upgrade.\n\nRexing 33497 Review\n\nJust installed my fourth Rexing dash cam. I have been very pleased with the other three and have never had an issue with any of them. Fortunately, I have never had to use them to document an incident but it gives me peace of mind knowing they are there and running whenever I start the car.\n\nThe new one is Rexing 33497. It’s for my spare vehicle, a 2009 Hyundai Accent SE Hatchback. The device is an upgrade from my other units but the install process was very similar. Although the camera comes with a 12 volt cigarette lighter adapter I opted for the hardwire installation. The hardwire kit power supply comes at a small additional cost but it’s worth it to keep the cords out of the way. (However, I suppose anyone wanting to move the camera from vehicle to vehicle might find the plug in power adapter more useful.) Also don’t forget to purchase a high capacity Micro SDXC card since one is not included.\n\nSince the 33497 can be used with a smart hardwire kit I decided to go with that option. This allows the car to be monitored while parked, and if the car is hit or jostled then the camera will start to record. The best part is that it only turns on when activated so it wonÕt run down your carÕs battery. This is a new feature for me and I really like the concept.\n\nWell I just got everything installed. I think it looks pretty good and I have no doubt it will be just as reliable as my other three cameras have been. CanÕt wait to take it for a spin.\n\nI previously had the first generation of this dashcam and the 33497 is a major improvement and upgrade. The camera offers 4K resolution allowing for more detailed video and footage. The quality of the camera is top notch and improved considerably compared to the previous generation.\n\nI always like to have dashcams in my car. They are invaluable if in the unfortunate event there is a crash or accident. We also bring our dashcam while on vacation and mount it in the rental car since we can record our journey.\n\nOne feature that is nice is the WiFi transfer. With our original dashcam we would always have to take out the microSD card to transfer footage. Now, we can do this easily through the Rexing App and Wifi. You can also see a live view which is handy when you position the camera.\n\nOverall this is a very solid and reliable dashcam and it works great just like our first generation. Its nice to see the improvements\n\nNow for my concerns.\n\nSometimes the app doesnÕt always work when we connect to the WiFi access point on the dashcam and we will have to restart our phone or app.\n\nAnd finally, if you have an existing rexing dashcam that doesnÕt use the Mini-USB type power connector, it will require a complete re-wiring. Routing the wiring is a necessary chore, but it would have been nice if there was support for existing wiring setup.\n\nApart from these concerns, I would highly recommend this dashcam if you are in the market for your first dashcam or if you want to upgrade from a previous generation. The camera is a workhorse and will reliably record video when you need it the most.\n\nI have 4 Rexing dash cams in our familyÕs cars. I replaced the V1LG I have in my car with the newer 33497, and this unit does not disappoint. At first glance the front main unit is smaller which makes it less obtrusive in the front windshield. The rear camera appears a little larger though which may make it a little more visible from the rear depending on where on the rear window it is located.\n\nThe V1PGW powers up after the ignition is turned on. I connected it to the wiring in the ceiling console and ran the cable to the rear camera through the head liner from the ceiling console area to the rear window using the old cable as a fish tape to pull the new cable through. The video resolution is amazing and some screenshots are included with this review. The setup is straightforward, and the bonus is the ability to WiFi the camera to my iPhone. Storing the video on the phone makes it easier to replay at a momentÕs notice.\n\nThe controls are similar to the V1LG which makes for quick adaption to the new one. There is no battery in the V1PGW which means that there is no feature for a 15 second delay in shutdown as the V1LG has.\n\nAll in all a great dash cam.\n\nPros\n\nSmaller than previous models\n\nCrisp picture\n\nEasier to understand keys\n\nWiFi mode available\n\nCons\n\nConnectors on opposite side to previous models\n\nAM radio interference from rear camera.\n\nWiFi defaults ÒoffÓ very time power is cycled.\n\nI have been using Rexing camera systems now for over 3 years and I must say I just love them. Every car that I own or have owned in the last 3 years has had a Rexing dash camera installed in it. From the V1 basic to the newest one the 33497 that I just finished installing in my 2011 Camaro SS. All of them basically operate the same way, just a little better with each upgrade over the previous model. I love the fact that I can go from car to car and they operate in a very similar way. So I do not need to keep looking back at an owners manual to tell me how to do something. I have owned 6 different camera systems from Rexing now, 5 of them was a dash camera and 1 was a 2 way camera that I mounted on my motorcycle. (A motorcycle camera is next) The one thing that I wish Rexing would stop doing is making different windshield mounts for each type dash camera. V1 has one kind of mount, the V1P-Pro another and now the 33497 is another mount. If they would only make 1 it would be so much easier to upgrade my cameras without removing the windshield mount each time. But that is the only complaint that I have. Rexing dash cameras are pretty easy to install and set up in very little time you’re up and running. The newest one the 33497 is another great dash camera with a front and rear view camera along with 4K resolution is just breathtaking over the 1K units. I can see a much sharper image while IÕm looking over the video. They also added the parking monitor to this one and the V1 which will take 20 seconds of video if your car is hit in a parking lot (Ok that too could be a little longer). You will have to install the smart wiring kit to make that work, but I think itÕs worth it, and it does work from my test. Thank goodness I havenÕt needed that yet. Overall I donÕt think you can go wrong with any Rexing camera, but the 4K video is worth every penny to me.\n\nI purchased my first dash cam when I learned firsthand that the obvious truth doesnÕt matter without proof. I currently own a Rexing and have been very happy with it and like many on Amazon, I tend to upgrade my tech more often then probably necessary but always with good justification. I mean really, my wife most definitely needed a new dash cam __.\n\nThis new model of course has better quality video (not that my previous one was too shabby) but also some other nice touches. I appreciate the new design which has better button placement but more importantly the lens adjustment has a dial that is much easier to use, though once you set it youÕll rarely need to do it again. The front and back cameras work as expected and were still fairly easy to install. *One thing to keep in mind is that the suction mount for my V1P Pro didnÕt fit this new model. I personally like to use a suction instead of sticking it directly on the windshield. I looked up the one thatÕs listed on this oneÕs description, but to me it doesnÕt look like it will fit this newer model. IÕm going to email customer service to verify it but in the meantime a little Velcro and MacGyvering inelegantly got it to stay.\n\nThe main way I view the video is on my desktop (Mac) which as before works well and displays all the relevant information. I pretty much only use the iPhone app when IÕm adjusting the cameraÕs view. I find it easier than leaning over trying to use the screen which is hard to see clearly when the Southern California sun is shinning in my eyes. Speaking of which, I expect this model will hold up in the heat as well as my other one.\n\nOne addition I would like to have is an external battery that I can manually attach to power the camera when IÕm parked. My car is a Hybrid and I assume (I’m probably wrong and should stop procrastinating and do some research) I canÕt use the electrical to power the unit when the engine isnÕt on. It would be useful to be able to use it for when IÕm parked since itÕs rarely for long periods. Maybe this is possible with one of the batteries I already own but I have been reluctant to try it. Rexing could offer something like that, hint hint.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have found the Rexing dash cams to be reliable and well built. IÕm sure I will continue to buy this brand for the foreseeable future.\n\n*Don’t forget to check the website for updated firmware. It doesn’t happen often but it’s a good idea to check. It’s easy to do and they even have a video if you need it.\n\nI got this to upgrade my V1P Pro. The V1P Pro, which I’ve had for over three years, has continued to serve me well and is still worthy of continued use. With the release of the 33497, I thought now would be a good time to get an upgrade, given how ubiquitous 4K video quality is becoming. The first think I noticed is that the front camera/console has been slightly modified in button placement. Generally, the frame itself is almost identical, as well as the peripheral connectors. The quality of the video image is really good but only after it is downloaded from the SD card onto a 4K display. On the console itself, it is too small to notice the difference in quality between V1P Pro and the 33497. The HDR is very solid and so important when trying to capture details in shaded areas. The rear camera quality is also solid. It’s not 4K but that’s fine, as the rear camera was not designed for 4K.\n\nSome areas of improvement: I tried to replace the V1P Pro with this, hoping that the rear camera wouldn’t require the replacement of the entire cable, as I had to remove my carÕs panels to get to it. Unfortunately, I had no choice and had to pull out the cable. A shame, as I believe having a disconnect right on the rear camera would really encourage Rexing users to upgrade sooner than later. This is my biggest gripe. Ultimately, if youÕre already a user of the V1P Pro, I donÕt believe thereÕs any urgency in getting the 33497. If you are looking for a dash cam though, strongly recommend this camera.\n\nI got this camera to replace my Rexing V1 3G from 2018 which still works fine, just the display is dim and I wanted to try out the GPS features in this unit. That unit has served me well, operating probably 10 hours a day in my work truck. I have not hooked up the second camera yet, and not sure if I will.\n\nThe main issue I see so far is they are using the same DC cigarette style plug as before. This one seems to constantly pop out of my lighter socket. I had to put some electrical tape on the one contact to make enough pressure to keep it in place. I was hoping they had changed this. Since nothing changed with the plug, I decided to keep my existing power wire in place.\n\nFor the most part, this was a drop in replacement for my old camera. The mounting bracket is slightly different and needed to be changed, but I was able to use my same power cable. The unit was so slightly larger than my last one, so I had to adjust the mounting but it still works out fine. The new mount is much sturdier than the old one, the camera doesnÕt wiggle at all when interacting with the buttons or driving. The old style had a little more play and would wobble a little.\n\nLetÕs hope they changed the adhesive, though. The V1 G3 mountÕs adhesive failed within a few months of being installed in the summer heat. I had to fashion my own adhesive using 3M VHB. This unit is a bit heavier too, so letÕs see how the adhesive holds.\n\nInstall was a snap for me after changing the mounting. The menu system was just what I was used to, and easy to navigate. Wifi connection was fast, streaming video was seemless and downloads were pretty quick using the Rexing connect iOS app.\n\nNot sure if itÕs on my old model, but I found this useful screensaver (pictured) which I think is a nice touch. Overall so far I am impressed with the unit.\n\nI have been an executive protection agent for 10 years now and also an auxiliary police officer. Dash cams and body cameras are part of my everyday business and are vital to the job.\n\nI have had Rexing cameras in the past and they were always good but this one is outstanding! If you had them before one thing you will notice is that this one is a little bit larger. I always like the smaller size of rexing cameras but it is clear why they made it slightly bigger. This new camera is far more sturdy it mounts very firmly. The the buttons seemed much more heavy duty as does the entire casing.\n\nThe response time also seems extremely faster than before while navigating the menus and connecting your Wi-Fi. There was always a short delay while using the rexing app on previous cameras to view video via Wi-Fi however not anymore! Operating system on this guy is super fast and reliable.\n\nI also like that they have added the second rear camera to this smaller unit. The wire that came with the camera was long enough to stretch to the back of my Yukon XL which I was very surprised about. It’s hard to find a car longer than mine LOL and this wire was plenty long enough.\n\nI noticed this will also record your mph and along with the date and plate number on the video If you so desire.\n\nAnd of course as with all rexing cameras the video quality is outstanding. The menus are very easy to navigate and give you lots of options to personalize the camera for your needs. I personally have mine hardwired in so that it is always recording which is what I highly recommend. Why not have an extra security camera running in your driveway . But if you so desire of course they have the G response in case somebody bumped your car while parked.\n\nI have had other brands of cameras in the past and never really liked any of them and have really settled in on rexing. I passed on upgrading for a couple years now but I’m so happy I did not delay on this one. This is by far the best camera I bought from rexing and I love it. If this camera works for me it’ll be fantastic for.\n\nBe safe!\n\nBackstory\n\nI have been using the Rexing brand for my dash recording needs since 2016, and I have been a happy customer ever since. This is my 3rd camera (all upgrades as my needs changed) with the company, and there is plenty here in the Rexing 33497 dual channel dash camera.\n\nInstall\n\nInstalling the front camera goes as you expect, stick it to your front window behind the rearview mirror to get it out of your view. Something you do need to keep in mind when installing it is, locked on the windshield mount, the camera needs to travel 16 mm up to remove it from the bracket. If you do not leave this room from the top of your windshield, you will not be able to remove the camera from the windshield without peeling the bracket as well. Do yourself a favor and leave a little space. In the rear unit, you will need to figure out your path of travel during install to get the wire to the rear of the vehicle. When I had an older car, I ran the wire behind the weather stripping of the roof and got it to the back of the vehicle with little issue. With my newer car, that was not a great option since there are skirt airbags in that area of the car. I decided to follow the trim to the floor and run it under the gap of the carpet and bring it back up to the rear windshield, and I was in business. If you donÕt know where the airbags are in your car, I encourage you to watch a crash test video by NHTSA for their location, so you can avoid them.\n\nOperation\n\nThe cameras are both high quality, so you will have a nice picture to show off if you need it. The cameras do record together right out of the box with the default settings. You may need to set daylight savings if your area observes it. Since this is a GPS connected camera, the time is set automatically. My unit detected the time zone automatically, but there are settings to change that as well if need be. I used the included adapter and was up and running in a few minutes after getting my wires run. The unit powers on and off automatically with the car (assuming your power sockets shut off with your car) and it starts recording. They do have a GPS player for the Windows PC, so you can view all the GPS data on a large screen for review in addition, your speed is stamped on the footage. Rexing does sell a hard-wired kit, and it is required if you plan on using the parking monitor (It is sold separately). The parking monitor can be triggered by motion or the g-sensor. The setting for the g-sensor is set for both driving and parking mode, so if you set it to high sensitivity for parking, it will be highly sensitive for driving as well. In my opinion, I say stick with the motion trigger for the parking monitor to prevent unwanted locked clips.\n\nOverall\n\nThis is another slam dunk for Rexing, if you are looking for a dash unit, and you have a rear windshield (some work vans do not 🙂 ) you will want one that records the rear. You will be honestly surprised by the amount of texting drivers you will see from that camera, and if they hit you then you have high definition footage of them not following the law. I love the peace of mind that the camera gives. Give it a try, I think you will like the brand, I know I sure do.\n\nThis is my 4th Rexing dash camera, I currently have 3 still running in vehicles one of which just turned 4 years old. As always Rexing’s build quality is great, no complaints.\n\nInstallation of the front camera is straight forward if you want a dangling wire. Installing the back camera, unless you know what you are doing, can be quite troublesome. You need to know which trim pieces to pull and where you can hide the wire from the back to the front. Took me about 15 minutes but this is not my first time I have wired a back camera in this car.\n\nThe quality is not bad, on the contrary it is quite good compared to my 1080p camera, but it does not look like true 4k. The resolution is there but the quality seems a little lackluster. I would love you know what sensor they have in this camera but I cannot find a spec sheet anywhere.\n\nPrice is maybe slightly higher than it should be based on some of the other premium brand dash cameras.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints, and this is a minor one, is the lack of USB plug in the 12v charger. Cheaper Rexing cameras have this but for some reason one of their more expensive cameras does not.\n\nAlso, Rexing, PLEASE remove the image of ÒRexingÓ at the bottom of the recordings and go back to the text of ÒREXING DASH CAMÓ.\n\nThis is replacing a V1LG Rexing camera in a 2019 Mustang.\n\nUHD front FHD rear camera much better video quality upgraded rear camera design.\n\nRear camera one complaint adjuster is plastic clicking is loose in some areas, tighter in others. Meaning rear camera swivels 360¡ to adjust to a vertical or a sloped windshield. When adjusting to a vertical windshield camera mount is loose cannot adjust or tighten camera in anyway! When in a sloped windshield position camera is more stable, could be a defect or a design flaw.\n\nNow, with this 33497 Front cigarette lighter power cord is not long enough if youÕre going to put it in a F-150 through F-450 and hide the wire being tucked in and hidden completely. This cord on 33497 is same length as a V1P Max 4K and the V1P Pro Rexing cameras. Have both installed in my 2020 F-350 Limited came up about 4 feet short of cable. This camera 33497 Will do the same thing. There is no cable extension that Rexing makes to extend power from cigarette lighter to camera! Would be nice if they made a 6 foot extension cable that is compatible with the cameras power. Tried using cables to extend power off Amazon most of them are not compatible. The only other option is to hardwire to your fuse box using the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nRear camera cable is 18/20 feet long plenty of length for a car or truck no shortage of cable for rear camera power/Record wire.\n\nAll in all nice new packaging, good design front camera. Could do better on rear camera design!\n\nThis is my review of the Rexing 33497 dashcam that I have used for 3 weeks.\n\nEverything in the box was packaged very well and no missing components. The initial setup was very straight forward. There are two bases to mount the front camera to your windshield along with 3m tape to ensure it wonÕt come off. I also liked that they included several small clips that allowed me to hide the wire better without the risk of them dropping down. I used the cigarette lighter adapter at first but wanted a more permanent setup so I opted for the Rexing hardwire kit.\n\nWhat I really liked:\n\n– I have a large SUV (Cadillac Escalade ESV). I was worried that the cable for the rear camera would not be long enough for me to mount to my rear windshield. Not only did it reach but I still had slack left over.\n\n– The ease of use: Once you have it connected it automatically turns on and records. The time/date was set automatically and if I want to export video to my phone I just go into the menu and turn the wifi on.\n\n– The GPS feature is cool. When I watched some of the play back it had my location and speed embedded into the video for both the front and rear camera.\n\n– I recorded at the highest quality and video/audio playback was crystal clear. I purchased their recommended 64GB SD so space will not be an issue.\n\n– When connected to WiFi you can video live video from the dashcam on your phone. This was helpful when trying to get the camera placement just right.\n\nWhat could use improvement:\n\n– When transferring video via WiFi it is a bit slow. Since I am recording at the highest quality the files can be around 50MB real and 200-300MB for the front camera. When trying to transfer files that are larger in size it would often give me an error and not transfer. This is not really a big concern because if something did happen, I would just take the card out and download it to my computer.\n\n– It would be nice if WiFi could also be enabled full time vs having to turn it on when you want to use it.\n\nOverall if you are looking for a solid dashcam you can not go wrong with this purchase. Their tech support is also great, and you talk to a human not a robot.\n\nHave been a Rexing customer for several years now. Currently have 4 Rexing dash cameras installed in the family cars. Having two teenage drivers, its almost a must for any accidents that they may get into.\n\nHaving video prove that the accident was not your fault will pay for the cost of the camera and your piece of mind. Let alone the family drama if it was one of your kids that was in the accident.\n\nPrime example. My daughter was side swiped. The other driver lied to the officers at the scene and claimed my daughter had run a red light. My daughter kept her cool because she knew she had the video prove to back up her side of the story. Video recording proved that she did not run the red light and the other driver was at fault.\n\nInstall:\n\nInstall was straight forward for me since I was replacing an existing unit. Rexing does supply you with the good 3M black mounting adhesive. Compared to other companies that use a lesser quality mounting tape. Do leave a little room for the camera to slide off just in case you need to remove it sometime in the future. You may also want to hide it a little bit behind your rear-view mirror. In case you have the tendency to be looking at the camera screen while driving.\n\nHiding the wiring is the hardest part. Just take your time and hide the wires behind any interior trim. If you have any side air bags. I would recommend that you disconnect your battery prior to sticking any wires around the air bag trim pieces. You donÕt want the air bag to accidently go off. The rear camera cabling is long enough for an extended wheelbase vehicle. You should have enough cable to route around the air bag trim if you like, depending on your vehicle. I do prefer the older cable management tool that was included in previous versions. The new one to me is a little small.\n\nOperation:\n\nThe User Manual has been updated with more illustrations and covers setting up and operation. This is a welcome feature since most companies have forced you to go online for even a basic User Manual.\n\nThe 4K upgrade from previous models is a welcomed feature and the night vision is crisp and clear. The extra detail in the video image will be a benefit if you need to provide video playback. Due to the increased video quality and having a video file for the front and rear camera. You may want to consider going with a larger, up to the 256GB micro-SD card. Depending on how many videos you want to retain before they are over written. The built in GPS and speed monitoring are a great add-in feature for additional details for your accident report or in case you must prove you were not speeding. The included rear camera is a must have and is nice that it is included in this model. Front and rear camera adjustment allows you to adjust the camera for the best possible image. Depending on where it is located and if you have the available cigarette lighter socket available. You might want to think about the hardwire kit if you are planning on leveraging the parking monitor.
