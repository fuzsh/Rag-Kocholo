        "text": "Best Business Schools Rankings: UK and US\n\nThere are numerous university ranking systems, including the Academic Ranking of World Universities (based on quality of education, quality of faculty, research output, and per capita academic performance), Times Higher Education World University Rankings (based on teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international outlook), and Webometrics Ranking of World Universities (based on web presence and online visibility).\n\nSo, as you can see, each ranking system has its own criteria, and results will vary according to each system. However, you can bet your bottom dollar that most of the usual suspects (your Ivy Leagues and your Oxfords) will always feature prominently. However, as we ALWAYS reiterate, some universities don’t even rank in the top 400, but they will still provide you with an outstanding education if you do the work!\n\nBut let’s see what the results for best business schools say …\n\nJoin over 90% of students getting better grades!\n\nThat’s a pretty good statistic. Download our free all-in-one learning app and start your most successful learning journey yet. Let’s do it!\n\nGet started now\n\nThe 5 Best Business Schools in the UK 🇬🇧\n\nThe rankings from QS World University Rankings by Subject are for Business and Management Studies.\n\nRanking (QS System) University Established 1 in the UK, 3 globally London Business School (University of London) 1964 2 in the UK, 8 globally University of Cambridge Judge Business School 1990 3 in the UK, 9 globally Saïd Business School (University of Oxford) 1996 4 in the UK, 11 globally The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) 1895 (Fun fact: cofounded by playwright George Bernard Shaw!) 5 in the UK, 21 globally Warwick Business School (University of Warwick) 1967\n\nTo get a feel for the Saïd Business School (named after businessman and philanthropist Wafic Saïd), you can watch this video celebrating the school’s 25th anniversary:\n\nAnd if you want to experience the life of a student at LSE (which has produced nine Noble laureates!), you can check out their student vlogs page offering tons of helpful info, such as campus tours, finding accommodating in London, how to connect with your classmates, budgeting tips, how to write your dissertation, how to read academic texts, and study spots on campus.\n\nBest Business Schools in the US 🇺🇸\n\nThe rankings from QS World University Rankings by Subject are for Business and Management Studies.\n\nRanking (QS System) University Established 1 in the US, 1 globally Harvard Business School (Harvard University) 1908 2 in the US, 4 globally Stanford Graduate School of Business (Standford University) 1925 3 in the US, 5 globally MIT Sloan School of Management (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) 1914 4 in the US, 7 globally The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 1881 5 in the US, 12 globally Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley 1898\n\nNow, if you want to attend the number one business school in the world, you don’t need to enroll in an MBA or PhD program – you can simply do an online course lasting between six and eight weeks! Course topics include Business Essentials, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Finance and Accounting, and Leadership and Management. Below is an example of the certificate you earn on completion of one of the online courses:\n\nAn interesting fact regarding the Stanford Graduate School of Business: It is the most competitive business school globally for an MBA (Master of Business Administration) – 2021’s acceptance rate was just over six percent! If you’re keen to learn more about this highly acclaimed school, you can check out their latest magazine, which includes insightful articles on AI (be sure to read How to Survive the AI Revolution), innovation, stories from alumni, leadership, and common challenges in the workplace, like dealing with difficult bosses.\n\nAnd if you’d like a tour of the incredible Stanford GSB campus, here’s a video highlighting some of the top spots 👇:\n\nM7 Business Schools: What’s the Deal?\n\nCan you guess what the M stands for? Master? Merit? Mighty? It’s actually … magnificent!\n\nM7 business schools are the top seven graduate business schools in the US, offering the most prestigious and highly sought-after MBA graduate programs. They have an extremely selective admission process, and applicants must demonstrate substantial academic achievement (including high GMAT* scores) and other significant achievements (community impact, entrepreneurship, leadership, etc.). M7 business schools have (of course) famous alumni who have gone on to become CEOs or hold other executive positions at top global companies.\n\nSo, which schools comprise the M7?\n\nColumbia Business School\n\nPrestige: CBS is also an Ivy League school (as are Harvard and UPenn).\n\nHarvard Business School\n\nFamous alumni: CEO and founder of Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg.\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management\n\nFamous alumni: Kofi Annan, former secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nNorthwestern University Kellogg School of Management\n\nHistory: Recognize the name of your beloved Cereal brand? Kellogg School of Management was named after John L. Kellogg, the son of the founder of Kellogg’s cereal!\n\nStanford Graduate School of Business\n\nSalary: Graduates can expect a post-MBA salary of just under 225,000 USD!\n\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\n\nNobel laureates: The BSB is associated with a brilliant nine Nobel laureates in Economic Sciences!\n\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nFamous alumni: Tesla, SpaceX, and now Twitter (yikes) CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe Wharton School is also the biggest regarding class size, with just over 900 students.\n\n* GMAT stands for Graduate Management Admission Test, the most widely used test to assess if a candidate is ready for graduate business and management programs (especially an MBA). The higher the GMAT score, the better the chances of admission, especially into an M7 school. The GMAT assesses critical thinking and reasoning skills, as well as writing, reading, and analytical skills. M7 schools require GMAT scores over 700 – and stats indicate that only 6% of candidates taking the test get over 700!\n\nThe Best Business Schools in Europe\n\nEurope ranks really well for universities offering Business and Management Studies. Here are the top 5:\n\nINSEAD, France: 2 globally\n\nFun fact: INSEAD is ranked first in Europe for the number of unicorns founded by an INSEAD alumnus (unfortunately, we don’t mean actual unicorns but rather private startup companies valued at over a staggering $1 billion). 🦄\n\nSDA Bocconi School of Management (Bocconi University, Italy): 6 globally\n\nFun fact: The SDA Bocconi School of Management is one of only 100 universities that holds what is known as the “triple crown,” meaning that three prestigious accreditation associations have accredited it.\n\nHEC Paris, France: 10 globally\n\nFun fact: Françoise Hollande, former president of France, is an HEC alumnus. It is also one of the oldest business schools globally, founded in 1881.\n\nCopenhagen Business School, Denmark: 14 globally\n\nFun fact: CBS is one of the largest business schools, with over 20,000 students. Unlike many schools listed here, CBS offers a comprehensive undergraduate program. You can choose from economics and maths, communication in companies, international business relations, IT and information in companies, people in organizations, and business startup and development.\n\nRotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Netherlands: 15 globally\n\nFun fact: The Rotterdam School of Management was ranked number 1 in the 2021 Shanghai Global Ranking of Academic Subjects in the Business Administration category.\n\nIf you want a taste of graduating at the prestigious INSEAD, then watch this video of valedictorian speaker Shahbaaz Sabharwal for the 2022 MBA Class (also, if you scroll towards the end of the video, you’ll get a good view of how magnificently magical INSEAD and its surroundings are – literally Hogwarts vibes!):\n\nBest Business Schools in the World: Continents\n\nAnd here are the top 100 business schools in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. I was a little biased in presenting my alma mater (Wits University), BUT it is a fantastic university if you’re considering doing an exchange program to South Africa 😉.\n\nLatin America\n\nEGADE Business School Monterry (Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico): 30 globally.\n\nPontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (UC), Chile: 58 globally.\n\nUniversidad de los Andes School of Management, Colombia: 91 globally.\n\nBusiness School São Paulo (Universidade de São Paulo), Brazil: 97 globally.\n\nUniversidad Adolfo Ibáñez Business School, Chile: 102 globally.\n\nAfrica\n\nAUC School of Business (The American University in Cairo), Egypt.\n\nCairo University, Egypt.\n\nUCT Graduate School of Business (University of Cape Town), South Africa.\n\nStellenbosch Business School (Stellenbosch University), South Africa.\n\nWits Business School (University of the Witwatersrand), South Africa.\n\nFun fact: Wits Business School has the highest number of MBA graduates in Africa. It also has the largest academic institution case centre in Africa, giving students the opportunity to analyze a diversity of real-life business challenges.\n\nExam stress causing you sleepless nights?\n\nGet a good night’s rest with our free teacher-verified study sets and a smart study planner to help you manage your studies effectively.\n\nGet started now\n\nAsia\n\nNUS Business School (National University of Singapore), Singapore: 13 globally.\n\nNanyang Business School (Nanyang Technological University), Singapore: 20 globally.\n\nHKUST Business School Central (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology), Hong Kong: 24 globally.\n\nLee Kong Chian School of Business (Singapore Management University), Singapore: 36 globally.\n\nSeoul National University Business School, South Korea: 39 globally.\n\nFun fact: The National University of Singapore’s Business School’s website also has an option where you can chat with NSU Business School students to get first-hand insights into what it’s like to study at the school.\n\nOceania\n\nMelbourne Business School (The University of Melbourne), Australia: 34 globally.\n\nUNSW Business School (University of New South Wales), Australia: 44 globally.\n\nThe University of Sydney Business School, Australia: 47 globally.\n\nMonash Business School (Monash University), Australia: 52 globally.\n\nANU College of Business and Economics (Australian National University), Australia: 83 globally.\n\nThe University of Auckland Business School, New Zealand: 105 globally.\n\nYou can follow this link to see some of the research published by students/alumni/professors of The University of Melbourne’s business school. This paper, “How the Linguistic Styles of Donald Trump and Joe Biden Reflect Different Forms of Power,” was SUPER interesting to read!\n\nBest Business Schools List: Graduate Programs\n\nMany business schools on this list only offer graduate programs, which you can explore after your undergraduate degree. But as we said above, you don’t need to pursue a full-time, long-term degree like an MBA or PhD – a lot of these schools also offer fantastic online short courses with certification that’ll be sure to provide you with invaluable knowledge and skills from top lecturers and professors. Always do your research when searching for a university to study at to see if their programs align with your career goals. And yes, unfortunately, business schools can be very pricy, so be sure to check out our posts on how to secure a scholarship!\n\nGood luck on your quest to becoming the best in the business 😉, and remember: While prestigious schools do give you access to some of the best minds, resources, and facilities in the world (as well as some pretty impressive salary increases upon graduation), there are GREAT minds everywhere, and you can always learn something valuable, no matter where (or when!) you study!"
