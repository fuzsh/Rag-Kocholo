        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. -- United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan , scheduled to be Duke University's commencement speaker at its Sunday, May 11, graduation ceremony, will not be able to attend because of health reasons, Duke officials announced Tuesday.\n\nOn the advice of his doctor and because of persistent laryngitis, Annan is canceling all travel and speaking engagements for the next several weeks, said Kevin Kennedy, a member of the secretary-general's staff.\n\nDuke President Nannerl O. Keohane will read excerpts of Annan's speech during commencement.\n\n\"The secretary-general informed us late yesterday that he would be unable to attend Duke's commencement,\" Keohane said. \"When he sent us a draft of his speech today, however, we were touched by the words he planned to share, comparing his own journey from Ghana to the United Nations with the choices Duke students face as they graduate. We decided to read aloud some excerpts at our ceremony, knowing that our graduates and their friends and families will be moved by his message of hope in a time of uncertainty.\"\n\nIn addition, the four other honorary degree recipients -- U.S. Navy Admiral Frank L. \"Skip\" Bowman; artist, author and feminist Judy Chicago; physician-scientist Dr. Richard D. Klausner and dance leader Charles L. Reinhart -- will each make brief remarks during commencement.\n\nGraduation weekend events are not limited to Sunday's commencement ceremony. From Friday through Sunday evening, different schools, departments and programs have scheduled special events to recognize their graduating students.\n\nDuke will award 2,960 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees during Sunday's commencement ceremony in Wallace Wade Stadium. Keohane will preside at the 10 a.m. exercise, which is free and open to the public.\n\nVisitors on campus\n\nThe University's Secretary's office, which oversees planning for graduation weekend, estimates the main commencement exercise and various ceremonies held by individual schools, departments and programs will attract about 18,000 people to campus beginning Friday.\n\nThe Durham Convention and Visitor's Bureau (DCVB) is estimating this year's graduation will add an estimated $1.5 million to the local economy through sales of food, hotel rooms, retail items, gasoline, car rentals and entertainment, according to Reyn Bowman, DCVB president.\n\nIt's a busy time for Durham's innkeepers and restaurateurs, with Mother's Day, and the commencements for both Duke and North Carolina Central University all on the same weekend, Bowman said.\n\nBowman said an estimated two-thirds of Duke visitors will stay overnight, helping to contribute to the total economic impact. \"That's a significant chunk of business,\" he said.\n\nOn campus, additional police officers will help with extra traffic and parking demands, said Maj. Burnice Parker of the Duke University Police Department.\n\nThose seeking parking spaces are encouraged to arrive early. Nearly all campus lots, including gated facilities, will be open, but several lots near Wallace Wade Stadium and East Campus, where ceremonies and special events are planned, will be restricted. Parker recommended that West Campus visitors park at the Gross Chemistry Building, at the corner of Science Drive and Towerview Road.\n\nOn Sunday, shuttle buses will run from Circuit Drive (which connects Towerview Road and LaSalle Street) to Wallace Wade Stadium. Out-of-town visitors can take buses from one of five hotels. Schedules for the shuttle service will be posted Friday in the lobbies of the Millennium Hotel, Hilton Durham Hotel, Durham Fairfield Inn, Courtyard Marriott and Durham Marriott at the Civic Center.\n\nPeople will mobility impairments may be driven to the entrance of each venue, but their vehicles must be parked elsewhere.\n\nSpeakers at other ceremonies\n\nIndividual schools also will bring guest speakers on campus over the weekend to address their graduates in special ceremonies:\n\n-- At 7:30 p.m. Friday in Duke Chapel, Dr. Edward C. Halperin, vice dean for the School of Medicine, will be the keynote speaker at the Hippocratic Oath Ceremony for medical school graduates.\n\n-- At 9 a.m. Saturday, Gilbert M. Grosvenor, chairman of the National Geographic Society's Board of Trustees and former editor of National Geographic and president of the society, will speak to the graduates of the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences in the Levine Science Research Center Courtyard.\n\n-- At 10 a.m. Saturday, Donald R. Keough, former president of the Coca-Cola Co., will address graduates of the daytime Duke MBA Program of the Fuqua School of Business in Cameron Indoor Stadium.\n\n-- At 2 p.m. Saturday in Cameron, Leslie E. Bains, senior executive vice president of HSBC Bank, North America, will speak at The Duke MBA-Cross Continent, a program of the Fuqua School.\n\n-- At 6 p.m. Saturday, Dennis W. Archer, president-elect of the American Bar Association, will speak at the law school's commencement in Cameron.\n\n-- At 6:30 p.m. Saturday, Willie J. Jennings, senior associate dean for academic programs and assistant research professor of theology and black church studies, will preach the sermon titled \"The Proper Imbalance\" at the Divinity School commencement in Duke Chapel.\n\n-- At 7 p.m. Saturday, Major General (Ret.)
