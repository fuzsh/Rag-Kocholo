        "text": "We are grateful to alumnus Jan Fischer (PPE, 1989) for his generous support of the Kofi Annan Scholarships, and to the Kofi Annan Foundation for enabling this inspiring association.\n\nWe are delighted to present our 2023-2024 cohort of Kofi Annan scholars of the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann graduate programme below.\n\nMSc Environmental Change and Management\n\nXenia is a dedicated ESG professional committed to driving positive change in the corporate world.\n\nIn her recent role at Evraz, a global steel and mining company, she contributed to the development of the sustainability strategy, including pathways to net zero. Prior to this, she gained valuable experience in the consulting industry and a national development institution.\n\nHaving studied economics and finance at the Financial University, Xenia is currently focused on enhancing her knowledge of environmental and climate science. Her ultimate goal is to transform companies operating in hard-to-abate industries towards conscious business. She firmly believes that environmental and social responsibility coupled with good governance in the business realm will pave the way for a more peaceful, equal, and sustainable world.\n\nMSc Social Science of the Internet\n\nTsimafei Malakhouski studied Political Science at the European Humanities University in Vilnius, where he also served as the elected president of the Students’ Union.\n\nCurrently, he holds the role of a programme manager and political analyst at Honest People, a Belarusian civil society organisation operating in exile in Warsaw, Poland. Tsimafei’s work focuses on civic education and fostering democratic engagement among citizens who face mass repressions in the authoritarian regime in Belarus.\n\nTsimafei also coordinates the Honest University project, which actively involves over 2000 student activists in meaningful civic participation in Belarus while considering the security risks.\n\nAfter completing his studies at the Oxford Internet Institute, Tsimafei intends to return to his work in Belarusian civil society, where he will continue contributing to the ongoing struggle for democracy and human rights in his home country.\n\nMasters of Business Administration\n\nVladyslava is a Product Manager from Ukraine.\n\nShe earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Chinese Literature from the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and lived for two terms in China while attending exchange programmes at Peking University and Nankai University. During her time in China, she ventured into entrepreneurship and successfully established a company dedicated to assisting small and medium-sized Ukrainian enterprises in sourcing products from China.\n\nThe company provided help with services such as negotiations, logistics, market-fit research, product inspection, and sampling. After graduation, Vladyslava pursued the postgraduate programme called the Young India Fellowship in India and worked at a Bengaluru-based robotics startup that specialises in building autonomous cooking robots for households.\n\nIn India, Vladyslava also actively engaged herself in animal welfare initiatives, organising rescue and birth control efforts for stray dogs and cats in her community.\n\nFollowing her time at Oxford, Vladyslava aspires to return to Ukraine and contribute towards the development of Ukraine’s post-war economy by building sustainable businesses.\n\nMSc Environmental Change and Management\n\nSmriti graduated with a degree in Environmental Studies and Public Policy from FLAME University, India. She loves being on the field, engaging with issues on the ground, and making this information accessible.\n\nSmriti has worked in the Trans Himalayan region, Nicobar Islands, and on the Konkan Coast, where she studied human-bear, agriculture-macaque, and turtle-fisher interactions respectively.\n\nAt the Centre for Knowledge Alternatives, Smriti led the efforts of formulating and building India’s first district-level statistics and culture repository. She has previously interned at Centre for Policy Research, Dakshin Foundation, and Centre for Environment Education where she worked on different aspects of environmental legislation and grievance redressal mechanisms. Having worked across different geographies in India, Smriti strongly believes in documenting local ecological knowledge for bottoms-up policy actions.\n\nAt Oxford, Smriti looks forward to gaining the tools and knowledge to work on decentralised ecosystem governance and climate policy in India.\n\nMaster of Public Policy\n\nMohamed Salah Ahmed is a public policy practitioner with a BA in Community Development and an MA in Political Science and Public Administration. Prior to joining the Office of National Security, Mohamed worked in the humanitarian space in Somalia.\n\nCurrently, at the presidency he serves as the chief person for the sanctions regime, leading, coordinating, framing and implementing nationwide policies on WAM and the sanctions regime, ranging from efforts to lift the UNSC arms embargo on Somalia to disrupting the smuggling of illicit weapons. Under his realm, he succeeded in operationalising the National WAM strategy through a result-based action plan with a clear baseline and targets, which was aimed at restricting the acquisition of weapons for non-state actors.\n\nUpon completing the MPP, he intends to continue contributing to the improvement of government institutions through effective and practical policy prescriptions for some of the pressing issues Somalia is facing.\n\nMaster of Public Policy\n\nMariana is a Mexican attorney specialising in human rights from the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a fierce advocate for women’s rights. She currently works for the Mexican Federal Judiciary Council, striving to integrate a gender perspective into judicial decisions and combat gender violence.\n\nMariana has also contributed to public policies at the Special Prosecutor’s Office for Crimes of Violence Against Women. In her spare time, she provides pro bono assistance to women affected by violence and hosts a podcast discussing social issues.\n\nMariana’s goal in Oxford is to gain a Master’s in Public Policy to enhance her ability to address complex challenges and contribute to eradicating violence against women through effective public policies in Mexico and Latin America.\n\nMaster of Public Policy\n\nFareed is a Humanitarian Professional from Syria. He studied medicine at Aleppo University, Syria, and International Relations at Hasan Kalyoncu University, Turkey. He works for the international organisation Global Communities as the Co-Lead of the Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Area of Responsibility in northwest Syria.\n\nHe coordinates the humanitarian community’s response to GBV to provide lifesaving assistance to GBV survivors and at-risk women and girls, as well as training field responders and developing policies and guidelines to ensure that GBV is addressed in a contextualised and comprehensive manner.\n\nAt Oxford, he aspires to increase his technical expertise, professional network, and policy analysis skills in order to increase his global impact as a GBV specialist. Fareed plans to return to the Middle East’s humanitarian context to help design gender-sensitive policies in order to stop violence against women and girls and empower them in post-conflict and fragile settings."
