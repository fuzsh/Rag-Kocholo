        "text": "Co-Founder\n\nSuzanne Fehsenfeld co-founded Mara Elephant Project when she saw a need for investing in talented young conservation driven people that were making a difference protecting elephants and their key habitats during her extensive travels throughout Kenya. Originally the founder of the Sidekick Foundation, Inc.® in 2011, Suzie channels her passion for wildlife conservation with both a global and local lens. Globally, Suzie’s commitment prevails through her past work with The Nature Conservancy, Stop Ivory, Tusk Trust and LEWA Conservancy. Locally, in Indiana, she serves as a founder member of the Indianapolis Zoo. Suzie first visited Kenya with her husband Fred Fehsenfeld on their honeymoon in 1989; the beginning of many trips to Kenya for Suzie, which inspired the idea for Mara Elephant Project. The Sidekick Foundation® not only funds Mara Elephant Project but has a vested interest in youth conservation education in Kenya as well as sustainable community development through The Maa Trust.\n\nCo-Founder\n\nRichard Roberts co-founded Mara Elephant Project in 2011 with Suzie Fehensfeld. In 2011, Richard noticed an increase in elephant carcasses and this concern coupled with a tragic incident involving human-elephant conflict that occurred on his doorstep spurred Richard to act. Richard and Suzie teamed up and looked to local experts Mr. Brian Heath and Iain Douglas Hamilton to start a project that made protecting elephants and humans the core of its mission. Thus, Mara Elephant Project was born, and Marc Goss came on board to lead the first rapid response team. In 2000, together with his partner Liz, Richard created Richard’s Camp and in his role as owner, he secured key funding for MEP and participated in the growth of the organization from a single team to a world-class organization. Richard’s Camp served as the traveler’s first introduction to the Mara Elephant Project and to at-risk ecosystem conservation in general. Born in Kenya and raised in the Maasai Mara, Richard shared an inspiring knowledge and love of the local people, the wildlife and the beauty within this amazing area of the world. His lifetime of work in Africa led to significant accomplishments in the areas of habitat protection and wildlife conservation until his tragic death on August 17, 2019. Richard left behind Liz, and their children, and the rest of the Roberts family, who carry on his legacy through Richard’s Camp. Richard loved all creatures and by sharing this love for wildlife and wild spaces people gravitated toward him to join him on this most important journey to protect the Maasai Mara.\n\nH.S.H. Princess Marie of Liechtenstein is Mara Elephant Project’s first Global Patron. In her role, Princess Marie will focus on expanding MEP’s brand and influence internationally to bolster the impact of a world-class conservation organization. It’s a natural role for Marie as she leads The Prince of Liechtenstein Winery and focuses on expanding their influence internationally. Marie is bringing her experience in marketing and public relations into her position as Global Patron. She was an original employee of Bismark Media Communications, now BPCM, the premier fashion PR firm in New York City. She grew up traveling to Kenya with her family after her mother visited Kenya in the 60s and established a home in the Shimba Hills next door to MEP CEO Marc Goss’ late father Ted. “I have been traveling to Kenya for many, many years and have forged strong relationships and friendships there. MEP in particular was a conduit for me into a deeper understanding of Kenya, its people and their determination to protect their natural heritage. I am truly honored and willingly accept this patronage. Together with the Trustees and staff, I hope we can have a life-long sustainable impact in the Mara for the communities and the beneficiary of all our work, the elephants,” said Marie. Having grown up as neighbors, Marie and Marc stayed in touch, and Marie’s love of elephants and their family connection made this position a natural fit. Princess Marie and her husband Prince Constantin have three children and they split their time between Austria, Kenya and Liechtenstein.\n\nMEp image ambassador & resident photographer\n\nJeffrey Wu is a Canadian professional wildlife and nature photographer accredited by Professional Photographers of Canada (PPOC).
