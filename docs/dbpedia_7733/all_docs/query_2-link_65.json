        "text": "The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a famously selective school. No fewer than 97 Nobel Laureates feature among the prestigious group of MIT notable alumni, and its business school, MIT Sloan School of Management, is just as prestigious.\n\nThe Sloan Fellowship, an accelerated MBA-like program, has welcomed the likes of Nobel Peace Prize winner Kofi Annan, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company William Clay Ford Jr, and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina—the first woman to lead a Fortune top-20 company—and the graduates of the MIT MBA are just as impressive.\n\nWith a program ranked among the best MBAs in the USA, the average MIT Sloan MBA more than doubles their salary post-graduation, and many go on to be leaders in their fields.\n\nHere are 10 of the most successful MBA grads from MIT Sloan:\n\nMIT Sloan Notable Alumni\n\nCheck out our other lists of notable alumni\n\nStanford University Notable Alumni\n\nWharton School Notable Alumni\n\nHarvard Business School Notable Alumni\n\nIndian School of Business Notable Alumni\n\n1. John W Thompson\n\nMBA Class of 1983\n\nChairman of Microsoft since 2014\n\nThompson got his start at IBM, moving up the ranks over a nearly 30-year career at the corporation. It was during this time that he undertook the MBA at Sloan, before leaving to become CEO of Symantec in 1999.\n\nHe succeeded Bill Gates as chairman of Microsoft in 2014, a position he still holds today, and is widely recognised as one of the pioneering businessmen of Silicon Valley.\n\n2. Robin Chase\n\n(© International Transport Forum, used under this license)\n\nMBA Class of 1986\n\nCo-founder and former CEO of Zipcar\n\nRobin Chase met her Zipcar co-founder Antje Danielson in the late 1990s when their children attended the same kindergarten.\n\nThough their working relationship swiftly soured, with Danielson leaving the company in 2001 and Chase being replaced as CEO in 2003, founding the company was the start of what has proven to be a long and successful entrepreneurial career.\n\nAs well as Zipcar, Chase has also founded Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car sharing service, as well as vehicle network communications company Veniam, for which she is still executive chairman. She was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2009.\n\n3.

During this time he led the effort to protect their annual pay per click revenue from click fraud, was one of the early product managers for AdSense, and served as part of the team that launched Gmail.\n\nAfter his MBA at Sloan he decided to leave Google in 2010 to grow his nonprofit TeachAIDS, an Edtech company using technology to aid HIV prevention. He is also the current global head of artificial intelligence at F5.\n\n4. Brian Halligan\n\nMBA Class of 2005\n\nCEO and co-founder of HubSpot\n\nHalligan co-founded inbound marketing company HubSpot in 2006, a year after graduating from MIT Sloan.\n\nBy 2016, the company reported $271 million in total revenue, and Halligan is now a senior lecturer at MIT, teaching technical innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic management.\n\n(© HubSpot, used under this license)\n\n5.

Under Morey’s leadership, the Rockets advanced to the playoffs nine times.\n\nMorey is still involved with his old alma mater, serving as the cofounder and co-chair of the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference.\n\n8. Keiji Tachikawa\n\n© NASA/Kim Shiflett\n\nMBA 1978\n\nPresident of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)\n\nHailing from the same MBA graduating class as Jamie McCourt, Tachikawa was brought in to restructure the Japanese space agency after a 2003 H-IIA rocket launch failure, after which the company promised to resume launches in 2005.\n\n9.
