        "text": "How MIT Sloan Got Its Name: The Real Story Behind the Naming Did you happen to know? The MIT Sloan School of Management owes its name to the Sloan Programs (MIT Sloan Fellows MBA/MS, Stanford Sloan MSx and LBS Sloan MSc), not vice versa. Here’s how it happened: In the early 20th century, Alfred P. Sloan, the legendary leader of General Motors, faced a significant challenge: his engineers needed more managerial skills. To address this, Sloan collaborated with MIT’s Erwin H. Schell to create the 1st* university-based full-time executive education program in 1931, the Sloan Fellows Program. Sloan's vision continued. Recognizing the broader need for management education, he endowed MIT with $5.25 million through the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which led to the establishment of the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1952. So next time someone mentions the MIT Sloan School of Management, remember: it’s named after the groundbreaking Sloan Programs, of which the very first was created at MIT to turn GM engineers into top-tier managers. MiM programs are for graduate students to set sail for their careers, Full-time MBA programs are for junior management career transitions, and Executive MBA programs are mainly for accelerations to mid-level management posts. The Sloan programs have multiple purposes but are mainly for mid-to-senior leadership preparations. By Alfred P. Sloan’s design back in 1930, MIT Sloan aims to prepare mid-career engineering managers for senior positions. The Stanford Sloan MSx program is designed for experienced emerging leaders transitioning to mid-level roles, particularly in technology and entrepreneurship. The LBS Sloan program is targeted at senior executives looking to accelerate into senior management team and C-suite roles, as well as other top management positions such as Board of Directors, non-executive directors, and senior advisors. * The world's first part-time Executive MBA was launched at the University of Chicago in 1943, while the full-time Sloan Fellows began teaching in 1931. #ManagementHistory #BusinessEducation #Leadership #Innovation #MIT #GM #SloanPrograms #MBA #EMBA #ExecutiveMBA #ExecutiveEducation #SloanFellows #ManagementEducation #LBS #Stanford #MIT Stanford University Stanford University Graduate School of Business London Business School\n\nHere is a day in the life of MIT, the #1 ranked school in the world according to the 2024 QS World University Rankings.

I used this quarter to delve more into Product Management, and to gain new perspectives in Organizational Strategy, two areas that I hope to combine in future endeavors and projects. Kellogg's 'high-impact, low-ego' mantra, its focus on fostering teamwork and its lively atmosphere were some of the reasons I landed here. And expectations were highly exceeded. I was offered the whole range of MBA courses to participate, and I think I could not have made better choices than the ones I made. This was possible thanks to the amazing professors I had. Birju Shah, Niko Matouschek, Michal Maimaran, Craig Wortmann, Jodi Glickman, Paul Leinwand, Cesare R. Mainardi, each of you contributed from your own fields to broaden my knowledge, and that is something I will always be grateful for. With this picture in one of study rooms after my final exam, I mark the completion of my MBA journey. Now, let's get back to business.\n\nExcited to share that I've officially graduated with my MBA from the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University!
