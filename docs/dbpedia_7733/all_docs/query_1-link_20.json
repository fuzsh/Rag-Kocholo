        "text": "I am thrilled to announce my graduation from the Executive MBA program at MIT Sloan School of Management! This journey has been a rigorous test of balancing a demanding M&A role at The Coca-Cola Company with an academically challenging curriculum of MIT. Often, I had to pinch myself to make sure I was not dreaming when I was in classes with some of world’s best professors - and with a cohort of highly successful professionals! The MBA program not only had a great curriculum (incl. system dynamics, strategy, marketing, financial management, corporate boards, negotiation, organizational theory, entrepreneurship etc.), but also pushed me to constantly practice my leadership skills and to apply my learnings when I was getting back to work on Monday after the weekends on MIT campus. In addition to the program, I’ve learned a lot from my exceptional cohort – I never saw so many smart, ambitious, capable, and extremely kind and humble people in one room! Many of them became my friends, hopefully, for life. I am very thankful to everyone at The Coca-Cola Company who supported me throughout this challenge and motivated me to strive for more. I am even more grateful to my family and friends for their understanding, love, and encouragement. The experience of juggling an MBA at the world’s best university with a highly demanding job stretched my limits, taught me the value of perseverance, friendship, and trust, and equipped me with advanced knowledge and skills. One of my main take-aways from the program is the confidence that I can and should make a positive impact on my organization, community, and world. So now, after taking a few quick breaths, I am up for the next challenge! #MIT #MITExecutiveMBA #HarvardUniversity #Leadership #MergersAndAcquisitions #Strategy #Innovation #Thankful #NextChallenge"
