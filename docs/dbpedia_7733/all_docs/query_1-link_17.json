His main focus over the past decade is on scaling and leading at scale—how to grow organizations, spread good things (and remove bad things) in teams and organizations, and enhance performance, innovation, and well-being in organizations as they become larger, more complex, and older.\n\nSutton received his PhD in organizational psychology from the University of Michigan and has served on the Stanford faculty since 1983. At Stanford, Sutton is co-founder and former co-director of the Center for Work, Technology and Organization, co-founder of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, and co-founder of the “d.school,” a multi-disciplinary program that helps people, teams, and organizations reach their creative potential. He has served on the editorial boards of numerous scholarly publications, and as an editor for the Administrative Science Quarterly and Research in Organizational Behavior.\n\nSutton has published eight books and two edited volumes. These include The Knowing-Doing Gap (with Jeffrey Pfeffer) (Harvard Business School Press, 2000), Weird Ideas That Work, Hard Facts, Dangerous Half-Truths and Total Nonsense (with Jeffrey Pfeffer) (Harvard Business Review Press, 2006), The No Asshole Rule (A New York Times bestseller) (Business Plus, 2007), Good Boss, Bad Boss (A New York Times bestseller) (Balance, 2012), Scaling-Up Excellence (with Huggy Rao, a Wall Street Journal bestseller) (Crown Publishing, 2014) and The Asshole Survival Guide (Harper Business, 2018). Sutton and Huggy Rao’s latest book is The Friction Project: How Smart Leaders Make the Right Things Easier and the Wrong Things Harder (St. Martin’s Press, 2024). It unpacks insights from their a seven-year project that used academic research, case studies, classes and workshops, and ongoing dialog with scholars, executives, and innovators to learn how smart organizations remove bad friction and inject good friction and do it without driving employees and customers crazy.\n\nSutton is currently a faculty fellow at CASBS, and was a fellow in 1986-87, 1994-95, and 2002-03. His personal website is bobsutton.net.\n\nKabir Tambar is currently completing a book manuscript on languages of solidarity in the Middle East. The work centers on an early twentieth century moment when revolutionary dreams of inter-religious brotherhood and equality in the framework of the late Ottoman empire collapsed. This collapse was occasioned by a history of genocide, dispossession, and rising ethnonationalism. The book examines non-nationalist responses to the violence of those years, and in particular it studies how certain practices that had been central to the now failed horizons of revolutionary solidarity – practices of collective mourning, translation, and historical criticism – persisted for certain Ottoman Greek and Ottoman Armenian figures of the era. Tabar suggests that by attending more closely to the politics of friendship in this moment we can become more attentive to non-national political possibilities that persist even today.\n\nTambar is associate professor of anthropology at Stanford University. His research and teaching examine debates about secularism, minority recognition, and state violence primarily in Turkey and more broadly in Europe and the Middle East. He is a faculty fellow at CASBS and was a fellow in 2023-24.\n\nFred Turner is Harry and Norman Chandler Professor of Communication at Stanford University, where he studies the impact of new media technologies on American culture from World War II to the present. He is currently exploring ways that feminist and queer artists took up photography and electronic media in the late 1970s and early 1980s with an eye to understanding how changes in media technology shaped the origins of today’s culture wars. Turner is the author of five books, including From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism (University of Chicago Press, 2008), and its prequel, The Democratic Surround: Multimedia and American Liberalism from World War II to the Psychedelic Sixties (University of Chicago Press, 2013). Most recently he and photographer Mary Beth Meehan co-created the award-winning collection of images and essays Seeing Silicon Valley: Life Inside a Fraying America (University of Chicago Press, 2021). He has been a Guggenheim Fellow, a LeBoff Distinguished Visiting Scholar at New York University, a Beaverbrook Visiting Scholar at McGill University, and twice a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford (2007-2008 and 2014-2015). Before becoming a professor, he worked as a journalist for ten years. His recent writing has appeared in a variety of venues, including Harper’s, The New York Times Magazine, The American Prospect, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and Die Zeit. Turner is a faculty fellow at CASBS.\n\nAbraham Verghese MD, a CASBS faculty fellow since 2017-18, is a clinician and heads the Stanford Presence Center, which focuses on the human connection in medicine. Housed within the Stanford School of Medicine, Presence seeks to add the social science dimensions to a multidisciplinary focus on balancing high touch and high tech for the equitable and inclusive experience of medicine. Their research aims include: understanding the human experience of patients, physicians and caregivers and how it relates to medical error and outcomes; and how to leverage technology for the human experience of medicine. Past fruitful collaborations with CASBS fellows have utilized insights from sociology, psychology, political science, organizational economics, and other disciplines to further projects at Presence. Verghese’s non-medical writing has appeared in the New Yorker, the New York Times, Granta, the Atlantic, and other venues. His novel Cutting for Stone (Knopf, 2009) spent over 100 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list.
