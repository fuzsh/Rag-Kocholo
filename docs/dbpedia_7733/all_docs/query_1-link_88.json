        "text": "Technical universities in America attract more and more students. The popularity of the direction is due to the development of technology, the rapid development of robotics, information technology. One of the most popular among universities with a world-wide name, rightly considered MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) got its name because of the location (Massachusetts in the US). He is famous for being an innovator in the field of development of artificial intelligence, information technology and robotics.\n\nTechnical universities in USA attract more students. The popularity of the direction is due to the development of technology, the rapid development of robotics, information technology. One of the most popular among universities with a world-wide name, rightly considered MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) got its name because of the location (Massachusetts in the US). He is famous for being an innovator in the field of development of artificial intelligence, information technology and robotics.\n\nA short tour of the history pages of MIT\n\nThe date of the founding of the Institute is only two days more like the beginning of the civil war in the USA, namely, April 10, 1861. The first president of MIT-a - William Barton Rogers, was not only the man who owned the idea of â€‹â€‹creating the institute, but also a well-known professor of natural philosophy. At the heart of his idea was the introduction of new, more modern methods of teaching students, motivating it with obsolescence of old principles, their differences with the real economic situation and the development of technology. Since the foundation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and before the beginning of the classes, it has been 4 years. The first location of the university was the district of Boston Back Bay, after which, in 1916, it was decided to move the institute to Cambridge. From the very first years of its academic activity, the MIT differed from its competitors in practical direction in terms of engineering. Hence the symbol of the institute - beaver, whose talents for the construction of structures from wood, speak of natural leadership in engineering. Innovation of the Institute for a century and a half manifested itself in such directions as:\n\nEngineering;\n\nHigh tech;\n\nArtificial intelligence (merits of modern representatives of the university).\n\nDuring the civil war in America, the MIT turned into a kind of platform for testing in the military sphere. The Cold War period did not go so well for the university, because, because of strikes by students demanding the cessation of military development, the institute took an anti-defense stance. It's only from the government side that such a decision by the management of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did not provoke approval, which was manifested in a sharp reduction in budget expenditures for the maintenance of the institution. But to become the world's leading university in the field of engineering, these events did not prevent MIT.\n\nFeatures of infrastructure and geographical location\n\nAs mentioned earlier, for over 100 years the institute is located in Cambridge, spread out on 168 acres of land along the Charles River. This city is considered a student city, famous for its friendly population, a lot of places for cultural recreation (parks, squares). Extremely popular among local residents enjoys an environmentally friendly mode of transport - bicycles. The connection of the city with the nearest megacities is provided by the presence of transport connections: the railway, bus routes.\n\nThe institute town has been actively developed since the \"moving\" of the institute in 1916, at this time most of the buildings that still function have been built. In the early 2000s, several new buildings were erected, thanks to the works of architects:\n\nFrank Gehry;\n\nStephen Hall;\n\nFumihiko Maki.\n\nThese buildings were built on the campus, which not only renewed it, but also added fresh insights into design and architecture. Step accessibility between laboratories, educational centers, sports halls and other places of the educational process and extracurricular sections reduces the time wasted on movement. For residence students were allocated 11 residences to choose from in Cambridge or Boston. Attention is drawn to the fact that the campus residences and buildings on the campus have a link between themselves, represented by a network of underground tunnels.\n\nAchievements of MIT in the field of science\n\nIn fact, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is not simply considered the best in the field of engineering and high technology. He is followed by a number of achievements, including:\n\nThe creation of a rover equipped in such a way as to be able to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, the launch of which is planned in 2020.\n\nSpecial material was developed by scientists in 2014. It consisted of foam and wax, and the main feature is the possibility of transition from one state to another, and vice versa (from solid to liquid and back).\n\nThanks to the efforts of MIT scientists, vision correction became possible without wearing glasses, using a special stereoscreen.\n\nAt present, scientists are developing methods that allow the transfer of electricity without the use of wires.\n\nThey are also working on the creation of the so-called \"smart\" military form for the land units of the US Army, using microscopic fibers capable of detecting light, heat and sending signals.\n\nThis list is far from complete, and it can be continued for a long time. After all, it is here that the development of dark matter and a number of other entertaining technologies that can have a serious impact on the development of mankind as a whole.\n\nInteresting facts about MIT\n\nThe story with student Oliver Smoot, whose height was taken as a unit of measure, draws with his extraordinary character, when calculating the length of the Harvard Bridge. And it happened this way: a group of students began to move Oliver across the bridge leaving notes (in history they entered as mark-ups). As a result, they determined that the length of the bridge is 364.4 distemper and ear. The case is unusual, and yet it has borne fruit: albeit rarely, but this unit of measurement (analogous to the usual 1.7 meters) is still used and after almost 70 years. The above-mentioned protagonist of history soon became the head of the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nJohn Forbes Nash Jr., a Nobel laureate, a well-known mathematician, was active in the Institute. His life story was reflected in the famous film \"Mind Games\" by Ron Howard.\n\nOnly two people in the history of the institute received honorary degrees: Winston Churchill and Salam Rushdie. The policy of MIT is aimed at the fact that they are proud of the opportunity to finish their studies at the university, which is considered a great honor.\n\nSuch a widely known term \"hacker\" was born in the walls of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This term was applicable to students who quickly found the possibility of solving the tasks posed, at the same time without grace and originality - in other words, by the way.\n\nThere is an opportunity to receive free of charge knowledge, thanks to the public publication of lecture courses from MIT teachers on the pages of the official website.\n\nFaculty of Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nBachelor's programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provide for the possibility of studying 46 basic and 49 additional disciplines. The Institute includes 32 departments, a college, as well as five schools, including:\n\nArchitecture and planning;\n\nManagement;\n\nSocial and Human Sciences and Arts;\n\nScientific;\n\nEngineering.\n\nThe last of the above list, the school has managed to become the most popular, and the numbers speak for themselves - 60% of the total number of students study here. 20% of students prefer scientific school. As for the popular directions in teaching, here are distinguished physicists, computer science, electronic engineering, biology and mathematics.\n\nWhat are the student support programs in MIT?\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology prides itself on selecting students solely for their personal qualities, such as: the level of knowledge, the desire to receive education and to develop, and not by the size of the bank account. Moreover, they offer assistance to students who do not have the opportunity to pay for education, and the proportion of such 58%, and the annual scholarship is 41,000 dollars. This amount is determined taking into account such factors as: the financial situation of the student, merits before the institute, academic success. Funds for supporting students are not only allocated by the university itself, but also by private and public organizations.\n\nStudents at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology claim to receive grants both federal (up to $ 4,000 a year) and Pell Grant (up to $ 5,500). Among the popular programs in which students and teachers compete for grants are:\n\nThe Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant (here, assistant instructors from among students participate);\n\nSEOG - federal assistance to students, where the sum of the city is from 100 to 4000 dollars a year.\n\nBut not only students have the opportunity to receive financial support while passing the education within the walls of MIT. Graduate students who conduct research or are engaged in teaching at the institute can apply for a higher stipend. Invest in promising graduate students for the most part, alternative funds, IT corporations or research companies, looking for employees. The amount of support for future academics varies, ranging from $ 15,000 to $ 65,000 a year. Some of the post-graduate students include the university itself, paying the tuition fee for students receiving education in the curriculum with a degree of \"bachelor\", as well as for conducting tutoring courses.\n\nMaster's Degree in Business Administration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDespite the profile of the institute - engineering, economists here pay attention not less. It's no secret that Sloan School (School of Management) is a member of the most prestigious business schools in the world. The diplomas awarded to bachelors and masters here are highly appreciated by employers, including large corporations around the world.\n\nIt's rather difficult to enroll in the Sloan School at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because the priority is not those applicants who barely managed to graduate from school, but have solid experience in business and management, who have positive recommendations from reputable employers or academics. In addition, confidence and a certain amount of experience and knowledge will be a bonus when conducting a personal interview - one of the most important stages of admission. Tuition fee here is about $ 63,000 per year - within the framework of the classical MBA program.\n\nTuition free of charge at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nExactly as with admission, and in the right to apply for grants and grants, all are equal - both US citizens and foreign students. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is proud that its doors are open to all those applicants who have the talent for education and have the prospect of making progress in science. It is appreciated the ability of a person to think, going beyond the standards, and at the same time be able to get out of difficult situations in an original way.\n\nAs an excuse for a student to receive a scholarship, a low level of income for members of his family (less than $ 60,000 per year) can act. In case the student is really talented, but does not have the opportunity to pay for his own education, the institute will do it instead of him, providing the opportunity to study for free, to live in a hostel (free of charge). In addition, those who are approved for material assistance, are given the opportunity to travel and eat free of charge. To be heard, the student needs to confirm his right to receive material assistance by providing a package of documents: a certificate of the parents' income and an extract from the bank about the status of the accounts.\n\nProspects for graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe authority of the university on the international arena opens serious opportunities for its graduates. Large organizations, research centers and laboratories are happy to receive them among their employees, providing prestigious work and a serious income level. According to statistics, about 25% of graduates are provided with a place of work, even without graduating from an educational institution. This opportunity is realized thanks to the recruitment service, functioning in the Institute, as well as proposals coming from sponsors. Another 20% of graduates receive jobs due to various network sites, participation in professional conferences. About 15% of students graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology students, acquire the desired positions through internships. At their passage, companies and organizations select prospective employees, and immediately after they receive a scientific degree enrolled in the state. The vacancy fair allows you to get another 15% of graduates. The remaining 35% of graduates, after receiving bachelor's degrees, continue their studies in an effort to obtain a master's degree.\n\nAnnual salaries of graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology:\n\nBachelors - 74 000 USD;\n\nMasters - 85, 600 USD;\n\nMaster of Engineering - 95 000 USD;\n\nMasters in Business Administration - 125 000 USD;\n\nAnnually, depending on the state of the economy, salaries can be changed to a greater extent, less often - to a smaller one. Graduates of MIT can be found among employees of such companies as Google, Apple, Oracle, Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon and many other serious corporations. Graduate students often receive proposals for employment within the walls of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard and Stanford.\n\nFamous graduates of MIT\n\nGraduates, who achieved serious success in the fields of science, political and economic activity, are proud of universities. Among the graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, you can list:\n\nKofi Annan, a prominent figure in the public and political arena. He received the Nobel Prize for his achievements, and also became the seventh secretary of the UN.\n\nDavid Scott, who was an astronaut, led the expedition of \"Apollo 15\" to the moon, going down in history as one of 12 people who visited this satellite of the Earth.\n\nThe Nobel Prize in 1993 was awarded to another distinguished MIT graduate, Philip Sharp, who was famous for discovering the intermittent structure of the gene.\n\nKnown for his ability to apply the practical skills of an engineer, coupled with his entrepreneurial abilities, Robert Noyce, co-founded Intel, a world-renowned company specializing in IT technologies.\n\nIn the world of cinema, the representative of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Dolph Lundgren achieved not small successes, being not only an actor, but also a producer, director and screenwriter. With all his merits in the field of art, this man is a master of martial arts.\n\nProminent scientists, honored figures and politicians were released from the walls of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology quite a lot to glorify the university. Every year, about 4,000 foreign applicants file documents, with the hope of admission. But in fact, about 150 people are selected who are given serious requirements in terms of knowledge of English at a high level, not only verbal, but also written.\n\nA foreigner is required, like a US citizen, to demonstrate high performance in the results of testing ACT or SAT. After acquaintance with the documents provided by the applicant (motivation letter, ESSE), the admission committee makes a decision to conduct an interview with the candidate."
