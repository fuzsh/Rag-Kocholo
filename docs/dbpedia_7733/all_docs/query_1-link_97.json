        "text": "Every year we get hundreds of enquiries from senior applicants with 10+ years of work experience who wish to do an MBA. This pool of applicants has it difficult in the admissions process for the two year MBA program, where the average class work experience is 5 years. Plus, their age (30+years) is also more than the average class age of 28 years. These factors make a two year MBA unviable for senior applicants for several reasons:\n\n1. Being older than class average can mean you are not a right fit in the class.\n\n2. For senior managers who have already risen substantially in the corporate ladder, the class composition may feel less experienced, and therefore be perceived as adding less value.\n\n3. A two year MBA may not be viable given family commitments and other pressures.\n\n4. The opportunity cost of leaving a job for a two year MBA may be too much given your already good position at work.\n\nAt that age and stage, do you really need a two year MBA or a reputed finishing school where you build a great network and round off your business knowledge?\n\nMBA FELLOWS PROGRAM FOR SENIOR APPLICANTS\n\nThe good news is there are specific programs that cater to this applicant pool. For applicants who can travel locally, say within the US or within Europe, there are the Executive MBAs(eMBAs) or the part-time or weekend MBA options. But for senior managers who want an immersive experience, there are some full time, exclusive programs, called MBA Fellowships. These cater to senior managers who are on the cusp of transforming to leadership roles and need that thrust, through business education, to get there faster. Moreover, the class is comprised of CXOs and mid-level managers who are at your level, and hence you have much to learn from them.\n\nIn this three-part series, we present three such Fellowship programs, that are hosted at MIT Sloan, Stanford and London Business School :\n\nMIT SLOAN Fellows Program\n\nWhere would you study if you wish to rub shoulders with the likes of Kofi Annan as your fellow alumni? Its got to be the MIT Sloan Fellows program!\n\nAbout MIT Sloan Fellows Program: Launched in 1930, this one-year fellows program is tailor-made for high potential, mid-career managers who are “enthusiastic to discover new possibilities for innovation and action”, the two themes that are fundamental to MIT Sloan.

The MS courses require the Fellows to complete a thesis in order to graduate. The Sloan Fellowship course that begins in June, builds upon a foundation of management, global leadership and innovation. In addition to the core courses, the Fellows can take between 8 and 10 electives.\n\nClass profile: The class of 2018 has 109 students having an average work experience of 14 years. 84%of the class is international with 42 nationalities represented- 32% of these are from Asia.

Please provide a brief description of your interaction with the applicant and, if applicable, the applicant’s role in your organization. (Maximum word count: 50 words)\n\n2.
