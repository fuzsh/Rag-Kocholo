        "text": "MIT was founded in 1861 and is one of five prestigious universities in the Cambridge area. With some 88 nobel laureates to their credit, itâs not surprising this university pops up often in movies and television programmes.\n\nAstronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan are among grads and microchips, email, GPS, solar power, refined oil and nuclear fission are just a few of the inventions to come out of the school and the brains it houses.\n\nNot only that, but all of this is found in the super popular city of Boston (well, close enough), which offers opportunities post-graduation as well as providing an amazing springboard for travel throughout the US and the world.\n\nAs you would expect, the Career Services department at MIT offers everything you need to succeed - and employers are clearly willing to pay for the expertise MIT grads offer.\n\nOf the masters grads that negotiated their salaries (30.1%), they managed to bring them up by an average of $6927. The 22.6% of those that negotiated their bonus, scored, on average, an extra $12,968.\n\nWhat's it like to live at MIT?\n\nMIT really has it together when it comes to providing a terrific on-campus experience for their international grad students.\n\nThereâs a huge range of on-campus housing options, from single rooms to 4-bedroom apartments, with just about everything in between. And, there are specific residences for grad students traveling with spouses or children.\n\nIn addition to the on-campus housing options (all of which are a short walk to classes and other campus facilities), finding off-campus options is easy with the comprehensive website and database. They even offer assistance in finding potential roommates.\n\nDining on-campus is relatively inexpensive for the area, with several choices of meal plans as well as a number of retail vendors operating throughout campus. Youâll never go hungry here - and, of course, you have all of Boston to explore if you want to try something new.\n\nAlongside a vibrant student activities community, there are multiple fitness centers available - and at least one is open every day of the week. No matter what interests you have, youâre sure to find someone or somewhere to enjoy them.\n\nGetting around is also easy, whether youâre walking through campus or headed out into the city using public transport; youâll never have difficulty getting from point A to point B, even in winter.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT PRODIGY FINANCE LOANS FOR MIT ENGINEERING NOW\n\nHow to get into MIT Engineering\n\nThe acceptance rate for MIT was 7.8% in 2020. So, thereâs no easy way around it, MIT engineering has competitive admissions. Getting in, however, doesnât mean you need to have the best GRE marks out there (though that certainly wonât hurt).\n\nThe school makes no secret that theyâre after applicants who want to get stuck in while thinking outside of the box. Curiosity and collaboration are key, so youâll want to bring aspects of your story that display these traits to the fore in your statement of objectives. (Thatâs MIT speak for the standard Statement of Purpose (SOP) essay.)\n\nBecause the school values independent thinkers that arenât afraid of their ideas - or working with others - itâs not a bad idea to illustrate just how you plan to make a mark on the world while remaining realistic in your goals. And, of course, youâll want to keep these scores in mind when preparing for your standardised tests:\n\nAverage GRE scores: 160 verbal, 165 quantitative, 4.4 analytical writing\n\nMean TOEFL score: 107 iBT"
