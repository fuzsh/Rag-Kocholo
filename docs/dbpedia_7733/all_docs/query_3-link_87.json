        "text": "A few minutes before noon on sunday, Feb. 22, three black Mercedes sedans pulled into the U-shaped driveway of the Baghdad villa in which the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and his staff had been quartered since their arrival in Iraq two days earlier. These were not the same drivers who had taken Annan to his repeated negotiating sessions at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; these were Saddam Hussein's personal drivers, among the very few people permitted to know the Iraqi President's whereabouts. They had come to take the Secretary General to his climactic negotiating session with Saddam. Annan was told that he could take no more than three aides and his bodyguard. He was not told where he was going. He didn't seem fazed;\n\nAnnan never seems fazed. Ahmad Fawzi, the spokesman for Annan's delegation, asked one of the Iraqis where the Secretary General was being taken. ''He looked at me like I was a cockroach,'' Fawzi said later. ''I think he wanted to take me out back and have me shot.''\n\nHere was a moment scripted by Hollywood. Whatever moral romance is associated with Annan's job stems from its essential powerlessness. The Secretary General steps into a situation bristling with menace, armed only with his mandate and his moral authority. He has something of the Pope's spiritual status, but of course he has no church -- no army of believers. He is a small, solitary figure\n\nsilhouetted against a vast backdrop. And here, in Baghdad, Kofi Annan -- ''the soft-spoken, gentle lamb,'' as I heard him once mockingly call himself -- had been whisked off to meet the most evil tyrant on earth.\n\nIn reality, of course, the Secretary General is seldom truly unarmed. In this case, Saddam Hussein knew that the United States stood prepared to bomb his country to kingdom come if he did not open his eight ''presidential sites'' to U.N. weapons inspectors. But Saddam had not submitted so far; no one knew which way the seesaw would tip. The atmosphere at the villa as the Annan caravan sped away was a crackling mixture of helplessness, hope and sleep deprivation. Elisabeth Lindenmayer, who has worked with Annan for many years, paced back and forth for hours, waiting for the Mercedes to pull back into the driveway.\n\nAs it turned out, Annan was only a few minutes away, over at the Republican Presidential Palace, where he met with Saddam for three hours and, while the two men smoked cigars, persuaded him to accept what the Iraqis had said they could not accept -- unlimited access to the eight sites previously designated completely off-limits. At least for a time, Annan had averted the war that only a week earlier seemed almost inevitable. And he had done so without offering anything more than a few symbolic concessions. It might well have been the most dramatic achievement by a Secretary General since the era of Dag Hammarskjold.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
