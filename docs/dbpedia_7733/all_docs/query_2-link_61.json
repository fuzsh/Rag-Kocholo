        "text": "MIT’s Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of MIT is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century.\n\nThe Institute is committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges. MIT is dedicated to providing its students with an education that combines rigorous academic study and the excitement of discovery with the support and intellectual stimulation of a diverse campus community. It also seeks to develop in each member of the MIT community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.\n\nMIT’s Admissions Statistics\n\nAcceptance rate: 4.8%\n\nAverage ACT score: 35 (50% range 34-36)\n\nAverage SAT score composite: 1550 (50% range 1510-1580)\n\nThe institute does not share its matriculants' average GPA, but you can safely conclude that a strong academic background is necessary for admission to MIT. That said, the school does have a holistic admission process\n\nEligibility\n\nMIT accepts international students with around 10% of their student body being non-US citizens from 62 other countries. You should know that MIT has stated that they do not have any school, state, or regional quotas, which means that you are not at any disadvantage if other excellent students from your school or area are also applying. Additionally, they do not consider legacy/alumni relations in the admissions process.\n\nMIT does not post specific requirements for course equivalencies or English-language proficiency. Instead, they have an admissions team dedicated to determining a fair and holistic approach to admitting international students based on their scores relative to other students in their country/educational system.\n\nEnglish proficiency tests are recommended (but not required) if you have no other official way to prove fluency such as English schooling or native-speaking ability via family.\n\nSelection Factors\n\nThe MIT admissions team has thousands of blogs on their website to help you understand the MIT admissions mission and nuances in individual cases. While you should check out the website yourself, we’ve compiled some of the key information below to make it easier for you!\n\nHere’s what you need to get into MIT:\n\nA Solid Academic Background\n\nWhile MIT has a holistic admissions process, it’s important to remember that your grades and scores are a big part of it. MIT does not have a minimum GPA requirement but admitted students’ generally have high SAT and ACT scores. This means that unless you have a uniquely compelling application besides your grades you should be aiming for high scores.\n\nMIT has no standardized test requirement, but if you do choose to submit it, you should make sure that your score is competitive. If you’re hoping to get into college with a low GPA, you should ensure that your other application components, including your SAT scores, are impressive.\n\nCoursework\n\nMIT has a holistic and unique application process meant to find the innovative leaders of tomorrow. However, there are some course requirements you need to know about.\n\nAll students must take the following courses to be admitted to MIT:\n\nTwo semesters of calculus\n\nTwo semesters of calculus-based physics\n\nOne semester of chemistry\n\nOne semester of biology\n\nMIT also is looking for a breadth of other courses in the humanities and social sciences, but don’t have as strict requirements. You can also fulfill these requirements in a number of ways as MIT accepts Advanced Standing Exams and online courses to fulfill these requirements.\n\nAn Alignment with MIT’s Mission\n\nMIT is dedicated to serving the nation and the world, and they are looking for students who want to do the same. Students often assume that this means that you need to have been part of something outstanding like curing a disease, but it’s not about that at all. Admission officers just want to see that you care about making an impact. You can serve your community with volunteer work, by lobbying a senator to amend a bad policy, or by spearheading a fundraising event at your school.\n\nA Passionate, Curious & Creative Mind\n\nOne mistake that students often make is assuming that they need to have a high number of extracurricular activities on their high school resume to be an attractive candidate for colleges. MIT stresses that they look for quality over quantity.\n\nThe admissions officers want to see activities and interests that make sense together. Your activities should show what you care about and that you are curious and passionate about whatever that is. It would also be ideal to show that you have some creative hands-on experience, as it tells the admissions team that you can apply theoretical knowledge to real-world situations.\n\nA Collaborative and Cooperative Spirit\n\nMIT is a famously collaborative school. You can see it in the school’s interdisciplinary research, interdisciplinary majors, and even the undergraduate curriculum which involves several group activities and assignments. So, you should definitely highlight your collaborative efforts and group activities in your application.\n\nYou can showcase this by having a breadth of activities and coursework. Are your coursework and extracurriculars science-focused? Take part in a second-language program. If you’ve excelled in the humanities, take part in a math competition or a science fair to show how well-rounded you are!\n\nMIT’s Admission Process\n\nMIT applicants have the option of applying through Early Action or Regular Action. There is no strategic advantage to using either of the application systems besides peace of mind if you are admitted earlier. The Early Action admission plan does not require you to attend if admitted, unlike with Brown University or Dartmouth.\n\nThe main difference between the two application plans is the dates. As implied by the name, the Early Action plan has an earlier application deadline, and students get a response from the admissions board earlier. Because students do not apply to majors at MIT until they are finished their first year you don’t need to worry about spots filling up in your desired program via early action.\n\nFor both Early Action and Regular Action, the admission process at MIT is very intentional. MIT is not among the many schools that use Common app, so you will need to set aside time to complete their application separately on the MIT application portal. You will need to prepare the following application components:\n\nInterviews at MIT\n\nAfter you submit your application, you may be contacted by an Educational Counselor (EC) to schedule your MIT admissions interview. Most Early Action interviews will take place in November, and most Regular Action interviews will occur in January.\n\nMIT interviews are fairly standard and you can prepare answers to common interview questions like “tell me about yourself” and “what would you contribute to the college community?”. The interviews are usually about an hour-long, but they can range from 30 minutes to two hours long. You will be expected to discuss your application but also your fit specifically at MIT. Make sure you are familiar with the programs and curricula of MIT and why you would excel there. Coming to your interview with concrete examples, such as a specific lab or professor you would like to work with for an undergraduate research experience, is a great way to showcase your drive.\n\nWe recommend that you start preparing for it as soon as you submit your application to avoid being caught off guard. You should review common college admissions interview questions and invest in the services of a school advisor to help you make the most of your interview.\n\nAcceptance and Waitlist Information\n\nApplications must be submitted by November 1st if you’re applying Early Action or Early January if you’re using Regular Action.\n\nOnce you’ve submitted an application, a senior admissions officer will first read it and consider it holistically. If your application is strong, it will then be evaluated by additional admissions officers, who will summarize it for the Admissions Committee. That summary, along with your entire application, will then go to the selection committee, where multiple groups of the other admissions staff and faculty members will weigh in.\n\nEarly Action applicants will get an admissions decision in mid-December, and Regular Action applicants will receive a response in mid-March. Students' applications will either be accepted, waitlisted, or rejected. Admitted students will have until early May to inform MIT of their enrollment decision.\n\nTuition, Funding and Debt\n\nTuition: $61,990\n\nStudent Fees: $406\n\nHousing: $13,060\n\nFood: $7,220\n\nBooks: $910\n\nEstimated Personal Expenses: $2,374\n\nTotal Cost: $85,960\n\nNote that all first-year students are required to live on campus at MIT to build a sense of community. There is some variation in costs for room and board, but MIT uses the maximum total cost above to determine financial aid.\n\nMIT offers a number of scholarships, mainly based on need. Students with a family income of less than $140,000/year will have their tuition fees fully subsidized by MIT. Students with a family income of less than $75,000 will have all expenses covered by MIT.\n\nThe average amount paid by students, including housing and personal expenses, is $12,715 per year which includes scholarships but not loans.\n\nCheck out the MIT’s Financial Services Website for more information.\n\nNotable Programs\n\nMIT's undergraduate curriculum is unique in many ways. It is a rigorous student-centered academic program that gives students a broad and strong foundation with its General Institute Requirements and learn-by-doing approach. It's also arguably the best engineering school in the US.\n\nYou should make sure you are interested and excited about MIT’s curriculum before you apply. Not only will you be at MIT for 4 years, but showcasing a thorough knowledge of the curriculum is a great way to impress the admissions committee.\n\nGeneral Institute Requirements (GIRs)\n\nThe GIRs are MIT's core curriculum. If you've looked into getting into Columbia, you are probably familiar with the idea of core curriculums. Essentially, it is a series of courses that all undergraduates are required to take, regardless of their major or area of study. There are six General Institute Requirements, and they include:\n\nThe First Year\n\nThe structure and forgiving grading system of the first year at MIT also play a role in giving students a strong foundation by easing them into the higher education system. Since MIT students do not have to declare a major or apply to a specific faculty, they get to spend their first year of study exploring their academic interests while taking some of the GIRs. Instead of simply enrolling in classes, students can participate in learning communities built around common interests, dedicated advising, and smaller cohorts. Additionally, during their first term, students are graded differently. They can either pass the class or receive no record of taking it. It is only during their second term at MIT that they will start receiving letter grades.\n\nEventually, students do declare a major. They have the choice between a variety of traditional degrees, interdisciplinary degrees, joint degrees, or double majors. All of which are offered through MIT's five different schools, the School of Architecture and Planning, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, MIT Sloan, the School of Management, School of Science; or the Schwarzman College of Computing.\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\nMIT was one of the first universities in the US to give undergrad students a chance to get some research experience. Their Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) is still going strong today. About 94% of MIT graduating seniors conducted research during their undergraduate years for pay or credit.\n\nGetting research experience in your undergrad is a great way to build a successful resume for medical school or other professional programs.\n\nCampus and Faculty\n\nMIT's campus is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts along the Charles River. It is known for its unique blend of historic and modern architecture and the campus features iconic buildings such as the Great Dome, the Stata Center, and the Green Building. It is home to numerous cutting-edge research facilities, including the MIT Media Lab and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. The MIT campus has elements of being near to a large city while also keeping the “college-town” atmosphere.\n\nNotable Alumni and Faculty\n\nAttending MIT will put you in the same category as many world leaders and innovators. Among the many prolific alumni of MIT are Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, Amar Bose, founder of Bose Corporation, and I. M. Pei, the world-renowned architect. Prominent current faculty members include Noam Chomsky, a leading linguist and philosopher, and Robert Langer, a pioneering biomedical engineer.\n\nContact Information\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology admissions Website\n\nEmail: [email protected]"
