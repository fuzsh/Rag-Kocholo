        "text": "Reaves & Williams Publishing Group (RWPG), headquartered in Cookeville, Tenn. has announced the acquisition of Lewis County Press (LCP), the previous owner of The Current newspaper in Fulton.\n\nReaffirming their commitment to community journalism, Herbert Williams, co-owner, stated, upon acquiring the newspapers, \"The newspaper, whether in print or online, is the soul of the community.\"\n\nClarissa Reaves-Williams, co-owner, who previously served as CEO of Lewis County Press, added, \"I deeply appreciate our incredible team at The Current and all of our newspapers, and am committed to fostering an environment of honest, transparent journalism. In an era when credible information is more critical than ever, we strive to grow our audience and serve our readers with quality community content sourced from trusted and dependable sources.\"\n\n\"We understand that our community needs us, and we need them too â€” whether as the living history\n\ntextbook, or in promoting our local businesses, we are here for our readers, advertisers, and team,\" she added.\n\nA Family-Run Business with Deep Roots\n\nClarissa Reaves-Williams, a seasoned media professional with over 35 years of experience, has\n\nbuilt a reputation for excellence. Herbert Williams, her husband and business partner, has nearly\n\n30 years of business experience. Originally from Williamsburg, KY, and Hyden, KY,\n\nrespectively, Clarissa and Herbert met as college sweethearts at Union Commonwealth\n\nUniversity in Barbourville, KY. Herbert was the first in his family to graduate college. Clarissa\n\nwas a journalism/psychology major with a minor in business, and Herbert was a psychology\n\nmajor with a minor in sociology.\n\nTheir journey has taken them across several states, living in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois,\n\nDelaware, and Florida. They currently own newspapers and businesses in Tennessee, Kentucky,\n\nVirginia, Missouri, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as various websites and podcasts. Clarissa's\n\nfather, Anthony Reaves, was her first exposure to the printing industry as he worked as a\n\npressman and is now retired and enjoying being a pastor of Red Bird Baptist Church. Her\n\nmother, Dr. Carolyn Reaves, is a published author of \"Who's the Girl in the Mirror.\" Clarissa and\n\nHerbert believe in a strong work ethic, taking a stand for those who can't, and always relying on\n\nfaith in God. Both of their families taught them that no matter what your background, you can\n\nachieve your dreams with hard work and perseverance.\n\nClarissa attributes her success to her wonderful team, her husband, great kids, and gives all the\n\ncredit to her Lord and Savior, giving Jesus all the honor, glory, and praise.\n\nDynamic Leadership and Team Integration\n\nTheir son, Cameron, serves as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), enhancing the group's\n\ntechnological capabilities. Cameron states, \"I am excited to bring innovative technology\n\nsolutions to the group and look forward to exploring ways to integrate gaming with journalism.\"\n\nTheir daughter, Bethany, an accomplished marketing strategist and owner of Coffee Fueled\n\nMarketing, will be the Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). Bethany comments, \"I am thrilled to\n\nleverage my experience in brand strategy and influencer marketing to help our clients succeed in\n\na competitive market through creative and innovative solutions.\"\n\nGreg McNutt, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), brings a wealth of financial expertise from his\n\ncompany, Small Biz CFO Solutions. Greg states, \"Joining RWPG presents a fantastic\n\nopportunity to apply my expertise. Clarissa and Herbert encouraged me to start my own business,\n\nand I know we will make a great team.\"\n\nCombining Forces with Hometown Digital Marketing Agency\n\nThe integration of Hometown Digital Marketing Agency, with over 9 years of experience, allows\n\nthe group to offer comprehensive advertising solutions. Herbert Williams states, \"Digital\n\nmarketing and print media work together perfectly to provide a comprehensive solution for our\n\nclients. Hometown Digital Marketing Agency is a leader in the digital arena, and this merger\n\nenables us to offer cutting-edge advanced digital marketing solutions alongside traditional print\n\nmarketing. Their blend of boutique style with in-depth strategy and unique value propositions\n\nhelps them position businesses and brands above the rest.\"\n\nCommitment to Community and Accountability\n\nClarissa and Herbert Williams believe that the most important parts of a newspaper are mirroring\n\nthe community it serves, being a watchdog for the readers, and holding the government\n\naccountable, regardless of party affiliation. Both have long tenures in community involvement.\n\nThey also own Shine Messengers, a Christian-based company and Cookeville Now, which\n\nincludes a YouTube channel and podcast dedicated to uplifting content and community stories.\n\nRWPG: A New Era\n\nThe group of newspapers includes:\n\nï‚· The Current, Fulton, Kentucky and South Fulton, Tennessee\n\nï‚· The Coalfield Progress, Virginia\n\nï‚· The Dickenson Star, Virginia\n\nï‚· The Post, Virginia\n\nï‚· Marlow Review, Oklahoma\n\nï‚· Blackwell Journal Tribune, Oklahoma\n\nï‚· DeWitt Era Enterprise, Arkansas\n\nï‚· Press News Journal, Missouri\n\nï‚· Monroe County Appeal, Missouri\n\nï‚· Ralls County Herald Enterprise, Missouri\n\nï‚· Lamar Democrat, Missouri\n\nThis acquisition reinforces RWPGâ€™s belief in community journalism as the heartbeat of America.\n\nClarissa Williams encourages community journalism newspapers to reach out if they are thinking\n\nabout selling their newspaper, especially if they are looking for a company that values integrity\n\nand celebrates community. Former partners Robert Moulton Ely and Phil Calian commend the\n\nWilliams family for their hard work and determination. Robert Moulton Ely states, \"We always\n\nknew Clarissa would be the perfect successor to lead the company forward. Good luck and best\n\nwishes to Clarissa and Herbert. We hope to read about a media empire built around saved\n\ncommunity newspapers. Phil Calian adds, \"The Williams family exemplifies dedication and\n\nvision, ready to embrace the challenges ahead.\" Patrick Schless, former LCP Partner and CEO of Community Journalism Project (Workbench), expressed his satisfaction with the acquisition: \"As the former CTO of the newspaper group, I am thrilled to see this come to fruition. The Williams family has a deep commitment to\n\ncommunity journalism, and their innovative vision will undoubtedly drive the success of the\n\nnewspapers and digital platforms.\"\n\nInnovative Solutions and Future Growth\n\nReaves & Williams Publishing Group (RWPG) is committed to combining traditional print\n\nmedia with cutting-edge digital strategies to remain at the forefront of the industry, helping\n\nbusinesses achieve their goals through innovative marketing strategies. Their dedication to\n\npreserving the integrity of local news while embracing new technologies sets a strong foundation\n\nfor future growth."
