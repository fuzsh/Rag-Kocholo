Harry Thomason sought the travel business from the early days of the transition, told Mrs. Clinton he could provide the service and President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton provided the access to do so. Harry Thomason maligned the Travel Office employees, as well as Travel Office contractor UltrAir in order to move them out of that office. Thomason's travel business interests posed an inherent conflict with his involvement in Travel Office decisions or any solicitation of business in this area.................. 52 1. Harry Thomason's ownership interest in aviation companies presented inherent conflicts of interest in his seeking Travel Office business.............. 52 2. TRM, Thomason's company, provided service to the Clinton/Gore campaign and sought to capitalize on their association with the new administration...... 53 3.

The Justice Department found that insufficient evidence exists that Thomason performed a Federal function or acted under the supervision of a Federal employee.......................... 77 d.

The chairman was directed to transmit a copy to the Speaker of the House. Introduction In order to establish a baseline for examining the facts compiled by the committee, it is useful to begin with the statements uttered by the President early on in his administration. It is also useful to measure the statements against his deeds. This will provide the public with a proper measure for determining the success of this President in resolving issues in his own backyard--in particular this issue known as ``Travelgate.'' As President Clinton stated himself when this matter first come to light, ``Look at the facts, evaluate the facts, and draw your own conclusions.'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Transcript of remarks by President Clinton, May 21, 1993. ``It will be a great story [firing the Travel Office employees]--Bill Clinton cleaning up the White House.'' --Harry Thomason, May 1993 in a conversation with White House aide Jennifer O'Connor. ``May 12, p.m.--Thomason comes back in DW's [office]--says he bumped into Hillary and she's ready to fire them all that day. --David Watkins notes of May 31, 1993 discussing contacts on the Travel Office. ``Harry says his people can run things better; save money, etc. And besides we need those people out--we need our people in--We need the slots-- . . . Is the real story to be told?'' --David Watkins notes of a conversation with the First Lady on May 14, 1993. ``If we do any kind of report & fail to address these q[uestion]s, press jumps on you wanting to know answers; while if you give answers that aren't fully honest (e.g., nothing re HRC) you risk hugely compounding the problem by getting caught in half- truths. You run risk of turning this into a `coverup'.'' --Todd Stern, co-author of the White House Management Review of the Travel Office firings. ``Defend management decision, thereby defend HRC role whatever it is, was in fact or might have been misperceived to be.'' --Vincent Foster, July 1993. ``Bernie, are you hiding something?'' --Former Deputy Attorney General Philip Heymann in a conversation with Bernard Nussbaum following Nussbaum's refusal to allow law enforcement authorities to review Foster's documents, July 1993. I. Summary Overview Travelgate is a story about the failure of the Clinton White House to live up to the ethical standards expected of the highest office in the land. The wrongdoing of this administration lies not in the firings of the seven Travel Office employees. They served at the pleasure of the President. If the President chose to fire them to reward political cronies, that was his prerogative. And he must reap the consequences. Rather, the wrongdoing occurred after the firings. It resulted from a desire to hide the truth about who actually fired them and why. The committee spent 3\\1/2\\ years investigating not just who fired them and why, but the wrongdoing that followed. The resulting mosaic pieced together from the facts uncovered reveals the answers the White House refused to disclose. In the end, the actions of the Clinton administration following the firings may have a lasting and damaging impact on the Office of the Presidency. The committee has found that the motive for the firings was political cronyism: the President sought to reward his friend, Harry Thomason, with the spoils of the White House travel business. A pretext for the firings was created, and the trigger was pulled. When the public reacted to the firing with outrage, the roles of the President, First Lady and Thomason were minimized as the White House staff engaged in a colossal damage-control effort. First, it had to portray the victims of the firings as the wrongdoers. This was achieved by White House officials unleashing the full powers of the Federal Government against the seven former workers. The extraordinary might of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice--not to mention the prestige of the White House itself--all were brought to bear. These actions constitute a gross abuse of the rights of seven American citizens and their families. Second, an enormous and elaborate cover-up operation, housed in the White House Counsel's Office, sought to prevent numerous investigations from discovering not only the roles of who fired the workers and why, but also their efforts to persecute the victims. In the process, the administration may have severely damaged the credibility and prestige of the White House: it obstructed and frustrated all investigations; it turned the Office of the White House Counsel into a political damage-control operation; it made frivolous claims of executive privilege; it abused its powers to smear innocent citizens; and most important, it failed to level with the American people. As a result, it is the committee's view that the White House stands in contempt of its own constitutional responsibilities to faithfully uphold and execute the Constitution and laws of the Nation. Never before has a President and his staff done so much to cover up improper actions and hinder the public's right to learn the truth. The following chapters reveal the facts that tell this story. A. The White House stonewalled all investigations into the White House Travel Office firings and related matters Three and a half years ago, the friends of Webb Hubbell,\\2\\ David Watkins,\\3\\ Jim and Susan McDougal,\\4\\ Mike Espy,\\5\\ Harold Ickes,\\6\\ Bruce Lindsey,\\7\\ Bernard Nussbaum,\\8\\ Susan Thomases,\\9\\ Jim Guy Tucker,\\10\\ Craig Livingstone,\\11\\ Bill Kennedy,\\12\\ and Dick Morris\\13\\ came to Washington vowing to provide the ``most ethical'' administration in the history of the Republic.\\14\\ One of their first targets in allegedly ``cleaning up'' Washington was the small, tucked-away White House Travel Office, where then-Director Billy Dale had served for over 30 years through eight Presidents and had voted for the new President, William Jefferson Clinton. Before long, Bill Clinton, who campaigned on the mantra, ``I feel your pain,'' caused a great deal of pain in the lives of seven career Government employees as well as countless others caught up in the events known as ``Travelgate.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ The former Associate Attorney General for the Clinton administration convicted of tax evasion and mail fraud for stealing money from clients of the Rose Law Firm which included the Federal Government. \\3\\ The former White House administrator who resigned in May 1994 after using a Presidential helicopter to play golf. The cost of the flight was estimated at more than $13,000. \\4\\ The former business partners and good friends of Bill and Hillary Clinton. James McDougal was convicted in June 1996 on 18 counts of bank fraud and conspiracy. His ex-wife Susan McDougal was convicted in June 1996 on 4 counts of bank fraud and conspiracy. \\5\\ The former Clinton Agriculture Secretary who resigned December 31, 1994, due to potential conflicts of interest relating to his relationship with the poultry industry (specifically Tyson Foods). The appointment of an Independent Counsel in October 1994, spurred Espy's resignation. \\6\\ Currently the White House Deputy Chief of Staff. Ickes was the lawyer for LIUNA (Laborers' International Union of North America), a union investigated by the Justice Department for alleged mob activity. \\7\\ Deputy White House Counsel, close advisor to President Clinton and unindicted co-conspirator in Independent Counsel Starr's prosecution of Arkansas bankers, Hill and Branscum. Lindsey was alleged to have distributed funds from Arkansas Banks for Clinton gubernatorial campaign. \\8\\ The controversial first Clinton White House Counsel who presided over numerous administration debacles, including Travelgate, and resigned in March 1994 following the issuance of numerous Whitewater subpoenas to the White House. \\9\\ Close friend and advisor to Mrs. Clinton. Thomases was allegedly involved in advising Bernard Nussbaum that Mrs. Clinton was concerned about law enforcement officials having ``unfettered access'' to Foster's office following his death. \\10\\ The former Governor of Arkansas who resigned after his conviction for obtaining illegal loans from David Hale. His prison term was suspended pending his good behavior while on probation. \\11\\ The ex-bar bouncer who was brought to the White House to direct the Office of Personnel Security after serving on the Clinton/ Gore campaign as senior consultant on ``counter events operations'' including the ``deployment'' of ``Chicken George.'' Livingstone reportedly hurled racial epithets at a senior aide to Representative Floyd Flake earlier this year and in 1993 threatened to ``punch in'' the face of a female neighbor. Mr. Livingstone resigned in the wake of the FBI files matter while appearing before this committee on June 26, 1996. \\12\\ Former associate counsel who was and is a partner in Mrs. Clinton's former law firm. Mr. Kennedy was Craig Livingstone's boss and distinguished himself by failing to obtain passes for White House officials in a timely fashion and neglecting to report his ``nanny tax'' problem when he joined the White House staff. Mr. Kennedy resigned in November 1994. \\13\\ Resigned from the Clinton/Gore '96 Campaign amidst reports that he had a year-long relationship with a Virginia call girl in his official office/suite at the Jefferson Hotel. Reported to have told $200-an-hour prostitute Sherry Rowlands that a paranoid Mrs. Clinton ordered the FBI files of Republicans for review by the Clinton White House. Mr. Morris claims he was only talking about ``polling data'' which indicated the American people thought Mrs. Clinton was behind the FBI files matter. \\14\\ Bill Clinton 1992 campaign statement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Because the White House has gone to great lengths to prevent this committee from investigating the Travelgate matter, the committee must ask: Why have so many on the Government payroll at the White House worked so hard for so long to keep the real story about the Travel Office firings and related events from the American people? Why, to use the words of a senior White House official, did the President ``run the risk of turning this into a cover-up?'' \\15\\ Why did the President ultimately resort to the most frivolous claim of executive privilege rivaling even the Nixon administration in his determined efforts to delay this investigation and push it into the political season? Why did the White House hide the fact of President Clinton's knowledge of the firings before they occurred? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ Handwritten notes of Deputy Staff Secretary Todd Stern, May 27, 1993, CGEPR 682-683. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight has discovered endless cover-ups hidden within cover-ups. One of President Clinton's lawyers offered a prophetic rationale as to why the White House continues to keep matters under wraps. In typed notes over which President Clinton claimed executive privilege, a White House Counsel tellingly quoted William Safire: No politician is stupid enough to hide something when he has nothing to hide.\\16\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ ``Whitewater Potential Questions'' prepared by White House Counsel's office, DF 781532. The evasiveness with which President Clinton's lawyers have dealt with congressional investigators for more than 3 years presented the committee with the following dilemma: If there really is nothing there, why are the President's lawyers working so hard to hide something? We learned that the lives of seven innocent long-time career Government employees were shattered, their reputations smeared, to make way for the ambitions and arrogance of the President's friends and family. We learned that the FBI and IRS became involved in this matter because of Harry Thomason's false allegations that Travel Office Director Billy Dale received illegal ``kickbacks'' from a charter airline company. The White House knew very quickly that the alleged source of the kickback charges denied ever making them. But upon learning this fact, the White House did nothing to correct the public record it had created through misinformation. In fact, long after President Clinton's White House staff knew the allegations were false, they continued in their efforts to make a case against the beleaguered and increasingly impoverished Billy Dale. The Department of Justice (``DOJ'') case, U.S. v. Billy Ray Dale, was sorely lacking in evidence. It was compromised by missing records that had not been secured by the Clinton White House or the Justice Department. It was obvious, even to Justice Department prosecutors, that they had no witnesses who could provide any derogatory information about Billy Dale. Finally, they were left only with the dubious claim that the notoriously frugal Mr. Dale lived a ``lavish lifestyle.'' The prosecution revealed to the jury the ``scandalous'' evidence that Mrs. Dale went to a hairdresser and purchased large quantities of groceries for the Lake Anne vacation home the two-career Dales saved many years to build and enjoy. Predictably, Dale was acquitted in less than 2 hours by a jury of his peers. Unfortunately, Mr. Dale's speedy acquittal did not put an end to his 3-year ordeal. The IRS pursued Dale, threatening income tax audits. The IRS also was busy in Smyrna, TN auditing the company that did business with Mr. Dale at the Travel Office, UltrAir. Only recently was Mr. Dale given a clean bill of health by the Internal Revenue Service after 3 years of intense scrutiny. UltrAir had no tax liability and an owner of UltrAir received a $5,000 refund before the IRS gave up its search for any shred of evidence to justify its harassment of this small struggling business. We learned that the individual responsible for ``securing'' the Travel Office on the day of the firings and maintaining the records was none other than the now famous ex-bouncer and political operative, Craig Livingstone, former Director of the White House Security Office.\\17\\ Mr. Livingstone was the same individual seen by Secret Service Agent Bruce Abbott removing boxes of documents from the White House the morning after Vince Foster's death in July 1993. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ Committee deposition of Craig Livingstone, March 22, 1996 p. 115. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The much-heralded White House Management Review (hereinafter ``WHMR'') proved to be nothing more than a whitewash overseen by then-Chief of Staff and childhood friend of Bill Clinton, Mack McLarty, the very person who had authorized the Travel Office firings. In the course of the committee investigation, evidence of a vast cover-up of President Clinton's knowledge and dealings with his close friend Harry Thomason as well as his staff's deliberate minimization of Hillary Clinton's role emerged and still continues to unfold. We learned that access does indeed have its privileges. For the seven fired White House Travel Office employees, this meant they had to be moved out of the picture to make way for President Clinton's Hollywood connection, Harry Thomason. The committee obtained evidence that President Clinton personally gave the nod for Harry Thomason to come to the White House to work on the ``Image Project''--not Political Director Rahm Emanuel as has been represented by the White House. We learned that having powerful friends and the same lawyer as President Clinton can make for timid prosecutors.\\18\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ President Clinton's personal defense lawyer, Robert Bennett, who handles the Paula Jones case, also represents ``Friend of Bill'' Harry Thomason in both criminal and civil matters. Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes is another of the colorful clients responsible for monopolizing Bennett's legal dance card. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We learned that a long-hidden memo by a key figure in the Travel Office affair, David Watkins, disclosed that Hillary Clinton, based upon information provided by Harry Thomason, pressured senior White House aides for the firings.\\19\\ Despite President Clinton's misleading press accounts that he knew little about the firings, we learned Bill Clinton actually was briefed on the firings 2 days before they occurred.\\20\\ And then-Assistant to President Clinton for Management and Administration, David Watkins reluctantly became the designated fall guy for the firings in order to protect the higher-ups who had directed his actions. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ Undated memorandum by David Watkins entitled ``Response to Internal White House Travel Office Management Review,'' (otherwise known as the ``Watkins soul-cleansing memo''), White House document production Bates Stamp No. CGE 012286-012294. (Hereinafter document numbers preceded by ``CGE'', ``CGEPR'', or ``DF'' indicate White House documents.) \\20\\ White House Management Review interview notes of Bruce Lindsey, June 9, 1993, CGEPR 331-334. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We learned of the long-hidden notebook kept by Vincent Foster had been in the office of White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum following Mr. Foster's death. The notebook chronicled Mr. Foster's anguish over Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, Harry Thomason's potential criminal liability, and whether the White House scandal containment strategy could be maintained to stop at the level of David Watkins. We learned that Mrs. Clinton directed President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty not to tell President Clinton about the torn up ``suicide'' note found in Vincent Foster's briefcase on July 26th, 6 days after his death. Mrs. Clinton instructed the President's senior aides to wait until a ``coherent position'' was developed before informing the President.\\21\\ The note was essentially an outline of a defense of the Travel Office firings. When it took more than a day to turn the note over to the proper law enforcement authorities, both the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General were so concerned that the Deputy Attorney General immediately initiated an FBI investigation into the delay in turning over the note.\\22\\ In the investigation of the delay, no one mentioned Mrs. Clinton's involvement in reviewing the note or recommending a delay in turning it over.\\23\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ White House debriefing of David Gergen's attorney Andy Krulwich, by Miriam Nemetz, July 13, 1995. The debriefing pertained to David Gergen's deposition before the Senate Whitewater Committee on July 12, 1995, DF 781220-781224. \\22\\ ``Vincent Foster, Jr., Deputy White House Counsel to the President--Victim; 7/20/93,'' by Special Agent Scott M. Salter, 7/29/ 93-8/9/93. The report was made to the Deputy Attorney General who requested the FBI to enter the captioned investigation and to ``focus FBI efforts on the turning over of a note found in the office of Vincent W. Foster.'' \\23\\ Id. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We learned of the existence of a letter long withheld from all investigators which David Watkins wrote to ``Hillary.'' In that letter, Watkins lamented that the GAO revealed conversations that Watkins had with Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Watkins assured Mrs. Clinton that he knew who his ``client'' was and regretted revealing that Mrs. Clinton told him she wanted ``those people out'' and ``our people in.'' \\24\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ Letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton from David Watkins, May 3, 1994, CGE 39294. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- After a long battle to obtain responsive subpoenaed documents, White House Counsel to the President Jack Quinn finally turned over documents one of which led us to discover that hundreds of FBI files of Reagan and Bush officials, including that of former Travel Office Director Billy Dale, were wrongfully requisitioned from the FBI in 1993 and 1994 by two political operatives, Craig Livingstone and his sidekick Anthony Marceca, who had specialized in opposition research for the Democratic Party. We now know that the individual placed by President Clinton in charge of the FBI files was the very same individual whom the White House had put in charge of securing the Travel Office records on the day of the firings--the now infamous security officer, Craig Livingstone. We learned that the White House Counsel's office withheld Billy Dale's FBI background file for months misrepresenting it to the committee as a personnel file, effectively keeping the lid on the Filegate scandal.\\25\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\25\\ Letter from White House Counsel Jack Quinn to Chairman Clinger, June 10, 1996. But see, conflicting testimony by Special Counsel to the President, Jane Sherburne in her committee deposition of July 23, 1996, p. 32. (Although Quinn, in his letter suggests that the White House knew of its possession of the Billy Dale FBI background file-referring to it as a ``personnel file,'' Sherburne, in sworn testimony, stated unequivocally that she did not know of the existence of the file in February of this year.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fact that Craig Livingstone held the fate of Billy Dale and his colleagues in his hands, however, came as no surprise to Mr. Dale. He and his family were subjected to inexcusable, unending indignities by the Clinton White House, hounded by the servile Justice Department and the IRS. Mr. Dale was denied the opportunity to defend himself by a Department of Justice prosecutor who opposed Dale's defense motion to present facts detailing the missing Travel Office records. We know that the prosecutor himself told IRS investigators that records were missing, most likely removed by Presidential cousin Catherine Cornelius, who had designs on running the Travel Office.\\26\\ Why didn't the Justice Department's prosecutor feel he had the same disclosure responsibilities to Mr. Dale as to other Government investigative units? This question never was answered. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\26\\ IRS Agent Bruce Brown's memorandum of his discussion with DOJ Prosecutor Stuart Goldberg, August 16, 1993. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fortunately, Mr. Dale was acquitted despite the actions of the White House and the Justice Department. His colleagues were totally exonerated of any wrongdoing. Nevertheless, to this day, President Clinton continues to malign Mr. Dale and continues to exhibit an unusually thin-skinned response to press inquiries about this matter. In January of this year, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry gave his assurances that President Clinton would sign a bill to reimburse Billy Dale's legal expenses.\\27\\ However, the President recently, and angrily, reneged on that promise.\\28\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\27\\ White House press briefing, January 30, 1996. (Q: ``Would the President . . . sign . . . such a measure, were it to pass?'' McCurry: ``Yes, he would sign it.'') \\28\\ In an August 1, 1996, press conference, Clinton addressed questions regarding his prior commitment to sign a bill, which would reimburse Billy Dale for $500,000 in legal fees Dale incurred in his defense. Clinton angrily declared, ``I never gave my word on that.'' Referring to White House aides who have been asked to give testimony to this and other investigations, he snapped, ``There are a lot of people who were never charged with anything, much less offering to plead guilty to anything . . . Are we going to pay their legal expenses, too?'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Although the committee has been far more successful in uncovering new information to explain these events than has any previous investigation, the disappearance of relevant documents, the selective amnesia among dozens of relevant witnesses and the sustained obstruction orchestrated by President Clinton's stable of White House lawyers, have kept the full story from being told. This continues to be the standard operating procedure of the Clinton White House to this day. B. The full cooperation pledged by the President was a hollow promise \\29\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\29\\ January, 12, 1996, press briefing. (President Clinton, in answer to questions about Republican assertions that the White House has not been cooperative with probes into the Travel Office and Whitewater affairs, stated: ``We're in the cooperation business. That's what we want to do.'' In a July 13, 1993 letter to Jack Brooks, President Clinton stated, ``The Attorney General is in the process of reviewing any matters relating to the Travel Office and you can be assured that the Attorney General will have the Administration's full cooperation in investigating those matters which the Department wishes to review.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The President's promise to cooperate fully with investigations into the Travel Office and related matters never was honored. Requested records never were appropriately provided to the Justice Department or any other investigative body over the course of numerous inquiries--including criminal investigations and the investigation by this committee. Five separate investigations examined various aspects of the Travel Office firings. What all five previous investigations had in common was the White House's success in denying production of relevant documents to each of them. Such sustained obstruction over so long a period of time only could persist if directed from the very ``highest levels.'' The buck stops at the President. While this committee has been far more successful in obtaining relevant records than any other previous investigation, its painstaking efforts have met with obstruction from President Clinton's staff at every turn. As a result, in some areas the committee's investigation is still inconclusive. Since the firings and especially since the 1994 elections, the White House Counsel's office hired a team of lawyers for a major damage control operation which we have concluded focused on withholding from the committee documents related to Harry Thomason, Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton. In January 1995, Congressman Clinger became the chairman of the new House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and announced that a thorough investigation into the growing Travel Office scandal would be undertaken. Three hearings had been held and subpoenas were issued when documents suddenly materialized inside the White House that previously had been subpoenaed by other bodies and requested by the committee. On March 9, 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives by voice vote adopted House Resolution 369 which authorized committee staff to take depositions pursuant to a subpoena in the White House Travel Office matter. The committee has deposed 72 witnesses, informally interviewed 23 witnesses, obtained 58,734 documents from the White House and approximately 45,000 documents from the Justice Department, Treasury Department and other agencies. The committee was determined to ensure that the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt to derail this Travel Office investigation, as it had with every preceding investigation. Unfortunately, the committee found that issuance of subpoenas was not sufficient to ensure the production of all relevant records. It became necessary for the committee to take the rare action, holding White House Counsel John M. Quinn in contempt of Congress on May 9, 1996 by the committee. It was only after scheduling a May 30, 1996, House floor vote on the Resolution that the White House turned over 1,000 pages over which it initially had asserted were ``subject to'' executive privilege. However, the White House continued to withhold 2,000 pages of documents. President Clinton asserted a blanket claim of executive privilege, stalling for time throughout the summer of 1996. The White House Counsel's Office/Chief of Staff's Sherburne ``team'' finally provided the committee with access to the 2,000 pages of overly-redacted documents only when a second threat of a House floor vote on contempt of Congress was made. Only at that point did President Clinton finally relinquish the outstanding subpoenaed documents to the committee on August 15, 1996. A date calculated to attract the least attention from the media as it was the same evening that Senator Dole accepted the Republican nomination for President. Had the committee failed to pursue its right to obtain this information, its investigation would have been severely undermined and we never would have learned the key facts surrounding the termination of the seven Travel Office employees. We likely never would have uncovered the Clinton White House's receipt of hundreds of FBI background files or evidence of the vast White House cover-up of Travelgate and Filegate. C. President Clinton's staff engaged in an unprecedented misuse of executive power and executive privilege From the start, the White House Travel Office matter has reflected a disturbing pattern of misuse of executive power and resistance by the White House to any type of public accountability for highly questionable activities. Ironically, while President Clinton preaches individual responsibility, he assembled a team of taxpayer-funded White House attorneys to evade accountability and avoid responsibility for his actions and those of his staff and advisors. President Clinton created his own personal legal defense team, the likes of which the Office of the President has never before seen. We have learned through documents most reluctantly produced to the committee that President Clinton's White House Counsel routinely engaged in the practice of debriefing witnesses' attorneys after giving sworn testimony. The witnesses, mostly current and former White House staff, included those being deposed by this and other committees as well as those testifying before criminal grand juries. This practice is unprecedented for any White House undergoing an investigation, and may result in the waiver of the attorney-client privilege in matters currently being investigated by the Independent Counsel. In addition, other documents contained in the 2,000 were provided to the committee only after a threat of a congressional criminal contempt vote. These detailed scripts were created by White House Counsel for use by minority members of the committee to thwart this investigation. Such meticulous executive branch scripting for congressional hearings is something even the Nixon White House did not dare to undertake. The information from these debriefings and scripts demonstrates that the White House was privy to information which was inconsistent with public statements made by Clinton officials and even President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton. It became clear that President Clinton ultimately had resorted to a blanket claim of executive privilege over these and other documents which clearly were not covered by any logical reading of the law of the privilege, in a last-ditch effort to forestall the committee's review of relevant documents. D. The consequences of the White House's cover-up have been dramatic to the Travel Office employees, the Foster family, and administration officials in personal, as well as in institutional terms Undeniably, the Travel Office fiasco and the resulting cover-up have had sad and even tragic consequences. They caused irreparable damage to the lives and reputations of seven innocent Travel Office employees, led to numerous thwarted and even obstructed investigations, and it seems clear contributed to the depression and death of one of the central figures in the firings, former Deputy Counsel to the President, Vincent Foster. The White House's reasons for obscuring facts, covering up the initial events and covering up the cover-ups, often were petty or otherwise reflected the vanity of a new administration refusing to admit its mistakes in the matter, or acknowledge inappropriate interference in other areas. In some cases, it was an administration seeking favors for friends that, if implemented, at the very least, would have crossed ethical lines. It is clear that once the ``official'' story was made public, any movement toward the truth brought the threat of damaging legal and political ramifications that the Clinton White House could not afford to risk. The extensive documentary record constructed over the past year has dismantled the White House cover story. The committee sought records of meetings, phone logs, Secret Service logs and White House residence records that were the only way to fill in the missing memories of countless witnesses. While the recollections of witnesses frequently have been implausibly flawed, the documentary record often tells a very different and far more complete story. Finally, it is the President himself who ultimately must be held accountable for this persistent pattern of White House misinformation and misuse of executive power and executive privilege. Given the alarming turnover of key White House operatives over the past 3\\1/2\\ years, only the President himself could have sustained such a pattern of misbehavior. Why has President Clinton tried to keep the true story from being told? A recurring question arises whether the President is above the law--whether the First Lady is above the law. The discrepancies, vagaries and omissions between the ``official'' White House account of these matters and the factual record now properly falls within the scope of the criminal investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, now known as ``Travelgate.'' II. Committee Findings and Recommendations Committee Findings PLANS TO FIRE THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES AND REPLACE THEM WITH CAMPAIGN PERSONNEL WERE IN PLACE FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS OF THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION Efforts to dislodge the longstanding White House Travel Office employees began shortly after the 1992 election and continued throughout the Clinton transition. Presidential cousin Catherine Cornelius, who had worked on travel arrangements for the campaign, teamed up with Arkansas-based travel company World Wide Travel to advocate ``out-sourcing'' the travel operations at the White House. White House Administrator David Watkins met with Cornelius and World Wide representatives several times prior to January 20, 1993, and Cornelius submitted several memos during this timeframe. Meanwhile, World Wide Travel secured the Democratic National Committee business, an account it still holds today. Harry Thomason, whose air charter consulting company Thomason, Richland and Martens, Inc. (TRM) provided services to the Clinton/Gore campaign, spoke with Mrs. Clinton during the transition and pressed his view that the long-time career employees ``should be replaced because they were disloyal.'' \\30\\ Thomason also told President Clinton about allegations of wrongdoing in the Travel Office in March 1993. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\30\\ Notes of White House Associate Counsel Natalie Williams of conversation with Harry Thomason attorney, Amy Sabrin, undated (but most likely from January 1996 timeframe), DF 780464-465. The President exerted a claim of executive privilege over these notes on May 30, 1996 and they were not provided to the committee until August 15, 1996. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- HARRY THOMASON WHO HAD A FINANCIAL STAKE IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS, INSTIGATED THE FIRING OF THE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES. MR. THOMASON HAD PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL STAKES IN ENSURING THAT THE FORMER TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES WERE FIRED WHICH MADE IT CLEARLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO HAVE ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THIS MATTER Harry Thomason was the first person to pass along rumors about the Travel Office employees to Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton. (While Mrs. Clinton has suggested that Vincent Foster may have told her first about the rumors, Foster's own notes indicate that he did not know about the rumors until May 12, 1993, when Watkins and Harry Thomason first approached him. Mrs. Clinton only raised this issue with Foster the following day.) Neither Mrs. Clinton nor anyone in Mrs. Clinton's office could identify any alternative source of the rumors.\\31\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\31\\ See depositions of First Lady's Chief of Staff Maggie Williams, July 29, 1996, and Press Secretary Lisa Caputo, May 14, 1996, and responses to interrogatories from the First Lady of March 21, 1996. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The suggestion by President and Mrs. Clinton that there were ``rumors everywhere'' and Harry Thomason's sworn testimony about ``a buzz in the air'' of wrongdoing in the Travel Office are not consistent with the more than 70 depositions conducted by the committee and dozens of informal interviews. Virtually no one--except those in direct contact with Harry Thomason--heard rumors. The White House Management Review authors confirmed that they discovered no other source of the rumors and their notes make clear that Thomason was the source of the rumors. Both the General Accounting Office review and the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (``OPR'') review concluded that Harry Thomason passed on the rumors to Mrs. Clinton. Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens made efforts to investigate the Travel Office employees in the spring of 1993. Martens had Penny Sample of Air Advantage make calls to UltrAir, the company that had the Travel Office business, and Martens sought out a former UltrAir employee for information. Documents related to these efforts are missing. A March 5, 1993, memo indicated that Darnell Martens was to receive a package from Miami Air and would have a ``complete summary with substantive information'' for Thomason. These documents never were produced to the committee. Harry Thomason contacted David Watkins on April 16, 1993, and passed on rumors of wrongdoing about the Travel Office. According to Watkins' contemporaneous notes, Harry Thomason related the allegations of 5% kickbacks in this conversation.\\32\\ Watkins then relayed this information to Catherine Cornelius and asked her to investigate the office. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\32\\ David Watkins handwritten notes dated April 16, 1993, CGE 29184. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- PRESIDENT CLINTON APPROVED HARRY THOMASON'S ``IMAGE PROJECT'' AT THE WHITE HOUSE, GIVING THOMASON AN ``OFFICIAL STATUS.'' THIS FACILITATED HARRY THOMASON'S EFFORTS TO OBTAIN LUCRATIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS President Clinton, Mack McLarty, George Stephanopoulos, and Mandy Grunwald ``all approved'' the ``White House Project''--Harry Thomason's image project at the White House.\\33\\ Contrary to White House representations that Rahm Emanuel was responsible for bringing Harry Thomason to the White House, Mack McLarty, with President Clinton's approval, authorized Thomason's work at the White House. Emanuel would not have had the authority to bring anyone into the White House in such a fashion. There was a McLarty memo, now missing, that was circulated to senior staff about Thomason's role.\\34\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\33\\ Committee deposition of Todd Stern, May 29, 1996, pp. 38-39. [Note: all committee deposition citations reflect the page(s) of the original deposition transcripts.] \\34\\ Jennifer O'Connor's handwritten notes dated August 18, 1993, identify the memo, CGE 37586; committee deposition of Jennifer O'Connor, March 29, 1996, p. 45. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thomason's White House Project went beyond simple ``image'' issues and he was involved in meetings on how to obtain more money for staffing purposes throughout the White House. The possibility of using excess Presidential inaugural funds for extra staff also was being explored by the White House.\\35\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\35\\ The White House later inappropriately withheld from GAO investigators the page of the White House Project memo which discusses this issue on the grounds that it was a ``political'' issue. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- HARRY THOMASON ABUSED HIS OFFICIAL STATUS AND WHITE HOUSE ACCESS AT A TIME WHEN HE HAD A FINANCIAL STAKE IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS. HARRY THOMASON'S ACTIVITIES AT THE WHITE HOUSE MAKE HIM A SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE TO WHICH THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST LAWS APPLY Darnell Martens, Harry Thomason's partner in his air charter consulting company, TRM, wrote a January 29, 1993 memo to Thomason outlining how they should pursue ``Washington opportunities'' in the early days of the Clinton administration. These opportunities included seeking White House travel business as well as a quarter-of-a-million dollar GSA contract to survey all non-military Government aircraft. Documents provided to this committee and only subsequently provided to the Justice Department, clearly establish that TRM was seeking both Travel Office business and the GSA contract. Darnell Martens, with the assistance of his partner Harry Thomason, contacted Billy Dale in February 1993 seeking the Travel Office business. Martens' post-May 19, 1993, explanations that he was seeking the business on behalf of others, contradicts his own documents of March 5, 1993, in which he advocates that ``the Administration . . . disband the . . . system in favor of the functions being outsourced to TRM/Air Advantage.'' Furthermore, TRM would have stood to benefit from potential commissions as well as business goodwill even if only seeking the contracts for others. On or around February 16-17, 1993, Harry Thomason gave President Clinton a February 11, 1993, memo drafted by Martens soliciting the GSA contract to audit non-military aircraft. At this time, Thomason was working at the White House and staying as a guest in the White House residence.\\36\\ At or around this same time, Harry Thomason first told President Clinton of rumors of wrongdoing in the Travel Office and informed President Clinton he would speak with the appropriate office at the White House about this. President Clinton, fully aware of Thomason's business interests in this area, took no action to discourage Thomason's involvement. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\36\\ See committee deposition of John Podesta, June 5, 1996, p. 23. Podesta was then-Staff Secretary at the White House, testified that he did not see the February 11, 1993, memo go into President Clinton's office but he did see it coming out of his office. Harry Thomason stayed at the residence on February 16 and 17, 1993. Thomason recalls bowling with President Clinton on this occasion--and beating the President--and he is listed in White House residence records but he does not recall whether he passed on the February 11 memo (CGE 2223) on which the President wrote a February 17, 1993, note. Committee deposition of Harry Thomason, May 17, 1993, p. 122. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- President Clinton reviewed the TRM proposal for the GSA contract and set in motion efforts to assist TRM in obtaining Government business by sending a note to Mack McLarty reading: ``Mack/These guys are sharp/shd discuss/w/Panetta/Lader.'' On February 17, 1993, Staff Secretary John Podesta passed along this memo from the President to McLarty, David Watkins and Mark Gearan for ``ACTION.'' \\37\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\37\\ February 17, 1993, buck slip from John Podesta to Mack McLarty, Mark Gearan and David Watkins marked for ``ACTION'' attached to a February 11, 1993, memo from Darnell Martens to Harry Thomason, CGE 02296. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Thomason, who then was working on the White House ``image'' project for the purpose of obtaining good press stories for President Clinton, told David Watkins, Jennifer O'Connor and others that firing the Travel Office employees would be a ``good press story.'' Thus, creating a good news story to bolster President Clinton's image was an objective of the Travel Office firings. This was all done in the course of Thomason's duties in the image project for which even White House Counsel Beth Nolan opined that he was a special Government employee. Mr. Thomason was involved in numerous meetings concerning the Travel Office. Thomason's advice on restaffing a new Travel Office was both offered to Mrs. Clinton and relayed to David Watkins and Catherine Cornelius. Ms. Cornelius was instructed to meet with Thomason about the Travel Office. Thomason tasked Darnell Martens about having Penny Sample come to Washington and the White House to work in the Travel Office. While an SGE for purposes of the imaging project, Thomason independently became an SGE for purposes of the Travel Office by virtue of his integral involvement in these matters. THE WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE, PUBLICLY ACCUSED THE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND MISUSED AND MANIPULATED THE FBI TO FURTHER THEIR POLITICAL AGENDA George Stephanopoulos and Dee Dee Myers relayed wrong information to the press about reasons for the firings and the involvement of the FBI. On May 21, 1993, the FBI again was misused and abused when Stephanopoulos and Myers summoned the FBI Communications Director to in effect come to the White House and take dictation for the FBI press release that the White House wished for, and insisted that the FBI release. After the Travel Office firings were announced and met with great controversy with the press, the White House immediately initiated a disinformation campaign. The White House tried to contain the responsibility for the firings at the level of David Watkins even though his actions undeniably were precipitated by pressures from above. The White House announced the Travel Office firings and claimed they resulted from a Peat Marwick review that had yet to be completed. Peat Marwick representatives then were pressured by the communications office to brief the press and to rush to produce a review corroborating the White House allegations. PRESIDENT CLINTON INAPPROPRIATELY ALLOWED HIS COUSIN CATHERINE CORNELIUS TO REMAIN IN A POSITION WHERE SHE HAD A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. CORNELIUS PURSUED AN INVESTIGATION OF EMPLOYEES OF AN OFFICE IN WHICH SHE COVETED THE TOP JOB AND FOR WHICH SHE PLANNED A REORGANIZATION Once at the White House working for David Watkins, Catherine Cornelius continued her efforts to take over the Travel Office, among other things writing a January 26, 1993, memo and a February 15, 1993, memo co-authored with Clarissa Cerda, designating herself and Cerda as future co-directors of the office. MRS. CLINTON, ACTING ON HARRY THOMASON'S BASELESS ALLEGATIONS OF WRONGDOING AGAINST THE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES, ASSERTED PRESSURE ON SENIOR WHITE HOUSE STAFF TO FIRE THE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES When Harry Thomason arrived at the White House during the week of May 10, 1993, he was anxious to learn what had transpired since he passed on rumors about the Travel Office to David Watkins. Watkins had not yet acted upon Thomason's allegations, so Thomason spoke with Mrs. Clinton about these matters. Mrs. Clinton in turn pressured Mack McLarty, Vince Foster and David Watkins to fire the employees. Thomason also met with Catherine Cornelius to exchange information. Thomason told Jennifer O'Connor about the kickback allegations and told her that the Travel Office employees had been ``ripping us off for years.'' Harry Thomason had numerous contacts with President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton throughout the first half of May 1993, including: calls to the residence private line on May 5 and May 6; phone messages both to and from Mrs. Clinton throughout the week of May 10-14; meetings with President Clinton on the mornings of May 12 and May 13; and a lengthy dinner in the White House residence on the evening of May 13, 1993. Thomason provided incomplete testimony to the committee about the nature of these contacts and exhibited selective memory loss in recounting these meetings. Once Mrs. Clinton's wishes were relayed to Watkins on May 12, Watkins turned to Foster to determine a course of action. Foster tasked Associate Counsel Bill Kennedy to find a solution. Kennedy called the FBI and informed them that the ``highest levels'' of the White House were interested in this matter. On May 14, 1993, Mrs. Clinton, following a lengthy dinner with Harry Thomason the evening before, relayed to David Watkins that ``Harry'' had a ``plan'' for the Travel Office and that ``we need to get those people out'' and ``our people in.'' Harry Thomason continued to press for the firings throughout the day. On May 16, 1993, in a previously undisclosed meeting between Mrs. Clinton and Mack McLarty, Mrs. Clinton pressured McLarty to fire the Travel Office employees. On May 17, 1993, McLarty met with Watkins and told him the Travel Office was on Mrs. Clinton's radar screen. Watkins, responding to pressure from McLarty, Foster and Mrs. Clinton, decided to fire the employees because he thought there ``would be hell to pay'' if he did not accede to the First Family's wishes. McLarty approved the decision and the May 17 memo on the firing was ``cc'd'' to ``Hillary Rodham Clinton'' and faxed to President Clinton in California. Even though it was cited as the basis for the firings, the Peat Marwick review was not completed until May 21, 1993, 2 days following the firings. BILL KENNEDY ABUSED THE FBI BY REPEATEDLY INVOKING THE ``HIGHEST LEVELS'' OF THE WHITE HOUSE IN MEETINGS WITH THE FBI Bill Kennedy sought to and in fact did abuse and compromise the FBI by invoking the ``highest levels'' of the White House in order to involve FBI headquarters officials rather than a field agent as would have been the normal procedure. Mr. Kennedy provided inaccurate and incomplete testimony to this committee and numerous other investigative bodies regarding his statements to the FBI. White House officials hoped to fire the employees on May 13 and drafted talking points on May 13, 1993, discussing the Travel Office firings and claiming an FBI investigation was underway. The FBI, however, could not move that quickly and did not believe it had sufficient predication to launch a criminal fraud audit. The alleged ``predication'' for the FBI investigation was the ``kickback allegation'' relayed to the FBI by Catherine Cornelius.\\38\\ Cornelius obtained this information from Harry Thomason who subsequently had repeated it to numerous other White House staffers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\38\\ OPR Report, tab B: May 13, 1993, FBI e-mail from Richard Wade to Thomas Kubic, subject: White House Travel Office, DOJ document #AZ 000603. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- FBI headquarters never should have been contacted directly on this matter. Such allegations normally would have been handled by a field agent or even the local police. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS COVERED-UP THE REAL REASONS FOR THE FIRING OF THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE EMPLOYEES. THE FIRINGS WERE NOT BASED ON THE PEAT MARWICK REVIEW, BUT RATHER WERE DECIDED BEFORE PEAT MARWICK EXAMINERS EVER SET FOOT IN THE WHITE HOUSE At the very latest, the decision to fire the Travel Office employees was made by May 12, 1993, a full day before the FBI was called to the White House and 2 days before the Peat Marwick review team came to the White House. On May 12, Harry Thomason told David Watkins that he had talked with Mrs. Clinton and she was ``ready to fire them all that day.'' On May 10, Thomason had circulated the memo by Martens outlining allegations of wrongdoing in the Travel Office. The decision to fire was made first; the White House rationale was sought later. THE WHITE HOUSE MISREPRESENTED THE PEAT MARWICK REVIEW. IT WAS NEITHER AN AUDIT NOR INDEPENDENT AND WAS DIRECTED BY A WHITE HOUSE WHICH DID NOT WANT AN AUDIT TO BE CONDUCTED The Peat Marwick employee who was called in to conduct a supposed ``audit'' already had volunteered his services to the Vice President's National Performance Review in a May 10, 1993, meeting with Jennifer O'Connor. The Peat Marwick work, as explained in its own engagement letter and subsequent draft and formal reports was a review conducted in keeping with and limited by the White House's needs. It was neither ``independent'' nor an audit as represented by the White House. Contrary to representations made by both the White House and Peat Marwick, the Travel Office records were auditable according to Dan Russell, the Peat Marwick auditor who worked on the review.\\39\\ An audit would have taken longer and the White House did not want to take the extra time. The White House dictated how the Peat Marwick review would be conducted and focused its attentions on particular issues including a ``kickbacks.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\39\\ Committee deposition of Daniel Russell, March 27, 1996, p. 59. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Peat Marwick found no basis for the ``kickbacks'' allegations in its review. The findings of the Peat Marwick review have been seriously misrepresented by the White House. On July 8, 1993--6 days after the Management Review was published--Vince Foster has notes indicating that Peat Marwick auditors contacted the White House. His notes state: [auditors] ``strongly disagree[d] with [the] review conclusion'' of the Management Review.\\40\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\40\\ CGE 000967. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FBI ALLOWED THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONTROL ITS INVESTIGATION Once the FBI was brought to the White House on May 13, 1993, despite its desire to be involved in the investigation, it ceded control of the investigation to the White House. The White House told the FBI that Peat Marwick auditors would be brought in first and that the FBI could not observe the audit despite its request to do so. From May 13, 1993, when the FBI first was contacted through May 19, 1993, the FBI exerted no control over the investigation. The White House ignored the FBI's request not to fire the employees on May 19, 1993, and the White House failed to honor its commitment to maintain control over the Travel Office records. THE FBI MISHANDLED THE TRAVEL OFFICE INVESTIGATION FROM THE BEGINNING, ALLOWING THE WHITE HOUSE TO CONTROL THE INVESTIGATION AND DID NOT ADEQUATELY SECURE TRAVEL OFFICE RECORDS IN A TIMELY FASHION There was no integrity in maintaining the Travel Office records in the White House due to a total abdication of responsibility by anyone in the White House Counsel's office, the Office of Administration, and the Staff Secretary's office. The Staff Secretary, John Podesta, was contacted by Records Management officials who were concerned about the loss of Travel Office records on the day after the firings. No one from Mr. Podesta's office responded. Craig Livingstone, the Director of Personnel Security, was the individual put in charge of securing the office and the records and files in the Travel Office on May 19, 1993. In light of what we now know about Craig Livingstone's gathering of hundreds of FBI files on former Republican administration officials, his background as an ex-bouncer and his grand ambitions at the White House, the integrity of the Travel Office records is all the more suspect. Vincent Foster, Bill Kennedy, David Watkins and others were aware that Catherine Cornelius was removing records from the Travel Office and taking them home over a month-long period. No immediate efforts were made to ensure that all records secreted out of the office by Cornelius were returned. The FBI failed to secure any records in the Travel Office until almost a month after the firings. David Bowie, the Washington Metropolitan Field Office supervisor in charge of the investigation, negligently failed to exert control over the records in a timely fashion and generally remained unaware of the ongoing controversy. Whether due to White House withholding of documents or by its own design, the Justice Department cavalierly responded to the potential for missing records. Furthermore, the Department was grossly negligent in failing to gain any control over Travel Office documents or prevent the destruction of documents which could ultimately have determined whether or not allegations made against former Travel Office Director Billy Dale were true. Despite the fact that lead Justice Department prosecutor Stuart Goldberg acknowledged to IRS officials that Travel Office records were missing, Justice Department officials vigorously opposed efforts by Billy Dale to seek White House documents pertaining to this subject. THE WHITE HOUSE ENGAGED IN A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE OF THE TRUE STORY BEHIND THE FIRINGS FROM THE VERY FIRST DAYS. IT DID SO FOR DAMAGE CONTROL PURPOSES President Clinton denied knowing anything about the Travel Office firings even though he had been briefed on the matter 2 days before the firings. This was known to at least Bruce Lindsey and Jeff Eller. Such statements by the President had to have sent a chilling message to all those individuals who were aware of President Clinton's prior knowledge of the firings, in effect creating a conspiracy of silence. The fact that President Clinton was briefed prior to the firings was not disclosed publicly until this investigation. PRESIDENT CLINTON ESTABLISHED A COVER-UP SITUATION WHEN HE INAPPROPRIATELY PLACED THE PERSON WHO HAD APPROVED THE FIRINGS--MACK McLARTY--IN CHARGE OF THE MANAGEMENT REVIEW AND McLARTY WITHHELD INFORMATION IN THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION. IT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE TO INVESTIGATE ITSELF IN MATTERS OF CONFLICTS It was inappropriate for Mack McLarty, the individual who both pushed Watkins to fire the Travel Office employees and approved the firings pursuant to ``pressure'' from Mrs. Clinton, to oversee the subsequent White House Management Review announced on May 25, 1993, in the wake of a firestorm of media criticism and the embarrassing upbraiding of the White House by Attorney General Reno about the misuse of the FBI. McLarty represented that Podesta and Stern were chosen to conduct the review because neither had been involved in any of the relevant events. But Staff Secretary Podesta was aware of the efforts by Thomason to obtain Government business through his contacts with the President and also had been informed that the records in the Travel Office were not being appropriately secured. Further, two McLarty aides were provided to assist Podesta. The White House set up a sham investigation in which a key person involved in the firings was to be briefed on, oversee and steer the investigation of alleged wrongdoing for which he was in large part responsible. In the initial meetings with Podesta and Stern, McLarty did not disclose his full role in the firings, and he withheld the fact that the May 17 memo was cc'd to Mrs. Clinton and that he had a May 16 meeting with Mrs. Clinton. While Podesta and Stern learned of the May 17 memo in the course of their review, they never were informed by McLarty of the May 16 meeting in which McLarty was pressured by Mrs. Clinton to take action in the Travel Office matter. It should come as no surprise that Podesta and Stern were ineffective in investigating their own bosses. THE INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE MANAGEMENT REVIEW WAS A CATALOG OF ``MISTAKES AND DECEPTION'' \\41\\ WHICH OMITTED INCRIMINATING INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, MRS. CLINTON AND HARRY THOMASON. THE WHITE HOUSE CHOSE TO COVER-UP INCRIMINATING INFORMATION FOR POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\41\\ ``A Stealthy, Evasive Confession,'' the New York Times, July 11, 1993. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- When the White House conducted the Management Review, the President was at an abysmally low 36 percent approval rating, his budget and health plans were on the ropes, and numerous debacles in the first 6 months had the White House reeling. The White House Management Review covered up President Clinton's prior knowledge of the Travel Office firings beginning at least 2 days before they occurred. The White House Management Review covered up the fact that it was President Clinton who approved of Harry Thomason's working at the White House. Thomason was designated on his pass as a ``White House staffer,'' not as a volunteer. And Thomason was to report to President Clinton. The White House Management Review covered up President Clinton's efforts to assist Harry Thomason in obtaining Government contracts for TRM. Even though a specific section in the report discussed ``appearances of impropriety'' by Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens, it ignored this most blatant abuse of White House access which directly involved President Clinton. The White House Management Review minimized Mrs. Clinton's role in the Travel Office firings and omitted the testimony of witnesses indicating a larger role by Mrs. Clinton. It also failed to note that senior White House aides initially had withheld information about Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the firings. The White House Management Review omitted conversations Harry Thomason had with Mrs. Clinton about the Travel Office and failed to note that Thomason refused to cooperate with the review after an initial interview. The White House Management Review concealed the fact that the alleged source of Harry Thomason's rumor--the President of Miami Air--denied that Billy Dale or anyone in the Travel Office ever solicited kickbacks.\\42\\ As a result, the IRS continued a 2\\1/2\\ year fruitless investigation in which UltrAir prevailed with a $5,000 refund from the agency. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\42\\ WHMR interview of Ross Fischer of Miami Air, June 17, 1993. CGEPR 237-239. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The White House Management Review largely ignored the fact that Peat Marwick, World Wide Travel and Penny Sample of Air Advantage were brought into the White House with no competitive bidding. White House ethics officials had reviewed these matters and expressed such concerns. The concerns were not contained in the final report. The White House Management Review, contrary to representations made to the press on July 2, 1993, by McLarty, Gearan and Podesta, attempted to conduct its own investigation of the seven employees. However, when they came up empty-handed, they abandoned these efforts and failed to disclose the exculpatory information they had discovered which would have been of benefit to the reputations of the Travel Office employees. In the aftermath of the Travel Office firings and in the course of the White House Management Review, Patsy Thomasson sought to intimidate and coerce false representations from Catherine Cornelius and Clarissa Cerda regarding whether or not David Watkins had read their February 15, 1993, memo on the takeover of the Travel Office. Chief of Staff McLarty inappropriately ignored this gross violation of standards of conduct by Ms. Thomasson when he was informed of it. Further, Thomasson even resorted to pulling Cornelius' and Cerda's mess privileges when they did not comply with her request that they misrepresent Watkins' knowledge. THE WHITE HOUSE MANAGEMENT REVIEW REPRIMANDED PEOPLE WHO WERE ONLY FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF THE REAL INSTIGATORS Despite Mr. Nussbaum's request to McLarty that both he and Foster be reprimanded if Kennedy were reprimanded, McLarty refused to issue those reprimands because they would have been too close to the ``highest levels.'' It was apparently politically unthinkable for President Clinton to hold those actually responsible for the firings publicly accountable. This set in motion a cover-up that grew more convoluted with each subsequent investigation. With the intersection of the investigations into the death of Vincent Foster, the tangled Travelgate web became harder to re-weave to accommodate subsequent revelations. Rather than reprimanding the lower-level players (Bill Kennedy, David Watkins, Jeff Eller and Catherine Cornelius), the appropriate action would have been for the President to acknowledge his role in bringing Harry Thomason to the White House and providing him the opportunity to inappropriately seek Government business. The White House Management Review, the possibility of congressional hearings and the pending criminal investigation by Public Integrity were of great concern to Vincent Foster. But a concerted effort was launched by McLarty to downplay his concerns in investigations with GAO, OPR and the FBI. THE WHITE HOUSE'S OBSTRUCTION OF THE REVIEW OF VINCE FOSTER'S DOCUMENTS WAS DUE IN PART TO CONCERNS ABOUT TRAVELGATE DOCUMENTS IN FOSTER'S CUSTODY Independent Counsel Fiske properly concluded that the Travel Office firings were a significant factor in Mr. Foster's depression in the weeks preceding his death. His colleagues, most notably Bernard Nussbaum, ignored the potential ramifications of the problems faced by Harry Thomason's actions and President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton's involvement in the Travel Office matter and dismissed Foster's attempts to have these matters handled by outside counsel as would have been appropriate. White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum conducted a sham review of the documents in Foster's office following Foster's death. Mr. Nussbaum did not adequately or accurately describe to law enforcement officials relevant documents in Foster's office, including the Vince Foster Travel Office file. Despite Nussbaum's claims to the contrary, no one present in Foster's office during the July 22, 1993, search recalls seeing the Vince Foster Travel Office file or hearing of any document described as such by Nussbaum. Mr. Nussbaum withheld information concerning the existence of, and concealed the critical Vince Foster Travel Office notebook from GAO, Public Integrity and FBI investigators for almost a year following Foster's death and only informed the White House of its existence after he disclosed it to a Grand Jury in May 1994. Following Vincent Foster's death, high-ranking White House officials quietly killed efforts by TRM to obtain the GSA contract, concealed all documents pertaining to these efforts from the ongoing General Accounting Office investigation, and long-delayed their production of documents to the Justice Department's Public Integrity unit investigating possible criminal conflicts of interest by Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens while they were at the White House. MRS. CLINTON INSTRUCTED WHITE HOUSE STAFF ON THE HANDLING OF FOSTER DOCUMENTS AND THE FOSTER NOTE FOUND ON JULY 26, 1993, AND SENIOR WHITE HOUSE STAFF COVERED UP THIS INFORMATION AND KEPT IT FROM INVESTIGATORS Mrs. Clinton personally was involved in the discussions regarding the White House's handling of documents in Vince Foster's office following his death. Mrs. Clinton made known her views that investigators should be denied ``unfettered access'' to Foster's office prior to the search of the office on July 22, 1993. The White House withheld evidence subsequently discovered among the 2,000 pages over which President Clinton invoked executive privilege, that senior White House aide Bill Burton spoke with Mrs. Clinton on the evening of Foster's death (July 20, 1993). Mrs. Clinton directed that Mack McLarty and others not inform the President about the discovery of the Foster ``suicide'' note on July 26, 1993. This note essentially defended Foster's and the White House's actions in the Travel Office firings and Mrs. Clinton suggested that executive privilege research be done regarding the note. The White House's delay in turning over the Foster note was due to senior staffers' deference to Mrs. Clinton's wishes. Statements by Mack McLarty and David Gergen that the note was not immediately turned over because of the need to notify Mrs. Foster and the President are not consistent with the evidence. No one called Mrs. Foster the evening the note was discovered and President Clinton was not told about the note's existence until after Mrs. Clinton met with Bernard Nussbaum and Steve Neuwirth. Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Neuwirth had been tasked with studying the executive privilege issue at 2:30 p.m. Susan Thomases and Bob Barnett also were in the residence that afternoon at approximately 3 p.m. The Foster note most likely was not a ``suicide'' note but rather a note in preparation for resigning or in the event that Foster was asked to resign or take the fall for the problems generated by the firings and related matters.\\43\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\43\\ Foster's sister, Sheila Anthony told OPR investigators that in July 1993, Foster had told her he was considering resigning. Mrs. Foster told the Independent Counsel that the note was probably written on or about July 11, 1993: ``On that day, she had encouraged him to write down everything that was disturbing him. . . . Later that day, Foster told his wife that he had written the opening argument for his defense.'' Report of the Independent Counsel, June 30, 1994, p. 14. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DEFERRED TO THE WHITE HOUSE DURING ITS INVESTIGATIONS OF THE WHITE HOUSE TRAVEL OFFICE AND HARRY THOMASON AND IGNORED THE OBSTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY THE COUNSEL'S OFFICE The Justice Department vigorously pursued criminal allegations from the White House about Billy Dale while minimally investigating allegations of conflicts by Presidential friend Harry Thomason. Prosecutor Stuart Goldberg told an FBI agent that DOJ intended to indict Dale before the 1994 elections. Prosecutor Goldberg also told an IRS agent that there were missing documents in this case and that Public Integrity believed they might be in Catherine Cornelius' possession. Yet when Dale raised the issue of missing documents as a defense at his own trial, the Justice Department opposed this request and the Judge ruled in the Government's favor. Even after the White House stonewalled the Justice Department on its requests for Harry Thomason documents and engaged in obstructive behavior that necessitated the issuance of a September 13, 1994, subpoena to the White House, the Justice Department showed little interest in further investigating. In fact the Department failed to obtain critical documents from Thomason himself until this committee threatened a subpoena to obtain them and did in fact obtain documents particularly relevant to a conflicts investigation.\\44\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\44\\ In particular, the January 29, 1993 (EZ 037684), and March 12, 1993 (CGE 00224), memos demonstrated a clear interest in obtaining the Travel Office business as well as numerous other ``Washington opportunities.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In stark contrast to the stated intent of indicting Billy Dale before the 1994 elections,\\45\\ the Justice Department declined prosecution of Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens citing, in part, concerns that it might be viewed as a ``political prosecution.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\45\\ FBI e-mail from Gregory D. Meacham, to Tom Kubic, dated September 26, 1994, ``Regarding your inquiry . . . I . . . was advised by SA Pam Bombardi, that DOJ Trial Attorney Stuart Goldberg had stated that he wanted to do the indictment before the elections, probably on October 4, 1994.'' Bates Stamp No. FBI-00000242. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In startling contrast to its chronic stonewalling on all matters related to Harry Thomason or Vincent Foster, the White House not only cooperated fully with the investigation of Billy Dale but conducted its own investigation into wrongdoing and provided any incriminating information it could find to both the Public Integrity Section and the GAO. The FBI ignored the fact that the White House interviewed many witnesses (in the course of the White House Management Review) before the FBI interviewed them in the weeks following the Travel Office firings. In direct contrast to the Justice Department's strong opposition to this committee interviewing witnesses involved with the Travel Office matter, the Justice Department registered no protests against this and took no action to ensure that the FBI was allowed to interview witnesses before the White House did. David Bowie once again was woefully negligent and entirely unaware of the fact that the White House was conducting a Management Review.\\46\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\46\\ Committee interview of David Bowie. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Justice Department deferred to the White House by allowing the White House: to initially control the investigation of the Travel Office and call all the shots; to maintain custody and control over the Travel Office documents for almost a month after the firings; and to delay for almost a year the production of documents relevant to the DOJ investigation of Harry Thomason. At every turn, the Justice Department was overly accommodating of a controlling White House. In the course of the committee's investigation, the Justice Department put a former Clinton campaign staffer in charge of handling documents produced to the committee. Following Billy Dale's November 1995 acquittal, his 1994 plea negotiations were leaked to the press. This information inappropriately was used by the White House and President Clinton to malign Billy Dale long after President Clinton publicly wished Dale well and hoped Dale could put the matter behind him. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF DELAY, DECEIT AND OBSTRUCTION OVER THE COURSE OF 3 YEARS OF INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE TRAVEL OFFICE AND MATTERS RELATED TO VINCENT FOSTER'S DEATH The GAO's investigation was delayed for months by document production delays. Ultimately GAO did not receive all documents relevant to its inquiry including: the Vince Foster Travel Office file, the White House Management Review interview notes, documents related to the TRM efforts to obtain GSA contracts and the Watkins ``soul cleansing'' memo. A GAO representative noted that the level of cooperation that it received from the White House was not conducive to properly conducting GAO's work.\\47\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\47\\ Testimony of Nancy Kingsbury before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, October 24, 1995. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The ``Watkins memo'' was responsive to numerous document requests and was inappropriately withheld by David Watkins, Matthew Moore and Patsy Thomasson. All three had hard copies and/or computer copies of the memo and were made aware of the various document requests and subpoenas to which it would have been responsive. In responding to a Public Integrity request for documents regarding Harry Thomason, Matthew Moore wrote an April 4, 1994 memo to Neil Eggleston stating: ``I know of no documents in my possession, or ever in my possession, responsive to the request.'' This was false. The Watkins memo clearly was responsive to this request. At or around this time, Moore removed the Watkins memo from his computer and provided a disk copy to Watkins as he left the White House. However, Moore maintained his own copy of the disk which included several previous drafts of the memo. The White House withheld documents from the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility including the Vince Foster Travel Office file, the White House Management Review interview notes and the Watkins ``soul cleansing memo.'' OPR Counsel Michael Shaheen found the White House's lack of cooperation ``unprecedented'' in his 20 year Government career. White House stonewalling forced the Public Integrity Section at the Justice Department to acknowledge it had no confidence that the White House had faithfully produced all documents ``relating to the Thomason allegations.'' While Section Chief Lee Radek noted that the ``integrity of our review is entirely dependent upon securing all relevant documents,'' he did not obtain all relevant documents: notably the complete Vince Foster Travel Office notebook and the Watkins ``soul cleansing'' memo, as well as more than 120 items over which the White House claimed executive privilege. The Justice Department quietly acceded to this inappropriate invocation of privilege. One of the key items that it did not receive was a White House Counsel's Office memo demonstrating that the Counsel's office did believe there was a case to be made that Harry Thomason was a special Government employee.\\48\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\48\\ Memo by Beth Nolan, Associate White House Counsel handling ethics issues, CGE 43349. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bernard Nussbaum obstructed the FBI investigation into the discovery of the Foster note as well as numerous other investigations, including congressional investigations, by failing to timely inform anyone in law enforcement, the White House, or Congress about the Vince Foster Travel Office notebook that he had secreted in Nussbaum's office by July 22, 1993. An FBI investigation was ordered on July 28, 1993 by Philip Heymann, the day after the note was turned over to the Park Police after the 30-hour delay in informing law enforcement authorities. Heymann instructed David Margolis to be ``very aggressive'' in the investigation. Nussbaum failed to inform those tasked with overseeing document production to both the Justice Department and the GAO that he was secreting a relevant document in his office. Nevertheless, once he informed Neil Eggleston in May 1994, Eggleston also failed to turn over the documents to the Public Integrity Section in a timely and responsive manner. Neil Eggleston and Cliff Sloan, at Nussbaum's direction, delayed the production of documents relating to the criminal investigation of Harry Thomason and Darnell Martens to the Public Integrity section and ultimately denied all such documents to GAO. DAVID WATKINS' ``SOUL CLEANSING'' MEMO ACCOUNT OF THE TRAVEL OFFICE IS SUBSTANTIALLY CORROBORATED BY NUMEROUS RECORDS AND WITNESS TESTIMONY Watkins' contemporaneous account of Travel Office events told by Watkins in his ``soul cleansing'' memo is corroborated by the records of meetings, phone calls, contacts and documents that demonstrate the involvement and pressures to act from Mrs. Clinton, Mack McLarty and Harry Thomason.
