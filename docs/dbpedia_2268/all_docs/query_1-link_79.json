        "text": "CHAPTER SEVEN\n\nThomas and Susannah Anderson Williams\n\nThomas1 left only slightly more in the way of written records than Roger Williams. He was born 26 Sept 1712 in Wales, according to a family Bible in the possession of his great great grandson, Roe Williams, in Tennessee1; died after July 1794.2 Thomas apparently married Susannah Anderson, daughter of Thomas Anderson of Albemarle, based on Andersons will3 naming Susannah Williams as his daughter and supported by Thomas and Susannahs son, Samuel, naming his first son Anderson. Susannah appears to have predeceased her husband. Thomas had financial problems and made many appearances in the Cumberland County Court in the 1760s, being repeatedly hauled in for debt.4 A Charles Williams and John Gannaway gave bond for Thomas when he lost one of the lawsuits. Evidence points to Charles possibly being a son of Thomas and likely is the same Charles who resided in Pittsylvania County from the 1770s onward. Samuel paid tax for his father in 1786 in Cumberland County.5 There is a Thomas Williams who married Mary Crantz, dau of Michael Crantz, in Campbell Co. on 2 Jan 1790. In 1796, Michael Crantz mentioned his \"disobedient daughter Mary\" in his will.6 This Thomas is not Roger's son, nor the son of either Matthias Williams. Perhaps Thomas married again in his old age to a young woman against her father's wishes? Thomas died sometime after July 1794, when he again appeared in Cumberland County court orders, being sued by Daniel Culp and another man whose name is illegible in the court orders. The suit was continued from 24 June 1790. Thomas was a brother of Matthias1 Williams, per a Cumberland County, Virginia land deed dated 28 Feb 1757.7\n\nChildren:\n\ni. ?Charles, born c1740s; died before Oct 1805, when his will was probated in Pittsylvania Co., VA; married (1) Ann Wilson, 3 Mar. 1770 (2) Sarah Dix, 21 Apr. 1783, both in Pittsylvania Co., VA with Peter Wilson as surety for both marriages.\n\nii. Samuel, born 18 Sept 1744, probably in VA; died by Oct 1823, when his will was probated in Cumberland Co., VA; married (1) Susannah Ligon, dau of William Ligon, 22 Dec. 1766, Amelia Co., VA (2) Mary Wright, dau of John Wright and widow of George Wright, between 1790, when George Wrights will was probated and 1794, when Samuel and Mary sold land. Her birth and death years are not known.\n\nNotes\n\n1Family Bible in possession of Roe Williams of Tennessee, 1999; copy in possession of Linda Stufflebean.\n\n2Cumberland County, Virginia Court Orders 1794-1801 (July 1794), p. 222, FHL Film #30,764.\n\n3Will of Thomas Anderson, Albemarle County, Virginia, Will Book 2:38.\n\n4Cumberland County, Virginia Court Orders 1762-1767 (July Term 1763), p. 243, FHL Film #30,760.\n\n51787 Census of Virginia, v. 1, p. 334, N.

There is no definitive proof that he was a child of Thomas Williams. However, there is also no evidence refuting this supposition. One Charles Williams and John Gannaway Jr. posted bond for Thomas Williams in a lawsuit brought against him in Cumberland County Court in 1763.2 Another Charles Williams in the area has been eliminated as the possible bondsman, leaving this Charles. Because Charless own son, Charles Jr., married Susannah Williams, daughter of Roger of Bedford Co., it is certain that these families knew each other. Charles married (1) Ann Wilson, 3 Mar 1770 (2) Sarah Dix, 21 Apr 1783, both in Pittsylvania Co., VA and with Peter Wilson as surety for both marriages. According to the History of Pittsylvania Co.3, Charles served in the military as a captain during the Revolution There is a Salley Williams in Pittsylvania, 18204, and gone by 1830. The household appeared as 10000-00111. She lived on or near the Dan River, which is where Charles Jr. lived in the 1820s. On 15 Nov 1827, Charles and Susannah Williams and Sally Williams, with Charles and Sally identified as son and widow of Capt. Charles, sold his land.5 Charles and Susannah migrated to Maury Co., TN. Sally apparently died between 1827 and 30 October 1830, when Charles Williams of Maury Co. sued Thomas B. Fontaine, administrator of her estate, for distribution of the proceeds from Sallys estate sale.6\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Nancy, probably born c1773; died after Oct 1805 and before 17 Nov 1823; married Thomas Ballard Fontaine, 17 Dec 1809, Pittsylvania Co., VA. She is identified on the bond as the daughter of Sally Williams. Thomas married (2) Anna Watkins, 17 Nov 1823, Pittsylvania Co., VA. Thomas may have married someone before Nancy, as there is a child in the census shown as born before the 1809 marriage date.\n\nii. Peter, born c1774; died after 1840 census, possibly in Marshall or Maury Co., TN. He may be the Peter who married Sally Hill, daughter of Isaac Hill, 21 Nov 1792, Pittsylvania Co., VA. Surety was Edwin Hammonds. The Hill family migrated to Maury Co., TN, where Peter also lived, by 1830. He may be the Peter Williams who married Mary B. Beasley, c1826-27, Maury Co., TN with John H. Hill as bondsman. Marriage return was undated, but in the box with 1826-27 papers.\n\niii. Charles, born c1776, died by May 1844, Marshall Co., TN; married Susannah Williams, daughter of Roger and Cassie Ann Blair Williams, 11 Apr 1797, Bedford Co., VA, who survived him.\n\niv. Susannah, born c1778, probably Pittsylvania Co., VA; died 23 Feb 1845, Williamson Co., TN; married (1) John Crouch, 20 Oct 1794, Bedford Co., VA; consent of her father, Charles, given. They were married by Rev. Thomas Sparks, with William Astin as surety. John was born c1767, probably in Goochland Co., ,VA, and possibly the son of John and Susannah Ellis Crouch of Goochland Co; died 14 Dec 1813, Franklin, Williamson, TN. Susannah married (2) Ephraim Brown, 6 May 1823, Williamson Co., TN.\n\nSamuel2 (Thomas1) was born 18 Sept 1744; died before Oct 1823, Cumberland Co., VA; married (1) Susannah Ligon, daughter of William Ligon, 22 Dec. 1766, Amelia Co., VA (2) Mary Wright, daughter of John Wright and widow of George Wright, before 13 Sept 1794 when Samuel, Mary and other legatees of George sold part of the land which he owned before death.7 In 1820, Cumberland Co., Samuel's household consisted of 000001-00011.8 Mary may be the Mary Williams whose estate was probated in Jan 1823,9 as she is not mentioned in Samuels will.10\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Anderson, born c1767; died after 1860, possibly in Campbell Co., VA; married Mildred Shepard, daughter of Samuel and Anne Burwell Shepard, 18 Dec 1786, Cumberland Co. She died before 1850, but Anderson was living with his daughter, Susannah Taylor at that time. In 1860, Anderson was living with daughter Elizabeth Garrett, aged 91 years old.\n\nii. William Ligon, born 6 June 1771; died 13 Oct 1848, Coles Co., IL, when his will was probated; married (1) Mary Gannaway, daughter of William and Elizabeth Wright Gannaway, before1Dec1794, Cumberland Co. Mary died c1815, probably Grayson Co., KY (2) Katherine Keller, 4 Oct 1830, Coles Co., IL; died after 1850, probably Coles Co., IL.\n\niii. John, born c1773, VA; died by Oct 1853, when his will was probated in Roane Co., TN; married Mary Lee, daughter of Joseph Lee, before 1 Dec 1794, Cumberland Co. Mary was born c1780, VA; died after 1860, probably Roane, TN.\n\niv. Charles, born c1775, VA; died between Aug 1825 and Jan 1826, Morgan Co., TN; married (1) Unknown (2) Elizabeth Cobb. She was possibly a Goddard by birth. Although Charles died in Morgan Co., apparently his heirs left an unrecorded copy of his will in Roane Co. found in the loose papers in the courthouse.\n\nv. Reuben, born c1777, VA; died after July 1828, probably Roane Co., TN; married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler, 25 June 1801, Campbell Co., VA; Thomas Butler died in Anderson Co., TN in 1814.\n\nvi. Polly, born c1779, VA; married Mr. Love11; nothing further is known of this couple. If Polly is the younger female in Samuel's household in 1820, then she apparently married Mr. Love after 1820, but before her father wrote his will on 2 July 1821.\n\nvii. Samuel, born 19 Mar 1781, VA; died 29 Nov 1849, VA; married Betsey Wingo, Dec 1803, Amelia Co., VA.\n\nviii. Benjamin, born c1785, died before 22 Mar 1855, Anderson Co., TN; married (1) Cizire Williams, 4 June 1815, Roane Co., TN (2) Nancy McCormack, 23 June 1851, Roane Co., TN.\n\nix. Robert, born 15 Aug 1786, VA; died 18 July 1865, Roane Co., TN; married Sarah A. Manley, born 9 July 1787, VA; died 23 Mar 1875, Roane Co. Sarah was the daughter of Revolutionary War pensioner Ancel and Sarah Butler Manley.\n\nx. Joseph, born 14 May 1789; died 29 May 1862, probably Howard Co., MO; married (1) Susan Woodson, 10 June 1815, Cumberland Co. Susan was born 10 May 1799; died 6 May 1863, probably Howard Co., MO. There is a Joseph Williams in Cumberland Co., who married Elizabeth Harrison, 11 Sept 1805. It is not known if this is the same man who married Susan Woodson. The Ligon Family and Connections11 also states he married Elizabeth Raine, no date or place given. Since Susan appears to be 10 years younger than Joseph, it is reasonable to conclude he may have had a prior marriage. Additionally, one Hugh Raine was one of four witnesses to his fathers will. If Joseph did marry Elizabeth Raine, she was likely a first wife who died young.\n\nNotes\n\n1Will of Charles Williams, Pittsylvania County, Virginia Will Book 11:283-284.\n\n2Cumberland County, Virginia Court Orders 1762-1767 (July Term 1763), p. 243, FHL Film #30,760.\n\n3The History of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, Maude Carter Clement, J.P.

She is identified on the bond as daughter of Sally Williams. Thomas was born 12 Mar 1777, Halifax Co., VA; died 8 Apr 1850, Robertson Co., TN. Thomas married (2) Anna Watkins, 17 Nov 1823, Pittsylvania Co., VA. Thomas may have married before Nancy, as three females, born c1804, 1806 and 1808 are in the 1820 household along with children born after the 1809 marriage date.1 In 1830, the household is listed as 00100001-2013001.2 Thomas's son, born c1814, may have died young or he may have already married, since the date of birth is an estimate and he may have been several years older. The two girls born c1810 and 1812 appear to still be in the 1830 household. The mother of the other children is uncertain, since the 1820 census did not show any children born after 1815. However, a Fontaine family Bible3 shows Nancy to be the mother of Sarah, Elizabeth, Mary Ann, Moses and Nancy. Anna, born c1784, VA; died after 1850,4 was the mother of Martha Elizabeth W., born Dec 1826; married Dr. R. G. Glover, 10 Feb 1853, Robertson Co., TN and Lucy J., who was born 20 June 1829; died 4 Sept 1855; married Wiley L. Frey, 9 Jan 1851, also in Robertson Co., TN.\n\nChildren: (Fontaine)\n\ni. Sarah Williams, born 26 Nov 1810, VA; died 31 Dec 862, Robertson Co., TN; married Alexander B. Soyars, 29 Sept 1830, Pittsylvania Co., VA. He was born c1807, VA; died after 1870, probably Robertson Co., TN.\n\nii. Elizabeth Ballard, born 1 Sept 1812, VA; died 1888, probably Pittsylvania Co., VA; married William Witcher Keen, 15 May 1837, Pittsylvania Co., VA. He was born 1811, VA; died 1880, probably Pittsylvania Co., VA.\n\niii. Son, born c1814, VA; possibly died young.\n\niv. Mary Anne, born 16 May 1815,VA; married Mr. Williams. She reportedly stayed in VA, died by 1848, but had at least one son, George T. Williams.\n\nv. Moses Alexander, born 21 Aug 1816, VA; died 22 May 1866, Robertson Co., TN; married Martha Courtenay Freeman, 16 May 1839, Robertson Co., TN.\n\nvi. Charles, born 1818; died 1818, Pittsylvania Co., VA.\n\nvii. Nancy Dixie, born 23 June 1819, VA; died 17 Feb 1895, probably Robertson Co., TN; married Henry S. Frey, c1839. He was born c1812, TN; died 30 Dec 1852, probably Robertson Co., TN.\n\nPeter3 (Charles2, ?Thomas1) was b. c1774; died after the 1840 census, possibly in Maury or Marshall Counties, TN. He may have married Sally Hill, daughter of Isaac Hill, whose marriage is found in Pittsylvania Co. on 21 Nov 1792 with surety Edwin Hammonds. Peter appears in the 1800 Rockingham Co., NC census with his brother, Charles, and brother-in-law, John Crouch.5 He was apparently married and had a family. Peter was in the 26-45 year old range, with the oldest female 16-26. He also owned 16 slaves. Three boys under 10 were also in the household. Peter disappeared after the 1800 census at least until 1820 and perhaps until the 1830 census of Maury Co., TN. One Peter Williams appears in Williamson Co., TN in 1820, which is where his sister, Susannah Crouch, was living. That Peters household was 100240-00100.6 There is no Peter Williams in Williamson Co. in 1830, but this Peter appears in Maury Co. in that year.7 There is also one court reference to a Peter Williams in Williamson Co. in the 1820s. In an 1821 court record there, a Peter Williams declared he was insolvent.8 After the 1830 census, Peter appears in several more land records. He witnessed a land sale between James Dearen and John Dearen on 1 Apr 1837.9 Susanna and Peter Williams sold 60 acres of land on Globe Creek on 22 Dec 1836.10 Peter witnessed another land transaction on 17 Feb 184011 and finally, in May 1840, he sold a 69 year old female slave and other property for five dollars to John Vincent.12 Peter undoubtedly had children born between 1798 and 1811, based on the information on the 1830 census. However, any children born during that time frame were out of the house before 1830. By 1840, Marshall Co., TN, the family configuration was 0010000001-001000001.13 It is possible that this family removed from TN. Although Peter was quite elderly and may well have died, there is no evidence yet found for any of his children there. While Charles left a will, there is no such document or even an estate administration for Peter.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. ?Isaac H., born c1794, VA; died after 1860, possibly Marshall Co., TN; married Mary, bef 1827. Isaac H. Williams witnessed the will of Charles Williams who died in 1844. Isaac was not named as an heir of Charles. Additionally, Peter Williams witnessed a land transaction involving Isaac in 1831 in Maury Co., leading to the suspicion that Isaac was a son of Peter.\n\nii. Son, born c1796.\n\niii. Son, born c1798; possibly the Charles Williams in Marshall Co., TN 1840, shown as 2110001-001101 (p. 203). This family does not fit the configuration of Charles' son, Charles, in 1850.\n\niv. Son, born c1811.\n\nv. Son, born c1813.\n\nvi. Son, born c1815.\n\nCharles3 (Charles2, ?Thomas1) was born c1776; died by May 1844, Marshall Co., TN, when his will was probated; inventory was 8 Apr 184514; married Susannah Williams, 11 Apr 1797, Bedford Co., VA. Susannah was the daughter of Roger and Cassie Ann Blair Williams, born 26 Sept 1779, VA; died after 1860 census, probably Maury Co., TN. She was living with her son, Peter, and his family at that time.15 Charles had removed to Rockingham Co., NC by 1800, when his household appears as 00100-10100-02.16 In 1820, there is a Charles Williams in Pittsylvania who appears to be this man. There is a female b. 1775-1794. The household appears as 120101-2001.17 This family is gone from VA in 1830, but appears in TN.18 They may have left VA c1828, as Charles and Susannah sold land to Henry Sergeant at that time and don't appear in Pittsylvania Co. records after that date. However, there is a Charles Williams who married Ann Eliza Hodnett, 3 Dec 1838, Pittsylvania Co. She was the daughter of John Hodnett. Bondsman was John D. Burton. This Charles has not been identified. Charles' family in 1840 Marshall Co., TN was 000010001-001100001.20\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Nancy W., born c1799; died after 1860, possibly Giles Co., TN; married Isaac Gardner, 29 May 1820, Pittsylvania Co., VA. Surety was Joel Harville. The Gardners lived in between Peter and Charles Williams in 1830 in Maury Co. By 1840, it appears that the Gardners moved on to Giles Co., TN.\n\nii. Charles A., born c1803; died after 1850, possibly Maury or Marshall Co., TN; married Louisa H. Cunningham, 27 Sept 1831, Maury Co., TN. Charles was bondsman for Cassie Ann's marriage to John Ritchie.\n\ni. Son, born c1805; died young.\n\nii. Son, born c1807; died young.\n\niii. Cassie Ann, born c1810; died before Nov 1835; married John Ritchie, 1 Nov 1825, Pittsylvania Co., VA; bondsman was her brother, but he was listed as Charles D. Williams. John Ritchie married (2) Elizabeth Lipcomb, 18 Nov 1835, Maury Co., TN. Cassie Ann was not named in her father's will, but his grandchild, Mary Richey, was. John Ritchie also died young, by Mar 1840, leaving Polly an orphan.\n\niv. Daughter, born c1812; died by May 1844; apparently married Mr. Stephens, as her father named grandchildren Charles A., Mary Ann, and Thomas A. Stephens in his will.\n\nv. Roger Samuel, born c1813; died c1845, when administration of estate was granted; married Dilla Ann Fausett, 2 July 1834, Maury Co., TN.\n\nvi. Peter, born c1815; died after 1860, probably Maury Co., TN.; married Nancy P. Boaz, 26 Dec 1853, Maury Co., TN. She was born c1828; died after 1860.\n\nvii. Son, born c1818; died young.\n\nviii. Elizabeth, born c1819; died after May 1844; married Mr. Hendrick, probably c1840-44. He is likely one of the Hendricks involved in Maury and Marshall Cos. land deed transactions in the 1830s  John, Jerry, Isaac Jr., Isaac Sr., Jeremiah, and Andrew.\n\nix. Mary A. M., born c1820; died after May 1844, when she was named in her father's will. There are two Marshall Co. marriages that might pertain to her. Mary Williams married David A. Hill on 1 Dec 1850. Mary A. Williams married William B. Hopper on 3 Aug 1848.\n\nSusannah3 (Charles2, ?Thomas1) was born c1778; died 23 Feb 1843, Williamson Co., TN21; married (1) John Crouch 20 Oct 1794, Pittsylvania Co., VA, with consent of her father, Charles; married by Rev. William Sparks; William Astin, surety. 22 John Crouch was born c1767, probably in Goochland Co., VA, the son of John and Susannah Ellis Crouch; d. 14 Dec 1813, Franklin, Williamson, TN. (2) Ephraim Brown, 6 May 1823, Williamson Co., TN. Ephraim was born 1775-1794; died 1841, Williamson Co., TN, where he left a will. John Crouch appeared on the 1800 Rockingham Co., NC census list.23 He sold land in Caswell Co., NC on 23 April 1801, with wife Susannah relinquishing her dower rights.24 The land was sold to Major Brockman on Wolf Island Creek. One of the witnesses was Peter Williams. John Crouch is then found on the Pittsylvania Co. tax lists for 1802, 1803, 1804, 1805 and 1811.25 Since he was taxed for himself, slaves and horses, it appears that he moved often and finally left the area around 1812. In 1802, 1803, and 1804, there is a Hardin Crouch listed next to him, taxed only for himself and a horse. One Hardin Crouch died in 1845 in Montgomery Co., TN. John may have been married before or else took in siblings who may have been orphaned because Susannah was too young to have been the mother of the male and female in the household, b. 1774-1784, and the male and female b. 1784-90. She is likely the mother of the one female b. 1790-1800. The Crouches apparently left VA between 25 May 1811, when John gave bond to William Ware in Pittsylvania Co.26 and Dec 1813, when he died in Williamson Co., TN.27 William Ware sued Susannah in 1817 in Williamson Co. over the matter of the bond.28\n\nChild: (Crouch)\n\ni. Polly W., born c1800 (range of 1790-1800); named in her grandfather's will written in 1801; died 1850-1860, probably Maury Co., TN; married John D. Warren, 28 Nov 1817, Williamson Co., TN.\n\nii. John E., born c1803, VA; died by 1 Sept 1852, San Augustine Co., TX; married Elizabeth D. Midgett, 1 Nov 1842, Williamson Co., TN. Charles W. Crouch was his estate administrator. Susannah Brown's noncupative will was ordered filed, with the statement that she called her son John, named in parentheses as John E. Crouch, into the room when she was dying and, in front of witnesses, stated that she wanted John to inherit her estate because he had always been a dutiful son.\n\niii. William H., born 28 Oct 1804, VA; married (1) Eliza H. Stone, 5 Dec 1832, Williamson Co., TN; she was born 11 Nov 1811; died 31 Mar 1849 (2) Lucy W. Carter, 9 May 1852, Williamson Co., TN.\n\niv. Charles W., born 12 Sept 1806, Pittsylvania Co., VA; died between 1870-1880; married (1) Lucretia Nash, 6 June 1827, Williamson Co., TN. Lucretia was born 1810-15; died before Nov 1844 (2) Martha A. Smith, 28 Nov 1844, San Augustine Co., TX (3) Amanda Norwood, 28 Jan 1849, San Augustine Co. Amanda was b. c1830, NC. (4) Jane Storke/Stark born c1831, England, 29 Aug 1861, Dallas Co., TX; died after 1880.\n\nv. Daughter, born c1811, per 1820 census; may have died young, as no further record has been found for a female Crouch in this age range.\n\nvi. ?James, born c1813; married Louisa Garrett, 3 Feb 1835, Williamson Co., TN. James is probably the youngest son in Susan Crouch's 1820 household, as this was about the only Crouch family in the area at the time.\n\nAnderson3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c1767, probably in Cumberland Co., VA; died after 1860, probably Botetourt Co., VA. He married Mildred Shepard, daughter of Samuel and Anne (Burwell or Holman) Shepard, 18 Dec 1786, Cumberland Co., VA. Mildred was born c1760-1770. In 1810, Anderson is found in Caswell Co., NC with household 00010-41010.29 He appears in a couple of Caswell Co. land deeds. First, he sold some land to James Webb.30 Later, Anderson Williams sold some slaves to Lewis Shepard in NC.31 Reference is made to his father, Samuel, back in Cumberland Co., VA. In Campbell Co., VA in 1830, Anderson's household was listed as 001010001-000111001.32 He has not been located in 1840, as the Anderson in that census appears to be his son.33 In 1850, he was living with daughter Susannah Taylor.34 He was aged 80 at that time. His occupation was wheelwright. In 1860, he was aged 91 when he was living with daughter Elizabeth Garrett.35\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Elizabeth, born probably c1786; her age in 1850, placing birth c1781 is probably too old; married Josiah Garrett, son of John Garrett, 30 Jan 1809, Campbell Co., VA.\n\nii. Susannah Suckey, born c1794, NC; died after 1860, probably Campbell Co., VA; married John Taylor, 20 Nov 1808, Campbell Co. VA. He died by October 1818. Anderson Williams was his administrator.\n\niii. Nancy, married George Fox, 14 Oct 1816, Bedford Co., VA; died after 1840, possibly in MO. No children were in the 1840 household.\n\niv. Mary V., born c1804; married James Collins, 16 Dec 1825, Campbell Co., VA. Both may have died as John A., aged 23, and Susan E. Collins, aged 21, were living with Susannah Taylor in 1850. This couple may have been siblings or married. However, no James and Mary Collins have been found who may be their parents.\n\nv. Daughter, born c1806; died after 1810.\n\nvi. Daughter, born c1808; died after 1810.\n\nvii. Anderson, born c1810; probably the male in the 1830 household, aged 20-30, married Martha A. Finch, 27 Nov 1833, Campbell Co., VA. Martha was the daughter of Barnet Finch.\n\nWilliam Ligon3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) , born 6 June 1771, probably Cumberland Co., VA, died by Oct 1848, Coles Co., IL.36 He married (1) Mary Gannaway, daughter of William and Elizabeth Wright Gannaway, bef 1 Dec 1794, Cumberland Co., VA. Mary reportedly died c1815, probably in Grayson Co., KY. (2) Catherine Keller Van Meter, 4 Oct 1830, Coles Co., IL. Catherine, the daughter of George and Sarah Keller, married (1) John Van Meter, survived William, and married (3) William D. Clark, 3 Oct 1849, Coles Co, IL. He was born c1796, KY. Catherine was born c1797, MD. Catherine probably died before Feb 1853, when William D. Clark married Amanda Hiemer, Coles Co. William moved to Wythe Co., VA shortly after he married Mary. He appears on the personal property tax rolls there from 1800-1805.37 He is not found again until 1813, when he appears on the Grayson Co., KY tax rolls.38 The family lived there until about 1830, as William L. is last on the Grayson tax rolls in 1829 and is on the 1830 Clark Co., IL census. In Grayson Co., KY 1820, the household consisted of 210201-11101.39 In 1830, Clark Co., IL, the family consisted of 00110001-00001.40 By 1840, when the family lived in Coles Co., IL, it looked like 0010000011-0301001.41 Keller Van Meter, 30, an idiot, b. KY, lived with the Clarks in 1850, as did Catherine, Harriet and Martha Williams.42\n\nChildren:\n\ni. John, born 22 Sept 1794, VA; died 25 Aug 1852, Hardin Co., KY; married (Ann) Nancy Neighbors, c1816. She was born 3 June 1797, VA or MD; died 16 Jan 1873, Hardin Co., KY.\n\nii. Elizabeth, born 31 Jan 1796, probably Wythe Co., VA; died 8 Aug 1861, Coles Co., IL, buried at Dry Grove Cemetery; married John Gannaway, son of Gregory Gannaway, c1811, probably KY. He was born 15 Nov 1789, Buckingham Co., VA; died 27 Feb 1875, Coles Co., IL.\n\niii. Samuel, born c1797, VA; died 28 Aug 1860, Hardin Co., KY; married Margaret Love. She was born 7 Dec 1800; died 23 Aug 1873, probably Hardin Co., KY.\n\niv. ?William G., born c1800; died before 28 July 1836, Coles Co., IL; married Finetta Gannaway, probably Grayson Co., KY. She married (2) Jacob Zion, 28 July 1836, Coles Co., IL as his second wife.\n\nv. Thomas, born c1802, probably Wythe Co., VA; died of cystitis, 2 July 1879, Cass Co., MO, aged 75 yrs.; married Sarah ( ), c1827, probably Grayson Co., KY. She was born 4 Jan 1808, KY; died 6 Sept 1882, Cass Co., MO.\n\nvi. Louisa Villars, born 30 Jan 1803, Grayson Co., KY; died 9 Sep 1897 in Arcola, Douglas, IL. She married William Ewing, 12 Sep 1822, Grayson Co. DAR members have joined under this line.\n\nvii. Susan, b. c1805, KY; died after 1850; married (1) Mr. Keller (probably George), c1828, probably Grayson Co., KY (2) John Allen Love, 5 Feb 1836, Coles Co., IL.\n\nviii. Mary, born c1807, KY; died 3 Jan 1881, Coles Co., IL; married (1) ?William Reynolds (2) Constant Williams, 25 Nov 1841, Coles Co., IL.\n\nix. Reuben, born c1812, probably KY; died 7 Apr 1848, Coles Co.,IL; buried on Granville Sheets' farm; married Sally Sheets, 15 Sept 1836, Coles Co., IL. Susan married (2) William L. Keller, 28 July 1853, Coles Co., IL.\n\nx. Robert Elliott Yates, born 1 Mar 1815, probably Grayson Co., KY; married Mary Ann Van Meter, 30 May 1839, Coles Co., IL. She was born 10 Aug 1817, KY; died 7 Mar 1911. Both are buried at Upper Muddy Cemetery, Coles Co., IL.\n\nxi. Catherine, born 2 Feb 1832, IL; died 31 May 1851, probably Coles Co., IL; unmarried.\n\nxii. Harriet, born 13 June 1833, IL; died 22 Oct 1886, probably Coles Co., IL; married Granville Parker Clark, son of William D. Clark, 15 May 1854, Coles Co., IL.\n\nxiii. Martha Greenwood, born 24 Apr 1835, IL; d. 8 Oct 1889, probably Coles Co., IL; married Myron J. Ferguson, 20 Dec 1853, Coles Co., IL. He was born 7 Mar 1828; died 24 May 1875.\n\nJohn3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c1773, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died before Oct 1853, Roane Co., TN, when his will was probated.43 He married Mary Lee, daughter of Joseph Lee, before 1 Dec 1794, Cumberland Co. In his will, he named only three sons. However, there are several females who appear to be daughters in the 1830 census household who are gone by 1840. Perhaps John gave his daughters their shares of his estate when they married as dowry. It is also possible that because the girls moved to Kentucky they may have received something when they left. There are also several male Williamses who married in Roane Co. before 1840 who might be children of this couple. Therefore, this family unit is open to further research, with the exception of William, Richard and Edward who were named in the will.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. ?Parmelia Jane Alirra Sarah Ann Keziah, born c1802, VA; died 25 Oct 1894, Crittenden Co., KY; married Peter Fritts, 24 Dec 1825, Roane Co., TN. He was born c1801, Lincoln Co., NC; died 20 Apr 1883, Crittenden Co., KY. \"Keziah\" is an uncommon name in this branch of the Williams family, making it seem more likely that Parmelia might be a child of John, the Revolutionary War pensioner. However, Mary Lee Williams had a sister, Keziah, who was married to William Cox at the time their father wrote his will. One of Parmelia's names may have been given in honor of her aunt.\n\nii. ?Mary, born c1806, died after 1870, probably Roane Co., TN; married John Henry Fritts, 2 Jul 1831, Roane Co., TN.\n\niii. William, born 27 Oct 1807-1810, possibly in VA, but more likely in TN; died 15 Nov 1888, probably Webster Co., MO; married Mary Hicks, daughter of John and Nancy Hicks, 28 Dec 1830, Roane Co., TN. She was born 6 June 1816, TN; died 16 Nov 1892, probably Webster Co., MO. They removed to Greene Co., MO by 1850.\n\niv. ?Frances Jane, born 16 May 1813, TN; died 3 Jul 1884, probably Maries Co., MO; She is buried at Walker Cemetery, Vichy, Maries, Missouri. She married Philip Fritts, 15 Dec 1830, Roane Co., TN.\n\nv. ?John E., born c1815; married Polly Cofer, 29 Jan 1836, Roane Co. This couple is not found in the 1850 census.\n\nvi. Edward, born c1818, TN, died after 1880; married Mahala Gardner, c1836. She was born 8 Jan 1817, TN; died 19 Mar 1883, probably Loudon Co., TN.\n\nvii. Richard, born c1822, TN; died after 1870, probably Crittenden Co., KY; married (1) Letta Hembree, 14 Dec 1841, Roane Co. (2) Mary Evaline Fritts, 14 Mar 1844, Roane Co. He removed to Kentucky with the Fritts family.\n\nCharles3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c1775, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died between Aug 1825, when his will was written and Jan 1826, when it was probated in Morgan Co., TN.44 He married (1) Unknown and (2) Elizabeth (Goddard?) Cobb, before Aug 1825, probably Morgan Co. Charles appears on the tax rolls of Cumberland Co., VA in 1789, when he was about 16, and then again from 1796-1801.45 In 1802-1804, he appears on the Wythe Co., VA tax rolls with his brother, William L. Williams.46 Also, on 13 June 1804 Wythe Co., Charles was ordered to appear on July 1 in Wythe Co. Court with Joseph Newland and William L. Williams to prove the marriage contract between John Newland and Elizabeth Gannaway.47 Within a year or so, Charles moved on to Tennessee. Elizabeth Cobb appears to have been the mother of Susannah Williams (probably should be Cobb) who married Ethelbert Ezell, 6 Apr 1846, White Co., IL48 and Frances W. Cobb who married Thomas G. Rattorree49 and moved to Tallahatchie Co., MS before 1850.50 Susannah Ezell and Frances Rattorree are not in Charles Williams will. Widow Elizabeth Williams was born c1761-70; died 25 June 1843, Morgan Co., TN.51 In 1840, widow Elizabeth was living alone in Morgan County, again in the age bracket for a 1760-70 birth. She died 25 June 1843, according to Morgan County court records.52 The 5 June 1833 issue of the Western Chronicle newspaper listed a sheriffs sale in Morgan Co. Julian Scott was authorized to sell the interest of Nathaniel M. Goddard in 30 acres on the Emory River and the interest of John Stallcup in 50 acres adjoining Henry B. Goddard and Elizabeth Williams.53\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Reuben, born c1798, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died c1837, probably Morgan Co., TN, married Mahuldah Cobb, 7 Dec 1819, Roane Co., TN. She died after March 1844.\n\nii. Mary, born c1800, probably Cumberland Co., VA, died before March 1844. She married William Cobb, before Aug 1825, probably Morgan Co., TN and they removed to Mississippi. He also died before Mar 1844.\n\niii. Susannah, born 4 Feb 1802, probably Cumberland Co., VA, died 6 Oct 1887, Morgan Co., TN; married Shadrach Stephens, 8 Oct 1817, Roane Co., TN. He was born Feb 1791, SC; died 26 Dec 1856, Morgan Co., TN.\n\niv. Amanda, born c1804, died c1839; married Joseph A. Davis, c1825, probably Morgan Co., TN.\n\nv. William G., born c1806, died after March 1844, when a court record was filed stating that he was living in IL.\n\nvi. Charles C., born c1808, probably TN; died before March 1844, said to have been in either KY or IL.\n\nvii. Malinda, born c1810; died after 1844, possibly in Warren Co., KY; married David M. C. Rector after Aug 1825 and before 1828, probably Morgan Co., TN. He was born c1800-1810; died Apr 1848, Molino de Rey, Mexico. There is some confusion about this couple, as they are named in a March 1844 court record as residing in Warren Co., KY. However, David was living in Morgan Co. in 1840 with his mother and he remarried in 1843 in Jackson Co., TN. It is not known whether David and Malinda divorced or if she died.\n\nReuben3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c1777, probably Cumberland Co., VA; married Elizabeth Butler, 25 June 1801, Campbell Co., VA. She was the daughter of Thomas Butler who died in Anderson Co., TN in 1814. Death dates are unknown for Reuben and Elizabeth, although Reuben was last mentioned in court records in July 1828. While there is no positive proof that Reuben is the father of any of the later Williamses, there is also no evidence to prove that this couple had no children. It is possible that Reuben and Elizabeth had more daughters than sons and, thus, with lost records in Anderson and Morgan Cos., evidence is gone. There are two girls in the marriage records of Roane Co., where Reuben was apparently living at the time, who may be daughters of this couple. Amanda and Amelia (which probably should be \"Permelia\", per name on her gravestone) married cousins George and Thomas Gallaher. Robert Williams is often linked with the Gallahers in land transactions, although his children did not marry into this family. There is no documentation found so far linking the Gallahers to the John/Matthias branch of the family. There is a Reuben Williams on the Roane County tax list for 1834, taxed for 280 acres of land. Reuben is not on the 1835 list, but Thomas and Permelia Gallaher moved from Knox to Roane County about that time. In 1835, Thomas Gallaher is taxed for 280 acres of land.54\n\nThe fact that George and Amanda Gallaher went to Coles Co., IL, where William Ligon Williams (brother of Robert, Reuben, etc.) had moved also indicates a possible tie to Robert's side of the family. These girls married in 1823, probably at least 15 when they married, putting their birth years no later than 1808. Of the Virginia Williams brothers in Tennessee, children of Robert and Charles are accounted for, per Bible or will records. Benjamin appears to have married for the first time in 1815, so he is too young to be their father. John who married Polly Lee could be their father. However, three Williams girls who appear to be sisters (Parmelia Jane, Frances Jane and Mary Ann) married three Fritts brothers. Parmelia and Frances Fritts moved to Kentucky with Richard Williams, a son of John and Polly Lee Williams. That appears to rule out John as the Gallaher wives' father. The remaining brother is Reuben, who married Elizabeth Butler in 1801. Now, Amanda Williams Gallaher had several children. One of her daughters, Lalelia Parmelia, died in 1916 in Cedar Co., NB. Her death certificate identifies her father as George Gallaher and her mother as a Butler, born in TN. Amanda died as a young woman c1836, so it is not surprising that her grandchild might not know her maiden name. However, the relative apparently knew there was a Butler connection. If Amanda was the daughter of Reuben and Elizabeth Williams, then the connection is apparent - Elizabeth was the Butler. Amanda naming her dau \"Lalelia Permelia\" also lends credence to the idea that Amanda and Amelia/Permelia were sisters. Evidence of the parentage of these girls is very circumstantial, but until more information is found, it appears that they may belong in this family.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. ?Amanda, born perhaps c1802, probably VA; died c1835, probably Coles Co., IL; married George Gallaher, 8 Dec 1823, Roane Co., TN. George married (2) Levina Zion, 10 Mar 1836, Coles Co., IL. He died 10 Apr 1842, Des Moines Co., IA, buried in the Gallaher Cemetery there.\n\nii. ?Permelia, born 21 Apr 1806, probably TN; died 8 June 1838, probably Roane Co., TN; buried in Gallaher Cemetery, Roane Co.; married Thomas Gallaher, 3 Aug 1823, Roane Co. Marriage record transcription shows her as \"Amelia\", but gravestone says \"Permelia\". Thomas was born 20 May 1800, Knox Co., TN; died 20 Aug 1872, Roane Co., TN; he was the son of George B. and Sarah Oats Gallaher of Knox Co., TN. If Permelia was the sister of Elizabeth who married Thomas Gallaher after she died, then she is a daughter of Benjamin Williams. Some believe the two were not sisters.\n\niii. ?Thomas, born 19 Jan 1808, Roane, TN; died 18 Dec 1895, Fayette, IL; married Alesy Gammon, 12 Oct 1830, Roane Co., TN. She was born 31 Jan 1811, TN; died 21 Aug 1877, Fayette, IL. She was the daughter of John Gammon. Both are buried in Harris Cemetery, Fayette Co., IL.\n\nSamuel3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born 19 Mar 1781, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died c1850, probably Bedford Co., VA where his will was probated.55 The will index lists all of his sons as heirs, but neither daughter. Unlike several of his brothers, Samuel did not go to Tennessee or Kentucky. Instead, he remained in Virginia, but migrated westward to Bedford County, in the same area where Roger Williams lived. Samuel married Betsey Wingo, Dec. 1803, Amelia Co., VA. She was born 19 June 1784 and died 19 June 1840 in Virginia.56 In 1840, Samuel's household consisted of 002150021-00020001.57 Perhaps farm workers were included in the enumeration.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Albert G., born 1 Dec 1805, VA; died shortly aft the 1850 census, as there was an administration of his estate from 1850-1855; married (1) Elizabeth T. Quarles, 9 Apr 1827, Bedford Co., VA, William J.A. Quarles, surety; she was the daughter of Samuel Quarles; she was born c1809; died 23 July 1835, Bedford Co., VA (2) Matilda Stoner, 23 July 1836, Bedford Co., VA. Matilda was born c1814, VA; died after 1850. She was the daughter of Daniel Stoner.\n\nii. Edward D., born 3 Jan 1807, VA; died 1887, Phelps Co., MO; married Martha Jones, 21 Oct 1826, Bedford Co., VA. Martha died after 1887, probably in Roanoke Co., VA.\n\niii. James Madison, born 28 Oct 1808, VA, died 17 Jan 1873, Bedford Co., VA; married Harriet P. Sublett, 22 June 1830, Bedford Co., VA. She was born c1807; died 1 May 1875, Bedford Co., VA. She was the daughter of Peter and Nancy Sublett.\n\niv. William R., born 5 Dec 1810, VA; died after 1860; married Betsey Farmer, 17 July 1843, Bedford Co., VA. Betsey was born c1820, VA; died after 1860. She was the daughter of Marshall B. Farmer.\n\nv. Samuel Wingo, born 8 Mar 1813, VA; died after 1874; married (1) possibly Mary Jane Owens, 5 Oct 1840, Powhatan Co., VA; she was a niece of Elizabeth and Nancy Sublett and the daughter of William Owens, deceased; guardian was William Graves (2) Sarah Ann Scruggs, 14 Sept 1846, Bedford Co., VA. Samuel filed for bankruptcy in 1874, because of losses from the Civil War.\n\nvi. John A., born 8 Feb 1816, VA; died after 1860; married Sarah Miller, c1838.\n\nvii. Elizabeth Frances, born 20 Mar 1821, VA; died 14 Sept 1858, Bedford Co., VA of consumption; married Giles T. Quarles, 6 Apr 1840, Bedford Co., VA. He was born c1814; died c1871, when his estate was probated in Bedford Co.\n\nviii. Martha A., born 5 Apr 1823, VA; died 17 Apr 1890; married David Stoner, 12 Sept 1844, Bedford Co., VA. He was born 16 May 1818, VA; died 29 Nov 1872.\n\nix. Septimus Ligon, born 18 Jan 1829, VA; died 1 Jan 1912, probably Phelps Co., MO; married Sarah Frances White, 12 July 1847, Bedford Co., VA. Sarah was born 20 Jan 1819, VA; died 26 Dec 1882, probably Phelps Co., MO. She was the daughter of Matilda Thaxton. Septimus and Sarah are buried in Williams Cemetery, Phelps Co., MO.\n\nBenjamin3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c1785, VA; died 1 June 1852, Roane Co., TN.58 A Roane County marriage record for 4 June 1815 shows Benjamin marrying Cizire, no last name given. She was born c1791-1800; died c1840-50, probably Roane Co. He married (2) Nancy McCormack , 23 June 1851, Roane Co., TN. It appears that the B. Williams who died intestate and insolvent in Anderson Co., TN before the 22 March 1855 court record may be Benjamin. Benjamin seems to have had difficulty managing financial affairs. His father, Samuel, in his will wrote Ben Williams 150 lbs. It is my will and desire that, that part of my estate in money which may fall to my son Benjamin Williams part after accounting as my other children do for the amount which I have thought just and proper to charge each one with in order to as equal division among them all as possible to be paid by my executors over to my two sons Namely Reubin and Robert in trust for the benefit of my son Benjamin and family to be in their discretion laid out in property for the use of him and family, and by no means subject to his wast(e) or control to the prejudice of him and family but entirely discretionary with the above named Reubin and Robert Williams during the life of my son Benjamin Williams and at his death to be equally divided among his children or their representatives. In 1830, William Staples, sheriff of Morgan Co. sold the interest of Benjamin Williams in 80 acres on the Little Emery, so he appeared to continue to have financial problems. Nancy survived Benjamin and years later filed for a widows pension based on Benjamins War of 1812 service, as a corporal under Capt. Lunsford Oliver. In the application, Nancy stated that Benjamins first wife was Kersa Williams and that she had died long ago. Cizire and Kersa could be corruptions of the name Keziah. If so, and from Nancys statement that his first wifes maiden name was also Williams, then Benjamin may have married a Williams cousin. The name Keziah occurs in the family branch of Matthias Williams. This Keziah could have been a daughter of either Matthias the Revolutionary War pensioner or John, also a Revolutionary War pensioner. This is all speculative, but if Benjamin only married twice, then Cizire appears to be the mother of all his children. In 1830, his household appears as 1000001-101001.59 By 1840, Benjamins household consisted of himself, a female who is probably Cizire, and three children corresponding to the ages of William, Nancy and Martha, living with Benjamin in 1850.60\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Elizabeth, born 16 Nov 1817, TN; died 21 July 1884; buried at Gallaher Cemetery, Roane Co., TN; married Thomas Gallaher, 26 Mar 1839, Roane Co., TN as his second wife.\n\nii. William, born c1827; died between 24 June 1884 and the July 1884 court term, Roane Co., TN; married Margaret H. Edwards, 26 Mar 1854, Roane, TN. On 29 Apr 1869, the Roane Co. Chancery Court allowed their divorce based on her adultery. William was to retain custody of the children.\n\niii. Martha J.P., born 9 Dec 1829, TN; died 4 May 1918, probably Roane Co., TN; buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery, Roane Co., TN; married Lorenzo Dow Brashears, 20 Aug 1852, Roane Co., TN. He was born 13 Sept 1813 (or 1820 per the 1860 census); died 1 May 1889, Roane Co., TN.\n\niv. Nancy A., born c1833, TN; died after 1880, when she lived with widowed sister, Elizabeth Gallaher.61 Nancy apparently did not marry.\n\nRobert3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born 15 Aug 1786, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died 26 July 1865, probably Roane Co., TN where he left a will.62 He married Sarah Ann Manley, 6 Sept 1803, in VA TN.63 She was born 19 July 1787, VA; died 23 Mar 1875, probably Loudon County, TN. She was the daughter of Ancel and Elizabeth Butler Manley, Ancel was a Revlutionary War pensioner. Their graves are at Eatons Cross Road, Loudon County, TN behind a house that belonged to their son, Samuel.62 Robert was a Methodist minister. The family Bible states that he began preaching in 1810.63 Robert opposed the division of the Methodist Church and didnt want to be associated with the south branch. He was a strong Union man during the Civil War and was an old line Whig, politically. According to the family Bible of his son, Robert and Sarah were the parents of only two children.\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Polly Ellender, born 26 Aug 1805, probably TN; died Dec 1859, probably Roane Co., TN; married Willis S. Pruitt, 22 Mar (no year, but c1820).\n\nii. Samuel Manley, born 2 Feb 1827, TN; died 31 Aug 1904, probably Loudon Co., TN; married (1) Frances Jane Browder Jackson, 30 Dec 1845, Roane Co., TN. She was born 16 July 1827, TN; died 28 Nov 1883, probably Roane Co., TN. Frances was the daughter of Josiah and Mary E. (Browder) Jackson. (2) Martha A. Ross, 14 June 1892, Morgan Co., TN. She died 3 Mar 1898, Morgan Co., TN.\n\nJoseph L.3 (Samuel2, Thomas1) was born 14 May 1789, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died probably 29 May 1862, Howard Co., MO64; married Susan Woodson, 10 June 1815, Cumberland Co., VA. Susan was born 10 May 1799, VA; died 6 May 1863, Howard Co., MO. The Ligon Family states he also married Elizabeth Raine, with no date given. If so, the marriage would seem to have to have taken place before 1815, with Elizabeth dying young and apparently leaving no children.65 However, there is a question as to the identity of Joseph in the 1820 Cumberland Co., VA census. In that Joseph Williams' household, the enumeration indicates 00001-0101,66 placing his birth between 1775-1794, with a female born also 1775-1794. There is also a female, 10-16 years old. There is something amiss in trying to fit this to Joseph who married Susan Woodson in 1815. Is there a second Joseph Williams, about the same age? There is a marriage for a Joseph Williams to an Elizabeth Harrison on 11 Sept 1805 in Cumberland Co. This family would fit the pattern of a couple married in 1805, with one child, 10-16 years old. In 1817, in Cumberland Co., VA Joseph sold land to Thomas Pankey.67 By 1820, Joseph and Susannah Williams sold land to Nancy Shepard, also in Cumberland County.68 In 1840, Joseph's household is shown as 0111001-201101, which fits Susan's age.69 The 1850 Howard Co., MO census70 lists Susan immediately after Joseph and shows her as 15 years old. This may be an error. Perhaps it should be Susan, age 51, as the date would then match a gravestone for Joseph's wife. A gravestone inscription says Susan died 1826, but perhaps should be 1862, which would fit with other known facts. In Howard Co., 1860, Joseph L. was 70, Susan was 60 and Madison B., 18, and Robert W., 16, were still in the household.71\n\nChildren:\n\ni. Mary Ann Catherine, born 15 Apr 1815, VA; died 4 Aug 1908, Rooks Co., KS; married (1) Joseph Snavely, 20 Dec 1838, Howard Co., MO; Joseph died before 4 Apr 1843, when administration of his estate was granted. (2) Richard Stagner, 31 Dec 1844, Howard Co, MO.\n\nii. John, perhaps born c1818, VA; reportedly married twice.\n\niii. Thomas, born c1820, VA; perhaps the male born 1820-25 in the 1840 household. Thomas would have been younger than John, if the family listing in the Ligon book is in birth order. Not in household in 1850.\n\niv. Margaret A., born c1826; died after 1850; married John W. Craig, 23 Jan 1844, Howard Co., MO. He was born c1817, MO; died after 1850.\n\nv. Benjamin, born c1831, MO; died after 1850.\n\nvi. James A., born c1833, VA; died after 1850.\n\nvii. Juda Frances, born 31 Mar 1836, VA; married Ephraim Snavely, 20 Jan 1859, Howard Co., MO as his second wife. He was born c1820, VA; married (1) Eliza Jane Burnit/Barns, 13 Dec 1840, Howard Co., MO.\n\nviii. Daughter, born c1838; probably died young, as she is not in 1850 household.\n\nix. Madison B., born c1841, MO; married (1) Nancy Jane Snavely, 15 Dec 1865, Howard Co., MO. Nancy was born 9 July 1849, MO; died 10 Jan 1881, probably Howard Co., MO (2) Nellie Mordock; had children Louisa and Ida. Nancy Jane Snavely may be the daughter of Ephraim Snavely and his first wife, Eliza Jane. They had a daughter Nancy who was about one year old in 1850. The age matches the age of \"Nannie\" Williams who died.\n\nx. Robert W., born c1844, MO; died after 1860.\n\nNotes\n\n1Pittsylvania County, Virginia 1820 census, p. 56.\n\n2Pittsylvania County, Virginia 1830 census, p. 361.\n\n3Dates are cited from a Fontaine family Bible, but current whereabouts of Bible are unknown.\n\n4Robertson County, Tennessee 1850 census, p. 246.\n\n5Rockingham County, North Carolina 1800 census, p. 445.\n\n6Williamson County, Tennessee 1820 census, p. 2.\n\n7Maury County, Tennessee 1830 census, p. 322.\n\n8Williamson County, Tennessee Court Loose Records, 13 Oct 1821.\n\n9Marshall County, Tennessee Deed Book A:187.\n\n10Marshall County, Tennessee Deed Book A: 137.\n\n11Marshall County, Tennessee Deed Book C:323.\n\n12Marshall County, Tennessee Deed Book C:403.\n\n13Marshall County, Tennessee 1840 census, p. 205.\n\n14Marshall County, Tennessee Will Book A:82.\n\n15Maury County, Tennessee 1850 census, p. 659.\n\n16Rockingham County, North Carolina 1800 census, p. 445.\n\n17Pittsylvania County, Virginia 1820 census, p. 52.\n\n18Maury County, Tennessee 1830 census, p. 322.\n\n19Deed from Charles and Susannah Williams et.al. to Henry Sergeant, Deed Book 30:277, Pittsylvania County, Virginia.\n\n20Marshall County, Tennessee 1840 census, p. 209.\n\n21Williamson County, Tennessee Will Book 8:283.\n\n22Williamson County, Tennessee Will Book 7:366.\n\n23Rockingham County, North Carolina 1800 census, p. 445.\n\n24Deed from John and Susannah Crouch to Major Brockman, Deed Book N:21, Caswell County, North Carolina.\n\n25Pittsylvania County, Virginia Personal Property Tax Lists, FHL Film #1,870,198.\n\n26Loose Records, October 1816, 30 August 1817, Williamson Co., TN.\n\n27Williamson County, Tennessee Will Book 1:61.\n\n28Williamson County, Tennessee Loose Records, October 1816, Ware v.

John appears to have died by 5 Sept 1818 and definitely bef 9 Dec 1822, when Anderson Williams was administrator of his estate. Several report dates and inventories are listed in the 1822 court record.48 The first court record of John Taylor, deceased, was entered on 5 Sept 1818. Anderson Williams was appointed administrator on 10 Oct 1818. Inventory was recorded on 9 Mar 1819 and the estate was settled 14 Oct 1822. Her father, Anderson Williams, aged 80, was living with her in 1850 in Bedford Co., VA. Also in the household were John A. Collins, 23, and Susan E. Collins, 21. John may have been a son of Susannahs sister, Mary V. who married James Collins on 16 Dec 1825 in Campbell County. Susannah is not found in the 1830 census. However, there are members in Anderson Williams' household who match the ages of Susannah, Mary, Mildred and James.49 They most likely were living with her father. In 1840, Susannah was enumerated as head of household with two children matching the ages of Mary and James.50\n\nChildren: (Taylor)\n\ni. Mary B., born c1811, VA; died after 1850 when she was unmarried.\n\nii. Mildred, born c1815, VA; died after 1860; married Harrison Farmer, c1835. Susannah was living with this family in 1860. Since her mother was named Mildred, quite an uncommon name at that time, it appears Mildred Farmer may have been her daughter. No marriage bond has been found in Bedford Co. Perhaps they married in Campbell Co., VA.\n\niii. James W., born c1816, VA. He was a farmer, unmarried in 1850.\n\nElizabeth4 (Anderson3, Samuel2, Thomas1) was born c178151 (per 1850 census) but perhaps closer to c1786, probably Cumberland Co., VA; died 1866, Botetourt Co., VA52; married Josiah Garrett, 30 Jan 1809, Campbell Co., VA.

In 1860, Anderson's real estate was valued at $1500.56 Personal property was listed as $4000. There is a will recorded for one Martha F. Williams on 7 Aug 1874, Campbell County.

William G. died before William Ligon Williams and, thus, is not named in his will. However, the other William G. Williams, about the same age, was the son of William L.s brother, Charles Williams of Morgan Co., TN, and was reportedly living in either Illinois or Kentucky in Mar 1844. It is likely that William who married Finetta was the son of William Ligon Williams. The Zions had removed to Des Moines Co., IA by 1840. William G.'s household in 1830 showed 10011-2010201.71 Who the others were is not known.\n\nChildren:72\n\ni. William G., born 9 Sept 1825; died after 1850.\n\nii.

She was born 4 Jan 1809, KY; died 6 Sept 1882, Cass Co., MO.74 This family removed from Hardin Co., KY between 1850-60. There is no document proving that this Thomas is the son of William. However, William L. was known to have a son named Thomas who, according to The Ligon Family book, died in Chillicothe, MO in 1886. This Thomas died slightly earlier, but lived near the town of Chilihowee. Also, he named a son Ligon, which appears to be another tie to William Ligon Williams family. Also, the Grayson Co., KY tax rolls show a Thomas Williams there until the late 1820s.75 William L. left KY about 1829. Lastly, Thomas first lived in Johnson Co., MO by 1860.76 He lived only 15 doors from James Gallaher. Assuming he is William L.s son, Thomas lived nearby an in-law of two of his Williams cousins who married into the Gallaher family in Roane Co., TN.

By 1870, Jonathan was married to Ellen with John W. 5 and Nancy 3. It doesnt appear that Elizabeth had children. Perhaps she died in childbirth.\n\nvi. Azariah Shelton/Chilton, born c1845, KY; died 5 Jan 1878, Cass Co., MO, aged 32 years; married M.S. ( ), c1877.

There is some confusion with this family, as Peter Miller, 34, in Coles Co. in 1850 is living near other Williams family members.82 However, his wife is Caroline E. Children in the household include Mary E., 4, and Simpson, 9/12, both born IL. It appears that Mary Ann may have died giving birth and Peter remarried c1849. However, if so, the 1855 death date is incorrect. Other possibilities include a divorce or some other Peter Miller who moved away from Coles Co.\n\niii.
