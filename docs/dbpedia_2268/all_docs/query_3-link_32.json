        "text": "Hillsborough-Mr. Willie E Williams, 81, passed away Tuesday, December 13, 2022, in his home.\n\nHe was a native of Orange County all his life. He was employed with Cone Mills for many years. He enjoyed working on small equipment and enjoyed his time working at Dual Supply as a mechanic on small engines.\n\nWillie is survived by his wife Dorothy Williams for which they just celebrated their 5-year anniversary a few days ago. In addition, he is survived by sisters-in-law and brothers-in law and nieces and nephews.\n\nWillie was preceded in death by his parents, Martin and Annie Bell Williams, his wife Shirley Pittman Williams, brothers: Jimmy Williams, Larry Williams, George Williams, sisters: Marie Williams Howard and Marilyn Williams Pittman.\n\nAfter many years living alone, The Lord blessed Willie with a new love in his life, Dorothy. Although their time together was only 5 years, he was a happy and blessed man, and likewise Dorothy was so blessed to have such a wonderful and kind-hearted husband.\n\nIt is with sincere gratitude to everyone taking care of Mr. Williams during his time of sickness. Community Home Care & Hospice of Burlington was also involved with his care,\n\nThe visitation will be held at Gospel Baptist Tabernacle Church, 2646 Orange Grove Rd, Hillsborough NC on Friday, December 16, 2022, from 12-1 PM, with a graveside service in church cemetery to follow."
