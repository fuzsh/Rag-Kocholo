        "text": "CHAPTER ONE\n\nThe Earliest Records of the Williams Family in Cumberland County, Virginia\n\nThis family history will attempt to piece together several generations of the Williams family traced back to its earliest point in Cumberland County, Virginia in the pre-Revolutionary War years with some clues pointing to earlier residence in New Kent, Hanover and Goochland Counties, Virginia. As early as the 1760s, marriages were occurring in counties surrounding Cumberland between Williams men and their brides. These families remained in Cumberland County for most of the 1700s. However, a great migration began to take place in the years just after the close of the American Revolution, when families headed westward through Virginia to Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and points beyond.\n\nIt is possible to identify the nucleus of the western settlers by examining Cumberland County land deeds, probate, census and court records. There were three men born between 1712 and the late 1720s who lived in Cumberland County. Roger Williams was the first. Little is known of this man, except that he gave a tract of land to Roger Jr. in 1773, stating me hereunto moving.1 The relationship of the other two, Thomas and Matthias Williams, is certain because of a land transaction from Thomas to his brother, Matthias, in 1763.2\n\nThere are many families who have a folklore-type of tradition of three brothers coming to America. That same story has also been handed down among the Williamses. However, in this case, there are pieces of information that indicate that these three men might have been part of a family of a Roger Williams, born in the late 1600's.\n\nFirst, Harriet Williams Pryor was the subject of a biographical sketch in the late 1800's in one of Goodspeed's books.3 Her sketch said she was descended from Roger Williams, although it identified Roger as Roger Williams of Rhode Island. While there is no indication that she fit into any New England group, she may, indeed, have been descended from a Roger Williams.\n\nThere are a number of names common to early Hanover County, Virginia that later appear in Goochland County. Several families appear to have moved in the same era to the area that later became Cumberland County, Virginia. Virginia land patent records show a Roger Williams receiving 200 acres of land adjoining John Johnson and Robert Allin (sic) on the north side of Chickahominy Swamp in New Kent County, VA as early as 1719.4 By Sept 1723, John Johnson received 250 acres on Chickahominy Swamp, now in Hanover County, on the lines of John Hogg and Roger Williams.5\n\nThere is a land deed dated Feb 1728/9 with Bouth Napier of Goochland selling land to Phillip Webber of King William County.6 The land was part of Thomas Mims' patent on Tuckahoe Creek. This sale was witnessed by Elizabeth Napier and William and Mary Williams. A William Williams died intestate in Cumberland Co. in 1761.7 It is not known whether this is the same man. However, later Williamses owned land on Tuckahoe Creek.\n\nThe Vestry Book of St. Paul's Parish in Hanover Co. mentions in 1730 that the tithes of Capt. Thomas Anderson are to assist Roger Williams in clearing the road of which he is surveyor.8 The will of one Thomas Anderson was written 25 Oct 1757 and recorded 9 Mar 1758 in Albemarle County, Virginia.9 He named daughter Susannah Williams, among others, with witnesses shown to be John Gannaway Jr., John Gannaway Sr. and Roger Williams Sr. It is believed that this Susannah Anderson was the wife of Thomas Williams of Cumberland County. Thomas Anderson and Roger Williams in Hanover Co. may be the same men as those in Albemarle.\n\nIn Aug 1731, Michael Holland received 6,350 acres in Hanover Co. The land was adjacent to many men, including Roger Williams, John Johnson, Robert Allen and Thomas Lacy Jr.10\n\nOn 6 Nov 1734, one Thomas Williams was a witness noted in the Hanover Co. court minutes.11 Samuel's father, Thomas, was born in 1712 according to the Bible record.12 If the same man, Thomas would have been 22 and of legal age in 1734.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous records in Goochland County naming other Williams men along with surnames connected to the Williamses by marriage. Some of those early Williamses were Edward, John, William, Samuel and Robert. All are given names appearing in the Cumberland County group a generation later. Associated surnames with these Williamses in land deeds, wills or court records include Womack, Holman, Witt, Crouch, Woodson, and Wright. Those same names are also closely associated with the families of Roger, Thomas and Matthias Williams in Cumberland County.\n\nIn the adult lifetimes of Roger, Thomas and Matthias Williams, there are several records which indicate a relationship among Roger and Thomass family and Roger and Matthiass family.\n\nThomas Williams sold land in 1765 that was adjacent to Richard Randolph's property.13 Roger Williams land also bordered Richard Randolphs. Additionally, Cumberland Co., VA court orders for 28 August 1787 record Roger and Samuel Williams as administrators of the estate of Thomas Fitch, deceased.14 They had sued David Meade Randolph and Richard Randolph as executors of the estate of Richard Randolph, deceased. The relationship between Thomas Fitch and the Williamses is unknown, but perhaps he was a neighbor and there was a dispute over land ownership. On this particular day, the judgement against the Randolph defendants was set aside. Later, on 27 Mar 1788, Roger and Samuel Williams, administrators for Thomas Fitch, won another judgement against the Randolphs and Thomas Williams was paid 75 lbs. of tobacco for three days as a witness.\n\nCourt records of Halifax and Pittsylvania counties in Virginia show that one Thomas Williams, son of Roger, entered land in Pittsylvania Co. in 1752.15 Court pleas note in 1755 that Thomas Williams was the executor of Roger Williams, deceased.16 These records, if related to the Cumberland group, may actually refer to the earliest Roger in New Kent Co. in 1719 and Thomas later of Cumberland County.\n\nThomas Williams was a witness on behalf of Roger Williams in a 1755 lawsuit against William Hudgens in Cumberland County.17\n\nIn Cumberland County Court in 1763, Thomas Williams was sued for debt.18 His bondsmen were John Gannaway and Charles Williams (probably the Charles who lived in Halifax Co., VA, later Pittsylvania Co., VA). A son of this Charles, also named Charles, married Susannah Williams, daughter of Roger Williams and Cassie Ann Blair in 1797. This third Roger was the son of Roger b. in the 1720s.\n\nThomas Williams, son of Matthias Williams, married Esther Morrow on 6 Aug 1780 in Prince Edward County. Roger Williams was the surety.\n\nIn Jan 1788, Thomas Williams sold land to Archibald Wright.19 The 200 acres were part of a tract conveyed to Samuel Williams, bounded by lands of said Samuel, Alexander Trent and Seymore Scott. Thomas noted the sale took place because of the 5 shillings received by Thomas, plus the 200 lbs. current money paid in hand to Roger Williams. Witnesses were John Lee, Saymer Scott and Creed Taylor.\n\nBy Nov 1790, Samuel Williams had been named guardian to Samuel, Nancy, Benjamin, Hannah and Saymour Scott, infant children of Saymour Scott, deceased, for the purpose of defending them in a suit in chancery brought by Benjamin and Sally Whitehead for the division of the decedents estate.20 In addition, Samuel and Mary Williams, William and Elizabeth Gannaway, John Wright, Saymour Wright, John and Ann Holman and Benjamin Wright sued Hannah Scott, adminstrator of Saymour Scott, deceased.\n\nApparently, the dispute arose because Saymour Scott had been the administrator of John Wright, deceased and the Wright heirs felt that additional money was owed to them. Interestingly, Saymour Wright married Frances Williams, daughter of Elvira Woodson Williams in Campbell Co. on 11 Aug 1788. Saymer Scott and John Woodson were bondsmen. Elviras apparently deceased husband and his relationship, if any, to the Cumberland Co. Williamses has not been discovered.\n\nBy Mar 1798, Samuel Williams was appointed to appraise Hannah Scotts estate, along with Richard Gorden, John Lancaster and Peter Francis.21\n\nSeveral citizens petitions that were generated and signed in Cumberland County survive, giving further evidence as to the time period that the Williams family lived there.22 On 10 May 1777, one petition was begun urging that Cumberland County be divided in two. Roger Jr., Thomas, Samuel and Roger Williams Sr. all signed. On 10 Nov 1780, a petition was circulated regarding rights of clergy who did not sign allegiance to the state. Samuel, Roger Jr. and Matthias Williams' signatures are found. This Matthias must be the Revolutionary War pensioner because his father's will was probated earlier in the year. A similar petition with the same date showed Thomas and Roger Williams Sr.'s signatures. On 14 May 1784, rights of pecuniary legatees and residual legatees were questioned. John, Roger, Samuel and Nathaniel Williams signed. Lastly, opposition to the act incorporating the Protestant Episcopal Church on 9 Nov 1786 included Thomas, Samuel, Nathaniel, Roger and Matthias Williams.\n\nThe above details are included in this introduction so that, perhaps in the future, someone may use this information to determine if the eldest Roger found in New Kent and Hanover Counties is indeed the father of Roger, Thomas and Matthias Williams and, thus, the immigrant progenitor of this line of Williamses.\n\nNotes\n\n1.Deed from Roger Williams to Roger Williams, Deed Book 5:149, Cumberland County, Virginia.\n\n2.Deed from Thomas Williams to Matthias Williams, Deed Book 2:239, Cumberland County, Virginia.\n\n3.Memorial and Biographical Record, An Illustrated Compendium. . . .of the Cumberland Region of Tennessee, George A.

He is referred to as Roger1 since, at this time, there is no proof that Roger born in the 1600s was the father of this man. It is also not known whether he had children other than Roger Jr. Roger Sr. recorded a land deed in Cumberland County, VA on 26 Apr 1773 transferring 350 acres on the Ash River to Roger Jr., stating that he was hereunto moving. It is likely that Roger Sr. had other children, but they have not have been identified.\n\nIt seems strange that no other potential children have been identified for this man and absolutely no clues have been found as to the possible name of his wife. Since Cumberland County was formed from Goochland, perhaps other children still lived there or moved back as they reached adulthood. Another possibility is that Roger and Cassie Ann Blair removed to Bedford County in the 1790s to be closer to other relatives. There were other Williams families already living there. Perhaps some of them are actually unidentified children of Roger Sr.\n\nFuture research efforts may uncover more details about this mans family.\n\nChild:\n\n2. i. Roger, born 1749 in Cumberland County, according to his Rev. War pension application, which was rejected. Roger married Cassie Ann Blair on 22 Feb. 1775, Amherst Co., VA. He died about 21 July 1835, probably in Bedford Co., VA, with Cassie Ann surviving him.\n\nNotes\n\n1Deed from Roger Williams to Roger Williams, Deed Book 5:149, Cumberland County, Virginia.\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nRoger and Cassie Ann Blair Williams\n\nRoger2 (Roger1) was born Feb 1749, Cumberland Co. VA1; d. by July 1835, Bedford Co., VA2; m. Cassie Ann Blair on 22 Feb 1775 in Amherst Co., VA. Cassie Ann was born 1750-17603; died aft 1835, surviving Roger. Descendants have reported that Roger's death date is taken from a gravestone in a private cemetery, place not stated. However, the date does correspond with the probating of Roger's will. Roger applied for a Revolutionary War pension, but his application was rejected. Rogers sons, Sam Allen and George W., the Nances and the Hudnalls migrated to Missouri, while Susannah went to Tennessee. As far as is known, Rogers other children remained in Virginia. In 1820 Bedford, the household had 000111-000013. In Bedford Co., 1830, Roger's household was enumerated as 0000001-0000000014.\n\nChildren5:\n\ni.

Creasey, 7 Aug 1804, Bedford Co.,VA. Thomas was born c1780; died between 26 Nov-4 Dec 1843, Lafayette Co., MO.20 The Creaseys were apparently fairly well to do. Thomas's estate included 19 slaves and Elizabeth's estate was valued over $1700 in 1854. Elizabeth was in Lafayette Co. in 1850, heading a household with Larusha Creasey, 17, born in VA and Martha Williams, 20, also born in VA21. Neither were named as heirs.

Gustavus married (2) Avaline Wade, daughter of Alexander Wade, 23 Jan 1837, Bedford Co., VA. The Gustavus Burton 1840 household looked like: 11001-00011.

Mitchell, Jabez Hudnall and Claiborne (X) Creasy. Settlement was completed in 1846 for $157.73.

In 1830, the household had 3110001-011301.28 In 1840, it showed 25311101-1105301.29 There must have been farm workers or other relatives with them at that time.

(Robert William, born 8 Mar 1842, KY; died probably before 1860, Samuel Austin, born 21 Nov 1843, KY; died probably before 1850, Martha, born 5 May 1845, KY; died probably before 1850 and Nancy Matilda, born 28 Nov 1846, KY. Since Virginia, Jane and Susan were sent to stay with Hudnall relatives after Parthena died, the girls may be her only children. John next married Henrietta Mabe. She died soon after their son, John Absolum, was born on 9 Mar 1858. John last married Elizabeth Sharp, 14 Jan 1859. One son, Lewis Grigsby was born 4 Dec 1859 and another, Elizah S., was born 20 July 1863. John died of consumption 13 Sept 1863, Jefferson City, MO. Few facts have been found on this family and it appears that more research is needed. A first step would be to verify the identity of the Grundy Co. John S. Howard. It also appears that one John L.
