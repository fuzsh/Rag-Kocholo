His father, Nathan, was born in Massachusetts about the year 1779, and was a son of John and Sarah Boise. This family is of French origin, and their ancestors belonged to the noted Du Boise family, who were very prominent in France during the reign of Louis XIV, and were driven from that country to the northern part of Ireland during the Huguenot persecutions. Here the name was changed to Boies, and in about 1825 to the present mode. In the early part of the last century David, a descendent of the family, emigrated from Ireland to America and located in the town of Hopkinton, Mass., but subsequently removed to Blandford, Mass., about 1735 or 1737. But a few people, at that early period, had turned their attention toward the settlement of the backwoods of the State, as the country was mountainous and heavily timbered, and permanent settling was attended with much more danger and labor there than in the valleys. David was a man of deep religious thought and principles. He had a large family of children, of whom three were sons, viz., John, William and Samuel. John, arriving at manhood, turned his attention to agricultural pursuits. He reared a family of children, and his two sons were named John and Samuel, the former being the grandfather of the subject of our sketch. He was born in Blandford November 22, 1744, and was one of the first white male children to see the light in that town; he was celebrated as a schoolmaster, and was a prominent member of the Baptist Church; he was married to Sarah Freeland, by whom he had a family of six children, who all lived to a mature age; three of them were sons - James, Enos and Nathan. He died September 9, 1830; his son, Nathen was born in Blandford, Mass., in 1779, and there he lived until 1802, when he came to Portage County, this State, where he shortly after married Deborah, the daughter of Thompson and Mary Pegg. Nathan and wife died in Portage County in the years 1826 and 1863, leaving a family of eight children, viz., Enos, Sarah, Joel, Elijah, Alva, Mary, Lydia and Philo. Alva Boise was married, in Portage, October 18,1847, to Catherine, daughter of Joshua and Elizabeth Calvin, and until October, 1850, he remained there following his trade of wagon-making; he then came to this township and purchased and moved upon the farm he still occupies. This contains 120 acres of very fine land, and is well improved in all respects. Mr. Boise is the father of one son, Watson, who was born May 29, 1857, and was married, September 15, 1877, to Miss Rebecca Brannan; he resides on the old homestead, and superintends the cultivation of the farm. The family are all people of superior intelligence, and are among the most respectable in the township.Source: County of Williams, Ohio, Historical & Biographical - Illustrated - Publ. Weston A.

His father was a shoemaker, but occasionally worked at farming; he came to Williams County in 1853, settling on the place now owned by our subject. John Boman's early life was passed on a farm, yet he acquired a fair education. In September, 1861, he became enrolled in Company H, Third Ohio Cavalry, continuing in the military service for three years and three months, and taking part in the battles of Perrysburg, Stone River, Chickamauga, Snow Hill, Woodsonville, Bardstown and others. He was under Gen. Thomas during his Georgia campaign, and was discharged at Nashville Dec. 30, 1864, since which time he has been employed in farming. It was largely due to Mr. Boman's influence that the town of Blakeslee can trace its origin, he having donated about four and one-half acres to the Wabash & St. Louis Railroad Company, for depot and grounds; he also caused a survey and platting of the town, which was done Nov. 15, 1880. At that time the only improvements were one log house and a grocery, built for the railroad company. Since then Blakeslee ahs grown rapidly, Mr. Bowman having erected a building now used as a hardware store, as well as disposing of about twenty-nine acres of land in town lots and for depot grounds. He still has, however, a snug farm of fifty-seven acres. He is a Free and Accepted Mason.\n\nSource: County of Williams, Ohio, Historical & Biographical - Illustrated - Publ. Weston A.

BOOTHMAN, merchant, was born in Jefferson Township, Williams Co., Ohio, October 16, 1846, and is one of nine living children, of a family of ten, born to Lemuel M. and Melisendra (Hart) Boothman, who was natives of Trumbull County, Ohio, and of English descent. Lemuel Boothman was reared and educated in his native county. At the age of eighteen months he was left an orphan, and was reared by a Mr. Mitchell. The spring of 1843, he came to Williams county; purchased eighty acres of land in Jefferson Township, it, at that time, being all woods; cleared a place, sufficiently large in which to erect a log cabin, and shortly afterward married, moved upon his place and began clearing and improving it. He lived on this farm until 1873, when he sold out and moved to Bryan, where he has since resided. M. M. Boothman was reared in Williams County, assisting his parents on the farm at clearing and farming. He received a fair common-school education, and January 4, 1864, enlisted four three years, or during the war, as private in Company H, Thirty-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and was mustered into service at Toledo, a few days after his enlistment. He participated in his first battle the 7th of August, 1864, at the right of Atlanta, known as Utoy Creek, when his company lost eleven men killed and wounded. After that occurred the battle of Jonesboro, September 1, 1853, in which the company went in with thirty-three men and came out with a loss of nineteen. It was here that Mr. Boothman was one of five who lost left limbs. He was shot directly through the left knee, by a musket ball, which resulted in the amputation of that limb the next morning. The wounded went into hospital on the field, and after a few days were removed to Atlanta; remained there until October 29, and thence were removed to Atlanta; remained there until October 29, and thence where removed to Chattanooga, Tenn., Nashville, Jeffersonville, Ind., Camp Dennison, Ohio, and from there received a thirty-day furlough. He received his final discharge June 7, 1865. He began then going to school, afterward engaged in teaching, and in this way acquired a good practical education. He attended the law school at Ann arbor in October, 1869, graduating in September, 1871. He then came home, and the 20th of June of that year married Miss Angeline Bushong. That same fall, he was elected County Treasurer by the Republican party, and re-elected in 1873, serving two terms. He then began the practice of his profession, in partnership with B. E. Sheldon; subsequently (1881), with Thomas Emery. Mr. Boothman has made the practice of law a success, and he and Mr. Emery are doing a good legal business. He is a Republican in politics, and he and wife are members of the Presbyterian Church, and the parents of four children - Howard E., Grace, Dale M. and one as yet unnamed.\n\nSource: County of Williams, Ohio, Historical & Biographical - Illustrated - Publ.

Mr. Bowersox was formerly a Township Trustee, in which office he served several terms, and he has also served as Supervisor of Roads. Notwithstanding all the hardships and inconveniences of frontier life, Mr. Bowersox still speaks of the days of his first settlement here as the happiest of his existence. The forest then was full of game and many were the deer and wild turkeys that fell at the crack of his rifle, and his sport was enlivened on one occasion by the slaughter of a bear, and on another by the death of a wild cat. His parents, Christian and Mary A. (Warner) Bowersox, were natives of Maryland, and of German descent.\n\nSource: County of Williams, Ohio, Historical & Biographical - Illustrated - Publ. Weston A.

BRADLEY, a veteran of the Black Hawk war, and of the late civil war, was born Feb. 6, 1812, in Litchfield, Conn. He is one of twelve children born to Major and Chloe (Hulbert) Bradley, both natives of Connecticut. Capt Bradley, after receiving an ordinary youthful education, enlisted, at the age of nineteen, at Utica, N. Y., in Company I, Second Regiment United States Army. The company was stationed at Fort Niagara, but in May, 1832, was ordered to Fort Dearborn (Chicago). Soon Gen. Scott arrived with 300 troops. The cholera now appearing, the fort was given up to the sick, the well portion of the command camping one-half mile away, on Lake Michigan. The Black Hawk war having broken out, this command, under Col. Eustis, started in pursuit of the Indians. Gen. Scott joined them at Davenport, having captured the famous Black Hawk. When Amon Bradley's term of service expired, he had been made a Sergeant; this was in 1836. After leaving the army, Capt. Bradley was employed with his brother, Col. E. D. Bradley, at Sandusky City. In 1840, he purchased a farm in Sandusky County, Ohio, which he managed until 1850, when he removed to Brady Township, in this county, where he purchased land and engaged in agriculture until the war of the rebellion. He first helped to recruit a company for three months' service, which was mustered in as Company E, Fourteenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Capt. Bradley commanding; he returned in 1861, and in the succeeding spring, he, with Capt. P. W. Norris, recruited a company for Hoffman's Battalion, consisting of four companies, but increased to a regiment, and mustered in as the One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Capt. Bradley continuing as Captain. At the close of the war, he was discharged with the regiment and returned to Stryker. Capt. Bradley had three sons in the late war- Amon M., John and Edwin N., the first of whom died in a hospital at Pittsburg Landing, June 14, 1862. Capt. Bradley was married, in 1840, to Caroline Nichols, of Otsego County, N. Y., a daughter of Samuel and Phebe Nichols. Capt. and Mrs. B. have had seven children, five of whom are living. Capt.

BRADLEY, a veteran of the war with Mexico, as well as the late civil war, a patriot and Christian gentleman, of whom Williams County may well be proud, was born Aug. 28, 1804, at Litchfield, Conn. He is a son of Major and Chloe (Hulbert) Bradley, both natives of Connecticut. In 1638, Samuel Bradley emigrated from Reading, England, to the colony of New Haven. From him Col. Bradley is descended. Both his grandparents- Daniel Bradley and Calvin Hurlburt - were active participants in the war for independence, the first as a Quartermaster; the second served as a private under Gen. Putnam, and afterward became a prominent Baptist clergyman of Berlin, Conn. After a preliminary education, and working on his father's farm as well as at the carpenter's trade, Edwin D. Bradley entered an academy at Litchfield, where he remained two years, then entered the law office of Beers & Sandford, at Litchfield, reading law for two and one-half years, and attending lectures at the law school of Judge Gould. Owing to failing health he was soon compelled to abandon his studies. In 1835, he came to Sandusky City, Ohio, where he engaged in agriculture until the Mexican war began, when he commenced recruiting a company for service; six days later he marched said company to its rendezvous at Camp Washington, where it was organized as Company F, with Col. Bradley as Captain, and assigned to the First Ohio Volunteer Infantry; this company he commanded until the regiment was mustered out of service at New Orleans, June, 1847. On his return from Mexico he came to Williams County, Ohio, where he engaged in mercantile business at Lockport, Evansport and Stryker, for about ten years, coming to Stryker in 1856, where he has since remained. On the occurrence of the rebellion, Col. Bradley was among the first to respond, and at once recruited a company for three months, which was assigned to the Fourteenth Ohio Regiment, of which Col. Bradley was Adjutant; but before the expiration of this service, he was commissioned Colonel, with authority to recruit a three years' regiment in Northern Ohio. In three weeks 968 men were enrolled, constituting the Thirty-Eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry (known as the Williams County Regiment). Advancing age and failing health compelled his resignation in February, 1862. He has been three times married, his last wife being Miss Kate Russell, of Vermont. In politics, he was a Democrat until the last war, when he became a stanch Republican. He has served as Justice of the Peace, and, though not aspiring to civil honors, ahs been a candidate for the Legislature, and for Auditor and Sheriff of his county. When eighteen years of age he joined the Congregational Church, of which Dr. Lyman Beecher was pastor, but, on finding no Congregational Society in the West, he affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church, of which he has been a leading communicant. The Bradleys are a decidedly military family, having been active workers in every war, from colonial times down to the last call to arms. During the latter, Col. Bradley and all his sons were engaged - the youngest, but fourteen years old, as a musician.\n\nLIEUT. JAMES H. BRADLEY, Seventh Regiment United States Army, the brave young officer killed at the battle of Big Hole, Montana, was a son of Col. Bradley and the only representative of Williams County in the regular army. He was born in Sandusky County, Ohio, May 25, 1844. When three years old, his parents removed to Evansport, on the line between Williams and Defiance Counties, where his mother died in 1855. In 156, he came to Stryker, where he received his early education. When the rebellion broke out, all though but sixteen years of age, his inherited spirit of patriotism carried him into his father's regiment; he was refused enrolment, but afterward, at the recommendation of Col. Steedman, Gov. Dennison ordered that he be enrolled and paid. After the three months' term, he entered Oberlin College to complete his education, but his martial longing again prevailed, and he enlisted in the Forty-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, serving until the close of the war, reaching the grade of a SErgeant. In 1865 he returned home, but a year later, he was appointed First Lieutenant in Company B, Seventh Regiment Infantry United States Army; he was for a time stationed at Atlanta, where he was married, in 1871, to a daughter of Dr. Beech. In 1876, he commanded Gibbons' Mounted Infantry, being the first to reach the Custer battle-ground and rescue Gen. Reno's command; he also accompanied Col. Gibbons against the Nez Perces, surprising the savages, but in the engagement which followed, he was slain. The news was borne to his bereaved wife and family, and to his father, who was almost crushed, having the fondest hopes of his heroic son. Although not possessing a West Point education, he was an accomplished officer, a fluent and elegant writer, and well versed in the ancient and modern languages. At the time of his death, he was preparing works on the Sioux war, and Chester Massacre, and a history of the Northwest. After the battle, Hon. P. W. Norris visited the scene, purposing to return his remains to his native town, but they could not be identified. Upon a board over his supposed grave was inscribed his name, rank and date of death.\n\nSource: County of Williams, Ohio, Historical & Biographical - Illustrated - Publ. Weston A.
