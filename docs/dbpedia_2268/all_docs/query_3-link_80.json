        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky.—Transylvania bestowed its top awards to distinguished alumni and friends during its recent alumni weekend awards luncheon.\n\nCarol Ann Goff Tanner ‘64, received the Irvin E. Lunger Award, which is presented for unique and exceptional service to Transylvania; John N. Williams Jr. ‘74 and Lucy S. Williams ‘74, both received the Morrison Medallion, which is presented to graduates for outstanding service to Transylvania and its programs; Mamata G. Majmundar ‘95, received the Outstanding Young Alumni Award for extraordinary involvement at Transylvania; and William R. Stamler received the Transylvania Medal for outstanding service to the university.\n\nCarol Ann Goff Tanner ’64\n\nElected to Transylvania’s Board of Trustees in 2004, Tanner has been unrelenting in her service and support for her alma mater since she was elected to the alumni executive board in 1968. She has since served on the Board of Visitors and the steering committee of the $9.2 million Brown Science Center renovation. Transylvania recognized Tanner with the Certificate of Appreciation in 1999 and the Distinguished Service Award in 2004.\n\nA former high school mathematics teacher and tour guide at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, Tanner lives in the Charlottesville, Va., with her husband Robert, where she volunteers for a variety of church, civic, philanthropic and school-related activities. As a student, Tanner was president of Chi Omega and Panhellenic Council. She was a member of Lampas leadership honorary, the Holleian Society, the Transylvania Choir and the women’s basketball team.\n\nJohn and Lucy Williams ’74\n\nLongtime alumni volunteers John and Lucy Williams were the driving force behind establishing Transylvania’s Louisville alumni chapter in 1992. While John served as the chapter’s first president, Lucy, a member of the Transylvania Women’s Club, embarked on a three-year term on the Alumni Executive Board. John served on the Kresge Science Initiative Committee. He also established the Williams-Hardy Scholarship Fund in honor of his mother, Sarah Hardy Williams ’47 and his uncle, Williams P. Hardy ’39. The Williamses received the Distinguished Service Award in 1999 in recognition of their many hours of service to their alma mater. John, who completed a five-year term on the Board of Visitors in 2005, was elected to the board of trustees in 2007.\n\nJohn is dean of the University of North Carolina School of Dentistry, one of the top ranked research intensive dental schools in the United States. From 1999-2005, he was dean of the University of Louisville School of Dentistry. He also served seven years as associate dean of educational programs at Louisville and three years in a concurrent position as assistant university provost.\n\nAfter 15 years as a classroom teacher, Lucy began working as a project coordinator for the Carolina Teachers Convention at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Education. She served on the board of directors of the Christian Church Homes of Kentucky from 1997-2005 and the Thomas Jefferson Pre-School board from 1988-91.\n\nMamata G. Majmundar ’95\n\nMajmundar is a board-certified physician in family practice at the Lexington Clinic Andover. She previously worked in urgent care at First Choice Walk-in Clinic and earned partner status in 2004. In addition to taking care of patients, Majmundar also provides leadership experience on the clinic’s finance, marketing and benefits committees. She graduated with a degree in biology from Transylvania and earned an MD from the University of Louisville in 2000. She completed her residency and internship at the University of Kentucky, where she assisted in supervising and teaching resident physicians as a volunteer faculty member. Majmundar served as a consultant to Transylvania on its selection of a physician to provide health services to students, and she volunteers for the annual Transylvania health fair and alumni events.\n\nWilliam R. Stamler\n\nStamler and his wife, Ellen Boyd Stamler, have provided extraordinary support for Transylvania, dating from their daughter, Rose Mary Stamler Dow’s attendance in the 1980s when they served on the parents council. CEO of Stamler Corporation in Millersburg and chairman of Signal Investments in Lexington, Stamler has contributed generously to construction and renovation projects at Transylvania. When completed in 2010, the second floor of the building will bear Ellen Stamler’s name in recognition for her passion for teaching, demonstrated by 28 years of service to students in secondary schools in Kentucky and Tennessee. Stamler also established the Hodges Endowed Scholarship, named for his mother, Mary Buford Hodges Stamler, a Hamilton College (female college connected to Transylvania) graduate, class of 1923."
