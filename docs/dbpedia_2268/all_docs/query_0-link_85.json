        "text": "In nineteenth-century America, men often defended their reputation, honor, or masculinity when questioned or challenged by others, sometimes violently. Historian Richard Bushman stated that “any personal hurt, any damage to reputation called for an immediate response. Vengeance was to be sought for a hurt, and no insult was to go unchallenged.” Men might defend their honor or sort out their differences through various physical confrontations, including verbal debate, fistfights, or even armed duels. (Bushman, “Character of Joseph Smith,” 27; see also Wyatt-Brown, Honor and Violence in the Old South; and Gorn, “Social Significance of Fighting in the Southern Backcountry,” 18–43.)\n\nBushman, Richard Lyman. “The Character of Joseph Smith.” BYU Studies 42, no. 2 (2003): 23–34.\n\nWyatt-Brown, Bertram.

A license demonstrated that the bearer had been granted the authority for a particular calling or office. Though William sent his license to JS, there is no extant evidence to suggest that JS accepted William’s resignation from the Quorum of the Twelve. In the letter featured here, William proposed “withdrawing from the office of the apostleship . . . and remaining a member in the church.” JS later responded that this idea was a “stratigem of the evil one” and counseled William that by “maintaining your apostleship in rising up, and making one tremendous effort, you may overcome your passions, and please God.” (Historical Introduction to License for Frederick G. Williams, 20 Mar. 1833; Letter to William Smith, ca. 18 Dec. 1835.)\n\nNearly fifty years later, former Kirtland justice of the peace John Dowen remembered that “Jo, his brother Bil, and others had a fight. . . . They were raising the devil all the time.” Church member Daniel Tyler was likely referring to this period of animosity when he later recalled a time when “William Smith and others rebelled against the Prophet.” At a meeting held in the Kirtland schoolhouse, Tyler remembered, a solemn JS offered a sincere and humble prayer “in behalf of those who accused him of having gone astray and fallen into sin.” JS then told those in attendance that these men would receive a testimony “this night that I am clear and stand approved before the Lord.” Tyler added, “The next Sabbath his brother William and several others made humble confessions before the public.” (John C. Dowen, Statement, 2 Jan. 1885, Collection of Manuscripts about Mormons, 1832–1954, Chicago History Museum; Tyler, “Recollections of the Prophet,” 127–128, italics in original.)\n\nManuscripts about Mormons at Chicago History Museum, Research Center, ca. 1832–1954.
