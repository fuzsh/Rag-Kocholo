His incredible skills were recognized and celebrated as he was proudly inducted into the prestigious Bismarck/Mandan Bowling Hall of Fame. William's love for the sport brought him great joy and countless cherished memories with friends and fellow bowlers. Bill enjoyed his friends and looked forward to his outings at Kroll's Restaurant and Jack's Steakhouse.\n\nHe leaves behind his beloved wife Esther; brothers Lester (Barb) Williams and Francis (Cathy) Williams; sister Patricia Bouchee, brothers-in-law, Joseph Doll and Ed Doll (Lutene Roth); sister-in-law, Donna Doll, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, brothers-in-law, Michael Doll and Henry Bouchee.\n\nIn this time of mourning, let us come together to support and comfort Esther and her family. May we find strength in each other and celebrate the memories that William has left behind.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please send contributions to the Bismarck/Mandan Junior Bowling League.\n\nRest in peace, dear William. You will always be remembered and forever missed."
