        "text": "Mary Williams (Moore) is William Williams' first cousin once removed.\n\nFamily\n\nGeorge Moore (1632-1713/14) married Jane Barcroft. Their children were:\n\nFrom “MOORE-(WILLIAMS) EXCERPT”< link >\n\nd.​ Mary Moore (ca. 1670-after 1712) married William Williams (ca. 1670-1712). See the Williams Section, # 1, c. He inherited 200 acres in 1691/92 adjacent Thomas Mandue from his father John Williams—John’s share of 400 acres purchased by him and his brother Thomas Williams from George Pierce in 1681. The location of the property that William Williams inherited was between the Corrowaugh Swamp and Kingsale Swamp, branches of the Main Blackwater some ten miles south of the Lawne’s Creek community. Further clarifying the location are the patents of Henry Applewhaite and John Williams (30 May 1678); John Moore, # 2 (23 April 1681, adjacent George Pierce and Philip Raiford); Bridgman Joyner and William Mayo (16 April 1683, adjacent Kingsale, the main Blackwater, Hodges Council, Thomas Mann, George Pierce, Henry Applewhaite, John Williams, and Thomas Underwood); John Browne, brother-in-law of William Williams and purported cousin of both Williams’ wife and Dr. Samuel Browne (29 April 1692, south side of Kingsale. See Nugent, Vol. 2, pp. 184, 187, 205, 216, 254, 374; Vol. 3, pp. 4-5. William Williams soon added to his land by becoming one of the early patentees in the Nottoway Basin, west of the Main Blackwater. On 28 October 1702, he patented there 600 acres; other patentees on the same day were James Bryan, Thomas Joyner (whose daughter married Thomas Williams, brother of William Williams), and Thomas Mandue. On 24 April 1703, Williams added 400 acres (ibid., 69). The given name of George’s Moore’s daughter, not mentioned in his will, is clarified in a series of six conveyances between October 1702 and April 1704, three of which were to William Williams’ brothers John, Nicholas, and Richard. See Isle of Wight Deed Book # 1, pp. 412-17. See the Williams Section, # 1, a, c, I, and j.\n\nWilliam Williams made his will in Albemarle County, North Carolina on 9 December 1711; proved 15 April 1712. His wife Mary was executrix. The legatees were their sons Samuel, John, and Stephen, and “each of my daughters.” See Grimes, Abstracts of North Carolina Wills, p. 413; cf. Hathaway, Vol. 1, p. 84, who was mistaken about the date “1704” but included “each of my daughters” whom Grimes did not mention. One of the witnesses was his uncle Lewis Williams. Two of the sons, Samuel and John, were named in the will of their grandfather, George Moore. Lewis Williams made one of his legatees in his will of 1716/17 John Williams, son of William Williams “deceased.”\n\nIssue, except for the daughters who have not been identified:\n\n(1)​John Williams (ca. 1695/1700-1737) married Ann, maiden name unknown. He was the John Williams mentioned as the “son of William Williams, deceased” in the aforementioned will (1716/17) of Lewis Williams. John Williams appears in three important Isle of Wight deeds: (a) John Williams “of Albemarle County in North Carolina” deeded to Ralph Vickers of Isle of Wight 200 acres adjacent land formerly belonging to William Williams—part of the 400 acres “sold to John Williams [grandfather] and Thomas Williams [great-uncle] on 10 October 1682 (Great Book, Vol. II, p. 182). (b) John Williams and his brother Stephen Williams “of Albemarle County, North Carolina” sold to their uncle Richard Williams of Isle of Wight 170 acres adjacent his property in the Nottoway Basin—part of a patent for 600 acres granted to William Williams on 28 October 1702 (ibid., p. 275). (c) On 21 October 1725, John Williams of North Carolina deeded to his uncle Nicholas Williams of Isle of Wight 125 acres at Nottoway Swamp—part of a patent of William Williams on 21 April 1703 (ibid., p. 715). The will of John Williams was received by the court of Edgecombe County, North Carolina in August 1737. He named his wife Ann executrix and left legacies to sons John Williams and Joshua Williams and daughter Mary Williams. See Grimes Abstracts of North Carolina Wills, p. 410.\n\n(2)​Stephen Williams (ca. 1695/1700- ? ) remains something of an enigma. He deeded the property he inherited from his father to William Byrd on 17 July 1720 for 45 pds., as witnessed by his brothers Samuel and John (Chowan Deed Book F # 1, p. 62). No will or estate papers for him have surfaced.\n\n(3)​Captain Samuel Williams (ca. 1700-1754) married Elizabeth Alston (ca. 1712-after 1767). She married (2) Richard Burt (1724-1805), as proved by a court reference of July 1765 to their marriage agreement and by her deed of gift in December 1767 to her sons William, Solomon, and Joseph John Williams (Halifax Deed Book # 9, p. 312; # 10, p. 123).\n\nOrigins\n\n2nd John Williams, deceased 1691/92, also wife named Anne, and children John, William, Thomas, Nicholas, Richard, Theopolis, Mary and Jane."
