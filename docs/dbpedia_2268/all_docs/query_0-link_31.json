        "text": "Williams-Smith\n\nMaria Elexine Welburn was born February 1852 in the farming community of Blackwater. She was Mary & George's 6th daughter to survive to adulthood. Maria is presumed to a twin of her newly discovered sibling Anna. Because the entire neighborhood of freed and freeborn persons was skipped during the 1860 Federal Census, Maria never appeared in the Federal Census with her parents and siblings.\n\nThe 1870 Census showed that Maria was married to Charles Williams, had one daughter, was living on her parents' farm, but in a separate house. She was difficult to locate initially because she used her middle name - \"Elexzine\" (see image below). Like several of our uncles, Charles left the area after harvest season to work on the water. He was employed as a long shoreman at the port of Philadelphia when he contracted a \"congestion of [the] lungs\". He died November 24, 1876 and was buried in Lebanon Cemetery four days later (see image below). Charles Williams was 38 years of age.\n\nTheir four daughters were left in the care of various Welburn aunts and uncles while Maria followed the example of her widowed sister-in-law Hetty. Maria went north to Philadelphia to find work as a domestic. She also found a new husband, Maryland native William Henry Smith. They were married on July 8, 1880. At the time of their marriage, William resided in Chester County, but they moved to Radnor, and then eventually resided at 35 W. Spring Avenue in Ardmore, PA. Her daughters Tacy, Hulda, Lucy, and Mary Jane eventually relocated to Pennsylvania.\n\nMaria's connection to the family was confirmed through the 1915 deposition that she gave as evidence for the Civil War veteran widow's pension case of her older sister Nancy Jane Oliver. Her deposition also informed us that her father George Welburn \"... had 11 girls and he saw to it that all of them who lived to be grown, ten, got married.\" Until 2007, the identities of 8 married daughters and their descendants were known. This additional knowledge encouraged the search for the other 2 married daughters, Hannah and the newly discovered sister Anna who was born and married during the 20-year Census gap.\n\nMaria Elexine Welburn-Williams-Smith died February 27, 1920. Her husband William Henry Smith died November 18, 1925. Both are buried in Eden Cemetery.\n\n(C) 2007 - 2024 Kimberly Chase-Longus\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nAn Outline of Maria's Descendants\n\nA GUIDE TO THE OUTLINE:\n\nBLACK=CHILD OF MARIA & CHARLES; RED=GRANDCHILD OF MARIA & CHARLES; PURPLE=GREAT-GRANDCHILD; MINT=2XGREAT-GRANDCHILD; ORANGE=3XGREAT-GRANDCHILD; BLUE=4XGREAT-GRANDCHILD; YELLOW=5XGREAT-GRANDCHILD; GREEN=6XGREAT-GRANDCHILD;\n\nADD ANOTHER \"GREAT\" TO KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP TO MARY & GEORGE WELBURN.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nii.
