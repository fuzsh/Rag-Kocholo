        "text": "WILLIAM “BILL” NELSON WILLIAMS III age 75 of Brunswick, OH entered into eternal rest Friday March 15, 2024 surrounded by family at the Louis Stokes VA Hospital in Cleveland.\n\nBill debuted on the world stage December 6th, 1948 in Bay Village, OH to late directors Dorothy and Bill Williams Jr where he promptly stole the show. His charisma and knowledge led him through an accomplished life on and off stage.\n\nBill attended John Adams High, John F Kennedy High and Garfield Heights High School, where he was part of the graduating class of 1967. After high school he met and married the love of his life and costume designer Cathy. Bill chose to serve his country in the United States Army as a member of the 14th Engineer Brigade during Vietnam and continued serving by helping veterans later in life.\n\nAs a recipient of an award for craftsmanship by the Builder’s Exchange, one of his proudest accomplishments, Bill could build just about anything. He spent years of his career as a cabinet and countertop maker and when asked what he made at work, he’d smile and tell his daughters “sawdust.” Bill ended his carpentry career as a business agent for the union, looking out for other carpenters.\n\nBill is survived by his loving wife of 54 years Cathy, and three daughters, Sarah Bedilion (Bill), Katy Clark (Todd) and Liz Piltz (David); his grandchildren Rebecca, Kyle, Victoria, Eden, Lucy, Stephani (Ted), Tyler (Nicole), Alyssa (Garren) and 7 great grandchildren. He is also survived by his brothers Keith (Linda), Al (Marylynn) and sister Sue Eaton (Kim, deceased). Bill was predeceased by his son Billy; brother Donald, and parents Bill and Dorothy.\n\nHis family likes to joke that Bill was a professional club joiner. More recently he was a member of the Medina DAV, where he enjoyed volunteering and spending time with the many good friends he made there. The American Legion, VFW, Theodore Breck Lodge, Al Koran Scimitars, Society of American Magicians, International Brotherhood of Magicians and the Carpenters Union (48 years) were some of the organizations he belonged to.\n\nBill amazed many for 25 years doing magic at events, birthday parties, corporate parties and fundraising benefits. His curly blue hair and big red smile kept many laughing while he clowned around as Clancy. He shared his love of magic with many as well as the young magicians he led in the Society of Young Magicians in Maple Heights.\n\nBill was presented with an award from the mayor of Brunswick, OH and a certificate from the state house for being a hero. He showed extreme strength by lifting a car off of his neighbor. A feat that put him in the National Enquirer and on the radio and tv.\n\nGenealogy was a passion of Bill’s. He traced his family back through time and loved telling everyone about it. He contributed vast information to ancestry.com and prided himself on the family tree that he put together which found relatives that had been separated. He spent untold hours creating a family history book to pass down to future generations.\n\nBill loved his family more than anything. Being with family and staying in touch with family were very important to him. Some of the proudest moments of his life include marrying his wife, becoming a father to all of his children and holding his grandbabies. He loved nothing more than making his family laugh, and make them laugh he did. He loved with every fiber in his being and was loved by many.\n\nFriends and family may call at THE FERFOLIA FUNERAL HOME, 356 W. AURORA RD. (OH RTE 82), SAGAMORE HILLS FOR VISITATION FRIDAY MARCH 22, 2-4 PM AND 6-8 PM. Funeral Saturday March 23, 10 AM at the funeral home. To allow all who loved Bill to grieve together, a live stream of his funeral service will be available at https://webcast.funeralvue.com/events/viewer/99171. Interment Crown Hill Cemetery with Military Honors.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions are suggested to the Medina DAV #72, Medina County Veterans Memorial Hall 620 Broadway Medina OH 44258."
