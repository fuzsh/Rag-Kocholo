        "text": "Descendants of Thomas Williams\n\n[s\n\n[Click on the red arrow for a shortcut to the list of family trees\n\nsClick on the blue question mark for assistance in navigating among family trees\n\nThomas WILLIAMS was born about 1780. It is believed that Thomas Williams came from Maryland to Greene County, PA, at an unknown date, then in 1838 arrived in Tyler County, WV. There is a Thomas Williams in Greene County, PA in the 1820 census. Thomas was not located in the 1830 census in either Pennsylvania or (West) Virginia. He does appear in the 1840 census living near Jacob and a Joseph Williams, who was possibly another son.\n\nThe \"History of the First Baptist Church of Sistersville\" notes in June 1838, Thomas Williams and Serena, his wife, were presented as members in good standing at the Long Reach Baptist Church. A history of Jacob Williams' family in the Tyler County, WV history refers to Serena as a stepmother.\n\nNo death record for Thomas or Serena has been located. They have not been found in the 1850 census.\n\nAnother possible child: There is also an Elizabeth Williams Scarbrough who is living next to Susanna and Levi in the 1870 census of Monroe County. Was she connected to this Williams family? Her birth year of 1835 would not seem to fit this family unless Thomas married a second time.\n\nThomas WILLIAMS was married to Serena (possibly Roberts). She may have been a second wife. Thomas had the following children:\n\nI. Levi WILLIAMS was born on March 7, 1811. He died on February 12, 1879. Levi Williams died 12 Feb 1879 aged 67, born Greene County PA. His will named widow Lucinda, sons Jacob and Martin L., daughters Melissa Knowlton, Cyrene Devore, Mary Devore, Serepta Williams and Emily Williams.\n\nLevi appears in Monroe County in 1860 and 1870. He married in Tyler County, WV in 1841 to Lucinda Cooper. Jacob Williams married Susan Cooper in Tyler County in 1840. I feel fairly certain these were brothers of Susanna Williams. In 1840 Tyler County census, Jacob Williams is living next to Joseph and Thomas Williams. Thomas is the oldest of the three and has a son in the household who would be the right age to be Levi. There was also a Thomas Williams in 1820 in Greene County PA who had children who would have fit the ages of Susanna and Levi.\n\nLevi WILLIAMS was married to Lucinda Cooper on September 1, 1841 in Tyler County, West Virginia.
