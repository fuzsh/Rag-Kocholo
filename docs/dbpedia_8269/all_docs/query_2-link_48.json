        "text": "A Greater Beauty: The Drawings of Kahlil Gibran features over one hundred drawings by the proliﬁc Lebanese-American artist, poet and essayist, and coincides with the 100th anniversary of Gibran’s world-renowned publication The Prophet. Though best known for his poetry and prose, Gibran viewed himself equally as a visual artist, producing paintings, watercolors, sketches, illustrations, book covers, and other material as a complement to his written work. Published on the occasion of the exhibition A Greater Beauty presents an overview of Gibran’s drawings and sketches alongside manuscript pages, notebooks, correspondence, magazine illustrations and essays, and ﬁrst editions, providing a glimpse into the artist’s production in the context of his work as a whole."
