        "text": "Welcome to our digital exhibit celebrating Arab American Heritage Month. This page is a companion to the physical display in the HKS Library, available through April 2024. Harvard affiliates can request books via HOLLIS, for pick-up at the library of your choice.\n\nLaunched in 2017 by Arab America and the Arab America Foundation, National Arab American Heritage Month has taken place in the U.S. every April to formally recognize the achievements of Arab Americans and \"celebrate our community's rich heritage and numerous contributions to society.\" In 2022, President Biden recognized National Arab American Heritage Month, joining Congress, the U.S. Department of State, 45 governors, and 140 counties, municipalities, and local school districts in commemorating the initiative.\n\nThe Arab America Foundation traces its roots to Kahlil Gibran, the celebrated Lebanese-American writer, poet, and philosopher who a century ago helped to create al-Rabita al-Qalamiyya (also known as Al Mahjar or The Pen League). According to the Arab American National Museum, this collective of writers and scholars who had emigrated to America from Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine \"encouraged the revitalization of Arab literature\" through individual works and contributions to each other's periodical publications. Many consider the Mahjari writers to be successors of the Nahda movement (also known as the Arab Renaissance) - a period of cultural flourishing during the late-19th and early 20th century spurred by Ottoman Empire reform, the Young Turk Revolution, and encounters with the West. al-Rabita al-Qalamiyya dissolved following Gibran's death in 1931, but its goal of promoting and preserving Arab heritage through cultural production and education lives on.\n\nThe books in this display pay homage to this Arab American literary tradition, featuring works by Mahjari and contemporary Arab American writers and scholars.\n\nThe Baker Library at HBS has also curated resources for Arab American Heritage Month, including books, databases, interviews, art, and special collections."
