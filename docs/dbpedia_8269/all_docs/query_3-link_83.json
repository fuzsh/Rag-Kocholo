        "text": "Hi @beatnique,\n\nIt looks like you've selected the Pen Tool correctly in Illustrator 2024. There isn't a separate \"regular\" or \"fancy\" Pen Tool in Illustrator; there's only one Pen Tool, which you've selected in the screenshot.\n\nCould you please describe in more detail what issue you're encountering with the Pen Tool? Are you experiencing difficulty with drawing lines, creating anchor points, or something else? Providing more information will help us understand the problem better and assist you more effectively. A small video demonstrating the issue would be really helpful.\n\nLooking forward to your response so we can resolve this frustration for you!\n\nBest regards,\n\nAnshul Saini\n\nThat tool behavior between the Pen Tool and Pencil Tool has been unchanged for as long as I can remember (I'm an older guy who has been using Illustrator since the 1990's). Some third party plugins can enhance the tool set or change the behavior of certain tools. Astute Graphics has an Inkscribe Tool that's like \"a Pen Tool on steroids,\" but I still like using the regular Pen Tool most of the time."
