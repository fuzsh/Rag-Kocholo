        "text": "One of the most popular and profound inspirational writers of all time shares simple wisdom for living a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis book is a collection of Gibran's words on how to live. Here are his thoughts on what it means to live in community and solitude and what gives life meaning, along with his often prescient views on government, organized religion, wealth, and commerce. Gibran's sensibility feels contemporary. He did not recognize any ultimate authority outside of the human soul:\n\n\"It were wiser to speak less of God, whom we cannot understand and more of each other, whom we may understand.\"\n\nThis is the essential Gibran, with 88 selections organized into 5 sections that elucidate answers to the questions that each of us face:\n\nLiving a Wise Life\n\nCommunity Wisdom\n\nWise Exchange\n\nWisdom from Solitude\n\nWisdom Beyond Words\n\nThis inspirational gift volume gently guides readers through lifeâ€™s big issues: meaning and mortality, good and evil, and discovering an authentic spiritual path. Suitable for all gift-giving occasions, it is a book that delights, informs, and inspires."
