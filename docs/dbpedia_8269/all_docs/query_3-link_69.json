        "text": "Post by barnestormer on\n\nNot long ago, I purchased PEN AND PAPER FOOTBALL while browsing through the Drive Thru RPG website, where I've been getting a lot of Cynthia Celeste Miller's games whenever they go on sale. (She didn't create this game, however. It was created by John M. Stater.) In order to test it out, I've created a fantasy football league known as the AMERICAN SUMMER FOOTBALL LEAGUE, and have been posting the results to a couple of sports groups on Facebook. There are 6 teams in the inaugural 2018 ASFL season. They are:\n\nEast Division\n\nTEAM\n\nOFFENSE\n\nDEFENSE\n\nColumbus Cardinals\n\n8\n\n11\n\nPhiladelphia Liberty\n\n9\n\n7\n\nCharlotte Horsemen\n\n11\n\n11\n\nWest Division\n\nTEAM\n\nOFFENSE\n\nDEFENSE\n\nArizona Cactus\n\n6\n\n9\n\nLA Red Carpets\n\n12\n\n12\n\nDenver Boulders\n\n10\n\n7\n\nThe regular season runs 16 weeks, with the final week being the Landry Bowl, where the top team from both divisions vie for the Landry Cup (Both the Landry Bowl and the Landry Cup were named after the late legendary Dallas Cowboys head coach Tom Landry.) I usually post results on the Facebook groups at least once per day, so to catch you up on where the league stand right now, here are the links to all of the games that have currently been played, utilizing the League Play (quick play) rules (League Play just covers the final scores of games played. Head to Head play (which I've still yet to master because I want to use HTH play to record the Landry Bowl) deals with play by play results.):\n\nASFL - Week 1 (This one's a .txt file, but all future posts are Microsoft Office spreadsheets printed out on a .pdf file)\n\nASFL - Week 2\n\nASFL - Week 3\n\nASFL - Week 4\n\nASFL - Week 5\n\nASFL - Week 6\n\nTomorrow I'll post the results for Week 7.\n\nPost by barnestormer on\n\nWe're now at the half-way point in the inaugural ASFL 2018 season. In order for me to have more time to master the Head to Head play version of the game, which I'll be using to simulate the results of the inaugural Landry Bowl, I've already simulated and recorded PDFs of the rest of the season. I'm already about half-way through the first quarter of the Landry Bowl between...Oops! I nearly spoiled the surprise. (Yeah, right! Like I'm actually going to tell you this soon who made it to the Landry Bowl. However, just for fun, you can go ahead and guess which two teams are going to make it and who's going to take home the 2018 Landry Cup.)\n\nASFL - Week 8\n\nPost by barnestormer on\n\nASFL - Week 9\n\nASFL - Week 10\n\nASFL - Week 11\n\nToday, it's a 3 for 1 special on ASFL 2018 season results because, for some reason or another (probably I hit a wrong key at some point), the post that I made that originally had the results for Weeks 9 and 10 didn't make it onto the board, so I'm correcting that mistake."
