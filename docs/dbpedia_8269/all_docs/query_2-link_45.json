        "text": "One night a feast was held in the palace, and there came a man and\n\nprostrated himself before the prince, and all the feasters looked\n\nupon him; and they saw that one of his eyes was out and that\n\nthe empty socket bled. And the prince inquired of him, “What has\n\nbefallen you?” And the man replied, “O prince, I am by profession\n\na thief, and this night, because there was no moon, I went to rob\n\nthe money-changer’s shop, and as I climbed in through the window\n\nI made a mistake and entered the weaver’s shop, and in the dark I\n\nran into the weaver’s loom and my eye was plucked out. And now,\n\nO prince, I ask for justice upon the weaver.”\n\nThen the prince sent for the weaver and he came, and it was decreed\n\nthat one of his eyes should be plucked out.\n\n“O prince,” said the weaver, “the decree is just. It is right that\n\none of my eyes be taken. And yet, alas! both are necessary to me\n\nin order that I may see the two sides of the cloth that I weave.\n\nBut I have a neighbour, a cobbler, who has also two eyes, and in\n\nhis trade both eyes are not necessary.”\n\nThen the prince sent for the cobbler. And he came. And they took\n\nout one of the cobbler’s two eyes.\n\nAnd justice was satisfied."
