        "text": "Read by Shane Morris\n\nKahlil Gibran was the key figure in a Romantic movement that transformed Arabic literature in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nFull Poem:\n\nDefeat, my Defeat, my solitude and my aloofness;\n\nYou are dearer to me than a thousand triumphs,\n\nAnd sweeter to my heart than all world-glory.\n\nDefeat, my Defeat, my self-knowledge and my defiance,\n\nThrough you I know that I am yet young and swift of foot\n\nAnd not to be trapped by withering laurels.\n\nAnd in you I have found aloneness\n\nAnd the joy of being shunned and scorned.\n\nDefeat, my Defeat, my shining sword and shield,\n\nIn your eyes I have read\n\nThat to be enthroned is to be enslaved,\n\nAnd to be understood is to be leveled down,\n\nAnd to be grasped is but to reach oneâ€™s fullness\n\nAnd like a ripe fruit to fall and be consumed.\n\nDefeat, my Defeat, my bold companion,\n\nYou shall hear my songs and my cries and my silences,\n\nAnd none but you shall speak to me of the beating of wings,\n\nAnd urging of seas,\n\nAnd of mountains that burn in the night,\n\nAnd you alone shall climb my steep and rocky soul.\n\nDefeat, my Defeat, my deathless courage,\n\nYou and I shall laugh together with the storm,\n\nAnd together we shall dig graves for all that die in us,\n\nAnd we shall stand in the sun with a will,\n\nAnd we shall be dangerous."
