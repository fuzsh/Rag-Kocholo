        "text": "In a recent discussion within the robust player-base of ‘League of Legends’, enthusiasts were engaged in a discussion on a seemingly simple, yet deeply strategic question: Is the value of armor/magic penetration (pen) on carries overestimated? This question was raised by a player who believes that he tends to buy armor pen, or magic pen, earlier than his counterparts. This raises an important question – Is this a smart strategy or a flawed approach?\n\nSummary\n\nThe player notes that the way armor works, it reduces damage, making higher armors a valuable asset for survival especially when facing tank-like opponents such as K’santa and Tahm.\n\nHe emphasizes that an ADC (Attack Damage Carry) can effectively damage tanky champions. However, this process can be slow without armor pen or inherent anti-tank abilities.\n\nFinally, he questions the logic of others building armor pen as the 5th or 6th item assuming their supports can handle the assassins.\n\nDiverse Opinions\n\nThe thread attracted a diverse range of opinions, which provides a wealth of knowledge and strategy insights for the ‘League of Legends’ community. One user mentioned that ‘Armour / magic pen is notoriously undervalued by the average player.’ This he claimed, was contrary to pro play, where it was often bought much earlier.\n\nAnother shared their personal approach and admitted to varying their strategy based on the specific enemy and the requirement of their roles within the game. They preferred delaying building armor pen until the later stages of the game, particularly if their responsibilities were more linked to survival.\n\nContrasting Experiences\n\nThere were also those who attested to the perceived efficacy of an early pen purchase, whereas others emphasized the opposite. Certain players mentioned the oversight of how much armor characters naturally gain per level. This was substantiated by another experienced player who believed in buying pen earlier, although they did admit that this does not necessarily lead to an immediate power spike.\n\nA contrary argument was presented, stressing the significance of item scaling. It was argued that unless the player was using a caster champ like MF, a premature pen does not sufficiently impact due to the lack of built-up base damage.\n\nConcluding Insights\n\nWhen it comes to the ideal time to acquire pen items in ‘League of Legends’, it is evident that the diverse perspectives are a testament to the dynamic, multifaceted nature of this fan-favorite game. Whether it’s an early or late acquisition, the choice seems to be largely dependent on a variety of factors. These include the type of opponent faced, the player’s chosen champion, and their strategic orientation within the battlefield of ‘League of Legends’."
