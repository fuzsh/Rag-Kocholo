        "text": "I would only run them on champions that use auto attacks as part of their combos naturally (such as akali or kayle and potentially someone like ziggs), as they can take advantage of the benefits of armor penetration throughout the game and is not being used as an early game lane winner.\n\nDual pen runes on ranged AP mids had a spike of popularity due to the ease of harassing melee mid champions (which were and still are popular) with long range auto-attacks, so it was lucrative and useful to have this extra armor penetration to win your lane with. However, now that Doran's shield is so popular, I feel that if the enemy melee mid laner (such as zed, katarina etc) makes this item, it makes harassing them with auto attacks almost not worth the effort due to the constantly reduced damage and consideration how the enemy creeps will react (attacking your champion, which causes the wave to push to their tower and you potentially take damage/get ganked).\n\nFor this reason, I would stick with the full magic pen runes rather than hybrid pen in your typical mid laning situation. Ideally, you would want 2 pages (one with full and one with hybrid) and decide at champion select if you think it's a possibly advantageous matchup.\n\nIt varies by play-style,\n\nAlex Ich runs most of his APC with hybrid penetration,\n\nFaker runs most of his APC with pure penetration,\n\nNote that early points in penetration counts the most.\n\nExample, if 5 mpen is worth 10x gold, than 10 mpen is worth about 18x gold, not 20x.\n\nSo getting 5 mpen and 5arpen is worth more than pure penetration so if you have the runes you should always use them when appropriate.\n\nWhen you are in champion select here is a useful if else case for picking runes\n\nif(opponent at mid is melee) use hybrid penetration else use magic penetration\n\nFor champions:\n\nif(you are : Akali,Corki,Ezreal,Janna,Jax,Kayle,Kennen,KogMaw,Lulu,Nidalee,Poppy,Teemo) definitely use hybrid penetration else if (you are :Diana,Evelynn,Karma,Lux,Morgana,Nami,Orianna,Zyra,Zilean,Ziggs,Twisted Fate,Tristana,Sona) hybrid penetration optional according to style else use magic penetration"
