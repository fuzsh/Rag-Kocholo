        "text": "Edited by Francesco Medici\n\n© Francesco Medici - all rights reserved 2020\n\nThe first Arabic-language literary circle in North America, known as al-Rābiṭah al-Qalamiyyah, or simply Arrabitah (literally in English, “The Pen Bond,” or “The Pen League,” or “The Association of the Pen,”), was founded or re-formed (its first official formation was due to Nasib Aridah and Abd al-Masih Haddad and dates back 1916) on 28 April 1920 by a group of Arab immigrant writers in New York led by Kahlil Gibran. The other members of the society were Mikhail Naimy, Elia Abu Madi, Rashid Ayyub, Wadi Bahout, William Catzeflis, Nadra Haddad (Abd al-Masih’s brother) and, at least for a certain period, Ameen Rihani.\n\nUnfortunately, the league, that dissolved following Gibran’s death in 1931 and Naimy’s return to Lebanon in 1932, could publish only an anthology collecting some of its members’ Arabic best poems. It came out in New York a year after society’s (re)foundation with the title Majmūʻat al-Rābiṭah al-Qalamiyyah li-Sanat 1921 (“The Collection of the Pen Bond for the Year 1921,” New York, 1921).\n\nThe volume includes amongst others the almost unknown poem Dū‘a’ (literally, call, invocation of God, supplication, request, plea, good wish), that Gibran wrote in collaboration with Naimy, Aridah and Abd al-Masih Haddad, and that was signed by all four writers – a unique case in the story of Arrabitah.\n\nThe late Arthur John Arberry (1905-1969), a British respected scholar of Arabic, Persian, and Islamic studies, included said rare and precious poem in his book Modern Arabic Poetry: An Anthology with English Verse Translations (first published by Taylor’s Foreign Press in 1950 and reprinted by the Cambridge University Press in 1967) under the title Prayer. Below are Arberry’s translation into English of Dū‘a’ and its original Arabic version.\n\nPRAYER\n\nSing me, O silence of the night,\n\nA melody\n\nHymned in the silent Infinite\n\nEternally.\n\nOpen mine eyes, ye stars above,\n\nLit by your ray\n\nThat I may know the secret of\n\nThe hidden Way.\n\nMake me a carpet, O ye flowers,\n\nThat I may rise\n\nThereon transported, to the bowers\n\nOf Paradise:\n\nAnd, as the slave desireth still\n\nBut liberty,\n\nThere let me pasture at my will\n\nFor ever free.\n\nBreezes of night, O suddenly\n\nSeize up my soul,\n\nBefore your feet that it may be\n\nAn offering whole.\n\nToo long a prisoner I have lain\n\nIn dark despair,\n\nToo long the weight of human pain\n\nConstrained to bear.\n\nFor human fortune what care I?\n\nO lift me, then,\n\nAnd let them in their squalor lie,\n\nThese mortal men.\n\nMy heart is weary of their ways\n\nAnd changeless use,\n\nTheir loves, their hates, their hollow praise,\n\nTheir mean abuse:\n\nMy tongue is grown to fear what next\n\nMy tongue may tell,\n\nMy mind is wretched, and perplexed\n\nIn its own hell.\n\nMy slumber is a trembling breath,\n\nMy bed a thorn,\n\nMy righteousness is sin, my faith\n\nAll turned to scorn:\n\nMy drink a thirst unquenchable\n\nAnd raging yet,\n\nMy food, a hunger of the soul\n\nInsatiate:\n\nMy robe, the ashes of my mind,\n\nThe winnowed fires\n\nBorne fitfully upon the wind\n\nOf vain desires.\n\nSuch is my life: unending wars,\n\nWhich if I gain\n\nMy guerdon is the prison bars,\n\nAnd spirit slain.\n\nKahlil Gibran\n\nMikhail Naimy\n\nNasib Aridah\n\nAbd al-Masih Haddad\n\nThe Author of this article would like to thank:\n\nNadine Najem for transcribing and revising the original Arabic text;\n\nDr. Nadim Shehadi, Executive Director of the Lebanese American University’s New York Headquarters and Academic Center, for sharing the picture of the Members of the Syrian Lebanese League in North America in front of the White House (Washington, D.C., 1921)."
