        "text": "One of the things I was most excited about visiting Japan was the stationery. I knew it was a country filled with great opportunities to peruse and purchase stationery-typed things, and indeed it did not disappoint. I purchased from stationery shops, art shops, stationery departments in book stores and department stores, and in a couple instances from convenience stores. (Would you buy stationery from an American 7-Eleven? No, but you can from a Japanese 7-Eleven!)\n\nMy stationery obsession has upped dramatically in the past couple years, and that obsession was definitely catered to in a country obsessed with stationery. The selection in Japan is bigger, better, and get this, much cheaper than you could find in the States. Many things I bought cost about 75% than what I would have paid in the US, many things were even half or a third as much! Of course, one has to go to Japan to get that savings, but if you are already going, I say take advantage of it.\n\nA few of the things I bought I already knew that I wanted to get. Several were things that piqued my interest when I’ve perused JetPens or Gentleman Stationer, but didn’t buy yet. And a few were things I did not know existed. I brought back a lot of stuff from my almost two weeks in country. I’m breaking this into two parts, the second and final post will be about paper/notebooks. Let’s get started, shall we? Oh yeah, I’m including where I got the pen/pencil from and how much it costs in Japan vs. how much it costs here, both converted to US dollar. Since I didn’t save my receipts, a lot of this is off memory.\n\nRhodia retractable ballpoint pen. MARUZEN Marunouchi, about $20 (no known US value) This was the first store I visited, on my first full day in Japan, Friday March 24. Maruzen was just across the street from Tokyo Station. I’m a lover of Rhodia and had not seen Rhodia pens before, so picking this up was a no brainer, especially since the pen was orange! (The irony! The first stationery item I buy in Japan is from a French company.) Besides that, it’s an aluminum body retractable ballpoint pen, aka a clicker pen. It’s pretty ordinary, though, and probably the most underwhelming stationery thing I bought in Japan. Oh well.\n\nMeister by Point Felt Tip Marker – 0.8 mm. Tokyu Hands Shinjuku. $8 in Japan, $13.50 in US. Saturday March 25. This multi-level department store is right next to Shinjuku Station, supposedly the busiest train station in the world! One floor was just for stationery, and that’s where I found this felt-tipped pen that uses International standard fountain pen cartridges. I loaded it up with some brown ink I had on hand. I like the way this pen feels and writes/draws. The only drawback is the tip dries up after a few days of non-use, so there’s some coaxing to get it flowing again.\n\nKuretake No. 50 Fountain Brush Pen. Sekaido Shinjuku. $30 in Japan, would be $40-50 in US. Saturday March 25 One of my goals was to buy a fancy brush pen. I was intrigued by this pen when I first saw it on Jet Pens: a brass bodied pen with natural sable bristles that accepts Platinum cartridges. Oh yeah, it comes in a nice bamboo box. Sekaido is a multi-floor art/stationery store, and I had to ask for this at the counter. So far this pen has not disappointed. Think of it as a much more refined Pentel Pocket Brush Pen. And we all know I’m a sucker for a brass pen! Since this takes Platinum cartridges, I made sure I immediately loaded it with a Carbon Black Ink cartridge–waterproof!\n\nPilot E95S (or Elite 95S) fountain pen. Itoya Ginza, $75 in Japan, $145-$180 in US. Sunday March 26 The other big goal was to get a fancy fountain pen. How fancy? At least one with a gold nib. Initially I was thinking about a Platinum 3776 Century, but then I aimed for this pocketable classic. The Elite 95S is slightly longer than a Kaweco when capped. The cap is aluminum, the body resin, and tip 14 karat gold, my first! The Itoya stationery store in the Ginza District is about ten stories high (!) and possibly the most intense stationery shop setting you will ever find yourself in. And the nice fountain pen department (the entire third floor) is full of display cases and attendants. It’s a very formal experience: Talk to the salesperson about the pen, test it, buy it. Yeah, this is the only time I’ve gotten that level of service in buying a pen, but it was nice. (Even nicer: it was half as much as if I bought it online from JetPens.) It was very helpful, as I thought I wanted a fine nib, but when testing them, I really liked the extra fine instead.\n\nItoya “Helvetica” mechanical pencil. 0.5mm lead Itoya Ginza, $8 in Japan, $24 and up in the US. Sunday March 26 The fifth floor of Itoya was the general pen/pencil floor, crammed to the gills with all sorts of inexpensive to moderate priced writing instruments. It was also crammed to the gills with people, so “shopping” on this level was a bit hard. Still, I gravitated to the display of Itoya’s in-house “Helvetica” writing instruments. I wasn’t looking for another mechanical pencil, but I liked the look of it, and it felt good in the hand. I didn’t realize until later that the pencil has a brass body underneath that paint. Nice! Paying $24 for a brass mechanical pencil in the US, as you would at Topdrawer, Itoya’s American outlet, seems like a fair price. The fact that I got it for a third as much in Japan was a very nice bonus!\n\nSakura Ballsign ID gel pen, 0.4mm tip. Itoya Ginza, about $2 in Japan, $3.30 in US. Sunday March 26. I’m not big on gel pens, but in the murk of the fifth floor of Itoya, this one caught my eye. I like the feel and the brown ink. And it was pretty damn cheap.\n\nZebra “Wetnie” ballpoint pen. Yurindo Atoreshinurayasuten at Shin-Urayasu Station. About $4.50 in Japan, unknown in US. Tuesday March 28. I wasn’t intending to go to this book shop, but it was in the mall at the railway station, in the path from my entry to the platform, so why not stop? (Japan is very big on malls at train stations.) Even this small bookshop had a decent stationery department, one where I made two discoveries. The first is this “Wetnie” pen. It’s got a very robust stainless steel body, a very nice “click” feeling, and uses pressurized ink, which should write in a variety of conditions like a Fisher Space Pen. And it doesn’t appear to be sold in the US, though JetPens has the Zebra X-701 which looks to be a more refined (matte black) version of the Wetnie, at about three times the price! (I decided to pick up an additional one from another shop later in the trip, so if I lose the first one I have a backup.)\n\nCraft Design Technology Pentel “plastic fountain pen”. Yurindo Atoreshinurayasuten at Shin-Urayasu Station. About $4.00 in Japan, $7-10 in US. Tuesday March 28. This is basically just a dressed-up version of the Pentel Tradio sketch pen with its variable width line, a pen I already have and like. But I like the forest green color of the body, and I got this pen for half as much as I get in the States. So why not grab another?\n\nPenco Drafting Ballpoint Pen. TSUTAYA BOOKS Umeda Store in LUCUA Osaka. $18 in Japan, $36 in US. Thursday March 30. I’ve been on the lookout for a “nice” drafting-style ballpoint, and had seen this pen featured at the Gentlemen Stationer. Then I spotted it in a Penco display at this bookstore on the ninth floor of LUCUA, right next to Osaka Station. It was half as much as I would pay in the US, so picking it up was a no-brainer. I dig the look and love how it writes, though I will note it is on the short size, about as long as a capped Kaweco Sport fountain pen!\n\nPlatinum Preppy Fountain Pen, 05 size. Stationery Shop TAG – Main Store / Takeda Jimuki in Kyoto. $3 in Japan, $5.50 in US. Saturday April 1st. Yeah, I have Preppies, no doubt, but never had one in the 05 size. So now I complete the collection of the three different nib sizes (o2, 03, 05) And TAG is a lovely stationery shop if you ever find yourself in Kyoto!\n\nPenco Perfection pocket bullet pen, gold finish. Neue in Tokyo Station. $24 in Japan, $46 in US. Monday April 3. Let’s (almost) close out this haul with a fancy pocket pen! I lusted after this brass-body Penco Perfection when I first saw it at Gentlemen Stationer, but instead got the more austere (and perfectly fine) plastic version. So when I found this in the basement of Tokyo Station, and for nearly half as much as if I would get it from TGS? It was another no-brainer to buy. (Sorry, Joe!) This pen has a nice weight in the hands and writes splendidly. I doubt I would ever need a nicer pocket ballpoint."
