        "text": "Plasma Pen treatments are in a league all their own. The skin-rejuvenating treatment employs plasma generated by a unique pen-like device that produces a controlled injury to trigger the skin to make more collagen and leave it looking tighter and firmer. It’s known that safely inducing micro-wounds sends the skin into repair mode to turn back the hands of time.\n\nUnlike other treatments that injure the skin, like microneedling and lasers, the relatively newer nonsurgical modality of Plasma Pen is different because they deliver a plasma energy arc from the tip of the pen to the skin’s surface, leaving the surrounding areas of skin untouched and intact for tighter skin. In addition, the Plasma Pen has many uses that extend beyond other skin-tightening devices, and we’re diving into all of them below.\n\nThe short answer is yes. Plasma Pens work very well to regenerate and tighten the upper layer of skin by creating tiny dots on the skin, delivering plasma energy to the skin through the tip of a small needle attached to the end of the pen. The pen creates a plasma energy arc that only delivers to a precise area; the rest of the skin surrounding the target area is not touched or wounded. Plasma Pen also benefits the deeper dermal layers of the skin. By delivering targeted heat, the fibroblasts are stimulated to start collagen production, helping to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and acne scars.\n\nMany patients ask, “Do Plasma Pens work,” and we can confidently say they do. The treatment is known to deliver a tightening effect on the skin in a given area to minimize the appearance of wrinkles and lines. Some patients even see less loose skin after a treatment.\n\nIt’s important to know that a Plasma Pen treatment is a type of skin resurfacing, albeit different from a laser, because a controlled skin injury is created to ‘turn on’ the skin’s normal healing process. As the treated area begins to heal, new collagen is produced to remodel the skin on the surface so that it’s smoother, tighter, and visible signs of aging are less apparent. However, a Plasma Pen procedure doesn’t’ result in open wounds post-treatment, like other ablative or resurfacing procedures, making for a much easier recovery process with fewer risks.\n\nA Plasma Pen eye lift is one of the most popular uses of the device. When treating the eyes with a Plasma Pen, the goal is to reduce the appearance of undereye bags by tightening the skin and reducing discoloration. Plasma Pen eye treatments are safe to use on all areas of the eyes, including the eyelids. In addition, Plasma Pen eyes, as the treatment is commonly called, can give a nonsurgical eye-lifting effect.\n\nBeyond the upper eyelids and bags under the lower eyes, a Plasma Pen eye lift also helps to tighten skin on and around the eyes. Some patients appreciate Plasma Pen under-eye treatments for helping to improve the looking age-related bags, while others see improvements in hooded upper eyelids, fine lines, and crow’s feet.\n\nWhen using a plasma pen for stretch marks, the treatment lasts about 30 minutes on average. However, the results are relatively long-lasting. Most patients treating plasma pen stretch marks can see improvement in the area for two to three years.\n\nPlasma Pen treatments are safe and effective for minimizing the appearance of stretch marks on the skin, no matter where on the body they exist. The Plasma Pen procedure works to tighten the skin and stimulate new collagen production, which helps reduce the scars’ appearance by replacing damaging collagen with new collagen for less noticeable scarring and discoloration and smoother-looking skin.\n\nA Plasma Pen treatment is a straightforward treatment regardless of where on the face or body the procedure is being performed. The non-surgical treatment utilizes a Plasma Pen to tighten and smooth the skin to stimulate new collagen for a rejuvenated appearance.\n\nPlasma Pen protocol employs a specialized device to activate fibroblasts within the skin, responsible for collagen production. The handheld tool converts an electrical charge into energy, creating a stream of nitrogen plasma gas through an arc. This arc is responsible for creating micro injuries on the skin’s surface while simultaneously delivering safe and controlled amounts of heat to the lower layers of the skin to target the fibroblasts. The micro injuries prompt the skin’s natural wound-healing process, which boosts new collagen production for firmer, smoother skin over time. In turn, issues and concerns such as jowls and skin laxity on the neck and the eye area are addressed with plasma pen treatments. Plus, the device has ablative resurfacing properties that remove the outer layers of damaged skin helping to erase the look of acne scars, skin tags, age spots, fine lines, and wrinkles.\n\nPlasma Pen treatments are effective solutions for scar treatment. The procedure works by stimulating collagen in the skin to heal and improve the texture, tone, and appearance of scars. By creating new, healthy collagen in the skin, the damaged tissue is repaired, making the scars less visible and smoother over time.\n\nSmall, targeted applications of Plasma Pen treatments improve a scarred area. The pen creates tiny dots on the skin, which are technically micro injuries that stimulate the body’s natural healing response and encourage new collagen to improve scarring.\n\nSimilarly, Plasma Pen can be used for skin tag removal. In this case, the plasma pen also creates a slight injury on the surface of the skin tag, causing it to dry out and fall off. Plasma Pen treatments for skin tags require applying the pen directly to the tag, making it a popular treatment for skin tag removal without downtime, incisions, stitches, or significant recovery."
