        "text": "Rockford, IL–Phil Tomasino scored two goals to lead the Admirals to a 3-2 win over the Rockford IceHogs Saturday at BMO Center.\n\nThe Admirals clinched first place in the American Hockey League’s (AHL) Central Division with the win. It’s Milwaukee’s seventh division title since joining the AHL in 2001.\n\nAdmirals defenseman Roland McKeown played his 500th professional game. It was his 460th in the AHL. He’s also played 16 in the National Hockey League and 24 in the Swedish Hockey League.\n\nMilwaukee scored the first goal of the game just 1:01 into the first period. Ozzy Wiesblatt knocked a Rockford player off the puck in the IceHogs zone. Defenseman Ryan Ufko took the puck and skated to the right circle before sliding a pass to the slot for Tomasino. Tomasino snapped a one-timer into the net for his eighth goal of the season.\n\nRockford tied the game at 15:34 of the first period. An errant pass at the Admirals blue line was intercepted by Rem Pitlick. Pitlick skated to the left circle and sent a wrist shot over the arm of Ads goalie Yaroslav Askarov for his 20th goal of the season.\n\nMilwaukee claimed a 2-1 lead at 9:15 of the second period. McKeown’s shot from the right point was deflected into the net by Cal O’Reilly. It was O’Reilly’s 10th goal of the season. McKeown and Kevin Gravel picked up the assists.\n\nTomasino scored his second goal of the game at 5:58 of the third period to give Milwaukee a 3-1 lead. Juuso Parssinen won a face-off against Zach Sanford in the left circle. Parssinen pushed the puck forward and sidestepped Sanford. He then fed a pass to Tomasino for a deflection into the net. It was Tomasino’s ninth goal of the season.\n\nSanford scored a shorthanded goal to bring the IceHogs within a goal at 14:02 of the third frame.\n\nAskarov earned the win with 21 saves.\n\nMilwaukee will play at Rockford again Sun., Apr. 14. The Admirals return to UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena Wed., Apr. 17 to host the Manitoba Moose."
