        "text": "Christopher Buck, “Kahlil Gibran.” American Writers: A Collection of Literary Biographies. Supplement XX. Edited by Jay Parini. Farmington Hills, MI: Scribner’s Reference/The Gale Group, 2010. Pp. 113–129. KAHLIL GIBRAN (1883–1931) Christopher Buck The Arab American author and artist Kahlil Gibran was a best-selling writer whose work has yet to receive critical acclaim equal to his popular appeal. There is no question that Gibran’s work in Arabic was central to the development of twentieth-century Arabic literature—in that Arab Romanticism begins with Gibran, the pivotal figure in the Mahjar movement of émigré Arab writers centered in New York. There is also no question that Kahlil Gibran’s masterpiece, The Prophet (1923)—a small volume of aphorisms (wise sayings) offering pithy wisdom of an almost prophetic quality—belongs to world literature, for it is known and loved the world over. As an American man of letters, however, Gibran has received scant attention by American literary critics. Since The Prophet has yet to be widely recognized as an American classic, and the author yet to be fully accepted as an American writer, Gibran’s inclusion in the American Writers series requires some justification. Eminent scholars including Irfan Shahid (professor emeritus at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.) and Suheil Bushrui (professor emeritus and current director of the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland at College Park) have made the case for Gibran’s recognition as an American writer worthy of note. According to Bushrui, America is entitled to claim Gibran as one of its sons (even if not a native son) as fully and as authentically as his native Lebanon can lay such claim: “In his work, he became not only Gibran of Lebanon, but Gibran of America, indeed Gibran the voice of global consciousness” (1996, p. 10). After all, the young Gibran spent only the first twelve years of his life in Bsharri (a village near the famous “Cedars of God”), where he was born in 1883, before emigrating with his family to the United States. Apart from a two-year study in Paris and two brief return visits to Lebanon, Gibran spent his entire adult life—the last two-thirds of his life, in fact—entirely on American soil, dying in New York at the age of forty-eight. In The Prophet, the city of Orphalese is often said to represent America (or New York). Shahid underscores the fact The Prophet was America’s best-selling book of the twentieth century, not counting the Bible, and that Gibran outsold all other American poets, from Walt Whitman to Robert Frost. According to Gibran’s New York publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, The Prophet has sold more than ten million copies. The book’s success was due entirely to its own appeal, as Knopf never promoted it. Strangely, Gibran is arguably America’s best-loved prose-poet, whose market appeal continues despite critical indifference. It’s true that Gibran had what might be called a double psyche, and inhabited two thought-worlds at once. As an Arab American, Gibran wrote in two languages: English and Arabic. Arabic was his mother tongue, and English his second language. As an accomplished man of letters of considerable influence in the Middle East, Gibran inspired a literary renaissance in the Arab world, such that all modern Arabic poetry bears the marks of Gibran’s. Yet Gibran’s work has had little influence in American letters, despite its enormous popular appeal. Notwithstanding, Shahid thinks that Gibran has not been fairly treated as an American writer. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that, categorically, The Prophet exists in splendid isolation, severed from its Arabic cultural roots. And so The Prophet will have to be evaluated, or reevaluated, on its own literary merits and for its singular contribution to the American literary heritage.\n\nAbstract This paper offers a summary of Gibran’s life, the story of a visionary youth who turned out to be the most famous Arab American ever and one of the world’s great writers by virtue of the phenomenal success of his works. To identify his identity and ideology, it would be useful to highlight some of the most important events in Gibran’s life to understand his cultural identity. The paper also highlights a list of his Arabic and English works, his anthropological thought, elements of his homeland, his Utopia anthology, his political and social thought and his literary creativity. It also highlights some previous studies on Gibran’s works. Gibran’s name was mistakenly written and shortened to “Kahlil Gibran” on September 30, 1895, merely two months after his arrival in the U.S.A. The misspelling of Gibran’s name remained, against his desire, for the rest of his life in spite of repeated attempts to correct and restore his full name of “Gibran Khalil Gibran”. The writer of the present research adopts the graphic “Khalil” instead of “Kahlil”, partly to respect Gibran’s desire and also as a reflection of correct Arabic pronunciation. Key words: Gibran, ideology, universality, cultural identity, utopia anthology.\n\nGibran Khalil Gibran (1882-1931), the Lebanese writer, poet, artist and philosopher, was the bearer of faith in the unity of all religions. He was a key figure in the history of modern EnglishandArabic literature in early 20th Century.The present paper is to show how Gibran represents the world and undesirable social practices in the time of writing his greatest book The Prophet (1923). Gibran lets the readers fell that the prophet (Al-Mustafa) doesn't belong to this very world; he comes to Orphalese to teach humanity and to correct the society under the tenets of all major religious. Each character in The Prophet, except Al-Mustafa, resamples one member of the deformed society who seeks deliverance. Gibran shortens the process of life and its needs in the 28 texts allowing the readers take an active role to interpret and to dictate the context on oblique hints and innuendo. Gibran views the world as a place that lacks love and peace, where individuals' life is depraved and corrupted. The most obvious, Gibran is speaking through the mouth of Al-Mustafa preaching many commandments, disciplines and rituals.\n\nGibran Khalil Gibran loved women, but he did not love one woman, for he shared his life with a number of women, and these women saw him under different names such as mother, sister, beloved, friend and others, but did Gibran appreciate their great role in the stages of his life and did they influence These women in his literary life and how they affected? This research aims to shed light on this aspect of the life of this writer, answering such two questions, to show the extent of the impact of women in Gibran&#39;s literary life, using the descriptive-analytical approach. And the most important findings of the research. The results are that the woman played a great role in the formation of Gibran&#39;s literary personality, as his works gave a special color and character that differed from the works of others, and this is evident through his writings. This Mary Haskell was unique among all women with the first lover in his literary life, as he still frequently shows his love for..."
