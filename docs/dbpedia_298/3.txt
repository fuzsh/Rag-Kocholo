Dear Robert Baker:

Thank you for contacting Hyundai Motor America. We are sorry to learn of your dissatisfaction with the diagnosis performed by Rogers Hyundai for your 2009 Hyundai Genesis Sedan.

Repairs for the glass in your Genesis Sedan are covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty for a period of 5 years from the date of original retail delivery or the date of first use or 60,000 miles, whichever occurs first. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty covers repair or replacement of eligible components originally manufactured or installed by Hyundai that are found to be defective in material or workmanship under normal use and maintenance, as determined by your authorized Hyundai dealership.

We have contacted the Service Manager at Rogers Hyundai who advised that the issue with the sunroof glass was not a result of defect in the material or workmanship. As a result, we are unable to provide any financial assistance with the cost of the repairs for your Genesis Sedan.

We make every effort to resolve every customer concern in a satisfactory manner. However, we realize that mutual agreement on some issues may not be possible. To ensure that you have an had an opportunity to have your concern fully reviewed, we provide an Alternative Dispute Resolution program. This service is provided at no cost to you and is part of our effort to provide you with an impartial third-party organization to equitably resolve your concerns. Please review the Alternative Dispute Resolution section in your Owner’s Handbook for more information.

We have verified the maintenance program you purchased for your Genesis Sedan is not a service contract offered by Hyundai. We recommend contacting Rogers Hyundai to address any questions or concerns you may have regarding the third-party maintenance contract. You may reach them directly at (312) 225-4300

We are pleased to learn you continued to work with Rogers Hyundai to have your Genesis Sedan’s sunroof glass replaced. We are confident our technicians were able to properly address the issue with the sunglass roof. Servicing your vehicle at your local Hyundai dealership ensures that your Hyundai will be repaired by factory-trained Hyundai technicians who have specialized diagnostic equipment. In addition, our dealerships use only genuine Hyundai parts and accessories to protect your investment.

We have documented this update under your existing Case # 4497552. Please reference your Case # if we can provide further information. We truly value your loyalty to the Hyundai brand and hope you will give us another opportunity in the future.

Thank you for contacting Hyundai Motor America.

Thank you for your prompt response, but you did not answer my question. Is this manufacture defect covered under my warranty? My vehicle is presently at the dealership having the glass replaced. According to the dealer it’s not covered and I am required to pay out of pocket over $500. (I’m a 62 year old retiree on a fixed income). I checked with my auto insurance carrier and they do not cover replacing glass, only

repairing. I unfortunately purchased through the dealership a useless maintenance program (NSD) that is suppose to cover windshields, lost keys, nicks, etc and they advised me that the sunroof glass is not a windshield and to check with my dealer. So, I need to know what form of compensation are you will to provide. If none, what other form of recourse do I have. This is the third Hyundai that I have purchased from your company. I hope this one incident is not going to deter the customer/company good will/good faith relationship that we have had.

Comment: On July 28,2011, my wife and I were driving west on I88 at route 53 when my sunroof suddenly exploded outward. Dealer informed me that this was not covered because something must have hit the glass, which was not the case. In searching the

internet under ‘sunroof exploded’, I came across a number of similar incidents. Attached is the website: http://townhall-talk.edmunds.com/direct/view/.f1291fc . This is a manufacturing defect and should be covered under my warranty. Please respond. Thank you.
