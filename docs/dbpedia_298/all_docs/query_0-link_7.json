        "text": "Throughout the history of professional wrestling, the business has awarded championship belts in many divisions. While some have been forgotten over the years, some titles have stood the test of time.\n\nThe WWE has seen almost 30 titles defended, but today only six remain.\n\nTNA Wrestling began with three titles—the NWA World, Tag Team Championships, and its own X-Division title. Today, TNA owns its own belts and fans see six titles defended between its ropes.\n\nRing of Honor Wrestling began with just two, but has since added another title to its ranks.\n\nWhile Shimmer has only been around for a few years, the most well-known all-women’s wrestling promotion currently holds two titles.\n\nWrestling Gold will concentrate on the active titles of the companies listed, as well as the NWA World and Tag Team Championships and any other active title the readers would like to see!\n\nThat’s right.\n\nIf there’s a championship you’d like to see included, it will be added to the series.\n\nTNA X-Division Championship\n\nThe TNA X-Division Championship was established on June 19, 2002 during TNA Wrestling's second show. At first it was just known as the NWA X Championship but later became known as the NWA-TNA X-Division Championship due to TNA's affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance.\n\nAs the main title of the X-Division, its motto was, \"It's not about weight limits, it's about no limits.\"\n\nMixing traditional wrestling with high-flying maneuvers and Lucha Libre-style wrestling, X-Division matches were some of the most exciting matches to watch. It was the X-Division that helped get TNA noticed by fans due to its similarity with WCW's old cruiserweight division.\n\nThe weight limit part of the motto was never really tested until Samoa Joe made his debut with TNA and won the title a total of four times. Though, the heaviest wrestler to hold the belt was Abyss at 350 pounds.\n\nThe title became known as simply the TNA X-Division Championship when a new title was introduced after TNA left the NWA in 2004. After Destination X 2011, a weight limit was introduced into the division for the first time. At 225 pounds, wrestlers beyond that weight were no longer allowed to compete for the title and the motto was gone.\n\nSamoa Joe would have fought for the title at this past June's Slammiversary, however his appearance was later chalked up as a one-time exhibition for TNA's 10th anniversary show.\n\nThe division has seen a number of specialty matches including the Ultimate X match, an annual event. Others include the Steel Asylum and the Xscape Match, but both of those matches are rarely used anymore.\n\nThe X match title is the oldest in TNA Wrestling. It's appeared since the company's second show and has accumulated 54 champions over its 10-year history. So let's get started!\n\nDefeated: A.J. Styles, Tony Mamaluke, Joel Maximo, Jose Maximo, Ace Steele, Kid Kash, Rick Michaels and Chris Michaels\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: October 9, 2002\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 15\n\nTitle Reign: 14 days\n\nThis was a nine-way ladder match to determine the new champion.\n\nSyxx-Pac made his professional wrestling debut in 1992 as the Lightning Kid on the independent circuit. He would appear for the PWA and the Global Wrestling Federation before making his way to the WWF in 1993.\n\nHe would appear as the Lightning Kid, Kamikaze Kid, Cannonball Kid and the Kid before WWE settled on the name 1-2-3 Kid. He was a jobber at first, but after he defeated Razor Ramon, he became a fan favorite due to his underdog status.\n\nHe spent three years with the company, picking up the Tag Team Championship twice with Marty Jannetty and Bob Holly before leaving for WCW in 1996.\n\nHe debuted as Syxx in WCW and was a member of the New World Order. He mainly competed in the cruiserweight division, wining the Cruiserweight Championship in February 1997. He would suffer a neck injury in October and was released as a result.\n\nHe returned to the WWF in March 1998 as X-Pac and became a member of D-Generation X. He would win the WWF European Championship twice, trading the title with D’lo Brown before losing it to Shane McMahon.\n\nWhen DX disbanded, he formed a team with Kane and won the tag titles two more times. DX would reform in 1999, and he turned on Kane—but a neck injury in 2000 would put him back on the shelf.\n\nHe returned in 2001 and formed X-Factor with Justin Credible and Albert. He would capture the Light Heavyweight Championship twice, and be the final champion to hold it and the WCW Cruiserweight Championship one more time while with the stable.\n\nWhen the nWo made their WWF debut in 2002—kicking out Hulk Hogan after WrestleMania—X-Pac joined up with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. The reunion was cut short, though, when he was released in August.\n\nA month later, X-Pac debuted with TNA Wrestling as Syxx-Pac and won this title rather quickly. After losing the title, he left TNA in November.\n\nX-Pac would jump around XPW, TNA, Wrestling Society X, the NWA, AAA in Mexico and the independent circuit for years before he made his return to WWE in 2011.\n\nHe was last seen on the 1,000th episode of Raw during a full D-Generation X reunion.\n\nDefeated: A.J. Styles\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: November 6, 2002\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 19\n\nTitle Reign: 35 days\n\nJerry Lynn debuted on TNA’s first show in June 2002 and stayed with them until 2004 after he suffered a shoulder injury. He would win this title twice, the Tag Team Championship with A.J. Styles, and the Amazing Red before becoming a road agent due to the injury.\n\nHe returned to the ring in 2005 during an ECW reunion show and returned to TNA in July as a referee in a match between Styles and Sean Waltman.\n\nHe continued his work as a road agent before returning to the ring full time in 2007. He feuded with Daniels over this title, but left TNA in August after failing to win it back. He would return to TNA in 2010 to announce a match against Rob Van Dam, but the contest had to be cancelled due Lynn’s back.\n\nThe match was later reinstated for the following year and a feud between the two began. It culminated at Bound for Glory when Van Dam defeated Lynn in a Full Metal Mayhem match. Lynn has since appeared for Ring of Honor and other independent promotions.\n\nIn March 2012, Lynn announced that he would retire at the end of the year.\n\nDefeated: Sonny Siaki\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: February 12, 2003\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 31\n\nTitle Reign: 77 days\n\nKid Kash made his professional wrestling debut in 1996 on the independent circuit as David Jericho. He found himself in ECW in November, but he returned to the independents shortly afterwards.\n\nHe would appear at a number of WWE house shows in tryout matches, but he broke both his ankles in a match. He returned to ECW in late 1999 as Kid Kask, but would break his jaw within a few months.\n\nDespite the injury, Kash would keep wrestling even though his jaw was wired shut. He was a contender for the ECW World Championship and while he would never win it, he would beomce the Television Champion in August 2000.\n\nHe lost the title two weeks later and stayed with ECW until they were shut down shortly before WCW.\n\nSince WCW was still operating, he made his way there in March as Kash. The company would be shut down a week later, though, so he returned to the independents.\n\nHe debuted with TNA in August 2002 and had the X-Division Championship within six months. After holding the title for two months, he would feud with the likes of James Storm, Dusty Rhodes, AJ Styles and Roddy Piper before he formed a team with Dallas in March 2004.\n\nThey would capture the NWA Tag Team Championship twice before Kash was released in April 2005.\n\nHe would make his WWE debut at the One Night Stand PPV and was signed to the company. He went onto win the Cruiserweight Championship once before forming the Pit Bulls with Jamie Noble. The team was short lived as Kash was released in September 2006.\n\nAfter appearing on the independent circuit, Kash would make his return to TNA Wrestling in 2010 for some appearances before resigning in 2011.\n\nKid Kash is still with TNA and will be competing this Sunday at Hardcore Justice in a tag team match with Gunner against Chavo Guerrero and Hernandez.\n\nDefeated: The Amazing Red and Jerry Lynn\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: May 14, 2003\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 44\n\nTitle Reign: 98 days\n\nThis was a triple threat match.\n\nChris Sabin made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 on the independent circuit. He made his TNA debut in April 2003 and would win this title a month later.\n\nHe became a heel during this time and joined the S.E.X. stable. After losing the title in August, he turned face and won the Super X Cup. He became the No. 1 contender as a result and went onto win the title again in January 2004.\n\nAn injury in March would cut his second reign short, though. He would return in May to join Team TNA in the World X Cup and helped in gaining his team victory. He would remain a contender for this title throughout 2004 and 2005, but he would never regain the title.\n\nHe entered into the tag team division in 2006 when he began to team with Sonjay Dutt. The team would disband when they failed to win the titles in February and Sabin once again competed in the World X Cup on Team USA during the spring.\n\nAfter a feud with Kevin Nash, he became the No. 1 contender for this title and finally won it in October. He would lose it the following month and turn heel as a result.\n\nHe captured the title one more time before forming the Motor City Machine Guns with Alex Shelley in 2007.\n\nDefeated: Chris Sabin and Frankie Kazarian\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: August 20, 2003\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 58\n\nTitle Reign: 140 days\n\nThis was the first ever Ultimate X Match. This match was specially made for the X-Division.\n\nThere is a steel beam attached to each of the four ring posts and two steel cables running across the ring forming an “X.” The TNA X-Division Championship was hanging in the middle of the X and to win, the superstars have to shimmy the cables and grab the title.\n\nMichael Shane made his professional wrestling debut in 1999 on the independent circuit. He would sign with ECW in 2000 and remained with them until they were shut down in 2001.\n\nHe would make appearances for WWE on Velocity and Sunday Night Heat as well as Ring of Honor before making his way to TNA in 2003.\n\nShane would quickly win the title in the first-ever Ultimate X match and soon formed a stable called the New Franchise with Shane Douglas and Traci Brooks. He would lose the title in January 2004 and the stable would break up in April.\n\nTraci would stay with Shane, though, and they were soon joined by Frankie Kazarian after he lost the X-Division Championship to AJ Styles. They would become co-champions after an Ultimate X match and lost the title in a 22-man Gauntlet Match.\n\nThe team would break up when Kazarian left for WWE in 2005.\n\nShane would have to change his name to Matt Bentley in July after WWE threatened to sue him after the signing of Mike Shane of the Shane Twins. He was sparingly used after that, but would join Raven's new Flock, Serotonin, in October 2006 as Martyr.\n\nHe stayed as a member until his contract expired in August 2007. He would appear for the WWE in a squash match against Vladimir Kozlov in 2008 and has appeared on the independent circuit ever since.\n\nHe would make a one night return to TNA in June 2011 in a match against Low Ki and Jimmy Yang, but after losing to Low Ki he returned to the independent circuit where you can still see him today.\n\nDefeated: A.J. Styles\n\nWhere: Nashville, Tenn.\n\nWhen: July 28, 2004\n\nEvent: Weekly PPV No. 104\n\nTitle Reign: 14 days\n\nThis was Ultimate X4. Michael Shane and Kazarian grabbed the title at the same time and were announced as co-champions.\n\nWhen main event star AJ Styles returned to the X-Division, he defeated Frankie Kazarian to win this title. Kazarian was frustrated over the loss, as was Michael Shane, who thought that Styles would return to the division to steal the spotlight.\n\nKazarian and Shane joined forces against Styles in an attempt to take the title from him and get him out of the X-Division. They took the title from him in an Ultimate X match when they both grabbed the title and fell to the mat.\n\nAs a result, TNA declared that they were both champions. Kazarian and Shane defended the title under a modified Freebird Rule that stated that either wrestler could defend the title, but if one of them lost a title match they would both lose the belt.\n\nThey would lose the title two weeks later in a 22-man International X-Division Gauntlet Match, but they remained together as a team.\n\nThey would disband in 2005 when Kazarian left to go to the WWE, though they would reform when he returned a year later and soon join Raven's group Serotonin together. They would disband in 2007 when Kazarian left Serotonin, though.\n\nKazarian is still with TNA as one-half of the tag team champions while Michael Shane can be seen in the independents.\n\nDefeated: Senshi\n\nWhere: Plymouth Township, Mich.\n\nWhen: October 22, 2006\n\nEvent: Bound for Glory\n\nTitle Reign: Two days\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the Motor City Machine Guns were born. Their first big feud came against Team 3D, and they also competed in the 2007 World X Cup.\n\nThe turned heel by the end of the year and failed at winning the Tag Team Championship on multiple occasions. Despite being heels, the Motor City Machine Guns were very popular with the fans due to their skill and great teamwork.\n\nThe team soon became faces as a result and finally won the titles from Beer Money in July 2010. After a phenomenal best of five series of matches with Beer Money, the Motor City Machine Guns cemented themselves as one of the best teams in the business.\n\nThey would defend the titles against Generation Me and Team 3D before losing them back to Beer Money in January 2011. They were used sparingly after that and, after Shelley went down with an injury, Sabin returned to the X-Division.\n\nSabin was barely used and things took a turn for the worse when he tore an ACL the same night Shelley returned in April.\n\nAfter being out for a year, Sabin returned with Shelley and received a title shot at Lockdown. They would lose to champions Samoa Joe and Magnus and disappear afterwards.\n\nIn May, Shelley left TNA which killed the team's return before it got off the ground.\n\nDefeated: A.J. Styles and Chris Sabin\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: November 6, 2006\n\nEvent: Impact\n\nTitle Reign: 69 days\n\nThis was a triple threat match.\n\nDaniels made his TNA Wrestling debut around the time the company was founded in June 2002. He formed Triple X with Low Ki and Elix Skipper and the stable would compete for the NWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nHe would hold the titles three times with Triple X as well as one time with James Storm during a Triple X/America’s Most Wanted storyline.\n\nIn 2005, Daniels began his long standing feud with AJ Styles over this title. The feud would evolve into a triple threat involving Samoa Joe. The three of them would face off at Unbreakable.\n\nThe match would receive a rare five stars from Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter and is currently the only TNA match to get the distinction.\n\nDaniels would continue to feud and team with Styles for years after this, and they would have two reigns as NWA tag team champions together. He would remain in contention for this title until 2008 when his Feast or Fired briefcase contained a pink slip.\n\nHe would return, though, as Curry Man until the character was dropped when Daniels once again was fired via briefcase.\n\nHe returned under another mask, this time Suicide, when Kazarian was unable to compete, but he returned as himself in April 2009. He would soon get his first shot at the world title when he sparked his feud back up with Styles. He was not able to win.\n\nDaniels would leave in 2010, though he ended up returning as a member of Fortune to defend the injured Styles in 2011.\n\nDaniels would soon turn heel and begin to feud with Styles again at Destination X 2011. The feud has been going on ever since with Daniels winning the TNA Tag Team Championship twice with Kazarian.\n\nDefeated: Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: June 19, 2007\n\nEvent: Impact\n\nTitle Reign: 54 days\n\nThis was a triple threat match.\n\nSamoa Joe made his TNA Wrestling debut at the first Slammiversary event against Sonjay Dutt. Mike Tenay would dub him the Samoan Submission Machine and the name stuck.\n\nJoe would begin a year-long undefeated streak and, due to the \"no limits\" nature of the X-Division, Samoa Joe competed in the division. He had his first title shot at Unbreakable against AJ Styles and Christopher Daniels.\n\nIt received five stars from Meltzer, which is the only TNA match to ever hold the honor. Samoa Joe won the title twice during his undefeated streak. He would lose the titles in multi-man matches and since he wasn't pinned, the streak stayed intact.\n\nAfter losing his second title, Joe began to target the NWA World Championship. Before he could challenge for the title, Kurt Angle made his TNA debut in October 2006.\n\nOne of the best wrestlers in the world targeted the best wrestler in TNA and Angle head-butted Joe and delivered the Angle Slam. His actions sparked a massive feud between the two which saw Angle end Joe's undefeated streak.\n\nThey had three great matches ending with an Iron Man Match at Final Resolution 2007. The feud wouldn't end there, though, as they fought over all of the titles in TNA. It resulted in Kurt Angle becoming the only TNA wrestler to hold all titles simultaneously.\n\nAt Lockdown, Joe would finally win the world title by defeating Angle in the Six Sides of Steel. He would hold the title for 182 days before losing it to Sting at Bound for Glory IV.\n\nIn December, Joe would be attacked by the Main Event Mafia and be sidelined with an injury.\n\nDefeated: Jay Lethal\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: January 21, 2008\n\nEvent: Impact\n\nTitle Reign: 20 days\n\nEven though Johnny Devine and Team 3D had the X-Division Championship, Jay Lethal was still the champion. So when Devine defeated Lethal, he became the new champion.\n\nJohnny Devine made his professional wrestling debut in 1997 after training in the famed Hart Dungeon. He was first known as Vinny Vegas on the Canadian independent circuit before joining Stampede Wrestling in 1999.\n\nHe competed in dark matches for ECW and WWE before making his way to TNA in 2004. He was a member of Team Canada in the 2004 World X Cup, but he and his team would lose to Team USA.\n\nHe stuck around as a member of Team Canada until September when he was stabbed at a bar in Nashville. Surgery took him out for about two months, but he made his way to Memphis Wrestling in 2005. Another injury forced him out of competition in March, though.\n\nIn July, he got a tryout with WWE as J.P. Parsons. With his partner Ruffy Silverstein, they competed in a squash match against Road Warrior Animal and Heidenreich.\n\nAfter some time in the independents, Devine returned to TNA in May 2006. He was once again a member of Team Canada for the World X Cup. They received second place.\n\nA month later, Team Canada would disband and after sometime with Kevin Nash’s Paparazzi Productions, Devine became Havoc and joined Raven’s newest flock, Serotonin.\n\nBy the end of 2007, he was back as Johnny Devine and joined Team 3D in their fight to end the X-Division. He would capture his only TNA title here during the storyline, and he would stick with Team 3D until his release in October 2008.\n\nYou can see Johnny Devine on the independent circuit.\n\nDefeated: Petey Williams and Consequences Creed\n\nWhere: Oshawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nWhen: September 14, 2008\n\nEvent: No Surrender\n\nTitle Reign: 84 days\n\nThis was a triple threat match.\n\nOn November 13, Eric Young would win the title after referee Shawn Sewell attacked Bashir. Bashir would be awarded back the title, though, by TNA management director Jim Cornette due to referee bias.\n\nSheik Abdul Bashir made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 in All-Star Championship Wrestling. He would compete in the independents until he received a TNA tryout in February 2003 with Ken Anderson in a tag team match against Mike Sanders and Glenn Gilberti.\n\nSix months later, he appeared as Sheik Shawn Daivari in a match against Tommy Dreamer on Sunday Night Heat. Nothing came of either tryout and he began to appear for Ring of Honor in April 2004.\n\nHe would finally sign with WWE in August and debuted in October as Khosrow Daivari alongside Muhammad Hassan.\n\nHis most memorable storylines during this time would be against Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels as well as the infamous terrorist storyline on SmackDown with the Undertaker.\n\nDue to the London terrorist attacks, UPN wanted Hassan off of their channel. WWE killed off the character when the Undertaker delivered a Last Ride through the stage.\n\nDaivari was sent to Deep South Wrestling afterwards and in November 2005, he re-debuted as the manager of the Great Khali. He was dropped as his manager in 2007 and competed in the cruiserweight division until he was lost in the fold and released in October.\n\nHe would compete in the independents until debuting in TNA as the captain of Team International in the 2008 World X Cup. As Sheik Abdul Bashir, he went onto win this title in September. After a feud with Eric Young, he would lose the title and join the World Elite when Young turned heel in July 2009.\n\nBashir would be released in December after getting a pink slip in the Feast or Fired match and can now be seen on the independent circuit and in Ring of Honor.\n\nDefeated: Sheik Abdul Bashir\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: December 7, 2008\n\nEvent: Final Resolution\n\nTitle Reign: A few minutes\n\nAfter the match, Bashir attacked Young and stole the title. He then proceeded to attack referee Shane Sewell and bloodied him.\n\nAs Bashir made his way up the ramp, TNA management director Jim Cornette took the title from him. Later in the night, it was announced that the title was vacant and that it would be on the line in a tournament.\n\nEric Young made his professional wrestling debut on the independent circuit in the United States and Canada. He appeared for the WWE a few times on Velocity and Sunday Night Hear before heading to TNA in 2004 as a member of Team Canada in the World X Cup.\n\nHe would win the Tag Team Championship twice with Bobby Roode and soon developed a paranoid gimmick. The gimmick got stronger and turned him face after the disbanding of Team Canada in July 2006 and his \"Don't Fire Eric\" campaign.\n\nHe would go through various feuds and many comedy gimmicks, including a very short reign as tag team champion as Super Eric, before turning heel after winning the Legends Championship.\n\nForming the World Elite and renaming the title to the Global Championship, Young declared that he would never defend the title on American soil and never against an American wrestler. He would lose the title to fellow World Elite member Rob Terry and the stable began to dissolve.\n\nYoung would gain one more reign as tag team champion with Kevin Nash and Scott Hall before hitting his head and reverting back to a comedy gimmick.\n\nUnder his new, and current, gimmick, Young captured the Television Championship and formed a team with ODB. This would result in becoming one-half of the Knockouts tag team champions and getting married in storyline.\n\nEric Young remains with TNA and is still the champion of a women's title.\n\nDefeated: Chris Sabin\n\nWhere: Charlotte, N.C.\n\nWhen: January 11, 2009\n\nEvent: Genesis\n\nTitle Reign: 63 days\n\nAlex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin in a tournament final to become the new champion.\n\nAlex Shelley made his professional wrestling debut in 2002 in Canada. He made his way to Ring of Honor in 2003, but was sparingly used.\n\nHe was the leader of Generation Next with Austin Aries, Jack Evans and Roderick Strong in 2004, but he would make his way to TNA that same year. He would wrestle for both companies until he left ROH in 2006 to stay with TNA.\n\nHe made appearances in 2007, 2008 and 2010 with Chris Sabin, but he primarily stayed in TNA.\n\nWith TNA, he entered into the X-Division, but was randomly used until he began to bring a camera to the ring to film his matches.\n\nThe gimmick would evolve into Paparazzi Productions and an alliance with Kevin Nash. It would also see him teaming with Johnny Devine in the tag division, but it ended when the Motor City Machine Guns were formed in 2007.\n\nHe and Chris Sabin would feud with the likes of Mick Foley, Team 3D and Beer Money while Shelley would pick up a reign as X-Division champion. They would finally win the Tag Team Championship in 2010, and after a great series of matches with Beer Money, they feuded with Generation Me until losing the belts to Beer Money.\n\nShelley would go down with an injury in January 2011 and upon his return in April, Sabin would tear an ACL which kept the Motor City Machine Guns down longer.\n\nShelley would reenter the X-Division afterwards, but after losing to Austin Aries in a quest to regain the title, he disappeared until this past April when the Motor City Machine Guns returned.\n\nThe reunion was short lived as Shelley would left TNA in May. You can currently see Alex Shelley on the independent circuit.\n\nDefeated: Suicide\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: June 25, 2009\n\nEvent: Impact\n\nTitle Reign: 52 days\n\nHomicide made his professional wrestling debut in 1993 as the Latin Terror. He would become Homicide in 1995 and found himself in Jersey All Pro Wrestling in 1997, a company which he still continues to appear for to this day.\n\nHe would capture the Heavyweight Championship once and the Tag Team Championship seven times during his multiple stints with the company. He debuted with Ring of Honor in 2002 on their first show and would have feuds with Steve Corino, Jay Lethal, Colt Cabana and was also the leader of the Rottweiler’s stable.\n\nHe would win the ROH World Championship in December 2006, and after losing the title, he would leave ROH in May 2007 when TNA pulled talent from shows.\n\nHe made his TNA debut in 2005 as a member of the Latin American Xchange with Konnan and Apolo. Apolo would soon be replaced by Machete, who was later replaced by Hernandez.\n\nAs a member of LAX, he would capture the NWA Tag Team Championship twice and the TNA Tag Team Championship once. He would also win the X-Division Championship while as a member of the team.\n\nIn September 2009, LAX would disband after Homicide turned on Hernandez and joined the World Elite. Homicide was a loose cannon, though, so the stable distanced themselves from him for the most part.\n\nHe would remain in the X-Division until he was released in August 2010.\n\nHomicide can currently be seen on the independent circuit and in Ring of Honor.\n\nDefeated: Shannon Moore and Homicide\n\nWhere: St. Louis, Mo.\n\nWhen: April 18, 2010\n\nEvent: Lockdown\n\nTitle Reign: 28 days\n\nAfter Homicide qualified to get into the match, Kazarian defeated him and Shannon Moore in a triple threat cage match to become the new champion.\n\nWhen Kazarian won the title, Douglas Williams was still in possession of it in England. When Williams was able to travel to the United States on April 29, he brought the title with him, but refused to give it to Kazarian because Kazarian never actually beat him.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Kazarian made his debut with TNA and began to immediately target this title. He would participate in the first Ultimate X match in a losing effort and then disappear in October.\n\nHe would return in March 2004 to wrestle for the vacant X-Division Championship and win his first of five titles there. He would lose the title in a little over two months and formed an alliance with Michael Shane as a result.\n\nHe would reclaim the title when he was declared a co-champion with Shane after they both grabbed the title in an Ultimate X match. After losing the title in a Gauntlet Match, they entered into the tag team division.\n\nThey would feud with the 3Live Kru and after losing to them, Kazarian left TNA for the WWE.\n\nKazarian made his WWE debut under his TNA name in 2005. He would wrestle on Velocity and remained undefeated until August. During that month, Kazarian would leave the WWE when it became obvious to him that the company wasn't serious about their cruiserweight division.\n\nHe returned to the independent circuit after that, most notably Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, until his TNA return in 2006.\n\nDefeated: Kazarian\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: May 16, 2010\n\nEvent: Sacrifice\n\nTitle Reign: 113 days\n\nDespite Douglas Williams having the title, Kazarian was the champion. So when Williams defeated Kazarian, he became the new champion.\n\nWilliams made his TNA Wrestling debut in 2003 but was used mostly on TNA's UK show Xplosion. It wasn't until 2008 when he signed a contract with the company and appeared on Team International in the World X Cup.\n\nWhen the tournament was finished, he was sparingly used until the debut of the British Invasion in April 2009. With Brutus Magnus as his partner and Rob Terry as the muscle, they made it to the finals of the Team 3D Invitational Tournament before being defeated by Beer Money.\n\nThey would interfere in the Tag Team Championship match between Beer Money and Team 3D and a feud with 3D began which would lead to them taking New Japan Pro Wrestling's IWGP Tag Team Championship away from the former Dudley Boyz.\n\nTNA would land in a bit of hot water due to the result since they didn't get NJPW's permission to crown new champions, but the Japanese promotion soon recognized the title change.\n\nAt Bound for Glory in October Team 3D would regain the IWGP belts, but Williams and Magnus would win the TNA Tag Team Championship in a Full Metal Mayhem Match that also featured Booker T and Scott Steiner and Beer Money.\n\nThey held the titles for three months before losing them to Matt Morgan and Hernandez. After the PPV, Rob Terry would win an X-Division Championship match from the Feast or Fired match but he would be forced by Williams and Magnus to give it to Williams.\n\nHe won the title as a result and would win it one more time as well after being stripped of the title. The British Invasion would disband during this and in August, Williams would become a member of Fortune, but tensions between him and former rival Kazarian, as well as other members, would cause him to get kicked out.\n\nHe would gain revenge, though, when he took the Television Championship away from AJ Styles in December. By this time, Fortune had joined Immortal, so when Styles was unable to compete at Genesis in January, he was replaced by Immortal member Abyss, who won the title.\n\nThe British Invasion would reunite in 2011, but they wouldn't find the same success they once had. They would disband when Magnus began to team with Samoa Joe.\n\nDouglas Williams is still with TNA, but doesn't get used as often as he should.\n\nDefeated: Jay Lethal\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: November 7, 2010\n\nEvent: Turning Point\n\nTitle Reign: 30 days\n\nRobbie E made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 in the Independent Wrestling Federation. He wrestled for the promotion as well as other various independent companies until he signed with TNA Wrestling in 2010.\n\nIn 2006, Robbie would make an appearance on WWE Raw in a skit with Edge. In the skit, the Rated R Superstar was impersonating Ric Flair and attacked Robbie.\n\nHe would make his TNA debut in October 2010 under the Robbie E character with his valet Cookie. Known as the Shore, they were parodies of the Jersey Shore reality show on MTV.\n\nHe quickly made his intentions known when he attacked X-Division champion Jay Lethal at Bound for Glory. After a confrontation with Jersey Shore’s JWoww, Robbie would win the X-Division Championship at Turning Point in November.\n\nHe would hold the title for a month before losing it back to Lethal on an episode of TNA Impact. He would remain in contention for the title, while also forming a short alliance with the Jersey Shore's Angelina Pivarnick, until breaking up with Cookie in August and forming a team with Rob Terry.\n\nNow with Robbie T, Robbie began to target the TNA Television Championship and champion Eric Young. The storyline led to another Jersey Shore cast member coming into TNA.\n\nYoung and Ronnie would defeat the Robbies in a tag team match in November, but a few weeks later Robbie would take the title away from Young. He disappeared from television after winning the title, making only the occasional appearance before his return in the following February..\n\nThen he began to issue open challenges for his title on a regular basis. At Victory Road in March, he would be defeated by Devon and the feud would continue until it was ended at Slammiversary.\n\nRobbie remains with TNA Wrestling and is currently in the Bound for Glory Series.\n\nDefeated: Jay Lethal\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: January 9, 2011\n\nEvent: Genesis\n\nTitle Reign: 127 days\n\nKazarian returned to TNA in July 2006 as just Kazarian and reformed his team with Michael Shane, who was now Matt Bentley. They would disappear after a few weeks, but then resurfaced as members of Raven's Serotonin.\n\nNow just Kaz, he rebelled against Raven and then turned on him in June 2007. He went solo once again, and earned a shot at Kurt Angle's World Heavyweight Championship. He almost won the title.\n\nHe would soon begin to team with Eric Young, who was appearing as Super Eric due to a storyline with Black Reign and Rellik. They would briefly win the Tag Team Championship before being stripped of the titles due to Super Eric appearing instead of Eric Young.\n\nHe continued on in the main event until he became the captain of Team USA in the 2008 World X Cup. They would lose the tournament and he would quit TNA as a result. He would return a few weeks later, though, as the masked Suicide.\n\nHe remained as the character until 2010 while also winning this title once. After coming back as himself, he went onto win the X-Division Championship two more times and become a member of Fortune with AJ Styles, Beer Money and later Christopher Daniels.\n\nFortune disbanded after Bound for Glory 2011, but Kazarian would remain aligned with Styles. He would turn on Styles, though, in December and align himself with Daniels.\n\nKazarian has been feuding with Styles ever since and is currently one-half of the tag team champions with Daniels, while also holding the belts one other time before the current reign.\n\nDefeated: Kazarian\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: May 16, 2011\n\nEvent: Impact Wrestling\n\nTitle Reign: 55 days\n\nAbyss made his professional wrestling debut in 1995 on the independent circuit, but he got his first big exposure wrestling in TNA's first show on June 19, 2002 as Justice.\n\nAbyss would first appear in Puerto Rico a month later before bringing the character to TNA in June 2003. Despite not winning a lot of championships, the Monster Abyss would go onto become one of TNA's most decorated stars.\n\nHis first title win came eight months after his debut with the Abyss character. He would capture the NWA Tag Team Championship with AJ Styles in February 2004, but the reign didn't last long. Styles was a face while Abyss was a heel and the two of them were enemies.\n\nSince they were rivals, it resulted in them not defending the title in 30 days, so they were stripped of the belts.\n\nTwo years later, Abyss would enter into a feud with Sting over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and he'd win the title in November 2006. He would only hold it for a month, and it would be five years until the Monster would win his next title.\n\nIn January 2011, Abyss would capture the Television Championship. A storyline injury would result in him getting stripped of the title, though.\n\nFour months later, Abyss would become a Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champion by winning the X-Division Championship. He would be TNA's fourth Triple Crown Champion and only second Grand Slam Champion.\n\nAbyss has been involved in some memorable storylines, such as his quest to destroy the X-Division, and memorable matches like his Barbed Wire Massacre match against Sabu in 2005. His Monster's Ball match against Bully Ray at Genesis this past January was also notable.\n\nAbyss is still with TNA as Joseph Park, Abyss' brother, in a storyline that sees Joseph look for Abyss and channel him at times as well.\n\nDefeated: Abyss\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: July 10, 2011\n\nEvent: Destination X\n\nTitle Reign: 63 days\n\nBrian Kendrick made his professional wrestling debut in 1999 on the independent circuit as Spanky. He signed with WWE in 2000 and was sent to Memphis Championship Wrestling. When the promotion was shot down by the end of the year, WWE released him from his contract.\n\nHe wrestled on the independent circuit as well as Ring of Honor and in Japan before resigning with WWE late in 2002.\n\nAfter wrestling under various masks on Velocity, he began to do stunts in an attempt to impress SmackDown general manager Stephanie McMahon—one such attempt was streaking backstage.\n\nAfter a short feud with John Cena, he began to team with Paul London. The team was short lived as Kendrick left WWE in January 2004.\n\nHe returned to the independent circuit afterwards and made appearances for Ring of Honor and TNA Wrestling as well. In August 2005, Kendrick made his return to the WWE and reformed his team with London.\n\nTheir ability and chemistry in the ring caught the eyes of the fans and they became popular with audiences. They were elevated to a feud with tag team champions MNM and began a winning streak over the champions.\n\nAt Judgment Day in May 2006, Kendrick and London would defeat MNM to win the titles. They would successfully defend the titles against all comers before finally losing them in April 2007.\n\nAt 331 days, their reign is the longest as champions and thus the current record.\n\nThey would remain in contention for the titles, while having a brief reign as world tag team champions, before disbanding in 2008 due to the draft.\n\nKendrick became The Brian Kendrick and the gimmick would see the debut of Ezekiel Jackson as his bodyguard and a shot at the WWE Championship in September at Unforgiven.\n\nFeaturing champion Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Shelton Benjamin and Montel Vontavious Porter, the match would see Kendrick become an interim WWE champion after he pinned Hardy, but he lost the distinction after Triple H pinned him.\n\nAfter being drafted to Raw and a few unsuccessful attempts at winning the tag titles back with different partners, he was released in July 2009.\n\nHe competed on the independent circuit until signing with TNA in 2010. He entered into the X-Division and competed for the title, finally winning it from Abyss at Destination X and saving the division from the Monster and Immortal.\n\nAfter losing the title to Austin Aries, Kendrick began to disappear from television and was finally released this past February.\n\nBrian Kendrick now competes in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nDefeated: Brian Kendrick\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: September 11, 2011\n\nEvent: No Surrender\n\nTitle Reign: 298 days\n\nThe title was declared vacant on July 8, 2012 when Aries gave it up for a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Even though the match was made weeks beforehand, Aries remained the champion until this date.\n\nAustin Aries made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 on the independent circuit. He continued on the independents until he joined Ring of Honor in 2004. By the end of the year, Aries would win the ROH World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Samoa Joe.\n\nAries would hold onto the title for six months before losing it to CM Punk in June 2005. He didn't let the loss drag him down, though, as he teamed with Roderick Strong to capture the ROH Tag Team Championship in December.\n\nThey kept the titles for almost a year, losing them in September 2006 to the King of Wrestling. He would continue to appear for ROH until 2007 when TNA pulled talent from their shows.\n\nAries had been wrestling for TNA since 2005 when he won an internet poll over Roderick Strong and Matt Sydal to see who fans wanted Christopher Daniels to defend his X-Division Championship against at Sacrifice.\n\nAries lost the match but remained in the X-Division for his two year stint. In 2006, he became Austin Starr and he continued to wrestle in the division until he was suspended in April 2007 and he asked for release as a result.\n\nHe returned to ROH in May and went back to Austin Aries. He would feud with his former partner Strong as well as members of the Age of the Fall stable before regaining the ROH world title in June 2009.\n\nAries would become the first and only wrestler to date to hold the title twice as a result.\n\nAfter a memorable draw in a 60-minute Iron Man match against Tyler Black in December, Aries would lose the title to Black in February 2010. Before leaving ROH by the end of 2010, Aries began to refer to himself as the \"Greatest Man That Ever Lived.\"\n\nHe debuted for Dragon's Gate USA in October and wrestled for them before his return to TNA in June 2011. During his time with DGUSA he would try out for the cast of WWE Tough Enough, but would fail to make the cast.\n\nAries would return to TNA by defeating Jimmy Rave and Kid Kash in a Destination X qualifying match. He then went onto the PPV to defeat Low Ki, Zema Ion and Jack Evans to earn a contract with TNA.\n\nAries immediately began to target this title and would win it in September. Aries would successfully defend his title against all comers, but he soon grew bored with defeating everyone in the X-Division saying that he was the greatest man that ever lived and that no one in the division could beat him.\n\nBefore Destination X last month, Hulk Hogan offered to vacate the X-Division Championship in exchange for giving him a shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Aries agreed and gave up the title.\n\nHe then went on to defeat Bobby Roode to win the world title. Aries remains the world champion, but will be defending it this Sunday at Hardcore Justice against Roode.\n\nDefeated: Sonjay Dutt, Kenny King and Mason Andrews\n\nWhere: Orlando, Fla.\n\nWhen: July 8, 2012\n\nEvent: Destination X\n\nTitle Reign: 30 days and counting\n\nAfter all four men qualified to enter, Zema Ion defeated the other three in Ultimate X28 to become the new champion.\n\nZema Ion made his professional wrestling debut in 2004 as Shiima Ion on the independent circuit.\n\nAt the time, he found himself in the International Wrestling Cartel where he captured the IWC Super Indy Championship twice, the IWC Tag Team Championship twice with Jason Gordy, and the World Heavyweight Championship twice as well.\n\nHe stayed with them until 2008 when he debuted with Desastre Total Ultraviolento in Mexico for a year. In 2009, he stayed in Mexico but began wrestling for AAA. He wrestled for them until 2010 and returned to the independents until his TNA debut in June 2011 as Zema Ion.\n\nHe defeated Dakota Darsow and Federico Palacios to qualify for a contract match at Destination X. He would lose the fatal four-way to Austin Aries, but he would get signed anyway.\n\nHe was used sparingly until this past February when he faced Jesse Sorenson in a No. 1 contender’s match. In the match, Ion would perform a moonsault to the outside that saw his knee connect hard with Sorenson's head, breaking his neck.\n\nHe would become a definite heel due to what happened and received two title shots against Aries. He would lose both, but stayed in the title hunt.\n\nIt wasn't until Aries vacated the title that Ion really had a chance at winning it. At Destination X, Ion would defeat Flip Cassanova in the first round of a tournament to crown the new champion and then defeated Sonjay Dutt, Kenny King and Mason Andrews in an Ultimate X match to become the new champion.\n\nZema Ion obviously remains as champion and will be defending it this Sunday at Hardcore Justice against Kenny King.\n\nMost Reigns: AJ Styles and Jay Lethal (6 each)\n\nLongest Reign: Austin Aries (298 days)\n\nLongest Combined Reign: Chris Sabin (4 reigns totaling 338 days) or Kazarian (five reigns at 341 days if you count his reign under the mask of Suicide)\n\nShortest Reign: Eric Young (a few minutes)\n\nTNA was first brought to my attention in November 2003 when I read that Sting was going to appear for a company called NWA-TNA in a tag team match with someone named AJ Styles against Jeff Jarrett and Lex Luger. It was back when TNA was having weekly pay-per-views and since Sting has always been one of my favorite wrestlers, I decided to order the show.\n\nAs I watched the event, I saw my first glimpses of the Monster Abyss, James Storm, CM Punk, Sonjay Dutt as well two ECW legends in Raven and the Sandman. While I ordered the event in order to watch Sting, I stuck around, ordering more and more due to the performance of AJ Styles and a great X-Division match between Christopher Daniels and Low Ki.\n\nIt was the X-Division that kept me coming back for more as I was introduced to great talent like Michael Shane, Chris Sabin, Amazing Red, Kazarian, Petey Williams and so many more.\n\nX-Division matches were some of the most exciting matches I have ever seen and while names like Sting and Jarrett were around and guys like Kevin Nash and Diamond Dallas Page would come in, my favorite part of each show was always the X-Division.\n\nThe division is not what it used to be, though. It went from being huge to featuring only a few wrestlers at a time. The spotlight is not on the division like it once was, but the men in it are still putting on exciting matches.\n\nWhile I would like to see the X-Division go back to what it once was, I don't think it ever will. As long as TNA doesn't scrap the division and the title, though, I'll be happy.\n\nThanks for reading! Next up will be the WWE Intercontinental Championship. The title will have to be split into two, though, due to it seeing 136 champions over the years.\n\nPart one of the WWE Intercontinental Championship will be up as soon as its finished.\n\nPrevious Installments\n\nSources\n\nInformation on the wrestlers provided by Wikipedia\n\nTitle “Wrestling Gold” thought up by editor Jeff D.
