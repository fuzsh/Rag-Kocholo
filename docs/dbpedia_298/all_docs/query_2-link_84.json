However, this material would only get me so far. In the last twenty years the Internet has become a universal library for new and archived material. It has helped me enormously in compiling this book. I would particularly like to call out the following websites as having been invaluable in my research: Mark Kenyon’s The Genesis Archive is a superb noncommercial site hosting a massive collection of material about the band, including music press and magazine articles, press kits, video and audio material and fan submitted memorabilia. It is the “go to” resource for any serious Genesis fan. Mark has been very generous in donating his time and sharing some of his collection for use in this book. Alan Hewitt’s The Waiting Room, set up in 1987, is a dedicated fan’s ­long-standing project and includes personal interviews with band members alongside articles, reviews and opinion. Phil Collins is an avid follower. Dave Negrin’s The World of Genesis contains an archive of excellent interviews that Dave has conducted with band members and technical crew over the years. Michael Poloukhine’s A Genesis Discography is a comprehensive catalogue of the band’s worldwide releases. There are many others. Where I have quoted from web or archive material to highlight specific points in the text, I have annotated the source in the chapter notes. I have also listed the key published works on the band as well as a selection of web resources in the section. I’d also like to thank David Alff, editor at McFarland, for his advice and support as well as sharing his personal photographs of the band and allowing their use in this book. Finally, my biggest thanks go to the band themselves—Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Anthony Phillips, Ray Wilson, John Mayhew, John Silver and Chris Stewart—for their inspiration, wonderful music and for being a huge part of my life.\n\nvi\n\nTable of Contents Acknowledgmentsvi Preface1 Introduction: From Charterhouse to Chart Toppers3 Notes on Cataloguing11\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970 1.

That’s always going to be a special place for us; it’s where we create our music.”1 —Mike Rutherford “We’ve always liked something to be distinctive about a song, even a simple song. There is usually an element of quirkiness about a Genesis song and that’s important to us.”2 —Tony Banks “A lot of our older fans think that Genesis should be a brand name for progressive rock or whatever. But actually, Genesis is the name for a group of songwriters who have always done whatever we’ve felt like doing under that banner”3 —Phil Collins “Nobody knew for certain, least of all us writers, where a song, once started, would end up—the democratic writing process open to a ­five-sided team was able to combine influences from science fiction to Greek mythology.”4 —Steve Hackett “I think when we got it right, we had something that none of us could do on our own. And there were different musical histories merging together in a powerful way.”5 —Peter Gabriel\n\nPreface The songs of Genesis have been a huge part of my life, and this book is designed to tell the story behind each and every one of them. The book catalogues chronologically all the band’s songs from their earliest demos in 1967 through to their last studio recording in 1997—a period of thirty years which saw Genesis progress from its schoolboy band origins into one of the biggest rock acts in the world. As well as offering opinions on each of the band’s songs I provide background information on the recordings based on extensive research of archive material. Along the way I contrast my views with those of the band members themselves and of the music press, who in the ­post-punk days would often snub their noses at the mere mention of Genesis. I first took notice of Genesis in the summer of 1980 when I heard the song [106] Duchess on the radio. I loved the melodic chorus and the drama of the music. I bought the single and played it to death on my dad’s B&O turntable. Before this I had been familiar with the band but had not paid their music any close attention. I had liked the single [102] Follow You, Follow Me, but at the time I was into the disco strains of Earth, Wind & Fire, Michael Jackson and the soul of Stevie Wonder. I had grown up listening to and loving The Beatles and then the glam rock of the early 1970s. My dad had liked some of the fusion of jazz and rock evident in prog bands like Focus and Camel and he had mentioned Genesis as a band that I might like. By 1980, Genesis had adopted a more commercial approach to their music, while retaining the signature elements that made the band unique. Now was the time to explore their music further. I bought the album, Duke, and loved it. I worked my way backward through their catalogue and was amazed by the progressive nature of the band’s musical development. I very quickly became a fan. From then on Genesis became a big part of my life. My favorite band. As well as their albums, singles and videos I began collecting magazine and music press articles, reviews and books. I also videotaped their TV appearances and documentaries. I joined the fan club, Genesis Information. In the late 1990s, the arrival of the internet enabled me to obtain more and more information and I absorbed it to such an extent that I needed an outlet to get it all back out. This book is that outlet. To use a cliché, the book is “a labor of love.” It is something I started writing way back in 1998. I originally finished it two or three years later. Over the years I added to and honed the material and then…. I parked it. I went on to other things. Now, more than twenty years later I have finally fulfilled my vision of providing a complete guide to the songs of Genesis. A major inspiration was Ian MacDonald’s Revolution in the Head: The Beatles Records and the Sixties, originally written in 1994 and now in its third edition, published by Vintage. I found MacDonald’s observations of the Fab Four’s song output to be fascinating. I didn’t always agree with his assessments, but his views were clearly and knowledgeably presented. 1\n\n2 Preface The book is still my g­ o-to reference for the music of The Beatles. MacDonald catalogued the songs in the order they were recorded, and I have adapted a similar cataloguing system for this book. While I have musical experience, having played in a rock band for seventeen years, I am not a music scholar and could never emulate MacDonald’s studied approach to his subject. However, I hope my enthusiasm for the music and my honest personal assessments will encourage readers to listen to the songs of Genesis with fresh ears. I am also hoping the book will introduce an extraordinary catalogue of songs to a new generation. My aim is to provide a balanced critique of the band’s music as well as the stories behind the songs. It is unashamedly my point of view, for I have no other. It is not just the view of a Genesis fan, but also that of a music fan. My tastes are quite diverse, but for me Genesis sit at the top of the tree. That doesn’t mean to say that I think everything the band wrote and recorded was wonderful and that this book is a eulogy. In such a large and experimental body of music there are inevitably songs which do not work, whether that be musically, lyrically or conceptually. For example, many see [44] The Battle of Epping Forest as a great marriage of Peter Gabriel’s whimsical storytelling and the band’s intricate musical arrangement. I find it a bit of an ­ill-matched mess. However, one view that is almost unanimous among commentators on the band’s output is that you’ll have to go a mighty long way to find a better piece of music in the history of rock music than their epic [38] Supper’s Ready. My main challenge in writing this book was scope. Genesis have a huge output of material both as a band and individually, meaning that to cover it all would be a mammoth task. After all it has taken me twenty years to get to this point! I therefore decided to just focus on the band and leave the solo output for another day. I also decided to catalogue the songs based on their studio recordings. That is all the albums and singles, as well as archival demos. Many of Genesis’ songs would benefit further from the live environment—songs like [46] The Cinema Show, [42] Firth of Fifth and [148] Domino really came alive on stage. These live versions are not separately catalogued; instead, I have made a reference to them in the text covering each studio entry. While I provide a history of the band alongside the song entries for context, this book is not designed to be a definitive biography. I wanted to concentrate on the music. For those seeking a detailed history of the band I would refer you to Armando Gallo’s excellent I Know What I Like and the band’s own Chapter & Verse, both of which are detailed among others in the Bibliography. Genesis tell us the well has run dry on their archive of material. Having released two Archive box sets and their full studio output in a further three ­career-spanning box sets, the band has certainly made the effort to give their fans everything they have. We probably now have access to a recording of every song that is available. It is also highly unlikely Genesis will produce any new music in the future. The last batch of new songs written and recorded by the band is now more than 20 years old. Phil Collins can no longer play drums and due to health issues is confined to a seat for most of his current live show. The official statement from the band is “never say never,” but as the band members age the likelihood that they will ever record together again becomes increasingly remote. The time is therefore right to celebrate the music of one of the most original bands in rock music history.\n\nIntroduction: From Charterhouse to Chart Toppers Genesis have always sat outside of music fashions. Even when they were conquering the world with their Invisible Touch album in 1986, they did so while retaining an uncool image. The band let their music do the talking. Genesis was not about egos, pretty images, fashionable clothes and haircuts. The music is what mattered. Even in the heady heyday of progressive rock they remained songwriters first and foremost. While Yes, ELP and the like would be about the playing and technique, Genesis concentrated on song structure, dynamics and arrangement. They had set themselves up initially as a songwriting collective, looking for others to cover their material. When they could find no takers, they became a band intent on promoting their own songs. From 1969, freed of Jonathan King’s desire to shape them into a pop band, they experimented with the song format. Their material moved away from the ­three-minute traditional ­verse-chorus-bridge structure to something much more experimental. Songs would link musical themes and passages into a whole that would move between changing moods and time signatures. This approach culminated in their ­23-minute masterpiece [38] Supper’s Ready. By the time they got to 1976’s album Wind & Wuthering the music scene was changing with the advent of punk followed by new wave. Genesis astutely realized they would not survive in an environment that took music back to its raw roots and said anyone can stand up and play. Genesis resolved to simplify their songwriting. As they shed members, the band’s music became less complex and increasingly more structured around traditional form, while their lyrics moved from storytelling and fantasy to affairs of the heart and mind. As Genesis evolved, they lost some fans and gained many more new ones. By 1986, they had reached a peak of popularity that took them to being one of the top concert draws in the world. They remained at the top until Phil Collins’ departure in 1996. A failed attempt to relaunch the band with new lead singer Ray Wilson spelled the end of Genesis as a recording unit. However, their 2007 reunion tour demonstrated that the band’s music has outlasted them and has a timeless quality about it that has led to a reassessment of their contribution to popular music.\n\nEvolution The roots of Genesis were laid down by the evolving music scene of the mid to late 1960s. The decade saw an explosion in popular music unlike any witnessed before. The rock 3\n\n4 Introduction ’n’ roll bands that had emerged during the 1950s had caused excitement by fusing elements of blues and jazz with melody and structure. The early 1960s saw further evolution and in Britain bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who led the way. In the United States, the soul hits of Motown and the slick pop harmonies of The Beach Boys dominated the airwaves. The music produced was fresh and original, expanding on the m ­ elody-driven song format to produce something fresh and innovative. The new music lit a fire in the baby boomers that would burn eternal and these g­ round-breaking bands and artists would inspire a new generation of musicians. Social culture was evolving too with the constraints of postwar Britain being replaced by a new period of optimism. The new generation suddenly had freedom to express themselves creatively and hope that they died before they got old. The music scene continued to evolve and develop with artists exploring new territories of sound and composition. The Beach Boys’ innovative use of recording techniques on their Pet Sounds album of May 1966 was a major influence on The Beatles, who took the approach to the next level with Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in June 1967. These experiments inspired others to explore new musical ideas and formats. Fueled by the drugs of the day, LSD being the most notable newcomer, the psychedelic music of the early Pink Floyd, The Doors, The Zombies, et al. pushed at the boundaries of song structure and instrumentation. Out of the psychedelic scene emerged bands willing to stretch musicianship, arrangement and song structures. The Nice, The Moody Blues, Family, Fairport Convention and Procol Harum introduced increasingly elaborate orchestration and folk elements into their music. The instrumentalist rather than the song would become the center of attention—the ­passion-fueled guitar work of Jimi Hendrix and the dynamic keyboard playing of The Nice’s Keith Emerson being prime examples. Other bands began to emerge, with ELP (led by Emerson with bassist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer), Jethro Tull, Yes, Van Der Graaf Generator and King Crimson all forming during this time. It was King Crimson’s album In the Court of the Crimson King that became the template for what was to be termed “progressive rock” with its use of the Mellotron expanding the musical landscape with its orchestral simulation. While in the early 1970s, Genesis was to become synonymous with the progressive rock genre, the band had started out in the mid–1960s as two pairs of songwriters nurturing their talent in the restrictive culture of a public school—Charterhouse, an a­ ll-male boarding school at that. This was not an environment associated with rock ’n’ roll. The first pair was Anthony Phillips and Mike Rutherford, two guitarists with a liking for The Rolling Stones. The second pair was Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel, who were more inspired by the soul of Otis Redding and Nina Simone. Their early songwriting was aimed at creating a pop sound that captured the spirit of these inspirations as well as the emerging folk scene. The songs were derivative and lacking in hooks, but there was enough in them to impress Charterhouse old boy turned pop star and producer Jonathan King. He recorded two singles and an album with the band while they were still at school. Neither the singles nor the album were successful. The members of Genesis are renowned for their b ­ loody-mindedness and they resolved to go their own way and explore new musical territories to find a niche for themselves. All the band members were fans of The Beatles and had been impressed by the Fab Four’s increasingly elaborate exploration of musical boundaries. The young men were also keen followers of the music scene in London and were particularly impressed by The Nice. Tony Banks was a huge fan of Keith Emerson and the band were amazed by The Nice’s live energy. Initially the quartet of writers had been looking to set up a publishing deal for their songs to be performed by other artists—something that was inspired by the team of writers\n\nFrom Charterhouse to Chart Toppers5\n\nin Tin Pan Alley who churned out hits for major artists. But in the late 1960s, by following in the footsteps of their heroes, more and more bands began to write and perform their own material. So, Genesis became a fully fledged band and started to write and hone their songs on the road. The result was a more experimental approach to composition, with ideas being pooled and pieced together to create more complex and longer songs. Genesis were signed up by Tony S­ tratton-Smith for Charisma and in 1970 recorded what they regard as their first “real” album, Trespass. From here on they would be categorized as part of the progressive rock movement, if in a lesser light than many of their peers. The growth of Genesis as a band would be a slow and steady one—one that would see them gain increased popularity with each album, all the way through to their commercial peak in the mid–1980s.\n\nThe River of Constant Change Genesis’ growth in popularity was coupled with a musical development that ensured the band retained its following through various changes in the musical climate. This level of resilience and adaptability is the secret of their longevity. Had Genesis continued to record music in the style of their early albums they would have disappeared in the punk revolution of the mid–1970s along with most of their contemporaries. Instead, the band adapted through contracting lineups and the evolving musical environment. This has had the result of polarizing fan opinion into two camps—those who love the early progressive approach with Peter Gabriel as lead singer and those who love the later, more pop orientated band, with Phil Collins as lead singer. Positions were largely established by the point at which fans came on board. Banks, Collins and Rutherford are consistent in explaining their evolution was a result of their changing tastes. It’s a statement that makes sense when we look back at our own lives. For any band to survive for the length of time Genesis did, they had to remain interested and challenged by what they were creating. If the listener was to play the band’s catalogue in sequence, then they would see a gradual and natural evolution from 1970’s Trespass to 1991’s We Can’t Dance. If the listener was to play these two albums back to back, then they would be ­hard-pressed to conceive it was the same band. In reality, this wasn’t physically the same band. Only two of the five Genesis members that recorded Trespass were involved with We Can’t Dance, but all three who recorded We Can’t Dance were involved in Trespass’s 1971 ­follow-up Nursery Cryme. The loss of lead singer Peter Gabriel in 1975 and guitarist Steve Hackett in 1977 reduced the lineup to its core elements of Tony Banks’ keyboards, Mike Rutherford’s bass and guitar and Phil Collins’ drums and vocals. Banks’ skill with harmony, Rutherford’s craft with a tune and Collins’ innovative rhythms and melodic sensibilities were perfectly matched to create a blend that none of them could create on their own. What Genesis lost with Peter Gabriel’s departure was the singer’s surreal approach to lyrics, his mysterious persona and his musical experimentation, while in guitarist Steve Hackett they lost an innovator in sound and technique. That Genesis’ music would become more structured as a result again seems natural. A Trick of the Tail, the album that followed Gabriel’s departure, was the most ­song-orientated they had produced to date. …And Then There Were Three…, the album that followed Hackett’s departure, eschewed the longer song format and simplified the sound. On reflection, there are probably only three points in their career where Genesis made a conscious decision to shift their musical path. The first of these was their recording in 1974 of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. This album is musically very different from\n\n6 Introduction those that preceded it: Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England by the Pound. Those four albums had mixed expansive epics with the acoustic and the electric through changing moods and little musical repetition. [22] Stagnation, [25] The Musical Box, [31] The Fountain of Salmacis, [40] Dancing with the Moonlit Knight, [42] Firth of Fifth and [46] The Cinema Show are all considered classics of the band’s catalogue. The ­23-minute [38] Supper’s Ready, which appeared on Foxtrot, is probably the pinnacle of the band’s career. It is a suite of seven separate songs linked thematically and musically. The pieces were literally stitched together in the studio to produce an astonishingly dynamic whole, climaxing via the twisting instrumental “Apocalypse in 9/8” with the celebration of “As Sure as Eggs Is Eggs.” These songs would be mixed with more whimsical content such as their first pop hit, [41] I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe). While the approach was far from formulaic, the band did not want to rest on their laurels. With The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway they explored the concept of a double album with a single story running through ­twenty-two shorter and contrasting pieces. While the concept was dense and the story almost impenetrable, the individual songs were largely concise. [48] The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, [54] Back in N.Y.C., [57] Carpet Crawlers and [56] Counting Out Time all had a more ­straight-ahead rock approach, while retaining the band’s personality. Songs such as [52] In the Cage and [65] The Colony of Slippermen still allowed Genesis to stretch out more in terms of structure and complexity, but the band had undoubtedly made a big statement. Having reached this point, Gabriel could see no future for himself in the band—regarding the album as the limit to which he could exert his influence on its output. He had written all the lyrics and felt suffocated by the band’s rigidity around ownership of instrumentation. Family problems and the desire to artistically spread his wings led to him leaving the band in 1975, at the end of the tour to support the album. With license to fully explore his own ideas, he would go on to establish a successful career both artistically and commercially. Genesis’ search for a replacement was deemed redundant when they realized the logical choice was already within their ranks. Phil Collins had always sung harmony vocal to Gabriel and the pair had often d ­ oubled-up on lead. While the music press was keen to write the band off under the misconception that Gabriel had been their creative core, the band was writing and recording what was to prove to be an assured first album as a quartet—A Trick of the Tail. As on The Lamb the songs were more straightforward and demonstrated a band full of confidence and ideas. Collins’ influence on the composition and arrangement was evident on the jazzy and ­Latin-infused instrumental [78] Los Endos, while Banks and Rutherford demonstrated how their unique chemistry fused their musical ideas with [73] Squonk and the gorgeous [76] Ripples…. Hackett by now had released his first solo album, Voyage of the Acolyte, and was hungry for more. He, too, was developing a desire to stretch out on his own. After one more album with the band, 1976’s Wind & Wuthering, he left during the mixing of the subsequent live album, 1977’s Seconds Out. This brings us to the second conscious change in musical direction, with the remaining trio’s first album, …And Then There Were Three…, in 1978. Here the band resolved to write a collection of shorter songs, dispensing with any long instrumental passages. At this stage they hadn’t refined their craft sufficiently and many of these shorter songs felt either overstuffed or inconsequential. The songs also missed Steve Hackett’s sonic creativity, with Rutherford’s lead guitar parts being rather simplistic and lacking any distinction. This was overcompensated by Banks’ keyboards taking on a much greater lead role than ever before. The result was an album lacking in the variety they had striven in creating room for more songs. However, they did have one gem up their sleeve.\n\nFrom Charterhouse to Chart Toppers7\n\n[102] Follow You, Follow Me was nearly left off the album—disliked by producer David Hentschel, with the band also feeling the song was too simplistic. The record company, however, liked it and saw the potential in its love song lyrics, simple melody and relaxing rhythms. The song was released as a single and became a top ten hit in the UK. Suddenly, Genesis began attracting females to their shows and their audience was now growing beyond their core fan base. The band redressed the inconsistencies seen on …And Then There Were Three… with 1980s confident and energetic Duke. Here, they achieved the perfect marriage between the fusion side of the band and their increased desire for simplicity. Their first use of a drum machine, on [106] Duchess, would help them keep their writing more concise—something they would go on to explore further. The third conscious change in direction came with the 1981 album Abacab. Punk had evolved into new wave. Bands such as The Police, Blondie and Talking Heads emerged out of the punk scene and added back the artistry punk had stripped from popular music, without reintroducing the pomposity punk had eradicated. The result was a cornucopia of styles incorporating the aggressive attitude of punk with the rhythms of reggae and the melodicity of pop. Bands began to integrate an electronic sound based around ­keyboard-led hooks, evident in pioneering artists such as Kraftwerk, Gary Numan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. Also, during this period, Phil Collins had a huge hit with his debut solo album, Face Value. Its diverse content of soul, jazz and pop was a huge surprise to the music press, who had taken against bands like Genesis as the antithesis of the new era of popular music. Collins’ debut single, “In the Air Tonight,” was fresh and innovative in its sparse instrumentation with its huge drum sound. Collins had ironically initially developed this new sound with engineer Hugh Padgham while working with former band mate Peter Gabriel on the song “Intruder” for Gabriel’s third album. Genesis wisely saw that producing another album in the style they had become identified with would see them lose momentum. The band could simply not survive without changing. The trio resolved to make the music on Abacab different from anything they had recorded before. They would throw out any song in which they felt they were repeating themselves. There would be no extensive keyboard solos. The drums would be brought up in the mix. They would simplify the song format and keep the arrangements sparse. By this time, they had also bought their own studio and were able to record as they wrote, removing the need to book studio time and be restricted by cost. They employed Hugh Padgham as their engineer, replacing David Hentschel, who had worked with the band as c­ o-producer/engineer since A Trick of the Tail. The result was a fresh sounding album that would polarize their fans more than any before. The older fans, who wanted the band to carry on producing ­10-minute epics with changing moods and long instrumental sections, were shocked by the new wave sensibilities the band had adopted for their new material. The pulsing rhythm of [119] Abacab, the repetitive guitar riff of [122] Keep It Dark, the tuneless throwaway [125] Who Dunnit? all demonstrated a band unwilling to compromise. Genesis brought in the Earth, Wind & Fire horn section (who had played on Collins’ Face Value) to play on two tracks in the sessions—the first time the band had used outside musicians since their 1969 debut. They wrote almost all the songs together, with only three individually written tracks recorded— all their future albums would see all tracks c­ o-written by the trio from scratch. Tony Banks restricted his keyboard orchestration and use of harmonies. Mike Rutherford used his guitar more creatively, looping the lead guitar riff for Keep It Dark and broadening his sonic tableau on [128] Another Record. From here it was apparent Genesis was not the band of 1972, 1975 or even 1978. The\n\n8 Introduction band had evolved and changed with the times to remain relevant but still retained a distinctiveness that set them apart from their contemporaries. Many older fans blamed Phil Collins and his solo success, claiming he had changed the band. This view is both incorrect and missing the point. The band’s change of direction is something all three members pushed for to challenge themselves musically. Abacab certainly took this approach to the extreme and proved to be largely experimental, with the trio exploring how far they could comfortably go. Subsequent albums would see a slight redress in balance between simple song structures and more complex pieces. Genesis attracted new fans as a result, building up their audience with Abacab’s ­follow-up, Genesis, with its mix of short pop songs ([135] That’s All, [138] Illegal Alien), longer pieces ([136/137] Home by the Sea/Second Home by the Sea) and innovation ([134] Mama). Genesis undoubtedly reached their commercial peak with 1986’s Invisible Touch. By now, Phil Collins had established himself as a major solo star and was alternating his solo and band career—as were Banks and Rutherford, the latter having s­ et-up his own side project band in Mike + The Mechanics. Invisible Touch would see the band at their most confident and assured. The album was a monster hit and it was not unreasonable to consider Genesis the biggest concert draw in the world at that time—with four ­sold-out nights at Wembley Stadium in 1987 evidence of their popularity. The band had incorporated the synth sounds of the day with electronic drums to create an album that was their closest ever to the current musical fashions. As such, in some ways, it is now probably their most dated sounding album p ­ roduction-wise. However, Genesis still managed to retain their musical identity with more challenging songs such as [148] Domino and [150] The Brazilian mixing with the hits. Phil Collins’ solo work was now beginning to take increasing precedence with a film career also under way. Banks and Rutherford even managed to record two albums each during the hiatus between Invisible Touch and We Can’t Dance. The synth pop of the 1980s had given way to the more AOR ­rock-oriented sounds of the early 1990s. The trio would release what was to be their final album as a unit in competition with U2’s Achtung Baby and Michael Jackson’s Dangerous. We Can’t Dance confirmed that Genesis’ popularity remained just as strong while returning the band to a more organic sound—the synthetic productions of the mid–1980s now seeming somewhat passé. The CD format meant We Can’t Dance included over 70 minutes of material and while the songs were ­well-crafted there were fewer moments that would surprise the listener. There was also a feeling of finality about the album. The closing ­ten-minute [165] Fading Lights seemed to be the perfect song with which to say goodbye, with Banks deliberately closing his lyric with the word remember. That said, there was nothing being said within the band that suggested they would not regroup for another album in a few years’ time. Their tour was hugely successful and stretched into late 1992 and two live albums followed. Behind the scenes, however, things began to change in Phil Collins’ life. A bitter divorce played out in the media in 1994 and lost the singer some of the popular support he had enjoyed over the previous thirteen years. He established a new relationship which took him to Switzerland. Finally deciding that juggling solo and band careers was no longer conducive with a domestic family life in Switzerland, in June 1996 it was announced Collins would leave Genesis. Banks and Rutherford regrouped to write new songs together and see how things progressed. They produced a vast amount of material and agreed to carry on the Genesis name with a new singer, Scotsman Ray Wilson, who had been lead singer with grunge band Stiltskin—famous for the hit “Inside.” The result was …Calling All Stations…, released in 1997. By now the musical landscape had changed dramatically. Grunge had taken hold in\n\nFrom Charterhouse to Chart Toppers9\n\nthe U.S. with bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden taking rock back to its exciting guitar driven roots, In the UK, indie bands such as Blur and Oasis looked backward to the vibe of the 1960s and mingled it with the sounds of the 1990s to produce what would be termed Britpop. Genesis’ latest release seemed to suggest the band were stuck in a musical vacuum. Missing Collins’ ear for simplicity and melody and his soulful vocal delivery, the music was dense and lacked heart. The songs were caught between a desire for a darker, more complex approach and the need to maintain the hits. The resulting album left fans of both the Gabriel and Collins eras largely cold and failed to bring in any new supporters. This was most startling in the United States, where the album disappeared without a trace and a planned tour was cancelled. The album was better received in the UK and Europe, but Banks and Rutherford’s heart had gone out of the project. That is a shame as there were moments on the album that pointed toward a new direction—notably driving songs such as [174] The Dividing Line and the title track [168]. But there was no disguising that to many this was no longer Genesis.\n\nLegacy The ­modern-day music critic cites 1971–1975 as the classic Genesis period. A young band of five highly creative individuals pushing musical boundaries into new directions. It is hard to argue against a view that the band was at its creative peak during this period. Selling England by the Pound and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway are the albums most music journalists signal as their best—both are listed in Robert Dimery’s annual collection of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (Cassell). Even today’s music fans in general hold this era in more reverence. The ­All-Music Guide only rates these two albums and Foxtrot with 5 stars—the highest rated post–Gabriel albums being A Trick of the Tail and Abacab with 4½ stars (the latter being the only 1980s album rated above 4 stars). The website ­Rate-Your-Music also shows Selling England by the Pound, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Foxtrot as the band’s highest rated. The musical chemistry between Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford helped create a unique sound and style that was distinguishable from peers such as Yes, Pink Floyd and ELP. Genesis were always about the songs and while they employed musical technique, it would always be to the benefit of the composition and not to show off their musical technique as players. Outside of The Beatles, there is no other band that has ever had the breadth of songwriting capabilities Genesis had during this period. Even the Fab Four were largely reliant on Lennon and McCartney, with Harrison only increasing his output in the latter days. The fact that there have been successful solo careers for at least four of the five members of the band is testament to their individual talents. Ironically, only Tony Banks—who most consider to be the heart of Genesis—has failed to have any l­arge-scale success outside of it. It seems hard to believe that the band were only 21 years old when they wrote their masterpiece Supper’s Ready. In today’s immediacy driven society with its manufactured approach to popular music it is hard to imagine a band so young ever producing a piece of work so innovative again. What the band had during this period was a group of individuals with a shared vision and the drive to achieve it. On their first album together, 1971’s Nursery Cryme, the ­five-piece unit sowed the seeds with the album’s opening track [25] The Musical Box. Its blend of acoustic guitar; changing moods and tempo; a driving electric guitar led midsection; and its climactic resolution as Tony Banks’ organ chords heighten the\n\n10 Introduction drama played out by Gabriel’s surreal lyrics. The song signaled the way forward for the band. [38] Supper’s Ready on Foxtrot was the culmination of this thinking. The band’s sound was further refined on Selling England by the Pound with John Burns a more sympathetic producer/engineer and a further expansion of their sound through keyboard synthesizers. Many fans and critics would argue Genesis’ musical creativity reached its peak on The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. It was an album of such depth and range that it was hard to take in on its initial release. It baffled contemporary critics—even ardent supporters in the music press such as Chris Welch were bemused. Gabriel’s story was full of imagery but left most listeners scratching their heads. So, why is it now regarded as a classic? It was certainly ahead of its time. There is a ­pre-punk energy to the central character of Rael, and it is very different from any other album they recorded. The band selected [57] Carpet Crawlers as the encore for their 2007 reunion, citing it as the song that best encapsulated their history. Like most of their albums, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway has its moments of padding, but it remains perhaps the best distillation of their combined talent. Once Gabriel had gone and Phil Collins had replaced him (again how many bands can claim to have matched Genesis for the level of success they achieved with two lead singers?), the band maximized the skills from the remaining members. Hackett’s contributions to both A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering were among his best. Down to the core trio of Banks, Collins and Rutherford from 1978 the members honed their songwriting skills and went on to produce a string of hits, their staggering commercial success peaking with the three albums over the period 1983–1991: Genesis, Invisible Touch and We Can’t Dance. The critics had pretty much abandoned the band with the advent of punk and, despite (or maybe because of) their growing popularity and Phil Collins’ ascending star, their albums failed to garner the critical approval they had in their earlier years. Genesis were never fashionable, with a snobbish music press sharpening their knives with greater intent as the band grew in popularity. Genesis were branded as ageing dinosaurs or charged as safe corporate rockers only in it for the money—their ­middle-class upbringing at odds with the ­working-class roots of most of the current bands. These criticisms were grossly unfair and did not reflect the band’s willingness to take risks through experimentation, whether it be in composition, recording techniques or stage and lighting design. Genesis never played it safe. No two albums in their catalogue sound alike. The band’s last recorded album, …Calling All Stations…, was released in 1997—more than twenty years ago. Genesis’ influence on modern music goes largely unrecognized by the critics, but not so by artists such as Radiohead, Rush, Phish and Elbow, who cite them as a key influence. The band has sold between 100 million and 150 million albums around the world and in March 2010 was finally inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The breadth of the band’s career and output will always give rise to debate and argument, but no one can deny that Genesis and its individual members have left an indelible mark on popular music.\n\nNotes on Cataloguing The following is an account of the official studio recordings of Genesis catalogued by song. When I use the word “official” I am referring to those recordings sanctioned by the band. These include Genesis’ early singles and debut album, From Genesis to Revelation, which were recorded for Decca with the rights still held by Jonjo Music. In the UK, the remainder of the band’s output is now licensed by Virgin/EMI and published through Hit & Run Music. My core guiding principle for the cataloguing is the band’s UK discography, but I have also referenced U.S. releases of each studio album and single, which are licensed through Atlantic/Rhino Records. I have not catalogued the band’s live recordings, as this would overcomplicate things. Instead, I have referenced these recordings in the individual studio entry for the song, with notes around venue, song length and the live album or archive release the live version of the song is available on. The band’s live albums and archive material are also listed in the Discography section. For ease of reference I have used a numerical system to catalogue all officially released songs that appear on the band’s studio albums, EPs and/or singles as well as later archive releases. The numbering starts at [1] for the band’s first single, The Silent Sun, and ends at [186] for the band’s last single, The Carpet Crawlers 1999. The sequencing is based on the dates recorded from the earliest to latest. Where numerous songs were recorded for an album during dedicated sessions, the track sequencing or subsequent release date as a ­B-side single has been used as the ordering determinant. As the band has released a vast amount of archive material in recent years, many demo or session recordings have become officially available. These songs have been prefixed with [D] and slotted into the sequence based on when they were recorded. So, the band’s very first demo, Patricia, is coded as [D0a]. The [0] denotes that the demo of the song was recorded before [1] The Silent Sun. The [a] denotes that it was recorded before [D0b] She Is Beautiful. Unreleased material has been prefixed with [U]. There is only one track this applies to and that is [U186] Nowhere Else to Turn. The [186] denotes it would have been numbered such had it been released officially. Each song entry includes the following detail:\n\n[cat ref] Title Band Credit: Up until The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, all songs were credited to Genesis, regardless of who wrote them. From A Trick of the Tail songs were credited to the specific writer(s). Music: Where known I have identified the band member(s) responsible for writing the music. In most cases this will be a shared credit as the band’s tendency was to work either from jam sessions, in partnership or by piecing separately written pieces together.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nNotes on Cataloguing Lyrics: Here, again where known, I have identified the writer of the lyrics. The band tended to apportion this activity to a specific member who had an energy for the song or a specific lyrical concept. Length: Song lengths are stated in their currently available version. Other lengths (e.g., edited versions for single releases) are noted in the text. Musicians: This is a list of who played what on the track. For some of the band’s earlier recordings this can be difficult to ascertain, notably on the acoustic numbers where any of up to three band members may be contributing guitar parts. Recorded at: The studio where the song was recorded along with the date of the recording or the start to end dates of the album recording sessions, of which the song was a part. Mixed at: The studio at which the song was mixed for its original release. Producer: The name of the producer of the song. Engineer: The name of the recording engineer who supported the producer. Assistants: The name of any technical assistant on the recording. Remix/Remaster release: Details of the technical crew involved in the remixing and remastering of the original recording. UK/U.S. Release: Dates the song was released in each country. A date is provided for both the album release and when applicable, the single release. It should be noted there is much confusion over actual release dates which, until 1989, were loose. From 1989, albums and singles were generally released on Monday in the UK and Tuesday in the U.S. From 10 July 2015 this moved to Friday internationally. Here I have used what I believe to be the most accurate release dates based on my research. For single releases the catalogue number is also noted. Album catalogue details can be obtained in the main album listing. Single releases will also note whether the song was an A ­ -side or B ­ -side.\n\nA description and review of the song including notes on its recording and, where relevant, comments from the band or production staff as well as music journalists. Additional sections are added as appropriate including: Alternative versions: Notes on other recorded versions such as demos or different mixes. Single Release: Information about the single release of a song, which includes chart activity and other worldwide releases, although the primary focus is on the UK and U.S. markets. Music Video: Description and detail relating to any promotional videos filmed for the song. BBC Sessions: The band recorded songs over five sessions between 1970 and 1972 for the BBC. Notes are made about those sessions including venue, dates, technical credits and so on. Live Performances: Details of the tours on which the song was performed and associated notes. Live Recordings: Notes on any subsequent live recordings of the song, including venue and which album/single/archive release the live version of the song was included. Archive Release: Demo recordings also include a note of which archive release the song is included on. Most songs after are grouped in the sections of the album for which the sessions were recorded. This includes songs that did not make the album cut and were later released as ­B-sides to singles or as EPs. While in the early days the band attended studios for specific recording sessions of demos and their early single releases, between Trespass and Selling England by the Pound the band only recorded [32] Happy the Man as a dedicated isolated session. The only other “session” the band undertook separately after this was for their final release [186] The Carpet Crawlers 1999. It is difficult when looking back in history, where documentation is sparse, to be 100 percent accurate about the details. The band themselves are sketchier about their own history than their fans. Therefore, for each album and song listing where information is unsubstantiated or where I have had to make an assumption, for example whether a band member played a specific instrument or had contributed backing vocals, I have included a (?) notation alongside.\n\nPart 1\n\nThe Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970 Tony Banks (Keyboards) Peter Gabriel (Vocals, Flute, Percussion) Anthony Phillips (Guitars) Mike Rutherford (Bass, Guitars) Chris Stewart, John Silver, John Mayhew (Drums)\n\nThe original 1968 line-up of Genesis.

Tony Banks was the fifth child of John and Nora Banks—he had an older brother, John (who also went to Charterhouse School) and three older sisters, Mary, Margaret and Pauline. Both his mother and grandmother were musical with his mother being a keen pianist. The young Tony Banks used to listen intently to her playing Chopin on the family grand piano and fell in love with the sound of the instrument. Noting her son’s interest, Nora Banks arranged for him to have piano lessons. Schooled on popular classical pieces, the shy and introverted Banks quickly became technically proficient, although he did not enjoy the discipline of the grading process approach to learning. From the age of 7, Banks attended Boarzell, a boarding prep school in Hurst Green before moving on to Charterhouse as a matter of course six years later. As he progressed through Charterhouse, he concentrated his studies on the sciences. However, he continued to pursue his love of music and found a sympathetic teacher of classical piano in Leonard Halcrow, who helped him develop as a player by teaching him pieces by Rachmaninov. Banks also made great use of the house piano in his free time, playing pieces from sheet music or by ear. While he was schooled on classical musicians, he became increasingly interested in popular music—notably the songs of The Beatles and The Animals. Peter Gabriel was the son of electrical engineer, Ralph Parton Gabriel. It was his mother, Edith Irene, who encouraged his interest in music and taught him to play the piano. After attending Cable House prep school in Woking, Gabriel entered Charterhouse—continuing a family tradition. He hated the school and felt, like many of his peers, both trapped and alone. He was conscious of his weight and the fact he had pimples and therefore resolved to attract attention to himself through the writing of songs. Musically, he was also fascinated by the drums and his first musical instrument was a bass ­tom-tom from which he went on to assemble his first kit. He would also go on to play in a school traditional jazz band called Milords. Gabriel himself admits that he was a more enthusiastic than talented drummer. Having met on their first day at Charterhouse, Banks and Gabriel soon got to know each other through their shared interest in music and the pair used to battle it out over access to the house piano, on which they would play their favorite songs. Gabriel recalled the scramble to get to the instrument, “Sometimes this would mean clambering through the food hatch to beat the person running through the door. It was that critical.”2 The pair 14\n\n1. The Genesis of Genesis15\n\nwould also visit Record Corner, a store in Godalming town center, and use the booths provided to listen to the soul records of Otis Redding and James Brown. Banks was introduced to The Beatles by a friend, Mark Weekes, and learned by ear to play much of their back catalogue, starting with “Eight Days a Week.” Gabriel soon realized Banks was the better piano player and Banks that Gabriel was the better singer. The pair started to write music together, using original chord sequences and melodies to come up with songs that were challenging and different. As they wrote together, Banks and Gabriel soon became aware of two younger pupils who had also taken to writing songs and had formed a band. MICHAEL JOHN CLEOTE CRAWFORD “MIKE” RUTHERFORD (born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, England, 2 October 1950) had enrolled at Charterhouse in September 1964, while ANTHONY EDWIN “ANT” PHILLIPS (born in London, England, 23 December 1951) followed in April 1965. Mike Rutherford’s father, William Francis Henry Crawford Rutherford, was a Royal navy captain3 and his mother, Anne, was a widow—her previous husband having died of cancer. The family moved around the country a lot due to the requirements of his father’s navy service. Aged 7, young Michael attended boarding school at the Leas Hoylake on the Wirral in Cheshire. His mother was keen on the arts and the following year Rutherford was drawn to the guitar, initially by its shape. His parents bought him a Spanish guitar and paid for him to have lessons. His sister, Nicolette, was a fan of Elvis Presley and The Everly Brothers and Rutherford idolized Hank Marvin from The Shadows—being a big follower of their recordings with Cliff Richard. Anne later bought her son his first electric guitar, a Hofner, when he was 12. With his friend Dimitri Griliopoulos, a guitarist and drummer, he would play the hits of the day. The family later moved to Farnham, also in Cheshire, but Rutherford was placed for the next level of his schooling at Charterhouse, which put a physical distance of a couple of hundred miles between them. Anthony Phillips started playing guitar at the age of 11 while he was at St. Edmund’s boarding school, in Hindhead. It was here he joined the school band known as The Spiders. The only other competent musician in the band was his friend Rivers Job4 (pronounced Jobe). Phillips’ father was a wealthy banker and president of an insurance company and Phillips was brought up in the Putney and Roehampton areas of southwest London. Although they were music lovers, neither of his parents were players. He advanced his interest through school concerts and took his guitar with him to Charterhouse. Here, he reconnected with Rivers Job, who had moved to the school the previous year, thereby making Phillips’ own entry to the school that much easier. None of the quartet of Banks, Gabriel, Rutherford and Phillips enjoyed their schooldays. Charterhouse had a strict regime which was at odds with the increasingly liberated social attitudes of the time. It bred shy young men who were very insular, having been sheltered from the outside world and the opposite sex. Gabriel would endure many sleepless nights, while Rutherford became the victim of a housemaster who banned him from playing the guitar for much of his time there. “Unfortunately, I caught the place at a pretty weird time,” Rutherford later commented, “as many traditions from the old English empire were becoming obsolete. I caught the brunt of those changes. A lot of kids ran away.”5 As a release from the traumas of boarding school life the four boys reveled in their music. As Rutherford wasn’t allowed to play guitar, he spent some of his time in the school choir—more to give him a musical outlet rather than from any religious standpoint. Later, with Phillips, he formed a school band called Anon.6 Other members included Rob Tyrell on drums, Rivers Job on bass and Richard Macphail7 on vocals. The budding musicians were highly influenced by The Beatles, The Who and The Rolling Stones and extensively\n\n16\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\ncovered The Stones’ album Out of Our Heads. On 16 December 1965, Anon performed at a School Entertainment Day and included a set of three Rolling Stones songs (“We’ve Got a Good Thing Going,” “Talkin’ ’bout You” and “That’s How Strong My Love Is”). Due to his ban, Rutherford was only loosely involved from thereon and eventually went on to form a band called Climax. Anon therefore employed another friend, Mick Colman, to bridge the gap. Rutherford would eventually realize Anon had the stronger musicians and returned on bass once Rivers Job had been excluded from the school for his insubordination.8 Meanwhile, Gabriel and Banks joined with trumpet player Johnny Trapman and drummer CHRISTOPHER “CHRIS” STEWART (born 1950 in Horsham, Surrey, England) to form The Garden Wall. While Stewart had a reputation as a bit of a rebel, The Garden Wall’s music was not as rock ’n’ roll as that of Anon. Stewart had been taught drums by Gabriel, who wanted to be freed up to sing and play flute. In terms of cover material, The Garden Wall were more interested in the soul songs of the day from artists such as Otis Redding and Percy Sledge. In July 1966, the end of term concert featured both Anon and The Garden Wall. Phillips and Rutherford played in both bands, adding guitars and bass to The Garden Wall’s sound. Banks played grand piano from below stage level (the piano was too heavy to get on stage), while Gabriel wore a very tall hat—maybe the first indication of his ultimate move into theatrical costume during his Genesis days. During the summer vacation, Anon made a demo tape at Tony Pike Sound in Putney with the Anthony Phillips written and Rolling S­ tones-influenced song “Pennsylvania Flickhouse.”9 Nothing came of this and gradually the band began to disintegrate. Phillips and Rutherford eventually drifted towards Banks and Gabriel. Phillips had tuned into Banks’ love of The Beatles, having heard him play their songs on the piano, while Gabriel stood singing using the dining room table as his stage. When Richard Macphail left Charterhouse to go to Millfield School, the two songwriting pairs linked up to work as a collective. In December 1966, Phillips, Rutherford, Banks and Gabriel recorded six songs at the studio of their friend Brian Roberts.10 The demos were intended to promote the quartet as a writing team but not as a band unit given their relatively limited capabilities with their respective instruments. The quartet aimed to sell their songs to music publishers. Initially, Phillips was to handle the singing until Banks persuaded him that Gabriel had the stronger voice, pointing to the character and excitement Gabriel brought to his vocal work. While Rutherford and Phillips were inspired by the British rock and blues scene, Gabriel and Banks were still primarily listening to the American soul of Stax and Motown and that influence came through in Gabriel’s soulful approach to singing. As a result, the writing output of the two teams varied, being largely tied to their specific influences. The tape the quartet recorded consisted of early versions of [D0c] Try a Little Sadness, [2] That’s Me, “Listen on Five,” “Don’t Want You Back,” [D0a] Patricia and [D0b] She Is Beautiful. Rutherford and Phillips had written all the songs, except for [D0b] She Is Beautiful, which was written by Banks and Gabriel. Phillips and Rutherford both later admitted [D0b] She Is Beautiful was the strongest song of the set.\n\n[D0a] Patricia Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music: Anthony Phillips Length: 3:05\n\n1. The Genesis of Genesis17 Tony Banks—Acoustic Guitar; Peter Gabriel—Drums; Anthony Phillips—Lead Acoustic Guitar; Mike Rutherford—Bass; Mick Colman—Acoustic Guitar Demo recorded at Brian Roberts’ Home studio, 26 March 1967. UK/U.S. Release: 22 June 1998 (­4-CD: Genesis Archive 1967–75)\n\nPatricia was one of the six pieces included on the original demo tape handed to Jonathan King. This version is the earliest demo Genesis has made available and was recorded during Easter 1967 at the home studio of their friend Brian Roberts. The surviving recording is rough but gives a fascinating insight into the band during its infancy, here joined by Mick Colman. The piece was written by Phillips about a girl he coveted when he was just 13 years old. It is an instrumental track written in D major and in 3/4 time which is based around a simple strummed acoustic guitar arrangement. Phillips provides the lead melody over Rutherford’s uncomplicated bass line and Banks’ accompanying acoustic guitar. The demo is also notable for the appearance of Gabriel on drums, who fails to acquit himself with any real distinction as he sticks rigidly to the ­waltz-like rhythm. Gabriel would later admit that what limited drumming abilities he had could be attributed to sheer enthusiasm rather than any level of technical expertise. While the song is pleasantly folky, it is being played by a group of inexperienced musicians finding their feet as both players and writers. It did, however, have a sufficiently strong enough hook to be developed later, with the addition of a vocal part, for From Genesis to Revelation as [12] In Hiding.

A remastered version (3:05) appeared on the Edsel Records 2005 ­2-CD rerelease of From Genesis to Revelation. * * * In early 1967, an old boy already involved in the music business as a pop singer and music publisher visited Charterhouse. His name was Jonathan King.11 King had achieved fame through his hit single “Everyone’s Gone to the Moon” and therefore was perceived to have some clout in the music industry. He had set up his own music publishing company— Jonjo Music—with Joe Ronocoroni and Ken Jones, former manager of The Zombies. Being too shy themselves, the band persuaded one of their friends, John Alexander, to hand King their demo tape. King didn’t play their tape until he was driving home in his MGB GT. He immediately latched onto Gabriel’s voice and wanted to hear more. During the summer of 1967, two of the original demo songs were rerecorded at Regent Sound Studios ([D0b] She Is Beautiful and [D0c] Try a Little Sadness) as well as demos of two further songs, [5] Where the Sour Turns to Sweet and [18] Image Blown Out.\n\n[D0b] She Is Beautiful12 Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel Length: 3:47 Tony Banks—Piano, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals Demo recorded at Regent Sounds Studio, London, summer 1967. UK/U.S. Release: 22 June 1998 (­4-CD: Genesis Archive 1967–75)\n\nThis was the first song Banks and Gabriel wrote together. Banks came up with the chord sequence and bass part on piano, while Gabriel improvised the vocal melody line\n\n18\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\nand wrote the lyrics. This was typical of how the pair worked as a writing team at the time, sometimes alternating roles. The song went through many changes from this original demo to the revised version, with new lyrics, that was included on From Genesis to Revelation as [8] The Serpent. This version of the song tells the story of a beautiful woman trapped by her fame after she has become a famous model. Banks’ cheeky, snaking piano rhythm in D major accompanies Gabriel as he delivers a distinctive vocal interpretation of a set of awkward lyrics. Phillips and Rutherford strum along a little hesitantly on acoustic guitar. The song demonstrated, even at this early stage, Banks’ desire to change standard harmonies and chord progressions as he switches key to A minor during the chorus and to D minor on the playout. The c­ horal-styled backing vocals are typical of the late ’60s (the band would dub themselves The Wild Boars) and now feel very dated. However, this was the best song from the original demo tape handed to Jonathan King and the one that piqued his interest, leading to it being rerecorded as this specific version recorded at Regent Studios.

Like [D0b] She Is Beautiful, this version was a later recording made at Regent Studios during the summer of 1967. The band have been very honest about these early efforts, emphasizing they were songwriters looking to have their material performed by others. Their playing on these demos is reflective of their limited ability as musicians at this stage. Try a Little Sadness adopts the standard pop song structure of three core musical sections comprising verse, chorus and bridge. Banks again plays a funky piano introduction to the song before settling into a straightforward rhythmic approach to accompany Phillips and Rutherford’s heavily strummed acoustic guitars. Phillips provides a short and very tentative acoustic solo through the song’s bridge. The track has a pleasant, but not especially memorable, melody. The lyrics are obscure but urge the young listener in a hip refrain around its title, rather untidily delivered in chorus by the band. Gabriel and Banks were huge Otis Redding fans and it is likely the title was a contrary spin on the soul singer’s “Try a Little Tenderness.” Archive Release: This demo was included on the ­4-CD box set Genesis Archive 1967–75 released in 1998. A remastered version (3:18) appeared on the Edsel Records 2005 ­2-CD rerelease of From Genesis to Revelation. * * * Jonathan King was impressed enough by the band’s latest demos to sign them to Jonjo Music on 30 August 1967, subject to yearly options.13 “We were excited just by the fact that anyone was interested in our songs. We would have signed for life at that stage,”14 com-\n\n1. The Genesis of Genesis19\n\nmented Banks. King was initially interested in the band primarily as a writing team, something Phillips acknowledged, “We were signed as songwriters and I think he wanted to make us more of a group like Hedgehoppers Anonymous.”15 Further song demos were recorded through 1967 and into 1968 at both Regent Sound Studios and Central Sound in London. These included [D0d] Hidden in the World of Dawn, [D4b] Hey!, [D0e] Sea Bee, [D0f] The Mystery of the Flannan Isle Lighthouse, [D0g] Hair on the Arms and Legs, [D4a] The Magic of Time and [6] In the Beginning. Other songs that were recorded but have never been subsequently released included: “Barnaby’s Adventure,” “Fourteen Years Too Long,” “Lost in a Drawer,” “I’m Here,” “2:30 Parktime (a.m. p.m.),” “There was a Movement,” “Everywhere Is Here,” “F#1” (which evolved into [25] The Musical Box), “Humanity,” “Sitting on Top of the World,” “From the Bottom of a Well” and “You Got to Be Perfect.”\n\n[D0d] Hidden in the World of Dawn Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Length: 3:10 Tony Banks—Piano, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals Demo recorded at Regent Sounds Studio, London, October 1967. UK/U.S. Release: 22 June 1998 (­4-CD: Genesis Archive 1967–75)\n\nA ­two-chord piano figure by Banks is backed by Phillips’ picked acoustic guitar in the opening of this demo. Gabriel’s delicate vocal, augmented by the band’s ragged harmonizing, echoes the piano melody and lyrically describes the beauty and quiet of the dawn before the chaos of the day commences. It is a lyric that tries too hard to be poetic and merely comes across as fey, thereby weakening further what isn’t musically a particularly strong song. It feels like there is a constant tussle between Banks’ piano and Gabriel’s vocal for the most part, as if Gabriel were singing over the top of an intended instrumental. That may be partly due to the lack of production with this recording being a demo with little attempt to get a balanced mix. Like all the demos from this period, the absence of a drummer means the songs lack rhythmic thrust beyond Banks’ piano. The result is a very cluttered arrangement. Jonathan King was not keen on the song, wanting a simpler approach and more hook orientated approach to the band’s music.

Here again Banks’ piano provides the basis for a delicate verse. There is a bit more attack in the chorus as Banks pushes for an aggressive major key chord progression from G to C via A sharp. Philips and Rutherford add an uncomplicated gently strummed acoustic guitar accompaniment. The song ends abruptly and feels unfinished both in conception and arrangement. As a demo of the band’s writing talents it is one of their lesser tunes. The “Sea Bee” referred to in the lyrics is not a construction worker in the navy, but some mythical insect in flight over the sea. If there is any meaning to the lyrics it is not easily identifiable.

UK/U.S. Release: 22 June 1998 (­4-CD: Genesis Archive 1967–75)\n\nThis is a further demo recorded at the Regent Studio sessions in autumn 1967. The song opens with a repeated, grooving piano riff from Banks over descending chords, while Phillips and Rutherford again strum quietly away in the background. While this provides a promising start, the song soon settles into a familiar arrangement with the band’s overly emphasized “Wild Boars” choral backing. The verse revolves around E flat, B flat and A flat, with Banks almost overlapping himself as he uneasily plays the galloping major key piano chords. The lyrics focus on the mystery of boats being attracted to a shrouded lighthouse and crashing against the rocks.16 The song fades out with Banks playing a repeated riff over descending chords—it is the strongest musical section of the piece but is quickly gone.

However, the song lacks the hook that Jonathan King was looking for and is bereft of rhythmic punch. Musically the piece ambles along aimlessly to its conclusion. Phillips and Rutherford’s acoustic guitars are barely audible in the rough mix. The thoughtful lyrics tell the story of an old man trapped by his inability to solve the problems of the world. Gabriel’s vocal textures attempt to capture the frustration and hopelessness outlined in the lyrics and provides a hint of the poten-\n\n1. The Genesis of Genesis21\n\ntial within. Fragments of this song were later used in the BBC recording of [D18c] Frustration in January 1970—part of the s­o-called Jackson Tapes collection.

Banks and Gabriel were frustrated with King’s perceived lack of enthusiasm for the songs, which were veering into more lyrically and musically complex territory. King, however, was looking for hits. The band regrouped and discussed how they could rekindle King’s interest. Knowing of King’s love of the Bee Gees, Gabriel and Banks wrote The Silent Sun as a pastiche of the Gibbs Brothers’ “To Love Somebody.” Gabriel even delivered his best Robin Gibb impersonation on the second verse. The strategy worked as King was predictably impressed and took the band into the studio for sessions between December 1967 and April 1968 to record songs for their first two singles and he also finally gave the band its name—Genesis.18 At these sessions, the band recorded four songs for two separate single releases on the Decca label—[1] The Silent Sun backed with [2] That’s Me and [3] A Winter’s Tale\n\n22\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\nbacked with [4] ­One-Eyed Hound. A further recording of ­One-Eyed Hound (referenced as “On the Trail of the ­One-Eyed Hound”), alongside another track “I’m Here,” was made at Regent Studio on 17 April 1968. The Silent Sun is a lightly romantic, midtempo piece with fanciful lyrics. The song is based around a simple repeated ­verse-chorus structure—utilizing just four regular chords (G major, C major, D major and A minor). Stylistically, it is a fusion of folk and pop styles and boasts a pleasing melody over an unimaginative acoustic arrangement that is made overly complex by the introduction of some intrusive strings. While Banks and Gabriel’s cynical attempt to capture King’s attention had worked, Phillips had major reservations about the approach, later noting, “It was a song I hated. As a young idealist I thought it was a ­sell-out.”19 The mono recording was released as a single on the Decca label in the UK (and on London’s Parrot label in the U.S.) on 22 February 1968. The single was first played on BBC Radio One by DJ Kenny Everett. It was also placed on the rotation list for Radio Caroline, until the pirate station was forced off the air only a month after the single’s release. The band was hopeful of a hit and bought themselves outfits in the event they would be asked to appear on Top of the Pops.20 Phillips later commented, “Mercifully it wasn’t successful. I think if it had been successful it would have been the end of the band. The band would have got stuck, would never have developed a really original sound.”21 Banks echoed Phillips’ views, although he felt the song could have been a hit given the right circumstances. It was possibly indicative of King’s hesitancy about the band that he chose not to promote the single on his own TV show of the time, Good Evening—I’m Jonathan King. The song did receive strong reviews from Chris Welch in Melody Maker and Derek Johnson in the New Musical Express. Johnson said the single was “a disc of many facets and great depth.”22 Both writers enjoyed the arrangement and the poetic nature of the lyrics. Their recommendations, however, had little impact on the single’s sales. The song would later be included in a slightly remixed form as “Silent Sun” on the band’s debut album, From Genesis to Revelation, released just over a year later, with the single version also included on many of the subsequent rereleases. Alternative Versions: The Silent Sun was remixed and reissued under the title “The Silent Sun 2006” as a CD single by Revvolution Records (REVVCDS002) under the band name of “Peter Gabriel and Genesis” on 8 January 2007, having previously been made available as an online download. A newly recorded drum track (player unknown) is more prominent in the mix here. The song was accompanied by a similar remix of [5] Where the Sour Turns to Sweet. Another remastered mono mix of The Silent Sun (2:14) along with an alternative mono mix (2:13), minus the strings, appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes released in 2017.\n\n[2] That’s Me Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Length: 2:39 Tony Banks—Piano, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Bass, Backing Vocals; Chris Stewart—Drums and Percussion Recorded at Regent Sounds A Studio, London, December 1967.

The Genesis of Genesis23\n\nThat’s Me was the B ­ -side to [1] The Silent Sun and is an uptempo song about isolation and inner turmoil with the protagonist complaining about how everybody misunderstands him. The song was written by Phillips and Rutherford with Phillips’ use of electric guitar the most interesting aspect as he provides a hesitant, but brief, solo early (0:59–1:14). “There’s a glitch in the solo,” recalled Phillips, “where it became known that I am supposed to have said ‘oh fuck’ when I missed the bend.”23 Crashing power chords in the closing section—obviously inspired by The Who guitarist Pete Townshend—make this the heaviest recording Genesis had produced in their initial batch. The band was still going for a feel they hoped would impress King and that desire to please is apparent here in a forced performance that sounds rushed in parts. Stewart’s drumming is also weak, lacking the power and drive the piece needed. The song was later included on several rerelease versions of the band’s debut From Genesis to Revelation. Alternative Versions: A remastered mono mix version of the song (2:37) appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes in 2017.\n\n[3] A Winter’s Tale Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel Length: 3:28 Tony Banks—Piano, Organ, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Bass, Backing Vocals; Chris Stewart—Drums and Percussion; Unknown—Brass Recorded at Regent Sounds A Studio, London, between December 1967 and March 1968.

F 12775)\n\nGenesis’ second single was released nearly three months after [1] The Silent Sun. A Winter’s Tale is a simple song with a typical l­ate-1960s folk/pop feel. The poetic lyrics draw on images of winter as a metaphor for the cooling of a relationship. Musically, the gentle verses lack distinction. However, the crescendo into the chorus is built around an agreeable melody, but the song is hampered by unsubtle backing vocal harmonies. Banks does, however, add some musical excitement with his lifting sustained organ chords using inversions to shift between A major, D major, B minor and F sharp major. The drama created by Banks’ harmonies gave Gabriel the opportunity to inject some urgency and drive into his vocal performance. Again, a largely brass orchestral backing, arranged by Arthur Greenslade, was added to the track but here it is less intrusive than were the strings on The Silent Sun. Banks was given the job of trying to persuade DJ Tony Blackburn to play the song on his BBC Radio One show, but the single ultimately failed to produce the resonance the band were looking for with the record buying public, despite another positive critical response. Derek Johnson was again impressed as he remarked in his review of the single for the New Musical Express, “The ­soul-searching lyric is impressive and gripping—and, while the melody could have done with a little more substance, it’s a platter I can thoroughly recommend.”25 A demo pressing by London records, sharing the same catalogue reference as the Decca disc, was produced but the single is not believed to have received an official release in\n\n24\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\nthe U.S. The song was, however, released as a single in Australia (again b/w [4] ­One-Eyed Hound) and was included as a bonus track on several rerelease versions of From Genesis to Revelation. Interestingly this is the only song the band managed to sell to another artist under their original concept of a songwriter collective. An Italian singer, Carlo Pavone, recorded the song with new lyrics as “Chi Ti Ha Dato La Sua Vita,” which was released by Arc Records in 1968. This version was swamped with strings, but otherwise remained faithful to the band’s composition. Alternative Versions: An i­ n-studio ­work-in-progress sample (7:38) with studio conversations between the band and producer King as the song is started and stopped, appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes in 2017. The final take from the recordings, included toward the end of this extended “in studio” version, is the one that was released as the single.\n\n[4] One Eyed Hound Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel Length: 2:30 Tony Banks—Piano, Organ, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Bass, Backing Vocals; Chris Stewart—Drums and Percussion Recorded at Regent Sounds A Studio, London, between December 1967 and March 1968. Producer: Jonathan King. Engineer: Tom Allom. UK Release: 10 May 1968. (­B-side single b/w [3] A Winter’s Tale. Decca. F 12775)\n\nThis seemingly Beatles influenced tune (note Phillips’ harmonized electric guitar sound during the song’s opening) finds the band sounding much more confident. There is still an occasional hesitancy to the playing, notably Phillips’ acoustic lead lines, but the song has presence. The acoustic guitar takes the lead in the arrangement, while Phillips’ electric underpins the chorus alongside Banks’ piano. The song also hints at the feel Genesis would explore further on Trespass, with its faster passages contrasting with the surrounding gentler verses and featuring Stewart’s best drumming for the band. The lyrics are obscure—basically representing the mutterings of a man committing a sin while in search of the ­one-eyed hound, suggesting this is the story of a man on the run. Gabriel contributes a strong and confident vocal and Banks’ voice is dominant in the backing. The song was later included as a bonus track on several rerelease versions of From Genesis to Revelation. Alternative Versions: An alternative stereo mix using the original working title “On the Trail of the O ­ ne-Eyed Hound” (2:39) appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes in 2017. The cleaner mix and slightly longer edit includes a c­ ount-in by Gabriel while his vocal is more dominant in the mix. Banks’ organ is also mixed slightly higher on the outro. * * * Despite Jonathan King’s enthusiasm, the lack of success for both singles meant the band’s preparation for stardom had to be postponed. King and the band remained undeterred and discussions commenced about the recording of an album. King had expressed concerns about the band’s rhythm section, which would need to be addressed ahead of\n\n1. The Genesis of Genesis25\n\nentering the studio. The band agreed and Chris Stewart, who was still attending school, was paid £300 to leave the band and sign away the rights to future royalties. Both the band and Stewart have since cited the drummer’s lack of empathy with the music and an inability to add definition to the rhythm section as the reason behind the split.26 Rutherford, supported by the band’s friend John Alexander, was tasked with breaking the news. Genesis quickly recruited a replacement drummer. Jazz fan JONATHAN “JOHN” SILVER was born in 1950 and educated at St. Edward’s School, Oxford.27 Gabriel had met Silver at Davis, Laing & Dick, a crammer (an institution to prepare students for exams) in London where they were both studying. They had struck up a rapport when Silver introduced the singer to new musical influences, including Randy Newman and The Beach Boys. Gabriel suggested Silver as a replacement for Stewart and the rest of the band agreed. Silver worked on further demos with the band through 1968 with further session recordings made at Central Sound Studio on Denmark Street in London as well as Regent Sounds.\n\n[D4a] The Magic of Time Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Length: 2:01 Tony Banks—Piano; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Acoustic Guitar; Mike Rutherford—Bass; John Silver—Percussion; David Thomas—Backing Vocals Demo recorded at Regent Sounds Studio, early 1968.

The drummer had been unable to get his kit into the studio and was forced to use the best alternative instrument available. Rutherford’s walking bass line adds to the jazzy feel. This short song may have worked better as an instrumental, with Gabriel’s vocals a little swamped in the rough mix and competing for attention with the skittering rhythm and Banks’ dominant piano chords. The lyrics describe the fashioning of the land, rivers and seas over the passing of time as if guided by some ancient scripture. Banks grooves pleasantly on piano during the playout. The band’s l­ ong-time friend David Thomas provided the harmony backing vocals to Gabriel.28 Archive Release: This demo was included on the ­4-CD box set Genesis Archive 1967–75 released in 1998.\n\n[D4b] Hey!

These included Silver’s parents’ house in Oxford and David Thomas’ in Hampshire. Genesis finally returned to Regent Sounds B Studio in the summer holidays of 1968 to record From Genesis to Revelation1 with King as producer. The recording of the album was scheduled over ten days but was reportedly completed in three. The songs were captured on a ­four-track machine that left little room for overdubbing with the band concentrating on playing the songs live and using the best take. The downside of this method of working was that it put a strain on Gabriel’s vocals as his voice tired through the recordings. The band finalized a collection of their best songs, some of which were adapted from earlier demos. Together with King, they selected those that would ultimately ap27\n\n28\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\nAdvertisement for the release of Genesis’ debut album, From Genesis to Revelation placed in Record Mirror on 12 April 1969 (courtesy Mark Kenyon/The Genesis Archive).\n\npear on the album. By this stage the band was utilizing more of the songs written by Banks and Gabriel.2 While Phillips also contributed a few pieces, Rutherford was less involved in the writing at this stage. The band was keen to explore a crossover sound between folk and rock, but lyrically the album centered its theme on the story of the Bible—in this instance, the creation of the world. The theme came at King’s suggestion and was aimed at giving the album a concept to hang the songs around. While this may seem more than a little pretentious, it did give the band a lyrical hook, leading them to rewrite lyrics to some of the songs in order to fit the concept. In retrospect, this decision could be judged a mistake as it led to many record shops dumping the album in their “Religious” sections. King was not present for all the sessions, leaving the technical recording process to engineers Brian Roberts and Tom Allom, but he remained the project’s guiding light. It was only later the orchestral parts, arranged by Arthur Greenslade and conducted by Lou Warburton,3 were added to flesh out and commercialize the sound in a way The Moody Blues had done successfully. The band was unaware of King’s plan and Phillips was particularly annoyed by the additions, feeling the new arrangements robbed the songs of some of their power. The rest of the band were more philosophical about the move. King later justified it by saying, “I like it with all the strings and links between the tracks. It was at a time when ‘concept’ albums had not really been invented, so it was one of the first. I think the added sweetness, and professionalism, makes it truly unusual and covers up any amateurism.”4\n\n2.

The band was unhappy with the recording and the single idea was dropped. While “From the Bottom of the Well” disappeared into obscurity, “Sour Turns Sweet” was included in the batch of songs to be recorded for From Genesis to Revelation. Finger clicks over a climbing piano and bass riff present an uplifting gospel feel that signals the “religious” theme of the album. The verse switches to Phillips’ gently strummed acoustic guitar and Banks’ heavy piano major chords rotating from C to F to G and colored by Arthur Greenslade’s string arrangement. It rather plods toward the chorus which returns to the opening riff, with Greenslade adding brass to the arrangement. Here the orchestration works reasonably well with the brass section giving the song depth to the arrangement allowing the backing vocal harmonies to be mixed down. Gabriel’s vocals are assured throughout as he pleads the listener to join his throng. Originally, the song was to have a different chorus, but Banks and Gabriel felt it was weak and rewrote the chorus to repeat the theme of the intro. The song also fades with an outro reprising the piano/bass and ­finger-clicks figure of the intro. It makes for a f­ resh-sounding and appealing opener to the album. Single Release: The song was released by Decca as an A ­ -side single on 27 June 1969 in the UK (b/w [12] In Hiding) without any chart success. Arthur Greenslade was credited on the label as Music Director. The song was also released as a single by Decca in New Zealand. Alternative Versions: A 1968 demo of the song (3:06), minus the strings, was included on the 1998 box set Genesis Archive 1967–1975. A remixed version (3:18) with a newly added drum track (player unknown) was included as the “­B-side” to the remixed single rerelease of [1] The Silent Sun (as The Silent Sun 2006) on CD in January 2007, having previously been available as an online download. A slightly longer remastered mono version (3:25) and new and cleaner mono mix without the strings (3:29) appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes in 2017.\n\n[6] In the Beginning Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Anthony Phillips/Peter Gabriel Length: 3:45 Tony Banks—Piano; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips—Guitar, Acoustic Guitar; Mike Rutherford—Bass; John Silver—Drums\n\n30\n\nPart 1—The Formative Years: September 1963–September 1970\n\nRecorded at Regent Sounds B Studio, London, August 1968. Producer: Jonathan King. Engineer: Brian Roberts & Tom Allom. UK Release: 7 March 1969. (LP: From Genesis to Revelation) U.S. Release: August 1974. (LP: From Genesis to Revelation)\n\nA rumbling and distorted oscillating guitar effect provides an atmospheric opening to the second track on the album. It then fades into Rutherford’s bouncing bass line, which is repeated throughout the verse. Banks’ piano takes more of a back seat as Phillips’ guitar work comes to the fore. The result is one of the strongest cuts on the album, with its grandiose story of the world’s formation marrying well with the more urgent rhythms on show. Another Pete ­Townshend-inspired riff from Phillips’ electric guitar gives the song its drive and Gabriel delivers a strong vocal performance that captures the drama of the natural event. Unfortunately, the impact is lessened by Gabriel’s vocal being too far back in the mix and his voice being drenched with reverb. Alternative Versions: A 1968 demo version (3:27) can be found on the box set Genesis Archive 1967–75. A new mono mix of the song (4:23), minus the drone intro and instead including the piano bridge to [7] Fireside Song, appeared on the 50 Years Ago album of remixes and outtakes in 2017. Gabriel’s vocals are much more up front here. Single Release: A press testing had been completed for a potential UK single release but went no further. The song was much later released as a single by Decca (b/w [8] The Serpent) in Italy in 1974. Live Performances: 1969/70. The song was performed on some of the band’s early gigs. Live Recordings: No officially released live recordings of the song exist.\n\n[7] Fireside Song Band Credit: Tony Banks/Peter Gabriel/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Music & Lyrics: Tony Banks/Anthony Phillips/Mike Rutherford Length: 4:18 Tony Banks—Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Peter Gabriel—Lead Vocals; Anthony Phillips— Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals; Mike Rutherford—Bass; John Silver—Percussion; Unknown— Strings Recorded at Regent Sounds B Studio, London, August 1968 and 17–19 November 1968 (Orchestra).
