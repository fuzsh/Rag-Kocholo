        "text": "A Taylor Swift superfan has spent £5k going to the Eras tour nine times in three different countries.\n\nBridget Saric had always dreamed of seeing Taylor Swift and couldn't believe it when she got her hands on tickets to see her in Melbourne, Australia, in February 2024. The 21-year-old loved it so much she has now been to nine shows in total - three in Melbourne, one in Sydney in Australia, two in London, one in Liverpool and one in Cardiff in the UK and one in Milan, Italy.\n\nBridget, originally from Mackay in Queensland, Australia, estimates she has spent £3,450 on tickets, £920 on flights and accommodation and £1,000 on her costumes. She is counting down the days until she can see her favourite artist again - and has already bagged £150 tickets for an August date in London.\n\nBridget, who works in a hostel in central London, said: \"I'm pretty crazy. With the Eras tour - it's such a safe space.\n\n\"I wear leotards and I don't care what people think. Everyone is so inclusive. Everyone is in such a happy mood. Taylor Swift is amazing.\"\n\nBridget says she has \"always been a Swiftie\" and previously missed opportunities to see the pop star in concert but was desperate to get her hands on tickets for the Eras tour. She managed to bag tickets for all three Melbourne shows - costing her $1,200 AUD in total (£600).\n\nHer parents - Lisa, 46, and Spok, 57 - even joined her for the first night in Melbourne and her dad donned a cheerleader outfit. For most of the shows Bridget goes by herself - and she has made friends along the way.\n\nShe said: \"I love going by myself. People started looking out for me in the crowd. I had made so many friends.\"\n\nBridget has now moved to London on a working visa and has already been to four UK gigs. Her mum, Lisa, helps make her outfits and posts them to her for each of the concerts.\n\nHer most expensive gig was Sydney where she got a third-row ticket for $1,300 AUD (£650) but she said it was \"so worth it.\" Bridget even managed to get last-minute tickets on the day for her Cardiff night and hopped on the train hours before the start time.\n\nShe said: \"I was underprepared. I got to the concert just as she got on stage.\"\n\nBridget can't wait to see Taylor Swift for the tenth time in August and has no regrets for spending her money on the superstar. She is now dancing every day on her TikTok until the day she meets Taylor Swift.\n\nShe has already met her mum and dad at a London gig and bumped into some of her back-up dancers in Milan.\n\nShe said: \"The tour has gone to end at some point. It's amazing just to go once.\n\n\"It just brings people together. 'I'm just trying to have fun.\"\n\nBridget's £5,370 spent on the Eras tour so far:"
