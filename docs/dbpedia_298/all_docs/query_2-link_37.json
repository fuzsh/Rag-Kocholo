        "text": "I watched it on my 27\" monitor in my pc/audio room and of all Hackett's concerts on disc I like this one the best.\n\nThe thing is, I was never a big Genesis fan back in the day when he played with them. But his concerts are certainly well put together and he and his fellow musicians play at a very high level. Blundell did a great job on the drum kit, I thought.\n\nAmanda Leyman - what can I say without sounding sexist but there's something definitely cool about a gal playing the guitar in such fine company. Good voice too.\n\nThis concert, or at least the one that made it to Blu Ray, shows the work put in by the musicians and audio folks (recording/mixing etc) to get it right.\n\n(I like Hackett's outings with Djabe as well. )\n\nDespite whatever I thought about Genesis in earlier days, I've become quite a fan of Hackett. If you are as well, don't pass this one up. Like @sjcorne said, Atmos would have been nice, but don't let that stifle your enjoyment.\n\nI watched it on my 27\" monitor in my pc/audio room and of all Hackett's concerts on disc I like this one the best.\n\nThe thing is, I was never a big Genesis fan back in the day when he played with them.

Like @sjcorne said, Atmos would have been nice, but don't let that stifle your enjoyment.\n\nShe is a very talented guitarist/vocalist and played with them when I saw them a couple of weeks ago. I only recently found out that she is Steve Hackett's wife's sister.\n\nOn that note, I will hold off purchasing this release, until the surround jury votes are in.\n\nI've played this release all the way through x 3, it's really good.\n\nThe mix is excellent, especially for a live show.\n\nThe show itself is fantastic, my brother and I had tickets to go and see it last year but personal circumstances meant we had to cancel.\n\nI can highly recommend this release to one and all.\n\nAnd many thanks to all those QQ'rs who have already praised this little gem...your words were eagerly anticipated.\n\nShe is a very talented guitarist/vocalist and played with them when I saw them a couple of weeks ago. I only recently found out that she is Steve Hackett's wife's sister.\n\nYes, his wonderful sister-in-law Amanda Lehmann, playing with them for more than a decade.\n\nShe always with her red guitar and her pimple on the right cheek of his face.\n\nThe best, her interpretation of \"Shadow of the Hierophant\" (Sally Oldfield put the voice in the original album theme). I prefer Amanda.\n\nI still miss Nick Beggs, for several years he is no longer with them. Also miss drummer Gary O'Toole. Craig Blundell is also good but he is more serious.\n\nWe saw them live at Madrid in 2017. My wife liked it and is still in love with Nad Sylvan (!)\n\nThis and some others Hackett \"Genesis Revisited\" Blu-rays are the only ones that my wife can stand for more than half an hour watching in the home theater.\n\nOrder this with CD universe for a cheap price, but it's back ordered since September. 8 more days and it will be canceled. I should have bought it from amazon ca because at least they have it in stock.\n\nNow they have it in stock, but it was a long time coming. I preordered the CD/DVD set from Amazon.ca months ago, and they kept moving the September release date later and later. Finally, Amazon's \"release date\" was pushed to October 28. Then, as usual with my Amazon preorders, it didn't ship on the release date. It just sat there while the product page showed that I could order it and it would arrive the next day with Prime. Not sure why this happens, but it happens on a regular basis. This time, however, it actually worked out in my favour. I noticed they had a CD/Blu-ray version (they didn't have that one available when I originally preordered it), and it was cheaper than the DVD set!! I cancelled my DVD preorder, ordered the Blu-ray, and had it the next day."
