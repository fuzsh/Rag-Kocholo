        "text": "The Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier reminds me of that Yamamoto Sound Craft A-08 45 power amplifier I owned close to twenty years ago. The Yamamoto may have been my favorite amplifier ever, and at the time I believed I would own it for the rest of my audiophile days. There was only one problem–it used 45 valves in the power stage for a grand total of two watts per channel. Just after I purchased the Yamamoto and its matching preamplifier (with phono) and a pair of SUTs, I started reviewing high-end audio gear professionally for the first time. I wouldn’t be able to test many speakers, however, and at the time there were only a couple of speakers I liked with that high of an efficiency–Zu Audio and Audio Note UK.\n\nWords and Photos by Marc Phillips\n\nI sold the Yamamoto gear, and it took me a long time to realize it was a profound mistake. It took forever to get me back in my listening zone, and I sometimes regard this time as my own Dark Ages–at least when it came to audio. But it wasn’t that profound of a mistake since I’m still reviewing. I got back on track.\n\nThat brings me to this lovely new beast that I’ve had in my listening room for way too many months, the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. 2 ($9,600 USD). The way it cast its spell reminds me of that Yamamoto, and again I’m confronted with a dilemma. The T-1500 uses a pair of 300B tubes in the output stage for a slightly more reasonable 10 watts per channel. While the two Yamamoto watts need a speaker that’s as close to 100dB sensitive as possible, with a nominal impedance of at least 8 ohms, the ten Allnic watts can pretty much deal with a speaker that has an efficiency of 90 dB or more. I’m aware that at this 10/90 split, the combination may or may not work–or at least excel. But in the world of SETs and high-efficiency speakers people like to say things like, “You won’t know if it’ll work if you don’t try.”\n\nDo you see the dilemma yet? If I didn’t have such a busy review calendar with such a wide variety of high-end audio components on hand I’d say something like, “No more amplifier and speaker reviews for me! I’m all set.” Or I could take that a step further and jump off the proverbial merry-go-round. That’s it everyone. I can either review all this other stuff, or I can be deliriously happy.\n\nInside the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II\n\nIntegrated amplifiers that use 300B valves and cost less than $10,000 aren’t that rare in high-end audio, but the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II is different because, well, it’s an Allnic. I’ve reviewed several Allnic products by now–the H-5500 and H-6500 phono preamplifiers, the T-2000 3oth Anniversary integrated and the ZL Mu-8R interconnects. The Allnic Audio H-10,000 OTL/OCL phono stage, which retails for $45K, arrived just after the T-1500 Mk. II. You might assume that I’m a big fan of Allnic in general, and you wouldn’t be wrong.\n\nThe single-ended Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II operates in pure class A, of course, using two 300B tubes in the output stage and a 6SL7 and a 6SN7 as the drive stage tubes–those two valves add 35 dB of gain to the amp. Having just four tubes gives the T-1500 a sleek and simple look, as opposed to the H-10,000, which sports a total of sixteen valves. (Even the H-6500 phono stage has a rectifier tube that’s hidden in the external power supply.) The Allnic website goes into more detail on the design:\n\n“Almost all other 300B amplifiers are under, and distortion, driven. This is a result of the use of conventional ‘Resister-Capacitor’ circuits, which give only up to around a 70V swing voltage, with high distortion. This means that an already distorted signal of a lower than optimum swing voltage is directed to the deep biased 300B grid. Allnic’s powerful ‘Inductor Drive’ circuit gives up to a 150V swing voltage, with very low distortion (about 0.3%). It is this drive delivered to the T-1500 MK2 that allows for a higher output (10w) with much less distortion than can be expected from standard 300B circuits.”\n\nThe Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II isn’t necessarily designed for purist audiophiles–it has many features that I found as compelling as the sound quality. (Okay, almost as compelling.) First of all, you can switch from 4 to 8 ohms via a simple toggle switch on the back panel. When you’re dealing with only ten watts per channel, that extra flexibility can open up the possibilities for more loudspeakers. Second, there is a balanced input, something I find useful because I’m always testing components that have either RCAs or XLRs. Finally, there’s a pre-out. That opens up another wealth of possibilities–for instance, I could use the wonderful GoldenEar T66 speakers with the powered subwoofer while evaluating the T-1500. (Which, of course, I did.)\n\nNothing else, aside from actually listening, will impress you as much as the sheer fit and finish on the T-1500. That goes for every single Allnic product I’ve tested, of course, but the gorgeous chassis–which is heavy, by the way–is machined with both precision and an eye toward aesthetics. It’s a beautiful amp, and from every single angle. From a practical standpoint, there is nothing I would add or subtract. Other than the power rating, which is still easier to overcome than I originally thought, there isn’t a thing I would change.\n\nAs with other Allnic designs, the T-1500 Mk. II is notable for its use of nickel alloy (Permalloy) output transformers, which contributes to the signature Allnic sound–steady, linear but with just enough warmth to remind you that yes, this is a 300B amp.\n\n“Because of their extremely high initial permeability, it is possible to use fewer turns on the primary winding while retaining very high ‘open circuit inductance.’ That means a resulting very wide frequency range and low distortion bass response. This is another reason why the T-1500 MK2 excels over other 300B integrated amplifiers. Allnic also uses a very big nickel core, so as not to be magnetically saturated at a high current level of 100mA.”\n\nThis isn’t a stripped-down SET that harkens back to the good old days when 300Bs first appeared, but rather a modern and sophisticated design built to last many years. The Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II features a soft-start circuit that allows the high voltage to engage only after the 300Bs have warmed up. There’s a self-bias control grid, and there are two of those nifty Allnic current meters to monitor how each tube is performing. The T-1500 Mk. II also uses about -6 dB of negative feedback in order to increase the “driving power” of the amp, and to create a high damping factor along with very low distortion. Finally, the T-1500 Mk. II uses a high-quality 41-step attenuator that uses silver contacts and can be controlled by the solid aluminum remote control.\n\nThe Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier is available in silver and black. I gave my stock answer to John Ketcham of Kevalin Audio, the US importer, when he asked which color I wanted: My personal choice is black, but silver photographs better. So far my Allnic reviews have been evenly split between the two finishes, and the T-1500 indeed arrived in black.\n\nSet-Up\n\nI’d planned for the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. 2 in advance for a few months. By the time John Ketcham of Kevalin Audio was ready to ship, I suddenly started worrying about speakers. I looked at everything in the house, which happened to be a lot, but I started noticing that I’ve gotten accustomed to loudspeakers with fair to middlin’ efficiency ratings, everything from 83 to 87 dB.\n\nI did have one speaker that qualified as efficient, and that was the $5,498/pr Audio Note UK AN-J/D Hemp speakers I reviewed last year. The AN-J has an efficiency of 93 dB, perfect for the Allnic. There was one minor problem–in my new listening room, I don’t have the side and rear walls coming together at right angles. So that magical and somewhat idiosyncratic Audio Note UK speaker placement along the side walls couldn’t be implemented. But if you go back to my review of the AN-J, you’ll see where I started off with a more conventional set-up and still enjoyed the results. So the Audio Note UK AN-J became the first speaker I used with the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk II.\n\nThe second pair of speakers came about almost by accident. The $6,500/pr Alexandria Audio The Monitors were in the house, and they look like a typical two-way bookshelf monitor although they are slightly bigger than average and have an 8″ woofer, just like the Audio Note UK AN-Js. I’d been reviewing them for a little while and I thought they were pretty decent, but one day I noticed the words “90 dB” on the back panel and I instantly thought, “Bring on the Allnic.” They were the second pair of speakers I used with the T-1500.\n\nFinally, the $49K/pr Songer Audio S2 field coil loudspeakers waltzed right into my listening room and suddenly I was rethinking all my hi-fi sensibilities. Isn’t this what I really want after all? The Songer and Allnic combo was more than a synergistic match, and while I quietly lamented about my inability to spend $50,000 on a pair of speakers, I glanced back over my shoulder at the Allnic Audio T-1500 and I said, “$9,600, huh?”\n\nOne more quick system configuration–when Gary Koh of Genesis Advanced Technologies dropped off his new G7 Minuet loudspeakers ($8,000/pr), which are 87 dB with a 4-ohm impedance, I commented that it was too bad I couldn’t use the Allnic with them. Gary demurred, repeating that SET-lover’s canard of “You won’t know unless you try.” And try we did, and the combination worked incredibly well. Two watts per channel may be limiting when it comes to speaker choices, but ten watts per channel can take you further down the road than you think.\n\nOne more thing–I suppose I should mention tube-rolling. John Ketcham of Kevalin Audio has been very proactive when it comes to sending me additional tubes during an Allnic review. Plus, I know 300B enthusiasts love to tube-roll. While the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II was sent with a pair of JJ 300Bs, which performed beautifully, I’d probably pull the trigger on some Western Electrics–especially since they are, once again, plentiful and not as dear as the old NOS stock that was increasingly considered as “priceless.”\n\nJohn did arrange for me to try two different sets of 300B tubes during the review period, and that’s when I learned a new thing or two about 300Bs. The first pair taught me that there is more than one way to pin a 300B. I tried to insert the valves into the sockets and they just wouldn’t line up–the four pins were too thick and they were spaced too far apart. It was then explained to me that there are two pin-outs, one for Europe and another for the US. John sent me another set of 300Bs to try, and they were beautiful enough for me to take many photographs of them. The day before I planned to install them and compare the results, I received an email from the manufacturer that said DO NOT USE THESE TUBES. I don’t have a lot of details on the reasons, but I was assured that a new set of tubes would be sent. The silver lining, of course, is that I’ll post the results in a follow-up, and that means I get to hold onto the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II just a little longer–if that’s okay with everyone. (Plus, I really want to review that astonishing H-10,000 OTL/OCL phono pre with as much Allnic in the system as possible.\n\nAllnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II Sound\n\nHere’s what happened the first time I sat down and listened to the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier, with the Audio Note UK AN-Js. I smiled. A lot. I’d been waiting to listen to a modern 300B amplifier in my own system for quite some time, and it was everything I hoped it would be. The first thing I noticed, of course, was that sublime amount of warmth that acted as more of a foundation for everything else in the sound, as opposed to warmth that is applied as an afterthought, like chocolate jimmies.\n\nIt’s funny, but I tend to know that an amplifier is “right for me” within a few minutes after plugging it in and playing the first track. Break-in aside, which is easy to “hear around” if you’re used to it, I react immediately. I experienced this with the Lab12 Integre4 integrated amplifier, as well as the Audio Note UK Cobra integrated/DAC, that sense of coming home to a sound that is perfect for me and my audiophile priorities. In a way, it’s the sound I always pursue in this hobby–a warmth that immediately provides an entry point for emotional connection to the music, combined with a wealth of detail that isn’t limited at the frequency extremes, a common complaint about classic tube amplification.\n\nThe Allnic Audio T-1500 met those personal standards with aplomb. Where it exceeded my expectations, even for 300B amps, was its ability to marry that warmth with an added measure of texture and richness. It’s audio Technicolor in the sense that all kinds of music suddenly become more interesting and informative. You see more, so to speak. At the same time, that additional information is shrouded in the most comfortable clothes imaginable, so instead of reacting to all the bright colors and getting overwhelmed, I was consistent pulled into the music. With the Songer Audio S2s, which were obviously my favorite loudspeakers to use with the T-1500, this system excelled at making everyone in the room shut up and just listen.\n\nThat reminds me of Ken Songer’s reaction to the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II amplifier when it was finally connected to the S2s and music started playing. I was sitting in my listening chair, and he was standing off-axis. We switched places, and I saw the expression on his face change drastically. At first he could only manage to say, “Oh.” Finally, he felt confident that his babies were in good hands, and when he came to collect the S2s a few weeks later he told me that he wanted to buy an Allnic for himself. I don’t blame him.\n\nListening Sessions\n\nI suppose this is where I make the case for the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier, and why you should consider buying one. Over the last few months, the T-1500 has had to take turns with the Burmester 909 MK5 power amplifier and the 088 preamplifier. I can’t really compare the two sets of amplification, one at less than $10K and the other at $113K, but as I mentioned in the Burmester review the two systems had more in common than not. Burmester gear has that surprising warmth as well, coupled to that same keen sense of resolution. But I can think of one difference between them–I can remember every single moment with the Burmester gear, and I took copious notes during the review period. With the Allnic in the system, it’s all a sweet, sweet blur. For some reason, quite obvious by now, the Allnic Audio T-1500 consistently swept me off my feet.\n\nI will say, in advance, that the differences between the scale of the Burmesters with the YG Acoustics Sonja 3.3 loudspeakers vs. the Allnic and the Songer S2s did affect my musical choices. The Burmester and YG combo made me want to play big and loud. It’s been some time since I had a pair of speakers that could reach down to 20 Hz, so I listened to a lot of big music. With the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II and the Songers (as well as the Alexandria Audios), however, I started diving into my favorite jazz reissues from Analogue Productions such as Dean Martin’s Dream with Dean, Billie Holliday’s Songs for Distingue Lovers, Nina Simone’s Little Girl Blue and Ella Fitzgerald’s Clap Hands Here Comes Charlie.\n\nThis is music that was custom-made for a 300B amp, and vice versa. The trick to listening these superb jazz reissues is to drop all pretexts of listening to a recording that has been brought up to modern standards, and to discover a rare capture of a moment in time long ago. The Allnic offered such clear optics into the recording processes back then, the way the microphones were set, or maybe techniques used in the mix that were optimized for the playback devices of the time. Many amplifiers can outline those details and make you understand what’s happening without allowing the music to engage your soul. With the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II, the system quietly informed me that this is how the music sounded on the day it was made, and this is what the producers wanted you to hear. And back then, in the early days of stereo, there were many geniuses who knew that one day the playback chains would improve exponentially and that these recordings would be discovered by entirely new generations.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II is merely the perfect amp for vintage recordings. On modern recordings, such as Hilary Hahn’s Eclipse, the Allnic specialized in defining specific layers of the orchestra so that I could instantly see the orchestra and where everyone was sitting. Then those layers started to flow and intersect throughout the soundstage, reinforcing that idea that an orchestra is all about timing and space, and how everything fits together the right way. During Hilary’s take on Sarasata’s Carmen Fantasy, there are plenty of sounds coming in from different parts of the soundstage, and at different volumes, so it’s easy for the sound to be confused in lesser hands. The Allnic, in my mind, is responsible for that stunning flow, that feeling that so much effort was put into a performance that sounds utterly natural and, well, effortless.\n\nTube amps, especially SETs, are often criticized for having loose or flabby bass. Since the Songer S2s were already quite adept at handling deep bass, deeper than expected, the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II kept up the pace. Bass was full and deep, perhaps not as deep as with the 600wpc Burmester 909, but still satisfying. (I couldn’t test the Allnic with the YG Acoustics Sonja 3.2, a speaker than needs at least 100wpc to strut its stuff.) Both “Yulunga” from Dead Can Dance’s Into the Labyrinth and the title track from Radiohead’s Kid A delivered those deepest bass notes intact, and in three dimensions. As far as treble extension goes, I think the T-1500’s ability to preserve so much detail and so much air within a sandwich of warmth attests to the ability to reproduce high frequencies that quickly dispels all those rumors that low-powered SET amps only get the middle right.\n\nAs I said, I wouldn’t change a thing. I think that’s remarkable since we’re talking about a 10wpc integrated amplifier. But for every 300B fan out there who might have heard my past complaints about the limitations of SETs, I humbly apologize. You were right.\n\nAllnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II Conclusions\n\nAs the dust settled, I realized that I had the same dilemma as I did with the Yamamoto Sound Craft amps twenty years ago. Ten watts per channel is still an issue when I’m a reviewer who needs to be prepared for any loudspeaker that may come down the pike. But I have that same sense of longing, almost to the point where I regret that I’m not a civilian, and if I was I’d be keeping this extraordinary amp and I’d be done with finding something better.\n\nI could go the two-system route, where I have the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier for more efficient speakers and another amp for when more than ten watts per channel is required. Then I’d have to constantly search for the right speakers. (Or I’d be looking for a way to buy those Songer Audio S2s, which was one half of an amp-speaker partnership for the ages.) Or I could just retire now and do what’s right for me.\n\nThat’s how compelling of an amplifier this is–as Dave McNair once wrote in a review for us, it’s the marrying kind. It’s also less than $10K, which qualifies it as a screaming bargain on top of all the rest. The T-2000 that I reviewed a couple of years ago seems a little more fitting for my purpose in life, even though it’s $5K more than the T-1500. You get a beefier amp that offers 60 watts per channel in triode mode, and 120 in ultralinear, so that makes perfect sense as a reviewer. I loved the way it sounded, too. But the Allnic Audio T-1500 Mk. II integrated amplifier made more of an immediate and profound impression on me. It didn’t just sound good to me, it raced across a crowded room when it saw me, and it leapt into my arms and showered me with kisses while the orchestra struck up Etta James.\n\nWe all need an amp like that in our lives. Highly recommended, if you hadn’t already guessed."
