        "text": "The term “ophiolite” was first used in 1813 by a French mineralogist, Alexandre Brongniart (1770–1847), in reference to serpentinites in mélanges; he subsequently redefined his definition of an ophiolite (Brongniart,1821) to include a suite of magmatic rocks (ultramafic rocks, gabbro, diabase, and volcanic rocks) occurring in the Apennines. Gustav Steinmann (1856–1929) elevated the “ophiolite” term to a new concept by defining ophiolites as spatially associated kindred rocks that originally formed as in situ intrusions in axial parts of geosynclines (Steinmann, 1927). Steinmann emphasized the common occurrence of peridotite (serpentinite), gabbro, and diabase-spilite, in association with deep-sea sedimentary rocks in the Mediterranean mountain chains and interpreted the origin of these rocks as differentiated magmatic units evolved on the ocean floor. He considered these rock assemblages to have developed from a consanguineous igneous process during the evolution of eugeosynclines. This interpretation subsequently led to the widely known notion of the “Steinmann trinity.”\n\nAlthough Steinmann considered peridotite, gabbro, diabase, and volcanic rocks in ophiolites as comagmatic in origin, his observation that gabbroic and diabasic rocks were intrusive bodies in the serpentinized peridotites is an extremely important one because it differs from the contemporary interpretation of the “Penrose-type” ophiolite. It implies that, at least in the Apennine ophiolites, the gabbros and volcanic rocks are younger than the peridotites. Steinmann also correctly interpreted the ophiolites in the Northern Apennines as thrust sheets tectonically overlying the Tertiary sedimentary rocks in Tuscany (Steinmann, 1913). This interpretation led to the discovery of allochthonous nappe sequences in the Alpine-Apennine orogenic system.\n\nThayer (1967) discussed the significance of the consanguineous relationship between ultramafic and associated mafic rocks in alpine-type peridotites, which were defined by Benson (1926) earlier, and explained how the gabbro, diabase, and other leucocratic rocks in alpine-type peridotites could have originated from a single primary peridotitic magma. Jackson and Thayer (1972) subsequently distinguished harzburgite-type versus lherzolite-type alpine peridotites. In this subgrouping, the harzburgite-type alpine peridotites represent the uppermost oceanic mantle, whereas the less-depleted lherzolite-type alpine peridotites correspond to the subcontinental mantle and/or to the deeper oceanic mantle, where partial melting is much less intense. Recent studies of ophiolites have shown that both harzburgite- and lherzolite-type peridotites may occur in ophiolites, and that they can be used to classify ophiolite types and their inferred spreading rates of formation in an oceanic setting (Ishiwatari, 1985; Boudier and Nicolas, 1985; Nicolas and Boudier, 2003).\n\nIn his classic paper published in Crust of the Earth (Geological Society of America Special Paper 62), Hess (1955, p. 393) stated that Steinmann's ophiolite concept was confusing because “it obscured critical relationships of its [ophiolite] various members to the tectonic cycle.” Recognizing the importance of serpentinites and alpine-type peridotites in orogeny and mountain-building episodes, he argued that serpentinites and rocks of Steinmann's trinity are common in island arcs and that “island arcs represent an early stage in the development of an alpine-type of mountain system” (p. 395). Hess was, therefore, advocating an island-arc origin of mafic-ultramafic rock assemblages and serpentinized peridotites found in orogenic belts. This was nearly 20 yr before Miyashiro (1973) made the first formal and rather controversial call on the island-arc origin of the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus), connecting ophiolite genesis to subduction-zone processes.\n\nHess discussed in his 1962 paper that the main oceanic crustal layer (his layer 3) along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was made largely of serpentinite (his Fig. 2, p. 603; Hess 1962), and that the seismic velocity of this layer would be highly variable, depending on the magnitude of serpentinization of the peridotite. He proposed that the interface between the oceanic crust (composed mainly of serpentinite) and the underlying peridotite with seismic velocities of 7.4 km/s represented the Moho discontinuity. Since he had interpreted serpentinites as hydrated peridotites, Hess described the Moho beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge as an alteration front (phase transition) rather than a sharp boundary separating the igneous crust from the underlying mantle (his Fig. 7, p. 612). Although we now know that oceanic crust is not made of 70% serpentinite, marine geological and geophysical studies have documented that the slow-spreading oceanic crust along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has a highly heterogeneous lithological composition and thickness (Dick, 1989). For example, thin-crust domains along the ridge axis (i.e., magma-poor segment ends) consist of tectonically uplifted ultramafic rocks with gabbroic intrusions and a thin basaltic cover (Cannat et al., 1995). This nonuniform thickness and the heterogeneous lithostratigraphy of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge crust are remarkably similar to Steinmann's description of the Ligurian ophiolites in the Apennines. It also largely corresponds to Hess’ characterization of oceanic crust developed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This “Hess-type crust” differs significantly from “Penrose-type” oceanic crust in terms of its internal architecture, as discussed in the following.\n\nThe Dutch geologist de Roever (1957) reinterpreted the Steinmann trinity to result of mantle melting, producing the basaltic rocks on top and the residual ultramafic rocks at the bottom. Subsequently, the Swiss petrologist Vuagnat argued that the peridotite massifs in ophiolites were partial melting residues in the upper mantle (Vuagnat, 1964), because he thought that the overwhelming abundance of ultramafic rocks in ophiolites compared to the small volumetric occurrence of gabbroic rocks could not simply be explained by differentiation of submarine outpourings of basaltic magma. It is important to note that these two papers by de Roever (1957) and (Vuagnat, 1964) mark in the literature the beginning of a significant shift in Steinmann's “cogenetic” ophiolite concept and of a new paradigm in oceanic crustal evolution.\n\nRecognition of extensional sheeted dike complexes, the existence of a refractory mantle unit represented by harzburgitic peridotites with high-temperature deformation fabrics, fossil magma chambers in plutonic sequences, and the allochthonous nature of ophiolites by the mid-1960s was instrumental in the formulation of the ophiolite model and the ophiolite–ocean crust analogy within the framework of the new plate-tectonic theory. The ophiolite suite became an ideal analogue to explain the seismic velocity structure of modern oceanic lithosphere, as more seismic data became available from modern ocean basins, particularly from the Pacific Ocean. Combined with observations from the Troodos (Cyprus) and Semail (Oman) ophiolites in particular, the seismic velocity structure of modern oceanic crust and its inferred layer-cake pseudostratigraphy came to be known as the “ophiolite model.” This analogy was confirmed at the first Penrose Conference on ophiolites in 1972 (Anonymous, 1972), whereby an ideal ophiolite sequence was defined to have a layer-cake pseudostratigraphy complete with a sheeted dike complex as a result of seafloor spreading. Ophiolites were interpreted to have developed mainly at ancient mid-ocean ridges through this model. In a uniformitarian approach, ophiolite geologists then started reconstructing the evolution of fossil oceanic lithosphere exposed on land as a product of paleo–mid-ocean ridges using the ophiolite–ocean crust analogy (Gass, 1968; Coleman, 1971; Moores and Vine, 1971; Cann, 2003, and references therein).\n\nGeochemical studies challenged this view of a mid-ocean-ridge origin of ophiolites as early as the beginning of the 1970s, and suggested the association of magma evolution with subduction zones. Miyashiro (1973, p. 218) argued that “about one-third of the analyzed rocks of the lower pillow lavas and sheeted dike rocks in the Troodos ophiolite follows a calc-alkalic trend,” suggesting that “the massif was created as a basaltic volcano in an island arc with a relatively thin ocean-type crust rather than in a mid-oceanic ridge.” This was the first formal proposal of a subduction-zone origin of the Troodos “oceanic crust” that questioned the “ruling hypothesis” of a mid-ocean-ridge setting of ophiolite genesis. Miyashiro's geochemical argument on the island-arc origin of the Troodos ophiolite would start a major paradigm shift in the ophiolite concept in the wake of the plate-tectonic revolution. The subsequent scientific exchange in the form of discussions and replies to Miyashiro's 1973 paper initiated a long-lasting debate about the tectonic setting of ophiolite genesis. Pearce (1975) proposed a marginal basin origin for the Troodos massif during the evolution of an incipient submarine island arc.\n\nFindings from modern subduction-zone environments in the western Pacific prompted researchers to consider more rigorously the evolution of ophiolites in spreading environments within the upper plate of subduction zones (Hawkins, 1977, 2003; Pearce, 2003). This development, which came about as a collective result of ophiolite studies on land and marine geological and geophysical investigations in modern convergent margin settings in the oceans, led to the definition of suprasubduction-zone ophiolites in the early 1980s (Pearce et al., 1984). The forearc environment of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc-trench system is today one of the best studied (through deep-ocean drilling and submersible diving surveys) and best understood modern suprasubduction zones that we consider to be a contemporary suprasubduction-zone ophiolite factory (Fig. 1; Stern et al., 1989; Stern and Bloomer, 1992; Reagan et al., 2010; Dilek and Furnes, 2010). Systematic petrological and geochemical investigations of world ophiolites throughout the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated the significance of subduction-zone–derived fluids and melting history in development of ophiolitic magmas (Saunders and Tarney, 1984; Rautenschlein et al., 1985; Hébert and Laurent, 1990; Thy and Xenophontos, 1991; Beccaluva et al., 1994; Bédard et al., 1998; Dilek et al., 1999; Shervais, 2000; Dilek and Flower, 2003). Forearc, embryonic arc, and backarc settings in suprasubduction zones became the most widely accepted tectonic environments of origin.\n\nThe distribution of ophiolites in orogenic belts shows spatial and temporal patterns (Fig. 1), and the clusters of ophiolites with particular age ranges in different orogenic belts mark clear pulses, reflecting peak times of ophiolite genesis and emplacement in Earth history (Fig. 2). Some of the main ophiolite pulses overlap in time with major orogenic events that led to the construction of supercontinents. Examples include the Famatinian (Fmt) and Caledonian (Cld; Baltica- Laurentia collision) orogens in the early Paleozoic, which collectively formed the Gondwana and Laurasia supercontinents, and the Appalachian-Hercynian (Ap-Hy) and Altaid-Uralian (Al-Ur) orogens later in the Paleozoic, which built the Pangean supercontinent (Fig. 2; Moores et al., 2000). The sequential collisions of India (In‑Eu) and Arabia (Ar-Eu) with Eurasia during the Neogene, after the emplacement of Neotethyan ophiolites and elimination of the Neotethyan seaways by subduction, are part of the current assembly of a new supercontinent that has been taking place since the Paleogene.\n\nPaleozoic ophiolites in the Appalachian-Caledonian orogenic belts (Fig. 1) developed in the Iapetus Ocean and its seaways between North America and Baltica-Avalonia (van Staal et al., 2009, and references therein). Ophiolites in Iberia, central Europe, and northwestern Africa evolved in the Rheic Ocean between Baltica-Avalonia and Gondwana continental masses (Nance et al., 2010; Murphy et al., 2010, and references therein). The Paleozoic ophiolites in the Uralides and the Altaids in central Asia are the remnants of the Pleionic Ocean, which evolved between the Baltica–Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan-Siberian continental masses (Brown et al., 2006; Windley et al., 2002; Xiao et al., 2004). The Jurassic–Cretaceous ophiolites of the Tethyan Ocean systems extend from the Betic-Rif and Pyrenees in the west through the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belts in the center to the Indonesian region in the east (Fig. 1; Hall, 1997; Pubellier et al., 2004; Bortolotti and Principi, 2005). The Phanerozoic ophiolites in these collisional orogenic belts (i.e., Appalachian, Caledonides, Uralides, and Altaids in central Asia, Betic-Rif and Pyrenees, Alpine-Himalayan) commonly show mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) to island-arc tholeiite (IAT) and boninitic geochemical affinities (Varfalvy et al., 1997; Bédard et al., 1998; Spadea and D'Antonio, 2006; Pagé et al., 2009). The ophiolites in the accretionary-type Western Pacific and Cordilleran orogenic belts are slivers of abyssal peridotites and volcanic ocean islands, seamounts, and mid-ocean-ridge crust scraped off from downgoing plates, and they are commonly associated with accretionary mélanges and high-pressure metamorphic rocks (Cloos, 1982; Wakabayashi, 1999; Ernst, 2005; Ring, 2008; Hall, 2009; Cawood et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2010).\n\nThe principal ophiolite pulses during the last 250 m.y. coincide with the emplacement of plume-related large igneous provinces (LIPs) and giant dike swarms (Ernst et al., 1995; Yale and Carpenter, 1998; Coffin and Eldholm, 2001) and collectively mark supermagmatic events in Earth history (Fig. 2). The enhanced large igneous province formation and ophiolite generation in the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous are particularly noteworthy (Vaughan and Scarrow, 2003). The evolution of the Tethyan and Caribbean ophiolites overlapped with the Cretaceous “superplume” event (120–80 Ma), which was responsible for the formation of oceanic plateaus in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, high global sea levels, and increased rates of seafloor spreading (Larson, 1991). The Jurassic–Cretaceous peri-Caribbean ophiolites (Fig. 1) include remnants of proto-Caribbean oceanic crust and the Caribbean–Colombian oceanic plateau (Kerr et al., 1998) and display a complex record of igneous activity associated with continental rifting, seafloor spreading, the construction of an oceanic plateau, and the development of island arcs (Giunta and Oliveri, 2009; Kerr et al., 2009). The most prominent ophiolite pulse during the Mesozoic coincided with the breakup of Pangea through discrete episodes of continental rifting during the Late Triassic and Jurassic (Fig. 2; Dalziel et al., 2000).\n\nContinental margin (CM) ophiolites form during the early stages of ocean basin evolution, following initial continental breakup. These ophiolites are fragments of magma-poor, ocean-continent transitions (OCT). Modern, in situ ocean-continent transitions include the Iberia and Red Sea–Western Arabia rifted margins (Fig. 1). Some classic examples of continental margin ophiolites include the Jurassic ophiolites in the Northern Apennines (Ligurian) and the western Alps (Caby, 1995; Rampone et al., 2005; Manatschal and Müntener, 2009). These ophiolites consist of exhumed, subcontinental lithospheric mantle lherzolite directly overlain by basaltic lavas and intruded by small gabbroic plutons and rare mafic dikes. The crustal rocks display normal (N) MORB geochemical signatures. Continental margin ophiolites correspond to the lherzolite-type (LOT) ophiolites of Ishiwatari (1985) and Boudier and Nicolas (1985) and are the products of low degrees of melting of less-depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle and upwelling asthenosphere (Rampone et al., 2005).\n\nMid-ocean-ridge (MOR) ophiolites may form at plume-proximal (e.g., Iceland) and plume-distal mid-ocean ridges, trench-proximal mid-ocean ridges, or trench-distal backarc spreading ridges (Table 2). They generally have a Penrose-type structural architecture (particularly at the centers of ridge segments) and show N-MORB (e.g., Argolis-Pindos in Greece), enriched (E) MORB (e.g., Macquarie Island), and/or contaminated (C) MORB geochemical affinities. N-MORB and E-MORB ophiolites have compositions that are more depleted and more enriched, respectively, than primitive mantle–derived magmas (Pearce, 2008). C-MORB ophiolites are crustally contaminated. The Taitao ophiolite in Chile (Fig. 1), which formed at a trench-proximal Chile Rise (Karsten et al., 1996), is a type example of C-MORB ophiolite. It was emplaced into the South American continental margin as a result of a ridge-trench collision (Anma et al., 2009). Mid-ocean-ridge ophiolites, in general, correspond to class II and III types in Miyashiro's (1975) classification of ophiolites based on the presence of tholeiitic and alkaline volcanic rocks.\n\nPlume-type (P) ophiolites may form close to plume-proximal spreading ridges and as part of oceanic plateaus (e.g., Caribbean Plateau; Kerr et al., 2009). They have thick plutonic and volcanic sequences (Coffin and Eldholm, 2001; Kerr et al., 2009), and show depleted (D‑MORB) to enriched (E-MORB) trace-element patterns (Pearce, 2008).\n\nSuprasubduction-zone (SSZ) ophiolites (e.g., Mirdita, Albania; Samail, Oman; Troodos, Cyprus; Fig. 1) form in the extending upper plates of subduction zones, as in the modern Izu-Bonin-Mariana and Tonga-Kermadec arc-trench rollback systems (Fig. 1; Hawkins, 2003; Reagan et al., 2010). They may evolve in extending, embryonic backarc to forearc environments (BA-FA), forearc settings (FA), and both oceanic and continental backarc basins (OBA and CBA, respectively; Table 2). The Rocas Verdes ophiolites in southern Chile are the best examples of suprasubduction-zone continental backarc basin ophiolites (Saunders et al., 1979; Stern and de Wit, 2003). Suprasubduction-zone ophiolites commonly have a Penrose-type structural architecture and may show a MORB–IAT–boninitic geochemical sequence of igneous activity. Suprasubduction-zone forearc ophiolites result from oceanic crust generation during the closure of ocean basins and mark major subduction initiation events (Casey and Dewey, 1984; Dilek and Furnes, 2010; Pearce and Robinson, 2010). The age range among their various ophiolitic subunits is commonly less than 10 m.y. (Dilek and Furnes, 2009). They correspond to the class I ophiolites of Miyashiro (1975) and harzburgite-type (HOT) ophiolites of Ishiwatari (1985) and Boudier and Nicolas (1985), which are the products of high degrees of melting of depleted, harzburgitic mantle. Both suprasubduction-zone oceanic backarc basin and continental backarc basin ophiolites form as a result of seafloor spreading in “ensimatic” and “ensialic” settings (respectively).\n\nVolcanic-arc (VA) ophiolites form in ensimatic arc settings (e.g., the Philippines, SE Asia; Sierra Nevada, California). They have a polygenetic crustal architecture with a deformed, older oceanic basement, mafic lower crust composed of gabbroic plutons and hypabyssal intrusions, moderately to well-developed dioritic-tonalitic middle crust, andesitic to rhyolitic extrusive rocks and dikes (locally sheeted) forming the upper crust, and volcaniclastic cover (locally subaerial). These crustal units display tholeiitic to calc-alkaline geochemical signatures. Volcanic-arc ophiolites differ from suprasubduction-zone ophiolites based on their thicker and more fully developed arc crust with calc-alkaline compositions. The age range among various ophiolitic subunits in volcanic-arc ophiolites can be longer than 20–30 m.y. (Dilek et al., 1991).\n\nAccretionary-type ophiolites, occurring in subduction-accretion complexes of active margins, contain fragments of any of the previously outlined ophiolite types and are locally associated with pelagic-hemipelagic sedimentary rocks and trench-fill sediments that may have been deposited on them prior to and after their incorporation into the accretionary prism. These ophiolites may have diverse lithological assemblages, metamorphic grades, styles of deformation, and chemical affinities with no genetic links between them, since they consist of tectonic slices of oceanic rocks scraped off from downgoing plates (e.g., Mineoka ophiolite in central Japan; Ogawa and Takahashi, 2004). They become progressively younger in age structurally downward within subduction-accretion complexes. We do not treat these ophiolites separately in our discussion here because they do not show a distinctive lithological construction, and hence they lack a unique geochemical fingerprint.\n\nWe use a selection of diagrams to characterize the geochemical signatures of some well-preserved examples of the types of ophiolites distinguished here. These diagrams are based on an extensive database (compiled from our own analytical work and the extant literature) that is summarized in Table 2. The literature we used in our ophiolite classification and geochemical-tectonic fingerprinting is presented in the GSA Data Repository.1\n\nSince lavas and dikes in ophiolites are, in general, subject to various degrees of hydrothermal alteration and greenschist- to amphibolites-facies metamorphism in intra-oceanic conditions, it is important to use elements that are relatively stable during such processes in order for us to determine their primary geochemical compositions. Several studies have been carried out on the element behavior of magmatic rocks that were variably altered and metamorphosed. In general, the mobility of an element relates to the water-rock interactions during reaction (e.g., Bickle and Teagle, 1992). Low-temperature experimental studies of reaction between basalt and seawater have demonstrated minor leaching of Fe and Si and enrichment of Na and Mg; on the other hand, Al, Ti, and P are the least mobile elements, and Ca is variably depleted (Scott and Hajash, 1976; Seyfried et al., 1978). The trace elements Y, Zr, Nb, V, Cr, Co, Ni, rare earth elements (REEs), Th, and Ta are generally relatively immobile (Coish, 1977; Hellman et al., 1979; Shervais, 1982; Seyfried and Mottl, 1982; Dickin and Jones, 1983; Dungan et al., 1983; Mottl, 1983; Staudigel and Hart, 1983; Seyfried et al., 1988; Gillis and Thompson, 1993). A study on the behavior of transition metals (Ti, V, Ni, Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn) and Mg in metabasic rocks suggests relatively little mobility during medium to high degrees of metamorphism (Nicollet and Andriambololona, 1980). During hydrothermal alteration of basaltic pillow lavas, Ba shows variable alteration trends (Humphris and Thompson, 1978), and Pb becomes moderately to strongly depleted (Teagle and Alt, 2004). Alteration (palagonitization) of the glass rind of pillow lavas results in enrichment of K, Rb, and Cs, particularly the latter two (Hart, 1969; Staudigel and Hart, 1983). Therefore, we paid particular attention in constructing the geochemical diagrams presented here to use those elements that are relatively stable during hydrothermal alteration.\n\nIn Bowen diagrams (Fig. 3) demonstrating the compositional variability in upper-crustal units (lavas and dikes), the subduction-related suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolites show larger variability in SiO2 and TiO2 at given MgO contents than the subduction-unrelated continental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites. The highest variability with respect to these two elements is represented by the suprasubduction-zone backarc- to forearc-type ophiolites, whereas the suprasubduction-zone forearc-type ophiolites show invariably low TiO2 (Fig. 3B). The largest spread in MgO is exhibited by the subduction-unrelated plume-type ophiolites (Fig. 3A). In MORB-normalized multi-element diagrams, the continental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites display flat patterns between V and Zr, and an increase toward the most incompatible elements (i.e., Ba, Rb, Cs; Fig. 4A). In the same multi-element diagrams, the patterns of the suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolites display much larger variability; they are generally enriched in the most incompatible, nonconservative elements (Cs, Rb, Th) and show generally negative Ta and Nb and positive Pb and Sr anomalies (Fig. 4B).\n\nIn a Ti-V discrimination diagram (Shervais, 1982), the continental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites straddle the field defined by the ratios between 20 and 50, typical of mid-ocean-ridge basalts (Fig. 5A), whereas the suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolites show a wider scatter of Ti/V ratios between <10 and >50 (Fig. 5B). However, the subtypes of both the subduction-related and subduction-unrelated ophiolites demonstrate pronounced differences in their Ti-V distributions. For the subduction-unrelated types, the Ti-V data of the lavas and dikes for the plume subtype hardly overlap with those of the continental margin and mid-ocean-ridge trench-proximal subtypes (Fig. 5A). Similarly, for the subduction-related ophiolite types, the mafic lavas and dikes of the suprasubduction-zone forearc subtype exclusively plot in the boninite field and do not overlap with those of the suprasubduction-zone oceanic backarc basin subtype (Fig. 5B). By far, the suprasubduction-zone backarc to forearc subtype shows the largest range in the Ti-V diagram (Fig. 5B). This dispersion of Ti/V ratios is a result of a large geochemical range from boninite and island-arc tholeiite to MORB magmas that occur in subduction-influenced igneous systems (Shervais, 1982; Dilek et al., 2007; Dilek and Furnes, 2009).\n\nIn the Nb/Yb versus Th/Yb diagram (Pearce, 2008), the lavas and dikes of the continental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites plot within the mantle array (Fig. 6A), whereas those of the suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolites show a significant shift away from this mantle array, toward the subduction-related Mariana arc field (Fig. 6B). These five elements (Ti, V, Th, Yb, Nb), which we have used in discriminating possible tectonic settings of ophiolitic magma generation, are most immobile during metamorphism and alteration; therefore, they are most reliable as proxies to differentiate between subduction-related and other magmas (Shervais, 1982; Pearce, 2008), particularly when utilized together with other informative geochemical techniques and field-oriented regional tectonic constraints.\n\nGeochemical characterization of different types of ophiolites allows us to distinguish two major groups, one related to or least influenced by subduction-zone processes and the other unrelated to subduction zones. The suprasubduction-zone ophiolites that formed in backarc and incipient arc–forearc tectonic environments (e.g., Mirdita, Albania—Dilek et al., 2007, 2008; Troodos, Cyprus—Robinson et al., 2003; Pearce and Robinson, 2010), in a forearc setting (e.g., Betts Cove, Canada—Bédard, 1999), and as a volcanic arc (e.g., Smartville, California—Dilek et al., 1991) display the most pronounced variations in geochemical patterns. On the other hand, trench-distal backarc ophiolites that formed in oceanic or continental settings, e.g., the Solund-Stavfjord ophiolite in West Norway (Furnes et al., 2006) and the Rocas Verdes ophiolites in the southernmost Andes, Chile (Saunders et al., 1979; Stern and De Wit, 2003), show weaker geochemical evidence of subduction. The groups of ophiolites that are entirely unrelated to subduction processes are the continental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites.\n\nFigure 7 depicts the petrogenesis of subduction-related and subduction-unrelated types of ophiolites in different tectonic settings. The petrogenesis of a subduction-unrelated continental margin ophiolite involves slow exhumation and limited partial melting of subcontinental mantle lherzolite (Fig. 8A) and upwelling asthenosphere in response to lithospheric extension and continental rifting (Fig. 7A1; Rampone et al., 2005; Piccardo et al., 2009). Multiple intrusions of MORB-type magma form small olivine gabbro pods and dikes (Fig. 8A) and cause basaltic eruptions on the seafloor (Figs. 7A2 and 8B). Extensional tectonics and associated faulting and shearing may cause tectonic brecciation of the lavas (Fig. 8C).\n\nOceanic crust formation at oceanic spreading axes involves decompression melting of uprising asthenosphere and focused upward ascent of the melt into a melt lens and associated crystal mush zone (Fig. 7A1). Magma injection into a narrow, ∼250-m-wide region (Rubin and Sinton, 2007) above the melt lens causes crustal accretion via diking and eruption on the seafloor along the ridge axis. Lavas and dikes have compositions more depleted in incompatible trace elements than magmas generated from primitive mantle. Locally, melts derived from incompatible-element–enriched mantle sources may segregate and rise to form off-axis intrusions and to feed near-ridge, E-MORB lavas. Studies of core samples from modern ocean ridges have shown that variations in rates of magma supply and the thermal structure beneath the spreading axis control the mode of magmatic accretion and the architecture of oceanic crust produced. A low and episodic supply of magma to a slow-spreading ridge creates a “cold” environment in which extensional faulting and crustal attenuation accompany seafloor spreading. Amagmatic extension can result in exhumation of serpentinized upper-mantle peridotite on the seafloor, and highly thinned lower crust and sheeted dikes (Fig. 7A2; Cannat et al., 1995; Dick et al., 2006). On the other hand, a voluminous supply of magma and the existence of a crustal melt lens at shallow depth (Fig. 7A1) beneath fast-spreading ridges create a “hot”’ environment, in which continuous magma emplacement keeps pace with seafloor spreading. Contemporaneous extension and diking produce Penrose-type oceanic crust underlain by a <1-km-thick transitional Moho (TZ in Fig. 7A2). Intermediate-spreading oceanic crust is similar in structure, but it may have a comparatively thinner volcanic sequence with more pillowed lava flows and a thicker sheeted dike complex (Fig. 7A2; Dilek, 1998).\n\nPlume ophiolites form at plume-proximal oceanic ridges or as oceanic plateaus when batches of basaltic and picritic magma originating in a plume head are repeatedly added to preexisting oceanic crust (Fig. 7A1; Coffin and Eldholm, 2001). Lavas range in composition from N-MORB, through T-MORB, to E‑MORB. High mantle potential temperatures associated with the plume head result in the highest degree of melting (Pearce, 2008; Hastie and Kerr, 2010). Therefore, we can potentially differentiate plume ophiolites from ophiolites with MORB geochemical affinities by higher Mg contents (Figs. 3A1 and 3A2), resulting from higher degrees of melting, as well as by their internal structure and distinctive volcanic stratigraphy (Fig. 7A2). Typically, a plume-related ophiolite is characterized by massive basaltic lava flows with subordinate pillowed flows, the occurrence of picritic basalts, and minor sedimentary deposits, all intruded by gabbroic plutons and sills and locally by ultramafic sills (Fig. 7A2; Kerr et al., 1998; Coffin and Eldholm, 2001). Pillow breccias, hyaloclastites, and subordinate sedimentary rocks (chert, shale, and limestone) are locally intercalated with basaltic lava flows at higher stratigraphic levels.\n\nThe genesis of suprasubduction-zone ophiolites involves the initiation of subduction, followed by rapid slab rollback leading to extension and seafloor spreading in the upper plate (Fig. 7B1). In the subduction initiation stage, magma is first produced by decompressional melting of deep and fertile lherzolitic mantle and produces the earliest crustal units with MORB-like compositions (Figs. 8D–8F). Fluids derived from the subducted slab have little influence on melt evolution at this early stage. The subsequent phases of melting are strongly influenced by slab dehydration and related mantle metasomatism, melting of subducting sediments, repeated episodes of partial melting of metasomatized peridotites, and mixing of highly enriched liquids from the lower fertile source with refractory melts in the melt column beneath the extending protoarc-forearc region (Fig. 7B1). Melt aggregation, mixing, and differentiation can take place at many levels within this melt column, and repeated melting of the hydrated mantle leaves behind a highly depleted, olivine- and orthopyroxene-rich source. This subarc-forearc melting column produces island-arc tholeiite magma that is emplaced into and forms lavas overlying crustal units with MORB-like compositions. Rising temperatures in the mantle wedge, triggered by increased asthenospheric diapirism and lateral flow of hot mantle (the slab edge effect of Pearce and Robinson, 2010) and further influx of slab-derived fluids result in shallow partial melting of the ultrarefractory peridotites (harzburgites), forming Mg- and silica-rich, hydrous, boninitic melts. Replacement of the primary olivine by orthopyroxene (opx) grains in the peridotites and the presence of hydrous minerals (i.e., amphibole), as observed in most of the suprasubduction-zone ophiolites, indicate that the orthopyroxenite forms by the reaction of the preexisting olivine with these boninitic melts (Umino and Kushiro, 1989; Dilek and Morishita, 2009; Morishita et al., 2010). The orthopyroxenite thus represents a reaction product between the migrating melt and the host peridotite in the upper mantle, whereas the harzburgite is the residual, depleted peridotite of the partial melt that produced the orthopyroxenite (Fig. 8G). It is likely, therefore, that geochemical features of boninitic melts are acquired as a result of interaction of migrating melts with depleted peridotites in the mantle wedge (Varfalvy et al., 1997). The harzburgite-dunite-orthopyroxenite suite in the upper-mantle peridotites of suprasubduction-zone ophiolites are melting residues and melt migration pathways in the mantle wedge during the incipient stage of arc construction. Boninitic dikes and lavas commonly represent the youngest rock units crosscutting and overlying the earlier-formed igneous suites in suprasubduction-zone forearc ophiolites (Figs. 8H and 8K–8L). Suprasubduction-zone ophiolites hence generally display a characteristic, sequential evolution of MORB to island-arc tholeiite to boninitic igneous activity, which manifests itself in a vertically and laterally well-developed chemostratigraphy (Fig. 7B2; Dilek and Furnes, 2009), as also observed in the modern Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc system (Reagan et al., 2010).\n\nThe initial stage of construction of a volcanic-arc ophiolite involves basic magma. With continued subduction and infiltration of arc magmas, the hydrated mafic crust is partially melted to form tonalitic magmas, and this tonalitic crust grows in thickness as the volcanic arc matures (Fig. 7B1). Residual mafic crust can be transformed into peridotitic restite, and consequently the Moho becomes a fossil melting front (Tatsumi et al., 2008). Volcanic-arc ophiolites thus consist of an older oceanic lithospheric foundation overlain by a mature arc suite, complete with gabbroic plutons and massive diabase in the mafic lower crust, dioritic to tonalitic middle crust, and andesitic to rhyolitic lavas, dike intrusions, and pyroclastic and volcaniclastic rocks in the upper crust (Fig. 7B2). The construction of a volcanic arc is a result of prolonged subduction (∼20–40 m.y.) not terminated by colliding continental blocks, as is the case in the evolutionary history of suprasubduction-zone ophiolites (Dilek and Flower, 2003).\n\nSheeted dikes (Figs. 8I–8J) are tabular intrusions of magma flowing laterally and vertically along fractures produced by spreading-related tensile stresses, and they form along a narrow axial zone beneath central rifts along ocean ridges and above subduction zones. The existence of sheeted dikes in ophiolites is conventionally interpreted as strong evidence for the origin of ancient oceanic crust now exposed on land by seafloor spreading (Gass, 1990; Moores and Vine, 1971) and is generally regarded as an essential component of an ophiolite. However, the generation of a sheeted dike complex requires a delicate balance between the rates of spreading and magma supply for a sustained period such that sufficient melt is produced to keep pace with extension in the rift zone (Robinson et al., 2008). In the upper plates of subduction zones, the extension is a consequence of the rate of slab rollback exceeding the rate of plate convergence, whereas the magma supply is related to the temperature profile and the abundance and nature of fluids in the mantle wedge, the age and lithological makeup of the subducting slab, and the history and extent of melting in the mantle source (Kincaid and Hall, 2003; Robinson et al., 2008). It is rare for the balance between spreading and magma supply rates to be maintained in a suprasubduction-zone setting of oceanic crust formation. In the absence of this balance, a sheeted dike complex will not form fully, or even at all, and may instead be replaced by magmatic inflation and the emplacement of plutons, underplating the extrusive sequence (where the rate of magma supply exceeds the spreading rate), or by amagmatic tectonic attenuation of the oceanic crust (where the spreading rate exceeds the rate of magma supply). This phenomenon may explain the scarcity of sheeted dike complexes in nearly 90% of the world ophiolites (Robinson et al., 2008), and should be considered in interpretations of the architecture of putative ancient oceanic crust, particularly in Archean greenstone belts.\n\nContinental margin, mid-ocean-ridge, and plume ophiolites may show pronounced variations in trace-element abundances, particularly for the most incompatible elements, which may be related to both different degrees of melting and mantle fertility, but which do not define any particular geochemical evolutionary trend (Fig. 7A3). Suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolites show a characteristic geochemical evolution. In the early stages of their formation, magmas are MORB-like, but during repeated episodes of melting, their mantle source becomes progressively depleted in the most incompatible elements. The geochemical evolution of suprasubduction-zone and volcanic-arc ophiolitic magmas is characterized by low abundances of incompatible elements (Cs, Rb, Ba, U, Ta Nb, and light [L] REEs) in basaltic andesites, andesites, and dacites, which commonly occur in the upper parts of their extrusive sequences, and in young crosscutting dikes in sheeted dike complexes. With repeated melting, the residual mantle source is progressively enriched in olivine and orthopyroxene, the principal hosts of compatible elements such as Ni, Co, Cr, and Sc.\n\nAt a later stage in the magmatic evolution of suprasubduction-zone ophiolites, there is a change from depletion to enrichment in incompatible element contents in the younger igneous rocks relative to MORB; the more incompatible an element is, the more pronounced its enrichment becomes in many suprasubduction-zone ophiolite lavas. This phenomenon suggests that the mantle source undergoes enrichment of highly mobile elements during or before the extraction of MORB-like magmas from it. It is the nonconservative, highly incompatible elements, Cs, Rb, Th, and U, that show the most pronounced change from depletion to enrichment during the late-stage evolution (Fig. 7B3); the other highly incompatible but conservative elements, such as Ta and Nb, remain depleted (e.g., Pearce and Parkinson, 1993). Pb and Sr seem to be enriched at an earlier stage than the other nonconservative incompatible elements, and these elements, particularly Pb, increase in concentration from the island-arc tholeiite magmatic stage to the final boninite activity (Fig. 7B3).\n\nEnrichment of the source mantle in slab-derived, nonconservative elements is a complex process that may involve fluids released from altered oceanic crust and its sedimentary cover and felsic magmas generated by partial melting of subducted sediments (Pearce and Parkinson, 1993; Hawkesworth et al., 1997; Macdonald et al., 2000; Elburg et al., 2002). Thus, during the generation of subduction-related ophiolites, two dominant, contemporaneous processes operate to continuously modify the source region and are responsible for the typical trace-element patterns of the magmas produced: (1) Repeated episodes of partial melting progressively deplete the mantle source in incompatible elements and enrich it in compatible elements. Inhomogeneities in the mantle source and variable degrees of partial melting could also result in variable concentrations of incompatible elements in the magmas produced. (2) The mantle melt source becomes enriched in highly incompatible, nonconservative elements (particularly Cs, Rb, Ba, Th, U) transported in subduction-derived fluids and/or felsic melts."
