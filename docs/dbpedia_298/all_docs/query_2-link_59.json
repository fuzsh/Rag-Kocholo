Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" However, neither this song nor John's \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" ended up on the album, as we'll explain later.\n\nWith their new-found freedom to take their time in the recording studio and get things exactly the way they wanted them, a new approach was instituted for recording “Penny Lane.” In his book “Here, There And Everywhere,” engineer Geoff Emerick explains: “One of Paul McCartney's favorite albums of 1966 was The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds,' and he often played it on his portable gramophone during breaks, so it wasn't altogether unsurprising when he announced that he wanted a 'really clean American sound' on...'Penny Lane.' I'd spent a lot of time mastering American records, and I was convinced that the best way to give Paul what he wanted was to record each instrument totally on its own so that there would be no leakage (or 'bleed,' as it was known) whatsoever. Paul's trust in me was such that he simply said offhandedly, 'Okay, well, let's do it that way, then.'”\n\nStandard procedure usually had been that The Beatles would lay down a rhythm track together and then, with this accomplished, all overdubs would be added on top to create the finished recording. This was to change dramatically for this song. “Unlike any other Beatles track recorded to that point,” Geoff Emerick continues, “it started with Paul playing piano, not with the four of them playing a rhythm track together; every single part except the main piano piece was an overdub. For days, the others sat at the back of the studio watching Paul layer keyboard after keyboard, working completely on his own. As always, his sense of timing was absolutely superb: the main piano part that everything was built on was rock solid despite the fact that there were no electronic metronomes to lay down click tracks in those days. In fact, Ringo wasn't even employed to tap out a beat on the hi-hat. It was that bedrock of Paul's original piano track that gave the whole song such a great feel.”\n\nMark Lewisohn, in his book “The Beatles Recording Sessions,” explains this day's events: “The most important contribution was the main piano piece, so Paul took great care in perfecting this, recording six takes until he was satisfied, although only the fifth and sixth were seen through to completion. This piano went onto track one of the four-track tape. Happiest with the sixth take he then began to apply the overdubs, working alone in the studio. Onto track two of the tape went another piano, played this time through a Vox guitar amplifier with added reverberation to give an entirely different sound.\" According to Kevin Howlett's liner notes for the 50th Anniversary release of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album, the effect used on the amplifier consisted of \"the tremolo control set at a low speed.\"\n\nRingo was then apparently summoned to help out with the recording that went onto track three of the four-track tape. “Onto track three went yet another piano, played at half-speed and then speeded-up on replay to give another different effect. A tambourine was also shaken for this overdub.\" Kevin Howlett details further about the piano on track three, saying that Paul used \"the studio's 'Mrs. Mills' piano - a 'prepared' instrument that produced a honky-tonk sound.\"\n\nTrack four, the last on the four-track tape, may very well have gotten John and George in on the act as well. “Superimposed onto track four were two-tone high-pitch whistles from a harmonium, again fed through a Vox guitar amplifier, various strange percussion effects, one of them sounding at times like a machine gun, and extremely fast and sometimes drawn-out cymbal notes.” Undoubtedly, Paul played the harmonium, these high pitched sounds being heard in the finished song a little bit in the instrumental section and overwhelmingly during the song's final ringing chord. The machine gun-like percussion effects can be heard in the second chorus and at the conclusion of the third chorus (just after the lyric “meanwhile back”) and the fast drawn-out cymbals are most noticeable in the final seconds of the song. A sampling of each isolated track of this original four-track tape can be witnessed on the PBS Special entitled \"Sgt. Pepper's Musical Revolution.\"\n\nRegarding the sound effects used, Geoff Emerick relates about the “sound effects cupboard under the stairs in Studio Two. If The Beatles ever got stuck for an overdub, they'd head into that cupboard to find something – there was so much paraphernalia there: wind machines, thunder machines, bells, whistles – you name it. Whenever that door was opened, we knew that something fun was about to happen.” Upon listening to the isolated recordings contained on this first four-track tape, as included on certain editions of the 50th Anniversary release of \"Sgt. Pepper,\" the \"machine gun-like\" effects sound like a sped-up drum roll and occasional cymbal crash, but this has not been verified.\n\nProbably because no vocals were recorded as of yet, the title of the song was simply “Untitled” at this point. Although there was obviously much more to be done to the song, two mono mixes were created of the day's work by producer George Martin and engineers Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald, no doubt for acetate cutting purposes. By 2:15 the next morning, the session was finally complete.\n\nThe group met up once again in EMI Studio Two later that evening, December 30th, 1966, with many overdubs in mind for “Penny Lane.” Documents show that the session began at 7 pm, but it appears that this was one of the occasions that The Beatles didn't show up until much later, as Geoff Emerick indicated about this time period. Not much was done on this day, the session beginning with engineering work being performed on the songs “When I'm Sixty-Four” and “Strawberry Fields Forever.” The book “The Beatles Recording Sessions” indicates that, when the proposed overdubs for “Penny Lane” did commence, it was already “well into the early hours of the morning.”\n\nThe first order of business with “Penny Lane” was to make a reduction mix of all four tracks of the previous day's take onto just 'track one' of a new tape, clearing three open tracks for more overdubs. This new reduction mix turned 'take six' into 'take seven.' “Four-track recording was a real limitation with this particular song,” Geoff Emerick relates in his book \"Here, There And Everywhere,\" “so we were constantly having to bounce tracks together and do reductions (which we sometimes called 'premixes'). In the end, there were so many keyboards blended together, they ended up becoming a sound of their own; listening to the finished recording, it's hard to pick out individual instruments. Some of the overdubs even got buried altogether because of the density of the instrumentation and the number of bounces. Nonetheless, 'Penny Lane' contains a lot of great sounds.”\n\nThe only overdubs they got around to recording on this day were Paul's lead vocals and John's backing vocals (heard during the second line of the choruses), both of which were placed on 'track four' of the new tape. The same engineering team of George Martin, Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald then made a pair of mono mixes of this song for Paul to review. Since the time had reached 3 am on what was now New Years Eve, the session ended not only for the day but for the year, holding off the rest of their overdub ideas until 1967.\n\nOn January 4th, 1967, the group resumed work on “Penny Lane” to start off the new year. Documents show that this session, which was in EMI Studio Two, began at 7 pm once again, the overdubs made on this day filling up the two open tracks of the tape. Onto track two was yet another piano part, this one performed by John, and a guitar part played by George, which is barely discernible on the finished recording. Onto track three Paul overdubed his lead vocals. Although all four tracks of the tape were filled, no tape reduction was done at the end of the session, which may indicate that they may not have been quite happy yet with what was done on this day. At 2:45 am the next morning, their first session of 1967 was complete.\n\nLater that day, January 5th, 1967, The Beatles once again met sometime after 7 pm in EMI Studio Two for another recording session. It appears, however, that the primary purpose of this session was to create what turned out to be a sound effects tape intended to be played at an upcoming “happening” called “Carnival Of Light.” Paul was approached by friend David Vaughan and asked if The Beatles would record some experimental music that could be played at this event at the Roundhouse in London. Most of this day's session was devoted to this project. However, Paul first decided to replace his lead vocal overdubbing for “Penny Lane” done on the previous day, this new performance also being contained on 'track three' of the tape. By 12:15 am, this session was also complete for the day.\n\nThe following day, January 6th, 1967, they reconvened in EMI Studio Two at around 7 pm. This time they were not distracted by other projects but focused entirely on adding overdubs to “Penny Lane.” Up to this point, the only primary instrument recorded for the song was piano, albeit mostly piano tracks overdubbed on top of each other. Today, however, they took to adding more key elements, namely Paul on bass guitar, John on rhythm guitar, and Ringo's main drum part. “None of the instruments were taped pure,” says Mark Lewisohn's book “The Beatles Recording Sessions,” “being heavily limited by engineer Geoff Emerick and recorded at 47 1/2 cycles to speed up on replay.”\n\nAlso overdubbed at this point was John on conga drums, which was also limited and slowed down. “He just tapped idly on a couple of conga drums,” Geoff Emerick explains. “He actually liked doing that kind of thing because he could loon around; he never treated the recording process all that seriously. Overdubbing different kinds of instruments, things other than his normal six-string Rickenbacker electric or Gibson acoustic guitar, provided light relief for him: if he didn't have much to do, he'd get bored easily.”\n\nAll four tracks of the four-track tape were now full again, which meant yet another tape reduction was needed. This having been done, \"take seven\" now became \"take eight,\"with two open tracks available for more overdubbing. Interestingly, both John and George Martin overdubbed more pianos onto the recording (which now totaled six pianos on the song), as well as handclaps (undoubtedly by all four Beatles) and, during the instrumental break, John, Paul and George humorously scat singing where they knew brass instruments would be overdubbed later. A good portion of this handclap and scat singing overdub can be heard on the \"Super Deluxe Edition\" box set of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album along with another interesting overdub flown in which we'll detail later. This again filled up the new four-track tape, another tape reduction being made at the end of the session to vacate two more tracks for future overdubbing. The session was complete at 1 am, this being a much more productive day for a single song that was becoming quite a lengthy project.\n\nThe Beatles took off for the weekend, but George Martin was kept busy by Paul for these two days. “Paul had very definite thoughts about the instrumentation he wanted on 'Penny Lane,'” relates Geoff Emerick. “George Martin was tasked with creating an arrangement for flutes, trumpets, piccolo, and flugelhorn, to which were added oboes, cor anglais (English horn), and bowed double bass.” So, when Monday came around, January 9th, 1967, the session at EMI Studio Two was used for overdubbing the first portion of these classical instruments, using the score that George Martin had come up with over the weekend.\n\nFour flautists and two trumpeters (Leon Calvert and Freddie Clayton) were recorded on this day, three of these musicians also overdubbing piccolos and a flugelhorn. Two mono mixes were made at the end of the day by the usual engineering team of Martin, Emerick and McDonald, no doubt to allow Paul to inspect the recording of the song thus far. By 1:45 am, the session was complete.\n\nYet another “Penny Lane” session was booked for the following day, January 10th, 1967, this time in EMI Studio Three. Sometime after the usual 7 pm The Beatles arrived for what amounted to a not-too-productive day. “The Beatles Recording Sessions” book describes the results of this day's work as “superimpositions of various effects including scat harmonies and a hand-bell, taken from the trap room and shaken whenever the lyrics mentioned the fireman or his fire-engine.” In actuality, as Paul demonstrated in video footage from the 1990's, it was a set of tubular bells that were available in EMI Studios that were used on the song after the \"fire engine\" references, not a hand-bell. Since the session is specified to have been complete at 1:40 am the next morning, it's probably safe to say that The Beatles didn't arrive precisely at 7 pm and spend over six-and-a-half hours to record Ringo hammering a tubular bell and some “scat harmonies,” the latter of which isn't discernible in the finished recording. Or maybe it did take that long...It may have taken Ringo all that time to hit the tubular bell exactly the way Paul wanted it! Or maybe they just hung out and smoked some doobies...who am I to say?\n\nTwo days later, though, on January 12th, 1967, a more productive session commenced. The second set of classical instrument overdubs took place in EMI Studio Three, between the hours of 2:30 and 11 pm. Two trumpets (including Bert Courtley), two oboes, two cor anglais and a double-bass were recorded onto \"take nine\" of “Penny Lane.” The bassist, Frank Clarke, relates: “They wanted me to play one note over and over, for hours.” Interestingly, it was probably at this session that a decision was made to insert a small section of the classical instruments overdub played backwards in the open section of the final chorus, this being heard on the above mentioned \"Sgt. Pepper\" box set. This backward instrumental section, of course, was decided against later and replaced by a final overdub which will be described below. After this session was done to satisfaction, two mono mixes were made by the usual engineering team just before the doors were closed for the evening at 11 pm.\n\nGeoff Emerick relates: “Combined with Paul's stellar bass playing and superb vocals...the track was beginning to sound full, polished, and quite finished to me.” Upon listening to the song at this point, as available in bootlegs, I'm sure that most listeners and record-buyers would have been quite impressed with these stellar results. The instrumental section, for instance (as evidenced on the compilation album “Anthology 2”), works quite well, and would be considered a good step up from their most recent album release “Revolver.”\n\nHowever, Paul thought it could be improved upon. During this session, Paul kept talking about something he had seen on television the night before. He was watching “the second of a five-part, late-night BBC2 television series 'Masterworks' at home on the Wednesday evening of January 11th,” explains the book “The Beatles Recording Sessions.”\n\n“Paul couldn't stop talking about it,” Geoff Emerick details. “'What was that tiny little trumpet that fellow was playing?' he asked us. 'I couldn't believe the sound he was making!' George Martin's classical training never came in more handy. 'That's called a piccolo trumpet,' he said, 'and the chap playing it was David Mason, who happens to be a friend of mine.' 'Fantastic!' exclaimed Paul. 'Let's get him in here and have him overdub it.'”\n\n“He saw me playing Bach's Brandenburg Concerto Number 2 in F Major with the English Chamber Orchestra from Guildford Cathedral,” remembers David Mason. “The next morning I got a call and a few days later I went along to the studio.” That call was received on Friday, January 13th, 1967, and arrangements were made for him to come to a session in EMI Studio Two four days later on January 17th, 1967. The session began at the usually scheduled time of 7 pm.\n\nGeorge Martin, in his book “All You Need Is Ears,” explains some technical concerns for this day's session: “Now, the normal trumpet is in B flat. But there is also the D trumpet, which is what Bach mostly used, and the F trumpet. In this case, I decided to use a B-flat piccolo trumpet, an octave above the normal..It was a difficult session, for two reasons. First, that little trumpet is a devil to play in tune, because it isn't really in tune with itself, so that in order to achieve pure notes the player has to 'lip' each one. Secondly, we had no music prepared. We just knew that we wanted little piping interjections. We had had experience of professional musicians saying: 'If The Beatles were real musicians, they'd know what they wanted us to play before we came into the studio.' Happily, David Mason wasn't like that at all. By then The Beatles were very big news anyway, and I think he was intrigued to be playing on one of their records, quite apart from being well paid for his trouble. As we came to each little section where we wanted the sound, Paul would think up the notes he wanted, and I would write them down for David. The result was unique, something that had never been done in rock music before, and it gave 'Penny Lane' a very distinct character.”\n\nDavid Mason concurs: “I took nine trumpets along and we tried various things, by a process of elimination settling on the B-flat piccolo trumpet...We spent three hours working it out. Paul sang the parts he wanted, George Martin wrote them out, I tried them. But the actual recording was done quite quickly. They were jolly high notes, quite taxing, but with the tapes rolling we did two takes as overdubs on top of the existing song. I read in books that the trumpet sound was later speeded up but that isn't true because I can still play those same notes on the instrument along with the record...I've spent a lifetime playing with top orchestras yet I'm most famous for playing on 'Penny Lane'!” As for his pay, the special Musicians' Union rate of 27 pounds, 10 shillings were given for his services.\n\nIn Paul's 2021 Hulu documentary series \"McCartney 3,2,1,\" he relates about his insistence of including \"an impossible high note\" at the end of the piccolo trumpet solo: \"David Mason turns to me and says, 'Well, that's officially out of the range of the piccolo trumpet even.' And I kind of give him a look, like, 'eh, you can do it, y'know.' He goes, 'Ok.' So he plays it and it haunted him for the rest of his life!\"\n\n“True professional that he was,” Geoff Emerick relates, “(David) Mason played it perfectly the first time through, including the extraordinarily demanding solo which ended on a note that was almost impossibly high. It was, quite simply, the performance of his life. And everyone knew it...except, obviously, Paul. As the final note faded to silence, he reached for the talkback mic. 'Nice one, David,' Paul said matter-of-factly. 'Can we try another pass?' There was a moment of silence. 'Another pass?' The trumpeter looked up at the control room helplessly. He seemed lost for words. Finally, he said softly, 'Look, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I just can't do it any better.' Mason knew that he had nailed it, that he had played everything note-perfect and that it was a prodigious feat that he could not possibly top.”\n\n“Quickly George Martin intervened and addressed Paul emphatically, one of the few times in recent weeks that I saw him assert his authority as producer. 'Good God, you can't possibly ask the man to do that again...it's fantastic!' A dark cloud gathered over Paul's face. Even though the exchange was occurring in the privacy of the control room, out of earshot of (David) Mason and the other Beatles, George's remark clearly embarrassed and angered him...For an uncomfortable moment the producer and his headstrong young artist glared at each other. Finally, Paul returned to the talkback mic. 'Okay, thank you, David. You're free to go now, released on your own recognizance.' Handled with typical McCartney humor, the confrontation was over.”\n\nDavid Mason recalls, “Although Paul seemed to be in charge, and I was the only one playing, the other three Beatles were there too. They all had funny clothes on, candy-striped trousers, floppy yellow bow ties etc. I asked Paul if they'd been filming because it really looked like they had just come off a film set. John Lennon interjected, 'Oh no mate, we always dress like this!'”\n\nThis session finally completed the recording of “Penny Lane,” three full weeks being needed to get it to its complete state, which was a huge amount of studio time for one song in those days. With this complete, three mono mixes were made of the song by the usual engineering team, the third one ('remix 11') being deemed the best at this point. A tape copy of this mono mix was made and quickly dispatched, along with a mono mix of “Strawberry Fields Forever,” to Capitol Records in the US. It had already been decided that these two songs were to be pulled from the forthcoming album and released as a long-overdue single (to divert attention back to The Beatles and away from the new teenage heartthrobs, The Monkees). Capitol quickly printed promotional copies of this new single and distributed them to radio stations across America.\n\nHowever, a decision was made to further improve on this mono mix. “After some contemplation it was decided that Mason's piccolo trumpet flourish at the very end was superfluous,” explains Geoff Emerick. “And so, a week later, the song was remixed and the piccolo removed from the end of the song.” This new mono mix was created in the control room of EMI Studio One on January 25th, 1967 between 6:30 and 8:30 pm by the usual team of George Martin, Geoff Emerick and Phil McDonald. Three attempts at this mono mix were made and the third ('remix 14') was deemed best, a tape copy of this mix being made between 9 and 10 pm on this day to be dispatched to Capitol Records in the US immediately to replace the previous mono mix. This new mono mix is the one that was released worldwide for purchase by the public. However, the aforementioned promotional copies that Capitol distributed with the rare piccolo trumpet ending was what American radio listeners became acquainted with at the time.\n\nSince “Penny Lane” was not included on the “Sgt. Pepper” album as originally planned, there was no pressing need to create a stereo mix, singles being released only in mono at that point. Capitol Records decided to include the song on an album they put together entitled “Magical Mystery Tour” and, since no stereo mix was available, they created their own mock stereo version by panning the high frequencies to one channel and the low frequencies to the other channel.\n\nA true stereo mix was finally created on September 30th, 1971 by George Martin in his AIR Studios in London. While this mix still did not include the ending trumpet flourish from David Mason, it did include a trumpet flourish not heard before, which appears just after the phrase “clean machine.” While this new mix appeared on the UK version of the compilation album “The Beatles/1967-1970” (“The Blue Album”), it apparently didn't find its way to Capitol in the US. They, instead, created yet another mock stereo version from the mono mix they previously had, using this new mix for the American “Blue Album” release, this version having a little less treble-bass separation than the one they created for the “Magical Mystery Tour” album.\n\nThe true stereo mix finally appeared in the US on the 1980 released album “Rarities,” although Capitol artificially inserted the ending trumpet flourish to make this version a true rarity. Future Beatles compilation albums that appeared in the states, as well as all CD releases, feature the unadulterated stereo mix as created by George Martin in 1971, with a few notable exceptions as detailed below.\n\nSometime in 1995, George Martin and Geoff Emerick created yet another mix of “Penny Lane” for “Anthology 2” which combined different takes that highlight various rare or unheard elements. These include the original instrumental passage as recorded on January 9th, 1967, a single tracked vocal from Paul in the verses, the ending trumpet flourish of January 17th, 1967, and some extraneous instrumental noodling and vocal 'clowning around' that got faded out of the released version. After this ridiculous conclusion, Paul states “A suitable ending, I think!\"\n\nGiles Martin (son of George Martin) worked with Sam Okell at Abbey Road Studios in 2015 to create a new stereo mix of \"Penny Lane\" for inclusion on a re-release of the album \"Beatles 1.\" Then again, in 2017, Giles Martin and Sam Okell paired up again to create yet another new stereo mix of \"Penny Lane\" for inclusion on the 50th Anniversary Editions of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" album, this stereo mix patterned after the released mono mix of 1967. And while they were at it, they created mixes of the first four-track tape of the song (\"Take 6 - Instrumental\") and the January 6th, 1967 handclaps and scat singing overdub (\"Vocal Overdubs and Speech\"), both of these included in various editions of the Anniversay releases for the album.\n\n“Penny Lane” was also recorded live for Paul's live album “Paul Is Live,” which was recorded sometime between March 22nd and June 15th, 1993."
