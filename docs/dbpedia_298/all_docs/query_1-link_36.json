        "text": "Where in the World Is the Tower of Babel? Comments\n\nThis is the first of a three-part series.

I present the results of three independent experiments that test this claim.\n\nSyntactical Features of Hebrew Genitive Clauses and Their Implications for Translating Genesis 1:1\n\nIt is highly improbable that Genesis 1:1 contains a genitive clause, and it is equally improbable that the verse could be rendered with a dependent clause.\n\nRefuting Dubious Claims Regarding Natural Selection\n\nRandy Guliuzza has made some controversial claims regarding the cause and nature of adaptation of organisms to their environment. We examine his claims.\n\nThe Most High and the Axiology of Genesis 1: Could God Create Everything Good from the Beginning?\n\nIt is not unintelligible that God created everything good from the beginning; it is only unintelligible to the person who makes the claim.\n\nHeat Problems Associated with Genesis Flood Models—Part 1: Introduction and Thermal Boundary Conditions\n\nThe Genesis Flood produced drastic geological changes involving extremely energetic processes which also generated an enormous heat load.\n\nNumerical Modeling of the Large-Scale Erosion, Sediment Transport, and Deposition Processes of the Genesis Flood (Revised)\n\nThis paper describes a numerical model for investigating the large-scale erosion, transport, and sedimentation processes associated with the Genesis Flood.\n\nThe Hermeneutics of Adam: A Figurative Approach to Genesis 1 and the Historicity of Adam1\n\nIt is here argued that the best interpretation is that Adam and Eve are real, historical persons.\n\nLinguistic Traits of Hebrew Relator Nouns and Their Implications for Translating Genesis 1:1\n\nFor nearly a thousand years a small group of proponents have argued for a different translation of Genesis 1:1.\n\nColossal Water Flows During Early Creation Week and Early Flood\n\nNorth America’s Proterozoic geology provides evidence for enormous erosion and the formation of extensive water flow systems, even spanning the continent.\n\nTime Dilation Cosmological Models: Exegetical and Theological Considerations\n\nIn conjunction with efforts to resolve the light travel time problem, creationists have in recent decades proposed a variety of new cosmological models.\n\nMethuselah’s Begetting Age in Genesis 5:25 and the Primeval Chronology of the Septuagint: A Closer Look at the Textual and Historical Evidence\n\nThe strong likelihood is that the primeval chronology of the Septuagint reflects most of the numbers that Moses originally recorded in Genesis 5 and 11.\n\nPhenomenological Language and Semantic Naïveté\n\nDenis Lamoureux seeks to resolve perceived contradictions between science and Scripture by persuading that Scripture is not inerrant.\n\nBlessed Be Assyria\n\nJudgment in Nahum follows the pattern of Babel. God would come down, incapacitate a rebellion, and scatter rebels. This contradicts a widely-held belief.\n\nDo Varves, Tree-Rings, and Radiocarbon Measurements Prove an Old Earth?\n\nThe BioLogos Foundation published a popular-level article by old-earth geologists Gregg Davidson and Ken Wolgemuth presenting arguments for an old earth.\n\nScriptural Geology, Then and Now\n\nThe place of the biblical Flood in the geological record remains one of the most hotly debated issues among creationist geologists today.\n\nThe Nature of the Neo-Darwinian Evangelicals’ Criticism of Young-Earth Creationists\n\nIf we do not understand the dimensions of the war we are engaged in, we are already halfway to theological and historical oblivion.\n\nA Critique of Scientific Explanations of Belief and Unbelief and the Conflict between Evolution and Creationism\n\nThe recent claim that “conflicting networks” in the brain that explain belief and unbelief in God cannot be true.\n\nAn Exponential Decay Curve in Old Testament Genealogies\n\nThe lifespans of Old Testament people born after the Flood reveal a numerical pattern known as an exponential decay curve.\n\nThe Last Week before the Flood\n\nWhile attempting to elucidate the general chronological profile of the events of the first week, we hope to answer two specific significant questions.\n\nComments on Ussher’s Date of Creation\n\nUssher’s date of creation of October 23, 4004 BC appears to rely upon two questionable assumptions.\n\nThoughts on the rāqîa‘ and a Possible Explanation for the Cosmic Microwave Background\n\nDr. Danny Faulkner proposes that Genesis 1:1 is an introductory encapsulation that establishes a foundation for building a biblical model of astronomy.\n\nNumerical Modeling of the Large-Scale Erosion, Sediment Transport, and Deposition Processes of the Genesis Flood\n\nAccounting for thick sediment sequences blanketing the surfaces of the continents is a paramount issue for understanding physical aspects of the Genesis Flood.\n\nTerrestrial Vertebrates Dissolved Near Flood Fountains\n\nTerrestrial vertebrates close to the Flood fountains dissolved then precipitated out to form Precambrian-Cambrian sedimentary phosphate deposits.\n\nThe Lost World of Adam and Eve: A Response\n\nThis paper contends that Walton has given a magisterial authority to the ANE mythic texts in order to interpret the Genesis accounts.\n\nWorldview Bias and the Origin of Hebrew Worship\n\nSecularists claim that similarities between Israel’s worship and that of other nations in the OT prove Israel’s worship was rooted in its neighbors religion.\n\nIs the “Sons of God” Passage in Genesis 6 Adapted Pagan Mythology?\n\nThis paper aims to present a detailed overview of interpretations offered by conservative biblical scholars on the identity of “the sons of God” in Genesis 6.\n\nHow Long Did the Flood Last?\n\nBelief that the Flood lasted 371 days is common among recent creationists, but there are other possibilities.\n\nPhysical Difficulties with Hugh Ross’ Local Flood Model\n\nThere are at least three problems with Hugh Ross’ local flood model which render it physically impossible. This is in addition to numerous biblical issues.\n\nA Review of Hugh Ross’ Latest Book, Navigating Genesis\n\nWhile many Christians support Ross’ broad conclusions, few would agree with the details of Dr. Ross’ argument.\n\nCan One Astronomically Date the Flood within the Hydroplate Model?\n\nDr. Danny Faulkner analyzes Dr. Walt Brown’s determination of the date of the Flood within his hydroplate model using the orbits of two comets.\n\nParasitology and Creation\n\nAs we learn more about parasites, which don’t seem to be “good” design, we will understand better how the parasitic lifestyle resulted from the Fall.\n\nA Reply to Bruce Gordon’s Biblical Critique of Young-Earth Creationism\n\nDr. Gordon recently published a critique of the claims of young-earth creation. This reply is to the biblical criticisms in his paper.\n\nA Biblical Creationist Cosmogony\n\nThe cosmogony proposed is consistent with all creationist understandings of the biblical texts and has no light-travel time problem.\n\nCritique: Faulkner’s Miraculous Translation of Light Model Would Leave Evidence\n\nIn 2013 D. R. Faulkner proposed what he says is a new solution to the biblical creationist starlight travel-time problem.\n\nFossil Baramins on Noah’s Ark: The “Amphibians”\n\nWhen added to previously determined kinds of extant anurans, caudates, and gymnophionans, a total of 248 amphibian kinds may have been brought on board the Ark.\n\nEvaluating The Day Four Cratering Hypothesis\n\nCreationists have recently considered impact cratering in the solar system occurring during the fourth day of the Creation Week.\n\nDefending History: Temporal Reasoning in Genesis 2:7–3:8\n\nCreationist studies are replete with discussions of Genesis 1:1–2:3 and 5:28–9:29, but Genesis 2:4–3:24, has remained largely untouched.\n\nAn Initial Estimate toward Identifying and Numbering Extant Tuatara, Amphisbaena, and Snake Kinds\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to use all available information in order to make an initial estimate of the identification and numbers of extant Lepidosaur kinds, except for the “lizards.”\n\nInterpreting Craters in Terms of the Day Four Cratering Hypothesis\n\nIn recent years there has been increasing discussion of craters within the creation paradigm.\n\nAn Initial Estimate toward Identifying and Numbering the Ark Turtle and Crocodile Kinds\n\nBiosystematics is in great flux today because of the plethora of genetic research continually shedding light on organism relationships.\n\nAn Initial Estimate of Avian Ark Kinds\n\nThis paper will focus on identifying extant bird kinds.\n\nThoughts on the Goodness of Creation: In What Sense was Creation “Perfect”?\n\nThis paper contends that there is no real biblical evidence to suggest that the second law was inoperable prior to the curse.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Curse\n\nMany recent creationists believe that the second law of thermodynamics came into being as a result of the Fall or the curse. I argue that this is not supported by Scripture nor science.\n\nJesus, Scripture and Error: An Implication of Theistic Evolution\n\nThe very teachings of Jesus are being attacked by those who state that, because of His human nature, there is error in some of His teaching regarding earthly things such as creation.\n\nChimeras, Cybrids, and Hybrids: A Christian’s Observations and Critique of Some Aspects of the Controversy Involving the Mixing of Human and Animal Materials for Scientific Research\n\nOn July 22, 2011, some readers of the Daily Mail UK were stunned by news that “Scientists have created more than 150 human-animal embryos in British laboratories.”\n\nA Proposal for a New Solution to the Light Travel Time Problem\n\nDanny R. Faulkner, AiG–U.S., lays groundwork for the beginning of a new solution to the light travel time problem.\n\nThe Importance of an Historical Adam\n\nIn secular culture it is common to view the biblical history of Adam as a story, myth, or a parable but this is now also becoming the standard interpretation for many within the evangelical community.\n\nIs There a Dominion Mandate? Discussion: In Defense of Human Dominion\n\nAndrew S. Kulikovsky responds to Darek Isaacs’ paper, “Is There a Dominion Mandate?”\n\nIs There a Dominion Mandate?

However, it is possible to locate where the idea is found\n\nCreation Date of Adam from the Perspective of Young-Earth Creationism\n\nThis article reveals how young-earth creationists have concluded the approximate age of Adam and to explain the reason for a 6,000 year range between both groups.\n\nIs Young-Earth Creationism a Bad Choice?\n\nAny understanding of Scripture that excludes or indicts the divine Himself is necessarily flawed and false.\n\nMammalian Ark Kinds\n\nInformation on the class Mammalia was evaluated in an attempt to get a realistic estimate of what mammalian kinds would have been represented on the Ark.\n\nAbraham and the Chronology of Ancient Mesopotamia\n\nFor many years, Abraham was believed to have lived at the same time as Hammurabi, king of Babylon. Later scholars would date Abraham to the period shortly before the reign of Hammurabi.\n\nThe Unbeliever at War with God: Michael Ruse and the Creation-Evolution Controversy\n\nThe evidence to be considered will indicate that a fear of God and afterlife play a major role in the psychology of unbelief, and that points toward the realism of Scripture.\n\nParallelism in Hebrew Poetry Demonstrates a Major Error in the Hermeneutic of Many Old-Earth Creationists\n\nThis article will provide a survey of the nature of Hebrew poetry and provide examples of the various forms of parallelism exhibited in the six poetic books of the Bible.\n\nTheistic Evolution: An Incoherent and Inconsistent Worldview?\n\nChristians are caught up in theistic evolutionism without realizing that the worldview of theistic evolutionism is incoherent and inconsistent with the teachings of Scripture.\n\nReview of John Lennox’s Book Seven Days That Divide the World: The Beginning According to Genesis and Science\n\nLennox reasons that the church has been wrong in the past over its interpretation of Scripture in light of scientific discovery, and that those holding to a young earth are wrong again.\n\nWhat Makes Us Human, and Why It Is Not the Brain: A Creationist Defense of the Soul: Reply\n\nTo depart from Scripture at any point is neither safe nor right. Thus Estabrook’s discussion of my paper (Joubert 2011) in which he expressed his difficulties with my defense of the soul is welcome.\n\nWhat Makes Us Human, and Why It Is Not the Brain: A Creationist Defense of the Soul: Discussion\n\nCertainly there is more to humans than a complex brain architecture from which a mind would seem to emerge. However, this reader has two difficulties.\n\nCan Theistic Evolutionism Explain the Origin of Morality?\n\nTheistic evolutionism is not only inconsistent with Scripture but also philosophically incoherent.\n\nWhat Makes Us Human, and Why It Is Not the Brain: A Creationist Defense of the Soul\n\nA Christian view of the world entails that science is not a Christian’s ultimate or sole source of knowledge and the physical world is not the only world there is.\n\nUntangling Uniformitarianism, Level II: Actualism in Crisis\n\nAlthough the term uniformitarianism was not introduced until 1832, the concepts that Lyell so cleverly fused together had already been operating in the nascent discipline of geology for some decades\n\nDetermining the Ark Kinds\n\nThis research effort provides information necessary for the best possible reconstruction of the animal kinds preserved on the Ark for the Ark Encounter.\n\nAdam, Free Choice, and the Cause of Sin: A Creationist Response to a Christian Evolutionist\n\nThis paper will show that Christian professor Daniel Brannan’s arguments are based on faulty premises regarding Adam’s constitutional nature, the nature of Adam’s perfection and Adam’s free choice.\n\nAncient Egyptian Chronology and the Book of Genesis\n\nThis paper will look at the different possibilities that can be constructed concerning how long each dynasty lasted and how they relate to the biblical dates of the Flood, Tower, and Patriarchs.\n\nEmergentism and the Rejection of Spirit Entities: A Response to Christian Physicalists\n\nEmergentism defies commonsense; there is also no scientific evidence that something material could produce an entity of a kind radically different from itself.\n\nCreated Kinds and Essential Natures: A Biblical and Philosophical Response to Evolutionists\n\nAssuming that “natural kind” is a merely biological rather than metaphysical would be a mistake, resulting in Christians having difficulty evaluating and correcting rival views to created kinds.\n\nAn Examination of Augustine’s Commentaries on Genesis One and Their Implications on a Modern Theological Controversy\n\nFew individuals in church history are as popular as Augustine of Hippo. Old-earthers claim him as support for figurative interpretations of Genesis 1. But what did Augustine really say?\n\nWhere in the World Is the Tower of Babel?\n\nThis biblical story is believed by many to be the record of a real historical event that took place after the worldwide Flood, at a time when the earth’s population still lived together in one place.\n\nToward an Accurate Model of Variation in DNA\n\nThe Bible’s description of created kinds implies an information model which uses variables. The findings in this paper show that a model which uses variables forms a basis for understanding biology.\n\nBeyond Distant Starlight: Next Steps For Creationist Cosmology\n\nOn both large and small cosmic scales there is a diverse range of trends, patterns, and phenomena that beckon some kind of explanation.\n\nAnisotropic Synchrony Convention—A Solution to the Distant Starlight Problem\n\nClear biblical teaching is that the universe is only a few thousand years old, so we should only be able to see objects within a radius of 6,000 light years.\n\nUntangling Uniformitarianism\n\nOf the nine terms associated with uniformitarianism, seven can be replaced or eliminated, which refutes the accusation that diluvialists do not understand uniformitarianism.\n\nThose Enigmatic Neanderthals\n\nYoung-earth creationists rightly consider that Neanderthals were human, but are divided on various issues.\n\nFraud and Forgery in Paleoanthropology\n\nA review of the history of paleoanthropology leads to the conclusion that the discipline is far less objective than that for physics, chemistry, or even biology.\n\nSystematic Theology Texts and the Age of the Earth\n\nIn the past few decades there has been a growing controversy in society and in the Church over evolution and the age of the earth.\n\nChristian Theodicy in Light of Genesis and Modern Science\n\nThe problem of evil is always a challenge for the Christian witness. However, William Dembski’s “solution” proves logically and biblically unsound.\n\nChalk and “Upper Cretaceous” Deposits are Part of the Noachian Flood\n\nCertain features of the “Upper Cretaceous” period correspond closely with the biblical account of the Noachian Flood around day 150, and uniformitarian explanations for “chalk” are inadequate.\n\nA Brief History of Intolerance in Modern Cosmology\n\nA review of some recent well-documented cases of intolerance in the cosmology field illustrates a common problem in science. Many relate to the Big Bang theory.\n\nHebrew Metaphysic\n\nMetaphysical development in Hebrew biblical texts is especially elucidated through a series of word studies with a shifting emphasis that each cross-pollinates the others.\n\nThe Origin of Oil—A Creationist Answer\n\nThe dominant view of the origin of oil amongst western oil companies until 1969 was that it was due to the decay of living matter. Now other views are making themselves heard.\n\nRadiocarbon Ages for Fossil Ammonites and Wood in Cretaceous Strata near Redding, California\n\nMeasurable radiocarbon has been detected in fossils from the earliest days of radiocarbon dating. When these data are put in perspective, their deadly significance to uniformitarianism is apparent.\n\nBacterial Attenuation and its Link to Innate Oncolytic Potential\n\nAlthough bacteria have been mainly recognized as disease causing agents, there are abundant scientific evidences that bacterial pathogenicity is not the major biological function of bacteria.\n\nGreen River Formation Very Likely Did Not Form in a Postdiluvial Lake\n\nThe uniformitarians believe that the couplets in the Green River Formation are varves, but evidence militates against this interpretation\n\nKaryotype Variability within the Cattle Monobaramin\n\nChromosomal rearrangements, particularly centric fusions, have played an important role in developing the chromosomal patterns that are seen in cattle today.\n\nToward a Practical Theology of Peer Review\n\nThe irony of the conflict over peer review is that peer review is poorly understood and criticized even in conventional journals.\n\nTesting the Hydrothermal Fluid Transport Model for Polonium Radiohalo Formation: The Thunderhead Sandstone, Great Smoky Mountains, Tennessee–North Carolina\n\nThe regional metamorphism, the hydrothermal fluid flows, the cooling of the regional metamorphic complex, and the formation of the Po radiohalos all had to have occurred within a few weeks.\n\nLouis Pasteur’s Views on Creation, Evolution, and the Genesis of Germs\n\nShortly after Darwin published On the Origin of Species, Pasteur began to challenge the idea of spontaneous generation.\n\nAn Apology and Unification Theory for the Reconciliation of Physical Matter and Metaphysical Cognizance\n\nBecause one is tangible and the other intangible, the physical and metaphysical are generally treated separately. But this dichotomy is illogical."
