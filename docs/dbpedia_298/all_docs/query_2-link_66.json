        "text": "In addition to standard albums, album \"special editions,\" singles, and remixes, the Pet Shop Boys have occasionally released limited-edition \"mini-albums\" or promos that are harder to categorize but which nevertheless deserve separate mention. I list some of the more notable such releases here, but this list is by not by any means intended to be comprehensive.\n\nAn especially interesting aspect of these special releases is the fact that the Boys haven't felt the need to adhere to their typical single-word title policy. This may be because of their generally promotional nature, although in the case of 1987's Now Playing and 1989's In Depth it may only be because that one-word policy, while already established, didn't yet seem \"absolute\" so early in their career. (Please note that I'm very intentionally not including authorized interview or song-by-song album commentary discs.)\n\nNow Playing (1987)\n\nThis vinyl disc was apparently the first of what would become a string of Japanese-only EMI releases intented to promote new Pet Shop Boys albums by mixing some of their latest tracks with key selections of their previous work. In this case the new album Actually was meant as the primary beneficiary. Side 1 offered new songs from that album, while Side 2 presented popular tracks from the preceding studio album, Please.\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nRent\n\nOne More Chance\n\nHeart\n\nKing's Cross\n\nWest End Girls\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nLove Comes Quickly\n\nSuburbia\n\nTonight Is Forever\n\nLater Tonight\n\nIntrospective Radio Edits (1988)\n\nIt's been called \"the Holy Grail of PSB collecting\": an extremely rare set of three plain white-label seven-inch vinyl discs (with absolutely no printing, not even the track names, on the labels or sleeves) released to a few select U.S. radio stations by EMI America to promote Introspective. Each side features one of the six tracks from the album, only they were all unique \"radio edits\" ranging in length from just under four to just over four-and-a-half minutes. No one seems to know exactly how many copies were produced and distributed, but it wasn't very many. Genuine copies have fetched prices of more than $900 (or about Â£750, â¬860, or Â¥105,000). Not surprisingly, it's been bootlegged, sometimes in more elaborate packaging but at other times in white-label vinyl replicates that are all but impossible to tell from the real dealâwhich only adds to its mystique.\n\nAlways on My Mind/In My House (Edit)\n\nI'm Not Scared (Edit)\n\nLeft to My Own Devices (Edit)\n\nDomino Dancing (Edit)\n\nIt's Alright (Edit)\n\nI Want a Dog (Edit)\n\nTotally (1988)\n\nThe black-and-white artwork of this Japanese promo is clearly meant to parallel the concurrent Introspective album. The track lineup, oddly enough, combines all of the songs from that album—the only difference being that \"Domino Dancing\" appears in its single version as opposed to the extended album version—with several tracks from Please and Actually.\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nI'm Not Scared\n\nWest End Girls\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nRent\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nI Want a Dog\n\nIt's Alright\n\nAlways on My Mind/In My House\n\nIt Couldn't Happen Here (Original Soundtrack) (1988)\n\nReleased by EMI only as a promo cassette in the United Kingdom—reportedly just 200 copies were produced and distributed—in conjunction with the Boys' early foray into feature film. What makes this release extra-special, aside from its sheer rarity, is the fact that some of its tracks differ from the album or single versions. (Unless noted otherwise below, the tracks appear in their original album versions.)\n\nIt Couldn't Happen Here\n\nSuburbia (the Video Mix, though not credited as such)\n\nIt's a Sin (credited as \"Extended Version,\" but actually the Disco Mix)\n\nWest End Girls\n\nAlways on My Mind (7-inch single mix)\n\nRent (7-inch single mix)\n\nTwo Divided by Zero\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This? (credited as \"Extended Version,\" aka the Extended Mix)\n\nKing's Cross\n\nOne More Chance\n\nI Want to Wake Up (its title curiously cited as \"Wake Up\")\n\nIn Depth (1989)\n\nThis special, limited-edition mini-album was released only in Japan to coincide with the Pet Shop Boys' first tour there. It combines the seven-inch mixes of several of their more recent singles of the period—which otherwise weren't yet available on an \"official\" album—with a couple of the corresponding b-sides. As an interesting (and highly collectible) bonus, it came packaged with a phone card bearing the image of the CD's cover art. Through the years this has proven to be one of the most highly sought-after PSB special releases, probably on account of that very cover.\n\nIt's Alright\n\nOne of the Crowd\n\nYour Funny Uncle\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nPet Shop Boys (aka Sampler) (1990)\n\nAn extremely rare Toshiba-EMI Japanese-only promo of which it is believed that only about 50 copies were made. Distributed to select radio DJs and critics to promote the most recent album Behaviour, it features all of that album's tracks plus several of the Boys' previous hits.\n\nBeing Boring\n\nThis Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave\n\nTo Face the Truth\n\nHow Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\n\nOnly the Wind\n\nMy October Symphony\n\nSo Hard\n\nNervously\n\nThe End of the World\n\nJealousy\n\nWest End Girls\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nLove Comes Quickly\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\n\"ZYX Maxi\" (1992)\n\nZYX, a German label that at the time specialized in international dance music (but has since branched out), obtained the rights in the 1990s to issue some of the very earliest PSB material recorded in late 1983 in New York City with Bobby 'O' Orlando. This material was assembled onto four CDsâdespite the fact that it would easily have all fit onto just one, indicative of the highly exploitive nature of this collectionâand saw widespread release as The Maxi-CD Collection of the Pet Shop Boys, though often referred to as \"ZYX Maxi\" for short. The music is comparatively unsophisticated and underproduced, but it ably demonstrates how the Boys sounded during this embryonic period. From this writer's perspective, it's primarily of historical interestâbut extremely interesting from that limited perspective. It is, however, one of the few places where you can find one of the most obscure tracks in the Boys' entire body of work: the eponymous near-instrumental \"Pet Shop Boys.\"\n\nWest End Girls (three versions)\n\nOne More Chance (three versions)\n\nPet Shop Boys\n\n\"Theme for the Pet Shop Boys\" (by the Hurricanes, not the Pet Shop Boys)\n\nMegamix (West End Girls/One More Chance)\n\nSpecial '96 (1996)\n\nA Japanese promo that combines a couple of Bilingual singles with a \"best-of\" selection. Not only does it have curiously unattractive artwork (practically screaming \"rush job\"), but it just as curiously starts and ends with the same song. Two different mixes? More than likely, though at this point I don't know that for a fact.\n\nSe A Vida É\n\nBefore\n\nWest End Girls\n\nLove Comes Quickly\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nSuburbia\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nHeart\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nSo Hard\n\nWhere the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)\n\nGo West\n\nI Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing\n\nSe A Vida É\n\nAbout (1996)\n\nOriginally recorded as a two-part BBC Radio One documentary detailing the history and work of the Pet Shop Boys, Aboutâor, if one prefers to deviate from the one-word-title trope, About Pet Shop Boysâshortly afterward saw life as a two-disc exclusive PSB Fan Club release. Created by the Boys' official \"Boswell\" Chris Heath along with Radio One's Lucy Armitage, it provides a wealth of material stemming from interviews with Neil and Chris (often quite amusing, showcasing their humor) as well as assorted others involved at various points of their career. Most tantalizing of all are several brief excerpts of rare and/or unreleased tracks, such as \"Fat Northern Bastards\" and their early \"Six Free Stickers\" promo for Smash Hits magazine. An unfortunate downside is that each of the two CDs consists of single unbroken track with no numbered divisions, which makes it a somewhat inconvenient listening experience. Nevertheless, it's greatly treasured among dedicated fans as a highly collectible rarity.\n\nEssential (1998)\n\nA limited-edition CDpart of EMI's \"Collector's Series\"that was formally released only in the United States and Japan. It consists entirely of previously released material, songs from the period of Please through Behaviour, although some are remixes previously unavailable on compact disc. Now out of print, it's becoming increasingly hard to find. Whether it is indeed \"essential\" could be a matter of debate among most fans. But, at least among full-fledged completists, it undoubtedly is.\n\nDomino Dancing (\"Alternate Version\")\n\nWest End Girls (Dance Mix)\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nPaninaro\n\nThat's My Impression\n\nWe All Feel Better in the Dark (Extended Mix)\n\nIt Couldn't Happen Here\n\nIt's Alright\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nIn the Night (Extended Mix)\n\nTwo Divided by Zero\n\nLove Comes Quickly (Dance Mix)\n\nBeing Boring (Extended Version)\n\nSpecial '99 (1999)\n\nThis EMI Japanese promo is a two-CD set with 33 tracksâa comprehensive retrospective of PSB hit singles up to that pointâdesigned to support the Nightlife album and promote the current single \"New York City Boy.\" (It offers not one but two versions of that song, each the first track of its respective disc.) In many ways it's an anticipation of their PopArt collection still a few years down the road, missing several songs from that subsequent release but also including a couple that the later anthology would lack.\n\nNew York City Boy (Radio Edit)\n\nWest End Girls\n\nLove Comes Quickly\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\n\nSuburbia\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nRent\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nHeart\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nLeft to My Own Devices\n\nIt's Alright\n\nSo Hard\n\nBeing Boring\n\nNew York City Boy (Album Version)\n\nWhere the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)\n\nJealousy\n\nDJ Culture\n\nWas It Worth It?\n\nCan You Forgive Her?\n\nGo West\n\nI Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing\n\nLiberation\n\nAbsolutely Fabulous\n\nYesterday, When I Was Mad\n\nPaninaro '95\n\nBefore\n\nSe A Vida É\n\nSingle-Bilingual\n\nA Red Letter Day\n\nSomewhere\n\nI Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More\n\nNightlife Tower Records Promo CD-ROM (1999)\n\nNo doubtâif only for its odd size and shapeâone of the most unusual PSB special releases, this three-inch CD-ROM was issued exclusively to concert-goers for the U.S. leg of their Nightlife Tour in October and November 1999. Upon insertion into your computer's CD-drive, it provided a navigable simulated \"Times Square night scene\" (inspired by \"New York City Boy\"), excerpts from the Nightlife album, tour information, website links, and a screensaver, among other goodies. It came in a clear plastic credit card-sized holder. Presentation of this item at a Tower Records store (a major U.S. retail chain that has now, most regrettably, gone defunct) would grant you a specially reduced sale price on the album. Then again, I would imagine that the majority of people who had shelled out the price of the concert tickets had already bought the album well beforehand.\n\nMini (2000)\n\nYet another Japan-only Toshiba-EMI release: an unusual mini-album compilation of one Nightlife album track, recent single b-sides, live tracks, and an extended dance mix. The minimalistic hot-pink-on-gray cover art, which employs the \"Nightlife font,\" is particularly striking. Unlike the previous Japanese special releases, however, this collection received fairly widespread general distribution in music shops around the world, making it considerably less rare than most of the other releases described on this page.\n\nCloser to Heaven\n\nScreaming\n\nLies\n\nSail Away\n\nYou Only Tell Me You Love Me When You're Drunk (live)\n\nAlways on My Mind (live)\n\nBeing Boring (live)\n\nNew York City Boy (The Morales Club Mix)\n\nSongs from the Musical Closer to Heaven (2001)\n\nA promo disc distributed with copies of the May 12, 2001 issue of The Daily Telegraph newspaper of London. It consists of Pet Shop Boys recordings of several songs from their musical Closer to Heaven, which would open at London's Arts Theatre later that same week. The \"Slow Version\" of \"Closer to Heaven\" and \"Friendly Fire\" were seeing their first release, but \"Shameless\" and the other version of \"Closer to Heaven\" had previously appeared as a single b-side (and later on Alternative) and on Nightlife, respectively.\n\nCloser to Heaven (Slow Version)\n\nFriendly Fire\n\nShameless\n\nCloser to Heaven\n\nSampler (2001)\n\nReleased as a promo in Europe to generate interest in the 2001 reissues of the first six PSB studio albums, this remarkable disc gathers a few lesser-known songs with some of the more theretofore hard-to-find tracks (mostly obscure mixes) that in several cases made their CD debuts on the reissues' Further Listening bonus discs. An extremely enticing collection indeed, one that was sure to get fans and collectors alike salivating in anticipation. And isn't that precisely what a good promo is supposed to do?\n\nOpportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money) (Full-Length Original Seven-Inch Mix)\n\nWhy Don't We Live Together (Original New York Mix)\n\nKing's Cross\n\nI Want To Wake Up (Breakdown Mix)\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nSo Sorry, I Said (Demo for Liza)\n\nMy October Symphony\n\nBeing Boring (Extended Mix)\n\nThe Theatre\n\nGo West (1992 Twelve-Inch Mix)\n\nThe Survivors\n\nDiscoteca (single version)\n\nAlways On My Mind (Dub Mix)\n\nLively Tracks (2001)\n\nAnother promo for the 2001 reissues, this one was released exclusively (as far as I know) on vinyl by EMI France. Seeing as how it consists of two twelve-inch discs, and most of its tracks are extended dance mixes, it was almost certainly geared toward the dance-DJ market. The simple bright-orange packaging is surely meant to evoke Very—regarded by some as the pinnacle of the Boys' tremendous success in the field of dance music.\n\nGo West (1992 Twelve-Inch Mix)\n\nWest End Girls (Dance Mix)\n\nAlways On My Mind (Extended Dance Version)\n\nWhere the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You) (Extended Mix)\n\nIt's Alright (original seven-inch version)\n\nPaninaro '95 (single version)\n\nPet Shop Boys Story - 25 Years of Hits (2009)\n\nThis promo was distributed with copies of the March 8, 2009 issue of The Mail on Sunday edition of the London Daily Mail. Designed both to promote the soon-to-be-released album Yes and to commmemorate the Boys' receiving the \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" Award from BPI, it caused controversy among some fans on account of the Daily Mail being widely considered a right-wing, anti-gay publication. Many other fans, however, are extremely fond of it by virtue of its delightful Mark Farrow cover art, which depicts various PSB \"looks\" spanning their career in the form of cute paper doll-like figures of Chris and Neil. The disc itself serves as a handy (if inescapably gap-filled) single-disc career retrospective with the distinction of its tracks appearing in chronological order—with a bit of a hedge there on \"Jealousy\" and \"Being Boring.\"\n\nWest End Girls (10-inch mix)\n\nPaninaro\n\nIt's a Sin (Disco Mix)\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nJealousy\n\nBeing Boring\n\nGo West\n\nBefore\n\nHome and Dry\n\nFlamboyant\n\nDid You See Me Coming?\n\nParty (2009)\n\nReleased exclusively in Brazil for the holiday market in November 2009, Party is a single-disc greatest hits collection that focuses on tracks that have proven especially popular in that nation. It also gives a nod to songs that have featured in certain Brazilian telenovelas, the most recent example being \"King of Rome.\" Although the tracklist reveals more than a passing similarity to Story, it's by no means completely redundant. Besides, it boasts another absolutely charming PSB cover—that's two in a row!—what with those colorful balloons printed with Chris's and Neil's heads. Two editions were pressed: the first containing a number of errors (as noted below) and a second that corrects those errors but, in the process of doing so, required several edits (early fades) to enable all of the songs to fit onto a single compact disc, thereby resulting in unique versions of those tracks (again as noted below).\n\nFirst edition: Corrected second edition:\n\nWest End Girls (described as the \"10-inch mix,\" but actually the 7-inch single mix)*\n\nLove Comes Quickly\n\nPaninaro (described as the \"7-inch mix,\" but actually the single mix of \"Paninaro '95\")*\n\nIt's a Sin (Disco Mix)\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nAlways on My Mind (Extended Dance Version)\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nIt's Alright (7-inch version)\n\nBeing Boring\n\nGo West (not described as such, but actually the \"Stent Original 7-inch Mix\" truncated by a few seconds)*\n\nBefore (single edit)\n\nNew York City Boy\n\nHome and Dry (radio edit)\n\nMinimal (radio edit)\n\nLove etc.\n\nKing of Rome\n\n*These errors were, according to the Pet Shop Boys themselves, the result of EMI employing the wrong recordings, different from those that the Boys had submitted as their own desired track-listing. For example, Neil and Chris had wanted the \"10-inch mix\" of \"West End Girls\" to appear on Party, but EMI used the single mix instead.\n\nWest End Girls (10-inch mix)**\n\nLove Comes Quickly**\n\nPaninaro (7-inch mix)\n\nIt's a Sin (Disco Mix)\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?**\n\nAlways on My Mind (Extended Dance Version)\n\nDomino Dancing\n\nIt's Alright (7-inch version)\n\nBeing Boring\n\nGo West (album version)**\n\nBefore (single edit)\n\nNew York City Boy\n\nHome and Dry (radio edit)\n\nMinimal (radio edit)\n\nLove etc.**\n\nKing of Rome\n\n**Truncated via an early fade.\n\nChristmas (2009)\n\nThis special holiday package was released in mid-December 2009. It likely arose from the expressed desire of Neil and Chris for \"All Over the World\" to be released as a single, perhaps contrary to the wishes of their record company, with this \"EP\" (as it's officially termed) emerging as a compromise. Whatever its genesis, it proved a treat for fans. Even the songs that had been previously released by the Boys appear here in brand new versions. Both \"It Doesn't Often Snow at Christmas\" and \"All Over the World\" are new versions co-produced by the Boys with Marius de Vries, and the \"Viva la Vida\"/\"Domino Dancing\" medley (familiar to those who attended the Pandemonium Tour shows) was produced by Stuart Price. The EP's cover art employs the same balloons that graced the Party cover, only now given their freedom, so to speak. It's also worth noting that this EP has the distinction of being the only one of the \"special releases\" cited on this page to hit the U.K. singles chart, where it registered at #40.\n\nIt Doesn't Often Snow at Christmas (New Version)\n\nMy Girl\n\nAll Over the World (New Version)\n\nViva la Vida/Domino Dancing\n\nMy Girl (Our House Mix)\n\nSpecial Sampler 2012 (2012)\n\nYet another in that series of PSB EMI sampler CDs issued only in Japan. This one starts off with the first two singles from Elysium and then dashes through the Boys' career beforehand, offering at least one single (occasionally two) from each of their preceding studio albums, and even tossing in one of the new singles from PopArt for good measure.\n\nWinner\n\nLeaving\n\nWest End Girls\n\nIt's a Sin\n\nWhat Have I Done to Deserve This?\n\nAlways on My Mind\n\nBeing Boring\n\nGo West\n\nSe A Vida É\n\nNew York City Boy\n\nHome and Dry\n\nMiracles\n\nI'm with Stupid\n\nLove Etc.\n\nDid You See Me Coming?\n\nPiano Ballads (2016)\n\nThe inclusion of this compilation here is somewhat questionable considering that it has had no physical release nor even any conventional \"digital download\" option. Rather, Chris and Neil compiled it themselves (a highly salient fact that, more than anything else, earns it a place here) as a special Spotify playlist, presented to encourage listeners to \"discover a whole new side to Pet Shop Boys.\" But perhaps, as of 2016, this is what has come to constitute a promo compilation. And it's certainly an extremely interesting collection. Indeed, it's one that, if not actually calculated to win them new fansâand additional respect as songwritersâmay nevertheless have that benefit.\n\nWiedersehen\n\nYour Funny Uncle\n\nThe Calm Before the Storm\n\nLater Tonight\n\nNo Time for Tears\n\nDo I Have To?\n\nJack the Lad\n\nOnly the Wind\n\nFriendly Fire\n\nSearching for the Face of Jesus\n\nLondon (Genuine Piano Mix)\n\nTo the Shore\n\nJealousy\n\nHelp Me\n\nThe Meeting\n\nAgenda (2019)\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys have one with this releaseâan agenda, that isâand it's sociopolitical commentary. Unexpectedly announced on February 5, 2019âthe same day on which the first of its four socially conscious tracks became available on streaming services (followed by one more track per day for the next three days)âAgenda is a good old-fashioned EP described by the Boys as consisting of three \"satirical\" songs and one that's \"rather sad.\" In addition to streaming, it was released as a CD available exclusively as a bonus with the mid-April release of their official publication Annually 2019, and as a 12-inch vinyl disc that went on sale around the same time. Its songs are co-produced by the Boys with Tim Powell, who had previously co-produced \"Together\" and \"Glad All Over\" with them.\n\nGive Stupidity a Chance\n\nOn Social Media\n\nWhat Are We Going to Do About the Rich?\n\nThe Forgotten Child\n\nLost (2023)\n\nAs stated in official promo tags, \"The duo find timely relevance in unreleased demos from 2015.\" Released as a bonus with their publication Annually 2023, this four-track CD contains tracks that the Boys recorded in Berlin during their 2015 Super sessions, but they felt the songs didn't fit the mood of that album. Its bleak, rather desolate-looking black-and-white sleeve art—not to mention its title, obviously inspired by its opening song—strongly suggests a rather downbeat collection. In fact, the Pet Shop Boys have stated that the title \"seems to represent a sort of larger, philosophical or political point, where there've been times recently where the world feels a bit lost in terms of the direction it's going in.\" Its songs, while \"all super-electronic,\" are \"relevant to the world at the moment.â As it so happens, the sleeve photography was inspired by the stark outdoor landscapes of the 1966 German film Der junge TÃ¶rless (\"The Young TÃ¶rless\"), which is based on the same novel that inspired the song \"The Lost Room.\" The digital version of this EP (as opposed to the physical CD) includes, as a bonus, a remix by Pete Gleadall of their newer song \"Living in the Past.\"\n\nThe Lost Room\n\nI Will Fall\n\nSkeletons in the Closet\n\nKaputnik\n\nLiving in the Past (only on the digital edition of the EP)\n\nNonetheless – assorted special editions (2024)\n\nThe Pet Shop Boys announced that their 2024 album Nonetheless would be released in a remarkable variety of special formats. In addition to the standard single-disc CD, black-vinyl album, and digital versions, there are also:\n\na two-CD edition with a bonus EP titled Furthermore, featuring new recordings of four of their classic songs\n\na double white-vinyl deluxe edition (the second disc being Furthermore)\n\nclear-vinyl and grey-vinyl editions\n\na cassette edition (very retro-seventies!)\n\na zoetrope vinyl picture disc that create the illusion of animation as it spins\n\na region-free audio Blu-ray edition that features Dolby Atmos and 96/24 high-resolution stereo mixes of the album as well as the official video for the album's first single, \"Loneliness\"\n\n(Please note that not all of these formats are pictured here.)"
