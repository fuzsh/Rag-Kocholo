        "text": "From In the Air Tonight to Against All Odds, and Turn It On Again to Invisible Touch, Phil Collins has been responsible for some of the most cherished musical moments of 70’s to the present day. His songs from the legendary band, Genesis, and his solo work have been a consistent soundtrack to our lives and will be presented in a way they’ve never been heard before – reimagined for full orchestra with a phenomenal frontman and all-star band.\n\nJeremy Saje has been performing his entire life, beginning with singing numbers in his father’s magic shows. In high school, Jeremy found the wonder of musical theater and embarked on his career directly after graduation, performing on stages up and down the Eastern Seaboard playing such roles as Billy Crocker in Anything Goes, Pontius Pilate in Jesus Christ Superstar, The Hawker in Tommy, Prince Dauntless in Once Upon a Mattress, Charlie Brown in You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown, Mary Sunshine in Chicago, and many more. Jeremy’s decision to move to California saw the opportunity to originate a few roles, including the title role in Old Ben, as well as several national tours and off-Broadway runs of new works. He ventured back east as a soloist in the world premiere of Jesus Christ Superstar GOSPEL with the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, GA. Sir Tim Rice and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber were in attendance on opening night and gave rave reviews of the production and cast. He returned to California for several productions with DOMA Theatre Company, to stellar reviews. Broadway World wrote, “His ‘Judas’ Death’ in Act II will shake you right out of your seats,” regarding Jeremy’s portrayal of Judas in DOMA Theatre Company’s Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nJeremy never left behind his rock ‘n’ roll and soul roots, and performs with bands regularly throughout Southern California. His powerful voice, expressive range, and theatrical approach have made him a popular staple of the music scene and in-demand as a singer and voice-over artist.\n\nLife-long bassist and songwriter Paul Ill counts playing with the Willie Dixon Family Band at Mr. Dixon’s wake, tracking live in a London studio with Tina Turner, playing and songwriting with Dire Straits Legacy, Christina Aguilera, Pink, and Alicia Keys, and performing with Bob Weir as career peak experiences.\n\nHe is a graduate of the prestigious Berklee College of Music, and as a studio bassist has played on recordings that have sold over 20 million records. He has sold more than 4.5 million records as a songwriter.\n\nHis recording and touring credits include the aforementioned Tina Turner, Bob Weir, Annie Lennox, Linda Perry (whom he counts as a crucial influence and mentor), Courtney Love, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Pink, Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top), James Blunt, Michael Des Barres, Mick Taylor (Rolling Stones), Bill Ward (Black Sabbath), and Wayne Kramer (MC5), just to name a few.\n\nPaul is a “first call” studio musician, songwriter, orchestrator, and arranger for esteemed record producers such as Jack Douglas, Little Steven Van Zandt, and Guy Chambers. He, along with Bobby Owsinski, is the co-author of The Studio Musician’s Handbook, published internationally by Hal Leonard Music Publishing.\n\nDan has been a working drummer in Los Angeles since 1986. He is a graduate of the acclaimed Musicians Institute in Hollywood and has studied with some of music’s finest musicians and teachers, including Gregg Bissonette, Alex Acuna, and Richard Wilson.\n\nIn the mid ‘80s, Potruch worked with jazz artists Tony Guerrero, Doug Webb, and Deron Johnson of Miles Davis fame, as well as a host of R&B and Blues artists including Guitar Shorty and Kevin Moore (a.k.a. Keb Mo). Through the ‘90s, Dan toured and recorded with Mark Lindsay, original lead singer of Paul Revere and the Raiders.\n\nDan is a noted session drummer and producer. Jack Douglas has said, “Dan is one of my secret weapons in the studio.” Former Capitol Records President/Producer Andy Slater includes Potruch in his Neil Young tribute group, Ragged Glory. He has also performed on various film soundtracks at Beacon Street Studios including The Bachelorette, Anchorman II, and Casa De Mi Padre. Dan also performed with Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry on The Tonight Show.\n\nDan continues to stay very busy as the touring drummer for Richie Kotzen (Mr. Big, Winery Dogs) and with his band, Uncle Duane’s Band. Dan exclusively uses Paiste Cymbals and Innovative Percussion Sticks."
