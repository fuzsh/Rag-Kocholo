        "text": "Bojangles Coliseum, Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nSunday, January 11th, 2009.\n\nTNA Wrestling kick off the wrestling New Year with the first pay-per-view of 2009, and despite a few last-minute line-up changes to the advertised card; this was a pretty solid effort from all involved.\n\n(NOTE: This review was written live at the time TNA Genesis aired in January 2009. I discovered a bunch of old TNA reviews in my archives and wanted to add them to RPW, so here we are.)\n\nHere’s what went down.\n\nSix-Man Tag Team Elimination Match: Sonjay Dutt, Jimmy Rave and Kiyoshi vs. LAX (Homicide & Hernandez and Eric Young)\n\nPut together at the last minute (Cute Kip, Shark Boy and Lance Hoyt had been announced to be in this match as recently as the weekend), you can’t help but feel that this throw-away match was put together simply to give these guys something to do.\n\nRegardless as to why they’re here, the six combatants nonetheless deliver an entertaining opening match.\n\nAs the bout gets underway, Mike Tenay takes the opportunity to alleviate the lack of fan interest by announcing that Christy Hemme has been injured and won’t be able to compete, and also that Rhino hasn’t yet arrived. The first part is real, the second nothing but storyline.\n\nTurning our attentions to the match at hand and we’re treated to a fast-paced, high energy match with everyone getting enough time in the ring, even despite the predictable multiple-suicide-dive spot TNA seems to do in every match.\n\nThe match ends when, with everyone else eliminated, Hernandez leaps onto Jimmy Rave for the three count.\n\nYour winner: Hernandez.\n\nWe go backstage next, where Jim Cornette is hanging outside the Main Event Mafia’s locker room, looking for Rhino. Scott Steiner tells Cornette that they don’t care about Rhino, before slamming the door in his face and sending Cornette storming off.\n\nThen, it’s back to the ring for what promises to be an exciting match.\n\nX-Division Tournament Final: Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley.\n\nThe two tag team partners had predicted all along that they’d be facing each other in this tournament final match to crown a new X-Division champion, and as the Motor City Machine Guns lock up, it’s a good time to be reminded that Mick Foley told the two that they’d better have a good match, or else.\n\nAs such, Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley deliver the goods; working hard to put on an enjoyable match.\n\nThings kick off with some slow and steady chain-wrestling before working their way up to a back-and-forth encounter that has the fans chanting loudly.\n\nIn the end, though, it’s Alex Shelley with a sneaky roll-up on his tag team partner for the win and his first X-Division championship.\n\nYour Winner and new X-Division Champion: Alex Shelley.\n\nUp next, we’ve got a match that has been building up for months.\n\nIf this were any other promotion, this would have been a well-booked feud. As it is, it involves an odd-looking referee and Abdul Bashir, and isn’t all that interesting.\n\nGrudge Match: Shane Sewell vs. Sheik Abdul Bashir.\n\nShane Sewell gets a good reaction from the crowd, even if he does look a bit ridiculous in a referee-striped outfit.\n\nThe former referee wastes no time in going after his rival, beating Bashir around the ring before countering a flurry of fists with a hard arm drag.\n\nUnable to gain the advantage, the Sheik eventually takes off. Sewell follows but is beaten to the punch by Bashir, who makes it back first into the ring. Sheik then takes the advantage finally, building up to Sewell’s big comeback with a figure-four, a none-too-subtle to Charlotte legend, Ric Flair, before we get a somewhat silly ending.\n\nWith Bashir fighting back and working over Sewell with a number of blows, Hebner tries to stop him and actually slaps the Sheik in the face before getting chased around the ring.\n\nSewell then does that ridiculous thing of ripping off his shirt, all for the sake of a roll-up for the win.\n\nYour Winner: Shane Sewell.\n\nIt’s time for more title action next in a triple threat tag match for the World Tag Team titles.\n\nWorld Tag Team Title Match: Jay Lethal & Consequences Creed (champions) vs. Abyss & Matt Morgan vs. Beer Money Inc (Robert Roode & James Storm, with Jacqueline).\n\nThis match was originally scheduled to be Beer Money Inc defending against Abyss & Morgan, but if you caught the last edition of Impact, you’ll know that Jay Lethal & Consequences Creed cashed in their Feast or Fired briefcase in an impromptu match, and won the belts.\n\nAs such, we’ve got a triple threat on our hands, and it’s pretty entertaining.\n\nLots of tags and counter-action takes place, with everyone getting involved and a tease at a feud between Abyss & Morgan towards the close, as a tag belt gets thrown in the ring, Abyss accidentally conks out his partner, Jacqueline makes the distraction and Roode gets the cover for a near fall.\n\nIn a second though, James Storm gives the assist to his partner, the referee turns his attentions back to the match and Beer Money Inc regain the gold.\n\nYour Winners and new World Tag Team Champions: Beer Money Inc.\n\nWith Christy Hemme legitimately injured and thus having to pull out of her scheduled TNA Knockouts Championship match with current titleholder, Awesome Kong, it would’ve made a whole load of sense to simply find a replacement and hold a title match as planned.\n\nYet with Kong also reported to have suffered an injury, it made just as much sense to rebook the whole thing as six-woman tag match.\n\nSix Knockout Tag Team Match: ODB, Roxxi and Taylor Wilde vs. Rhaka Khan, Sojourner Bolt and Raisha Saeed.\n\nProbably the weakest match on the show, with nothing overly interesting happening, this comes as the third match on the card to be won with a simple roll-up as ODB picks up the win against Saeed.\n\nYour Winners: ODB, Roxxi & Taylor Wilde.\n\nWith that little distraction, it’s time for one of the selling points of the Genesis pay-per-view.\n\nGrudge Match: Jeff Jarrett vs. Kurt Angle\n\nThe last time these two got in the ring they had a fantastic match, and after some interesting booking building up to this ‘highly anticipated’ re-match, it looks like we could have another one on our hands.\n\nJarrett and Angle fight hard and stiff, taking out their aggression on one another and whipping up a storm in the early going.\n\nBeating each other up in and out of the ring, the two find themselves back on the outside after an intense spot over the ropes, where Angle clocks Jarrett with the ring bell, beats him with some stiff shots and slams him into the announce table, making the founder of TNA bleed profusely.\n\nThis one has erupted into a viciously brilliant match with lots of brawling, counter holds and spots, but ends with a victory for Angle, reversing a pin attempt after taking a Jarrett chair shot to claim the 1, 2, 3.\n\nYour winner: Kurt Angle.\n\nPart way through that last match, we saw Rhino arrive on the scene in a foul mood. At least we know he’s here, and he’s ready to fight for the title.\n\nTNA World Heavyweight Championship: Sting (champion) vs. Rhino\n\nAfter the Angle/Jarrett scrap, Sting and Rhino have a tough act to follow.\n\nThey try anyway, and though this is a decent encounter in its own right, it’s been spoiled somewhat by having that great match on before it. In the end, after a heated contest, Sting hits the Scorpion Death Drop for the win.\n\nYour Winner and Still TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Sting\n\nFinally, it’s time for the main event which marks the in-ring return of Hardcore Legend, Mick Foley.\n\nBut first, there’s some news. Kevin Nash was taken to hospital earlier in the day with a staph infection in his elbow (apparently all-real), and so they have a replacement…Cute Kip!?!\n\nGood Lord!\n\nKip gets on the microphone and says that people shouldn’t let the Cute Kip gimmick fool people, he’s worthy of being in that match. He’s been a tag team champion, an Intercontinental champion and a Hardcore champion (yes mate, all in WWE!), and that he deserves to be in that match.\n\nSix Man Tag: Mick Foley, AJ Styles & Brother Devon vs. TNA Legends Champion, Booker T, Scott Steiner and Cute Kip\n\nAll six men go at it in the early going before the match finally settles into your standard six-man, with Kip and Styles finally getting things going properly.\n\nThe match goes back and forth for a while before all hell breaks loose once more and the ref counts everybody out.\n\nThis brings Jim Cornette to the ring. Cornette says things don’t go down like that in Charlotte, North Carolina, and orders the match to be re-started.\n\nBooker T tells Cornette that he doesn’t have the authority to do that, and Mick Foley agrees. He says Cornette doesn’t have the authority (way to undermine someone!), but he does, and it’s being restarted under hardcore rules!\n\nA steel bin full of weapons comes into play (how convenient that it just happened to be there!), and we get some good hardcore action as the match builds to its finish, with Foley planting Steiner with his famous DDT for the win.\n\nYour winners: Mick Foley, Brother Devon & AJ Styles\n\nAnd that’s your lot, folks. The first wrestling pay per view of 2009 in the can.\n\nDespite suffering from a thrown-together collection of combatants (Cute Kip in the main event) and a lack of originality (no less than three six-man/woman tag matches, only one of which served much purpose), the TNA wrestlers did the best with what they’d be given and made it somehow work.\n\nMatch of the night honours clearly went to Kurt Angle and Jeff Jarrett’s epic rematch, closely followed by the Sabin/Shelley clash which should lead to an interesting story between the two on further editions of TNA Impact.\n\nI'm slowly working my way through re-publishing all of my old TNA reviews from 2008 - 2009. For now, you can also read:\n\nTNA Turning Point 2008\n\nTNA Final Resolution 2008\n\nFor more TNA, WCW, and WWE/WWF reviews follow Retro Pro Wrestling on Twitter or hit 'like' on the brand new Facebook page.\n\nThanks for reading."
