I really appreciate the enthusiasm and support. Right now, a group of talented people and I are working hard every day to make some exciting things happen in 2024. I promise that I will post details about any 2024 news as soon as I'm able to.\" I presume this relates to activity now announced with the Band Geeks.\n\nIn a Mar 2023 interview, Anderson talked about his Chagall project and then continued, \"That's the future of my life [...] I've only got four other musicals lined up.\" It is unclear what all of these projects might be. Asked about timelines, he replied, \"It will happen when it happens.\" In an Apr 2023 interview with Rolling Stone, Anderson said, \"I'm at a place in my career where I'm feeling like I'm in a very creative mode all the time. I'm finishing four projects for the coming five years. You're going to have a lot of music coming out over the next five years.\" In neither interview did he specify what all these were. (Are the \"projects\" from the second interview all \"musicals\", as in the first interview?) Anderson's key projects of new music at the time appeared to be the Chagall project, Zamran, 1000 Hands and \"Opus Opus\". However, it appears his priorities have since shifted to an album and touring with the Band Geeks. In an interview for Mojo issue 364 (dated Mar 2024, published Jan 2024), Anderson spoke of having \"10 projects on the go\" and picked Zamran as the one he is working on most. He also said there he has no plans to stop making music. In a Jul 2024 interview, asked if was working on projects other than True, Anderson said, \"Only 10! [...] They're all hovering around. I've been working on [a] musical, Marc Chagall [...] I'm slowly going to be involved in in producing a musical about Marc Chagall [...] I've got three or four musicals that I wrote when I was in a very strange place. I started writing about... it's a famous Greek tragedy called Antigone. And I wrote a rap opera [...] it still sounds great! I haven't found anybody that might be interested but... [...] It's just one of a dozen ideas that are still floating around and one day, I'll find a record company that really says. 'OK, we'll release it, but don't expect any money.' I'll say, 'OK'.\" In another Jul 2024 interview, he said he wasn't planning on doing a second album with the Geeks and that, after a \"couple of years\", \"other things will come along, like my work with Roine [see here], my 1,000 Hands: Part Two, Zamran maybe, you never know.\" Asked what he will be doing next after work with the Band Geeks in an Aug 2024 interview, Anderson said: \"Hard to say, really... I've been working on a follow-up to Olias of Sunhillow. [...] I'll just keep my fingers crossed that, over the next couple of years, I will be able to present Zamran, which is the son of Olias, and it'll happen when it happens.\"\n\nIn another Apr 2023 interview, he had said, \"I'm 80 next year [2024]; I feel young and foolish but I'm writing more music than I've ever written in my life and I'm very excited about the future over the next 10 years and so on.\" In the Rolling Stone Apr 2023 interview, the interviewer asked Anderson if he would be \"touring and playing Yes songs in your eighties\". Anderson replied, \"Oh yeah. Of course.\" The interviewer next asked about the possibility of retirement. Anderson replied, \"Never. There's no point.\" In the Apr 2023 interview, he then continued, \"I have this feeling that, in my mind, in my thoughts, I'm still in Yes, even though I got very ill and they had to carry on [in 2008]. That's what bands do.\" In a May 2018 article, Anderson said, \"As long as I can sing, I want to keep Yes going. Yes is in my DNA. Whatever I do is Yes.\" To Record Collector #511 (out Oct 2020), Anderson said, \"In my heart and soul, I am still Yes.\" In the Dec 2020 issue of Prog magazine (in an interview conducted early Oct), he said, \"For me, I am Yes. It's never left me.\" More on this below. One of Anderson's main projects had been Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman (ARW), a.k.a. Yes featuring ARW, but the band has ended.\n\nHe has multiple further projects on the go, many involving collaboration over the Internet. In an Aug 2020 interview, Anderson said he had \"a lot of projects I wanted to finish\". In another, he said:\n\nI also just finished a project last week that I'd been working on for three months, and I thought, \"Once I've got that done, I've only got six or seven projects left to get done before Christmas, and I'll be a happy guy!\" (laughs)\n\nIn a Sep 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"I'm finishing four or five projects that I've been waiting to finish for the last 15 years or so\". In a Nov 2020 interview, Anderson said he hadn't thought about retiring: \"I'll keep going. I've got a lot to do, a lot of work to finish, a lot of musicals to finish, a lot of books to write. I just believe that this life is all about finding your true self and to find the divine within, so that's what I do.\" In a Feb 2021 interview, he said, \"I've got up to about seven or eight hours of music that I've been working on for the past 20 years. Everything's MP3s. [...] I'm surrounded by my keyboards and my computer and I'm rewriting music that I wrote in 1981.\" In another Feb 2021 interview, he said, \"I've got about six or seven albums lined up for the next 10 years. I just have to get them finished, that's all.\" In a Jul 2021 interview, Anderson said, \"I've been writing so much music about, er, why did I make music in the first place,\" and he later continued, \"I've got the next 10, 20 years of my life planned musically speaking. I've got so much to do, finish.\"\n\nA Mar 2014 interview said, \"Just this past week, he received new music from friends in Poland, Italy and New York.\" In another that month, he said he is working on \"a lot of different things this year [2014]. I'm in my 70th year so I always believed that 70 is going to be a strong momentum for the next 20 years.\" In a Sep 2018 interview, he said, \"I'm creating very avidly in my 74th year and just thinking about the next twenty, thirty years that I've got to do some really great work.\" In an interview for Inside MusiCast published in May 2016, Anderson talked about how Invention of Knowledge is \"my next step into my next life, my next 20 years of music\". In an early Sep 2016 interview, Anderson said: \"I'm just chasing ideas that come my way  a dozen or more  it's endless. I just need a few doors open.\" Anderson said in a Nov 2013 interview, \"I think I'm working with about twenty different people at the moment, with twenty different projects.\" An Oct 2015 interview with Anderson said:\n\nAnderson has \"a dozen projects that I want to get finished in the next 10 years,\" ranging from an album he started working on 22 years ago to another that began last year [2014].\n\nIt also quoted Anderson as saying:\n\nI think the days of just going into a studio and making an album are not what I want to do anymore[.] I'm more interested in the adventure of free-form ideas. I know it sounds crazy, but I like it when you're not quite sure what you're gonna do until you get on stage.\n\nIn an Aug 2016 interview, seemingly conducted in Jul or earlier, Anderson said, \"I'd rather just do, sort of, ideas now and again. I think it's just a different way of thinking. We can release music all the time. I've got this project coming up next year [2017] which encompasses that, the idea that music is more important than how many sell, or even the charts [...] after a while you've gone through that experience, all you want to do is create music without having to worry if people are gonna hear it. So what you do, you make music, you put it on the Internet and eventually people hear it, if they're interested. None of this going through a record company and hoping that they're going to promote it well, and so on and so on.\" Could this be a reference to the Zamran project (see below)? In an Apr 2017 interview, Anderson said, \"I'm just a workaholic when it comes to music. I've got a dozen albums ready to go at the moment, but they're not really finished. I've got ideas for multiple albums going at the same time.\"\n\nA recent Jun 2017 interview illustrated further some of the diversity of Anderson's activities and the various ongoing projects. The interviewer has raised Survival and Other Stories and how it was made through multiple online collaboration, to which Anderson said he has \"5 hours of music\", implying made in a similar way. He continued, \"I'm waiting to decide how to release it [...] it's so much music and everything is so different. So, it's a question of how to put it into the world and, er, I have some ideas to do it with [...] computer art and also make it like a game [...] I have so many stories that I have been writing [...] 4 musicals, if you like, which is music and songs and me talking about the story. And they will come out at the same time. So it's a large concept idea.\" We see here common repeated themes of a large backlog of material, and of some uncertainty how best to release it and of releasing it in some unconventional digital way, involving a game or, in other interviews, an app. Anderson has talked about the same ideas with respect to other projects, like the Zamran material. That material often stems from these many online collaborationsas have other projects like Survival and Other Stories or, less directly, Invention of Knowledgebut there is also reference here to 4 \"musicals, if you like\". Many of Anderson's projects do appear to involve a story element, whether they're still music projects or entail a theatrical presentation in some form.\n\nAnderson has been keen to tackle a substantial backlog of projects and musical ideas. In a Jan 2005 Rockline interview, he said his new year's resolution was \"to finish all the songs and projects I've started and not finished for the last twenty years.\" In a circa May 2004 JamBase interview, he said, \"I just got in a trunk full of songs I've written over the years and there must be a thousand songs there. [...] I was wondering what am I doing [with all this music]. And this thought came to me: I better start. I better get on with it.\" In the Mar 2006 article, Anderson discusses various projects that he has started over the last few decades, saying, \"I want to get [those] finished and get ready for the coming next few years because I think these are the best years of my life coming up.\" In a Mar 2008 interview, Anderson is quoted as saying: \"I'm always working on one or two or three things. I've got to finish this stuff, but there's time. I've got another 20 or 30 years left.\" He has been going about this in a number of ways, including The Lost Tapes and other archival releases, re-visiting his \"Chagall\" musical and Zamran. He has also talked of enjoying having multiple projects on the go: this from a Mar 2010 interview, \"I'm just working on [a specific project] along with a dozen other projects at the same time. I like to be doing many things at the same time. Like baking a few cakes at the same time and watching them get better and better and tastier musically speaking.\" In the aforementioned Jun 2012 interview, Anderson said, \"I've got a backlog of songs. I never release anything until I really feel inside it's really there, you know, it's happening and it sounds great. I must have 20 songs that are on the verge of being good enough to be heard by somebody else.\" In the Feb 2013 interview, he described plans for the year:\n\nI decided this year [2013] that I was going concentrate on finishing a lot of work in the studio. My studio is chockablock full of music. I've got to sort it all out and here I am writing a new song now, this morning. It's compounding by constantly creating music, which is amazing, but I've got to get it organized. I think this year I won't do too many shows.\n\nAs well as various traditional releases, Anderson has released a number of pieces of music digitally and made further tracks available for free through various online channels. In an interview in Apr 2011, Anderson explained: \"I put songs up there [on Facebook] [...] I don't think they will be released, er, commercially, but I put them up there because I like them\". In the Feb 2013 interview, asked about his next studio album, he replies:\n\nI'm not going to make any more albums. I'm just going to create new music, probably through apps. You've got your app and you've got a couple hours of music. That's what I've got, I've got so much music that I want to put it out there, but it has to be put out there in a certain form other than the norm because we're not living in the norm any more.\n\nHe did go on to make further albums, but in the Jul 2021 issue of Goldmine, he said:\n\nI'm not going to release another album  I had an album called 1000 Hands  Chapter One [...] that I thought was going to be a Grammy Award-winning album  obviously not [...] you start thinking, 'I'm not going to aim for that ever again.'\n\nInstead, I'm just going to release all the music I've made over the last few years in various formats  downloads, singles, videos and so on.\n\nBut in an Aug 2021 interview, he said: \"I never stop creating. I have a musical [project] in the works, one of many, plus three new albums to be released over the next three years.\"\n\nAs well as music, Anderson is also working in a number of other creative contexts, including writing and painting: see below. He's also talked about additional multimedia components complementing his music. For example, there's this from the Jun 2011 interview:\n\nEverything Im doing from this moment on is being visualized, and thats what Im really into. I think its the way to go, because in the old days we used to have - what was it called - album covers. The idea is, you get not so much album covers anymore, so why not create visual art to go with your work. Thats what Im thinking. More or less, people want to see the music like they used to in the old days with a big album cover. So, thats what Im working on at the moment.\n\nA Jul 2011 interview had this: \"I think people should be able to have at their behest, like, four hours of music, entertainment, visual knowledge, different pathways[.] That's what I'm trying to do with modern technology, not just another song and another song.\" An interview from around May 2013 had this:\n\n[I've been] thinking about creating an app that I could use to put all this music up Ive been creating in the last ten years. And then I want to evolve that app, and create a situation where people can get new music every month, and then every six months theyll get albums that theyve never heard from me before, with Vangelis or by myself. The idea is that within the next five years, the app itself will have probably all the work Ive ever done, and be up to 12 or 14 hours long.\n\n[...]\n\nthe idea would be to visualize everything, so that not only are you listening to music, youre actually seeing a visualization of it at the same time. In the 60s you had those lights at gigs in San Francisco with bands like The Doors, they were just projections at first and then it evolved over the years from projection to these large scale giant TV monitors you have [...] now, and youre getting incredible visuals using computer animation. I think thats part of the experience of the 21st century, music as a visual experience as well.\n\nIn an Aug 2013 interview on Planet Rock radio (UK), Anderson talked about his many Internet collaborators, saying \"I'm working with a dozen or so people on a constant level\". He then went on to say he and collaborators were \"working on an app [...] rather than an album\" as a way of \"releasing music over a period of time\", which would also be accompanied by \"visual art\" and be \"more of a game\" that would allow the user to \"go into a world that's different every time.\"\n\nIn Sep 2013, Anderson posted the following call to Facebook:\n\nI'm searching for an experienced and knowledgeable Theatrical Agent to help me realize my dreams. Ive written Musicals, Children's Musicals, Dance Theatre and other works over the years and it's time for them to be seen and heard. I need a fellow dreamer who can be honest with me, and help guide me to the people who can help see these wonderful projects to fruition.\n\nIn a Mar 2014 interview, Anderson said, \"I'm working on a couple of really interesting theater pieces, one for a local [central California] dance company.\"\n\nIdeas for Yes music\n\nAnderson has often talked about making Yes-like music or his version of Yes music or re-visiting older Yes material. Several projects on the rest of this page, he's described as being Yes-like. Before the recent Anderson Ponty Band, Anderson had generally eschewed a band format, but had still talked about making more Yes-like music. Back in the Oct 2010 issue of Classic Rock Presents... Prog, he said:\n\nI haven't stopped creating Yes music in my heart. One of the things I realised was that all the solo albums that I ever did had nothing to do with Yes; I didn't want to 'pretend' to be Yes, because I don't want to do that.\n\nBut now I feel like that it is part of my DNA, and I can't stop wanting to create large-scale pieces of music that obviously have a very strong connection with Yes, because that's what I did with the band. I helped to create these larger pieces of music.\n\nAsked whether he means to form an alternative group, Anderson replied:\n\nIt won't be a band. It's just a collection of musicians that want to do it. [...] [describes the \"Open\" project] That's one of the things I've learnt over the last five or six years  to work with people via the internet. I'm working with a dozen people round the world, constantly writing songs. They're just fun songs, crazy songs, sad songs, hope-for-peace songs. As well as doing the big pieces I'm still writing [...] short songs, because I still love doing that kind of work as well.\n\nIn the Oct 2015 interview, he said: \"I never felt that I've left Yes. Emotionally I'm still in that Yes entity. When we were very, very young as a band I realized that Yes is this thing above us. It's something to do with the energy of who we are musically and not who's in the band. People say, 'What's it like not being in Yes?' and I feel like I'm still in Yes. I'm always thinking Yes music, and the best of what Yes has done is still alive and kicking. 'Heart of the Sunrise' and 'Awaken,' [...] it's still alive and going.\" Asked in another Apr 2016 interview how, if he had \"a magic wand\", he'd like to see Yes wrap up, Anderson replied: \"Create some of the greatest music in the next 20 years. I'm still Yes, I'm still part of Yes in my heart and soul. I didn't leave the band, the band went off on their merry way when I wasn't very well. [giggles] [...] I've got it in my DNA\". In a May 2016 interview, he referred to his own work, saying \"Yes is not over yet\". In a Jun 2016 interview, he said: \"people ask me, \"What do you think of Yes?\" I, honestly, never left Yes. Because Yes has been my life. The band itself are doing what they want to do. I can't tell them what to do, because it's not my band. They've got the name, but I've got the state of mind about what true \"Yes music\" should sound like\". From 2010, Anderson was intermittently working with Rick Wakeman and Trevor Rabin. They began touring, playing Yes music, in Oct 2016 and adopted the name \"Yes featuring Anderson Rabin Wakeman\" in early 2017, but the band effectively came to an end in 2019.\n\nIn a Mar 2018 interview, Anderson was asked about his \"next dream\" after 1000 Hands, he replied:\n\nI really want to do the final, great Yes album. I've got an idea of what it looks like, what it sounds like, but I'm not sure how to pull it off. [...] it's one of those things. I know what it should be, I know there's a lot of people who would love it to happen and I would love it to happen as well.\n\nAnother interview later that same month raised the question of a reunion:\n\nIm very open to it, says Anderson. Its been 50 years now. You think something has got to happen. To me, a great album has to be made. Thats what I think. I dont know how its going to be made, but the final Yes event should happen. Ive talked to a couple of people about it and they get it. I really want to do this. Ive even written eight songs for the record that Im thinking would work with a full orchestra and a choir.\n\nIs Steve Howe into this idea? I dont know, says Anderson with a sigh. Maybe hell read this article and say Yes or No. I dont know.\n\nAnderson had previously said more on this topic in this exchange from a Feb 2013 interview:\n\nAnderson: I wish [Squire]'d have called the band something else, it would have been more real, but bands do it, Journey carried on without their singer. I wish them luck; it's not my idea of Yes, obviously. My idea of Yes is \"Open\" [see below] and what I'm doing now. Emotionally I haven't left Yes at all. [...] I still have a great feeling about the future of my idea of Yes music. I'm still committed to the wonderful Yes music we've created over the years. I want to continue to make that kind of Yes music [...]\n\nInterviewer: [...] Are you open to the idea of an extensive tour with them [Yes]?\n\nAnderson: I wanted to tour in 2009 when I got better and they said no. They turned me down. They said maybe next year [2014]. That's kind of bizarre to me that they'd say they already had a singer, six months later that singer, probably a lovely guy, couldn't handle the touring [...] Now they have another singer, they didn't call me or ask me if I'd be interested, they just say oh he's sick, which is a lot of rubbish.\n\nInterviewer: Would you ever work with them again?\n\nAnderson: Sure, I'd love to. There's no reason why we shouldn't bury the hatchet, get together and make some music and do something very special for all the Yes fans around the world. And there are thousands of people who would like us to get together [...] Rick would have to be in the band. There's no point in just me. We'd probably do some shows or something, some beautiful new music [...] we could make a movie or something like that, just to honor all the fans.\n\nHowever, in other interviews, Anderson has been more cautious. In an Aug 2014 interview with Anderson had this:\n\nThat moment [when the band continued without him in 2008] really hurt, Anderson admits. I think wed grown apart over the years, and when it came to the crunch, you know, business is more important and thats what they wanted to do.\n\nBut were still brothers, he adds. [...] Noting that a[...] reunion could happen if Yes ever makes it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame [...] Anderson says hed be happy to sing with them again.\n\nAs for a full reunion should it be offered, though, he demurs. Its not what I want to do, he says.\n\nIn a Feb 2021 interview, asked what his favourite Yes album is, he replied, \"The next one.\"\n\nThere's more on the relationship between Anderson and Yes on the Yes page here.\n\nOn Patreon and social media\n\nJon Anderson has started a Patreon. This has 3 levels (Silver, Gold and Platinum), described thus:\n\nSilver (£9.60 per month in the UK): Early Access to Songs and Projects, Livestreams of Rehearsals and Events; Behind-the-scenes Videos of the Creative Process; Membership to Private Community of Supporters; Early Ticket Access to Select Performances; Access to General Archives\n\nGold (£46.20 per month in the UK): additionally offers Monthly Live Q&A; Surprise Gifts Throughout the First Year of Patronage; Access to Jon's Select Archives\n\nPlatinum (£92.40 per month in the UK): additionally offers Surprise Gifts Throughout the First Year of Patronage; Pre-release previews of Jon's work; Access to Participate in Jon's Opus Puzzle; Private Live Streamed Concert with Jon or Live Show with a Guest;\n\nAccess to Jon's Gold Vault Archives\n\nHe explained to Prog magazine (issue 128, Mar 2022): \"Record companies think I'm an old fart who isn't going to sell many records, but I have so much music from the past 20 to 30 years sitting around\". There were three MP3s to download in the first ten days, and 32 posts (across all tiers) up to 8 Mar 2022, which were titled:\n\nConcerto3\n\nImages of Hopefulness, \"Hopefulness\" being a piece from Opus\n\nBetter by Far: these first three were available at launch\n\nRoundabout - Live Version\n\nFluorescent\n\nEireland\n\nMORE\n\nZamram - New Music: this is a preview of music from Zamran\n\nThe Opus Puzzle: Prog described this as \"a sonic jigsaw made up of more than 20 short pieces [...] which fans can edit together to win a \"present\"\"\n\nWondrous Stories, seemingly a live version; up to here was released in Dec 2021\n\nReal Love - 2009, presumably a version of the Yes song?\n\nOwner of a Lonely Heart, seemingly a live version\n\nGold Patrons - \"AMA\" meetings with Jon on the 2nd Thursday of each month\n\nPlatinum Patrons - Join two Zoom meetings with Jon each month\n\nGAMALAN KISSING THE GROUND VOCALIZING 2020\n\nEarth and Peace, presumably some version of the piece \"Earth and Peace\", which Anderson performed live in 2010\n\nTo be Alive: Prog described this as a new song, although it of course shares its name with a Yes song\n\nReminder!

The \"Opus Puzzle\" is described by Prog as \"a sonic jigsaw made up of more than 20 short pieces [...] which fans can edit together to win a \"present\"\". However, the Prog article goes on to say that Patreon will not include any unreleased material by Yes, Yes ft. ARW or Jon & Vangelis. Anderson is also planning to release his autobiography \"Survival and Other Stories\", through Patreon, chapter by chapter. Uploads have continued, including the 5-song, 24 minute suite \"The Sun Stealers\" in early May 2022. Jan 2024 brought \"Open Open Open\" (over 20 minutes in duration), which appears to be a re-working of \"Open\", with a 5-minute preview available to hear without joining Patreon.\n\nPatreon Q&As have included his playing snippets of upcoming planned releases, including in late 2023/early 2024 songs for True, the album with the Band Geeks.\n\nAnderson continues to regularly upload other music to other social media platforms.\n\nWith the Band Geeks\n\nAnderson toured the US in 2023 with The Band Geeks, and they returned summer 2024. A studio album, True (Frontiers; duration 58:13), was released 23 Aug 2024 on CD and 2LP, co-produced by Anderson and Geeks leader Richie Castellano. What is described as the \"First Two Legs\" of the Yes Epics, Classics, and More Tour was announced (tour promo video), with 12 dates in the north-east US 30 May-27 Jun 2024 (27 Jun sold out; 15 Jun show sharing billing with El Monstero), and then 9 dates from east to west coast 21 Jul-16 Aug (with 4 shows having Carl Palmer's The Return of Emerson, Lake & Palmer show in support; a 30 Jul show was cancelled). 2 more Pennsylvania dates have also been announced (13 Sep & 15 Sep 2024) and Anderson's Facebook account on 25 Apr 2024 promised \"another leg of dates still to come\". (Anderson said they turned down an offer to open for Heart.) Promo described how \"the set list will contain numerous YES songs from all stages of the band's [...] career that feature Jon as their lead vocalist and songwriter. The tour also promises the introduction of new material created by Jon and The Band Geeks.\"\n\nThe opening night set was [SPOILERShighlight to read] intro music: \"Firebird Suite\"; \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Perpetual Change\", \"Close to the Edge\", \"And You and I\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"The Calling\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\"; interval (with \"Counties and Countries\" played over the PA as background music); \"Shine On\" (from True, around 4:20 in duration), \"Awaken\", \"Thank God\" (from True, around 3:30 in duration), \"Starship Trooper\", \"True Messenger\" (from True, around 6:40 in duration), \"Roundabout\", \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". However, the set has evolved somewhat since then. \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" was omitted at 2 subsequent shows and then moved earlier in the set, with \"The Calling\" being dropped. Thus, the regular set by mid-Jun was: intro music: \"Firebird Suite\"; \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Perpetual Change\", \"Close to the Edge\", \"And You and I\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\"; interval (with \"Counties and Countries\" as background music); \"Shine On\", \"Awaken\", \"Thank God\", \"Starship Trooper\", \"True Messenger\", \"Roundabout\". The 15 Jun set was shorter being at a casino: \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Starship Trooper\", \"Close to the Edge\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Shine On\", \"Roundabout\".\n\nIn a May 2024 interview, Anderson said they would do \"a couple of new songs from the new album [...] But we'll save [...] doing the new album until probably next spring [2025]\". To Rolling Stone in May 2024, Anderson said, \"My dream is that we can do another tour next year and do an hour of new music and an hour of Yes music. Maybe we'd mix them all together. I don't know yet.\" In a Jul 2024 interview, Anderson said, \"Next spring, we'll do it [\"Build Me an Ocean\"], when we do a tour. We're talking about touring next year doing both the album [True] and the music we're doing now [...] Next spring, we can do the whole album.\" In a May 2024 radio interview, he said he would like to add \"It will be a Good Day\" to the set. In an Apr 2023 interview, Anderson talked about the initial run of dates and said, \"The idea was, \"Let's give it a whirl. Let's see how the fans react to it and how we do.\" From then on it'll be, \"Let's go to Europe. Let's tour the world.\"\" In a Mar 2023 interview, Anderson said they hoped to tour Europe as well. The band is Anderson (lead vocals, guitar, percussion), Castellano (Blue Öyster Cult, MorningStarlett; bass, additional guitar, vocals), Christopher Clark (Brand X; keys, vocals), Andy Graziano (guitar, additional bass, vocals), Robert Kipp (keys, vocals, percussion, acoustic guitar), Andy Ascolese (MorningStarlett, Kasim Sultan's Utopia; drums), with Rob Schmoll (acoustic guitar, percussion) guesting in places. (The idea for 2 keyboardists was Anderson's.) By his own account, Castellano is also the musical director, tour manager, business manager, accountant and merch designer for touring.\n\nThe 2024 tour announcement on 5 Mar continued, \"Jon and the Band Geeks are currently putting the finishing touches on a brand new nine track cd set for release in late summer with a first single and video targeted for release in late June.\" A May press release then read:\n\nAfter a [...] 2023 tour with The Band Geeks, Jon Anderson decided to expand the creative partnership [...] to create new material for a potential new studio album. The result of this effort is \"TRUE\" which will be released on August 23 by [...] Frontiers Music. The 9-song album will be a welcome gift to all fans [...] The albums collection of songs harkens back to YESs classic 70s sounds as well as to their latter-day success with the album \"90125\". The albums release will be preceded by 2 singles and videos, the first arriving mid-June for the song \"Shine On\". The album was co-produced, engineered, and mixed by Band Geek bassist and musical director Richie Castellano.\n\nThe video for \"Shine On\" came 13 Jun 2024 (4:23; video). It was directed by Tom Flynn. In his Apr 2024 Patreon call, Anderson had said the first single would be \"Counties and Countries\". A second single, \"True Messenger\" (video), followed 28 Jul 2024. Album:\n\n\"True Messenger\" [James Dunlap (ex-Anderson Ponty Band, worked on Survival & Other Stories, South Park)/Anderson/Castellano] (5:50)\n\n\"Shine On\" [Anderson/Castellano] (4:17)\n\n\"Counties and Countries\" [Anderson] (9:51); side B starts\n\n\"Build Me an Ocean\" [Jimmy Haun (Arc of Life, CIRCA:, worked with Yes)/Anderson] (3:19); this is a re-working of the piece \"Building\" by Anderson and Haun that was released on social media in Sep 2023\n\n\"Still a Friend\" [Anderson/Castellano] (5:01); side C starts\n\n\"Make It Right\" [Anderson/Jonathan Elias (worked with Yes, Jon Anderson, Jimmy Haun)/Castellano] (6:07)\n\n\"Realization Part 2\" [Haun/Anderson] (3:32); Graziano in a YouTube comment explained that \"Make It Right\" is the part 1 to this song\n\n\"Once Upon a Dream\" [Anderson/Elias/Castellano] (16:31), started with a 2½ minute demo by Anderson and Elias that Castellano then expanded; side D starts\n\n\"Thank God\" [Anderson/Robin Crow] (3:48)\n\nThe album credits list Anderson (vocals), Castellano (bass, guitar, keys, vocals), Ascolese (drums, percussion, keys, vocals), Graziano (guitar, vocals), Clark (keys), Kipp (Hammond organ, vocals) and Ann Marie Nacchio (additional vocals). The album was produced by Anderson and Castellano, with Ascolese as an associate producer. Musical arrangements were by Anderson, Castellano, Ascolese and Clark. The album was largely recorded at the Band Geeks Studio in Staten Island, NY, recorded by Castellano and Ascolese. It was mixed by Castellano and mastered by Sam Stauff. The album will be available digitally, on CD and on 2LP (black, transparent blue or limited edition orange). There is a limited edition (1000 copies) gold vinyl edition exclusively at TalkShopLive.\n\nThe first indication of new recordings with the Geeks had come in an Apr 2023 interview when Anderson said: \"I sent it [a song, \"Counties and Countries\"] to Richie and he did a beautiful rendition of it. [...] When we do a [tour] rehearsal, we'll decide whether or not we want to throw that new song in.\" In another Apr 2023 interview, Anderson said, \"I have a song that I've loved for many years that I've never recorded properly and I sent it to Richie and he made a beautiful rendition of it and we're gonna perform that in the middle of the show. New songs are like new blood; you know? They're just like new energy and then you say; maybe we will do an album or that kind of thing.\" In the end, they didn't play the song live in 2023, but the studio recording of \"Counties and Countries\" was played over the speakers after the 2023 live shows. In yet another Apr 2023 interview, Anderson said, \"I wrote a song a few years ago. I always liked it. Then I added it together with another song, then I sent it to Richie [Castellano] [...] We've already recorded it. We're not sure what to do with it. We thought about it, well, let's give ourselves two or three shows and then maybe we'll throw it in [...] the song list [...] That's when I start thinking, well, I've got about a dozen of these songs, in my bank of songs at home [...] Then I'll start sending 'em to Richie and see how we go. Over the next year, we'll write an album, we'll go on tour, as a band with an album, maybe, maybe... We've just got to get through this first show. (smiles)\" In a Jun 2024 interview with Yesshift, Castellano says that, after they had worked on \"Counties and Countries\", Anderson sent him 30 ideas, including a piece Anderson had developed with Elias. On Patreon in Jun 2023, Anderson said they were working on four more songs. In a mid-Sep 2023 Patreon appearance, Anderson confirmed they are working on an album, with mention of a 16 minute song and an 18 minute song (with a clip played). In subsequent interviews, Anderson has described a 12 minute and a 15 minute piece on the album.\n\nIn his 7 Dec 2023 Patreon Q&A, Anderson implied the album was largely completed and talked of going for an Apr 2024 release; participants also got to hear part of a song entitled \"Truth is You\". That title does not appear on the finished album, but I would guess it is included just under a different name. In the Mojo interview (published Jan 2024, so probably conducted before or around the time of the Dec 2023 Patreon), Anderson said, \"we are in the middle of creating\" the album. In a Mar 2024 interview, Anderson described how he \"sent him [Castellano] 3 or 4 songs\" after they finished their first tour. He praised Castellano's work on the material, saying he made the songs \"sound like Yes in this moment in time\". Later in the same interview, he said, \"When we started doing the record, about 3, 4 months ago, I sent them 5 songs, which Richie [...] started to make them into very Yes versions of the song. [...] By the time he sent me the music back of me singing along with it, I was writing lyrics\"; and that, \"It's very Yes. [...] It's still Yes in my heart.\" He also said, \"I wrote some songs 8 years ago that we're using with the new album\". He described the theme to the album is that, \"Everything will work out eventually, don't worry. Life is for living and discovering how beautiful you are\". The May 2024 Rolling Stone article described the making of the album so:\n\nThey wound up with a system where Anderson would send them demos via email, theyd flesh them out as a band, and then compare notes on Zoom. It was like the Seventies where I would suggest ideas to the guys and because theyre musicians, theyd get on with it, says Anderson. I can just play four chords and then Im done. (Other songs worked in the reverse order where the Band Geeks would send a piece of original music to Anderson.)\n\nAnderson also talked about making the album in the May 2024 radio interview. He described how the \"the [2023] tour went very well [...] and about November, two months later, I called up Richie and said, Why don't we do an album? [...] because we sound like Yes.\" (In fact, they had already recorded \"Counties and Countries\" before the tour.) Anderson continued, \"I said, 'I'll send you two or three ideas and you can send me a couple of your ideas, and then we'll stick them together with superglue, and make an album.' And that's what we did. It took three months [ ] I'd Zoom with them every couple of weeks, and just talk about this and that, and, you know, try some ideas. And they would try them! Very very much like being in Yes in the '70s actually\". He returned to this comparison to 1970s Yes later in the interview, saying:\n\nThe idea of the new album is... same game plan, same idea in terms of the spirit of music and how, thankfully, Richie Castellano, the bass player, happens to be a brilliant... producer! So I'd send him this idea that I'd written many years ago [...] \"I've seen counties and countries\" [quoting a lyric] The whole idea was the song is very... Very simple song: \"I've seen counties and countries / The Gardens of Eden / are calling me, calling me home.\" Because we forgot why we're here, we're supposed to be here to look after Mother Earth, and evolve Mother Earth... into the Garden of Eden. [...] So I sent Richie this song, and then this other little bit, in the middle, was all about a song idea that I wrote about: \"Only for you / only for you / only for you [...] To receive from the divine / Who you really are\" sort of thing. [...] So I sent them and then about two weeks later, this beautiful, big piece of music comes back and it's Richie, doing a big rock and orchestra and an all magical event, y'know, and I just sat there and went, 'Oh my God. This is fun! Making this album is really, really fun. You never know what's going to happen next, musically speaking, which was very much like being in Yes\n\nIn the Jul 2024 interview, Anderson explained the title: \"when I spent time in Jamaica, I'd sort of bump into the Rastafarian people [...] and I'd say, 'How you doing?', and they'd always say, 'True, man'\". In the May interview, Anderson said True was \"all about the truth of where I am at this moment in time\". In a Jun 2024 interview, Anderson said, \"We had a great tour together, then a couple of months later I suggested that we make the record that everyone is waiting for that Yes hasn't made yet. And that's what we've done. We've created the album that Yes would have made if they were together. [...] I can't believe how good it is.\" Anderson went on to explain how the album was made: \"I had about half a dozen songs in my computer. I sent them to Richie, and he developed them on a major level to make them sound like Yes. I don't know how he did it, but he did. Then he wrote a couple of songs himself, and I sang with him, and that's how the album evolved. Then I found a couple of songs that I did 10 years ago in Nashville with a very good friend of mine. They're beautiful, very quiet songs. We put them into the mix and everything sounds great.\" In a May 2024 interview, Anderson said the album took 3 months to make. In an Aug 2024 interview, Anderson said, \"We actually did everything via Zoom [...] We'd get together via Zoom every other Tuesday and go through what we had. And we sort of built the album together over that three-month period\". In another Aug 2024 interview with talkshoplive, asked how long it took to create the album, Anderson replied, \"I'd say probably three months. I think it was the end of November [2023] when I suggested that me and Richie would swap some song ideas. And November, December, then January [2024], February, we really started to really sync in how it was going to sound. And then February and then by the middle of March, we had it all locked up. And then you go through different stages of mixing and mastering [...] it was finished around February/March.\" In a May 2024 YouTube video, Castellano said, \"We spent the last 10 or so months recording an album\". (He appears to be including the post-recording stages in his figure.) In a Mar 2024 video, Castellano, said the album was \"done\" and that he had \"finished tracking it yesterday [...] I was doing background vocals all day.\" In a May 2024 interview, Castellano talked about how he, Ascolese and Clark did a lot of the demos for the album together. Castellano played guitar on the demos. Graziano is the main guitarist on the album, but they kept at least one of Castellano's guitar solos from those demos. Jon's daughter, Deborah has done photos for the release and she was involved in the cover. Reacting to some online criticism of the cover, Deborah Anderson said in a comment on Facebook: \"Crafting this album cover was born from a wonderful day of play between a father and his daughter and then a decision to create artwork from it. Like it or not, its just art, an expression of love between two creative people.\"\n\nIn the Aug 2024 talkshoplive interview, Anderson talked about the individual tracks. Starting with \"True Messenger\", he said: \"[Dunlap] just sent this music and I sang the song virtually the same right on top of what he sent me. It was just the instant creation. The way I normally do it is, if I like the music, basically, I'll put the microphone on and scat sing it [ ] make up stuff along the way. But these things that popped out, as you can see by the lyrics [ ] Eventually you kind of get into the idea that we're in a way, everything eventually is a magic, magical motion. [ ] It's as though, in our understanding of God, or the gods or the angels, it's a real thing. It's something that's out there in the normal world of experiences. I always say that why we're here is to find the divine energy. And it's there. It's that sometimes you have to slow yourself down in some meditation or creativity. And that helps you to balance out with the divine energy that surrounds us all, surrounds us all in this world. That's what I'm singing about anyway.\"\n\nDescribing \"Shine On\", Anderson said: \"Richie sent me the first demo and then I danced through it and sang through it.\" In a Jul 2024 interview, Anderson had described the creation of the song: \"[Castellano] had sent the idea to me after I sent him a couple of ideas for other pieces of music [...] he said, \"I've got this song happening, throw some lyrics in there.\" I said OK and I got into the universal love, you know [...] what are we here for: universal love, isn't it? [...] So I'll sing it [...] [It was] a lot of fun to record [...] we would use Zoom, because I'm [...] on the west coast [...] and he's on the east coast in the New Jersey area [...] we were able to listen to each other's music and ideas and then do it live, Zoom [...] it kind of felt like I was in Yes in the '70s because it's the same sort of... throwing things up in the air and trying things out\".\n\nAbout \"Counties and Countries\", Anderson said to talkshoplive, \"I wrote that on guitar, 12 years ago, and then I found a little section that could add to it. And then when I started working with Richie, I just sent him the guitar version, which was [...] me on guitar, but I'm singing this song [...] And within five or six days, he sent me a demo and I went, oh my God, this is so beautiful.\" Later in the interview, he explained further: \"There's gonna come a time when the [...] people who live on the planet have got to make the Garden of Eden again. They've got to make this amazing nature that surrounds us all blossom and be taken care of [...] Rather than making bombs.\" As mentioned above, in an Apr 2023 interview, Anderson had said: \"I did write a song for Yes about 20 years ago that we never recorded, \"Counties and Countries.\" I sent it to Richie and he did a beautiful rendition of it.\" Anderson subsequently also said on Patreon that he offered \"Counties and Countries\" to ARW.\n\n\"Build Me an Ocean\", said Anderson, \"came from a friend who I, I only met him once [sic] in Los Angeles. We were doing some work on a project and I just met this guy and he said, I wanna send you some music. I said, OK. The second thing that he sent [...] [the lyrics] just came out [of Anderson] [...] We actually created a song complete in one go. It took half an hour. But then it took a while to produce\". He also talked about \"Build Me an Ocean\" in the Jul 2024 interview: \"a lot of songs that I write come very naturally, like spontaneous [...] That piece of music was sent to me by a really nice guy, Jimmy Haun. And he just sent me this music and I sang it within an hour [...] and then sent it back to him and said, well, this is what I think it is. It's all about build me a river for souls to deliver life [...] It's a metaphor for the idea that we are spiritual beings and the soul is all interconnected with nature\".\n\nAnderson said \"Still a Friend\" was a \"Spontaneous lyric.\" He continued, \"I thought a lot about the song when I listened to it on the tour just now [...] All I could think of was Steve [Howe], and Chris [Squire], and Alan White, and all these people I've worked with over the years. I'm still a friend!\" In Patreon calls, Anderson had called this song \"Still a Friend of Mine\".\n\nAnderson described \"Realization Part 2\": \"[I]t's in three parts and eventually all one. And I just remembered the idea that somehow there was a lot of questions and then the answer was that it's what you put in, you get out of it. [...] what you put in something is what you get out of it. And the ending [...] reminded me of Paul Simon's [ ] Graceland. It reminded me of that energy. [...] Again [...] I'm harping on the idea that, if heaven is here, it would be wonderful.\"\n\nThe talkshoplive interview included a lengthy discussion of \"Once Upon a Dream\": \"It was one of the songs that actually made itself. It's as though we started on a rhythmic chant idea [...] I actually wrote with [...] Jonathan Elias [...] and this was like the centre part of this will be the last song. We've done all of the other songs. And it became the one that me and my wife, especially my wife Jane, loves. [...] It's just something that happened very organically.\" The interviewer then asked how long the composition took: \"I'd say over a period of the final month [...] I remember starting it off and then we've tidied up a couple of other pieces of music and came back to it again, to get on with it and then we kept going back to it. Is it finished? No, it's not finished yet. We had a very spacey middle section, which reminded me of the middle of \"Close to the Edge\" where everything was very surreal. And eventually I found a pathway to sing, and that's when Richie found the next level, which was to bring in the introductory vocal [...] in the end section. And all of a sudden he\"s playing this most beautiful guitar solo.\" Referencing the \"tiki\" section of the song, Anderson explained further: \"It was a spontaneous sound [...] And I thought, where am I going with this? And then I left it alone and then went back to it and I thought, well, we've got to get into the next part. Richie came up with the next part, and then I came up with another part, and it was like building a castle, sort of thing, sand castle.\"\n\n\"Thank God\" was written for Anderson's wife Jane around the time of The Ladder. It was recorded for the unreleased Jon Anderson/Phil Keaggy/Robin Crow album. In the talkshoplive interview, Anderson said, \"it was totally [about] Jane [...] I was working [...] on an album up in Canada, at that time, with Yes [i.e., The Ladder]. And me and Jane went to a small, beautiful studio near Nashville that was run by a guy called Robin Crow. And over a period of the Christmas and New Year, we wrote an album, and one of the songs was this song. And it's the only song that will ever come out of that period of time.\"\n\nThe 2023 tour was billed as 'Yes Epics & Classics featuring Jon Anderson and The Band Geeks': there were 12 eastern US dates Apr/May 2023. 28 Apr, 29 Apr and 16 May all sold out. The band had started rehearsing in Dec 2021. In a late Mar 2023 interview, Anderson said, \"We've been working, Zooming each other for the last month, every Tuesday. Basically going through all the songs we're gonna do and, now, I've got them all lined up on my computer and I come in every day and sing them all\". They had 6 days of in-person rehearsals before the tour started. The opening night set in 2023 was: intro music: \"Firebird Suite\", \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Perpetual Change\", \"Close to the Edge\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\", \"Starship Trooper\", \"Awaken\" (Anderson also on harp), intermission, \"And You and I\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Ritual\" (Castellano also on drums), \"Rhythm of Love\" (Castellano on guitar), \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" (Castellano on guitar), \"Roundabout\". \"Rhythm of Love\" was dropped on all subsequent nights. \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" was dropped from 1 date later in the tour. \"Ritual\" was replaced by \"The Gates of Delirium\" at later shows; the band switched between the two. Castellano posted to Facebook a video of the Geeks using \"Leave It\" as a vocal warm-up exercise on tour. At some later shows, Rob Schmoll, Anderson's tech, guested in spots on acoustic guitar, including \"And You and I\" and \"I've Seen All Good People\". The Band Geeks' Ann Marie Nacchio guested on additional vocals for the final 2 songs at the 16 Apr Newark show. Sound mix was by Steve La Cerra. Ezra Donellan was the lighting designer. Byrne also did the video backdrops for the tour. The shows were recorded. In a gear walk-through video, Castellano hinted at a possible live release from the tour.\n\nPrior promo had also suggested \"The Gates of Delirium\" might be played. That piece was mentioned in a Prog article (in issue 128, Mar 2022) by Anderson as well. In an Aug 2022 article, Anderson said he contacted Castellano in Nov 2021, and ideas for the set included \"The Gates of Delirium\" and \"Mind Drive\". In the Apr 2023 interview, Anderson also mentioned \"The Gates of Delirium\" and \"Mind Drive\". He continued:\n\nPeople wonder if were going to do Owner of a Lonely Heart. I dont know. [Laughs.] Id rather do Roundabout and Perpetual Change and songs I remember helping to create. The important thing is to perform them as though they were written this year. They are still I wouldnt say different, but still very fresh in the musical sense.\n\nThe Band Geeks, led by Castellano, have covered several Yes pieces previously, available on YouTube. In Jul 2022, Castellano said on YouTube, \"we're [...] preparing for the Jon Anderson shows in 2023. So, we've been rehearsing, pretty steadily, since [...] January [2022]\". Early May 2022, Tim Franklin said on Facebook, \"Jon is rehearsing with band geeks.\" It appears plans may date back to 2019. In a Jul 2019 interview, Anderson said, \"this came to me yesterday[.] I've always wanted to go on tour and do seven classic [Yes] epics, which would be 'Close to the Edge,' tracks one and four of Topographic Oceans, 'The Gates of Delirium,' 'Awaken,' and [...] 'Mind Drive.' [...] I'd love to do them with visuals, and do them in surround sound, and really do an incredible version of everything. And I think I've found the band the other day, this fantastic band in New York, they play Yes music just like Yes music, it's unbelievable to hear them.\"\n\n1000 Hands Website; Facebook;Twitter\n\nAnderson released 1000 Hands: Chapter One with producer Michael Franklin (worked with Rick Wakeman, Patrick Moraz, Bobby Kimball, Gloria Gaynor), a development of his 1990s Uzlot sessions with Brian Chatton (ex-Warriors, ex-Jackson Heights). Details in Yescography. The album was originally available solely from a dedicated website and at tour dates. Anderson said in 2020 interviews that they couldn't get a record deal. (In an early Jul 2020 interview with Malcolm Wyatt, Anderson explained about how the album was released: \"the record companies weren't very interested. Even Atlantic Records turned me down.\") The album has now had a general release, on CD, 180g 2LP and digital, through Blue Élan Records. There was a livestreamed promo event on 2 Aug 2020 (archived on YouTube). This consisted of a long interview with Anderson plus pre-recorded performances with members of his touring band: Joe Cosas, Tim Franklin (Michael Franklin's brother), Jocelyn Hsu, Tommy Calton, Rayford Griffin, William \"Billy\" Meether and Zach Tenorio.\n\nAnderson and Franklin have been working on a follow-up, Chapter Two, with guests to include Rick Wakeman and Trevor Rabin, but this has been substantially delayed. Anderson wrote 10 Feb 2020 online about being \"Back in Solar Studio last week... busy with so much new music\". In the Jul 2020 Wyatt interview, he said, \"we've been working on half a dozen or so songs already, and more follow every week. I've an idea for one large piece that could work, but it takes time to sort that out. [...] we'll be able to release part two next summer maybe.\" In the Aug 2020 livestream, he said the album would be out in 2021. He explained, \"There were more songs created when we were doing Chapter One.\" He then mentioned a cover of John Lennon's \"Nobody Told Me\", which he was working on during the original 1990 Uzlot sessions. In an Aug 2020 interview (released Oct 2020), he said they would probably put it on Chapter Two. In another Aug 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"We [himself and Franklin] are connected to do chapter two and we have already done half a dozen songs. We are going to do some more in the new year [2021], and release that next Christmas [2021].\" The Jon Anderson and 1000 Hands Facebook account reported \"a few days of 1000 Hands sessions\" in Oct 2021. Early May 2022, Tim Franklin said in Facebook, \"Chapter 2 of 1000 hands is nearing completion.\" Anderson said in a Jul 2022 interview that they were:\n\nactually right in the middle of completing Chapter Two, with Michael Franklin producing. So we never stopped thinking about carrying on with the idea of bringing in very, very interesting musicians like we did on the first project. Theres so much incredible talent around and Michael knows so many musicians who he gets to play on the songs I send him. So were about half-way through the production and it should be ready for next year [2023], we hope (laughing).\n\nHe had also said to a fan in Jul 2022 that he had been hoping for an autumn 2022 release. He said to a fan in Oct 2022 that he hoped the album would be out by Apr 2023 (in time for his tour with the Band Geeks). A 2023 release did not come, however. Anderson has also said that Chapter Two will also be released in a 2CD set with Chapter One.\n\nOn 19 Nov 2022, M Franklin said on Facebook: \"Back at work on 1000 Hands Chapter 2, Hoping for a release early in the new year [2023]. A few notes from Joe Bonamassa, Bruce Hornsby, Abe Laborial Jr, Rick Wakeman, Trevor Rabin, Ian Anderson and others. Piles of new songs, trying to figure out what's the right ingredients for the stew.\" In a Dec 2022 interview, Franklin said they were hoping to finish the album by Xmas 2022 and for a release date of 16 Apr 2023. He also said that Wakeman had already recorded a part; and he implied that they are using a composition by Hornsby. He also said that he heard Bonamassa playing \"Heart of the Sunrise\" and then reached out to him via a mutual contact about playing on the album; Bonamassa plays on 1 track. Franklin continued, \"Chapter Two is a little bit more of a continuum than separate songs. [ ] There's a thread through the whole thing.\" And: \"There's an overture [ ] a small overture. [...] There's some quotes from Chapter One on Chapter Two.\" He also said that, \"I've got more than enough songs for Chapter Two\", and, \"I'm working on one [song] right now that's not even on Chapter Two that's a monster [ ] song. [ ] I heard it and said, 'Oh my god, I've gotta work on this.' So, I have two songs that are lengthy, that are not on Chapter Two, that are pretty much finished, but that will be maybe Chapter Three.\" On 6 Dec 2022, Gabe Treiyer (worked with Steve Rothery, Bobby Kimball) announced on Facebook that he would \"be recording some guitars for the next Jon Anderson's album!!!\" In Jan 2023, Franklin said Victor Wooten (Béla Fleck and the Flecktones) plays bass on 1 track.\n\nIn an Apr 2023 interview, Anderson said of the album, \"We're working on it. I reckon that it's going to be ready next year [2024]. I've been writing some songs.\" On 4 Apr 2023, Franklin said on Facebook that the \"Estimated release date\" for the album was Oct 2023, which again didn't happen, and that Billy Cobham also returned for Chapter Two. In a Sep 2023 interview, Franklin implied the album was not yet finalised. In a mid-Sep 2023 Patreon appearance, Anderson said the album was still coming along. In Sep 2023, Jimmy Haun (Arc of Life, worked with Yes) talked of material he had written with Anderson ending up on Chapter Two (details below). In a Jan 2024 Facebook post, Franklin said he was currently mixing a Jon Anderson project with Bernie Grundman, which I would guess was Chapter Two, but could have been something else. Later in the first quarter of 2024, Franklin said on Facebook, \"No release date for Chapter 2 at present, Jon is touring this year with The Band Geeks [see below] and they will have an album to support that tour. The more time I have with Chapter 2, the better it will be, more guests and more thoughts about production.\"\n\nIn this Feb 2019 interview and another article that month, Anderson had said Chapter Two would probably be worked on winter 2019/20 for a 2020 release. In the first interview, he said it will be based on \"some songs that I wrote at that time\" (i.e., the same time as the original Uzlot sessions). In the second article, he said, \"we have a lot of songs left over\". In a Mar 2018 interview, Anderson described how working on the project, they had enough material for two albums, and he talked of the second coming out, \"next year [2020] maybe the year after [2021]\". In a Jul 2019 interview, Anderson said of Chapter Two: \"We're working on it now, I actually recently sang some parts live from a new song that we have. We have about half a dozen songs and another few more coming in the next six months. So probably a release after touring in spring or summer of next year [2020].\" An Aug 2019 interview reported that Anderson \"plans on adding another three [songs] in September and then finishing up the record next summer.\" In another Aug 2019 interview, Anderson said, \"I was working on it [Chapter Two] just before the tour. I've got four songs that we've got ready and Michael Franklin was doing some production on it. Then I found another song which is linked together with another one. When I get home, I'll probably send Michael about 10 more!\" The album will include \"songs that I was writing around that [Uzlot] period [...] the idea of chapter two should be maybe a couple more 'vocalizationing' projects [i.e. like \"Ramalama\" and \"WDMCF\"] which I have [...] I know I've got a couple of large scale pieces that I've always wanted to get into production and I'll throw them at Michael and say, 'Sort that out!'\" In an Aug 2020 interview, Anderson said he had no plans \"at the moment\" to write more with Chatton. He then talked of having \"two or three\" Uzlot songs being worked on, including \"Welcome Touch\", plus \"four or five\" more (presumably not from Uzlot). In a Nov 2020 interview, he said they had \"about nine songs\" from the Uzlot sessions: with 5 used on Chapter One, that would leave 4 remaining. Chatton told a fan in Oct 2022 that there should be 1-2 Uzlot songs on Chapter Two. In another Nov 2020 interview, asked if he was working on Chapter Two, Anderson replied, \"I am, all the time. And Chapter Three. And Chapter Four (laughs). Well, I've had six months off, and all I want to do is get all my songs together and kind of finish them. Most of the time, I'd be on tour after a year. Now, I've got the chance to finish all this work.\" In a Feb 2021 interview, he said, \"we've got four more tracks. We've done five more [new tracks] for the Chapter Two, if it ever comes together.\"\n\nBut in the Jul 2021 issue of Goldmine, Anderson said:\n\nI'm not going to release another album  I had an album called 1000 Hands  Chapter One [...] that I thought was going to be a Grammy Award-winning album  obviously not [...] you start thinking, 'I'm not going to aim for that ever again.'\n\nInstead, I'm just going to release all the music I've made over the last few years in various formats  downloads, singles, videos and so on.\n\nIn a Sep 2019 interview, Anderson said: \"Ive been going back and exploring Bulgarian singers. I talked to Michael Franklin about doing some chorale work and how it would be great to get some choirs to join in an ensemble fashion. We could get them to come in and do that kind of harmonic thing rather than just come in and sing. We could do something special with a chorale and expand the idea over the next couple of years and that would be the next chapter\".\n\nAnderson has also been working further with M Franklin, Calton and others in the band; it is unclear whether this work is connected to Chapter Two. He said in a Feb 2021 interview, \"Tommy Calton [...] sent me a track about a month ago. It was, at that moment, just what I needed, so I sang this song \"Just What I Needed.\" I listened to it today, sent it to Tommy and said, \"I love this song. I'm not quite sure how we're going to project it into the world.\" He shared the song on Facebook on 7 Feb 2021. Anderson and Calton then released a cover of \"Now\" on YouTube in Aug 2021. They released a Xmas song on YouTube, \"I Believe\", on 18 Dec 2021, written by Anderson/Calton, performed by Anderson (vocals), Calton (guitar), T Franklin (bass) and M Franklin (orchestrations). The song was produced by M Franklin and engineered by Matt Brown, with a video by Michael Byrne. (There was then a second video for \"I Believe\" uploaded in Mar 2022.) A video for \"First Born Leaders\", seemingly re-recorded with the live band, came on 12 Jan 2022. Anderson and Calton then released \"Here We Go Again\" on YouTube on 27 Feb 2022, a protest song against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with a video by Byrne. On 11 Mar 2022, again with a video by Byrne, Anderson released \"Song for Peace (Compassion Mix)\" on YouTube, with music by Glenn Arpino. (This appears to be unrelated to Kitaro's \"Song for Peace\" that Anderson sung on live.) Jun 2022 then brought a cover of The Beach Boys' \"God Only Knows\", sung by Anderson, with music arranged and produced by M Franklin, and art design and video editing by Alvaro Ortega. This was in celebration of Brian Wilson's 80th birthday. \"To Song To Song To Song\" was uploaded to YouTube on 14 Jul 2022 (with no performer or writing credits). Credited to Anderson/Calton, 26 Dec 2022 brought the Xmas song, \"Love This Ever Life\" to YouTube, with a video by Byrne. 5 Dec 2023 brought \"Christmas EP 2023\" on YouTube, which brings together 5 songs Anderson has previously released online: \"I Believe\" (2021): \"Love is Everything\" (2020); \"Now\" (the 2021 Anderson/Calton version); \"Just What I Needed\" (2022); and \"Love This Ever Life\" (2022).\n\nThe Jul 2020 Wyatt interview also hints at a possible live release from touring in support of Chapter One: \"I'm doing videos at the moment from a live show on the tour  around 10 days in  and it turned out to be a pretty good recording. [...] We're also recording ourselves at home, recording some of the songs from 1,000 Hands. And it sounded really good.\" In a Dec 2020 Facebook post, Anderson said, \"I'm just finishing a wonderful 'Live' 1,000 Hands Concert release for the New Year [2021].\" No more was heard about this for a while, until the mid-Sep 2023 Patreon appearance, in which Anderson said they were considering live releases.\n\nAnderson has also been working with Franklin on a project developing out of his 2019 Opus series. Chapter One tracks were:\n\n\"Now\" [Anderson/Chatton] (1:13; Uzlot song)\n\n\"Ramalama\" [Anderson/Franklin] (3:49; new song)\n\n\"First Born Leaders\" [Anderson/Chatton] (5:22; Uzlot song), with Chris Squire, Alan White, Larry Coryell (worked with Bill Bruford, Charles Mingus, Kazumi Watanabe)\n\n\"Activate\" [Anderson/Chatton] (8:51; Uzlot song), with Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull), Robbie Steinhardt (ex-Kansas), Squire, Coryell, Steve Morse (worked with Steve Howe), Pat Travers\n\n\"Makes Me Happy\" [Anderson] (3:50; new song), with Rick Derringer, Michael Winslow\n\n\"Now Variations\" [Anderson/Chatton] (1:03; variation on \"Now\")\n\n\"I Found Myself\" [Anderson] (5:05; new song), with and dedicated to Jane Anderson\n\n\"Twice in a Lifetime\" [Anderson/Chatton] (5:06; Uzlot song); listed as \"Twice Upon a Lifetime\" in the liner notes\n\n\"WDMCF\" [Anderson/Franklin] (4:11; new song; short for \"Where Does Music Come From\")\n\n\"1,000 Hands (Come Up)\" [Anderson/Chatton] (8:24; Uzlot song), with Squire, Billy Cobham (ex-Miles Davis, ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra, worked with Larry Coryell, Peter Gabriel), Chick Corea (Return to Forever, ex-Miles Davis, worked with Larry Coryell), Jean-Luc Ponty (Anderson Ponty Band, ex-Mahavishnu Orchestra, ex-Frank Zappa, worked with Elton John, Chick Corea), Coryell, Jonathan Cain (Journey)\n\n\"Now and Again\" [Anderson/Chatton] (3:40; variation on \"Now\"), with Steve Howe\n\nThe album was arranged by Franklin and Anderson, and recorded and mixed by Matt Brown. Brown also drums, while other notable performers include Tim Franklin (Michael's brother; bass), Carmine Appice (Vanilla Fudge, worked with Pink Floyd, Jan Akkerman; drums), Jerry Goodman (violin) and Steady Joseph (percussion). Videos were initially released for \"Now\", \"Ramalama\" (seemingly by Deborah Anderson), \"Activate\", \"Makes Me Happy\" (shot with Deborah and Jane Anderson, produced by Deborah), \"Now Variations\", \"I Found Myself\", \"WDMCF\" and \"1,000 Hands (Come Up)\" (by Michael Byrne). A video of an extended version (8:33) of \"WDMCF\" was uploaded to YouTube on 30 Aug 2019. A video of a new mix of 1,0000 Hands (Come Up)\" (8:33) was uploaded to YouTube on 19 Nov 2019. All these videos were removed in the first half of 2020. There is an alternative version of the \"Makes Me Happy\" video still online.\n\nAnderson told the story in an interview released Mar 2018, but seemingly recorded Oct 2017: \"[Franklin] got in touch with me about a year ago [so, 2016]. He asked me about this project I started 27 years ago, 28 years ago [...] the tapes got put in my garage and I forgot about them, because I was on tour with, with Yes and recording other albums and things like that. [...] So, Michael [...] we got together in California where I live and he said, er, 'Why don't you come over to Orlando and do some work on the tapes and make the music happen.' [...] 27 years later, we're finishing it\". In the Jul 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"I would listen to the tapes from time to time and think, 'This could have been a great album. One day I'll finish it'.\" In the Yorkshire Post Jul 2020 interview, Anderson said: \"life happened and they never got finished. Brian tried to turn them into more commercial songs  that didn't quite work; I went on tour.\" In a third Jul 2020 interview, with God is in the TV, Anderson said: \"This producer guy tried to work with Brian and mix some of the songs a year later, around 1991, but it didn't sound very good to me, so I just thought \"Oh well, I'll just let go of it for now,\" but he's this guy who lives in Orlando and he's surrounded by musicians everywhere because of Disneyworld, Universal Studios [...] so I mentioned to him that I'd like to...\" This was M Franklin, first working on the material in 1991. In a Dec 2022 interview, Franklin said Chatton first brought him in to orchestrate 4 songs. In an Aug 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"[Chatton] had an idea of how he wanted to hear the tracks and he actually spent time and money working on it. He sent me the mixes and I said: 'Actually Brian, it's a little bit too overproduced. Love you man! But let's leave it for now.'\" The early '90s sessions are the Uzlot sessions and all the Anderson/Chatton co-writes are rooted in this period. In a 6 Feb 2019 Facebook post, Anderson described the Uzlot sessions as having music written by Chatton, but vocal melodies and lyrics by himself, and the sessions as starting with himself, Chatton (keys), Heffner (keys), Gary Barlow (producer/engineer). Further sessions took place with Hamm (bass), Squire (bass), White (drums), Heffner (keys) and others, and at least 8 songs were recorded. All of Squire's and White's contributions are from this period. In the third Jul 2020 interview, Anderson said these original sessions lasted \"about three months\". Anderson and Chatton remained in touch about the project after those original sessions. A piece by Anderson and Chatton entitled \"Welcome Touch\" is available on Chatton's MySpace page (dated 2007), but it is unclear when it was recorded; the song also dates to the original Uzlot sessions, although it is unknown whether that recording was from then. Artist Ed Unitsky did a video for \"Welcome Touch\", which was previously available on Facebook. On ProgressiveEars.com in Jan 2017, Chatton said, \"The Uzlot project is still unfinished. We have 7 songs in the pipeline and as soon as Jon has the time, it will be mastered and released.\"\n\nM Franklin and Anderson re-engaged. In some versions of the story, Franklin approached Anderson about releasing the album. In the Yorkshire Post interview, Anderson described how work re-started when Franklin said he had \"some capital\" to complete the record. In the God in the TV interview, Anderson says he approached Franklin. They had to bake the earlier 24-track tapes, and new sessions began. The modern recordings were done at Solar Studios, Orlando, FL. Anderson went on in his Mar 2018-published interview to say they were \"finishing the album over the next month\", although there were additional sessions in Mar/Apr 2018, including shooting for four accompanying videos. In a May 2018 interview, Anderson said some songs may be released to YouTube beforehand. In another later that month, he said he had just completed work on the album. In a third May 2018 interview, Anderson explained: \"I had tapes lying around in my garage that I'd been working on for years and I got this great producer and said that I really wanted people who I'd met with throughout my life to play on it [...] and it sounds like it was made last week. Some of the recordings go back years but we have upgraded them and improved them over the years but the songs still sounded great. I've written 3 or 4 new songs to go with it\". An Aug 2018 report had that the album was due in Sep 2018, to be released in three parts. In an interview conducted late Aug 2018, Anderson just said the album would be out \"next month\". In an interview conducted late Jul 2018, Anderson said he was \"going to Orlando to finish mixing next week\". He described the project there thus: \"I started a piece of music 28 years ago in Big Bear, which is southeast of L.A. I was just getting away from the world for three months, and I decided to do an album[.] But it never got finished because life is like that. Now, 28 years later, I'm just finishing five of the songs, plus five new songs and an album called 1,000 Hands.\" Talking more, he said, \"there's one or two obvious good radio songs. Whether they'll go viral or whatever, who cares. You know, it's what it is. But all you want is for people to hear what you do. I even do some dance EDM music on one track on the album. One track on it is very EDM. Because I've been doing some of that [over the] last year.\" An early Sep 2018 interview has Anderson as having just finished mixing, and again reference to 5 songs being from 28 years ago and some EDM being on the album. On Facebook, Franklin described Grundman as mastering the album on 31 Aug 2018. Anderson, M Franklin, bassist T Franklin and drummer Brown were back in the studio in Sep 2018 for video shoots; Michael described \"9 videos in progress\" on Facebook. On 7 Feb, Deborah Anderson a picture with her father captioned, \"When your dad asks you to create a music video for the first single off his latest album in one day using a green screen to transport him all over the world, this is what happens\".\n\nIn the Yorkshire Post interview (Jul 2020), Anderson said of the finished album: \"In its complete idea it is exactly what I was thinking at that time [when he first started the Uzlot sessions] The lyrics haven't changed in two thirds of the songs, we've been able to add some of the creme de la creme of music on it\". Anderson has said the first of the recent sessions was with Cobham on \"Come Up\" (although in other accounts, it wasn't the first session), while Corea also recorded parts for that song a year later. Ponty's contributions are also recent. Oct 2017 sessions for the album were with Anderson, M Franklin, T Franklin, Brown, Snapp, Scanlon, Galotta, Calton, Steinhardt, Chalk. Other performers mentioned include Jocelyn Hsu (Violectric, Tallahassee Symphony Orchestra; violin, backing vocals). In a joint interview with Jon and Ian Anderson for the Aug 2018 issue of Record Collector, Ian Anderson described his contribution, which were done recently, with Ian recording it in his home office, as being for \"a long, epic song [...] very much in the progressive rock tradition\". Corea was recording in Mar 2018. Travers posted to Facebook about meeting Anderson on 23 Apr 2018 at Orlando, FL sessions with Franklin: he is guesting on a song. He described the music thus: \"mostly Jon Anderson sounding. Lots of instrumentation, strings, horns, harp, keyboards, guitar in and out, and a lot of wonderful choral performances. This one is very special.\" Violinist Michelle Jones (Violectric, worked with Sarah Brightman, Art Garfunkel) also posted to Facebook about doing a recording session (possibly just for the video) with Anderson on 23 Apr.\n\nA Mar 2019 interview confirms that Howe's contribution was recent (but recorded remotely). In another Mar 2019 interview, Anderson said:\n\nI just felt that I was gonna ask if he would play on the last song which was \"Now and Again\" and he played this beautiful guitar work on it and... 'Cos we met up at the Hall Of Fame and everything, and I kept looking at him saying, \"We're gonna sing together! We're gonna work together again!\" [...] So he sent this recording back and I just wanted to sing with him so I sang on it, added some lyric and... In fact, the lyric is about me and him. And it was great to [...] sing with him again. We connected again, shall we say.\n\nIn another interview later that same month, Anderson explained, \"I just called him up and he said he'd love to play on it[.] I haven't sang with him in many, many years. It felt really comfortable and cathartic to do that. We're brothers. Sometimes you don't understand or misunderstand your brother and want to do different things. I think that is called a family.\"\n\nAnderson was touring in support. In the third May 2018 interview mentioned above, Anderson said he would do a solo tour in 2019 \"with a full orchestra and choir doing 1000 Hands and [...] Olias [of] Sunhillow.\" He also mentioned \"State of Independence\" would be in the set. In an early Feb 2019 Facebook post, Anderson said the tour would include, \"New songs from 1,000 Hands, and a couple of Olias songs\". The touring band has been Anderson (vocals, tambourine, acoustic guitar), M Franklin (keys, backing vocals, producer, musical director), T Franklin (bass, backing vocals), Tommy Calton (guitar), Jocelyn Hsu (violin, ukulele, backing vocals), Joe Cosas (keys, trombone, guitar, ukulele, backing vocals; also described as Anderson's music director in a May 2021 article), Steady Joseph (percussion), Billy Meether (saxes, flute, guitar, backing vocals) and, on drums, Matt Brown at the Epcot shows and Rayford Griffin (works with Jean-Luc Ponty, Anderson Ponty Band, worked with Stanley Clarke, George Duke) subsequently. Zach Tenorio (previously worked with Anderson) joined from the second leg of 2019 touring.\n\nMid-Jan 2019, the project's Facebook account said the band will be \"performing the music of Yes, Jon and Vangelis, Olias and 1000 Hands.\" On 21 Feb, Anderson described rehearsals as having begun in Florida, and that they \"will be playing the classic YES songs, songs from the new 1000 Hands album, plus a few surprises, including a couple of Olias songs\". The project website describes a \"world tour\" and gave 25 US dates 11 Mar-12 May. A 19 Apr show was cancelled: reports suggest because of poor ticket sales. 10 May was a private show and 12 May was part of the Kaaboo Festival, TX. A second run of dates begins with a ticketed rehearsal 22-3 Jul at Levon Helm Studios, Woodstock, plus a 24 Jul show there. Then there were 18 more US dates 24 Jul-1 Sep. Chatton attended the final show on the tour. On Facebook in late Feb 2019, Anderson said, \"Looking forward to seeing you everywhere over the next 3 years or so... this tour is all about playing to as many people as possible.\" Before the tour, on 26 Feb 2019 in New York, NY, there was an album launch event with a Q&A, including about 1000 Hands, a preview of the album, and a short solo set on acoustic guitar (\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Your Move\"). This was livestreamed and is now on YouTube. The band then played warm-up shows 11-2 Mar at Epcot, three a night; sets varied, but covered \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"America\", \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Makes Me Happy\", \"Roundabout\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Starship Trooper\", \"Ramalama\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"WDMCF\", \"Starship Trooper\"/\"Solid Space\" (extract). The first regular show was on 29 Mar 2019. The band played for 1 hour 35 minutes, plus an intermission. Set: intro music: \"Ocean Song\"; \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Ramalama\", \"State of Independence\" (Change We Must arrangement), \"Makes Me Happy\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"WDMCF (Where Does Music Come From)\"; intermission; \"Flight of the Moorglade\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"To the Runner\", \"First Born Leaders\", \"America\", \"1,000 Hands (Come Up)\"/\"Starship Trooper\"/\"Solid Space\" (extract); encore: \"Roundabout\". Estimates for the audience size: two fans estimated 300-400, but another thought over 1000. The third regular show saw a slight variation, with the show the same up to \"I've Seen All Good People\", but then went: \"America\", \"WDMCF (Where Does Music Come From)\"; intermission; \"Flight of the Moorglade\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"To the Runner\", \"Long Distance Runaround\", \"First Born Leaders\", and then as before. Support has been by a number of different acts. The 3 Apr show had students from the Paul Green Rock Academy, who played \"South Side of the Sky\" within their set. For the second leg's set list, Anderson said in a Jul 2019 interview, \"We'll be doing \"Ramalama\" and \"Makes Me Happy\" [...] We're going to rehearse a few more weeks to develop the longer pieces like \"Starship Trooper\" and \"Yours Is No Disgrace.\" People want to hear those songs. So do I.\" He also seemed to suggest they would do \"First Born Leaders\". The 26 and 27 Jul sets were intro music: \"Ocean Song\"; \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"Ramalama\", \"State of Independence\", \"Makes Me Happy\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"America\", \"WDMCF (Where Does Music Come From)\", \"The Chicken\" (Pee Wee Ellis cover, instrumental version); intermission; \"To the Runner\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"Flight of the Moorglade\", \"Long Distance Runaround\", \"Wonderous Stories\", \"First Born Leaders\", \"1,000 Hands (Come Up)\"/\"Starship Trooper\"; encore: \"Roundabout\", \"Soon\". Support at the 29 Jul show was from the Paul Green School of Rock: they ended their set with \"South Side of the Sky\", with Anderson joining on backing vocals. Trevor Rabin was in the audience at an Aug show.\n\nAs for future touring, in an Aug 2019 interview, Anderson said, \"On the next next tour I want to do 'Close to the Edge'  for some reason I think this band would really have a great time performing it  and maybe 'Ritual'.\"\n\nMany of the 1000 Hands team, including the Franklins, Calton, Hsu and Griffin, are on Robby Steinhardt's posthumous solo album Not in Kansas Anymore, produced by M Franklin. In the Dec 2022 interview, Franklin described how the project began: he brought Steinhardt in to play on \"Activate\" on 1000 Hands: Chapter One and then on a second song intended for that album, \"Climb to Grace\", which Franklin had built around a vocal from Anderson. However, this \"was too similar to something else\" on the album, so it wasn't used. He then persuaded Steinhardt to do a solo project and brought that song over, which became \"Rise of the Phoenix (Climb to Grace)\" on Not in Kansas Anymore. See further details under Patrick Moraz, who guests.\n\nWith The Paul Green Rock Academy\n\nIn an Aug 2023 interview, Anderson said a new US tour with The Paul Green Rock Academy is already contracted, and that they are planning a world tour from 2024 covering Europe, Australia and Japan, lasting 2-3 years. However, reports in Dec 2023 suggest this isn't happening now, with his touring focus switching to the Band Geeks.\n\nAnderson's tour with children from The Paul Green Rock Academy performing all of Close to the Edge came to Europe with 11 dates Jul/Aug 2023. The Paul Green Rock Academy also played as the support act. The 9 Jul date in Budapest, Hungary was a co-headlining show with Manfred Mann's Earth Band; set: \"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Kashmir\" (originally by Led Zeppelin), \"South Side of the Sky\", \"Fly Away\" (originally by Lenny Kravitz)/\"Long Distance Runaround\", \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Perpetual Change\", \"Leave It\", \"Close to the Edge\", \"And You and I\", \"Siberian Khatru\", \"Let's Dance\" (originally by David Bowie)/\"Starship Trooper\", \"Roundabout/Heart of the Sunrise\" (with just a few bars of \"Heart of the Sunrise\").

Anderson uploaded a YouTube live video of \"Close to the Edge\" being performed. They played 13 US dates Jul/Aug 2022, performing all of Close to the Edge. Green has also said on Facebook, \"We are so trying to bring this to Europe next summer...just need the pandemic stuff to die down a little more.\" Advertising says there will be 25 students playing with Anderson. The students are 14-17 years old and were rehearsing with Green in late Jun/early Jul. They perform two sets of about an hour each, with an intermission between. On 22 Jul, the second set was: \"Close to the Edge\", \"And You and I\", \"Siberian Khatru\", \"Open\" (extract; just Anderson on vocals and acoustic guitar), \"Starship Trooper\" (including a vocalisation duet in \"Würm\"), \"Roundabout\" (with band intros). Sets have also included \"Lose Yourself\" (originally by Eminem), \"America\", \"Fly Away\" (female lead vocalist with Anderson on acoustic guitar and backing vocals), \"Kashmir\", \"Long Distance Runaround/The Fish\" (with saxophone, then electric guitar, then keyboard, then another electric guitar, then bass solos on \"The Fish\", and vocals from Anderson and four girls), \"Don't Kill the Whale\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\", \"Mood for a Day\" (done as an acoustic guitar duet), \"State of Independence\", \"Leave It\" (with massed vocals) and \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". It was reported that at a Jul show, as it was their wedding anniversary, Jon's wife Jane guested on stage, playing guitar. Over the course of the tour, different students have rotated in and out. The students have included Dylan Craft (drums) and Asher Logan (drums). In Florida, during their Apr 2022 tour (see next paragraph), Anderson recorded a new song, \"So Limitless\", with the Paul Green Rock Academy touring band (directed by Paul Green). The song was produced by Michael Franklin. The Academy members in the video are Christian Gallucci, Finn Vora, Harry Bricklin, Jenna Love, Linnea McKinney, Mae Weaver, Oscar Resti, Sean Coughlin and Tess Lobell.\n\nThe spring 2022 tour included headlining RoSFest on 16 Apr 2022, in Florida, and 4 more dates in Georgia and Florida 6-14 Apr. The Rock Academy played an opening set without Anderson, with the set including \"21st Century Schizoid Man\". Set: \"Sun is Calling/Yours is No Disgrace\" (with at least 12 Academy members), \"All Good People\", \"WDMCF\", \"Fly Away\" (originally by Lenny Kravtiz)/\"Long Distance Runaround\", \"Makes Me Happy\", \"Mood for a Day\", \"And You and I\" (with Rob Schmoll guesting on 12-string acoustic guitar, at least on 6 Apr), \"Heart of the Sunrise\", \"Starship Trooper\", \"Kashmir/Don't Kill the Whale\" (\"Kashmir\" had a female lead vocalist, while the female vocalist and Anderson duetted on \"Don't Kill the Whale\"; both parts had Anderson on acoustic guitar and an electric cellist), \"Screw\" (excerpt; just Anderson on vocals and acoustic guitar), \"Lose Yourself\"/\"State of Independence\", \"Clap\", \"America\" (semi-acoustic, with vocals jointly by Anderson and two female vocalists), \"Close to the Edge\" (with 10 Academy members on stage, including a saxophonist), \"Owner of a Lonely Heart/Roundabout\".\n\nAnderson played 12 eastern US shows Jul/Aug 2021; the 3, 5 & 7 Aug shows sold out. He was joined by 27 members of the Paul Green Rock Academy on the first leg, and 25 on the second leg, who were around 13-19 years old. The students were not paid and had to cover their travel expenses. The band rehearsed in Jul. The tour was re-scheduled from Jun/Jul 2020 shows that were cancelled because of the pandemic. There's a preview video of Anderson and the kids playing \"Heart of the Sunrise\", directed by Jake Dittus. The video was produced by Brian Bricklin. The student music supervisors were Brian and Harry Bricklin, while the student vocal coordinator was Addie Teolis. Performing were:\n\nDrums: Asher Blum, Harry Bricklin, Jack Kelly, Max Makover\n\nBass: Gabriela \"Gabby\" Gonzalez, Ben Teolis, Finn Suárez Vora\n\nGuitar: Ben Bricklin, Jake Dittus, Aiden Hammel, Andrei Orasanu, Tess Turner, Vora\n\nKeys: Luke Baron, Charlotte Hamilton, Vora\n\nSaxophone: Jesse Beato\n\nHorns: Oscar Resti\n\nVocals: Justice Balabuszko, Gonzalez, Isabelle Gottfried, Charlotte Hamilton, Tess Lobell, Jackson Speller, Addie Teolis, Ben Teolis, Naomi Yanos\n\nLinnea McKinney also seems to have performed on vocals. Which students performed which parts rotated from show to show. The press release described \"a set of Yes Classics, deep cuts, mash ups, and solo works, all with lush arrangements featuring choral singing, [&] horns\". In a Jul 2021 interview, Anderson said: \"What I suggested for this tour, why don't we some mash-ups? Y'know, we could do \"Kashnu\" [?\"Khatru\" or \"Kashmir\"?] going into \"Yours is No Disgrace\". Or, y'know, the song I really like is, for the groove, is \"Need You Tonight\" by INXS. We can do that into \"Long Distance Runaround\".\" He also said, \"We'll probably record every show,\" hinting at a live release. In another Jul 2021 interview, Anderson talked further about mash-ups, including Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" going into \"Don't Kill the Whale\". The 3 Aug set was: set 1intro music: \"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\", \"Heart of the Sunrise\", \"Sun is Calling\" (Anderson solo)/\"Yours is No Disgrace\", \"I've Seen All Good People\", \"Lose Yourself\" (originally by Eminem), \"Lose Yourself\" (reprise)/\"State of Independence\", \"Sweet Dreams\", \"WDMCF\", \"Mood for a Day\" (Bricklin solo, but has been played by Vora at other shows), \"Wonderous Stories\" (with a grown-up, possibly Anderson's tour manager, on guitar), \"Need You Tonight/Another One Bites the Dust/Long Distance Runaround\", \"The Fish\"; set 2\"Kashmir/Don't Kill the Whale\" (with Anderson on bass), \"Leave It\", \"Screw\", \"Clap\" (guitar duet), \"America\" (with an arrangement following the Simon & Garfunkel original more than Yes's version), \"Makes Me Happy\", \"South Side of the Sky\", \"Let's Dance/Starship Trooper\"; encore\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", \"Roundabout\". The set varied somewhat across dates, e.g. \"Heart of the Sunrise\" moved to be later in the set. At at least some dates, the Rock Academy did a half-hour supporting set without Anderson, including King Crimson's \"Three of a Perfect Pair\".\n\nYouTube releases, including Opus Opus\n\nAnderson regularly releases new music on social media, mainly on YouTube, but also Facebook. In late Aug 2022, he uploaded four playlists, 11-13 songs long each, entitled Songs from Another World, Vol. 1, Vol. 2, Vol. 3 and Vol. 4. For Vol. 1 and 2, these are mostly pieces that were previously released on solo or Jon & Vangelis albums. However, in places, he appears to have overdubbed additional parts on the songs. However, on Vol. 3, over half the pieces were previously only released on social media: \"Love is Everything\", \"Surfing with God\", \"Rain Down\", \"The Gift\", \"I Believe It\" (previously released as \"I Believe\"), \"Just What I Needed\", and \"Earth and Peace\". Vol. 4 is similar.\n\nIn 2019, Anderson released four, related, instrumental, long-form pieces, free online: \"Opus No. 1 (Hopefulness)\" (30:48), \"Opus No. 2 (Joyfulness)\" (25:20), \"Opus No. 3 (Thankfulness)\" (21:00) and \"Opus No. 4 (Gratefulness)\" (19:06). Anderson has used \"Joyfulness\" to refer to the whole set as well, but they are listed as a YouTube playlist under the title Opus. Links are to YouTube videos; visuals are by Michael Byrne (Papercut), who said, \"Originally called Piano Lessons, [Anderson] spoke of Rachmaninoff and music.\" Byrne said on Facebook on 12 Nov 2020 that, \"This is a playlist to a piece of work Jon is developing at the min. He has asked me get some feedback from you wonderful people. Mainly about your thoughts on the pieces and how connected you are to it. Jon has talked about orchestras and choirs and a host of other amazing ideas and i'm aiming to do some amazing visuals to accompany these four movements. So if you can add some thoughts and ideas to the comments that would be really cool. Jon of course will be reading all in this brilliant interactive moment where fans can actually be involved in a piece of music.\" He continued on 18 Nov, saying:\n\nJon has asked me to set up some auditions as he would love to have you all singing on Joyfullness. Jon's criteria is that you should sing light and clear and in time not rock singing. You can send me a brief demo at mick-byrne@hotmail.co.uk and please title the email Demo Opus Joyfullness, this will help me organise them within my inbox.\n\n\"Hopefulness\" was released first in Jun 2019 on a Google drive, entitled \"Piano Lesson (2020)\", and announced via Facebook. It was also available on Anderson's SoundCloud under the name \"The Hopeless Opus\". The other three came on separate days, 6-11 Jul. The original YouTube uploads for the first two parts were replaced in Mar 2020; I'm uncertain if the music has changed. On 6 Sep 2022, \"Opus Opus - You are Everyone\" came to YouTube, which is a development of \"Opus No. 1 (Hopefulness)\", now with vocals. 4 Nov 2022 brought an updated version of \"Opus No. 2 (Joyfulness)\" (18:36), also now with vocals, and with orchestra by Bill Kilpatrick and a video by Byrne. In a late Mar 2023 interview, Anderson said, \"I've just done some surround sound mixes of \"Opus Opus\", which I'm very, very excited about.\" In the Jul 2023 issue of Prog (#141, out Jun), Anderson said, \"I also have another project called Opus, Opus, which is driving me crazy trying to mix it in surround sound. This will be a musical event with visuals projected in a dome, so I'm talking to a couple of venues about that.\" He has released material to his Patreons, including a 19:04 version of \"Joyfulness\" on 8 Dec 2023 after releasing subparts from Sep 2023. A 19:31 \"Joyfulness\" was then released 25 Feb 2024 on YouTube.\n\nA Jul 2020 interview with the Yorkshire Post described how Anderson and Michael Franklin (worked with Rick Wakeman, Patrick Moraz, Bobby Kimball, Gloria Gaynor), with whom Anderson did 1000 Hands: Chapter One, are \"now contemplating a choral album of four 20-minute pieces with orchestration.\" It then quoted Anderson: \"Since the beginning of the virus and we were told to stay home that's what I've been working on [...] I'm not going anywhere, so I've spent the last three months doing all this vocalising work on the music.\" In another Jul 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"I don't go out, because I'm asthmatic, so have to be careful, but all is good and I've just been working steadily for three months on a project which I'm very excited about.\" He said more in a third Jul 2020 interview:\n\nI was able to concentrate [during pandemic lockdown] on finishing the large scale epic that I started last year [2019]. I've spent three months on that. It's not finished completely  you can listen to the music because I did that last year in the space of one week. If you search for Jon Anderson's Joyfulness, it'll come up on YouTube. It's four movements, but then I decided that I liked the idea so much that maybe I should write songs and lyrics all the way through the whole thing. So it's four 19 minute pieces. For me it's become my focus for the next year [2021]. I still want to add choral and orchestra to it along the way.\n\nIn the Aug 2020 livestreamed event, Anderson talked about Byrne's visuals, saying, \"It's inspired me to write songs now within this music.\" In Dec 2021, Anderson's Patreon included an Opus extract with vocals.\n\nIn an Aug 2020 interview, Anderson said, \"Before we had to lock ourselves up and stay indoors, I had been working on a long project of music that, to me, feels like the Yes music people want to hear. It won't be finished until next year [2021], but we'll see what happens when people get a chance to hear it. It'll be fun.\" He continued:\n\nYou can actually go and listen to the blueprint on my YouTube channel [...] they're called \"Hopefulness,\" \"Joyfulness,\" \"Thankfulness,\" and \"Gratefulness.\" It's music I did in the space of one week, and then I ended up going on the tour with 1000 Hands [...] I came back afterwards [after the tour, late 2019], listened to all this music, and went, \"Actually, it works, all together.\"\n\nThey're each about 20-25 minutes long, and now I've spent the last three months writing lyrics and songs and melodies within the framework of what you hear. It's all about Mother Earth.\n\nAnderson has done some further work with Byrne: he sang on \"Dancin' and Jumpin'\", a song released to Soundcloud May 2018 by Irish band Papercut, with Byrne (keys, drums) and Liam \"Hippie\" Johnston (guitars). There is now a video on YouTube, credit to Jon Anderson/Michael Byrne. Anderson and Byrne also have a second collaboration, \"Andromeda\", on Soundcloud, then on YouTube, then (26 Sep 2021) in remastered form on YouTube. Byrne explained on Facebook in May 2018, \"He found me on Youtube, rang me up, got talking and here we are.\" Byrne has also uploaded their collaboration \"Whispers of Forgiveness\". Around the same time as the four \"Opus\" pieces, Byrne uploaded several other videos to YouTube. He did new visuals for \"Surfing with God\" (see below), \"Sing to Me\" (associated with Zamran), and a video for \"Come Up\" from 1000 Hands. There's also a cover of Radioh"
