        "text": "(a) From Hobbes to Rousseau: Understanding Domestic Sovereignty\n\n18 A hundred years after Bodin, the English author Thomas Hobbes recast the idea of sovereign authority with his Leviathan.\n\n19 In this first version of social contract theory, the sovereign is still conceived as an absolute master, but its power is clearly no longer original and unconditional. It results from a contract among individuals and amounts to a function or property of the State and the legal order, which can be attributed or re-attributed if necessary. It is no longer the quality of a person or group of people in particular. According to Hobbes, the supreme authority of Leviathan should enable the English people to escape civil war through a fictive social contract among individuals which can in turn secure peace in exchange for freedom. Secondly, as for Bodin, the sovereign and its laws are vested with absolute authority and as such there are no normative limits on the sovereign, not even by its own laws. Finally, however, and as for Bodin, the sovereign is limited by the laws of nature and in particular the individual right to protect one’s own life.\n\n20 Fifty years later, this quasi-absolute conception of State sovereignty was first questioned by John Locke.\n\n21 In Locke’s social contract theory, the authority of the sovereign no longer derives from a social contract among individuals, but from a contract between individuals and the sovereign that can therefore be held accountable for a violation of the contract and for the infringement of individual rights in particular. It is crucial, according to Locke, to establish strict limits to the power of the sovereign and to ensure a division of powers as well as constitutional control of the latter. As a result, Locke’s approach to sovereignty, by contrast to Bodin’s or Hobbes’, is the very first one that conceives of a limited sovereign but also of a legal sovereign that is a source of law but at the same time bound by its own laws.\n\n22 The final touch had now been made to the modern concept of sovereignty. The idea of limited sovereignty that finds its source in its own laws had appeared for the first time. True, the limited dimension of sovereignty had been propounded before, among some early modern philosophers writing in the early 17th century. This is the case for instance in the work of Hugo Grotius, Alberico Gentili, and Francisco Suarez, who defended the possibility, albeit limited, of disciplinary interventions by other sovereign States.\n\n23 One finds the idea of limited sovereignty again later in Jeremy Bentham’s model of constitutionalism. It was Jean-Jacques Rousseau, however, who a few years after Locke succeeded in reconciling the quasi-absolute and extremely resilient conception of sovereignty one finds in Hobbes with a more constitutional approach to its limits.\n\n24 Rousseau’s account of sovereignty does that by conceptualizing popular sovereignty and explaining how the exercise of the sovereignty of political institutions is submitted to the respect of the general will. Political sovereignty becomes a mere reflection of popular sovereignty; if the sovereign does not respect popular will, it risks losing its attributions. Seen in those terms, sovereignty can both be deemed absolute when it is original, and limited when it corresponds to derived political or institutional sovereignty. Sovereignty and democracy were clearly bound from then on.\n\n25 In the following centuries, conceptions of popular sovereignty and democracy dominated debates on the concept of sovereignty. They can be found, for instance, in the constitutionalist thought of the late 18th-century America and France where it is the people ruling through a body of law that is the subject of sovereignty.\n\n(b) From the 19th Century to the Early 20th Century: Matching Domestic Sovereignty with International Sovereignty\n\n26 If, for a long time, the internal sovereignty of the State on its territory and in its internal affairs lay at the heart of debates, the question of external sovereignty of the State in its international relations gradually moved centre stage during the 19th century.\n\n27 It is important to emphasize, however, that the notion of external sovereignty was not entirely absent from classical authors’ considerations. The emergence of modern sovereignty went hand in hand with claims to external independence and this concern may be retrieved, for instance, in Machiavelli, Bodin, or Hobbes’ writings.\n\n28 The emergence of the modern State was matched by the development of centralized political and legal orders which were territorially and personally determined and between which there were no links of subordination. In those circumstances, external sovereignty captured the relation of independence of sovereign States outside their national boundaries and their equal rights in mutual relations.\n\n29 It is only during the 19th century, however, that these concerns and claims were properly conceptualized qua prerogatives of external sovereignty both by political thinkers and by interstate practice. This coincided with the development of international law besides the domestic law of each sovereign State. Quickly, external and internal sovereignty became two necessary sides of the same coin. And this became clear both in domestic law where external powers were gradually regulated on top of the internal framework of national sovereignty, on the one hand, and in international law where external and, albeit to a lesser extent at first, internal aspects of sovereignty became objects of international rules and principles, on the other.\n\n30 If States were to remain ultimate authorities on the inside, they needed to be independent on the outside. Alongside conflicts of sovereignty among independent States, the necessity of developing international legal rules gradually emerged. In the absence of a global supreme power, sovereign States could only be held accountable to each other according to freely endorsed mutual promises. And the only way of ensuring the respect of these obligations was to impose international legal rules for mutual respect of sovereignty and of mutual promises among sovereign States. Without such legal rules, sovereignty would be reduced to mere factual power.\n\n31 It rapidly became clear that public international law and sovereignty implied each other. To be fully in charge of its relations with other States in a society of equally sovereign States and to be externally sovereign, and hence in turn to be able to protect its internal sovereignty, a State needed to be submitted to public international law. However, for public international law to arise, it needed independent sovereign States to freely consent to mutual rights and obligations and to their regulation. As a result, since sovereignty implies the existence of public international law, it became self-evident that sovereignty is inherently limited. Even if, by definition, a sovereign State cannot be limited by the laws of another State, it may be limited when these laws result from the collective will of all States.\n\n32 This gradual realization coincided with the development of classical international law from the early 19th century onwards and the Vienna Congress (1815) in particular. International law was deemed the law that enabled international coexistence between sovereign States; it covered all areas pertaining to the organization of States’ external sovereignty, ranging from border regulation to dispute settlement. It also protected internal sovereignty by prohibiting intervention in another sovereign State and guaranteeing immunity to one State before another’s authorities. The need for such a law of coexistence triggered the codification of international law in the second half of the 19th century and the creation of the first international organizations (‘IOs’) through which States organized their external relations more efficiently than on the basis of one-to-one relationships.\n\n33 Interestingly, while domestic sovereignty was already deemed an impersonal function, intrinsically limited and law-based in the modern conception used in 19th-century constitutional law, sovereignty was at first conceived as a personified State function, as self-limited at the most and as an actual source of law in the 19th-century classic international law paradigm.\n\n34 This differentiated regime of sovereignty, whether one looks at it from a domestic or international law perspective, can be explained both by the differences between those two faces of sovereignty and their inherent connection as two faces of the same coin. First of all, there was only one sovereign on the inside, but many and equal ones on the outside in the absence of a global and single sovereign. Even if sovereignty was limited in domestic law by reference to the original popular sovereign by that time, its legitimate sovereignty on the inside and equality on the outside meant that it had to be unbound on the outside except by self-limitation. Secondly, and this is as much a cause as a consequence, international law was conceived exclusively as a network of conventions and mutual promises whose source was State consent. Finally, classic international law dealt almost exclusively with external sovereignty.\n\n(b) From 1945 Onwards: Modernizing International Sovereignty\n\n42 The second part of the 20th century corresponded to the establishment of modern international law and of the new conception of international law qua law of cooperation between sovereign States.\n\n43 From that time onwards, international law has developed to allow sovereign States to cooperate and not only to coexist. As of 1945, IOs and institutions have proliferated at a regional level and more globally to organize and enhance those forms of cooperation. The creation of the UN in 1945 is an example, but one can also mention the EU’s predecessor entities: the three European Communities created in 1951 and 1957. European integration remains a unique example of post-national integration and political autonomy beyond the State.\n\n44 Gradually, and sensibly more so since the end of the Cold War (1947–91) and the 1990s, new subjects of international law have been recognized (by sovereign States): IOs, of course, but also, even though to a lesser extent, individuals and groups of individuals. Furthermore, with increased interdependence and cooperation among States, international law has gradually applied to areas that previously belonged to the domestic sphere. This is the case in the field of international economic law and international human rights, of course, but also, more recently, of international migration law or international environmental law. Finally, new forms of relative normativity have emerged in international law by which States can be bound through objective legal norms they have not consented to, or cannot derogate to imperative norms even if they want to (Ius Cogens).\n\n45 Those three phenomena, ie delegation of sovereign powers to IOs, international law’s internal subject matters and its relative normativity, have at first been interpreted as restrictions on both internal and external sovereignty. In an increasing number of cases, international law seems to be limiting States’ sovereignty without their consent; sovereignty is therefore limited but no longer only in a self-limiting fashion. Sovereignty is often said, as a result, to have been circumscribed and tamed or even relinquished in the second half of the century.\n\n46 Reading these developments as the end of or as a reduction of sovereignty amounts to a misconception, however. They are in line with modern sovereignty as it was conceived of in the domestic context since the late 18th century and are merely signs of its adaptation to new circumstances. Just as modern domestic sovereignty became an impersonal function of the State for the people, modern international sovereignty finally became a function distinct from the legal persona of the State. Moreover, just as modern domestic sovereignty emerged through a limitation of classic and early modern sovereignty, modern international sovereignty is a limited version of its classic correspondent. Further, just as modern domestic sovereignty is law-based, modern international sovereignty finds its sources in international law and not only the other way around. Finally, just as modern domestic sovereignty has an internal and an external dimension, modern international sovereignty is no longer only external, but it also has a growing internal dimension as international law regulates elements of internal State organization and competence. In short, modern international sovereignty is as important for the self-determination of democratic States in international law as ever, but to serve the same purpose its modalities have changed.\n\n47 To understand how this internationalization of modern sovereignty finally came about, it is useful to distinguish two key developments: the internationalization of popular sovereignty, and the development of sovereignty beyond the State.\n\n48 First of all, with the democratization of States and the correlative development of human rights protection within States in the second half of the 20th century, domestic sovereignty had gradually become more and more limited and found its source in a democratically legitimate legal order. Post-1945, international law was seen by modern democracies as a new way to secure their democratic development and, given the relationship between human rights and democracy, to entrench human rights protection from the outside through minimal international standards. This was captured by Hannah Arendt’s famous idea of a ‘right to have rights’, which was the only properly universal human right there could be as it was a right that only international law could guarantee.\n\n49 International sovereignty objectively limited in this way became, in other words, a direct way to secure domestic sovereignty in a legitimate fashion. As a result, modern State sovereignty now finds its source both in constitutional and international law—and this in turn explains the circumstances of constitutional and legal pluralism where distinct valid legal orders overlap. Seen differently, the sovereigns behind international law are peoples within States, and no longer States only. Importantly, however, international sovereignty protects a collective entity of individuals—a people—and not individual human beings per se. Of course, their fates are connected, in the same way democracy and human rights are correlated. But sovereignty, and sovereign equality, in particular, protects democratic autonomy in a State’s external affairs and remains justified for this separately from international human rights.\n\n50 This development explains, for instance, why it is wrong to oppose sovereignty to human rights in the second part of the 20th century; without sovereignty, many human rights-related developments, such as decolonization, would not have taken place and without the role human rights played in their creation, many of today’s sovereign States would not exist. Of course, this is not to say that sovereignty cannot be in tension with human rights. However, when it is, the tensions are reminiscent of those between popular sovereignty and human rights in the domestic context and ought actually to be resolved in the domestic context.\n\n51 Interestingly, many of those new international limitations to internal sovereignty are not consent-based, but stem from customary norms or general principles. This may be explained by the fact that these norms can be understood as the reflection of the minimal common denominator to the practice of all democratic sovereign States constituting the international community and are produced as a result by accretion of the gradual recognition of those norms at the domestic level by modern democracies. Once internationalized, those norms may as a result work as a legitimate limit on the autonomy of those States to contextualize and hence to flesh out those minimal international standards in their respective jurisdictions, thereby contributing to the development of the international standards themselves bottom-up.\n\n52 Of course, the internationalization of modern sovereignty goes hand in hand with the democratization of international law itself. If international law is allowed to regulate internal matters, its democratic legitimacy has to be guaranteed. As this is clearly not yet the case, even in a non-statist minimal model of democracy, the legitimacy of international law is still open to debate. And so is that of its role in the limitation and constitution of domestic sovereignty. As long as those questions have not received a satisfactory answer, the resilience of the Wimbledon self-limitation approach in certain parts of international law, as exemplified in the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua Case (Nicaragua v United States of America) (‘Nicaragua Case’; at para. 263) and arguably in the ICJ’s Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Respect of Kosovo (Advisory Opinion) (‘Kosovo Advisory Opinion’; at paras 56 and 123), should not come as a surprise.\n\n53 Secondly, material and economic interdependence between States has meant increased institutional cooperation at a transnational, international, and supranational level, and the creation of corresponding IOs. The delegation of sovereign competences to IOs is compatible with the sovereignty of Member States and does not turn IOs into sovereign States (see Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations [Advisory Opinion]).\n\n54 With time, however, increased integration in IOs has given rise to new channels of political decision-making that do not fit the intergovernmental framework of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century and hence also to new fora of human rights protection beyond the State. The EU is the paradigm example of such a supranational organization. One may find a confirmation in the gradual democratization of its decision-making processes and the recent transformation of its human rights framework into a municipal human rights body.\n\n55 Of course, such developments may potentially lead eventually to a new non-State sovereign or a new larger sovereign State depending on one’s conception of the State, and hence to a loss of sovereignty and accordingly of statehood on the part of Member States. Thus, treaties for confederations of States constitute a legitimate act of sovereignty, even though they may eventually terminate a specific State’s sovereignty by leading to a federal State. When conceived in modern terms qua democratic sovereignty, there is nothing in sovereignty that prevents it from being eventually abandoned in favour of a larger and different form of sovereignty if that new sovereign entity better protects the values and purposes of the people qua subject of sovereignty. But that is yet to be done, even in the EU.\n\n(a) Political/Legal Sovereignty\n\n60 Political and legal sovereignty have always been closely linked in the history of the concept; most theories either derive legal sovereignty from political sovereignty or vice-versa, while others see both dimensions as irreducibly connected. The paradox of pouvoir constituant and pouvoir constitué or of rule sovereignty and ruler sovereignty is inextricably tied to the modern claim to sovereignty. Different accounts have been given of the priority between political and legal sovereignty across the centuries and have contributed to perpetuating the centrality of the concept of sovereignty. Some authors have even argued that this paradox and mutual claim are testimony of the conceptual incoherence of sovereignty.\n\n61 While Austin and command theorists give priority to political sovereignty over legal sovereignty, Hart and later positivists have criticized that approach and give priority to legal sovereignty over political sovereignty. Other authors like Kelsen argue, on the contrary, that political and legal sovereignty are identical because the law subsumes the political and cannot therefore be put in any relationship of priority. More recently, some authors have tried to dissociate legal and political sovereignty and re-associate legal to institutional sovereignty.\n\n62 Political sovereignty is difficult to conceive without rules to exercise and constrain that sovereignty, but legal sovereignty is hard to fathom without a political power to establish its legal rules in the first place. Both are intrinsically connected as a result and cannot be set in any order of priority. The law remains a political instrument and creation, whether at the national, European, or international level. This is how it can be said to be legitimate. As a consequence, legal sovereignty ought to match some form of political sovereignty. Sovereignty amounts to the competence of a political entity. And this in turn explains the idea of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and the difficulty of establishing one’s own competences without legal sovereignty.\n\n63 It follows therefore that legal and political sovereignty, even though they are conceptually distinct and can exist separately in some cases, are not logically separable in the long run. This also implies that when they are both granted, neither of them can be given priority over the other. This does not, however, imply that they should be regarded as identical as on a Kelsenian model; they have a conceptually distinct nature and content. There is, in other words, an imperfect logical relationship between the two forms of sovereignty.\n\n64 Recently, the concept of de facto sovereignty has appeared in certain national decisions, indicating that sovereignty need not necessarily correspond to a legal status. While this approach served an internal constitutional purpose in those cases, one should be wary of disconnecting the political from the legal dimensions of sovereignty. It confuses the sheer exercise of power with sovereignty and brings back the vexed question of the relationship between the empirical and normative dimensions of sovereignty depicted before.\n\n65 At a time when law is no longer only State-based, as demonstrated by the emergence of the EU’s legal order, the development of lex mercatoria and other forms of transnational global law, legal and political sovereignty must somehow be able to be kept conceptually distinct from State sovereignty. International law itself is not State law (or only indirectly through State consent and even so not across the board) but is a source of State sovereignty, raising issues about the validity of its sources and their legitimacy. While it was acceptable for classical international law to be based on State consent and indirect State sovereignty, modern international law is no longer only about State self-limitation and is an actual source of State sovereignty. As a matter of fact, international law is not—or not yet, some would say—the law of a global State or political community but of many national and regional polities. As such, the question of the relationship between legal sovereignty and political sovereignty is important in international law even outside the issue of the relationship between law and State.\n\n66 Sovereignty should be situated at the boundary between politics and law, rather than being clearly embedded in one or the other. This interpretation of the relationship between political and legal sovereignty solves a long-standing paradox in international law or at least makes the most of it.\n\n67 This tension is clearly at play in the context of popular sovereignty. As explained previously, the notion of popular sovereignty goes back to Rousseau’s dissociation of the original sovereignty of the demos from that of political institutions and to modern constitutionalism. Through the constitution, the people constitutes itself as a distinct entity and sovereign while also transferring the exercise of its sovereignty to a constituted institutional sovereign. Thus, political and popular sovereignty are reunited, and then artificially separated through law in order to bind the sovereign to the people, thus delineating the sovereign and the people at the same time. In a democratic context, therefore, sovereignty is both law-based and the source of law.\n\n68 When transposed to modern international law, popular sovereignty and its legal disconnection from the State or set of institutions exercising it explains how international law can be a source of State sovereignty, or more generally of political sovereignty in a larger political grouping of States, without itself being State law or the law of that larger polity. International law now contributes with domestic law to the shaping of internal sovereignty and internal competences as the law of a given people in a multi-level polity.\n\n(b) Internal/External Sovereignty\n\n69 Traditionally, the concept of sovereignty has always operated in two distinct manners: sovereignty can be exercised in relation to one’s internal affairs, on the one hand, but also to one’s external affairs, on the other. The former is usually referred to as internal sovereignty and the latter as external sovereignty.\n\n70 The distinction between internal and external sovereignty should not be conflated with that between domestic and international sovereignty. The latter distinction refers to the legal order and perspective that is the source of sovereignty. Domestic sovereignty is both internal and external as domestic law regulates both the State’s internal affairs and its external relations, and the same can be said of international sovereignty after 1945. International internal sovereignty refers to the international rights and duties of a State that pertain to its ultimate authority and competence over all people and all things within its territory, and in particular to the correlated principles of territorial and personal jurisdiction and integrity, and of non-intervention. International external sovereignty pertains to the international equal rights and duties of a State in its relations to other States, and in particular to its original legal personality and the correlated principle of State and state agents’ immunity.\n\n71 Even though there exists a historical and conceptual link between these two forms of sovereignty, as discussed above, it is important to distinguish between them in practice.\n\n72 First of all, and although this may be contested from a democratic legitimacy perspective, different institutions exercise sovereignty in both cases: the executive acts as a sovereign in external affairs, while it is usually the legislative which is regarded as sovereign in internal affairs. Hence the difficulty there can be in distinguishing between parliamentary sovereignty on the inside and State sovereignty on the outside. Secondly, their functions differ; whereas internal sovereignty pertains to all political and legal matters, external sovereignty usually only relates to questions of coexistence and/or cooperation among distinct sovereign entities. Finally, external sovereignty can less easily be described as final or ultimate as it is necessarily equal; it can only be equally ultimate since a sovereign can only coexist as an equal to other sovereigns. In internal affairs, however, sovereignty is usually final.\n\n73 Consequently, some authors argue that both forms of sovereignty can be kept distinct. Although they may be, conceptually at least, they cannot be separated logically; for there to be external sovereignty, there must be internal sovereignty and vice-versa. Without external sovereignty and the delimitation from other sovereigns, the internal sovereign cannot define its own competences and exercise authority, and without internal sovereignty in the determination of competences and the exercise of authority, there cannot be an external sovereign that can relate to other sovereigns. It is difficult therefore to place one before the other in a logical order of development. The only exception one may mention is the internal sovereignty of protectorates that is not (yet) matched by external sovereignty (Protectorates and Protected States).\n\n(c) Absolute/Limited Sovereignty\n\n74 The question of the degree of power and amount of competence necessary for an entity to become or remain sovereign has given rise to a long controversy in the history of the concept.\n\n75 According to some authors, sovereignty can only be absolute; this is the classical conception of sovereignty one finds in Bodin and Hobbes in particular. The modern conception of sovereignty understands it, however, as inherently limited through domestic law, but also, since the second half of the 20th century, through international law and this even without the consent of the sovereign State and hence beyond self-limitation. Whereas classic international law saw sovereignty as self-limited at the most, modern international law binds sovereign States in their internal and external dimensions, often without their consent.\n\n76 This is most particularly the case of external sovereignty which, as presented before, cannot be regarded as ultimate or final; it is inherently limited since public international law and external sovereignty imply each other. It is important to realize, however, that these inherent limitations to external sovereignty have also become constitutive limitations to internal sovereignty in modern international law. Besides domestic constitutional limitations and transnational human rights guarantees, more and more constitutional orders have become so intertwined that much of their laws and decision-making competences overlap and their internal sovereignty has been affected, as is the case in the EU in particular.\n\n77 In response to this difficulty, some authors have suggested the idea of limited sovereignty. The problem then is to know when sovereignty is so limited or fragmented that there can no longer be any talk of sovereignty. The concept of sovereignty implies a certain amount of intensity or of competence over a certain range of matters. As presented before, legal sovereignty is a general competence, ie a competence to determine one’s particular competence; as such, it requires a minimal level of control over those competences. In other words, is there a threshold below which sovereignty is emptied of any content and if so, where does that threshold lie?\n\n78 Some authors have denied this identification of sovereignty with a threshold-concept. One argument against it may reside in the contestation of sovereignty and hence of this minimal threshold. The essentially contestable nature of the concept of sovereignty is an analytical statement, however, which is perfectly compatible with the recognition of the normative content of the concept and of its contestability. One might even consider that these minimal threshold constraints are part of the analytical framework one has to assume when using a contestable concept, ie that it is a concept, that it encompasses values, that it is contestable, etc. It remains difficult, however, to establish where the minimal threshold of sovereignty lies. Another argument against this all-or-nothing approach to the concept of sovereignty resides in the increasing number of cases of States where there is a foreign military or civil presence that is reminiscent of mandates or protectorates but where sovereignty has been re-transferred to the State. In those contexts, gradations of sovereignty have been suggested along the lines of bundles of sovereign rights. None of these categories have been recognized by international law, however.\n\n79 When turning to the minimal content of the sovereignty threshold, some authors merely agree with the idea of a threshold without providing more information. Others enumerate different competences which might constitute a minimal threshold of authority and be used to identify a sovereign entity. They mention territorial supremacy, control over nationality acquisition, immigration control, or national security. Generally, the problem is the absence of consensus and the constant change in the paradigmatic constitutive elements of sovereignty. The content of the threshold cannot but remain contestable and different paradigms have been used at different times in the history of the concept of sovereignty; it suffices to look at paradigms like immigration control or monetary policy to see that they have gradually given way to new ones, in the EU in particular, and hence to new thresholds of sovereignty.\n\n80 In short, it is one of the characteristics of sovereignty to be a threshold-concept, whose threshold itself is contestable. Sovereignty is not a matter of degree, as a result. Of course, it can be lost as in failed States or gained as in a newly independent State (see the Kosovo Advisory Opinion regarding the rupture between the transitional constitutional order established by UNSC Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999 [SCOR 54th Year 32] and the independent State’s sovereign order; Failing States; New States and International Law), but in each case it is either all at once or not at all.\n\n(d) Unitary/Divided Sovereignty\n\n81 Another classical and related distinction pertains to the divisibility of sovereignty. The issue whether sovereignty can be divided is as controversial as that of whether it can be limited. In fact, both issues are very closely connected and often conflated. Older and recent literature refer to absolute sovereignty to mean unlimited sovereignty as much as undivided sovereignty. For the sake of clarity, I will refer to absolute sovereignty by contrast to limited sovereignty only, although divided sovereignty can obviously no longer be deemed absolute either.\n\n82 Authors like Bodin or Hobbes feared the division of sovereignty as much as its limitation. In a post-Westphalian world where competences are not only transferred, but also concurrent or shared, however, such fears have become obsolete; the division of competences has indeed become the rule in the EU and beyond. This applies in almost all domains and at all degrees of authority. The division of sovereignty can be vertical or horizontal, depending on whether it takes place among distinct political entities such as two States or between a State and the EU, or whether it takes place within a single political entity according to territorial or other federal divisions or according to distinct political functions. In the EU, the division of sovereignty goes along both vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n83 The increasing division of sovereignty has been made possible by the shift in the subject of sovereignty post-1945: peoples have become the subjects of modern international sovereignty. Those peoples organize and constrain their sovereignty through the international and the domestic legal orders at once. In other words, modern State sovereignty finds its source both in constitutional and international law; the same subject is sovereign and autonomous under international law and domestic law at the same time. This very plurality of sources of law and sovereignty in the new world order is often referred to as constitutional pluralism, ie the coexistence of overlapping autonomous constitutional orders in the same political and legal community and territory. In this context, the principle of subsidiarity becomes a principle of effective democratic sovereignty and a way to allocate decision-making power in a multi-level polity. It provides a test of efficiency in the allocation of sovereignty and may be regarded as part of the correct application of the concept of sovereignty when it is divided.\n\n84 As in the case of limited sovereignty, divided sovereignty cannot be entirely fragmented through division without risk. There must be a limit to the amount of division of competences there can be. This is something proponents of divided, shared, or pooled sovereignty do not foresee. In response to the limits of the unitary approach of sovereignty, the idea of disaggregation and re-aggregation of sovereignty around a bundle of rights has indeed been brought forward by some to grasp the poly-centred dimension of contemporary sovereignty. The problem with this kind of model of pooled or shared sovereignty, however, is that by being everywhere, it seems that sovereignty is nowhere. It is important, therefore, to account for a minimal threshold of competences which may neither be limited nor shared, along the lines of the model discussed previously.\n\n(a) The Legitimate Authority of International Law\n\n95 If international sovereignty is both international law-based and a source of valid international law, it is pivotal to the legitimacy, ie legitimate authority of international law. International law’s authority is justified or legitimate if it has the right to rule and create duties to obey on the part of its subjects.\n\n96 Interestingly, one of the main challenges to the legitimacy of international law is that it allegedly fails to respect the sovereignty of States, intruding upon domains in which they should be free to make their own decisions. Sovereign States are the primary subjects to binding international norms. State sovereignty is often understood in international law as a competence, immunity, or power, and in particular as the power to make autonomous choices (so-called sovereign autonomy). And most duties stemming from international legal norms directly constrain the action of States. The legitimate authority of international law is as a result often opposed to State sovereignty the way the legitimate authority of domestic law is opposed to individual autonomy.\n\n97 Following the analogy between States and individuals entering private contracts discussed before, sovereign States are generally held as being able to bind themselves as free rational agents. For a long time, this was actually the only way in which the legitimate authority of international law over sovereign States could be justified. The paradox or dilemma of sovereignty implies indeed that States must be capable of binding themselves if international law is to exist, and also incapable of binding themselves through international law if they are to be absolutely independent. Among the different ways out of the paradox, self-limitation was deemed the least unobjectionable. This is explained by reference to the idea of normative immediacy, famously captured by the ICJ in the Wimbledon case (at 25), according to which those States that are immediately bound by law and vice-versa are sovereign and legal persons (see also Reparation for Injuries Suffered in the Service of the United Nations [Advisory Opinion]).\n\n98 This approach is misleading in modern international law, however. To start with consent does not provide a sound justification for the authority of law tout court and even less for that of international law due to inequalities between States. Moreover, many international law norms can no longer be drawn back to State consent in their law-making process anyway. Finally, they can actually bind other international subjects than States consenting to them and a consent-based justification would leave a large part of international law unaccounted for.\n\n99 There is another more promising way to justify the authority of international law on sovereign States, but also on their populations and on IOs that is in line with the modern account of sovereign autonomy proposed so far.\n\n100 First of all, a few clarifications pertaining to the justification of authority are in order, however. According to the service conception of authority, authority can only be justified if it facilitates its subjects’ conformity with the (objective) reasons that already apply to them and hence respects their autonomy.\n\n101 The application of the service conception has a pre-requisite therefore: the subject bound by a legal norm needs to be an autonomous subject, as it is only so that its freedom to choose from a range of options can be furthered by an authoritative directive. Autonomy, in other words, does not mean freedom from duties, but only from those that do not correspond to objective reasons that apply to the autonomous subject and do not help the subject to respect those reasons. A subject is autonomous if his freedom is complete for the purposes of leading a good life.\n\n102 The analogy between authority for States or other institutional subjects of international sovereignty, on the one hand, and individuals, on the other, presupposes therefore that the value of autonomy extends to the choices and actions of States. At first sight, it seems plausible that it does, given the value of shared membership in a national political community and, as a result, of the collective self-determination of such communities. The problem is that the value of State autonomy can only be explained in terms of the autonomy of the people constituting it. States are quite unlike individuals when it comes to the value of their autonomy. Their autonomy cannot simply be equated with that of any of their domestic legal subjects, but is the product of those subjects’ autonomy as a political entity. By analogy with an individual but also because of the imperfect analogy with an individual in the service of which sovereignty actually lies, sovereign autonomy is even more clearly dependent on the purposes of being a good polity.\n\n103 When a State is morally bound by a norm of international law, the duties imposed on it will require action that burdens individuals either indirectly, through international State action that is costly to national resources, or directly through the duty to enact domestic laws in order to transpose international law into domestic law or implement the latter directly in the domestic sphere. This affects individuals’ balance of reasons as a result and explains why the autonomy of a State and its ability to be bound depends on its constituency’s autonomy and hence on its ability to represent the latter. As a result, States can only be bound by international legal norms when they represent those subjects as officials and hence can bind them as proxy subjects to international law. This approach also has the advantage of providing a single legitimacy concept applicable to all sources of international law and to all subjects of international law duties whether States, IOs, or individuals as all of them are reducible eventually to individuals.\n\n104 Of course, States remain free rational albeit artificial agents and as such they can enter into binding agreements the way an individual would enter a contract. This can be the case for many contract-like treaties and other international agreements, although consent does not necessarily bind in all cases. The opposite view would simply strip States of their right to bind themselves and hence from any of the meaningful implications of their quality as primary international legal subjects. Further, States’ international legal obligations to obey would remain in place even if they were illegitimate, as they are often backed-up by legal sanctions. And so would States’ moral obligations to abide by morally correct directives which would bind individuals (and States for them collectively) in any case. But populations unrepresented by those States would not be morally bound by those legal directives qua legitimate law. Nor could those States be accordingly.\n\n105 Secondly, for the authority of international law to be actually justified and hence legitimate, the reasons international law provides ought not only to match pre-existing reasons of sovereign States, ie the reasons that make them good States. They ought also to be able to preclude those reasons by helping the subject to respect them better than on his own. The justifications for their exclusionary quality can be numerous and range from cognitive or volitive qualities to coordination abilities.\n\n106 In the circumstances of reasonable disagreement and social and cultural pluralism that prevail globally and even more severely among States, coordination provides one of the best justifications for the legitimate authority of international law, even outside clear coordination problems. More particularly, democratic coordination constitutes the justification to the legitimacy of international law that is most respectful of individuals’ and peoples’ political equality and hence of the reasons that apply to sovereign States. What democracy requires in international law-making and between sovereign States will be addressed below.\n\n(b) Legitimate Authority and Sovereign Independence\n\n107 Interestingly, even when the conditions for the legitimate authority of international law over sovereign States are fulfilled, there could still be some matters over which it is more important for a sovereign to be able to decide independently. This is by analogy to what applies to individuals: it is important that, in some cases at least, a person reaches and acts on her own decision, rather than take a putative authority’s directives as binding, even if doing the latter would result in decisions that, in other respects, better conform to reason.\n\n108 In general, it is difficult, however, to distinguish those cases from cases where legitimate authority can apply, the incompatibility being at the most contingent and relative to certain circumstances. The contingency of the independence condition is even more clearly the case in international law. If States are deemed as officials both qua law-makers and qua proxy-subjects of authority in the international legal order, their independence cannot simply be equated with that of any of their domestic legal subjects. It is the product of those subjects’ autonomy as a political entity and the value of that autonomy which itself depends on that of the individuals of which it is constituted.\n\n109 As indicated before, considered in both its internal and external dimensions, a State’s sovereign autonomy is a legal construct, not something whose value is to be assumed as a first principle of normative analysis. In its internal dimension, the State works as a legal organization—it is the outcome of organizing certain rules of public life in a particular way. Its sovereignty is artificial and it is legally constructed for the benefit of those whose internal interests it protects. In its external dimension, the sovereignty and the sovereign autonomy of the individual State are equally artefacts of law. There can be no domestic or international legal order without sovereign States, but equally there can be no sovereign States without domestic and international law. What a State’s sovereignty is and what it amounts to is not given as a matter of the intrinsic value of its individuality, but determined by the rules of the international legal order. Those rules define State sovereignty so as to protect the internal and external interests and values of the political community qua sovereign equal to others, but also to protect the interests of their subjects.\n\n110 If this is correct, the potential cases of incompatibility between the legitimate authority of international law and State sovereignty are likely to be even more contingent in the international legal order than in the domestic context. At the same time, however, sovereign States are collective entities and as such their relationships are likely to be even more riddled with disagreement than individuals. Moreover, one of the values of sovereignty being self-determination, it is clear that decisional independence is of value in the case of sovereign States as well. Finally, given the circumstances of social and cultural pluralism that prevail globally, it is likely that State autonomy can be exercised valuably in very different manners. All this makes self-determination over certain matters as important in the case of sovereign States as for individuals, albeit for different reasons. This is clearly the case for constitutive standards in a democracy such as human rights and democracy itself. And this in turn explains why those international standards are minimal and have to be contextualized within each sovereign State.\n\n111 In sum, State sovereignty is not necessarily compatible with the authority of international law. It is only the case when the latter has legitimate authority, ie furthers State autonomy and the reasons that underlie State autonomy. Those can be understood by reference to the values that make a good State or more generally a good political entity such as self-determination, democracy, and human rights, but also the values that make a good international community of equal sovereign entities. Of course, this should not be taken to mean that State sovereignty is only incompatible with international law’s authority when it is illegitimate. There may be cases where autonomy requires legitimate authority, but others where self-direction is valuable despite the prima facie justification of international law’s authority. Too much international regulation would empty sovereign autonomy from its purpose.\n\n112 In short, it would be wrong to explain sovereignty by reference to the legitimacy of international law, but also conversely the legitimacy of international law by reference to sovereignty. It is by reference to the values they both serve that the authority of international law can be justified in some cases, and hence the prima facie restrictions to State autonomy this implies."
