        "text": "To be true to its name, biblical criticism must be critical, not just of the Bible’s historicity, etc., but also of its theological assertions (its philosophy). An iconic text like Genesis 1 cries out for a critical response, among which the following topics emerge. (1) God saw it was good. So he looks on outward appearances? Is not tôb an aesthetic judgment, i.e. beautiful, perhaps merely pretty? (2) Sustainability. Does the creation remain ‘good’? Is the world not what was designed, or is what we have as good as it gets? (3) God’s ‘work’. What actual ‘work’ was done in Genesis 1? Mostly it was a matter of issuing commands. Is not the God of Genesis 1 a pharaonic ruler? (4) Humanity as the image of God. An aberrant idea, from the point of view of the Hebrew Bible generally. (5) Humans as the pinnacle of creation. Why should creation be thought as having a pinnacle? Are humans perhaps the nadir of creation? (6) Human dominion over the animals. Apart from half a dozen animals that humans use, is this not unrealistic? Fish and birds are mostly beyond human reach, and wild animals more likely to exercise dominion over humans than vice versa. (7) Be fruitful. In a world already suffering from overpopulation this command is a curse, or at least more than thoroughly fulfilled. (8) Male and female. Is sexuality exclusively for the purpose of reproduction? (9) The almost sabbath. Despite strong hints, this is not really a sabbath, since it is observed by the deity, not humans, and it is not repeated. (10) The seventh day the climax of creation? Can lack of activity be the climax of creation? (11) Separation, differentiation, order. The principle of order is fundamental in Genesis 1, but it is a value regarded ambivalently in the modern world, with overtones of authoritarianism, oppression. (12) The missing dimension. Genesis 1 is austere, spare, grand, but lacks empathy, emotion, at least by comparison with Psalm 104, its most important intertext."
