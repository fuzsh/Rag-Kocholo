        "text": "In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth studio album, The King of Limbs. Though it was generally well reviewed at the time, the album has since been singularly divisive among fans. Judged by many to be the weak link in the band’s discography, The King of Limbs is often placed second last in fan rankings, surpassing only the band’s debut, 1993’s Pablo Honey, which is generally thought to be their poorest effort.\n\nThe backlash started early. Many fans thought that the album’s comparatively small offering of only eight tracks meant that this was only the first half of a larger project. Theories abounded of a mysterious ‘King of Limbs Part 2’, seemingly alluded to in the band’s cryptic posts surrounding the release, and possibly even hinted at in the lyrics of the suggestively titled final track ‘Separator’: ‘If you think this is over, then you’re wrong.’ But these theories were only wishful thinking, and as the months went on, hopes of a ‘part 2’ diminished. Though Radiohead did release some further tracks from The King of Limbs sessions over the ensuing months, including the much-loved deep cuts The Daily Mail, Supercollider and The Butcher, The King of Limbs remained the final product of Radiohead’s early 2010s era — a standalone album consisting of eight tracks, a mere 37 minutes in length. And people did not quite know what to make of it. Pitchfork summed up this sentiment in their review of the record, writing: “A trawl through message boards and social networks leaves the impression that many disappointed fans are still struggling to make sense of the gap between the greatness of the thing they got and the genius of the thing they thought they might get,” concluding that with The King of Limbs, Radiohead were treading “well-worn terrain” and “the band’s signature game-changing ambition is missed.”\n\nTo this day, this assessment seems to be the accepted consensus on Limbs. That the band did little new or ground-breaking in this record. That it is too short. That it is good, great even, but deeply flawed. Other generally accepted narratives have spread throughout the fanbase: that Limbs is too reliant on rhythm at the expense of melody. That the first half is weaker than the second. That the eventual live versions of these songs put the studio versions to shame. Articles written about the album for its tenth anniversary perpetuated these ideas: despite calling the album a “mysterious, striving and reinvigorating effort,” Consequence of Sound concluded that “few fans would name The King of Limbs as their favourite Radiohead collection,” arguing that the albums preceding and succeeding it were superior. Stereogum, meanwhile, called Limbs a “meagre, wilfully difficult collection of songs,” that were “frigid and elusive” and “too muted to be described as bangers.” The writer also called the album “largely backloaded” and felt that its tracks were “flimsy compared to their live counterparts.”\n\nI want to challenge this consensus. A handful of others have recently tried to reclaim Limbs as an important record, most notably Brooklyn Vegan’s excellent anniversary piece on the record, which argued quite rightly that Limbs was like Kid A in that it followed a milestone album with a drastic left-turn. It also importantly drew attention to how Limbs “embraced a gorgeous yet experimental style of underground music” — from Burial to Four Tet, from Mount Kimbie to Flying Lotus, “putting this music in the hands of thousands of people who may go their entire lives without hearing a band like Mount Kimbie”. Yet even this defence of the unique musical qualities of Limbs only goes so far in re-evaluating the importance of the album. To this day, I feel like most commentaries on Limbs seem to overlook what I think is the essence of the record, its fundamental message and its musical importance. I want to argue in this essay that The King of Limbs is not only one of Radiohead’s best albums, but that I’d go so far as to call it a misunderstood masterpiece, deserving of as much love and praise as any other.\n\nBut to do that, it is necessary first to go back to the beginning of the story of Limbs and namely to the album that preceded it. 2007’s In Rainbows is widely believed to be not only one of Radiohead’s very best albums, alongside 1997’s OK Computer and 2000’s Kid A, but one of the greatest albums of all time. It introduced swathes of new listeners to Radiohead, being the band’s most relatable, warm and human album with immediate, immaculate melodies, universal themes and compelling diversity across its ten tracks. Alongside its game-changing digital release model, In Rainbows also seemed to mark the beginning of a new, mature era for Radiohead, confirming their ground-breaking status once more after a period in the early 2000s and particularly following 2003’s Hail to the Thief during which the band themselves were unsure whether to stay together, or whether their music continued to have relevance. In short, In Rainbows cemented Radiohead’s status as one of the most popular bands on the planet, and one of the most critically revered bands of all time. It also marked the band’s first release after parting ways with their record label EMI, proving their ability to make music on their own terms while simultaneously upturning the industry model that had for so long dictated commercial success and inhibited their creative autonomy.\n\nHow would the band follow up the enormous success of In Rainbows? Fans were given a taste of a potential answer to this question in July 2009 when Radiohead dropped a one-off track — the knotty, unconventional These are my Twisted Words, perhaps leaked early by the band themselves. This serpentine composition looked ahead to The King of Limbs’ fascination with rhythm, its spare variations upon root chords later revisited in songs like Morning Mr Magpie and Little by Little. Meanwhile, its artwork and imagery turned emphatically away from the astral sphere of In Rainbows, diving deep into the earth itself, into the tangled roots of trees and the mysteries of the natural world. All in all, the release signalled a move into the unknown, suggesting how far the band were keen to push themselves into uncharted territory, using their newfound independence to move forwards with little to no consideration of their music’s commercial value or of mainstream expectations.\n\nIntriguingly, the torrent of the leaked file for These are my Twisted Words included a document with artwork, information and some mysterious lyrics. These included the phrase ‘behind a wall of ice’, which was seemingly referenced in the track’s file name itself, this ending with the letters ‘woi’. Of course, fans interpreted these clues as foreshadowing a future release under the name ‘Wall of Ice’. In an official post announcing These are my Twisted Words, Jonny Greenwood mentioned that the band had been ‘recording for a while’ and that the track was one of the first completed. He added that there was ‘other stuff in various states of completion,’ further fuelling the rumour mill about a forthcoming album. But nothing came and silence ensued. No one knows what happened to the mysterious ‘wall of ice’ project, except that it likely evolved into The King of Limbs.\n\nIn February 2010, at a Thom Yorke solo show in Cambridge that I was lucky enough to attend, Yorke played acoustic versions of tracks that would appear on The King of Limbs, including a rendition of ‘Lotus Flower’ and debut performances of ‘Give up the Ghost’ and ‘Separator’, the latter of which was then called ‘Mousedogbird’. I remember how breath-taking ‘Give up the Ghost’ was when I first heard it, and it fast became the Radiohead song that I was most anticipating for the next album. The appearance of new songs, a mysterious recording project and the sense that something was imminent only further fuelled the hype for the album that would follow In Rainbows.\n\nIt wasn’t until a year later however, on Valentine’s Day 2011, that a mysterious page appeared on the Radiohead website. Acknowledging the weight of fan expectation, it simply read ‘Thank You For Waiting’. Clicking on this phrase took you through to a page announcing Radiohead’s new album, ‘The King of Limbs’, which would be released on the 18th February. On the 18th, Radiohead dropped the video for lead single ‘Lotus Flower’, which went viral and spawned endless Thom Yorke dancing memes that would entertain fans for years to come. That same day, the album appeared.\n\nI remember doing something I would normally disapprove of: I listened to the album out of sequence, playing Give up the Ghost before the other songs. It sounded different to the early versions; the rhythm had changed slightly, the looping vocals were quieter than I expected, the lead vocal reverb was loud and heavy. I wasn’t sure what to make of it.\n\nThen I listened through to the album in full. Bloom hardly felt like a complete song to me when I first heard it; it was so otherworldly, so strange. I couldn’t really find my feet with it. Morning Mr Magpie was even more difficult. It seemed so bare, and the skittering drum beats felt relentless and distracting. I liked Little by Little more, though to me it sounded a little too close to other Radiohead songs that like to play around with D major and minor chord phrasings such as Optimistic and I Might be Wrong. Feral seemed like a waste of time on what was already a short album; one of those less successful Radiohead sound experiments that I could not warm to at all. The second half of the album felt like a relief when I hit Lotus Flower, which I already knew and loved. Codex, too, felt like a return to the humanity and directness of In Rainbows-era songwriting. Finally, Separator was a breath of fresh air, especially when the guitars appeared halfway through.\n\nAnd so there it was. The new Radiohead album. Like many others, I was left scratching my head wondering if that was it, or if there really was a ‘King of Limbs Part 2’ around the corner. It hardly seemed right that this batch of eight tracks was the finished result of Radiohead’s next album cycle. It seemed too small an offering, and strangely unsatisfying at that. Only three or four of the tracks felt like the Radiohead I knew and loved.\n\nI spent the next few weeks and months trawling fan message boards hoping for more clues, and ultimately hoping for more music, alongside countless other fans whose disappointment became more pronounced as time wore on. And in the meantime, I was listening to The King of Limbs a lot, waiting for it to click. I know that some records take a while to reveal themselves, but this one was weirdly impenetrable, especially the first half of the album. Some tracks grew a lot, including Bloom and Separator. But others felt too alien; this simply wasn’t the Radiohead I had wanted.\n\nThen, slowly, things started to change. Maybe it was when I started reading the lyrics closely, or when I started to teach the songs to myself on guitar and piano, diving deep into their structures and learning them from the inside out. Maybe it was getting the copy of the free newspaper Radiohead gave out in the streets of London in March 2011 to celebrate the release of the album’s physical edition. This was called ‘The Universal Sigh’ and it was full of lyrics, artwork and short stories that together began to paint a picture of the album’s visual and thematic world. This understanding was only compounded by the release of the special ‘newspaper album’ edition of The King of Limbs in May that year, which again featured pages of artwork, photographs and lyrics. I remember sticking the individual pages of this ‘newspaper album’ up on my bedroom walls, immersing myself in the images and words that the band had themselves been lost in during the process of creating The King of Limbs. And slowly but surely, the album revealed itself to me.\n\nI now rank The King of Limbs as my favourite Radiohead album — no mean feat considering the greatness of In Rainbows and Kid A, as well as most of their other studio releases. But there was something special about Limbs. It felt like its own sonic universe; it sounded like nothing else, and it still doesn’t. Its attention to detail was staggering; its many layers kept peeling back to reveal new depths. It was deeply uncompromising, but it continually rewarded my attention, investment and immersion. It still does to this day.\n\nBut more than anything else, I started to notice how perfectly Limbs matches its musical form to its overarching concept. These songs are not a mere collection of unrelated compositions; they tell a thematic story in how they’re sequenced, and they work narratively from start to finish. In its own fashion, I believe that The King of Limbs is a ‘concept album’, consisting of a thematic narrative which I intend to spell out in detail.\n\nFirst, however, it is important to discuss the band’s conception of the record as a whole. Statements from the band themselves about Limbs are few and far between. Indeed, part of the strangeness of The King of Limbs was how little the band did to promote it when it first came out: almost no interviews, no press junkets, no shows for over a year after the record was released (not least due to the fact that these songs were so difficult to translate to a live context). This only added to the strange impenetrability of its content.\n\nHowever, we do have some statements to examine. Perhaps one of the most revealing came from long-time Radiohead collaborator and artist Stanley Donwood, whose striking artworks have graced the covers of the band’s releases ever since the release of their second studio album, The Bends. “[In Rainbows] was this big, heavy, substantial thing,” he said in May 2011. “It was very much a definitive statement, and that isn’t where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory… And similarly, this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And we wanted to make the album representative of that.” Donwood explained how the ‘newspaper album’ concept reflected this ephemeral theme that Limbs embodies. In many ways, Donwood’s words reveal just how much Limbs functions as a response to In Rainbows, which had been the result of a notoriously painstaking and difficult recording process that had almost killed them, according to Thom Yorke. It seems that with Limbs, they wanted to remove the pressure of creating something ‘definitive’ and let things flow more organically. Ed O’Brien described how the band felt “exhausted and uninspired” after In Rainbows, and so Limbs necessarily had to be a breath of release — a universal sigh, as it were. Limbs is the essence of this newly free-spirited, transient incarnation of the band.\n\nPerhaps this is also why Thom Yorke later described how it felt “amazing to just put the record out like that,” with no fanfare or media campaign, but he added that as a consequence, “it didn’t feel like it really existed.” This was the strange bind that the band got themselves into with Limbs: their release strategy was effectively an anti-release strategy and in many ways the album itself was anti-definitive: the antithesis of the landmark or statement album that In Rainbows represented. In many ways, the band set up the record to fail because the album campaign reflected this ephemeral intention of the album itself. This was, in part, why the album remained so inscrutable to many fans; with little explanation, fanfare or media hype, the band refused to give anyone an easy way into the record. “”I can see why it’s alienated people,” Yorke reflected in 2012. “I didn’t realise it was its own planet.” Indeed, audiences simply couldn’t expect The King of Limbs to come to them, they had to discover it themselves; they had to set foot on that unfamiliar planet and take the time to explore. As one review in Paste magazine put it, “The King of Limbs demands some deep immersion for comprehension, just as a traveller from a foreign land must lose himself in the culture to understand where they are.” This is what I feel like when I listen to Limbs: like I’m actually entering into some far-off, insular, sonic universe and marvelling at every strange detail that catches my attention or ducks in and out of sight. I also think this is part of the work’s magic. Once you find your way in, the album manages to be one of the band’s most truly immersive experiences — every song its own strange, alien landscape to revisit and get lost in.\n\nOf the process itself, the band referred in several instances to the fascination with programming and sampling that defined the unique sounds and textures on the record. Ed O’Brien famously stated that “rhythm is the king of limbs,” while Jonny Greenwood remembered that they “didn’t want to pick up guitars and write chord sequences…” and “didn’t want to sit in front of a computer either.” “We wanted a third thing,” he said, “which involved playing and programming.” Producer Nigel Goodrich was more direct: “I was like, ‘Okay, let’s do an experiment for two weeks where everyone has a turntable instead of playing the guitar or drums or whatever.’,” he remembered, “And that two-week experiment ended up being fucking six months. And that’s that record, the whole story of all of it.”\n\nThe truth of The King of Limbs is that the record was composed and recorded in fits and starts from May 2009 to January 2011, and that the turntable experimentation and vinyl emulation software the band used to loop samples of themselves playing was only one part of a much more thought-out process about what the record would be. Godrich embellished his account in 2020, explaining that the record was “made up of everyone throwing pieces of audio together” and that “the result was a huge and gigantic mess that took me about a year and a half to unravel, and then Thom wrote over the top.” Of course, we know that a handful of the songs on Limbs were written on acoustic guitar, with ‘Lotus Flower’ dating back to as early as 2009, when Yorke debuted the song at Latitude Festival, and ‘Give up the Ghost’ and Separator probably dating to a similar time. Codex seems to be another clear example of ‘classic’ songwriting that emerged largely fully formed prior to any studio manipulations or processes.\n\nWhat results is a clear divide that took shape as the two distinct halves of Limbs: Side A consists of the songs that seem to have arisen out of the band’s controlled collective chaos, where songs were written more collaboratively in concert with the ideas forming in the studio, whereas Side B brings together a collection of pre-written Yorke compositions that then underwent their typical studio embellishments. Ed O’Brien’s description of the writing of Bloom appears to be indicative of the band’s approach to these Side A tracks, where Thom “wrote over the top” of musical ideas: “The brick walls we tended to hit were when we knew something was great, like ‘Bloom’, but not finished,” he said. “|Then [Colin Greenwood] had that bassline, and Thom started singing. Those things suddenly made it a hundred times better.” Similarly, even though Morning Mr Magpie had existed as a Neil Young-esque acoustic song since the Hail to the Thief sessions, the version of it on Limbs is so unrecognisable that it is clear that Thom adapted the vocal melody of a pre-existing song to the newly devised studio experimentations of the band’s collective work.\n\nPerhaps this is why so many find Side A of Limbs so thoroughly alienating. It was clearly written using a very different approach to that which Radiohead were most comfortable with. Side A showcased the more radical side of the band rearing its head, trying something completely new. Yorke reflected how this new approach was a conscious effort that meant each member working alone on contributions before bringing them back to the band. The songs then required assembling in the manner of collage: “things we’d pre-recorded, each of us… were flying at each other,” he remembered, “It’s like editing a film or something.”\n\nThe evidence of editing, sonic manipulation, studio trickery, plays out over Side A in an overt and unabashed manner, daring the listener to get their head around the collage of sounds that the band had piece together into fully-fledged songs. Yet at the same time, the fact that most of the sounds on Limbs come from real instruments meant that there is still a deeply organic edge to the sound palette of Limbs. Sampling actual recordings of live instruments for the most part other than the odd splash of drum machine or synthesizer, Limbs forges a symbiotic relationship with natural instrumentation that harnesses the power of technology to poignant effect, manipulating and splicing unique performances into affecting and invigorating loops and samples. This relationship between the human and the machine — a recurrent theme in Radiohead’s discography — is therefore integral to Limbs, but in a newly reflective manner whereby there is little in the way of social commentary, and more a reflection on the rhythms of human existence, and our symbiotic connection with the natural world.\n\nIndeed, nature and its rhythms abound across Limbs. From the bubbling drum machine and wave-like drum skitters of Bloom to the sawmill-like grind of the rhythms on Little by Little, from the wild abandon of the schizophrenic beats on Feral to the heartbeat of Give up the Ghost and the perfect circle of Separator’s core groove, Limbs revolves around rhythmic cycles. The album itself was clearly conceived as a cycle, as is made clear in the album artwork, which shows eight hands like the spokes on a wheel, referring to seasons and related cycles of time. The story of the album presents a cycle, too. But to explain this reading in more detail, I want to first consider the grand themes at the heart of Limbs.\n\nAcross both the ‘newspaper album’ and ‘the universal sigh’ are short stories and sets of lyrics that seem to serve as warnings, with the common fear among them being the onset of a depression or malaise that pervades modern life. This depression is described as a coldness that freezes us to our core: as a piece that appears in both the newspaper album and The Universal Sigh describes it, “everything was normal and as it should be until one day I woke up and there was something wrong… something was cold and it was inside, not outside… The cold spread until I was like a sculpture of ice… No-one noticed and everything carried on being normal and as it should be, all around me. But I was frozen.” This sinister passage invokes a world in which people are freezing up, unable to feel or cry, and yet no one is noticing, everything feels ‘normal’. This also seems to be attached to the meaning of that phrase ‘wall of ice’ that had been floating around since 2009: in another passage, lyrics describe a protagonist existing “behind a wall of ice” looking “through hollow eyes”. This character is frozen because they don’t want to challenge anything: believing that everything inside their head should be kept to themselves, and that “life is short, so I don’t mess around.” This character knows their station, staying behind the wall of ice “for our own protection” and “raising our glasses to what we’ll never have.”\n\nThis fear of seeing people succumb to this coldness reveals itself in a repeated line in the artwork that reads “I see zombies,” suggesting the mass deterioration of society into homogenous frozen citizens. But this line is accompanied by the words “go your own way” — a plea for independence that could act as an antidote to the coldness setting in; indeed, emblazoned in large lettering beside the ‘wall of ice’ lyrics and the passage about freezing up are the words “It’s not too late; it’s never too late.” This seems to be a fundamental message at the core of Limbs; that salvation from the zombification, depression and malaise that characterises modern life is out there.\n\nAnd a piece in The Universal Sigh titled ‘Forests of the Mind’ makes it explicit exactly where this salvation lies. Here the writer Jay Griffiths begins with the description of his own depression: “I had been suffering depression for months… I was lost in that bleak, hollow emptiness, haunted by thoughts of suicide, all my vitality gone.” But one day, the writer is invited to go to the forests of the Peruvian Amazon. Once there, he recalls, “I was surrounded by the warmth and breath of the forest, green and vital, as if I were drinking in something of its essence, its spirit, its soul — and I needed that so badly because I had lost my own.” He concludes that “wherever there are forests there is life,” that forests are “sources of spirit” and that his “acute feeling of soul loss, of being dangerously de-animated, was cured by the animation, the spirit, of the forests”.\n\nThis sentiment is key, and it ties in with the common theme across these writings and artworks that the modern world had essentially stolen this man’s soul and sucked the life out of him, leaving him frozen. Curiously Thom Yorke had written a song called ‘I Froze Up’ that dates as far back as 2002, and yet the song was also clearly in consideration for The King of Limbs, since he performed it at the same 2010 acoustic gig where he debuted ‘Give up the Ghost’ and ‘Separator’. This song contained the refrain, “I could have been anyone, but one day I froze up,” leaving him stuck with someone who he describes as the “light wiping out my battery.” Despite this haunting song never being released, its theme of being frozen obviously carried over into the genesis of Limbs, which widened this concern with individual depression into a societal and systemic disease that was sapping the world of its vitality. In his piece, Jay Griffiths gives voice to this grand theme that echoes throughout the album, arguing that “there is something far wider happening, the tragedy of divorce from the essential wildness of life… Tragedy works through crushing the spirit, in overwork, commuting, rush-hour exhaustion, worries, debts, bills, stress and the bad news which we all know.” For Griffiths, “forests are… the opposite of depression. Where depression is dull, the forests shimmer with vitality. Whereas depression is a congealed stasis, the forests wriggle, dance and jump. Where depression is a horrible lonely illness, the heart of the forest-wisdom is the irrefutable interconnectedness of all life.” Indeed, the vibrant and dense rhythms of Limbs speak to this vital, life-affirming animation of the natural world. Tellingly, following the piece by Jay Griffiths is a piece of artwork showing trees rising up to the sky and a close-up of the forest floor, accompanied by the word ‘infinity’. The message is clear: in nature lies all the possibilities and life of the universe.\n\nOf course, Radiohead had been exploring the idea of the deadening, soul-crushing effects of modern life ever since Ok Computer, but where that album was markedly dystopian, Limbs finally offers a way out of dystopia. And the story it tells is that very passage away from the coldness and into the light. This is the reason why, alongside its more haunting passages, the newspaper album is littered with glaring letters offering hopeful mantras, including “it is not too late,” “Open. No More Hiding,” “some small changes in your daily life” and, of course, “open your mouth wide.” It is why we are constantly reminded of “the limits we face,” and of the soul-sapping impact of “tumbling clowns,” “waving flags” and “ticker tape parades.” It is why, in one set of lyrics, a character “tapes himself up, builds himself a raft and sets off “with all the strength I have left in me,” inviting “the currents and forces of nature” to “do what they will” and leaving behind “wholesome fucking worthy fluorescent reality.” It is why another character who dislikes “hiding in the darkness” and listening to “a deafening drone” asks himself: “did you ever consider… a life in which threads are untangled,” where we “go our own way, “make our rules” and throw ourselves “into a barrier” rather than hiding behind it? In the manner of a parable, Limbs tells the story of this necessary return to nature and of an escape from the sickness of modern life. I now want to show how this story unfolds across each of its constituent tracks.\n\nThe opening track, Bloom, presents us with the world beyond that aforementioned barrier, or what is also called the “great divide” that is made reference to in the extra lyrics for ‘Bloom’ showcased in the newspaper album. Across this great divide is a place “as open as the sky” where “your rules do not apply” — the place that “keeps me alive.” As the opening track, Bloom functions as the thematic figurehead of Limbs, containing in its lyrics the overall message of rejuvenation via the natural world, a place to heal past hurts. But more than that, Bloom — through title, lyrics and music — offers a kind of genesis story in and of itself, a place where the “ocean blooms” in concert with our own kind of spiritual rebirth. The theme of birth and of life blooming both within the narrator’s own soul and within the natural world around him is reflected in the music, from the evolving rhythms and flowering melodies to the swell of the horns, suggesting a whole universe coming to life and expanding into something vast and overwhelming. The extra lyrics for Bloom offer further insight, lines such as “I throw my arms wide. Open your heart and smile,” suggesting a wholistic oneness forming between man and nature. This yearning for salvation via the natural world is the great message of Limbs, stressing nature’s ecological, spiritual and existential importance in the face of impending personal and societal collapse. And the genesis story of Bloom acts as a kind of thematic preface to the journey of the album that begins in earnest in the second track, ‘Morning Mr Magpie.’\n\n‘Magpie’ is probably the most divisive song on Limbs, often coming last in fan rankings of the album alongside ‘Feral’. But the song came alive for me when I started to notice how much the twitching, paranoid guitar line seems to echo the frenetic movements of the magpie itself, and the ways in which the song speaks to the superstitious, paranoid mindset of the narrator that he sees reflected in the bird, which he regards both as the source of and yet also the antidote to his malaise. Seeing a solitary magpie is, of course, an omen of ill luck, but according to the folklore this can be assuaged by bidding good morning to the magpie in question. Here we see how far the condition of the song’s narrator dovetails with the overall theme of Limbs, in that he reflects the weary, worn-down protagonist who is slowly succumbing to the illness of modern life. The thieving magpie is accused of having stolen everything from the man. “You’ve got some nerve coming here,” he tells the magpie, inferring its alleged past crimes and blaming his malaise on simple ill luck, therefore taking no personal responsibility for his condition. The lines “you know you should, but you don’t” seem to reference this abdication of any personal agency, instead becoming a passive and self-pitying victim. This protagonist tells the magpie that it has stolen his memory, his magic, and his melody. This last one is particularly revealing, in that a songwriter’s worst fear is writers’ block, and therefore his being incapable of finding a melody. Yorke here seems to refer to his own symptoms of feeling dried up, uninspired and depressed, which he has made reference to in numerous interviews — particularly in the period following OK Computer. But instead of searching for real answers in the world around him, the narrator instead shakes his fist at the sky and blames a bird for his ills, this superstition setting him at odds with the natural world and only perpetuating his feelings of hopelessness and despair.\n\nTrying to placate the bird with this good morning message but failing to overcome his bitterness at his circumstances, the final chorus of the song sees the song almost coming apart at the seams as the rhythms churn and contort around the narrator’s desperate message. At the dawn of the album, figuratively imagined as morning, we find the narrator on the brink of despair. The inherent, pining sadness of ‘Magpie’ is a quality that I feel has long gone overlooked, but it tinges the song’s strange, fragile lack of colour with a desperation and coldness that links directly to the theme at the heart of the album.\n\n‘Little by Little’ takes these ideas one step further, moving beyond a place of sadness into one of jaded detachment. This spell, according to the lyrics, can only be broken by love, which might alleviate the soul-crushing impact of “routines and schedules,” and of the “obligations” and “complications” of everyday life. The song’s opening line directly signals this predicament, the song’s protagonist willing himself “don’t turn nasty now,” staring down the “door to hell.” “Once you’ve been around you’ve been around enough,” he sings, jaded by experience, claiming that if he’s never earnest he’ll never get judged. Authenticity has been replaced by cynicism, while the music itself is dense, tangled, and sinister — suggesting a place where moral lines are blurred, where the predictable rhythms of everyday life pulse and grind and threaten to subsume us. Even as the narrator states that this drudgery and routine is slowly killing us, however, the lighter dance of the song’s chorus steps back in with a signal of hope, the prospect of companionship and human connection a potential saviour that might pull him back towards the light. Only love can break the spell, “the last one out of the box” referring to the hope that remained in Pandora’s box after everything else had escaped from it. Meanwhile, the lines “the glue won’t hold,” the “the thread unpulls,” “uncurling with my love” also suggests the possibility of love to work away, little by little, at existing structures and pull them apart. It is perhaps this realisation that provokes the decision the protagonist makes in the fourth track ‘Feral’, which functions as a crucial turning point in this narrative.\n\nHere, the narrator discovers their agency and finally decides to cut loose in search of something greater. The song is envisaged both musically and conceptually as a literal incarnation of ‘wildness’ and a return to ‘wildness,’ rediscovering our primal selves and ducking out of the repressive structures of modern life. Breaking across the ‘barrier’ and into the wild, Yorke’s chopped up vocals and the propulsive beats, layered over one another to chaotic effect, conjure up the image of a soul finally breaking loose and embarking a journey back to nature. The song is borderline animalistic, its lyrics hardly discernible; driven to breaking point, its protagonist is quite literally feral, closing side A with an emphatic declaration of their wildness and their desire to rediscover some fundamental part of themselves that has been lost.\n\nSide B opens with ‘Lotus Flower,’ and here begins the dark night of the soul that unfolds over the second half of the album. The song is one of the most mysterious of Radiohead’s career, its lyrics alluding both to sins and a loss of self, as well as a soul-searching attempt to find oneself. Lotus flowers, of course, only grow in mud; its multi-layered symbolism often alludes to the concept of flourishing in spite of the conditions of its surroundings. This seems to be the central premise of the song; that its protagonist dances “around a pit”, precariously teetering on the edge of disaster, his desire for “the moon upon a stick” — i.e. to have his cake and eat it — a potential source of ruin. The lyrics allude to temptation and possible infidelity in lines such as “while the cat is away do what we want” and in the other lines that suggest the narrator attaching himself to the object of his desires and essentially disappearing, losing himself, becoming invisible and cutting himself off from his true nature. But the symbolism of the lotus flower nods to more positive, Buddhist ideas, in which the lotus signifies the transformation of the soul away from attachments that cause us suffering. In realising that he has to set the object of his desires free, that the weeds have set in, the narrator sacrifices his attachments in search of something greater, his advocation to “listen to your heart” rejecting his previous egotism. Harking back to the lyrics of ‘Feral’ — I’m not yours / you’re not mine — this process of setting one another free and letting each other go is part of a process in which the narrator embraces solitude in favour of possible enlightenment. The image of him dancing around the pit, therefore, is just not one of precariousness, but of existential angst; this being a classic existentialist dilemma voiced by the philosopher Jean Paul Sartre, who described the realisation of the fragility of one’s own freedom as a kind of vertigo, staring off the cliff edge and discovering one’s own totality of being. Wanting the ‘moon upon a stick just to see what if’ could represent this possibility of total freedom, of choice and its consequences, and of the possible desire for infidelity that the narrator wrestles with. The lotus flower, however, slowly unfurling, represents a slow process of enlightenment that grows out of the darkest conditions. This is why, since ancient times, it has been a symbol of purity and spiritual awakening, a symbol of our ability to escape and bloom from the complications of our daily lives. ‘Lotus Flower’ represents the next step after ‘Feral’, then’, in that it is the decision to bloom in the right direction, to find oneself again and to listen to one’s heart.\n\nThe next track, ‘Codex’ represents the consequences of this decision, as the narrator, totally alone out in nature, now undergoes a kind of spiritual cleansing in water, allowing him to be born anew, fantasising about a life where ‘no one gets hurt’, where they’ve ‘done nothing wrong’. The water of the ‘clear lake’ represents purity and innocence, into which he slides. The meditative, sombre piano leads towards a subtle string and brass instrumental crescendo in which we might imagine this moment of submersion. Yet the resolve of the song on a minor key suggests the impossibility of this fantasy of rebirth, that the weight of the past cannot be simply shed, that the water cannot offer a fresh start. It is only the beginning of a process of revelation; the dark night of the soul continues.\n\n‘Give up the Ghost’ represents the final stage of this three-song act, the birdsong signalling the arrival of morning and the end of this dark night of the soul. It is probably the most devastating song on the album, and one of Radiohead’s most beautiful compositions. The campfire pulse of the acoustic guitar’s heartbeat, the repetitive lyrical mantra ‘don’t hurt me’ and the gradual build-up of vocal layers all suggest a narrator haunted by past trauma, desperate to put to bed a lifetime of hurts yet unable to let go of the stranglehold they have on his psyche. Of course, the phrase to ‘give up the ghost’ means to stop clinging on, and essentially, to let something die. This song itself speaks to a kind of death, a willing of oneself to let go and start again. Meanwhile, the phrase ‘in your arms’ that repeats across almost every line suggests that this death is the death of a relationship, in which hurts have been committed. This may be the same relationship alluded to in Lotus Flower — the person that he has to let go in order to achieve some kind of spiritual salvation. But it also suggests the death that occurs at the end of every life cycle — demonstrating how far the album sets up the idea of life blooming, flourishing, achieving enlightenment and then facing death.\n\nThe final track ‘Separator’ invokes the idea of afterlife and rebirth following the metaphorical death that occurred in ‘Give up the Ghost’. The protagonist seems to wake from a ‘long and vivid dream’, finally ‘free of all the weight I’ve been carrying’. This is a place after death, an Edenic landscape where ‘the sweetest flowered fruits are hanging from the trees’. While the title ‘Separator’ invokes this idea of a space between states of being — a kind of metaphysical separation of the soul from the body — the track was originally called ‘Mousedogbird’, as Yorke mentioned at his 2010 performance in Cambridge. This title referred to the work of children’s author Judith Kerr, and specifically the concept of the ‘mousedogbird’ comes from the story ‘Mog in the Dark,’ in which a cat, Mog, waits out in the dark wanting to get back to what he repeatedly calls his house, his basket and his people. In this kind of limbo space, he dreams of all the things that he fears, which come together in the form of a surreal ‘mousedogbird’ that he then flies on before falling back down to earth, waking up from his slumber and returning to his house, his basket and his people. ‘Separator’ uses this imagery of waking up from dark dreams — from a similar ‘dark night of the soul’. It is as though ‘Separator’ suggests an awakening from the strange world of Limbs itself, coming back into the light — both in an everyday sense and in a sense of spiritual enlightenment. The line ‘if you think this is over then you’re wrong’ meanwhile, hints at rebirth or reincarnation, as do other lines such as ‘I’m a fish now / out of water’. Of course, this ‘rebirth’ will occur once the listener spins the album from the beginning again and hears the first moments of ‘Bloom’, in which new life is born. The album is a loop, from birth to death and back again, and is designed to be experienced as such, conceived as a cycle.\n\nFrom this birth or genesis story in Bloom to the allusions of afterlife and rebirth in Separator, man’s relationship with nature takes front and centre stage in an album designed to make us think about cycles of life: the permanent, the transient and the relationship between the two. Add to this the fact that the music itself is built through repeated rhythms and loops, and we start to get a clearer sense of how Limbs revolves around this idea of everything being cyclical and recyclable. The grooves and repetitions at the heart of the songs nod to eternal cycles and patterns that are embedded in the fabric of nature and the world at large. Even the ‘newspaper album’ reflected this cyclical theme, its very material nodding to cycles of impermanence and redistribution, as does the artwork of the album, which as have seen plays to the idea of nature’s cycles via trees, plants, creatures, and seasons.\n\nThis is, of course, my own reading, but as I have shown, there are numerous signs as to how the band envisaged this record, and I think that the ways in which the music, words and artwork all correspond compliments this interpretation. Thom Yorke himself reflected that much of this content had been stimulated by his environmental concerns, with thoughts of mutation, of wildness and, of course, the ancient natural forms such as The King of Limbs itself — a tree in a forest in Wiltshire in the UK — taking front and centre. ‘We are of the Earth,” Yorke would sing in 2016’s The Numbers, “to her we do return.” This ecological consciousness combines with spiritual inquiry in Limbs to deliver an album whose meaning hinges on the interdependent relationship between humanity and the natural world. The natural world here is a sacred place that we destroy or disconnect from at our own peril; it harbours redemptive and rejuvenating properties — such as being the cradle of birth for all things in ‘Bloom’, the washing away of sins in ‘Codex’ or the campfire seclusion of ‘Give up the Ghost’. The variable power of nature versus the power of the self is present not just via these songs’ narrative arcs, but via the production of the record itself, in which the organic and the instinctive vie with human manipulation, in which syncopated rhythms wrestle with one another and even threaten to come apart at the seams in the chaotic Feral. Limbs sees the rhythms of the world around us collide with the potential chaos of our own making, and pushes this concept to breaking point. The relative harmony and righting of things of Side B is the necessary tonic to the wild disharmony and chaos of Side A; the album hinges on the resolution of this order and chaos. It is for this reason that each side is so essential in its relationship to the other; each functions as a side of the same coin in delicate balance — and it is this maintaining of harmony with nature that Limbs holds up as its plea to the listener, both for our own psychological wellbeing and for the sake of humanity at large. While the album itself is designed to be ephemeral, akin to human life itself, it speaks to the permanence of things bigger than ourselves and asks us to maintain them long after the record has stopped playing, after the newspaper fades, after our own bodies return to the earth. This is why Limbs has such depth. It is why it manages to be so deeply personal but also universal and expansive. It is, in short, why the record is, in my opinion, a masterpiece.\n\nIt is also why the album works so perfectly as it is, as eight tracks, as 37 minutes and no more. Yes, we all love songs like Supercollider and The Daily Mail, but they quite simply would not have fit into this project, either sonically or conceptually. At a stretch, The Butcher works sonically, having come from the same sessions, but it is unclear where would have fit within the tightly written arc of Limbs’ conceptual narrative, and so it makes total sense that they left it off. It is also why I prefer the studio version of Limbs to its live counterpart. While the latter is fantastic in different ways, the studio versions of these songs are their own universe in which these deeper meanings reside, and in which the concept of Limbs as a whole comes to life. In the live versions, they are just songs once more, and they sound closer to the Radiohead of Ok Computer or In Rainbows. On the album, they are experimental, unique and fraught with deeper meaning. They are an invitation to another world of swelling oceans, tangled woods and twilit lakes. Thom Yorke himself described Limbs as a “visual album” and I believe it is probably the most visual of Radiohead’s albums, in that every song is another landscape within that world the band created, full of natural imagery, of primordial and unfamiliar rhythms, of both ancient and modern life conversing in unpredictable dialogue with one another.\n\nRadiohead could have given us another In Rainbows. But this is a band that didn’t want to rest on their laurels, nor reproduce a working process that had almost finished them off. That’s simply not where they were anymore. The King of Limbs was a sign of Radiohead’s ambition not only to challenge themselves and their ways of making and releasing music, but to challenge us as listeners via something artistically ambitious, intellectually motivated, and sonically uncharted in their discography. Those wanting the warm embrace of the Radiohead on In Rainbows were met with an album whose door remained shut and whose key required searching for. There were no easy handouts here; one has to seek out the meaning of these songs deep within the world of the album that the band created. And perhaps it is this contrarian impulse that makes The King of Limbs so singular, so unfamiliar, so deeply strange. But when you meet the album on its own terms and dive head first into its alien landscapes, The King of Limbs is an album with just as much life and soul as any other. This music is still deeply human, deeply vulnerable. If In Rainbows delivered you its songs on rays of light, the songs on Limbs sounds as though they’ve grown out of the earth itself, waiting to be excavated, diamonds in the rough.\n\nDiscovering the beauty of this music has been one of the most rewarding musical experiences of my lifetime. I just hope that others will find some inspiration here to revisit The King of Limbs, perhaps to hear it a little bit differently, or at the very least, to give it another chance. Maybe one day, when Radiohead have long ceased to make music, this album will finally receive the love and praise that it truly deserves."
