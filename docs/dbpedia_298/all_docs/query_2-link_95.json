        "text": "Writers - Berryman/Buckland/Champion/Martin\n\nFirst released - 2009\n\nOriginal album - Pandemonium\n\nProducer (Chrismas EP version) - Stuart Price, Dave Emery\n\nSubsequent albums - Yes 2017 reissue Further Listening 2008-2010 bonus disc\n\nOther releases - Christmas EP\n\nShortly before the start of their 2009 Pandemonium Tour, the Boys had strongly hinted in at least one interview that the setlist would include a new cover song. But few suspected they would pick something as recent as Coldplay's big 2008 hit \"Viva la Vida\" (the title of which is Spanish that would translate literally as \"live the life,\" but which would be more accurately translated idiomatically as \"long live life,\" \"up with life,\" or \"hooray for life\"). In retrospect it may not be all that surprising, however, considering singer and co-songwriter Chris Martin's avowed fandom and debt of influence to the Pet Shop Boys. It's almost like a little acknowledging nod back from one pop generation to the next. Of course, it doesn't hurt to really like the song, either. After playing the Coldplay track during a guest DJ gig on Absolute Radio, Chris described it as \"possibly the best song of 2008.\" Later, Chris and Neil decided to include the tour's Stuart Price-produced medley/mashup of \"Viva la Vida\" and \"Domino Dancing\" on their December 2009 Christmas EP.\n\nPrice had previously remixed \"Viva la Vida\" for Coldplay, which may have influenced the PSB decision to cover it. But other factors should be considered as well. For instance, it may have been at least partly inspired by the fact that Coldplay had been publicly accused of plagiarism and sued by guitarist Joe Satriani, who claimed that the song's melody too closely resembles his 2004 track \"If I Could Fly.\" (The case was settled out of court and dismissed in September 2009. There's no word at this time of the terms of the settlement, although Coldplay will not be required to admit any wrongdoing and a payment to Satriani may be involved.) What's more, Yusuf Islam—the former Cat Stevens—has stated that the melody is also strikingly similar to portions of his 1973 release \"Foreigner Suite.\" Stevens, in fact, has said that he, too, is considering a lawsuit—perhaps against both Coldplay and Satriani. It's the \"Stevens connection\" in particular that may have influenced the PSB choice. After all, quite early in their own career Neil and Chris had also been accused of stealing from a Cat Stevens song: in their case, the claim (by Jonathan King) was that the melody of \"It's a Sin\" was a rip-off of Stevens's \"Wild World.\" The Boys were ultimately exonerated. Still, it's rather likely that, roughly 20 years later, they would strongly sympathize with Coldplay. Performing this song could well have been a way of showing their solidarity and support.\n\nSome of my site visitors have suggested other possible inspirations for covering this song. Following the Boys' performance at the 2009 Brit Awards, where they were recognized for \"Outstanding Contribution to Music,\" Neil attended a charity concert during which Coldplay performed \"Viva la Vida.\" Toward the end of the song, lead singer Chris Martin pointed Neil out to the audience, who roared an ovation. Neil responded by \"conducting\" from his balcony perch the crowd's continued singalong to the chorus. It's possible that this may have tipped him off to the song's tremendous potential as an excuse (as if any were needed) for audience participation. Indeed, at most of the Pandemonium Tour shows, the Boys' rendition of \"Viva la Vida\"—despite the somewhat different arrangement that they've given it—has proved an occasion for widespread singing along.\n\nIn perhaps the most fascinating interpretation of all—one that Neil and Chris themselves have alluded to—the lyrics of \"Viva la Vida\" may have particular resonance as commentary on the Pet Shop Boys' changed status in the world of popular music. When Neil sings, \"I used to rule the world…,\" could he be applying Coldplay's lyrics to the path of his own career? After all, he himself coined the term \"imperial phase\" to describe the period in the late eighties when it seemed that he and Chris could do no wrong.* To use metaphors from the song, they were \"kings\" who \"held the key.\" But the world of popular music is one \"built on sand,\" with ever-shifting styles and tastes. Pointedly, \"Domino Dancing\" with its famous \"Watch them all fall down\" refrain—the track that the Boys chose to mash up with \"Viva la Vida\"—is widely considered (including by Neil himself) to have signaled the end of their imperial phase. In essence, they've had to make way, at least at the upper reaches of the pop charts, for much younger artists, brand new \"kings\"—like Coldplay themselves. Are Neil and Chris now wondering when St. Peter will call their names, at least as a major hit-making pop act?\n\nAnnotations\n\nThe title comes from a painting by Mexican painter Frida Kahlo (1907-1954).\n\nColdplay lead singer and chief lyricist Chris Martin hasâperhaps half-facetiouslyâdescribed \"Viva la Vida\" as a love song set during the French Revolution.\n\nOf course, Neil and Chris didn't write this song, which was composed by the members of Coldplay. It includes an assortment allusions, largely from the Bible, including:\n\n\"â¦ my castles stand upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand\" â An allusion to a parable of Jesus, in which he likened people who hear his teachings but don't heed them to \"a foolish man which built his house upon the sand\" (Matthew 7:26), after which storms easily destroyed it. The lyricist (again, probably Chris Martin) also curiously combines this biblical image with another, harkening back to the fate of Lot's wife when she disobeyd God and turned to look back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, at which point she was transformed into \"a pillar of salt\" (Genesis 19:26).\n\n\"I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\" â Jerusalem is of course one of the chief holy cities of three religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\n\"Roman cavalry choirs are singing\" â A possible reference to Roman soldiers on horseback (cavalry), but even more likely a punning allusion to the very similar placename \"Calvary,\" which is the place where Jesus was crucified. The song's references to martyrdomâsee the next bullet pointâlend credence to such a pun. Hence, \"Roman cavalry\" here could simultaneously (in true punning fashion) allude to both the Roman soldiers who crucified Jesus and (because of the \"choirs\") the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\"â¦ my head on a silver plate\" â John the Baptist, considered the \"forerunner\" of Jesus, was beheaded by King Herod at the behest of his stepdaughter Salome (who was in turn prodded by her mother into making this request). According to tradition, his head was given to her on a silver plate, although the Bible (Mark 6:28) says only that it was delivered on a charger (a large flat platter).\n\n\"I know St. Peter won't call my name\" â St. Peter was one of Jesus's disciples, considered by Roman Catholics the first Pope. Because Jesus said to him, \"I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven\" (Matthew 16:19, King James Version), he is traditionally regarded as \"heaven's gatekeeper.\" Thus by saying that St. Peter won't call his name, the narrator is suggesting that he's barred from heaven and therefore damned to hell.\n\nMixes/Versions\n\nOfficially released\n\nMixer: Stuart Price\n\nMashup with \"Domino Dancing\" (5:34)\n\nAvailable on the Christmas EP and one of the Yes 2017 reissue Further Listening 2008-2010 bonus discs\n\nPandemonium CD live version in medley with \"Se A Vida E,\" \"Discoteca,\" and \"Domino Dancing\" (6:00)\n\nList cross-references\n\nPSB \"cover songs\" and who first recorded them\n\nPSB songs that contain biblical allusions\n\nPSB connections to the 2012 Olympics\n\nReal places mentioned by name in PSB songs\n\nReal people mentioned by name or title in PSB lyrics\n\nWhat it's about: Neil's succinct statements on what a song is \"about\"\n\nPSB songs with lyrics that don't contain the title"
