        "text": "References\n\nParenthetical citations direct attention to the more detailed reference list, which provides complete source information. This section first delves into APSA’s standard rules on turning a source into an appropriate reference. This is followed by additional details organized by type of reference. At the end of the section, specific rules about the reference list itself are given.\n\nAs opposed to the notes and bibliography style that some professions utilize, the author-date style has the year of publication as the second element of a reference, instead of the last. This may be a change for some, but otherwise, the basic reference guidelines are the same as the notes and bibliography style.\n\nReference lists must list each source used in the author’s research. Each reference must also explicitly link to at least one parenthetical citation in the manuscript. Note that selected and annotated reference lists, as well as reference essays, will not be accepted. It is the sole responsibility of the author, not the journal’s editorial team, to provide an accurate reference list. Always reference the version of the source that is consulted while researching.\n\nGeneral Format\n\nEach part of a reference is separated by a period, except when otherwise indicated. Each part begins with a capital letter unless it is a lowercase part of an author’s, editor’s, or translator’s name.\n\n1. Name\n\nAuthor’s, editor’s, or translator’s names should be given as they appear with the source. This is true for the style in which the names are written and, for multiauthored sources, the order of the names. Be respectful of naming preferences. However, if necessary for identification, opt for the fuller form of the name (including full first names and middle initials).\n\nThe first (or only) author’s, editor’s, or translator’s name is always inverted in a reference (i.e., last name, first name). In multiauthored sources, the other authors’ names are not inverted, and are separated by commas. Use and, not an ampersand (&), before the final given name. Do not use et al. in a reference as one would in a parenthetical citation, unless there are ten or more authors. In that case, list the first seven authors and then use et al. (14.76).\n\nIf the source was published by an organization, association, or corporation and does not carry an author’s name, the organization is listed as the author, even if it is also the publisher (14.84). Abbreviations can be used in references in this instance. However, if abbreviations are used for the name of the organization, it must be followed by the full name in parentheses in the first (or only) reference (15.27).\n\nWhen no author is associated with a source, but an editor(s) or translator(s) is, those names take the place of the author’s name. The abbreviations ed. or eds., or trans. follows the name(s), preceded by a comma (14.103).\n\nIf the source does not have an author, editor, translator, organization, association, or corporation that sponsored it, the title should be used in place of the name.\n\n2. Special Cases\n\nIf two or more authors, editors, or translators share the same last name, the last name is repeated in the reference, even if it not repeated in the source itself (14.77).\n\nThe term Anonymous to represent an author’s, editor’s, or translator’s name for a source should be avoided unless the source is explicitly attributed to ‘Anonymous’ or when several anonymous works need to be grouped. Instead, the reference should begin with the title of the source (14.79).\n\nBrackets with the author’s, editor’s, or translator’s name inside can be used when the author’s name was omitted from the source but is known. If there is measurable certainty of the name, but not complete certainty, a question mark can be included within the brackets after the name (14.79).\n\nIf a pseudonym needs to be used, [pseud.] should follow the name in the reference list, but be omitted from parenthetical text citations (14.80). If the pseudonym is widely known, it should be treated like a regular name (e.g., Mark Twain).\n\nEven if the last name of an author, editor, or translator was changed for any reason (e.g., marriage), continue to use the name published with the source (14.82).\n\n3. Year\n\nThe year of publication is usually the only part of the date needed in a reference. For first editions of sources, this date is the same as the copyright date.\n\nWhen numerous years are listed with the copyright, use the year that the most recent (14.142). When multiple volumes of a multivolume source are cited together, give a closed range, or, if unfinished, open range of years (14.144). For reprints, include the original copyright date first, in brackets, and then give the reprint date.\n\nWhen the year of publication cannot be located, n.d. must take its place (14.145). When the publication is forthcoming, the term forthcoming, set in roman, takes the place of the year (14.146).\n\n4. Titles of Work\n\nSpelling, hyphenation, and punctuation in the original title should be preserved with a few exceptions. Words in full capitals should be changed to uppercase and lowercase, headline-style capitalization should be applied throughout, and ampersands can be changed to and. Numbers should remain spelled out or given as numerals according to the original source.\n\nIf the existing punctuation between the title and the subtitle is anything other than a colon, question mark, or exclamation point, it should be changed to a colon, followed by a space, and italicized if the title is italicized. The first word of the subtitle after the colon should be capitalized (14.88).\n\nSentence-style capitalization is often used with non-English titles and should not be changed (14.98). If the English translation of the title is given, the original title should follow enclosed in brackets, in roman font, and capitalized sentence-style (14.99). If only the English translated-title is given, give the original language in brackets with in preceding it, following the title.\n\nMiyamoto, Yoshio. 1942. Hoso to kokka [Broadcasting and the national defense state]. Tokyo: Nihon Hoso Shuppan Kyokai.\n\nMiyamoto, Yoshio. 1942. Broadcasting and the National Defense State [in Japanese]. Tokyo: Nihon Hoso Shuppan Kyokai.\n\n5. Volume and Numbers\n\nFor volume and page numbers, Arabic numerals should be used. The exception is if the source has any page numbers with roman numerals (14.147).\n\nFirst and last page numbers should be used and indicated as a range (14.148). Whereas parenthetical citations point to a specifically contextual page or range of pages, references need to include the page numbers of the entire section, chapter, or article (14.22).\n\np. and pp. should be omitted in all circumstances, except for when ambiguity needs to be clarified (14.151).\n\nWhen a volume number is relevant, it should precede the page numbers and a colon should be inserted between the two, with a space (14.152).\n\nWith electronic sources, such as ebooks, reflowable or scrollable text can affect page number citation. When this is the case, a chapter number or section heading should be used instead (14.160).\n\n6. DOIs or URLs\n\nWhenever a source is found, read, or used online, a direct link that leads the reader to the source should be included. It is never acceptable to only include a link to an online source, it must be included with other citation data (14.6). The preferred order for citing online sources is the following: (1) DOI (digital object identifier) numerals, (2) a permalink URL (uniform resource locator), and (3) a short version of the URL.\n\nA DOI can easily be found in databases, and only requires the numerals and slashes after .org/ stated as doi: and then the numerals.\n\ndoi: 10.1017/S1049096517002505\n\nA permalink is a link often provided by the website, which is a permanent URL instead of an internal or time-sensitive URL.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science;\n\nnot http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=political_science\n\nFinally, a short version of the URL cuts off extraneous numerals (dictating when the site was accessed, usually after a question mark) (14.7–14.10).\n\nURLs should be presented in full, beginning with the protocol (i.e., http or https). The trailing slash (/), sometimes at the end of a URL, is part of the URL and should be included. Capitalization of components in the URL should be respected as some may be case sensitive. Punctuate sentences and citations with URLs in them as normal, generally with a period after them (14.17).\n\nIncluding an access date in a reference is only necessary if a publication or revision date cannot be determined from the source (14.12). Nevertheless, it does not hurt to record access dates, or, in the case that the source’s content will definitely change, preserving a permanent record of the source via a permanent link creation service such as perma.cc (14.15).\n\nBooks\n\nThe elements listed below are often additions or slight changes to the generalized format described in the previous subsection, taken from a book’s front matter (14.100):\n\nFull name of author(s), editor(s), translator(s) or, if none are listed, the name of the institution standing in for one\n\nYear of publication\n\nFull title, including subtitle if applicable Chapter information, if applicable\n\nEdition, if not the first, if applicable\n\nSeries title, if applicable\n\nEditor, compiler, or translator, if there are any also listed\n\nNumber of the volume(s) cited, if applicable\n\nPage number or numbers of a section or chapter if applicable\n\nInformation on the publisher, city, and date published\n\nElectronic book information, if applicable\n\nDOI, or URL, if applicable\n\n1. Chapters\n\nWhen a specific chapter needs to be referenced, the title used should be the title of the chapter, enclosed in quotation marks, followed by In, followed by the title of the book itself, italicized. The chapter’s page numbers should follow the title of the book itself, preceded by a comma (14.106). Another acceptable format that does not include page numbers is to include Chap. and the number in front of in.\n\nHalchin, L. Elaine. 2001. “And This Parent Went to Market: Education as Public Versus Private Good.” In School Choice in the Real World, eds. Robert Maranto, Scott Milliman, Frederick Hess and April Gresham, 39–57. Boulder, CO: Westview.\n\nHalchin, L. Elaine. 2001. “And This Parent Went to Market: Education as Public Versus Private Good.” Chap. 1 in School Choice in the Real World, eds. Robert Maranto, Scott Milliman, Frederick Hess and April Gresham. Boulder, CO: Westview.\n\nIf the reference is to an introduction, preface, foreword, or afterword the general term is used before the title of the work as a stand-in for a chapter title (14.110).\n\n2. Edition\n\nWhen an edition other than the first is used, the cardinal numeral of the edition follows the title in the reference (whether chapter information is provided or not), preceded by a comma (14.113). It should not be italicized, even though the title is.\n\nDavidson, Roger H., Walter J. Oleszek, Frances E. Lee, and Eric Schickler. 2016. Congress and Its Members, 14th edition. Washington, DC: CQ Press.\n\nHall, Peter Dobkin. 2006. “A Historical Overview of Philanthropy, Voluntary Associations, and Nonprofit Organizations in the United States, 1600–2000.” In The Nonprofit Sector: A Research Handbook, 2nd edition, eds. W. W. Powell and R. Steinberg, 32–65. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.\n\n3. Series\n\nWhen series names are included, they are neither italicized nor placed in quotation marks. They follow the individual title of the book. The number of the book in the series, as well as the series editor, can be included following the series title (14.123).\n\nMultivolume sources within a series include the volume number after the title, similar to chapter numbers (14.125).\n\n4. Additional Editors, Translators, or Compilers\n\nAs per APSA style, when the name of the editor(s) or translator(s) appears alongside an author’s or authors’ name(s), the name of the editor(s) or translator(s) appears after the title in the reference. Use the same abbreviations: ed. or eds., comp. or comps., or trans. This should be preceded by a comma, not a period. The name(s) should not be inverted (14.104).\n\nHermann, Margaret G. 1984. “Personality and Foreign Policy Decision Making: A Study of Fifty-Three Heads of Government.” In Foreign Policy Decision Making, eds. Donald A. Sylvan and Steve Chan, 133–52. New York: Praeger.\n\n5. Multivolume Works\n\nWhen the entirety of a multivolume work is cited, the total number of volumes is given after the title of the work. The date of publication becomes an inclusive range, if necessary (14.117).\n\nHume, David. 1932. The Letters of David Hume, 2 vols., ed. J. Y. T. Greig. Oxford: Clarendon Press.\n\nWhen only one volume is of interest, the entire work is cited after the title of the volume with Vol., the numeral, and of, preceding the title of the entire work, similar to a chapter (14.119).\n\nHume, David. 1932. Volume II 1766–1776, Vol. 2 of The Letters of David Hume, ed. J. Y. T. Greig. Oxford: Clarendon Press.\n\nIf the multivolume work has a general editor and a different or extra editor for the referenced volume, ed. is added and the names are given accordingly (14.122).\n\n6. Publication Information\n\nWhen including publication information, the order is: (1) place of publication, if given, followed by a colon and (2) the publisher (14.127).\n\nThe place of publication is where the publisher’s main editorial offices are. If two or more locations are given, only include the location listed first (14.129).\n\nIf the place of publication is unknown or confusing to readers, the two-letter postal code can be added for states, or, if another country, the country’s name spelled out (14.130). City names in other languages should be translated or transformed into their preferred English forms (14.131).\n\nThe, Inc., Co., Press, or Publisher are usually omitted from the publisher’s name except for university presses (14.134). If a state’s name is part of a university press name, omit it from the place of publication information.\n\nCambridge University Press\n\nLincoln: University of Nebraska Press\n\nAnd or an ampersand (&) may be used in a publisher’s name, depending on how the information is published with the source (14.135).\n\nNo part of a publisher’s name should be translated (14.136).\n\nIf self-published, do not state so anywhere in the reference, as it will violate anonymity. Instead, follow regular reference guidelines and include the platform or website on which the book was published in lieu of a publisher’s place and name. With books published before 1900, it is acceptable to omit the publisher’s name, leaving just the location (14.128).\n\nWith ebooks, indicate which platform was used following the publication information. If the file format is specified, it should also be included (14.159).\n\nAmazon Kindle PDF\n\nIf a source is unpublished, include Unpublished manuscript after the title and the last modified date of the version consulted (14.216).\n\nLegal and Public Documents\n\nThe following are general guidelines for authors who need to cite legal and public documents in their manuscript. For authors who cite these types of documents often, APSA encourages seeking out and supplementing detailed and specific instructions from The Bluebook, by the Harvard Law Review Association.\n\nLegal and public documents are not included on a reference list. Authors should make every effort to integrate the reference directly into the text. However, depending on the reference’s size, the surrounding sentence structure, and the level of detail desired, these documents can also be cited in an endnote or in a standalone parenthetical citation (14.271).\n\nThe first page number of the document or case is cited directly after the name with no intervening punctuation, and then specific page numbers are given, separated by a comma. These can be sections or paragraphs, and should include the corresponding symbols (14.273). Certain abbreviations and number formatting rules for legal and public documents do not follow the rules outlined elsewhere in this book (14.274): Abbreviations usually use periods or apostrophes\n\nCommon abbreviations should be capitalized (e.g., No., Sess.)\n\nIn parenthetical citations and endnote citations, ordinal numbers should use the following format: 2d, 3d; not: 2nd, 3rd\n\n1. Cases and Court Decisions\n\nWhen cited, full case names are set in roman. This differs from running text, where any version of a case name is italicized (14.276).\n\nOn an applicable basis, after the case name and the year, set off by commas, comes the volume number, the abbreviated name of the reporter, the ordinal series number of the reporter (following the altered number format above), the opening page of the decision, and then the actual page cited, set off by another comma. Following this is the abbreviated name of the court and the year the decision was made, in parentheses.\n\nA. Special Cases\n\nFor Supreme Court decisions, use the United States Reports, abbreviated U.S. in citations. Cases not yet published can be cited to the Supreme Court Reporter, abbreviated S. Ct. in citations. With Supreme Court decisions, the name of the court within the parentheses may be omitted (14.277).\n\nObergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584 (2015).\n\nLower federal court decisions can be cited to the Federal Reporter, abbreviated F. in citations, or the Federal Supplement, abbreviated F. Supp. in citations (14.278).\n\nEaton v. IBM Corp., 925 F. Supp. 487 (S.D. Tex. 1996).\n\n2. Constitutions\n\nUse roman numerals for articles and amendment numbers, but Arabic numerals for subdivisions (14.280).\n\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 2.\n\n3. Legislative and Executive Documents\n\nA. Laws and Statutes\n\nThese include public laws (Pub. L.), which are found in volumes of the United States Statutes at Large (Stat.) and later included in the United States Code (U.S.C.). Note that the No. of the law contains the number of the Congress adjoined with the document number by a hyphen.\n\nHomeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107–296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2012).\n\nB. Bills and Resolutions\n\nFor bills and resolutions originating from the House of Representatives, use H.R. or H.R. Res. accordingly as abbreviated forms. For those from the Senate, use S. and S. Res. accordingly.\n\nSafe and Accurate Food Labeling Act of 2015, H.R. 1599, 114th Cong. (2015).\n\nC. Hearings\n\nUse the full given title of the hearing in italics, and add, if necessary, the names of the committees included. At the end of the citation include, in parentheses, the speaker’s name, title, and affiliation.\n\nFacebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data: Joint Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary and the S. Comm. on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 115th Cong. (2018) (statement of Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook).\n\nD. Congressional Reports and Documents\n\nFor reports and documents originating from the House of Representatives, use H.R. Rep. or H.R. Doc. accordingly as abbreviated forms. For those from the Senate, use S. Rep. and S. Doc. accordingly.\n\nE. Congressional Debates\n\nThe reference begins with the volume of Congressional Record (Cong. Rec.), or, for debates before 1873, the Annals of the Congress of the United States (Annals of Cong.), the Register of Debates (Reg. Deb.), or the Congressional Globe (Cong. Globe) where debates are published by the government. The page number and date follow.\n\n112 Cong. Rec. 16 (1996).\n\nF. State Laws and Municipal Ordinances\n\nTitles for state codes are set in roman type, and the date refers to the year the current code was published. These will vary slightly state to state.\n\nWis. Stat. § 36.09(3) 2015\n\nG. Presidential Documents\n\nProclamations, executive orders, vetoes, and addresses are published in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc.) and in the Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States (Pub. Papers). Proclamations and executive orders are also published in the Federal Register (Fed. Reg.) and title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.).\n\nProclamation No. 5142, 49 Fed. Reg. 341 (1984).\n\nH. Treaties\n\nGive the full name, in roman type, and the parties that signed the treaty after, separated by a comma. After the parties are given, provide the exact date the treaty was signed, and the volume and treaty number along with the reporter name. Before the 1950s, US treaties were published unofficially in the Treaty Series (T.S.) or the Executive Agreement Series (E.A.S.). After the 1950s, the reporters are the United States Treaties and Other International Agreements (U.S.T.), and the Treaties and Other International Acts Series (T.I.A.S.). International treaties are published in the United Nations Treaty Series (U.N.T.S.), or were published in its predecessor, the League of Nations Treaty Series (L.N.T.S.).\n\nTreaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water, U.S.-U.K.-U.S.S.R., Aug. 5, 1963, 14 U.S.T. 1313.\n\nDatasets, Databases & Analysis Packages\n\nDatabase references should be both modeled on the official citations provided by the database and adapted to APSA style. For example: move the year to match author-date format; if provided a study number, add the study number of the study after the title in parentheses; if given a date of study distribution, use that date as the publication date information; and so on.\n\nEldersveld, Samuel J., John E. Jackson, M. Kent Jennings, Kenneth Lieberthal, Melanie Manion, Michael Oksenberg, Zhefu Chen, Hefeng He, Mingming Shen, Qingkui Xie, Ming Yang, and Fengchun Yang. 1996. Four-County Study of Chinese Local Government and Political Economy, 1990 [computer file] (Study #6805). ICPSR version. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan/ Beijing, China: Beijing University [producers], 1994. Ann Arbor, MI: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research [distributor], 1996.\n\nIf analysis packages are used (e.g., Amelia, a missing data interpolation statistical analysis package), they should be referenced in the text and an explanatory note should attribute the package to its creator.\n\nReference List\n\nReference List\n\n1. General Format\n\nList all references alphabetically by the author’s last name. Alphabetize via a letter-by-letter system (14.65). Single-authored sources precede multiauthored sources beginning with the same last name (14.66). Multiauthored sources with the same name (first and last) of the first author should continue to be alphabetized by the second author’s first name. When a source cannot be alphabetized by the author’s name, alphabetize it by (in descending order): year (oldest to newest), editor’s name, title, or descriptive phrase (14.62). When alphabetizing by article title, an initial article is ignored (14.79). Undated or forthcoming books follow all dated works (15.18).\n\nAvoid the use of ibid., idem, f., ff., op. cit. and loc. cit. (14.34–14.36). While these Latin abbreviations have been used for years in academia, they do not translate well, if at all, to online publication formats. Further, replacing the name in successive references of the same author(s) with three em-dashes (———) is no longer recommended by Chicago. It complicates the digitization process, does not align with online database sorting, and makes the source impractical outside of the context of the reference list (14.67).\n\nWhen citing several sources by the same author, place them in chronological order, with the earliest single-authored source first, followed by multiauthored sources (15.16). When citing multiple sources from by the same author from the same year, references should be alphabetized by title (excluding any initial article), with letters attached to the year (i.e., 2009a; 2009b; 2009c)"
