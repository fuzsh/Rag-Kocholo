If you look at the Comprehensive portion of the premium, that should show how much is attributed to difference in MSRP between the Volvo and the R-Spec. The primary aspect of comprehensive is theft, and damage due to natural disaster, etc.\n\nnextcar\n\nBeen here awhile...\n\n405\n\n1\n\n0\n\nexbmwguy,\n\ni guess SoCal is much more expensive than the twin cities.\n\ni'm paying $2000/yr for genesis and audi Q5.\n\nsame coverage limits and umbrella, but with $1000 deductible.\n\nLooking to update and upgrade your Genesis luxury sport automobile?

What happens if your R-Spec pulls to one side as well? My 2010 pulled and it didn't get resolved until I went to an independent alignment shop and got a 4 wheel laser alignment done (paid for out of my own pocket, of course). My 2012 pulls ever-so- slightly, and I will probably have the same thing done.\n\nI will say that the Genesis is *very* sensitive to the crown on the road. I've been on some roads and felt it pulling one way and been on others and felt it pulling the other way.\n\nDuck2010\n\nGetting familiar with the group...\n\n94\n\n0\n\n0\n\nAlabama\n\nDuck, just one question though.

Some tires are hard and give great gas mileage but are noisy and exhibit a significant amount of tire pull. Tires that are more sensitive to pull will be very sensitive to slight camber variances as well as road imperfections.\n\nRead this thread for my experience with my new tires"
