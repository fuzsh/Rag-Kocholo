Isolated from the rest of what was one of the world’s most reclusive countries, its decaying buildings and bunkers are now overgrown with vegetation.\n\nAbout 300 miles (480 kilometers) north, two bombed tower blocks overlook a major boulevard in Belgrade. Once the headquarters of former Yugoslavia’s Defense Ministry, they were hit by NATO missiles in 1999, their skeletal remains now part of sightseeing tours in the Serbian capital."
