        "text": "There will never be another album like Merriweather Post Pavilion—and that’s not just because it singularly pairs scrambled electronics and booming basslines with lyrics about taking your kids to the park. Ten years later, Animal Collective’s eighth full-length remains isolated in a strange way, sitting between a number of cultural beginnings and endings.\n\nWithin the context of the group’s career, Merriweather’s tactile electronic pop heralded the creative culmination of a decade’s worth of output that was both shocking and logical—a profile-raising moment that still stands as wholly unrepresentative of what was to come. In the broader scope of indie music, the album marked the mainstream arrival of the weird and wooly sounds bubbling up in late-2000s Brooklyn, but it also represented the last time a band as genuinely far out as Animal Collective would break through to a level of collective pop consciousness. Their closest torchbearers working in the increasingly crossover-friendly realm of electronic music—people like Oneohtrix Point Never, Arca, and SOPHIE—or spiritual kin including Ariel Pink and John Maus, have not achieved the same type of mass consumption. When it comes to 2000s indie, Merriweather stands as the era’s alpha and omega, a diamond-cut reflection of the era’s eccentricities, seemingly impossible to replicate in form or format.\n\nReleased in the first week of 2009, Merriweather was the capper for Animal Collective’s most prolific and impressive period—eight albums in nine years, with each release expanding the band’s avant-leaning sound along with their fanbase. Their 2000s run remains nearly unmatched in indie’s experimental and overground corners alike, a steady rise to prominence aided by the pre-algorithm era of tastemaking guided by the prominence of MP3 blogs and online music publications. From the raw noise bursts and static lullabies of 2000’s Spirit They’re Gone, Spirit They’ve Vanished all the way through to Merriweather, Animal Collective’s sonic trajectory resembled an incidental push toward openness as they retained their more peculiar stylistic peccadilloes.\n\nLeading up to Merriweather, the band’s 2007 album Strawberry Jam offered a distillation of the potentially off-putting elements that coated Animal Collective’s previous albums like thick moss, as Dave Portner (Avey Tare), Noah Lennox (Panda Bear), Brian Weitz (Geologist), and Josh Dibb (Deakin) added a newfound romanticism to their sonic brew. But very little on Strawberry Jam gestured toward the sonic leap the band was primed to make on Merriweather Post Pavilion. Instead, Merriweather’s sample-layered approach drew direct inspiration from another 2007 benchmark within the greater Animal Collective universe: Lennox’s third album as Panda Bear, Person Pitch, a collagist classic of sidelong Beach Boys-isms and kitchen-sink sonics that sits firmly in the sampledelic canon alongside musical milestones ranging from Beastie Boys’ Paul’s Boutique to the Avalanches’ Since I Left You. “One was an evolution of the other,” Lennox told The Quietus in 2012 about the connection between Person Pitch and Merriweather, and the latter indeed resembles a motion-smoothed remaster of the former’s gorgeously cluttered tableau.\n\nWritten and recorded by Lennox, Weitz, and Portner, Merriweather’s genesis was as much by necessity as it was the product of taking creative cues from their past work. After Dibb chose to take a break from the band after recording Strawberry Jam, the remaining three members were faced with following a guitar-heavy album—that was also their most successful release to date—without the member that fans thought of as the band’s guitarist.\n\nShifting lineups from album-to-album was far from new territory for Animal Collective; several of the group’s early releases, including the watershed Sung Tongs, only featured Lennox and Portner. But then, the tour that followed Strawberry Jam’s release clearly felt different from previous outings, during which the band built a fan-cherished reputation for testing out embryonic drafts of new material that could undergo drastic changes before they were finally recorded. In contrast, the Merriweather material sounded shockingly fully-formed in concert an entire year before it would be released, suggesting that the songs were undergoing a perfectionist fine-tuning rather than being figured out onstage.\n\nIndeed, despite the expensive-sounding intricacy of the finished product, everything about Merriweather practically screams “live”—from the titular reference to the outdoor venue near Baltimore that the band would eventually perform at in 2011, to the decision to record by setting up PA systems in producer Ben H. Allen’s Mississippi studio to capture an in-concert feel. The resulting iconography produced by these buzz-building gigs—Animal Collective as a trio, keening and vibing behind a sparse sampler setup—was fully reflected in the Apple-commercial-esque video treatment for “My Girls.” And the proliferation of Animal Collective live recordings through message boards and torrent services undoubtedly aided in the fever pitch of anticipation that accompanied Merriweather’s release.\n\nIronically, the same file-sharing forces that contributed to the hype surrounding Merriweather also stood as its biggest threat. Throughout the 2000s, albums big and small leaked like crazy, tapering off near the end of the decade with a series of piracy-drubbing stings and arrests. The ultra-early leaks that besieged Person Pitch and Strawberry Jam’s rollouts were a palpable concern during the Merriweather era; the mere presence of smartphones and computers were verboten in Allen’s studio, but the internet nevertheless persisted.\n\nIn November 2008, a couple of months before Merriweather’s release, a French music podcast unwittingly leaked album closer “Brother Sport” by including it in their broadcast, with Grizzly Bear frontman Ed Droste linking to the stream on his band’s blog. British anti-piracy company Web Sheriff—hired by Animal Collective’s label Domino to combat imminent leaks—was on the case, forcing Grizzly Bear to post an apology for the infraction. When a leaked version of Merriweather made it onto the internet in full during the 2008 holiday season, approximately nine days before its official release, the album’s Wikipedia page was briefly edited to refer to the leak as “a Christmas gift to the world.”\n\nIt quickly became clear that the anticipation was justified. Upon release, Merriweather was met with nearly unanimous critical praise. Die-hard fans may have their own personal faves, but Merriweather is inarguably Animal Collective’s most purely listenable release, as lovely as a babbling brook with trippy textures befitting the album’s organically psychedelic, Magic Eye-style cover art. The band’s penchant for slow builds and hallucinatory repetition is present throughout but, recast through the lens of dance music, their stridency comes off as toothsome instead of grating. From the Frankie Knuckles-interpolating loop that runs through “My Girls” to the intense techno pulse of “Summertime Clothes,” Merriweather practically sounds like sticky, glistening candy—sweet and sharp, with a taste that lingers long after the last bit’s melted away.\n\nLyrically, Merriweather represents Animal Collective achieving peak clarity and effectiveness—no small feat for a band previously inclined to hoot and holler about mildewed rice and “inky periods” that “drip from your mailbox.” There’s Lennox’s affective ruminations on family, protection, and the shimmering beauty that can accompany daily life: Along with the fatherly reflections found on “Daily Routine,” the ebullient “Brother Sport” reflects on the death of Lennox’s own dad, as he offers prescriptive advice to his brother over whirligig synths: “I know it sucks that daddy’s done/But try to think of what you want.”\n\nPortner’s contributions are no less striking, despite a previously displayed predilection for obfuscation so strong that he once released an entire album of backwards-tracked gibberish. He lustily praises trash-cluttered streets and late-night eating on “Summertime Clothes” and embraces his own form of emotional clarity over the hectic climax of “Lion in a Coma,” effectively encapsulating the millennial drift that’s since hovered over the generation that came of age with Merriweather in hand: “Sometimes I’m well to do/But I don’t know what to do/Sometimes I don’t agree/With my thoughts on being free.”\n\nAnimal Collective’s heightened accessibility couldn’t have arrived at a more narratively fitting time. Merriweather’s top-of-the-year release kicked off a trio of 2009 records from NYC-affiliated, impressionistic-leaning indie acts breaking through to bigger audiences. Four months later, Grizzly Bear’s Veckatimest came out after a year of buzzy live previews of new material not unlike Animal Collective’s pre-Merriweather gigs, opening up their previously hermetic sound by introducing knotty chamber-pop affectations to their style. Dirty Projectors’ Bitte Orca followed in June, the poppiest statement yet from avant-pop shapeshifter Dave Longstreth’s long-running project that arrived on the heels of the groove-adjacent single “Stillness Is the Move,” which predicted the R&B fixation that would come to dominate the following decade of indie music.\n\nAt turns rigid, fussy, and inviting, both Veckatimest and Bitte Orca didn’t quite possess the beatific and colorful attitude splayed across Merriweather’s framework. Grouped together, however, the three records represented something of a high-water mark of critical and commercial visibility for the baroque sounds of late-2000s indie. By the end of the year, Solange would offer her own cover of “Stillness Is the Move,” and Beyoncé and Jay-Z were seen attending a Grizzly Bear concert at Brooklyn’s Williamsburg Waterfront. “What the indie rock movement is doing right now is very inspiring,” Jay later told MTV.\n\nFrom there, however, the three bands’ paths diverged. Over the following decade, Grizzly Bear transformed into a proper major-label rock band with a relatively streamlined sound; along with Dirty Projectors’ dalliances in country and warped millennial pop, Longstreth would collaborate with big-deal pop stars ranging from Solange to Rihanna and Kanye West. For their part, Animal Collective seized on this momentum with the Fall Be Kind EP near the end of 2009, pulling off the very Animal Collective-y coup of being the first act to officially license a Grateful Dead sample, for the record’s centerpiece, “What Would I Want? Sky.”\n\nAnimal Collective’s methods of capitalizing on their breakthrough moment were far from the blockbuster soundtrack placements and high-profile syncs that have typically accompanied such tipping points. (To wit: According to then-manager Brian DeRan, the band turned down offers to license music for commercials from Pizza Hut and Volkswagen during this time period.) They followed Merriweather with a hallucinatory, questionably watchable “visual album” and two divisive, abrasive full-lengths. They debuted a new album to the world by airing it over airport speakers for an entire day. They played Bonnaroo accompanied by the guy from Police Academy that made all the silly noises. They made another film, without Panda Bear but with a few scientists, about coral reefs.\n\nApart from the band’s decision to perform more traditional live sets consisting of previously released material—as captured on the fine 2015 document Live at 9:30—to this day Animal Collective have continued to embrace their own eccentricities while maintaining the same fervent, nerdy audience they enjoyed pre-Merriweather. The notion of an experimental-leaning band essentially refusing to follow up their most accessible work with further strides in that direction isn’t new—but given the increasing infeasibility for indie acts to make a decent living off of their work, Animal Collective’s insistence on sticking to their oddness instead of seeking greater commercial glories remains quixotically impressive.\n\nWhat’s slightly more surprising is Merriweather’s own lack of projected influence on indie at large. Even though chillwave, the electronic pop sub-genre borne out of the bedroom-recording movement of the early 2010s, is often attributed to Merriweather’s influence, its practitioners’ taste for hazy atmospherics and nostalgia-evoking reference points hews way closer to Person Pitch’s warped aesthetic than Merriweather’s high-gloss sheen. During much of the 2000s, acts that liberally borrowed from Animal Collective’s aesthetic were everywhere, from the electric abstractions of indie rockers Nurses to the off-kilter folk of acts like Our Brother the Native and Le Loup. But going into the 2010s, such acts simply stopped popping up, as much an acknowledgement of Merriweather’s unbeatablity as a signal of a new cultural focus taking hold in indie.\n\nEven the level of mass excitement that led up to Merriweather’s release—a palpable sense of anticipation readily memorable to any aging indie fan who spent the 2000s with the type of high-speed internet access that only their university could provide—has yet to be replicated in the decade since. The collective sway of the internet’s attention is more diffuse, diverse, and ephemeral, and much of the emergent indie trends this decade have drawn from more melodically fertile ground than the defiantly outré sounds that Animal Collective worked in pre-Merriweather.\n\nThese changings of the guard aren’t bad things, they just are—and when it comes to Merriweather, they work in Animal Collective’s favor. The album’s singular mythology speaks to its strange and strangely simple pleasures. Animal Collective chose not to finish the conversation their most successful album started, and no one else even dared to try."
