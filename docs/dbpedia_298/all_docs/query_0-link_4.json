        "text": "So I finished the year of PPV's/big shows (with the exception of ROH as I am completely burned out with that promotion) and about about 60% through TV which I'll be finishing up this month. The plan from here is going to be:\n\nGet a Top 10 for both WWE and TNA from the re-watch pile for 2008.\n\nTV and PPV for TNA/WWE 2009\n\nROH 2008\n\nROH 2009\n\nTop 10's/year for WCW, ECW (00-01), WWE, TNA, and ROH\n\nTry and hammer out a Top 20 for Other US\n\nWho knows after that. I'm going to eventually get a Top 25/decade for each company and maybe a Top 100 for the decade encompassing all US. At this point, with the footage being hard for me to come by, I'll just be working on Lucha/Europe/Japan as I can or as it comes to me.\n\nWWE NO MERCY 2008\n\nMark Henry v. Matt Hardy - ECW Title\n\nPretty good match. Matt works on the left knee during the match which played into the end when Mark went for World Strongest Slam and Hardy punches the knee and hits the twist of fate for the pin.\n\nHHH doing his too cool for school act with Jeff Hardy during an interview\n\nBeth Phoenix v. Candice Michelle - Women's Title\n\nBeth retains in an okay women's match.\n\nKane promo.\n\nKane v. Rey Mysterio - If Rey loses, he has to unmask.\n\nA little too long for my tastes, but nothing really wrong with it. Kane gets DQ'ed for using a chair as Mysterio came off the top rope to the outside with a dive.\n\nWow. A really long segment that really didn't end with any substance. MVP wants to see Vickie, but Show says no. So he goes to the ring saying how great he is and mad because he doesn't get enough PPV time. This brings out Randy Orton saying he's better. This brings out Legacy who punks Orton who leaves. Then they punk MVP and he goes to leave but CM Punk and Kofi come out and say lets go three on three. They run down and pause allowing MVP to get beat down for a few seconds before they go in and clean house. This is where the segment ends. Pretty much a waste of time.\n\nBatista v. JBL - # 1 Contender for World Title\n\nBatista pretty much dominates a short match. JBL gets on the mic after the match and thanks congress and the fans for the bailout and allowing him to keep his money. Cryme Tyme on the TitanTron, takes JBl's limo and all the Divas, plus Sgt. Slaughter out on the town.\n\nUndertaker/Big Show/Vickie Guerrero recap package\n\nBig Show v. Undertaker\n\nBack and forth power moves until Show wins via KO after an exposed turnbuckle shot along with three knockout right hands. Taker sells it all the way to the back.\n\nHardy/HHH video package\n\nJeff Hardy v. HHH - WWE Title\n\nReally good match. A re-watch\n\nArn kisses HHH's ass, Vladimir Koslov gets in HHH's face. Jericho/HBK feud recap video package.\n\nChris Jericho v. Shawn Michaels - Ladder Match, World Title\n\nVery good match.\n\nTNA BOUND FOR GLORY 2008\n\nSonjay Dutt, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Johnny Devine, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Super Eric - Steel Asylum match for # 1 contender to X Title\n\nAnother cluster fuck just like the last match of this type. However, I'd say this one was a little better because of a spot where Shelley tries for a sliced bread # 2 that gets countered into a running Canadian destroyer and the finish with Jay Lethal beating on Dutt with punches as Dutt hangs upside down from the cage top. Also, Johnny Devine nearly kills Jimmy Rave with a botched Jay Driller (\"Devine Intervention\")\n\nCornette/Foley love fest, Beautiful People want blue M&M's and hate Foley's wardrobe. Traci Brooks is the special referee for the next match as Cornette made her \"Knockout Law\" a few weeks ago.\n\nBeautiful People/Cute Kip v. ODB/Rhaka Khan/Rhyno - Knockout Bimbo Brawl\n\nGoofy match, but it was kept short. Khan looked bad.\n\nSo there's been two matches so far and 16 wrestlers have been used along with a special referee. Consequences Creed interview\n\nConsequences Creed v. Sheik Abdul Bashir - X Title Match\n\nBashir wins after holding the ropes after a roll up. Okay match.\n\nFoley telling JB about his HITC match, Kong and Saed come in and say Kong isn't in a good mood. Mick name drops JR, The Rock and Yurple the Clown during this short segment.\n\nSit down interview with Taylor Wilde, Roxxi about the match coming up next between them and Kong.\n\nTaylor Wilde v. Awesome Kong v. Roxxi - Knockout's Title Match\n\nTaylor retains by pinning Roxxi with a German suplex with a bridge. Decent match.\n\nAnother Foley segment with AJ, then Team 3-D. I'm tired of Foley already here in TNA. Cornette comes back allowing Foley to get ready to be the enforcer in the Jarrett/Angle match.\n\nMatt Morgan/Abyss v. LAX v. Team 3-D v. Beer Money - Monster's Ball Match w/ Mongo McMichael as special referee - TNA Tag Titles\n\nHoly shit. I didn't think it was possible for Mongo to be a worse referee than he was a wrestler. Just awful. He took a lot away from the match. Terrible to start, but picked up a bit at the end, however not enough to save it. Enjoyable at times, but Mongo killed it for me. Also, Morgan almost killed Homicide with some sort of botched head scissors into a gonzo bomb. Beer Money retain after pinning Hernandez who was just 3-D'd through a table tacks.\n\nBooker T v. AJ Styles v. Christian Cage\n\nOne of the better triple threat matches I've seen in a while. A re-watch. Booker wins after an axe kick on Christian.\n\nAngle/Jarrett feud recap. Angle says for Jarrett to tell his girls daddy isn't coming home after the PPV. Yeah, good thing to say when the girls mom died. Angle, Jarrett interviews.\n\nKurt Angle v. Jeff Jarrett - Grudge Match, Mick Foley special enforcer\n\nBoth guys worked hard enough for me to give it a re-watch, but what a shitty finish. Jarrett wins after a guitar shot that was preceded be a bunch of bullshit.\n\nSting/Samoa Joe video package\n\nSamoa Joe v. Sting - TNA World Title Match\n\nWho would have thought Kevin Nash could ruin a match? Everyone? You'd be right. God dammit. Sting wins after Nash hits Joe with the bat and a Scorpion Death Drop. Terrible finish which is par for the course with this company. The match itself was very good. I usually don't like brawling in the crowd, which this match did almost 50% of the match, but it worked here. Joe took an insane bump on the concrete stairs and dominated most of the match until the aforementioned shit finish. A re-watch.\n\nWWE Cyber Sunday 2008\n\nRey Mysterio v. Kane - No Holds Barred (voted over Falls Count Anywhere and 2/3 Falls)\n\nDrawn out match but I liked the finishing sequence Rey wins with 619 and splash.\n\nFirst four Divas show off their costumes and ask for a vote. Jericho asks Legacy to take out Batista, they say no. Teddy Long and assistant Tiffany out to announce winner of ECW title shot against Matt Hardy.\n\nMatt Hardy v. Evan Bourne (wins over Mark Henry and Finlay by a large margin) - ECW Title\n\nBourne runs through his entire offense and Hardy eats it most of the match. Hardy wins after the Twist of Fate. Okay sprint.\n\nFour more Divas show off their costumes.\n\nCryme Tyme v. Miz/Morrison (voted over Mickie/Noble v. Regal/Layla and Punk/Kingston v. Rhodes/DiBiase)\n\nAverage PPV tag match. Miz/Morrison win after Morrison hits the Midnight Ride on Shad.\n\nFour more Divas show off their costumes. Khali turns down Jericho when he asks for help with Batista.\n\nSantino v. Honky Tonk Man (voted over Roddy Piper and Goldust)\n\nSantino's pre-match promo was better than anything after it. Match was 100% (bad) comedy and kind of depressing.\n\nLast four Divas show off their costumes. Show/Taker video package.\n\nBig Show v. Undertaker - Last Man Standing Match (voted over Knockout and I Quit matches)\n\nVickie out and botched the result saying I Quit. Wonder if they meant to work the results, but they were the ones that messed up. Counterpoint to No Mercy match as it was nearly the exact same except Taker wins with the Hell's Gate Submission.\n\nJericho tries to change Adamle's mind, but walks away when he gets a text. Mickie James (as Lara Croft) won the Diva's costume contest.\n\nVideo package of HHH/Jeff Hardy/Vladimir Kozlov regarding next match.\n\nHHH v. Jeff Hardy (voted over Vladimir Kozlov and a Triple Threat Match with both) - WWE Title\n\nNot as good as their No Mercy match. Ending was abrupt. Finish was a pedigree in the middle. Commentary say it was off the top rope, but he just pulled him down from the top.\n\nJericho/Batista video package\n\nChris Jericho v. Batista - World Title (Steve Austin special referee - voted over Randy Orton and HBK)\n\nVery good match with a shit overbooked finish. A re-watch.\n\nTNA TURNING POINT 2008\n\nTheme for tonight is Millionaire's Club v. New Blo... err, Main Event Mafia v. TNA Originals.\n\nX Division Elimination Match (Order of Elimination determines Top 10 rankings in the Division)\n\nParticipants: Jay Lethal, Sonjay Dutt, Volador Jr., Jimmy Rave, Petey Williams, Doug Williams, Homicide, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Eric Young, and Consequences Creed.\n\nTypical X sprints. Eric Young and Lethal are the last two with Young winning. Young cuts a promo about how they are young and like being wrestlers\n\nSome skit with Jarrett and Foley with sleeping kids in the background.\n\nAwesome Kong/Raisha Saed v. Taylor Wilde/Roxxi\n\nGood women's tag match.\n\nJarrett talks to Main Event Mafia. Angle calls him a pussy and tells him to grow so \"bawls!\" and leaves. I'm sensing a show with a series of these all night.\n\nSheik Abdul Bashir v. Rhyno - Grudge Match\n\nNobody cared or paid attention to the match because ICP, Scott Hall, Corporal Robinson, etc. showed up at ringside. They weren't acknowledged even when Bashir pushed Corp and spit on them. Rhyno wins with the gore, but looked pissed walking to the back.\n\nMCMG's make fun of Mick Foley during his \"pep talk.\"\n\nMotor City Machine Guns v. Beery Money, Inc. - TNA Tag Titles\n\nGood, entertaining match. A re-watch\n\nBooker T interview. Booker has regressed into some weird hood aristocrat hybrid speech. Kind of Harlem Heat Booker T meets King Booker. Weird.\n\nBooker T v. Christian Cage - Legends Title, If Christian Cage loses, he must join the Main Event Mafia\n\nLegends Title was introduced by Booker T and proclaimed himself first champion. Okay match, but well below last months Triple Threat. Booker wins after reversing a roll up and holding the tights. Stipulation says Cage has to join Main Event Mafia, but we'll see.\n\nAbyss interview and recap of Kurt/Abyss/Jarrett situation\n\nAbyss v. Kurt Angle - Falls Count Anywhere Match\n\nOkay match with Angle winning after knocking Abyss off scaffolding onto Spanish announce table. The ending was a bit too contrived even for pro wrestling.\n\nSamoa Joe interview/Joe v. Nash feud recap\n\nSamoa Joe v. Kevin Nash - Grudge Match\n\nTerrible match. Joe doesn't get pinned after two jack knife power bomb's and multiple shots to an exposed turnbuckle, but he gets pinned a minute after being hit with a low blow. I have a feeling MEM is going 4 and 0.\n\nSting Interview. Sting/AJ feud recap\n\nSting v. AJ Styles - TNA World Title\n\nBattle of the Bible Bangers was an okay match with a flat finish. Styles was on top of the match, but he had to hold off Angle and Booker T so Sting dodges the Pele kick and gets rolled up. MEM wins all of their matches and every one of them to come out and celebrate. Lame.\n\nWWE SURVIVOR SERIES 2008\n\nJeff Hardy found unconscious at his hotel and may not show up.\n\nHBK/Great Khali/Cryme Tyme/Rey Mysterio v. JBL/Kane/Miz/MVP/Morrison - Traditional Survivor Series Match\n\nFirst five eliminations went pretty quick. Second five was slower paced and the match was okay, but nothing great. HBK, Rey, and Khali are the three survivors after HBK last eliminates Morrison with a super kick.\n\nHHH says he'll face Vladimir Koslov to a round of boos.\n\nMichelle McCool/Maryse/Victoria/Natalya/Maria v. Beth Phoenix/Mickie James/Jillian/Candice Michelle/Kelly Kelly - Traditional Survivor Series Match Raw v. Smackdown Divas\n\nGood Diva's Match. Guys were having a ton of fun on commentary.\n\nMatt Hardy talking about Jeff. Big Show/Undertaker video recap.\n\nUndertaker v. Big Show - Casket Match\n\nTaker wins a boring casket match. Hopefully, this is the end of the feud as these matches aren't fun to watch.\n\nComedy with Bellas, Colon's, Charlie Haas, and Boogeyman dressed as Gobbledy Gooker. Orton says he didn't want to be on his Survivor Series Team, he and Cody get into it.\n\nRandy Orton/Cody Rhodes/Mark Henry/Steve Regal/Shelton Benjamin v. Batista/R-Truth/CM Punk/Kofi Kingston/Matt Hardy - Traditional Survivor Series Match\n\nGoes down to 4-on-1 with Batista all alone. Batista kills Shelton and Henry and almost Rhodes but Orton makes a blind tag and hits the RKO for the win. Decent match.\n\nVladimir Koslov interview. JR says Jeff will not be competing before showing the Jeff/HHH video package.\n\nHHH v. Vladimir Koslov - WWE Title\n\nOkay, let me see if I can recap this so one can follow. First, The match sucked and the crowd was telling them so. Vickie Guerrero comes out after a pedigree and excitedly says \"He's here!\" Out comes Edge joining the match well, just because. Then out runs Jeff Hardy with a bandage on the back of his neck and attacks edge them smashes everyone with a chair, except Edge who spears him and then pins HHH. So Edge is champion still married to Vickie and happy with each other even after the years events and it seems as if he was the one who attacked Edge. First Class Shit.\n\nJericho/Cena video recap\n\nChris Jericho v. John Cena - World Title Match\n\nGood match. Cena regains the belt after an Attitude Adjustment. A re-watch.\n\nTNA FINAL RESOLUTION (DECEMBER EDITION) 2008\n\nCute Kip, Sonjay Dutt, Jimmy Rave, Lance Hoyt, Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Homicide, Hernandez, BG James, Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, and Shark Boy - Feast or Fired - 3 title shots, 1 pink slip\n\nJay Lethal, Curry Man, Homicide, and Hernandez all get cases. Couple of cool spots, overall it was just okay. After a long, drawn out process Jay Lethal opens his case to reveal he gets a Tag Title shot. MCMG's pissed because Lethal grabbed the case from them at the last minute. Borash punks Shelley calling him an ass.\n\nSharmell is pushed into the Beautiful People act for tonight and they give an incredibly long interview to talk about it. If they win, they get Booker T's locker room.\n\nSharmell/Beautiful People v. ODB/Roxxi/Taylor Wilde\n\nTaylor reverses a cross body block by Angelina Love for the win. Okay match.\n\nEric Young interview about X Title shot. MCMG's come in and get back at Borash. He tells them where Foley is.\n\nEric Young v. Sheik Abdul Bashir - X Title Match\n\nBest thing on the show so far, but it was just okay. Young wins the belt and a ridiculous angle continues afterwards where the referee hulks up and attacks Bashir until Bashir bloodies him and leaves him laying. He tries to steal the belt, but Cornette and security get it back.\n\nKong/Hemme video. Hemme gets trained by AJ Styles for the match.\n\nAwesome Kong v. Christy Hemme - Knockouts Title Match\n\nThis match + segment was best thing on the show so far. I can't believe I'm saying this. Match was short and a DQ due to Kongtourage interference, but Hemme did a great job and the post fight was entertaining.\n\nAngle interview. Beer Money/Abyss and Morgan video\n\nBeer Money v. Abyss/Morgan - TNA Tag Title Match\n\nYour average tag match with Beer Money retaining after a brass knuckle shot on Abyss.\n\nPretty funny exchange between Mick Foley and the MCMG's. Segment continues in the ring again with good stuff from the guns, this time directed towards Cornette. Suicide debuts and clears the guns from the ring. The a Rhyno interview. Then a Rhyno/Kurt video package.\n\nKurt Angle v. Rhyno - Special Enforcer, Mick Foley. If Kurt wins he gets Jarrett at Genesis in January. If Rhyno wins, Kurt leaves TNA.\n\nBland match. Al Snow of all people is brought in by Kurt to distract Mick Foley allowing Kurt to hit Rhyno with a chair/Angle slam for the win.\n\nLauren backstage with a MEM interview. MEM/Frontline video recap.\n\nSting/Booker T/Scott Steiner/Kevin Nash v. AJ Styles/Samoa Joe/Team 3-D - If TNA Frontline wins, AJ is World Champion. If MEM wins, Sting retains his World Title. - TNA World Title.\n\nI enjoyed when Sting/AJ and Joe/AJ were in, but Team 3-D provide zero entertainment value, Nash is old and brittle, Steiner provides unintentional comedy outside the ring and really nothing more and Booker T has phoned in 95% of his year in TNA thus far. Bad finish to an underwhelming match with a Nash low blow to Samoa Joe and Scorpion Death Drop from Sting for the pin.\n\nWWE ARMAGEDDON 2008\n\nMatt Hardy v. Vladimir Koslov - Non-Title Match (ECW)\n\nFor Koslov being involved, this was okay. He wins with a choke slam/spine buster combination. He's still being billed as undefeated.\n\nEdge/Vickie/Chavo backstage. Vickie makes Chavo go get coffee and denies attacking Jeff Hardy last month. Hornswoggle is backstage hammering Eve (inflatable hammer) and Finlay tells him to stay backstage during his match as he wants him to be safe. IC champion Regal and Layla at ringside for next match.\n\nRey Mysterio v. CM Punk - Final Match of Intercontinental Title # 1 Contender Tournament.\n\nReal fun match. A re-watch. Punk wins with brutal GTS.\n\nEmo Jeff Hardy promo. 20 minutes of JBL/HBK angle where HBK is broke and JBL hires him as an employee. Why this was on PPV and not Raw beats me. Orton/Manu/Rhodes interview regarding Orton v. Batista.\n\nFinlay v. Mark Henry - Belfast Brawl\n\nReally fun match with Henry doing strong man stuff. I enjoyed it. Finlay wins with shillelagh shot A re-watch.\n\nDivas X-mas party with BoogeyMan, Goldust, Santino, IRS, Jesse, Festus and assorted silliness. Kennedy says drink responsibly and to buy his DVD Behind Enemy Lines.\n\nOrton/Batista history video package.\n\nRandy Orton v. Batista\n\nDecent match, but it didn't quite get me to the point where I think it deserves a re-watch. Batista wins with the Batista bomb.\n\nCena/Jericho feud recap.\n\nMickie James/Kelly Kelly/Maria/Michelle McCool v. Maryse/Jillian/Victoria/Natalya - Santa's Little Helpers 8 Diva Tag Match\n\nEye candy match. McCool blind tags in and hits the Styles clash for the win. Khali out wanting to kiss Divas (Kiss Cam), but nobody wants to. Out comes Mae Young and they make out.\n\nAnother Cena/Jericho recap video.\n\nChris Jericho v. John Cena - World Title Match\n\nReally good match. A re-watch. Cena retains with STFU.\n\nTriple Threat video recap.\n\nHHH v. Jeff Hardy v. Edge - WWE Title\n\nCool that Hardy won the title, good match but not one that would hold up in a re-watch."
