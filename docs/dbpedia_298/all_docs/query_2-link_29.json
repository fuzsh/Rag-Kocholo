        "text": "Peter Gabriel: The Making of \"i/o\"\n\nIn August 2002 Peter Gabriel announced that he would be releasing another new album soon after UP. He mentioned that this work could come out some 18 months after UP. What followed were a lenthy two-year Growing Up tour and a HIT album. At the end of 2005 there were even some hints at a possible Genesis reunion. And when Genesis toured without Gabriel in 2007, some expected a new Gabriel album soon. Gabriel himself went on tour as well and more or less toured every year until 2016 - without a new album. The story is neverending, but might be ending in 2023. We will keep adding the most recent news of the development of the album – however long that will take …\n\nAdditional information about Peter Gabriel's involvement in various songs can also be found in our Peter Gabriel Recording Compendium.\n\nFirst, a little FAQ\n\n1) Will there be a physical album?\n\nYes!\n\n2) When will the complete album be released?\n\nPeter has decided to release the track on each full moon in 2023, that makes 13 full moons. In the meantime we learned that the album will have 12 tracks. It's unlikely the album will be released long before this cycle is completed, which would be the end of November then.\n\nUPDATE 13 October: The album will be released in December.\n\nPeter also mentioned there might be a full moon surplus and it's also possible he will continue to release tracks next year.\n\n3) What tracks will be on the album?\n\nThere will be 12 tracks on i/o\n\n01 Panopticom\n\n02 Playing For Time\n\n03 The Court\n\n04 Four Kinds Of Horses\n\n05 i/o\n\n06 Love Can Heal\n\n07 Road To Joy\n\n08 So Much\n\n09 Olive Tree\n\n10 This Is Home\n\n11 And Still\n\n12 Live And Let Live\n\nthe tracks What Lies Ahead and Put The Bucket Down, which is listed in Copyright databases, are leftovers. There's no further info about what will happen with those at the moment.\n\nThere are two other tracks that are being discussed: Lost And Found and Path Of Fortune. The first one was mentioned by the interviewer in the Uncut special earlier this year (and was added o copyright databases a while ago) and Path Of Fortune was found on sheet music in one of the full moon videos. It could also be a working title for Road To Joy, as this one didn't have proper lyrics when recorded with the band.\n\nAnd now, the most recent developments:\n\nThe i/o cover (14 October 2023)\n\nThis is the cover artwork, by Nadav Kander:\n\nNew tour trailer hints album release announcement (08 September 2023)\n\nA new trailer, which was published a day before the start of the North American leg of i/o The Tour, hints that an album announcement can't be too far away. \"i/o coming soon\" is what they say towards the end of the trailer. This could mean we can expect the album by the end of November, possibly together with the last full moon track...\n\ni/o Tracklist revealed (29 July 2023)\n\nDue to the album presentation during the WOMAD festival we now know the tracklist:\n\n01 Panopticom\n\n02 Playing For Time\n\n03 The Court\n\n04 Four Kinds Of Horses\n\n05 i/o\n\n06 Love Can Heal\n\n07 Road To Joy\n\n08 So Much\n\n09 Olive Tree\n\n10 This Is Home\n\n11 And Still\n\n12 Live And Let Live\n\nThere is no release announcement yet. More info can be found in this news item.\n\nWOMAD album listening preview (23 July 2023)\n\nTour starts, lots of new songs revealed (20 May 2023)\n\nPeter has started his tour in Krakow and played Verona today. The band has performed 12 (!) new songs, so we saw 7 tracks that have not been released yet: Olive Tree, This Is Home, Love Can Heal, Road To Joy, And Still, What Lies Ahead and Live And Let Live. Also, on one of Tony Levin's photo, we can see the track So Much as an option. Whether or not all tracks will be on the final album remains unclear.\n\nFour Kinds Of Horses released and tour rehearsals (6 May 2023)\n\nTracks for i/o - what we know right now (7 April 2023)\n\ni/o (the track) released - confusion about album release date (6 April 2023)\n\ni/o gets title track (4 April 2023)\n\nPeter Gabriel talks about i/o in Uncut Feature (March 2023)\n\nIn-Side ATMOS Mix (January 28, 2023)\n\nFull Moon and New Moon release cycles (January 21, 2023)\n\nFirst single tomorrow (January 5, 2023)\n\nIn New Zealand at noon it was already 6th January and the new single Panopticom was available. It is apparently a different mix than the album version. From midnight you can hear and download the song everywhere. See also our news article with full credits here.\n\nFirst snippets of new material in new Full Moon video (8 December 2022)\n\nPeter has published a new full moon video today. In this video, you can hear snippets from one of the new tracks:\n\ni/o The Tour announced - album later (8 November 2022)\n\nPeter Gabriel has announced a European tour for May and June. North American dates will follow in late summer and autumn. The image shows a sample of ticket designs in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nThe new album title has also been revealed and it's at least a little surprise it's still i/o. There is no release date yet, but it comes closer. It's likely that this article, which has been running and been updated for more than 20 years, will finally be concluded in the forseeable future.\n\nNew design fragments - Full Moon announcement? (7 November 2022)\n\nFirst there were hints in his newsletter that an announcement would follow at the full moon - then there were first snippets of the possible album design (on his website and social media) later that evening, which indeed suggests that his new album really is called I/O.\n\nPeter promotes his newsletter (2 November 2022)\n\nKing Crimson manager hints Levin's tour plans with Gabriel (July 2022)\n\nPeter Gabriel: Silver Clef Awards interview (July 2022)\n\nIn a little interview in the frame of the Silver Clef Award show, Peter Gabriel said that final touches for the new album are afoot (September, apparently ...)\n\nManu Katche: Tour starts in Europe in May (June 2022)\n\nIn an interview with L'Illustré, Katché confirms that the Gabriel tour he mentioned back in March will start in Europe in May 2023 before heading to the US.\n\nManu Katche confirms tour plans, new album still 2022? (March 2022)\n\nPeter Gabriel's drummer Manu Katché has confirmed in an interview that the album will still be released at the end of 2022. In addition, a world tour is planned for 2023. This complements the statements of Tony Levin a few weeks earlier, who spoke of intensive work on the new songs.\n\nPeter Gabriel: new album is \"closer than you think\" (October 2021)\n\nPeter Gabriel reveals work on new track: So Much(March 2020)\n\nPeter Gabriel has reacted to an article in The Times and has revealed he is currently working on a song about getting older, called So Much. Read the full story in our news item here.\n\nBBC Radio 6 interview - 11th April 2019\n\nTo promote his new film song LP Rated PG (see here), Peter Gabriel was interviewed on BBC Radio 6, which was aired yesterday.\n\nPeter said about taking a longer break in recent years: \"...my wife was ill for a while, so I'd slowed down and being a carer a good while, but now I'm very happy to say she's doing very well, so I'm getting back into music making and really loving it.\"\n\nAbout the kind of stuff he is currently working on: \"...and there's is about 50 ideas I'm working on - working in my usual snails pace – but there will be something coming out soon and all this time I had been working on new stuff so there should be ... I mean there is stuff that comes through for films, like the Snowden song and then you have Down To Earth, and there was a film about religion etc.\"\n\nAbout the style and atmosphere of the new material: \"Well I think that hose two songs, Show Yourself and the Snowden one, are slightly over direction but there's a wide bunch in there, so it depends on what makes the final cut. And I'm also trying to do some simple piano versions of things which I don't know being enough to make a whole record or not, but that's something I'm looking at.\"\n\nIn the meantime, This Is Party Man was released as a digital single, available on platforms such as iTunes or amazonUK.\n\nRated PG - film songs on one LP - February 2019\n\nPossible new album tracks - 25th June 2018\n\nOk, let's check what could be on the new album:\n\nThere are several tracks that were discussed in the past (see right collum), but most of them have most likely been taken off the list over time. Curtains was used for a video game, Courage was released as a digital single, so was I'm Amazing. Bol and Why Don't You Show Yourself were both used for films, but were not released on the soundtracks. These tracks may still be on the list (I Grieve was also on UP, despite its inclusion on the City Of Angels soundtrack years earlier), but we think it's not very realistic to expect them to be included on the new album. Same applies to The Veil and even Down To Earth.\n\nSo, what do we have? Peter performed Love Can Heal on the Rock Paper Scissors Tour, they also rehearsed the track Rock Paper Scissors and another one, Radio Everyone. All three will most likely be on the album. Another track, Here Comes Love, was revealed by the man himself a few years ago, but that could also be a working title, maybe for Love Can Heal? We don't know.\n\nIn 2014, Peter spoke about an organic dance record, which would make the inclusion of Love Can Heal less likely, as it is a ballad / slow track.\n\nPeter Gabriel hints finishing touches are being made for new album - 3rd March 2018\n\nOn his Facebook page, Peter Gabriel hints that his now album may finally be complete. \" \"Comping\" is usually a term for final mixing / editing stages. Let's hope there'll be something soon\n\nPeter Gabriel releases new track The Veil - 8th September 2016\n\nOne of the tracks on the rehearsal list of the recent tour, The Veil, will be released digitally tomorrow. The track appears in the movie Snowden but is not part of the soundtrack.\n\nFour new tracks rehearsed? - August 2016\n\nIt looks like Peter Gabriel has rehearsed four new tracks for the Rock Paper Scissors tour with Sting. The tour programme indicates that besides Love Can Heal, which was played every night, Peter also rehearsed the tracks The Veil, Radio Everywhere and Rock Paper Scissors. All tracks could be possible candidates for I/O - or whatever it will be called.\n\nPeter Gabriel releases new song I'm Amazing - 17th June 2016\n\nPeter Gabriel has caused quite an excitement when posting a short promo video without sound on 16th June 2016. Later that day, it became clear it is not the start of a campaign for his new album, but a release of a new song called I'm Amazing, which was inspired by the life and struggles of Muhammad Ali and Peter thought it was an appropriate time to release it, since the track was written and recorded years ago. Details can be found here. It's not very likely the track will appear on the new album - but who knows ...\n\nA new track called Here Comes Love? - 28th October 2014\n\nToday, Peter Gabriel has revealed a little detail on his Facebook page. The posting contains information about him being back in the studio, but more interestingly, a track name is revealed. Here Comes Love might be a song for the new album. At the same time, it indicates he was working on \"version 18\" of that song. So ...\n\nGabriel hints new album might not be called I/O - October 2014\n\nIn a recent interview with the american Rolling Stone magazine, Peter Gabriel revealed interesting stuff about his new album. It looks like he is working on \"happy stuff\" and recently he wrote songs that might end up on an \"organic dance record\". When asked if that was for I/O, he said he wasn't sure it will still be called I/O. On the other hand, since he just wrote new songs, that \"go in the right direction\", it looks like the whole I/O album is in question and he may be working on something else instead. But, in case of Peter, you never know until September ...\n\nNew interview about I/O- December 2013\n\nNot only , but who cares? At the moment, there are 20 songs that Peter considers for I/O, he also wants to write further songs after christmas. Also, he'd like to rearrange some of the tracks already written. And when will I/O come out? ... this time it's March - no year has been mentioned. The source for this information is available in German here.\n\nRumours, rumours ... - September 2013\n\nHe's on tour and so more rumours appear. Further shows are planned for 2014 and some say there will also be a new rock album in 2014. An interesting detail: It looks like Peter is planning to release the So-outtake Courage as a single later this year. And he may have been working on that track as well.\n\nPeter mentions I/O in Rolling Stone interview – September 2012\n\nShortly before they start rehearsing for the Back To Front tour 2012, Peter was interviewed by american Rolling Stone magazine. Peter mentiones I/O and confirmes that the title is still there and that it could be still called I/O. Nevertheless, a release has been put back at least until 2014, since Peter will take a year off in 2013. Read the full interview here.\n\nSagrada and Courage not on I/O - but on So25– August 2012\n\nAmong the possible tracks for the next studio album (maybe called) I/O, Sagrada and Courage have been mentioned and rumoured every now and then. Now we can be sure that they will not be on the album, since they are now part of the So25 Deluxe Boxset (find all information about So25 in our website special here). This also confirms that both tracks have been recorded during the So-sessions.\n\nPeter works on new songs Songs / new songs live 2012? - May 2012\n\nIn recent interviews and his most recent Moonclub-Video, Peter confirms that he he is working on new songs (finally) and it looks like yet another creative frame and restrictions he has created. A photo was posted on Twitter from his studio and we can conclude that he is working on something rhythmical. Also, Peter says that he wants to play some new songs during his upcoming Back To Front tour!\n\nUS-Tour done - but further New Blood shows announced - June 2011\n\nDespite recent announcements, Peter says that he will be doing more New Blood shows, South America seems pretty much planned, Australia might be on the bill as well. It doesn't look like he's really willing to work on a new album ...\n\nNew Blood era is nearing its end - chance for I/O? - spring 2011\n\nPeter said after the filming was done for the 3D-Blu-ray in London that he will put the New Blood cycle to rest after the summer shows in North America. After that, Peter wants to concentrate on new songs for his next rock record. Really ?\n\nNew Blood tour or I/O? – Spring 2011\n\nInitially planned as a one off, Peter continues to tour with the New Blood concept. Although he seems willing to work on new songs, he keeps himselft busy with touring.\n\nAnother Tongue / Scratch My Back out in 2009? – July 2009\n\nPeter reports via moonclub video from the Air studios where they are putting the finishing touches to Scratch My Back. He insinuated that the album could be released in 2009. At his gig at Charlton Park on July 25 he played The Boy In The Bubble and The Book Of Love, two songs that are supposed to be on Scratch My Back. More information about Scratch My Back here.\n\nAnother Tongue / Scratch My Back – December 2008\n\nGabriel wants to push on his cover album project, which will, according to current information, consist of two albums. One album has other artists cover Gabriel’s songs, while Gabriel covers their songs on the other album. Work on his new album I/O has therefore been put on hold again.\n\nTour in South America! – December 2008\n\nRumours that Peter Gabriel will play some shows in South America in 2009 have turned out to be true. There are also rumours that he may perform some new songs.\n\nNew song snippet in the Moon Club – February 03, 2007\n\nPeter presents a new snippet of a song in the current Full Moon Club video (02/07). The soundbite sounds very alternative and ambitious, and by no means minimalistic or like a normal song as one could have surmised judging by previous statements about I/O. The fragment is a new development of the sound. Whether the song will be included in I/O is uncertain; it is unlikely that it will be on Big Blue Ball.\n\nBig Blue Ball or I/O without a record contract? – January 23, 2007\n\nAccording to a report in British magazine Uncut the new Gabriel album, Big Blue Ball or I/O, could be released in North America without the support of a major record company. It seems as if Gabriel wanted to release the album with Ingenious Media. These plans do not cover Europe as Gabriel still has a valid contract with EMI/Virgin there.\n\nNew album in 2007? – November 08, 2006\n\nThe Genesis press conference about the small reunion of all things brings the attention back to Peter’s new album. When asked about Peter’s involvement Mike Rutherford explained that Peter did not have the time because he would be releasing a new album in spring and might tour at the same time as Genesis. An album release in spring is to be doubted, though.\n\nBig Blue Ball before I/O? – August/September 2006\n\nThe online version of the American Billboad magazine reports that EMI will release the 15-year-old project Big Blue Ball this year. In July Gabriel had introduced a song called Whole Thing/Whole World from the project in his Moon Club video. There were no plans for a tour, but Gabriel added that further projects of that style were possible depending on the success of Big Blue Ball. The upshot of this is that I/O is delayed and will be released late in 2007 at the earliest. Update: EMI has confirmed that Big Blue Ball will not be released in 2006.\n\nI/O more minimalistic than Up? – November 2005\n\nPeter Gabriel talks about I/O in Rolling Stone. It will be revolving around birth, death and the sex in between, so it is not too far away from Up. Gabriel reveals that he is recording the songs with a minimal crew that includes Richard Chapell and Ged Lynch, and also that he is producing the sessions himself. Peter thinks it possible that he presents the songs live before he finishes them in the studio. Such a putative tour would see him accompanied only by a bassist and a percussionist. Whatever influence that has on the release date of I/O…\n\nP.O.V. DVD before I/O? – October 2005\n\nThe bonus material of the upcoming DVD Still Growing Up … Live And Unwrapped features No Self Control, filmed at the This Way Up tour. It is a teaser for the DVD version of P.O.V., a film that had been available only on video before. Since Peter once said he planned only one release per year this may have repercussions on the release of I/O.\n\nGabriel announces details about I/O songs – July 2005\n\nUK magazine Mojo has an article about the current state of the album. Gabriel announces that a new version of Curtains will be recorded for I/O. Further songs include Wild (which is making the rounds as an instrumental), Amazing and Silver Screen. The album will come out “when it is finished, however long that is going to take”, said Peter. He will spend the rest of the year working on I/O.\n\nGabriel to focus on I/O – May 2005\n\nOn a promotional appearance for the 46664 gig in Tromso Peter explained that he had not planned any further live performances this year, as he wants to focus on his new studio album I/O.\n\nFire in Real World Studios – April 2005\n\nDuring the work on his new album a fire broke out in the RealWorld studios and interrupted the work process. Peter announced this in his current Full Moon Club video (available on Peter Gabriel’s homepage).\n\nNew recording of Curtains on I/O? – November 01, 2004\n\nPeter is honored with the Music Industry Trust Award. Guests at the ceremony included Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Richard Macphail. A promo double CD set was given out to the guests. One was a Gabriel CD and the other a Music Inspiration CD. The former includes a new recording of Curtains; it is rumoured that Gabriel has recorded a (this?) new version for I/O.\n\nNew song Baby Man introduced live – May 15, 2004\n\nPeter premiered the new song Baby Man in Budapest. Baby Man is likely to be on I/O. After this, Baby Man was also played in Karlsruhe, Zurich, Brussels, Sheffield, Newcastle, Glasgow, London and Bregenz.
