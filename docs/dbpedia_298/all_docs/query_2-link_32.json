        "text": "American musician and record producer Steve Albini died from a heart attack age 61. He was the founder, owner and principal engineer at Electrical Audio, a recording studio complex in Chicago. It has been estimated that he worked on several thousand records over his career. He worked with acts such as Nirvana, Pixies, Bush, the Breeders, PJ Harvey, the Jesus Lizard, and former Led Zeppelin members Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nAn album sleeve signed by all four members of Led Zeppelin sold for £15,000 ($19,000) at auction, despite not containing the actual record. The cardboard sleeve of the 1973 album Houses Of The Holy was only estimated to sell for between £1,200 and £1,800. Items signed by all band members are rare, due to drummer John Bonham's 1980 death and the band's subsequent split. The seller acquired the autographs during a chance encounter at Gatwick Airport in 1977.\n\nEnglish music manager Richard Cole died age 75. He is most known for having been the tour manager of Led Zeppelin from 1968 to 1980. He was the author of the book called Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored.\n\nA Chinese study called for a publicity programme that could enhance public awareness of the negative impact of listening to fast music when driving. The study claimed that drivers should keep music below 120 beats per minute saying that a track like ’American Idiot’ by Green Day - at 189 beats per minute - was a dangerous song to listen to when driving and Stairway To Heaven by Led Zeppelin was a safe song at 63 beats per minute.\n\nMembers of Korn, Tool, Judas Priest, Linkin Park and several other bands signed a brief in support of Led Zeppelin, whose years-long copyright case over the opening guitar riff of 'Stairway To Heaven' was set to return to court. In response to the court order, 123 music-makers filed an amicus brief, aiming to \"elucidate the effect of the panel’s decision… on all songwriters, composers, musicians and producers in the United States and around the world\". The lawsuit was originally filed in 2014 by the estate of the late Randy California, the singer/guitarist of Spirit and the composer of ‘Taurus’.\n\nAn 11-judge panel from the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals decided to review its decision on whether Led Zeppelin plagiarized 'Stairway To Heaven' from the opening guitar riff on Spirit’s 1968 track 'Taurus'. In June 2016, a Los Angeles jury ruled that Zeppelin were not guilty of any copyright infringement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge overseeing Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven' trial ruled against the band and their publishing company's attempts to recoup nearly $800,000 in legal fees. While a federal jury determined that Led Zeppelin were not guilty of plagiarizing Spirit's 'Taurus' in a copyright infringement trial, judge R. Gary Klausner ruled that, since the lawsuit itself was not frivolous and meritless, the estate of Spirit guitarist Randy (California) Wolfe and their attorney Francis Malofiy were not obligated to repay the defendants' legal fees.\n\nA US jury concluded that Led Zeppelin did not copy the opening chords of 'Stairway To Heaven' from the US band Spirit, saying the riff Led Zeppelin was accused of taking from Spirit's 1967 song 'Taurus' \"was not intrinsically similar\" to Stairway's opening. During the trial, defence lawyers argued the chord progression in question was very common and had been in use for more than 300 years.\n\nLed Zeppelin singer Robert Plant told a court hearing the 'Stairway To Heaven' copyright dispute that he had a dim memory of the time the song was written. Plant also said he could not remember meeting the band Spirit, who claimed the band stole their guitar riff for Stairway to Heaven in the 1970s. \"I don't have a recollection of almost anyone I've hung out with,\" Plant said, causing roars of laughter in the court. The case was brought on behalf of Spirit's late guitarist, Randy Wolfe. His estate claimed the opening riff of the 1968 song Taurus is fundamentally the same as the iconic opening bars of Stairway to Heaven.\n\nLawyers for Led Zeppelin asked a judge to throw out a case accusing the band of stealing the riff for 'Stairway To Heaven'. Singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and Warner Music argued that the claimants had failed to make their case after three days of testimony. The band were accused of basing Stairway on the 1968 Spirit song, 'Taurus'.\n\nLed Zeppelin's guitarist Jimmy Page denied stealing the riff to 'Stairway To Heaven' when he took the stand at a copyright trial in the US. The band were accused of lifting the opening guitar line from 'Taurus', a 1968 track by the band Spirit. Page testified that he had never heard the song until people started posting comparisons online a few years ago. Page admitted to owning several Spirit albums, but only remembered buying two of them, neither of which contained Taurus. Under questioning, he conceded that he did own a copy of the band's self-titled debut, on which the track appears, but could not recall how it came to be part of his collection.\n\nA US court ruled that Led Zeppelin founders Robert Plant and Jimmy Page must face trial in a copyright row over the song 'Stairway to Heaven'. The copyright infringement action had been brought by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the late Spirit guitarist Randy Wolfe, who played on the same bill as Led Zeppelin in the 1960s, and claimed he should be given a writing credit on the track.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLed Zeppelin's 'Whole Lotta Love' was voted the greatest guitar riff of all time by listeners of BBC Radio 2 in the UK. The rock classic came out top from a list of 100 riffs drawn up by a panel of Radio 2 and 6 Music DJs, critics and record producers.

Page, while on tour with the Yardbirds in 1967, saw Holmes perform the song in Greenwich Village and within months had adapted the song for the Yardbirds and later for Led Zeppelin. The case was eventually settled, with the writing credit on the song changed to \"Jimmy Page, Inspired By Jake Holmes.\"\n\nA rare oversized two-part poster featuring Led Zeppelin, The New Barbarians and others at Knebworth Park on August 4th & 11th August, 1971, sold for £5,000 ($7,480) at a Christie’s Rock & Roll auction held in South Kensington, London.

He admitted: 'I think the thing about it is really, is that to visit old ground, it's a very incredibly delicate thing to do, and the disappointment that could be there once you commit to that and the comparisons to something that was basically fired by youth and a different kind of exuberance to now, it's very hard to go back and meet that head on and do it justice'.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLed Zeppelin singer Robert Plant was voted the Greatest Voice In Rock by listeners of radio station Planet Rock.

A local review stated; 'Their performance and their music were absolutely flawless, and the music continued to ring nicely in the ears for some time after the curtains were drawn after their show. We can therefore conclude that the new Yardbirds are at least as good as the old ones were'.\n\nJimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones and John Bonham played together for the first time when they rehearsed at a studio in Gerrard Street in London's West End.
