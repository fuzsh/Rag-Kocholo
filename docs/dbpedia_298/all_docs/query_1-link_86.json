        "text": "I picked up my 2012 Genesis back in September for just over $21k with 24k on the clock and had to part ways with it today. For those most part it has been a phenomonal vehicle. Smooth, great mileage, tons of compliments, and a really solid value.\n\nHowever, right after original purchase I started having problems filling up the gas tank. I took it to the dealer within the first two weeks to have it resolved, and the dreaded \"unable to duplicate issue\" arose.\n\nThe problem was that the fuel pump would click off anywhere between 10 and 100 times (yes, up to 100 times) during fill-ups. Howevere, the service tech only tried to put in 2 gallons of gas back in the fall when I first brought it to their attention, and somehow it didn't click off. That is, until when I tried to completely fill the tank later that afternoon, then it was back to its normal self.\n\nDue to a ton of work travel and little time, I have simply put up with the issue for the last 18k miles. Last week I finally was pi$$ed enough to the point that I took it back in. The first thing the service manager asked was whether or not I had completed my 30k mile service. Now I am not a by the book service guy, sure I replace wipers, air filters, etc. but I do not hand over a stack of $500 for a dealer 30k service. So the cocky tech and service manager bust out the \"recommended service\" sheet for 30k, and they circle the \"replace fuel filter air filter\". What the heck is a \"fuel filter air filter\"? Since they were so convinced that this was the cause and the total cost for the part and labor was about $80 I allowed them to \"fix\" it.\n\nWell after leaving the dealer and being put in a loaner I called 3 other dealers in the Dallas area, none even knew what the heck a \"fuel filter air filter\" was, and had never recommended it as part of the 30k service. So later that evening the dealer calls me and says we took apart the trunk to get to the \"fuel filter air filter\" and sure enough, it was dirty. So given his confidence I told him that as long as it will fix the issue, go ahead and change it. But I also warned him that he would be refunding my money if this didn't fix anything. He would not agree to that even after discussing my conversations with three other dealerships. So we had our words, but they completed the work.\n\nI come to pick the car up the next morning, skeptically go in and pay the cashier the $80, and go get in the car. One part that I left out up to this point is that they asked me to authorize up to $30 in fuel so they could try and replicate as well as make sure the problem was fixed. When I got in the car the fuel needle hadn't moved a frickin bit! Somewhat angry, I pull out, drive to blocks to the QT gas station, and within 2 gallons of filling up the pump had already shut off 12 times.\n\nI'm hot at this point.....drive back to the dealer, have major words, and it ends at that. Credit card charge is being disputed with AMEX, which should be a slam dunk, although I could give two $hits about $80.\n\nIf this easy 30k service issue was the simple fix, why didn't they point this out when I brought it in back in the fall with just under 30k on the clock?\n\nTook it to a different dealer Thursday, they replaced the charcoal canister this morning after the part arrived, detailed my car, and it is now sitting on the lot of a Ford dealer here in Dallas.\n\nLiterally drove from the Hyundai dealer to the Ford dealer to pick up an F150. Now it may sound a bit stupid to dump a car for this issue which is supposedly now fixed, but I did get $19k on trade for a car I paid $21k for, and put on over 18k miles. I'd say that is a pretty good cost per mile. Not to mention I got the 2014 F150 stickered at $42k for $29k.\n\nMoral of the story.....I have driven a lot of premium vehicles from Mercedes, BMW, Lexus and Jaguar over the years. Hyundai has come a long ways with the cars, but until the service is on par they are going to be having a hard time keeping a discriminating buyer.\n\nIt was a good 18k miles, but I have a feeling I learned my lesson. My Ford will probably have issues as well, but it isn't trying to compete in the luxury car market.\n\nThe maintenance schedule does indeed specify replacing the fuel tank air filter every 30K miles. I am assuming, based upon other vehicles, this is a vent so the fuel tank won't collapse as fuel is drawn out and it doesn't have anything to do with your issue since the tank can vent through the filler neck as it is filled.\n\nI also don't think replacing the charcoal canister would resolve your issue either as its purpose is to draw gas vapors from the tank instead of venting them outside. It wouldn't do anything without a running engine and I assume you shut the engine off during refueling.\n\nDo gas stations in your area have that collapsible collar surrounding the filler nozzle? Those are designed to produce a slight vacuum so that escaping fumes are drawn into an underground tank instead of into the air. If that were not operating the fuel delivery could slow or be blocked however I assume this issue has happened at various gas stations.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of is that the fuel filler hose is kinked somewhere between the filler neck and tank and the fuel just backs up and shuts off the pump. Does the issue happen at very low fill speeds or at high speeds?\n\nAs for dumping the Genny, it is of course your decision but this type of problem can happen to any car. The good lawyer across the street has an Audi that has cost him half the original price of the car in maintenance and repairs. My various neighbors who own Mercedes and Lexus report very high rates for their service and repair work as well. My last F-150 (2004) blew an engine at 48K and cost almost 5 grand to replace out of warranty. It was a manufacturing defect but was not covered due to time. Ask me if I will ever buy another Ford.\n\nI have discovered over the years that a good independent shop not only has slightly lower hourly rates but chances are they also have more knowledgeable mechanics than dealer's shops.\n\nI got rid of my 2013 premium last week as well...I loved this car but it was dropping almost $1,000 a month...in 18 months it went from 37K to 21K...went to Hyundai to look at trading in on a 2015 and the sales lady stated the cars were a \"dime a dozen\" and they could get them at auction for $17K...asked her to remind me never to buy another Hyundai...immediately went to BMW and bought a 328 the same day...love my new car, miss my Genesis, but could no longer stand the poor service and low end mentality of the Hyundai staff...the salespeople at the two dealers here in North Florida were slimy and stereotypical of the \"used car salesman.\" After telling me Hyundai's were worthless, she tried to talk me into a 2015?????\n\nAnyway, I know all cars lose value, but it's too bad my beautiful car was basically worth the same s a Toyota Corolla...oh well, I enjoyed it while it lasted!!\n\nA couple of comments on your post (not intended as criticism):\n\nCars are NOT investments. They depreciate, sometimes rapidly. If you like to change cars frequently you should lease, otherwise plan on keeping the car a minimum of ten years and you will amortize, best as possible, the cost. There is no depreciation on a car you do not sell. To sell an otherwise good car simply because it is depreciating makes little sense. And I don't need to comment that you should NEVER trade in a car. Always sell it yourself if at all possible.\n\nDo not use car dealers, or their staffs, as financial sources. There are a number of rating services online that can give you an excellent idea of what your car is worth and can tell you which models are in over or under supply. None of these are exact but they are close enough and are not influenced by someone depending upon a sale for their evening meal. If you are curious as what a particular model depreciates get the lease figures.\n\nNot all car dealers are created equal. German marques are very proud of their cars and their dealerships reflect this in the prices they charge. Hope like hell you don't ding up that 328 because Beemer repair costs are large, and they love maintenance. My local Hyundai dealerships are both top notch (although one just sold out to a national store so not sure I will be back to them). After a lot of trial and error I found a great independent shop and use them for everything I can't do personally. There is something about a personal relationship with the shop owner that makes me much more confident I am getting a quality job done at a reasonable cost. And I know exactly who is working on my vehicle.\n\nMy 2 cents. YMMV"
