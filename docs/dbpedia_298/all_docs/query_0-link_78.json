        "text": "A Moral Challenge: Hermeneutical Problems of an Ethics of the Book of Genesis\n\nBiblical ethics reflects upon maxims of moral behavior from the perspective of normative good and examines its legitimations and justifications, as well as the consequences of what can be called a morally positive or negative behavior. If maxims of good behavior are to be derived from historical narrative traditions, such an undertaking is confronted with the problem that implicit maxims of moral behavior are entangled with a number of other motifs and can never be isolated purely. The narratives of the Bible are subject to this challenge for any reconstruction of a historical ethos and its ethics. Their moral maxims were also anchored in the cultural contexts and ideals of their time. Although biblical narratives, including some in the book of Genesis, were ethically self-reflecting, they participated in the historicity of the cultural ideal motifs of their time. The solution for the resulting hermeneutical problem for any historical ethics due to the “nasty gap of history” (Gotthold Ephraim Lessing) – the tensions between modern ethical maxims and those of the Bible – is the main problem for any biblical ethics of the Torah or more specifically, the book of Genesis. The methodological consequence of this tension is that an ethics of the book of Genesis must first be descriptive in nature, before any questions of its applicability to the ethics of the twenty-first century can be discussed, which will be beyond the scope of this contribution.\n\nIf someone takes up the Bible today to find ethical guidance for his or her daily life and starts to read the book of Genesis as its entrance gate, the reader will become more and more puzzled. They will discover that all the holy characters of the venerable patriarchs and their wives from Abraham up to Jacob and his sons acted again and again rather selfishly and immorally. Abraham delivered his wife Sarah to foreign rulers and did not protect her from the king in Egypt (Gen 12:10–20) nor from Abimelek, the king in Gerar (Gen 20: 1–18), even claiming that she was his sister. Sarah, because she was barren, delivered her slave-girl Hagar to Abraham. But when Hagar became pregnant with Ishmael, Sarah treated her harshly (Gen 16:1–15) and expelled her from Abraham’s house, so that Hagar had to flee to the desert ready to die (Gen 21:8–21). Abraham’s son Isaac copied his father, when he disowned his wife Rebekah delivering her to the king of Gerar, Abimelek, claiming that she was his sister. The patriarch Jacob did not act any better than his father or grandfather and was so immoral in many aspects of his behavior that the people gave him the name “the deceiver.” His name, which was semantically derived from the Semitic root ‘qb, meaning “God is near,” was also interpreted via a folk etymology in Gen 27:36 (cf. also Hos 12:4), which was connected with the Hebrew root ‘āqab “to deceive.” This interpretation highlighted Jacob’s role as a deceiver, recalling the time Jacob defrauded his brother Esau of his birthright in Gen 27: 1–40 and then later cheated his uncle Laban out of his flock, while Rachel, Jacob’s wife, stole Laban’s deities (Gen 31:1–21). The pattern of immorality continued to the next generation as well – in Gen 34 Jacob’s sons Simeon and Levi illegally killed all the male citizens of Shechem, although they had contracted a connubium with the Shechemites. In Gen 35: 22 Reuben had intercourse with his father’s concubine Bilhah. In Gen 37 Jacob’s sons sold their brother Joseph into slavery because of their jealousy over Jacob’s love for him. These misdeeds of the patriarchs and the apparent condoning of their numerous lapses in judgment are rather confusing for readers of the Bible, who do not expect moral ambiguity here but a clear and ideal moral profile of its acting heroes as moral paradigms.\n\nThe moral ambiguity in the narratives of the book of Genesis caused readers to look for apologetical strategies to create a morally unequivocal text by eliminating or downplaying especially those aspects in the narratives which contradicted modern moral standards and sentiments. One of the apologetic strategies was to find an answer in the anthropology of the primeval stories in Gen 1–11, especially in the narrative of the fall of humankind in Gen 3, so that the negative aspects in the ethos of the patriarchs was interpreted as expression of a sinful human nature, which should be the result of the fall of mankind in Gen 2– 3. In this interpretation it was God’s grace alone which elected Israel’s patriarchs. But this apologetical solution was theologically thwarted by another problem. If Israel’s patriarchs in their moral ambiguity cannot be models and examples of morals, then God himself should be this ethically unequivocal model without any kind of moral ambiguity. But examining God’s actions in the primeval history narrated in the book of Genesis also raises theological problems. In the meta-mythical perspective of monotheism in the creation-narrative of Gen 1:1–2:3 God was thought to be both almighty and good as His creation of the world and human beings was portrayed as perfect and morally good. The main presupposition of the acting God in the following narratives was His omnipotence and goodness. Gen 1:31 told the reader “God saw all what he had made, and it was good” and this judgment included the creation of mankind in Gen 1:26–30. But looking at God’s actions in Genesis with these criteria for God’s divinity in mind, starting with the narrative of the fall of mankind in Gen 2–3, raises doubts in the mind of the reader. The consequence of the divine opacity in Gen 2–3 was the catastrophe of all the pre-diluvian generations of mankind, so that its annihilation with the exception of Noah’s family was a further aspect of divine moral ambiguity in the book of Genesis. Even more problematic and not at all unequivocal seemed to be God’s position in the narrative of “Isaac’s binding” in Gen 22, where God demanded Abraham kill and sacrifice his son Isaac. This divine command was unethical, because what God demanded from Abraham contradicted any human ethos and any program for an ethics of imitatio Dei, which sought to see in the divine actions a model for an ideal human ethos. Moral ambiguity on the human and the divine side in Genesis seems to shatter any ethics which tries to find ethical models and examples in the narratives of this book.\n\nA second apologetic strategy beyond looking for any imitatio hominis sive Dei argues that the moral ambiguity of human actions in the narratives of Genesis owed to the fact that the divine legal and moral order of the Sinai-pericope was not yet revealed, so that the patriarchs and their families did not yet know of this divine legal and moral order. But this explanation does not solve the theological problem of moral ambiguity of the patriarchs and their wives, because after the revelation of the divine legal order at Mount Sinai the moral ambiguity in the actions of the people did not stop but continued as in Genesis (so in the narratives of murmuring of the Exodus generation in the desert in Num 14; 20 and 25). The Sinai revelation did not solve the problem of moral ambiguity in the narratives of biblical protagonist. On the contrary the divine revelation at Mount Sinai itself causes problems for any biblical ethics, for example by the death penalty for a son who was rebellious against his parents, or for adultery (Lev 20:10; Deut 21:18–21; 22: 22), and by mutilation as penalty for an assault (Exod 21,23–24; Lev 24:19–20; Deut 19:21). The Sinai-revelation did not solve the problem of ethical ambiguity in the book of Genesis but represented a moral problem of its own because of the fundamental differences between its ancient moral standards and modern maxims of ethics. Once again, we see the hermeneutical “nasty gap,” which could not and cannot be overcome by any hermeneutical or exegetical ploy.\n\nA third apologetical strategy to deal with the moral ambiguity in narratives of Genesis and their morally negative traits of behavior was offered by liberal Old Testament scholarship of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These scholars tried to overcome the “nasty gap” of historicity of biblical ethos by reconstructing the development of biblical ethics as a process of moral progress. By recognizing the increasing denaturing, internalization, individualization, and universalization of interiorized moral values in biblical texts, pre-Deuteronomistic and pre-priestly narratives in Genesis could be seen as mirrors of early moral standards in Israel’s history, which were in part an inheritance of a pre-Canaanite nomadic life in the desert and in part a product of Canaanite agricultural culture. These early influences still impacted the ethics in Israel after the conquest of its Promised Land. J. M. Powis Smith wrote in 1925:\n\nThe wonder is not that there is so much of the crude and primitive and sensuous in the morals of the early Israel, but that the soul of the people persisted in seeking after the higher things and gradually shook off all these lower materialistic habits and developed for itself a moral life that has held the admiration of mankind.\n\nIn his construction of Israel’s moral evolution, God’s moral development was seen as part of the improvement of moral standards in Israel’s history of ethics. In the early pre-Deuteronomistic and pre-priestly history of biblical religion and ethics God was credited with sentiments, purposes, and actions, “that are very human, and indeed in some cases, quite inhuman.” In order to spotlight the higher moral values of the prophets, the pre-priestly patriarchal narratives of the book of Genesis were interpreted as witnesses of a primitive moral standard. This kind of construction of the development of Israel’s moral standards in liberal nineteenth-century scholarship was based on historico-critical decisions of what was early and what was late in the Hebrew Bible, which meant that the ethics were built on a kind of circular reasoning. It was unsatisfactory that these kinds of evolutionary constructions were based on what is now considered the rather problematic exegetical hypotheses of Wellhausian source criticism in the Pentateuch and on the application of ethical criteria taken from nineteenth-century models of the evolution of morals. As we have seen, the moral ambiguity in the narratives of Genesis can cause readers to call into question the biblical ethics of Genesis, but we can also expect that the narratives of this book can give an answer to such doubtful and critical attitudes.\n\nNarrative Tractates on Meta-Ethics in the Book of Genesis\n\nIn Gen 49:2–7 Jacob blamed Reuben, “for you went up onto your father’s bed, onto my couch and defiled it,” and Simeon and Levi were cursed, “for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.” Where did Jacob derive the values to blame his sons Reuben, Simeon and Levi? Jacob’s son Joseph acted in an entirely different way from his brothers by striving for reconciliation. Again, one must ask, where did he get the maxims for his actions? If, in the narratives, the behavior of the patriarchs was implicitly valued positively or negatively, one must ask for the criteria and implicit values for such an evaluation and, ultimately, for the legitimation of these implicit values in the narratives of Genesis, so that the readers of this book could agree to them and receive ethical guidance for their lives. The legitimation and justification of fundamental moral values and norms of behavior inherent in the narratives of Genesis was a topic of an inner-biblical meta-ethics. Genesis contains several narrative tractates on meta-ethics, so in Gen 2–3; 22 and 38, which differed categorically from didactic-sapiential narratives which aimed at the imitation of their moral “heroes” as representatives of an implicit moral behavior like Joseph in Gen 37 and 39–50. The narrative in Gen 38 was written and incorporated into the Joseph story in order to argue for a Judean openness to foreign strangers comparable to the book of Ruth, but Gen 38 was not a didactic narrative in the sense that the acting subjects were representatives of different moral standards and values of biblical wisdom literature as was the case with the Joseph narrative. The acting persons were drawn as characters who had to decide in situations of moral conflicts and dilemmas: God chastised Er and Onan because of their selfishness and wickedness disregarding the levirate duty, so that both had to die. Judah, who had not realized that it had been God himself who killed his sons, was afraid of losing his last son and prevented him from fulfilling his levirate obligation. The readers of this chapter should realize that Judah was in a tragic conflict and aporia between following the obligation of continuing the family and genealogy of his eldest son on the one hand and risking the life of his youngest son on the other. For the readers it was evident that Judah’s decision, to save the life of his youngest son, was an obviously terrible mistake, caused by the fact that Judah did not know the real reasons for the death of his sons. Therefore, the readers themselves should identify the criteria for Judah to decide in such a morally aporetic conflict. If they were of the opinion and came to the solution that in such a conflict the decision required him to follow the legal obligations of the Torah – in this case the duty to fulfill the levirate according to Deut 25:5–10 – then the narrative explained to them that this solution would be far too simple. When Judah learned that his daughter, although widowed, became pregnant by prostituting herself, he decided to kill her according to the legal obligation of that time to protect the genealogy of his son by the death penalty for his daughter-in-law according to Deut 22:21 and Leviticus 21:9. Once again Judah did not know the real facts and circumstances, so he was unaware that his decision to simply follow the legal obligations and commands of the Torah would be responsible for an act of plain injustice. The readers of the story again knew more than Judah, who was not aware of the fact that Tamar had decided to strive for the survival of the family and its genealogy of her deceased husband. The first lesson the readers of this narrative tractate on meta-ethics had to learn, was to accept that situations which called for moral decisions were often more complex and complicated than they seemed to be on the surface, because, and this is a second lesson the readers had to learn, God could be the acting subject hidden behind the scene and under the surface of human actions and this could imply that the real facts were hidden for a naïve observer of the scene, as Gen 38:7.10 demonstrated. The third lesson the readers had to learn was that they must know the criteria by which to decide what a moral action would be and what made an action unmoral. Simple reliance on Torah could sometimes lead to a hasty decision, since the application of the legal and moral rules of the Torah to a concrete situation might result in an injustice without a comprehensive and exact knowledge of all the real facts and circumstances as they are told in Gen 38:24–26. One may argue that the authors of Gen 38 intended to demonstrate that without the revelation of a divine moral and legal order at Mount Sinai ethical conflicts like those in Gen 38 could not be solved. But one has to admit that none of the rules and prescriptions of the revealed Sinaitic order could have helped Judah to solve these ethically aporetic conflicts. Furthermore, the literary history of Gen 38 speaks against such an apologetic theory – that the authors of Gen 38 intended to demonstrate the necessity of revelation of the Sinai-Torah for solving a moral aporia. Gen 38 represents a rather late, post-exilic, narrative, which was inserted into the Joseph story in order to argue against the prohibition of intermarriage of the Torah in Exod 34:11–16 and Deut 7:1–7. So the question of criteria for moral decisions needs another answer and the authors of Gen 38 did not hesitate to deliver it in Gen 38:24–26, when Judah commented on Tamar’s effort to enforce her right for levirate by rather dubious means:\n\n“She is more righteous than I am (ṣādəqāh mimmennî)” (Gen 38:26).\n\nThe root ṣdq does not mean “justice” here in the sense of an Aristotelian iustitia distributiva but rather in the sense of loyalty to a community where the acting subject was living, so that the noun could also be used in the plural form for several acts of solidarity. Judah qualified Tamar’s behavior as “just” in the sense of “loyal” to the welfare of the family by saving its genealogy and future with a son. In cases of moral conflicts of different ethical values and options, acting for the welfare of the societal community in which they were living had to be a decisive criterion for their moral decisions. This means that the narrative in Gen 38, read as a tractate of meta-ethics, was pleading for a type of ethos of responsibility. This kind of ethos corresponded to the biblical anthropology of the social nature of human beings as corporate persons. Commentaries of Genesis often qualify the narrative of Gen 38 as “profane” or “secular,” because its core section in Gen 38:12–30 does not speak of any divine actions or revelations. But Gen 38:7–10 shows God as a secret actor in the background, so that the narrative is not at all profane. The portrayal of God as only acting in a secret manner in the background meant that the human actors had to make decisions based on their own conscience and orientated on the value of the concept implied by the verbal root ṣdq. This solution of a meta-ethics in the narrative in Gen 38 begs the question: how is the freedom and competence of the individual human being to decide on his or her own how to realize ṣedeq (the noun) for his or her societal context, theologically and anthropologically founded and legitimized in the narratives of Genesis?\n\nThe narrative in Gen 2–3 answers these questions. This narrative was also to be read as a narrative tractate on meta-ethics as a key text not only for all of Genesis but for all the Torah in the Pentateuch. Like Gen 38, the narrative in Gen 2–3 too showed a certain distance from the divine order of the Torah, which was revealed at Mount Sinai. Gen 2:24 reads: “A man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.” Gen 2:24 dissolved the rule of exogamy by subversively turning it round. This rule was constitutive for biblical family law in the revelation of Torah in the Sinai-pericope and in its interpretation by Moses in Deuteronomy. Gen 2–3 should be read from the perspective of Gen 1 implementing in Gen 2:24 the idea of the equality of man and woman in Gen 1:27,31: “So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them … God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning – the sixth day.”\n\nBut the life-experiences of all the readers of these priestly verses told them something entirely different – namely, male dominance over women and many other evils in the world. Neither world nor human beings were perfect and good – on the contrary, there was much human suffering from many evils in the world, which had been, as Gen 1 told, so well created. The authors of the narrative tractate in Gen 2–3 intended to give a solution of this contradiction between the priestly theological theory of a perfect divine creation of the world and humankind in Gen 1 and the realm of human experiences in the real world. They tried to answer the question how and why evil came into a perfectly created world. A long tradition of exegetical scholarly interpretation of the narrative in Gen 2–3 as a story of the “fall” understood its theological intention in that way – that the authors of Gen 2–3 wanted to say that the first human couple was responsible for the evil which came into human lives after the good and perfect creation because they had disregarded a divine command. Thereby the authors of the narrative in Gen 2–3 intended to warn their readers of the dangers of eating from the fruits of the “tree of knowledge” and aspiring after “being like God.” This meant that these authors of Gen 2–3 intended to exhort their readers to follow the divine prohibitions and orders. But this interpretation misses the intention of the authors of Gen 2–3, the theological kerygma of this narrative, and its meta-ethical theory. The story does not promote or forbid specific human behavior but says simply that the first couple did, in fact, eat forbidden fruit. This is a decisive difference. The authors of Gen 2–3 took part in a post-exilic biblical debate about human abilities to distinguish between good and evil and, in this context, to recognize the divine moral order which was thought to determine what was good and what was evil, and which was responsible for the success and disaster of those who were obedient to this order or neglected it.\n\nThese questions were already controversially debated in Job and its supplements with Job 32–37 on the one side and Job 28 on the other. The author of Job 28 asks,\n\nWhere can wisdom be found? Where is understanding dwelling? No mortal comprehends its worth, it cannot be found in the land of the living … God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells, for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.\n\n(Job 28:13–14, 23– 24)\n\nQohelet resumes Job 28’s acknowledgment of the human incapacity to recognize the divine order and what was good or bad sub specie Dei, in God’s eyes, so that we mortals had to discover on our own what was good and what was evil. Qohelet 8:16–17 refers to Job 28, saying,\n\nWhen I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe what is done on earth … no one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it.\n\nBen Sirach voted for the opposite position on the basis of a priestly theology of creation and the covenant theology, writing,\n\nCounsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart He gave them to understand. Withal he filled them with knowledge of understanding, and showed them good and evil. He set His eyes upon their hearts, that He might show them the greatness of His works. He gave them the glory in His marvelous acts forever, that they might declare His works with understanding. And the elect shall praise his holy name. Besides this He gave the knowledge and His law of life for a heritage. He made an everlasting covenant with them, and showed them His judgment.\n\n(Sirach 17:6–12)\n\nThe authors of the narrative tractate in Gen 2–3 took part in this debate between the authors of the books of Job, Qohelet, and Ben Sirach and advocated for a position of their own – criticizing the positions of Qohelet on the one side and Ben Sirach on the other by arguing that mortals did not possess any knowledge of what was good and what was evil sub specie Dei nor did mortals make use of this knowledge as a divine gift. For the authors of the narrative in Gen 2–3 the knowledge of good and evil was the result of a human rebellion against the divine command not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Background for this theological solution was the motive found in Job 15:8 that a mortal human being had been listening to the divine council and had stolen divine wisdom from this realm. As in Gen 38 the readers of Gen 2–3 had to learn some lessons from this narrative tractate and one lesson was to learn to read this narrative as a tractate about human freedom in deciding moral matters. The first and theologically decisive aspect of Gen 2–3 was the freedom God granted to humanity either to follow his order or to neglect it, knowing well the consequence of mortality for disregarding God’s command. Granting humanity freedom to decide to follow His order or to disregard it implies a divine withdrawal by limiting His divine omnipotence and renouncing His sovereignty in relation to humankind. The kabbalah described the divine withdrawal as God’s concentration and contraction. But for the authors of Gen 2–3, this withdrawal was different from its kabbalistic interpretation and not a matter of rendering possible all the divine acts of creation of the world. The authors of the narrative in Gen 2–3 connected the implicit motive of divine withdrawal only with God’s relationship to the human beings by granting them the freedom to decide to follow His divine command or to disregard it. These authors knew that there was no freedom without the possibility to fail and that a freedom without this possibility was no freedom at all. Gen 2–3 told the reader that the two mortals failed on account of the freedom God had granted to them. The freedom God conceded to humans had its price, a pretium libertatis, in the form of fundamental reductions of human life spelled out in the divine curses in Gen 3:17–20. This was the next lesson the readers of Gen 2–3 had to learn. The integration of mortals into their natural environment was and is disturbed by enmity . In a similar way, the relation of love between men and women was and is disturbed by male domination over women. From now on the mortals had to live with their moral ambiguity, which would be responsible for the increasing violence with each generation in the primeval history. The story of Cain and Abel in Gen 4 directly follows the narrative in Gen 2–3 and forms a unit of meta-ethical narratives in Gen 2–4. Gen 4 demonstrates the dangerous dimensions of moral freedom for the mortals, a freedom that God had granted as a divine gift to mankind but one that also required its limitation. To establish the necessity of this limitation was the ethical topic and function of the narrative in Gen 4 in relation to Gen 2–3. Human life had to be protected, so that, if Gen 2–3 claimed that human freedom had its price, it must not be another human life. Killing means that the murderer also destroys his own life, or so is the moral message of Gen 4:\n\nThen God said: What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you work the ground it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\n\n(Gen 4:10–13)\n\nThe motif of a harsh divine intervention in this narrative established the prohibition of homicide as a definite and fundamental norm at the beginning of human history, long before this norm became part of the revelation of the divine order of the Torah at Mount Sinai. The narratives in Gen 2–3 and Gen 4 were together part of one theological discourse on meta-ethics. The moral freedom God had granted to humanity meant that there would be conflicts between them, even between brothers, because true moral freedom came with the possibility of failure. The lesson the readers of Gen 4 had to learn was that any freedom God had granted to the mortals received limitations in the prohibition of solving conflicts by homicide. The story of the deluge in Gen 6–8 demonstrated the fatal consequences of neglecting this fundamental prohibition. The world is described as filled with violence due to the moral failures of humanity in exercising their freedom and all the mortals except from one family were annihilated by God. In this, Gen 6–8 reads as a kind of counter-narrative to Gen 1. But within Gen 2–4, Gen 4 was the necessary counter narrative to Gen 2–3.\n\nGen 2–4 as narratives of meta-ethics had another counter-narrative in the story of Abraham’s binding of his son Isaac at God’s command to sacrifice Isaac in Gen 22. This narrative of a meta-ethics could be read as a story of a Torah conflict: the divine command to Abraham in Gen 22 to kill and sacrifice Isaac contradicted the divine prohibition of killing a human being found in Gen 4 and Gen 9. The narrative in Gen 22 was construed as a prolepsis to the Sinai-pericope so that the revelation at Mount Sinai was not a complete novelty but was anticipated by Abraham’s experience of the presence of God demanding obedience to His commandments and the ritual offering of a whole burnt sacrifice. This narrative dealt with many theological aspects of the relationship between God and humankind and did not hide the “dark sides of God.” It was also to be read as a tractate of meta-ethics in Genesis in its relation to the narratives of the primeval history; not only in the way that Gen 22 transcended any dimension of a human ethics and opened the realm of an intimate personal relationship of trust between God and a single human being beyond any hope for his or her own life in the future, but in the sense of a limitation of God’s dark sides as God had promised already after the deluge in Gen 8:21–22:\n\nNever again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done. As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.\n\nAs the human hearts did not and would not change for the better, it was God himself who changed after the deluge. Henceforth his dark sides would be limited by the knowledge that He would always keep His promises like those in Gen 9:7 and 12: 1–3 and keep to His own rule in Gen 4, which prohibited any killing of a single human life, a norm which was reiterated after the deluge in Gen 9: 6. At the end of the narrative in Gen 22 God confirmed that He himself would keep to His own ethical rules and the legal commands that He had given to all the mortals, so that He would be morally reliable for them. In this sense Gen 22 was laying the theological and meta-ethical basis for the divine revelation of His legal and moral order in the Sinai-pericope."
