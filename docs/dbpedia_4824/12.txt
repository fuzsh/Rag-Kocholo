Dawes Plan, arrangement for Germany’s payment of reparations after World War I. On the initiative of the British and U.S. governments, a committee of experts (with two members each from France, Belgium, Italy, Britain, and the United States), presided over by an American financier, Charles G. Dawes, produced a report on the question of German reparations for presumed liability for World War I.

The so-called Dawes Committee began its meetings in Paris on January 14, 1924, and reported on April 9. The “Dawes Report” treated stabilization of currency and the balancing of budgets as interdependent, though provisionally separable for examination, and it insisted that currency stability could be maintained only if the budget was normally balanced, while the budget could be balanced only if a stable and reliable currency existed. Both were needed to enable Germany to meet its internal requirements and treaty payments.
