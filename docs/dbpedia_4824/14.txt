DEC., 158) THAT SECTION 7 OF THE ACT OF JANUARY 14, 1889, 25 STAT., 645, CONTEMPLATED A PER CAPITA DISTRIBUTION OF THREE-FOURTHS OF THE ANNUAL INTEREST MONEY ACCRUED ON TRUST FUNDS OF THE CHIPPEWA INDIANS, ANY COMPETENT ADULT INDIAN OF CHIPPEWA BLOOD COMING WITHIN THE RELIEF PROVISION OF THE ACT OF APRIL 14, 1924, 43 STAT., 95, IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE BACK ANNUITIES WHICH ACCRUED DURING MINORITY AS WELL AS SINCE REACHING MAJORITY, HERETOFORE UNPAID, AND NO PAYMENTS TO THE PARENTS OR OTHER LEGAL GUARDIAN OF SUCH INDIAN IS NECESSARY OR AUTHORIZED IN SUCH CASES.

COMPTROLLER GENERAL MCCARL TO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, JUNE 11, 1924:

I HAVE YOUR LETTER OF MAY 24, 1924, REQUESTING DECISION WHETHER UNDER THE ACT OF APRIL 14, 1924, 43 STAT., 95, PAYMENT OF BACK ANNUITIES TO CHIPPEWA INDIANS WHICH ACCRUED DURING THEIR MINORITY SHOULD BE MADE TO AN INDIAN WHO HAS NOW REACHED HIS MAJORITY OR TO THE PARENTS OR OTHER LEGAL GUARDIAN OF SUCH INDIAN.

THE ACT OF APRIL 14, 1924, PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS:

* * * THAT THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR BE, AND HE IS HEREBY, AUTHORIZED TO PAY, OUT OF ANY MONEYS BELONGING TO THE CHIPPEWA INDIANS OF MINNESOTA, SUCH AMOUNTS AS HE MAY FIND DUE ANY PERSONS OF CHIPPEWA BLOOD WHOSE NAMES MAY HAVE BEEN ERRONEOUSLY OMITTED OR STRICKEN FROM THE CHIPPEWA ANNUITY ROLLS, OR WHO HAVE BEEN OR MAY HEREAFTER BE FOUND ENTITLED TO ENROLLMENT FOR ANNUITY PAYMENTS AUTHORIZED BY SECTION 7 OF THE ACT OF CONGRESS APPROVED JANUARY 14, 1889 (TWENTY-FIFTH STATUTES AT LARGE, PAGE 642): PROVIDED, THAT ANY MONEYS FOUND DUE AND PAID TO ANY INDIAN UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACT SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY LIEN OR CLAIM OF ATTORNEYS OR OTHER PARTIES.

THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS ALLEGES IN HIS STATEMENT, UPON WHICH YOU BASE YOUR REQUEST FOR DECISION, THAT SECTION 7 OF THE ACT OF JANUARY 14, 1889, IS MANDATORY IN REGARD TO THE PAYMENT OF MINORS' SHARES TO THEIR PARENTS AND SEEMS TO BE OF THE OPINION THAT THE QUESTION IS ONE SIMILAR TO THAT DECIDED IN THE MOSIER CASE, 261 U.S., 359, AND IN DECISION OF THIS OFFICE DATED JULY 13, 1923, INVOLVING PAYMENTS TO MINOR OSAGE INDIANS. SEE ALSO DECISION OF MARCH 31, 1924, 3 COMP. GEN., 698.

A CAREFUL READING OF SECTION 7 OF THE ACT OF JANUARY 14, 1889, 25 STAT., 645, FAILS TO DISCLOSE ANY EXPRESS PROVISION FOR PAYMENT OF MINORS' SHARES TO THEIR PARENTS SUCH AS APPEAR IN THE STATUTES CONTROLLING PAYMENT OF ANNUITIES TO OSAGE INDIANS, CONSIDERED IN THE CITED DECISIONS OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND THIS OFFICE. THE PROVISION OF SECTION 7 OF THE ACT OF JANUARY 14, 1889, SUPRA, FOR CONSIDERATION IN THIS CONNECTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

* * * ONE-HALF OF SAID INTEREST SHALL, DURING THE SAID PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS, EXCEPT IN THE CASES HEREINAFTER OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED, BE ANNUALLY PAID IN CASH IN EQUAL SHARES TO THE HEADS OF FAMILIES AND GUARDIANS OF ORPHAN MINORS FOR THEIR USE; AND ONE-FOURTH OF SAID INTEREST SHALL, DURING THE SAME PERIOD AND WITH THE LIKE EXCEPTION, BE ANNUALLY PAID IN CASH IN EQUAL SHARES PER CAPITA TO ALL OTHER CLASSES OF SAID INDIANS; AND THE REMAINING ONE-FOURTH OF SAID INTEREST SHALL, DURING THE SAID PERIOD OF FIFTY YEARS, UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, BE DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A SYSTEM OF FREE SCHOOLS AMONG SAID INDIANS, IN THEIR MIDST AND FOR THEIR BENEFIT; * *

IN DECISION DATED OCTOBER 21, 1896, 3 COMP. DEC., 158, THE THEN COMPTROLLER OF THE TREASURY APPROVED A CONSTRUCTION PLACED ON THE ABOVE QUOTED PROVISION OF LAW BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE BASED ON TREATY NEGOTIATIONS OF THE COMMISSION TO THE EFFECT THAT AN EQUAL PER CAPITA DISTRIBUTION OF THREE-FOURTHS OF THE ANNUAL INTEREST ON THE TRUST FUNDS OF THE CHIPPEWA INDIANS WAS INTENDED BY THE ACT. THE DECISION HELD IN PART AS FOLLOWS:

WITH THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE OBSCURITY OF THIS LEGISLATION I FULLY AGREE, AND INASMUCH AS THIS PRACTICE OF MAKING EQUAL PER CAPITA PAYMENTS HAD BEEN UNIFORMLY FOLLOWED SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT, I DO NOT FEET JUSTIFIED IN MAKING ANY OTHER CONSTRUCTION THAN THAT GIVEN CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE INAUGURATION OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT. UNLESS IT IS CLEARLY ERRONEOUS, A LONG CONTINUED, UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION OF AN ACT SUBSTANTIALLY CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH ITS ENACTMENT IS SUFFICIENT GROUND TO REGARD THE QUESTION AS SETTLED, UNDER THE WELL ESTABLISHED DOCTRINE THAT IN CASES OF DOUBT THE EXECUTIVE PRACTICE WILL BE TREATED AS THE TRUE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ACT. (EDWARDS-S, LESSEE V. DARBY, 12 WHEAT., 206; BROWN V. UNITED STATES, 113 U.S., 568; UNITED STATES V. HILL, 120 U.S., 169-182; UNITED STATES V. HEALEY, 160 U.S., 136; BOWLER'S FIRST COMP. DEC., 215-223; 1 COMP. DEC., 266; ID., 379.)

IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT PAYMENTS HAVE CONTINUED TO THIS TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT DECISION. NO MENTION IS MADE REGARDING PAYMENTS OF MINORS' SHARES TO THEIR PARENTS, BUT IT IS ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT AS A MATTER OF ADMINISTRATION, AND BECAUSE THE MINORS WERE SUPPOSED NOT TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THEIR OWN AFFAIRS, THEIR SHARES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE PARENTS OR OTHER LEGAL GUARDIANS. ASSUMING THAT TO BE THE SITUATION, IT MAY BE STATED THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE NECESSITY FOR SUCH A PROCEDURE CEASES WHEN AN INDIAN REACHES HIS MAJORITY AND IS OTHERWISE COMPETENT TO MANAGE HIS OWN AFFAIRS. THERE IS NO VESTED RIGHT IN THE PARENTS OR GUARDIANS TO RECEIVE THE MINORS' SHARES UNDER THE ACT OF JANUARY 14, 1889. THE INTEREST IS PRIMARILY THAT OF THE MINOR.

UNDER THE CONSTRUCTION THAT THE ORIGINAL ACT CONTEMPLATED A PER CAPITA DISTRIBUTION OF THE ACCRUED INTEREST, ANY COMPETENT ADULT INDIAN OF CHIPPEWA BLOOD COMING WITHIN THE RELIEF PROVISION OF THE ACT OF APRIL 14, 1924, IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE BACK ANNUITIES WHICH ACCRUED DURING HIS MINORITY AS WELL AS THOSE ACCRUING SINCE REACHING HIS MAJORITY, HERETOFORE UNPAID, AND NO PAYMENT TO THE PARENTS OR OTHER LEGAL GUARDIAN OF SUCH INDIAN IS NECESSARY OR AUTHORIZED IN SUCH CASES. YOUR QUESTION IS ANSWERED ACCORDINGLY.
