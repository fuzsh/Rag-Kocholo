(NASDAQ: DLTR) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended February 3, 2024.\n\n“We finished the year strong, with fourth quarter results reflecting positive traffic trends, market share gains, and adjusted margin improvement across both segments,” said Rick Dreiling, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “While we are still in the early stages of our transformation journey, I am proud of what our team accomplished in 2023 and see a long runway of growth ahead of us. As we look forward in 2024, we are accelerating our multi-price rollout at Dollar Tree and taking decisive action to improve profitability and unlock value at Family Dollar.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Jeff Davis added, “As an organization, we continue to execute at a high level. Our core operating performance was strong in the fourth quarter, despite some unanticipated developments related to general liability claims.”\n\nAdditional Business Highlights\n\nOpened 219 new stores in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year new store openings to 641\n\n$3 and $5 center-store merchandise available at approximately 5,000 Dollar Tree stores\n\n$3, $4, and $5 frozen and refrigerated items available at more than 6,500 Dollar Tree stores\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.07 billion in FY 2023\n\nIncreased free cash flow by $217.2 million compared to FY 2022\n\nFourth Quarter Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are between the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, and the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 11.9% to $8.63 billion. Enterprise same-store net sales increased 3.0%, driven by a 4.6% increase in traffic, partially offset by a 1.5% decline in average ticket. Dollar Tree same-store net sales increased 6.3%, driven by a 7.1% increase in traffic, partially offset by a 0.7% decline in average ticket. Family Dollar’s same-store net sales decreased 1.2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in traffic, partially offset by a 2.0% decline in average ticket.\n\nGross profit increased 16.2% to $2.77 billion and gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 32.1%. Gross margin expansion was driven by lower freight costs, sales leverage, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, and higher allowances, offset by product cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix, elevated shrink, and higher distribution and markdown costs. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes distribution and markdown costs related to the store portfolio optimization review, adjusted gross profit increased 19.8% to $2.86 billion and adjusted gross margin expanded 220 basis points to 33.1%.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 54.0% of total revenue, compared to 22.9%. The increase was due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a non-cash trade name impairment charge, a non-cash store asset impairment charge, a litigation charge, unfavorable development of general liability claims, labor investments in store and field payroll, investments in repairs and maintenance, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by sales leverage, the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023, and lower utility costs. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impairment and litigation charges, adjusted selling, general and administrative costs were 24.4% of total revenue.\n\nOperating loss was $1.89 billion and operating margin was -21.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income increased 21.2% to $749.1 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points to 8.7%.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 10.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.4%.\n\nNet loss was $1.71 billion and diluted loss per share was $7.85. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $555.7 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $2.55. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects approximately $0.17 of net negative impact, primarily related to unfavorable development of general liability insurance claims.\n\nGiven the portfolio review process, the Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.\n\nYear-to-Date Results\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all comparisons are between the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024, and the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023.\n\nConsolidated net sales increased 8.0% to $30.6 billion. Enterprise same-store net sales increased 4.6%. Dollar Tree same-store net sales increased 5.8%, driven by a 7.4% increase in traffic, partially offset by a 1.5% decline in average ticket. Family Dollar’s 3.2% same-store net sales increase was comprised of a 2.5% increase in traffic along with a 0.7% increase in average ticket.\n\nGross profit increased 4.3% to $9.31 billion and gross margin declined 110 basis points to 30.4%. The decline in gross margin was driven by elevated shrink, product cost inflation, unfavorable sales mix, and higher distribution and markdown costs, partially offset by lower freight costs, sales leverage, and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes distribution and markdown costs related to the store portfolio optimization review, adjusted gross profit increased 5.3% to $9.40 billion and adjusted gross margin declined 80 basis points to 30.7%.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 33.4% of total revenue, compared to 23.6%. The increase was due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, a non-cash trade name impairment charge, a non-cash store asset impairment charge, a litigation charge, labor investments in store and field payroll, unfavorable development of general liability claims, investments in repairs and maintenance, and higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by sales leverage and the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impairment and litigation charges, adjusted selling, general and administrative costs were 24.9% of total revenue.\n\nOperating loss was $881.8 million and operating margin decreased 1,080 basis points to -2.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income decreased 20.0% to $1.79 billion and adjusted operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 5.8%.\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was -1.0%. On a non-GAAP basis, the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.1% compared to 23.5%.\n\nNet loss was $998.4 million and diluted loss per share was $4.55. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $1.29 billion and adjusted diluted EPS was $5.89. Adjusted diluted EPS reflects approximately $0.24 of net negative impact, primarily related to unfavorable development of general liability claims.\n\nThe Company repurchased 3,905,599 shares for $504.3 million, including applicable excise tax.\n\nPortfolio Optimization Review and Impairments\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company announced that it had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation, or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of this review, we plan on closing approximately 600 Family Dollar stores in the first half of fiscal 2024. Additionally, approximately 370 Family Dollar and 30 Dollar Tree stores will close over the next several years at the end of each store’s current lease term. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we incurred $594.4 million of charges in connection with the store portfolio review. Additionally, we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $1.07 billion and a trade name intangible asset impairment charge of $950 million. Details of these charges are provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release.\n\nFirst Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Outlook\n\n“We are introducing an initial fiscal 2024 EPS outlook of $6.70 to $7.30. While we expect current shrink and mix levels to be a headwind in the first half of the year, we are expecting to benefit from favorable freight rates and moderating headwinds from reduced SNAP benefits throughout the year. We are making solid progress on our key growth initiatives and are encouraged by the early results of our business transformation efforts,” Davis added.\n\nConsolidated net sales for full-year fiscal 2024 are expected to range from $31.0 billion to $32.0 billion. The Company expects to deliver a low-to-mid-single digit comparable store net sales increase for the year, comprised of a mid-single-digit increase in the Dollar Tree segment and a low-single-digit increase in the Family Dollar segment. Diluted EPS is expected to range from $6.70 to $7.30.\n\nOur fiscal 2024 outlook reflects approximately $0.15 of EPS benefit from the anticipated Family Dollar store closures, mostly in the second half of the year as we close underperforming stores throughout the first half of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe Company expects consolidated net sales for the first quarter will range from $7.6 billion to $7.9 billion, based on a low-to-mid-single digit increase in same-store sales for the enterprise and the Dollar Tree segment and approximately flat same-store sales growth for the Family Dollar segment. Diluted EPS for the quarter is estimated to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.48.\n\nWhile share repurchases are not included in the outlook, the Company has $1.35 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization as of February 3, 2024.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nOn Wednesday, March 13, 2024, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its earnings results at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (In millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) From time-to-time, the Company discloses certain financial measures not derived in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purposes of analyzing operating performance, financial position, liquidity, or cash flows. The non-GAAP financial measures we have disclosed include adjusted gross profit; adjusted gross margin; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted selling, general and administrative expense rate; adjusted operating income (loss); adjusted operating income (loss) margin; adjusted net income; adjusted effective tax rate; adjusted diluted earnings per share; and free cash flow. The Company believes providing additional information in these non-GAAP measures that exclude the unusual expenses described below is beneficial to the users of its financial statements in evaluating the Company's current operating results in relation to past periods. In addition, the Company's debt covenants exclude the impact of certain unusual expenses. The Company has included a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables. 1.) In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million charge to its legal reserve for West Memphis-related matters. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, an additional $26.7 million charge was recorded to the legal reserve for these matters. 2.) During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involved identifying stores for closure, relocation or re-bannering based on an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance, among other factors. As a result of this portfolio optimization review, we plan to close approximately 970 underperforming Family Dollar stores, including approximately 600 stores to be closed in the first half of fiscal 2024, and approximately 370 stores to be closed at the end of each store's current lease term. Additionally, we identified approximately 30 underperforming Dollar Tree stores for closure and plan to close each at the end of the store's current lease term. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we incurred $594.4 million of charges in connection with the store portfolio optimization review, comprised of $503.9 million of store long-lived asset impairment charges, $80.6 million of inventory markdowns, $5.6 million of capitalized distribution cost impairment and $4.3 million in third party consulting fees incurred related to the review. 3.) In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and nonamortizing intangible assets. The impairment test of nonamortizing intangible assets indicated that the carrying value of the Family Dollar trade name exceeded its estimated fair value resulting in the recognition of a $950.0 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The goodwill impairment test indicated that the fair value of the Family Dollar reporting unit was lower than its carrying value resulting in the recognition of a $1,069.0 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. In addition, the Company discloses free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company believes free cash flow is an important indicator of our liquidity as it measures the amount of cash we generate from our business operations. Free cash flow may not represent the amount of cash flow available for general discretionary use, because it excludes non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt repayments and required settlements of recorded and/or contingent liabilities not reflected in cash flow from operations. The Company has included a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following tables.
