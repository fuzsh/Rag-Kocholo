        "text": "First Student\n\nLynn Anderson Ruth, who was chosen from a pool of students who finished in the top half of their class, registered for classes at Michigan State University - Oakland in 1959 and received student number 000001, making history as the first MSUO student.\n\nAnderson Ruth fondly remembers her college days, especially helping to create the original Student Senate, the OU chorus and Senior Ball at Meadow Brook Hall.\n\n\"We only had the Foundation buildings for classrooms. We had no residence halls and no library building. We created all our clubs and wrote our constitutional by-laws. It was fun creating from scratch. You learn so much doing this yourself.\"\n\nFirst Employee\n\nGeorge Karas was responsible for the maintenance of Meadow Brook Hall and Meadow Brook Estate and the physical plant at Michigan State University - Oakland. He also coordinated the construction of the buildings for the university, starting with the Foundation Halls and the student center, and helped plan for the additions of the library, intramural buildings for athletics and Dodge Hall of Engineering. He and his wife lived in a cottage on the estate for seven years.\n\nOne of the fondest memories Karas, who retired in 1987, has of OU was when he, Woody Varner and MSUO campus planners Milt Baron and Harold Lautner moved the prospective campus from north of Deer Lake on Adams Road to the current location. The decision to move the campus site was made in a half-hour as they were driving around Meadow Brook Farms.\n\nFirst Chancellor\n\nD.B. \"Woody\" Varner served as vice president of Michigan State University under President John Hannah and was present at Meadow Brook Hall when Hannah asked Matilda and Alfred Wilson to finalize the donation of their estate to establish a new university.\n\nVarner later served as OU's chancellor from 1958 through 1970.\n\nFirst Classes\n\nNoncredit continuing education classes started in July 1958 in a converted chicken coop.\n\n\"We took one of the chicken coops and converted it into a classroom,\" said Lowell Eklund, former dean of Continuing Education.\n\nThe coop had ceramic tile and concrete floors with a few stray chicken feathers in cracks in the wall.\n\nFirst Class, First-Year Students\n\nMichigan State University - Oakland's first convocation was Sept. 17, 1959. First classes began on Sept. 21 with all first-year students. With 570 students and 25 faculty members, the university opened with three buildings, North and South Foundation Hall and a portion of the Oakland Center. The most popular major was teacher education, followed by liberal arts, engineering science and business administration. Tuition and fees were $255 annually. The charter class graduated 125 students.\n\nFirst Research Grant\n\nPaul Tomboulian, distinguished professor, received the first research grant on campus and initiated the first undergraduate research program in 1960. He introduced biochemistry to the university and the first science-based environmental health major in Michigan in 1966 and obtained the first external department accreditation on campus in 1967.\n\nFirst Sport\n\nIn 1959, Hollie Lepley was hired to shape intramural and recreation activities at Oakland University. The intramural building was completed in 1963, and men's cross country became the first intercollegiate sport offered at Oakland in 1964.\n\nFirst Mascot\n\nBefore becoming the Golden Grizzlies, OU's nickname was the Pioneers and the unofficial mascot was Pioneer Pete. Pete started out in the 1950s as an aerospace pioneer, but when a student drew a buckskin-clad Pioneer Pete, the image stuck. In 1997, Oakland University moved its athletics program from NCAA Division II to Division I and in 1998 adopted the Golden Grizzlies nickname and the Grizz mascot.\n\nThe First Honors College Group\n\nThe Honors College Group, who in 1958 helped create Oakland University, was the first group of its kind anywhere in the world. Consisting of six students from the nation's first honors college, they joined university presidents, nationally recognized deans, representatives from industry and leaders in education who were meeting at the Meadow Brook Seminars to create Oakland University. The names of these six honors college students were Arden (Art) C. Barie, Darwin J. Casler, Duane Chapman, Phillip T. Eckstrom, Terry Smith and Paul H. Woodruff."
