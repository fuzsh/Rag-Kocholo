        "text": "The Big Chute Fiasco and the Great Rest, 126 days into America’s Great Loop\n\nEd and I are 126 days into America’s 6000 mile Great Loop. Since I last wrote we have gone from Big Chute to Midland; Midland to Parry Sound; Perry Sound to Britt; Britt to Killarney; Killarney to Baie Fine; Baie Fine to Drummond Island; Drummond Island to Mackinac Island; Mackinac Island to Mackinaw City; and Mackinaw City to Beaver Island. At Drummond Island, Michigan, we went through Customs and re-entered the United States.\n\nThere is so much to share especially about Bain Fine, a freshwater fjord off of Georgian Bay, part of Lake Huron, where hometown hero Frances Langford and husband Ralph Evinrude brought their yacht the Chanticleer. In fact, since the Great Chute, I feel like I’m a movie star experiencing a “Great Rest.” But today, I am not going to write about rest, but rather the stress and incredible experience of taking Finito through the Big Chute.\n\nThe Big Chute is second from the end of the 45 locks system of the historic Trent-Severn Waterway in Ontario, Canada. At this point although the trip had been beautiful, I was exhausted from all the locks and feeling raw.\n\nSo what’s the Big Chute? Well your boat is taken out of the water with you staying on it. It is a railroad car over a 60 foot hill for boats. The only one functioning in North America. Getting on the railway carriage is achieved as a vessel moves onto a submerged hoist and track. The boat is then floated onto the deck of the railroad car and cradled by straps. Then the carriage is slowly raised out of the water and the boat settles into the straps for support.\n\n(A boat in front of us)\n\n(The boat rail track down to the other side)\n\nNext the carriage is hoisted up the slope by wire ropes attached to winches on a railroad car that keep the boat straight. Once the boat is at the apex of the 60 foot summit, the carriage is lowered into the water by wire ropes. The boat is floated off the sling and continues the journey upstream.\n\nThis was all constructed to overcome a final obstacle, a giant hill. The earliest marine railway to take boats over the hill was constructed in 1917. The railway was rebuilt in the 1920s. In the 1970s, there was more boat traffic and it seemed time to take the approach of the rest of the Trent-Severn, blowing-up hills and waterfalls with dynamite -this time to create a super-lock. (This man over Nature thing is killing me!) Interestingly enough, this was decided against due to an invasive species that would have decimated a nearby fishery if a lock had opened to the bay, the sea lamprey. An ancient blood-sucking eel like creature that can grow up to two feet long had entered the Great Lakes to which the bay below the hill connects. How did this creature, and since the 70s many other invasive species, get into the Great Lakes in the first place? Through locks, especially the locks that opened the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and beyond through the “pride of North America’s” St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nSo to say the least, I was impressed that Canada had chosen to keep the Big Chute railroad operating to keep out the giant sea lamprey, but I was rather terrified of the chute itself. Perhaps my fear led to self-fulling prophesy because Finito did not make it over the first time. It’s kind of new boating territory and currents are intense due to a nearby waterfall and power generation plant.\n\nSo on the morning of July 13, after spending the night on the “blue-line,” with many other boats, Ed and I were ready to guide Finito and her 68,000 pounds onto and over the Big Chute – with Luna and Okee inside. The chute tenders allowed 6 jet skis to go ahead of us. When it was our turn to go in, Ed maneuvered Finito into the shoot carriage appropriately. He says he lost sight of the jet skis under the bow and slowed down a bit as we entered. That maneuver caused the swift current to catch the stern and drive us at an angle into the Chute. The chute tenders tried to help, by lifting the straps to center us. Unfortunately, one of the straps caught the stabilizer and did not allow us to move either forward or back. Once they released the strap, We were instructed to back off while the park’s employees checked for damage.\n\nThe current caught us again while we backed out, scraping the rubberized wires that separated the chute from the waterfall and power generating river. Falling right into all the angst I’d had about this in the first place, I had visions of the wires breaking and Finito towering over the falls. I yelled to the parks people asking if we could go around the nearby 40 or so people on jet skis waiting on a floating dock. The park service said “no” we had had to turn around completely because if we went around the floating dock there were huge rocks. Somehow Ed maneuvered away. I begged him to dock the boat and check the hull and bottom for damage. Ed said he already had. With a surgeon’s precision he stated over the headphones, “We are going in again.”\n\n“Again?” I incredulously responded.\n\n“Again,” replied Ed.\n\nI opened the doors to the salon and unzippered the screen: “Get ready Luna and Okee!”I could not believe it. I took a deep breath. The park’s people were waiting for us this time with no Jet Ski riders. The blue-line was filled with boats waiting their turn, people were out on docks watching. One lady made the sign of the cross and I did the same in her direction. Finito had experienced every boaters’ nightmare, “not to make it,” and now after only a few minutes of regrouping we were going to try again.\n\nShaking like a leaf, I stood port side to inform Ed of distances. Right away I saw the wood post we had busted on first try.\n\n“One foot from the wires. Heavy current.” I said as calmly as possible into the headset. Ed did not reply. With great force Ed gunned Finito onto the submerged railway car. Finito clicked into place. The strings held us. My eyes filled with tears. Horns blasted and boaters cheered and clapped from the sidelines. Ed walked out of the pilot house. We looked at each other and smiled…\n\nVideo #1, second try\n\nVideo #2 Arriving at the bay on the other side of the hill – 60 feet down to the bay of the Trent River not Georgian Bay as I state.\n\nThe Canadian Park Service gave me a necklace. I wore it for two weeks even though Captain Ed was the one who really earned it!\n\nNext post coming soon…\n\nTrent-Severn Waterway, Lock-a Rama! 105 days into America’s Great Loop\n\nEd and I are 105 days into America’s Great Loop. After traversing over 2000 miles, a fellow looper asked: “How long have you been gone from your home port in Stuart?” “Three months,” I replied. “How much longer will you be traveling?” “Seven more months,” Ed yelled from the pilot house – a sobering reminder that Captain and First Mate are not even half way.\n\nSince I last wrote, our trawler Finito has gone from Kingston to Trenton; Trenton to Frankfort; Frankfort to Cambellford; Campbellford to Hastings; Hastings to Peterborough; Peterborough to Buckhorn; Buckhorn to Bobcaygeon; Bobcaygeon to Kirkwood; and Kirkwood to Orillia.\n\nWe have been motoring along the 240 mile Trent-Severn Waterway, a National Historic Site of Canada. Constructed from 1833 through 1920, the zig-zagging waterway connects a series of lakes in central Ontario linking Georgian Bay and Lake Huron to Lake Ontario. The waterway contains 37 conventional locks, two of the worlds highest hydraulic lift locks, and concludes with the “Big Chute,” a marine railway that transports one’s boat, out of water, over a height of 60 feet – the only one of its kind still in use in North America!\n\nAlong the way there are villages, cities, and breathtaking scenery. I celebrated my 60th birthday on the Trans -Severn while in “Campbellford.” Here Ed saved a drowning pigeon, we had a romantic dinner on the Trent River, and I learned that when the word “ford” is used it means there was once a land bridge, a place where horses and people could cross the river. These shoals have been dredged and replaced by modern day bridges. My favorite stay though was on the downwall of Kirkfield’s lock 36, totally remote. I sent family at home a photo texting: “Where we slept last night – just us and the fireflies.” My clever brother Todd wrote back adding Sasquatch: “Are you sure you were alone?” he wrote. We all got a big laugh and then I wondered…\n\nIndigenous people, in Canada referred to as “First Nations,” and fur-trading Europeans following animal trails roamed this area in the 17th Century, pulling their canoes over portages. Later saw mills, water power gave birth to larger villages and eventually cities. By the 1920s, dredging, canals, dams, and locks replacing waterfalls and rapids and let’s not forget purposeful flooding created a navigable system. Today this Trent – Severn Waterway is a world famous destination for recreational boaters.\n\nLocks, locks, locks -Lock-a Rama- one after another, some double, some going up, some going down. The sun beating down so intensely that I started using an umbrella for shade. At the beginning of the lock journey, still bow-thrusterless, Ed and I were faltering.\n\nA gentleman in front of us called out: “Why don’t you put your wife on the bow rather than mid-ship?” Ed and I followed direction and from there on out Finito swung to the wall perfectly. At lock 20 a water pump blew bringing Finito’s starboard engine to a halt. We knew there was no way we could navigate the remainder of the trip on one engine. Luckily our next stop was Peterborough, a large city. Within in a couple of days and the with direction of friends Finito was repaired.\n\nLocks take time and I remain no expert on the waterways of the area but it is clear the altering of Nature’s wetlands and waters have had repercussions. Inside the locks algae and invasive zebra mussels coat the walls. Upon approach, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is almost out of control in many areas.\n\nJust like the Indian River Lagoon with all its problems, there remain many beautiful areas. Some lakes are clear and hold many bird species. In Lake Simone I saw at least 50 common loons! Eastern Kingbirds were prevalent in the gorgeous wild flower area along the canals. Turtles are a familiar sight, as are of course the Canada Geese, called “cobra-chickens” by the locals. The geese are so called for their aggressive manner and hissing with their tongues out when protecting their young. I admire this. They are survivors.\n\nMy favorite has been learning about the swans. So beautiful! Tundra swans that breed in Alaska and northern Canada are native -holding their necks straight while mute swans, the kind you see in Batman movies, gracefully curve their necks and were introduced from Europe. July 1st was Canada Day, and as the fireworks were blasting, I took a photograph of a pair of native tundra swans headed towards shore. We are seeing more and more swans of both types as we continue on the trip.\n\nToday, Ed and I are in Orillia almost at the end of the Trent -Severn. These lands like all were once the historic home of Indigenous people who fished here in one of North America’s oldest human developments – the Mnjikanning Fish Weirs between Couchiching and Simcoe lakes. I look forward to learning more about these people and how glorious the lands, waters, and wildlife were during their era and how to do our best to return so today.\n\nToday I get to enjoy these lands as a tourist. Ed and I are grateful for this. We are also grateful some of the new friends – that will become lifelong friends- we have met along the way and for Luna and Okee who are keeping us company on our journey. Get ready kids! Tomorrow, the Big Chute!\n\nHello Canada! 84 Days into America’s Great Loop\n\nCaptain Ed, Luna, Okee and I have arrived in Kingston, Ontario – Canada! This means we have traveled about 1500 miles since leaving Stuart, Florida. After 84 days, our captain/crew capabilities have improved, but are certainly not perfected.\n\nKingston is a historic and interesting city full of Canada Geese, Mallard Ducks, and people from all over the world, all raising their children. The water at Confederation Basin Marina is clear. Kingston lies on Lake Ontario at the mouth of the Cataraqui and St. Laurence Rivers. The submerged aquatic vegetation is so thick, it is being removed and piled atop the docks. I have been unable to determine if it is native or partially invasive. Nonetheless, the geese and ducks eat it ravenously!\n\nThe population of Kingston is very diverse. The city houses Queens University. The blend of old and new city has a hip and international vibe. There is every imaginable ethnic restaurant. Reading the historic markers makes clear that the community is coming to terms with its difficult Native American history.\n\nSince I last blogged, Ed and I have traveled from upstate New York’s Brewerton to Oswego; Oswego to Clayton; Clayton to Wellesley Island, and Wellesley Islands to Kingston, Ontario.\n\nEd and I stayed longer than planned in Brewerton. We had significant starboard bow-thruster issues in the Erie Canal and had hoped to get fixed at Winter Haven Marina. After a 12 day visit, we did not. Ed is ready to learn how to handle the boat anyway, and I had the opportunity to study a colony of supersonic barn swallows and their chicks. Also, with time on our hands, Ed and I visited the lands of my family’s mid 1800s teasel growing-Thurlow English heritage: Syracuse and Skaneateles, New York.\n\nMy father was born in Syracuse in 1936 and grew up in Liverpool on Onondaga Lake. This five mile long lake, sacred to the Iroquois Confederacy, became polluted by industrial pollution and sewage to the point that by the first half of the twentieth century it was one of the country’s most contaminated waterbodies. My grandfather moved the family to a home on the St. Lucie River in Stuart, Florida in 1952. Little did he know the fate of the Indian River Lagoon. Unlike the St. Lucie, Onondaga Lake has gone from “the butt of one eyed fish jokes” to a lake of beauty, much enjoyed and improved. Let’s hope the St. Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon can do the same.\n\nCarpenter Falls on beautiful Skaneateles Lake was my father’s favorite. It lies in an old growth Hemlock forest towering above the cliffs of Bear Swamp Creek. My dear father passed away in 2022, but I could clearly envision him standing under the falls since he could not swim in Onondaga Lake. It must have been a happy place for him and it was a happy place for me that day too.\n\nThereafter, Ed and I returned to Brewerton and headed west through locks on the Erie Canal, once rapids or waterfalls, taking Finito north at Three Rivers – where we saw our first swan! Once in the Oswego River it became narrow and quiet and I thought about how my reading had taught me that this river, as all between Lake Ontario and the Hudson River, was the lands of the French and Indian War – that of course included the British. This was a time when commerce was motivated by the slaughter of animals for the fur trade. Millions and millions of them…\n\nSometimes history is overwhelming but one can’t close one’s eyes to it. Ed and I were reminded during our visit to Oswego that the city was the ONLY in the U.S. to accept Jews during WWII. The Safe Haven Holocaust Refugee Shelter Museum/Fort Ontario tells this incredible story.\n\nFrom Oswego, Captain Ed, “bow-thusterless,” led Finito through the St. Lawrence River to Clayton, first settled in 1801. It was the main railroad terminus to the 1000 Islands resort region during its heyday of the Gilded Age at the turn of the 20th Century. These rock islands emerge from crystal clear water. Most are forested.\n\nHere the rich and famous built vacation homes – the most famous being Boldt Castle. Within thirty years, Mr. George Boldt, rose from poor Prussian immigrant to fabulously wealthy proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel. Boldt abandoned the castle upon the death of his beloved wife for whom he was building this castle. Lovingly reconstructed by the Thousand Island Bridge Authority, today, the castle is open to all as amazing testament to the spirit of the American Dream and of American history.\n\n72 Days into America’s Great Loop, Every Waterway Has a Story\n\nIt’s 72 days since Ed and I began America’s Great Loop and one thing is certain, everyday is an adventure.\n\nAfter being awestruck by the Statue of Liberty, Ed and I embarked on a portion of the 315 mile long Hudson River. Our destination was Half Moon Bay Marina, named not just for the explorer, but for the ship of 17th century Henry Hudson. Rounding Bear Mountain, the spectacular view of U.S. Military Academy West Point came into view. Ed and I found ourselves standing at attention while looking for remnants of the Continental Army’s iron chain that blocked enemy British ships. The whole scene was amazing.\n\nThe day prior, Ed and I had driven to West Point, coincidentally the day prior to graduation. The campus was filled with graduates-to-be and their parents. It was a privilege to be there and I was struck by the diversity of the students. “How wonderful I thought.” West Point’s museum had stressed the evolution of curriculum due to sweeping revisions and dramatic developments in science and technology- a far cry from putting a chain across the river…\n\nAfter our visit, Ed and I grabbed lunch at a nearby Mexican restaurant. I started thinking environment. “Ed, didn’t the Hudson River have pollution issues? It looks so beautiful today,” I casually said while putting hot sauce on my burrito.\n\n“Yeah,” Ed replied, “it was a Superfund site.”\n\n“A Superfund site?” I gasped, almost choking. “Really?”\n\nBetween 1947 and 1977 General Electric released 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls into the Hudson River – these PCBs were so toxic they were soon banned in the United States. The EPA ended up classifying 200 miles of the Hudson River a federal Superfund site and the upper river’s prolific fishery was closed. General Electric was not the first to pollute the Hudson River. Long before, the Industrial Revolution had led to plants of many kinds. For over a century iron, steel, dye, textile, tanneries, candle, soap and slaughterhouses spewed waste into the gorgeous river.\n\nEd and I talked about this for a long time. “Every water has a story,” Ed said. “The industry gave people jobs.” I decided not to argue and our adventure continued taking trawler Finito from Croton-on -the Hudson (Half Moon Bay Marina) to Kingston; Kingston to Albany; Albany to Waterford; Waterford to Amsterdam; Amsterdam to Little Falls; Little Falls to Sylvan Beach; and Sylvan Beach to Brewerton not far from Lake Ontario.\n\nLooking at the map, beginning east at Troy, Ed and I began our travels west along the Erie Canal through a series of 35 locks. It is at Troy that the Hudson River meets the Erie Canal. What a work out!\n\nFirst completed in 1825, with an elevation of 571 feet above sea level, the canal was the first navigable waterway connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. It brought massive economic success, as always, at the expense of rivers such as the Mohawk in Little Falls. The tiny hamlet once considered “the most beautiful,” had her waterfalls blown up to create her portion of the lock system- the most famous- Lock Number 17 that has a whopping 40 feet difference.\n\nSo far Ed and I have gone through 22 locks and are sitting at another marina, Winter Harbor along the Oneida River. The adventure and our education continues…\n\nA Pictorial History of Palm City, Sandra Thurlow’s insights\n\nToday, I’m sharing a link to my mother‘s recent presentation given at the Blake Library in Stuart. Sandra Thurlow is not only my mother, but also a local celebrity. Her years of research have produced multiple local history books and now she’s working on another of which I am part.\n\nThrough stories and photographs, this video gives many insights into the upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, Florida that will be published by the end of 2024.\n\nThank you to Barbara Osbourn for her gracious introduction, the Martin County Genealogical Society, and Friends of the Martin County Library System for making this talk possible. Please see link below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu2XXH9BxHI\n\n55 Days Settling In, America’s “Beautiful” Great Loop\n\nIt’s May 22, we’re 55 days into America’s beautiful Great Loop! A full moon is rising over New York City and Finito, our trawler, is tucked densely into the Morris Canal at the mouth of the Hudson River. Yesterday, Captain Ed and I left the strong currents of the Manasquan Inlet in New Jersey to meet New York’s Statue of Liberty face to face.\n\nAfter three days of ocean travel, the Dramamine had worn me down magnifying my emotions. Liberty stood there strong and beautiful, a gift from the people of France. She looked even more striking than she must have appeared in 1886. Holding the torch above her head with her right hand, in her left carrying a tablet inscribed July 4, 1776, the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain and shackle lie at her feet as she walks forward in commemoration of the national abolition of slavery following the American Civil War. She of course also later became our icon of freedom welcoming immigrants by sea.\n\nIt was an amazing day. At one point, it was rather chaotic with tour boats, looper boats, ferries, and commercial ships jockeying for space as we waited for an opportunity to have a fellow looper take our photograph before Lady Liberty. My mind has been filled with images. Images that make me look backwards yet forwards. I have been reading Chesapeake by James Michener. Copyrighted in 1978, I remember this famous book at my parent’s bedside. Still a classic, I opened it just about a week ago when we were at the north end of the magnificent 200 mile long Chesapeake Bay. We were taking the C&D Canal from Harve de Grace to Delaware City preparing for our ocean travel to New York. I gushed over the twenty or so Canadian Geese honking by as we disembarked. “Oh look Ed! They are so beautiful!”\n\nBut as I got deeper into Michener I was reminded of the carnage of hundreds of years that led up to this “beautiful” day, changing the ecology and changing the bay – something that I no longer “see.”\n\n~Vast forests, once held in awe by the native people, burned to the ground, deer and beaver displaced, hunted and skinned for trade; the planting of the “stink weed,” the cash crop tobacco, building towering fortunes and powerful families; overfished “unlimited” shad and herring; the crash of the world’s greatest oyster fishery that once took only three to five days to filter all the bay’s water, now impaired; the ravenous consumption of helpless diamond back terrapins for soup; the unregulated mass slaughter of millions and millions of waterfowl; giant ancient sturgeon annihilated for their roe; and the bay’s multitude of the delicious blue crabs finally in decline. Today’s river is pretty but it is plagued by dead zones, algae and reduced productivity. Hard working Chesapeake Bay restoration programs are lauded and a model for the entire county. Yes, “Chesapeake Bay looks beautiful,” but she is damaged. just like the St. Lucie River – Indian River Lagoon.\n\nAcross our lands and waters, across generations – are changing baselines. We accept less as normal, as beautiful. We must continue to do all we can to regain real glory. “Beauty,” by today’s standards, is simply not enough. Liberty must come to Mother Earth.\n\nI try to do my part but I am part of the problem too. “Keep trying,” I say. “Keep trying.”\n\nEd and me? Compared to the days of our Loop departure from Stuart, Florida, on March 28, I am a much more experienced, confident, and stronger, first mate. Ed is a better and more experienced captain. I have come far from the days that I bristled at his commands. We have docked at least 40 times, with only two qualifying as “disastrous,” the others were just “beautiful!”\n\nWell it is beginning to rain and thunder, Okee is looking at me funny again, Luna is barking and the Hudson Valley is shrouded in mist. Another adventure begins…\n\nSince our last post our travels have included:\n\nSolomons Island, Maryland, to Edgewater/Annapolis; Edgewater to St. Michaels; St. Michaels to Harve de Grace; Harve de Grace to Delaware City, Delaware; Delaware City to Cape May, New Jersey; Cape May to Atlantic City; Atlantic City to Manasquan Inlet; Manasquan Inlet to New York City, New York.\n\nLarger Deeper Waters, Day 33 of America’s Great Loop 🇺🇸\n\nIt’s early morning and mirror-like water flows underneath our trawler “Finito.” It is hard to tell where the water stops and where the sky begins. Chesapeake Bay stretches out before us. It is enormous. Today is our 33rd day of 365. I am first mate on our journey, America’s Great Loop.\n\nSo far this morning I have awoken to warmly dress, check the lines, study the current, and review the tides and weather. I’m happy. It’s going to be a beautiful day.\n\nStanding on the floating dock next to laughing gulls and a tall blue heron, Captain Ed and I say farewell to new Looper friends and push off from Yorktown Marina, Virginia. Ed actually complements me on my performance.\n\n“Thanks, but all of the conditions were in our favor,” I reply.\n\nOnly a few days ago we had left Beaufort, North Carolina, a perfect time capsule of a town, and overwhelmed by strong current, barely avoided collision and lost a couple of fenders as we scraped our way forward. Half the community, dockhands, and many tourist looked on wide-eyed as Ed and I lost control of Finito within seconds. With our hearts pounding, Captain Ed and I straddled the Intracoastal markers spaced for cargo ships and barges and continued on our way into the deep Newport River that made the St. Lucie look like a creek.\n\nThere was no anger nor blame. In fact we were completely silent. Mother Nature had beaten us both even though we had been analyzing her for days…\n\nHumbled before Nature – she tempered us.\n\nThe waterways have gotten larger and deeper and more unpredictable. Since I last wrote we have traveled from Beaufort NC to River Dunes; River Dunes to Belhaven; Belhaven to Coinjock; Coinjock to Norfolk; and Norfolk to Yorktown VA.\n\nWaiting and passing through the Great Bridge Locks on the old Albemarle-Chesapeake Canal caused Ed and me reflect on the hardships of soldiers who fought in the Revolutionary War, their battlefield nearby. A complete wilderness, not much different today, but for tugs pushing barges. Not far from here lies the Dismal Swamp where thousands of escaped slaves found shelter during the Civil War.\n\nSlowly, we had entered the Pamlico and the Pungo Rivers, next, Albermarte Sound. Rough and windy weather had overtaken us and always the optimist I worried the hull would burst open. Ed rolled his eyes and carefully came off the fly bridge into the pilot house as waves crashed over the boat. I put on my life jacket.\n\n“I hope we don’t lose an engine,” I thought rejudging my size as I moved about the cabin. Okee and Luna were sitting up straight. They were doing well but confused by the pounding. After about two hours, it passed…\n\nNorfolk, Virginia, the world’s largest naval base lie before us. Warships and aircraft carriers lined the Elizabeth River. Ed skillfully made his way giving way. I stood on the bow awe struck.\n\nFrom Norfolk we traveled to Yorktown, part of America’s historic triangle along with Jamestown and Willamsburg. We could see the monument from afar, beckoning. Slowly Lady Justice came into view as we entered port. What an experience it would be to step upon the hallowed ground where America gained her independence. 🇺🇸\n\nThe making of a 1st-mate, Day 23 of America’s Great Loop\n\nIt is day 23 of at least 365 on America’s Great Loop. At this point, with bruised arms and sore elbows, I am a bonafide first-mate and have learned to take orders. Every day, I assist my captain. I check diesel levels, I peer intently through binoculars looking for Intracoastal triangles, announce distant shoaling, man the lines, drop the fenders, and sometimes even take the wheel. I have accepted my fate ~ ￼I am not in charge.\n\nHowever, Captian Ed and I have re-bonded through my acceptance of this simple but profound concept, one I never did accept in the 20 years of our marriage. I’ve decided it’s OK for now. 🙂\n\nLife has changed. Every day chores like doing laundry, fixing a leaky sink, or vacuuming have become endearing. Kind of like being in college again. Serious decisions have given way to listening and discussion. We are becoming a team. How long this new peace-pact will last, I am not certain. But on our 55 foot trawler, “Finito,”we live day by day; it’s slow and beautiful.\n\nThe low country of the Carolina coast is defined by marshlands and the American history of the Deep South. These marshes fed the riches of cotton, indigo and rice plantations. The Gullah culture of former slaves resonates, though the area is now covered with golf courses and subdivisions.\n\nThe marshes themselves are habitat to hundreds of aquatic organisms, birds, and animal species. Connected to countless river estuaries, they are the nursery to the sea. Polluted stormwater, groundwater contamination, and developmental habitat destruction have negatively affected some areas. To the untrained eye, like mine, it looks relatively healthy. Of course, turn of the century dredging of the Intracoastal Waterway created our “Great Loop” roadway.\n\nSince my last post Ed and I have traveled from Hilton Head to Port Royal; Port Royal to Charleston; Charleston to Georgetown; Georgetown to Myrtle Beach; Myrtle Beach to Southport; Southport to Wrightsville; and Wrightsville to Swansboro.\n\nMy uncle reminded me that my Henderson ancestors traveled up North Carolina’s Cape Fear River where they settled near Campbelton, the same Scottish settlement name as the town they’d left in the 1770s. I picture them taking a ferry through the reed filled marshes, or a cypress black river, the tides washing away the hardships of the old-world and bringing hope for life anew.\n\n13 days in on America’s Great Loop\n\nEd and I are 13 days in on America’s Great Loop. 300 miles of 5600. I have stopped wearing makeup. I’ve worn the same clothes for at least 10 days. I’ve taken three showers. I’ve washed my hair twice. I’ve gotten pretty good at “manning” the lines and pulling up or putting down the giant fenders. I’m sleeping better than I ever recall. So far, it’s been an absolutely amazing and challenging trip.\n\nI am the first mate. That means that I have to do what the captain, my husband Ed, tells me to. This is challenging. And we have had a few heated discussions. We have with us our 12 year old Belgium Shepherd, Luna, and our 3 year old cat, Okee. They are great company and Okee is definitely now a therapy cat.\n\nThis boat trip is supposed to last about one year. Ed retired, and I was not reconfirmed by the Senate for the South Florida Water Management District governing board, nor reappointed by the Governor. Thus, this long journey seemed a perfect thing to do. Time for Ed and I to spend some quality time together. As we all know, “time is of the essence.”\n\nSo far, our trip has been Stuart to Vero, Vero to Titusville, Titusville to Ponce Inlet, Ponce Inlet to Saint Augustine, Saint Augustine to Fernandina, Fernandina to Jekyll Island, Jekyll Island to Sunbury, and Sunbury to Isle of Hope. Today we are headed to Beaufort, South Carolina, hopefully, weather is to arrive and last for two or three days.\n\n“Wow these crab traps are close together aren’t they?” Sorry we’re approaching Savannah. We just went past Thunderbolt Marina and these crab traps are like, oh my gosh, they’re like you have to weave through them!\n\nThe wildlife has been wonderful. My favorite so far are the white pelicans sitting marsh side in groups of 25 or so. They have the second largest wingspan of any bird in North America 9-10 feet. Only the California Condor’s is larger.\n\nThe trees too have also been an inspiration. Oaks, slash pines, red cedar, and magnolia. Their births holding the rings of hundreds of years. I look up into their highest branches ridiculously trying to capture their spirt within the rectangle of my iPhone.\n\nI’ve been trying to learn about water issues and I have. Most in Georgia are caused by industrial point source pollution and none have been as tragic as the 100 year destruction of the St. Lucie River. Discharges from Lake Okeechobee should be considered point source pollution too.\n\nThe serpentine waterways of north Florida and especially Georgia have been just mind boggling . The tide is like a slow breath through the marsh purifying and renewing the ecosystem – oysters, crabs, frogs, alligators, mink, otter and many species of fish. The highest tidal range has been 8 feet!\n\nI’m hoping that this peregrination teaches me something about myself, my marriage, and the history and environmental issues of our great country. Then when I return home, I know I will be renewed.\n\nBut I am paying attention.\n\nI noticed yesterday that Governor DeSantis came to a Cove Road Walgreens to sign off on a shoplifting legislative bill with harsher penalties for those who steal. I was surprised he didn’t also mention Martin County’s recent “Lost Spring” due to discharges from Lake Okeechobee. That was stealing too. While I’m on the subject, there was not a peep from Senator Gayle Harrell, or Representatives Overdorf or Snyder about the Lake O discharges either. I suppose Tallahassee leadership has asked that “we just not talk about it.” God forbid…\n\nThe Lost Towering Pine Forests of St. Lucie\n\nGigantic old-growth slash pines, with all the glory to be called “longleaf pine,” stood right here in the St. Lucie River region of Stuart, Palm, City, Indiantown, Jensen, and Hobe Sound. Eagles built massive nests in their crowns. Fox squirrels as large as cats leapt through their branches. Black bears stopped to scratch their backs against wide and furrowed bark. Stealthy panthers and long-legged bobcats silently crept over pine needles in search of turkeys, deer, and wild hog. The endless knocking of the red-cockaded woodpecker echoed throughout until humankind’s insatiable demand for lumber and turpentine brought these forests down.\n\nMy mother, historian Sandra Thurlow, recently has been amazed by her friend Tootsie’s Facebook pictures! I am sharing more today. In her research, mom also found a column of the late Ernie Lyons, award winning Stuart News editor and writer from 1931-1975. His words pulled from the dust give new life to what once was all around us-something once so wonderful that we don’t even know existed anymore – the great pine forests. As a certified tree hugger, with a tear in my eye, I share Tootsie’s local historic Hill photos together with mom’s discovery of Ernie Lyon’s column. Together they tell the story of our lost forests, a story we must never forget.\n\nAccording to “The Atlas of Florida,” 1992: “Pines, especially long leaf and slash, accounted for three-fourths of the state’s original 25-30 million acres of forests.\n\nHistoric Hill Photos Planning 1923 “Stuart Deepwater Harbor”\n\nIt is sobering to study history. So many of our region’s early dreams, desires, and economics were tied to the St. Lucie Canal (1916-1924) and also building a gigantic deep water harbor, “Port Stuart,” just inside the St. Lucie Inlet that would have been located in the region of Sewall’s Point and Salerno’s Manatee Pocket. Because of local resident, Mrs. Tootsie Kindberg, who shared her rare Hill Florida Photographic Concern collection, we now have major insight into this era.\n\nFor context, in a January 11, 1923 Stuart News article entitled “For All Florida,” Stanley Kitching, president of the Stuart Commercial Club, speaks of the importance of sharing these photographs. Kitching argues the photographs prove need to the U.S. Government for a port to help extract the untaped riches of the St. Lucie region- as this deep water port or harbor would be connected not only to the St. Lucie Canal, but also to Lake Okeechobee.\n\nIn support of her friend Tootsie, my mother historian Sandra Thurlow has transcribed a Stuart Messenger article written on January 18, 1923. It is a documentation of the meeting with the U.S. government about funding the deepwater harbor. The attendee read like a “who’s who list.” Although this dream did not materialize in full, thankfully, it must be studied.\n\nI want to thank Mrs. Tootsie Haggard Kindberg who shared her family’s historic photos that were the inspiration for this post. Please look through them and read the article! Looking backwards, we can more clearly navigate what lies before us. To have these photographs all in one place in a very scattered world is a gift. Thank you Mrs. Kindberg!\n\nENGINEERS HEAR PROOF OF THE NEED OF INLET OPENING\n\n“100 Year Anniversary of the St. Lucie Canal,” a pamphlet\n\nI had a goal last year, and that goal was to start writing a book on the history of the St. Luice Canal. I was very fortunate to have plenty of support with materials from the Jacksonville Army Corp of Engineers, the South Florida Water Management District, Dr. Gary Goforth, my mother, historian Sandra Thurlow, and my brother Todd Thurlow, author of the eyeonlakeo website. I started with a series of blog posts in 2023 that helped me get oriented.\n\nBy June 19, 2023, after over four years of dedicated service, I had not been reconfirmed by the Senate or reappointed by the Governor to the Governing Board of the South Florida Water Management District. As usual, I had spoken up and ruffled feathers; this time in my opposition to Senate Bill 2508. I was crushed but proud not to have been intimidated by power, or to have conformed to something less than what I believed in. I left with my soul intact as an outspoken and passionate advocate for the St. Lucie River, for that and for my service I am grateful.\n\nDuring that difficult time of transition, my mother, as she has done multiple times in my life, provided opportunity and direction. “Jacqui I am going to write a book on the history of Palm City, would you co-author with me?” I was stunned as I knew nothing about Palm City except it was a cow pasture when I was a kid, but I did know something about the St. Lucie Canal and C-23 Canals that have absolutely shaped Palm City. Mom and I have been working for almost a year now and the book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, will be published by the end of 2024. So, I never wrote my book on the history of the St. Lucie Canal, but I was able to participate in something much more valuable, working together and learning from my amazing mother.\n\nAbout a month ago, I put together this general information pamphlet entitled “100 Year Anniversary of the St. Lucie Canal.” Yes, it has been 100 years!\n\nThis light pamphlet is coming in handy, perhaps even more than a book, during this 2024 round of Lake Okeechobee discharges. I know we are all saddened by the continued degradation of our waters. The way I look at it is that environmental issues are cultural issues taking centuries to change. We are and have been part of that change. Never be discouraged when you are on the right side of history! ~Copies are available at the Stuart Heritage Museum or just call me at 772-486-3818.\n\nL.O. Discharge Aerial Update 3-4-24\n\nYesterday, March 4, 2024 around 11:00am, my husband Ed flew Captain’s for Clean Water videographer Noah Miller over the St. Lucie River and Indian River Lagoon. Noah and his community, on the west coast of South Florida, share in the adversity of Lake Okeechobee discharges. The Caloosahatchee is our sister river and has been for 100 years.\n\nThis year heavy discharges to the St. Lucie began February 17, 2024. There was a reprieve for four days, and then the discharges started again on Saturday, March 2nd. Thus these aerials were taken only two days after the estuary had a four day break from her killer. He let her catch her breath, and then it began again…\n\nToday salinity is only 4.4 at the Roosevelt Bridge as documented by my brother Todd’s website eyeonlakeo!\n\nToday, I am sharing some of the photographs that Ed took. There were 92 and I have paired them down; however, in many cases, especially the bare seagrass meadows, I have included multiple shots. I was also struck by the composition of the lands: Sewall’s Point, Hell’s Gate, Hutchinson Island, Stuart, Rocky Point, Jensen, Rio, Palm City, the St. Lucie Inlet State Park and the St. Lucie Inlet. A puzzle sculpted by time. Such a magnificent place! With the marriage of temperate and tropic zones, this area was once considered “the most bio-diverse estuary in North America,” as documented by famous fish scientists like Dr. Grant Gilmore. But over the years, especially since 2013, the St. Lucie has been ravaged by wretchedly dark polluted water from Lake Okeechobee and cyanobacteria known commonly as “toxic algae.”\n\nWhen things seems hopeless or decades away, what can one do?\n\nContinue to shine the light…\n\n~Noah Miller of Captains for Clean Water takes video as Ed pilots the plane, a Van’s RV. ~Bird Island, below, sits off Sewall’s Point, with over 17 threatened/endangered species. This is nesting time but there is little food to feed the chicks.\n\nBelow are ACOE discharge release schedules. Discharges are determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in consultation with the South Florida Water Management District that acts as the “local sponsor” of the Central and South Florida Project both agencies manage. Years ago, there was little awareness or care about the destruction of the environment, but today we know better. The waste of fresh water into the ocean, the absolute carnage caused to the St. Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon, fish, benthic creatures, oysters, birds, mammals depending on food from it, not to mention the slow death caused to our near shore reefs–today this kind of water management is unacceptable. Try as we may for something better, we are not achieving it fast enough to leave future generations here anything but an empty cornucopia.\n\nPalm City’s Once Wonderful Sailfish Lodge\n\n~ A tidbit from our upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, Florida, Sandra Thurlow & Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch\n\nIts brochure read: “Off the Highway and out of town. Sailfish Lodge. No train noises. No Highway traffic roar. Across the bridge from Stuart’s shopping area, railroad, bus station and theatre. At our club dock, you may obtain boats for river fishing. By the week. By the month. For a joyous season. Vacation in comfort.”\n\nSailfish Lodge was built by Linwood Simmons. It stood on 26 acres acquired in 1946. The acreage included 300 feet of waterfront with a view over Palm City Bay looking to the Palm City Bridge.\n\nCottages were built in 1946 and the lodge itself in 1948. The lodge was two story and measured 35 by 155 feet featuring a gigantic fireplace. Visiting sportsmen were offered access to both fresh and saltwater fishing and hunters were provided with a woods buggy and guides.\n\nIt was a family affair and just about everything they needed was right there. Pine trees on the property even supplied the building lumber. The Simmons family operated the lodge for 20 years. It was beloved and popular. Mr. and Mrs. Simmons grew old, and their children grew up on this fabulous Palm City property.\n\nBy 1969, Mrs. Simmons passed and Mr. Simmons later moved to Winter Haven; the property was sold.\n\nIn today’s world where “Brightline trains abound and traffic roars louder with every new commissioner-approved development,” the Sailfish Lodge reminds us of a quieter time, a joyous time, when Martin County’s woods and rivers were unspoiled and everything else seemed so very far away…\n\n~Thank you to friend, Brian Sullivan, who shared the historic Sailfish Lodge publicity pamphlet inspiring this post.\n\nBeautiful Weather – Hideous Water\n\nIt is absolutely beautiful outside. There is not a cloud in the sky, humidity is low, the temperature is perfect, and for all the wading birds and fishes “spring has sprung.” They are excitedly searching for food, but there is little to be found. In the past week, salinity has dropped like a rock and a swift current of filth is pushing towards the St. Luice Inlet.\n\nBoating? Are you kidding? I guess you can, but don’t let your kids swim in the water. Dive the nearshore reefs? I don’t think so!\n\nThese aerial photographs were taken just eight days after Lake Okeechobee discharges began into the St. Lucie River. The Army Corps of Engineers with the agreement of their local sponsor, the South Florida Water Management District, endorsed the high level discharges though S-80 to begin on 2-17-24.\n\nToday’s photos were taken yesterday, 2-25-24, around 4pm, by Ed Lippisch and Jay Knobel. I am sharing all photographs for purposes of reference and documentation. The fight goes on as it has for 100 years.

Danforth\n\n~ A tidbit from our upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, Florida, by Sandra Thurlow & Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch\n\nOne of early Palm City’s most interesting characters is John S. Danforth. He was a true “man’s man,” kind of like Ernest Hemingway. Danforth was a writer, a hunter, an avid outdoorsman, and really an entrepreneur. Today, there remains a creek, among other landmarks still holding his name.\n\nAccording to my mother, John Danforth started modestly with a floating cabin that eventually became one of the earliest hunting lodges in the country, “Camp Caribou.” It added to his reputation as a “knowledgeable and charismatic sportsman’s host and guide.” This success led him to leave Maine in 1892 and with his friends bring a “floating hotel” to the shores of the St. Luice River where Palm City would be born.\n\nDansforth chose to came to the St. Lucie region for its wildlife, “endless” hunting, and other opportunities lying within an untouched wilderness of slash pine forests, palmetto, river, slough and ponds; a perfect habitat for deer, bears, panthers, turkeys, hogs, raccoons, flying squirrels, birds, small fur-bearing mammals, fish and critters of all kinds!\n\nDanforth made friends with the Seminole Indians especially famous Tom Tiger, leader of the Gopher Clan. They hunted the region of the St. Luice as well as going deeper into the lower Everglades. Danforth wrote about these experiences in widely distributed hunting magazines. He wrote because he loved it and to attract others to this St. Lucie/Palm City paradise and gateway to Lake Okeechobee and the inner Everglades.\n\nEven though as an avid animal lover it breaks my heart, I am going to include Danforth’s article that will be in my mother and my upcoming book because it is important documentation. It is entitled “Two Christmas Hunts.” It is written about Danforth’s hunting experience with the goal to kill a panther as led by Tom Tiger. The article appeared in “Shooting and Fishing” No. 9 on December 14, 1899 and is a testament to those times. A time when South Florida, including Palm city was a wildlife wilderness.\n\n~John Danforth is buried beside his loving wife, Sarah, in Fernhill Cemetery, Highway 76, Stuart, Florida.\n\nValentine’s Day Discharge Announcement\n\nYesterday, on Valentine’s Day, the estuaries did not receive sweet news. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, working to manage water together with their local sponsor, the South Florida Water Management District, announced that they will begin significant discharges (1800+/- cfs) from Lake Okeechobee (16.37 ft.) beginning Saturday, 2-17-24.\n\nThe aerials below taken by my husband, Ed Lippisch, on 2-14-24 around noon, 30 minutes before high tide, can serve as a baseline for comparison as our waters decline.\n\nPresently, there is no representation on the South Florida Water Management District governing board as far as a traditional sitting Martin County representative. Appointed in 2019 by Governor DeSantis, I was removed in June 2023, really due to the power of the President of the Senate and those influencing her, for comments I made at a governing board meeting in February of 2022 in response to Senate Bill 2508, a bill undermining the District, water control, and the EAA Reservoir. In the the following months, I was not reappointed, as I could have been, by Governor DeSantis, nor was anyone else. Thus the seat sits open at this critical time. I believe I was removed not just because of my comments, but because of my knowledge and my record for speaking the truth. By a long and cruel silence we are being punished.\n\nI will continue to advocate with the pen and with my voice for the St. Lucie River as I have since 2008 when I first became a Town of Sewall’s Point Commissioner and began to learn the dark history of Florida’s water policy. I want to thank the thousands of people and the many organizations who have helped in this battle. We must continue to “shine the light” and change water policy for the better as we have done and will continue to do. As we know, it’s a long and rocky ride.\n\n~Jacqui\n\nA few of the ACOE Periodic Scientist Call slides 2-14-24 that I screenshot\n\nPalm City’s 1914 Post Office, “You’ve got mail!”\n\n~ A tidbit from our upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, Florida, by Sandra Thurlow & Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch\n\n“You’ve got mail.”\n\nIn Palm City, in 1914, no one would have imagined email, texts, or cell phones. “Mail” meant a handwritten letter inside an envelope, one that may have been sent from very far away. One from a dear family member or an old friend. One about business opportunities. Having a post office was very important.\n\nGeorge Washington Jones signed the application for the Palm City Post Office on April 14, 1914. It was located inside his general merchandise store near Palmetto Street that later became Martin Downs Boulevard. Mr. Jones was postmaster, a very prestigious and important position in the growing community.\n\nIt has been said that: “The history of the post office is the story of America.” Palm City’s post office played a chief role in bringing more people to the area. Letters from settlers shared information encouraging others to join them in Chillingworth’s remote Palm City Farms. One could call the post office, the “social media” of the day.\n\nIn this plat map from the 1920s it shows the location of the post office marked by a red dot. The St. Luice River and rudimentary bridge would be located to the east. Today we take such things for granted, but not in those days of yesteryear. The Palm City Post Office was a key place, a place where people came to get the “news of the day” or a “letter from a friend.”‘ Now we just look at our cell phones. Personally, I think I would rather sit, gossip, and wait on the porch at the old post office!\n\nMarketing Palm City Farms, father/developer C. C. Chillingworth\n\n~ A tidbit from our upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, Florida, by Sandra Thurlow & Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch\n\n~Charles Curtis Chillingworth, 1868-1936, was born in Liverpool, New York and passed away in West Palm Beach, Florida. Pictured below at 45 years old, second from left, front row.\n\nAlligator Smith aside, it is Charles Curtis Chillingworth “distinguished pioneer, citizen, attorney and developer,” who must be recognized as the “father/founder” of Palm City and Palm City Farms. In the early 1900s western Palm City Farms was sold in ten acre plots with a small bonus lot in what was termed Palm City on the St. Lucie. Today I am going to share a bit about Chillingworth the man, and how his development was marketed.\n\nIn my reading, I came to especially like Chillingworth because his autobiography notes his appreciation of nature, including the beauty of Florida’s iconic cabbage palm trees.\n\n“As I remember of it, I left Atlanta one evening about the middle of October, 1891, and reached Jacksonville the following morning. Later that day I took a train on the old Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad, now the Atlantic Coast Line, which runs on the west side of the St. Johns River. I changed cars at Enterprise Junction for Titusville. That evening with the sun in the west just before sunset, I saw the first cabbage palmetto trees I ever saw in my life, and they made a great impression on me….”\n\nSo how did he come to develop Palm City Farms?\n\nChillingworth a young, hard working lawyer, eventually learned about lands west of the St. Luice River and wanted a part of development himself.\n\nAs he put it:\n\n“In 1909 a real estate boom sprung up in South Florida, especially in the purchase of sale of large tracts of land.”\n\nAfter much back and forth, Chillingworth took title to at least 12,000 acres from the Florida Coast Line Canal & Transportation Company. He then opened the Palm Beach Land Company in Stuart in 1911, because at that time what became Martin County lie in Palm Beach County, and Stuart had a small downtown area.\n\nChillingworth explains who helped him market the lands giving insight into those times:\n\n“I took with me Miss Reilly, who had been my stenographer in New York during that summer. She was a most faithful and efficient helper and I made her Assistant Secretary of the new Company…”\n\nYears later after Chillingworth’s death, Miss Reilly, now married as “Patsy Reilly McCord,” wrote a 1964 piece for the Stuart News about how Palm City Farms and Palm City on the St. Lucie were marketed. It is fascinating to read her account. Then, like now, it was not just the natural resources of the land, but of course also the beauty of the St. Lucie River that “sold” newcomers.\n\nPatsy (Reilly) McCord wrote::\n\n“The sale of land progressed, and in order to entertain the prospective purchasers, the Palm City Land Company purchased boats and automobiles and mule teams and large comfortable covered wagons for use in displaying the wonders of the rivers, ocean and plantations. The Palm Beach land Company took care of all prospective buyers by entertaining them and paying all expenses of their visit, while here, consisting of boat trips to the inlet, trips out the North and South Forks as well as wagon trips to different points of interest in the county, winding up with a trip to Palm Beach.\n\nIn those days, the waters of the St. Lucie were salty, (the inlet had been opened in 1892 and the St. Lucie Canal was not completed until 1924) and at night the water was so full of phosphorus the millions of fish looked like millions of streaks of lighting darting through the water. It was a wonderful sight in those days to be on the river in the darkness.”\n\nWOW! It must have been beautiful!\n\nThe maps below will help you see the location of Palm City Farms and Palm City. I hope you enjoyed today’s “tidbit.”\n\nExpresso-Turquoise Waters\n\nEye in the Sky…\n\nEye on Lake O…\n\n~Expresso and turquoise waters converge near the St. Luice Inlet and the confluence of St. Lucie River/ Indian River Lagoon, as seen on February 1, 2024. Even with no major discharges from Lake Okeechobee since 2018, dark waters from rain runoff and area canals remain apparent.\n\nWhen I asked Ed to take more varied shots of St. Luice, he said this is difficult due to being in a restricted air space during takeoff and landing. Also, unlike days of past, there are many airplanes and jets coming in and out of Witham Field.\n\nLake O is currently at 16.30 feet and we are experiencing a “strong El Nino” which means “rain.”\n\nMaybe I’ll go up with Ed soon and try for some long range photographs. I have only been up in the Vans RV once, last June, and brought my barf bag! It was actually a wonderful flight.\n\n~Aerials were taken 2-1-24 at approximately 12:30pm by Ed Lippisch.\n\n~Images below are complements of South Florida System Update, Department of Environmental Protection, 1-31-24.\n\n~Lake O\n\nBlue Green Algae: South Florida System Update 01-31-2024\n\nPrediction/El Nino conditions 1 and 3 months\n\n~SFWMD Rainfall data and link\n\nPalm City’s Real Founding Father, “Alligator Smith”\n\nIn my previous blog post announcing my mother’s and my upcoming book, A Pictorial History of Palm City, I told the story of Palm City’s very interesting early homesteader, Alligator Smith. Today I will share another tidbit – how Palm City’s creation is connected to Smith, and how his 1891 “state of intoxication and drowning” in the St. Luice River inadvertently led to C.C. Chillingworth becoming the known founding father of Palm City Farms in 1911.\n\nIn 1891 C.C. Chillingworth was a young lawyer at Robbins and Graham soon to be working in Juno, the county seat of Dade County.\n\nChillingworth’s second case was civil in the United States Land Office. In those days thousands of acres of land were open for homestead-entry but one had to reside on the land for two years. It was Chillingworth’s job to prove that William M. Smith, locally known along the St. Luice as “Alligator Smith,” had “not abandoned” his 160 acre homestead, on the west side of the river. By law, a six month abandonment caused the homestead to revert back to the federal government.\n\nChillingworth’s autobiography written in his later years states:\n\n“We were engaged about a week in taking testimony at Pottsdam, now known as Stuart and I had been unable to prove that Smith had been spending any time on the homestead during six months. Smith was drunk and fell overboard from a boat in the St. Lucie River on July 4, 1891. However when I began to check on the testimony and prepare a brief for the Register of the U.S. Land Office at Gainesville, Florida, I discovered that Smith had died just one day less than six months after he made entry.”\n\nSmith seemed to have lost his homestead by one day!\n\nThe case was appealed to the General Land Office in Wahington D.C. and to the Secretary of the Interior, but in the end Chillingworth prevailed. According to my mother, the Bureau of Land Management documented that a Mr. George Mulligan ended up with Alligator Smith’s former homestead. How, we will never know!\n\nThese “coveted and valuable lands” located on the west side of the South Fork of the St. Lucie River are connected to today’s Palm City Farms developed in 1911 by none other that C. C. Chillingworth. Chillingworth’s familiarly with the lands of Alligator Smith inspired Chillingworth to develop Palm City Farms twenty years later. Without Alligator Smith, there would be no Palm City. I think we can say, Alligator Smith is Palm City’s real founding father!\n\nPalm City’s First Homesteader, Alligator Smith\n\nPalm City’s First Homesteader, Alligator Smith\n\n“And the Palm Tree Nodded to the Mirror in the Jungle.” Ormond, Florida. Stereoscope c. late 1800s, Thurlow collection.\n\nOver the past year, I have been doing something wonderful. I have been working on a book about Palm City, Florida, with my mother, Sandra Henderson Thurlow to be entitled A Pictorial History of Palm City. We are having it proofed and edited now; it will be published sometime in late 2024. In the meanwhile, I am going to share some tidbits.\n\nHave you ever wondered who was the first modern character of Palm City? He was a trapper. An alligator hunter who more than likely, over time, killed thousands of alligators selling their teeth of fine ivory to make jewelry. The trapper’s name? Of course, Alligator Smith!\n\nApparently, Alligator Smith was very well liked and fraternized with the likes of now famous names of our area such as Bessey, Stypmann and Krueger. However, my mother and I had different feelings towards Alligator Smith. I was really not fond of him and felt like “he got what he had coming to him,” when he died on July 4th, 1891 in a state of intoxication, falling off his boat, Magic, and drowning in the St. Luice River off of Sewall’s Point.\n\nMom saw him as a suvivalist. My thoughts? Perhaps after killing so many alligators on a river once named “Halpatiokee” which means “alligator waters” in a native tongue,“ the spirit of the river may have decided to take Alligator Smith home.\n\nHis real name was “William Smith” and he was working to obtain his homestead from the federal government at today’s Pendarvis Cove. As you’ll learn in the next post, “his lands” inadvertently seeded the creation of “Palm City.”\n\nEl Nino, Lake Okeechobee, and the St. Lucie River\n\nEl Nino has not given us many sunny Florida days this winter; however, there have been a few. These aerials taken by my husband Ed Lippisch on January 10, 2024, around noon are an example of a rare sunny day. As mentioned in my last post, Lake Okeechobee has not been discharged to the St. Luice River heavily since 2018. Today, on 1-13-23, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, Lake Okeechobee is sitting at 16.06 feet. You can see from the 2024 chart below how the lake is creeping up since the new year. The 2023 chart below it, reveals numbers sometimes over 16 feet as well. There are a number of things causing uncertainly regarding lake operations. But on January 16th, 2024 the ACOE Periodic Scientist Call will occur. At this time we will get a clue of the fate of the St. Lucie. Hopefully nothing will change. Until then, you can go to eyeonlakeo.com and watch the numbers in close to real time while you email your favorite elected official.\n\n~ACOE\n\n~All aerials below were taken 1-10-23, Ed Lippisch\n\n~St. Lucie Inlet with rain plume\n\n~Looking west over Hutchinson Island, Sewall’s Point and Stuart.

Part of the library system, its “mission is to encourage the appreciation of Martin County’s unique history by collaborating with community members and local organizations to collect, present, and interpret relevant digital content.”\n\nSome of the first cultural documents digitized at the encouragement of historian Sandra Thurlow were the old Martin County Chamber of Commerce Fishing Guides. I know many of my readers will appreciate these historic documents!\n\nHere is a page from the 1935 fishing guide noting the St. Lucie River was “the Fishing Grounds of Presidents.” Pretty amazing all things considered today!\n\nA list of fish and the artwork of the 1935 cover note fish that are still found in the area but in much lesser quantities.\n\nClick here to see a pdf. version of the 1935 Fishing Guide’s Entire Document.\n\nClick here to see the Fishing Guide of 1935 and other Collections\n\nI hope this is just the beginning of your learning about Martin Digital History!\n\nIt’s a Beautiful New Year\n\nOn December 31st, the eve of 2024, Ed photographed our region. On a bright sunny day after the settling of heavy El Nino rains, the camera revealed a world of beauty. Stubborn water quality problems and lack of seagrass habitat for wildlife persist but we are thankful for policy shifts that since 2019, have spared the St. Luice River major damaging, toxic discharges from Lake Okeechobee, and it shows.\n\nEl Nino’s guaranteed rains through spring, an entrenched legislative culture of protections for agriculture and development, and a lake sitting today at 15.97 will make this blue beauty difficult to hold.\n\nBut for today, it is a beautiful new year. Happy 2024 to everyone and may we continue to to speak out at any cost and may we continue to shine the light.

Why?\n\n“Until the public is able to understand how all of this stuff works, we’re never going to have accountability,” said Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisch, SFWMD Governing Board member 2019-2023. ~Article TCPalm “Florida’s BMAPs are Failing”\n\nLiteracy. It is the key to all things. Being able to read and understand allows one to SEE for oneself what works and what is broken. The Florida BMAP public process is broken. BMAP reports on “improving waterways” are painfully complicated and pollution is increasing not lessening. When the state legislature does not meet its goals dependent on the Department of Environmental Protection, the South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Department of Agriculture, politicians simply push deadlines into the future because BMAPs read like a foreign language and thus accountability by the public is impossible.\n\nNow that will change.\n\nTodd Thurlow, Eye on Lake O, has created “Water Data Maps” that are readable and easily show pollution levels so we can SEE the nitrogen and phosphorus killing our waterways and where it is coming from. We don’t need 15 years. We don’t need 30 years. We can see it today, for action today!

But good days during winter are not enough and we did not see one manatee. There is a long way to go and all is contingent on the state really getting on top of water quality issues which I plan to write a lot more about next year.\n\nToday, as we approach Christmas, I share to inspire joy.

I am sure they were saying: “Happy Holidays and thanks for protecting the IRL!”\n\nDeviation for Water Conservation Areas – will this recipe help the St. Lucie?\n\nYesterday the Army Corps of Engineers announced that they will be allowing a deviation in operations for the Water Conservation Areas. You may recall my recent posts about the high water levels in the manmade, levied water conservation areas and the dangers to wildlife and tree islands and the fact that when they are “full” it is not possible to “send water south” to the Everglades National Park from Lake Okeechobee….\n\n~NRP report\n\n-which means that if the Lake is filling up the St. Lucie River is closer to being discharged to. Today according to the South Florida Water Management District the lake sits at 16.01 feet. If indeed the present strong El Nino unleashes torrents of rain this winter, as it already did on November 15, 2023, or even if not, and the ACOE wants to “plan” by sending non- toxic algae lake water to the estuaries before summer, we are hosed.\n\nWhy? Because the system was built that way. It was built to favor some and hurt others, to protect the Everglades Agricultural Area and South Florida from flooding by draining Lake Okeechobee into the St. Luice and Calooshahatchee.\n\nOK. A lot of issues were accepted from the late 1800s through 1948 when the Central and Southern Florida Plan was built. That does not mean it is acceptable today. There are options that would greatly improve the situation, like having everyone including the EAA sugar lands hold water on their lands instead of using the lake like a pond at a homeowner’s association to irrigate their lawn! This is 2024 almost!\n\nIt is appreciated that the ACOE is allowing a deviation for the Water Conservation Areas and of course the animals and tree islands must be helped too. But we must realize this it is not enough to save the the St. Lucie River that is almost dead as it is. No false hope.\n\nIt’s time for a new recipe!\n\nWe are Thankful to Share A View From Above, by Jacqui & Ed\n\nThanksgiving is approaching and it is time to reflect. Ed and I are grateful.

The SFWMD had a few hiccups due to the contractor and Covid but is now “back on track.” This reservoir will be gigantic. According to the ACOE it is located on 10,700 acres of former farmland in Hendry County, Florida, west of Labelle, the Caloosahatchee River West Basin Storage (C-43) Reservoir will hold approximately 170,000 acre-feet of water, with the maximum depth ranging from 15 feet to 25 feet. To compare, the C-44 Reservoir in Martin County is on 3000 acres and should hold 15 feet too.\n\nC-43 RESERVOIR\n\nIDS_DRAFT_090123_FOR PRINTING\n\nLAKE OKEECHOBEE\n\nC-44 RESERVOIR\n\nST. LUICE RIVER/IRL\n\nCome Hear Merritt Matheson Speak About Martin County Forever!\n\nThursday, November 16, at the Rivers Coalition meeting held at the Stuart City Commission Chambers, 121 SW Flagler Avenue, 11am, Merritt Matheson will present. Matheson, from the famous Matheson family, was once a commissioner for the City of Stuart himself. Now serving on the Indian River Keeper Board of Directors and the Rivers Coalition, he is continuing his good work as a face for MARTIN COUNTY FOREVER.\n\nYou may have heard of it?\n\nIf not, I’ll share a bit of what I have learned to wet your whistle, and I encourage everyone to attend the meeting in person or Zoom. (For Zoom mail Info@RiversCoalition.org or call 772-225-6849)\n\nCheck out these links:\n\nFacbook MCForever\n\nWebsite MCForever\n\nDigital Brochure\n\nWe all know the county is rapidly being developed. It’s hard to watch.\n\nIf Martin County Forever gets supported by the Martin County Commission to go on the the ballot for voters to decide whether to support land acquisition, Martin County Forever can offset that loss. Martin County has already done a great job acquiring lands in the past. I think people will support Martin County Forever as it will only be about land acquisition. As the land so the water…\n\nAccording to Martin County Forever literature, over 116,000 acres have been identified on the Martin County Land Acquisition Map (above). In years past, with community support, about 61% or (71,000) acres were acquired, leaving approximately 46,000 acres left that can still be acquired. Target areas include Blueways, the Indian River Lagoon watershed, Loxa-Lucie and Pal-Mar. These are beautiful areas that need to be saved and could become part of a so needed east coast wildlife corridor. The only lands for consideration are those eligible for state funding to match due to previous designations.\n\nI commend Merritt for his conservation work and for never, never, never giving up! I hope you can join him.\n\nAll slides and photographs courtesy of the MC Forever website and FB page.\n\n“A View From Above” by Jacqui & Ed Lippisch\n\nThe Dolphins are Jumping but no False Hope!\n\nEd and I just got off a seven day journey on “Finito.” We traveled along the Indian River Lagoon from Stuart to Cape Canaveral and only turned around due to a fuel leak that was heroically brought to our attention our eighty pound Belgium Shepherd, Luna.\n\nThe Lagoon has been through hell the past decade, especially in regards to algae blooms that began around 2010 and peaked in 2013. Over 90 percent of seagrasses in the 156 mile lagoon died off in those and the following years and FWC still reports issues including fish kills. I believe that the lagoon is improving in spite of continued difficulties. Just the past few days the water quality the length of the lagoon looked appealing and there were dolphins jumping in our wake the entire trip! Dozens of them, all along the way! These clever animals will always find a fish, in spite of crappy water, but nonetheless, their presence was inspiring.\n\nEven though this was to be the “retirement cruise,” I couldn’t help myself from zooming into a Rivers Coalition meeting on October 26 and was impressed that for the second time in row since I was ditched by the Senate, South Florida Water Management District executive staff and a governing board member drove all the way from West Palm Beach to attend the meeting. Obviously this is done for their self preservation, but still!\n\nThe subject of the meeting was “Sending Water South,” and basically the theme, in line with my last blog post, was that the the high water in Water Conservation Areas south of Lake Okeechobee makes sending water south right now “impossible.” Staff said they were draining the WCAs now, the Storm Water Treatment Areas are restored, and they hope to send Lake Okeechobee water south in December. Of course no one mentions this bottleneck is caused by the Everglades Agricultural Area….\n\nI found this possibility about sending water south in December misleading. In fact, it was False hope. Sure there is always a possibility that things will not turn out as science plans, but we should recognize science nonetheless. Especially as the District is based on science has its own scientific weather bureau that is so respected the ACOE relies on its data!\n\nTwo days prior to the Rivers Coalition meeting the District hosted a Water Resource Form. During this forum the high probability of above average rainfall December 2023 through February 2024 over the sixteen county South Florida Water Management District was noted. This is due to a weather condition known as El Nino. So back to the Rivers Coalition meeting, what if as science is revealing, we do not have a dry season and it rains over the Water Conservation Areas? Hmmm? Then the SFWMD probably wont be able to send water south in December, or January or February and tree islands and fur-bearing animals will continue to suffer as will we. This may have been mentioned in passing but it was not discussed.\n\nI rather be prepared for something that may happen than have my government spoon feed me false hope gliding over serious issues. A scientific agency has the responsibility to share science not hope.\n\nTCPalm Article by Ed Killer\n\nConcerns-Overfull WCAs & Lake O Discharges\n\nYesterday, I listened to the South Florida Water Management District’s Governing Board meeting via Zoom. The overriding issue, besides the fact the St. Lucie River system’s C-44 Reservoir is not working, Lake O is over 16 feet and discharges could soon be imminent, was “high water in the Water Conservation Areas.”\n\nWhat are WCAs anyway?\n\nThey were built as part of the giant drainage system of Florida that “over did it.”\n\nThe Water Conservation Areas were built to hold water because we had over-drained, but now sometimes they get too full…\n\nIn 1947 there was “the great flood,” that destroyed lands and properties in the seventeen counties of the Everglades Drainage District. This led to the U.S. Army Corps building the monstrosity named the Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control and Other Purposes (C&SFP.) The S.F.W.M.D. is the local sponsor. The two agencies work together.\n\nUnited States Geological Survey explains:\n\n“Historically, water flowed slowly southward through the Everglades in a wide swath. Record floods in 1947 and 1948 led to the construction of a massive flood control project. It served to prevent flooding and store water during dry periods. It also allowed for further development of the growing urban area on the Atlantic coastal ridge.\n\nThe project established three Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), one of which is the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. These areas are delineated in the Landsat images, clearly divided by the levees and canals. Also visible are the Big Cypress National Preserve, Everglades National Park, and Everglades Agricultural Area.Another part of the project is the 100-mile-long eastern perimeter levee, a 3- to 6-meter high earthen berm built to prevent flooding of farmland and urban areas. It runs along the eastern edge of the WCAs, marking a clear separation between the WCAs and urban areas such as Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Coral Springs.\n\nAlong with facilitating the further growth of the urban areas of greater Miami, the other upshot of the project was that the natural flow of water was interrupted, changing the hydrology of the region. The gradual sheet flow of freshwater is diminished, and instead sudden pulses of water are delivered by the canals. These sudden releases caused decreases in the numbers of fish species.”\n\nThe bottom line is that when there has been significant rain, like now, the WCAs overfill and the fur bearing animals are seriously at risk, unnaturally surrounded by rising water with no access to their habitat. Deer and other mammals have to take refuge on sacred Native American tree islands or on levees. Often, many species are desperately standing together. Friend and foe. All stressed, all scared, and all hungry.\n\nIn 1982 there was a so called “mercy-killing” of over 700 deer that were “starving” in the flooded Water Conservation Area 3. There are concerns that this year a similar situation could arise. I recommend watching the SFMWD meeting under section 28 and all public comments and more if you have the time. This is a very serious issue and no way to treat God’s creatures. How we treat humans during Lake O discharge events is bad enough. It is time to undo the past.\n\nCanadian Fire Smoke Over Florida, 10-3-23\n\nA Thurlow family text for the history books…\n\n9:22 am October 3, 2023\n\nBrother Todd: “Did you guys see the sun this morning? I never stop on my morning run but I had to pause to take a picture. It looked like the moon.”\n\nJacqui: “Yeah, really something. When I drove over the bridge twenty minutes ago on my way from Sewall’s Point to Stuart, I said to myself ‘what is that?’ The sky looked like a huge fog bank coming from west to the east.”\n\nSister Jenny: “There is some weird haze in the air. Does anyone know what it is? I got an air quality alert on my radar and I saw it last night and this morning.”\n\nSister-in law Deanna: “My co-worker just said it is the Canadian wildfires.”\n\nJenny: “Crazy!”\n\nTodd: “Looking at satellite imagery now. Unbelievable stream of smoke. I will try to compile and send.”\n\nDeanna: “The article mentions Central Florida, but wondering is it is stretching more south towards us? Wouldn’t be surprised with all this crazy wind we’ve been having.”\n\nMom Sandy : “You guys amaze me.”\n\nTodd: “Smoke being sucked down from south of Hudson Bay on September 28. If you zoom in you will see a little read dots Those are thermal anomalies (wildfires being picked up by the satellite.”\n\nJacqui: “Photo doesn’t do justice. Smoke is all around, more than Stuart. I am in Palm City now. You’d think the fire was burning nearby in Okeechobee, not Canada.”\n\nPlease link here to view the video “Canadian Fire Smoke over Florida” 10-3-23, Todd Thurlow or see below if You Tube is displayed.\n\n“If you live in Florida, you may have noticed the smoke in the air on Tuesday morning, October, 3, 2023 This is a two-day loop of 276 GOES-East satellite images, 10-minute intervals from 10/2/2023 @ 9pm to 10/3/2023 @ 8pm. You can see a low pressure system in the northern Atlantic. That system pulls a stream of smoke from the northern Atlantic towards Florida on 10/2/2023. It arrives overnight and is over Florida on the morning of 10/3/2023. The north Atlantic smoke originated from wildfires near Hudson Bay in Canada. You can make the video loop by right-clicking the video and selecting “loop“. ~Todd Thurlow\n\nA Surprise Visit From the S.F.W.M.D.\n\nYesterday, I attended the Rivers Coalition meeting. It was a nice surprise to see so many members of the South Florida Water Management District as they were not listed on the agenda. “The District visitors” included Drew Bartlett, Executive Director; Laurence Glenn, Division Director, Water Resources; Sean Cooley, Chief Communications and Public Policy Officer, Office of Communications and Public Engagement; Kathy LaMartina, Regional Representative, Orange, Osceola, Polk, St. Lucie and Martin Counties; and Governing Board Member, Cheryl Meads, At large East Coast, St. Lucie, Martin, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties.\n\nThe Rivers Coalition Meeting itself was entitled“Get the Muck Out of Here” and featured Joe Gilo, Lake Okeechobee Restoration Initiative, and Len Lindahl, McVicar Consulting/Diatom Project. Both presentations focused on improving water quaintly in the lake, an essential goal. Very interesting, but the presentations and question/answer sessions were cut short due to time.\n\nHaving the South Florida Water Management District as a guest is a rare honor thus they spoke before the planned speakers. Mr. Bartlett shared lake level facts and why water from Lake Okeechobee cannot be sent south when the Water Conservation Areas are already full. He mentioned that the new A-2 Storm Water Treatment Area is meant more for Lake Okeechobee Water. I wasn’t sure why he called it the “A-2” as we all know it as the “EAA STA.” No matter what it’s called, we all know that Mr. Bartlett is a talented executive director.\n\nMr. Glenn talked about the intricacies of managing the health of the Storm Water Treatment Areas and their legal job to cleanse the runoff water and meet water quality standards for the Everglades Agriculture Area. (Thus their water has priority to go through the storm water treatment areas first – hmmm?”)\n\nOver the course of the meeting, what made the biggest impression on me, was when Drew Bartlett introduced Cheryl Meads as governing board member -“local representative.” Over the course of the past couple of years, Cheryl has moved from Islamorada, in the Florida Keys, where she first lived when appointed to the South Florida Water Management Governing Board, to Martin County and owns other properties in nearby counties. Cheryl and I both served as at-large members living in Martin County.\n\nAlthough I was reappointed by Governor DeSantis for a second term serving on the South Florida Water Management Governing Board, I was not reconfirmed by the Senate and my term expired on June 19, 2023. Since that time, there has been no representation for “that seat” and we have all been waiting for a new appointment by the Governor. In August, three members were rereappointed: Chair Chancy Goss, Vice-Chair Scott Wagner, and Jay Steinle. It was thought that at that time, “the empty seat” would be filled. It was not.\n\nI have to assume that yesterday’s gesture of Cheryl Meads being introduced by the Executive Director as the “local representative” implies that she is being directed to represent the Treasure Coast. Cheryl is a wonderful and environmentally oriented person as are all of the present governing board members. However, she is not a homegrown, fighting, St. Lucie River Warrior. At large members represent the entire east coast and when covering the “primary outlet” for the destructive discharges of Lake Okeechobee, the St. Lucie River requires special knowledge and attention. Please share with Cheryl your experiences and concerns. She is your new District voice!\n\nFinding II. ~Relevant to Management Determination for the Everglades Agricultural Area, Draft Copy, 1975\n\nToday I share Finding II. of “Conclusions of the Special Project to Prevent the Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee Relevant to Management Determination for the Everglades Agricultural Area,” Draft Copy, 1975.\n\nThis information was gathered by my husband and I at the State Library and Archives of Florida in Tallahassee.\n\nI recently I posted Finding I.\n\nAgain, I state how important it is that this historic documentation is not stored in our state archives like something out of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” but rather ready and available to the public. Otherwise, history is rewritten by those with most the power and influence.\n\nFor instance, today, one will ofter hear in regards to pollution in Lake Okeechobee, –from those working for and in the EAA,– “The Everglades Agriculture Area (EAA) doesn’t backpump anymore. Our water is cleaner when it leaves than when it came in.” (basically, we are not responsible for the condition of Lake Okeechobee, others are….)\n\nWhat is missing in this response is that in spite of its numbers the Everglades Agricultural Area remains responsible for damages that plague Lake Okeechobee TODAY.\n\nIf you smoked unfiltered cigarettes from the 1940s through the 1980s and then, because of a law suit, the University of Florida and the South Florida Water Management District helped you create “Best Management Practices” that did a great job cleansing your smoke through giant air filters, (like Storm Water Treatment Areas filter the EAA’s dirty water of nitrogen and phosphorus,) would it be correct to say the damage in your lungs has disappeared?\n\nNo. The damage in Lake Okeechobee from backpumping is still there and continues to be built upon. The filthy backpumped water of the past is a major reason for the pathetic condition of Lake Okeechobee today. It is time for the EAA and its masters to take responsibility for this and to stop hiding behind their modern day state sponsored improvements.\n\n~begin text:\n\n“With regard to eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee drainage water from 30 percent of the EAA land area is back pumped into Lake Okeechobee during the wet season. An average of 330,000 acre-feet of water entered the lake annually at Structures S-2 and S-3 from the Miami, Hillsboro and New River Canals . In addition drainage districts and the private interest pump approximately 150,000 acre feet of water into the lake from various locations. The EAA irrigation demands draw an average of 438,000 acre-feet from the lake annually…”\n\nConclusions of the Special Project to Prevent the Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee Relevant to Management Determination for the Everglades Agricultural Area, Draft Copy, 1975.\n\nFinding II.\n\nWater Backpumped from the Everglades Agricultural Area contributes significantly to the cultural eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee.\n\nThe following research evidence is proffered in support of Finding II.\n\n(page 23.) Joyner (1974) found that water pumped from agricultural areas to the southeast is generally the poorest in quality of all water entering Lake Okeechobee….\n\n(page 24.) Brezonik further states: It is clear from the data that Lake Okeechobee presently receives an abundant supply of nutrients. Both nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates or near or above all the (dangerous) levels reported in the scientific literature. (Table 2.) If all backpumping were ceased, the nutrient loading rates would decrease by about 20 percent. This would still leave area loading for nitrogen above the dangerous values, but the volumetric rate would be slightly under the dangerous volumetric rate of Brezonik and Shannon (1971). The photophores loading without backpuming would be lower than all but Vollenweider’s (1968) dangerous rate….\n\nAerial Update 7-17-23 SLR/IRL\n\nToday I share aerial photographs taken by Ed Lippisch on September 17 around 9:30 am to 10am. The great thing about a photograph is that it speaks for itself! We have avoided a recent tropical storm or a hurricane’s impact on Lake Okeechobee, but the lake remains high at 15.41 feet as reported today by the SFWMD. Stormwater and canals C-23, C-24 continue pollute and discolor the estuary. Remember no fertilizer use during rainy season or if you’re like me EVER! Stay vigilant as hurricane season runs from June 1st through November 30th. Your eyes in the sky, J&E\n\nKeep your eye on lake O!\n\nST. LUCIE RIVER/INDIAN RIVER LAGOON at ST. LUCIE INLET\n\nS-308 at PORT MAYACA, LAKE OKEECHOBEE, and C-44 Canal aka St. Lucie Canal\n\nStudies Based on 1953 Revealed Lake Okeechobee was becoming Dangerously Hyper-Eutrophic\n\nToday I share an excerpt form “Conclusions of the Special Project to Prevent the Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee Relevant to the Management Determination for the Everglades Agricultural Area,” Draft Report, State of Florida 1975. It is important that historical information like this is available to the public. It is mind-boggling that in 2023, seventy years since 1953, the issue of eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee has only worsened. Every year the estuaries are plagued by the threat of discharged toxic algae. Reports like this one lie buried in Florida’s state archives in Tallahassee. Most legislators have probably never read it. What has been done to improve water quality is not enough.\n\nFinding I.\n\nLake Okeechobee is presently enriched and moderately eutrophic. If the present trend of increasing nutrient loads from the drainage basins is not reversed, the lake could become hyper-eutrophic within the foreseeable future.\n\nThe following research evidence is proffered in support of Finding I.\n\nIn 1953, Dr. H. T. Odum sampled the phosphorus content of Lake Okeechobee and tributaries to the lake. Although not enough samples were taken to have statistical significance, the values of the samples were well below levels consider to be eutrophic.\n\nIn 1953, the lake’s watershed was essentially undeveloped. The fact that the lake had low phosphate values in the water column indicates that the lake was not eutrophic in 1953. Water quality samples taken since 1953 have all shown phosphorus values higher than those taken by Odum. This indicates that present levels of phosphorus in the lake result from man’s drainage and land-use practices in the drainage basins.\n\nFinding II. to follow….\n\nLearning About What Killed Lake Okeechobee and is still killing it\n\nToday I am including notes from: Draft, A Summary of Progress of the Special Project to Prevent the Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee, 1975, inspired by my last post. This draft report eventually led to de-chanalizing a substantial portion of the Kissimmee River, the halting of backpumping by the Everglades Agricultural Area, the beginning of Best Management Practices for Agriculture, and conservation for drinking water.\n\nIt must be noted that it was the Central and Southern Florida Plan of 1948, after the great flood of 1947, implemented by the Army Corps of Engineers that channelized the Kissimmee River and created the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA). It took me years to understand this. The EAA and its flood protections were created by our federal government. Then acting in lockstep our state government morphed the Everglades Drainage District into the Central and Southern Flood Control District to manage the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District-which included the Everglades Agricultural Area. In 1975, around the time of the Draft publication, the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District was been renamed the South Florida Water Management District. The intensions of the Draft were good, but conflicts of interests continue today with management of the EAA, on both the state and federal level.\n\nThink about it.\n\nSo once it was decided the Everglades Agricultural Area could no longer back pump into Lake Okeechobee due to the lake’s eutrophication, the EAA’s government sponsored pollution led to the law suit that now requites all Everglades Agricultural Area “runoff” to go through the Storm Water Treatment Areas to be filtered before it gets to the Conservation Areas thus Everglades National Park. “Lake Okeechobee water” on the other hand sits cooking toxic algae in the still sick lake, before it is sent polluted, unfiltered to the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee estuaries and residents of those estuaries have no legal standing.\n\nHmmm?\n\nBegin quotes from text, 1975:\n\nWater back pumped from the Everglades Agricultural Area contributes significantly to the cultural eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee. (pg. 23)\n\nThe major causative factors of the present cultural eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee are:\n\nCanalization of the tributary rivers of streams (especially the Kissimmee River).\n\nBackpumping of highly enriched waters from the Agricultural Area, south of th lake , into the lake during the wet season.\n\nUpland drainage practices in the lake’s watershed.\n\nInadequate nutrient conservation, livestock management, and other agricultural practices in the watershed.\n\nManagement and regulation of the lake and its tributaries which diminish their ability to absorb nutrients. (pg. 5)\n\nIn view of the fact that the cessation of back pumping would result in a reduction of the lakes present water budget by some 12-14 percent and that water conserving is one of the over-riding management objectives for the South Florida region the committee recommend further that “runoff water from the Everglades Agricultural Area be stored in or near the EAA for subsequent re-use as irrigation water.” This will alleviate the present need to use an average of 350,000 acre feet of water for the lake for irrigation in the EAA and balance the loss of the present 330,000 acre feet contributed to the lake by back pumping. (pg. 10)\n\nLegal and Administrative Aspects of Management have been created and charged with managing various aspect of the region. The present management structure evolved in piecemeal response to growing management problems. Agency responsibilities often overlapped and conflicted and there is no balanced, integrated, or well directed management program for the region. (pg. 11)\n\nSince 1948, the major resource management agency in South Florida has been the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control District which was created to manage the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. (which includes the EAA.)\n\nKilling Lake Okeechobee~at least since 1971\n\nI recently received some very interesting comments about a post I wrote in 2022 featuring state archived documents. The title? “Summary of Progress, Final Report on the Special Project to Prevent Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee.” I decided to share the post again in a different way.\n\nSometimes looking back makes you wonder if you are going forward…\n\nThe hand written corrections and typewritten format on the document really bring it home:\n\nParagraph two: “The lake has been and is being degraded. Poor land and water management practices in the drainage basin threaten to further degrade and destroy the lake’s indispensable values. This was recognized as early as 1971…”\n\n1971?"
