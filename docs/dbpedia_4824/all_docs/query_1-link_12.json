        "text": "HULL-HOUSE\n\n800 SOUTH HALSTED STREET\n\nCHICAGO\n\nJanuary 14, 1924\n\nMy dear Mrs. Hull:\n\nI do feel it is hard for the International Council to feel their way blocked by our unpopularity, and I wish very much we could resign making a statement that we do not wish to embarrass them in the raising of money, securing halls, etc. I think we could make a statement of our position quite as clearly as if they asked us to resign and ↑it↓ would also put us in a better position ↑than if they did↓. However, if the Board feel otherwise, that is for the Board to decide. I am of course, not really a member, although you are always so kind about letting me talk that I almost forget I am not. I think the Council are going to have all kinds of difficulty about money as we did, but they will always have an excellent excuse.\n\nI am enclosing a letter from Alice Hamilton which has just come.\n\nI think my decision right about Mrs. Catt's meeting, although I have also been urged to go as ↑a↓ delegate from the Women's Trade Union League. I am enclosing a copy of a letter from her which is as you see, the end of a long correspondence. I should be glad to have it returned. Please do not worry about the situation, it is after all what we have had for a long time.\n\nAffectionately yours,\n\nJane Addams. [signed]\n\n↑P.S. I am quite ready to abide by the decision of the Board of course.↓\n\nMrs. Wm. I. Hull,\n\n504 Walnut Lane,\n\nSwarthmore, Pa."
