        "text": "U.S. bills: More than just paper\n\nSome people call earning money “making paper” but did you know dollar bills aren’t paper at all? “Paper” money is actually made from a custom blend of fabrics. This special blend is what gives our money its unique feel and durability. So, next time you pull out a bill from your wallet, remember: It's more than just paper!\n\nHere’s a look at the specific materials that make up U.S. currency:\n\nMoney materials: U.S. bills\n\n$1, $2, and $5 bills: You might think they're just paper, but they're actually a mix of 75% cotton and 25% linen. This blend gives these bills their unique texture and durability.\n\n$10, $20, $50, and $100 bills: Like the smaller denominations, these higher-value bills are made from the same cotton-linen blend with red and blue fibers. They also have some high-tech security features like color-shifting ink, security threads, and watermarks.\n\nWhat is money made of? U.S. coins\n\nPenny: It's mostly zinc! About 97.5% is zinc, with copper plating comprising the remaining 2.5%.\n\nNickel: Despite its name, it's not all nickel – it's 75% copper and 25% nickel.\n\nDime: The dime is an alloy made from 91.67% copper and 8.33% nickel.\n\nQuarter: Like the dime, the quarter is an alloy, too. It’s a mix of 91.67% copper and 8.33% nickel.\n\nHalf-dollar and dollar coins: These coins have a core of pure copper, surrounded by a layer that blends copper and nickel.\n\nSpecialty and historical U.S. coins\n\nSpecialty coins: The U.S. Mint will occasionally release special coins with different compositions, such as the part-silver Kennedy half-dollar or the 24-karat gold Buffalo coin.\n\nHistorical coins: Before 1965, many U.S. Coins were made from a blend of silver and copper. These coins have since been discontinued and are now considered valuable by collectors. Some examples include the 90% silver Roosevelt dime and the 35% silver Jefferson nickel.\n\nSo, what's the big deal about these materials? They make our money strong, durable, and harder to counterfeit. Plus, using cotton and linen ensures our bills can withstand multiple folds without tearing.\n\nMaking money: An intricate manufacturing process\n\nFrom start to finish, an incredibly complex process goes into creating our currency. It starts with a detailed design and ends with intricate printing methods. Throughout the process, engineers use advanced security features and techniques to make sure each bill is authentic and difficult to copy.\n\nBill production process:\n\nWorkers create a giant roll of high-quality cotton-linen paper, carefully chosen for durability and texture.\n\nThe roll is sent to the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) for further processing.\n\nAt the BEP, the roll is meticulously cut into individual sheets of precise dimensions.\n\nAdvanced printing techniques add intricate designs to each sheet with extreme precision to ensure the highest level of detail and security.\n\nCoin manufacturing process:\n\n1. Melt down the metal alloys carefully selected for their specific properties.\n\n2. Once the alloys are molten, they are skillfully pressed into coin-shaped blanks, ready for further transformation.\n\n3. The blanks are then placed in a specialized machine that precisely stamps unique designs onto each coin, adding distinctiveness and visual appeal to the final product.\n\nThe bottom line: Money isn't just paper and silver. From coins composed of copper to bills made from cotton and linen, it takes a lot of materials to make up our nation's money supply. The intricate manufacturing process helps ensure that counterfeiters can’t easily copy our currency."
