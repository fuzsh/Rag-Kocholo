        "text": "Mutilated bank notes\n\nMutilated bank notes show signs of excessive damage from fire or water, missing pieces, or other forms of deterioration.\n\nThese bank notes are likely too damaged or brittle to be used for payment, so you can send them to us for redemption. We will examine them to determine the value of your claim.\n\nContaminated bank notes\n\nA bank note is considered contaminated if it has come into contact with toxic substances, either liquid or solid (for example, drugs, blood, mold, sewage, and unknown substances) and could be harmful to your health or safety.\n\nThese bank notes are likely unusable for payment, so you can send them to us for redemption. We will examine them to determine the value of your claim.\n\nBank notes that are no longer legal tender\n\nSince January 1, 2021, the Canadian $1, $2, $25, $500 and $1,000 bank notes are no longer considered legal tender. Essentially, this means that you may not be able to use them in cash transactions.\n\nDon’t worry—these bank notes have not lost their face value. Here are your options:\n\nredeem your bank notes for face value at your financial institution;\n\nredeem your bank notes for face value by submitting a claim to us;\n\nkeep them.\n\nSome bank notes, such as the $25 and $500, may be worth significantly more than their face value to collectors. To find out if your bank notes have a different value, you can refer to a collector’s catalog, or obtain an evaluation from two or three money dealers who cater to collectors."
