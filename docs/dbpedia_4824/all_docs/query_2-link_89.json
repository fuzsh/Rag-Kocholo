        "text": "Refer to the following to find out how you can identify if your note or coin is damaged.\n\nFor damaged notes\n\nNotes may be defined as mutilated if they are:\n\nTorn.\n\nScorched or burnt.\n\nAttacked by pests and insects.\n\nStained by ink, paint or other chemicals.\n\nDefaced by markings or writings of words, figures and others.\n\nPerforated or portions missing.\n\nFor damaged coins\n\nCoins may be considered mutilated or damaged if they are:\n\nScorched or burnt.\n\nStained by ink, paint or other chemicals.\n\nDefaced by stamping or filing.\n\nCut, chipped, holed, warped or dented.\n\nDislodged (in the case of Third Series $1 bi-metallic coins).\n\nMutilated notes are assessed in 2 stages. In stage 1, the following will have to be met:\n\nThe note has been validated to be genuine.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the note has been wilfully or deliberately damaged.\n\nIf you have provided supporting evidence about the circumstances leading to the mutilation, the evidence will also be assessed for its reasonableness.\n\nIf all the criteria in stage 1 are met, the currency note will proceed to stage 2 assessment. In stage 2, the refund value for a mutilated note is assessed based on the portion of the note remaining according to the following guidelines:\n\nIf two or more portions of a note are present, the refund value that may be paid will be assessed based on the sum of the individual portions presented, provided there is no evidence to suggest that the portions are from different notes.\n\n(In addition, for 1,000 and $10,000 notes) At least five complete digits or letters of both sets of serial numbers should be present before any refund value is assessed.\n\nA refund of up to full face value of the original note may be paid, if MAS is satisfied that the method of mutilation and supporting evidence show that the missing portions of the note have been destroyed or will not be awarded any refund value in the future."
