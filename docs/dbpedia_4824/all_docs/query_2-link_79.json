When will the funds be available for withdrawal?\n\nIf deposited by check, the bank generally must make the first $5,525 available consistent with the bank's normal availability schedule. The bank may place a hold on the amount deposited over $5,525.\n\nFor check deposits over $5,525, banking laws and regulations allow for exceptions to the rules on availability of funds. These exception holds may be applied to any checks (including official or government-issued checks) to any account where the aggregate amount of the checks deposited on a banking day exceeds $5,525.\n\nWhen the bank applies the large-check-deposit exception, it may extend the hold times established under its normal availability schedule by a reasonable period of time. According to banking regulations, reasonable periods of time include an extension of up to five business days for most checks.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, the bank may be able to impose a longer hold if it can establish that the longer hold is reasonable.\n\nFunds deposited electronically or by cash are generally available by the business day after the banking day they were deposited.\n\nReview your deposit account agreement for policies specific to your bank and your account.\n\nRefer to 12 CFR 229 \"Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks (Regulation CC).\"\n\nLast Reviewed: April 2021"
