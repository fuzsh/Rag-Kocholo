        "text": "This information applies to vehicles that have been towed from private property without the vehicle owner’s consent (what’s referred to in the Code as a trespass tow). This does not apply to vehicles towed from accident scenes because they were disabled or because you were incapacitated (which is referred to in the Code as a nonconsensual tow). Please see Chapter 35 of the Orange County, Florida - Code of Ordinances for more information on nonconsensual tows.\n\nDrop fee:\n\nIf your vehicle is connected to a tow truck but has not yet left the property, the tow truck driver must release the vehicle to you upon payment of a drop fee.\n\nThe maximum allowable drop fee is half the rate for towing the vehicle. For most vehicles the tow rate is $135, so the drop fee would be $67.50.\n\nThe tow truck driver is required to allow you at least 15 minutes to secure payment. They are required to allow you to pay with a credit or debit card, and they are required to provide you a written receipt.\n\nCall the phone number on the towing sign where your car was towed:\n\nPhones are required to be answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including holidays.\n\nTow companies are required to immediately advise you of the following:\n\nEvery document or other item you must bring with you to retrieve the vehicle;\n\nExact charges as of the time of the your call, and the rate at which additional charges will accrue;\n\nAcceptable methods of payment, which include cash, money order, cashier's check, and major debit or credit card;\n\nThe towed vehicle can be picked up within one hour of request; and\n\nThe location at which you can pay the fees and pick up the vehicle.\n\nIf you have difficulty reaching the tow company, you may call the Orange County Sheriff’s Office at 407-836-4357 to determine whether your vehicle has been towed.\n\nTow companies are required to notify the Sheriff’s Office within 30 minutes after they arrive at their storage facility with your vehicle.\n\nThings to be aware of when picking up your vehicle:\n\nThe tow company must allow you to inspect your vehicle and retrieve personal property from your vehicle at their storage facility prior to payment. They are prohibited from refusing to allow retrieval of property or charging a fee for retrieval. They also are prohibited from requiring you to sign a release or waiver of any kind as a condition of inspecting, removing property from, or retrieving your vehicle.\n\nThe tow company must provide a written bill at your request, detailing the charges to date.\n\nIf your registration is expired, the tow company cannot require that you bring the registration up to date before releasing your vehicle to you.\n\nIf you pay with cash, the tow company must provide change to the closest whole dollar. They may not condition payment on you having exact change. If you pay by debit or credit card, they are not allowed to charge extra for use of the card.\n\nAt the time of payment, the tow company must provide a written receipt for all charges and payments and must include the name of the company, date, time, and location of the tow, and payment.\n\nOnce you have paid the required fees, the tow company must release your vehicle to you within 30 minutes.\n\nThe tow company cannot charge more than the Code allows for towing and storage. For most cars (under 10,000 pounds), the flat rate for trespass towing is $135. After 24 hours, they can charge a daily storage fee of $32 (for most cars). Storage fees are based on 24-hour increments, not calendar days. (Please see the Code for complete rate information.)\n\nIf you believe these rules have been violated, please visit the Consumer Protection page of the Orange County website, where you can download a Towing Complaint Form or fill out and submit an online form.\n\nYou don't have to pay the towing company to get your car:\n\nYou have the right to post a bond in county court (within 10 days of the tow) in the amount of your towing bill, and the court will issue to you a clerk's certificate showing that you have posted a bond.\n\nTo post a bond, bring your original bill (the tow company must provide a written bill at your request) and 2 copies to the Orange County Courthouse, Room 310.\n\nOnce you show the clerk’s certificate to the tow company, they must release your vehicle to you immediately. If they refuse, you may call the Sheriff for assistance."
