        "text": "The History of Kennedy Half Dollars and Their Face Value\n\nAfter the fateful trip to Dallas on November 22, 1963, when President John F. Kennedy was tragically assassinated, mourning Americans suggested the silver dollar - or another one of the nation's coins due for a design change - bear JFK's likeness as a tribute to his legacy.\n\nOn December 10, 1963, President Lyndon Johnson requested that Congress authorize JFK's portrait be placed on the U.S. half dollar that currently featured the portrait of Benjamin Franklin. There was only one problem with this request. The Coin Act of September 26, 1890, prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from changing the design of any circulating coin until after its required 25-year \"length of service\" had elapsed. The Franklin half dollar had only been struck for 15 years. To trump this requirement, special congressional action was needed. The House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate approved the placement of JFK's image on the U.S. half dollar, abruptly ending the Franklin Half Dollar series ten years early. President Johnson signed the bill into law on December 30, 1963, creating Public Law 88-256.\n\nThe Kennedy Half Dollar, introduced in 1964, holds a special place in American numismatic history. With a face value of 50 cents, it has not been issued into circulation since 2002, though the United States Mint still releases it in rolls, bags, and annual Proof and Mint Sets.\n\nThe image selected for the Kennedy half dollar was the one that appeared on Kennedy's Inaugural medal of 1961. The late president \"personally approved\" of this design. The obverse side of the coin prominently features a profile portrait of President Kennedy designed by Gilroy Roberts. It is considered one of American history's most iconic and enduring coin designs. The reverse side, created by Frank Gasparro, showcases the presidential seal with a heraldic eagle. Over the years, the Kennedy Half Dollar has experienced subtle design modifications but has preserved its role as a tribute to a revered president.\n\nToday, over 45 years later, JFK's image still lives on in the pockets and collections of many Americans.\n\nWhere Are Kennedy Half Dollars Minted?\n\nThe Kennedy Half Dollar has been primarily minted at three U.S. Mint locations throughout its history. These mints include the Philadelphia Mint, the Denver Mint, and the San Francisco Mint. To distinguish the origin of these coins, mint marks are used. The Philadelphia Mint typically does not use a mint mark but denotes coins minted there by the absence of this mark. The Denver Mint uses a \"D\" mint mark, while the San Francisco Mint typically uses an \"S\" mint mark. In 2014, the West Point Mint, denoted by a “W” mint mark, did strike special reverse proof and gold versions of the Kennedy Half Dollar in honor of the 50th anniversary of the series. Collectors often pay close attention to mint marks, as they can significantly affect a coin's rarity and overall appeal.\n\nAre Kennedy Half Dollars Pure Silver?\n\nWhile some Kennedy Half Dollars have a composition of either 90 percent silver or 40 percent silver, some do not contain any silver at all. Kennedys, minted in 1964, contain 90 percent pure silver. But the following year, due to silver shortages, that percentage was reduced to 40 percent, lasting until 1970. With the exception of the Silver Kennedy Half Dollars minted between 1964 and 1970, all Kennedys since then have been minted with a copper-nickel alloy (the same materials used in U.S. dimes and quarters) with no silver included in their composition.\n\nSilver Kennedy Half Dollars can still be found in Silver Proof Sets. Before 2018, these Silver Kennedy Proofs contained 90 percent fine silver. Following 2018, they contain 99.9 percent fine silver.\n\nBicentennial Kennedy Half Dollars\n\nThe Bicentennial Kennedy Half Dollar was issued in 1975 and 1976 and is a coin that holds a special place in American numismatics. It was created to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the United States, celebrating 200 years of independence. With a slightly modified portrait of President John F. Kennedy on the obverse side, the reverse showcases a striking image of Independence Hall.\n\nThis coin is notable because its design came from a competition hosted by the Treasury Department. This competition was open to the public, and a five-judge panel selected winners.\n\nOver its duration, billions of the Bicentennial Kennedy Half Dollar coins were struck, making them widely accessible to the public. While this large mintage might not contribute to their rarity, their historical significance and aesthetic appeal have made them a popular choice among collectors and a lasting reminder of the nation's bicentennial celebration."
