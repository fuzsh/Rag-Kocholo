My 43, January 24, 9 a.m. Further correspondence and interviews between American merchants [Minister?] and Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs failed to result in cancellation of the pardon and on October 11th Chang was appointed by Presidential mandate one of the vice commanders of the rear guard army. On learning of this yesterday I immediately lodged strong oral protest with Koo who states that he had never heard of the mandate, denied that Chinese Government had any intention of disregarding views of the American Government and attributed issue of mandate to inadvertence incident to extraordinary pressure on Government departments. He seemed presumably very grateful and promised take up matter at once with Prime Minister. Meanwhile I shall address Koo strong note in line with your 14, January 14, 4 p.m."
