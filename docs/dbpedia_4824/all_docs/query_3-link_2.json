This was the Nazi Party’s attempt to seize the government by force, and Hitler had hoped that his nationalist revolution would spread to the German army, then bring down the government in Berlin. This was after the German government resumed making payments to Britain and France following their defeat in the First World War.\n\nHitler spent nine months in Lansberg jail, where he spent his time writing his autobiography Mein Kampf. He was released early due to political pressure from Nazi Party supporters. Some people believe Hitler’s time in prison was crucial character building for him, and the main way he prepared himself to become Germany’s dictator. His autobiography helped him build his cult of personality and express his views, and he was able to assure himself of his character.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nImmigration and Citizenship Acts in the U.S.\n\nThis is a very important event in our 1924 timeline, since it changed the lives of so many people. 1924 was a crucial year for immigration and citizenship acts in the U.S., introduced by President Calvin Coolidge. On May 26, President Coolidge signed an immigration law that restricted immigration to the United States from other countries, due to the huge influx of immigrants following the end of the First World War. The prosperity experienced by the United States and the devastated European countries made America a very tempting place to travel to and start a new life.\n\nOne aspect of the immigration laws was the Asian Exclusion Act, in which immigrants from particular Asian countries were banned from entering the country entirely. With European immigrants, a quota was set, in which only a certain number of immigrants could enter the country each year. A literary test had already been introduced in 1917, meaning immigrants had to demonstrate basic reading skills to be allowed in the United States.\n\nOn June 2, President Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which declared all Native Americans to be American citizens. This meant Native Americans would be considered proper citizens of the country, but this unfortunately didn’t mean they would no longer be subject to discrimination.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is Declared a National Monument\n\nEver since the Statue of Liberty was given as a gift to the United States, it has become a symbol of democracy, liberty and freedom – ideals that the American nation embodies and projects to the rest of the world. It was also given to America to commemorate the centennial of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as the friendship between the United States and France. The statue became so symbolic of these values that in 1924 it was officially declared a national monument.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nThe Death of Vladimir Lenin\n\nVladimir Lenin was a key figure in the Bolshevik Revolution, and was the first leader of the USSR. His untimely death at the age of 53 was recorded as being a result of an incurable blood vessel disease. In his honour, Petrograd was renamed Leningrad. His embalmed body remains in a mausoleum near the Kremlin to this day, where people from around the world come to pay their respects.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
