        "text": "Congress appropriates $20,000 for the publication of contributions to North American Ethnology, and mandates that including archives, records, and materials relating to the Indians of North America collected by the geographical and geological survey of the Rocky Mountains be transferred to the the Bureau of Ethnology. On February 28th, the Secretary of the Interior requested that this appropriation be placed under the Smithsonian instead of the Department of the Interior. The Bureau of Ethnology, with Major John Wesley Powell as director, is established.

A month before on March 13th, President Richard Nixon announced that the pandas would reside at the National Zoo, and called them a \"gift from all the people of China to all the people of the United States.\" On April 20, the pandas were officially presented, with Mrs. Nixon and members of Congress in attendance. With a rate of approximately 1,200 people per hour, nearly 24,000 visitors came to see Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling on their first weekend.

Bunch III was installed as the fourteenth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution on November 1, 2019 at 3:00 p.m. in the Arts and Industries Building. Hon. John G. Roberts, Jr., Chief Justice of the United States and Chancellor of the Smithsonian, presided over the ceremony. Bunch is the first African American leader in the institution's 173-year history. Bunch is also the first historian to take the position. The ceremony began with a Presentation of the Colors by the Smithsonian Honor Guard and the singing of the National Anthem by singer, songwriter and Washington, D.C., native Kenny Lattimore. Welcoming remarks were made by David Rubenstein, chair of the Smithsonian Board of Regents and Steve Case, chair-elect. Eleanor Harvey, senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, welcomed the Secretary on behalf of the Smithsonian's staff and volunteers. Next came remarks from former Smithsonian Secretary David Skorton, who retired from the position in June. After delivering brief remarks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr,. presented Bunch with the ceremonial key to the Smithsonian Castle, a symbol of the Office of the Secretary of the Smithsonian. Bunch's 15-minute installation address followed the presentation. In his remarks, he told the story of a trip his family took in the 1960s from their home in New Jersey to visit relatives in the still-segregated South. \"On the return, my family pulled into Washington and parked in front of the Smithsonian,\" Bunch said. \"Then my dad explained that I could visit the Smithsonian and not worry about being turned away because of race.\" Regent Risa Lavizzo-Mourey closed the ceremony followed by Kenny Lattimore performing the Black National Anthem \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\"\n\nAs a public health precaution due to COVID-19 (coronavirus), all Smithsonian museums in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and in New York City, including the National Zoo, temporarily closed to the public starting Saturday, March 14, 2020. All public programs were canceled through the summer. All Smithsonian facilities around the globe, including Panama, Hawaii, Arizona, New York, etc., were also closed, with only the most essential employees onsite, to protect buildings, collections, animals, equipment, and other resources. All non-essential employees who could telework were placed in telework status; those who could not telework were placed on emergency leave. All academic appointments, such as interns and fellows, were postponed. All travel was canceled. The health and safety of Smithsonian visitors, staff, and volunteers was a top priority. Smithsonian administrators, led by Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III, closely monitored the coronavirus situation and maintained ongoing communication with local health officials, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the staff, and the public."
