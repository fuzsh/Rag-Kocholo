If you decide to sign up for Part B, the cost will be taken out of your monthly benefit amount. Be sure to plan ahead for that reduction.\n\nDetermine when to sign up for Medicare\n\nWithholding taxes from benefit payments\n\nYou may pay federal income taxes on your benefits if your combined income (50% of your benefit amount plus any other earned income) exceeds $25,000/year filing individually or $32,000/year filing jointly. You can pay the IRS directly or have taxes withheld from your payment.\n\nRequest to withhold taxes\n\nContinuing to work\n\nBefore Full Retirement Age (between age 66 and 67), your benefit payment will be temporarily reduced if you earn more than your earnings limit this year. You can work after Full Retirement Age and earn as much as you’d like without reducing your benefit payment.\n\nKnowing your \"Full Retirement Age\"\n\n\"Full Retirement Age\" is a point in time between age 66 and 67, which we use to determine your benefit amount, as well as your family's benefits. Regardless of your Full Retirement Age, your payment will be higher the longer you wait to apply, up until age 70.\n\nYour Full Retirement Age is\n\n*If you were born Jan 1st, select the year before your birth year\n\nWhen to apply\n\nTiming your first benefit payment\n\nYou can time your first benefit payment to avoid a gap in income. Your first check won't arrive until the month after the one you pick in your application. You can apply any time up to four months before the month you pick.\n\nFor example, you want your first check in April. Follow this timing:\n\nApply in November, December, January, February, or March\n\nPick March in the application\n\nGet the first check in April\n\nGetting the maximum amount because of a current or former spouse's work\n\nIf you’re eligible because of a spouse’s work, the amount is at its highest at your “Full Retirement Age\" (between 66 and 67). It doesn’t increase if you wait and apply after that time. If your spouse has passed away, you may be eligible for Survivor benefits starting at age 60, or at age 50 if you are disabled.\n\nLearn more about Spouse and Survivor benefits."
