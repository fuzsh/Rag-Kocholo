        "text": "December 23, 1913 | Policy Toolbox: Federal Reserve Act\n\nWoodrow Wilson signs the Federal Reserve Act into law on December 23, creating the Federal Reserve System during the recession of 1913-1914. The Act does not directly mention monetary policy, but it does direct the Fed to \"furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper.\" To perform that role, Federal Reserve Banks are given a lending facility—their discount windows—through which member commercial banks can rediscount eligible financial assets in exchange for currency or deposit balances with the Fed. The Federal Reserve Act explicitly prohibits the rediscount of \"notes, drafts, or bills covering merely investments or issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading stocks, bonds, or other investment securities, except bonds and notes of the Government of the United States.\"\n\nFull Text of the Federal Reserve Act\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Federal Reserve Act Signed into Law\n\n1914-1919 | World War I\n\nThe outbreak of World War I just before the opening of the Federal Reserve affects the international gold market and the policies of European central banks. By setting a low discount rate on loans secured by Treasury securities, the Federal Reserve encourages banks to purchase U.S. government securities. The Fed's open market purchases increase System holdings of Treasury securities from $66 million in June 1917 to $236 million in June 1919.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Federal Reserve's Role During WWI\n\nNovember 16, 1914 | Federal Reserve Banks open\n\nIn the early years of the Federal Reserve System, the twelve Reserve Banks are relatively autonomous and set their own policies and discount rates with approval from the Board. Many early Fed leaders and other prominent bankers are proponents of the \"real bills doctrine,\" which asserts that Fed lending will not cause inflation if restricted to rediscounting of short-term \"paper\" or \"bills\" in the form of commercial and agricultural loans.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Reserve Banks Open for Business\n\nDecember 31, 1914 | First Open Market Purchases\n\nThe New York Fed, under the leadership of Benjamin Strong Jr., makes the System's first open market purchase ($5 million in New York City tax anticipation bonds) less than 2 months after the Banks open. Early open market purchases are conducted primarily to bolster Reserve Bank earnings. At the first conference of the twelve Reserve Bank governors (now called presidents), New York becomes the de facto coordinator of open market operations.\n\nBoard policy on purchase of warrants, December 30, 1914\n\nSeptember 7, 1916 | Policy Toolbox: Member Borrowing\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act is amended in 1916 to permit member banks to borrow directly from the Fed with eligible collateral. These new loans are called \"advances\"—a change from the earlier form of Fed lending, known as \"discounts.\" With a discount, the member bank endorsed and then borrowed against a specific commercial or agricultural loan. When the loan matured, the proceeds were used to repay the Fed. If the original borrower defaulted, the member bank was still required to pay the loan's value to the Fed.\n\nAnnual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 1916: Amendments to the Act\n\n1922 | Coordinated Open Market Operations\n\nBeginning in 1922, the Fed Governors Conference sets up a \"Committee on the Centralized Execution of Purchases and Sales of Government Securities\" to recommend specific open market purchases and rates and to execute orders of the twelve Banks. Benjamin Strong of the New York Fed chairs the new committee.\n\nArchival materials: Committee of Governors on Centralized Execution of Purchases and Sales of Government Securities Records, 1922-1923\n\nApril 1923 | Policy Toolbox: The OMIC\n\nThe Board moves to replace the Governors' committee with the Open Market Investment Committee (OMIC) to centralize open market operations under the general supervision of the Board and away from individual Reserve Banks. It is also intended to better coordinate Federal Reserve and Treasury policies. The new OMIC, consisting of five Reserve Bank governors, coordinates open market purchases across the Federal Reserve Banks, but individual Banks still conduct some independent open market operations.\n\nAnnual Report of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 1923: Open Market Policy and Operations\n\nArchival materials: Open Market Investment Committee Records, 1922-1930\n\nAugust 1929-August 1945 | The Great Depression\n\nThe period known as the Great Depression begins with a severe recession in late 1929. That recession lasts until 1933. The Fed's policy actions in response to the recession, including allowing the collapse of the banking system, have significant repercussions. As the economy recovers, another significant recession occurs in 1937-38. Decades later, in a 2002 speech, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledges the views of scholars such as Milton Friedman regarding the Fed's policy errors: \"Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.\"\n\nNBER: US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Great Depression\n\nAugust 23, 1935 | Banking Act of 1935\n\nThe Banking Act of 1935 creates the FOMC's modern structure, including the rotation of Reserve Bank presidents. Control of open market operations is officially vested in the FOMC. These operations are implemented through the trading facilities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Act also consolidates control of the other tools of monetary policy in the Board of Governors. (These tools include setting reserve requirements and authority over the discount rate in each Federal Reserve District.)\n\nFull text of the Banking Act of 1935\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Banking Act of 1935\n\nMarch 18, 1936 | First Meeting of the Modern FOMC\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee changes set forth in the Banking Act of 1935 take effect. Marriner Eccles, who had been Governor of the Federal Reserve Board since November 14, 1934, becomes the first Chairman of the new FOMC. (He had become Chairman of the new Board of Governors in February 1936.)\n\nFRASER Theme: Federal Open Market Committee\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Federal Open Market Committee\n\nFederal Reserve History profile of Marriner S. Eccles\n\n1936-1937 | Policy Toolbox: Reserve Requirements\n\nAn inflow of gold in the mid-1930s increases the \"excess reserves\" of member banks, which increases the risk of inflationary credit expansion. To reduce excess reserves, the Board uses its new power granted by the Banking Act of 1935 to increase reserve requirements in three steps during 1936-37 (turning excess into required reserves). The Treasury begins to sterilize gold inflows.\n\nSt. Louis Fed paper: 'Navigating Constraints: The Evolution of Federal Reserve Monetary Policy, 1935-1959'\n\nAugust 1941 | Policy Toolbox: Regulation W\n\nFollowing the Executive Order of August 9, the Federal Reserve establishes Regulation W to regulate consumer credit for purchases of durable goods. Between 1941 and 1952, the Fed regulates and restricts consumer credit for products including automobiles, appliances, TVs, vacuums, furniture, and even jewelry. Between 1950 and 1952, the Fed also regulates mortgage lending under Regulation X. Both programs are intended to combat inflation without causing interest rates on Treasury securities to rise.\n\nTreasury Office of Financial Research paper: 'The History of Cyclical Macroprudential Policy in the United States'\n\nFebruary 20, 1946 | Employment Act of 1946\n\nThe Employment Act makes a \"declaration of policy\" that it is the responsibility of the federal government to \"promote maximum employment, production and purchasing power.\" The bill acknowledges the importance of maintaining purchasing power—that is, the need to keep inflation in check.\n\nFull text of the Employment Act of 1946\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Employment Act of 1946\n\nApril 15, 1948 | McCabe Becomes Chairman\n\nThomas B. McCabe is sworn in as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. (President Truman declines to renominate Marriner Eccles to the position, but Eccles remains on the Board as a Governor for another two and a half years.)\n\nFederal Reserve History profile of Thomas B. McCabe\n\nStatements and Speeches of Thomas B. McCabe\n\nJanuary 25, 1951 | Tension with Treasury Builds\n\nDuring testimony to congress, Chairman Eccles breaks with the \"real bills\" tradition when he states that it is the unrestrained creation of bank reserves in defense of the rate peg that made the Federal Reserve into \"an engine of inflation.\"\n\nHearings before the Joint Committee on the Economic Report: Statement of Marriner S. Eccles\n\nMarch 4, 1951 | Policy Toolbox: Treasury-Fed Accord\n\nThe Treasury and the Fed issue a statement that they have \"reached full accord with respect to debt management and monetary policies to be pursued in furthering their common purpose and to assure the successful financing of the government's requirements and, at the same time, to minimize monetization of the public debt.\" The new accord freed the Fed to pursue an independent monetary policy.\n\nFRASER Timeline: Treasury-Fed Accord\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Economic Quarterly special issue on the Accord\n\nRichmond Fed paper: 'The Treasury-Fed Accord: A New Narrative Account'\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Treasury-Fed Accord\n\n1953 | Lean-against-the-wind\n\nThe FOMC under Chairman Martin begins to lower interest rates in response to recession. This began what would later be known as the era of \"lean against the wind\"—that is, of monetary policy dedicated to the stabilization of economic activity. This policy stance would last throughout the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nWilliam McChesney Martin Jr.: Statement before Joint Meeting of Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and its Denver Branch\n\nOctober 19, 1955 | The punch bowl speech\n\nChairman Martin gives his famous \"punch bowl\" speech, stating that the Federal Reserve is in the position of a \"chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.\" This famous metaphor illustrated the Fed's philosophy of slowing inflation in expansionary times and stimulating the economy during downturns, in an attempt to avoid catastrophic crashes and recessions.\n\nInside FRASER blog: Martin’s Punch Bowl Metaphor\n\nThe 'Punch Bowl' speech, October 19, 1955\n\n1958 | Launch of the Bretton Woods System\n\nWith the elimination of exchange controls for current-account transactions, the Bretton Woods system launches as an international system in which other countries' currencies are pegged to the dollar and the dollar is set to $35 per ounce of gold. The Fed's responsibility under this system is to set monetary policy to maintain the fixed exchange rate.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Launch of the Bretton Woods System\n\nSt. Louis Fed paper by Allan Meltzer, historian of the Fed: 'U.S. Policy in the Bretton Woods Era'\n\nBoard of Governors: Meeting Minutes, December 3, 1965\n\nNovember 1958 | The \"Phillips Curve\" Published\n\nIn the journal Economica, William Phillips documents a negative relationship between wage inflation and unemployment in the United Kingdom. By the mid-1960s, economists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow note a similar relationship in the United States between price inflation and unemployment. The Phillips curve captures a tradeoff that policymakers of the time began to consider when setting policy: They could pursue lower unemployment if they were willing to accept higher inflation. Conversely, if they wanted to pursue lower inflation, they would have to accept higher unemployment and less economic activity. Many scholars believe the Phillips Curve influenced monetary policymakers for decades.\n\nRichmond Fed article: 'The Early History of the Phillips Curve'\n\n1965-1982 | Great Inflation\n\nBetween 1965 and 1982, the U.S. economy experiences four recessions and two major energy shocks and sees inflation balloon from around 1% to over 14%. Economists widely agree that Fed policy contributed to the high inflation, but they disagree about the underlying reasons. Some suggest that the Fed succumbed to political pressure, or failed to account for the distinction between nominal and real interest rates, while others argue that the Fed mistook trends in potential output and took overly stimulative policy actions.\n\nNBER: US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Great Inflation\n\nApril 1971 | Transparency: M1, M2, and M3 Debut\n\nThe three measures of the money stock are first published by the Board in April 1971. The existing money stock measure becomes \"M1\"; \"M2\" adds savings deposits and certificates of deposit; and \"M3\" adds deposits at mutual savings banks and savings and loans. (M3 is discontinued in 2006.)\n\nBoard of Governors: Benchmark Revision of the Money Stock Measures (H.6) Statistical Release, April 22, 1971\n\nNovember 16, 1977 | Federal Reserve Reform Act\n\nThe new Federal Reserve Reform Act explicitly directs the Fed to \"promote the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates\" and requires the Board of Governors to report at semiannual hearings before both the House and Senate about the FOMC's objectives, performance, and plans for the growth of money and credit.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977\n\nFull text of the Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977\n\nNovember 27, 1978 | Transparency: Humphrey-Hawkins\n\nThe Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (often called the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, after its two congressional sponsors) establishes new reporting mandates for Fed monetary policy. Specifically, it requires the Board of Governors to submit a written report twice a year and requires the Chair to testify to both the Senate and House committees that oversee banking.

Chairman Volcker states the FOMC is prepared to allow interest rates to fluctuate more widely than at any time in recent history in order to focus on controlling the growth of bank reserves and the money supply. By June 1981, the federal funds rate would reach a peak of 20%.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Volcker's Anti-Inflation Actions\n\nArchival materials: Volcker collection records relating to October 6, 1979\n\nJune 1983 | Transparency: Beige Book Debuts\n\nThe \"Summary of Commentary on Current Economic Conditions by Federal Reserve District,\" known as the \"Beige Book\" for the color of its original cover, is first released to the public.

A year later at the February 1995 FOMC meeting, policy statements become part of the communication process for all monetary policy changes.\n\nBoard of Governors: February 4, 1994 press release\n\nBoard of Governors: FOMC 1994 Records\n\nBoard of Governors: Minutes of the January 31-February 1, 1995 FOMC meeting\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 | Response to the September 11 Attacks\n\nIn response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the Board of Governors issues a simple statement that \"The Federal Reserve System is open and operating. The discount window is available to meet liquidity needs.\" The FOMC follows up by lowering the federal funds rate target by 50 basis points, to 3 percent. It also states that it will continue to \"supply unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets, as needed, until more normal market functioning is restored.\"\n\nBoard of Governors: September 11, 2001 press release\n\nStatements and Speeches of Michael H.

A compilation and summary of these projections is circulated to participants, and a detailed summary of the economic projections (the Summary of Economic Projections, or \"SEP\") is included as an addendum to the minutes that are released three weeks after the meeting.\n\nBoard of Governors: Summary of Economic Projections from the October 30-31, 2007 FOMC meeting\n\nBoard of Governors: Guide to the Summary of Economic Projections\n\nDecember 2007-June 2009 (18 months) | Great Recession\n\nThe \"Great Recession\" begins in December 2007 and ends in June 2009. The Federal Reserve's response to the recession and financial crisis evolves over time. Initially, the Fed employs traditional policy actions by reducing the federal funds rate from 5.25 percent in September 2007 to a range of 0-0.25 percent in December 2008. Then, with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the FOMC begins to use its policy statement to provide forward guidance for the federal funds rate. In addition, the Fed pursues two other types of nontraditional policy actions. One set of nontraditional policies is characterized as credit easing programs that seeks to facilitate credit flows and reduce the cost of credit. Another set of nontraditional policies consists of the large-scale asset purchase (LSAP) programs. With the federal funds rate near zero, the asset purchases are implemented to push down longer-term public and private borrowing rates.\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Great Recession\n\n2008-2014 | Large-scale Asset Purchases\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, to ease the stance of monetary policy, the FOMC authorizes three rounds of large-scale asset purchases (also known as \"quantitative easing\") as well as the Maturity-Extension Program (known publicly as \"Operation Twist\") which was designed to extend the average maturity of Treasury securities in the Federal Reserve's portfolio. These unconventional tools are used on different occasions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and promote the stability of the financial system itself, especially when the FOMC's target for the federal funds rate (the Fed's policy rate) is at the effective lower bound (0 to 25 basis points).\n\nBoard of Governors: December 30, 2008 press release\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: The Great Recession\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York overview: Large-Scale Asset Purchases\n\nDecember 16, 2008 | Setting the Zero Lower Bound\n\nThe FOMC votes to establish a target range for the effective federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 percent. This is the first time the lower end of the range was set to zero (sometimes known as the \"zero lower bound\"); the rate stays at this unprecedented low rate until December 16, 2015.\n\nBoard of Governors: Minutes of the December 15-16, 2008 FOMC meeting\n\nJuly 21, 2010 | Dodd-Frank Changes Emergency Lending\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act provides wide-ranging prescriptions aimed at correcting the causes of the 2007-09 financial crisis. Through Dodd-Frank the Federal Reserve lost some autonomy to extend emergency credit to non-bank institutions. Specifically, Dodd-Frank requires explicit approval by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to set up any such programs and limits non-bank lending to programs that are broadly available to many firms rather than lending to a single borrower.\n\nFull text of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n\nFederal Reserve History essay: Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010\n\nDecember 16, 2015 | Policy Toolbox: Liftoff\n\nThe FOMC lifts the target range for the federal funds rate above the zero lower bound for the first time since December 16, 2008, using new monetary tools such as interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility.\n\nBoard of Governors: December 16, 2015 press release\n\nJune 13, 2018 | Transparency: Press Conferences after Every FOMC Meeting\n\nTo increase policy transparency, Chair Powell announces that beginning in January 2019, he will hold a press conference after each scheduled FOMC meeting.

The FOMC says it will monitor developments and use its tools to support the economy.\n\nBoard of Governors: March 3, 2020 press release\n\nMarch 15, 2020 | Policy Toolbox: Response to COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nTo support the economy and financial markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, the FOMC takes decisive action, providing support in three ways: (1) To reduce borrowing costs for households and businesses, the FOMC lowers the federal funds rate to 0 to 25 basis points; (2) the Fed buys U.S. Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to stabilize financial markets; (3) the Fed uses the authority granted in Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and communities by introducing several temporary lending and funding facilities. For example, the Paycheck Protection Liquidity Facility supported the related Paycheck Protection Program created by the CARES Act and administered by the Small Business Association.\n\nBoard of Governors: March 15, 2020 press release\n\nBoard of Governors: Index of COVID-19 resources and response\n\nSt. Louis Fed Economic Education primer: 'COVID-19’s Effects on the Economy and the Fed’s Response'\n\nFRASER Timeline of COVID-19 policy response\n\nAugust 27, 2020 | Transparency: FOMC Updates Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy\n\nThe FOMC updates its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy to read that it \"seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time\" and that it will be informed by its \"assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.\" The new language is referred to as a flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) policy and communicates the FOMC's understanding that its inflation goal is symmetric around 2 percent.\n\nBoard of Governors: August 27, 2020 press release\n\nMarch 12, 2021 | Policy Toolbox: FOMC Formally Sets Reserve Requirements to Zero\n\nThe Board of Governors adopts a final rule, without change, to lower reserve requirement ratios to 0 percent. While reserve requirements have been largely irrelevant as a monetary policy tool for many years, the ruling effectively ends reserve requirements as an active monetary policy tool.\n\nBoard of Governors: March 12, 2021 press release\n\nJuly 2021 | Policy Toolbox: FOMC Establishes Two Standing Repo Facilities\n\nThe two standing repo facilities (one for domestic and another for foreign or international authorities) will serve as backstops in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning.
