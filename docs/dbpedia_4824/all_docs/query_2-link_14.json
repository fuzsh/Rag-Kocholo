        "text": "Printable Catalog with Mintage Statistics for Items Designed and Minted by Daniel Carr / Moonlight Mint.\n\n1963 and 1975 Kennedy Half Dollars  Production Blog\n\nAll are over-struck on genuine US Mint Kennedy half dollars (circa 1964-1990), unless otherwise noted.\n\nSome were broad-struck and/or multiply struck with moderate shift between strikes.\n\nOn June 4 1963, President John F Kennedy issued Executive Order # 11110. This order enabled the US Treasury to issue blue-seal Silver Certificates and possibly red-seal United States Notes directly, bypassing the Federal Reserve. This would have effectively diminished the power of the Federal Reserve to create money and loan it at interest to the US Government. A few months later on November 22 1963 President Kennedy was assassinated under highly-suspicious circumstances. Later, on June 4 1968, President Kennedy's like-minded brother and presidential candidate Robert Kennedy was also assassinated, again under highly-suspicious circumstances.\n\nShortly after the JFK assassination, the US Mint began working on a Kennedy half dollar coin, and the first examples were produced in 1964. The earliest of those proof versions used a slightly modified \"Accented Hair\" portrait. These over-strikes (without mint-mark) replicate the Accented Hair obverse (die pairs 1, 2, and 3). The mint-marked (D and S) over-strikes utilize the normal obverse (die pairs 4, 5, and 6).\n\nNo Kennedy half dollars were originally produced with \"1963\" dates.\n\nNo Kennedy Half Dollars were originally issued with \"1975\" dates because the \"1776-1976\" Bicentennial coins were minted during the 1975 and 1976 calendar years.\n\nNOTE: These are NOT endorsed by the US Treasury. Defacing of US coins is legal so long as the defacement isn't for fraudulent purposes.\n\nProduction listed in chronological order - newest production at top, oldest production at bottom.\n\nCurrent Status:\n\nAll Die Pairs have all been totally defaced and scrapped, and no more coins will be produced by them."
