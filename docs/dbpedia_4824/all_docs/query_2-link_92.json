        "text": "The Value of an Education Award\n\nThe amount of a full-time Segal AmeriCorps Education Award is equivalent to the maximum value of the Pell Grant for the fiscal year in which the term of national service is approved. The amount of the Pell Grant can change each year. Therefore, the amount of a full-time award can change. Once an individual earns an award, the dollar amount of that award will not change. The award amount varies based on the term of service completed.\n\nFind out more\n\nPay Educational Expenses\n\nYou can use your education award to pay current educational expenses at eligible schools and at certain GI Bill-approved educational programs for veterans.\n\nEligible schools are higher educational institutions, both domestic and foreign, that currently participate in the Department of Educationâ€™s Title IV student aid programs. This category includes most post-secondary colleges, universities, and technical schools.\n\nFind out more\n\nEducation Award Eligibility\n\nThe amount of a full-time Segal AmeriCorps Education Award is equivalent to the maximum value of the Pell Grant for the fiscal year in which the term of national service is approved. The amount of the Pell Grant can change each year. Therefore, the amount of a full-time award can change. Once an individual earns an award, the dollar amount of that award will not change. The award amount for less than half-time service programs varies based on the required terms of service.\n\nAnyone who completes a term of service within a 12-month period, in one of the following programs, is eligible to earn an education award.\n\nAmeriCorps NCCC\n\nAmeriCorps State and National\n\nAmeriCorps VISTA*\n\n*VISTA members who complete a term of service within a 12-month period may be eligible to choose a cash option in place of the education award.\n\nEducation Award Limitations\n\nThere are limitations on the number of terms an individual can serve in each AmeriCorps program, and on the maximum value of education awards one individual can receive.\n\nCurrent limits on number of terms an individual can serve:\n\nAmeriCorps NCCC- no limit on service terms, but members may NOT serve more than two consecutive NCCC terms without a break of at least 10 months before serving again\n\nAmeriCorps State and National- four terms\n\nAmeriCorps VISTA- five total years of service\n\nAlthough an individual can serve more than two terms, a person cannot earn more than the aggregate value of two, full-time education awards.\n\nEach term of service for which an individual earns an education award counts as one term of service in computing the term limitations. This includes terms for which a member earns a full-time, half-time, and any other type part-time or prorated education award. A prorated education award is an award that may be earned when an individual, for reasons beyond his or her control, cannot complete the entire service period. Generally, if a member is released before completing a term of service and does not receive the education award, that term counts as one of the terms served."
