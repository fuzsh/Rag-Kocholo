        "text": "LRC News Releases\n\nTask force receives update on state use of AI\n\nArtificial Intelligence Task Force Co-chair Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, asks a question about the future of AI in Kentucky during Tuesdayâs task force meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — For nearly a year, the Commonwealth Office of Technology (COT) has worked to learn all it can about artificial intelligence technology.\n\nRuth Day, chief information officer at COT, told the Kentucky legislatureâs Artificial Intelligence Task Force what the agency has learned and how itâs being used by state government on Tuesday.\n\nâSince we are early in the journey, I can tell you thatâs very limited use,â Day said. COT currently has a list of all the AI tools that have been procured, but how theyâre being used is decided agency-by-agency, she added.\n\nThe Cabinet for Health and Family Services, for example, is using a generative AI tool to identify on its self-service portal where users are spending most of their time to indicate where users might be having difficulty with the portal, Day said.\n\nCOT currently has 30 AI tools available for agency use, according to Day. In order to ensure ethical usage and privacy protection, COT is also drafting a new AI policy that will strengthen the agencyâs current technology usage policies.\n\nAdditionally, Day said COT has been using a process called Kentucky Information Technology Standards during the AI tech procurement process. Staff is also undergoing annual training on AI.\n\nIn September 2023, COT held an âAI Dayâ where Day and other staff met with several companies like Google and Microsoft about AI.\n\nâThe key takeaway that my team and I heard â¦ was understand that generative AI, like ChatGPT, is powerful. But know what you put into those public, free models are then in the public domain,â Day said.\n\nBeing aware of bias, data quality, privacy and other accuracy issues were also topics of concern.\n\nâIn all use cases of generative AI, there must be human oversight and human review of the output,â Day added.\n\nCo-chair Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, asked: âDo you feel like we have a good handle on employees being wise about their uses?â\n\nDay said she does, however, COT is still working on understanding how to use all the AI tools currently available.\n\nFollowing up on that topic, Co-chair Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, asked Day what the state can expect to see with AI in the next two years.\n\nâWill we see AI maybe within the unemployment system to maybe help process some of these claims?â Bray asked. âNationally, weâve seen an uptick in unemployment insurance claims. The markets have kind of appeared to cool off, and there are some that think weâre headed towards a recession. Is the commonwealth prepared for that?â\n\nDay said the future of AI in Kentucky is being discussed every day.\n\nâIâm not familiar with all the workings of the unemployment insurance, but I do know they have had great success in this optical character recognition,â Day said. âItâs not the stuff you knew 10 years ago. Itâs come a long, long way, and they have a high level of accuracy.â\n\nWith the 2025 legislative session in mind, Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, asked Day when the policy COT is drafting will be finished.\n\nâWe, as a task force, would like to see your report prior to us formulating what weâre going to be doing beginning in January,â he said.\n\nDay said the hope is to have the policy finished before Thanksgiving.\n\nTuesday was the second meeting of the Artificial Intelligence Task Force. The special committee is tasked with studying AI systems and how theyâre being used by Kentucky government agencies and other states.\n\nThe task force will also provide recommendations on how Kentuckyâs use of AI systems would benefit state agencies and the legislative initiatives needed to provide consumer protection in the private and public sectors.\n\nThe task forceâs next meeting is currently scheduled for 11 a.m. on Sept. 10.\n\nCommittee hears from trauma network advocates, others\n\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, speaks Tuesday during a meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services. He also serves as committee co-chair. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Health Services heard Tuesday from paramedic and emergency medical technician advocates, trauma network supporters and other medical-related stakeholders.\n\nJohn Holder, chair of the Kentucky Board of Emergency Medical Services, said EMS groups are âhemorrhaging providers,â causing great concern.\n\nâThe EMS in Kentucky has an attrition rate of 21% among our providers right now. That means for us, two out of 10 of our providers will not return and will not certify again next year,â he said.\n\nAdditionally, Holder said the call volume is up 30,000 runs from the time a legislative task force started examining the situation approximately two years ago.\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said he filed legislation last year dubbed the âsuper speeder bill.â He said itâs modeled after legislation in Georgia, a state that didnât have a trauma network and needed a way to fund it.\n\nâSo, in Georgia, if you go 20 miles over the speed limit, you get an additional $200 fine, which is put into a trauma fund. And for Georgia, this generates $20 million a year. The legislation I filed â I had a compromise on it. It would actually call for 25 miles over the speed limit,â he said.\n\nMeredith said the fines could possibly generate $9 million a year in Kentucky by using the 25-mile-an-hour speeding infraction. He said that could help improve the EMT situation in Kentucky, bolster the Kentucky Rural Hospital Revolving Loan Program and pay for new automated external defibrillators (AEDs).\n\nSen. Karen Berg, D-Louisville, who is a physician, said she favors allowing inmates who are trained to be emergency medical technicians to keep practicing once they are released from incarceration.\n\nâTheyâve already been selected. Theyâve already been trained. This is just a suggestion. I made it years ago. Nobody wanted to listen to it because these people have felony convictions, but the truth is you have a right to make up a debt to society,â she said.\n\nRep. Lisa Willner, D-Louisville, asked Holder what paramedic and EMT leaders need from the legislators to increase reimbursement rates. She expressed apprehension that paramedics and EMTs donât get reimbursed when patients arenât transported to a hospital.\n\nHolder said treatment in place is a good thing because patients donât have to go to a hospital unnecessarily and hospitals donât have to incur the costs if patients can be treated in the field.\n\nâBasically, we would need support from you to increase those reimbursement rates. Weâre moving our advanced practice paramedics forward, including community paramedics and mobile integrated health programs,â he said. âLooking forward in the very near future, weâre going to be looking for avenues for those folks to be reimbursed when they go out and provide that care.â\n\nCommittee members also heard from Richard âDickâ Bartlett, Kentucky State Trauma Program Director for the Kentucky Hospital Association, who said trauma is a severe health problem and is a major cause of death and long-term disability. He said trauma centers save lives and money.\n\nâWe have built a system essentially using voluntary assistance, grants and gifts, and weâve grown it from four verified trauma centers in 2008 to where we are today, which is about 23. And Iâve got probably five to seven more that are working hard to become trauma centers down the road.\" he said.\n\nMeredith said the cost of doing nothing to remedy trauma system and EMT/paramedic situations would be staggering.\n\nâWe heard from the trauma system that they want $1 million. Really, thatâs not that much money, but the return is just phenomenal. The EMTs are asking for $3 million and $6 million over the biennium. Again, the return on investment could be incredible,â he said.\n\nCounty jail needs discussed at interim committee\n\nSen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, speaks on ways to reduce costs at county jails during the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government meeting on Monday. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Counties are struggling to fund jails, according to county jailers, judge-executives, and other stakeholders.\n\nA presentation on the financial burden county jails have on local governments was given to the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government on Monday. Kentucky Association of Counties (KACo) Executive Director Jim Henderson said the fiscal impact jails have on counties is challenging and complex.\n\nIn Kentucky, about 43 out of 120 counties do not have a jail, he added, and funding for jails comes from several different sources. For jails that house federal inmates, they receive some federal reimbursement. But Kentucky counties spend about $350 million per year to operate jails, Henderson said.\n\nRowan County Judge-Executive Harry Clark joined Henderson to talk about the jail funding issue. In 2018, Rowan County opened a new 279-bed facility where a third of the inmates come from other counties.\n\nSix out of the seven counties surrounding Rowan County do not have a jail, so they fit a need for the region. However, the cost of operating the jail is still an issue, Clark said.\n\nâWeâre struggling now,â Clark said. âThe counties are definitely struggling to keep up these jails, so we need to come up with a long-term solution, whatever that may be.â\n\nClark said cleaning and food costs have increased over the last few years making the fiscal issue worse. He suggested that contracting for some services might reduce costs.\n\nâItâs bleeding us dry,â Clark said. âThereâs so many other things we could do with the money that weâre spending on this.â\n\nMenifee County Judge-Executive Rick Stiltner also spoke before the committee. He said his countyâs jail closed more than 30 years ago, and he doesnât want to open a new one.\n\nCounties without jails in Kentucky are forced to contract with other county jails to house their inmates. Stiltner said this decision saves Menifee County money, but the county is still spending about one-fifth of its budget on prisoner costs.\n\nStiltner said he isnât sure how to fix the issue, but he likes Clarkâs idea to contract out services, like food.\n\nSen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, said bringing certain services in-house has helped Fayette Countyâs jail. It has its own medical facility, which has cut down on transportation costs and has made health care more immediate for inmates, she said.\n\nâIt does not by any means touch long-term the cost of medical, which is huge, but it is something,â she said. âI think itâs a good idea to look at maybe regionally is there some cost savings where we can have people come in to the facilities and provide that careâ\n\nHardin County Attorney Jenny Oldham also spoke before the committee. She said sometimes the medical needs of an inmate are so expensive that the inmate must be released, but she and the jailer do everything they can to prevent that from happening.\n\nRep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, asked if anyone is keeping track of how many inmates have to be released due to expensive medical needs. Oldham said they are not keeping any official data, but it is something they can start doing.\n\nThe length of time an inmate spends waiting for trial was also discussed. Sen. Greg Elkins, R-Winchester, said heâs aware some inmates can spend up to three or five years waiting for trial or a resolution.\n\nâI think weâre going to have to find a way to get those inmates sentenced quicker and through the system quicker,â he said. âOne-thousand-plus days on the county dime is unreasonable.â\n\nOldham said there are systems in place to help the courts cut down on jail time, but bail schedules are an issue. She said the Administrative Office of the Courts sets those.\n\nâThose are not local,â Oldham said. âI donât think that is conducive to having the right kind of control to reduce those costs.â\n\nCommittee members hear testimony on EPA standards\n\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, speaks during Thursdayâs meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. He also serves as co-chair of the committee. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — During Thursdayâs meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, members heard testimony about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâs rule on greenhouse gas standards and guidelines for coal-fired power plants.\n\nA state Department for Environmental Protection official, an attorney with experience in environmental law and an attorney from Kentuckyâs Office of the Attorney General offered comments. Lawmakers questioned how the rules would affect new and existing power plants that run on coal, oil or gas.\n\nAllison D. Wood, a partner at the McGuireWoods law firm, said many states are opposing the rule, but others support it.\n\nâThis is in fact a final rule. It is being litigated vigorously by not just states, but also many industry parties,â she said. âThere are 27 states that are challenging the final greenhouse gas rule, including the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and there are 22 states that are defending it.â\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said affordability and reliability could be affected soon âif we continue on the current path.â\n\nHe said he doubts the rule would be attainable, and the state is being forced to switch from coal to other energy sources.\n\nâWe still have a lot of unanswered questions. The problem that we have is that with the new rule â the things that theyâre talking about â 90% sequestration of carbon dioxide is probably not possible, certainly not feasible. Itâs not something that can be done as far as cost is concerned,â Gooch said.\n\nLike Gooch, Committee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said heâs also a skeptic.\n\nSmith said he was on a clean air task force in China before the Olympics, and the Chinese government sought âblue sky days,â when the air is cleaned up so the sky can be viewed.\n\nâWhen I was there with the task force, every single industry we went to couldnât wait to get past the preliminaries and introductions so they could show us their new generators that they had purchased in America,â Smith said. âAnd so, they would use their quota from the government. As soon as they reached their 10,000 megawatts or whatever they had, they would fire up these generators which would cause pollution at a different level than I think China had ever dreamed would happen.â\n\nWood said the rule would put energy producers in a tough spot by creating standards that arenât achievable. Producers will look to retire plants rather than break the law, she said.\n\nAnthony âTonyâ Hatton, commissioner of the stateâs Department for Environmental Protection, said the federal rule requires Kentucky to submit a state implementation plan for the new rule in 2026.\n\nâIntuition, no value judgment, but intuition says that there will be impacts, potential impacts to current and future electric generation,â he said.\n\nHatton said property would need to be set aside for carbon sequestration, and issues would arise with private landowners. In some states, there might be issues surrounding surface rights and minerals rights â a process that could become extremely complicated, he said.\n\nThe rule potentially forces state officials to choose between meeting requirements of the Clean Air Act or providing electricity as required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Hatton said.\n\nRep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, asked Hatton about facilities across the state and summed up what could happen due to the standards and guidelines.\n\nâBecause of these regulations that theyâre pushing down, weâve going to end up losing some plants or some partial plants, and weâre going to increase rates for our customers across the commonwealth and weaken our power grid is what Iâm hearing from all this. It just all comes into play,â he said.\n\nLawmakers discuss juvenile justice trends, solutions\n\nRep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, asks a question about youth mental health and crime trends during Thursdayâs Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Teen mental health and staffing issues at detention facilities were discussed during a presentation on juvenile justice issues given to lawmakers Thursday.\n\nThe Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary heard from Nina Salomon, deputy division director for the Corrections and Reentry Justice Center with The Council for State Governments (CSG).\n\nCSGâs national data shows the number of incarcerated youth declined by 70% from 2000 to 2022, and youth arrests for violent offenses remain historically low, she said. However, there has been a post-pandemic increase in youth arrests for homicide and weapons, resulting in a concurrent increase in youth victimization.\n\nâWeâve definitely heard a concern around youth violence and youth gun violence in particular,â Salomon said. âWhile youth gun violence remains historically low â a decline of about 54% from 2000 to 2022 â itâs still a long-standing problem, and one that we know deserves further attention and more targeted attention.â\n\nIn Kentucky, Salomon said the data shows behavioral health needs are a significant driver of justice involvement.\n\nStudents in Kentucky report various ways of experiencing trauma, she said, adding that â23% of Kentucky high school students reported ever seeing someone get physically attacked, beaten, stabbed or shot in their neighborhood.â\n\nAlthough the current data is alarming, Salomon said it also shows arrests have declined significantly since 2010.\n\nâThis is a testament to the great work that folks in Kentucky across the board have done over the last several years to reform the front end of the juvenile justice system, and keep kids out of the juvenile justice system who donât need to be there, especially since the passage of that reform bill about a decade ago,â Salomon said.\n\nCSGâs national data also showed more female students reported feeling âsad or hopelessâ in the last year than male students. Rep. Steven Doan, R-Erlanger, asked how the youth crime data reflects those statistics.\n\nâAre we seeing a proportional increase based on that and offenses related to young women as opposed to young men? And if so, how are facilities changing or moving towards addressing young women, particularly with respect to housing as opposed to young men?â Doan asked.\n\nSalomon said males tend to commit more serious offenses than females, who are more likely to commit non-person offenses that are rooted in experiencing behavioral health issues and abuse. She suggested looking deeper at the system as a whole and how it addresses the different needs of females and males experiencing trauma and behavioral health problems.\n\nRep. Keturah Herron, D-Louisville, said the presentation showed 62% of committed youth are status offenders or committed a non-person or technical violation. She asked Salomon what are some solutions to those issues.\n\nSalomon said some states have passed laws that say youth cannot be detained or incarcerated for certain technical violations or they have created graduated response matrices.\n\nStaffing issues at juvenile justice centers was another issue lawmakers wanted to discuss with Salomon. Rep. Nima Kulkarni, D-Louisville, asked what the top reasons were for retention issues.\n\nCOVID-19 changing the way younger people experience the workforce, pay, training, and safety were among the top reasons, Salomon said.\n\nRep. Kimberly Poore Moser, R-Taylor Mill, said prevention and programming are topics the legislature has discussed before.\n\nâI think we need to look into things like better training and mobile crisis response, early assessment, as for that sort of thing upon intake and really see what it is kids need,â she said.\n\nEducation committee discusses DEI efforts at universities\n\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, speaks during Tuesdayâs Interim Joint Committee on Education meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Legislators on the Interim Joint Committee on Education offered a variety of viewpoints Tuesday about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in Kentucky higher education.\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Stephen West, R-Paris, said bills related to DEI programs were filed in both the House and Senate during the 2024 legislative session.\n\nâWe felt that if we were going to broach the subject, if this subject was going to be addressed again, that we should have all the information available to us, and we should have a thorough understanding of what all our postsecondary institutions were doing as it pertains to DEI,â he said.\n\nPresidents of two state universities, a representative from a constitutional advocacy center, and two officials from the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) were on hand to testify and answer lawmakersâ questions.\n\nTravis Powell, vice president and general counsel for CPE, said the Office for Civil Rights found Kentucky in violation of the Civil Rights Act in 1982 due to racial segregation in higher education. CPE was tasked at that time with responding to the U.S. Department of Educationâs desegregation plan.\n\nKentucky was released from the plan in 2008, âwhich was a great accomplishment for the state.â Powell said. âBut we still had this legislation in place in order to set equal educational opportunity goals. So, in 2010, the council created a new diversity plan, and then in 2016, we created a DEI policy that was integrated into our strategic agenda.â\n\nPowell said CPE sets targets for supporting low-income and underrepresented minority students and evaluates campuses based on their progress toward those targets. However, he said, CPE does not set quotas.\n\nâNo one student is discriminated against based on any of our policies that we have in place,â he said, adding that state universities maintain high admission rates. âWe are not about turning anybody away on our campuses at all.â\n\nCady Short-Thompson, president of Northern Kentucky University, and Jay Morgan, president of Morehead State University, also testified about DEI policies on campus.\n\nShort-Thompson said NKU spent 0.34% of its budget on programs and activities related to DEI in fiscal year 2024.\n\nMorgan testified that MSU does not require diversity statements from job applicants, require DEI training or use race-based admissions for students.\n\nLawmakers asked the presenters about several DEI-related issues, including campus pronoun policies, affinity groups and how DEI has impacted academic standing.\n\nSen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, noted that, even though Morehead serves a high-number of low-income students, it has not always met CPEâs targets for DEI. She asked if the campus has been affected by CPEâs scoring process.\n\nMorgan said MSU did not meet the diversity goals one time out of the past seven years. However, he added that it can be hard for MSU to meet the diversity goals while supporting the region. Half of the institutionâs students qualify as low-income, placing serious demands on funding and resources, he said.\n\nâWe do not let diversity take a back seat with respect to the CPE state plan,â he said. âHowever, there have been some times when we have gently disagreed with some of the metrics that were in there.â\n\nTimothy K. Minella, senior constitutionalism fellow at the Goldwater Instituteâs Van Sittert Center for Constitutional Advocacy, testified that CPE annually scores institutions based on DEI metrics.\n\nâThrough this annual process, CPE essentially threatens public institutions, âget on board with racial discrimination and DEI practices or lose the ability to expand your academic offerings to serve students,ââ he said.\n\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, said his grandmother once told him that there were only three or four other Black students when she attended the University of Kentucky in 1955.\n\nHe asked Minella if he wanted to return UK to the 1950s or if he had something else in mind that wasnât included in the report Minella shared with committee members.\n\nMinella said the intent is to prohibit racial discrimination in public institutions of higher education, both in admissions and hiring\n\nHouse Majority Whip Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, said conservatives do themselves a disservice in conflating efforts to help people who have been harmed historically, whether it be redlining, poverty or something else.\n\nâWhat I think we should be hyper focused on is making sure we have intellectual diversity, and making sure that we attack the places in our university that are going after the institutions of western civilization and trying to change our culture like weâve seen all over the country this past year,â he said.\n\nWest said the committee will continue to discuss DEI and hear from state universities in September.\n\nInterim committee hears update on electric vehicle charging program\n\nRep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, asks if a reduction in electric vehicle production is going to slow down the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program rollout. The discussion was part of Tuesdayâs Interim Joint Committee on Transportation meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — In 2022, the federal government granted Kentucky $69.5 million to install electric vehicle charging stations across the state by 2027.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Interim Joint Committee on Transportation heard testimony from John Moore, Kentucky Transportation Cabinet assistant state highway engineer, on the projectâs progress.\n\nThe National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) is funded by the federal 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Moore said the program is focused on building out the alternative fuels corridor, which includes all interstates and parkways.\n\nIn order to receive funding, charging stations are required to be within 50 miles of each other, within a mile of the corridor and publicly available 24/7. The charging stations must also be able to support four simultaneously charging vehicles at 150 kilowatts.\n\nTo date, Moore said the state has awarded two RFPs and $27.2 million to build 42 charging sites.\n\nâOnce these are completely built out, travelers will have access to 168 chargers conveniently located along Kentuckyâs primary corridors,â Moore said.\n\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, asked if a match is required to receive a grant from the program. Moore said it is a reimbursement program.\n\nâWhatever expenditures they have that qualify for the NEVI program, we will reimburse 80% of that,â he added.\n\nSome of the new charging stations will be operational soon. Eleven charging sites should become operational this year with another 21 operational next calendar year, Moore said.\n\nâWeâre optimistic that weâll be able to achieve build out certification in 2026,â Moore said, adding once the federal requirements are met along the corridor, the program will be able to expand beyond the corridor.\n\nRep. Tom Smith, R-Corbin, asked if the Transportation Cabinet is planning to slow down the rollout of the program due to reports of manufacturers cutting back on production of electric vehicles.\n\nâAre you aware of any downtrend in the electric vehicle use? Iâve heard manufacturers say theyâre going back to the hybrid system and not fully electric,â he said.\n\nMoore said the cabinet does not plan on scaling back the rollout of the charging stations. He also said although heâs not fully âdialed-inâ to what is going on in the electric vehicle industry, he knows dependable infrastructure is important for vehicle production.\n\nâPart of the suppression of demand is the lack of dependability traveling long-distances,â Moore added. âRight now, you almost have to plot your course out on a map to figure out if you can make it â¦ This is ideally going to break the logjam and provide that dependable infrastructure.â\n\nNew laws set to take effect in Kentucky next week\n\nNew laws passed during the 2024 legislative session will take effect on July 15.

Shawn McPherson, R-Scottsville, speaks Thursday during the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee meeting. A high-resolution photo is available here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Members of the Tobacco Settlement Agreement Fund Oversight Committee learned Thursday how the Community Farm Alliance helps bring healthy food to Kentuckians.\n\nMyrisa K. Christy, executive director of the alliance, and two others offered committee members an overview of the Kentucky Double Dollars and Farmers Market Support Program. Through Kentucky Double Dollars, spending power is increased on Kentucky-grown fruits and vegetables, she said.\n\nThe program is designed to increase sales and income for the state's farmers, develop new farm customers by introducing local food for low-income populations and leverage federal food and nutrition program funds, she said.\n\nâI think it's important to have farmers markets participating in the program and taking ownership, because that's how they're going to end up supporting it long-term and developing the community around it,â Christy said.\n\nSen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, also committee co-chair, said the program is good because it brings healthy food to more people.\n\nâThe dollar program is fantastic, and I know in my county, the farmers markets are critical to providing accessibility to what you need â fresh food,â she said.\n\nRep. Shawn McPherson, R-Scottsville, said he's thinks Allen County leads the state in vegetable production, and he supports the local farmers market on the downtown square and other efforts to put producers' goods in front of potential customers.\n\nâIt's a big thing, and we do a lot with our local square there. We have First Fridays. We do a lot of things so everybody's familiar with and they come to,â he said.\n\nMcPherson said it's a good thing when farmers can take risks and plant more crops annually knowing the demand is there; that the food won't go to waste.\n\nâAnd so, we're always looking to see where we can expand that market,â he said.\n\nRep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville, said her interest was piqued after learning about the program's expansion at Save A Lot stores in Louisville. She asked which locations will participate.\n\nJamie Fitzwater, director of Kentucky Double Dollars, said the group will be at the stores on Portland Avenue and Taylor Boulevard.\n\nRep. Myron Dossett, R-Pembroke, also committee co-chair, expressed concern about inflation.\n\nâAs we have seen for the last three, four years, inflation has impacted every family whether they be low income or going up the economic ladder. We're all experiencing increased costs. We're seeing it within agriculture as well,â he said.\n\nHe asked if there has been an increase in shoppers at farmers markets.\n\nChristy said food service benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic might not be topped. However, there is an increase in awareness of other places to get resources.\n\nShe explained that multiple point surveys are expected to be implemented this year to find out who is being served and how their shopping and eating behaviors change over the long term.\n\nFitzwater said that social media has been a great way to get the word out about Kentucky Double Dollars.\n\nSen. Robin L. Webb, D-Grayson, said promoting a healthy lifestyle will cut down on medical costs and decrease cancer rates and diabetes. She said she would like to see more counties participate in the program.\n\nâI'd like to see SNAP benefits going to promote healthy lifestyles because when you're experiencing cheap foods, carbs, wasted calories and all that, I mean, health is a lifestyle. You talk about dollars in funding, but you can't really quantify reaching those children and the life choices that they make,â she said.\n\nWebb said school family resource centers are the âboots on the groundâ for various nutrition issues.\n\nMays Bledsoe said cooperation between agriculture-related groups will benefit many Kentuckians.\n\nâWhat's so interesting, I think about this committee, is that you do get to see all different partners working together and leveraging funds and resources, because we do want a better and a healthier Kentucky, and that's the goal,â she said.\n\nCitizen members appointed to serve on JCPS task force\n\nThe Efficient and Effective School District Governance Task Force will convene its first meeting at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 15. A high-resolution photo is available here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Legislative leaders have appointed five citizen members to a new task force that will study the administration of Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) and recommend possible reforms ahead of the 2025 legislative session.\n\nHouse Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers established the Efficient and Effective School District Governance Task Force in May. The 13-member panel is tasked with reviewing the district's governance model and identifying areas for potential improvement by Dec. 1.\n\nRep. Kim Banta, R-Fort Mitchell, and Sen. Michael J. Nemes, R-Shepherdsville, will lead the group as co-chairs. They selected the citizen members through a public application process announced last month. The appointments include:\n\nAngela Masden-Wilson and Brittany Abdelahad will serve as resident-parent members. To qualify for the position, both appointees had to be taxpayers living in a school district with an enrollment greater than 75,000. Both had to have competency and experience or knowledge in the field of education and have children who are currently attending or recently graduated within the past five years from the school district. Neither appointee could be a current employee of the district.\n\nJody Wurtenberger will serve as the business member. This role required experience in the finance, management, and operations of large businesses that operate in the commonwealth.\n\nGeorge Nichols will serve as the teacher member. To qualify, this appointee had to be a certified teacher currently employed as a classroom teacher in a school district with enrollment greater than 75,000. The appointee had to have at least five years of experience working in the district.\n\nDr. Rebecca Nicolas will serve as the principal member. She was chosen from a list of three principals nominated by the superintendents of school districts with enrollment of 75,000 or greater.\n\nThe task force is a direct result of House Concurrent Resolution 81, which the Kentucky General Assembly adopted during the 2024 legislative session.\n\nSponsored by Rep. Ken Fleming, R-Louisville, the measure called for a working group to review the administrative functions and learning outcomes of school districts that have more than 75,000 students.\n\nThe task force is also charged with gathering testimony from parents and policy experts and researching the structures and outcomes of similar districts in other states.\n\nFleming will serve on the panel along with Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield; Rep. Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville; and Senate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville.\n\nState Auditor Allison Ball and Louisville Metro Councilman Phillip Baker will serve in the remaining two positions.\n\nAll members of the task force will have voting privileges, and the group will convene its first meeting at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 15.\n\nMore information on the task force is available here on the LRC website.\n\nTask force learns about housing shortage\n\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, speaks during Monday's Kentucky Housing Task Force meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky Housing Task Force, a new legislative panel focused on solutions to housing shortages, heard from several state officials Monday about efforts to address the problem.\n\nSen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, was among those who had questions for officials from the Kentucky Housing Corp., the Kentucky Center for Statistics and the state's Department of Housing, Buildings and Construction.\n\nâThere's a lot of different spokes to this. It's no certain, no one thing can solve this problem. It's going to take a lot of different folks â like I said, a lot of partnerships and the private sector really has to step up and start working on this,â he said.\n\nWendy K. Smith, deputy executive director of Housing Programs for the Frankfort-based Kentucky Housing Corp., said it's vital for the housing supply in Kentucky to be a main focus instead of niche or secondary housing issues.\n\nShe and others presented information from the first phase of the Housing Supply Gap Analysis, a study commissioned by the KHC and released in April.\n\nâIn our view, the housing supply shortage is Kentucky's most urgent issue,â she said. âWhat we're seeing is while Kentucky Housing for 50-plus years has been investing in affordable housing, because there's not enough supply in the overall marketplace, we're losing ground in serving the folks we try to serve.â\n\nSmith said all of Kentucky's counties need housing, and if enough supply existed, the state would have lower average housing costs.\n\nâSupply will bring down costs. That's just, that's economics, right? We would have higher ownership rates. We would have more workforce housing if we just had more supply. We would have lower addiction rates. We would have fewer homeless Kentuckians, and we'd have increased household stability,â she said.\n\nSmith said if there is more housing for higher income people and they can get what they want, people with fewer means will have more options open to them because it is a marketplace. Housing is also closely connected to economic development, she said.\n\nâIf you want jobs, you need homes,â Smith said.\n\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, said Detroit has added housing to the city by using sites that were conducive to construction.\n\nâThey looked at sites that were already ready to go. They already had the infrastructure there. They already had all of the sewer lines, everything, and they rebuilt those areas, part of the metropolitan area,â she said. âAnd everything that I've read, they've done it block by block by block, and they've really stabilized a huge portion of their metropolitan area.â\n\nSenate Minority Whip David Yates, D-Louisville, asked Smith about possible KHC gap incentives for construction companies and developers to spur construction.\n\nâI mean we can, but we don't have any more to work with than we did before. Some of our resources could do that, and are doing that in some communities, but there's not any more to go around. Who are we going to take from I guess is where we're left,â Smith said.\n\nRep. Mike Clines, R-Alexandria, asked Smith if there's a good housing program in another state that KHC favors more than others.\n\nSmith said she would like more time to research the issue, but mentioned Oklahoma's is interesting to her.\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Susan Witten, R-Louisville, said the task force was established after House Concurrent Resolution 68 was adopted during this year's legislative session. The task force is charged with studying and reviewing current and future policy needs to address access and availability of housing for the state's citizens.\n\nWitten said this includes a demographic analysis of housing costs, population and employment opportunities statewide and regionally; a comprehensive review of state and local laws, regulations, policies and procedures that affect housing; analysis of the availability and accessibility of housing; and evaluation of land use, zoning, infrastructure and community planning to identify barriers to attainable and affordable housing.\n\nThe task force will also examine efforts in other areas of the United States to address housing shortages and boost home ownership, she said.\n\nPhase 2 of the Housing Supply Gap Analysis will be a 5-year projection of future supply gaps in Kentucky, Smith said. This report is expected to be released Aug. 21 during the Kentucky Affordable Housing Conference in Louisville, she said.\n\nThe task force's next meeting is scheduled for Monday, July 29 at 1 p.m.\n\nInterim committee discusses implementation of Senate Bill 151\n\nSenate Majority Caucus Chair Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, asks a question about the implementation of Senate Bill 151 during Wednesday's Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — The Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children discussed the future of Senate Bill 151 on Wednesday.\n\nThe general assembly unanimously passed SB 151 earlier this year, which will allow family members who take temporary custody of a relative's child to become certified as a \"child-specific foster home.â The bill will give those caregivers more access to state resources. SB 151 officially becomes law on July 15.\n\nThe bill's primary sponsor, Senate Majority Caucus Chair Julie Raque Adams, R-Louisville, asked Lesa Dennis, commissioner for the Department of Community Based Services, how the Cabinet plans to implement the legislation.\n\nDennis said the Cabinet needs additional funding to implement SB 151.\n\nâThe Cabinet is supportive of Senate Bill 151, but during those conversations we also identified there would be additional funding needed to implement, and that funding was not made available,â Dennis said. âSo at this time, we are still hopeful in the near future that there will be an additional pathway for funding of Senate Bill 151. But without that support, the Cabinet will have difficulty moving forward with implementation.â\n\nAdams said since SB 151 will be law, she isn't sure if the Cabinet can opt not to implement it. She also questioned whether additional funding was requested from the legislature.\n\nâI can also show you documentation from the Cabinet that says that the cost can be absorbed within your current budgetary framework,â Adams said, adding that she would like to hear more from the Cabinet on the issue in July.\n\nSen. Robin L. Webb, D-Grayson, also had questions about the funding issues for SB 151. Dennis said the estimated cost is $20 million.\n\nâIs there any federal relief or anything we could apply for that would ease the burden of that?â Webb asked.\n\nDennis said no, because general funds would support additional staffing and pay for the cost of care for the children.\n\nUnder SB 151, Dennis also said the process the Cabinet will have to use to transition children from a temporary custody situation to relative/fictive kin foster care situation makes the child ineligible for federal reimbursement.\n\nRep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, asked Dennis if there is a different way the Cabinet can implement SB 151 in order to be eligible for federal support.\n\nDennis said no.\n\nâWe have asked our federal partners, and we have worked with our consultants and others in various ways to try to find a solution that would enable us to receive federal funding for this population of children and have not found any workarounds or other options available,â she added.\n\nToward the end of the discussion on the issue, committee co-chair Rep. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, said she wants the Cabinet to come back in July to continue to discuss the implementation of SB 151.\n\nâTo hear that (SB 151) is not going to be implemented because there aren't enough funds when it was stated that the Cabinet could absorb the funds is a major problem,â she said.\n\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Families and Children is currently scheduled for 1 p.m. on July 30. For more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\n\nLawmakers hear from first responder families seeking workers' compensation\n\nRep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, speaks Wednesday about first responder workers' compensation during a meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Family members of those dealing with psychological injuries offered impassioned testimony during Wednesday's meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Veterans, Military Affairs and Public Protection.\n\nRep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, credited Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, with, âa fabulous bill that's been around for many yearsâ and has had bipartisan support.\n\nâKentucky's workers' comp system was created in 1914 with a goal of placing responsibility for workplace injuries on the industry in which such injuries occur as opposed to putting that on the general public,â she said.\n\nBurke said only physical injuries or physical illnesses are covered under current law, and the measure â House Bill 363 â would create a carve-out for psychological injuries experienced as first responders, who are defined as firefighters, EMTs, police, National Guard and front-line social workers.\n\nâOur first responders take great risks to provide services to the public when we're in crisis. They come to us at our worst moments,â she said. âThey see the absolute, most awful things that any of us can imagine. They do it willingly, courageouslyâ¦â\n\nCaleen Treadway of Sharpsburg, cried while testifying about witnessing seizures her father, Bobby Treadway, had that she said were due to PTSD stemming from his EMS employment.\n\nâAnd my dad has dedicated his life to saving others and sacrificing his own life and his time with his family so others would get the opportunity to make it back to their loved ones,â she said. âNo one will ever really know what my dad has seen on these runs or calls or what any of these first responders see on a daily basis.â\n\nLike Treadway, Wendy Johnson spoke about how her husband, Kyle Johnson, was affected by things he saw during period of civil unrest in Louisville. He had been serving in the Kentucky National Guard for eight years when he received orders to go to Louisville.\n\nâWe are here today to address the gap in coverage and benefits for those who find themselves struggling with PTSD. As all of you know, this is mostly an invisible injury, an injury that affects the most important organ in your bodyâ¦It is a real and devastating injury to receive,â she said.\n\nRep. Bill Wesley, R-Ravenna, thanked Burke for presenting the bill, and said National Guard personnel serve the governor and take the same oath as anybody else who has served in the military.\n\nâIf a national guardsman that has taken that same oath, if they're not deployed, they're not considered a veteran, and I think that's wrong. They served in so many different waysâ¦We have people serving all over the world that are from the Commonwealth of Kentucky as a national guardsman,â he said.\n\nRep. Mark Hart, R-Falmouth, said he served for nine years in the National Guard, and more than 30 years as a fire officer and a paramedic. He said there are 23 states with some type of presumption for workers' compensation for mental health for firefighters. He said he wasn't sure if this includes police and EMS in those states. He asked Burke if there are other states with laws providing for workers' compensation for National Guard personnel.\n\nâI do believe it's a similar number. Kentucky is an outlier that we're not providing care for our national guardsmen who are on state deployment,â she said.\n\nRep. Daniel Grossberg, D-Louisville, said those in the National Guard should be treated as a veteran whether they are deployed or not.\n\nâI want it stated in the record that 23 states already have the presumptions for first responders for mental healthâ¦I hope that this bill is expanded to include those who work in the call centers, either the 911 dispatchers or in the cases of 988, I think a 988 dispatcher or person should be included as well,â he said.\n\nSen. Matthew Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, said it's the legislature's job to reduce red tape that holds back services for those who have provided invaluable assistance. He said he's grateful to the General Assembly for funding USA Cares, which addresses possible lapses in policies.\n\nRep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, thanked the families for their testimony and said they were brave for sharing their stories.\n\nâI do not think that vulnerability is a sign or weakness. I do not think that individuals should be humiliated by their circumstances,â she said.\n\nThe next committee meeting is scheduled for July 30 at 11 a.m.\n\nLawmakers learn about companies' power needs, receive an energy outlook\n\nSen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, speaks Thursday about Kentucky's energy needs to meet demands of companies interested in locating in the commonwealth. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Ensuring Kentucky possesses enough energy to attract and retain businesses was only one facet of Thursday's meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy.\n\nCommittee members heard from the chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, two executives from two major industries in the commonwealth and a representative of an energy-related state association.\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said a business person from Indiana recently showed him a power bill from that state. The energy provider was the same, but the cost per kilowatt was much lower â in some cases almost half â and the firm determined that it was cost prohibitive to come to Kentucky.\n\nYears ago, businesses interested in locating here were focused on building specifications, he said. \"Now, I'd say that the No. 1 question that they all ask is what is your power rate.\"\n\nKent A. Chandler, chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said system growth is happening primarily as a result of data center expansion in the Columbus, Ohio and Northern Virginia areas. He expressed concern about replacing current power-generating units.\n\n\"I'm still concerned with our ability to reliably and cost effectively replace energy that is lost from a significant number of retirements of current resources,\" he said. \"One or two here and there I think would be fine. A wholesale replacement of our generating fleet, I don't know what we would build to replace it. I'm being very honest.\"\n\nChandler said in 2023, Kentucky ranked 14th nationwide for residential electricity rates and second east of the Mississippi River behind only Tennessee. The state ranks No. 11 nationwide for industrial rates.\n\n\"On average, our rates across the entire state are very competitive, at least for our entire region,\" he said, citing state profiles by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nRep. DJ Johnson, R-Owensboro, asked Chandler why transmission costs are increasing.\n\n\"I would say that the primary cause of it is the replacement of older transmission with similar or like-kind new transmission,\" Chandler said.\n\nCommittee Co-Chair Rep. Jim Gooch Jr., R-Providence, said the committee is looking for ways to ensure Kentucky has reliability and the availability of power at an affordable cost. However, he said he's not in favor of large corporations that \"blindly follow some of the policies in Washington.\"\n\nGooch said that capturing carbon emissions at a high rate is not feasible and can't be done.\n\nOne of those who testified during the meeting was Cathy Waddell, controller of Ghent-based Nucor Steel Gallatin. She said the company produces sheet steel, which has hundreds of everyday uses. For example, the steel goes into parts for automobiles, solar farms, lawnmowers, appliances and office furniture. Additionally, Nucor opened a second steel mill in Brandenburg last year.\n\nWaddell said with many manufacturing facilities in Kentucky, Nucor is one of the largest electricity consumers in the state.\n\n\"For industrial operations like ours, access to reliable and affordable electricity is one of the most important factors to our success,\" she said.\n\nNucor is investing in next-generation nuclear technology, she said.\n\n\"We're working with NuScale Power, a start-up company that is developing small, modular nuclear reactors. They were the first company to have their new reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,\" she said. \"Besides a financial investment, we're also evaluating with NuScale the possibility to co-locate their small modular reactors at one of our steel mills as well as supplying them with the steel to build the reactor.\"\n\nKim Allen Menke, regional director of Government Affairs for Toyota Motor North America, said severe weather can create a brief power outage that can shut down manufacturing equipment such as spray booths, curing ovens and paint systems.\n\n\"There's no question energy curtailment or brownouts would have a negative impact on our ability to run production and operate our building systems for our team members,\" Menke said.\n\nMichael L. Kurtz, general counsel for Kentucky Industrial Utility Customers, said utility companies in Kentucky are challenging federal rules regarding coal-fired plants.\n\n\"So really, if this federal rule survives, all the coal plants effectively will have to shut down by 2038,\" he said.\n\nSmith said the important issue is what would the closure of the coal-fired plants mean to companies such as Nucor and Toyota.\n\n\"We realize that we're going to have to do something because we want you to know we're going to fight for you, and we're going to fight to keep that industry and those jobs here,\" he said.\n\nCommittee discusses potential bill on sex offender residential limits\n\nRep. Kim Banta, R-Fort Mitchell, testifies before the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday about legislation on sex offender residential limits. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — The 2024 legislative session ended in April, but Kentucky lawmakers are already working on bills for 2025.\n\nRep. Kim Banta, R-Fort Mitchell, spoke to the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary on Thursday about this year's House Bill 67. The bill did not become law, but Banta is hoping to refile the legislation in 2025.\n\nUnder HB 67, registered sex offenders would be restricted from residing within 3,000 feet of a high, middle, or elementary school; preschool, publicly owned or leased playground; or licensed daycare facility. Current law provides a 1,000-foot limit.\n\nBanta said she's had many people ask her for this bill.\n\n\"It's beginning to impact some of our city areas and residents within,\" she added.\n\nSen. Johnnie Turner, R-Harlan, said he is concerned how the bill might impact people living in rural areas.\n\n\"I represent a rural area, and presently 1,000 feet is a football field in a straight line. Three thousand feet would probably prevent anybody from living in any small town in my county,\" Turner said.\n\nThe bill is not retroactive, Banta said, so anyone convicted prior to this bill would not be impacted. Turner said he still has concerns about punishing people who have already served out their sentence.\n\nBanta said that she supports many policies aimed at helping people, like voting rights restoration and expungement, but sex offenders require different consideration.\n\n\"They're always going to be a sexual predator,\" she said.\n\nCommittee co-chair Rep. Daniel Elliott, R-Danville, said he also has concerns on how the legislation would impact rural areas.\n\n\"I know you're trying to prevent future crimes and future victims, and I appreciate what you're doing. But there could be an effect, I think, unintentionally of requiring these individuals to live in rural parts of a county for instance where there's only a sheriff's patrol,\" Elliott said.\n\nSen. Danny Carroll, R-Benton, said from a law enforcement and executive director of a childcare center perspective, he supports the 1,000-foot limit. But he wanted to know why 2,000 more feet is needed.\n\nBanta said she's aware of a situation in which a convicted sex offender uses binoculars to watch children playing soccer at a nearby school.\n\nRep. Kevin D. Bratcher, R-Louisville, said he knows of a similar incident happening in his district. However, that person was convicted when the limit was 500 feet.\n\nThe Kentucky General Assembly cannot act on legislation until the 2025 legislative session begins on Jan. 7.\n\nThe next Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary meeting is scheduled for July 18 at 11 a.m.\n\nFor more information, visit legislature.ky.gov.\n\nDepartment of Juvenile Justice gives update to lawmakers\n\nSen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, said he supports the use of pepper spray and other measures in juvenile detention facilities during Wednesday's Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — The Kentucky General Assembly continued its efforts to monitor Kentucky's juvenile justice system on Wednesday.\n\nKentucky's new Department of Juvenile Justice Commissioner Randy White provided an update to the Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary and spoke on the impacts of recent legislation on the department.\n\nWhite said in his 27 years working in corrections, today's youth are different.\n\n\"They're committing harsher crimes, which require stronger rehabilitative efforts,\" White added.\n\nIn order to reduce Kentucky's juvenile detention center population, White said the state needs to focus on alternatives to detention, education, programming, employment and mental health. Ensuring the safety of incarcerated youth and detention center staff is also a priority.\n\nThe legislature has appropriated millions toward the improvement of the Department of Juvenile Justice in the last few years, White said. Due to 2023 legislation, starting salaries at juvenile justice centers went from $30,000 to $50,000. This has resulted in filled positions going from 313 at the beginning of 2023 to 454 as of May 22, 2024, White added.\n\nEnsuring facilities are fully staffed is a major priority. White said the department is expecting more youth to enter the facilities as the result of 2023's House Bill 3 and 2024's House Bill 5 and Senate Bill 20.\n\nHB 3 requires the automatic detention of juveniles charged with violent crimes. HB 5, also known as the Safer Kentucky Act, enhances penalties for certain violent crimes, and SB 20 requires youth who use a firearm in the commission of a crime to be tried as an adult.\n\nCommittee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, asked if the department has enough funds to complete the Jefferson County Youth Detention Center and the Jefferson Regional Juvenile Detention Facility at Lyndon renovation projects.\n\nRoberta McCann, acting executive director for the department's Office of Administrative Services, said additional funding provided in this year's budget is adequate.\n\nTo maintain order inside the juvenile facilities, corrections officers may use pepper spray, tasers and shields for protection, White said. All usage of pepper spray is investigated. Out of 107 investigations, 14 incidences have been determined to be \"substantiated misuses.\"\n\n\"(Pepper) spray continues to be a safer alternative than physical contact between juveniles and staff, reducing injuries and medical attention,\" White said. \"A comparison of staff assaults before and after the use of pepper spray was authorized shows that staff assaults have decreased by 40%.\"\n\nSen. Robin L. Webb, D-Grayson, said she wanted more information on the use of pepper spray in juvenile facilities, especially if juveniles are informed on what may be used on them if they misbehave.\n\n\"I represent guards and juveniles and I would like to think they're well informed of the potentiality of that,\" Webb said. \"â¦ and what is the penalty for misusing for employees?\"\n\nWhite said he believes potential disciplinary measures for juveniles in detention is in the handbook they're given upon entry to the facility. As for employees who misuse, White said they are often suspended and have to undergo additional training and counseling.\n\nSen. Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, said he supports the use of pepper spray and other measures in juvenile detention facilities due to how violent some of Kentucky's youth offenders are.\n\n\"I find it unfortunate that those who would rather forget that there is a problem that must be dealt with societally, know that the people on the front lines of providing that solution to that problem have to feel safe in that environment that we charge them to operate,\" McDaniel said.\n\nThe next Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice and Judiciary is currently scheduled for 9 a.m. on July 17.

Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, speaks about Kentucky State University during Tuesday's Interim Joint Committee on Education meeting. A high-resolution photo can be found here.\n\nFRANKFORT — During Tuesday's meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education, legislators received an update on budgeting, enrollment and other key issues affecting Kentucky State University in Frankfort.\n\nLawmakers heard testimony from five representatives from the commonwealth's only public historically Black college and university (HBCU).\n\nKSU has faced severe financial challenges in recent years, and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education has undertaken a financial review of the institution. The Kentucky General Assembly also passed legislation to provide financial relief to the university.\n\nTammi Dukes, who serves on the KSU Board of Regents, said she's grateful for the committee and general assembly for the investment in the university, which led to the largest general fund in the school's history.\n\n\"The nearly 400% increase in asset preservation and the $5 million for the planning and design of the new health sciences education building have not gone unnoticed,\" she said. \"In addition, your support, particularly through the passing of House Bill 250 in 2022, has been pivotal in our journey towards realizing measurable outcomes and fostering a brighter future for our students and the commonwealth.\"\n\nDukes said the university's focus has been on three primary goals â to balance the budget, to ensure robust internal controls across the organization and to grow the enrollment.\n\nSen. Shelley Funke Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, asked about the school's outreach to potential students in Northern Kentucky and enrollment numbers.\n\n\"We have hired five admission specialists, and we have divided the state among them. And so we do have a contact there in the Northern Kentucky area. What we're looking to do is to continue to grow,\" said Stephanie Mayberry, KSU's vice provost of student affairs.\n\nMayberry said the university plans to also reach out to potential students in Bowling Green and Christian County.\n\nMentioning the current enrollment of approximately 1,700 at KSU, Funke Frommeyer asked how many students live on campus.\n\nMayberry said the school has the capacity for about 1,200 students on campus. She also said summer school is offered online and several camps are set to kick off this week at KSU.\n\nRep. James Tipton, R-Taylorsville, also committee co-chair, said it's encouraging to hear that good news is happening at KSU, and he asked about the recent relationship between KSU, the KSU Board of Regents and the Kentucky State University Foundation, which he said has been described as \"pretty much nonexistent.\"\n\nDukes said the board of regents has attempted to forge relationships, but has had no real success.\n\n\"In addition, we've also been asking for financial information as it relates to the endowments and all the funds that are being managed through the foundation and have received sporadic, incomplete information over the last two years,\" she said.\n\nTipton said committee members would be monitoring the situation and it can hopefully be resolved soon.\n\nSenate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, asked Michael Dailey, interim provost and vice president of academic affairs, about the record number of degrees awarded during KSU's most recent commencement.\n\n\"We had the largest graduating class that we have had in the history of Kentucky State University â over 300 degrees were awardedâ¦,\" he said.\n\nThomas also asked about graduation rates going up by almost 25% in KSU's new president's first year in office.\n\nDailey said the efforts made by Mayberry and her team started with retention. Also addressing gaps in curriculum and the pathways students were pursuing helped boost the rates.\n\nSen. Stephen Meredith, R-Leitchfield, said the presentation was encouraging, and he asked about student recruitment and the five admissions counselors.\n\n\"I'll be honest. We started behind the eight ball this year. Those five were not in place until January and the recruitment time is September to October,\" Mayberry said. \"We feel confident that we'll be able to get into the high schools. We've been building those relationships all semester so that we can go right into those high schools in the fall so that we have a presence.\"\n\nSenate Democratic Floor Leader Gerald A. Neal, D-Louisville, said after hearing the presentation that he's encouraged by the transparency and the future of the university.\n\n\"I have to tell you this is one of the most refreshing presentations that I've heard before this body. There have been many, but this is one of them. And it's very encouraging what I've heard here,\" he said. \"I think I'm speaking for most of the folks up here, and I haven't looked at facial expressions or anything, but it seems like you're on the right track.\"\n\nLegislative interim period begins this week\n\nRenovation work continues on the Kentucky Capitol this week as lawmakers return to Frankfort for the start of the 2024 interim period. here.\n\nFRANKFORT — Kentucky lawmakers are kicking off the 2024 interim period this week with the first of many joint committees slated to convene on Tuesday.\n\nThe interim period typically runs from June to December each year and provides lawmakers time to hold hearings and study issues in preparation for the next regular session, which begins in January.\n\nThe full 2024 interim calendar is available here.
