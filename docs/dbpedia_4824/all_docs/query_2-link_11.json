        "text": "By Charles Morgan and Hubert Walker for CoinWeek Notes ….\n\nIn the mid-1970s, various patriotic and numismatic items were released as the United States marked the bicentennial of its independence from Great Britain. One of the most significant of these was a new $2 bill: the Series 1976 $2 Federal Reserve Note. Sporting art on the back that appears on the denomination to the present day, the Series 1976 was the first to bear that design and is generally accessible and affordable to paper money collectors.\n\nHistory of the Bicentennial $2 Bill\n\nNumerous numismatic products were issued marking the Bicentennial. A series of medals struck by the United States Mint was released beginning in 1972. In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon signed a bill authorizing commemorative designs on the quarter, the half dollar, and the dollar coin, along with a double date on those denominations struck in 1975 and 1976. And while it is getting harder, Bicentennial coinage can still be found in circulation today.\n\nAnother numismatic item commemorating the Bicentennial (though not as frequently found in circulation), the Series 1976 $2 FRN was approved in late 1975.\n\nOn November 3, 1975, Treasury Secretary William E. Simon announced that, in recognition of the United States Bicentennial, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) would produce $2 Federal Reserve Notes, the first of their kind.\n\nThough the new design for the $2 denomination was inspired by the Bicentennial, the Series 1976 $2 FRN was not a commemorative issue. The New York Times made explicit the connection between the new $2 bills and the Bicentennial in its November 9, 1975 coverage:\n\n“[T]he bill is not a ‘special’ Bicentennial‐year issue; it will continue on as a permanent part of the nation’s circulating paper currency.”\n\nThe new notes were the first FRNs of the denomination; the previous $2 notes (issued in the 1960s) were Legal Tender Notes with a red Treasury Seal and serial numbers. $2 Legal Tender Notes, National Bank Notes, Silver Certificates, Treasury Notes, and Federal Reserve Bank Notes had all been issued since the 1860s.\n\nThe face design remained largely unchanged except for the Treasury Seal and serial numbers, which on the $2 FRN is green.\n\nThe back design changed completely, with President Thomas Jefferson’s mansion Monticello replaced by a depiction of John Trumbull’s painting entitled Declaration of Independence (1817). It was executed for the notes by Peter Cocci, a BEP staffer. The Bicentennial issue was not the first outing of Trumbull’s painting on U.S. paper money, of course; it first appeared on the back of $100 National Bank Notes in 1863, the year after the first federal $2 notes were introduced. The denomination appears as numerals in each corner, with scrolls featuring the written denomination flanking the bottom two numbers; the written denomination also appears vertically on either side of the Trumbull vignette.\n\nTrumbull’s painting also appeared on one of the series of commemorative stamps issued for the Bicentennial, split into four sections.\n\nBy the end of the note’s production run in 1978, the BEP had printed 590,720,000 Series 1976 Bicentennial $2 bills. The front of each one bears the signatures of Treasury Secretary Simon and Treasurer of the United States Francine Irving Neff.\n\nThe scarcest Star note for the series is the Friedberg 1935-J* (F-1935-J*). The issue’s Minneapolis Star notes are comparably rare.\n\nThe notes were released on April 13, 1976, Thomas Jefferson’s birthday.\n\nCollectability of the Series 1976 $2 Note\n\nSome observers were hopeful that the $2 denomination would be accepted in commerce, possibly reducing demand for $1 FRNs. An April 11, 1976, New York Times article claimed that:\n\n“The new $2 note is expected to replace about one‐half of the $1 bills in circulation over the next several years. This will result in an estimated saving of $4 million to $7 million per year in printing costs.”\n\nNevertheless, the notes did not circulate widely, whatever the hopes of their proponents. The denomination is so uncommon in some areas that people have been arrested for trying to spend $2 notes at retail establishments. Yet most Series 1976 $2 bills are abundant and affordable.\n\nAn interesting notaphilic and philatelic collectible involves the Series 1976 $2 Federal Reserve Note release. Many people took the bills to post offices on the release day, affixed stamps directly to the notes, and had the stamps canceled at their local post office. Numerous commemorative stamps were issued marking the Bicentennial, which made for thematically fitting note-stamp pairings. The stamped notes are not worth much beyond face value, but a collector might seek out a note from their hometown or another location of personal significance.\n\nArt Friedberg, the co-author of Paper Money of the United States (22nd Ed., 2021), shares that the stamped Series 1976 $2 FRN sold briskly around the time of the American Bicentennial.\n\n“It was different, it was collectible, people loved it. We made a lot of money,” Friedberg explained in a phone interview.\n\nRobert Azpiazu, owner of First City Coins and Collectibles and author of Collector’s Guide to Modern Federal Reserve Notes: Series 1963-2009 (2011), elaborates on the stamped notes’ appeal in an email interview:\n\n“There are some cancellations that are very valuable but only to a small group of eclectic collectors.”\n\nSeries 1976 Bicentennial $2 bills appear in several U.S. Mint products, including the 1994 Thomas Jefferson 250th Anniversary Coinage and Currency Set, notable for its Satin Finish Jefferson Nickel.\n\nAs of July 10, 2024, Paper Money Guaranty (PMG) reports 18,830 total grading events for Series 1976 Bicentennial $2 bills from all 12 Federal Reserve banks; 6,040 of those are Star notes.\n\nCirculated examples of Series 1976 $2 FRNs can be bought for around face value or occasionally found in circulation. Uncirculated examples can bring a dollar or two over face.\n\nRarer Star notes naturally command higher premiums, as do notes at the highest end of the condition scale or those with collectable serial numbers. F-1935-L with serial number 1 sold with its brick label in a Heritage auction on January 8, 2016, for $21,150.\n\nIssued in massive numbers with a design commemorating the U.S. Bicentennial, Series 1976 $2 Federal Reserve Notes are affordable and abundant, notable as the first $2 FRNs and for the numerous stamped specimens available for a little over their face value.\n\n* * *\n\nMarket Data and Noteworthy Specimens\n\nPCGS Currency Perfect New 70 PPQ #80397700: Heritage, April 26, 2013, Lot 16269 – $2,820.
