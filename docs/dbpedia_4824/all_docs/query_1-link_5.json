        "text": "By the late 19th Century, many of the world’s major currencies were fixed to gold at a set price per ounce, under the ‘Gold Standard’ and this persisted in different forms for about one hundred years.\n\nTo aid further research by scholars, journalists and all those interested in gold’s monetary role, the World Gold Council commissioned a compilation of extracts from key historical documents from 1660 to 1999.\n\nCitations are provided for every source so as to facilitate the reader's further research. These documents are therefore a valuable resource for researchers who seek even more in-depth knowledge of the history of money and gold."
