        "text": "Why Wes: Wesleyan’s tight-knit, collaborative learning environment is perfect for people like me, who want to be able to take advantage of all of Wesleyan’s plentiful opportunities without getting lost in the crowd. Wesleyan also offers numerous unique opportunities for FGLI students which helped me gain the confidence necessary for navigating college and academia as a whole. Lastly, the breadth of ideas and passions between all Wesleyan students helped assure me that attending a college close to my hometown did not mean that I would not be able to challenge my existing identity and develop as a person.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: Although I grew up only around 25 minutes away from campus, I never thought of myself at Wesleyan until I visited as an admitted student. My experiences during WesFest and my tour truly opened my eyes to Wesleyan’s vibrant community and limitless opportunities. I love being able to share my own experiences at Wes and all its quirks that I’ve grown to adore. Additionally, I want to ease the stress of my fellow FGLI students by sharing all the ways in which Wesleyan can support them throughout their journey.\n\nExtracurriculars: ADLit Staff Writer, Upward Bound Tutor, Swim Lesson Instructor, Lifeguard, WesMaSS Social Committee Member\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Seeing everyone excited about the first snow despite finals week being right around the corner.\n\nFavorite Movie: Barbie & the Diamond Castle\n\nFavorite Song: There Is a Light That Never Goes Out by The Smiths\n\nFun Fact: I met my first friend by chasing her around a playground at daycare.\n\nWhy Wes: After attending a very small school for High School I knew I wanted to find a place where the student body felt engaged and connected with one another. College felt so daunting as someone who hadn’t been in a grade larger than 40, however, after touring Wesleyan I immediately felt a sense of comfort and warmth. I could really sense how strong and meaningful the bonds amongst the community were. Aspects such as required housing all 4 years and the countless clubs and organizations proved to me just how interwoven everyone truly is on this campus.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I was really impacted by the tour I took of Wesleyan my senior year and I hope to also provide prospective students and families with a memorable experience that they too feel impacted by.\n\nExtracurriculars: Spectrum Board Member\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Common Moment during freshman orientation\n\nFavorite Movie: Dazed and Confused\n\nFavorite Song: Certainty - Big Thief\n\nFun Fact: Over the summer I camped out for 7 hours to see Phoebe Bridgers (Twice in a row!)\n\nWhy Wes? Before coming here, I was really intrigued by the “Keep Wes Weird” motto. After I while I realized that a place which can accept weirdness, that being something that is not the regular consensus, is exactly what I and people need since no one should be satisfied by the status quo and aspire for something different, weird, better.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I hope people to have the great Wes experience I currently am having.\n\nExtracurriculars: Staff writer at the Argus, club soccer and intramural soccer and basketball\n\nFavorite Movie: Metropolitan by Whit Stillman\n\nFavorite Song: Ease Yourself and Glide - Parsley Sound\n\nFun Fact: I can speak three languages\n\nWhy Wes: I love how curious the student body is. I was drawn to how friends talked about what they were learning in class, a cool article they read, or just about an idea that fascinated them. The open curriculum creates classes filled with students who are truly interested in the subject matter and feel excited to learn. It’s incredibly empowering to be in this environment and it pushes me to ask the harder questions and think more critically.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love showing off how awesome Wesleyan is and all the things I love about it!\n\nExtracurriculars: Club soccer, ultimate frisbee, intramural softball, outing club, tutoring\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes: The first day back from winter break last year there was a big snow storm and everyone went straight to Foss to sledding, ski, and have snowball fights.\n\nFavorite Movie: The Silence of the Lambs\n\nFavorite Song: Romeo and Juliet by Dire Straits\n\nFun Fact: I took a gap year, took a one-way flight to Africa on my own, and lived there for half a year!\n\nWhy Wes: I love being in spaces with quirky, creative people who challenge me to expand my worldview. At Wes, I am not only able to pursue my educational passions but flourish in all aspects of life, thanks to the wonderful community around me.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I chose Wesleyan because of a tour. I want to pass the favor along by helping students realize what they are looking for in the next phase of life.\n\nExtracurriculars: Wesleyan Doula Project, Disorientation, United Student/Labor Action Coalition (USLAC)\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Staying up late with friends to chat and eat homemade cookie dough\n\nFavorite Movie: The Lord of the Rings\n\nFavorite Song: 1950 by King Princess\n\nFun Fact: I gave a TEDx Talk on trans and intersex advocacy and feminism.\n\nWhy Wes: I wanted to study at a university where I could explore my creative and academic interests. I chose Wes because I loved the open curriculum and being able to select a wide variety of classes. I love how curious, friendly, and passionate everyone here is.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I still remember my tour guide when I first visited Wesleyan. She was so kind and honest about her experience here. She made me feel excited to attend the school and I could envision myself at Wes. I hope to make a similar impact on prospective students so that they feel at home at Wes.\n\nExtracurriculars: Table Tennis Club, The Lavender (literary magazine), the Women of Color Collective, and the Reason and Decision Making Lab.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Sitting on Foss Hill with my friends on a picnic blanket chatting, playing cards, and drinking smoothies.\n\nFavorite Movie: The Book Thief\n\nFavorite Song: Paradise by Khalid\n\nFun Fact: My full name has the beginning, the middle, and the end of the alphabet.\n\nWhy Wes: When looking at colleges, I could tell that any one of the places I’d be lucky enough to be accepted to had a rigorous and diverse academic program, tons of extracurricular activities, and wonderful facilities. But at Wes, I found interdisciplinary academic paths I didn’t see elsewhere and felt that I could pursue even my most disparate of interests simultaneously. I immediately felt a sense of belonging, of warmth, and of drive from Wes students all wanting to make a palpable impact on the world. I feel that every day I’m here—both in and out of the classroom, with both friends and professors—and I know I am growing into a better version of myself and finding my passions, my voice, and maybe even my purpose.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I think that the tour is one of the most important aspects of the college application process, the time when students and families are able to get a true feel for a campus. I love being part of it—sharing personal anecdotes, connecting and conversing with people from around the country and the world. I hope that prospective students make informed decisions about this chapter of their lives, and I love sharing why Wes and its community were (and will always be) the place for me!\n\nExtracurriculars: Captain of Wesleyan Women's Rugby Team, Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC), Wesleyan Jewish Community (WJC), Student Board Member for Chabad at Wesleyan, Intramural Softball\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Picnicking on Andrus Field with friends on a warm fall day :)\n\nFavorite Movie: Brokeback Mountain\n\nFavorite Song: Best Thing I Never Had — Beyoncé\n\nFun Fact: I've watched open heart surgery from inside the OR\n\nWhy Wes: I wasn't sure what to study when I applied to colleges. I enjoyed all subjects and leaned towards the sciences and engineering. I applied to various schools, including engineering schools, liberal arts colleges, and those with open curricula. I chose Wesleyan for its flexibility, allowing me to explore and discover my interests. I love the small classes and the unique people I've met here, greatly enriching my learning experience. Touring the campus also made me fall in love with Wesleyan. I'm confident that Wesleyan has and will provide me with a great college experience.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I enjoy sharing my experiences and helping people make important decisions, like choosing a college. The tour is one of the most crucial aspects of the college application process, where students and families can truly get a feel for a campus. Being part of that process is fulfilling—I connect with people from around the country and the world, share personal anecdotes, and provide insights into our community. I hope prospective students make informed decisions about this chapter of their lives, and I love sharing why Wesleyan and its community were (and will always be) the place for me!\n\nExtracurriculars: Wesleyan Investment Group, Shakti (South Asian Group), Wesleyan Entrepreneurs, Athletics Department\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Any event on Foss Hill: Sledding and Snowball fights, Solar Eclipse or Orientation Movie Night\n\nFavorite Movie: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\n\nFun Fact: I'm a British, Canadian, and Indian enthusiast who roots for the Pittsburgh Steelers in American football, Manchester United in soccer, and cheers on India in cricket. But I'm a Portugal soccer fan!\n\nWhy Wes: The reason I chose Wesleyan to spend my undergraduate years is actually because of a mutual friend. I met him and thought he was incredible. He would not stop talking about how much he loved his school and whilst in the trenches of my applications I was extremely curious as to where he attended. That was the first time I had ever registered Wesleyan as a possibility, after that I started doing my own research. I wasn’t able to do any in-person tours and so finding other avenues for research was integral to making the decision. I was able to speak with a few others about their experience at Wesleyan and I noticed how genuine everyone seemed in their responses. It never felt like they were trying to sell me on the school, but rather inform me of the benefits as well as the realistic preferences. I think a special thing about Wesleyan is that they value the students’ desire and choice to be at the school in a linear way to their acceptance at the school. That in conjunction with the diverse, oddly specific, class options taught by engaging and empathetic professors had me convinced that I belonged at Wesleyan.\n\nExtracurriculars: Working at Pi and as a Writing mentor for CPE, on the board for Spectrum, a participant in latin and Hip hop dance, and I have a radio show.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): My first dance performance was one of the best experiences I have had on this campus. The ability to have started something for the first time ever on campus and have it come to fruition was rewarding.\n\nFavorite Movie: Totoro\n\nFavorite Song: My current favorite artist is Jessie Reyez and I love her song Sola\n\nFun Fact: A fun fact about me is that I was on an episode of a Dog series with my dogs in Miami called Dogs 101\n\nWhy Wes: Growing up, I knew I didn't want to go to a large state school. When I was accepted to the QuestBridge program as a Finalist, I made a March Madness-style bracket of all of the partner schools and spent a few weeks learning everything about those schools and comparing them head to head. When the dust settled, Wesleyan was on top and I could not be happier with my decision!\n\nExtracurriculars: RA for 2 years, Lab Coordinator in the Earth Systems Studio Lab, QuestBridge, while at Wes I also published a paper!\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes so far: Graduation!\n\nFavorite Movie: Barbie or The Muppets (2011)\n\nFavorite Song: Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl or Espresso\n\nFun Fact: I drive a pink Chevy Spark named Chappell (after Chappell Roan)\n\nWhy Wes? The people here are unparalleled. Very few schools have students who show up for each other like they do at Wes — we regularly overflow bleachers and sell out performances. It also inspires me how incredibly smart, creative, and successful everyone is in their unique endeavors. Wesleyan has been a great environment to grow in.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love interacting with prospective students from all over the world, and sharing how my time at Wesleyan has shaped who I am. I aim to really connect with the people on my tours, and enjoy that I am effectively getting paid to talk to people!\n\nExtracurriculars: Student Health Advisory Committee (SHAC), Triple Major A Capella, and Spare Change the Band.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Performing in the WestCo Cafe with my band for the first time.\n\nFavorite Movie: Captain Fantastic\n\nFavorite Song: Like Real People Do by Hozier\n\nFun Fact: One of my life goals is to publish a recipe book!\n\nWhy Wes? What originally attracted me to Wesleyan was the mock trial team, knowing Wes' program could support me in my passion for courtroom advocacy. Other reasons for choosing Wes were to be near my sisters, who both moved back east for college, to receive a well-rounded education, meet open-minded people, and live a well-balanced life surrounded by diverse peers.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love being a tour guide because I love Wes, having made my best friends and memories here. I am so lucky to share my experience with prospective students and family.\n\nExtracurriculars: Captain of cheer and mock trial team, member of the Wesleyan defense panel.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Leading my mock trial team to the Opening Round Championship Series of Collegiate Mock Trial.\n\nFavorite Movie: The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\nFavorite Song: Pyramids by Frank Ocean.\n\nFun Fact: I speak French and instruct Windsurfing.\n\nWhy Wes? Who knew that a random afternoon drive to a University an hour away would change my life? Call it intuition, but the minute I sat down on the benches outside of Usdan, I knew I wanted to call Wesleyan home. I wanted somewhere that was academically driven with a passionate student body, but able to let loose and have fun. Additionally, I was looking for a school that provided diversity in all kinds of ways, and Wesleyan pulled through. I wanted to enjoy my classes and not feel forced to be in a classroom knowing I wouldn’t enjoy it, so the Open Curriculum is definitely a benefit. Students here are able to explore academically, allowing them to pursue things they might never have thought of!\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: To express my love for Wesleyan, and give back what it has given me. I never got to tour, but I knew the energy I was looking for when in the college process, and hopefully that is something I can pass down to others!\n\nExtracurriculars: I am a part of Gag Reflex, Wesleyan’s oldest improv group, as well as Lunchbox sketch comedy and POC Comedy. I am also a part of the Women of Color Collective, have attended bi-weekly BIPOC Connection meetings at the Resource Center, and have engaged with Ujamaa (Wesleyan’s Black Student Union) events. You can spot me in a dance performance every now and then too, and maybe even in the cardinal costume.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Seeing everyone lounge on Foss Hill when the weather gets warm! That’s how you know it’s spring.\n\nFavorite Movie: Coraline\n\nFavorite Song: Hold On, by The Internet\n\nFun Fact: In high school, I was known for always wearing mismatched Vans, which ended up being my grad cap decoration.\n\nWhy Wes: I always loved all subjects and areas of study and wanted to go to a school that encouraged academic exploration. Coming into college, I had no idea what I wanted to study so I wanted an open curriculum. Here I was able to take classes from all disciplines, starting as a government major and ending up as a computer science major. I also chose Wes because of the people. The people at Wesleyan are passionate, smart, and creative. Students will talk about their favorite class, political theory, or indie films for hours. Students are celebrated for being different and, as a result, we are able to learn from each other.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love meeting and talking with prospective students and their families. The tour helps to humanize the college process and, for me, it was a huge part of my decision process. I enjoy making meaningful connections to help students learn about Wes.\n\nExtracurriculars: Wesleyan Mock Trial Team, WesBurlesque, Course Assistant/Peer Tutor\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Competing with the mock trial team at our regional tournament and spending the weekend in our team member's home!\n\nFavorite Movie: Guardians of the Galaxy\n\nFavorite Song: China Cat Sunflower\n\nFun Fact: I rewatched all the Marvel movies in chronological order over a span of five days.\n\nWhy Wes: I first toured Wesleyan in the seventh grade, when my sister was touring schools. I distinctly remember walking past the fishbowl in Exley and saying to myself that Wesleyan was the school for me. Fast forward to my senior year, and I'm sitting in my room, proud of myself for having finished all of my applications. My mom walked in and asked if I had done my Wesleyan application. I hadn't even added it to my list. Thankfully there were no supplements and I threw it on at the last minute. Now we're in April and I am doing a final tour of my last three schools, trying to decide. After my day at WesFest, I knew that Wesleyan was the school for me. I've loved my classes, my friends, and am so thankful for the life I am building here, and for the life that Wesleyan will help me build after I graduate.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love to talk and get to know new people, so naturally I found a job where I could get paid for that. Although I haven't finished my freshman year yet, I'm so excited to have the opportunity to share my love for Wesleyan.\n\nExtracurriculars: I am a member of the Wesleyan Spirits, Wesleyan's lower voice (TTBB) acapella group\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Sledding with my friends on Foss (getting back up the hill was not as fun)\n\nFavorite Movie: 10 Things I Hate About You\n\nFavorite Song: Ribs - Lorde\n\nFun Fact: Since 2019, I've spent more time away from home than I have at home.\n\nWhy Wes: When I started the college process, I didn’t really know what I was looking for, except for a small-ish school and no math requirements. Wesleyan’s open curriculum has given me everything I didn’t even know I wanted in academics. I’ve been able to explore all the arts, humanities, and social sciences without restriction, and it led me to finding passion in unexpected places. What really got me to Wesleyan, though, was the people. I visited multiple times throughout my senior year of high school, and I just wanted to keep coming back. Through tours, WesFest, and shadowing-a-student days, I could see a life here for myself, and that was a feeling I can’t really describe. Wes just felt like the right place to be.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love everything about our Office of Admissions, and tour guiding specifically gives me the most opportunity to interact with prospective students, share my experiences, and give them a sense of how Wesleyan has shaped me personally, academically, and socially. I want to give whatever I have to offer to help someone else find their place of home and growth at Wes!\n\nExtracurriculars: Spike Tape Productions, Cardinal Sinners (a cappella), Writing Center Position\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): I genuinely can’t pick one, but I love the movie nights I have pretty regularly with my closest friends on the projector in mine and my roommate’s dorm.\n\nFavorite Movie: I’m notoriously bad at picking favorites, but as of June 2024, my Letterboxd profile says La La Land, Parasite, Little Women, and The Empire Strikes Back! (And I have many others high on my list.)\n\nFavorite Song: I still can’t pick favorite songs or artists, but I love listening to anything by Laufey.\n\nFun Fact: I started crocheting in January 2023 and have yarn everywhere you look in my room (and in my backpack). That August, I made a blanket with four cakes of blanket yarn in one day.\n\nWhy Wes: I went to a really small high school so I was looking for somewhere that had a smaller class size so I would be able to forge relationships and connections with my professors like I was able to at my highschool. Wesleyan’s open curriculum also drew my attention because it allowed for me to take classes that interest me. I also really appreciated the beauty of Wesleyan’s campus because a campus environment was something important to me when looking at places.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I’ve loved going to Wesleyan and I really like having the opportunity to speak to others about my experiences so far in hopes of them sharing the same love I feel towards Wesleyan.\n\nExtracurriculars: Music, ASL, and (hopefully) getting involved in Wesleyan’s Radio Show\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Going to my friends’ different band performances!\n\nFavorite Movie: Ready or Not\n\nFavorite Song: Doomsday by Lizzy McAlpine\n\nFun Fact: Every summer I make short films, and one of the ones I worked on was accepted into the Annapolis Film Festival.\n\nWhy Wes: During my college search I had a pretty specific set of criteria. I wanted a small college/university where I didn't just feel like a number, a good film program to nurture my hobby, and opportunities to try new things and explore. Wesleyan simply checked all of those boxes. But even more than that, I was struck by the collaborative culture and friendly demeanor that I encountered at every turn. After my Dad and I visited various colleges around the northeast and the rest of the country during my Junior Spring, we ranked each on a 1-10 scale in a plethora of categories, including campus attractiveness, curriculum, size, culture. etc. I ranked Wesleyan highest in just about every category. It was clear there was no other place for me than Wes, and I applied Early Decision early in my Senior Fall. Somehow, Wesleyan exceeded my expectations and I developed new passions in addition to fostering my old ones. Due to the open curriculum, I'm now majoring in two departments that I had almost no experience with prior to my arrival at Wes.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love showing people around my school! I remember when I toured Wes as a prospective student with an enthusiastic, engaged guide. It made a huge difference for me in my college search and I love that I can now give back and show new prospective students why I love Wes.\n\nExtracurriculars: Ultimate Frisbee (I play for both the all-gender team and the men's team), Survivor: Wesleyan (our Wes version of CBS's reality show Survivor)\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): I loved teaching a student forum to my fellow Wes students called The Social Psychology of Survivor. Seeing the students compete in challenges and endure tribal councils while learning all about the psychology underlying their actions was pretty magical.\n\nFavorite Movie: The Truman Show\n\nFavorite Song: Blu (Acoustic) by Jon Bellion\n\nFun Fact: I have been to 49 of the 50 U.S. states. Hawaii still eludes me.\n\nWhy Wes? Throughout high school I participated and competed in many different STEM focus groups like Advanced Mathematics, Calculator, Accounting, Agricultural Sciences but was also very active in different areas such as Art, Music Theory and Sculpting. When I became a Questbridge National College match finalist and was in the process of ranking schools, Wesleyan’s open curriculum and late declaration was a huge huge pull factor because I am INCREDIBLY indecisive. I really looked forward for the opportunity of dipping my toes into different classes and branches knowing I wouldn’t have to fully commit until the spring of sophomore year!\n\nExtracurriculars: Coordinator for the Foster Connection, American Sign Language TA, ASHA (adolescent sexual health awareness)\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): My sophomore year I had the privilege to live in the Womanist Program house where I met and created some amazing friendships and connections. As a house, we were able to host events open to the Wes community as well as just private housemate events, and these were always some of the loveliest moments where we were just able to bond! As an example we had a movie night, s’mores bonfire, and a Super Bowl Screening night (mainly to watch Rihanna’s halftime performance\n\nFavorite Movie: Lilo and Stitch/ Pitch Perfect\n\nFavorite Song: Where She Goes-Bad Bunny/ My Stupid Heart-Walk off the Earth/ When it Rains it Pours- Luke Combs\n\nFun Fact: I don’t have a favorite anything! So choosing answers for these couple of questions was TOUGH…which is why there are multiple answers!\n\nWhy Wes? I chose Wes because the open curriculum allowed me to explore my various academic interests. I loved being able to take whatever classes I wanted and not being restricted to a singular career path. Unsurprisingly my inability to choose just one subject to focus on led me to majoring in College of Letters, which allows me to put my variety of interests into conversation with one another, creating all kinds of learning I never thought possible. Finally the open curriculum at Wes means that everyone is in the classes they are in because they chose to; everyone wants to be there and is excited and passionate about learning. At Wes I found that I am constantly learning and surrounded by supportive, brilliant teachers and peers.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: Applying for university was one of the most exhausting, stressful times of my life, but it also resulted in me finding my community and a space to embrace who I am and branch out of who I was. I love being able to share my experiences at Wesleyan and hopefully being able to help to make others’ application and decision processes a little bit easier.\n\nExtracurriculars: Tutor and Mentor at the Wesleyan Writing Center, member of the Women’s Club Rugby Team, Director for SpikeTape (student run theater).\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Putting on an early 2000s Romcom version of Much Ado About Nothing!\n\nFavorite Movie: Kenneth Branaugh’s Much Ado About Nothing\n\nFavorite Song: Figure You Out by Voilà\n\nFun Fact: I once had to get surgery to remove an embroidery needle from my foot after stepping on it and causing it to break inside my foot.\n\nWhy Wes? For me, there were two important factors for my college selection process: academics and community. For academics, my high school had a pretty competitive environment when it came to academics and I knew that that wasn’t the environment in which I learned best. Wesleyan was such a big change in that regard since everyone is so supportive and collaborative when it comes to schoolwork and studying for exams. For community, I was blown away by the number of extracurriculars that were available at Wesleyan and the wide range of classes and student groups that people were involved in, and that made me really excited to come and get involved with as many as I could.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: Being on a tour was when I realized Wesleyan was my dream school and I really hope I’ll be part of that moment for others.\n\nExtracurriculars: I’m a coordinator for the Eco-Facilitator program in the Sustainability Office (a three-semester program to work on sustainability initiatives on campus), a paleobotany lab member, I do work for Wild Wes (an on-campus permaculture garden), and I’m a member of botany club and ecology club.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Definitely the silent disco. On the last night of my orientation, before all the other students moved in, we had a silent disco in the middle of Olin Library where we all had headphones with music and could change between stations to dance to what we wanted to. It felt like a perfect end to orientation and was a really memorable experience with my friends.\n\nFavorite Movie: Mamma Mia!\n\nFavorite Song: Changes constantly, but I’ve been listening to a lot of Kali Uchis recently\n\nFun Fact: I taught myself how to play the ukulele!\n\nWhy Wes? I chose Wes because I loved how there was a great balance between athletics and academics. I also love how I can form a really meaningful relationship with my professors and TAs due to the small class sizes. I enjoy being able to explore new academic interests with the open curriculum and I'm able to discover new hobbies through the countless extracurricular activities.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love being a tour guide because I get to meet and chat with new people!\n\nExtracurriculars: Varsity swim team, book club, Shakti, POC Swim Committee,\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Hanging out with my friends on Foss Hill and having a cute study picnic in the nice fall weather overlooking campus!\n\nFavorite Movie: Dirty Dancing\n\nFavorite Song: Who Says by Selena Gomez\n\nFun Fact: I can speak 4 languages!\n\nWhy Wes: When looking at colleges, not many schools offered a high-level dance program while being academically rigorous. Many were one or the other, or only allowed me to dance but not take academic classes. I saw at Wes that there would be no problem taking both dance and academic classes. I also discovered that I have many different academic interests and although I have these contrasting passions, I saw that Wes gave me an opportunity to explore them all without restraint and allowed me to dive deep into any subject I find interesting while also shaping my education in the way I best see fit.\n\nExtracurriculars: Member of club rugby\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Silent disco during orientation was a blast. I loved meeting new friends and having a dance party in our fancy library.\n\nFavorite Movie: Ferris Bueller's Day Off\n\nFavorite Song: Neon (Live at the Nokia Theatre, Los Angeles - 2007) by John Mayer\n\nFun Fact: I ate a whole pizza in 20 minutes.\n\nWhy Wes? I knew I wanted to have great personal connections with my professors, engaging classes, and lots of performance opportunities in college. Wes turned out to give those and so many more opportunities.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love meeting people from around the world and sharing all the great things I've experienced so far!\n\nExtracurriculars: Tour Guide Coordinator, drummer for several bands and original musicals, homework helper and music teacher for immigrant and refugee kids in New Haven, intramural softball.\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Questioning almost everything I thought I believed in my politics class. Or playing in an opening band for Sammy Rae & The Friends. Or watching a disgusting but fascinating movie as part of the Wes Film Series with friends. The list goes on.\n\nFavorite Movie: Mean Girls\n\nFavorite Song: \"The Climb\" by Miley Cyrus\n\nFun Fact: I play 7 instruments.\n\nWhy Wes: The emphasis on student activism as well as support from the community on student developed projects dedicated to mental health, reproductive rights, LGBTIA+ rights. Additionally, Wes has a tight knit community that tries to make sure that there is a safe space for each and every identity.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I want to be a part of sharing my experience at Wes so that prospective students can see how accepting and welcoming this community is! Furthermore, I want to relate to other prospective students and show them our beautiful campus!\n\nExtracurriculars: WesCF (Wesleyan Christian Fellowship) leader, boxing club, Argus Assistant Sports Editor, Spike Tape, Slender James and Slavei Acapella groups\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Drag Queen Bingo!\n\nFavorite Movie: Karate Kid (1984)\n\nFavorite Song: \"Fear is Not My Future\" by Maverick City\n\nFun Fact: I have the same birthday as John Cena!\n\nWhy Wes: Simple, the Open Curriculum. While it is one of the defining characteristics of Wesleyan it creates so much more than flexibility in class selection. It allows me the opportunity to surround myself with like-minded multi-passioned people. Through the curriculum, I am encouraged to bridge and explore my academic passions while also being allotted the opportunity to try a variety of classes I am interested in. The creative and collaborative culture at Wes finds its way into every classroom no matter the subject. The open curriculum speaks to the overall culture and drive of the students here at Wes and I wanted to be surrounded by truly passion-driven peers.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love getting to share my Wes experience and the reason why I fell in love with the school while also connecting with prospective students and hearing about their interests.\n\nExtracurriculars: ASHA (Adolescent Sexual Health Awareness), Spike Tape Theatre, Usdan Information Desk, Outing Club\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Every semester I am required to work two late-night shifts at one of my job here at Wes. Both times my friends have shown up to sit with me, bringing snacks and making the time fly by. The community at Wesleyan is truly special.\n\nFavorite Movie: The Princess Bride\n\nFavorite Song: Smoke Signals - Pheobe Bridgers\n\nFun Fact: I love to crochet!\n\nWhy Wes? I wanted to experience an education where I could pursue my interests while still exploring many different subjects. With these factors in mind as well as financial aid, Wesleyan was the exact place for me. Since I began my freshman year, I have been deeply involved on campus in ways that I will carry over into my life after college. From collaboration in my classes, clubs, sports, and work, I truly feel like I am part of something bigger.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I love being a tour guide because I play an important role in prospective students deciding if Wesleyan is a place they can call home.\n\nExtracurriculars: Residential Advisor, Men’s Crew Team, Argus Copy Editor, Slavei A Capella, WesInterpreters, Intercut\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): WesDay, Residential Advisor training, Slavei concert\n\nFavorite Movie: Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios, Sunset Boulevard\n\nFavorite Song: Aute Cuture- Rosalía, Los Tontos- C. Tangana, Kiko Veneno\n\nFun Fact: My favorite place to be on campus is Exley Science Center even though I am in no way a STEM person.\n\nWhy Wes: By the time I applied to college I’d already seen both of my two older sisters go through the process: one ended up as a D1 athlete at a big UC, the other at a small liberal arts college in southern California. Their experiences made me sure of two things, 1. I wanted the best of both worlds (shoutout to Hannah Montannah) and 2. I had to leave California. Wesleyan did, and has continued, to fulfill those conditions fabulously.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: Beyond the website, I had no idea what Wesleyan had to offer when I applied from my covid-quarantine-bedroom… (not so shockingly) actually arriving on campus made me realize just how much I really love being here and I love having a designated outlet to share my excitement with others!\n\nExtracurriculars: Spirituality & Sustainability Intern at the Resource Center, Varsity Swim & Dive Team, Club Waterpolo, Residential Advisor, WesUSE Bargaining Committee, Wesleyan Jewish Community, Outing Club\n\nFavorite Moment at Wes (so far): Becoming friends with one of my now best friends by passing notes back and forth every class in our first year seminar (FYS) “Being Young and Jewish in America”\n\nFavorite Movie: Love Actually\n\nFavorite Song: Dancing in the Moonlight\n\nFun Fact: I can teach any able-bodied person how to do a cartwheel\n\nWhy Wes? I chose Wesleyan so that I could dedicate myself to competitive athletics while also taking a rigorous course load that would challenge me academically. Wesleyan’s passionate student body fosters a hard-working environment in which I could push myself to step out of my comfort zone and reach my potential.\n\nWhy I love being a tour guide: I greatly enjoy sharing my experience as a student-athlete at Wes. I believe that the insights I provide to prospective students would have been very helpful to know during my own college search.\n\nExtracurriculars: Varsity Athlete on Cross Country and Track & Field, Legal Intern in Middletown, Emergency Medical Technician\n\nFavorite Movie: Ferris Bueller’s Day Off\n\nFavorite Song: 7 Hours by Dominic Fike"
