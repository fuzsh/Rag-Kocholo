        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- The much-anticipated Bob Dylan biopic \"A Complete Unknown\" has a release date: Christmas Day, December 25, right in the midst of the awards consideration window. The first look at Timothée Chalamet as the folk artist dropped a couple of weeks ago.\n\nSet in the early '60s, the film follows 19-year-old Bob Dylan from his humble beginnings as a folk singer in Minnesota, to his rise to fame in the New York music scene, culminating with his 1965 performance at Newport Folk Festival.\n\nAs he walks through the streets of New York City, Dylan passes Hotel Chelsea and Cafe Wha?, a couple of his frequented hangouts, before taking the stage with a performance of \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall.\"\n\nThe Searchlight Pictures film also stars Edward Norton, Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro, Boyd Holbrook, Norbert Leo Butz, Dan Fogler and Scoot McNairy.\n\nAs a director, James Mangold has received positive critical reception for the Johnny Cash biopic, \"Walk The Line\" and Marvel's \"Logan.\"\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is the parent company of Searchlight Pictures and this ABC station."
