        "text": "The creators of Will & Grace and Ryan Murphy are teaming for a Hulu project — which is already attracting a top-flight cast.\n\nThe Disney-owned streamer has ordered a pilot for a multi-camera comedy titled Mid-Century Modern, written by Will & Grace’s David Kohan and Max Mutchnick. Matt Bomer, Nathan Lane and Linda Lavin are set to star in the show, which reads as something of a gender-swapped take on The Golden Girls. Murphy is an executive producer, and James Burrows is set to direct.\n\nThe logline: “The series follows three best friends — gay gentlemen of a certain age — who, after an unexpected death, decide to spend their golden years living together in Palm Springs where the wealthiest one lives with his mother and a naked Gen Z housekeeper. As a chosen family, they prove that no matter how hard things get, there’s always someone around to remind you it would be better if you got your neck done.”\n\nLane will play the aforementioned wealthiest of the friends, a successful businessman named Bunny Schneiderman who’s forever in search of love but needs to be convinced he’s worthy of it. Lavin will play his mom, Sybil, who’s wise and caring but also critical and smothering. Bomer’s character, Jerry Frank, is described is described as “pure of heart, hard of body and soft of head.” The third friend (and the naked housekeeper) have yet to be cast.\n\nBomer, who’s coming off Showtime’s Emmy hopeful Fellow Travelers, had a recurring part on the Will & Grace revival at NBC several years ago. He’s also worked with Murphy on American Horror Story and The Normal Heart.\n\nLane is set to play Dominick Dunne in the next season of Murphy’s Netflix anthology Monster, which will focus on the Menendez brothers case. He has been nominated for a guest acting Emmy each of the past two years for Hulu’s Only Murders in the Building. Lavin’s recent credits include CBS’ Elsbeth and B Positive.\n\n20th Television is producing Mid-Century Modern. Murphy, Kohan, Mutchnick, Lane, Bomer and Burrows will all serve as executive producers.\n\nBomer is repped by CAA, Anonymous Content, Viewpoint, and Hansen Jacobson. Lane is with CAA and Anonymous Content. Lavin is repped by Innovative and Sendoff & Baruch. Burrows is repped by WME, Bob Broder, and Hansen Jacobson.\n\nVariety first reported the news."
