        "text": "Gareth Roderick hit an unbeaten 152 and teenager Jack Home took six wickets as Worcestershire beat Derbyshire to go top of Group A in the One-Day Cup.\n\nHome, 18, claimed 6-51 at Derby as the home side were bowled out for 260 and the Pears reached 261-2 with 32 balls to spare as Roderick struck a six and 22 fours.\n\nGlamorgan and Warwickshire continue to set the pace in Group B as they made it four wins out of four by beating winless Sussex and Surrey respectively.\n\nDan Douthwaite took 4-44 as the Welsh county scraped home by one wicket in the penultimate over at Neath, chasing a target of 201, and Warwickshire came out on top by three runs in a thrilling finish despite 149 by Surrey's Dom Sibley.\n\nIt was a tale of two players at opposite ends of the career spectrum for Worcestershire as they made it three wins out of three by inflicting a first defeat on previous group leaders Derbyshire.\n\nAfter Harry Came (71) and Luis Reece (34) shared an opening stand of 82 for the hosts, Home became only the ninth Worcestershire bowler to take six or more wickets in a List A innings as they were bowled out in 49.4 overs, with Zak Chappell last man out after weighing in with 48 off 33 balls.\n\nThe dangerous Ed Pollock fell for 11 in reply, but Roderick used all the experience gained in a List A career which began in South Africa in 2011 as he put on 84 with Rob Jones, reaching his 50 from 51 balls.\n\nRoderick accelerated to his 100 off 94 balls and hit the winning run off Samit Patel as he and Jake Libby (71 not out) shared an unbroken 161 in an eight-wicket victory.\n\nKasey Aldridge took career-best figures of 6-33 and George Thomas hit a maiden ton as Somerset thrashed Lancashire by eight wickets at Taunton to move level on points with Worcestershire.\n\nLancs opener George Bell laid a solid foundation with 56 from 81 balls, but Aldridgeâs introduction in the 31st over saw the visitors collapse from 121-2 to 167-9 before Chris Green's four sixes in a defiant 54-ball 65 helped the Red Rose to 218 all out.\n\nSomerset lost Andy Umeed early in the reply, but 20-year-old opener Thomas took control with a career-best unbeaten 106.\n\nFighting off cramp, Thomas brought up his ton off 134 balls, and smacked 14 fours and two sixes, sharing an unbroken 147-run stand with James Rew (60 from 63 balls) as the West Country side eased home with 9.1 overs to spare.\n\nNorthamptonshire suffered their fourth defeat in four as Colin Ackermann's controlled 108 saw Durham to a four-wicket win at the Riverside.\n\nIndia's Prithvi Shaw gave the visitors a rip-roaring start with 97 off 71 balls but he missed out on a hundred when he was caught off Scott Borthwick at the start of the 22nd over.\n\nAckermann contributed 2-38 as Durham worked their way through the Northants line-up and they were all out for 260 with four balls of their innings remaining.\n\nAfter losing two early wickets, Ackermann added 133 with Alex Lees (55) and went on to 100 from 94 balls before chipping a catch to cover, but Durham declined from 231-4 to 244-6 before reaching 261-6 to win with 11 balls in hand.\n\nThe task of scoring 20 off the final over at Rugby School proved just too much for Surrey as Warwickshire edged to their fourth win in four.\n\nNathan Barnwell hit Ollie Hannon-Dalby's first ball for six and James Taylor found the boundary from his fourth, but they could only manage two singles with six needed from the final two.\n\nWarwickshire's 311-9 was chiefly built on a fifth-wicket of partnership of 127 between Chris Benjamin (75 off 51 balls) and Michael Burgess (60 off 58).\n\nBut Sibley added 124 with Ben Geddes (62) for Surrey as he progressed to his fourth century in the 50-over format - and he hit four sixes and 12 fours before edging Hannon-Dalby to the keeper in the 48th over with his side still 27 short of their target.\n\nIt was touch and go for leaders Glamorgan at Neath CC but Jamie McIlroy saw them home with a boundary in the penultimate over off Jack Campbell.\n\nEarlier, Sussex's Tom Haines (44) and Henry Rogers (35) put on 59 for the second wicket but Timm van der Gugten picked up 3-23 in an impeccable spell of seam bowling as Sussex slumped to 130-7.\n\nYoungsters Bertie Foreman (32) and Archie Lenham (31) pushed them to 200 all out but Eddie Byrom made 51 off 46 balls at Glamorgan began their chase.\n\nLenham and Dan Ibrahim took three wickets each and when Billy Root was eighth out for 48 in the 42nd over, it looked like Sussex might achieve their first win, but the final-wicket pair of McIlroy and Andy Gorvin held their nerve as they reached 203-9.\n\nOllie Price fell two runs short of a hundred as Gloucestershire beat Yorkshire by 36 runs, their second win in four matches.\n\nHe made 98 off 118 balls at Clifton Park, York, before being bowled by George Hill, having put on 88 with opener Miles Hammond (54) as they made 251-9 in their 50 overs.\n\nShan Masood (76 off 68 balls) and James Wharton (56) kept Yorkshire in the hunt, but Matthew Revis' 41 was the only other score of note as they were all out for 215 at the start of the 48th over, with Matt Taylor claiming 3-35."
