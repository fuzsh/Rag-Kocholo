        "text": "Jessica Lange and Naomi Watts will star in the adaptation of Jean Nathan’s book The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll.\n\nGia Coppola, who previously directed Palo Alto, will helm the film based on a script by Merritt Johnson (Temple Grandin).\n\nThe Secret Life of the Lonely Doll centers on Dare Wright, who wrote the bestselling children’s book The Lonely Doll, which made her a household name in the 1950s. Four decades later, journalist Jean Nathan searches for the out-of-print book series, and discovers Wright living in a decrepit public hospital in Queens, New York. Nathan spent five years piecing together Wright’s life of glamour and isolation.\n\nIndigenous Media, the media company formed by award-winning filmmakers Jon Avnet, Rodrigo Garcia and Jake Avnet, is producing the film along with Bruce Cohen and Untitled Entertainment partner Jason Weinberg.\n\n“Rodrigo and I have been fans of and have worked with Merritt, Jessica and Naomi before,” said Jon Avnet. “Jean Nathan’s unique piece is a great vehicle for a reunion and chance for Gia Coppola to make a very distinctive film.”\n\nNathan’s book was first published in 2004. She is a New York based writer who has written for The New York Observes, The New York Times and The New Yorker, among others.\n\nLange’s will next be seen in Wild Oats and she’ll be starring on Broadway in Long Day’s Journey into Night opening in April. Her recent films include The Gambler and The Vow. She’s repped by Untitled Entertainment.\n\nWatts can currently be seen in The Divergent Series: Allegiant, in theaters this weekend. She will soon be seen with Jake Gyllenhaal in Demolition, and her upcoming films include Shut In and The Book of Henry. She’s repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment.\n\nCoppola is repped by CAA and Untitled. Johnson, who also wrote on the series In Treatment, is repped by CAA and Leverage Management."
