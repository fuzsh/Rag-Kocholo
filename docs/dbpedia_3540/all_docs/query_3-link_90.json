        "text": "Eric Dane is full of gratitude.\n\n“I’ve been put through the wringer,” the actor tells me Tuesday morning over Zoom while promoting his new indie drama, “One Fast Move.” “But now I’m having fucking fun.”\n\nMore from Variety\n\nRichard Gere and Mohammed Al Turki to Be Honored at amfAR's Venice Film Festival Gala (EXCLUSIVE)\n\n'Instigators' Star Jack Harlow Admits Acting 'Is Harder Than I Thought' After Movie Debut in 'White Men Can't Jump': 'I've Got to Get Better'\n\nDarren Criss to Join 'Emily in Paris' Star Ashley Park and Jinkx Monsoon at Kamala Harris Fundraiser at the Abbey\n\nFor many years, Dane’s private life played out in the tabloids. He recently opened up on Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast about his “Grey’s Anatomy” character Dr. Mark Sloan, a.k.a. McSteamy, being killed off the hit ABC show due, in part, to his real-life substance abuse problems.\n\nBut that was then.\n\nDane has been quite busy these last few years. In addition to “One Fast Move” – he plays a deadbeat dad and former motorcycle racing champion whose estranged son (Apa) comes back into his life – the actor appeared in this summer’s “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” opposite Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.\n\nAnd then there’s “Euphoria.” Dane has received critical acclaim for his work as Cal Jacobs, the very troubled and extremely closeted father of Jacob Elordi’s character. It was announced in July that “Euphoria” will return with a third season after controversy and production delays led many to believe that Zendaya & Co. were done with HBO show.\n\n“I was optimistic that it was going to come back so I’m very happy,” Dane says. “I know there’s a massive appetite for it out in the marketplace. There’s a huge audience, and I love making it. I love the people I work with. I love working with Sam Levinson. I have a great time. HBO is supportive in allowing us to do whatever the fuck we want to do.”\n\nHe has spoken to Levinson about Cal’s future. “The first thing I said to Sam when we wrapped Season 2 was, ‘I don’t want to be behind bars,’” Dane says. “So I’m almost 100% certain that I’m not behind bars…Anything else that follows I’m fine with.”\n\nHis work on “Euphoria” is dark. It’s not always easy to let it go after filming wraps. “Sometimes you take it in the car ride home with you. Sometimes, and infrequently, but it does happen, you bring it into the house with you,” he says. “But for the most part, this too shall pass and nothing beats a good night’s sleep.”\n\nNow, back to “Grey’s Anatomy.” He laughs when asked about what his daughters think of their dad playing “McSteamy.” “My 12-year-old , when she started watching it a couple of years ago looked at me and said, ‘Dad, where did your abs go?’” Dane remembers. “She was serious. She wasn’t making a joke.”\n\nThe 51-year-old actor insists his abs could make a comeback. “I just need to put some more effort in,” Dane says. “I have a climber but I’m not using it as much as I should. I am going to get back on that thing.”\n\nWith “Grey’s Anatomy” going into its 21st season, Dane has thoughts on whether his character is still alive and could potentially return to the show. (He did appear in a dream sequence in 2020 when Meredith Grey was in a coma from COVID).\n\n“No,” he says without missing a beat. “I think I did exactly what I was supposed to do on that show. I think I was on that show for exactly the amount of time that I was supposed to be on that show, and irrespective of how or why or in what manner in which I had departed, I think everything happened exactly as it was supposed to happen.”\n\nHe continues, “I don’t watch ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ [now] and I didn’t watch much when I was on but I sure did have a fun time making it. The actors had such a great relationship. I remember showing up to set and being like, ‘I love spending time with these people.’”\n\nDane had a similar experience with “One Fast Move.” He and Apa became very close during filming. “He’s a keeper,” Dane says.\n\nThe Kelly Blatz-directed film features several intense scenes between Dane and Apa. “There was one where after we shot it, KJ pulled me aside and said, ‘I really felt like hitting you, Eric,’’ Dane recalls. “I said, ‘I understand. I think that’s what you were supposed to feel.’”\n\n“One Fast Move” premieres on Prime Video on Aug. 8.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024"
