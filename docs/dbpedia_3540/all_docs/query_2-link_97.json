A method is given that allows the mathematical approach to be extended to three body problem, in spite of singularities. Applications are given [fr\n\nThree-body problem in quantum mechanics: Hyperspherical elliptic coordinates and harmonic basis sets\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAquilanti, Vincenzo; Tonzani, Stefano\n\n2004-01-01\n\nElliptic coordinates within the hyperspherical formalism for three-body problems were proposed some time ago [V. Aquilanti, S. Cavalli, and G. Grossi, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1362 (1986)] and recently have also found application, for example, in chemical reaction theory [see O. I. Tolstikhin and H. Nakamura, J. Chem. Phys. 108, 8899 (1998)]. Here we consider their role in providing a smooth transition between the known 'symmetric' and 'asymmetric' parametrizations, and focus on the corresponding hyperspherical harmonics. These harmonics, which will be called hyperspherical elliptic, involve products of two associated Lame polynomials. We will provide an expansion of these new sets in a finite series of standard hyperspherical harmonics, producing a powerful tool for future applications in the field of scattering and bound-state quantum-mechanical three-body problems\n\nTopics in three body problems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmado, R.D.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nAn overview of the formal theory of the three-body problem as it has developed in the past twelve years is given. The formal structure of the theory, some of the techniques that have developed for handling the theory, and some results on how general quantum mechanical principles structure the results, are presented. The discussion is held entirely in the context of non-relativistic quantum mechanics with short-range forces. In this presentation the main outline of the theory is stressed, often at the expense of mathematical rigour [pt\n\nThe three-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMusielak, Z E; Quarles, B\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe three-body problem, which describes three masses interacting through Newtonian gravity without any restrictions imposed on the initial positions and velocities of these masses, has attracted the attention of many scientists for more than 300 years. In this paper, we present a review of the three-body problem in the context of both historical and modern developments. We describe the general and restricted (circular and elliptic) three-body problems, different analytical and numerical methods of finding solutions, methods for performing stability analysis and searching for periodic orbits and resonances. We apply the results to some interesting problems of celestial mechanics. We also provide a brief presentation of the general and restricted relativistic three-body problems, and discuss their astronomical applications.

For a generic pairwise interaction potential, analytical formulas are obtained that allow estimation of the ground-state energy of the N-body system by finding the ground-state energy of a corresponding two-body problem. It is first shown that in the harmonic oscillator case, the Î²-dependent term grows faster with increasing N than the Î²-independent term. Then, it is argued that such a behavior should also be observed with generic potentials and for D-dimensional systems. Consequently, quantum N-body bound states might be interesting places to look at nontrivial manifestations of a minimal length, since the more particles that are present, the more the system deviates from standard quantum-mechanical predictions.\n\nThe three-body problem in quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAntunes, A.C.B.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nDifferent methods used in the analysis of the scattering of an elementary particle by a system of two bound particles are compared. All particles are considered spinless and distinguishable from each other. Two approaches are used in the treatment of the problem. In the first method we build an effective - potential which accounts for the interaction of the incident particle with the bound system. The second approach consists in treating the target as a system of two particles, whose momentum distribution is given by the bound state wavefunction. The three body system is then treated by the techniques of the multiple scattering series and of Glauber theory.

A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAs a straightforward generalization and extension of our previous paper [A. V. Turbiner et al., \"Three-body problem in 3D space: Ground state, (quasi)-exact-solvability,\" J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 215201 (2017)], we study the aspects of the quantum and classical dynamics of a 3-body system with equal masses, each body with d degrees of freedom, with interaction depending only on mutual (relative) distances. The study is restricted to solutions in the space of relative motion which are functions of mutual (relative) distances only. It is shown that the ground state (and some other states) in the quantum case and the planar trajectories (which are in the interaction plane) in the classical case are of this type. The quantum (and classical) Hamiltonian for which these states are eigenfunctions is derived. It corresponds to a three-dimensional quantum particle moving in a curved space with special d-dimension-independent metric in a certain d-dependent singular potential, while at d = 1, it elegantly degenerates to a two-dimensional particle moving in flat space. It admits a description in terms of pure geometrical characteristics of the interaction triangle which is defined by the three relative distances. The kinetic energy of the system is d-independent; it has a hidden sl(4, R) Lie (Poisson) algebra structure, alternatively, the hidden algebra h(3) typical for the H3 Calogero model as in the d = 3 case. We find an exactly solvable three-body S3-permutationally invariant, generalized harmonic oscillator-type potential as well as a quasi-exactly solvable three-body sextic polynomial type potential with singular terms. For both models, an extra first order integral exists. For d = 1, the whole family of 3-body (two-dimensional) Calogero-Moser-Sutherland systems as well as the Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz model is reproduced. It is shown that a straightforward generalization of the 3-body (rational) Calogero model to d > 1 leads to two primitive quasi\n\nPrecise numerical results for limit cycles in the quantum three-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMohr, R.F.; Furnstahl, R.J.; Hammer, H.-W.; Perry, R.J.; Wilson, K.G.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe study of the three-body problem with short-range attractive two-body forces has a rich history going back to the 1930s. Recent applications of effective field theory methods to atomic and nuclear physics have produced a much improved understanding of this problem, and we elucidate some of the issues using renormalization group ideas applied to precise nonperturbative calculations. These calculations provide 11-12 digits of precision for the binding energies in the infinite cutoff limit. The method starts with this limit as an approximation to an effective theory and allows cutoff dependence to be systematically computed as an expansion in powers of inverse cutoffs and logarithms of the cutoff. Renormalization of three-body bound states requires a short range three-body interaction, with a coupling that is governed by a precisely mapped limit cycle of the renormalization group. Additional three-body irrelevant interactions must be determined to control subleading dependence on the cutoff and this control is essential for an effective field theory since the continuum limit is not likely to match physical systems (e.g., few-nucleon bound and scattering states at low energy). Leading order calculations precise to 11-12 digits allow clear identification of subleading corrections, but these corrections have not been computed\n\nThree-body problem in the ground-state representation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGonzalez, A.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe ground-state probability density of a three-body system is used to construct a classical potential U whose minimum coincides exactly with the ground-state energy. The spectrum of excited states may approximately be obtained by imposing quasiclassical quantization conditions over the classical motion in U. We show nontrivial one-dimensional models in which either this quantization condition is exact or considerably improves the usual semiclassical quantization. For three-dimensional problems, the small-oscillation frequencies in states with total angular momentum L = 0 are computed. These frequencies could represent an improvement over the frequencies of triatomic molecules computed with the use of ordinary quasiclassics for the motion of the nuclei in the molecular term. By providing a semiclassical description of the first excited quantum states, the sketched approach rises some interesting questions such as, for example, the relevance (once again) of classical chaos to quantum mechanics\n\nThe three-body problem\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMarchal, Christian\n\n1990-01-01\n\nRecent research on the theory of perturbations, the analytical approach and the quantitative analysis of the three-body problem have reached a high degree of perfection. The use of electronics has aided developments in quantitative analysis and has helped to disclose the extreme complexity of the set of solutions. This accelerated progress has given new orientation and impetus to the qualitative analysis that is so complementary to the quantitative analysis. The book begins with the various formulations of the three-body problem, the main classical results and the important questions and conje\n\nNucleon many-body problem using quantum-mechanical few-body technique\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHoriuchi, Wataru\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA nucleus is treated as a quantum-mechanical many-body system consisting of protons and neutrons that interact with each other by nuclear force. This paper explains the variational calculation using the correlated basis function as a powerful technique for obtaining the precise solution of Schroedinger equation of many-body, and tries to understand the nucleon many-body system from the viewpoint of a few-body through the application cases of various nuclear systems. It describes the important correlation that characterizes the nucleon many-body system such as the mean field, cluster, and tensor of bound state, and shows that non-bound state is also describable. Since such precise theory is mantic, it is essential for explaining the nature of unknown unstable nuclei, and for determining the nuclear reaction rate under the environment of the stars difficult for experiment. The method is general and flexible, and can be applied to various quantum-mechanical many-body problems. For example, the multi-body calculation of atoms and molecules, hypernuclei, and hadron spectroscopy can be carried out only by changing the potential and particles.

Using recent results in representation theory an ordinary differential equation for some energy levels is found. For several interactive potentials these energy levels are calculated in explicit form.\n\nCTBC. A program to solve the collinear three-body Coulomb problem. Bound states and scattering below the three-body disintegration threshold\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTolstikhin, Oleg I.; Namba, Chusei\n\n2003-08-01\n\nA program to solve the quantum-mechanical collinear three-body Coulomb problem is described and illustrated by calculations for a number of representative systems and processes. In the internal region, the Schroedinger equation is solved in hyperspherical coordinates using the slow/smooth variable discretization method. In asymptotic regions, the solution is obtained in Jacobi coordinates using the asymptotic package GAILIT from the CPC library. Only bound states and scattering processes below the three-body disintegration threshold are considered here; resonances and fragmentation processes will be discussed in subsequent parts of this series.

Quantum characteristics, which appear in the Heisenberg picture as the Weyl's symbols of operators of canonical coordinates and momenta, can be used to solve the evolution equations for symbols of other operators acting in the Hilbert space. To any fixed order in the Planck's constant, many-body potential scattering problem simplifies to a statistical-mechanical problem of computing an ensemble of quantum characteristics and their derivatives with respect to the initial canonical coordinates and momenta. The reduction to a system of ordinary differential equations pertains rigorously at any fixed order in â. We present semiclassical expansion of quantum characteristics for many-body scattering problem and provide tools for calculation of average values of time-dependent physical observables and cross sections. The method of quantum characteristics admits the consistent incorporation of specific quantum effects, such as non-locality and coherence in propagation of particles, into the semiclassical transport models. We formulate the principle of stationary action for quantum Hamilton's equations and give quantum-mechanical extensions of the Liouville theorem on conservation of the phase-space volume and the Poincare theorem on conservation of 2p-forms. The lowest order quantum corrections to the Kepler periodic orbits are constructed. These corrections show the resonance behavior.

A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe employ generalized Euler coordinates for the n body system in dimensional space, which consists of the centre-of-mass vector, relative (mutual) mass-independent distances r ij and angles as remaining coordinates. We prove that the kinetic energy of the quantum n-body problem for can be written as the sum of three terms: (i) kinetic energy of centre-of-mass, (ii) the second order differential operator which depends on relative distances alone and (iii) the differential operator which annihilates any angle-independent function. The operator has a large reflection symmetry group and in variables is an algebraic operator, which can be written in terms of generators of the hidden algebra . Thus, makes sense of the Hamiltonian of a quantum EulerâArnold top in a constant magnetic field. It is conjectured that for any n, the similarity-transformed is the LaplaceâBeltrami operator plus (effective) potential; thus, it describes a -dimensional quantum particle in curved space. This was verified for . After de-quantization the similarity-transformed becomes the Hamiltonian of the classical top with variable tensor of inertia in an external potential. This approach allows a reduction of the dn-dimensional spectral problem to a -dimensional spectral problem if the eigenfunctions depend only on relative distances. We prove that the ground state function of the n body problem depends on relative distances alone.\n\nPoincarÃ© and the three body problem\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBarrow-Green, June\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe idea of chaos figures prominently in mathematics today. It arose in the work of one of the greatest mathematicians of the late 19th century, Henri PoincarÃ©, on a problem in celestial mechanics: the three body problem. This ancient problem-to describe the paths of three bodies in mutual gravitational interaction-is one of those which is simple to pose but impossible to solve precisely. PoincarÃ©'s famous memoir on the three body problem arose from his entry in the competition celebrating the 60th birthday of King Oscar of Sweden and Norway. His essay won the prize and was set up in print as a paper in Acta Mathematica when it was found to contain a deep and critical error. In correcting this error PoincarÃ© discovered mathematical chaos, as is now clear from Barrow-Green's pioneering study of a copy of the original memoir annotated by PoincarÃ© himself, recently discovered in the Institut Mittag-Leffler in Stockholm. PoincarÃ© and the Three Body Problem opens with a discussion of the development of the th...\n\nThe three-body problem from Pythagoras to Hawking\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nValtonen, Mauri; Kholshevnikov, Konstantin; MyllÃ¤ri, Aleksandr; Orlov, Victor; Tanikawa, Kiyotaka\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis book, written for a general readership, reviews and explains the three-body problem in historical context reaching to latest developments in computational physics and gravitation theory. The three-body problem is one of the oldest problems in science and it is most relevant even in todayâs physics and astronomy. The long history of the problem from Pythagoras to Hawking parallels the evolution of ideas about our physical universe, with a particular emphasis on understanding gravity and how it operates between astronomical bodies. The oldest astronomical three-body problem is the question how and when the moon and the sun line up with the earth to produce eclipses. Once the universal gravitation was discovered by Newton, it became immediately a problem to understand why these three-bodies form a stable system, in spite of the pull exerted from one to the other. In fact, it was a big question whether this system is stable at all in the long run. Leading mathematicians attacked this problem over more than...\n\nSolving the three-body Coulomb breakup problem using exterior complex scaling\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMcCurdy, C.W.; Baertschy, M.; Rescigno, T.N.\n\n2004-05-17\n\nElectron-impact ionization of the hydrogen atom is the prototypical three-body Coulomb breakup problem in quantum mechanics. The combination of subtle correlation effects and the difficult boundary conditions required to describe two electrons in the continuum have made this one of the outstanding challenges of atomic physics. A complete solution of this problem in the form of a ''reduction to computation'' of all aspects of the physics is given by the application of exterior complex scaling, a modern variant of the mathematical tool of analytic continuation of the electronic coordinates into the complex plane that was used historically to establish the formal analytic properties of the scattering matrix. This review first discusses the essential difficulties of the three-body Coulomb breakup problem in quantum mechanics. It then describes the formal basis of exterior complex scaling of electronic coordinates as well as the details of its numerical implementation using a variety of methods including finite difference, finite elements, discrete variable representations, and B-splines. Given these numerical implementations of exterior complex scaling, the scattering wave function can be generated with arbitrary accuracy on any finite volume in the space of electronic coordinates, but there remains the fundamental problem of extracting the breakup amplitudes from it. Methods are described for evaluating these amplitudes. The question of the volume-dependent overall phase that appears in the formal theory of ionization is resolved. A summary is presented of accurate results that have been obtained for the case of electron-impact ionization of hydrogen as well as a discussion of applications to the double photoionization of helium.\n\nThe three body problem with energy dependent potentials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKim, Y.E.; McKay, C.M.; McKellar, B.H.J.\n\n1975-10-01\n\nIt is shown how to generalize the three body equations of Faddeev, and of Karlsson and Zeiger, to include the case when the two body potential is energy dependent. Such generalizations will prove useful in the three nucleon problem and in three body models of nuclear reactions.

The scheme is obtained by taking the limit as mass approaches zero in the discrete-time general three-body problem. For a long time interval, the proposed scheme precisely reproduces various periodic orbits that cannot be accurately computed by other generic integrators\n\nComputational Nuclear Quantum Many-Body Problem: The UNEDF Project\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nBogner, Scott; Bulgac, Aurel; Carlson, Joseph A.; Engel, Jonathan; Fann, George; Furnstahl, Richard J.; Gandolfi, Stefano; Hagen, Gaute; Horoi, Mihai; Johnson, Calvin W.; Kortelainen, Markus; Lusk, Ewing; Maris, Pieter; Nam, Hai Ah; Navratil, Petr\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe UNEDF project was a large-scale collaborative effort that applied high-performance computing to the nuclear quantum many-body problem. UNEDF demonstrated that close associations among nuclear physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists can lead to novel physics outcomes built on algorithmic innovations and computational developments. This review showcases a wide range of UNEDF science results to illustrate this interplay.\n\nCanonical three-body angular basis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMatveenko, A.V.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThree-body problems are basic for the quantum mechanics of molecular, atomic, or nuclear systems. We demonstrate that their variational solution for rotational states can be greatly simplified. A special choice of coordinates (hyperspherical) and of the kinematics (body-fixed coordinate frame) allows one to choose basis functions in a form that makes the angular coupling trivial.

Different qutrit channels such as, amplitude damping, depolarizing, phase damping, trit-phase flip and phase flip channels are considered to analyze the behaviour of players payoffs. It is seen that Alice's payoff is heavily influenced by the amplitude damping channel as compared to the depolarizing and flipping channels. However, for higher level of decoherence, Alice's payoff is strongly affected by depolarizing noise. Whereas the behaviour of phase damping channel is symmetrical around 50% decoherence. It is also seen that for maximum decoherence ( p = 1), the influence of amplitude damping channel dominates over depolarizing and flipping channels. Whereas, phase damping channel has no effect on the Alice's payoff. Therefore, the problem becomes noiseless at maximum decoherence in case of phase damping channel. Furthermore, the Nash equilibrium of the problem does not change under decoherence.\n\nThe quantum N-body problem in the mean-field and semiclassical regime.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGolse, FranÃ§ois\n\n2018-04-28\n\nThe present work discusses the mean-field limit for the quantum N -body problem in the semiclassical regime. More precisely, we establish a convergence rate for the mean-field limit which is uniform as the ratio of Planck constant to the action of the typical single particle tends to zero. This convergence rate is formulated in terms of a quantum analogue of the quadratic Monge-Kantorovich or Wasserstein distance. This paper is an account of some recent collaboration with C. Mouhot, T. Paul and M. Pulvirenti.This article is part of the themed issue 'Hilbert's sixth problem'.

S., E-mail: g-ashot@sci.am [NAS of RA, Institute for Informatics and Automation Problems (Armenia)\n\n2017-03-15\n\nWe obtained the systemof stochastic differential equations which describes the classicalmotion of the three-body system under influence of quantum fluctuations. Using SDEs, for the joint probability distribution of the total momentum of bodies system were obtained the partial differential equation of the second order. It is shown, that the equation for the probability distribution is solved jointly by classical equations, which in turn are responsible for the topological peculiarities of tubes of quantum currents, transitions between asymptotic channels and, respectively for arising of quantum chaos.\n\nSpectral sum rules for the three-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBolle, D.; Osborn, T.A.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThis paper derives a number of sum rules for nonrelativistic three-body scattering. These rules are valid for any finite region Î¼ in the six-dimensional coordinate space. They relate energy moments of the trace of the onshell time-delay operator to the energy-weighted probability for finding the three-body bound-state wave functions in the region Î¼. If Î¼ is all of the six-dimensional space, the global form of the sum rules is obtained. In this form the rules constitute higher-order Levinson's theorems for the three-body problem. Finally, the sum rules are extended to allow the energy momtns have complex powers\n\nComputational nuclear quantum many-body problem: The UNEDF project\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBogner, S.; Bulgac, A.; Carlson, J.; Engel, J.; Fann, G.; Furnstahl, R.

Major topics covered include: second born-induced asymmetry in electron capture to the continuum; historical context, links to other tests of atomic scattering theory; experiments characterizing the velocity distribution of ECC electrons; other atomic physics tests of high velocity Born expansions; atom capture; capture by positrons; and pion capture to the continuum\n\nEfimov three-body states on top of a Fermi sea\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNygaard, Nicolai Gayle; Zinner, Nikolaj Thomas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe stabilization of Cooper pairs of bound electrons in the background of a Fermi sea is the origin of superconductivity and the paradigmatic example of the striking influence of many-body physics on few-body properties.

Three-particle equations for the case of pairing energy-dependent potentials are generalized and the problems related to this ambiguous generalization are investigated. In terms of the equations obtained the tritium binding energy and vertex coupling constants (Tdn) and (TdÎ½) are evaluated. The binding energy and, especially, coupling constants are shown to be sensitive to a shape of the energy-dependent potential\n\nThe quantum mechanics of many-body systems\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nThouless, David James; Brueckner, Keith A\n\n1961-01-01\n\nThe Quantum Mechanics of Many-Body Systems provides an introduction to that field of theoretical physics known as \"\"\"\"many-body theory.\"\"\"\" It is concerned with problems that are common to nuclear physics, atomic physics, the electron theory of metals, and to the theories of liquid helium three and four, and it describes the methods which have recently been developed to solve such problems. The aim has been to produce a unified account of the field, rather than to describe all the parallel methods that have been developed; as a result, a number of important papers are not mentioned.

Phys. 108 (1998) 5216], an efficient method was presented for performing 'exact' quantum calculations for the three-body rovibrational Hamiltonian, within the helicity-conserving approximation. This approach makes use of a certain three-body ''effective potential,'' enabling the same bend angle basis set to be employed for all values of the rotational quantum numbers, J, K and M. In the present work, the method is extended to incorporate Coriolis coupling, for which the relevant matrix elements are derived exactly. These can be used to solve the full three-body rovibrational problem, in the standard Jacobi coordinate vector embedding. Generalization of the method for coupled kinetic energy operators arising from other coordinate systems, embeddings, and/or system sizes, is also discussed.\n\nNon-integrability of the Anisotropic Stormer Problem and the Isosceles Three-Body Problem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNomikos, D. G.; Papageorgiou, V. G.\n\n2009-02-01\n\nWe study the Anisotropic Stormer Problem (ASP) and the Isosceles Three-Body Problem (IP), from the viewpoint of integrability, using Morales-Ramis theory and its generalization. The study of their integrability presents particular interest since they model important physical phenomena. Both problems can be reduced with respect to the S1 symmetry. Almeida and Stuchi [M.A. Almeida, T.J. Stuchi, Non-integrability of the anisotropic Stormer problem with angular momentum, Physica D 189 (2004) 219-233] proved that the reduced ASP is non-integrable for almost all values of the parameters. In this paper we establish the non-integrability (in the extended Liouville sense) of the remaining cases. The IP is a special case of the three-body problem and it can be considered as a generalization of the Sitnikov problem. Here we prove that the complexified reduced IP does not admit an additional independent meromorphic first integral.\n\nA cluster expansion for bound three-alpha particles as a three-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOsman, A.\n\n1981-08-01\n\nA three-body model is proposed to study the nuclear bound states. The nucleus is described as a bound state of three clusters. A cluster expansion is introduced for the three cluster bound state problem. The present integral equations are treated by simple approximate solutions, which lead to effective potentials by using the present cluster expansion. The 12 C nucleus is described as a three-alpha particle bound state. The binding energy of 12 C is calculated numerically using the present cluster expansion as bound three-alpha clusters. The present three-body cluster expansion calculations are very near to the exact three-body calculations using separable potentials. The present theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental measurements.

It is difficult to verify whether a numerical procedure yields the correct solutions to the G3BP because doing so requires knowledge of all 11 conserved quantities, whereas only six are known. Without tracking all of the conserved quantities, it is possible to show that the discrete general three-body problem (d-G3BP) yields the correct orbits corresponding to Lagrange solutions of the G3BP. We show that the d-G3BP yields the correct solutions to the G3BP for two special cases: the equilateral triangle and collinear configurations. For the triangular solution, we use the fact that the solution to the three-body case is a superposition of the solutions to the three two-body cases, and we show that the three bodies maintain the same relative distances at all times. To obtain the collinear solution, we assume a specific permutation of the three bodies arranged along a straight rotating line, and we show that the d-G3BP maintains the same distance ratio between two bodies as in the G3BP. Proving that the d-G3BP solutions for these cases are equivalent to those of the G3BP makes it likely that the d-G3BP and G3BP solutions are equivalent in other cases. To our knowledge, this is the first work that proves the equivalence of the discrete solutions and the Lagrange orbits.\n\nEfimov three-body states on top of a Fermi sea\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNygaard, Nicolai Gayle; Zinner, Nikolaj Thomas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe stabilization of Cooper pairs of bound electrons in the background of a Fermi sea is the origin of superconductivity and the paradigmatic example of the striking influence of many-body physics on few-body properties. In the quantum-mechanical three-body problem the famous Efimov effect yields unexpected scaling relations among a tower of universal states. These seemingly unrelated problems can now be studied in the same setup thanks to the success of ultracold atomic gas experiments. In light of the tremendous effect of a background Fermi sea on two-body properties, a natural question is whether a background can modify or even destroy the Efimov effect. Here we demonstrate how the generic problem of three interacting particles changes when one particle is embedded in a background Fermi sea, and show that Efimov scaling persists. It is found in a scaling that relates the three-body physics to the background density of fermionic particles\n\nNonlocality in many-body quantum systems detected with two-body correlators\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTura, J., E-mail: jordi.tura@icfo.es [ICFOâInstitut de Ciencies Fotoniques, Mediterranean Technology Park, 08860 Castelldefels (Barcelona) (Spain); Augusiak, R.; Sainz, A.B.

In contrast, much less is known about the role of quantum nonlocality in these systems, mostly because the available multipartite Bell inequalities involve high-order correlations among many particles, which are hard to access theoretically, and even harder experimentally. Standard, âtheorist- and experimentalist-friendlyâ many-body observables involve correlations among only few (one, two, rarely three...) particles. Typically, there is no multipartite Bell inequality for this scenario based on such low-order correlations. Recently, however, we have succeeded in constructing multipartite Bell inequalities that involve two- and one-body correlations only, and showed how they revealed the nonlocality in many-body systems relevant for nuclear and atomic physics [Tura etÂ al., Science 344 (2014) 1256]. With the present contribution we continue our work on this problem. On the one hand, we present a detailed derivation of the above Bell inequalities, pertaining to permutation symmetry among the involved parties. On the other hand, we present a couple of new results concerning such Bell inequalities. First, we characterize their tightness. We then discuss maximal quantum violations of these inequalities in the general case, and their scaling with the number of parties. Moreover, we provide new classes of two-body Bell inequalities which reveal nonlocality of the Dicke statesâground states of physically relevant and experimentally realizable Hamiltonians. Finally, we shortly discuss various scenarios for nonlocality detection in mesoscopic systems of trapped ions or atoms, and by atoms trapped in the vicinity of designed nanostructures.\n\nExplicit solution of the quantum three-body Calogero-Sutherland model\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nPerelomov, A.M.; Zaugg, P.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nQuantum integrable systems generalizing Calogero-Sutherland systems were introduced by Olshanetsky and Perelomov (1977). Recently, it was proved that for systems with trigonometric potential, the series in the product of two wave functions is a deformation of the Clebsch-Gordan series. This yields recursion relations for the wave functions of those systems. In this note, this approach is used to compute the explicit expressions for the three-body Calogero-Sutherland wave functions, which are the Jack polynomials. We conjecture that similar results are also valid for the more general two-parameters deformation introduced by Macdonald.\n\nQuantum complexity of graph and algebraic problems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDoern, Sebastian\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis thesis is organized as follows: In Chapter 2 we give some basic notations, definitions and facts from linear algebra, graph theory, group theory and quantum computation.

As an application, we develop a spinless, one-dimensional (1-D) model that mimics three-nucleon dynamics in one dimension. Using simple two-body potentials that reproduce the deuteron binding, we obtain that the three-body system binds at about 7.5 MeV. We then consider two types of residual pionic corrections in the dynamical equation; one related to the 2Ï-exchange three-body diagram, the other to the 1Ï-exchange three-body diagram. We find that the first contribution can produce an additional binding effect of about 0.9 MeV. The second term produces smaller binding effects, which are, however, dependent on the uncertainty in the off-shell extrapolation of the two-body t-matrix. This presents interesting analogies with what occurs in three dimensions. The paper also discusses the general three-particle quantum scattering problem, for motion restricted to the fall line.

I.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nA hyperspherical Coulomb spheroidal (HSCS) representation is proposed for the Coulomb three-body problem. This is a new expansion in the set of well-known Coulomb spheroidal functions. The orthogonality of Coulomb spheroidal functions on a constant-hyperradius surface Ï = const rather than on a constant-internuclear-distance surface R = const, as in the traditional Born-Oppenheimer approach, is a distinguishing feature of the proposed approach. Owing to this, the HSCS representation proves to be consistent with the asymptotic conditions for the scattering problem at energies below the threshold for three-body breakup: only a finite number of radial functions do not vanish in the limit of Ïââ, with the result that the formulation of the scattering problem becomes substantially simpler. In the proposed approach, the HSCS basis functions are considerably simpler than those in the well-known adiabatic hyperspherical representation, which is also consistent with the asymptotic conditions. Specifically, the HSCS basis functions are completely factorized. Therefore, there arise no problems associated with avoided crossings of adiabatic hyperspherical terms.\n\nOn the libration collinear points in the restricted three â body problem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlzahrani F.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available In the restricted problem of three bodies when the primaries are triaxial rigid bodies, the necessary and sufficient conditions to find the locations of the three libration collinear points are stated. In addition, the Linear stability of these points is studied for the case of the Euler angles of rotational motion being Î¸i = 0, Ïi + Ïi = Ï/2, i = 1, 2 accordingly. We underline that the model studied in this paper has special importance in space dynamics when the third body moves in gravitational fields of planetary systems and particularly in a Jupiter model or a problem including an irregular asteroid.\n\nGenerating families in the restricted three-body problem\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nHÃ©non, Michel\n\nThe classical restricted three-body problem is of fundamental importance because of its applications in astronomy and space navigation, and also as a simple model of a non-integrable Hamiltonian dynamical system. A central role is played by periodic orbits, of which many have been computed numerically. This is the second volume of an attempt to explain and organize the material through a systematic study of generating families, the limits of families of periodic orbits when the mass ratio of the two main bodies becomes vanishingly small. We use quantitative analysis in the vicinity of bifurcations of types 1 and 2. In most cases the junctions between branches can now be determined. A first-order approximation of families of periodic orbits in the vicinity of a bifurcation is also obtained. This book is intended for scientists and students interested in the restricted problem, in its applications to astronomy and space research, and in the theory of dynamical systems.\n\nThree-body scattering problem in the fixed center approximation: The case of attraction\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKudryavtsev, Alexander E.

The results for the three-body scattering amplitude appear to be ambiguous -they depend on a single real parameter. This parameter may be fixed by a three-body input, e.g., the three-body scattering length. We also solve the integral equation for the three-body Green function in the momentum space, introducing a finite cut-off. We show that all three approaches are equivalent. We also discuss how our approach to the problem matches with the introduction of three-body contact interaction as done by other authors.

These classes have a simple description in terms of syzygy (or eclipse) sequences. Each homotopy class corresponds to a unique âreducedâ syzygy sequence. We prove that each reduced syzygy sequence is realized by a periodic solution of the rotation-reduced Newtonian planar three-body problem. The realizing solutions have small, nonzero angular momentum, repeatedly come very close to triple collision, and have lots of âstuttersâârepeated syzygies of the same type, which cancel out up to homotopy. The heart of the proof stems from the work by one of us on symbolic dynamics arising out of the central configurations after the triple collision is blown up using McGehee's method. We end with a list of open problems.

This method gives the possibility to obtain important results in nuclear physics. A materials of general character is presented which can be useful when considering a few-body problem in atomic and molecular physics as well as in elementary particle physics. The paper deals with the theory of hyperspherical functions and the method of expansion in terms of hyperspherical functions basis can be formally considered as a certain generalization of the partial expansion method in the two-body problem. The Raynal-Revai theory is stated for the three-body problem and coe-- fficients of unitary transformations for four-particle hyperspherical function coefficients are introduced. Five-particle hyperspherical functions are introduced and an attempt of generalization of the theory for the systems With any number of particles has been made. The rules of plotting symmetrized hyperspherical functions for three and four identical particles are given. Also described is the method of expansion in terms of hyperspherical functions basis in the coordinate and impulse representations for discrete and continuous spectrum, respectively\n\nCoulomb effects in deuteron stripping reactions as a three-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOsman, A.\n\n1981-08-01\n\nDeuteron stripping nuclear reactions are reconsidered as a three-body problem. The Coulomb effects between the proton and the target nucleus are investigated. The mathematical formalism introduces three-body integral equations which can be exactly calculated for such simple models. These coupled integral equations suitably include the Coulomb effects due to replusive or attractive Coulomb potential. Numerical calculations of the differential cross-sections of the reactions 28 Si(d,p) 29 Si and 40 Ca(d,p) 41 Ca are carried out showing the importance of the Coulomb effects. The angular distributions of these reactions are theoretically calculated and fitted to the experimental data. From this fitting, reasonable spectroscopic factors are obtained. Inclusion of Coulomb force in the three-body model are found to improve the results by a percentage of about 6.826%.

This seems to us to provide evidence for both the incompleteness of the standard Lyapunov analysis and the strength of the geometrical analysis. Moreover, we apply this approach to the three body problem in which the third body is restricted to move on a circle of large radius which induces an adiabatic time dependent potential on the second body. This causes the second body to move in a very interesting and intricate but periodic trajectory; however, the standard Lyapunov analysis, as well as methods based on the parametric variation of curvature associated with the Jacobi metric, incorrectly predict chaotic behavior. The geometric approach predicts the correct stable motion in this case as well. - Highlights: â Lyapunov analysis predicts Kepler motion to be unstable. â Geometrical analysis predicts the observed stability. â Lyapunov analysis predicts chaotic behavior in restricted three body problem. â The geometric approach predicts the correct stable motion in restricted three body problem.\n\nModified Strum functions method in the nuclear three body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNasyrov, M.; Abdurakhmanov, A.; Yunusova, M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nFadeev-Hahn equations in the nuclear three-body problem were solved by modified Sturm functions method.

Using geometric/mechanic methods we study the approximate dynamics of the truncated Legendre series representation of the potential of an arbitrary order. Working in the reduced problem, we study the existence of relative equilibria that we refer to as Lagrange type following the analogy with the standard techniques. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear stability of Lagrangian relative equilibria if the gyrostat morphology form is close to a sphere. Thus, we generalize the classical results on equilibria of the three-body problem and many results on them obtained by the classic approach for the case of rigid bodies.\n\nQuadratic and coulomb terms for the spectrum of a three-electron quantum dot\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHassanabadi, H.; Hamzavi, M.; Zarrinkamar, S.; Rajabi, A.A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe consider the Hamiltonian of a three-electron quantum dot composed of quadratic plus Coulomb terms and calculate the system's spectra. We next apply the hyperradius to reduce the three-body Schroedinger equation into a one-variable differential equation that is solvable. To avoid the complexity, the Taylor expansion of the effective potential is enters the problem and thereby a solution is found for the eigenvalues of the corresponding three-body Schroedinger equation in terms of the Wigner parameter. Using a quasi-analytical approach, we have calculated the energy eigenvalues of the Schroedinger equation corresponding to a three-electron quantum dot. In addition to the hyperspherical coordinates, much of mathematical complexity has been avoided using the idea of Taylor expansion for the potential. For the potential, we have considered quadratic plus Coulomb terms. The obtained energy eigenvalues in terms of the Wigner parameter are given in tabular form.

In particular, the input Born and overlap matrix-valued functions are evaluated analytically, and the CG equations are solved using a B-spline collocation method. The computed scattering matrix elements are within 0.5% of the known exact solutions, and the corresponding scattering probabilities are within 0.001% of the exact probabilities, both below and above the 3-body breakup threshold. These results establish that the CG method is practical, as well as theoretically correct, and may be a valuable approach for solving certain more complicated N-body scattering problems\n\nHyperspherical functions and quantum-mechanical three-body problem with application to carbon 12\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLetz, H.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nIn this work a system of three identical particles (bosons) interacting by a particular two-body force is discussed.

We prove that any solution to Newton's three-body problem which is asymptotic to Lagrange's parabolic homothetic solution is eventually a free time minimizer. Conversely, we prove that every free time minimizer tends to Lagrange's solution, provided the mass ratios lie in a certain large open set of mass ratios. We were inspired by the work of Da Luz and Maderna (Math Proc Camb Philos Soc 156:209-227, 1980) which showed that every free time minimizer for the N-body problem is parabolic and therefore must be asymptotic to the set of central configurations. We exclude being asymptotic to Euler's central configurations by a second variation argument. Central configurations correspond to rest points for the McGehee blown-up dynamics. The large open set of mass ratios are those for which the linearized dynamics at each Euler rest point has a complex eigenvalue.\n\nBeautiful Models: 70 Years of Exactly Solved Quantum Many-Body Problems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBatchelor, M T\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA key element of theoretical physics is the conceptualisation of physical phenomena in terms of models, which are then investigated by the tools at hand.

To any power of (a/Î») the calculation of any specific b/sub l/ is reduced to a finite number of quadratures. The method, therefore, is the low-temperature counterpart of the high-temperature expansion of b/sub l/\n\nMuonic molecules as three-body Coulomb problem in adiabatic approximation\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDecker, M.\n\n1994-04-01\n\nThe three-body Coulomb problem is treated within the framework of the hyperspherical adiabatic approach. The surface functions are expanded into Faddeev-type components in order to ensure the equivalent representation of all possible two-body contributions. It is shown that this decomposition reduces the numerical effort considerably. The remaining radial equations are solved both in the extreme and the uncoupled adiabatic approximation to determine the binding energies of the systems (dtÎ¼) and (d 3 HeÎ¼). Whereas the ground state is described very well in the uncoupled adiabatic approximation, the excited states should be treated within the coupled adiabatic approximation to obtain good agreement with variational calculations.

We propose measures including entanglement, condensate depletion, and spreading over a fixed basis in many-body Hilbert space, which quantitatively identify the region in which quantum chaotic many-body dynamics occurs, where random matrix theory is limited or inaccessible. With these tools, we show that many-body quantum chaos is neither highly entangled nor delocalized in the Hilbert space, contrary to conventionally expected signatures of quantum chaos.\n\nEnergy Analysis in the Elliptic Restricted Three-body Problem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQi, Yi; de Ruiter, Anton\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe gravity assist or flyby is investigated by analyzing the inertial energy of a test particle in the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP), where two primary bodies are moving in elliptic orbits. Firstly, the expression of the derivation of energy is obtained and discussed. Then, the approximate expressions of energy change in a circular neighborhood of the smaller primary are derived. Numerical computation indicates that the obtained expressions can be applied to study the flyby problem of the nine planets and the Moon in the solar system. Parameters related to the flyby are discussed analytically and numerically. The optimal conditions, including the position and time of the periapsis, for a flyby orbit are found to make a maximum energy gain or loss. Finally, the mechanical process of a flyby orbit is uncovered by an approximate expression in the ERTBP. Numerical computations testify that our analytical results well approximate the mechanical process of flyby orbits obtained by the numerical simulation in the ERTBP. Compared with the previous research established in the patched-conic method and numerical calculation, our analytical investigations based on a more elaborate derivation get more original results.\n\nA method for solving a three-body problem with energy-dependent interactions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSafronov, A.N.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nA method is proposed for solving a three-body problem with energy-dependent interactions. This method is based on introducing the dependence of scattering operators and state vectors on an additional external parameter. Effects caused by the energy dependence of the interaction operator are investigated by using the unitary condition for the amplitude of the 2 â 2 and 2 â 3 transitions. It is shown, in particular, that taking this dependence into account leads to a change in the relation between the asymptotic normalization factor of the wave function of the three-body bound state and the vertex constant of virtual dissociation (synthesis) of the system into two fragments. 15 refs\n\nGenuine quantum correlations in quantum many-body systems: a review of recent progress.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDe Chiara, Gabriele; Sanpera, Anna\n\n2018-04-19\n\nQuantum information theory has considerably helped in the understanding of quantum many-body systems. The role of quantum correlations and in particular, bipartite entanglement, has become crucial to characterise, classify and simulate quantum many body systems. Furthermore, the scaling of entanglement has inspired modifications to numerical techniques for the simulation of many-body systems leading to the, now established, area of tensor networks. However, the notions and methods brought by quantum information do not end with bipartite entanglement. There are other forms of correlations embedded in the ground, excited and thermal states of quantum many-body systems that also need to be explored and might be utilised as potential resources for quantum technologies. The aim of this work is to review the most recent developments regarding correlations in quantum many-body systems focussing on multipartite entanglement, quantum nonlocality, quantum discord, mutual information but also other non classical measures of correlations based on quantum coherence. Moreover, we also discuss applications of quantum metrology in quantum many-body systems.

The phase space contributions from each of the ladder diagrams and interference diagrams are presented. We correct part of the results for the three-body decay functions calculated previously by two groups. Employing our new results, the properties of the three-body decay functions in the regions of soft partons are examined numerically. Furthermore, we examine the contribution of the three-body decay functions modified by the restriction resulting from the kinematical boundary of the phase space for two-body decay in the parton shower model. This restriction leads to some problems for the parton shower model. For this reason, we propose a new restriction introduced by the kinematical boundary of the phase space for two-body decay.

[Nat. Commun. 6, 8173 (2015)NCAOBW2041-172310.1038/ncomms9173]. In these resonances, one of the atoms carries away an energy excess preventing the two-body resonance, leading thus to a Borromean type of FÃ¶rster energy transfer. But they were in fact observed as the average signal for the large number of atoms Nâ«1. In this Letter, we report on the first experimental observation of the three-body FÃ¶rster resonances 3ÃnP_{3/2}(|M|)ânS_{1/2}+(n+1)S_{1/2}+nP_{3/2}(|M^{*}|) in a few Rb Rydberg atoms with n=36, 37. We have found here clear evidence that there is no signature of the three-body FÃ¶rster resonance for exactly two interacting Rydberg atoms, while it is present for N=3-5 atoms. This demonstrates the assumption that three-body resonances can generalize to any Rydberg atom. As such resonance represents an effective three-body operator, it can be used to directly control the three-body interactions in quantum simulations and quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.\n\nSturm solutions of the two-centre problem in quantum mechanics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTruskova, N.F.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nAlgorithm of computer calculation of the Sturm solutions of the two-body problem in quantum mechanics has been presented for different magnitudes of internuclear distance R and at energies E<0, which correspond to a definite term of the above problem or to a constants.

The method is developed analytically and computationally. For the analytical developments, analytical solutions in power series of the pseudotime Ï are obtained for positions and velocities (u, v, u', v' and (x, y, xË, yË in both regularized and physical planes respectively, the physical time t is also obtained as power series in Ï. Moreover, relations between the coefficients of the power series are obtained for two consequent values of n. Also, we developed analytical solutions in power series form for the inverse problem of finding Ï in terms of t. As typical examples, three symbolic expressions for the coefficients of the power series were developed in terms of initial values. As to the computational developments, the global regularized equations of motion are developed together with their initial values in forms suitable for digital computations using any differential equations solver. On the other hand, for numerical evolutions of power series, an efficient method depending on the continued fraction theory is provided.\n\nA simple coordinate space approach to three-body problems ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nWe show how to treat the dynamics of an asymmetric three-body system consisting of one heavy and two identical light particles in a simple coordinate space variational approach.

The approximations treat the Coulomb interference as mainly a two-body effect, but we allow for the charge distribution of the deuteron in the p-d calculations. Real and imaginary parts of the Coulomb correction to the elastic scattering phase shifts are described in terms of on-shell quantities only. In the case of pure Coulomb breakup we recover the distorted-wave Born approximation result. Comparing the derived approximation with the full Faddeev p-d elastic scattering calculation, which includes the Coulomb force, we obtain good qualitative agreement in S and P waves, but disagreement in repulsive higher partial waves. The on-shell approximation investigated is found to be superior to other current approximations. The calculated differential cross sections at 10 MeV raise the question of whether there is a significant Coulomb-nuclear interference at backward angles\n\nClassical and quantum simulations of many-body systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMurg, Valentin\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThis thesis is devoted to recent developments in the fields of classical and quantum simulations of many-body systems. We describe new classical algorithms that overcome problems apparent in conventional renormalization group and Monte Carlo methods. These algorithms make possible the detailed study of finite temperature properties of 2-D classical and 1-D quantum systems, the investigation of ground states of 2-D frustrated or fermionic systems and the analysis of time evolutions of 2-D quantum systems. Furthermore, we propose new ''analog'' quantum simulators that are able to realize interesting models such as a Tonks-Girardeau gas or a frustrated spin-1/2 XY model on a trigonal lattice. These quantum simulators make use of optical lattices and trapped ions and are technically feasible. In fact, the Tonks-Girardeau gas has been realized experimentally and we provide a detailed comparison between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions.

Solutions show an appearance of new resonance states and dependence of resonance energy and width on distance between two ï¬xed centers. The approach of exact analytical solutions is expanded to the cases when two-body scattering amplitudes have the Breit-Wignerâs form and employed for description of neutron resonance scattering on subsystem of two heavy nuclei ï¬xed in nodes of crystalline lattice. It is shown that some resonance states have widths close to zero at the certain values of distance between two heavy scatterer centers, this gives the possibility of transitions between states. One of these transitions between three-body resonance states could be connected with process of electron capture by proton with formation of neutron and emission of neutrino. This exoenergic process leading to the cooling of star without nuclear reactions is discussed.\n\nApplication of Symplectic Algebraic Dynamics Algorithm to Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWei-Tao, Lu; Hua, Zhang; Shun-Jin, Wang\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSymplectic algebraic dynamics algorithm (SADA) for ordinary differential equations is applied to solve numerically the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) in dynamical astronomy for both stable motion and chaotic motion.

Classical cryptography widely used nowadays is based on computational complexity, which means that it assumes that solving some particular mathematical problems is hard on a classical computer. With the development of supercomputers and, potentially, quantum computers, classical cryptography has more and more potential risks. Quantum cryptography provides a solution which is based on the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and no-cloning theorem. While BB84-based quantum protocols are only secure when a single photon is used in communication, the three-stage quantum protocol is multi-photon tolerant. However, existing analyses assume perfect noiseless channels. In this paper, a multi-photon analysis is performed for the three-stage quantum protocol under the collective-rotation noise model. The analysis provides insights into the impact of the noise level on a three-stage quantum cryptography system.\n\nAdvances in quantum mechanics contemporary trends and open problems\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nDell'Antonio, Gianfausto\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis volume collects recent contributions on the contemporary trends in the mathematics of quantum mechanics, and more specifically in mathematical problems arising in quantum many-body dynamics, quantum graph theory, cold atoms, unitary gases, with particular emphasis on the developments of the specific mathematical tools needed, including: linear and non-linear SchrÃ¶dinger equations, topological invariants, non-commutative geometry, resonances and operator extension theory, among others. Most of contributors are international leading experts or respected young researchers in mathematical physics, PDE, and operator theory. All their material is the fruit of recent studies that have already become a reference in the community. Offering a unified perspective of the mathematics of quantum mechanics, it is a valuable resource for researchers in the field.\n\nTails and bridges in the parabolic restricted three-body problem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBarrabÃ©s, Esther; Cors, Josep M.; Garcia-Taberner, Laura; OllÃ©, MercÃ¨\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAfter a close encounter of two galaxies, bridges and tails can be seen between or around them. A bridge would be a spiral arm between a galaxy and its companion, whereas a tail would correspond to a long and curving set of debris escaping from the galaxy. The goal of this paper is to present a mechanism, applying techniques of dynamical systems theory, that explains the formation of tails and bridges between galaxies in a simple model, the so-called parabolic restricted three-body problem, i.e. we study the motion of a particle under the gravitational influence of two primaries describing parabolic orbits. The equilibrium points and the final evolutions in this problem are recalled,and we show that the invariant manifolds of the collinear equilibrium points and the ones of the collision manifold explain the formation of bridges and tails. Massive numerical simulations are carried out and their application to recover previous results are also analysed.\n\nIllustrating chaos: a schematic discretization of the general three-body problem in Newtonian gravity\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLeigh, Nathan W. C.; Wegsman, Shalma\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present a formalism for constructing schematic diagrams to depict chaotic three-body interactions in Newtonian gravity. This is done by decomposing each interaction into a series of discrete transformations in energy- and angular momentum-space. Each time a transformation is applied, the system changes state as the particles re-distribute their energy and angular momenta. These diagrams have the virtue of containing all of the quantitative information needed to fully characterize most bound or unbound interactions through time and space, including the total duration of the interaction, the initial and final stable states in addition to every intervening temporary meta-stable state. As shown via an illustrative example for the bound case, prolonged excursions of one of the particles, which by far dominates the computational cost of the simulations, are reduced to a single discrete transformation in energy- and angular momentum-space, thereby potentially mitigating any computational expense. We further generalize our formalism to sequences of (unbound) three-body interactions, as occur in dense stellar environments during binary hardening. Finally, we provide a method for dynamically evolving entire populations of binaries via three-body scattering interactions, using a purely analytic formalism. In principle, the techniques presented here are adaptable to other three-body problems that conserve energy and angular momentum.\n\nThree-body interactions in many-body effective field theory\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFurnstahl, R.J.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThis contribution is an advertisement for applying effective field theory (EFT) to many-body problems, including nuclei and cold atomic gases.

Math. 152 881-901)). Unfortunately there is an error in the proof and the problem is still open. Consider the Î±-homogeneous Newton-type potential, 1/rÎ±, using action minimization method, we prove the existence of this solution, for Î± \\\\in (1, 2) ; for Î±=1 (the Newtonian potential), an extra condition is required, which unfortunately seems hard to verify at this moment.\n\nProblems and solutions in quantum physics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nFicek, Zbigniew\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis book contains tutorial problems with solutions for the textbook Quantum Physics for Beginners.

Hence, developing a reliable and efficient technique to witness its presence is pivotal in achieving the practical implementation of quantum technologies. Here, we experimentally identify genuine many-body quantum interference via a recent efficient protocol, which exploits statistical signatures at the output of a multimode quantum device. We successfully apply the test to validate three-photon experiments in an integrated photonic circuit, providing an extensive analysis on the resources required to perform it. Moreover, drawing upon established techniques of machine learning, we show how such tools help to identify theâa priori unknownâoptimal features to witness these signatures. Our results provide evidence on the efficacy and feasibility of the method, paving the way for its adoption in large-scale implementations.\n\nGENERAL: Application of Symplectic Algebraic Dynamics Algorithm to Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLu, Wei-Tao; Zhang, Hua; Wang, Shun-Jin\n\n2008-07-01\n\nSymplectic algebraic dynamics algorithm (SADA) for ordinary differential equations is applied to solve numerically the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) in dynamical astronomy for both stable motion and chaotic motion.

The method is based on the extraction of instantaneous frequencies from the wavelet transform of numerical solutions. Time-varying frequencies provide a good diagnostic tool to discern chaotic trajectories from regular ones, and we can identify resonance islands that greatly affect the dynamics. Good accuracy in the calculation of time-varying frequencies allows us to determine resonance trappings of chaotic trajectories and resonance transitions. We show the relation between resonance transitions and transport in different regions of the phase space\n\nRenormalization-group study of the four-body problem\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSchmidt, Richard; Moroz, Sergej\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe perform a renormalization-group analysis of the nonrelativistic four-boson problem by means of a simple model with pointlike three- and four-body interactions. We investigate in particular the region where the scattering length is infinite and all energies are close to the atom threshold. We find that the four-body problem behaves truly universally, independent of any four-body parameter. Our findings confirm the recent conjectures of others that the four-body problem is universal, now also from a renormalization-group perspective. We calculate the corresponding relations between the four- and three-body bound states, as well as the full bound-state spectrum and comment on the influence of effective range corrections.\n\nEDITORIAL: Focus on Quantum Information and Many-Body Theory\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEisert, Jens; Plenio, Martin B.\n\n2010-02-01\n\nQuantum many-body models describing natural systems or materials and physical systems assembled piece by piece in the laboratory for the purpose of realizing quantum information processing share an important feature: intricate correlations that originate from the coherent interaction between a large number of constituents. In recent years it has become manifest that the cross-fertilization between research devoted to quantum information science and to quantum many-body physics leads to new ideas, methods, tools, and insights in both fields. Issues of criticality, quantum phase transitions, quantum order and magnetism that play a role in one field find relations to the classical simulation of quantum systems, to error correction and fault tolerance thresholds, to channel capacities and to topological quantum computation, to name but a few. The structural similarities of typical problems in both fields and the potential for pooling of ideas then become manifest. Notably, methods and ideas from quantum information have provided fresh approaches to long-standing problems in strongly correlated systems in the condensed matter context, including both numerical methods and conceptual insights.

This method has been successfully applied to the exploration of few boson and fermion problems in the quantum Hall region, as well as the study of inter-Landau level collective excitations (Rittenhouse et al., 2016; Wooten et al., 2016). However, the hyperspherical method as it is normally implemented requires a subsidiary (anti-)symmetrization process, which limits its computational effectiveness. The present work overcomes these difficulties and extends the power of this method by implementing a representation of the hyperspherical many-body basis space in terms of Slater determinants of single particle eigenfunctions. A clear connection between the hyperspherical representation and the conventional single particle picture is presented, along with a compact operator representation of the theoretical framework. - Highlights: â¢ A hyperspherical method has been implemented to study the quantum Hall effect. â¢ The hyperspherical many-body basis space is represented with Slater determinants. â¢ Example numerical studies of the 4- and 8-electron systems are presented.\n\nHigh-Order Analytic Expansion of Disturbing Function for Doubly Averaged Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTakashi Ito\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Terms in the analytic expansion of the doubly averaged disturbing function for the circular restricted three-body problem using the Legendre polynomial are explicitly calculated up to the fourteenth order of semimajor axis ratio (Î± between perturbed and perturbing bodies in the inner case (Î±1. The expansion outcome is compared with results from numerical quadrature on an equipotential surface. Comparison with direct numerical integration of equations of motion is also presented. Overall, the high-order analytic expansion of the doubly averaged disturbing function yields a result that agrees well with the numerical quadrature and with the numerical integration. Local extremums of the doubly averaged disturbing function are quantitatively reproduced by the high-order analytic expansion even when Î± is large. Although the analytic expansion is not applicable in some circumstances such as when orbits of perturbed and perturbing bodies cross or when strong mean motion resonance is at work, our expansion result will be useful for analytically understanding the long-term dynamical behavior of perturbed bodies in circular "
