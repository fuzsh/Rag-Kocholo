This number appears on all of Taking Back Sunday’s albums and is, according to some guy on Reddit, a reference to a highway exit near the North Carolina home of singer/guitarist Adam Lazzara. But then other Redditors were like, that’s not true, and … I stopped skimming after that. None of which should distract you from the band’s true origins in Amityville, Long Island, New York, where that crazy haunted house was or is? And does this mean Taking Back Sunday is themselves haunted? Yes.
