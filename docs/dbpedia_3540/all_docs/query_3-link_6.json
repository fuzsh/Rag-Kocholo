Written by Scott Rosenberg and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the film centers on a prison break aboard a JPATS aircraft, nicknamed as \"Con Air\". It features an ensemble supporting cast of Steve Buscemi, Ving Rhames, Colm Meaney, Mykelti Williamson and Rachel Ticotin.\n\nCon Air was released theatrically on June 6, 1997 by Buena Vista Pictures through Touchstone Pictures and was a box office success, grossing over $224 million against a production budget of $75 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics with praise for its acting, musical score and action sequences. The film achieved a cult following among the Nicolas Cage fanbase.[2][3][4][5][6] It received Oscar nominations for Best Sound and Best Original Song for \"How Do I Live\", performed on the soundtrack by Trisha Yearwood.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nHonorably discharged Army Ranger Cameron Poe returns home from Desert Storm to his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, and reunites with his pregnant wife Tricia. That night, three intoxicated men assault Poe, who ends up being given a seven to ten-year prison sentence for accidentally killing one of them in self-defense. Eight years later, Poe is paroled and boards a flight to Alabama on the Jailbird, a converted JPATS prison transport plane. Accompanying Poe is his diabetic cellmate and best friend Mike \"Baby-O\" O'Dell.\n\nMost of the inmates boarding the flight are high-risk convicts being transferred to a supermax prison, including mass murderer William \"Billy Bedlam\" Bedford, serial rapist John \"Johnny 23\" Baca, Black Guerrilla former general Nathan \"Diamond Dog\" Jones, and professional criminal Cyrus \"The Virus\" Grissom. The flight is overseen by U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin. DEA agent Willie Sims plans to go on an undercover mission to get information from drug kingpin Francisco Cindino, who is being picked up en-route.\n\nAfter taking off, inmate Joe \"Pinball\" Parker sets another prisoner on fire using smuggled kerosene as a distraction, allowing Grissom and Diamond Dog to take over the plane. They plan to land at Carson Airport as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners and fly to a non-extradition country. Sims tries to retake control, but Grissom kills him and takes his gun.\n\nThe plane arrives at Carson City and the inmates exchange commences. The ground crew is unaware that hijackers are disguised as guards and the real guards are forcibly disguised as inmates, gagged to prevent them from revealing the scheme. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, pilot Earl \"Swamp Thing\" Williams and serial killer Garland Greene. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom's old cell and a tape recorder planted by Poe on one of the disguised guards but cannot prevent the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball disposes of the plane's transponder, but dies trying to reboard during takeoff.\n\nThe inmates agree to land at Lerner Airfield, a desert airstrip, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his cartel. Poe finds Pinball's corpse trapped in the landing gear and writes a message to Larkin on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads to Lerner after contacting the National Guard. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe's identity when reading his parole letter and finding the stuffed rabbit Poe intends to give to his daughter Casey, forcing Poe to kill him.\n\nThe Jailbird is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the others of Cindino's past acts of deceit and betrayal; Grissom orders the others to fuel up the plane and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O a syringe to give him insulin, meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. They discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden private jet, which Larkin sabotages by lowering a crane arm onto it. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the plane's fuel. Johnny 23 spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates find shotguns and rifles in the cargo hold and prepare an ambush. As the National Guard arrives, the inmates launch an assault, resulting in various casualties, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a bulldozer as a makeshift shield, while the surviving inmates return to the Jailbird and take flight.\n\nPoe's identity is revealed when Bedford's body is found. Baby-O takes the blame and is shot by Grissom, when Larkin and Sims' partner, Duncan Malloy, arrive in attack helicopters, damaging the Jailbird's fuel tank. Poe takes command of the cockpit, and Larkin instructs him to have the plane land at McCarran International Airport, but Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the Las Vegas Strip, causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Grissom, Diamond Dog and Swamp Thing escape on a fire truck, pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles; the chase results in the deaths of all three escapees. Poe reunites with his family, meeting Casey for the first time and giving her the bunny. As the surviving inmates are apprehended, the only one unaccounted for, Greene is gambling in a casino.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nNicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a paroled former Army Ranger who works with the authorities to retake the titular flight.\n\nJohn Cusack as U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin, a U.S. Marshal who discovers Poe's role in retaking the plane.\n\nJohn Malkovich as Cyrus \"The Virus\" Grissom, a highly-intelligent career criminal and mastermind of the escape plot.\n\nSteve Buscemi as Garland \"The Marietta Mangler\" Greene, a notorious serial killer.

John Cusack's brother Bill Cusack appears as a Las Vegas EMT.\n\nMalkovich was considered early for the role of Grissom. Jason Isaacs, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe and Tom Sizemore auditioned for the role. Bruce Willis turned down the role.[7][8]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nWith second unit work beginning on June 24, 1996, principal photography began shortly after in Salt Lake City, on July 1, 1996 and continued until October 29, 1996, at a number of locations.[9] While most of the interiors of the Fairchild C-123 Provider transport aircraft were filmed in Hollywood Center Studios soundstage #7, Wendover Airport in Utah, as the stand in for the fictional Lerner Airfield, was used for the C-123 flying and taxi scenes.[10] Director Simon West chose the barren and remote Wendover area \"because it looked like the surface of the moon ... My idea was that it was perfect for the convicts who had been locked up for 10, 20, 30 years in little cells.\"[11] The old wartime bomber base was also used for the aircraft boneyard scenes while the original swimming pool at the base was used in a scene where Garland Greene was talking to a young girl.[12]\n\nOn August 29, 1996, Phillip Swartz, a welder employed by Special Effects Unlimited, a Los Angeles-based firm, was crushed to death at Wendover when a static model of the C-123 used in the film fell on him. The film credits end with \"In Memory of Phil Swartz\".[13]\n\nOther filming locations included Ogden Airport where the exchange of prisoners is seen. The scene where the aircraft's left wing hits the Fender Stratocaster sign of Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (which later played host to the film's premiere), was filmed using a replicated guitar sign and a Jailbird miniature model. The crash site was filmed in the Sands Hotel before its demolition on November 26, 1996.[14] Producer Jerry Bruckheimer found the right spot for the climactic finale, originally planned for a crash at the White House, but Las Vegas was more in keeping with the theme and visual pun of convicts \"cashing in\". \"We got very lucky ... The Sands was going to be demolished anyway. They blew up the tower on their own. We arranged to blow up the front of the building.\" The 2nd Street Tunnel in Los Angeles was also used for the tunnel chase scene near the end of the film.[11]\n\nThree C-123's were used during production and were painted with the Jailbird livery. The actual flying C-123 model used during flight scenes in the film had a series of both military and private owners. In December 2003 it was sold to All West Freight Inc. in Delta Junction, Alaska.[15] On August 1, 2010, the C-123 was destroyed when it crashed into Mount Healy within Denali National Park in Alaska.[16] The three member flight crew was killed in the crash.[17][18][19] Another C-123, formerly registered as N94DT, was used for the crash scene in Las Vegas and then scrapped following production. The third Jailbird movie model used for the taxi scenes was later donated by the filmmakers to the Historic Wendover Airfield Foundation, where it remains on display at the ramp as an attraction for visitors.[12]\n\nThe film used several highly detailed models at 1/15th scale, and a multitude of military and private aircraft assembled for the desert boneyard scene.[Note 1]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nCon Air: Music from the Motion PictureSoundtrack album by ReleasedJune 17, 1997GenreSoundtrackLength44:19LabelHollywood RecordsProducerPaul Linford, Mark Mancina, Trevor Rabin\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[21]\n\nThe film featured the Diane Warren-penned LeAnn Rimes hit single \"How Do I Live\", performed by Trisha Yearwood for the film.[22][Note 2]\n\nThe Con Air soundtrack album omits two songs featured in the film: \"How Do I Live\", written by Diane Warren and performed by Trisha Yearwood and \"Sweet Home Alabama\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Although a key element of the film, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle noted, \"The soundtrack kicks into loud, obtrusive gear ... (and) remains so loud throughout the picture that it practically functions as a distancing device.\"[23]\n\n\"Con Air Theme\" – 1:34\n\n\"Trisha\" – 1:04\n\n\"Carson City\" – 3:05\n\n\"Lear Crash\" – 4:44\n\n\"Lerner Landing\" – 3:28\n\n\"Romantic Chaos\" – 1:23\n\n\"The Takeover\" – 3:52\n\n\"The Discharge\" – 1:09\n\n\"Jailbirds\" – 0:59\n\n\"Cons Check Out Lerner\" – 1:56\n\n\"Poe Saves Cops\" – 2:25\n\n\"The Fight\" – 0:23\n\n\"Battle In The Boneyard\" – 7:41\n\n\"Poe Meets Larkin\" – 1:16\n\n\"Bedlam Larkin\" – :49\n\n\"Fire Truck Chase\" – 4:22\n\n\"Overture\" – 4:19\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nCon Air opened June 6, 1997 on 2,824 screens in the United States and Canada and grossed $24.1 million in its opening weekend, topping the US box office above The Lost World: Jurassic Park.[24] For its second weekend, the film dropped into second place behind Speed 2: Cruise Control, but still made $15.7 million.[25] It also opened in the UK, Hong Kong, Israel and parts of Latin America including Brazil and Mexico grossing $5 million for the weekend, for a total worldwide opening of $29 million.[26] In the US and Canada, it grossed $15.7 million in its second weekend and $10.4 million in its third, finishing second and third, respectively.[27]\n\nThe film grossed $101.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $122.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $224 million.[1]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 58% of 71 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Con Air won't win any awards for believability – and all involved seem cheerfully aware of it, making some of this blockbuster action outing's biggest flaws fairly easy to forgive.\"[28] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[29] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[30]\n\nRoger Ebert, reviewing the film for the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded it three out of four stars, saying it \"moves smoothly and with visual style and verbal wit.\"[31] Janet Maslin, reviewer for The New York Times considered Con Air an exemplar of the \"thrill ride genre\".[32] In contrast, Rolling Stone reviewer Peter Travers decried the \"flip, hip\" and ultimately, \"depressing ... pandering\" present in the treatment.[33]\n\nAndrew Johnston, reviewer for Time Out New York, stated: \"Leaving The Rock last summer, I thought it seemed physically impossible for a more over-the-top action movie to be made. That was pretty short-sighted of me, since it was only a matter of time until producer Jerry Bruckheimer topped himself as he does with the wildly entertaining Con Air.\"[34]\n\nMaxim put the film's climactic Las Vegas plane crash at the top of their 2007 list of \"The Top Ten Most Horrific Movie Plane Crashes\", a decision that was derided by Wired.[35]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Academy Awards[36] Best Original Song \"How Do I Live\"\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Diane Warren Nominated Best Sound Kevin O'Connell, Greg P.
