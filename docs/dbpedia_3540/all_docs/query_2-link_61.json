Yes, this is the best new writing currently on the London stage.\"\n\nAleks Sierz - The Arts Desk\n\n​\n\n\"... and over the course of their relationship each remembered moment seems to glow with its own colour in Neil Austin’s lighting. Sometimes the space feels infinite, sometimes shallow and empty: it’s beautifully managed.\"\n\nFrey Kwa Hawking - Whatsonstage.com\n\n​\n\n\"There’s no faulting an A-list creative team that includes Neil Austin, whose overhead lighting posits a flickering constellation all its own. \"\n\nMatt Wolf - LondonTheatre.co.uk\n\n​\n\n\"Neil Austin’s stunning lighting illuminates the stage. The lighting is visually striking as we walk into the theatre and throughout the show, these lights effectively capture the shifting timelines in the story. The bold hues of greens and reds during Des and Dre’s youthful years, become dimmer as we move to present-day.\"\n\nRachel Agyefron - RachelReviewed.co.uk\n\n​\n\n\"\"Shifters’ lighting design is one of the best I’ve seen from a theatre production. Rosmersholm’s Neil Austin echoes the blue and orange costume design (complementary colours, I should point out) of Alex Berry with a beautiful warmth, intensifying and switching off with the highs and lows of an emotional relationship (involving panic attacks, parties and goodbyes); the jagged tube lights alluding to crossed paths, and the otherworldly and existential ideas explored in a script by Benedict Lombe\n\nLiam O'Dell - LiamODell.com\n\n​\n\n\"The other element which did give me a degree of pleasure was the lighting design of Neil Austin. He has used fluorescent tubes artfully and artistically, enclosing the playing area and using them to mark the shifting passages of time. He has also employed a variety of colours to suggest the relevant moods of the different sections enhancing the work of the actors as their emotions change. \"\n\nJohn Chapman - 2nd From Bottom\n\n​\n\n\"Set designer Alex Berry and lighting designer Neil Austin work in tandem to create a bare but atmospheric staging - the stage is framed on all sides by tubes of light which extinguish and later reignite in powerful moments of dramatic change, and add an almost dreamlike quality to the non-liner, time-jumping structure.\"\n\nSam Waite - AllThat Dazzles.co.uk\n\n​\n\n\" Neil Austin’s lighting sharply illuminates the traverse stage while handling intimate moments with ease.\"\n\nLouise Penn - LouReviews.blog\n\n​\n\n\"\"Neil Austin’s lighting design was beautifully subtle yet highly effective. Beams of ominous blue hung from either side of the stage and outlined the space. From cool blues and warm yellows to bright reds and greens, Austin’s lighting undistractedly distinguishes the pivoting scenes and reflects the continuously changing emotion. As friction develops between Dre and Des, the beams of light fade, leaving the stage in almost darkness.\n\nZoe - TheatreAndTonic.co.uk\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​The Enfield Haunting\n\nAmbassador's Theatre - West End\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"But the kindest thing would be to cut the power to the theatre altogether, and allow the company to rest in peace.\"\n\nPatrick Marmion - The Daily Mail\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe Secret Life of Bees\n\nAlmeida Theatre - London\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"The production is drenched in dewy rays of light (design by Neil Austin) for the duration, conjuring an otherworldliness that bears shades of Toni Morrison’s magical realism.\"\n\nArifa Akbar - The Guardian\n\n​\n\n\"The set designer Soutra Gilmour gives us the bare frame of a barn or house, drenched in Neil Austin's evocative golden lighting.\"\n\nClive Barnes - The Times\n\n​\n\n\"Bathed in the ochre glow of Neil Austin's lighting, the stage is suffused with heat and sunshine throughout the performance.\"\n\nNeil Norman - Daily Express\n\n​\n\n\"...

The opening scenes where the inseparable young princesses Elsa and Anna (charming Tilly-Raye Bayer and lively Asande Masike) are torn apart by Elsa's magical powers are fluidly and energetically staged, with warm yellow lights bathing a medieval palace, with high windows, massive doors and painted wood-panelled walls sliding in and out of place.\"\n\nSarah Crompton - Whatsonstage\n\n​\n\n\"Yet Austin's wonderfully inventive lighting, and the simple tricks of curtains covered with crystals, does make the new ice palace the most magical place.\"\n\nSarah Crompton - Whatsonstage\n\n​\n\n\"There are nimbly executed freezing effects when Elsa unwittingly casts her spell and then, at the end, the landscape melts back to warm colours.

He can make light seem as solid as a wall, so that when actors’ bodies walk through it, it’s as if they’re piercing and shattering glass. It’s light that, throughout the show, elevates the characters of “Cursed Child,” so that their flaws and foibles, their crushes and fears, their desires and aversions, seem like the feelings and qualities of Greek gods.\"\n\nLily Janiak - San Francisco Chronicle\n\n​\n\n\"It's a veritable showcase of modern stage trickery, lighting design, and a bunch of old-fashioned stagecraft that dates back well into the last century but still holds the power to awe and delight......It's hard to overstate how jaw-dropping some of the special effects are in the show — none of which feel wedged in or unnecessary — and it's no wonder that the play took home six Tony Awards including Best Play last year.\"\n\nJay Barmann - SFist.com\n\n​\n\n\"With an excellent creative and production team (lighting by Neil Austin and illusions by Jamie Harrison are especially notable)\"\n\nLeslie Katz - San Francisco Examiner\n\n​\n\n\"Undoubtedly, the set and lighting design and special effects are also stars in Harry Potter. In fact, I don’t think you could’ve pulled off a show like this without the incredible efforts of Christine Jones (set), Neil Austin (lighting), and Jamie Harrison (magic and illusions)..... Clever light and shadow manipulations conceal and reveal.... At one point, it looks like Scorpius and Albus Potter are swimming in a massive aquarium in the theater, a trick that uses light.... In the last scene of the show, golden light pours through the ceiling of the theater, illuminating the stage’s wooden arches and bringing the play to a peaceful end. \"\n\nGrace Li - SF Weekly\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nTranslations\n\nNational Theatre - Olivier\n\n​\n\n​\n\n\"The audience enters the Olivier to witness a landscape on which the low-lying clouds and reddish sky create a sense that everything is about to go up in smoke.

Rae Smith’s magnificent set, gorgeously lit by Neil Austin, perfectly captures the faded grandeur of the Rosmer residence, a ghosted home with flaking paintwork and shrouded family portraits on its walls.

Christopher Oram’s set is every bit the archetypal artist’s studio from late-50s NYC, while Adam Cork’s sound grounds the action. But it is Neil Austin’s lighting that does the most here. He crafts great, deep pools of smooth red velvet in which you lose yourself. It’s awesome.\"\n\nJ.N. Benjamin - Exuent Magazine\n\n​\n\n\"Neil Austin's lighting design is equally wonderful, especially as the lighting changes the way in which the audience sees the paintings themselves. Lighting is a frequent topic of conversation in the play as Rothko is very particular about the level of light that his paints and made and shown in, forcing the audience to pay more attention to the lighting of the play itself.\"\n\nNicole Ackman - Broadway World\n\n​\n\n\"Ingenious lighting design from Neil Austin is shown to full effect when strip lighting is suddenly flicked on, transforming the set into a space resembling an abattoir.

Davies - BritishTheatre.com\n\n​\n\n\"It is dominated by the overbearing, majestic, mysteriously edgeless, tragic and challengine reds and blacks of his Seagram- project canvases.

In one short scene the importance of the lighting is effectively demonstrated when the stage lights are replaced with harsh neon strips.\"\n\nGreg Stewart - Theatre Weekly\n\n​\n\n\"This is a handsome and at times mesmerising production. Thanks to a wonderful set design by Christopher Oram and lighting by Neil Austin, the huge art works on display become secondary characters in their own right.\n\nAll red and black, they glow, pulsate and radiate an energy and we can understand why Rothko treated them as his children. \"\n\nMatthew Hyde - Attitude\n\n​\n\n\"Christopher Oram once again designs an impressive setting of the artist's windowless studio full of detailed painting paraphernalia and together with the lighting designer Neil Austin, creates the few truly dramatic insightful moments of the play. When the bank of fluorescent lights are switched on we see clearly the dramatic effect on how we view his art which becomes dull and flat losing its vivid pulsating impact in the glare of general lighting.\"\n\nNick Wayne - Pocketsize Theatre\n\n​\n\n\"And, stacked against the walls, several enormous Rothko replicas—vast squares of ruby, magenta, ochre, vermillion, scarlet. A million shades of red. They’re not the real thing, but they’ve still got a palpable resonance. “They ebb and flow and shift, gently pulsating,” remarks Rothko.
