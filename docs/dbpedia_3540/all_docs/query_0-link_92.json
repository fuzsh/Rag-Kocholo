        "text": "Series One\n\nFlynn, Barry and Adil (A-Rab) fly out to a summer camp in California hoping for two months of sun, booze, and gorgeous horny women. But their dream turns into what seems to be a nightmare when they're appointed to look after a cabin full of social misfits. Generally known as the 'Chunk Bunk' their cabin is terrorized by the jock cabin[clarification needed]. Flynn's mission is to sleep with every woman that he can without getting caught, A-Rab wants to get over the girl of his dreams, and Barry just wants to meet a girl. Unbeknownst to A-Rab and Barry, Flynn is actually in America because he has Motor Neurone Disease (the same disease that affected Stephen Hawking) and is aware that he may not have long to live.\n\nBy the end of the series, A-Rab has successfully left his ex-girlfriend in the past, and instead fallen for Rachael, the camp's guidance counsellor, but is let down regardless after discovering that she sympathetically slept with Flynn after he confessed his condition to her. Kimberley leaves Jake in Barry's favour, and has sex with him during the last night at the camp. Flynn contemplates suicide when he realises that he has betrayed A-Rab, and because he is afraid of how far his condition will take him, but ultimately chooses to face up to his future, and reconciles with A-Rab (after accepting a punch in the face).\n\nSeries Two\n\nThe trio return to Beaver Falls, hoping for another relaxed summer as Flynn's time ticks by, having now lost the use of his right arm to his condition. Flynn begins to fall for PJ, the camp-owners' daughter, Barry is thrilled to find that Kimberley is looking for a full relationship with him as long as he is in the country, and A-Rab attempts to reconcile with Rachael, only to learn that she is now married to the bumbling but well-meaning Mac. A rift is formed between the trio when A-Rab challenges Barry over his unreliable nature after Barry drunkenly rats A-Rab out to the police in the wake of a petty crime, and A-Rab instead comes to rely on Hope, a lively and cheerful – but completely untrustworthy – girl who only worsens the matter when she reveals Flynn's condition to the entire camp.\n\nBy the end of the series, Barry has learned to take more responsibility for his actions after he was mistakenly led to believe that Kimberley was pregnant. However, Jake, despite initially returning to the camp with a considerably more benevolent outlook on life, ultimately attempts to steal Kimberley back from Barry; though she rejects Jake, Barry chooses to stay as just a friend to her when he realises that she isn't ready for a serious commitment. Mac comes out as gay after a deep conversation with Barry, leading A-Rab and Rachael to reconcile; although this at first provokes a psychotic rampage from Hope, who has become obsessed with A-Rab, she eventually calms down when she realises that A-Rab has no interest in her, but, continues to try and ensure Beaver Falls is closed down. Flynn and PJ fall in love and impulsively decide to marry at the camp, with Flynn vowing to stay in America with her rather than return to Britain, and although the wedding is abruptly halted when Flynn confesses that he had slept with her mother the year before, the couple are ultimately married.\n\nThe show ends with Flynn and PJ driving off as the newly married couple. Barry, A-Rab, Rachel, Mac, and Kimberly swim in the lake – Mac decides to return to England with Barry and A-Rab – while Barry suggests they crash Flynn's honeymoon."
