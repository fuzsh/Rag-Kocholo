        "text": "This home improvement show isn’t like anything you’ll see on HGTV.\n\n“The Curse,” a genre-defying series starring Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder, will premiere on Nov. 10 via Paramount+ with Showtime ahead of its on-air Showtime debut on Nov. 12, the network announced Tuesday. Showtime has debuted a series of first-look images, giving audiences a sneak peek at the perplexing renovation story to come.\n\n“The Curse” stars Stone as Whitney and Fielder as Asher, a husband and wife duo who have just landed their own house-flipping series. Benny Safdie also stars as Dougie, the producer of Whitney and Asher’s “Flipanthropy” show, who is holding onto secrets of his own. Living in Española, N.M., the couple embarks on their new business venture while trying to have a baby, seemingly met by an alleged curse that promises to “disturb the relationship.”\n\nAcademy Award winner Stone recently starred in Yorgos Lanthimos’s “Poor Things,” which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Fielder, too, created and starred in the docu-comedy “The Rehearsal.” Safdie joins the series after recently portraying Edward Teller in Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” this summer.\n\nAlongside Stone, Fielder and Safdie, Academy Award nominee Barkhad Abdi, Emmy nominee Corbin Bernsen and Constance Shulman are set to star in “The Curse.”\n\nThe first three episodes of the series will debut at the New York Film Festival, that is set to run from Sept. 29 to Oct. 15. “The Curse” is a co-production of Showtime and A24. Fielder and Safdie are co-creators and executive producers of “The Curse” through their Elara banner. Fielder, too, serves as a director while Stone executive produces with Dave McCary and Ali Herting.\n\nSee the first-look images below."
