Chambers USA honored him in 2023 and 2024 as one of the media and entertainment industry’s notable Up & Coming lawyers, emphasizing that “he has incredible litigation expertise,” “provides great counsel” and “his attention to detail is amazing.\" In addition, Nathaniel was recognized by the Daily Journal as one of the Top Intellectual Property Lawyers for 2024, by Legal 500 as a Next Generation Partner for Media and Entertainment: Litigation in 2024 and by The Best Lawyers in America as “One to Watch” in Entertainment and Sports Law from 2021-2023.\n\nNat’s broad commercial litigation practice spans copyright, trademark, right of publicity, First Amendment, contract, fashion, brand-protection, telecommunications, class action, intellectual property, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence, metaverse, digital assets, cryptocurrency and blockchain matters. In addition to his trial work, he maintains an active counseling practice, working with clients in pre-litigation and other risk-management matters. He has also represented clients in the financial industry in global regulatory and governmental investigations, and has played key roles in various other high-profile transactions and disputes.\n\nNat maintains an active pro bono practice. He successfully represented Dreamers to obtain a first-in-the-nation injunction blocking the Trump administration’s unlawful revocation of the DACA program. Nat also represented one of the first Dreamers unlawfully targeted by the Trump administration, obtaining (after arguing) an unprecedented preliminary injunction that barred ICE and USCIS from falsely calling his client a gang member. He has partnered with diverse legal services organizations including the ACLU of Southern California, Public Counsel, Bet Tzedek, Lawyers Without Borders and the Equal Justice Initiative."
