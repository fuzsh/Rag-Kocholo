Edward Drinker Cope (1840-1897) was a Philadelphia scientist. He was one of the main paleontologists in the late

1800's Bone Wars. The War started when fellow paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh pointed out that Cope had put a skull on the wrong end of a marine reptile, the Elasmosaurus.

Cope found several dinosaurus (such as Coelophysis and Camarasaurus) and other reptiles (e.g. Elasmosaurus), 56 total. Cope died in 1897 due to a cystitis.
