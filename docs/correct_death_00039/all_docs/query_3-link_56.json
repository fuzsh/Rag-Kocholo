        "text": "Note: This review is by my husband Jim.\n\nDragon Teeth was written by Michael Crichton in the 1970’s, but it was not discovered until after his 2008 death, and not published until 2017.\n\nThis historical fiction novel revolves around real events known as the “Battle of the Bones” or “Bone Wars.” Edward Drinker Cope (University of Pennsylvania) and Othniel Charles Marsh (Yale) were two of the earliest paleontologists to make significant discoveries of dinosaur skeletons in the American West. Their rivalry was bitter, and involved espionage, sabotage, and even physical violence. Much of the story takes place in Montana and the Dakotas in 1876, the year and general location of Custer’s Last Stand. The story is narrated by William Johnson, a fictional wealthy Philadelphian Yale student who goes “out west” on a dinosaur fossil hunt to win a bet with a college rival.\n\nJohnson gets his share of adventures and then some as he sets out with Marsh; is abandoned because of Marsh’s (unfounded) suspicions; joins up with Cope; and encounters Robert Louis Stevenson (briefly), Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Sitting Bull, and a host of colorful fictional characters. The book captures the feel of the Old West, with its lawlessness, conflicts between the Army and Native Americans, and particularly in its portrayal of Deadwood City. Our hero even somewhat realistically enters into a classic confrontational gun fight with an experienced gun fighter, and (with some expert coaching from Wyatt Earp) manages to survive.\n\nThe dragon’s teeth of the title refer to the fossils of the first Brontosaurus skeleton ever discovered. Edward Cope recognizes what they are, and is utterly amazed by the imputed size of the animal that had such dentures. He realizes what a find he has made, and is willing to subject his crew (including Johnson) to severe peril to get those teeth back to an Eastern museum. The trek back to civilization costs several lives, but in the process Willie Johnson matures from a spoiled college kid on a lark to an experienced explorer.\n\nEvaluation: As is true of Crichton’s other books, this one is a good adventure story that makes for fast, entertaining reading.\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nPublished by HarperCollins Publishers, 2017"
