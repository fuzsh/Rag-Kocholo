Each used underhanded methods to try to out-compete the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and destruction of bones. Both used their wealth and influence to finance their own expeditions and to procure services and dinosaur bones from \"fossil hunters\". Cope and Marsh were financially ruined by their attempts to disgrace each other.Their rivalry lasted until Cope's death in 1897. The use of dynamite and sabotage by employees of both men may have destroyed or buried hundreds of critical fossil remains. Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after they died.
