        "text": "We continue our journey with Sterling Hayden as he joins the communist partisans in Yugoslavia! Sterling is getting more and more RED as the days go on. Will this pretty face join the class struggle or will he just jerk it to a boat or something.\n\nWe are coming at you with a new Crappy Colonies episode. This week, the Spanish and French go head-to-head over the Bath Salts capital of the world, Florida\n\nCome listen to Travis learn to read, with a reading of an interesting piece of 1950s ephemera, You Can Have Better Memory 1959\n\nNot only was this man handsome, he smelled like old fish. Sterling Hayden had a bit of a rough start, but his real passion was sailing the seas, that is until Hollywood got a look at him.\n\nWalt from Not For Human Consumption joins us for the conclusion of Lord Minimus. After a life of luxury in the Royal court of Queen Henrietta Maria, Jeffrey's life takes a serious turn for the worse.\n\nWalter from Not for Human Consumption joins us as we travel back to the early 17th century, to look into the interesting life of the world's smallest man, Jeffrey Hudson.\n\nWe are back with another Crappy Colony. This time we are hitting the seas with the French, at there first attempt to settle the New World. Will the land of the Iroquois proof to be their land of gold or will they just find frozen death?\n\nJim and Brian from Drink a Beer Play a Game joins us as we wrap up the confusion that was William Penn's life.\n\nBrian and Jim from Drink a Beer Play a Game join us again as we continue our look into the life of William Penn and the birth of Pennsylvania. William dives into the deep end and acquires a royal charter for Penn's Forest Land. His new 'holy experiment' quickly devolves into madness as he blunders way though governing his new charter, setting up his 'modern city' of Philadelphia\n\nBrian & Jim from Drink a Beer Play a Game joins us for a deep dive into the founder of their state of Pennsylvania, William Penn. As a stinky little rich kid, William Penn bumbles through life, from one old changing event to the next. All until he finds his true calling in the 17th century version of the hippies, Quakers.\n\nWelcome to Pensacola, Florida. Home to a giant neon fish sign, a military base and the site of the second attempt to establish a Spanish Colony on mainland America. If you thought theirfirst attempt was a mess, this time the Spanish learn all about hurricanes and the benefits of eating shoe leather.\n\nJay from Not For Human Consumption joins us on our last ride into the slow decline into Evel Knievel.\n\nJay from Not For Human Consumption joins us again as we take a look at the birth of Evel Knievel as his career launches sky high.\n\nJay from Not for Human Consumption joins us for a roast of a rowdy little boy from Butte, Montana, Bobby Knievel. Long before Bobby would don the name Evel Knievel, he was off kidnapping, robbing pharmacies, starting hockey teams, hunting on federal land and of course jumping over things.\n\nSadly, all great things come to an end. We close up the amazing pitch Rube Waddell. His fall from the top of the mound is not pretty\n\nWe get to second base with Rube Waddell. His drunken antics and showmanship on the diamond are knocking it out of the park, as he goes squares up with rival pitcher Cy Young. Problem is you just have to get him to stay on the field.\n\nThere are some athletes that simply excel in one thing. Their sport. There are other athletes, like Rube WaddeLl, that not only were top of their profession but was an impromptu firefighter, easily distracted by puppies and taught geese how to hopscotch.\n\nWe take a look at the first European colony in North America. This disaster of a Spanish colony was lead by a ex-lawyer turned slaver Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón. And lets just say the pasty european settlers don't have the best time in the swamps of Georgia."
