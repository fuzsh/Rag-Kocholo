        "text": "Othniel Charles Marsh (October 29, 1831 — March 18, 1899)\n\nSon of a farmer, Marsh was always supposed to be digging in the dirt, but not for scientific reasons. But when his mother (the sister of a wealthy baker and philanthropist) died of cholera, his uncle looked upon his nephew with a sense of obligation, and even love.\n\nHis uncle would pay for his education at Andover (one of the most elite and competitive private schools in the world) and for his studies in Germany as well. Later, his uncle would even donate $150,000 to the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale, where Marsh would become one of three original curators. With $100,000 that he would also receive from his uncle, he would uncover, name, and write about the 500 new species he discovered in almost 400 scientific articles that he published.\n\nAmong Marsh’s many discoveries, his findings of Jurassic specimens in 1877 at the Morrison Formation, now known as Dinosaur Ridge, were among his most productive and valuable digs. From Dinosaur Ridge, 230 boxes of bones were sent to Marsh. He also found fossils in Como Bluff, Wyoming (where he filled 480 boxes); Canon City, Colorado (270 boxes); and the Denver Beds of the Lance Formation. The mammal fossils he found at Como Bluff were especially influential in studies of Jurassic mammals.\n\nSome of the most prominent dinosaurs, such as the Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Brontosaurus, Apatosaurus, and Allosaurus were all discovered by Marsh. In addition, he also found the physical proof needed to prove Darwin’s Theory of Evolution by finding fossils of horses in various stages of development. Likewise, his book, Odontornithes: a Monograph on Extinct Birds of North America, explores the discoveries of birds with teeth, linking dinosaurs to birds, and helping to further prove Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.\n\nDespite his many papers, his publication of Dinosaurs of North America and Vertebrate Fossils is considered his best work and exhibits his impressive knowledge of paleontology.\n\nThroughout his life, he also earned many accolades, most notably he was:\n\n- 1882–1892. A serving member of the Vertebrate Paleontologist of the U.S. Geological Survey\n\n- 1883–1895. President of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n- 1886. Elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society\n\n- 1897. A recipient of the Cuvier Prize (1,500 francs) from the French Academy of Science.\n\nIt should also be noted that his professorship at Yale University made him the first professor of paleontology in the United States.\n\nHowever, even though he was incredibly successful in his field, he was not charming. At all. Instead, he is described as a pedantic, ornery man whose favorite hobby was debunking myths and falsehoods. One woman said that getting to know him was like running against a pitchfork. It is very likely though that personal attacks on Marsh’s character are a result of the corrupted rumors circulated by Cope.\n\nEdward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840-April 12, 1897)\n\nContrary to the sour personality of Marsh, Cope was described as charismatic (as charismatic as a paleontologist can be, I guess), sarcastic, and temperamental. When he attended Friends’ though, an expensive and prestigious boarding school, Jane Davidson would recall that he was “a bit of a spoiled brat.” It is also thought that he was disinterested in love, marrying his wife Annie Pim much more for companionship than love. He remarked,\n\n“Her amiability and domestic qualities generally, her capability of taking care of a house, etc., as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of the traits which form the theme of poets!”\n\nTo complete what he saw as a perfect adjunct to his life, she was also his cousin.\n\nCope was born to a wealthy Quaker family. His mother died when he was three — the same age Marsh was when his mother died from cholera — and his father owned a lucrative shipping company.\n\nCope had illegible handwriting that received bad marks throughout his schoolyears. It did not improve as he aged.\n\nMuch like Marsh’s father, Cope’s father intended to groom his son as a farmer — what he saw as a noble profession. Cope thought this prospect was “dreadfully boring” though and resented the idea. However, paleontology was not his initial interest. He thought about working in a field hospital or working to assist freed African Americans. (He would remark later that if “a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like.”)\n\nFor much of the Civil War, Cope was in Europe touring acclaimed museums and studying, just as Marsh. He wrote to his father,\n\n“I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft. I shall not be sorry for this, as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war.”\n\nAlthough, he never actually did return during the war.\n\nIt is thought that Joseph Leidy (a paleontologist) and Ferdinand Hayden (a geologist) who did work as field doctors in the Civil War advised him against the idea of going into the profession.\n\nWhile in Europe, he met Marsh in Berlin. Marsh held two university degrees in comparison to Cope’s lack of formal education past sixteen. Despite this, Cope had written 37 scientific papers while Marsh had only written 2. He would write over 1,400 papers by the end of his life and was nineteen when his first paper was published. Despite his prolific nature, in the 1880s, he would be forced to sell most of his bone collection for needed cash.\n\nThroughout his life, he also earned many accolades, most notably he was:\n\n- 1879. Bigsby Medal.\n\n- 1891. Hayden Memorial Geological Award.\n\nCope’s Rule is a postulation that states species grow larger throughout the evolution process. It is named after Cope because he allegedly favored the idea, although he never explicitly endorsed it.\n\nCope died in 1897, and Charles Sternberg, one of his companions, wrote, “I had lost friends before, and I had known what it was to bury my own dead, even my firstborn son, but I had never sorrowed more deeply than I did over the news.” When he died, Cope donated his body to science solely so he could prove that his brain was bigger than Marsh’s. Marsh did not do the same though, so Cope’s wish was never realized.\n\n3. How Did the Rivalry Begin?\n\nWhen the two met in Berlin of 1863, the two began an amiable relationship. Marsh gave Cope a tour of the city, they stayed together for a few days, and began an intellectual correspondence exchanging fossils and papers. They even named fossils for each other. (Cope named Colosteus marshii for Marsh, and Marsh named Mosasaurus copeanus for Cope).\n\nIt was in 1868, between the gestures, that their relationship began to shift towards a rivalry. Cope had taken Marsh to a quarry he had been scouting for fossils since 1866. Upon leaving, Cope heard Marsh bribing the quarry manager to inform him of any interesting fossils rather than Cope. Cope preceded to accuse Marsh of bribery.\n\nBy this point, the relationship was still relatively friendly. They even continued to observe each other’s work. The subtle tension only erupted into professed hatred when the pedantic and critical Marsh noticed a discrepancy in Cope’s work — he noticed that Cope had placed the head of the Elasmosaurus at the tip of its tail. This led to the animal appearing to have an unusually long neck. Cope panicked and tried to collect every paper that depicted his flawed structure. But Joseph Liedy, another paleontologist, exposed his mistake at the Academy of Natural Sciences.\n\nAfter this great embarrassment the two never reconciled and were enemies for the rest of their lives."
