        "text": "On March 26, 1675, Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg died. Initially, his sons governed the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, as set out in their father’s will. On February 24, 1680, the seven brothers concluded a treaty of separation, with each brother getting a portion of the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha Altenburg and becoming a Duke.\n\nFriedrich I became Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg\n\nAlbrecht became Duke of Saxe-Coburg\n\nBernhard I became Duke of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nHeinrich became Duke of Saxe-Römhild\n\nChristian became Duke of Saxe-Eisenberg\n\nErnst became Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen\n\nJohann Ernst IV became Duke of Saxe-Saalfeld\n\nAlbrecht of Saxe-Coburg and Heinrich of Saxe-Römhild died without male heirs. Upon their deaths, Johann Ernest took possession of Coburg (in 1699) and Römhild (in 1714). In 1699, Johann Ernst became Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.\n\nIn 1825, 145 years after the initial split, the House of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg became extinct and the Duchy of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was split. Saxe-Gotha passed to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld who in turn gave Saalfeld to the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. The Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen received Saxe-Altenburg and gave the district of Hildburghausen to Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nAs a result:\n\nErnst III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld became Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ernst I had two sons: his heir, the future Ernst II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen ceased to exist. Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen became Friedrich, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nBernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meinigen remained Duke of Saxe-Meiningen but had the additional land that encompassed Hildburghausen and also Saalfeld.\n\nThe Duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, and Saxe-Meiningen continued to remain the same until the abolition of the German monarchies after World War I.\n\nThe territory that encompassed the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in now in the German states of Bavaria and Thuringia.\n\nHoly Roman Empire, German Confederation, North German Confederation, and the German Empire Explained\n\nThe Constituent States of the German Empire\n\nGlossary of German Noble and Royal Titles\n\nBelow is an indexed listing with links to biographical articles about the Saxe-Coburg- Saalfeld and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha families at Unofficial Royalty.
