She married Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1736, and bore him nine children, their eldest son, becoming George III. This is a harder copy of the head-and-shoulders of a whole-length by Jean-Baptiste Van Loo in the Royal Collections. It was painted as a pendant to that of her husband, and both were signed and dated 1742. J-B Vanloo came to England from October 1737 to December 1742, and enjoyed considerable success, painting the highest in the land, from Sir Robert Walpole to the Prince and Princess of Wales. He painted relatively little in his last years here because of ill-health, which finally forced him to leave the country.\n\nSummary\n\nOil painting on canvas, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Princess of Wales (1719–1772), after Jean-Baptiste van Loo (Aix-en-Provence 1684 - Aix-en-Provence 1745) Half-length portrait, full front in painted oval surround.
