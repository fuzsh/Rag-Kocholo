        "text": "Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (German: Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha), or Saxe-Coburg-Gotha was an Ernestine, Thuringian duchy ruled by a branch of the House of Wettin. It lasted from 1826 to 1844. In 1826, the death of the Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg resulted in a rearrangement of the Ernestine Duchies. Ernest III of Sade-Coburg-Saalfeld became Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Upon Ernest’s death in 1844, his lands were, according to tradition, divided between his two sons. The oldest, Ernest, received Saxe-Coburg, while the younger, Albert, received Saxe-Gotha. Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg died childless in 1893, but Coburg and Gotha were never reunited, as his younger brother Albert had died over thirty years previously.\n\nNote: Ignore list of Dukes in Infobox."
