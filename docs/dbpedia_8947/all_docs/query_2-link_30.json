        "text": "Son of Frederick III and Luise Dorothea of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, and brother of Ernst II Ludwig.\n\nHe first embarked on a military career, joining the Teutonic Knights in 1764 before going into the service of a Dutch regiment of infantry, but left military service in 1772 to live the rest of his life as a patron of arts of literature. Among his correspondents were Herder, GÃ¶the and Wieland. Described as witty and given to sarcasm."
