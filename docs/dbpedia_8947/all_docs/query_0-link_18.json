It passed (1672) to the dukes of Saxe-Gotha, but from 1826 to 1918 it was again a separate duchy under the collateral line of Saxe-Hildburghausen. In 1920 it was incorporated into Thuringia.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press. All rights reserved."
