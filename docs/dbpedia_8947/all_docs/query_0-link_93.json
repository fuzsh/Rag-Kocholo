I've thought it would be nice to see parts of Germany new to me and that a good way might be to trace the life of Johann Sebastian Bach, the fabulous composer, specifically where he lived. Although I know southern Germany pretty well, and am pretty good along the French border, and into Hesse and the Ruhr, I've never been to the northeast. Germany experts, what think ye? In summary the places I'd like to see are: Born 31 March 1685, Eisenach, Saxe-Eisenach Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg Lüneburg Weimar Arnstadt Lübeck Mühlhausen Halle Köthen\n\nPotsdam -visited Died 28 July 1750, Leipzig Thanks for any comments"
