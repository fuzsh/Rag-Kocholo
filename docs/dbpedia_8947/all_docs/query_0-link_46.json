She was eventually captured and returned to Vienna and placed in a lunatic asylum at the instigation of her husband. Prince Philip was considered one of the most dissolute princes and his drunken and violent behaviour towards his wife led to her attachment to Géza Mattachich. Louise managed to escape in 1904 and fled to France with her lover Géza Mattachich, she obtained her divorce from her husband Philip in 1906 (one source mentions 1907) and lived the rest of life with Géza Mattachich although they never married.

However in 1923 it was reported that Louise who was in financial straits was allowed by her sister Princess Stephanie to spend the rest of her life in the castle of Oraszvar, in Hungary, on condition that she parted from Géza Mattachich which she apparently agreed.\n\nAn interesting article from The New York Times which includes the introduction to a book by Géza Mattachich.\n\nIt was reported that Prince Philip offered a reward of £3,000 in 1904 for the recapture of his wife Louise.\n\nAccording to The New York Times 31 December 1905 Prince Philip was to pay Princess Louise $211,000 a year as alimony plus $1,000,000 by instalments as part of the settlement for their divorce.\n\nA report on the civil marriage of Louise and Philip.\n\nA report following the death of Princess Louise.\n\nA report on the death of Count Mattachich 28.5211 Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 1878 1916 Leopold was shot and then had acid thrown at him by his scorned mistress Camilla Rybika.
