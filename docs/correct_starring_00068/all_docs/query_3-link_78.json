        "text": "Padukone's first screen appearance was in Himesh Reshammiya's music video \"Naam Hai Tera\" in 2005.[10] Padukone made her film debut by playing the titular protagonist in the Kannada film Aishwarya (2006).[11] Her first Hindi film release came the following year with Farah Khan's melodrama Om Shanti Om, in which she played dual roles opposite Shah Rukh Khan.[12] For her performance, she won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut and also received a Best Actress nomination at the same ceremony. Her sole film role in 2008 was as one of Ranbir Kapoor's love interests in Bachna Ae Haseeno.[13]\n\nPadukone's first film release of 2009, the kung fu comedy Chandni Chowk to China opposite Akshay Kumar, proved to be a box office flop.[14][15] However, her next release, Imtiaz Ali's romance Love Aaj Kal grossed 1.2 billion (US$20 million) worldwide,[16] and garnered her a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.[17] Padukone had five film releases in 2010. Her second comedy film in that year, Housefull was a commercial success,[16] though her other four releases (Karthik Calling Karthik, Lafangey Parindey, Break Ke Baad, and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey) that year failed at the box office.[18] The series of poorly received films continued with both her 2011 releases, the drama Aarakshan and the comedy Desi Boyz.[19]"
