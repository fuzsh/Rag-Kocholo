Shah Rukh Khan, her co-star in that and several other films, is in second place. The list is determined by the page views of the 250 million monthly visitors to IMDb worldwide. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Alia Bhatt place third and fourth on the list while the late Irrfan Khan is in fifth position, Aamir Khan in sixth, the late Sushant Singh Rajput in seventh and Salman Khan in eighth.\n\nNotably, most of the stars in the top 20 are from the Hindi-language Bollywood, while the highest placed actors from India’s southern film industries are all women – Samantha Ruth Prabhu at 13, followed by Tamannaah Bhatia at 16 and Nayanthara at 18. The highest placed male actors from the southern industries are Prabhas, Dhanush and Ram Charan, who occupy positions 29-31.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nZee Sets 'Dhadak 2' for November Theatrical Release - Global Bulletin\n\nTaipei Film Festival Sets Competition Selection, Wang Xiaoshuai as Jury Head - Global Bulletin\n\nWill Demi Moore Kick Off an Awards Run, and Which Film Could Win Cannes Palme d'Or?\n\nPadukone, who made her Hollywood debut in 2017 with “xXx: Return of Xander Cage,” said: “IMDb stands as a beacon of credibility, reflecting the true pulse of people’s passion, interests, and preferences.
