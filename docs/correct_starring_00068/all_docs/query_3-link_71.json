He expressed his excitement regarding the first look of the film.\n\nBollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan never misses out on cheering for his co-stars and industry friends.\n\nOn Wednesday, the actor gave a shout-out to Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone-starrer 'Fighter', which is set to hit the theatres in 2024. The movie is helmed by Siddharth Anand of 'War' and 'Pathaan' fame.\n\nWishing the cast and crew good luck, the actor was impressed to see Roshan, Padukone and Anil Kapoor's first look in the movie as Indian Air Force pilots. His tweet read, \"Wow this threesome of Hrithik, Deepika and Anil is looking awesome. All the best Duggu and Sid. Keep winning the fights, both of u… with love.\"\n\nOn Independence Day, the makers of 'Fighter' unveiled a motion poster, featuring the trio, that opens with a runway shot.\n\nIn the trailer, the trio were dressed in pilot uniforms, wearing sunglasses and holding their helmets.\n\nSharing the first look on X (formerly known as Twitter), Roshan wrote, \"#SpiritOfFighter | Vande Mataram! See you in the theatres on the eve of India’s 75th Republic Day. Fighter releases worldwide on 25th January 2024.\"\n\n'Fighter' also stars Karan Singh Grover and Akshay Oberoi in pivotal roles. The aerial action film is scheduled to release in theatres on January 25, 2024. It marks the first on-screen collaboration between Roshan and Padukone.\n\nSiddharth announced the film in 2021. It is the first project under his production house MARFLIX, a banner dedicated to action film-making in India, along with his wife Mamta Anand.\n\nMeanwhile, Siddharth partnered with SRK for the first time for his comeback blockbuster 'Pathaan', which earned more than Rs 1,000 crore at the box-office. The film also starred Deepika Padukone and John Abraham in the lead roles. SRK is busy with director Atlee's action thriller 'Jawan', which will star Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi, Sanya Malhotra and Priyamani, among others.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n4 reasons why MFs are stocking up on CreditAccess Grameen and other microfinance lenders\n\nOnce declared dead, Nifty Next 50 is up 70%.
