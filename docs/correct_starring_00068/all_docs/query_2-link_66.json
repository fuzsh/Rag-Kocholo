        "text": "Ladies and gentleman, today’s topic is Bollywood. So, it’s only right that you leave your brains at the front door before proceeding, because the ‘B’ in Bollywood also stands for brainless. So trust me, if you really want to enjoy what’s coming, you best withdraw yourself from any form of logic.\n\nBut don’t get me wrong, ‘B’ also stands for ‘beautiful’, ‘baroque’, ‘breathtaking’ and not to forget ‘box office smash’. With so many film elements and techniques involved in just one Bollywood film, it comes to no surprise that there are many adjectives that can be used to describe this industry. With its rich history of renowned films, directors and actors, the Bollywood we know today have come a long way as an industry – be in storytelling or cinematography – and has found its way into the global spotlight.\n\nAnd there is no other film that could best represent the complexities and tradition of Bollywood than Om Shanti Om. In the midst of successes like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mohabbatein and Khabi Kushi Khabi Gham, this film stands out as a genius tribute to the world of Indian cinema.\n\nWith the example of films mentioned above, it is no surprise to have Shah Rukh Khan as the main protagonist of the film. With superb (over)acting skills, dashing good looks and thrilling charisma, he has exemplified them seamlessly in the aforementioned movies. His repertoire of films has given him countless roles as the ‘hero’; an archetype that is virtually inevitable in the Bollywood scene. Yet in Om Shanti Om, it is the very same archetype that was put in the centre of mockery as the film poked fun at the hilarity of the stereotype and the industry.\n\nThe film itself is a masterpiece of parodies interwoven into one. Director Farah Khan had a great vision to acknowledge and celebrate Bollywood, by creatively intertwining film scenes from the past through familiar dialogues, narratives and choreography. Throughout the film, a true Bollywood fan could easily recognize the references made to classic Indian films of the 70s and 80s. The film also satires Bollywood’s obsession with the hero-heroine concept, the exaggerated dance choreography and even favoritism at film awards (in the film, Shah Rukh Khan’s character was nominated for two awards for playing the same role).\n\nAs a narrative, the film chose a reincarnated-hero-seeking-revenge route, but still paid homage to Bollywood but mixing up the genres of comedy, drama, thriller and even horror into one. This great feat proved to be a success, for me at least, because where else can you find an entertainingly complex film like this in Hollywood?\n\nPersonally, the scene that stood out for me is undoubtedly the dance number of ‘Deewangi Deewangi’. As someone who grew up watching Bollywood films during the weekend while my mother irons the laundry in the living room, this whole sequence was an exciting blend of history and nostalgia. Let me break it down for you:\n\nEveryone knows the impact music brings to a film, but little can appreciate the impact Bollywood music brings to a film. With cinematography that rivals its Hollywood counterparts, amazing choreography and stunning visuals, it is no wonder that Bollywood refuses to stray away from a musical-like narrative. But to continue to honour Indian cinema, Om Shanti Om, raised the bar by inviting close to 30 renowned Indian actors, from both past and present.\n\nIt started with a bang with Rani Mukherjee, and my mind was already blown.\n\nAnd then Queen Kajol shows up? OH COME ON!\n\nAnd how could we not mention the beautiful Karisma Kapoor??\n\nI could go on but you get the idea.\n\nBesides Rani and Kajol, the dance extravaganza included other actors like Priyanka Chopra, Shilpa Shetty, Zayed Khan, Salman Khan, Amrita Arora, Preity Zinta and Saif Ali Khan. #SquadGoals anyone?\n\nAlthough I’ve showered much praises on Om Shanti Om, I do suspect that director Farah Khan was having way too much fun reliving her childhood obsession with Amitabh Bachchan, which led to some parts of the film being severely underdeveloped. Also, with so much focus on exaggerating Bollywood stereotypes, the film fell short in character development and audiences might not be able to have the opportunity to create empathy for the characters.\n\nNevertheless, Om Shanti Om has solidified its presence in the history of Indian cinema and has become the go-to Sunday film for many makciks busy with laundry. With a beautiful mise-en-scene that is inescapable of a Bollywood film, hilarious referencing, and sweet nostalgia, Om Shanti Om reunites Bollywood fans from across the globe, while inviting new members to sit in for the ride."
