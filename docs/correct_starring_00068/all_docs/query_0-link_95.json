        "text": "The film: A funny thing happened when Farah Khan started taking Om Shanti Om to film festivals around the world.\n\nThis was the production that was supposed to finally find Bollywood the cross-over international audience many had predicted would one day fall under its spell. But when Khan hit the red carpets of Europe, there were thousands of fans waiting for him - and they were made up of all nationalities.\n\nThese days, it seems, no one needs any convincing about Bollywood charms.\n\nAnd this is perhaps history's most 'Bollywood' of all productions as it both pays homage to and picks away at everything the industry has to offer.\n\nIt is a film about the Hindi film industry, that features just about everyone who has ever been in that industry (either alive or even - through the wonders of modern technology - those long since passed). It is also one of the most inspired pieces of pure cinematic entertainment to come out in the past decade.\n\nMuch of the power of the film comes from its two stars. Shah Rukh Khan (mobbed everywhere he went while promoting the film) and Deepika Padukone (below) play the romantic leads in a story that has them as budding movie stars denied their passion by death, but then reunited decades later by the ingenious device of reincarnation.\n\nSo the director is able to tap into the excesses of the industry across generations, the over-blown dramatics and sheer staggering size of the productions, the star system and the impact it has on people and, of course, the extraordinary habit everyone seems to have of breaking into song the very second any passion seems to rise.\n\nHe also wisely made the film as accessible as possible to those not familiar with Bollywood films, while catering to the needs of his core audience as well. So it's a little bit of a history lesson for first-timers. And a celebration for those who need no convincing.\n\nWhile there are gentle digs made at the egos involved - and at the decadence - more than anything Om Shanti Om is simply great fun. For those who haven't tasted Bollywood before, you'll soon see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThe extras: If you get in quick, the limited-edition box set comes with a souvenir 'on-set' booklet and a poster of Shah Rukh Khan in all his glory. It's also packed with other treats - including director's commentary, interviews with the two main stars, making-of featurettes looking at both the films and the songs, and a short that follows all the madness as the film's impressive marketing campaign took on (and conquered) the world.\n\nThe verdict: It has not become the biggest Bollywood hit of all time for no reason. Sit back and enjoy."
