        "text": "New Delhi: Shah Rukh Khan has two major releases in 2023. 'Jawan' alongside Nayanthara and 'Pathaan' alongside Deepika Padukone and John Abraham. While 'Pathaan' has already become a blockbuster and one of SRK's biggest films, more is anticipated from the Atlee directorial 'Jawan'. And, why not? Considering Shah Rukh has been experimenting with diverse roles and films in the recent past, hopefully 'Jawan' also works out for him. After all, the romance hero has established himself as a formidable vill-hero, action hero with films like 'Pathaan', 'Don', 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan', and many more.\n\nShah Rukh Khan's last releases( before Pathaan) included films like 'Zero' in 2019 with Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' with Anushka Sharma in 2017. The two films form varied genres and completely different characters did not work for Shah Rukh, even though his performance was appreciated by a section of the audience and the critics.\n\nInterstingly, Shah Rukh's filmography includes four films ending with the letter 'N', all of which did supremely well at the box office in India or abroad or were major critical successes. Now, with 'Jawan' and 'Pathaan', can we make a connection?\n\nLet's take a look at these four films ending with the letter 'N' which proved lucky for Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nKaran Arjun (1995)\n\nThis fantasy action drama in which Salman Khan starred opposite Shah Rukh Khan was directed by Rakesh Roshan. 'Karan Arjun' was about two brothers who seek revenge from their greedy uncle for murdering their father. The film earned $ 20 million at the box office and became the second-highest grossing film of 1995 behind SRK's another film 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge' with Kajol and Amrish Puri.\n\nMy Name Is Khan (2010)\n\nThis family drama directed by Karan Johar in which Shah Rukh Khan starred opposite Kajol was another critical and commercial success. The film was about an autistic Muslim man whose stepson gets killed in an assault for which Kajol( who plays' SRK's wife) blames him. The character then take sit upon himself to meet the US president and absolve himself of the charge. 'My Name Is Khan' earned US$48.86 million, making it the first Indian film to gross over ₹1 billion (US$21.87 million) in overseas markets.\n\nJab Tak Hai Jaan (2012)\n\nDirected by Yash Chopra, 'Jab Tak Hai Jaan' was a romantic drama in which SRK starred alongside Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif. In the film, SRK played a bomb disposal expert whose diary falls in the hands of an aspiring journalist ( Anuskha). Produced under the Yash Raj banner, the film went on to become one of the top-earning films of 2012 and earned US$28 million globally.\n\nDon & Don 2 ( 2006, 2011)\n\nDirected by Farhan Akhtar, 'Don: The Chase Begins' is an action thriller which starred SRK as an anti-hero in the lead. The film was given a contemporary touch and was an organic tribute and adaptation of the Amitabh Bachchan blockbuster 'Don' which was released in the 70s.\n\n'Don' collected Rs. 1.06 billion at the box office against the production and marketing budget of Rs. 400 million and became the fifth highest grossing Hindi film of 2006. 'Don' also won Best Asian Film at the Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival.\n\nMeanwhile, 'Don 2', the sequel of 'Don' was released in 2011, co-produced and directed by Farhan Akhtar. The film starred SRK in the lead alongside Priyanka Chopra.\n\n'Don 2' collected Rs. 203 crores at the box office. At the time of release, 'Don 2' became the 2nd highest-grossing Indian films of 2011.\n\nFan (2016)\n\nThis action-thriller directed by Maneesh Sharma was a highly-anticpated and promoted project that had SRK in dual roles of the star himself and an obsessive fan. 'Fan' opened to positive reviews from critics across the country and interestingly did well in the international markets as compared to its poor performance on the domestic front.\n\nWith such commercially viable films ending with the letter 'N', SRK is returing with two more titles- 'Jawan' and 'Pathaan' both ending with the same letter.\n\nWhile 'Jawan' is being directed by 'Bigil' director Atlee known for making mass-entertainers and 'Pathaan' being helmed by Siddharth Anand whose 'War' starring Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff was a blockbuster, expectation is naturally high.\n\nCan 'Jawan' and 'Pathan' re-open SRK's staggering box office record? Perhaps so. Since SRK is also returning to the silver screen after 2019, fans excitement to see him on screen is another level.\n\n( All box office data has been collated from old reports from trade analysis sites such as Box Office India)"
