        "text": "The creators of Pathaan, the biggest hit of 2023, are getting ready for its follow-up. Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone are reportedly getting back together for Pathaan 2, which will “lay the foundation” for SRK’s upcoming Tiger vs. Pathaan, starring Salman Khan. Aditya Chopra of Yash Raj Films has already locked down the screenplay, according to a source who spoke to Pinkvilla. The story will take place prior to the events of Tiger vs. Pathan.\n\n“Pathaan 2 will predate Tiger vs. Pathaan and will set up the clash of two cinematic legends on the big screen,” the source was quoted as saying. There is no doubt that Shah Rukh Khan’s portrayal of Pathaan has struck a chord with viewers; in fact, there is a persistent demand from them to see more of SRK in the role of the spy. Adi and SRK decided shortly after the film’s January 2023 release to spin off Pathaan as a stand-alone franchise inside the Spy Universe, and the former began brainstorming ideas for the film’s highly anticipated sequel.\n\nThe insider also disclosed that Pathaan 2’s production is expected to begin by year’s end. Pathaan 2 is envisioned as the blockbuster spy movie of the cosmos, laying the groundwork for more significant conflicts down the road, according to the insider. It will establish the next chapter in the timeline of YRF Spy Universe. Actually, Pathaan 2 prepares the audience for the major conflict that will occur in a later timeline between Pathaan and Tiger. The Siddharth Anand-directed film Pathaan ended up being one of the most popular productions in YRF’s Spy Universe. It’s unclear, though, if Anand will also be directing Pathaan 2."
