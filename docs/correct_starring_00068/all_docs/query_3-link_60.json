        "text": "Most South Asian people are very familiar with Deepika Padukone and her contribution to the Hindi film industry. It’s been wonderful to see her receive recognition in the West for her phenomenal acting capabilities. From her being featured on the cover of TIME Magazine to announcing a BAFTA award, I take pride in her being one of the most established actresses in the Hindi film industry.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with her work in the Hindi film industry, there was one particular year the cemented her as a high ranking actress. The year was 2013. Let’s take a look at her films that came out that year.\n\nYeh Jawaani Hai Deewani\n\nThis film has become part of the Hindi film canon. As one of the highest grossing Hindi films both domestically (India) and internationally, the film resonated deeply with audiences. The premise of the film is that Bunny (Ranbir Kapoor) and Naina (Deepika Padukone) first meet on a trekking trip. She falls in love with him, however never confesses this to him. They reconcile years later at a friend’s wedding and share their feelings for one another. Everything from direction, story, cinematography, and music was perfection. I have to give a special mention to the music, as the songs stand the test of time in popularity.\n\nGoliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela\n\nI think I have a special appreciation for this film due to the Gujarati representation. The outfits, sets, dialogue and cinematography captured Gujarati culture so well. Nothing less is expected considering Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s acute attention to detail. Just like Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, this film was both a commercial and critical success. The story is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. The film’s lasting legacy, almost a decade later, lies in the popular song Nagada Sang Dol. This song continues to be popularized during Navratri.\n\nChennai Express\n\nUnlike the previous films, Chennai Express is not backed with high critical praise. Despite this, the film turned out to be a high grosser at the box office. The film radiates charm due to Shah Rukh Khan’s star power. Their pairing was the main draw for audiences, especially since Deepika started her Hindi film career with SRK in Om Shanti Om (another big success). This film is packed with action and romance, an overall comfort watch. The songs were also very popular upon release.\n\nRace 2\n\nAs part of a film franchise, Race 2 was a high grossing film. Again, very poor critical reviews. However, Race 2 managed to entice audiences with good action and a good soundtrack. Though not as memorable as the others mentioned in this list, this film helped compound Deepika’s success for the year.\n\nFour films that had high commercial success made Deepika a bankable actress in the industry. The critically acclaimed films displayed her impeccable acting range as well. I’m excited to follow along her journey in both the East and the West as she continues to make waves.\n\nLet me know if you would like to see other actor/actress profiles!"
