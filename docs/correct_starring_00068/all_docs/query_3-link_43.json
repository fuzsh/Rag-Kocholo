        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJust like the 'Terminator', Pathaan' too has kept his promise to be back in action! After the historic success of the 2023 film, King Khan has signed the dotted line for a sequel. As per reports, 'Pathaan 2' promises to be bigger, grander and more glorious than ever!\n\nRAW agent Pathaan is back on a new mission! Shah Rukh Khan has reportedly signed the dotted line for a sequel to the 2023 blockbuster ‘Pathaan’.\n\n‘Pathaan’ ended on a promising note, with a hint that King Khan will be back as the suave spy and lead a new team of agents to protect the country from terrorism. It looks like the makers are ready to deliver that promise!\n\nSRK Back In Action\n\nAccording to a Pinkvilla report, the stage has been prepared for ‘Pathaan 2’. Following the stupendous success of the 2023 espionage thriller, producer Aditya Chopra has decided to turn ‘Pathaan’ into a standalone franchise within the YRF (Yash Raj Films) Spy Universe!\n\n“Pathaan 2 will predate Tiger vs Pathaan and will set up the clash of two cinematic legends on the big screen. Shah Rukh Khan as Pathaan is definitely a character that has resonated with the audiences, and there is a constant on-ground demand from the audience to see more of SRK in the spy avatar…” told a source to the entertainment portal.\n\n‘Pathaan 2’ Will Be The 8th Film In Spy Universe\n\nJust like ‘Pathaan’, the sequel too will be a tentpole project that may set the ground for a big showdown between two of the biggest protagonists of the YRF Spy Universe - Pathaan and Tiger (played by Salman Khan). Incidentally, Salman made a special appearance in ‘Pathaan’.\n\nThe film will go on the floors in December 2024.\n\nReleased in January 2023, ‘Pathaan’ went on to become the highest-grossing movie in the YRF Spy franchise. It earned over Rs 540 crore in India and crossed Rs 1000 crore overseas. The high-octane action drama also marked Khan’s return to the silver screen after a five-year hiatus. The movie also proved to be a blessing for Bollywood as it emerged to be its first blockbuster in 2023, signaling an end to the box-office dry spell.\n\nApart from Khan, the movie also starred Deepika Padukone and John Abraham in key roles.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy leading doctors and scientists pin hope on green jackfruit to fight fatty liver and cancer\n\nYoungsters are roaming around derivatives fire.
