        "text": "OM SHANTI OM pokes fun at the Bollywood masala formula and is at times quite entertaining, but overall it gets carried away by the same shortcomings and was never able to win me over completely.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Jul 7, 2022\n\nThe idea of watching a massively-promoted Diwali release is to come out of the theatre feeling entertained. And for just that alone, Om Shanti Om definitely scores.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | May 1, 2015\n\nAre we complaining? Not really, because the film's meant to be mad, mindless and zany. And we are meant to be happy, headless and nostalgic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | May 1, 2015\n\nOf the cast, Arjun Rampal is consistently first-rate as the suave villain. And Deepika Padukone is fantastic, so surprisingly assured that you marvel at her poised debut.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 1, 2015\n\nThe film lacks creativity in the second half, failing to bring its reincarnation tale to a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nFull Review | May 1, 2015\n\nIt's entertaining in the way that a good musical comedy, whether it's Singing in the Rain, or Hairspray, is entertaining. Full of color, energy, and unpretentious confidence.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | May 1, 2015\n\nAt almost three hours long the film drags a bit, but you'll have more fun at Om Shanti Om than most of the Hollywood movies released today. Watching it, you can't help but smile.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 1, 2015\n\nOm Shanti Om is a light-hearted tribute to Hindi cinema the way we know it and love it, in spite of its flaws, improvisation and implausibility.\n\nFull Review | May 1, 2015\n\nOnce you decide to suspend all belief in logic from the preposterous proceedings, there is much to enjoy in this witty and inventive camp entertainer.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Nov 24, 2007\n\nIf you like Bollywood for essentially what it is, you'll love this. If you don't like Bollywood, this may answer a lot of questions, and likely leave you with a smirk on your face regardless.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Nov 24, 2007"
