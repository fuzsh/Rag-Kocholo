        "text": "In the Bollywood buffet, there’s something for everyone – 202 Hindi films were released in 2018 alone.\n\nTechnology, corporatisation and lavish production have changed the game. Big budget films, multimillion-dollar deals are not uncommon as Warner Bros, Walt Disney Pictures, Fox Star Studio and SONY have divisions in Mumbai (capital of the entertainment industry in India), not to forget the recent arrival of Netflix and HBO India, each producing content with leading stars and creating new ones.\n\nToted as the largest film industry in the world, India has a population of 1.3 billion with only a handful of actors who make it, despite the copious number of Hindi film releases (we aren’t even including regional films that raise the tally to about 1,000 Indian films each year).\n\nPecuniary film producers are waging their bets on younger stars, often second generation actors, as the establishment is greying. Established stars come in with hefty, non-negotiable price tags and back end deals, cutting the profits of production houses (with no refunds when the movies tank). Hope is strutting in from these social media savvy youngsters. They’re mostly 20-something, have a staggering number of followers online, have lucrative deals (from cosmetics to cola) and the wherewithal to have an entourage that includes managers, agents, personal trainers, stylists and a coterie of assistants to keep their fan base satiated on their every move, meal and make-up deal.\n\nHere are 10 young Bollywood stars who have piqued interest and gained a massive Instagram following:\n\n1. Ayushmann Khurrana, 34 years old, 6.4 million followers\n\nA former VJ and emcee who slipped into Bollywood via small, independent Hindi films, Ayushmann Khurrana is the underdog who reigns supreme with the thinking classes. His movies more often than not have clever plot lines (Andhadhun, The Blind Melody – a film replete with questionable characters as a blind pianist witnesses a murder) or shed light on voices from the fringe (Article 15, how the caste system is still rife in India today).\n\n2. Sidharth Malhotra, 34 years old, 8.1 million followers\n\nA former model who strutted into Bollywood in exceptionally good-looking – if not necessarily good – films, no one has accused Sidharth Malhotra of a decent performance in any of his movies. With a strong side hustle as the face of several omnipresent advertisements in India (be it Coca-Cola, New Zealand Tourism or Pepe jeans!), Malhotra’s zoning in on action franchises that require little histrionics and more heroism.\n\n3. Sara Ali Khan, 23 years old, 11.3 million followers\n\nBoth her parents (Amrita Singh and Saif Ali Khan) were major stars in the Hindi film belt and her paternal grandmother is the iconic Indian actress Sharmila Tagore (who famously starred in notable Satyajit Ray films). If ever there was anyone to the manor born, it's young Sara Ali Khan who has already starred in two successful Bollywood films Kedarnath and Simbba – and she’s picked up a Best Newcomer trophy at Filmfare awards (the Indian equivalent of the Oscars). A Columbia University graduate, the young star is elegant, eloquent and mesmerising.\n\n4. Tiger Shroff, 29 years old, 15.6 million followers\n\nBe warned, his social media account is mostly NSFW as Tiger Shroff hasn’t worn a shirt since his debut film Heropanti in 2014. The former martial artist (and gold-card gym member) has acted in … well, he has starred in mostly action films – and several song and dance based movies. Only in Bollywood is an action star expected to break into a little jig with equal ease. Imagine if Rambo did a Singing in the Rain routine. Well, you don’t have to as Shroff already has in The Flying Jat and Munna Michael (a film replete with Michael Jackson posters where he dances like the pop star and beats up the goons in gravity-defying fight sequences).\n\n5. Sonam Kapoor, 34 years old, 20.3 million followers\n\nA red carpet staple at Cannes, the face of L’Oreal and Mont Blanc in India, the excessively fashionable Sonam Kapoor singularly brought Western designers into the Indian vernacular. Despite credible performances in Neerja (based on the true story of the hijacked Pan Am flight 73 in Karachi) and Ek Ladki Ko Dekha (I saw a Girl; mainstream Bollywood’s first film on a lesbian love story), the newly married Kapoor will forever be known for her sartorial selections over her film career options. Unapologetically and perpetually clad in designer gear, she’s also a mainstay in front rows of all the fashion weeks, be it New Delhi or New York.\n\n6. Varun Dhawan, 32 years old, 21.5 million followers\n\nUntil his last outing, Varun Dhawan had the gilded distinction of never having had a film flop at the tills. His first 12 releases were either blockbusters or recovered well over their film production costs making him the safest bet in Bollywood. Then, his 13th release Kalank (The Stain – yes, the irony is not lost on us), a mega-budget pre-partition fiasco was a clunker – and it has him returning to the drawing board. Still, the son of director David Dhawan, has a long roster of films coming up to ensure he rises to the top of the box-office once again.\n\n7. Ranveer Singh, 34 years old, 25.1 million followers\n\nAs actress Priyanka Chopra famously said of Ranveer Singh, “You’re the guy who still doesn’t believe he’s a star, who still tells his mother excitedly whenever someone wants to take his picture!”\n\nWith little connection to films (all the stars mentioned hitherto are second generation celebrities – someone in their family is/was in movies already that helped them get their foothold into Bollywood), Ranveer Singh auditioned several times before landing his first film Band Bajaa Baraat [Wedding Planners] in 2010. In just nine years, he’s won over the box office and carted in a handful of best actor awards.\n\nThe ludicrously dressed celeb (his Instagram is a festival of colours and outrageous fashion designer gear) is gravely serious on screen – and equally and gloriously ridiculous off.\n\n8. Disha Patani, 27 years old, 27 million followers\n\nCricket being the biggest pastime of India – and the only real competition Bollywood has (note the absence of film releases during peak playing season) – a biopic of national sportsman M.S. Dhoni is how Disha Patani debuted in Bollywood.\n\nShe also starred with Jackie Chan in Kung Fu Yoga (yeah, that happened back in 2017 with director Stanley Tong), a film that got a lukewarm reception, but as the hottest face and body of Calvin Klein in India, the stunning starlet has more followers than many established stars put together. She’s only been in films for three years but has a bunch of movies lined up with major stars – including with her rumoured boyfriend Tiger Shroff.\n\n9. Alia Bhatt, 26 years old, 34.7 million followers\n\nAlia Bhatt won the critics award for best actress for the film Highway at the age of 21, and has been on a winning streak ever since, making films that rocked the box-office (2 States, Kapoor and Sons) while picking up a bevy of awards (Udta Punjab [Punjab on a High], Raazi [Willing]) for her other endeavours. Easily the best actress of her generation, Bhatt is the most fascinating chameleon attempting to Meryl Streep her way through Bollywood.\n\n10. Deepika Padukone, 33 years old, 37.2 million followers\n\nAll hail the uncrowned Queen of Bollywood, Deepika Padukone. When iconic Indian director was casting for P admaavat, set in 13th-century India, he locked in the tall and striking star for the title role. The regal and ethereal Padukone has appeared on the cover of several international publications (Vogue, Vanity Fair), featured regularly on red carpets and is a favourite of designers galore (she was invited by Anna Wintour to the Met Gala). She’s signed multimillion dollar deals with watch, jewellery and cola companies, too. it's an exhausting list of achievements for the actress, who also had the most picture-perfect wedding at Lake Como earlier this year with fellow thespian Ranveer Singh.\n\nHonourable mentions:\n\nNotable absentees in the above roster include 34-year-old actor Ranbir Kapoor, who has opted to keep away from social media despite a formidable presence in Bollywood, and Kangana Ranaut – known more for controversies than films.\n\nAs for 36-year-old Priyanka Chopra Jonas, she has 43.1 million followers, and just one film coming up –The Sky is Pink. She has all but emigrated to the US following her marriage to boy band pop star Nick Jonas."
