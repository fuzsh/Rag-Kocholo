Today the actress celebrated 14 years of Om Shanti Om by revisiting one of her favorite songs from the film.\n\nOm Shanti Om is one of the finest films by Farah Khan. The film is genuinely notable, as it brought alive the cinematic beauty of the 70s and 90s. The film was no less than a visual treat for cinema lovers allowing one to travel back to the age-old filmy era.\n\nAfter making a solid mark from her debut film, Deepika went on to deliver some significant hits, including ‘Love Aaj Kal’ (2009), ‘Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani’ (2013), ‘Tamasha’ (2015), ‘Padmaavat’ (2018) and ‘Chhapaak’ (2020). ‘Chhapaak,’ based on the life of Laxmi Agarwal, an acid attack survivor, also marked Deepika’s production debut in Bollywood.\n\nDeepika will be seen sharing screen space with Ananya Panday and Siddhant Chaturvedi in Shakun Batra’s next. She is also a part of ‘The Intern’ remake starring Amitabh Bachchan and will also be seen in ‘Pathan’ opposite Shah Rukh Khan."
