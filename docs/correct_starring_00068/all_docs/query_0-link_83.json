In all the pictures, the common thing was that both were seen gazing at each other affectionately. Along with the picture, he wrote note, that read, \"To 15 fabulous years of excellence… perseverance…amazing performances with you and the warm hugs!! Here’s looking at you…Looking at you. and looking at you…and still looking at you… @deepikapadukone.\"\n\nFor the unversed, Deepika made her debut with the 2007 release Om Shanti Om, which was directed by Farah Khah.
