        "text": "Which is the starriest film ever made? Not the highest-grossing, the most award-winning or even the best-loved, but which film would you bet bragged more A-list actors than any other in the world? Ocean's Eleven? Boogie Nights? Murder on the Orient Express?\n\nRubbernecking at Hollywood paycheques earlier this week, it wasn't surprising to discover the megabucks made from mini-roles in cinema. Six minutes of screen time for $3m? Thank you Julia Roberts! Marlon Brando's many cameos for so many more millions? Only in L.A.\n\nIt does make you wonder why anyone on the west coast ever bothers assembling multi-star casts at all. Imagine the set, say, for one of the Brat Pack movies or a Robert Altman ensemble: directing all those big stars, their bigger competing egos, and their only marginally less big hair. Add a riskily balanced budget and an elaborate script; well, you've got yourself a movie-making nightmare.\n\nTake Terrence Malick. So obviously confused by The Thin Red Line's surfeit of stars, he left Martin Sheen, Gary Oldman, Mickey Rourke, Bill Pullman, Billy Bob Thornton and Viggo Mortensen on the cutting room floor. Faced with that situation, it's easier to understand why a producer would push for a single, big-budget cameo given to the most bankable actor available. It's the headline-making coverage (and subsequent box office), not the fee that will count later on.\n\nThat said, done well, a film starring more than a handful of household names (think Traffic, The Player) is a luxury to watch. It varies though. You've got the distracting (Bobby), the awful (Prêt-à-Porter), and the daftly memorable (A Few Good Men). Then you have the ones that, in retrospect, look like a motorway pile-up of major names. One that still boggles me is JFK. I vaguely remember Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Oldman, Sissy Spacek and at a push, Jack Lemmon. But IMDB tells me I've managed to miss off Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, John Candy, Donald Sutherland and Martin Sheen, too?\n\nPlus, there's always the bargain bins full of films made when their casts were starting out – The Outsiders being the archetypal runner in this category. Brilliant in my sentimental memory, probably terrible watched any time after the age of 14. Starring no less than Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, Sofia Coppola, Tom Waits (Tom Waits?!), Ralph Macchio and um, C Thomas Howell. But, it's one that's discounted from the list of having the starriest cast ever on the grounds of it being made Before They Were Famous.\n\nHonestly then, the film with the highest number of super-famous faces? The answer boasts more than a handful. Way more than a dozen. Hell, it's not even from bloody Hollywood. But, in terms of star power, I'd bank on 2007's Om Shanti Om as the world's most talent-heavy picture. The numbers are bonkers. Forty-two of its army of actors are front-page celebrities across Asia, Indonesia, large pockets of Africa, Europe and north America (the world then). And, in Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Govinda, Rekha, Kajol, Rani Mukherjee et al, at least 20 of them are Bollywood royalty."
