        "text": "Deepika Padukone, who was recently seen in 'Jawan', is receiving love from fans for her cameo in the film. 'Jawan' marks Deepika's fifth collaboration with Shah Rukh. She also opened up on her equation with Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nDEEPIKA PADUKONE ON HER EQUATION WITH SRK\n\nOpening up about her equation with Shah Rukh, Deepika shared that there is deep trust and respect between them that allows them to be vulnerable with each other. “I am one of the few people he is vulnerable with. There is so much trust and respect, and I think that luck is just the cherry on the top,” she said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDeepika, who made her Bollywood debut opposite SRK in 2017's 'Om Shanti Om', also co-starred in 'Happy New Year' and 'Chennai Express'. All the films have done well at the box office, with fans referring to her as SRK's 'lucky charm'.\n\nDEEPIKA'S CAMEO IN 'JAWAN'\n\nIn 'Jawan', Deepika assumes the role of Aishwarya, the protagonist, Azad's mother, in the film. Aishwarya finds herself unjustly convicted for a multitude of complex reasons, entangled in the conflict between her husband and the story's antagonist.\n\nAishwarya Rathore, portrayed by Deepika, seamlessly fits the role of an ideal partner for Shah Rukh Khan's character in the movie."
