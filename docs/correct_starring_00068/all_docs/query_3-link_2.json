The fourth instalment in the YRF Spy Universe, it stars Shah Rukh Khan in the title role, alongside Deepika Padukone and John Abraham, and Dimple Kapadia and Ashutosh Rana in supporting roles. The story follows Pathaan, an exiled RAW agent, who works with ISI agent Rubina Mohsin to take down Jim, a former RAW agent, who plans to attack India with a deadly lab-generated virus.\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in November 2020 in Mumbai. The film was shot in various locations in India, Afghanistan, Spain, UAE, Turkey, Russia, Italy and France. The songs in the film were composed by Vishal–Shekhar, while Sanchit Balhara and Ankit Balhara provided the score. The film was made on an estimated production budget of ₹240 crore (US$29 million)−₹270 crore (US$32 million) including the cost of production, print and advertising.[4][5][7]\n\nPathaan was theatrically released in India on 25 January 2023, coinciding with the Republic Day weekend. The film received positive reviews from critics.[8][9] The film set several box office records for a Hindi film, including the highest opening day, highest single day, highest opening weekend and highest opening week for a Hindi film in India.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] It eventually emerged as the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time in India to that point and set records in all major overseas markets.[17][18][19] Pathaan grossed ₹1,050.30 crore (US$130 million)[20] worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, the third-highest-grossing Hindi film of all time, and the sixth-highest-grossing Indian film of all time.[21][22] At the 69th Filmfare Awards, the film received 16 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress (Padukone).[23]\n\nIn 2019, the Indian Government revokes Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which grants special status for Jammu and Kashmir. The news impacts a Pakistani army general Qadir, who decides to exact vengeance against India and signs a contract with a private terrorist organisation called Outfit X.\n\nPathaan, a RAW agent, with his senior officer Nandini Grewal form a unit known as \"Joint Operations and Covert Research\" (J.O.C.R.) to recruit ex-agents and soldiers who were forced to retire, but want to continue serving their country. With Colonel Sunil Luthra's permission, Pathaan and his team head to Dubai to stop Outfit X's suspected plans of attacking the President of India. However, they realise that their actual plan was to kidnap two scientists, Dr. Farooqui and Dr. Sahani.\n\nJim attacks the scientists' convoy and Pathaan tries to stop him. A fight ensues where Jim manages to escape with Dr. Sahani. Luthra reveals that Jim was a former agent, who was awarded the Vir Puraskar for his bravery after the army could not find his body. He had been kidnapped by Somalian terrorists, who killed his pregnant wife after the government refused to pay out the ransom the terrorists demanded. He faked his death in order to seek vengeance against the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Pathaan learns about the codeword \"Raktbeej\" and also that the dead people in Dubai were ex-agents and their money was transferred from the account of Rubina Mohsin (Rubai), a Pakistani doctor in Spain. Pathaan travels to Spain and is captured by Jim's men, where he also learns that Rubai is an ex-ISI agent. When Jim leaves his hideout, Rubai attacks Jim's men and escapes with Pathaan. Rubai reveals that Raktbeej is in Moscow, and they travel to steal it before Jim does. However, Rubai betrays Pathaan and has him captured by the Russian police. It is revealed that Jim used Rubai to make Pathaan steal the Raktbeej for himself. Pathaan is taken to prison by a train, but is saved by Tiger.\n\nPathaan travels to Africa and captures Jim's henchman Raafe. He meets Nandini and reveals about Jim purchasing two Saber missiles, while Nandini reveals Rubai's location in Paris. Pathaan meets Rubai, who reveals that the Raktbeej is a mutated smallpox virus, which was forcibly developed by a captive Dr Sahani under Jim's orders. She also expresses guilt about betraying Pathaan without knowing that her country would plan such a heinous attack. They travel to Jim's lab in Siberia and manage to recover one orb containing the virus, while Jim escapes with the other orb. Luthra and Nandini reach Jim's lab to take the orb back to India in order to develop a vaccine.\n\nAt the Indian Institute of Contagious Diseases (IICD), Dr. Farooqui opens up the orb to Nandini without apparently finding anything. Jim calls them and reveals that the orb has already spread the virus in the facility. Later, the facility is destroyed in a controlled blast. Jim provides an ultimatum to evacuate Indian soldiers out of Kashmir within 24 hours. Pathaan learns that the missile is situated in Afghanistan. After rescuing Rubai, they lure Jim's associates into a trap and attack Jim's base. Qadir is killed by Rubai after he activates the missile.\n\nMeanwhile, Rubai deactivates the missile, but finds that Raktbeej is not in the missile, but instead in a passenger-bound aeroplane, which is about to land in Delhi. Rubai informs Pathaan, who finds that Jim has the detonator. Luthra calls the air traffic control to prevent the plane from landing in Delhi. In the cabin, Pathaan and Jim fight brutally. Pathaan steals the detonator, and deactivates Raktbeej and kills Jim. Afterwards, Pathaan is reinstated and made the head of J.O.C.R, while Nandini is posthumously awarded with the Vir Puraskar for her bravery.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Pathaan and Tiger are seen pondering about retiring and suggesting young agents who can replace them, but eventually decide to keep fighting the threats themselves.[b]\n\nYash Raj Films, Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and John Abraham officially announced Pathaan on 2 March 2022 on their social media accounts, revealing the release date with a first look teaser.[24] It was previously teased by other cast members, including Salman Khan and Vishal Dadlani, on various occasions before. Dadlani announced the film on Twitter, stating, \"No number from the past matters, no number in the future is too big. The whole world is waiting for Shah Rukh, more importantly, we're all working on a kickass film with great songs.\"[25] This film is YRF's first Dolby Cinema.[26]\n\nShanoo Sharma was the casting director. Khan was cast in the film in September 2020.[27] Padukone joined production that November,[28] while Abraham rounded out the main cast in June 2021, joining filming in Mumbai.[29][30] Dimple Kapadia was cast in December 2020.[31][32] Salman Khan was confirmed to make a cameo appearance in November 2020, reprising his role as Avinash Singh Rathore from the Tiger franchise.[33][34]\n\nPrincipal photography of the film began on 17 November 2020 in Mumbai.[35][36] In January 2021, filming moved to Dubai. Some of the major action sequences including a long chase sequence were shot in the same schedule.[37][38] On 12 April 2021,[39] the crew took a two-day break. However, following the reports of some crew members of the film tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequent lockdown in Maharashtra, further schedules of the film were postponed.[40][41] The filming resumed on 25 June at Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[42] Later in July, another schedule of the film began.[43] Padukone began filming in this schedule.[44] A song was scheduled to be shot from 7 October in Mallorca and Cádiz,[45][46] but the schedule was postponed.[47]\n\nIn February 2022, production moved to Spain to shoot action sequences including Khan, Padukone, and Abraham.[48] Filming then took place in Mallorca and Cádiz.[49] The Spain schedule was completed in March 2022, with the Mumbai schedule completed in Yash Raj Studios as the film wrapped. In October 2022, reshoots and additional scenes were completed. The film was shot in multiple locations across India, Afghanistan, Spain, UAE, Turkey, Russia, Italy and France.[50][51] It was the first Indian film to be shot in Siberia's Lake Baikal.[52]\n\nMain article: Pathaan (soundtrack)\n\nThe soundtrack album for Pathaan featured four tracks: two songs, \"Besharam Rang\" and \"Jhoome Jo Pathaan\", composed by Vishal–Shekhar and written by Kumaar and two instrumental themes from the original score written and composed by Sanchit and Ankit Balhara: \"Jim's Theme\" and \"Pathaan's Theme\". Apart from its original, the soundtrack album was released in Tamil and Telugu.[53]\n\nRight-wing Hindutva groups alleged that the song \"Besharam Rang\" promotes obscenity and that it disrespects the saffron colour as Padukone features in a saffron bikini in the song.[54] Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra called the song objectionable and warned that his government may consider banning the film if costumes in the song are not corrected.[55] Khan's effigies and posters were burnt in various cities of Madhya Pradesh as a symbol of protest against the film.[56] TV actor Mukesh Khanna questioned the Censor Board for passing the song despite obscenity.[57] The News Minute termed the entire controversy as \"shameless misreading for jingoism\" and stated that there were five different costumes worn by Padukone in the song and the boycotters are criticising this particular scene which features merely for 20 seconds as it suits their agenda.[58] A Muslim organisation also objected to the song.[59]\n\nOn 29 December 2022, the Central Board of Film Certification asked the filmmakers to make some changes in the film, including in its songs citing culture and faith.[60] The film went through some minor changes though the saffron dress scene in the song \"Besharam Rang\" was reportedly retained.[61] Pathaan was later granted a U/A certificate by the Board.[62]\n\nOn 4 January 2023, members of Bajrang Dal tore down the posters of the film at an Ahmedabad mall. They also warned them to not release the film in theatres.[63] Gujarat Multiplex Association wrote a letter to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi on the threats received by the theatre owners in Gujarat from various groups. Sanghavi assured protection to multiplexes on the release of the film and instructed police chiefs of cities and districts to provide protection to the theatres.[64]\n\nOn 17 January 2023, during the Bharatiya Janata Party national executive meeting in New Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his party workers and leaders to refrain from making unnecessary remarks on films.[65][66] Despite this, Bajrang Dal activists tore down posters of the film and set them on fire at a cinema hall which was about to screen the movie in Guwahati. Assam's chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, assured Shah Rukh Khan that his government would maintain the law and order in the state.[67]\n\nThe release date of Pathaan was revealed on 2 March 2022 through an announcement teaser.[68] A first look motion poster was revealed on 25 June 2022.[69] The teaser of the film was released on 2 November 2022, coinciding with Shah Rukh Khan's 57th birthday.[70] The official trailer was released on 10 January 2023.[71] The film's trailer was also showcased on Burj Khalifa on 14 January 2023.[72] Against norm, pre-release publicity was limited with no media interactions or public events.[73]\n\nPathaan was theatrically released, in standard, IMAX and 4DX versions, in India on 25 January 2023, coinciding with Indian Republic Day weekend along with dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu.[74][9] Pathaan was the first Indian film to release in the novel ICE theatre format.[75] The film was released in 8000 screens worldwide, which included 5000 screens in Hindi and 450 screens in Tamil and Telugu versions within India.[76]\n\nThe film was theatrically released in Bangladesh on 12 May 2023 and thus became the first Hindi film to release in the country.[77] The film was released in Russia on 13 July 2023.[78] The film was also released in Japan on 1 September 2023.[79]\n\nThe digital streaming rights of Pathaan were sold to Amazon Prime Video for ₹100 crore (US$12 million).
