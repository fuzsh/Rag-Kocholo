        "text": "For other uses, see Om Shanti Om (disambiguation).\n\nOm Shanti Om (transl. literally to Om Shanti Om[lower-alpha 1]) is a 2007 Indian romantic fantasy film written and directed by Farah Khan, co-written by Mayur Puri and Mushtaq Shiekh, and produced by Gauri Khan under Red Chillies Entertainment. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone (in her Hindi-film debut), Shreyas Talpade, Kirron Kher, and Arjun Rampal. The story follows Om Prakash Makhija (Khan), an obscure 1970s actor, who dies in a suspicious on-set fire involving his crush, well-known yesteryears superstar Shanti Priya (Padukone), and is reincarnated in the present day as superstar Om Kapoor, seeking to exact revenge on the perpretrator, Shanti's husband and powerful producer Mukesh Mehra (Rampal).\n\nOm Shanti Om was produced on a budget of ₹40 crore (US$9.67 million). Farah Khan wrote the film while directing the musical Bombay Dreams (2002), which was based on the Indian film industry. The film eventually began production after its leads were cast, with its title being derived from a song from Subhash Ghai's Karz (1980). The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar, with lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The background score was performed by Sandeep Chowta. The album was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-selling album of the year in India. The film is notable for its cameo appearances from Indian film celebrities in several sequences and songs.\n\nOm Shanti Om released on 9 November 2007, co-inciding with Diwali, by Eros International. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its story, screenplay, soundtrack, production design, costumes, and performances of the cast. The film grossed ₹152 crore (US$36.76 million) worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2007 and the highest-grossing Hindi film ever at the time of its release."
