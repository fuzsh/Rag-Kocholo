        "text": "The 2008 film Om Shanti Om by Farah Khan not only launched the career of one of Bollywood's biggest actresses, Deepika Padukone but also left an indelible mark with its timeless songs and unforgettable dialogues. We also cannot forget the story arc, drama and costumes of the movie.\n\nHowever, the movie was made timeless by the performances of seasoned actors like Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal. However, the latter believes there is one 'irritating' character in the film. In his recent interview with Harper's Bazaar, the actor talked about nepotism in Bollywood.\n\nDuring the conversation, Om Kapoor from Om Shanti Om was mentioned and Arjun Rampal could not help but voice out his annoyance for the character that, we're sure, many of us must've felt. ''When he (Shah Rukh Khan’s character) is born the second time, he becomes a nepo. It was an irritating character,'' Arjun Rampal said.\n\nALSO SEE: Anupam Mittal Calls Out Toxic Masculinity In Salman-Shah Rukh Khan Movies; 'Regressive, Negative Behaviours'\n\nFor those unaware, Om Kapoor is the second character Shah Rukh Khan played in the movie. He is the reincarnation of Om Prakash Makhija, a junior artist, who dies while saving Deepika Padukone's Shanti. Om Kapoor gets born into a rich family where his father is a movie star, hence India's first on-screen nepo-baby.\n\nWe're glad Arjun Rampal mentioned how 'irritating' Om Kapoor's character is in the film. From harassing his personal assistant to cancelling shoots on a whim, OK reeked of privilege and unprofessionalism. We wonder if Farah Khan was onto something with this portrayal of a star-kid.\n\nALSO SEE: Arjun Rampal’s ‘Three Monkeys’, An Indian Adaptation Of Netflix’s ‘Money Heist’? Here’s What We Know So Far\n\nMeanwhile, Arjun Rampal also spoke candidly about nepotism in Bollywood. He opined that there is 'definitely a huge advantage' to the people who are born into the film family as they get a big 'head start'. ''That’s the destiny of that person… you don’t choose your family you are born into,'' the actor concluded.\n\nCover Image: Sourced"
