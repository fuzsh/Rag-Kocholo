Ohhhhhhhhhhh yeah.\n\nWelcome to Om Shanti Om.\n\nSong of the Day\n\nOm Shanti Om OST – Ajab Si. This is the song playing when Om first meets Shanti. [download]\n\nWe begin our tale 30 years ago at RC Studios, Mumbai.\n\nOm Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) is an extra on the set of a current movie being filmed. Although he’s merely an extra, he dreams of being more, and frequently imagines himself in the place of the stars.\n\nOm’s buddy Pappu (Shreyas Talpade) has faith that Om will one day become a superstar. He has everything it takes, after all–“style, hairstyle, grace, face, talent!” There’s only one thing holding him back–his name! With a name like “Om Prakash Makhija,” he’ll never be a star.\n\nOm and Pappu idolize Rajesh Kapoor (although they love to mock him with hand gestures), the studio’s biggest star (played by Javed Sheikh). Pappu tells Om that if he only had a last name like Kapoor, he would be a star overnight.\n\nThe only problem is, Om’s mother (Kirron Kher) doesn’t agree.\n\nMom: “I ask you, what is wrong with your name? Om stands for the Lord, and Prakash for Light, and..”\n\nOm: “And Makhija! Makhija stands for shooing a fly away!”\n\n(I have no idea if it really means that or not, since I don’t speak Hindi. Can anyone confirm? Either way, it’s funny.)\n\nMom (whose name is Bela, but I’ll just call her “Mom”) has faith that Om will one day be a star, but Om isn’t so sure. He’s convinced that he’ll die a Junior Artist, just like his father.\n\nWhenever he’s upset, Om goes to talk to his “girlfriend,” Shantipriya (Deepika Padukone). Only she isn’t his girlfriend so much as an unattainable actress, and when he talks to her, he’s really talking to a rather large billboard of her.\n\nOm dreams of being able to stand proudly next to Shanti, and firmly believes that he’ll meet her one day.\n\nPappu and Om’s mother are intensely amused by Om’s obsession, but they humor him. Mom praises Shanti’s beauty and tells Om that she’d be delighted to have such a daughter-in-law.\n\nMom ties a red thread (blessed by a sage) around Om’s wrist to grant him luck, and Pappu informs him that Shanti’s new movie is premiering that night. They decide to go to the premiere in the hopes that tonight might be the night that Om gets to meet her.\n\nWhen Shanti appears, Om is so struck by her beauty that he can’t stop himself from reaching out to try to touch her.\n\nAs he reaches out, the thread tied by his mother gets caught on Shanti’s sari. He follows her as if in a dream until she finally notices and turns around. When she frees him with a smile, Om practically faints in joy. Shanti smiles wider to see his reaction, then continues inside.\n\nDespite their brief interlude, Om worries that he’ll never see her again. However, Pappu, being the awesome friend that he is, has pickpocketed some tickets to the movie.\n\nThese tickets had been given to Manoj Kumar, another famous actor, so the two impersonate him in order to get in. (I have no idea who he is, but my Indian friends do, and they all laughed hysterically at their impersonations.) (And according to Wikipedia, Manoj Kumar filed a lawsuit for the film’s depiction of him. It was settled out of court.)\n\nIn the theatre, Om can barely pay attention to the movie, so entranced is he by Shanti sitting in the balcony.\n\nAnd then, one of the best songs everrrrr.\n\nThe film premiering that night takes a lot of vintage footage and adds it to the scenes so that Shanti appears to be interacting with actors of the era. It’s pretty well done, actually.\n\nOf course, Om imagines himself in the movie with Shanti as well, and there’s plenty of gratuitous shirtlessness on his part. (Harem boy! Gambler! Backgammon player! PIRATE! Shah Rukh Khan hams it up as no one else can.)\n\n(The song includes such a mix of eras that I have to wonder what the actual movie is supposed to be about, but I’ll let it slide for the awesome factor.)\n\nOm gets so involved in his fantasies that he gets up and begins to dance. Half of the audience loves it and cheers, while the other half boos at him. Shanti watches everything with amusement, and Om blows her air kisses as he is dragged out by security.\n\nAfterwards, Om and Pappu get drunk and hang out with some local children. They quote Shanti’s movie and fantasize about what the future will be like when they’re big stars.\n\nOm: “Today Rajesh Kapoor owns this bungalow, but one day it will be mine… I will live in style! I will have 15-16 imported cars, 50-60 servants will be around me! I will have a luxurious bedroom, just like the ones we see in the movies, with a round bed! And you know, Pappu, as soon as I will wake up in the morning, before my feet even touch the smooth marble floor, a servant will slip velvety slippers under them. The other one will be waiting on me with a silk dressing gown, and the third one will be standing there to serve fresh fruit juice.”\n\nPappu is drunkenly moved, and tells Om that he will definitely win the Filmfare award soon, but to first accept his “Bottle Award.” Om does so happily, and recites a speech he has prepared for the occasion:\n\nOm: “Ladies and gentlemen, I have wanted you so much and so badly it’s true that the entire universe has conspired for me to get you…. They say, if you want something with all your heart, then the universe will work in every way possible to help you get it. Today, you all have given me everything that I wanted. Thank you very much. I feel like the king of the world! Thank you for making me believe that, just like in our films, in life too, finally, in the end, everything is okay. ‘Happy Ending.’ And if it is not happy, then it is not ‘the end,’ my friends! The film is not over yet!”\n\nPappu and the children are moved and clap enthusiastically, but the man trying to sleep near them isn’t so amused. He chases them off, and Pappu and Om run, laughing all the way.\n\nOm returns home, still drunk, and accidentally wakes up his mother. Happily, he tells her:\n\nOm: “You always tell me that you have a dream for me, to reach for the stars and the moon. Tonight I went for the stars and beyond. I almost lived my dream. I even touched it, with my own two hands.”\n\nMom is pleased, then yells at him to go to sleep. (Hah.)\n\nThe next day, Om and Pappu show up to the set. They’re extras yet again, and Om only has one speaking line–when the field is set on fire, he has to yell “Run!”\n\nThe director is in a bad mood that morning because Shanti refuses to film without speaking to the producer. Desperate, they call the producer, Mukesh Mehra (Arjun Rampal). Within minutes, Mukesh has convinced Shanti to do the shoot, and he promptly leaves.\n\nThe scene requires Shanti to run around in the flaming field, yelling for the hero. Unfortunately, the hero is a bit of a pansy and refuses to jump into the fire. Things get out of control, and soon Shanti is trapped in the flaming field.\n\nSeeing that no one is coming to Shanti’s rescue, Om runs through the flames himself. Pulling her to him, he picks her up and carries her out of harm’s way. (I’m amused at how a clear path suddenly opened, but whatever.)\n\nRushed off to safety, Shanti looks back to see Om practically fainting with happiness again.\n\nAfterwards, Pappu is bandaging Om’s back from where his clothing caught on fire, and he yells at Om for putting himself in danger.\n\nOm: “Pappu, I did not think at that time. All I could see was Shanti trapped in that fire, helpless. And you know, if need be, I will jump in that fire again and again! Not once but a hundred times, a thousand times, to save Shanti! Because nothing is more precious to me than Shanti’s life. My life, my dreams, nothing matters!”\n\nShanti has come over to thank him, and overhears everything. When Om finally turns around, he’s so shocked to see her that he can’t even formulate any words to reply to her thanks. She asks his name, and he can only think:\n\nOm: “My name is something which is always connected to Shanti. Om, before Shanti, and Om, after Shanti.”\n\n(I guess this is some sort of prayer? Again, my ignorance shows.)\n\nLuckily, Pappu steps in to tell her his name. When Shanti mentions that Om looks familiar, Pappu then goes a hundred steps further and makes up some story about how Om is a huge star in South India–Omaswami Shantinatahan. (HAHAHA.) Poor Om is so confused that he can barely keep up.\n\nThe next day, Pappu and Om have staged a huge fake film set to impress Shanti. It’s comedy gold, involving a red leather cowboy outfit, multiple pairs of sunglasses, “flying,” and a giant stuffed tiger. Shanti is enchanted as Om shows off for her.\n\nAfterwards, Shanti comes over to greet Om, who pretends he hasn’t noticed her. They talk pleasantly, and Om begins to chatter on about how much he loves filming–the lights, the sets, the costumes, the autographs. He asks Shanti what her favourite part is, to which she replies, “Pack up.” Overhearing this, the extras who have been helping Om out all freak out and pack up the “set.”\n\nEmbarrassed, Om admits that he’s lied to Shanti. He maintains that he had no choice, since she’s a star and he’s just a junior artist, but Shanti is shocked at this. He jumped in the fire for her, after all–he’s definitely a hero. Shanti tells him that she’d do anything to repay him, so Om excitedly asks for an evening together.\n\nThat night, a veiled girl comes to him and tells him that Shanti won’t meet with him. Om is upset and angrily rants about how Shanti has broken his heart. Then the girl lifts her shroud to reveal her identity–it’s Shanti! (As if we didn’t already know, haha.)\n\nShanti comes bearing a gift for Om. It’s a snow globe music box, and its tune segues into the next song.\n\nOm takes Shanti out, serenading her as they play with various movie sets.\n\n“I have found you, but it seems I have lost myself.\n\nl want to tell you but then how do l tell?\n\nln any language that is known l can’t find the words\n\nTo tell you what you mean to me.”\n\nThis whole sequence reminds me of Singin’ In the Rain, for obvious reasons.\n\nAfterwards, Om and Shanti stroll cheerfully down the street. When Om tells her that it feels as if heaven is at his feet, Shanti jokingly asks if he ever gets sad. He replies that he doesn’t; and even if he does, all he has to do is watch one of her films. After, all, she’s the Shanti that everyone loves, so how could anyone be sad when watching her?\n\nShanti doesn’t see things the same way, however.\n\nShanti: “Sometimes the love of the entire world is not enough. Sometimes getting love from that one person is what counts.”\n\nOm: “You will get that love, Shanti. All you have to do is reach out for it. [offerring his hand, then retracting it] You will get whatever you want. You deserve all the happiness in the world. All you have to do is ask. And then see, happiness will follow you around.”\n\nShanti is skeptical, but she thanks him, and decides that she will reach for her happiness.\n\nOm, being sweet and naive, innocently believes that she’s talking about him, and he spends the next few days as happy as a fool.\n\nOne day, Om goes to visit Shanti on the set of her movie, but she completely ignores him as she walks to her destination, preoccupied.\n\nOm follows her into the building with all of the makeup rooms, hiding in an abandoned one when the security guards come by.\n\nThe empty room happens to be next to Shanti’s dressing room, and Om can hear Shanti yelling at someone. Climbing up to a vent in the wall, Om can see that the person Shanti is talking to is none other than Mukesh, the producer.\n\nShanti confronts Mukesh about a magazine article stating that he’s marrying the daughter of Harsh Mittal (a businessman). Mukesh argues that he’s letting the rumors go because Mittal has invested tons of money into their projects, but Shanti has focused on the marriage issue–how will he be able to get married, when he’s already married to her?\n\nOm is stunned as Shanti continues. It’s revealed that she and Mukesh have been married for two years already, but that he’s been hiding their relationship because the public would never accept a married heroine. Shanti doesn’t care–all she wants is to be accepted as Mukesh’s wife.\n\nMukesh won’t have any of her nonsense and tells her that they’ll reveal their relationship after her film Om Shanti Om is finished. Shanti tells him that it won’t be possible to wait that long, however, and drops a bomb on him–she’s pregnant. Om and Mukesh are both stunned by this. Mukesh appears to be thrilled by this news, but Om sinks into a daze. Leaving the building, he wanders through other sets (which conveniently have wind machines and fake rain to complete the anguished hero montage) unseeing.\n\nFor the next several days, Om isn’t himself, trying to come to terms with this new information. He suffers in silence, his heart shattered.\n\n“Neither do l live.. nor do l die.\n\nA dream when destroyed makes your world a void.\n\nYour love is not yours anymore.\n\nYour life is a barren core.”\n\nEventually, he wanders back to Shanti’s billboard and assures her that he’s happy as long as she is happy.\n\nOm: “But assure Mr. Mehra that I am letting him go only for you. But if I ever happen to meet him again in any other lifetime, he better watch out!”\n\nTrying to snap him out of it, Pappu gets Om a job on another movie. They’re extras again, and as they dance, Om sees Shanti pulling up. She smiles at him, but he pretends not to see her.\n\nUnable to stop thinking of Shanti, Om hangs out at the set of her new movie, Om Shanti Om. Filming has not yet begun, so the set is deserted.\n\nWhen Mukesh and Shanti drive up, however, Om hides himself away inside, unwilling to be seen.\n\nShanti has no interest in seeing the set, but her attitude changes when Mukesh tells her that they’ll hold their wedding there. He goes into detail, telling her about the fountain filled with champagne and the orchestra and how they’ll be married under the great chandelier. Om can’t take it anymore and quietly leaves.\n\nShanti is thrilled, and apologizes to Mukesh for not having trusted him. Mukesh is sorry that she had trusted him too. Confused by this statement, Shanti gives him a sharp look, growing alarmed as he continues.\n\nMukesh: “If you had not, then I couldn’t have dreamed this big! But I did! I dreamed of being the biggest and most powerful producer in this industry. And now, this dream is so big that I can break your trust, but I can’t break this dream!”\n\nShanti is alarmed as Mukesh blames her for ruining everything, and her alarm grows into fear as she realizes that Mukesh means to kill her. Throwing down his lighter, Mukesh sets fire to the set.\n\nMukesh calmly walks out as the flames spread, locking the door behind him, and Shanti bangs on it in panic.\n\nOutside the set, Om witnesses Mukesh leaving while Shanti is still trapped inside. Panicking, he tries to open the locked door, but is beaten up by Mukesh’s thugs. Shanti can only watch, helpless, as her hero is beaten.\n\nOm is determined to save her, and when the thugs leave him for unconscious, he breaks the window with a rock. The sudden influx of oxygen makes the flames rage even more, but Om rushes into the building to look for Shanti. They cry out to each other, but an explosion expels Om outside onto the road near the set, where he stands up in time to watch the explosion consume the building.\n\nImmediately afterwards, he’s hit by a car.\n\nRajesh Kapoor’s extremely pregnant wife has gone into labor, and they are rushing to the hospital when they accidentally hit Om. Concerned, they put him in the car as well and continue to the hospital.\n\nDespite the doctors’ best efforts, Om lies dying on their table, visions of Shanti passing before his eyes. (I really don’t know where all of the blood on his chest is coming from when there are no visible wounds in that area, or why the doctors can’t keep him clean, but we’ll let it go for the sake of the scene.)\n\nRajesh’s wife has a son, and they greet him with joy. Rajesh’s joy is tempered a bit, however, when he hears that the man he had brought in has died. His manager tries to tell him that it’s not his fault and that he’ll handle everything, but Rajesh still feels guilty.\n\nAnd with that, Om Prakash Makhija dies.\n\n30 years later, it is superstar Om Kapoor’s birthday. The only son of Rajesh Kapoor and an actor in his own right, he is as spoiled as they come.\n\nAs we are introduced to Om Kapoor (known as OK to his fans), Om Makhija’s voice is overlayed, describing Om’s future life as a superstar. Only now, what was merely a fantasy is reality. (By the way, I freaking love his house. The blue of those hallways calls to me.)\n\nOn OK’s wrist is a scar in the shape of the “om” tattoo that Om had, clearly showing us that Om has been reincarnated. As if we couldn’t tell already.\n\nOK is notorious for always being late to the set of his films and putting as little effort into his acting as possible. He doesn’t care, though, feeling entitled due to his superstar status. This makes things hard on the people he works with and causes a lot of delays, but he has no concern for anyone but himself.\n\nOn the set of his current movie, his character has become blind, deaf, and mute in addition to losing both of his hands. Upset with this, OK decides that there should be a dream sequence item song to express the pain of the hero at the impending marriage of his love.\n\nThis item song is probably the most glorious thing I’ve ever seen in Bollywood (or anywhere else, for that matter), and there are no words to adequately describe it.\n\nBasically, it’s fanservice for Shah Rukh Khan fans. Gratuitous shirtlessness (with that body, I’d be shirtless all the time too), a plethora of foreign (blonde) backup dancers, tight jeans, hip thrusting, sweat, rain, a waterfall, SRK splashing himself in a pool of water, someone literally THROWING A BUCKET OF WATER ON HIM.. Basically, I feel like I’m watching a softcore porn. (And I love every minute of it.)\n\nAt the end of the song, it’s revealed that OK is mysteriously afraid of fire. His phobia is so bad that he has an anxiety attack and faints when the special effects begin.\n\nAs he leaves the set after his attack, he’s accosted by his mother from his previous life, who is convinced that he’s her son and has been following him to all of his sets. There to restrain her is a much older Pappu (and sadly no longer as adorable), who is much more realistic. He admits that OK looks like Om, but that they can’t possible be the same person.\n\nBack home, OK is so shaken by the fire incident that he tells his manager that he’s going to stop filming his current movie and move on to his next one, which is about superheroes. His manager reluctantly says that he’ll be able to stop the current movie, but that it’ll be hard for the crew of the superhero movie to create the set in such short notice. Hearing this, OK tells him that they should just shoot on a real location instead. (How is that easier? Don’t they have to scope it out first and stuff? Stretching my belief a bit much, but okay.)\n\nThe next bit is so random that, while it doesn’t do much for the plot, I have to include it here. OK is so peeved with his manager that he takes the thermometer he’s been holding and tells his manager to shove it up his nose. Repeatedly. In a ridiculously childish way. I LOL’d.\n\nA few days later, OK’s manager takes him to the location of the new superhero movie. He tells OK that this location used to be a movie studio, but that it mysteriously caught fire and burned to the ground. OK doesn’t think this sounds like a good idea, but he keeps driving anyway.\n\nWhen they get there, OK is struck with a sense of deja vu. Looking at the ruined buildings, he hears voices from his past life, and is visibly disturbed. He also mysteriously knows where the makeup rooms are, which surprises the crew.\n\nBefore the shoot, OK wanders around the ruins. Walking up to the building where Shanti burned to death, he suddenly gets a vision of that day and hurries back to his own set, completely freaked out.\n\nAs he finishes filming a scene for his movie, it suddenly begins to rain, and OK seeks shelter in the building with the makeup rooms. He hears something inside the building and decides to go investigate, thinking it’s one of the crew members.\n\nAs he wanders, the building ceases the be rundown, and the lights turn back on. OK is confused, and wanders into Shanti’s old makeup room.\n\nThere, he witnesses again the argument between Mukesh and Shanti, only without sound. He also sees himself watching from the vents, and his mind is completely blown. When his assistant comes to find him, he is shocked to see that the room he’s in is completely filled with junk.\n\nLater, he goes to the old fountain and finds the now-broken snowglobe music box that Shanti had given him.\n\nSoon, it’s the Filmfare Awards. OK is nominated for two films (both of which are parodies of his previous films, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani and Main Hoon Na, and featuring music from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham).\n\nAs expected, he wins, and as he begins to walk up to give his acceptance speech, memories of the drunken “bottle award” night from his past life wash over him. Accepting the award, it’s as if his words don’t belong to him, and he recites the speech he’d originally given on that night, a strange expression on his face.\n\nEveryone is astounded at this moving speech coming from him, and Pappu, watching at home, realizes that it’s his friend.\n\n(Side note, but I love how pissed off Abishek Bachchan is that he didn’t win.)\n\nAt the afterparty, OK is in a strange mood. He reflects to his father that everything might have been different if he wasn’t OK, but just some guy named Om. He promises to try hard to be a better actor and a better son. Moved, Rajesh tells him that there’s a surprise for him..\n\nAnd then the celebrity cameos begin. (Look at the girl behind SRK in the second picture. She has priceless expressions throughout the entire song.)\n\n(For the full list of stars appearing in the “Deewangi Deewangi” number, as well as my general thoughts on it, see my commentary at the end. It’s not essential to the plot, but it’s tons of fun.)\n\nIn the middle of celebrating, OK sees a now-grey Mukesh enter the room. Rajesh greets his old pal warmly, but OK feels a growing sense of hatred and anguish as memories from his past life come flooding back. Overcome with emotion, he can’t bring himself to greet Mukesh with any warmth, and barely manages to shake the other man’s hand when they are introduced.\n\nNow that his memories have come back, Om returns to his mother’s house. She’s overjoyed to see him, and they both cry tears of joy to be reunited. Pappu has come as well, and the old friends embrace tearfully. Om assures them both that he won’t leave them again.\n\nOm wants to go to the authorities about Shanti’s death, but Pappu tells him that no one will believe his story. Om won’t admit defeat, however, and is determined that he will avenge Shanti’s death.\n\nWith this aim in mind, Om meets with Mukesh. He’s decided to revive the failed Om Shanti Om project.\n\nMukesh, it turns out, went to Hollywood after Shanti disappeared, receiving four times the price of the studio from the insurance company, marrying Harsh Mittal’s daughter, and getting a new studio as a dowry. Mukesh appears a bit suspicious that Om knows all of this, but Om affects an unconcerned demeanor and allays his suspicions.\n\nOm casually asks what happened to the old star of Om Shanti Om. When Mukesh tells him that she’d simply disappeared, Om insinuates that he must not have looked very hard for her if she managed to disappear like that. Mukesh is a little offended, but he lets it slide.\n\nOm insists that he must do Om Shanti Om, so Mukesh leaves him in charge of finding a new heroine while he’s in America the next month.\n\nOm accepts the challenge, and holds open auditions for the role.\n\nThe girls auditioning for the role all leave a lot to be desired, and Om and Pappu despair of being able to find their Shanti stand-in. Over a week has passed, and Mushek will be returning any day now. They’re running out of time.\n\nAfter the auditions one day, a girl wanders into the studio, declaring that she wants to audition, but only as an excuse to meet OK–she’s his biggest fan! The men wave her off, but she trips in the dark and they have to turn the light on to help her up.\n\nWhen her face comes into the light, Om is shocked to see Shanti’s exact double in front of him. The girl is Sandhya, or Sandy for short, and she’s so thrilled to meet him that she faints into his arms.\n\nOm’s mother and stylists throw themselves into transforming Sandy into Shanti, but they have a long way to go. Sandy is klutzy and ditsy, with little natural grace. With no idea how much is riding on her ability to become Shanti, she thinks of it like a game and doesn’t try very hard. She also continues to faint in Om’s presence.\n\nOm eventually gets fed up with Sandy’s inability to be like Shanti, and he yells at her to try harder. Pappu is upset with Om’s reaction and informs him that he should tell Sandy the truth so that she knows exactly what is expected of her.\n\nReluctantly, Om takes Sandy aside one night and tells her his story, and Sandy is moved to tears by his tale. Not only does she believe him (she’s his biggest fan, after all), she’ll do everything in her power to help him.\n\nFinally, they appear to have achieved success. Sandy is becoming more and more like Shanti, and Om is confident they can pull off his scheme.\n\nWhen Mukesh returns from the States, OK takes him to the set for the traditional blessing of the project. Mukesh is reluctant, but OK talks him into it, and they head to the site of the old studio. Mukesh is not thrilled at this prospect, but OK informs him, “An unfinished story should always start from the point where we left it, right?”\n\nOK introduces his fellow cast to the press, and, surprisingly, the lead actress is not Sandy. Instead, the lead actress is Dolly, a bubble with a mother, Kamini (Bindu), intent on making her baby a star.\n\nMukesh is immediately attracted to Dolly, stroking her arm sensually as he helps her to the stage. Om observes this with satisfaction and some disgust.\n\nAs they walk to the set, Om’s mother (disguised even further with bushy eyebrows) attacks Mukesh, warning him that “she” is waiting for him. When asked who “she” is, she replies, “Shantiiiiiiiiiiiii!”\n\nInside, Mukesh is shocked to see that the set has been entirely restored. It’s apparent that not only are they going to have the opening ceremony here, they’re going to film the movie here as well.\n\nThe coconut-breaking ceremony begins, and Om hands Mukesh the coconut. It must be broken in one go, he reminds Mukesh, otherwise it’s considered to be bad luck. Mukesh calmly throws down the coconut…which doesn’t break. Annoyed, he tries a few more times, until Om takes it from him. Behind his back, Om switches the coconut for a different one, throwing this one himself–and it breaks cleanly in two. Mukesh is visibly disturbed by this, but doesn’t say anything.\n\nNext, Om decides that they should offer a prayer for the previous actress of the film, stating that he believes that wherever she is, she’s watching over them right now. He calls Dolly up to light the incense in front of Shanti’s portait, which is rigged to burst into flames at the push of a button.\n\nExcept, the wires have come undone, and Dolly lights the incense with no ill effect. Mukesh is relieved, but Om is concerned. Luckily, the portrait then lights on fire…only, no one pushed the button this time.\n\nFilming begins the next day. While Dolly is shooting a scene, Om sends Mukesh a text message from Dolly’s phone, telling him to meet her in her dressing room. Seeing that Dolly’s mother (played by the awesome Bindu) has gone missing, Om follows her into the makeup building, trying to keep her from interrupting Mukesh.\n\nMukesh enters Dolly’s dressing room, which is now Dolly’s, and saunters over to the woman seated there. Suddenly, she turns around, and Mukesh is shocked to see Shanti instead of Dolly. Hearing his shriek, Om comes to investigate. Om enters the room to show Mukesh that no one is there, and Mukesh is visibly shaken.\n\nAs they leave, however, Sandy peeks out from the window of the neighbouring dressing room. (They must have built a door or something, because there’s no other way she could disappear from the other room.)\n\nA few weeks later, Om and Mukesh are sitting in a theatre, previewing the scenes that have been filmed. The scene played is an exact reenactment of the last argument between Mukesh and Shanti, but Mukesh shows no reaction. Until Shanti shows up, that is. Spliced in with the regular reel are scenes of Sandy, dressed as Shanti, glaring at the camera. Mukesh is seriously freaked out, so Om replays an undoctored reel to make him think that it’s all his imagination.\n\nMukesh is so disturbed that he decides to go back to America. This is not according to Om’s plan, so he hurriedly makes up the excuse that the music launch is coming up soon and that the film’s producer isn’t allowed to miss it. Mukesh promises that he’ll be there.\n\nPappu and Sandy are uncertain about this term of events. The music launch was supposed to be weeks from then, and Sandy’s not sure she’s ready to proceed with the next part of the plan. Om talks them into it, however, and they promise to do their best.\n\nHowever, Mukesh is suspicious and goes to the projection room to inspect the reel. Seeing Shanti’s face on the reel, he’s relieved to know he isn’t insane, and also determined not to lose to Om.\n\nThe day of the music launch arrives, and Mukesh arrives, confident. The song sequence being filmed is basically a rundown of the entire plot, designed to tell Om’s story. Mukesh doesn’t notice at first and simply watches, with perhaps a niggling suspicion in the back of his mind.\n\nAs they film, Sandy wanders the halls dressed as Shanti, appearing in random balconies. Mukesh tries to chase her down, but she’s always ahead of him, and he can’t find her.\n\nGiving up, he returns to watching the filming, and gradually begins to realize that the story unfolding in front of him is an exact reenactment of that fateful night 30 years ago.\n\nAt one point, Sandy insinuates herself into the dance along with all of the other masked dancers. As she twirls past Mukesh, she removes her mask, glaring at him, then twirls away. Unfortunately, she later loses her mask. Seeing this, Mukesh chases her again.\n\nChasing Sandy down the hallways, Mukesh is triumphant when he sees her cut herself on a candleabra. As he pursues her into the lobby, the chandelier falls down, and a piece of it hits him in the head and knocks him out.\n\nWhen he comes to, everyone is gone except Om.\n\nOm confronts him about his sins, describing everything in perfect detail. In spite of this, Mukesh is convinced that there’s no way Om could really know. After all, everything happened before he was born, right?\n\nOm reveals that he had, in fact, been there and seen everything. Mukesh does not believe him, but Om continues–he died with Shanti that night, but he was reborn to avenge her.\n\nWatching from their monitor room, Pappu and the manager send Sandy to go fulfill her role. Sandy is afraid, but she prepares to go.\n\nDownstairs, Mukesh declares that he knows about the duplicate Shanti. Pappu and the manager freak out and try to stop her, but the door is jammed and they can’t get out.\n\nMukesh continues–who would believe such a crazy story? Besides, Shanti’s body had never been recovered.\n\nSuddenly, Sandy appears behind them. She declares that she has evidence that will put him away for sure. Om yells at Sandy to stop it and hide, that Mukesh knows the truth, but she remains.\n\nSandy: You will have to listen, Mukesh, and listen carefully. You came back that night. After the fire died down, you came back, Mukesh.\n\nMukesh: Yes I did, so what?\n\nSandy: To put away my dead body! [But] I wasn’t dead Mukesh. I was still breathing.\n\nMukesh: How do you know all of this?\n\nSandy: But you buried me alive!\n\nMukesh: How do you know all of this?!\n\nSandy: Under this chandelier.\n\nMukesh is so disturbed by her knowledge of his deeds that he draws his gun to shoot her.\n\nMukesh: Who are you?!\n\nSandy: The court needs proof, and they will get proof, Mukesh!\n\nMukesh: They will not get anything!\n\nSandy: Right under this chandelier they will find Shanti’s dead body!\n\nMukesh: I said shut up! There is nothing there!\n\nSandy: You are going to pay for your sins, Mukesh. You are going to die!\n\nAs Mukesh prepares to shoot, Om leaps at him, and they fall to the ground, knocking over some candles and setting fire to the curtains. While Om is paralyzed by his fear of fire, Mukesh is immediately up, brandishing a candelabera with which to attack Sandy.\n\nPanicking and determined to save Sandy, Om seizes the discarded gun and shoots Mukesh in the leg, while Sandy calmly watches.\n\nShe stops him from killing Mukesh, however. He’s destined to die, but not by Om’s hand. Confused, Om follows her gaze to the chandelier. Mukesh follows their gazes as well, his eyes widening in realization. He screams as the chandelier comes crashing down, killing him.\n\nOm and Sandy stare at each other across the debris, a sad smile playing on Sandy’s face.\n\nBut Om realizes it isn’t Sandy when the real Sandy comes bursting through the door moments later, followed by Pappu and the manager. Shocked, he turns to look at the other girl, realizing that it’s Shanti. He flashes back to all of the mysterious occurrences on the set, realizing that Shanti has been helping him the whole time. She continues to smile sadly at him as she walks away, and he watches her go with teary eyes.\n\nSandy runs to Om, apologizing for not being able to do her part. Om comforts her, then watches Shanti run up the staircase, fading into nothing as she enters the light.\n\nThoughts & Criticisms\n\n(This is my “La la la, no one can change my mind about this movie~” face.)\n\nI. LOVE. This. Movie.\n\nThe first time I saw it, my friend had just come back from a summer in India, her suitcase packed with Bollywood DVDs. Out of all of the films she could have chosen to show me, this is the one she picked. Within 10 minutes, it was obvious why.\n\nThis film takes all the usual Bollywood cliches and uses them to full, ridiculous advantage. With great skill, it somehow manages to both cheerfully mock and pay homage to everything people love and hate about Bollywood. Om Shanti Om doesn’t just tiptoe the line between retarded and amazing, it does cartwheels and backflips on it. It’s so confident in its story and the skill of everyone involved in the production that it doesn’t get bogged down in trying to achieve perfection, but simply concentrates on telling its tale.\n\nAlso, it’s entirely possible that I’m in love with Pappu. Well, the younger version of him. He’s much less enthusiastic as a 60-something than as a 20/30-something, which is completely understandable. I mean, if my best (and possibly only) friend died tragically, I’d probably lose some of my enthusiasm for life too. Still, Young Pappu is so adorable that I can’t help but smile whenever I see him.\n\nSo, based solely on this movie, I now ADORE Shreyas Talpade. Seriously, he is so darling as Pappu. He took what could have been a generic throw-away character and infused him with enough life to make him memorable. I always love it when that happens, and I love it even more when said character is goofy and adorable.\n\nSince we’re talking about the actors, I just have to say that Shah Rukh Khan OWNS this film. Which is good, since he’s the star. His amazing talent to ham it up and then turn around and deliver on the angst factor in the same scene is something I can’t imagine anyone else being able to do so brilliantly. I just love watching him. (And if you don’t, there’s probably something wrong with you. I’ve yet to meet anyone who doesn’t like SRK.)\n\nDeepika Padukone is incredibly charming in her debut role as well. She made it quite easy to believe that they were two completely different people who just happen to look the same. Besides, the camera obviously loves her. (I think I took more caps of her than of anyone else, because she’s just so PRETTY.) It’s hard to believe that she was only 21 when this was filmed. (That’s MY age! I feel inadequate, haha.)\n\nArjun Rampal is an actor I’ve only seen once before, in the 2006 remake of the classic Don. He was superb at playing the villain there, and he’s excellent here too. I loved to hate him. Mukesh is so delightfully evil, it made his eventual downfall all the more sweet. Love it.\n\nAnd I can’t talk about the actors without mentioning Kirron Kher. She was fantastic as the melodramatic mother, which is always a role that borders on obnoxious. Still, she took Bela Makhija and made her lovable, and I appreciated that.\n\nOf course, not having grown up with Bollywood, there are a lot of in-jokes and references I don’t get. But the ones I do get are FANTASTIC.\n\nLike during the Filmfare Awards, both of Om’s films directly reference previous films that Shah Rukh Khan has done. I laughed SO HARD, especially when I realized what song was playing (I’m pretty sure it’s “Suraj Hua Maddham” from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, but it’s hard to tell since the segment was so short).\n\nAlso, “Deewangi Deewangi” is a song filled with blatant star cameos. Most of them are people Shah Rukh Khan has made films with, but some of them are just stars. (I think. It’s highly possible and likely I’ve just never seen the movies with them.)\n\nFor instance, the moment when Kajol appears is amazing, and their chemistry definitely lights up the screen even for the brief moments they’re together.\n\nAnd a random tangent which most of you probably won’t get:\n\nPreity Zinta reminds me of Jang Nara, only better. Her moment during “Deewangi Deewangi” is distinctly reminiscent of My Love Patzzi (to me, anyway). In fact, I might’ve liked that drama better if it had starred Preity Zinta and Shah Rukh Khan. (If you don’t know the Korean drama I’m talking about, you can go here, here, here, and here to check out a highly entertaining debate we had on Dramabeans about it.)\n\nThis song is ridiculously long, but it’s so much fun to pick out the star cameos that you don’t mind. Plus, you can have a dance party on your couch while you’re waiting! I even have distinct memories of dancing to this at various college parties. (I also have a lot of international friends, though, so my experience isn’t typical.)\n\nBelow, in alphabetical order, are the celebrities who had cameos in the film. Those marked with an asterisk (*) did NOT appear in “Deewangi Deewangi.”\n\nAbishek Bachchan *\n\nAftab Shivdasani\n\nAkshay Kumar *\n\nAmisha Patel *\n\nAmitabh Bachchan *\n\nAmrita Arora\n\nArbaaz Khan\n\nArshad Warsi *\n\nBappi Lahiri *\n\nBipasha Basu *\n\nBobby Deol\n\nChunkey Pandey *\n\nDharmendra\n\nDia Mirza *\n\nDino Morea\n\nFarah Khan *\n\nFeroz Khan *\n\nGauri Khan *\n\nGovinda\n\nHrithik Roshan *\n\nJeetendra\n\nJuhi Chawla\n\nKaran Johar *\n\nKajol\n\nKarisma Kapoor\n\nKoena Mitra *\n\nLara Dutta\n\nMayur Puri *\n\nMalaika Arora\n\nMithun Chakraborty\n\nPreity Zinta\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\nRakesh Roshan *\n\nRani Mukherji\n\nRekha\n\nRishi Kapoor *\n\nRiteish Deshmukh\n\nSaif Ali Khan\n\nSalman Khan\n\nSanjay Dutt\n\nShabana Azmi *\n\nSubhash Ghai *\n\nShilpa Shetty\n\nSunil Shetty\n\nTabu\n\nTusshar Kapoor\n\nUrmila Matondkar\n\nVidya Balan\n\nVishal Dadlani *\n\nZayed Khan\n\nI recognize almost all of the names, but a lot of them I wouldn’t be able to recognize by sight. Some of you may have better luck.. Just think of it as a scavenger hunt while you’re watching.\n\nMoving on.\n\nMost of the problems I have with this movie are tiny things. I mentioned some of them in the recap, like the mysterious blood on Om’s dying body, or the era-hopping song in Shanti’s movie, or how Sandy managed to escape from one makeup room to the next without Mushek noticing, or the fact that everyone just LEFT after Mushek had been hit by the chandelier the first time (why did no one call an ambulance?). They’re not major issues, just tiny things I noticed. Because I like to nitpick, regardless of how much I love a movie. There are, in fact, NO movies that are safe from my nitpicking eye. If there’s a tiny fault, I will find it, sometimes even glossing over the much more major faults.\n\nOne thing I noticed, which I wouldn’t necessarily go so far as to call a “problem,” is that the second part of the movie feels much shorter than the first part. This is odd because the first past, pre-reincarnation, is actually shorter than the second part. I’m not sure why this is, but it’s something I noticed as I was taking screencaps. I’d always assumed that reincarnation happened in the exact middle of the movie, but it most certainly doesn’t.\n\nBut anyway.\n\nBasically, this movie is amazing. It’s fun, interesting, beautifully directed, and full of awesome. Everyone I’ve ever shown it to has loved it, even if they don’t know or care anything about Bollywood. (It’s next on my list to show my mother. I bet she’d appreciate it.)\n\nStill, while you can enjoy this movie no matter when you watch it, it’s probably best to save it until you’ve seen some more Bollywood films first. That way you can better appreciate the references strewn throughout it and the craftsmanship required to create something so over-the-top that still manages to feel real. (Real emotion-wise, not plot-wise. I don’t exactly believe in reincarnation and ghosts and random musical numbers, after all.)\n\nAlso, the ending credits are awesome.\n\n(As a side note, I took over 1200 screenshots of this movie. Do you know how difficult it is to weed down from 1200+ pictures? Very difficult.)"
