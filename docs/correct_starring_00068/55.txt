Om Shanti Om, released in 2007, was a highly successful movie starring Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone. Directed by the acclaimed filmmaker Farah Khan, this film served as Padukone’s entry into the Bollywood industry. Both SRK and Padukone are prominent figures in the entertainment world, and Farah Khan has recently shared some intriguing insights about their earlier days. She stated that it was only because of Shah Rukh Khan that she introduced Deepika Padukone to Bollywood.

During an interview, Farah discussed the difficulties of casting a newcomer in Bollywood, particularly for a movie starring Shah Rukh Khan. Farah emphasized the immense pressure she faced while searching for the perfect female lead for the film. She highlighted that working with Shah Rukh was a dream for every actor and explained her decision to choose Deepika Padukone for the role. Farah said, “No one is going to give you a launch unless you are a big star’s son. Sorry to say, but that is the truth… I launched her [Deepika Padukone] because of Shah Rukh Khan. He was there. So, I could take that risk.”

The netizens who saw the interview said that Farah’s statement highlights the widespread nepotism in Bollywood and sheds light on her previous reliance on male stars rather than female ones. Currently, the film industry has made significant progress in this regard, with the creation of more films centered around female characters. Following the tremendous success of “Om Shanti Om,” Farah Khan collaborated with Shah Rukh and Deepika once again in 2014 for the film “Happy New Year.” Additionally, she provided guidance to these two stars in their 2023 theatrical blockbuster, “Pathaan.”
