        "text": "Anna Faris and Chris Pratt stunned everyone in August, when they announced they were separating after eight years of marriage. The split seemed to come out of nowhere, and it was meticulously documented by tabloids. Every tweet and appearance either of them made was scrutinized. Faris finally took control of the narrative when she talked about the split on her podcast. \"Hey, dear listeners: I just want to thank you all so much for all the love I've been receiving, and I truly love you,\" she said.\n\nAnd now she's telling her story even more—this time in her autobiography, Unqualified, which was written and published before Pratt and Faris announced their uncoupling. Faris discusses her relationship with Pratt at length in the book; in fact, it's dedicated to him, and he wrote the foreword.\n\nOne of the anecdotes making the rounds right now from the book is how Faris actually left her first husband, Ben Indra, for Pratt. And the story is pretty juicy. In an excerpt published by the Daily Mail,, Faris discusses how she met Pratt on the set of the 2007 film Take Me Home Tonight; she had been married to Indra for three years at that point but knew in her heart the relationship wasn't working.\n\nHer attraction to Pratt was so strong on the film, she admits to feeling \"jealous\" of the \"background actresses\" Pratt was hooking up with at the time. Things finally hit a fever pitch one evening at a costar's apartment; she realized then their chemistry was palpable, and she had to end her marriage to Indra.\n\nSo that's exactly what she did…immediately afterward and over the phone. Indra didn't take Faris seriously at first, dismissing her as \"just tired\"—but she stood her ground. \"Nope, I'm leaving you,\" Faris said.\n\nShortly after this, Faris says she went to Pratt's house pretty much \"ready to get boned.\" Their hookup was \"'hot and heavy in a way that [she'd] never experienced before.\"\n\n\"Sure, I get to proclaim that I didn't f-ck Chris before I left Ben, but what is there to celebrate in that? It didn't make me a hero,\" she writes in the book. \"After all, I wanted to. Desperately. And I had feelings for him, obviously, even if I wasn't honest with myself about what those were.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nAnna Faris Liked a Tweet About Divorce a Week Before Announcing Split From Chris Pratt"
