        "text": "\"We see the angry eyebrows and non smiling eyes [and] we see a subdued smile from Chris,\" Brown tells Elite Daily. \"He usually smiles with his mouth open, but this time it's closed. So they're trying to make good here but the tiny tells say it's not working.\"\n\nSadly, it would seem that these two may have been on the rocks way back in December 2016, during the premiere of Pratt's movie, Passengers. But the truth of the matter is that sometimes there's just a disconnect between two people that becomes more and more obvious over time.\n\n\"They're just so reserved towards each other,\" notes Brown. \"They're doing 'polite' instead of showing real passion toward each other.\"\n\nAnd while it can be easy to speculate what's going on between two people from the outside, the private intricacies of every relationship aren't always obvious to on-lookers. But here, as Brown pointed out, they seem to be rather detached.\n\n\"He's got his arm wrapped around her and is pulling her in tight. Is this the time in their relationship where he's still hanging on and she's started to check out? Maybe so,\" explains Brown.\n\nAnd I mean, it's pretty hard to ignore Faris' facial expression, which seems to be a cross between a forced smile and a cringe.\n\nBut one of the hardest parts about being a couple in the public eye — especially when you are working through a rough patch — must be having to pretend like everything's fine when it's not. Most couples who are on the rocks don't have to constantly worry about being watched and ridiculed, on top of all of the pressures surrounding trying to save a marriage\n\n\"Their body angles are fairly consistent throughout, so they do have their attention on each other throughout, but happiness fades over time,\" says Brown.\n\nJust because you are no longer happy with a relationship, doesn't mean that every moment you spend together is terrible. Pratt getting his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is a huge accomplishment, and so it totally makes sense that despite their issues, they both look genuinely happy.\n\n\"When they're on the Walk of Fame, she's holding on to him with both hands — there's a deep connection there,\" says Brown.\n\nEven though the relationship didn't work out in the end, it's clear that these two definitely still care about each other.\n\n\"We still love each other and will always cherish our time together,\" the couple said in the joint statement annoucing their split. No matter how much love you have for someone, at this point most of us know that love isn't enough to keep a relationship on the up and up. Sometimes things run their course and it's time to go your separate ways, but that doesn't take anything away from the love you shared in the past. Love, even if it falls apart in the end, is never a waste of time."
