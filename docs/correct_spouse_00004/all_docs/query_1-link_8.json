        "text": "Since separating from her ex-husband in 2017, Anna Faris says that her relationship with Chris Pratt, as well as his wife Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, has only grown stronger.\n\nThe actor said that in the years since their split, “We're all getting much closer, and I so appreciate that.” She told People that she and Pratt are still on very friendly terms as they continue to co-parent their 10-year-old son, Jack. “They're very protective of me, and I want to be very protective of them. I so appreciate their support,” Faris said of the couple. She went on to enthuse that Schwarzenegger is an “awesome” person and “She's just on top of it. I love how she is with Jack.”\n\nThe former Mom star has also recently gotten remarried herself, eloping with cinematographer Michael Barrett last year, telling the paparazzi at the time that the ceremony, “was just us…With a little bit of age, you don't need the whole thing.” Barrett has two children of his own from a previous marriage, and Faris says that she's optimistic that they will all be able to be one big, happy, blended family and spend their holidays altogether in the near future. “We won't have this Thanksgiving together, but I do hope that we can celebrate holidays,” she told the outlet. “And I do think we can. But right now we just have family obligations that take us elsewhere.” Pratt and Schwarzenegger also have two young daughters together, two year old Lyla and five month old Eloise. Faris added, “I'm happy with that element. And it feels just much easier now that time has passed. It feels really good to not live with that internal churning of unpleasantness.”\n\nThe actor went on to say that she and Barrett are still very much in the honeymoon stage of their relationship, explaining, “We realized early on that we didn't want to be apart. There's a feeling of consistent safety and security that I really appreciate.” Her husband even traveled with her to New Orleans earlier this year while she filmed her new movie The Estate, staying with her throughout the duration of the shoot. Of her role in the forthcoming film, Faris said that she was delighted to get to play a harsher, more unlikeable character after years of playing upbeat, vivacious blondes. She confessed, “There's such liberation in getting to play kind of atrocious people. The emphasis for so much of my career felt like the likability factor: ‘Is she likable?’ That always felt like the mantra. So I had a blast playing Savanna. It nurtured something in me.”"
