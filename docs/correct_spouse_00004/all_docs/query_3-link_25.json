        "text": "Anna Faris has spoken candidly about her past marriages, revealing that she didn’t do a “great job of eliminating competitiveness”.\n\nThe actress, who was married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008 and to Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2018, opened up about her love life and why her previous relationships may not have worked out during Monday’s episode of her Anna Faris Is Unqualified podcast, where she spoke with Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nDuring the episode, Faris, who is currently engaged to Michael Barrett, told Paltrow: “I’ve been married twice. My two other marriages were with actors and I don’t think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness.\n\n“Or at least I didn’t, being a proud person, and not wanting to reveal vulnerability.”\n\n“Any hint of competitiveness and comparison, I didn’t handle that very well, I don’t think,” Faris continued. “And I hope I’ve grown from that.”\n\nRead more:\n\nFaris and Pratt, who share eight-year-old son Jack, announced they were separating in August 2017 with a joint statement.\n\n“Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,” the statement said. “We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed.”\n\nThe 44-year-old confirmed that she was engaged to Barrett, who she met while filming the 2018 film Overboard, in February 2020 while appearing onThe Late Late Show with James Corden, where she asked the host if he would officiate the wedding.\n\nHowever, she previously revealed during an appearance on divorce attorney Laura Wasser’s Divorce Sucks! podcast that she struggles with the idea of “our legal system” and the role it plays in a committed relationship.\n\n“I will say I believe in love and monogamy and I believe in the commitment with a relationship. But I do struggle, having gone through it a couple of times now, Laura, with the idea of our legal system,” she said. “I struggle with that on kind of a feminist level.”\n\nPratt married Katherine Schwarzenegger in 2019, with the pair welcoming a daughter in August 2020."
