Congratulations!” she commented on Chris' engagement announcement on Instagram on Monday, January 14.\n\nKatherine's mother Maria Shriver also commented, \"Congratulations to two loving, kind, caring, thoughtful, spiritual people. We are so happy for you. You are blessed, as is everyone who knows you. Yes, let's go.\"\n\n\"Anna and Katherine have met a few times and get along and that was very important to Chris,\" an insider told Entertainment Tonight. \"Anna is excited for Chris and Katherine and above all is happy Chris is with someone who loves Jack like their own. The couple got engaged quick but everyone around them saw it coming. They really are a great couple that have a solid foundation. Chris had the approval of the family and everyone is excited for their union.”"
