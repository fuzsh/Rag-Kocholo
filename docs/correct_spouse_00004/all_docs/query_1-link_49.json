        "text": "An Oceanside man known to stroll his neighborhood dressed as a woman is accused of cooking the flesh and bones of his 73-year-old murdered wife.\n\nAccording to Oceanside police, Anna Faris was found dead in her home in the 400 block of North Ditmar Street at 11:10 a.m. Friday after neighbors reported a foul odor coming from the residence.\n\nWhen officers went inside the home, they said they found the dismembered remains of the deceased woman cooking in pans in the couple's kitchen.\n\nThe heat was still on when authorities gain entrance into the residence, according to a complaint read by Katherine Flaherty, Deputy District Attorney with the County of San Diego.\n\nInvestigators also found Faris' head in the freezer and a work bench used for the mutilation in the bathroom. Near the work bench was a saw, a boning knife, other cutting instruments and pieces of bone in a plastic bag.\n\nFlaherty said there was no evidence of cannibalism.\n\nDetectives say they located the woman’s husband, 68-year-old Frederick Hengl, in downtown Oceanside Friday. He voluntarily went with officers for questioning.\n\n“After a brief conversation, police realized he was in the process of dismembering his wife’s body,” Flaherty said.\n\nLocal\n\nProsecutors believe Hengl killed his wife on or between the dates of November 1 and 16.\n\nIn court on Wednesday, he pleaded not guilty to three charges filed against him, including first degree murder and committing an unlawful act with human remains. His bail was set at $5 million.\n\nPolice said they’re familiar with the couple, but hadn’t been to the residence recently on calls of domestic violence.\n\nHowever neighbors told NBC 7 on Friday that the couple was known for some unusual tendencies.\n\n“The husband is actually known for dressing up like a woman and walking around the neighborhood. It's just a permanent fixture, I guess. It doesn't freak us out anymore,” said resident Jason Chandler. “[The wife] stands out here with a knife and she takes her clothes off out here on the corner.”"
