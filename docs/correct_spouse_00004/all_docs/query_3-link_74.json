        "text": "Anna Faris shares a son, Jack, with her ex-husband, Chris Pratt.\n\nThe former couple parted ways in 2017, following eight years of marriage, but have amicably co-parented Jack.\n\nAnna and Chris welcomed their son on August 17, 2012, seven weeks prematurely.\n\nWithin minutes, their newborn was moved to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nIn her book Unqualified, Faris opens up about her son’s health struggles.\n\n“The pediatric neurosurgeon sat Chris and me down to tell us that Jack had some severe brain bleeding and there was a chance that he could be developmentally disabled,” Faris shared.\n\n“I was in complete shock … So Chris and I did what we could, which was hold hands and hope and face it together.”\n\nThe doctors told the parents they would not be able to know for sure if Jack would require special needs until he was about 18 months old.\n\nAfter spending a month in the hospital, Faris and Pratt were finally able to bring their newborn home. So, how is Jack doing now, and what is his health condition? Let’s find out.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nJack, who suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage, is in good health now.\n\nChris and Jack appeared together at a baseball game.\n\nAnna Faris’ Son Jack Is Totally Healthy Now\n\nPrematurely born, weighing only 3 lbs., 10 oz, Jack suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nAs a result, Jack had to go through several surgeries: a few hernia surgeries, eye surgeries, and a heart issue.\n\nIn 2013, talking to David Letterman, Pratt shared an update on his son, “Oh, God, he is just … he’s amazing.”\n\nHowever, he still experiences minor vision problems and leg muscle issues. Aside from these challenges, Jack is in good health, and parenting him is easy as per his parents.\n\nHaving endured the harrowing ordeal, the former couple became involved with the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth, a group dedicated to ending premature and stillborn childbirth.\n\nChris Pratt Appeared With His Son For The Dodgers Baseball Game Following Backlash\n\nThe Terminal List star received a lot of criticism from people after apparently shedding his ex-wife Anna Faris and son.\n\nIn November 2021, Chris took to Instagram to appreciate his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, for giving him “a gorgeous healthy daughter” on her birthday.\n\nThis post grabbed a lot of attention, and some observed it as an indirect insult toward his and Anna’s son Jack, who was born with some complications.\n\nIn 2022, in an interview with Men’s Health, Chris opened up about how this false interpretation brought him to tears. “And I’m like, That is f*cked up. My son’s gonna read that one day. He’s nine. And it’s etched in digital stone. It really f*cking bothered me, dude.”\n\nChris added, “I cried about it. I was like, I hate that these blessings in my life are—to the people close to me—a real burden.”\n\nFollowing the backlash, Chris and his son, who rarely makes any public appearances, attended the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball game in August 2023.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy star took to his Instagram and shared a carousel of snaps of a day with his son at Dodgers Stadium.\n\nAfter supporting their favorite team, the father-son duo also attended the Christian Faith And Family Day.\n\nFAQs\n\nIs Anna Faris Married?\n\nAnna Faris is married to cinematographer Michael Barrett. This is her third marriage; she was previously married to Chris Pratt (m. 2009-2018) and Ben Indra (m. 2004-2008).\n\nAfter meeting each other on the ser of the 2018 film Overboard, Anna and Michael engaged in 2019 and eloped in 2021.\n\nIs Anna Faris Related To Sean Faris?\n\nNo, Anna Faris is not related to Sean Faris. However, they are both Hollywood actors."
