        "text": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris were often stamped as #couplegoals, and though it's been almost four years since their split, fans still crave details about their relationship.\n\nThe 44-year-old \"Scary Movie\" actress said during a Monday episode of her \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified\" podcast that in every breakup she's experienced, including her uncoupling with Pratt, there were warning signs.\n\n\"At some point I realized there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn't have,\" Faris said. \"In hindsight, I feel like my hand was forced.\"\n\nThey met each other on set while playing a couple on screen, fell in love, got married and had a son together before their romance ended in a joint statement on social media announcing their separation and eventual divorce.\n\n\"I never talked about any issues,\" Faris said. \"With Chris I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.\"\n\nHere's a look at the peaks and valleys of their relationship over the years.\n\n2007: The couple met on the set of 'Take Me Home Tonight'\n\nIn Faris' book \"Unqualified,\" the former \"Mom\" actress wrote that Pratt was perfect from the start.\n\n\"When I first met Chris, I was constantly looking for proof that he was not as great as he seemed,\" she wrote. The two met while filming the movie \"Take Me Home Tonight,\" in which they played a couple. During filming, Faris was still married to her first husband, actor Ben Indra. By the time the movie was released in 2011, Faris and Pratt were premiere-night official.\n\nFaris wrote that she and Indra split during filming and she and Pratt \"grew closer\" beyond their roles of Wendy Franklin and Kyle Masterson.\n\nMore: 6 times you'll relive Anna Faris, Chris Pratt's heartbreaking split in her book, 'Unqualified'\n\n\"You might think that, fresh off an almost decade-long relationship, I would be hesitant to move on to the next,\" she wrote, \"but I couldn't have fallen more headfirst into my feelings for Chris.\"\n\n2009: Pratt and Faris get married in Bali\n\nAfter a few years of dating, the couple tied the knot in Bali in a private wedding ceremony.\n\nFaris told the Independent in 2014 that the couple was suffering from food poisoning when they decided to get married.\n\n\"I was looking for chicken broth on the room service menu and saw the hotel also did weddings. While still feverish, Chris said, 'Let's do it,' \" she said. \"So the staff found us some traditional Balinese clothes and a local priest. We had no idea what was going on but we came back married.\"\n\nPratt recalled the union being more romantic, but still eventful, in an interview with Us Weekly: \"The best parts of my 2009 wedding were seeing my wife with flowers in her hair, the two families coming together, heartfelt speeches – and a pretty great fistfight on the dance floor.\"\n\n2012: The couple welcomes baby boy Jack into the mix\n\nPratt and Faris share an 8-year-old son, Jack.\n\nFaris has openly shared the story of Jack's premature birth to raise awareness for the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth. In her book \"Unqualified,\" Faris described Pratt as \"amazing\" when she was admitted to the hospital and put on bed rest after her water broke at 30 weeks.\n\nShe also wrote she \"felt so lucky\" Pratt was her partner after being warned Jack had \"some severe brain bleeding\" and therefore might \"be developmentally disabled.\"\n\n2017: The couple announces their split\n\nIn August 2017, Faris and Pratt announced they would be putting an end to their eight-year marriage. The couple issued a joint statement posted to their social media accounts explaining how they \"tried hard for a very long time\" and are \"really disappointed.\"\n\n\"Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward,\" the statement added. \"We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\"\n\nA little more than a week after they announced their separation, Faris opened up about it on her podcast.\n\n'I made (mistakes)':Anna Faris breaks silence on Chris Pratt split\n\n\"Life is too short to be in relationships where you feel this isn’t fully right or somebody doesn’t have your back, or somebody doesn’t fully value you,” she said. “Don’t be afraid to feel your independence if things aren’t right.”\n\nShe continued: \"If that would be the final piece of advice I could give you, that would be, 'Know your worth, know your independence.'\"\n\nA few days before the podcast episode, Pratt appeared at the Teen Choice Awards, his first outing since the couple announced their separation.\n\n2019 and beyond: Uncoupling of kindness and love\n\nFaris and Pratt have both found love again after their split. Faris confirmed being engaged to cinematographer Michael Barrett in 2019 and Pratt is now married to author Katherine Schwarzenegger, with whom he shares a baby daughter: Lyla Pratt.\n\nIn 2019, Faris shared the positives of her and Pratt's current relationship on the podcast \"Divorce Sucks! With Laura Wasser on PodcastOne.\"\n\n\"Under all of these uncoupling circumstances, I think that we are so good and respectful toward each other and I think there is so much kindness and love, and I know we want to get to that ultimate goal, and I know it sounds lame and optimistic, but that’s what I want.”\n\nFaris also said when Pratt popped the question to Schwarzenegger he texted her the very next morning.\n\nMore: Anna Faris confirms engagement with 'unbelievable' ring, muses on officiating her own wedding\n\nDuring an episode of her podcast she said, \"Chris texted me this morning and he was like, 'I proposed to Katherine last night.'\"\n\n\"And I was like, 'Ahh, that's amazing.' I texted him back, like, 'I just wanted to remind you I'm an ordained minister.'\"\n\nContributing: Kelly Lawler, Maeve McDermott, Erin Jensen and Anika Reed"
