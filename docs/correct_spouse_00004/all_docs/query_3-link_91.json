        "text": "Anna Faris recently opened up about her divorce from Chris Pratt in a new episode of her podcast, “Anna Faris Is Unqualified.”\n\nDid Anna Faris talk about Chris Pratt divorce?\n\nPer Fox News, Faris talked about when she was married to Pratt from 2009 to 2018. The couple broke up in 2017 before they settled for divorce in 2018.\n\nFew details were available about their relationship and why they broke up. But Faris seems to be releasing new details.\n\n“For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have,” she said, per E! News. ”In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don’t think it was ever an independent decision.”\n\nWhy did Pratt and Faris get divorced?\n\nFaris said on her podcast that she never talked with her husband about “issues,” which might have caused problems with her marriage, according to E! News.\n\n“I think it stunted me in a lot of ways,” she admitted. “One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people, even who I was closest to, I’m sure things were more transparent with my (current) relationship with Ben (Indra), but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.”\n\nDid Pratt get any backlash?"
