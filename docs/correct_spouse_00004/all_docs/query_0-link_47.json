        "text": "After two divorces, Anna Faris isn’t sure about marriage.\n\n“I need to figure out what the purpose is,” Faris, 41, said on Monday’s episode of Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast. “Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then the untangling — when the state gets involved.”\n\n“There is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man than as a man with a girlfriend,” she conceded of marriage. “I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship … I’m not saying it’s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.”\n\nFaris was married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2007 and to Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2017. She and Pratt, 38, share son Jack, 5.\n\nSources previously told Page Six that competition in their careers and disagreements over religion led to the demise of her marriage to the “Jurassic World” star.\n\nStill, the “Overboard” star admitted that her and Pratt’s PDA and social media presence made their rough patches and breakup even harder.\n\n“Chris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like on the Twitter feed, ‘Love is dead’ and ‘relationship goals,'” she said. “I think what we were also guilty of — we obviously cultivated something and it was rewarding for a while. It was like ‘People seem to think we got all this s—t right.’ ”\n\nThat doesn’t mean that Faris took lightly the public devastation at their divorce, which she confessed irritated her at the time.\n\n“I had a little bit of a childish feeling of ‘Oh come on, f——king grow up!’ Like, [there was] a little bit of anger. But that’s not fair either, because I cultivated it,” she explained. “We intentionally cultivated this idea of like, ‘Look at this beautiful family.’ There were so many moments that were like that but like anything on social media, you don’t post like, ‘Where the f—k is the toilet paper?!’ or whatever. I think it’s a very hard forum to be genuine, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.”"
