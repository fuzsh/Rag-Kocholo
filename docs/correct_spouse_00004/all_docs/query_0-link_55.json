        "text": "In a new interview, Anna Faris has powerfully opened up about going through two divorces, discussing how she turned into somebody she \"didn't recognise\" and how she's now learning to accept love from her new partner.\n\nAppearing on Chelsea Handler's podcast, Dear Chelsea, Anna discussed being a stepmother to her husband Michael Barrett's two children, saying, \"Being a stepmom… I'm still learning. I really am,” before adding, \"I felt at first I wanted to be kinda like this wild, new, reckless person in their lives, because I was also going through a divorce.\"\n\nAnna married cinematographer Michael Barrett in 2021 after the pair met on the set of the film Overboard. She was previously married to the actor Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2018 and to Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008.\n\nShe reflected on her first divorce, saying, \"I've been divorced twice. It hit hard the first time. I turned into somebody I didn’t recognize. Like, I was always the kinda person that had my fridge filled — and I hosted a lot of dinners. That was back when I had friends. But then I found myself in this apartment with just beer and mustard in the fridge, and I was going out all the time. I had no one to text or call to say, ‘Hey, can I do this?’ It was incredibly liberating, and I reverted back to, like, when I was 17 years old.”\n\nThe House Bunny star also opened up about being \"terrified\" of not being a \"good lover,\" she explained: \"I was so self-conscious of my body. I didn’t want anybody to see it, but I would dance on the edges of it. I wanted to be desired desperately.”\n\nShe then reflected on how her marriage to Chris Pratt lasted for much longer than her first marriage saying, \"It's slow growth on my end,\" adding that in her marriage to Michael Barrett, it's been easier for her to accept \"a lot of love.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I still kind of struggle with it [...] It feels healthier though, whatever it is. I feel like I can be loved.\"\n\nAnna has also been open about the realities of co-parenting her son, Jack, with Chris Pratt.\n\nSpeaking on her podcast Unqualified earlier this year, she said, \"Chris and I work really hard because we have Jack. That is sort of the long game idea and making sure Jack is really happy, which makes us really happy. We have sort of the luxury of circumstance. You know, we are both in other loving relationships, but it's like, how do you not, in general, sink into a place of bitterness?\"\n\nShe continued, \"I do want to reiterate though, that I f**king acknowledge, we all do, everyone acknowledges, that there's bitterness and pain with all breakups, and that hopefully makes us more human. But the long game, and it's just the worst being the bigger person. It just is. It f**king sucks! Until then, what [matters most] is that everyone's happy.\""
