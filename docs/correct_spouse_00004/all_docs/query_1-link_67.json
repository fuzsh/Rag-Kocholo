        "text": "Despite the sad announcement that she and Chris Pratt are calling it quits on their eight-year marriage, Anna Faris is still moving full steam ahead in her career. In fact, we’re only a few months away from the Season 5 premiere of the actress’ CBS sitcom, Mom.\n\nWhile she and Chris, 38, figure out the details of their split — and how it will affect their four-year-old son, Jack — Anna’s Mom character, Christy Plunkett, will be dealing with her own challenges when she returns to the small screen this November.\n\nMORE: Twitter Thinks Jennifer Lawrence Broke up Chris Pratt’s Marriage to Anna Faris and People Are Being Savage\n\nAs fans are well aware, Christy is a single mother who — after battling alcoholism and drug addiction — relocated to Napa Vally, CA, to move in with her own mom, Bonnie (Allison Janney), and start her life over. Though Anna herself has never suffered from addiction, she sees a lot of herself in Christy.\n\n“She’s so dimensional, she’s a mess, which is very much like me,” the House Bunny star, 40, has said. “I’ve played a lot of one-dimensional characters in my career that weren’t so bright … [which] is actually really difficult because you’re not dealing with somebody you’d ever really know.”\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nToward the end of Mom’s fourth season, fans were shocked when Anna’s character was involved in a surprisingly dark plot twist. The show took a rather somber turn when it was revealed that Jodi (Emily Osment) — a teen who had almost become a surrogate daughter to Christy — had passed away after a drug overdose.\n\nMORE: From Lena Dunham to Chris Pratt, These Celebrity Pet Scandals Prove the Internet Takes Animals Very Seriously\n\nBack in February, Mom’s co-creator Chuck Lorre opened up about his decision to address the heavy topic of addiction. “It felt important to the entire writing staff, including myself, that you don’t lose sight of the fact that this is a life and death issue,” he explained to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHe added, “Even though we’re doing a comedy and our first issue is to somehow cause laughter, from the very beginning we’ve tried to make this show about recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction, and to do that without ever acknowledging the harsh reality of it seemed to be a cheat.”\n\nMom returns to CBS on Thursday, Nov. 2, at 9 p.m. EST."
