        "text": "Anna Faris has starred in movies like Scary Movie, House Bunny, Lost In Translation, My Super Ex-Girlfriend, and many other films, amassing a fortune of $20 million. She’s also married to Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt. Read on for all the details on Faris below.\n\n1. Faris Married Chris Pratt in Indonesia\n\nFaris met her husband Pratt, in 2007 on the set of the movie Take Me Home Tonight. They became engaged two years later and married on July 9, 2009, in a small ceremony in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nFaris and Pratt also acted together in the movie The Proposition.\n\n2. Recently, Faris Teamed Up with Ellen DeGeneres to Prank Pratt\n\nOn September 25, 2014, Faris appeared on the Ellen Show and teamed up with DeGeneres to prank her hubby Pratt. The two left a voicemail on Pratt’s cell phone with Faris pretending she was getting arrested while DeGeneres played the part of the arresting officer. Check it out in the above video clip. It’s pretty hilarious.\n\n3. Faris Currently Stars as Christy Plunkett on the Show Mom\n\nFaris stars on the sitcom Mom, which has a very twisted plot. The description of the show is written as this:\n\nMom follows Christy Plunkett (Anna Faris), a single mother who, after dealing with her battle with alcoholism and drug abuse, decides to restart her life in Napa, California’s wine country working as a waitress and attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Her mother Bonnie Plunkett (Allison Janney) is also a recovering drug and alcohol addict. Christy’s 17-year-old daughter Violet (Sadie Calvano), who was born when Christy was 16, has herself become a teen mother by her boyfriend Luke. Christy also has a younger son Roscoe by her ex-husband Baxter, a deadbeat but likeable pothead.\n\nCheck out a clip from the show in the above video.\n\n4. Marrying Pratt Was Faris’ Second Marriage\n\nFaris’ marriage to Chris Pratt is actually her second marriage. While filming Lovers Lane in London, Faris met her first husband, Ben Indra. They married in June 2004, but they divorced in April 2007, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split. As part of their divorce, in February 2008, Faris agreed to pay Indra $900,000 plus other property and acting royalties.\n\n5. Pratt And Faris Had Their Son in 2012\n\nIn 2012, Faris and Pratt’s son Jack was born, named after Faris’ father Jack, a sociologist who worked at the University of Washington as a VP of internal communications.\n\nWhile Faris was pregnant, she and Pratt actually appeared on Top Chef. The show’s contestant’s had to create a menu perfect for the famous couple’s tastes, which, in Pratt’s case included “Pacific Northwest Squirrel.”"
