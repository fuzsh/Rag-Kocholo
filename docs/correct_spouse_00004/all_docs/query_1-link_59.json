        "text": "Anna Faris and Chris Pratt weren’t BFFs. The actress explained in an excerpt of her new book, Unqualified, that she doesn’t agree with being best friends with your spouse.\n\n“I was once told that I didn’t need a tight group of girlfriends because Chris should be my best friend,” she wrote in an excerpt posted by Cosmopolitan. “But I never bought that. The idea of your mate being your best friend — it’s overhyped.”\n\nOf course the now exes had their own special relationship at some point, but Faris explained that you can’t replace your squad.\n\n“I really believe that your partner serves one purpose and each friend serves another,” she explained. “There’s the friend you confess things to and the friend with whom you do the listening. Or this is the person I talk to when I’m feeling lonely and sad, this is the person I talk to about work shit, and this is the friend I’m still in touch with because we grew up together.”\n\nThe couple broke our hearts and the internet when they announced they were legally separating last month."
