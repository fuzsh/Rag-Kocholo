Especially grateful today for Katherine,\" adding: \"Our two daughters are so lucky to have you and you're the best stepmama to Jack. And to my mom, Kathy, you raised us with such love and light and laughter,\" plus: \"And to Maria, the best Mama G, I'm lucky to have you as a mother-in-law.\"\n\nDespite the backlash over the post, Anna, 46, and Chris, 43, have publicly gushed about each other and their co-parenting relationship since their 2017 divorce, and have even been spotted hanging out with each other's respective partners (Anna is now married to Michael Barrett).
