        "text": "Anna Faris confessed that while going through a divorce is always a difficult thing, it helped her to discover her true self.\n\nOn the most recent episode of Chelsea Handler's podcast, Dear Chelsea, the actress spoke about her past relationships and being a “divorce veteran” after going through the whole experience twice. Faris was previously married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008 and then married Chris Pratt in 2009, with whom she shares a 9-year-old son, Jack, before they decided to go their separate ways in 2018. But the House Bunny star hasn't given up on true love just yet. In July of last year, she announced that she and cinematographer Michael Barrett had eloped after three years of dating. Faris explained, “I've been divorced twice. It hit hard the first time. I turned into somebody that I didn't recognize. I was always the kind of person that had their fridge filled. And I hosted a lot of dinners. That was back when I had friends.”\n\nShe added that after her breakup with Indra, “I found myself in this apartment with just beer and mustard in the fridge. I was going out all the time. I had no one to text or call and say, ‘Hey, can I do this?’ essentially.” Basically, she “reverted” back to her 17-year-old self, calling the experience “incredibly liberating,” but also terrifying. “I was terrified that I wasn't a good lover. Especially when I was younger, I was so self-conscious of my body,” Faris revealed. “I didn't want anybody to see it. But I would dance on the edges of it. I wanted to be desired desperately.” But with her third marriage to Barrett, she said, “This time, it has been easier for me to accept a lot of love. I still kind of struggle with it but...When I was younger, if there was a lot of love—I must've subconsciously liked a chase...It feels healthier, though, whatever it is. It feels like I can be loved.”\n\nThe actress also previously spoke candidly about her divorces on a May 2021 episode of her Anna Faris Is Unqualified podcast and how she's processed those splits. “For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn't have,” Faris said. “In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don't think it was ever an independent decision.”\n\nTelevision\n\nEverything We Know About The Bear Season 3\n\nAll episodes of the Emmy-winning series hit Hulu on Wednesday, June 26, at 9 p.m. E.T.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe 32 Best True-Crime Documentaries to Binge Right Now\n\nFrom murders to cults to miscarriages of justice, the best true-crime documentaries have it all.
