        "text": "The actress shares Jack with ex-husband Chris Pratt\n\nAnna Faris's son is growing up!\n\nThe actress, 47, appeared as a guest on Today on Monday, July 15, where she sat down with co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Justin Sylvester ahead of the release of her new film My Spy The Eternal City, available on Prime Video July 18.\n\nFaris opened up about her 11-year-old son Jack Daniel, whom she shares with ex-husband Chris Pratt, sharing that he's starting to go through puberty.\n\nWhen thinking about how fast Jack has grown up, the House Bunny star admitted, \"You miss it sometimes when you look at old photos,\"\n\nShe continued to reveal that her son is now entering puberty, and opened up to his mom about his first armpit hair. \"I think I'm really loving this age,\" she said. \"Although, he told me that he has an armpit hair. So, it's happening.\"\n\nNever miss a story â€” sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nRelated: Anna Faris Admits She 'Mortified' Her Stepkids When She Tried Acting 'Really Cool' to Bond with Them\n\n\"Get ready, honey,\" Sylvester replied with a laugh. \"It is happening.\"\n\nFaris is also stepmom to her cinematographer husband Michael Barrett's two kids. The pair got engaged in 2019 and eloped two years later.\n\nIn November 2022, Faris shared with PEOPLE that she considers herself lucky to have a great relationship with Pratt and his wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt.\n\n\"We're all getting much closer, and I so appreciate that,\" said Faris, who has been amicably co-parenting her son Jack with Pratt since they separated in 2017. \"They're very protective of me, and I want to be very protective of them. I so appreciate their support.\"\n\nFaris had particularly high praise for Schwarzenegger Pratt, who is \"awesome,\" continued the former Mom star. \"She's just on top of it. I love how she is with Jack.\"\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\n\"We won't have this Thanksgiving together, but I do hope that we can celebrate holidays,\" she said at the time. \"And I do think we can. But right now we just have family obligations that take us elsewhere.\"\n\nContinued Faris, \"I'm happy with that element. And it feels just much easier now that time has passed. It feels really good to not live with that internal churning of unpleasantness.\"\n\nIn April 2023, Pratt, 43, told PEOPLE about their son Jack and how much he loved his dad's film Super Mario Bros. Movie.\n\nAt the premiere of the video game movie adaptation, Pratt said that Jack \"really freaked out\" when he saw his dad bring the eponymous character to the big screen.\n\n\"He saw it already and he's thrilled. He loves it,\" Pratt told PEOPLE. \"He took all his friends and he really freaked out. My daughter's a little too young to see it, but when they do see it, hopefully, they'll think their dad is cool.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
