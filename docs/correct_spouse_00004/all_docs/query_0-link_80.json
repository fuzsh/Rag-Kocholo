        "text": "Anna Faris sat down with actress Gwyneth Paltrow recently and the two ladies discussed their previous marriages and what divorce has taught them.\n\nIn the newest \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified\" podcast episode, Faris, 44, opened up about ending her past marriages with Chris Pratt and Ben Indra.\n\n\"My two other marriages were with actors and I don't think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness,\" the \"House Bunny\" star explained. \"Or at least I didn't, being a proud person, and not wanting to reveal vulnerability.\"\n\n\"Any hint of competitiveness and comparison, I didn't handle that very well, I don't think,\" the actress went on. \"I hope I've grown from that.\"\n\nFaris wed Indra in 2004 and divorced four years later. The actress then wed Pratt in 2009 and the two welcomed a son named Jack, who is now 8, before dissolving their marriage in 2018. The two have since agreed to co-parent their son.\n\nPratt and Faris have since moved on, with Faris set to wed cinematographer Michael Barrett. As for the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" star, he married Katherine Schwarzenegger in 2019 and, a year later, welcomed daughter Lyla Maria.\n\nAs for Paltrow, the actress reflected on her divorce from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, of whom she was married to for 13 years. The two share children Apple, 16, and Moses, 14.\n\n\"I really -- for a long time -- was choosing men and trying to work s--- out with them that I had no business trying to do in a romantic relationship. It was work I needed to do myself,\" noted Paltrow. \"In a divorce, I've learned so much from something I wanted least in the world.\"\n\n\"I have learned more about myself through that process than I could have imagined,\" added the 48-year-old Oscar winner, who has since wed producer Brad Falchuk."
