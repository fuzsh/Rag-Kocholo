Here is a look at their relationship timeline before they moved on to new partners.\n\nChris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger were over the moon as they welcomed their second child together, Eloise Christina.\n\nBoth parents revealed the news on their respective Instagram accounts, calling the moment pure bliss while sharing their gratitude with everyone.\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt during the Los Angeles World Premiere of Marvel Studios' \"Avengers: Endgame\" at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 23, 2019 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nPratt and Schwarzenegger are also parents to their nearly two-year-old daughter, Lyla Maria, whom they welcomed in 2020. A source close to the couple said at that time:\n\n\"[Schwarzenegger] is going through all the first-time mom emotions. She is extremely happy but a bit tired and overwhelmed. Chris keeps being amazing, though. It's comforting for Kat that he is already a dad [...].\"\n\nPratt is a father to nine-year-old Jack, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Anna Faris. Here's a look at his first wife and the mother of his firstborn child.\n\nWHO IS CHRIS PRATT'S EX-WIFE?\n\nLike Pratt, Faris is in the entertainment industry and works as an actress, writer, and podcast host. Faris is known for her comedic roles in the \"Scary Movie\" franchise, \"The Hot Chick,\" \"Lost in Translation,\" \"Just Friends,\" \"My Super Ex-GIrlfriend,\" \"The House Bunny,\" and many others.\n\nFaris has also moved on with her life and walked down the aisle for the third time to marry Michael Barett on July 21, 2021.\n\nShe met Pratt while filming the movie \"Take Me Home Tonight.\" Faris was still married to her first husband, Ben Indra, at the time but eventually divorced him. Two years later, in 2009, she married the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" star in Bali.\n\nIt wasn't until 2012 that they welcomed a baby boy, Jack, who was born prematurely. Faris penned her story in her memoir, \"Unqualified,\" and praised her husband for being the best support system during those difficult times.\n\nFive years later, the couple announced the end of their eight-year marriage. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed,\" they said in a joint statement. In her podcast, the actress revealed that she saw warning signs that led to their breakup:\n\n\"At some point, I realized there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn't have. In hindsight, I feel like my hand was forced.\"\n\nAnna Faris and Chris Pratt during the premiere of Columbia Pictures' \"Passengers\" at Regency Village Theatre on December 14, 2016 in Westwood, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nHOW DID CHRIS MEET KATHERINE SCHWARZENEGGER?\n\nA year later, in 2018, Pratt started dating Schwarzenegger, whom he reportedly met through her mother, Maria Shriver. The following year, the couple announced their engagement, followed by a beautiful ceremony six months later in California.\n\nNow with two daughters, the couple continues to nurture their relationship. \"I'm a big communicator,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I don't like going to bed angry, and we both are the same way.\"\n\nChris Pratt, Anna Faris and Jack Pratt during the ceremony honoring Chris with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 21, 2017 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nFaris has also moved on with her life and walked down the aisle for the third time to marry Michael Barett on July 21, 2021. Despite moving on, they continue to co-parent their son, Jack.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwaWplaXq4tM5mrpqrXZi1s7XSZqermaSpeqe10ayrZq%2BZm7JuvsSlmK2hn6PAb7TTpqM%3D"
