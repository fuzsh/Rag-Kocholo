        "text": "Anna Faris is reflecting on what went wrong in her previous marriages to Chris Pratt and Ben Indra.\n\nThe Mom star, 44, admitted that \"competitiveness\" was involved in the downfall of her relationships.\n\n\"My two other marriages were with actors and I don't think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness,\" Faris said on her Unqualified podcast with Gwyneth Paltrow. \"Or at least I didn't, being a proud person, and not wanting to reveal vulnerability.\"\n\nFaris added, \"Any hint of competitiveness and comparison, I didn't handle that very well, I don't think. And I hope I've grown from that.\"\n\nFaris was married to Indra between 2004 to 2008 and Pratt between 2009 to 2018. The actress shares an eight-year-old son with Pratt named Jack.\n\nThe star is now engaged to Michael Barrett, the cinematographer from her 2018 film Overboard.\n\nPaltrow also reflected on the problems that led to her divorce from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. The pair were married between 2003 to 2016 and share two children together, Moses, 14, and Apple, 16.\n\nREAD MORE: Anna Faris congratulates ex husband Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger on birth of their daughter\n\n\"I really, for a long time, was choosing men and trying to work s--t out with them that I had no business trying to do in a romantic relationship. It was work I needed to do myself,\" Paltrow said.\n\n\"In a divorce, I've learned so much from something I wanted least in the worldâ€¦ I never would have wanted to not be married to the father of my kids, theoretically. But I have learned more about myself through that process than I could have imagined.\""
