        "text": "Anna Faris opened up about her split from actor Chris Pratt yesterday, and how she is feeling about it three years later.\n\nThe 44-year-old actress was married to the Guardians of the Galaxy star for nearly a decade, from 2009 to 2018, and news of their split came as a surprise to fans in 2017, Yahoo! News reports.\n\nThey’ve both moved on in new relationships, with Pratt and Faris both engaged to new partners. The former couple work together as co-parents to their 8-year-old son Jack.\n\nFaris told E! News, “For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have. In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don’t think it was ever an independent decision.”\n\nThe former couple met in 2007 on the set of Take Me Home Tonight. Faris was still married to actor Ben Indra (2004-2008) at the time and the pair have sworn nothing happened while she was still married. After Faris got divorced, Pratt said that he knew she was “The One” the moment they met and that once Faris was single, the two of them were going to be together.\n\nThe Scary Movie star admitted that she never opened up about the struggles she was facing with 41-year-old Pratt. “I think it stunted me in a lot of ways,” Faris explained. “One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people, even who I was closest to, I’m sure things were more transparent with my relationship with Ben [Indra], but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.”\n\nWhen it came to calling off an engagement versus getting married, Faris said, “I really feel like calling off an engagement is a smarter, stronger, braver move than what I did. Which was like, well, I guess everyone is expecting this, so let’s just go through with it.” She didn’t clarify which relationship made her feel that way.\n\nNowadays, Faris is preparing for her third marriage with her fiance and Overboard cinematographer Michael Barrett, though they keep their relationship very private. Pratt married Katherine Schwarzenegger, an author, and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s eldest child at 31 years old. They married on June 8, 2019, and welcomed their first child, Lyla Maria Schwarzenegger Pratt, in August 2020.\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
