        "text": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris want to quit Hollywood.\n\nThe couple are keen for their two-year-old son Jack to have a ''normal'' life so are working towards a financial goal and will then turn away from acting in favor of other pursuits such as writing or painting.\n\nThough he wouldn't disclose how much they want to make, Chris said: ''I don't think we are the kind of people who need to be in a $50 million house, Jack needs to be in yelling distance.''\n\nUntil they reach the goal, the 'Jurassic World' star and his 'Mom' actress wife plan to keep working as hard as possible.\n\nHe said: ''Most important for us now is to keep this train rolling. Anna with her TV show, me with my movies and hopefully make it through to hit that number and then graciously exit stage left.''\n\nThe 'Guardians of the Galaxy' actor enjoys sharing life in the spotlight with his spouse because they have so much fun together.\n\nHe told Glamour magazine: ''The Golden Globes this year were so fun, we had the best time.\n\n''If I did it on my own, I might have an amazing experience talking to some A-list celebrity that I have never met before, or one of those friends I have who is not really a friend.\n\n''But when I retell it, you sound like a name-dropper and you can't really articulate it to those close to you.\n\n''It's nice to have someone to share it with - an inside joke we are both in on like, 'What are we doing here?' ''"
