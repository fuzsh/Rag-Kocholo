        "text": "Doyle agreed: \"It should be illegal.\"\n\nA post shared by Anna Faris (@annafaris)\n\nFaris first got married to actor Ben Indra in 2004 when she was 27. The pair had begun dating after meeting on the set of their 1999 movie \"Lovers Lane.\" Faris filed for divorce in 2007 after three years of marriage, and the separation was finalized in 2008.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThat same year, Faris became engaged to \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" actor Chris Pratt, and the pair married in 2009. The couple welcomed a son, Jack, in August 2012.\n\nHowever, Faris and Pratt announced their separation five years later in August 2017 and filed for divorce later that year in December. The divorce was finalized in October 2018.\n\nWhile Pratt is now married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, Faris is engaged to cinematographer Michael Barrett. They met on the 2018 movie \"Overboard.\"\n\n\"We had an immediate kind of intimacy,\" Faris told People in May. \"We're both probably introverts in a very similar way. And he has two children and that has been awesome. I've really learned a lot about myself through his kids. It's been really rewarding.\"\n\nFaris has recently opened up about her divorce from Pratt, telling Rachel Bilson on the May 3 episode of her podcast that she felt her \"hand was forced\" in the divorce from the \"Jurassic World\" actor.\n\n\"For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn't have,\" Faris said.\n\n\"In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don't think it was ever an independent decision.\""
