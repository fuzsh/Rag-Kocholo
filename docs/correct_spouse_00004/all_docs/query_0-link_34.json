        "text": "On a recent episode of her podcast, Unqualified, Anna Faris revealed the issues in her own personality that she thinks contributed to problems in her marriages.\n\nSpeaking frankly to Gwyneth Paltrow about learning from divorce, Faris said (per People), “My two other marriages were with actors, and I don’t think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness.\n\n“Or at least I didn’t, being a proud person and not wanting to reveal vulnerability,” she continued.\n\nFaris was married to Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008 and to Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt from 2009 to 2018. She and Pratt share a son, Jack.\n\nWhen Faris and Pratt met, they both were known primarily for their work in comedies—and they weren’t necessarily huge stars. But when Pratt joined the Marvel universe, he became a leading man.\n\n“Any hint of competitiveness and comparison, I didn’t handle that very well, I don’t think,” Faris said about her marriages, though she didn’t specify whether she was talking about Pratt or Indra. “I hope I’ve grown from that.”\n\nSince the split, both Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have gone on to find love with new partners. Faris is engaged to cinematographer Michael Barrett, and Pratt is married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, with whom he shares a baby girl.\n\nOn the same episode Paltrow opened up about her own divorce from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and her second marriage to producer Brad Falchuk. Still on famously good terms with Martin, Paltrow said, “I never would’ve wanted to get divorced; I never would’ve wanted to not be married to the father of my kids, theoretically.”"
