        "text": "Our hearts broke when Anna Faris and Chris Pratt revealed on Sunday, Aug. 6, that they are legally separating after eight years of marriage. The former couple shared the sad news via Anna’s Instagram account in a joint statement, telling fans that they “tried hard for a long time” and are “really disappointed.”\n\nWhile fans mourn the end of one of Hollywood’s cutest couples, let’s take a look back at Anna’s previous — and lesser known — marriage to actor Ben Indra. In case you have no idea who 38-year-old California native is, his most notable role was on the WB’s short-lived sitcom Raising Dad, which also starred Bob Saget, Kat Dennings, and Brie Larson, and ran from 2001 to 2002.\n\nMORE: Reese Witherspoon, Brad Pitt, and More Stars’ High School Yearbook Photos\n\nAfter that, his career stalled and he hardly booked a job after marrying Anna, now 40, in 2004. According to Anna, her growing fame and Ben’s lack of success in showbiz contributed to their breakup. “That kind of destroyed my marriage,” the blonde beauty — who met Ben on the set of the 1999 horror flick Lovers Lane — explained to Marie Claire in 2011. “The divide became too great.”\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe House Bunny star pulled the plug on her marriage to Ben in 2007, and their divorce was finalized in 2008 — just on year before she tied the knot with Chris, now 38. According to Marie Claire, Anna paid Ben $900,000 in their divorce settlement. Not long after she and Ben pulled the plug on their romance, Anna reveled in her newfound freedom by partying hard and getting breast implants.\n\nMORE: Anna Faris on Rumors Her Husband Chris Pratt Is Cheating: “It Made Me Feel Incredibly Insecure”\n\n“I was like, ‘F–k it, I’ve got nothing to lose, nobody to support.’ I wore the same Garfield shirt and jeans for three weeks,” she has said. “I had a running joke with my friend: ‘I hope somebody roofies me tonight!’ I didn’t care what people thought.”"
