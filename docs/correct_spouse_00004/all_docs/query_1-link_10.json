        "text": "This reveal was met with gasps from both the caller and her guest, food writer Gail Simmons. The 44-year-old actress confirmed, \"Yes, we eloped. I'm sorry, honey, I just blurted that out. I can't say fiance anymore.\"\n\n\"You guys, that's beautiful!\" Simmons responded.\n\nFaris went on to explain that they got married in a courthouse in Washington. \"It was awesome. It was great,\" she said.\n\nFaris and her previous husband, Chris Pratt, officially filed for divorce in December 2017, after eight years of marriage. The divorce papers listed Fari and Pratt's date of separation as July 13, 2017, and Faris was reportedly first spotted with Barrett in September of that year.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFaris and Barrett first met on the set of \"Overboard,\" and officially confirmed their engagement in February 2020, several months after she was first seen with an apparent engagement ring.\n\nLater in the podcast, Faris spoke about how her family also accidentally found out that she had a new husband. She said, \"We saw my family and it kind of slipped out the same way. My aunt asked me, 'You are going to be a stepmom. How are you feeling about that?' and I said, 'Actually I am a stepmom as of like four days ago, but it was great.'\n\n\"Everything about it just felt right,\" Faris said of her lowkey nuptials. \"It was San Juan Island up in Washington stateâ€¦ which is just the most magical place on earth.\""
