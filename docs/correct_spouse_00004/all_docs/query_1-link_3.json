The big reveal was shared on the actress’ podcast, Anna Faris Is Unqualified, on July 19, 2021 — one day before Michael first sparked wedding speculation by wearing a ring out in public.\n\n“I think we’ve spent the last year in a place of reflection, in a place of kind of prioritization to some degree, a place of anxiety, a place of like, whatever, assessment. But I’m looking around, just so, just my fiancé’s right…he’s now my husband,” she said. After being showered with messages of congratulations, Anna apologized to Michael for blurting out the news.\n\n“Yes, we eloped…I’m sorry. I didn’t know… I’m sorry, honey. I just blurted that out, but it just feels [like] I can’t say fiancé anymore,” she said to Michael. “Thank you, it was awesome. It feels great. It was at a local courthouse up in Washington state. It was great.” Most recently, in Feb. 2023, the blonde beauty went nearly nude and starred in a Super Bowl commercial about avocados. She also shared the clip via Instagram, which you can see here.\n\nWant to know more about Michael?
