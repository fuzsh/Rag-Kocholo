        "text": "Donna Kelce is sending well wishes Jenna Bush Hager's way for a very special reason.\n\nIt was recently revealed that the Today star was cast in Hallmark's upcoming holiday film, which is said to be based on Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's world-shaking love story—and she's not the only famous face viewers can expect to see in the TV romantic comedy.\n\nIn addition, the NFL mom is also set to appear in the movie, in what will become both of their acting debuts.\n\nRelated: Fans Cheer Jenna Bush Hager On As She Makes 'Exciting' Career Announcement\n\nSlated to premiere during Hallmark Channel's Countdown to Christmas programming event, Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story will bring football fans into the world of Hallmark's classic Christmas world.\n\nIn honor of the news, Donna popped in to offer, “Good luck, Jenna!” alongside the film's stars, Hunter King and Tyler Hynes, in a behind-the-scenes clip that aired on the Monday, July 15, episode of the popular morning broadcast.\n\n“We’re so excited to see you!” the 71-year-old added. Hynes signed off with, “We’ll see you soon,” as the trio waved to the camera.\n\nIn the footage aired on Today, the pro football mom—whose oldest son, Jason Kelce, recently retired after 13 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles—could be seen wearing a “manager” badge while filming a diner scene. Her role was revealed by the TV network as Donna, “the manager of the Kansas City BBQ Restaurant Norma & Nic’s.”\n\nThe movie will also feature appearances from Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and a handful of current players—a move made more easily possible due to both the Chiefs and Hallmark's headquarters being located in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAs for Bush Hager, she announced her exciting new career opportunity on the show last week, but with very little details, as she admitted she was sworn to secrecy on her role and any informational tidbits on the project.\n\nBut when it comes to the film, at least she knows she's got her costars in her corner for support!"
