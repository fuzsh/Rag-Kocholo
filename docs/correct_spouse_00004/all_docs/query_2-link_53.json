        "text": "Anna Faris recently visited the \"Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser\" podcast and addressed her divorce from Chris Pratt, her ideas of marriage and why she feels some of her relationships have failed.\n\nThe actress, who has been married and divorced twice — to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008 and to Pratt from 2009 to 2018 — said she feels many people have preconceived notions about marriage that often impact the trajectory of their relationships.\n\n\"When I first got married... most women I think — I don't mean to be gender specific, maybe most people do — there's that checklist of accomplishments,\" she said on the podcast. \"It's like, get married, whatever... I think that there's that youthful [fantasy].\"\n\n\"My brother and I — he's been divorced as well, twice. My parents have this amazing marriage, so you'd think that the odds would be in our favor,\" she continued. \"But we've talked at length about this, and our working theory is that we tried to make a bad thing work because we saw our parents work so well. And so trying to conform to sort of that idea and be like yeah, we got this, we can make that work.\"\n\nShe expressed some issues with the concept of wedding ceremonies and the chaos she feels comes along with them.\n\n\"I also think the ceremony of weddings puts so much pressure on a couple and you make this very public declaration and you spend, whatever, a year planning it and that's all you're focused on and then it's over and it's, like, December 26, that feeling of 'what do we do now,'\" she said. \"And then the embarrassment of divorce.\"\n\nFaris said she feels it's \"easy\" to get married but will never be easy to get divorced.\n\n“The divorce untangling, it takes, you know, a year,\" she said. \"The confusion of the simplicity of the act of getting married, which mentally you understand, 'OK, I’m making a commitment in front of people that I love to be with this person for the rest of my life, that I love,' and then it’s like, you sign a paper.\"\n\nHowever, despite her marriage to Pratt ending, she says the two are in a good place and hope to \"have group Thanksgiving dinners together and to be at that place.\"\n\n\"Do we do that sooner or later?\" she said during the episode. \"Grudge holding is not something that Chris and I do, so, we wanted to make sure, of course, that Jack was happy, but that we were happy and supportive of each other and that we could have this fantasy idea of, do we all spend Christmas together? Do we all vacation together?\"\n\n\"How do we make sure that everybody that we love feels safe, and that we also respect the love we have for each other?\" she continued.\n\nShe said the two share the same goals and they're in a great place.\n\n“Under all of these uncoupling circumstances, I think that we are so good and respectful towards each other, and I think there is so much kindness and love, and I know we want to get to that ultimate goal, and I know it sounds lame and optimistic, but that’s what I want,” she said.\n\nFaris is currently dating cinematographer Michael Barrett and the two even went trick-or-treating with her son, Jack, and Pratt and his fiance, Katherine Schwarzenegger, late last year."
