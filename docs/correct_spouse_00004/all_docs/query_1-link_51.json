        "text": "To Anna Faris, there's a big difference between being a girlfriend and being a girl friend.\n\nFaris explains in an excerpt from her forthcoming book, Unqualified (according to Cosmopolitan), that she never really \"bought\" the idea that her husband Chris Pratt, whom she recently separated from, should be her best friend. \"The idea of your mate being your best friend—it’s overhyped,\" she writes. \"I really believe that your partner serves one purpose and each friend serves another. There’s the friend you confess things to and the friend with whom you do the listening. Or this is the person I talk to when I’m feeling lonely and sad, this is the person I talk to about work shit, and this is the friend I’m still in touch with because we grew up together.\"\n\nFaris calls herself lucky to have a \"handful of women\" who fill these roles and whom she can count on as confidants, including her Mom costar Allison Janney and two friends from childhood. However, she admits wasn't always open to these sorts of close female friendships.\n\n\"I did have some precedent for shying away from packs of ladies,\" she shares. \"Growing up, I fell victim to plenty of mean girls... One day, I went to my locker, and the words \"fuck you, bitch\" were written across it…. That’s why it took me longer than it should have to realize just how important female relationships are.\"\n\nThus, after high school she spent more time hanging out with guys than she did cultivating friendships with other women. \"In my twenties, I thought it was cool to say I was a guys’ girl,\" writes Faris. \"I didn’t realize until later how lame I sounded, bragging as though having a lot of girlfriends was a bad thing.\" She continues, \"The truth of why I didn’t have girlfriends probably had nothing to do with my being a guys’ girl and everything to do with the fact that I was angry and jealous and unduly proud of the guys I was hanging out with.\"\n\nUnqualified will hit shelves in October and, along with this excerpt, include \"more intimate details\" about the actress' life and relationship with Pratt."
