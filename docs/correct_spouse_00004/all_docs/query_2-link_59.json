        "text": "1. Chris Pratt Wrote the Foreword Prior to Their Split\n\nPratt penned the foreword to the book prior to their split and praises his then-wife. \"Anna is an important part of me life and she always will be,\" he writes. \"She asked me to write this foreword. And I'm doing so because I love and respect her and told her I would.\" In the foreword, he compares their similarities and differences and also praises their marriage. He concludes: She’s “a face first dive into the mind and person that I spent one amazing decade with, and will, for the rest of my life, amicably coparent a human.\"\n\n2. Her Fame Contributed to the Martial Issues With Ben Indra\n\nThe actress was first married to Ben Indra before she met Pratt. \"It felt as if we were play-acting at being married,” Anna writes of Ben, adding that after she landed her role in Scary Movie was when things changed between them. \"It never occurred to me that this moment of success could have a negative impact on what was then a budding relationship,” she shares. \"I was singularly focused on my career at that point and Ben repeatedly accused me of putting my work first.\"\n\n3. She Knew Her Marriage Was Over When She Met Pratt\n\nAnna was immediately attracted to Pratt while working on Take Me Home Tonight — and she knew her marriage to Ben was over.\n\n\"I called Ben and told him over the phone that I was leaving him, and then went to set and was like, 'Hey everybody! I just left my husband,'\" Faris confesses. \"Pretty soon I was knocking on Chris' door and was basically like, 'Hi. I’m ready to get boned.'\"\n\n4. She Eloped With Pratt for a Truly Romantic Reason\n\n\"When we finally got together, it was hot and heavy in a way that I'd never experienced before,\" Anna recalls. \"You might think that, fresh off an almost decade long relationship, I would be hesitant to move on to the next, but I couldn’t have fallen more headfirst into my feelings for Chris.\"\n\nThey eloped shortly after Pratt blurted out that he wanted to marry her, just months into their relationship.\n\n“Seemingly out of nowhere he said, 'I just love you so much. I just want to marry you,'\" Faris writes, adding that they decided to tie the knot while in Bali in 2009 for a friends wedding. \"It was a gorgeous ceremony that was just the two of us,\" she writes. \"We had already told our parents that we were probably going to elope, and we’d promised them that we would have a party at home, too.\"\n\n5. She Felt Insecure and Jealous of Jennifer Lawrence and Pratt\n\nHer publicist warned her of what would come from the tabloids when Pratt and J.Law filmed Passengers together.\n\n\"Before they met in person, my publicist, out of the blue, pulled me aside,” Anna writes. “‘Anna, listen there are going to be paparazzi all over them,' she said. 'There are going to be shots of them laughing together on their way to set. There are going to be stories circulating, and you have to brace yourself for this.'\"\n\nThe actress admitted that yes, it was \"totally hurtful\" and that she \"couldn't block them out, either.\"\n\nAnna adds that J.Law even reassured her nothing was going on between them and went out of her way to make Anna feel more comfortable. \"Jennifer and I really are friendly, and she was apologetic even though she didn’t need to be,\" writes Faris, \"because she hadn’t done anything wrong.\"\n\nUnqualified is available for purchase online and in book stores now."
