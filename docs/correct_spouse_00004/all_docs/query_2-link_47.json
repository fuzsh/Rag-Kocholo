        "text": "The INSIDER Summary:\n\nAnna Faris reveals the details about hooking up with Chris Pratt for the first time in her upcoming memoir, \"Unqualified.\"\n\nIn an excerpt published by The Daily Mail, the actress describes how she split from her first husband.\n\nShe writes that she \"desperately\" wanted to sleep with Pratt.\n\nFaris and Pratt met on the set of 2007's \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nAnna Faris opens up about how her relationship with Chris Pratt began in her upcoming memoir.\n\nAccording to an excerpt published by The Daily Mail, the 40-year-old \"Scary Movie\" actress explains how she left her first husband, actor Ben Indra, for Pratt, 38, after meeting him on a film set.\n\n\"Sure, I get to proclaim I didn't f--- Chris before I left Ben, but what is there to celebrate in that? It didn't make me a hero,\" she wrote. \"After all, I wanted to. Desperately. And I had feelings for him obviously even if I wasn't honest with myself about what those were.\"\n\nFaris admits to feeling \"jealous\" of Pratt's relationships with \"background actresses\" while filming the 2007 movie \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nAfter realizing her feelings, she called Indra to end their relationship. At first, he brushed her off as \"just tired,\" but Faris was done.\n\nShortly after, Faris went to Pratt's house \"ready to get boned,\" and writes that their hookup was \"hot and heavy in a way that [she'd] never experienced before.\"\n\nThe couple married in 2009 and welcomed a son in 2012.\n\nAfter eight years of marriage, they announced their split in August.\n\n\"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,\" Pratt wrote on his Facebook. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed... We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\"\n\nThe memoir, written before their breakup, is dedicated to Pratt and features a forward written by him.\n\n\"Unqualified\" will be released October 24."
