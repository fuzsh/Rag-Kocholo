        "text": "Anna Faris is opening up about the unhealthy aspects of her marriage to Chris Pratt. In a new episode of her podcast, Anna Faris Is Unqualified, she chats with Rachel Bilson about what led to her split from the Marvel movie star.\n\n“For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have,” Faris told Bilson during the episode. “In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don’t think it was ever an independent decision.”\n\nFaris says she didn’t have close female friends to confide in before the split, which “stunted” her “in a lot of ways.” “One of them being that I never talked about any issues,” she says. “So to the people, even who I was closest to, I’m sure things were more transparent with my relationship with Ben, but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.” (Before marrying Pratt, Faris was married to Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008.)\n\nPratt and Faris met in 2007 and dated while her divorce was being finalized; they tied the knot in 2009. Faris later gave birth to their son, Jack, in 2012. After nine years of marriage, the Scary Movie star and the Jurassic World actor divorced in 2018. Pratt went on to marry Katherine Schwarzenegger in 2019, and they welcomed daughter Lyla in 2020. Meanwhile, Faris is engaged to cinematographer Michael Barrett."
