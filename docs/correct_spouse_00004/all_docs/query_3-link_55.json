        "text": "Almost four years after her split from Chris Pratt, Anna Faris is opening up about why it may have been such a shock even to those closest to her.\n\nThe \"House Bunny\" star, who was married to Pratt from 2009 to 2017, got candid on Monday's episode of her podcast, \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified.\"\n\nShe began by first explaining how her relationships with other women impacted her romantic relationships.\n\n\"I think it stunted me in a lot of ways,\" Faris said. \"One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people -- even who I was closest to -- I’m sure things were more transparent with my relationship with [first ex-husband] Ben [Indra].\"\n\nShe continued, \"But with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles.\"\n\n\"For me, I think after every breakup, at some point I realize that there were a lot of things I ignored that I really shouldn’t have,\" the \"Mom\" alum said. \"In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don’t think it was ever an independent decision.\"\n\nFaris, 44, and Pratt, 41, first met in 2007 while co-starring in the film \"Take Me Home Tonight\" and began dating shortly after. They got engaged in 2008 and married in 2009. In August 2017, the duo announced their separation and filed for divorce four months later. Their divorce was finalized in October 2018.\n\nThe exes share a son, Jack, who was born in August 2012."
