        "text": "\"In hindsight, it felt like my hand was forced. I don't think it was ever an independent decision,\" Faris said.\n\nFaris and Pratt met in 2007 during a table read for the movie \"Take Me Home Tonight,\" in which they both starred. They became engaged in 2008 and married the following year, staying together until 2017 when they announced their separation. The divorce was finalized in 2018.\n\nOn her podcast, Faris told Bilson that she never opened up to Pratt about any of the struggles she experienced, and that her lack of a group of close girlfriends made it difficult for her to open up to anyone in general.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"I think it stunted me in a lot of ways. One of them being that I never talked about any issues, so to the people, even who I was closest to, I'm sure things were more transparent with my relationship with Ben, but with Chris, I think that we both protected that imagery even within our close circles,\" Faris said.\n\nBefore Pratt, Faris was married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008. Now, Pratt and Faris, who share an 8-year-old son, are on good terms, and Pratt is married to Katherine Schwarzenegger.\n\nMeanwhile, Faris is engaged to cinematographer Michael Barrett, whom she met on the 2018 movie \"Overboard.\"\n\nLater in the podcast, Faris opened up about her past engagements when a caller rang and said she wanted to call off her engagement. Faris agreed.\n\n\"I really feel like calling off an engagement is a smarter, stronger, braver move than what I did,\" Faris said, although she did not specify exactly which engagement she felt that way about.\n\nFaris continued, \"Which was like, well, 'I guess everyone is expecting this, so let's just go through with it.'\""
