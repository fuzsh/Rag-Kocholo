Have an account? .\n\nChris Pratt and Anna Faris were one of Hollywood's most beloved couples.\n\nThe two married in 2009 but finalized their divorce in 2018, although they are still on good terms.\n\nHere's a timeline of their relationship, divorce, and friendship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Pratt and Anna Faris were generally regarded as one of the sweetest couples in Hollywood. They shared their love of dead bugs, their \"ritual\" of Pratt braiding Faris' hair, and her love of feeding him, even as he dropped weight for roles.\n\nThat's why so many were stunned when the couple announced their split on social media. They filed for divorce in December 2017, allegedly because they both had different goals for their family life.\n\nIf you're hurting as much as we are, lick your wounds and take a look back at the couple's love story in happier times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2007: They met on the set of \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nThough the pair grew up in Washington state about 20 minutes away from each other, they didn't meet until they were both in Los Angeles and filming the movie \"Take Me Home Tonight.\"\n\nFaris was still married to actor Ben Indra at the time and the pair has sworn nothing happened while she was still married.\n\nThough they made the film in 2007, the film was released in 2011 after being stalled for the depictions of cocaine use. Pratt shared their love story at the premiere, saying, \"This is a pretty spectacular moment for us, to be able to come to this movie that we met on and fell in love making.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2007: Anna left her husband and Chris said he always knew they'd be together.\n\nFaris and Indra filed for divorce in 2007. Pratt said that he knew she was \"The One\" the moment they met and that once Faris was single, the two of them were going to be together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2007: They had an adorable dating period.\n\nPratt and Faris are two self-described goofballs and it make sense that while they dated, they showed that side off.\n\nPratt recounted how before they were officially dating, he left pornographic magazines out and Faris didn't seem to mind.\n\nOnce they began dating, Pratt also left out his framed African stick bug and Faris told The New Yorker she got emotional because she found someone else who collected dead bugs like she did.\n\nFaris and Pratt also had a day called \"sex-text Wednesday\" where they would designate time to sext each other, she told the AP. That came to an end when she sent a \"small child\" a text about getting drunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2008: They got engaged and Chris got a ring, too.\n\nPratt popped the question to Faris with a gorgeous ring — so gorgeous, in fact, that Pratt got himself an engagement ring, too!\n\nHe eventually upgraded Faris's engagement ring in 2016, telling People magazine that Faris had gotten him a tractor, so they were even.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2009: They got married and there were punches thrown.\n\nThe couple got married in a small ceremony in Bali in 2009. Not much is known about the wedding, but Pratt revealed to Us Weekly that he loved it — even if some punches were thrown.\n\n\"The best parts of my 2009 wedding were seeing my wife with flowers in her hair, the two families coming together, heartfelt speeches — and a pretty great fistfight on the dance floor,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2012: Anna gave birth to their son, Jack.\n\nFaris and Pratt welcomed their son Jack in August 2012, 9 weeks premature. He spent a month in the NICU, and needed hernia surgery, and the pair were told he would likely have special needs.\n\n\"I made promises in that moment about what kind of dad I wanted to be and I just prayed that he'd live long enough that I could keep them,\" Pratt said when relaying the story at a benefit for March of Dimes.\n\nJack had to get cosmetic surgery to correct his eyes, but after that, the couple was able to take him home, and now he has no developmental problems besides needing glasses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2013: Pratt got buff for \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" but Faris preferred him a little softer.\n\nWhile Pratt's 60-pound weight loss for his role in \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" cemented him as a sex symbol, he told Digital Spy that Faris was not a big fan of his new bod.\n\n\"She likes abs, but she likes her fat husband better because she gets to feed him,\" he said.\n\nPratt joked that Faris was a \"feeder.\"\n\n\"She's a feeder and she wants to keep me locked up in the bedroom all fat and eating Kentucky Fried Chicken,\" he continued.\n\nPratt later told Stephen Colbert that Faris missed cooking for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2014: Pratt showed off his braiding skills.\n\nThe internet totally melted when Pratt shared an Instagram post of his French braiding skills.\n\nApparently it was a ritual that Pratt would braid her hair at night before they went to sleep. But the braids were doing too much damage, so Pratt revealed that Faris' mother taught him how to French braid to do less harm.\n\n\"Anna's mom thought a French braid might distribute the pressure,\" he told InStyle. \"She taught me when we were in Hawaii shooting 'Jurassic World.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2015: Pratt said that their relationship made him believe in \"divine intervention.\"\n\nPratt gushed about Faris during a Reddit AMA, saying that because they had so much in common, their relationship caused him to believe in \"divine intervention.\"\n\n\"Anna and I are meant to be together,\" he wrote. \"Our relationship has made me believe in divine intervention and destiny, just as much as my crazy career and the way I fell into this life.\"\n\n\"She and I grew up 20 minutes away from each other but never met until we met in LA. We both got our start in horror spoofs. We both did an animated movie for Phil Lord and Chris Miller,\" he added. \"We both made our careers playing guileless nitwits for laughs. We both have parents that have suffered with MS. The similarities go on and on.\"\n\nPratt concluded that \"Anna is a great wife. Very patient and understanding. Very supportive. So kind and genuine always. And she gave me a wonderful son and family of in laws that I truly love.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2015: They said they dreamed of owning a farm together one day.\n\nFaris and Pratt told Entertainment Tonight that their biggest piece of relationship advice was to keep their \"eyes on the prize.\"\n\n\"These are the work years. The gravy years are to come,\" Pratt said. \"The way we work it out is we just take at least one moment every day to be present with one another. Whether or not we're in the same room, or the same state, or even the same country, we check in, you know?\"\n\nOne of the prizes? Owning a farm together one day.\n\n\"Were so lucky that we have the same sense of humor,\" Faris said. \"We dream about having a little bit of a farm one day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016: Pratt took six months off for \"family time.\"\n\nAfter some crazy years filming two \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" movies, \"Jurassic World,\" and \"Passengers,\" Pratt revealed he was going to take some time off to vacation with his family.\n\n\"I've been on the road for 14 months — I did three movies back to back to back — so I'm taking six months off,\" he told Parade magazine. \"I'm taking Jack to Jack's Beach — which is what we named the little stretch of beach on an island up on the San Juan Islands where we got a place. We're going to go back to the fort we built about a month and a half ago when we went for a short visit and see if that's still there. If not, we're going to build it again.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016: Faris said the tabloid rumors took a toll on them.\n\nThough Pratt and Faris had been stars for quite some time, when Pratt became a leading man, she said she had some tough times with the spotlight.\n\nDuring a conversation with actress Isla Fisher on her podcast \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified,\" Faris said that cheating rumors surrounding Pratt made her feel hurt.\n\n\"I just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me, because I didn't want to think of myself as somebody who could be bothered by tabloid s---,\" she said, according to People magazine.\n\n\"I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris, but having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he's off doing movies and I'm in LA raising our child, of course I'm going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would,\" she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017: Pratt shared some sweet snaps.\n\nWith Pratt's work break, the pair were out of the spotlight for a bit, but kept their #relationshipgoals title by sharing some sweet photos of each other online.\n\nPratt wished Faris a happy Mother's Day in the US and in Europe, while Faris posted a photo of Pratt and their son Jack together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017: They announced their separation.\n\nOn August 6, 2017, Pratt and Faris announced their split on social media.\n\nIn matching social media posts. the pair said that they were \"disappointed\" and asked for privacy.\n\n\"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,\" the post said. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2017: They officially filed for divorce.\n\nThe couple made their break up official when they simultaneously filed for divorce in December, according to TMZ.\n\nDespite announcing their split in August, their divorce papers listed their official date of separation as July 13.\n\nThey both asked in their divorce filings for joint custody of their son Jack and the right to receive child support, but as TMZ noted, it's unlikely either will ask for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2018: The divorce was finalized.\n\nIn October 2018, TMZ reported that Pratt and Faris has officially signed divorce papers with a private judge.\n\nTMZ wrote that Faris' divorce lawyer Laura Wasser requested a private judge from the courts to speed up the process of the divorce.\n\nThe site also reported that the former couple had a prenup, and that they officially requested and were given joint custody of their son, Jack, who was 6 at the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2019: Faris offered to Chris Pratt's wedding to Katherine Schwarzenegger\n\nIn January 2019, Pratt announced that he and his new partner Katherine Schwarzenegger were engaged.\n\nShortly after this, Faris revealed on her podcast \"Anna Faris is Unqualified\" that Pratt texted her to share the news.\n\n\"Chris texted me this morning and he was like, you know, 'I proposed to Katherine last night,'\" Faris said. \"I was like 'Ah! That's amazing.'\n\n\"And I texted him back: 'Just want to remind you, I'm an ordained minister.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2019: Pratt told Insider that he and Faris maintain a healthy relationship \"naturally.\"\n\nIn 2019 while promoting a pop-up Lego cafe as part of the promotion for \"The Lego Movie 2,\" Pratt spoke to Insider's Rachel Hosie about how he maintains a good relationship with Faris.\n\n\"It just happens naturally for us,\" Pratt said, explaining that they ensure to put their son, Jack, before anything else. \"Kids first, it's more important. Kids want to be in a loving household. Put them first, put your kids first. That's the key I think.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2019: Faris said there is still 'so much kindness and love' between her and Pratt.\n\nIn 2019, Faris appeared on the podcast \"Divorce Sucks!\" explaining that although her and Pratt's romantic relationship had ended, their committment, respect, and love for one another had not.\n\n\"We are so good and respectful towards each other, and I think that there is so much kindness and love,\" Faris said. \"It is very difficult to be completely separate from somebody you have spent so much emotional investment with.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2020: Faris congratulated Pratt on his newborn baby with Schwarzenegger.\n\nIn August 2020, Pratt and his wife Schwarzenegger announced the birth of their first baby together, Lydia.\n\nE!
