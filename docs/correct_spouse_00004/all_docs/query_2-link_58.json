        "text": "Anna Faris and Michael Barrett have made things official.\n\nDuring the latest episode of her \"Unqualified\" podcast, the 44-year-old \"Scary Movie\" star confirmed that she and the cinematographer eloped at a courthouse wedding ceremony in Washington state recently, according to media reports. The pair had first started dating a few months after Faris announced her separation from then-husband Chris Pratt in 2017.\n\nIn May 2021, Faris shared rare insight into her relationship with Barrett, who she reportedly met while shooting her 2018 film \"Overboard.\"\n\n\"We had an immediate kind of intimacy,\" she told People in May. \"We're both probably introverts in a very similar way.\"\n\nFaris, who shares 8-year-old son Jack with Pratt, added at the time that she and Barrett have bonded over the fact that they both co-parent kids from previous relationships.\n\n\"He has two children, and that has been awesome,\" Faris said. \"I've really learned a lot about myself through his kids. It's been really rewarding.\"\n\nSurprise, We're Married! Secret Star Weddings and Elopements\n\nEntertainment News\n\nDuring a February 2020 appearance on \"The Late Late Show,\" she confirmed her engagement to Barrett and joked that she would consider officiating her own wedding because she needs \"a lot of attention.\"\n\nFaris, who exited her CBS comedy \"Mom\" last year, wed Pratt in July 2009 in Indonesia, and the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" actor married Katherine Schwarzenegger in June 2019. Faris ended her first marriage to actor Ben Indra in April 2007."
