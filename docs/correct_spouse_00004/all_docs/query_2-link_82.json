        "text": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris used to be one of the most beloved celebrity couples in Hollywood. The pair met on 2007’s Take Me Home Tonight and seemed a match in comedy star heaven as they continued to work together in projects like Movie 43 and What’s Your Number?, before welcoming their son Jack Pratt. It came to a shock to fans when the couple announced their split in 2017, and apparently was a surprise to even their closest friends and family.\n\nRelationships are not easy to begin with, so imagine falling in and out of love in the spotlight. That’s how Chris Pratt and Anna Faris lived out their relationship, and amidst Pratt's skyrocket to fame from Parks and Recreation to Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. Faris recently spoke on the difficulties of divorce as a Hollywood couple, sharing how the end of the relationship felt more sudden then it actually was at first:\n\nAnna Faris shared that she felt like her issues in her marriage to Chris Pratt came as more a surprise to her and those around her because the couple felt like they had to isolate their problems. The 44-year-old actress also spoke to not having a tight-knit group of women friends to bounce off what she was going through during the marriage, perhaps leading to her own ignorance of the problems the relationship faced.\n\nThe conversation occurred on her popular podcast Anna Faris Is Unqualified while speaking to The OC and Hart of Dixie actress Rachel Bilson about heartbreak. Faris and Bilson are longtime friends who share a similar experience, in that they both had relationships and kids with their famous co-stars whom they are no longer with today.\n\nRachel Bilson dated Star Wars’ Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen, for ten years as well (albeit it was more on and off), and had their daughter Briar Rose in 2014 before they split up in 2017. While discussing their experiences with breakups, the actresses spoke about the importance of support systems whether you’re in or outside a relationship, along with how “tunnel vision” one can be when there are problems you cannot see. Faris said this:\n\nPrior to marrying and divorcing Chris Pratt, Anna Faris was married to actor Ben Indra at a time when she was finding her early fame with Scary Movie and Just Friends. While she felt more transparent in that situation, it sounds like there was more pressure surrounding keeping it together with Chris Pratt with their Hollywood fame and child. Ultimately, they are now happier apart, each finding new romances and co-parenting Jack together."
