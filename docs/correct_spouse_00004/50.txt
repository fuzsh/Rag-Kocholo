Chris Pratt and Anna Faris "developed feelings" for each other while she was still married to Ben Indra.

The Guardians of the Galaxy actor - who has been married to the actress since July 2009 - admits he felt a magnetic connection to her when they first met on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in early 2007 even though she was still with Ben, who she started divorce proceedings against in April 2007.

Although there was a definite spark, Chris is adamant the pair didn't "cross the line".

Speaking to the new US issue of ELLE magazine, he said: "It was like magnets. Our personalities meshed, she was a goofball, she liked to have fun, it was impossible to offend her ... We were friends first but she left her husband at the end of the movie, and we started dating when we were back in Los Angeles. So we were friends, and I was there for her. And we had just played love interests, so we had this tight bond spending so much time and spending nights in Phoenix, but we never crossed the line. But we were, I think, developing feelings for each other at the time, you know? The day that she told me she was leaving her husband, I knew I was going to marry her."
