Chris Pratt says he fell in love with his wife Anna Faris while pretending to be in love with her on camera.

The two first met in 2007 on the set of "Take Me Home Tonight" in which they played the romantic leads on screen. Faris was married to Ben Indra at the time.

He told ELLE magazine he first felt a special bond with her on set.

"I just remember thinking, 'Wow, in another life, that's who I want to be with - we would be so good together, I just know it.'"

Pratt says that their special scripted connection didn't fade off camera, but insists they kept things plutonic until Faris left Indra at the end of the movie.

"It was like magnets...we had just played love interests, so we had this tight bond spending so much time and spending nights in Phoenix, but we never crossed the line. But we were, I think, developing feelings for each other at the time, you know? The day that she told me she was leaving her husband, I knew I was going to marry her."

And now they share a life that looks like it came straight out of a movie. The two have been married for six years now and have a two-year-old son together.
