Anna Faris is married and she revealed the news in an unexpected way. The actress let it slip on her podcast, Anna Faris is Unqualified, that she had recently eloped with partner Michael Barrett. "I think we've spent the last year in a place of reflection, in a place of prioritization to some degree, a place of anxiety, a place of assessment," Faris told her guest, matchmaker April Beyer, on her show Monday. "But I'm looking around, so, my fiancé is right. He's now my husband."

Faris didn't intend to share this private life update, though she reveled in the excitement. "I'm sorry… I just blurted that out," the star said while her guests cheered. "I couldn't say fiancé anymore."

The wedding took place on the island of San Juan in Washington at a local courthouse. "It was awesome," she said, while later adding, "Everything about it just felt right."

Anna Faris & Ex-Husband Chris Pratt's Marriage

It's the third marriage for the Mom star, who was previously married to Ben Indra, followed by a high-profile relationship with actor Chris Pratt. The couple, who share 8-year-old son Jack, announced their split in 2017, after eight years of marriage. "Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating," the former couple shared in a joint statement at the time. "We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward."

In a chat with Gwyneth Paltrow, who appeared on her podcast too, Faris spoke about the core issues in her marriage to Pratt. "My two other marriages were with actors and I don't think we did a great job of eliminating competitiveness," Faris noted. "Or at least I didn't, being a proud person, and not wanting to reveal vulnerability."
