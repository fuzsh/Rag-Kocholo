        "text": "Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden Reviews Soldiers of the 85th Battalion\n\nGouy-Servins, France\n\nMarch 9, 1917\n\nIn the centre of the photo wearing civilian clothes is Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. Walking next to the prime minister, to his right, is the commanding officer of the 85th Battalion, Lt-Col. Allison Hart Borden. The soldier with the dark moustache, just behind Prime Minister Borden's shoulder, and looking directly at the camera, is Major Percival Anderson from Big Baddeck, Victoria County, Cape Breton. He was the commanding officer of \"D\" Company. He was awarded a Military Cross for his actions during the battle for Vimy Ridge which took place a month after this photo was taken. Major Anderson was later killed in action at Passchendaele on October 30, 1917.\n\nPhotographer: Unknown\n\nRef.
