Let me say that in several parts of the Treaty, of which this Covenant will form a part, certain duties are assigned to the Council of the League of Nations. In some instances, it is provided that the action they shall take shall be by a majority vote. It is, therefore, necessary to make the Covenant conform with the other portions of the Treaty by adding these words. I will read the first line, and add the words:\n\n“‘Except where otherwise expressly provided in this Covenant,’ is the present reading, and I move the addition of ‘or by the terms of this Treaty.’ With that addition, I move the adoption of the Covenant.”\n\nAmendment of the Japanese Delegation for all the Equality of All Nations Baron Makino (Japan) explains the grounds for the amendment proposed by the Japanese Delegation to the Commission with a view to secure recognition in the Covenant for the equality of all nations and of their subjects:\n\n[Page 292]\n\nSeat of the League of Nations Mr. Hymans (Belgium), speaking in French, makes the following observations on the choice of a Seat for the League of Nations, and on the Covenant as a whole:—\n\nApprobation of the Uruguayan Delegation Mr. Juan Antonio Buero (Uruguay), speaking in French, explains the reasons for which the Covenant meets with the complete approval of the Uruguayan Delegation, in the following terms:\n\n[Page 294]\n\nAmendments of French Delegation to Articles 8 and 9 Mr. Léon Bourgeois (France), speaking in French, proposes amendments to Articles 8 and 9 of the Covenant; in so doing, he explains the principles on which the amendments are based and develops the reasons for which the French Delegation recommend their adoption by the Conference:\n\nMr. Klotz (France), speaking in French, requests that the draft of a Financial Section for the League of Nations may be referred to the League, expressing himself in the following terms:\n\n“I had the honor, at the Plenary Session of the Peace Conference, held on January 25th, of depositing with the Bureau of the Conference the Draft of a Financial Section for the League of Nations. That Draft was referred for study to the Financial Commission, which unanimously accepted its principles and, at its meeting of February 28th, entrusted it for examination to the Sub-Commission charged with the study of Inter-Allied problems.\n\n“The Report of Mr. Montagu, the representative of the British Empire, which was unanimously accepted by the Sub-Commission on March 26th, has been submitted to the Financial Commission at a Plenary Meeting. That Commission, at its meeting of April 5th, unanimously adopted the Report, which it has since sent to the Supreme Inter-Allied Council.\n\n“The Special Committee entrusted with the task of revising the Report of the Commission and of laying its conclusions before the Council of Heads of Governments, annexed to its General Report, which was of a favorable character, the text adopted by the Financial Commission.\n\n“In accordance with the decision of the Council of Heads of Governments, taken at their meeting of April 26th, 1919, I request you to give directions for its reference to the League of Nations.”\n\nApprobation of the Panama Delegation Mr. Burgos (Panama), speaking in French, explains in the following terms the reasons for which the Delegation of Panama grants its cordial approval to the Covenant:\n\nAmendment to Determine the Sense of the Monroe Doctrine Dr. Bonilla (Honduras), speaking in Spanish, proposes an amendment, the purpose of which is to determine the sense of the Monroe Doctrine referred to in Article XXI of the Covenant, following terms:\n\nMr. Pichon (France), speaking in French makes the following declaration in regard to the two amendments moved by Mr. Leon Bourgeois:\n\nMr. Pichon adds:\n\nAfter an exchange of views between Mr. Pichon and the President, it is decided to refer the proposal to the Council of the League of Nations.\n\nObservation of the Portuguese Delegation to the American Proposal Relative to Article 4 Dr. Affonso Costa (Portugal), speaking in French, makes the following observations on the proposal of the President of the United States to carry out the provisions of Article IV of the Covenant by the selection of four Members of the Council of the League:\n\nDr. Affonso Costa therefore deposits with the Bureau of the Conference the following statement:\n\nThe President informs Dr. Costa that due note has been taken of the reservation made by the Portuguese Delegation.\n\nThe proposal made by the President of the United States for the adoption of the Covenant of the League of Nations, together with the amendments moved in the course of the session, is put to vote and carried unanimously.\n\nDiscussion of the Clauses on the Condition of Labor The Agenda Paper provides for the discussion of the clauses on the conditions of labor to be inserted in the Treaty of Peace, and for the presentation of Sir Robert Borden’s amendment.\n\nMr. Barnes (British Empire) explains in the following terms the grounds of the alterations in the clauses to be inserted in the Treaty of Peace:\n\nAmendment of the Clauses to Insert in the Treaty Sir Robert Borden (Canada), proposes in the following terms the amended draft of the nine Resolutions (Annex II (B)).\n\nApproval of the Belgian Delegation M. Vandervelde (Belgium), speaking in French, expresses his approval of the proposed amendment in the following terms:\n\nThe President puts to the vote Sir Robert Borden’s amendment together with the alterations suggested by Mr. Vandervelde.\n\n[Page 319]\n\nThe amendment and the alterations are unanimously adopted. The Session is adjourned at 17.45 o’clock (5.45 p.m.).\n\nAnnex I\n\nReport of the Commission on the League of Nations\n\n1. Terms of Reference\n\nThe Preliminary Peace Conference, at the Plenary Session of the 25th January, 1919 (Protocol No. 2), decided to nominate a Commission to work out in detail the Constitution and functions of a League of Nations.\n\nThe terms of reference of this Commission were as follows:—\n\n“The Conference, having considered the proposals for the creation of a League of Nations, resolved that—\n\n“1. It is essential to the maintenance of the world settlement, which the Associated Nations are now met to establish, that a League of Nations be created to promote international co-operation, to ensure the fulfilment of accepted international obligations, and to provide safeguards against war.\n\n“2. This league should be treated as an integral part of the general Treaty of Peace, and should be open to every civilized nation which can be relied on to promote its objects.\n\n“3. The members of the League should periodically meet in international conference, and should have a permanent organization and secretariat to carry on the business of the League in the intervals between the conferences.”\n\n“The Conference therefore appoints a Committee representative of the Associated Governments to work out the details of the constitution and functions of the League.”\n\nThis Commission was to be composed of fifteen members, i. e., two members representing each of the Great Powers (United States of America, British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan), and five members [Page 320] to represent all the Powers with special interests. At a meeting of these latter Powers on the 27th January, 1919, Belgium, Brazil, China, Portugal, and Serbia were chosen to designate one representative each. (See Annex 6 of Protocol No. 2).11\n\n2. Constitution of the Commission\n\nThe Commission was therefore originally composed as follows:\n\nFor the United States of America:\n\nThe President of the United States of America.\n\nHonorable Edward M. House.\n\nFor the British Empire:\n\nThe Rt. Hon. the Lord Robert Cecil, K. C., M. P.\n\nLieutenant-General the Rt. Hon. J. C. Smuts, K. C., Minister of Defence of the Union of South Africa.\n\nFor France:\n\nMr. Léon Bourgeois, former President of the Council of Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nMr. Larnaude, Dean of the Faculty of Law of Paris.\n\nFor Italy:\n\nMr. Orlando, President of the Council.\n\nMr. Scialoja, Senator of the Kingdom.\n\nFor Japan:\n\nBaron Makino, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Member of the Diplomatic Council.\n\nViscount Chinda, Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of H. I. M. the Emperor of Japan at London.\n\nFor Belgium:\n\nMr. Hymans, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of State.\n\nFor Brazil:\n\nMr. Epitacio Pessõa, Senator, former Minister of Justice.\n\nFor China:\n\nMr. V. K, Wellington Koo, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of China at Washington.\n\nFor Portugal:\n\nMr. Jayme Batalha Reis, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Portugal at Petrograd.\n\nFor Serbia:\n\nMr. Vesnitch, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of H. M. the King of Serbia at Paris.\n\nA request of four other Powers—Greece, Poland, Roumania, and the Czecho-Slovak Republic—to be represented on the Commission was referred by the Conference to the Commission for consideration. Upon the recommendation of the Commission the four following members took their seats on the 6th February:— [Page 321]\n\nFor Greece:\n\nMr. Eleftherios Veniselos, President of the Council of Ministers.\n\nFor Poland:\n\nMr. Roman Dmowaki, President of the Polish National Committee.\n\nFor Roumania:\n\nMr. Diamandy, Roumanian Minister Plenipotentiary.\n\nFor the Czecho-Slovak Republic:\n\nMr. Charles Kramar, President of the Council of Ministers.\n\n3. First Report of the Commission\n\nBetween the date of its appointment and the 14th February, the Commission met ten times. As a result of these meetings the following Draft Covenant of the League of Nations was adopted, and read as a preliminary report by the Chairman at a Plenary Session of the Conference on the latter date. (Protocol No. 3):—\n\n[Here follows draft covenant printed as Annex A to Protocol No. 3, page 230.]\n\n4. Subsequent Meetings of the Commission\n\nThe Draft Covenant of the 14th February was made public in order that discussion of its terms might be provoked. A great deal of constructive criticism followed upon its publication. Further suggestions resulted from hearings of Representatives of thirteen neutral States before a Committee of the Commission on the 20th and 21st March.\n\nThese various recommendations were taken under advisement by the Commission, which held meetings on the 22nd, 24th, and 26th March, and on the 10th and 11th April. At the meeting of the 10th April a delegation representing the International Council of Women and the Suffragist Conference of the Allied countries and the United States were received by the Commission.\n\n5. Final, Report of the Commission\n\nAt the meetings of the 10th and 11th April the Commission agreed definitively on the following text of the Covenant to be presented to the Conference:—\n\nCovenant of the League of Nations\n\nIn order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open, just and honorable relations between nations, by the [Page 322] firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another, the High Contracting Parties agree to this Covenant of the League of Nations.\n\nArticle I\n\nThe original Members of the League of Nations shall be those of the Signatories which are named in the Annex to this Covenant, and also such of those other States named in the Annex as shall accede without reservation to this Covenant. Such accession shall be effected by a Declaration deposited with the Secretariat within two months of the coming into force of the Covenant. Notice thereof shall be sent to all other Members of the League.\n\nAny fully self-governing State, Dominion or Colony not named in the Annex may become a Member of the League if its admission is agreed to by two-thirds of the Assembly, provided that it shall give effective guarantees of its sincere intention to observe its international obligations, and shall accept such regulations as may be prescribed by the League in regard to its military and naval forces and armaments.\n\nAny Member of the League may, after two years’ notice of its intention so to do, withdraw from the League, provided that all its international obligations and all its obligations under this Covenant shall have been fulfilled at the time of its withdrawal.\n\nArticle II\n\nThe action of the League under this Covenant shall be effected through the instrumentality of an Assembly and of a Council, with a permanent Secretariat.\n\nArticle III\n\nThe Assembly shall consist of Representatives of the Members of the League.\n\nThe Assembly shall meet at stated intervals and from time to time as occasion may require at the Seat of the League, or at such other place as may be decided upon.\n\nThe Assembly may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world.\n\nAt meetings of the Assembly each Member of the League shall have one vote, and may have not more than three Representatives.\n\nArticle IV\n\nThe Council shall consist of Representatives of the United States of America, of the British Empire, of France, of Italy, and of Japan, together with Representatives of four other Members of the League. These four Members of the League shall be selected by the Assembly from time to time in its discretion. Until the appointment of the Representatives of the four Members of the League first selected by the Assembly, Representatives of . . . . . . . shall be members of the Council.\n\nWith the approval of the majority of the Assembly, the Council may name additional Members of the League whose Representatives shall always be members of the Council; the Council with like approval may increase the number of Members of the League to be selected by the Assembly for representation on the Council.\n\n[Page 323]\n\nThe Council shall meet from time to time as occasion may require, and at least once a year, at the Seat of the League, or at such other place as may be decided upon.\n\nThe Council may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world.\n\nAny Member of the League not represented on the Council shall be invited to send a Representative to sit as a member at any meeting of the Council during the consideration of matters specially affecting the interests of that Member of the League.\n\nAt meetings of the Council each Member of the League represented on the Council shall have one vote, and may have not more than one Representative.\n\nArticle V\n\nExcept where otherwise expressly provided in this Covenant, decisions at any meeting of the Assembly or of the Council shall require the agreement of all the Members of the League represented at the meeting.\n\nAll matters of procedure at meetings of the Assembly or of the Council, including the appointment of Committees to investigate particular matters, shall be regulated by the Assembly or by the Council, and may be decided by a majority of the Members of the League represented at the meeting.\n\nThe first meeting of the Assembly and the first meeting of the Council shall be summoned by the President of the United States of America.\n\nArticle VI\n\nThe permanent Secretariat shall be established at the Seat of the League. The Secretariat shall comprise a Secretary-General and such secretaries and staff as may be required.\n\nThe first Secretary-General shall be the person named in the Annex; thereafter the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the Council with the approval of the majority of the Assembly.\n\nThe secretaries and the staff of the Secretariat shall be appointed by the Secretary-General, with the approval of the Council.\n\nThe Secretary-General shall act in that capacity at all meetings of the Assembly and of the Council.\n\nThe expenses of the Secretariat shall be borne by the Members of the League in accordance with the apportionment of the expenses of the International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union.\n\nArticle VII\n\nThe Seat of the League is established at Geneva.\n\nThe Council may at any time decide that the Seat of the League shall be established elsewhere.\n\nAll positions under or in connection with the League, including the Secretariat, shall be open equally to men and women.\n\nRepresentatives of the Members of the League and officials of the League when engaged on the business of the League shall enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities.\n\nThe buildings and other property occupied by the League or its officials or by Representatives attending its meetings shall be inviolable.\n\n[Page 324]\n\nArticle VIII\n\nThe Members of the League recognize that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.\n\nThe Council, taking account of the geographical situation and circumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration and action of the several Governments.\n\nSuch plans shall be subject to reconsideration and revision at least every ten years.\n\nAfter these plans shall have been adopted by the several Governments, the limits of armaments therein fixed shall not be exceeded without the concurrence of the Council.\n\nThe Members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave objections. The Council shall advise how the evil effects attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those Members of the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their safety.\n\nThe Members of the League undertake to interchange full and frank information as to the scale of their armaments, their military and naval programmes, and the condition of such of their industries as are adaptable to warlike purposes.\n\nArticle IX\n\nA permanent Commission shall be constituted to advise the Council on the execution of the provisions of Articles I and VIII, and on military and naval questions generally.\n\nArticle X\n\nThe Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression, or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled.\n\nArticle XI\n\nAny war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. In case any such emergency should arise the Secretary-General shall, on the request of any Member of the League, forthwith summon a meeting of the Council.\n\nIt is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.\n\nArticle XII\n\nThe Members of the League agree that if there should arise between them any dispute likely to lead to a rupture they will submit the matter either to arbitration [Page 325] or to inquiry by the Council, and they agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council.\n\nIn any case under this Article the award of the arbitrators shall be made within a reasonable time, and the report of the Council shall be made within six months after the submission of the dispute.\n\nArticle XIII\n\nThe Members of the League agree that whenever any dispute shall arise between them which they recognize to be suitable for submission to arbitration, and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy, they will submit the whole subject-matter to arbitration.\n\nDisputes as to the interpretation of a treaty, as to any question of international law, as to the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of any international obligation, or as to the extent and nature of the reparation to be made for any such breach, are declared to be among those which are generally suitable for submission to arbitration.\n\nFor the consideration of any such dispute the court of arbitration to which the case is referred shall be the court agreed on by the parties to the dispute or stipulated in any convention existing between them.\n\nThe Members of the League agree that they will carry out in full good faith any award that may be rendered and that they will not resort to war against a Member of the League which complies therewith. In the event of any failure to carry out such an award, the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto.\n\nArticle XIV\n\nThe Council shall formulate and submit to the Members of the League for adoption plans for the establishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice. The Court shall be competent to hear and determine any dispute of an international character which the parties thereto submit to it. The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or by the Assembly.\n\nArticle XV\n\nIf there should arise between Members of the League any dispute likely to lead to a rupture, which is not submitted to arbitration as above, the Members of the League agree that they will submit the matter to the Council. Any party to the dispute may effect such submission by giving notice of the existence of the dispute to the Secretary-General, who will make all necessary arrangements for a full investigation and consideration thereof.\n\nFor this purpose the parties to the dispute will communicate to the Secretary-General, as promptly as possible, statements of their case with all the relevant facts and papers, and the Council may forthwith direct the publication thereof.\n\nThe Council shall endeavor to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if such efforts are successful, a statement shall be made public giving such facts and explanations regarding the dispute and the terms of settlement thereof as the Council may deem appropriate.\n\nIf the dispute is not thus settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper in regard thereto.\n\n[Page 326]\n\nAny Member of the League represented on the Council may make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its conclusions regarding the same.\n\nIf a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report.\n\nIf the Council fails to reach a report which is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof, other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League reserve to themselves the right to take such action as they shall consider necessary for the maintenance of right and justice.\n\nIf the dispute between the parties is claimed by one of them, and is found by the Council, to arise out of a matter which by international law is solely within the domestic jurisdiction of that party, the Council shall so report, and shall make no recommendation as to its settlement.\n\nThe Council may in any case under this Article refer the dispute to the Assembly. The dispute shall be so referred at the request of either party to the dispute, provided that such request be made within fourteen days after the submission of the dispute to the Council.\n\nIn any case referred to the Assembly all the provisions of this Article and of Article XII relating to the action and powers of the Council shall apply to the action and powers of the Assembly, provided that a report made by the Assembly if concurred in by the Representatives of those Members of the League represented on the Council and of a majority of the other Members of the League, exclusive in each case of the Representatives of the parties to the dispute, shall have the same force as a report by the Council concurred in by all the members thereof other than the Representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute.\n\nArticle XVI\n\nShould any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles XII, XIII or XV, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.\n\nIt shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military or naval force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.\n\nThe Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimize the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.\n\nAny member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the [Page 327] Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon.\n\nArticle XVII\n\nIn the event of a dispute between a Member of the League and a State which is not a Member of the League, or between States not Members of the League, the State or States not Members of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, upon such conditions as the Council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of Articles XII to XVI inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the Council.\n\nUpon such invitation being given the Council shall immediately institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.\n\nIf a State so invited shall refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, and shall resort to war against a Member of the League, the provisions of Article XVI shall be applicable as against the State taking such action.\n\nIf both parties to the dispute when so invited refuse to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute, the Council may take such measures and make such recommendations as will prevent hostilities and will result in the settlement of the dispute.\n\nArticle XVIII\n\nEvery treaty or international engagement entered into hereafter by any Member of the League shall be forthwith registered with the Secretariat and shall as soon as possible be published by it. No such treaty or international engagement shall be binding until so registered.\n\nArticle XIX\n\nThe Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world.\n\nArticle XX\n\nThe Members of the League severally agree that this Covenant is accepted as abrogating all obligations or understandings inter se which are inconsistent with the terms thereof, and solemnly undertake that they will not hereafter enter into any engagements inconsistent with the terms thereof.\n\nIn case any Member of the League shall, before becoming a Member of the League, have undertaken any obligations inconsistent with the terms of this Covenant, it shall be the duty of such Member to take immediate steps to procure its release from such obligations.\n\nArticle XXI\n\nNothing in this Covenant shall be deemed to affect the validity of international engagements such as treaties of arbitration or regional understandings like the Monroe Doctrine for securing the maintenance of peace.\n\n[Page 328]\n\nArticle XXII\n\nTo those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilization and that securities for the performance of this trust should be embodied in this Covenant.\n\nThe best method of giving practical effect to this principle is that the tutelage of such peoples should be entrusted to advanced nations who, by reason of their resources, their experience, or their geographical position, can best undertake this responsibility, and who are willing to accept it, and that this tutelage should be exercised by them as mandatories on behalf of the League.\n\nThe character of the mandate must differ according to the stage of the development of the people, the geographical situation of the territory, its economic conditions, and other similar circumstances.\n\nCertain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.\n\nOther peoples, especially those of Central Africa, are at such a stage that the mandatory must be responsible for the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee freedom of conscience or religion, subject only to the maintenance of public order and morals, the prohibition of abuses such as the slave trade, the arms traffic and the liquor traffic, and the prevention of the establishment of fortifications or military and naval bases, and of military training of the natives for other than police purposes and the defence of territory, and will also secure equal opportunities for the trade and commerce of other Members of the League.\n\nThere are territories, such as Southwest Africa and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centers of civilization, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the mandatory, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the mandatory as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above-mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population.\n\nIn every case of mandate, the mandatory shall render to the Council an annual report in reference to the territory committed to its charge.\n\nThe degree of authority, control, or administration to be exercised by the mandatory shall, if not previously agreed upon by the Members of the League, be explicitly defined in each case by the Council.\n\nA permanent Commission shall be constituted to receive and examine the annual reports of the mandatories and to advise the Council on all matters relating to the observance of the mandates.\n\nArticle XXIII\n\nSubject to and in accordance with the provisions of international conventions existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the Members of the League [Page 329]\n\n(a.)\n\nwill endeavor to secure and maintain fair and humane conditions of labor for men, women and children both in their own countries and in all countries to which their commercial and industrial relations extend, and for that purpose will establish and maintain the necessary international organizations;\n\n(b.)\n\nundertake to secure just treatment of the native inhabitants of territories under their control;\n\n(c.)\n\nwill entrust the League with the general supervision over the execution of agreements with regard to the traffic in women and children, and the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs;\n\n(d.)\n\nwill entrust the League with the general supervision of the trade in arms and ammunition with the countries in which the control of this traffic is necessary in the common interest;\n\n(e.)\n\nwill make provision to secure and maintain freedom of communications and of transit and equitable treatment for the commerce of all Members of the League. In this connection, the special necessities of the regions devastated during the war of 1914–1918 shall be borne in mind;\n\n(f.)\n\nwill endeavor to take steps in matters of international concern for the prevention and control of disease.\n\nArticle XXIV\n\nThere shall be placed under the direction of the League all international bureaux already established by general treaties if the parties to such treaties consent. All such international bureaux and all commissions for the regulation of matters of international interest hereafter constituted shall be placed under the direction of the League.\n\nIn all matters of international interest which are regulated by general conventions, but which are not placed under the control of international bureaux or commissions, the Secretariat of the League shall, subject to the consent of the Council, and if desired by the parties, collect and distribute all relevant information, and shall render any other assistance which may be necessary or desirable.\n\nThe Council may include as part of the expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of any bureau or commission which is placed under the direction of the League.\n\nArticle XXV\n\nThe Members of the League agree to encourage and promote the establishment and cooperation of duly authorized voluntary national Red Cross organizations having as purposes the improvement of health, the prevention of disease, and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world.\n\nArticle XXVI\n\nAmendments to this Covenant will take effect when ratified by the Members of the League whose Representatives compose the Council and by a majority of the Members of the League whose Representatives compose the Assembly.\n\nNo such amendment shall bind any Member of the League which signifies its dissent therefrom, but in that case it shall cease to be a Member of the League.\n\n[Page 330]\n\nAnnex to the Covenant\n\n1.

Recommendation of the Commission\n\nAt the last meeting of the Commission, the following resolution was adopted:—\n\n“Resolved, that in the opinion of the Commission, the President of the Commission should be requested by the Conference to invite seven Powers, including two neutrals, to name Representatives on a Committee\n\nA.\n\nto prepare plans for the organization of the League,\n\nB.\n\nto prepare plans for the establishment of the Seat of the League,\n\nC.\n\nto prepare plans and the Agenda for the first meeting of the Assembly.\n\nThis Committee shall report both to the Council and to the Assembly.”\n\n[Page 331]\n\nAnnex II\n\nDraft Clauses for Insertion in the Treaty of Peace in Regard to the Conditions of Labor\n\n(A.) Text Proposed by the Commission on International Labor Legislation\n\nThe High Contracting Parties declare their acceptance of the following principles and engage to take all necessary steps to secure their realization in accordance with the recommendation to be made by the International Labor Conference as to their practical application:—\n\n1.\n\nIn right and in fact the labor of a human being should not be treated as merchandise or an article of commerce.\n\n2.\n\nEmployers and workers should be allowed the right of association for all lawful purposes.\n\n3.\n\nNo child should be permitted to be employed in industry or commerce before the age of fourteen years, in order that every child may be ensured reasonable opportunities for mental and physical education.\n\nBetween the years of fourteen and eighteen young persons of either sex may only be employed on work which is not harmful to their physical development and on condition that the continuation of their technical or general education is ensured.\n\n4.\n\nEvery worker has a right to a wage adequate to maintain a reasonable standard of life, having regard to the civilization of his time and country.\n\n5.\n\nEqual pay should be given to women and to men for work of equal value in quantity and quality.\n\n6.\n\nA weekly rest, including Sunday, or its equivalent for all workers.\n\n7.\n\nLimitation of the hours of work in industry on the basis of eight hours a day or forty-eight hours a week, subject to an exception for countries in which climatic conditions, the imperfect development of industrial organization or other special circumstances render the industrial efficiency of the workers substantially different.\n\nThe International Labor Conference will recommend a basis approximately equivalent to the above for adoption in such countries.\n\n8.\n\nIn all matters concerning their status as workers and social insurance foreign workmen lawfully admitted to any country and their families should be ensured the same treatment as the nationals of that country.\n\n9.\n\nAll States should institute a system of inspection in which women should take part, in order to ensure the enforcement of the laws and regulations for the protection of the workers.\n\n(B.) Amended Text to be moved by Sir Robert Borden\n\nThe High Contracting Parties, recognizing that the well-being, physical, moral and intellectual, of industrial wage-earners is of supreme international importance, have framed a permanent machinery [Page 332] associated with that of the League of Nations to further this great end.\n\nThey recognize that differences of climate, habits and customs, of economic opportunity and industrial tradition, make strict uniformity in the conditions of labor difficult of immediate attainment. But, holding as they do, that labor should not be regarded merely as an article of commerce, they think that there are methods and principles for regulating labor conditions which all industrial communities should endeavor to apply, so far as their special circumstances will permit.\n\nAmong these methods and principles, the following seem to the High Contracting Parties to be of special and urgent importance:—\n\nFirst.—The guiding principle above enunciated that labor should not be regarded merely as a commodity or article of commerce.\n\nSecond.—The right of association for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as by the employers.\n\nThird.—The payment to the employed of a wage adequate to maintain a reasonable standard of life as this is understood in their time and country.\n\nFourth.—The adoption of an eight-hours day or a forty-eight hours week as the standard to be aimed at where it has not already been attained.\n\nFifth.—The adoption of a weekly rest of at least twenty-four hours, which should include Sunday wherever practicable.\n\nSixth.—The abolition of child labor and the imposition of such limitations on the labor of young persons as shall permit the continuation of their education and assure their proper physical development.\n\nSeventh.—The principle that men and women should receive equal remuneration for work of equal value.\n\nEighth.—The standard set by law in each country with respect to the conditions of labor should have due regard to the equitable economic treatment of all workers lawfully resident therein.\n\nNinth.—Each State should make provision for a system of inspection in which women should take part, in order to ensure the enforcement of the laws and regulations for the protection of the employed.\n\nWithout claiming that these methods and principles are either complete or final, the High Contracting Parties are of opinion that they are well fitted to guide the policy of the League of Nations; and that, if adopted by the industrial communities who are members of the League, and safeguarded in practice by an adequate system of such inspection, they will confer lasting benefits upon the wage-earners of the world."
