        "text": "Hello TD60\n\nHere is a sampling of information on the Borden Battery. At the moment I have about 2000 pages of research notes on both this battery and the 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade which absorbed it on 8 June 1918.\n\nThe 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade [from the original \"Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1] began recruiting on 11 August 1914 and was formed on 2 September 1914. From its inception, it was totally mobile and hence functionally independent but always tied to higher units and therefore not \"independent\". However, for the majority of action on the Western Front, and given the static nature of the situation, the Brigade functioned more as a co-ordinated machine gun barrage unit and anti-air craft unit but with its own transport.\n\nThere were three original batteries, the Eaton Motor Machine Gun Battery, the Yukon Motor Machine Gun Battery and the Borden Motor Machine Gun Battery. The Borden Battery was also known as the Holland Battery as it was commanded by Major Edward Holland VC. Sir Sam Hughes named the Holland Battery the Borden Battery in honour of the current Canadian Prime Minister - Sir Robert Borden.\n\nLater, these three batteries were merged with 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade (A and B batteries) to form the 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade. The Borden Battery became known officially as \"C\" Battery, however, the members always referred to themselves as the Borden Battery.\n\nHere is an excerpt from their war diary which outlines one reason for their esprit de corps ….\n\nTue., Sep 25, 1917 BARLIN, FRANCE\n\nFine\n\nA General Holiday was declared as the Canadian Corps Rifle and MG. Competition is being held at PERNES this date. Two teams from the 1st C.M.MG. Brig. being entered.\n\nThe results were everything that could be desired. One Gun Team consisted of #45600, Sergt. H. Lewis, 1st C.M. MG. Bgde. with #476344, Pte. J.J. Richardson, #862579, Pte. J.A. Henderson, #919834, Pte. G.W. Kirkup of this Battery, and #910851 Pte. R.C. Spence of the Eaton Motor MG. Battery completing the Team.\n\nThe Gun Team was successful in finishing first place, and won the “Canadian Machine Gun Corps Shield” proving themselves the Premier Machine Gunners of the Canadian Corps.\n\nThe other Brigade Team finished in third place.\n\n--- signed W. C. Nicholson, Capt.,OC\n\n==================================================\n\nDuring the chaos of the Kaiserschlacht [Operation Michael], the 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade [1CMMGB] was dispatched from the Vimy to the Amiens Sector on 6 hours notice and functioned independently along 3 sections of the front under the very loose direction/lack of direction of General Gough's Headquarters from 23 March 1918 until it is brought in to provide some communication, transport and firepower for Carey's Force during the final stand in front of Villers-Brettoneux. During this period the 1CMMGB suffered 50 percent casualties with some batteries such as Borden Battery suffering 93% casualties on 24 March 1918 as part of a hold at all costs action on the west side of Clery-sur-Somme when this 56-man battery blocked the advance of a German division.\n\n==================================================\n\nIn Michael Holden's masters thesis [university of New Brunswick ] and a presented paper [source: http://www.cda-cdai.ca/symposia/2003/holden.htm] he outlined the following:\n\n\"On 14 May, the Motors received instructions, which stated that the brigades were to be engaged the following day in ‘Tactical Training carried out under Corps Orders’. The “live fire” drills were designed to teach the men of 1 and 2CMMGB to think and operate in an open warfare setting. The first day witnessed a relatively simple mobile flanking and pincer movement. The first group created a diversionary head-on attack from the north while other motor machine gun batteries paired with half squads of cavalry from the Canadian Light Horse (CLH) and the Canadian Corps Cyclists Battalion (CCCB) moved in on the position from the east and west. The movements were carried out efficiently and the objective taken very quickly. The following day, the Motors were engaged in another tactical training scheme that required the men to move into a position as if to fill a gap until a replacement infantry brigade could be moved into the line.\n\nOn the 21st of May the tactical scheme changed slightly. Some of the Canadians, including the Motors, now represented enemy forces on the attack against a railway line. The change was effected in order to give the men the semblance of opposition and to help the units along the learning curve, with respect to the observation of offensive operations. There were small communication and initial cooperation problems but overall the general exercise was deemed successful.\n\nIt is important to understand how the CMMGBs trained during summer 1918 because it had a direct influence on their success during the Hundred Days. In May 1CMMGB and 2CMMGB had been involved in two open warfare tactical schemes. The first, the pincer movement was relatively easy. While the assault on the railway proved a little more difficult, it must be remembered that as of 1 May, the Motors doubled in size. Naturally, the brigades felt some ‘growing pains'. Nonetheless, the exercise proved to be very useful. On the 17th of June the CMMGBs fought in a large tactical scheme, this time on the Allied side.\n\nIn this latest exercise the Canadian Corps with an attached mobile force, part of which was comprised by the 1stCMMGB, was sent to reinforce the Allied (British) line and keep the enemy from gaining high ground. The mobile force left its transports, and proceeded to dig in. The Motors used direct and overhead fire to prevent the enemy from establishing a footing in the northern side of a densely wooded area. They were also successful in moving their guns by foot to foil the enemy’s advance on the southern edge of the woods. The defence of the woods finished by mid-day, and the scheme indicated next that a gap had been created to the North and the brigade might be used to great advantage in that location. Consequently, the men quickly returned to their vehicles and prepared for action. The fictitious gap was never deemed to have required CMMGB assistance. The orders were designed to provide an opportunity for the brigade to practice preparation for re-deployment.\n\nDuring July the units took time to learn tactical collaboration with the recently attached sections of 6-inch trench mortars, and practiced using autocars to draw fire and allow the accompanying troops to identify the location of machine guns and points of resistance\n\nA number of lessons were derived from the July exercises. It was found that the use of motor cyclists for scouting and liaison was deficient. During the intra-brigade exercise, defenders did not make proper use of outposts or attached troops to screen and protect the machine gun nests; snipers and enemy patrols had encroached too easily. It was decided that future instruction would revolve around these points. However, this training never occurred. The men were ordered into GHQ reserve and were told that they might be called on to support either the French First Army or the British Fourth Army on the Amiens Front.\"\n\n\"During allied advances beginning on 8 August 1918 wireless became the primary communications for the Canadian Corps. The deep penetrating Canadian Independent Force (based on the Machine Gun Brigade) found that wireless was all that it required. During the 11 days of action Canadians passed 1,400 wireless messages.\"\n\n[sOURCE: http://www.forces.gc.ca/commelec/brhistory/chap3_e.htm]\n\n===================================================================\n\nThe Canadian Expeditionary Force established several \"Independent Forces\" during the latter part of the Great War. Here are some edited excerpts from a 1926 summary of operations of units associated with the 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade.\n\nIn this case, these \"Independent Forces\" were intended to exploit any breaks in the German line during the Last One Hundred Days. The forces were totally mobile and were in direct communication with both Headquarters and overhead aircraft via spark wireless communication. One might say the forefunner of a \"Blitzkreig\" formation.\n\nThe formation of a mobile force for use in offensive operations had been under consideration and it was decided to organize a \"Canadian Independent Force\". This force came into effect on 2nd August, 1918, and was composed of the following units:-\n\nH.Q., Canadian Machine Gun Corps.\n\n1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade.\n\n2nd Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade.\n\nCanadian Cyclist Battalion.\n\n5th Canadian Trench Mortar Section.\n\n1 Corps Wireless Section.\n\nCanadian Motor Machine Gun Mechanical Transport Co.\n\nThe force itself was sub-divided as under:-\n\nH.Q., the Commander; two staff officers, etc.; wireless section; 10 motor cyclists.\n\nArmoured Car Detachment: 4 armoured auto-cars (two from each M.M.G. Bde - 16 guns); 1 platoon cyclists; 10 motor cyclists.\n\nTrench Mortar Section; 2 lorries each containing 1-6\" Newton trench mortar.\n\nNo. 1 Group (1st Cdn. M.M.G.Bde.): 5 motor machine gun batteries (40 guns); 2 platoons cyclists; 20 motor cyclists.\n\nNo. 2 Group (2nd Cdn. M.M.G.Bde.): 5 motor machine gun batteries (40 guns); 2 platoons cyclists; 20 motor cyclists.\n\nNo. 3 Group (Cyclist Bn.): 2 armoured auto-cars (one each from the M.M.G. Bdes.); 4 platoons cyclists; 10 motor cyclists.\n\nSupply Section: ration lorry; ammunition lorry; water lorry; fuel and oil lorry; first aid lorries (2); 5 motor cyclists.\n\nFor the Battle of the Drocourt-Quéant Line: 2nd - 3rd September, 1918, Brutinel's Brigade (consisting of 1st and 2nd Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigades and the Canadian Corps Cyclist Battalion) was withdrawn into Corps Reserve on the 30th August for reorganization. Next day the following units were added to the brigade which was to be re-grouped into the Canadian Independent Force (under control of Brig. Genl. R. Brutinel, C.M.G., D.S.O.) for future operations:-\n\n10th Royal Hussars.\n\nCanadian Light Infantry Horse (less 1 1/2 squadrons).\n\nSix heavy armoured cars (17th Tank Battalion).\n\n30th Battery (8th Army Brigade, C.F.A.)\n\nTwo sections, medium trench mortars, (5th C.D.A.).\n\nOne wireless detachment.\n\nOne supply column.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOURCE: NARRATIVES COVERING OPERATIONS OF The 1st Canadian Motor Machine Gun Brigade, the Canadian Independent Force, the Composite Brigade and Brutinel's Brigade During 1918:- Historical Section, General Staff.

The establishment to be six officers, one warrant officer, one Sergeant Major, eight Sergeants, nine Corporals and forty five privates making a strength of sixty officers and men. This included twenty-two artificers.\n\nThe following officers were appointed\n\nMajor E.J. Holland V.C. in command Nov. 1 - 14\n\nCapt P.A.G. McCarthy 2nd ,, ,, Dec. 16 - 14\n\nLt. W.F. Battersby ,, 16 - 14\n\n,, J.H. Rattray ,, ,, ,,\n\n,, J. R. Ryan Jan. 9 – ‘15\n\n,, C.B. Grier ,, 22 – ‘15\n\nLater by orders from Headquarters, Ottawa the Warrant-officer was struck off the establishment and one more allowed under Lieutenant.\n\n---signed E.J. Holland, Major, O.C. Borden's Armoured Battery.\n\nSat., Sep 4, 1915 SHORNCLIFFE, ENGLAND\n\nThis unit was issued with 18 old SCOTT TRI-CARS which had been used and abused for many months by the R.N.A.S. and there was also issued 5 STUDEBAKER BOX BODY CARS (load capacity 1500 lbs) and 9 new TRIUMPH MOTOR CYCLES.\n\n---signed by E.J. Holland, Major, O.C., Borden's Motor Machine Gun Battery.\n\nMon., Sep 6 to\n\nSat., Sep 11, 1915 SHORNCLIFFE, ENGLAND\n\nThe unit was drilled with the MOTOR VEHICLES making road runs and repairing and tuning up the old SCOTT CARS.\n\n---signed by E.J. Holland, Major, O.C., Borden's Motor Machine Gun Battery.\n\nSun., Sep 12 &\n\nMon., Sep 13, 1915 SHORNCLIFFE, ENGLAND\n\nThis unit was ordered to leave SHORNCLIFFE KENT ENG. for SOUTHAMPTON by MOTOR ROUTE which it proceeded to do making very poor time on account of the condition of the SCOTT CARS. The unit was only able to get as far as HASTINGS the first day and there had to “SCRAP” 2 of the SCOTT CARS as they had not sufficient power to carry them up the grades encountered necessitating towing or pushing up the hills. We Bivouacked at HASTINGS for the night of the 12th – 13th SEPT. leaving HASTINGS at 6 A.M. SEPT. 13th and arriving at SOUTHAMPTON at 5.30 P.M. SEPT 13th just in time to miss the boat for Le HAVRE. The trip from SHORNCLIFFE to Le HAVRE was unsatisfactory in every way owing to the fact hat these old SCOTT machines had been so worn out before being turned over to us that they would make but a few miles at a time without some repairing requiring to be done such as BROKEN CHAINS, LEAKING GASOLINE TANKS, CARBURETTERS AND MAGNETOS out of order. To sum up the machines were in such condition that the unit could not be kept self contained and mobile and taking many hours more than should have been taken and in consequence of which we arrived too late at SOUTHAMPTON to take the boat that night as ordered and had to go to a rest camp for the night.\n\nI wish to record here that the 5 STUDEBAKER CARS issued to this unit were too light for the work required of them and gave no end of trouble during the journey, they could not carry 1500 lbs. and make the hills met with on the ordinary ENGLISH ROAD. We were forced to requisition for a 3 TON TRUCK to carry the surplus Machine Gun Ammunition and spare men and equipment which the STUDEBAKER CARS were supposed to carry and the inability of the SCOTT TRI-Cars to carry their quota of ammunition as they were not fitted with COLT AMMUNITION BOXES added to the necessity of the 3 TON TRUCK.\n\n---signed by E.J.

The Borden Battery is also referred to a \"C\" Battery.\n\nEnemy Advance N. of the Somme.\n\nIt was about 8.00 A.M. March 24th, when the Batteries reached the junction of the MARICOURT - CLERY and HEM - CLERY Roads. At that time a heavy smoke cloud was blowing from the German Lines towards our Lines, but there were few other signs of hostile activity. The Armoured Cars and Transport were stopped just below the Crest of the slightly rising ground between BOIS de HEM and CLERY. Capt. HOLLAND and Capt. NICHOLSON went forward to CLERY and reported to Lieut.-Col. SETTLE, who wished to have 2 Machine Guns placed in the Village, 2 Guns, about 500 yds., left of the Village to fire in the direction of ALLAINES, and 2 Guns, on the slight rise, back of the Village to fire up the Valley of the SOMME in the direction of BIACHES. The Borden Battery, which was ready to go into Action dismounted, was ordered forward, and 2 of its Guns, under Lieut. WEST, were placed in CLERY. Enemy Shelling and Machine Gun Fire had now increased, and before the other Guns got into Action our Infantry were seen falling back over a slight Ridge on the Left of CLERY. On Instructions from Lieut.-Col. SETTLE, Capt. HOLLAND and Capt. NICHOLSON tried to rally the Infantry and with them organise for Defence a Trench running half-way up the Ridge back of the Village. The Infantry Commander, however, issued Orders to fall farther back to a Line just in front of the small Wood E. of BOIS de HEM. The hostile Artillery was now heavily shelling CLERY and the MARICOURT Road and masses of the enemy came out of the Smoke Cloud and were following our retreating Infantry. As soon as the German Troops broke through the Left, the enemy Fire on CLERY Ceased and the village was overrun.\n\n\"B\" Battery and Borden Battery Co-Operation With Twenty-First Division March 24th.\n\nThe 2 Guns of the Borden Battery which were in Action on the Eastern outskirts of CLERY inflicted heavy Casualties on the Germans as their advancing Columns emerged from the Smoke Cloud and rushed forward across the Ridge N. of CLERY. A German Shell blew up 1 of these 2 Guns and either killed or wounded all its Crew. The members of the other Crew had also become Casualties but the Gun was kept in Action by Lieut. WEST and Corporal JOHNSON until the enemy Troops had entered the Village from the N. With the Fire of their Revolvers this Officer and N.C.O. kept the Germans at bay until they were able to get their Gun out of the Village. The Gun was then taken with the other 6 Guns of the Borden Battery and 8 Guns of \"B\" Battery to the top of the Ridge in front of the small Wood, E. of the Bois de HEM. The Machine Guns were placed in Positions on both sides of the CLERY-MARICOURT Road, along an old shallow Trench in front of a strong Belt of Wire. From these Positions the Guns covered by Fire the Valley of the SOMME, CLERY, and the ground to the Left of the Village.\n\nThe Motor Machine Gunners, who had an excellent view of all the Ground in front of them poured an intense Fire into the Ranks of the advancing enemy, breaking up their formation and inflicting heavy Casualties. But, as the Germans continued to approach the Positions, the Infantry who were in the shallow trench fell back. Capt. HOLLAND and Capt. NICHOLSON rallied them again and managed to induce a few of them to return to the Trench to co-operate with the Machine Gunners in the Defence of the Ground. There was, in all, a Garrison of about 100 men in the Trench holding a stretch of 500 yds. The determined Resistance offered by the Motor Machine Gun Batteries at this point considerably delayed the advance of the enemy. The Germans made several unsuccessful attempts to debouch from CLERY and to outflank our Gun Positions from the N. During one of these encounters, when the Germans were approaching on the Left Flank, Corporal JOHNSON was wounded by a Sniper while endeavouring to bring into Action the Gun which he had rescued from CLERY. Capt. HOLLAND was seriously wounded while going out, under direct enemy observation and intense Machine gun Fire, to render aid to a wounded Man in a Shell-hole on front of the Trench occupied by our Machine Gunners and the small group of Infantry. It was largely due to the great example of courage and disregard for personal safety set by this Officer, earlier in the day, that our Machine Gun Detachments with a handful of tired Infantrymen were able to frustrate the efforts at advance made by an enemy overwhelmingly superior in numbers.\n\nHostile Artillery Activity.\n\nIn the meantime, the Shelling on the MARICOURT-CLERY Road had become very heavy. The Motor Transport was ordered back to MARICOURT, and 3 Armoured Cars were taken a short distance back to a bend in the Road to avoid the Shelling. The 4th Armoured Car could not be moved back then, owing to its proximity to a Dump of Explosives which had been set of Fire by a German Shell and was still burning. Eventually the Fire was extinguished, and Corporal HICKS and Private RUMFORD (\"B\" Battery), who had gone back with the other 3 Armoured Cars, returned to start the stranded Car. But, as they approached the Car, a Shell burst beside them instantly killing Private RUMFORD and fatally wounding Corporal HICKS. In spite of the heavy Shelling, Pte. J.A. HENDERSON (Borden Battery) and a \"B\" Battery Man volunteered to start and drive the Armoured Car away. Capt. HOLLAND, Corporal JOHNSON, Corporal HICKS, and several other wounded Men were placed in this Car and taken to the nearest Dressing Station. Capt. HOLLAND dies as he was being moved from the Car to a Stretcher.\n\nCasualties Suffered By M.M.G. Batteries; VII Corps Front March 24th.\n\nOwing to the heavy Artillery and Machine Gun Fire and the great activity of enemy Snipers, the Casualties suffered by \"B\" and \"C\" Batteries in the Forward Trench were extremely heavy. The Gun Positions were very exposed and the Trench was so wide and shallow that Men observing at the Guns were shot through the head. Lieut. SNYDER of \"B\" Battery and Lieuts. WEST and WALDRON of the Borden Battery, who had undertaken the arduous task of observing for the Guns of which they were in Command, were all shot through the head and instantly killed. The Fire of enemy Snipers and Machine Guns prevented the 2 Batteries from maintaining at the guns a proper supply of Ammunition, which was beginning to get very low. The Germans had gradually crept up close to our Gun Positions and were throwing Hand-Grenades into the Positions occupied by the Motor Machine Gunners. 3 or 4 of our Machine Guns had either been blown up or put out of Action by enemy Shells or Machine Gun Bullets. A few Infantry Reinforcements also came up and took up Positions in a fairly good trench behind a strong Belt of Wire. This Trench was about 50 yds. in rear of the Trench occupied by the Motor Machine Gunners. Earlier in the morning, our Machine Guns had been placed in front of the Wire to obtain a better Field of Fire for the guns and enable the Gunners themselves to watch all the movements of the enemy. This bold employment of Machine Guns was entirely responsible for holding up the enemy advance W. of CLERY. During the 4 or 5 hours spent in their Positions in the Shallow Trench in front of the Wire, the Gunners of the 2 Motor Machine Gun batteries were almost constantly firing at groups of Germans and inflicting heavy losses on them.\n\nAt 2.00 P.M. March 24th, the enemy was dangerously close to our Gun Positions, the Ammunition supply was very low, and our Gun Crews had been greatly depleted in numbers. Capt. NICHOLSON, who was then the only officer in Command of the 2 Machine Gun Batteries and the Infantry, decided to withdraw to the Trench behind the Wire. A few Casualties were suffered during this withdrawal, which had to be made under enemy observation and through a narrow Gap in the Wire. In their new Positions, the Machine Gun Detachments were more or less screened from direct enemy observation and they could, therefore, manage to maintain a good supply of Ammunition from a Dump, which had been established on the MARICOURT Road, during the morning. The Infantrymen in this Line belonged to the 15th Cheshire Regiment (Thirty-fifth Division) and were commanded by Colonel COCHRANE. The enemy Shelling was still causing us many Casualties in men and Guns. At about 4.00 P.M., Capt. NICHOLSON had, in all, 4 Guns left; the others had either been blown up or had been put out of Action. With the 4 Guns there were then only 1 Officer. Capt. NICHOLSON had sent a few Messages by Despatch Riders to the Twenty-first Divisional Headquarters and to the 1st C.M.M.G. Brigade Headquarters explaining the Situation and asking for Reinforcements but received no response. At 3.00 P.M., he sent Lieut. INCH back to try and get in touch with Headquarters. In the meantime, Colonel COCHRANE had received Orders to withdraw his Men to a Line running approximately from HEM towards MAUREPAS. The Motor Machine Gunners were to cover this withdrawal, which was to take place at 8 o'clock in the evening. At 5.00 P.M., there were only 2 Machine Guns in Action, manned by 1 Officer, 2 N.C.O.s and a few Men."
