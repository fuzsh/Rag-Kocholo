        "text": "John, just a little more info. that I discovered this morning. This is from Pierre Berton's book, Marching As to War: Canada's Turbulent Years 1899-1953. Now, Berton has been criticized in his own country for being a \"popular\" historian as opposed to an \"academic\" historian. Nonetheless, he had a good team of researchers at his beck and call and, I am sure, reported the situation accurately - even if he didn't bother to footnote his sources.\n\nThe time is June 1918. Herewith from the text:\n\n\"Borden was in London attending a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet when, after hearing Lloyd George railing against Haig, he decided to get Currie's view of the situation. What he heard shocked him. The Passchendaele campaign had had no useful result, Currie told him. 'No advantage in position was gained and the effect was waste'. The venture was by no means worth the cost and was won only 'to save the face of the British High Command who had undertaken all through the autumn most unsuccessful and highly disastrous attempts'.\n\n\"As one example of British negligence and casual indifference on the part of certain corps commanders, Currie told Borden that while his corps has put out 375,000 yards of barbed wire the previous autumn and winter, ..., the comparative British effort had been miniscule. One corps commander told Currie he'd put out only 36,000 yards of wire, a second that he'd put out 30,000 yards, a third that he'd put out no wire at all. One British officer remarked that his men had been mainly employed in laying out tennis courts. That underlined Currie's conviction that the British army was top-heavy with senior officers who were not equal to the responsibility of their ranks.\"\n\n\"Borden was shocked. He took Currie's criticisms to the Imperial War Cabinet and, in an uncharacteristically forthright declaration, hammered home his bill of indictments. Three days before the German counteroffensive began that spring, British intelligence has assured the command that there would be no offensive. There had been 'conspicuous failures to remove incompetent officers' in the British forces. Talented young leaders faced a wall of opposition from the professionals, who refused to promote them above the rank of brigidier general.\"\n\n\"Looking directly at Lloyd George, Borden declared, 'Prime Minister, I want to tell you that if there is a repetition of the Battle of Passchendaele, not a Canadian solder will leave the shores of Canada so long as the Canadian people trust the government of their country to me'\".\n\n\"Borden's blunt action was unprecedented; it is said that he strode across the floor, seized Lloyd George by the lapels of his frock coat, and shook him....This remarkable episode in June 1918, which, somewhat to Borden's surprise, delighted and impressed Lloyd George, would lead, in time, to the Balfour Declaration of 1925 and the Statute of Westminster in 1931 to ensure that Canada and the other original dominions were equals and 'in no way subordinate' to Imperial Britain\".\n\nWhew, that's a lot of typing. The key words clearly are \"it is said that\". As I mentioned earlier, the author did not cite his sources for this popular history in footnotes. Too bad for us. I strongly suspect that the info. comes from Borden's own diaries which were published in two volumes in 1938. I must reread these volumes.\n\nI can see LG being somewhat amused and impressed by Borden's passion. Borden was probably not saying at thing that LG had not said himself many times before.\n\nIn his wonderful biography of Lloyd George, John Grigg writes of the IWC meeting on June 13, 1918:\n\n\"...Borden made a general statement reviewing Canada's war effort in all its aspects. At the end he said that he was convinced the BEF's lack of military success was 'largely due to lack of foresight and preparation, and to defects in the organization and leadership of our forces'. He urged the 'imperative necessity of putting aside every consideration in appointments except efficency'. In this context, he drew attention to the 'high degree of organisation' attained by the Canadian forces 'under officers of whom only a small proportion were professional soldiers', suggesting that if if were true that in the British army only professional soldiers had the chance to rise above the rank of brigadier general 'that was equivalent to a wholesale scrapping of the brains of a nation in its struggle for existence'\".\n\n\"According to Hankey, Borden's 'plain speaking' had been prompted by Smuts. Lloyd George of course welcomed it wholeheartedly....\""
