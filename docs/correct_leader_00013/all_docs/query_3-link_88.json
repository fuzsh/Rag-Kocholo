        "text": "White Paper: A Parliamentary Primer and the Centrality of Politics\n\nIn Canada, the federal parliament and the provincial assemblies are the legislative arms of the state. They are the focal point for the organization of political parties and debate and for regular democratic elections. Through the electoral process, citizens determine which party, and consequently which party leader, they wish to guide the federal or provincial government for a maximum five-year term. Once elected to office by winning a majority or at least a plurality of the seats in parliament or the legislature or assembly, the leader of the winning party will usually be called upon by the governor general—or by the lieutenant-governor in a province—to form a government. This is accomplished by the party leader, now the prime minister or premier, choosing a cabinet. The governing party then takes control of the executive and administrative institutions of the state and undertakes its responsibilities in policy making and program implementation.\n\nAs the governing party fulfills its duties, its actions will be scrutinized closely by opposition parties, those that won some level of representation in parliament or the legislature. Such representation comes with an institutionalized accountability function: the parliamentary opposition holds the governing party to account for its exercise of power. In parliamentary theory and practice, the government (the executive branch) must be accountable to parliament or the provincial legislature (the legislative branch) for all its actions. Ministers of the Crown must sit in the legislature and be prepared to answer questions about how they conduct government business, to debate the merits and demerits of new policy and administrative initiatives, and to have all new legislation reviewed and voted on by the members of parliament or the legislative assembly.\n\nThis brief overview of parliamentary procedure is a reminder of the centrality of politics to how any government functions and marks a fundamental point of distinction between the public and private sectors. At the core of public sector management is politics. Governments rise and fall, prime ministers and premiers come and go, and approaches to policy, policy making, and program implementation wax and wane. Everything governments do, and don’t do, can be reduced to political explanations because governments are forged out of party politics and democratic elections. Their behaviour is always judged in a political forum, and any assessment of their decision making is inherently political.\n\nCanadian Parliaments, 1921–88, % by Major Parties\n\nLiberal Conservative/PC CCF/NDP Vote Seats Vote Seats Vote Seats 1921 41 49 30 21 – – 1925 40 40 46 47 – – 1926 46 52 45 37 – – 1930 45 37 49 56 – – 1935 45 71 30 16 9 3 1940 52 74 31 16 9 3 1945 41 51 27 27 16 11 1949 49 74 30 16 13 5 1953 49 64 31 19 11 9 1957 41 40 39 42 11 9 1958 34 18 54 79 10 3 1962 37 38 37 44 14 7 1963 42 49 33 36 13 6 1965 40 49 33 36 18 8 1968 45 58 31 27 17 8 1972 38 41 35 40 18 12 1974 43 53 36 36 16 6 1979 40 40 36 48 18 9 1980 44 52 33 37 20 11 1984 28 14 50 75 19 11 1988 32 28 43 57 20 15\n\nCanadian Parliaments, 1993–2000, % by Major Parties\n\nLiberal PC Reform/AllianceNDP BQ Green Vote Seats Vote Seats Vote Seats Vote Seats Vote Seats Vote Seats 1933 41.3 60.0 16.0 0.7 18.7 17.6 6.9 3.1 13.5 18.3 6.88 – 1997 38.5 51.5 18.8 6.6 19.4 19.9 11.0 7.0 10.7 14.6 0.43 – 2000 40.8 57.1 12.2 4.0 25.5 21.9 8.5 4.3 10.7 12.6 0.81 –\n\nCanadian Parliaments, 2004-21, % by Major Parties\n\nLiberal Conservative NDP BQ Green People's Party Vote SeatsVote SeatsVote SeatsVote SeatsVote SeatsVote/Seats 2004 36.7 43.8 29.6 32.1 15.7 6.2 12.4 17.5 4.29 – – 2006 30.2 33.4 36.3 40.3 17.5 9.4 10.5 16.6 4.48 – – 2008 26.2 25.0 37.6 46.4 18.2 12.0 10.0 15.9 6.78 – – 2011 18.9 11.0 39.6 53.8 30.6 33.4 6.0 0.1 3.91 – – 2015 39.5 54.0 31.9 29.9 19.7 13.0 4.7 3.0 3.4 0.3 – 2019 33.1 46.4 34.4 35.8 15.9 7.1 7.7 9.5 6.5 0.8 1.6 / - 2021 32.6 47.3 33.7 35.2 17.8 7.4 7.6 9.4 2.3 0.5 5.0 / -\n\nSource: Reports of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada.\n\nCase Study: Assessing the Legacy of Stephen Harper\n\nWhile opponents would grudgingly admit that Stephen Harper proved remarkably able in turning many of his policy ideas into reality, especially in cutting taxes, diminishing the role and stature of the federal public service, deregulating the economy, promoting the oil and gas industry, increasing the funding to and role of the Canadian military, and establishing much tougher anti-crime legislation, he did so through a very tightly controlled command approach to prime ministerial leadership that critics consider excessive, abusive, close-minded, or worse. The charges against both the style and substance of Stephen Harper’s approach to governing are legion. Critics such as Lawrence Martin (2010), Michael Harris (2014), Donald Savoie (2015), and Bob Rae (2015), to name just a few, accused this prime minister of:\n\nconcentrating excessive power in his own hands and in that of his PMO;\n\nrendering cabinet government next to meaningless;\n\nstripping ministers and caucus members of their independent voices;\n\nbeing, in Michael Harris’s words, “a party of one”;\n\nstripping the federal public service of its important role in the policy process;\n\nbasing policy decisions more on ideological beliefs than on evidenced-based research;\n\nusing distortion, deceit, manipulation, and outright lies to support his policy actions;\n\nbeing contemptuous of parliament;\n\noverturning a half-century of balanced Canadian diplomacy; and\n\nbeing a threat to Canadian democracy.\n\nIn his critical biography of Stephen Harper, Michael Harris (2014) accused Harper of being a “rogue prime minister,” one who is authoritarian, manipulative, cynical in his hyper-partisanship, secretive, contemptuous of those who disagree with him, and, perhaps worst of all, a direct threat to Canadian democracy. In a similar vein, Lawrence Martin (2010, 272), stressed that Harper, in power, had “circumvented the conventions of democracy so much” that academics were beginning to say that Harper’s “abuse of executive power is tilting toward totalitarian government and away from the foundations of democracy and the rule of law, on which this country was founded.” Bob Rae (2015), admittedly a political opponent of Prime Minister Harper, attacked his leadership for being contemptuous of parliamentary democracy. Rae noted the Harper government’s serial use of massive omnibus budget bills as a means of passing large numbers of unrelated legislative matters with limited parliamentary review and debate leading to a single Yes or No vote. “A 2012 budget bill,” Rae charged, “changed seventy laws, gutted environmental protection, killed off a multitude of agencies, and raised the age of retirement from sixty-five to sixty-seven. Shortly after introducing the bill, the government limited debate and this massive, four-hundred page monstrosity headed to committee for a pro forma discussion” (109). Canadians, Rae stressed, should have been outraged by the Harper government’s increasing streak of authoritarianism and disrespect for Canadian democratic traditions. In summing up his assessment of nine years of Stephen Harper’s leadership of this country, Rae concluded that “[w]e’re now living in a democracy with dictatorial tendencies, and Canadians should not see their democratic institutions diluted and muzzled because of political timidity” (110).\n\nBut in his biographical study of this prime minister, John Ibbitson (2015), a more sympathetic conservative analyst, found Stephen Harper to be a man of various shades of grey. His character, according to Ibbitson, is authoritarian, cold and Machiavellian, “the most controlling prime minister in Canadian history” (251), and he is a man committed to the support of core conservative ideas. Stephen Harper has been the most ideological of all Canadian prime ministers, and to Ibbitson, this is what made Harper such a lightning rod of discontent to Canadians who do not share his ideological vision. “One of the fundamental priorities of the Harper government,” writes Ibbitson, “is to shrink the size of the state. Permanently. Shrinking the size of the state is Harper’s greatest imperative. It is what makes him a genuinely conservative prime minister.… It is perfectly reasonable to object to all of these measures. But it is not reasonable to expect a conservative government not to act like a conservative government” (262).\n\nWhite Paper: Historical Evolution of Canadian Political Culture\n\nAs the text highlights, throughout the twentieth century Canada witnessed a fascinating evolution in our political culture. While the fourth edition of Thinking Government provides an overview of this history, we provide below a more detailed review of these changing times and evolving ideas. We are very much the inheritors of these ideological battles and the political culture they have shaped.The following section of material is taken from the third edition of Thinking Government.\n\nThe Laissez-Faire Decades\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century Canadian political culture was dominated by conservative, laissez-faire principles, supportive of free enterprise, a largely unregulated private sector, and a very small state with a limited social and economic role. This was the era of the “night watchman” state; most people, and thus the two main political parties, wanted the state to provide basic public security and infrastructure services (policing, national defence, roads, harbours, railways, and sanitation), supported by minimal taxation. A federal income tax system was not introduced until 1918 and then only as a “temporary” wartime measure.\n\nIn those years the centre of Canadian politics was essentially what we today think of as on the right of the political spectrum, and notwithstanding the gradual emergence of the labour, agrarian populist, and socialist movements that would lead to the creation of the CCF in 1933, the Conservative and Liberal Parties shared a broadly similar conservative orientation to the nature of society, touting the importance of individualism, the sanctity of private property, the virtues of free enterprise, and the wisdom of a limited and restrained public sector. While the Conservatives possessed a Red Tory heritage dating back to the relatively active statist policies of the Macdonald government, the party under Robert Borden in the 1910s came to hold more conservative values, as had the Liberal Party of Wilfrid Laurier in the first decade of the century. Significant political differences emerged only in matters of party leadership and policy relating to the French–English question, Canadian–American relations, and Canada’s position within the British Empire (Campbell and Christian 1996, 27–33).\n\nCanadian political culture slowly altered in the 1920s when the federal Liberal Party came to endorse reform liberalism as its credo. This leftward shift can be attributed both to Mackenzie King’s strongly held views about the philosophical importance and moral virtue of reform liberalism and to the Liberals’ sense of a political reorientation among a majority of Canadians in favour of a modest centre-left approach to social and economic life. In other words, they sensed that the broad political centre was itself shifting from the solid right to the soft left.\n\nThe Effects of Depression and War\n\nWhile this political shift was reflected more in party platform than in Liberal government policies and programs during the 1920s and 30s, the prolonged economic collapse, widespread poverty, and social malaise of the Great Depression reinforced Mackenzie King’s support for reform liberalism and created the social conditions for the emergence of a serious and persistent political threat from the left. The CCF became an organized and articulate voice of democratic socialism, and in the 1930s and 40s it came to be viewed by the Liberals as their greatest long-term threat.\n\nGrowing public belief that the state could and should demonstrate capable and progressive leadership was only enhanced by the experience of World War II (Campbell and Christian 1996, 77–83). Over the six years of conflict the country operated under a state-directed command economy in which all sectors of society—public, private, and voluntary—worked toward a common goal. The war years witnessed not only the creation of a remarkable Canadian military capacity but also the development of a powerful industrial economy operating at full employment and directed, by the state, to serve a great national crusade. The war years brought increasing wealth and prosperity, growing unionization of the industrial workforce, and the involvement of women in this workforce.\n\nMost important, it was the state itself, in the form of the federal government, that emerged from the war years as a driving force in the life of the country. It had demonstrated that it could overcome difficult challenges through the exercise of firm, competent, and visionary leadership. Through its wartime actions the government showed that the immense material resources and wealth of the nation could be used to achieve large ends when strategically directed to common goals. For many Liberals the war demonstrated that Keynesianism worked and that the state could deploy public resources to address serious social problems such as unemployment, poverty, hunger, lack of shelter, lack of education, and lack of hope.\n\nThe end of the war marked the beginning of modern Canada. The government of Mackenzie King heralded the modern Canadian state through policy initiatives launched during the war or shortly after:\n\na national unemployment insurance system (1940)\n\nfamily allowance payments (1945)\n\nnational labour relations system recognizing the legality of trade and industrial unions, unionization, and collective bargaining between union and management (1944)\n\nThese initiatives were a prelude to the amazing growth of the federal state in Canada after the war.\n\nThe Liberal Party controlled the federal government for 33 years between 1945 and 1984 (Table 2.2). Despite the Progressive Conservative governments of John Diefenbaker and Joe Clark, it came to be popularly viewed as the “natural governing party.” Successive Liberal governments under St. Laurent, Pearson, and Pierre Trudeau built the modern welfare state and mixed economy that have defined Canadian politics and government and have been imitated, to various degrees, by all the provincial governments. In a period marked by a seemingly ever-growing economy, steady industrialization, increasing trade and commerce, and an ever-wealthier society with a burgeoning middle class, federal and provincial governments possessed budgetary surpluses and seemed able to address almost any social and economic problem through the application of state power. Indeed, it was Pierre Trudeau who best captured this sense of optimism, purpose, and capability when, in the federal election of 1968, he stated that the prime objective of his Liberal government would be nothing less than the creation of the “just society” (Campbell and Christian 1996, 86–93).\n\nLess, Not More, Government—Again\n\nWhile the centre of political opinion in Canada, as throughout the Western world, was clearly grounded in the terrain of modern liberalism in the three decades following World War II, by the late 1970s a change became apparent. By then the national economy had begun to experience serious problems of “stagflation”—an unhealthy combination of inflation and stagnant economic growth. The results were increasing unemployment, declining economic growth and productivity, mounting labour unrest, rising consumer prices, and falling consumer and business confidence as fears of recession came to replace economic optimism. People began to worry about their ability to provide basic necessities for themselves, let alone attain “the good life,” and about the ability of their governments to manage the economy and lead society to a brighter future.\n\nThis led to growing disenchantment with government and, in the late 1970s and early 80s, to a conviction within the political right not only that government had failed in its attempt to lead the economy but also, more pointedly, that the idea that any government could or should engage in macro-economic management was fallacious. Keynesianism was attacked by conservative critics, who complained that government was not a solution to growing economic and social tensions but in fact a major cause of the problems.\n\n“Less, not more, government” became the conservative mantra, with the concomitant position that more business-friendly, private sector-oriented policies would promote economic growth. From this viewpoint the desired government was one that would rein in a bloated and incompetent state, “freeing enterprise” to get on with the task of building a strong and viable economy (Woolstencroft 1996).\n\nCase Study: The Mulroney Government\n\nBy the early 1980s, conservatives in Canada were buoyed by the electoral successes of their counterparts elsewhere. Both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain and President Ronald Reagan in the United States preached a return to traditional conservative values associated with individual responsibility and initiative, free enterprise, the protection of private property, the importance of competition, the key role of the private sector, and the need to radically diminish the size and scope of the public sector in order to regain control over public finances while advancing the interests of business. The re-emergence of conservative thought to a level of great prominence and influence in Canadian political life, however, was relatively slow and marked by some ironic twists.\n\nThe last Pierre Trudeau government, of 1980–84, was marked by confusion and lack of direction in the energy sector, leading to dramatic policy reversals with the National Energy Policy (NEP). In a major sign of a rightward shift, Brian Mulroney and the Progressive Conservative Party won the federal election of 1984. This new government came into power promising to restore economic confidence in the country through the traditional conservative policies of free enterprise, individualism, competition, and support of the private sector. As a fundamental part of this reorientation, it pledged to reduce the role of the federal government in Canadian life through rigorous programs of privatization of Crown corporations, deregulation of the economy, and federal government downsizing and fiscal restraint. All such initiatives were held to be beneficial and necessary in and of themselves, as well as leading to the elimination of the growing federal deficit and the reduction of the national debt. But the record of the Mulroney government with respect to these broad economic and political goals is decidedly mixed.\n\nPrivatization, Deregulation, and Free Trade\n\nMulroney’s government did engage in a major program of whole or partial Crown corporation privatization, among them Air Canada, de Havilland, Canadair, Canadian National Railways, Canadian Arsenals Limited, and Petro-Canada. It also pursued major initiatives to deregulate the Canadian economy by loosening federal economic and environmental regulation and shrinking federal agencies charged with monitoring private sector adherence to regulatory rules. The elimination of the NEP, the reconstitution of FIRA into Investment Canada—a body designed not to screen and restrict but to encourage mainly American foreign investment into the country—and the diminution of the Canadian Transport Commission and its eventual reconfiguration as the National Transportation Agency all indicated this new push for a smaller and less onerous state regulatory presence within the Canadian economy (Gollner and Salée 1988).\n\nOf course, the most fundamental reordering of the Canadian economy and the role of both federal and provincial governments was the ratification of the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on January 1, 1989, following some three years of difficult bilateral negotiations and fractious political debate. This agreement—expanded into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in the early 1990s to include Mexico—endorsed market economics, a lead role for the private sector, and economic efficiency and corporate profitability as key goals of society. It condemned the impact of government regulation on the economy as generally deleterious (Belous and Lemco 1995; Walker 1993). These agreements boosted the interests of private sector entrepreneurialism and trade while restricting the range of policy instruments and actions available to all governments to regulate the economy and establish national or subnational (provincial or state) economic support programs. The push for free trade was part of a broader conservative agenda, furthered by political actors in all three countries to institutionalize this pro-market, free enterprise, less-government approach throughout the continent.\n\nGiven the decidedly ideological orientation of free trade policy, and the real and potential limitations that such a policy implies for specific government initiatives and the general role of the state in society and the economy, it is no surprise that the free trade issue dominated the life of the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The federal election of 1988—the infamous free trade election—was one of the most bitterly fought and divisive in Canadian history. John Turner, the federal Liberal leader at the time, called his opposition to the FTA “the fight of my life,” and the televised leaders’ debate on the issue still stands as testament to the passion that can indeed infuse Canadian politics.\n\nHow Conservative Is Conservative?\n\nPrivatization, deregulation, and free trade policy stand as exemplars of the Mulroney government’s conservative vision. Yet the conservative record of his government is debatable. Many conservative critics of the Mulroney government—notably Preston Manning, Stockwell Day, and others who would eventually rally to the Reform Party—claimed that this government was not conservative enough, not sufficiently true to conservative principles and practices, and that, in fact, it was still excessively liberal-centrist in many ways.\n\nThat centrist tendency was most pronounced in the field of federal expenditure policy. Far from constricting spending, as conventional conservative thought advocated, the fiscal record of the Mulroney government was one of ever-increasing federal expenditure, higher annual deficits and debt loads, and greater reliance on public borrowing. In 1985–86, the first full year of the Mulroney government, total federal budgetary expenditures stood at $109.8 billion, with an annual deficit for that year of $33.4 billion; by 1992–93, its last year, total federal budgetary spending stood at $159.3 billion, with a deficit of $39.0 billion. Notwithstanding its public exhortations for government to be more economical and efficient, the public service more frugal and able to do more with less, and Canadians overall more self-sufficient and less inclined to look to government for solutions to social problems, this Progressive Conservative government was consistently unwilling to put the harsh medicine of rigorous and persistent fiscal restraint into practice.\n\nThis tactic ultimately paid the governing party no political dividend. To many conservative-minded Canadians, the disconnect between conservative principles and rhetoric on one hand, and the centrist, traditionally liberal fiscal approach of the Mulroney government on the other, simply demonstrated that the Progressive Conservatives could no longer be trusted to advance a conservative agenda in Ottawa. This position was most strongly advocated by Preston Manning and the emergent Reform Party. To many liberal and social democratic-minded Canadians, however, the policy legacy of the Mulroney government—its advocacy of privatization, deregulation, and free trade—suggested that Canadian politics, government, and society were becoming increasingly subject to American values and government practices. These people distrusted almost every move of the Mulroney government, and they disparaged any claim made by the prime minister that his government was one of the moderate centre-right.\n\nThe political result of such a decline in support from both the right and the centre-left was the electoral rout of the party in the federal election of 1993. The once-mighty PCs dropped from 151 seats nationwide to just 2—a staggering and historic defeat.\n\nCase Study: The Chrétien Government\n\nIt is ironic that the profound shift to the right by the federal government in the 1990s was undertaken by the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien, but the irony fades when one appreciates the political context (Campbell and Christian 1996, 103–7; Clarkson 1996; Dobrowolsky 2000).\n\nIn the general election of 1993, the Liberal Party campaigned on a rather vague platform of centre-left platitudes, as enunciated by its Red Book:\n\nto restore honesty and accountability to public life;\n\nto promote the social and economic well-being of all Canadians, not just a privileged few;\n\nto protect the Canadian social welfare system, including the creation of a national day care program;\n\nto reinvest in public infrastructure;\n\nto eliminate the GST and replace it with a fairer consumption tax;\n\nto reopen and renegotiate the terms and conditions of free trade with the Americans to better promote Canadian national interests; and\n\nto promote governmental fiscal stability and deficit reduction by encouraging a growing economy and undertaking cautious cutbacks in areas of obvious government waste and mismanagement.\n\nIn particular reference to the federal deficit, the Red Book committed a new Liberal government to reducing the deficit to three per cent of gross domestic product, roughly $25 billion. Once in power, though, this centre-left agenda was quickly displaced by a more conservative orientation, as the government moved decisively to the centre-right in its policies and programs.\n\nChrétien’s new government quickly sensed that the ideological centre of Canadian politics was shifting further right, as most citizens (as documented through both government and privately commissioned public opinion polling) feared that the federal deficit, debt, and size of government were major problems that had to be resolved before any new socio-economic reform projects could be advanced. Such expressions of conservative public opinion were, in turn, often encouraged and advanced by other actors and forces within the realm of public policy discussion: the national and regional media; business advocacy organizations such as the C.D. Howe Institute, the Business Council on National Issues (now the Canadian Council of Chief Executives), the Canadian Manufacturers Association, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and a collection of more specialized business support groups; and the Reform Party and remains of the Progressive Conservative Party. Among the broader forces felt by the Chrétien government were those of the American bond-rating agencies that were instrumental in setting the credit-worthiness of the Canadian federal government, the fear of fiscal collapse if the government could not borrow money at a reasonable rate of interest, and the general pressure of mainstream business influence and conservative thought in the face of such dire fiscal difficulties.\n\nSlaying the Deficit\n\nIn this political environment of high federal deficits and debt, of a still large state presence in the economy, and of a strong rightward bent in public opinion with regard to politics and government, it is no surprise that the Liberal government under Jean Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, made the elimination of the deficit its top priority in its first term of office. Martin had always been on the right wing of the Liberal Party, more a business liberal than a social liberal, and had always advocated prudent fiscal management in the affairs of the federal government. In the 1990s, this future prime minister became the second most powerful figure within the government, and his belief in the necessity of deep and persistent budget cuts aimed at eliminating the federal deficit altogether came to represent the government’s overall approach to financial management. As Martin famously remarked in 1995, “We are in hock up to our eyeballs,” and, in reference to the budgetary target of reducing the deficit to $25 billion from $42 billion over three years, “It is a target we will meet come hell or high water” (Greenspon and Wilson-Smith 1997, 203–4).\n\nIn essence, the Liberal government took the rhetoric of the previous Progressive Conservative government and turned it into policy and program reality. Whereas the Mulroney government had been perceived as merely paying lip service to fiscal restraint, the Chrétien government was committed to actually restoring fiscal prudence to Ottawa by aggressively reducing and ultimately eliminating the budget deficit. The federal coffers moved to balanced and then surplus budgets. This policy approach allowed the government to express its sober concern for the deficit/debt crisis facing the country and to brag about its rigid fidelity to tough financial management as the way to resolve the problem. Eventually it gained fiscal room to proceed with policies of debt reduction, tax cuts, and new socio-economic spending programs.\n\nHow Liberal Is Liberal?\n\nIn the short term, the Liberals moved to the right in tandem with the centre of Canadian politics. This allowed them to continue to lay claim to the centre ground of political life as the party and government that could be trusted to serve the interests of most Canadians in continuing to provide intelligent yet prudent approaches to policy and program development, coupled with fiscal restraint. Once the deficit had been overcome, and if and when the political centre began to move back toward the centre-left, they would be well positioned.\n\nAll such reforms, moreover, dramatically affected the nature of public sector management. As the federal government retrenched, the structure and mission of the public service were subject to great change and subsequent unease and dispute. As Canadian society generally, and its federal government in particular, swung to the right in the 1990s, the federal public service and all its provincial counterparts assumed a downsized policy and program role.\n\nThe public sector experienced serious cutbacks to financial and personnel resources, only to hear further calls to do more with less. Generalized policies of restraint, privatization, and deregulation also led governments to strip departments and agencies of roles they had long administered as essential public services; in this sense, some restraint policies called for the public sector to do less with less. Other policies demanded that the public sector interact with the private sector in more innovative and supportive ways, upholding the private sector as the principal motor of national economic growth and applying private business practices to public sector services.\n\nAll such changes elicited great debate about the best public sector management practices and how the sector should relate to private business and to individual citizens. These issues remain at the forefront of political debate about the future of this country and the direction of its governments.\n\nCase Study: The Martin Government\n\nOnce the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien tamed the deficit, a new era of balanced budgets and surpluses opened new opportunities for the Liberals to redefine who they were, what they believed in, where the federal government should be leading the Canadian people, and to what ends. When Chrétien retired in the fall of 2003 and Paul Martin became prime minister, the future looked rosy for the governing party. But how quickly fortunes can change.\n\nThe Martin government sought to maintain a liberal centrist policy position that offered fiscal discipline with social progressivism by promising to\n\nto focus on tax cuts;\n\nto pay down the national debt;\n\nto support “business-friendly” economic and regulatory policies;\n\nto enhance Canada’s national defence, security, and intelligence capabilities;\n\nto maintain a restrained, less interventionist state presence; and\n\nto support core social and economic policies such as national health care, employment insurance, regional equalization, regional development policies, and substantial federal transfers to the provinces with respect to health, postsecondary education, and social assistance programs.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Martin signed a health policy accord with all the first ministers that would witness a transfusion of $75 billion in federal funds over ten years into provincial health care systems. His government also focused on the need to reinvest in cities, to support postsecondary education, to protect the environment more effectively through implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, and to provide significantly stronger funding to the Canadian military. But all these new initiatives were to be achieved within a framework of balanced budgets and tax relief when necessary and convenient. All in all, a classic appeal to the political centre.\n\nThe Martin government was doomed. Just as Paul Martin took power, the federal auditor general released a highly critical report on the sponsorship program. Throughout his two years in office, the scandal acted like a cancer on Martin’s government, weakening the credibility of the Liberal claim to sound fiscal management while giving opposition parties (and especially the Conservative Party led by Stephen Harper) the ability to denounce the federal Liberals as corrupt, incompetent, unaccountable, and undeserving of high office.\n\nIn June 2004, the Liberals won a minority government, but Paul Martin was never able to escape from the shadow of the sponsorship scandal and a growing reputation for dithering. His government survived until the fall of 2005, when it was defeated on a non-confidence vote in the House of Commons.\n\nWhite Paper: A New Liberalism?\n\nBetween 2011 and 2015 the Liberal Party of Canada was in trouble. For the first time since Confederation it was neither the governing party nor the official opposition. The party of Mackenzie King, St. Laurent, Pearson, and Pierre Trudeau was long viewed as Canada’s “natural governing party,” but some said after 2011 that the Conservatives had become “Canada’s party.”\n\nBut how things can change in a few years. By 2015 most Canadians were tired of Stephen Harper and his brand of conservatism and a plurality of Canadians voted for a renewed Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau. In 2015 the newly elected Prime Minister Trudeau promised to do politics differently. But did he? As of 2022, Trudeau has served as prime minister for seven years. Over this time has the Liberal Party really transformed Canada? Or are the fundamentals of Canadian politics and policy really little changed from what has gone before? If Canadians want a better Liberal Party of Canada can traditional liberal values and beliefs be mined to give the Liberal Party a new identity and policy focus?\n\nTake a look at the following list of reformist liberal policy and program ideas and initiatives. Since 2015, how many have been acted upon by the Trudeau government and why? And which ones have been sidelined or ignored? And why? How would you assess the type of progress this government has made on bringing a new liberalism to this country? Does more need to be done, and why? Or has this government gone too far already, and why?\n\na guaranteed universal basic income\n\nlegalization and taxation of prostitution and marijuana\n\nabolition of college and university tuition\n\na national daycare plan\n\na national pharmacare plan\n\na national carbon tax, the revenues of which would fund the development and commercialization of sustainable energy technologies\n\ntax incentives for green industries\n\na national policy for education and the promotion of educational resources\n\nan industrial policy to promote managerial leadership and technological innovation\n\nguaranteed access and funding for abortion services\n\nenshrining gay rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nincreasing immigration and acceptance of refugees\n\nsupport for labour and environmental rights within free trade agreements\n\nsupport for aggressive international action on global warming\n\nrenewed emphasis on peacekeeping over peacemaking\n\nthe establishment of a Canadian peace and development corps as a cornerstone of foreign policy\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of these proposals? What type of list would you develop?\n\nA hundred years ago, ideas such as workers’ compensation, legal unions and collective bargaining, national pension plans, national public health care plans, gender and racial equality, and human rights codes were considered either radical or extremist or utopian—or just downright unworkable in a modern society. Visionaries can help to chart the course for the future.\n\nLeaders of Major Canadian Political Parties"
