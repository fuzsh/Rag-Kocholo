        "text": "Robert Borden had an interest and involvement in imperial naval affairs that was largely forced upon him with the introduction into law in Canada of the Naval Service Act of 1910. This Canadian legislation was introduced against a background of changing international naval issues. Borden’s interest was heightened by a perceived international naval crisis derived from analysis of the British Government that began in 1909 but developed in the years 1911 and 1912. Winston Churchill’s pronouncements as First Lord of the Admiralty in this period and in particular his increasing interest in the role of the Dominions in issues related to an imperial navy brought Borden to further consider detailed naval matters."
