        "meta_description": "Robert Laird Borden was born and educated in Grand Pre, Nova Scotia, a farming community at the eastern end of the Annapolis Valley, where his great-grandfather Perry Borden, Sr. of Tiverton, Rhode Island had taken up Acadian land in 1760. Perry had accompanied his father, Samuel Borden, the chief surveyor chosen by the government of Massachusetts to survey the former Acadian land and draw up new lots for the Planters in Nova Scotia. Robert Borden was the last Canadian Prime Minister born before Confederation. Borden's father Andrew Borden was judged by his son to be \"a man of good ability and excellent judgement\", of a \"calm, contemplative and philosophical\" turn of mind, but \"He lacked energy and had no great aptitude for affairs\". His mother Eunice Jane Laird was more driven, possessing \"very strong character, remarkable energy, high ambition and unusual ability\". Her ambition was transmitted to her first-born child, who applied himself to his studies while assisting his parents",
