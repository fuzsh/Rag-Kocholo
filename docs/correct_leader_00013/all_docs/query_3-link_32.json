        "text": "It always seemed appropriate that Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on 30 November 1874 whilst his parents were guests at the impressive stately home. The house and estate derived from a gift by the nation to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, developed in the early eighteenth century. Winston Churchill’s father, Lord Randolph Churchill, was the second son of the seventh Duke of Marlborough and the first Duke of Marlborough, was Winston’s ancestor, a great hero and the subject of a monumental four volume biography by him.2 Despite his family name and aristocratic associations, Winston had no considerable inherited wealth and had to make a number of careers for himself. His careers were never entirely mutually exclusive and he managed to be a soldier, journalist, politician and historian with considerable talents for leadership, oratory, statesmanship and writing. Although held in significant national esteem, his stated views on industrial relations, women, prohibition, Ireland and decolonization make him a controversial figure with many contentious views and actions. His first tenure as First Lord of the Admiralty ended in 1915 with criticism over the disastrous Gallipoli campaign (also referred to as the Dardanelles campaign) in Turkey."
