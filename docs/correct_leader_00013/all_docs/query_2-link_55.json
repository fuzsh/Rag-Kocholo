Date: 1915\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14155812\n\nÂ© Illustrated London News Ltd/Mary Evans\n\nBorden Lawyer Premier\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nSir Robert Laird Borden (1854-1937): A Visionary Leader in Canadian History This portrait captures the essence of Sir Robert Laird Borden, a prominent Canadian lawyer and statesman who served as the Prime Minister of Canada from 1911 to 1920. Born on February 26, 1854, in Grand Pre, Nova Scotia, Borden's political career began in earnest when he was appointed as the Postmaster General in 1896. However, it was his tenure as Prime Minister that would cement his place in Canadian history. During his time in office, Borden led Canada through some of its most challenging periods. In 1914, he introduced the War Measures Act, granting the government extraordinary powers to maintain order during World War I. This decision proved crucial in preserving the peace and stability of the country during a time of great upheaval. Borden's leadership extended beyond the realm of politics. He was a strong advocate for the development of the Canadian economy and played a significant role in the creation of the Canadian National Railway. Additionally, he was a key figure in the establishment of the University of Ottawa and the Royal Canadian Navy. Borden's legacy extends far beyond his political achievements. He was a devoted family man, a dedicated public servant, and a man of unwavering conviction. This portrait, taken in 1915, captures the intelligence, determination, and integrity of a man who dedicated his life to the betterment of his country. Sir Robert Laird Borden's contributions to Canadian history continue to be celebrated and studied, making this image a valuable addition to any collection of Canadian historical portraits.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
