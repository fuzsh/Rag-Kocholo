        "text": "Profession: 8th Prime Minister of Canada\n\nBiography: Served as the eighth Prime Minister of Canada from October 1911 to July 1920. As Prime Minister of Canada during the First World War, he transformed his government to a wartime administration, passing the War Measures Act in 1914, committing Canada to provide half a million soldiers for the war effort. He was soon forced to pass the Military Service Act and the Conscription Crisis of 1917, which divided the country.\n\nHe persuaded Britain and the United States to allow Canada to have its own, separate seat at the Paris Peace Conference. He played a significant role in helping Canada separate itself from British rule.\n\nBorn: June 26, 1854\n\nBirthplace: Grand-Pre, Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nStar Sign: Cancer"
