It isa well-written bookandBrownonceagaindemonstrates hismasterly commandof the complexities of the period. He shows howa small,totally unprepared society gradually created theappropriate mechanisms todealwith the unprecedented demandsmadeuponit by the Alliedwar machine.He continues tobesympathetic tohissubject although Borden's protracted tolerance ofthebizarreactivities of SirSamHughesisgentlyrebukedandthatgross injustice, theWartimeElections Act,isrightlycondemned. Heemphasises that conscription, Uniongovernment, andtheadvance ofdominion status werethe highlights ofBorden's wartime leadership, andhistreatment ofthose matters isclearandcogent.However,it issometimes toocogent,andhereI havemy onlyserious quarrelwithanotherwise excellent book. 100 THE CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW Borden's ideas,attitudes, andpolicies arefaithfullysummarized oroutlined butrarelydeeplyexploredor placed in context.

Also,abiographer is always facedwitha dilemmain attempting tomaintain abalance between the 'life' and the 'times.' But, in this instance, where there is solittle of the 'life' to report, more elaboration on criticaldevelopments withinCanadaand the Commonwealth would have been welcomed.
