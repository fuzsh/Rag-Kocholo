Sir ROBERT LAIRD BORDEN\n\nG.C.M.G., D.C.L., LL.D.\n\nREVISED EDITION\n\nTHE MARFLEET LECTURESHIP\n\nIn November, 1910, Mrs. Lydia A. Marfleet of Prophetstown, Illinois, gave the sum of $5,000 to found a lectureship in the University of Toronto to be called in memory of her late husband the Pearson Kirkman Marfleet Lectureship.\n\nAs the late Pearson Kirkman Marfleet, an American citizen, devoted constant thought to the public welfare of his own country, and also watched the growth of the Dominion of Canada with profound interest, the Governors of the University have undertaken that such person or persons as may from time to time be appointed shall, as far as possible, be chosen with regard to their special ability to set forth some phase of the national movements of each or both countries.\n\nThe first course of lectures under this foundation was delivered in February, 1915, by the Honourable William Howard Taft, Ex-President of the United States. The second course was delivered in October 1921 by the Right Honourable Sir Robert L. Borden, G.C.M.G., formerly Premier of the Dominion of Canada.\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe following lectures were delivered in the University of Toronto, in October, 1921, under the Marfleet Foundation. They were designed as an introduction to the study of the constitutional development of Canada from 1760 to the present time; and they include a short sketch of the system of government which prevailed during the French regime from 1608 to 1760, as well as a glance at problems confronting democracy in the immediate future. The incidents of constitutional growth that I have endeavoured to describe are of absorbing interest and immense importance. They cover a period of nearly two centuries, and the attempt to compress them within these narrow limits necessitated many omissions. I am fully conscious that other imperfections, such as lack of proportion, will doubtless be observed in the result of my labours. It is hoped that the lectures, however imperfect, may prove of some assistance to those who desire to make themselves acquainted, in a general way, with the beginnings and gradual development of our present system of government.\n\nTo many friends I am indebted for assistance in the preparation of the lectures: to the Hon. N. W. Rowell, K.C., who read the manuscript of the first two lectures and made useful suggestions; to Dr. Adam Shortt, Professor George M. Wrong,\n\nand Dr. A. G. Doughty, C.M.G., of the Board of Historical Publications, and Major Gustave Lanctot, of the Canadian Archives, for valuable memoranda and suggestions; to Mr. E. L. Newcombe, K.C., C.M.G., Deputy Minister of Justice, and Mr. W. S. Edwards, K.C., Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice, for important notes on the legal questions discussed; and to Mr. L. C. Christie, Legal Adviser of the Department of External Affairs, and Mr. C. H. A. Armstrong, of the Prime Minister’s Office, for valuable notes and memoranda. Mr. Armstrong throughout the preparation of the lectures has rendered very important assistance, and he has also read the proofs.\n\nR. L.

Any attempt to trace its development in theory or in practice would be far beyond the limits of these lectures. It would be idle to claim for any experiment complete or final success. Especially is this true with regard to the relations between the organized communities designated as states or nations. In many instances authority sufficient to maintain peace and order between individual citizens of such a community was established even in the earliest periods. That disputes between states are still determined in the last analysis by the brutal and terrible arbitrament of war is a sad and humiliating confession of mankind’s incapacity for self-government in its highest sense. There is, Perhaps, the dawn of hope that at last we may stand at the hallowed threshold of a truer and nobler era.\n\nThe British Commonwealth embraces five self-governing nations, each of which possesses a political and social organization commonly described by the much-abused term “democracy.”\n\n[Page 12]\n\nThis term has a relative meaning according to the time, the people, and the conditions to which it is applied. The view-point of the observer is also to be taken into account; he may regard one or another of these five democracies as being in a condition of progress, stagnation, or reaction, according to his ideals.\n\nThe communities embraced Within the Britannic system extend over one-quarter of the world’s land surface and include more than one-quarter of its population. They illustrate practically every stage of social, economic, and political development. The governance of this vast system involves almost every method of administration known to history.1 At once solemn and inspiring is the responsibility imposed by an inheritance so majestic, a task so compelling, a trusteeship so sacred.\n\nThe reasonable essentials of government in a modern democracy may be regarded as embracing order, security, equality before the law, opportunity, and liberty. The King’s (that is the People’s) peace must be kept. The right to labour and to enjoy the fruits of labour in the form of property must be assured. All men must be equal before the law. Opportunity for the many must be established by the denial of special privilege to the few. Conscience must be respected; and finally there must be such individual liberty as is consistent with the maintenance of these principles. This definition gives merely a rough outline, but\n\n[Page 13]\n\nunder its various heads may fairly be grouped the chief ideals of those who believe, as I do, that democracy with all its imperfections (and they are many) gives to the great masses of the people higher hope, fuller liberty, and more abundant opportunity than any system hitherto devised by the wit of mankind.\n\nWe may reasonably claim that in this Dominion these essentials have been as fully realized as in any nation. I do not suggest that existing conditions cannot be improved. The permanence of injustice and inequality is no more possible than it is desirable. If the present civilization is to endure there must be definite and steady progress to a still higher conception and realization of the common welfare. Those who succeed us may look back with pity and sorrow upon the disparities, deformities, inequities, and waste of the existing social order, which their clearer perception, higher capacity, and truer ideals shall have long since redressed.\n\nTracing in rough outline the development of Canada from the status of a Crown Colony to that of a self-governing nation, I shall confine myself in this lecture to the events that fill the pages of our history from the cession of Canada to Confederation.\n\nThe French population which passed under British rule in 1760 comprised about 70,000 souls.\n\n[Page 14]\n\nThe Colony had behind it a history of a century and a half, having been founded in 1608. It had been governed by an autocratic King through his ministers, and the policy which controlled its affairs was directed from Versailles. Canada was regarded as a French province beyond the seas, and it was governed as such. There are indications that the conditions of the Colony rendered somewhat difficult, at times, the exercise of the King’s power, which was absolute in theory but not always fully effective in practice. At the head of the Colony stood a Governor, to whom, as personal representative of the King, were entrusted the general policy of the country, the direction of its military affairs, and its relations with the Indian tribes. The Bishop, as head of the Church, was supreme in all matters affecting religion. Acting under’the authority of the King, not of the Governor, the Intendant was responsible for the administration of justice, for finance, for the direction of local policy, and generally for local administration. There was a Superior Council with certain administrative powers which were more formal than real. No representative body possessing any actual or even formal authority was in existence. Public meetings could not be lawfully held without the permission of the Governor; occasionally they were held without such authority. The French feudal system of land tenure prevailed, although the seigniors were invested with certain responsi-\n\n[Page 15]\n\nbilities and duties in advancing the settlement of the land. French civil and criminal laws were in force, and the administration of justice was fairly just and efficient. The main constituents of the population were the seignior, the priest, the habitant, and the Voyageur or merchant.2 Murray described the peasantry as a strong healthy race, plain in their dress, virtuous in their morals, temperate in their living, very ignorant, and extremely tenacious of their religion.3\n\nFrom the Capitulation until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the Colony was governed by British military commanders, who exercised complete authority. Justice was administered in courts which they instituted, and which necessarily continued to apply French law.4\n\nBy the terms of the capitulation of Quebec (September 18, 1759), the free exercise of the Roman Catholic religion was granted, and in the Capitulation of Montreal (September 8, 1760) it was stipulated that its free exercise should subsist entire (subsistera en son entier).\n\nThe Treaty of Paris (February 10, 1763) contained but one stipulation relating to the Canadians: “His Britannic Majesty, on his side, agrees to grant the liberty of the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada; he will, in consequence, give the most precise and most effectual orders, that his new Roman Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion according to the rites\n\n[Page 16]\n\nof the Romish church, as far as the laws of Great Britain permit.” 5 The Treaty was followed by 6. Royal Proclamation on October 7, 1763, which established the limits of the new Province of Quebec.6 The Proclamation provided that, as soon as circumstances should admit, General Assemblies should be summoned, with power to enact laws for the public welfare and good government of the Colony, and that in the meantime, until such Assemblies were called, the people were to enjoy “the Benefit of the Laws of our Realm of England.” 7 For this purpose the Governor with the advice of the Council was authorized to erect and constitute Courts of Judicature for hearing and determining civil and criminal cases “according to Law and Equity, and as near as may be agreeable to the Laws of England,” with an appeal to the Privy Council.8 A few weeks later, on November 28, 1763, Murray was appointed Governor of the country. He was directed to appoint a Council as his Instructions should prescribe, and to summon a General Assembly of the freeholders of the province. It was an important item of his Commission that members of the Council and of the Assembly were to take the oath provided by statute (25 Car. II, cap. 2) against “Popish Recusants.” In his Instructions, which were not issued until December, proposals for the government of the Colony were more fully disclosed. He was instructed to “nominate and establish a\n\n[Page 17]\n\nCouncil” composed of the Lieutenant-Governors of Montreal and Three Rivers, the Chief Justice and the Solicitor General, with eight other persons to be appointed by him.9 With the advice of the Council the Governor was to make necessary rules and regulations “for the Peace, Order and good Government” of the province, but so as not to affect life or liberty or to impose duties or taxes.10 Clause 28 set forth “Our Will and Pleasure that you do in all things regarding the said Inhabitants, conform with great Exactness to the Stipulations of the said Treaty”11 in respect of the exercise of the Roman Catholic religion; but Clause 29 provided that the inhabitants should subscribe the declaration accepting the Protestant succession to the Crown, under pain of exclusion from the country.12 By Clause 32 Murray was forbidden to “admit of any Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the See of Rome.” 13\n\nWith these documents before him Murray published the Ordinance of September, 1764, establishing Law Courts. A Superior Court was created for the trial of criminal and civil cases “agreeable to the Laws of England and to the Ordinances of this Province;” 14 and for the benefit of the new subjects he established a Court of Common Pleas, where cases were to be decided according to equity, but with due regard for the laws of England. In this Court French laws and customs were to be admitted in cases which originated before October,\n\n[Page 18]\n\n1764, and French lawyers were allowed to practise. In all trials French ahd British subjects were eligible as jurors. Appeals could be taken to the Privy Council.15 The Ordinance created great confusion at first, as the French subjects were unfamiliar with English laws, and the few English lawyers in the country could not speak French. “Canadian lawyers utterly ignorant of the English law pleaded in French before English Judges, who knew nothing of the French law.” 16\n\nMeantime the difficulties of the situation had been increased by the advent of a small minority of British origin who believed themselves entitled to control the administration of public affairs in the Colony. The Grand Jury at Quebec affirmed its right to be consulted as a representative body in the making of laws and the expenditure of public funds.17 Murray’s description of the British minority is far from flattering and may have been exaggerated by his warmth of temper.18\n\nIt seems clear that the British Government desired to be fair, and, according to the standards of the age, even generous in its treatment of the French population. The task, however, required fuller knowledge and profounder insight than were available. Both Murray and Carleton (who succeeded him) understood the conditions and the needs more thoroughly than the authorities under whose direction they acted. The French habitants were wholly unacquainted with, and utterly un-\n\n[Page 19]\n\ntrained in, any system of representative institutions or self-government; they had been governed under a despotic system, attended with a trade monopoly for certain privileged persons, and an administration not wholly free from corruption.\n\nIn April, 1766, Murray was recalled, although he was not formally superseded until the autumn of 1768. He had been especially considerate in his treatment of the French-Canadian population, and he had strongly impressed them with a sense of his justice and fairness. He was succeeded by Sir Guy Carleton (afterwards Lord Dorchester) who, on his arrival in 1766, was confronted by the same difficulties that his predecessor had encountered. The system under which the Colony was governed had produced extreme discontent among both the French population and the British minority. In the French population this discontent was more manifest among the seigniors and the priesthood than among the habitants. Slow progress was made in applying desirable remedies, and finally, in 1770, Carleton crossed the ocean to present the case in person to the British Government. As a result the Act of Parliament of 1774, known as the Quebec Act, was passed. It extended the boundaries of Quebec so as to include the territory later known as Upper and Lower Canada; provision was made for the “free exercise of the religion of the Church of Rome” with authority for the clergy to\n\n[Page 20]\n\ncollect their tithes; 19 Roman Catholics were not obliged to take the oath of abjuration, but a modified oath of allegiance. Thus all positions were open to them,20 and the Roman Catholics in Canada enjoyed privileges not then open to people professing the same faith in England.\n\nAfter the American Revolution the influx of the United Empire Loyalists added not only a new element but increased difficulties to a situation already sufficiently complicated and critical. They had made enormous sacrifices in abandoning their homes and to a great extent their fortunes for loyalty to the Empire. In their political ideas they were probably more advanced than the people of Great Britain, and it was natural that they should chafe under the system of government established by the Quebec Act. On the other hand, the representative institutions that the loyalists valued had little meaning to the French-Canadians, who regarded them rather as oppressive innovations devised for the purpose of taxation. Carleton was sufficiently occupied with military affairs during the American Revolution. After the conclusion of peace he visited England for two years, and having been raised to the peerage as Baron Dorchester he was appointed Governor General in 1786. He applied himself to the situation with ability and energy. In the end, the Constitutional Act (Canada Act) of 1791 was passed, and took effect in December of that year. Its chief\n\n[Page 21]\n\npoints were the division of the territory into two provinces, the establishment in each province of a nominated Legislative Council and an elected House of Assembly with power to make laws. There was an ill-considered and fruitless provision designed to introduce the hereditary principle and to constitute the Legislative Council in whole or in part of hereditary legislators; a small property qualification was established for the electorate; freedom for the Roman Catholic religion was granted, and a portion of Crown lands was set aside for the support of a Protestant clergy. In the practical operation of the Act, the Governor really controlled the machinery of government; there were Crown revenues, and military grants from the Home Government, which made him virtually independent of the Assembly. On the one hand, the Governor carried on the administration through officers who were not responsible to the Assembly; on the other hand, no laws could be made without the Assembly’s consent.\n\n“The Executive was financially and, worse still, constitutionally independent, and the House of Assembly, in seeking vaguely to cure a disease which it had not in reality diagnosed, frequently overstepped its sphere, with the result that it was dissolved time after time.” 21\n\nIt may be that British statesmen learned the Wrong lesson from the American Revolution. They attempted a control over the two Canadas stricter than was previously known, and created a government of cliques under the direction of the Governor.\n\n[Page 22]\n\nIn no inconsiderable measure the administration was carried on under the immediate direction of the Colonial Office. A bureaucracy not familiar at first hand with conditions in the Colony and often unsympathetic with the aspirations of its inhabitants could hardly avoid narrow views and mischievous policies. The permanent official who directs from a distance requires rare qualities of sympathy, vision, and imagination. Naturally in Lower Canada the difficulties created by differences in temperament and training of the two races were very great. Although, at first, few of the French-Canadians either comprehended or appreciated the gift of representative institutions, they soon learned to utilize them to good purpose in what they conceived to be their interests. Conflict was inevitable between the representative Assembly and the irresponsible Executive. Bitter passion was aroused and fierce controversy raged in both provinces. There was complete deadlock from time to time. These disastrous conditions led to the outbreaks of 1837. The constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham’s mission began.\n\nBefore proceeding to examine the results of that memorable mission, it is desirable to consider the development of democratic institutions in Great Britain from 1760 to 1837.\n\nIt seems clear that the representative method of government is not wholly or, indeed, primarily\n\n[Page 23]\n\nof British origin.22 The responsibility of the King (that is the Executive) to the people, the derivation of his authority from the people, and the principle of constitutional limitations upon his authority were acknowledged at least six hundred years ago. In the first of his two lectures on the “History of Freedom,” which are a mere fragment of the greater work that probably he alone could have accomplished, Lord Acton quotes three notable declarations of constitutional right. The first is a resolution of the Scottish Parliament, early in the fourteenth century, repudiating the Pope’s advocacy of the claim of the English King against the House of Bruce. Speaking of Robert Bruce, they said:\n\n“Divine Providence, the laws and customs of the country, which we will defend till death, and the choice of the people, have made him our king. If he should ever betray his principles and consent that we should be subjects of the English king, then we shall treat him as an enemy, as the subverter of our rights and his own, and shall elect another in his place. We care not for glory or for wealth, but for that liberty which no true man will give up but with his life.” 23\n\nThe second is from the works of St. Thomas Aquinas, written about the time that Simon de Montfort summoned the Commons (A.D. 1264):\n\n“A king who is unfaithful to his duty forfeits his claim to obedience. It is not rebellion to depose him, for he is himself a rebel whom the nation has a right to put down. But it is better to abridge his power, that he may be unable to abuse it. For this purpose, the whole nation ought to have a share in governing itself; the Constitution ought to combine a limited and elective monarchy with an aristocracy of merit and such an admixture of democracy as shall admit all classes to office by popular election. No government\n\n[Page 24]\n\nhas a right to levy taxes beyond the limit determined by the people. All political authority is derived from popular suffrage, and all laws must be made by the people or their representatives. There is no security for us as long as we depend on the will of another man.” 24\n\nThe third is an utterance of Marsilius of Padua (circa AD. 1234), whom Lord Acton describes as the ablest writer of the Ghibelline party:\n\n“Laws derive their authority from the nation, and are invalid without its assent. As the whole is greater than any part, it is wrong that any part should legislate for the whole; and as men are equal, it is wrong that one should be bound by laws made by another. But in obeying laws to which all men have agreed, all men in reality govern themselves. The monarch, who is instituted by the legislature to execute its will, ought to be armed with a force sufficient to coerce individuals, but not sufficient to control the majority of the people. He is responsible to the nation, and subject to the law; and the nation that appoints him, and assigns him his duties, has to see that he obeys the Constitution, and has to dismiss him if he breaks it. The rights of citizens are independent of the faith they profess; and no man may be punished for his religion.” 25\n\nLord Acton truly declares that in regard to the sovereignty of the nation, representative government, the superiority of the legislature over the executive, and liberty of conscience, this writer had a remarkably firm grasp of the principles that were to sway the modern world.\n\nIn the reign of George III, England had enjoyed representative institutions for more than five centuries, but democratic government, as we now understand it, had not come into being. The representation was that of an oligarchy, not of the people at large. To the House of Commons elected by this oligarchy, ministers were in some sense\n\n[Page 25]\n\nresponsible. In Canada there was representation of a wide electorate, but the administration was not directly responsible to, or controlled by, the people’s representatives. Thus, in the first half of the nineteenth century, Canada was working towards a form of government which was not attained in Great Britain until after 1832. For the Canadian, responsibility of the executive to the legislature was the goal; for the Briton, real representation of the people. In the British political and social order during the reigns of the Georges, the spirit and influence of feudalism persisted in no small measure, although its form had almost wholly passed away. The essentials of democratic government were not realized, and the country was in fact governed by the King, the nobles, and the great landowners. Rotten boroughs were controlled by great families at whose dictation designated members were returned to Parliament. “The whole political power of England was virtually concentrated in 1831 in the hands of two or three hundred individuals, who returned a majority of the House of Commons and sat in large numbers in the House of Lords.” 26 The King, directly, and with little attempt at secrecy, intrigued among the Lords to defeat measures introduced by his ministers. He competed with Peers for control of the Commons, upon whom the influence of bribery and court intrigue was freely used; ministers were regarded as servants of the King rather than of the people; in many\n\n[Page 26]\n\ninstances they so regarded themselves. Open assumption of arbitrary power by odious and violent measures had cost one Stuart his head, and another his crown. Its virtual assumption by George III cost him little, but the nation much. In the Commons there was no real conception of parliamentary government as we now understand it. That the continued existence of an administration depended upon the support of a majority of the representative chamber was not fully accepted or generally realized; ministers were the King’s servants. The nineteenth century was well advanced before the House of Commons effectively and successfully asserted its control of government.27 William IV, in 1834, was supposed to have dismissed the Whig ministry. He called Sir Robert Peel to office; but the constitution had reached a new stage of development. The majority of the House was against the King’s choice, and the King found that he was obliged to retire from the business of governing.28\n\nDisraeli, in his earlier political writings (1838-1841), laid down in emphatic terms the view that the House of Commons was not, and was not intended to be, representative of the people; he declared that it represented a privileged or favoured section or order of the people, who, like the Peers of England, enjoyed “for the advantage of the nation in general certain powers of a very eminent and exalted character.” 29\n\n[Page 27]\n\nIt should be remembered that the birth-pangs of democratic government were hardly less severe in Great Britain than in Canada. Following the rejection of the Reform Bill in 1831 there were disturbances which verged on civil war; the monarchy was threatened; riots broke out in different parts of the country, and authority, both civil and military, seemed paralysed.30 We may also fairly conclude that, during the first half of the nineteenth century, constitutional development in the Mother Country was hardly less notable and important than in the Colony. In Great Britain the King, in Canada the Governor, practically ceased to govern. Executive control passed to the people’s representatives. In Great Britain as in Canada there were, however, successive stages of progress toward the system which now prevails in both countries. By a series of enactments in each country the franchise has been so extended that the electorate includes practically the entire adult population. But the Georgian tradition of the Crown’s control over public affairs had its influence in Great Britain for many years. In 1839 the Sovereign asserted her right to refuse the advice of an incoming Prime Minister as to the official organization of the Royal household. Two years later public opinion compelled a withdrawal from that position. The influence of the Crown, especially in foreign affairs, was manifest in Great Britain throughout the reign of Queen Victoria,\n\n[Page 28]\n\nespecially in 1851, when Lord Palmerston was forced to retire from the Foreign Office, and in 1877, when there were strained relations with Russia.31\n\nI return to Lord Durham’s mission. Fortunately for the future of the Empire, he was well in touch with advanced political thought of the day. His wide vision, his political training and experience, and his immense capacity to grasp and realize unfamiliar conditions enabled him to render a memorable service to the Empire. That he made serious mistakes both in practice and in theory cannot be denied; but he truly laid the foundations of a reasonable and practical colonial policy. An exhaustive analysis of his report is unnecessary for my purpose. It contains passages which are not wholly consistent with one another, and which have been inconsistently interpreted; but it may justly be regarded as the charter of constitutional government in our country. I should place beside it, and rank with it, the four notable letters of Joseph Howe to Lord John Russell (1839), which are unsurpassed in cogency and eloquence of expression, in thorough grasp of the problems involved, and in clear comprehension of the remedies required for their solution. They constitute enduring evidence of his statesmanship, vision, and patriotism.32\n\nAfter pointing out that representative institutions had been established in the North American\n\n[Page 29]\n\nColonies, Lord Durham set forth his most important conclusion in these words:\n\n“The Crown must . . . submit to the necessary consequences of representative institutions; and if it has to carry on the government in unison with a representative body, it must consent to carry it on by means of those in whom that representative body has confidence.” 33\n\nHaving said so much, he proceeded to qualify it by proposing to except from the control of the Provincial Legislature certain matters which in his judgment affected the relations of the Colonies with the Mother Country:\n\n“The matters, which so concern us, are very few. The constitution of the form of government,—the regulation of foreign relations, and of trade with the mother country, the other British Colonies, and foreign nations,—and the disposal of the public lands, are the only points on which the Mother Country requires a control.” 34\n\nThe important limitations as to trade and public lands were swept away within a few years after the report was made. That a man of Lord Durham’s vision could not foresee the lamentable consequences of such limitations is remarkable. The regulation of trade and the control of public lands were obviously matters of domestic concern. If such functions of government were exercised by permanent officials at the Colonial Office, the outcry against unwisdom of policy or inefficiency of administration, directed as it would be against the Home Government, would have weakened and might eventually have destroyed the ties which united Canada to the Mother Country. On the\n\n[Page 30]\n\nother hand, if those functions were exercised, however unwisely, by the people of the Colonies through their own representatives, the responsibility and remedy for unwise policy or inefficient or corrupt administration would rest with the people themselves. Other important recommendations contained in the report were as follows: the two provinces should be reunited as one province under one Legislature; the necessary Bill for that purpose should provide for voluntary admission of other North American provinces; the principle of representation by population should be followed; the judges were to be placed in the same position with respect to tenure of office and salary as in England; and no money votes were to be proposed except with the consent of the Crown, that is to say, by responsible ministers.\n\nLord Durham’s expectation that the French would be absorbed by the English element proved to be an idle dream; this he might have learned from the lessons of history. Nine centuries have not been sufficient to amalgainate into one type the races that successive currents of immigration and conquest brought together in the British Islands. Differences of religious belief and of language increased the improbability of achieving in Canada what Lord Durham anticipated. In the national life of the Mother Country we may discern the Saxon’s steadfast spirit and love of liberty, his patience, his courage, and his deter-\n\n[Page 31]\n\nmination; the Celt’s imagination and eloquence; the Norman’s adventurous, ambitious spirit, his instinct for leadership and his genius for administration. So, in Canada, the French race, maintaining its distinctive qualities, has brought to the service of our country much that is valuable. In some measure the qualities of each race may serve to aid the possible deficiencies of the other. Moreover there is a distinct and not remote kinship; in each race there is the strain of the Celt, while the Saxon and Scandinavian elements of the British correspond very closely with the Frankish and Norman elements of the French race. In the development of constitutional government in Canada, Canadians of French descent have taken their full part; their comprehension and practical realization of the principles upon which the government of a modern democracy is based have not been surpassed by Canadians of British origin. Indeed, it is a curious fact, and worthy to be noted, that the practical operation of democratic government has been comprehended and realized more fully and thoroughly by the French of Canada than by the people of their ancestral country. In political theory the French are thoroughly logical (much more so than the British); but in the application of the theory they lack the practical instinct which is distinctive of British constitutional development. This is by no means the only test by which one can measure the standard\n\n[Page 32]\n\nof their civilization; perhaps on the whole, the civilization of France is more highly developed than any other. As Lord Acton has said, “the two kinds of civilization, social and political, are wholly unconnected with each other. Either may subsist in high perfection alone.” 35\n\nBetween 1839 and 1854, five Governors General exercised authority in Canada: Charles Poulett Thomson (later Lord Sydenham), Sir Charles Bagot, Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) Metcalfe, Lord Cathcart and the Earl of Elgin. During this period the principles of Lord Durham were being gradually put into practice and extended. The programme outlined by Lord John Russell as Colonial Secretary, in his instructions to Sydenham, involved the legislative union of the two Provinces with just regard to the claims of each in arranging the terms of union; the maintenance of the three estates of the provincial legislature; the independence of the Judges through the establishment of a permanent civil list; such freedom of action to the Executive Government as would be found necessary for the public good; and the establishment of a system of local government by representative bodies in the cities and rural districts.36 This programme did not adopt the principle that the Executive should be responsible to the representatives of the people in the legislature. In his despatch of October 14, 1889,37 the Colonial Secretary expressly declared that it should not be\n\n[Page 33]\n\nadopted. In some of the reasons he assigned for this position it is not difficult to find an unanswerable argument against the views he propounded.\n\nOn April 14, 1837, Lord John Russell, speaking as Secretary of State for the Colonies in the House of Commons, had said:\n\n“The case, as it is brought before the House, is this. The House of Assembly of Lower Canada have asked for an elective Legislative Council, and for an Executive Council which shall be responsible to them, and not to the Government or Crown of Great Britain. We consider that these demands are inconsistent with the relations between a Colony and the Mother Country, and that it would be better to say, at once, ‘let the two countries separate’ than for us to pretend to govern the Colony afterwards.” 38\n\nThe resolution which he was supporting contained the following paragraph:\n\n“Resolved, That, while it is expedient to improve the composition of the Executive Council in Lower Canada, it is unadvisable to subject it to the responsibility demanded by the House of Assembly of that province.”\n\nI contrast with this the words of Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, spoken seventy years afterwards on May 10, 1907: 39\n\n“Let us see what is that most significant event of the past Year which has rung through the world and astounded the world. It is the establishment of complete self-government in the Transvaal, and the constitution of a freely elected Government, at the head of which is a man who perhaps was the ablest and most successful soldier of those who led the Boer people in the determined war against us a year or two ago. I believe in my soul and conscience that in the whole history of our country there has never been a finer example of true British policy or a grander achievement.” 40\n\nLord Stanley, who succeeded Lord John Russell at the Colonial Office in 1841, was a man of brilliant\n\n[Page 34]\n\nability, of exceedingly firm opinions, and of reactionary tendencies so far as the governance of the Colonies was concerned. His temperament, training, and traditions made him incapable of comprehending that centralization would destroy, while autonomy would establish, a real unity of the Empire. To limit as far as possible the reforms advocated by Durham was his natural inclination. Speaking later (May 30, 1844) in the House of Commons, he set forth with some elaboration the prevailing theory of British statesmen respecting responsible government as applied to Canada. The affairs of the Colony were to be carried on with the advice of ministers responsible to the Assembly; but in the last analysis the ministers were to be controlled, and their views might properly be overruled, by a Governor exercising wide political powers and responsible to the Colonial Office. Control of patronage by ministers in Great Britain was an admirable system; but in Canada it was an abuse and must lead to disastrous results. Therefore, the Governor was at liberty to make appointments without consulting his ministers and without their knowledge or consent, if he conceived that course to be in the public interest. Canada was unfortunate in possessing no House of Lords and no great landed aristocracy, upon whom, as Lord Stanley conceived, the good government and welfare of the United Kingdom largely depended. He confidently affirmed that without such influences\n\n[Page 35]\n\nthe enjoyment by Canada of actual responsible government would convert that Colony into a virtual republic. Moreover, the principle of responsible government, as understood by the Canadian ministers who had tendered their resignations, was quite inconsistent with Lord Stanley’s theory of Colonial dependence. In short, the Colonial Office in any case of real difficulty could govern Canada more wisely and effectively than could any Canadian ministry. Lord Stanley was unfamiliar with the actual conditions of the country and of its population; he did not realize the danger of continued refusal to accept the principle in question; and he regarded the Colonial Office as the controlling authority in the administration of the Colony’s affairs. The speech, though insular in its spirit, was nevertheless plausible in its argument and eloquent in its expression; no debating point was missed. That it made an irresistible appeal to an audience of imperfect comprehension and limited vision was evidenced by the sustained applause which greeted the brilliant orator at its conclusion.\n\nBoth in 1837 and in 1844 the views expressed by Lord John Russell and by Lord Stanley did not pass unchallenged in the British Parliament. On the other hand, it must not be imagined that these views were confined to that side of the Atlantic. Similar opinions were expressed with vigour, and even vehemence, by a group in Canada, some of whom, under successive Governors, had enjoyed not\n\n[Page 36]\n\nonly political dominance but long continued tenure of the chief administrative offices. In the report of a committee of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada, which was unanimously adopted by that body, Lord Durham’s report had been criticized with marked ability: responsibility of the Executive to the representatives of the people was entirely inappropriate and inapplicable to colonial conditions; it would put an end to colonial dependence and virtually make the Colony a sovereign power; the Colony ought not to be subjected to the dissensions of party but should be governed by the Imperial Cabinet through persons of ability and prominence selected by the Governor and acting under his direction without responsibility to the Legislature.41 To the same effect was a protest from Nova Scotia. Thus the voices of reaction in Great Britain and of officialdom in Canada united in harmonious chorus. It is impossible to doubt the perfect sincerity of the Russell-Stanley school and of some of their Canadian supporters; but the views of prominent placemen in Canada and Nova Scotia were probably influenced (perhaps unconsciously) by considerations of self-interest.\n\nThe Union came into force in February, 1841, elections were held in March, and the Legislature met in June. No less than six political groups were represented in the Assembly; but three of them included more than three-quarters of its membership.” The new Assembly was strongly determined\n\n[Page 37]\n\nto assert the principle of responsible government. There was but an imperfect and even vague conception of the full meaning which we now attach to that expression, and of the conditions necessary for the successful application of the principle in the practical administration of public affairs. But one essential was fully understood and was urged with vehement insistence: that the Governor in administering the affairs of the Colony should be guided only by the advice of ministers who possessed the confidence of the elected branch of the Legislature. Sydenham declined to accept this principle in the first instance. Indeed, his instructions forbade it: Lord John Russell had reminded him of the “decisively pronounced judgment” of both Houses of Parliament on April 28, and May 9, 1837. The new Governor had a most difficult part, and he played it with conspicuous tact and discretion. He reached the conclusion, evidently after the most careful consideration, that he must undertake the double role of Governor and Prime Minister. Apparently, in his capacity as Governor he was to be responsible to the Crown, through the Colonial Office, in upholding all Imperial interests; in his capacity as Prime Minister he was to be responsible to the Legislature in respect of provincial administration. 43 The success which he gained was due to his wide experience, his remarkable ability, and his extraordinary capacity for political management. In the hands of a less capable man\n\n[Page 38]\n\nthe attempt would have encountered immediate disaster. He died at the close of the first session and before failure had attended his efforts. Probably he realized that his system was but a temporary phase, and if he had lived he would perhaps have carried out what Lord Elgin afterwards consummated. That his service to Canada was notable cannot be questioned. In the face of numerous difficulties he brought the Union Act into effective operation; he initiated a general municipal system in Lower Canada; he placed the banking system upon a sounder basis; and he successfully reorganized the executive departments. Under his guidance the leading statesmen of the Colony acquired a useful knowledge of the practical meaning of responsible government. Finally he accepted the principle of executive responsibility in the amendment moved by Mr. Harrison at his instance in the session of 1841.44\n\nSir Charles Bagot, who succeeded Lord Sydenham, seems to have been controlled at first by instructions from Lord Stanley, who was seriously impressed with the inability of the colonists to govern themselves in accordance with their own interests, which he was disposed to measure by the standards of the Colonial Office. Bagot’s régime lasted only one year. He appreciated the difficulties and dangers of the situation much more fully than Stanley, but his suggestions as to compromise were met by Stanley’s rejoinder that it might be\n\n[Page 39]\n\nbetter to let the Colonies go altogether.45 Eventually, from the very force of circumstances, and through a comprehension that could come only to one closely in touch with actual conditions, Bagot practically disregarded Stanley’s instructions and formed a government which commanded a majority in the Assembly.46 Finally on October 28, 1842, he told the Colonial Secretary quite frankly that whether responsible government was openly acknowledged or only tacitly acquiesced in, it virtually existed.47\n\nHis successor, Sir Charles (afterwards Lord) Metcalfe, was a distinguished civil servant who enjoyed a high reputation from his administration in India, where he had spent thirty-seven years. He came to Canada from Jamaica, where he had achieved considerable success in administering the affairs of that Colony. According to one of his biographers, he was an advanced Liberal, or even Radical, in the politics of the United Kingdom.48 But his training and experience were of a character that quite unfitted him for the task with which he was confronted in Canada. With the theory or practice of colonial government he was entirely unfamiliar, and his instincts led him to accept literally, and without much regard for conditions surrounding him, the narrow views which then afflicted British statesmen. He was obsessed with their idea that effective responsibility of the Executive to the people’s representatives meant\n\n[Page 40]\n\nearly separation. Ministers were free to offer their advice, but he was equally free to reject it; otherwise, as he conceived, he would surrender the prerogative of the Crown, and be merely a tool in the hands of a Council.49 As compared with Sydenham and Bagot, he was distinctly reactionary in Canada, whatever he may have been in England. His ministers having resigned on his refusal to be bound by their advice respecting appointments to office, he summoned new advisers, and upon dissolution of the Legislature threw his whole strength and influence into the electoral contest. Decrying party government as unsuited to colonial conditions, he was forced to take refuge in party support. He had the satisfaction of securing a narrow majority; but the disorders which his policy aroused were of the most serious character.50\n\nMetcalfe retired at the end of 1845, and Earl Cathcart held office during the short interval that intervened between Metcalfe’s departure and the arrival of Lord Elgin at the beginning of 1847. To Lord Elgin is due the establishment of constitutional and democratic government in Canada on foundations that have proved enduring. He was the son-in-law of Lord Durham, whose ideals he carried out, and, indeed, extended beyond their scope, as Lord Durham understood it. The years between Durharrfs departure and Elgin’s arrival had produced no final results, and Elgin had to assume and carry out the task of executing Durham’s report.\n\n[Page 41]\n\nHe was endowed with sufficient Vision and common sense to realize that if the colonists had but a limited capacity for self-government, the Colonial Office had a still more limited capacity for governing them.\n\nBefore proceeding to Canada Lord Elgin had been made aware of a despatch from the Colonial Secretary (Earl Grey) to Sir John Harvey, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, which contained the following passage:\n\n“It cannot be too distinctly acknowledged that it is neither possible nor desirable to carry on the government of any of the British provinces in North America in opposition to the opinion of the inhabitants.” 51\n\nSpeaking (as Lord Howick) in the House of Commons on March 8, 1837, Earl Grey had said:\n\n“I, for one, am not prepared to say, that any mode of carrying on the government on sound principles under a popular constitution can be devised, under which a permanent resistance to the popular branch of the legislature can be maintained. I believe that the very notion of this is an absurdity in itself.” 52\n\nThroughout his administration Lord Elgin received from Earl Grey wise and sympathetic support in the policy carried out in Canada.\n\nWhen Lord Elgin arrived in January 1847, he found a Government which possessed a very narrow majority in the Assembly. Among the ministers there were several men of marked ability, but the Government as a whole was not distinguished by resource or resolution. Lord Elgin’s first attempt, made with the consent of his ministers, was to\n\n[Page 42]\n\nbring into the Government a more adequate representation of the French population. His negotiations for this purpose were conducted with great skill and discretion and, although unsuccessful at the moment, they produced an excellent effect. He gradually won the confidence of all parties in his justice and impartiality, and in his sincere intention to administer the Government through advisers possessing the confidence of the people’s representatives.53 In the autumn of 1847 his ministers proposed dissolution, which took place at the end of that year. The prospect of carrying on the government by means of another administration was not unwelcome. “My ministers have always been struggling for existence. Catching at straws —living from hand to mouth. Anything like a large or generous policy has been altogether out of their reach. I know not what the future may bring forth; but I confess that I regard with hope rather than apprehension the prospect of coming in contact with a more powerful party, and with men of more decided views.” 54 The ministry sustained a decisive defeat at the elections which took place early in 1848. Lord Elgin gave them the option of meeting Parliament without delay or of resigning at once.55 They accepted the former alternative and were beaten in the election of the Speaker a.nd in the division on the Address. Their resignation was tendered and accepted on Saturday, March 4, and on the following Tuesday the\n\n[Page 43]\n\nGovernor sent for Messrs. Baldwin and Lafontaine, the leaders of the Opposition in the Assembly, and entrusted to them the task of forming an administration, which they accepted. For the first time the principle of executive responsibility to the Assembly was fully recognized, and the first stage of democratic self-government as we now understand it had been reached. Lord Grey expressed his complete approval of the Governor General’s course. Slowly, and sometimes with difficulty, the lesson had been learned by other British statesmen. Russell, then Prime Minister, had abandoned his theories of 1837.\n\nLord Elgin’s wisdom and foresight are frequently illustrated in his correspondence with the Colonial Secretary. On January 22, 1848, he wrote: “The less you meddle in Canadian appointments, even by the issue of Royal warrants, the better.—You cannot effectually control them. By seeming to endeavour to do so you rouse that jealousy of Imperial interference which has heretofore produced such mischievous effects in Canada. I would allow the responsibility of appointing to Office to rest upon the Provincial Ministry and to weigh upon them as heavily as possible. An intelligent Governor and a watchful opposition will generally succeed in preventing abuses from growing too rank.” Although sometimes impatient at the inconsistent and unreasonable attitude of French political leaders, he always advocated a\n\n[Page 44]\n\njust and even generous policy with regard to the legitimate aspirations of the French population. In his estimate of the future relations between the two races in Canada he displayed a wider vision and a truer foresight than Lord Durham.56\n\nEvents in the other British possessions followed practically the same course. In Nova Scotia representative institutions were established in 1757, after correspondence between Governor Lawrence and the Lords of Trade.57 The first Assembly met on October 2, 1758. Cape Breton was added to Nova Scotia in 1763. It had previously been administered by a Governor and Council, and had had no representative Assembly. In 1765 it was erected into a distinct county, with the right to return two county members to the Assembly. In 1784 the Province of Nova Scotia was divided, and New Brunswick was established as a separate Province with representative institutions. In both Provinces the Executive Council who acted as advisers of the Governor in the administration of public affairs also exercised functions as a Legislative Council or Provincial Upper Chamber. Responsibility of the Executive to the Assembly was not admitted. Continual disputes between the Assembly and the Council were the inevitable result, and the elective chamber maintained its position with no little firmness and persistence. The struggle for responsible government was waged actively and aggressively in all the Maritime Provinces, but\n\n[Page 45]\n\nthere was little sympathy with the disorder and rebellion that broke out in the upper Provinces. A distinct Legislative Council was established in Nova Scotia in 1838. In that province there were reactionary Governors after Lord Durham’s report, and they had to bear the full brunt of Howe’s bold and unceasing attacks. Two of them he virtually drove from the Province; and in 1848, upon the succession of Sir John Harvey to Lord Falkland, the principle of executive responsibility to the Assembly was finally recognized. In New Brunswick the Executive and Legislative Councils had been separated in 1832, and responsible government came into effect in 1848. Prince Edward Island, established as a separate Province in 1769, received representative institutions in 1773, and responsible government in 1851.\n\nIt will be noted that this great constitutional change in the various Provinces was not based upon any statutory provision, but was consummated by the adoption of a recognized convention. The formal constitutional enactments remained unchanged, but upon them was imposed a new controlling principle.\n\n“The State that Englishmen knew was a singularly unicellular State, and at a critical time they were not too well equipped with tried and traditional thoughts which would meet the case of Ireland or some communities, commonwealths, corporations in America which seemed to have wills—and hardly fictitious wills—of their Own, and which became States and United States. . . . The modern and multicellular British State—often and perhaps harmlessly\n\n[Page 46]\n\ncalled an Empire–may prosper without a theory, but does not suggest and, were we serious in our talk of sovereignty, would hardly tolerate, a theory that is simple enough and insular enough and yet withal imperially Roman enough, to deny an essentially state-like character to those ‘self-governing colonies,’ communities, commonwealths, which are knit and welded into a large sovereign whole.” 58\n\nSo wrote F. W. Maitland more than twenty years ago. In its main aspects the theory of the most powerful intellects among British statesmen three-quarters of a century ago was unmistakeably “unicellular.” The irresistible trend of events swept aside this theory before it had wrought irreparable mischief; and later generations have realized that the strength of our wider British Commonwealth rests upon that free development of self-governing nations which Russell, Stanley, and other eminent statesmen regarded as fatal to the unity and integrity of the Empire.\n\nBetween the retirement of Lord Elgin and the establishment of Confederation, one outstanding incident emphasized the increasing fullness of Canadian autonomy. On August 13, 1859, the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitted to the Governor General for the consideration of the Canadian Ministry a memorial of the Chamber of Commerce of Sheffield protesting against protective duties imposed by a Canadian statute of that year. The Secretary of State, while declaring that he would advise Her Majesty to assent to the measure (which had been\n\n[Page 47]\n\nreserved for assent by the Governor General, Sir Edmund Head), undertook to lecture the Canadian Government, and incidentally the Canadian Legislature, upon the unwisdom of its fiscal policy. The reply to this despatch enclosed a report of the Minister of Finance, Sir A. T. Galt, concurred in by the Cabinet; it has been quoted many times, but it cannot be omitted from any survey of constitutional landmarks. The important passages are as follows:\n\n“From expressions used by His Grace in reference to the sanction of the Provincial Customs Act, it would appear that he had even entertained the suggestion of its disallowance; and though happily Her Majesty has not been so advised, yet the question having been thus raised, and the consequences of such a step, if ever adopted, being of the most serious character, it becomes the duty of the Provincial Government distinctly to state what they consider to be the position and rights of the Canadian Legislature.\n\n“Respect to the Imperial Government must always dictate the desire to satisfy them that the policy of this country is neither hastily nor unwisely formed; and that due regard is had to the interests of the Mother Country as well as of the province. But the Government of Canada acting for its Legislature and people cannot, through those feelings of deference which they owe to the Imperial authorities, in any way waive or diminish the right of the people of Canada to decide for themselves both as to the mode and extent to which taxation shall be imposed. The Provincial Ministry are at all times ready to afford explanations in regard to the acts of the Legislature to which they are party; but subject to their duty and allegiance to Her Majesty, their responsibility in all general questions of policy must be to the Provincial Parliament, by whose confidence they administer the affairs of the country; and in the imposition of taxation, it is so plainly necessary that the administration and the people should be in accord, that the former cannot admit responsibility or require approval beyond that of the local\n\n[Page 48]\n\nLegislature. Self-government would be utterly annihilated if the views of the Imperial Government were to he preferred to those of the people of Canada. It is therefore the duty of the present Government distinctly to affirm the right of the Canadian Legislature to adjust the taxation of the people in the way they deem best, even if it should unfortunately happen to meet the disapproval of the Imperial Ministry. Her Majesty cannot be advised to disallow such acts, unless her advisers are prepared to assume the administration of the affairs of the Colony irrespective of the views of its inhabitants.” 59\n\nThere was some further discussion, but Galt’s constitutional position remained unchallenged. His reply ranks among our great state papers, and it set at rest forever any doubt as to Canada’s control of her fiscal system.\n\nThe union of the four original Provinces which came into effect on July 1, 1867, was an event of momentous consequence to the British Empire, and not without its significance to the world, in which that Empire plays so great a part.60 It paved the way to a truer conception of the conditions and relations upon which the permanence of the Empire might be securely founded ; it eventually led British statesmen to the wider outlook already attained beyond the seas; it was an essential step to secure for the Dominions their present voice and influence in the Empire’s affairs; and it crowned the endeavour of a century during which the initiative in constitutional development had been taken by colonial statesmen.\n\nMr. Goldwin Smith has declared that the real parent of Confederation was deadlock.61 He al-\n\n[Page 49]\n\nludes, of course, to the almost unsurmountable difficulties which prevented any reasonable stability of government in the old Province of Canada for many years immediately before 1867. In the four years from 1854 to 1858, there were no less than six different administrations.62 Between 1841 and 1867, eighteen different ministries were formed.63 During that period no government held office for more than three years and nine months. But the view advanced by Goldwin Smith has not equal force so far as Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were concerned. In 1864, Sir Charles Tupper, then Premier of Nova Scotia, had carried in the Legislature of that Province a resolution favouring a legislative union of the Maritime Provinces. He explained, in speaking to the resolution, that he regarded his proposal as a step towards a wider union.\n\nSuch union had been the dream of Canadian statesmen for many years. Sir George Cartier, George Brown, John Sandfield Macdonald, D’Arcy McGee, John Ross, and Sir John Macdonald himself had been its earnest advocates; but, perhaps more than any other, Sir A. T. Galt had led the way with practical suggestions. In July, 1858, he moved a resolution in the Legislature of Canada, affirming the desirability of a federal union of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island with Canada and the Western territories. When the Cartier-Macdonald adminis-\n\n[Page 50]\n\ntration was formed in 1858, Galt became Inspector General upon condition that the Government would accept his confederation policy. A committee of the Executive Council (Cartier, Ross, and Galt) was appointed to confer with the British Government on this and other questions. Their official communication to Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton was accompanied by a confidential letter prepared by Galt and signed by the members of the committee. It is remarkable, as his biographer has pointed out, that the scheme of union as proposed by him, and especially the division of powers between the Dominion and Provincial authorities, was in nearly every important respect followed in the Quebec resolutions and in the British North America Act.64\n\nPolitical animosity and party strife were intense and bitter in Upper and Lower Canada as well as in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Let us remember with pride and gratitude that on this and other notable occasions patriotism and duty raised the hearts of men above party and above self. Especially is a tribute of honour and respect due to the memory of John A. Macdonald and George Brown, men of strong personality and of intense feeling. Both politically and personally, they were bitterly opposed to each other; without their powerful cooperation the project of union could not have been realized. Even after Confederation there was extreme difficulty in forming an administration, and it should not be forgotten that Tupper\n\n[Page 51]\n\nand D’Arcy McGee renounced just ambitions and acknowledged claims to consideration, in order that a Government with some assurance of permanence might be established in 1867.\n\nThe second Taché-Macdonald administration was formed on March 20, 1864, and sustained an adverse vote in the Assembly on June 14. Within three years four administrations had gone down to defeat, and two general elections had not resulted in the establishment of stable government. On the morning of June 15, Brown, in a spirit of unselfish patriotism, made advances to supporters of the administration; and as a result of negotiations that were fully disclosed by Sir John Macdonald to the Assembly on June 22, a Coalition Government was formed which included Brown, Mowat, and McDougall. Brown had desired a larger representation of his supporters, but Macdonald declined this on the ground that the acceptance of such a proposal would alienate necessary support. As it was, the coalition was by no means popular, and McDougall, who had entered the Cabinet with Brown, met defeat at a by-election in North Ontario despite Macdonald’s strong appeal to the electors on his behalf. Brown was personally unwilling to enter the Government, and it should be remembered to his credit that he used his powerful influence to bring about a reluctant acceptance by his following of proposals which Macdonald and his colleagues were unwilling and probably unable to modify.\n\n[Page 52]\n\nDelegates from the three Maritime Provinces met in Charlottetown on September 1, 1864, to discuss proposals for a Maritime Union. A delegation from the new Coalition Government proceeded to Charlottetown and placed before the Maritime delegates their scheme for a larger union. As a result the Quebec Conference assembled on October 10, and continued in session until October 28. Upon the resolutions passed at that Conference the British North America Act of 1867 was based. In 1866 delegates from the United Province of Canada and from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick met in London, and their deliberations resulted in the Act as it eventually passed the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the letters of Sir John Macdonald and Sir A. T. Galt we have a curious picture of the attitude of British statesmen of the day; their indifference, their lack of vision, and their apparent relief at the prospect that the northern half of the North American continent would pass out of the orbit of the British Empire, are astonishing and even bewildering. Macdonald has left it on record that “the Union was treated by them much as if the British North America Act were a private Bill uniting two or three English parishes.” 65 Galt in a letter to his wife, dated January 14, 1867, said: “I cannot shut ‘my eyes to the fact that they want to get rid of us. . . . Day by day I am more oppressed with the sense of responsibility of main-\n\n[Page 53]\n\ntaining a connection undesired here and which exposes us to such peril at home . . . even Macdonald is rapidly feeling as I do.” 66 Such was the impression created by British statesmen upon men whose whole desire and purpose was to maintain the unity of the Empire, and to create on this continent a great nation within the ambit of the Britannic system. In later years, and especially since the beginning of the present century, a truer conception has been vouchsafed to statesmen of the Mother Country. Their spirit of indifference or repulsion half a century ago had a certain corrective in the unfriendly attitude of American statesmen of the same period, which was due to misunderstanding and irritation arising out of the events of the Civil War, and which undoubtedly had its effect upon Canadian public opinion of the day. It is a singular reflection that in this respect the policy of American rather than that of British statesmen aided in the maintenance of Canada’s connection with Britain. Fortunately the spirit in both the United Kingdom and the United States has wholly changed; and to-day Canada gladly serves as a herald of good will and co-operation between the two great Commonwealths.\n\nIn this brief summary of constitutional events extending over a period of more than one hundred years, we have seen Canada emerge from military dictatorship to the position of a Crown Colony, and thence to the status of a dependency enjoying\n\n[Page 54]\n\nrepresentative institutions. We have followed briefly the struggles and disorders which resulted in the attainment of responsible government, without full comprehension of the conventions and principles upon which its successful operation depended. Afterward came the difficult years in which the lessons of responsible government were learned by experience. Differences of race, language, temperament, and ideal created groups which made stable government impracticable, and strengthened the influences that led to Confederation. But during all this period Canada became more and more endowed with the attributes of complete self-government, until, in 1867, the four original Provinces fronting the Atlantic and reaching toward the Pacific stood before the world as a united Dominion. Already there was the germ of a national spirit, and Canada slowly awakened to the greatness of her destiny.\n\nSECOND LECTURE\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FROM CONFEDERATION TO THE WORLD WAR1\n\nIT IS not my purpose nor is there occasion to dwell at any length upon the provisions of the British North America Act. In the preamble it is recited that Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick had expressed their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown, “with a Constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.” This would seem to set at rest any question as to executive responsibility, but, in more than one instance, the Colonial Office proved that its vision was still obscured by old traditions.\n\nThe provisions of any constitutional Act are necessarily of so general a character that judicial interpretation is required. Thus no inconsiderable influence upon our Constitution has been exercised by the body of judicial decisions which has grown up in the examination and construction of its provisions by the Courts. Like all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention. Lord Bryce has pointed out the considerable effect of such influence in the United States: “The American Constitution\n\n[Page 56]\n\nhas changed, is changing, and by the law of its existence must continue to change in its substance and practical working, even when its words remain the same. “Time and habit”, said Washington, “are at least as necessary to fix the true character of Governments as of other human institutions”: and while “habit fixes some things, time remoulds others.” 2\n\nIn considering constitutional relations between Canada and other parts of the Empire, we observe that the British North America Act sets forth with no little particularity the distribution, between the Dominion and the Provincial Governments, of sovereign powers in domestic affairs. Such powers in their entirety seem to be limited only by the reservation of disallowance to the British Government, and by previous unrepealed enactments of the British Parliament applicable to the Dominions. As no formal attempt was made to define the constitutional relations between the British and Canadian Governments, those relations were free to develop by the same slow and sure steps which had built up the system of government now obtaining in the United Kingdom. Unfettered by a written constitution in the ordinary acceptation of the term, that system has been moulded and is controlled by custom and convention to a remarkable extent. In the words of Lord Bryce, “the always changing Constitution becomes interpenetrated by custom.” 3 Anson puts it in much the same way:\n\n[Page 57]\n\n“If in our Constitution ‘we find that law and custom diverge, we must note first what is the law, and then how it has been overgrown by custom.” 4 Lowell employs another happy phrase: “The conventions are superimposed upon the law, and modify political relations without in the least affecting legal ones.” 5 In an interesting contribution to the history and study of relations between the nations of the British Commonwealth, Mr. H. Duncan Hall points out the vast scope of changes that may be effected through new conventions of the Constitution.6\n\nIn tracing constitutional development, it is useful to consider it in relation to the executive, the legislative, and the international functions of the instruments of government. This arrangement of the subject, if not strictly logical, will be found convenient. But before entering upon this phase it is important to examine the advance in methods of consultation and cooperation between the Governments of the British Commonwealth.\n\nTwenty years after the Union the first Colonial Conference was held in 1887. The intention to hold it was referred to in the Queen’s speech on the prorogation of Parliament. It was purely consultative; and, while many questions of common concern were discussed, probably the main purpose of the British Government was to find some method of\n\n[Page 58]\n\nmore effective co-operation in defence. At that time there was no conception of relations with the Colonies other than as subordinates, and apparenty there was no suggestion that they were to be consulted or even informed as to foreign relations. The representatives of Canada were not members of the Canadian Government, and the Conference was not between Governments as such.\n\nThe Conference of 1894 was summoned by the Canadian Government, and was held at Ottawa. Its genesis was the proposal for a conference between Canada and Australia respecting cable communication, but it developed into a gathering at which not only the Australian Colonies, but New Zealand and the Cape of Good Hope were represented. Lord Jersey held a watching brief on behalf of the British Government. Sir Mackenzie Bowell, Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce, was appointed President.\n\nThe third Conference was held in London in 1897, on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Only Prime Ministers had been summoned to the Jubilee, and, consequently, only Prime Ministers attended the Conference. The opinion was expressed that periodical conferences between representatives of the Dominions and of the United Kingdom were desirable, and a resolution to that effect was passed.\n\nThe fourth Conference was held in 1902, on the occasion of King Edward’s Coronation; subjects\n\n[Page 59]\n\nwere indicated in the invitation to the delegates, and Ministers from the Dominions attended to assist the Prime Ministers. A formal resolution was passed favouring the holding of such conferences at intervals not exceeding four years, at which “questions of common interest could be discussed and considered, as between the Colonial Secretary and the Prime Ministers of the self-governing Colonies.” The consultations were not to be with the British Government but with one of its departments, to which the Dominions were supposed in some measure to be attached.\n\nIn 1905, Mr. Lyttelton, then Colonial Secretary, addressed a despatch to the Dominions in which he proposed that the Colonial Conference should be transformed into an Imperial Council. Great Britain was to be represented by the Colonial Secretary; and the other members of the Council were to be the Prime Ministers of the Dominions or representatives appointed for that purpose by their Governments. India was to be represented whenever her interests might require it. It was also proposed to establish in London a permanent Commission or Secretariat of the Imperial Council, for the purpose of maintaining gontinuity between the periodical meetings. All of the Dominions except Canada approved of the proposal. The Canadian Government expressed the View that “the term Council indicates a more formal assembly possessing an advisory and deliberative character\n\n[Page 60]\n\nand in conjunction with the word ‘Imperial’ suggesting a permanent constitution, which, endowed with a continuous life, might eventually come to be regarded as an encroachment upon the full measure of autonomous, administrative and legislative power enjoyed by all the self-governing Colonies.” However, they agreed that the designation might be changed from “Colonial Conference” to “Imperial Conference.” When the Conference assembled in 1907, the British Government withdrew its proposal for an Imperial Council, and the constitution of future conferences was settled in a resolution that marked a new departure.7 Future conferences were to be held between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Governments of the self-governing Dominions; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was to be President ex-officio, and the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and the Colonial Secretary were to be ex-officio members. Firm insistence by Canada and Australia upon conferences between Governments and not between the Colonial Office and the Dominions met with success, as was inevitable. The resolution was a notable step in constitutional development.8\n\nThe Conference of 1911 was summoned under the arrangements approved in 1907. In 1915, the Conference was postponed by reason of the war. It was summoned again in 1917 and in 1918; reference will be made later to important developments which the war brought about in those years; and\n\n[Page 61]\n\nresolutions other than those relating to the constitution of the conferences will be alluded to, as far as may be necessary, in connection with subjects to which they are relevant.\n\nIn the discussion of executive competence it is important to examine the status and functions of the Governor General. Before 1848 he was regarded as an Imperial officer responsible primarily to the British Government through the Colonial Office. With the progress of responsible government, there came a necessary change in his relation to the administration of public affairs.\n\nIn Canada this relation is the same in all essential respects as that of the King in Great Britain. The administration of public affairs is conducted by Ministers responsible to Parliament, and the Governor General acts by their advice.9 By convention, his appointment is subject to the approval of the government of the day, and his functions as an Imperial officer are formal rather than real: his office as representative of the Crown exhibits the constitutional unity of the Empire. The development which has led to this result has been gradual but certain, and it has necessitated at times a firm stand by Canadian statesmen.\n\nAmong the many great public services of the late Hon. Edward Blake, a distinguished graduate of this University, for many years its Chancellor,\n\n[Page 62]\n\nwas his success in procuring a most important modification of the Governor General’s Instructions. In 1876, a despatch from the Colonial Secretary (Lord Carnarvon) explained a proposal to issue permanent Letters Patent and Instructions, to which the Commissions to be issued to successive Governors General would refer. Under the previous practice a special Commission and Instructions had been issued on each appointment. The form of permanent Instructions proposed was of an extraordinary character and apparently a reversion to the Crown Colony type.10 There were clauses providing that the Governor General should preside at meetings of Council; that he might dissent from the opinion of the major part, or of the whole thereof, in executing his “powers and authorities”; and that he should consult the Council except when in his judgment Her Majesty’s service would sustain prejudice by such consultation, or when the matters were very urgent or unimportant. In capital cases the Governor was to receive the advice of Ministers, but he was to extend or withhold pardon and reprieve according to his own deliberate judgment, whether the members of Council concurred or not.11 It was apparent that the wisdom of the Colonial Office had not increased with years. Mr. Blake, then Minister of Justice, visited England in 1876, and secured an entirely new form of Instructions, which was issued in 1878, and in which the only provision that the Governor\n\n[Page 63]\n\nGeneral might act except on the advice of Ministers related to the exercise of the pardoning power, viz.: that in any case in which a pardon or reprieve might directly affect the interests of the Empire, or of any country or place beyond the jurisdiction of the Dominion Government, the Governor General should take those interests especially into his own personal consideration in conjunction with the advice of the Ministers.12\n\nIt was an important feature of the British North America Act that the power to disallow Provincial Acts, or to refuse assent to those reserved by a Lieutenant Governor, was vested in the Canadian, and not in the British Government.13 There was more than one reactionary attempt by the Colonial Office to usurp this authority.14 In 1869, the Governor General (Sir John Young) informed the Colonial Secretary of his view that it should be exercised upon the advice of the Privy Council of the Dominion, and he requested specific instructions. In reply, Lord Granville emphasized the duty of the Governor General as an Imperial officer,‘ and directed him to exercise his own judgment, even against the advice of Ministers, in case a Provincial enactment was in his opinion “gravely unconstitutional or ultra vires or objectionable on grounds of Imperial policy.” If, however, Ministers advised disallowance of any Provincial Act, as illegal or unconstitutional, he should follow that advice. Subsequently in 1873,\n\n[Page 64]\n\nthe Colonial Secretary (Lord Kimberley), thus instructed the Governor General as to certain Acts of the New Brunswick Legislature: “This is a matter in which you must act on your own individual discretion, and on which you cannot be guided by the advice of your responsible Ministers.” In 1875, the Canadian Government, by Minute of Council, took direct issue on this question, and affirmed that the Governor General in such cases must act upon the advice of Ministers. Lord Carnarvon, who had succeeded as Colonial Secretary, was not inclined to accept this view; and in December, 1875, Mr. Blake, then Minister of Justice, in an elaborate report, approved by Minute of Council, again asserted the Canadian position. Further communications from Lord Carnarvon were met by Mr. Blake with equal firmness.15 The Canadian position was maintained, and the view advanced by the Colonial Office may be regarded as having been definitely abandoned.\n\nIn discussing legislative competence it is not my purpose to attempt any examination of the numerous questions which have arisen upon the construction of the British North America Act in its distribution of legislative authority between the Dominion and Provincial Governments; but there are other aspects in which the subject must be considered. The Act provides that the Governor\n\n[Page 65]\n\nGeneral may assent to any bill, or that he may reserve it for the signification of the Queen’s pleasure; that in case he assents to a bill, the Queen in Council may within two years disallow the Act, and such disallowance shall annul the Act from the date of signification thereof by the Governor General; and that any bill reserved for the signification of the Queen’s pleasure shall not have force unless within two years the assent of the Queen in Council is signified.\n\nIt appears that but one Act of the Dominion Parliament has been disallowed. It was passed in 1873, and empowered any committee of the Senate or House of Commons to examine witnesses upon oath when so authorized by resolution. There was confusion of opinion as to the competency of Parliament to enact it. The law officers of the United Kingdom eventually advised that the Act was ultra vires, and it was accordingly disallowed for that reason and not upon considerations of policy.16 Disallowance of either Dominion or Provincial legislation on this ground is practically obsolete. Such questions are properly for the Courts. Several Acts, however, have been reserved, and some of them have not gone into operation as they did not receive the assent of the Queen in Council. For example, an Act of 1868, reducing the salary of the Governor General from £10,000 to £6,500, was so reserved, and failed to receive the assent of the Queen in Council.\n\n[Page 66]\n\nProbably this course was taken with the consent, if not at the instance, of the Canadian Government. The power of disallowance has not been exercised by the British Government for more than fifty years, and while it still has a legal existence, it may be regarded as constitutionally dead. Similarly the power of reservation has been little used in recent practice, as a suspending clause is usually inserted in any measure, the provisions of which require negotiation with the British Government or further consideration or action by the Dominion Government before they may properly become operative.17\n\nAn important question arose in 1889 with respect to legislative competence in regard to copyright. The Dominion Act of 1889, which with minor modifications in form, but not in principle, found place as Part II of the Copyright Act, Revised Statutes, 1906, Chapter 70, contained a provision that it should not go into force until proclaimed by the Governor in Council. The concurrence of the Government of the United Kingdom was considered necessary, because the Act dealt with a subject on which Imperial legislation extending to all the British Dominions had been enacted before Confederation.18 Sir John Thompson’s report to Council, dated August 3, 1889, pointed out that the copyright system then in force under Imperial and Canadian legislation had been found most unsuitable to Canada.19 In examining the long and\n\n[Page 67]\n\nsomewhat irritating correspondence which ensued between the Canadian Government and the Government of the United Kingdom, one observes in the attitude of the Copyright Association and of the British Society of Authors the old theory of colonial subordination. This is not surprising, as their representative seems to have been less intelligent than aggressive. Sir John Thompson encountered a remarkable and unfortunate lack of vision and comprehension on the part not only of the Colonial Office but of the entire British Government. Under the inspiration of interested organizations in Great Britain, they evinced a spirit very similar to that which had induced the protest against Canadian fiscal legislation. British ministers from 1889 to 1894 seemed either incapable of appreciating or unwilling to accept constitutional realities reluctantly recognized by their predecessors in 1859. Against the constitutional right of Canada they set up the legal power of the British Parliament, and their attitude was distinctly reactionary. After Sir John Thompson’s death domestic controversy on political questions of absorbing interest caused the copyright question to lapse into the background. Mr. Keith,20 in his discussion of it, concludes that the legal power was in the British Parliament, but that the constitutional right was undoubtedly with Canada. “His [Sir John Thompson’s] constitutional claim could not possibly have been resisted for a moment, if seriously examined.\n\n[Page 68]\n\nTo insist that Canada should conform her copyright legislation to that of the United Kingdom, merely to please the publishers in the latter, was constitutionally a monstrous doctrine, nor can it be wondered that the Minister described the state of the law as odious and unjust.” 21 A few years later the British publishers and authors realized that their attitude might eventually prove detrimental to their own interests. Upon further consideration of the question at a conference held in London in 1910 (under the arrangement for subsidiary conferences, arrived at in 1907), it was finally determined that, with respect to copyright, the Dominions must be free to legislate as they saw fit. Accordingly the Imperial Copyright Act of 1911 repeals the enactments against which Thompson protested, and does not itself extend to any Dominion unless declared by the legislature thereof to be in force therein; and such legislature may at any time repeal any enactments relating to copyright passed by the Imperial Parliament, including the Act of 1911, so far as operative within that Dominion. Thus the principle for which Thompson contended so long and so forcibly was eventually recognized and established, as, in the very nature of things, it was bound to be.22\n\nThe power to legislate respecting naturalization has been attended with less controversy. Previous to 1914 there was provision in the United Kingdom and in each Dominion for the naturaliza-\n\n[Page 69]\n\ntion of aliens; but such naturalization, when obtained in a Dominion, had no effect outside the country in which it was granted. Thus a person naturalized in a Dominion was in the United Kingdom an alien. The subject was discussed at the Imperial Conference in 1907, and again in 1911. Much negotiation took place subsequently between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Governments of the Dominions. In the end an arrangement was reached, and in 1914 an Act was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, providing for the issue by the Secretary of State of a certificate of naturalization to an alien on proof of five years’ residence and the fulfilment of certain conditions as to character and other requisites. To preserve the autonomous authority of each Dominion, it was declared that these provisions are not to have force within any Dominion unless adopted by its legislature. They were so adopted in Canada in 1914. The naturalization thus granted takes effect in all parts of the Empire that have adopted the Act. Under its terms, local naturalization has the same efiect as heretofore but the Canadian statute providing therefor has been repealed.\n\nWith regard to merchant shipping, however, there has been much confusion and no little controversy concerning the legislative powers of Dominion Parliaments. The British Act of 1854 was revised and consolidated in 1894. In the meantime\n\n[Page 70]\n\ncertain enactments of the Canadian Parliament had been validated by Imperial legislation, such validation being regarded as necessary in so far as the Canadian legislation was inconsistent with the Act of 1854. Apparently this situation was not taken into account when the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Act of 1894, which repealed the Act of 1854 and all amendments thereto. The subject was discussed at the Imperial Conference of 1911, and Mr. Brodeur, then Canadian Minister of Marine and Fisheries, pointed out the difficulties. Sir Joseph Ward had moved a formal resolution demanding that wider legislative powers should be entrusted to the self-governing Dominions with respect to British and foreign shipping. Sir Wilfrid Laurier took the ground that by the British North America Act Canada had received plenary power to legislate in such matters. In the end Canada and New Zealand voted for the resolution and the other four parties at the Conference abstained. The questions raised are by no means free from difficulty, and it is apparent that further confusion and controversy will ensue and continue unless the whole question is considered from every point of view, and a definite agreement reached as to the conditions and limitations governing the exercise of legislative power by the United Kingdom and by each of the Dominions with regard to the subject.\n\nThe incidents relating to the exercise of legisla-\n\n[Page 71]\n\ntive authority in connection with military and naval defence will be considered in a subsequent lecture. For the present it is sufficient to say that during the period in question the legislative competence of the Canadian Parliament in this respect was fully recognized.\n\nThe Canadian people accomplished Confederation by means of a statute enacted at their instance by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Necessary amendments have been effected by subsequent Acts passed by that Parliament upon joint resolution of the Senate and Commons of Canada, and no such amendment has been refused. Thus the legal powers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom have been utilized as a convenient means of eflecting constitutional amendments. Doubtless the Canadian Parliament would hesitate to pass any such resolution if its effect could properly be regarded as a violation of the original compact between the Provinces. In any such case it would be proper, and indeed necessary, to obtain the consent of every Province affected by the proposed amendment.\n\nWith the material growth and constitutional development of the oversea nations the Parliament of the United Kingdom has ceased to be an Imperial Parliament in any real sense so far as the Dominions are concerned. Its legal power is subject to the limitations of constitutional right. Theoretically it has power to impose direct taxation or compul-\n\n[Page 72]\n\nsory military service upon the people of any Dominion; constitutionally and practically it possesses no such right or authority. The exercise of any power contrary to established or developing conventions would have legal sanction, but would not be respected, and in the end could not be enforced. In practice the position is becoming tolerably clear; in theory there remains a singular anomaly. Apprehensions may be quieted if we remember that under our system of government many such anomalies may be observed. The King’s veto is legally existent but constitutionally dead. Effective administration of public affairs would be impossible if any instrument of government should continually exercise its legal powers to the legal limit.\n\nIn considering international relationships we find an impressive development with respect to the negotiation of commercial and other treaties specially affecting Canadian interests. The present status was reached in successive stages of a long journey. In 1870 (March 16), Mr. Huntington, in the Canadian Commons, moved a resolution declaring, inter alia, that great advantage would result from placing the Government of the Dominion in direct communication with the several states that might be willing to negotiate commercial arrangements. On March 21, Sir A. T.\n\n[Page 73]\n\nGalt moved an amendment, which in this respect was substantially the same as the original resolution. After considerable debate an amended resolution was adopted declaring that any attempt to enter into a treaty with a foreign power without the strong and direct support of the Mother Country as the principal party must fail. Events of later years have by no means borne out this view.\n\nWith much misgiving, and not a little reluctance, Sir John Macdonald in 1871 became one of the British commissioners at the conference that resulted in the Treaty of Washington. Many questions were involved, some of the widest Imperial concern, others having direct relation to Canada alone. The British commissioners were Lord de Grey, Sir Stalford Northcote, Lord Tenterden, and Mr. (later Sir) Montague Bernard. The inner history of the conference, as detailed by Sir John Macdonald, is not pleasant reading.23 He was much concerned at the apparent disposition of the British commissioners to make concessions at the expense of Canada in order to bring about a more advantageous settlement of the difficulties in which the Government of the United Kingdom had become involved. The Treaty of 1818, relating to the Inshore Fisheries of Canada, had been carried into effect by an Imperial Statute (59 Geo. III, cap. 38). When Macdonald stoutly maintained Canadian interests, Lord Tenterden\n\n[Page 74]\n\nsuggested that this statute might be repealed and Canada left helpless. According to Macdonald’s report,24 the British commissioners seemed to have only one thing in their minds: “to go home to England with a treaty in their pockets settling everything, at no matter what cost to Canada.” At one time he contemplated withdrawing from the Commission, but refrained by reason of the grave results that would follow.25 He found it difficult, if not impossible, to make the Americans understand that the Government of the United Kingdom had “no dispensing power as a paramount authority which would override any action of the Canadians, When Lord de Grey tells them that England is not a despotic power, and cannot control the Canadian Parliament when it acts within its legitimate jurisdiction, they pooh-pooh it altogether.”26 Sir John seemed to have been perplexed throughout as to his duty: on the one hand he was Prime Minister of Canada; on the other, he was a British commissioner, and thus supposed to act under instructions from the British Government. In the course of his insistent struggle with the British commissioners, he appealed to the Home Government on one important point, and on April 5, he wrote: “The Home Government has backed me in a satisfactory manner, and given me rather a victory over my colleagues.” 27\n\nIn 1874, the Hon. George Brown, at the instance of the Canadian Government, was officially associ-\n\n[Page 75]\n\nated with Sir Edward Thornton, British Ambassador at Washington, for the purpose of negotiating a treaty of commerce between Canada and the United States.\n\nLate in 1878, Sir A. T. Galt was commissioned to undertake negotiations with Spain, and afterwards with France, for better commercial relations. Lord Salisbury was careful to say that they must be conducted by the British Ambassador in each instance.\n\nIn 1878, the Canadian Government desired to appoint Sir A. T. Galt High Commissioner for Canada in London and applied to the British Government to have him appointed a Commissioner when treaties were being negotiated in which Canada was interested. The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Sir Michael Hicks-Beach) made the following cavalier reply:\n\n“I have to inform you that it is not thought desirable to appoint a Canadian Commissioner to take part in the negotiation of any treaty, but if your Government desire to send a person enjoying their confidence to advise with Her Majesty’s Government, or with the British Ambassador, on any questions that may arise during the negotiations, Her Majesty’s Government will be happy to give attention to his representations.” 28\n\nThis short-sighted view soon passed into the desuetude to which equally narrow opinions of earlier days have been consigned.\n\nSir Charles Tupper, who succeeded Sir A. T. Galt as High Commissioner, contributed in great measure to this result. As Canadian representative\n\n[Page 76]\n\nat the international congress for the protection of submarine cables in 1883, he took a very independent position.29\n\nIn 1884, he obtained fuller recognition of Canada’s status in negotiating treaties with foreign countries. This right was recognized in a letter from the Foreign Office, dated July 26, 1884, containing the following extract:\n\n“If the Spanish Government are favourably disposed, the full power for these negotiations will be given to Sir Robert Morier and Sir Charles Tupper jointly. The actual negotiations would probably be conducted by Sir Charles Tupper, but the convention, if concluded, must be signed by both plenipotentiaries.” 30\n\nMr. Bayard, Secretary of State of the United States, in correspondence with Sir Charles Tupper in 1887, spoke of the difficulties which had arisen over the treaty of 1818, and used the following language:\n\n” In the very short interview afforded by your visit I referred to the embarrassment arising out of the gradual practical emancipation of Canada from the control of the Mother Country and the consequent assumption by that community of attributes of autonomous and separate sovereig-nty, not, however, distinct from the Empire of Great Britain. The awkwardness of this imperfectly developed sovereignty is felt most stron"
