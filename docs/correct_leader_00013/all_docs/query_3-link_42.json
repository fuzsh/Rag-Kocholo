        "text": "The monument\n\nThe War of 1812 monument was created by Toronto sculptor Adrienne Alison. Entitled Triumph Through Diversity, the monument commemorates the 200th anniversary of the conflict. Its central granite base symbolizes the rocky cliff of Parliament Hill. Its granite boat-shaped bases represent maritime battles and the arches of the Parliament Buildings.\n\nThe seven bronze figures represent the key combatants that came together to defeat the American invasion. The monument reveals:\n\na Métis fighter firing a cannon\n\na woman bandaging the arm of a Voltigeur—a French combatant\n\na Royal Navy sailor pulling a rope\n\na First Nations warrior pointing into the distance\n\na Canadian militiaman raising his arm in triumph\n\na member of the British Army's Royal Newfoundland Regiment firing a musket.\n\n\"Women are Persons!\"\n\nNote\n\nThis monument has been temporarily relocated near the Senate of Canada Building. It will be returned to Parliament Hill once The Centre Block project rehabilitation project has been completed.\n\nIn 1929, five women won the Persons Case. The case led to a court ruling that declared women as persons under the law and made them eligible for appointment to the Senate in Canada.\n\nEdmonton artist Barbara Paterson created larger-than-life sculptures to commemorate the five women in a monument entitled \"Women are Persons!\"\n\nInaugurated in 2000, the sculptures show the five women celebrating their important legal victory. An empty chair allows visitors to actively participate in the monument. McClung's newspaper uses some of the actual headlines printed across Canada at the time of victory.\n\nThe five women are:\n\nThe statue\n\nThe monument was unveiled as part of Canada's 125th anniversary celebrations in 1992. Her Majesty is featured on her horse, Centenial (with one \"n\"), the former RCMP horse that was officially presented to Her Majesty in 1977.\n\nBritish Columbia sculptor Jack Harman and his staff of ten worked for two years to create this monument.\n\nBiography\n\nAs Canada's first Prime Minister and one of the Fathers of Confederation, Macdonald's role in shaping this country is unparalleled. During his years as prime minister, the young nation experienced rapid growth and prosperity. As well, Manitoba, British Columbia and Prince Edward Island joined Confederation. And the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway's transcontinental line—linking British Columbia with Eastern Canada—was driven into the ground.\n\nBiography\n\nAs a newspaper editor, politician and one of the Fathers of Confederation, George Brown first became active in politics in 1844. Having founded a newspaper in Toronto called the Globe (which became the Globe and Mail), he and his newspaper lent support first to responsible government and later to the Confederation movement. He also fought for Confederation while serving as a member of Parliament from the 1850s to 1867.\n\nBiography\n\nDuring his five years as prime minister, Mackenzie oversaw the establishment of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Office of the Auditor General of Canada. He also introduced changes to election laws that included the right to secret ballot and universal male suffrage. Sir Wilfrid Laurier described Mackenzie as one of the truest and strongest characters in Canadian history.\n\nBiography\n\nBanished early in his political career for participating in the Rebellion in Lower Canada in 1837, Sir George-Étienne Cartier would go on to be made a baronet for his integral role in Canadian Confederation. Cartier formed a joint ministry for a United Canada from 1857 to 1862 with long-time friend Sir John A. Macdonald. Cartier died in 1873 at the age of 58.\n\nThe statue\n\nDeeply affected by Cartier's death, Macdonald proposed that he be given both a state funeral and a commemorative monument. As the first monument to be erected on Parliament Hill, the competition attracted entries from Canada, the United States, Great Britain and Italy. The winner, Quebec sculptor Louis-Philippe Hébert, would go on to create three more monuments for Parliament Hill.\n\nBiography\n\nA Father of Confederation and a great orator, Irish-born Thomas D'Arcy McGee was one of the most vigorous supporters of Canadian Confederation. McGee was also known for speaking out against the Fenians, a group of Irish-Americans who sought to invade Canada in the 1860s. His opposition to this group may have caused his death. He was shot and killed in 1868, by an assassin whom many believe was a Fenian.\n\nThe monument\n\nThis monument is showcased on a circular granite base, which is etched as the face of a clock to represent the bell's role in keeping time. The bell sits on an incline, recalling its position in the ground after falling from the Tower.\n\nIn 2000, the monument was restored with the financial support of the Canadian Bankers Association.\n\nBiography\n\nAs prime minister during the First World War, Sir Robert Borden made a significant contribution to Canada's nationhood. He argued successfully that Canada and other countries in the British Empire should be recognized as autonomous nations, both in command of their own troops and in treaty negotiations at the end of the war. In 1918, his government passed the Women's Franchise Act, giving all women the right to vote in federal elections.\n\nBiography\n\nAs Canada's 13th prime minister, from 1957 to 1963, John Diefenbaker introduced the Canadian Bill of Rights and extended the vote to include Native peoples. He was also the first prime minister to appoint a woman to the federal cabinet. He served as a member of the House of Commons until his death in 1979."
