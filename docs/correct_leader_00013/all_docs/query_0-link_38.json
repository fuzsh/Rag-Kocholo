        "text": "Named after the eighth prime minister of Canada, one of our more recent projects led us into Canada’s Capital Region at Sir Robert Borden High School.\n\nOpened in 1969 and neighboured by the head office of the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, the school currently serves upwards of 825 students at their west-end Ottawa campus.\n\nAs part of a large project, our team was commissioned by the school board to aid in upgrading the existing fixed seating located inside the school’s auditorium. Serving as a meeting place for assemblies and dramatic presentations over the years, key stakeholders from the school board deemed the existing seating as outdated and were looking for a new solution that would serve the school and its students for years to come.\n\nAfter evaluating the auditorium, our team was on-site to perform measurements and seat counts. With a uniquely sloping upward floor, much had to be brought into consideration from an installation standpoint.\n\nWorking closely with our partners at Enstone Construction on the project, our team was quick to present a new seating option to the school board and work quickly commenced.\n\nIn total, stakeholders from the school board selected 383 new auditorium seats complete with padded inserts. Before their installation however, the existing seating needed to be removed. Working diligently, our team organized the complete removal and disposal of the existing seats and floor mounted each new one in place once complete.\n\nToday, the auditorium continues to serve as a hub for students and staff members alike with comfortable and durable new seating."
