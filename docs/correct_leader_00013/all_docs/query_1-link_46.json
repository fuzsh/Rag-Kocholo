        "text": "‘Let the past bury its dead, but for God's sake let us get down to earnest endeavour and hold this line until … the end.’ No other words can more adequately express, after four years of war, the sheer agony of the Canadian Prime Minister, Sir Robert L. Borden. These words also suggest both his attitude to the war in general and his intense frustration with die supreme direction. Like Lloyd George, Borden was an exponent of total war and of victory. His proclamation that Canada was ‘fighting not for a truce but victory’, was strikingly similar to Lloyd George's own declaration that ‘the fight must be to a finish—to a knockout’. The objective, proclaimed at die conclusion of the Somme battles, seemed no less remote in the middle of 1918. Over the last two, and most critical, years of the First World War there was constant contention within Britain over how the objective was to be secured. One aspect of the contention was the direct involvement of Dominion leaders, especially Sir Robert Borden.\n\n11 Amery MSS, E.69/Ib, Memorandum, ‘Imperial Conference’, 21 Dec. 1916. Amery's account of his part is in ibid. E.59, Amery to W. M. Hughes, 8 Jan. 1917; Amery to Sir J. P. Fitzgerald, 7 Apr. 1917; Amery Diary, 2 May 1917 and 26 Dec. 1918. The Agenda is in Amery MSS, E.59, Amery to Hankey, 29 Jan. 1917; Cab. 23/1, W.C. 67(13), Appendix I, ‘Agenda for the Forthcoming Special War Cabinet Meetings with Representatives of the Dominions and India’. Note by the Secretary, 15 Feb. 1917.\n\n135 Borden MSS, O'C. 515, Milner MSS, Box A-D/13, Amery to Borden, 11 June 1918, enclosing ‘Policy in the Eastern Theatre’, by Maj.-Gen. J. Knox, 9 June 1918. Expression of support was given by Lloyd George in I.W.C. 15, 10 June; Balfour in I.W.C. 19, 20 June; Curzon in I.W.C. 20, 25 June, and Smuts and Milner in I.W.C. 31, 14 Aug. and I.W.C. 32, 15 Aug. 1918.\n\n141 I.W.C. 27C, 6 Aug. 1918.
