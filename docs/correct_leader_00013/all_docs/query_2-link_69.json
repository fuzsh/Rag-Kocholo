        "text": "Canada’s population at the start of the First World War was barely 8 million people. A significant majority of English-speaking Canadians were British-born or the children of British immigrants; about 28 percent of Canadians were of French ethnic origin. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from other parts of Europe had also settled in Canada in the previous 15 years.\n\nCONSCRIPTION\n\nGreat controversy over Canadian participation in the South African War (1899-1902) and the creation of a Canadian navy in 1910 had split the nation along linguistic lines and shaken national unity. Several months after the start of the First World War with voluntary enlistments remaining high, Prime Minister Robert Borden made a pledge that there would be no conscription for overseas service. His original promise to dispatch 25,000 volunteers was easily attained and this soon rose to 50,000. In June 1915, the Government promised 150,000 men for the war effort and in autumn this figure jumped to 250,000. On 1 January 1916, Borden doubled the commitment again to 500,000, a barely attainable figure from voluntary enlistments alone given the number of military-age men in the country. After a sharp downturn in recruiting and the more than 10,000 casualties resulting from the seizure of Vimy Ridge (on top of other heavy losses at the front), Borden announced in May 1917 that obligatory military service would become law, in order to ensure the country honoured his commitment of men to the war effort. This statement, and the ensuing Military Service Act passed at the end of August, triggered widespread discontent in French-speaking Canada, disappointment among many Canadian farmers in Ontario and the west (many of whom were non-British immigrants), and vocal opposition from organized labour. Nevertheless, 125,000 new recruits were eventually conscripted into the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Over 24,000 conscripts arrived in France in the summer and fall of 1918. They provided essential reinforcements to the Canadian Corps and made a crucial contribution to its many successes during the Hundred Days campaign that saw a victorious end to the war.\n\nCANADIAN SUPPORT FOR THE WAR\n\nDespite the controversy caused by conscription, war-mindedness in Canada remained generally strong throughout the war. Canadians felt that the cause for war was just and that Germany had committed aggression and behaved immorally in its attack on Belgium and France. Canadians happily subscribed to numerous war charities which sprang up in support of various causes including the plight of Belgian refugees or in supplying comforts to the men at the front. Canadians also purchased more than $2 billion in Victory Bonds, interest-bearing investments issued by the Government to raise funds for the war effort. The Government also introduced an income tax in 1917. Perhaps the best-known object of Canadians’ generosity was the Canadian Patriotic Fund, the aim of which was to financially support soldiers’ families left in difficulty by the men’s enlistments or, worse, through their death or maiming at the front. Tens of thousands of Canadian families felt the crush of bereavement for the nation’s more than 60,000 war dead and welcomed back nearly three times that many wounded in body or mind. For these, the war did not end with the Armistice in November 1918.\n\nWAR INDUSTRY\n\nThe war offered other Canadians economic opportunity. Despite its largely agricultural or primary-resource economy, Canadian manufacturing and industry increased massively during the war. Canada produced everything from millions of artillery shells to 3,000 aircraft, and more than 100 steel- or wooden-hulled vessels in more than 600 war-related plants and factories, employing up to a quarter of a million Canadians, including 30,000 women. Many of these women broke employment stereotypes by taking on jobs which, before the war, had been reserved for men. Canada’s farms boomed and wheat production soared, most of it for export to Britain and France. The production and exports of meat, fish, eggs, and dairy rose dramatically.\n\nTREATMENT OF \"ENEMY-ALIENS\"\n\nThe country was not always hospitable to residents of “enemy-alien” origin. Many Canadians called for the internment and incarceration of men of German or Austro-Hungarian citizenship, many of the latter being unfortunate Ukrainians who harboured no affection for their former Austrian masters. Up to 8,000 men were interned though most of the “Austrians” were released by 1917. Anti-German passions ran so high that occasionally Germans in Canada were publicly harassed, fired from their jobs, or had their businesses vandalized. In a seemingly patriotic, though by no means unanimous gesture, in 1916 the Ontario city of Berlin renamed itself Kitchener in honour of the British Secretary of War."
