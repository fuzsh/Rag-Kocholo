His leadership during\n\nWorld War One was remarkable…\n\n[The Canadian Encyclopedia, Year 2000 Edition\n\nMcClelland & Stewart Inc., Toronto, 1999]\n\nPrime Minister Robert Borden is long forgotten but shouldn’t be.\n\nTo elevate the country from colonial status, Canada had to show\n\nits mettle on the battlefields. Borden was a tough war leader who\n\ncapitalized on the valour of our fighting men in the First World War\n\nto secure greater independence from the empire.\n\n—\n\nLawrence Martin\n\nin The Globe and Mail on 16 April 2013.\n\nRobert Borden’s leadership was among the most significant by\n\nany of Canada’s early leaders. It fell on his shoulders to lead\n\nCanada through the trials and tribulations of the First World War.\n\nA generation of young Canadians gave their lives in the mud and\n\nbloody despair of the European trenches between 1914 and 1918.\n\nIn crafting the peace, however, Sir Robert did not break faith with\n\nthem, insisting that at Versailles, Canada would sign the treaty\n\nthat ended the war as a proud and independent nation.\n\nAt Paris in 1919, with the eyes of the world’s leaders upon him,\n\nSir Robert Borden did just that, putting Canada firmly on the road\n\nto full nationhood. Some of his own supporters, in fact, feared\n\nBorden was advancing the cause of Canadian sovereignty and\n\nnationhood too far and too fast. The eighth prime minister would\n\nhave none of it. That is perhaps his greatest accomplishment…\n\n— Robert Borden, Canada’s forgotten giant\n\nby Mike Duffy, in the National Post, 21September2011\n\nFormer Prince Edward Island Progressive Conservative MP and parliamentary secretary Heath Macquarrie — before 1957 he was a history professor at St.Dunstan’s (now the University of Prince Edward Island) – could make history live. Iwill never forget an afternoon in1960 when, over rum and cokes, he kept me wide-eyed with his sweep of WorldWarOne and Canada’s role at the Battle of VimyRidge. Heath said that, two years later, in1919, at the Versailles’ Peace Talks, PrimeMinister RobertBorden told the British there would be no back seat for Canada at the peace table when she had a front-row seat at Vimy Ridge.\n\n– Pat MacAdam’s column “Victory Set in Stone” in the OttawaSun, 8April2007\n\nCanada’s eighth Prime Minister, Sir Robert Borden,\n\nmade his first appearance on Canada’s $100bill in1961.\n\n– The Globe and Mail, page F10, 25June2011\n\nSir Robert Laird Borden by Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online\n\nhttp://www.biographi.ca/EN/ShowBio.asp?BioId=42133\n\nSir Robert Laird Borden by Wikipedia\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Borden"
