Sir Robert Laird Borden, PC, GCMG, KC (June 26, 1854 â€“ June 10, 1937) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as the eighth Prime Minister of Canada from October 10, 1911, to July 10, 1920, and was the third Nova Scotian to hold this office. After retiring from public life, he served as the chancellor of Queen's University.

During his term, Borden was instrumental in promoting Canada's status as a nation in and of itself, rather than a subject of the British Empire. Canada's important role in World War I gave him a strong position from which to work.

Robert Borden was the Prime Minister of Canada when the Great War began in 1914. In the early stages of the War, Jonathan Moss entertained an image of Borden and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt battling to the death in a gladiatorial arena to settle the war.[1]

When Canada was forced to surrounded to the United States in 1917, Borden stripped of his office and the Canadian government was dissolved as the country was occupied following the end of the Great War. This made Borden Canada's last Prime Minster, and after the war, he retired into relative obscurity.
