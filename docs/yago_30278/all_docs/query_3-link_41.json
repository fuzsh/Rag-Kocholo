        "text": "Eleanor Caroline Pfeifer or as close family addressed her, Grandma 5F, was a long-time resident of Rio Rancho, New Mexico for 45 years, passed peacefully in her sleep at 94 years young on Monday, November 14, 2022.\n\nShe entered this world on July 3, 1928, in Bronx, NY, born to James and Carrie Brady; brother, Owen Brady (deceased), married for 47 years to Richard Edward Pfeifer (deceased, 1995).\n\nShe is survived by her two sons, Ronald (Camilla) and Gerald whom she cherished; and her beloved grandchildren, Richard (Cara, soon to be), Caitlin, James (Sara), and Jonathan (Veronica, soon to be); great-grandchildren, Aiden, and Dean; and her dearly loved nieces, Carol Fleischmann (Bill) and Janet Jaso (Mark), and nephew, Kevin Brady.\n\nEleanor lived and worked in New York until 1977 then with her husband, Richard, they started a new chapter in their lives by moving their family to Rio Rancho, New Mexico. In 1978 Eleanor began working for the Bureau of Land Management in Albuquerque, NM and retired in 1992.\n\nEleanor was authentically and genuinely concerned with the well-being of others. Eleanor cared so much for people she would listen, ask questions, and tell stories of advice from her life or when the time was right, she elegantly 'planted a seed' of life advice when she felt it was needed.\n\nShe always welcomed family and friends into her home; typically greeting you with a warm meal at her table. The act of service through food was one of Eleanor's love languages. Eleanor continuously cooked throughout her life, often stumbling upon new recipes, and perfecting them with her considerable cooking knowledge and experience. She was regularly excited to share these new crafted recipes at family and friend gatherings and holidays, developing a gift of closeness among family that will extend beyond her life. One of her awesome family-favorite recipes was eggplant parmesan. Throughout her life she shared that love and warm memories around her dinner table.\n\nOne of the best qualities about Eleanor is she was notorious for picking up the phone at any time of day and calling you, where you would chat like best friends and pleasantly forget that an hour had passed.\n\nA large part of why Eleanor could connect and offer such relatable advice is because of her extensive travels around the world. It was common for her to bring up stories of her many adventures and unique places she and husband, Richard, traveled to during their lifetime. These are memories and places that friends and family will pass along and visit in their own lifetimes.\n\nWhen Eleanor was not out adventuring or exploring the world it seemed as if she always had some sort of project going on. She enjoyed arts and crafts such as making stained glass, sewing, quilting, and constructing a new shirt, vest or scarf for herself or a family member. As a member of a quilting club, she would share and develop new skills for her creative passions.\n\nAnother passion of Eleanor's was swimming; she enjoyed swimming so much she maintained her own swimming pool. Eleanor entertained family and friends around her pool with pride and joy, teaching all of her children and grandchildren how to swim at an early age. Summers spent around her pool with family and friends provided lasting memories that will be forever treasured and not forgotten.\n\nTo our mother, our Grandma 5F you were one of a kind, one helluva of a woman, and we adored you. Always in our minds and forever in our hearts. A woman that asked for so little but gave us so very much.\n\nEleanor will be missed by many; she had a life well lived and leaves this world a better place.\n\nThank you to Darrol, Janet, Abagail, Christian, Brandon, and Rachael at Beehive of Rio Rancho for taking such good care of Mama Eleanor.\n\nA Rosary will be held on Thursday, December 1, 2022, at 10:00 a.m., with a Mass to follow at 10:30 a.m., St Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church, 1502 Sara Rd, Rio Rancho, NM 87124, followed by burial with her beloved husband, Richard E. Pfeifer at Santa Fe National Cemetery in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at 2:00 p.m."
