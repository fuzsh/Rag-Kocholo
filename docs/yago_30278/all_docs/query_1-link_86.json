        "text": "Blanche I of Navarre (1387-1441).\n\nBlanche I (6 July 1387 – 1 April 1441) was Queen of Navarre from 1425 to 1441. She became queen regnant upon the death of her father King Charles III of Navarre. She was married twice, but only had surviving issue from her second husband, King John II of Aragon, as her only son by Martin I of Sicily died in early infancy.\n\nShe was the second eldest daughter and heir of King Charles III of Navarre and infanta Eleanor of Castile. She became heiress on the death of her elder sister Joan.\n\nBlanche married firstly Martin the Younger, King of Sicily and Prince of Aragon. They were married by proxy on 21 May 1402 in Catania. Blanche travelled to meet her new husband and they were married in person on 26 December 1402. The bride was about fifteen years old and the groom twenty-eight.\n\nMartin had been in need of legitimate heirs, as he had survived his previous wife and former co-ruler, Queen Maria of Sicily, and their only son. When Martin died on 25 July 1409, he was succeeded by his own father, Martin I of Aragon.\n\nBlanche remained a widow for a decade. On 6 November 1419, Blanche married her second husband John, duke of Peñafiel by proxy in Olite, and the second son of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque. Ferdinand had succeeded his maternal uncle Martin I in 1412.\n\nJohn travelled to meet her. On 10 June 1420, they were married in person in Pamplona. Charles III died on 8 September 1425 and Blanche succeeded him as Queen regnant of Navarre. John became King of Navarre in her right as John II.\n\nBlanche died in Santa María la Real de Nieva in 1441. After her death, John kept the government of Navarre in his own hands, from the hands of their own son Charles of Viana, the rightful heir of the line of Navarrese kings.\n\nChildren:\n\nMartin and Blanche only had one son:\n\nInfante Martin of Aragon and Sicily (1406–1407).\n\nBlanche and John II of Aragon had four children:\n\nCharles, prince of Viana (1421–1461).\n\nJoan of Navarre (1423 – 22 August 1425).\n\nBlanche (II) of Navarre, married Henry IV of Castile. The marriage was never consummated. After 13 years of marriage, Henry sought and obtained a divorce. Blanca was sent home, where her family imprisoned her.\n\nEleanor (1426–1479) Queen of Navarre (1479)."
