She was born December 1, 1927, in Bay Arkansas. She was preceded in death by both her parents, by her sister and brother, and by her beloved husband, Rolando Bachechi. Eleanor is survived by her daughter, LMarie Fulgham of Albuquerque; by her grandson, Colby (Danielle) Julian, and granddaughters Taylor and Riley Julian all of Gilbert AZ; and by her stepson, Phillip Bachechi of Albuquerque. Eleanor also leaves behind several nieces and nephews, along with a host of friends and members of her church family.\n\nEleanor was fun-loving and was both a talented seamstress and artist. She was a woman of deep Christian faith and conviction, and a member for many years of the Northeast Church of Christ here in Albuquerque.\n\nVisitation is planned for Monday, February 7, 2022, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at FRENCH-Wyoming.
