        "text": "Spanish History:\n\nMaria of Castile (1401 – 1458)\n\nShe was daughter of Henry III of Castile and Catherine of Lancaster. As the King’s eldest child, Maria was granted the title of Princess of Asturias, the title reserved for the first-in-line to the throne. Her father had her formally recognised as heiress presumptive at the Cortes of Toledo on 6 January 1402. However, the birth of her brother John (the future king) displaced the Princess in the line of succession; from that moment on, she was merely an infanta. Her childhood was quite happy by all accounts; the frailty of her health was not evident until she was a married adolescent. Her father died when she was four, leaving the crown to her only brother, John II, and making her heiress presumptive again. Her mother, Queen Catherine, governed the Crown of Castile as regent during King John II’s minority and the Infanta was able to observe her mother’s statesmanship. Mother and daughter were very close and remained in frequent correspondence even after the latter’s marriage.\n\nThe engagement of Maria and her first cousin Alfonso of Aragon was not formalised until she was seven, but it had been reconfirmed by King Henry III’s last will and testament. By the same arrangement, Maria’s brother John was to marry Alfonso’s sister Maria and Maria’s sister Catherine was to marry Alfonso’s brother Henry. The marriage of Maria and Alfonso was celebrated in the Cathedral of Valencia on 12 June 1415. The couple was wedded by Antipope Benedict XIII who had also provided a dispensation for their marriage. Less than one year later, her father-in-law King Ferdinand I of Aragon died, leaving the crown to Maria’s husband and making her Queen of Aragon.\n\nIllness prevented her from attending both her father-in-law’s and her mother’s funeral. Like all queens of Aragon except for only five (her mother-in-law included), Maria was never crowned queen. There is no evidence that the politically active Queen Eleanor of Alburquerque ever prepared her daughter-in-law for her role, as would have been customary. She was overshadowed by her formidable mother-in-law who continued to exercise strong political influence even after her husband’s death. The young Queen appeared in public only when it was necessary and refrained from taking part in politics, instead deferring to Eleanor. Maria moved into the public eye only when the queen mother’s health began detoriating.\n\nQueen Maria had a delicate health; it is possible that she had epilepsy. A bout of smallpox left her permanently scarred and unattractive. She did not have her first menstrual period until she was sixteen and the consummation of the marriage had to be delayed; the couple would have no children. The lack of children deeply affected their marriage and Alfonso’s reign. They were separated for decades. She stayed in Spain and governed as queen-lieutenant while he went off to conquer and govern Naples. The king never loved his wife, while she loved him. Queen Maria suffered her husband’s infidelities. Alfonso’s relationship with his mistress Giraldona Carlino produced three children. In love with Lucrezia d'Alagno, King Alfonso V asked for an annulment to his marriage with Maria of Castile, but Pope Callistus III refused it.\n\nMaria of Castile served as Queen Lieutenant from 1420-23 and 1432-58 in absence of her husband. The fact that Alfonso’s brothers, the infants de Aragon, did not protest María’s appointment as lieutenant may seem surprising. They were ambitious young men, but they were receptive to rule by a woman because by 1420 a queen-lieutenant was a fairly common occurrence. Five queen-consorts ruled as lieutenants in the Crown of Aragon before María did: Blanche of Naples, Teresa d’Entença, Violant of Bar, Maria de Luna and Margaret of Prades. For twenty-six years, Queen Maria maintained a royal court and council separate from and roughly equivalent to those of Alfonso in Naples. she embodied the king’s personal authority and was second only to the king himself. She presided over the Courts, administered justice, granted constitutions, issued laws, sign letters, appointed delegates and judges, and controlled governors, prelates, nobles, municipal officials, and the army.\n\nIn 1435 when her husband and his brother, John, were captured whilst trying to seize Naples, it was Maria who invoked the Corts across three realms, raised 100,000 gold florins for their ransom and organised the rescue fleet. After this incident, fearing for the life of his brother and only heir, Alfonso sent John home and had him made co-lieutenant with Maria. The Infantes of Aragon, her brothers-in-law, Henry, Peter and especially the meddlesome John would prove problematic and pertinent to Maria’s regency.\n\nOn the most part, Alfonso V seems to have had huge respect for his wife’s ability as a ruler. She was forced to handle the conflicts with the burghers and the peasants which broke out during her husband’s reign. María had strongly supported the peasants’ cause and had urged Alfonso to do the same. When he ignored her advice and revoked an earlier decree that would have ensured significant gains for the peasants, she resigned as his lieutenant (an unprecedented move). Maria of Castile won the affection and respect of her subjects."
