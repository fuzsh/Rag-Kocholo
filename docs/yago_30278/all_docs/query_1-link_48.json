        "text": "Fernando I (November 27, 1380 – April 2, 1416) was King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and (nominal) Corsica and King of Sicily, Duke (nominal) of Athens and Neopatria, and Count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya (1412–1416). He was also Regent of Castile (1406–1416).\n\nInfante Fernando was born November 27, 1380 in Medina del Campo, the younger son of King Juan I of Castile and Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Pedro IV of Aragon and his wife Eleanor of Sicily, the daughter of Peter II of Sicily and Elisabeth of Carinthia. She was the second of eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood.\n\nOn August 15, 1403 in Medina del Campo, Infante Fernando founded a new order of knighthood, the Order of the Jar.\n\nIn 1406, upon the death of his elder brother, King Enrique III of Castile, Infante Fernando declined the Castilian crown and instead, with Enrique III’s widow Catherine of Lancaster, became coregent during the minority of his nephew King Juan II of Castile. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of domestic affairs.\n\nIn a war with the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, he conquered the town of Antequera (1410), whence his surname.\n\nAfter Fernando’s maternal uncle, King Martin I of Aragon (King Martin II of Sicily), died without surviving legitimate issue, Infante Fernando was chosen King of Aragon in 1412 to succeed him in the Compromise of Caspe. The other candidate, Count James II of Urgell, revolted and King Fernando dissolved the County of Urgell in 1413.\n\nKing Fernando created the title of Prince of Girona for the heir of the Crown of Aragon on February 19, 1416.\n\nThe most notable accomplishment of his brief reign was his agreement in 1416 to depose the Anti-Pope Benedict XIII, thereby helping to end the Western Schism, which had divided the Roman Catholic Church for nearly 40 years.\n\nHe is buried in the Crown of Aragon’s royal pantheon of the monastery of Poblet, in a magnificent tomb ordered by his son Alfonso to Pere Oller in 1417.\n\nFamily and children\n\nIn 1393 Ferdinand married Eleanor of Alburquerque (1374–1435). They had seven children:\n\n1. Alfonso V of Aragon (1396–1458), king of Aragon, Sicily and Naples, married Infanta Maria of Castile\n\n2. Infanta Maria of Aragon, (1403–1445), Queen of Castile, first wife of King Juan II of Castile\n\n3. King Juan II of Aragon (1398–1479)\n\n4. Infante Enrique of Aragon (c. 1400-1445), Duke of Villena, Count of Alburquerque and Empuries, lord of Sogorb, etc. and grand master of the military Order of Santiago, married Infanta Catherine of Castile\n\n5. Infante Sancho of Aragon (c.1400–1416), grand master of the Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara\n\n6. Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, (1402–1445), Queen of Portugal, who married King Duarte I of Portugal\n\n7. Infante Pedro of Aragon (1406–1438), Count of Alburquerque and Duke of Noto\n\nAppearance and character"
