        "text": "By Terry Lunde\n\nIt was the beginning of contemporary global cinema gaining mainstream popularity, which started with the 2000 release of a surprise international success of the Mandarin-language epic wuxia martial arts action-adventure fantasy drama film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, becoming the highest-grossing foreign language film produced overseas in American history, and the first foreign language film to break the $100 million mark in the United States. Plus, it received universal acclaim from critics, and won some Oscars. Directed by Ang Lee, it features highly choreographed fight scenes and battles, stunning cinematography and visual effects, beautiful musical score and production values, and strong themes of courage and sticking to one’s values. It also stars Chow Yun-fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and Chang Chen. The film tells the story of two warriors who take on a journey to recover a stolen sword, and an infamous outlaw. For retrospective years, Crouching Tiger has often been cited as one of the finest wuxia films ever made, and widely regarded one of the greatest films in the 21st Century. Other notable 2000 released foreign language films include Battle Royale, Amores Perros, Yi Yi, and In the Mood for Love. Although, in the year 2000, the worldwide highest-grossing movie of that year was the Tom Cruise produced and starred action spy film Mission: Impossible II (while the year’s top-grosser domestically would be the Christmas-themed fantasy comedy film Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas starring Jim Carrey). This second installment in the Mission: Impossible film series was anticipated to have the biggest success, but has since been deemed inferior to the first film released in 1996. Initial reaction from critics were mixed, with praise for the action sequences and John Woo’s direction, but criticism for the characterization. The future installments released over the years after M:i-2 would end up being improvements over the first two predecessors. The 1990s had been a strong time for blockbusters, as well as an even better time for interesting groundbreaking indie and mid-budget films, with 1999 being particularly notable as one of the best. So it’s fair to say that the year 2000 had some pretty high expectations when it came to movie releases.\n\nThis was the year in which the fears of Y2K would be the end of the world were finally at an ease as we made it through the turn-of-the-century. There were no complete societal breakdowns as it was expected back in the 90s. But of course, it was the beginning of what we’re all living in right now, which is the 21st Century. It was also the first year of the new millennium, and what begins the decade of the 2000s (known as the aughts, noughties, double ohs, or what I personally often call the two-thousands). The first year of the 00s decade has been quite compelling, and now it is hard to believe that the first decade of this century has come and gone already.\n\nIn the United States presidential election of 2000, the Republican challenger George W. Bush (Then-Governor of Texas, and the eldest son of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush) defeats Democrat Incumbent Vice President Al Gore in such a narrow margin, but the final outcome was not known for over a month because of disputed votes in Florida. It was one of the closest and most controversial presidential elections we have ever had in United States history. But in the end, the U.S. Supreme Court rules to end the vote recount in Florida in the Bush v. Gore case, giving the presidency to Bush after a prolonged legal battle following the election.\n\nIn other news of events, there was the first International Space Station crew, the release of Sony’s newest gaming console in Japan called the PlayStation 2, the passage of HB847 in the state of Vermont (legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples), the release of Microsoft’s Windows 2000 and the Founder of Microsoft Bill Gates leaving his position as CEO, a huge solar flare that was known as the Bastille Day Event, the use of mobile phones continuing to grow as they move from the perceived “yuppie device” to an essential consumer product, Mad Cow Disease causing alarm in Europe due to its growth, the combination of AOL and Time Warner, the spread of a destructive computer virus ILOVEYOU, Tiger Woods becoming the youngest player to win a Grand Slam in golf, and the election of Then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to the U.S. Senate representing New York.\n\nIn pop culture, there was the rise of reality television, which had gained massive global success between the late 1990s and early 2000s; shows like Survivor were a pretty big deal during that time. There was also the latest Harry Potter book, published as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and the final new Peanuts comic strip. The hit songs back then were made by these popular musicians (to name a few): 3 Doors Down, Blink 182, U2, N Sync, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Madonna, Pink, and Britney Spears. At the time, only 3% of Americans had broadband Internet access. Without broadband, and only dial-up, it was very difficult to download music and video files. Plus, in 2000, there was the announcement by Warner Home Video that the DVD of 1999’s The Matrix had exceeded the $3 million mark in units sold in the U.S., solidifying its position as the number one best-selling DVD of all-time. This milestone would repeatedly be surpassed in subsequent years.\n\n2000 must have been a captivating year in cinema. According to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the national average ticket price for theatre admission was $5.39. Most of the films in the early part of the decade that were huge moneymakers were either comic book related, serials, animated films, based on children’s fantasy stories, or based on a theme park ride, and a lot of it really kicked off back in 2000. The Hollywood studio system was dominated by six global entertainment companies: Time Warner, Viacom, Fox, Sony, NBC Universal, and Disney. These six companies generally farmed out the production of their films to literally dozens of other independents and subsidiaries. Filmmaking studios also realized that lucrative profits could be scored by cheaply remaking, adapting, or re-treading classic TV shows or most prominently horror films. So 2000 had plenty of great films that continue to be memorable as time goes on in this current (but new at the time) century.\n\nThe year 2000 was when we had a lot of theatrical films based on television shows (e.g. Charlie’s Angels, Traffic, Mission: Impossible 2, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, and The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) and some Disney’s theme park rides (e.g. Mission to Mars and Dinosaur), as well as the releases of the first installments of what would eventually become popular film franchises (e.g. X-Men, Final Destination, Scary Movie, Unbreakable, and Meet the Parents), and re-emergences of old genres; such as epic dramas (e.g. Gladiator, The Patriot, and U-571), survival adventure films (e.g. Cast Away, The Perfect Storm, and Vertical Limit), and superhero movies (e.g. X-Men and Unbreakable). It was also quite a year for space movies; with the releases of Mission to Mars, Red Planet, Titan A.E., Pitch Black, and Space Cowboys (the latter being Clint Eastwood’s directing and acting project that used high definition television technology for the first time in a Hollywood feature).\n\nIn regards to groundbreaking visual effects, there was the release of Wolfgang Petersen’s biographical disaster drama film The Perfect Storm, which perfected the FX techniques of depicting digital water by using advanced cutting-edge software that both realistically displayed life-like droplets of water, as well as the large waves of the raging ocean. No miniatures were used, even the fishing boat was recreated digitally as it faced a climactic 150 foot crest. The live-action sequences in a water tank were seamlessly combined with the digital effects of the computer-generated seascape in the background. It was “the storm of the century”.\n\nThe films I remember seeing in theaters when I was a kid at the time were Chicken Run, Snow Day, The Emperor’s New Groove, The Kid, Dinosaur, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and Rugrats in Paris: The Movie. Dinosaur was known to be the most expensive film of that year, and the fifth highest-grossing movie of 2000. I even recall there being films with the number 2000 included in their titles (e.g. Godzilla 2000, Fantasia 2000, Dracula 2000, and Pokémon: The Movie 2000).\n\nSome other honorable mentions of popular films released in the year 2000 include Dancer in the Dark, Finding Forrester, Pollock, You Can Count on Me, Chocolat, Bedazzled, Billy Elliot, High Fidelity, Best in Show, The Cell, Remember the Titans, Wonder Boys, Miss Congeniality, Scream 3, and Snatch. However, I have made my picks and ranks based on what I personally liked, and here are my top ten favorite films from that year…\n\n10. X-Men\n\nBefore this movie was released in theaters for the public to experience, superhero films, or any comic book movies, were pretty much nearly dead. We can thank 1997’s Batman & Robin for that. The only films of this genre that many would agree were revolutionary or innovative would have to be Richard Donner’s Superman and Tim Burton’s Batman, both based on DC Comics. However, this Bryan Singer directed film was based on the Marvel Comics titled X-Men by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, and not by DC Comics. There have been Marvel comic book movies and television shows made prior to this; there was even an X-Men cartoon series, and the commercial success of 1998’s Blade (a dark superhero horror film for its time that has since garnered a cult following, and was followed by two sequels) would begin Marvel’s film success and set the stage for further comic book film adaptations. But it was this first installment of the X-Men film franchise that became Marvel’s first real big cinematic success. So much that it led to a film series of sequels, prequels, reboots, and spinoffs. It would also start a re-emergence of the comic book/superhero film genre, which remained highly popular for decades after this film was released. When X-Men came out, it was a surprise hit, and because it brought back interest towards its genre, it’s been considered one of the best superhero films ever made. I do remember this film being very popular when I was a preteen back then. What I really like about X-Men is that it maintained the social commentary that has been echoing in all the X-Men comic books since their publication in the early 1960s, which I find to be quite fascinating, and to have it released on the first year of the new century is such perfect timing for the next generations to follow and learn from. This superhero film depicts a world in which a proportion of humanity are mutants, possessed of superhuman powers, and are feared upon by normal humans. The story’s focus is on Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (played by Anna Paquin), who end up in a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches to bringing about the acceptance of mutant-kind. There’s the heroic X-Men, founded by Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart), who attempts to bring peace and justice, and hopes for co-existence between mutant-kind and humankind. And the evil Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto (played by Ian McKellen), who believes humans and mutants can never co-exist, and attempts in gaining mutant superiority over normal humans by committing acts of terrorism and devoting themselves in search for world domination. Mutant rights is the hot controversial political topic, and is addressed as a plot device. The film reflects all kinds of social issues; racism, religion, genocide, subculture, red scare, diversity, and all other real-world conflicts experienced by minority groups in America. All of it can be compared to the film’s themes. It really bestows such captivating thematic depth for a superhero movie.\n\n9. Unbreakable\n\nWe did happen to have another great superhero film released that same year, and that is M. Night Shyamalan’s Unbreakable starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Although, Unbreakable is actually an original film made directly for the screen, and not based on superhero comics. In this supernatural superhero thriller film, an ordinary security guard named David Dunn (played by Willis) survives a horrific train crash with no injuries, leading to him discovering that he harbors superhuman abilities. As he begins to grapple with this discovery, he comes to the attention of a strange disabled comic book store owner named Elijah Price (played by Jackson), who manipulates David in order to understand him. Much like a comic book superhero story, these two men are complete opposites. It’s a very well-paced slow burn thriller, with a surprise twist revelation at the end, in which we as an audience realize why Elijah is approaching David in this way. Behind The Sixth Sense (which was released a year prior, and the one film that introduced the cinema public to M. Night Shyamalan and his filmmaking trademarks), Unbreakable is perhaps the second best film Shyamalan has ever written and directed in his career. Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan has gone downhill after he started making big-budget Hollywood movies that turned out to be crap, then made some pretty good comebacks here and there, and suddenly became just mediocre. He tends to be a genius filmmaker or a total disappointment off and on. But during the years of the turn-of-the-century, he was at the top of his game, and this film (along with The Sixth Sense) was among the so few he’s made that were both acclaimed by critics and popular to a general audience. Shyamalan organized the narrative of Unbreakable to parallel a comic book’s traditional three-part story structure. After settling on the origin story, Shyamalan wrote the script as a speculative screenplay with Bruce Willis already set to star in the film (since they already worked together in The Sixth Sense), and Samuel L. Jackson in mind to portray Elijah Price. The story has such emotional weight. The performances, writing, directing, cinematography, aesthetics, and James Newton Howard’s score all deserved such praise. The film has subsequently gained a strong cult following. A deconstruction of the superhero genre, it is not only regarded by many as one of Shyamalan’s best films, it is also one of the best superhero films, and often listed as one of the top 10 or 20 superhero movies of all-time. It illustrates that films of this genre were getting an increased interest to the public as we entered the first decade of the 21st Century, and it’s a thriller that provides an element of more urban realism to the superhero film genre. With the release of follow-up films (two sequels being 2016’s Split and 2019’s Glass), Unbreakable became the first installment in the Eastrail 177 trilogy.\n\n8. Chicken Run\n\nAnother DreamWorks Animation film released in 2000 that is worth mentioning was the animated adventure-musical comedy film The Road to El Dorado. Which is a rather decent movie, but it is Chicken Run that’s probably one of the most memorable turn-of-the-millennium films that was made by this particular animation studio, other than 1998’s Antz and The Prince of Egypt (of course, this was back in the days before the studio was established as a prime competitor to Pixar in feature film computer animation, which wouldn’t happen until the release of Shrek a year later). Chicken Run was significant enough that it became the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film in history, and was DreamWorks Animation’s biggest success until Shrek in 2001 doubled it. It was also Aardman Animations’ first feature-length film, and their first film co-produced with DreamWorks Animation. In a way, it’s like a spoof to 1963’s The Great Escape. It’s a comical escape drama set in 1960s England, based upon the plot of The Great Escape, as well as 1953’s Stalag 17 and 1965’s The Flight of the Phoenix, and has a chicken farm setting very much like a WWII-type POW or concentration camp. The plot of this British stop-motion animated adventure comedy film centres on a group of chickens who see a rooster named Rocky (voiced by Mel Gibson, which must have been a pretty good year for him as he also starred in other 2000 released films: The Patriot, What Women Want, and The Million Dollar Hotel) as their only hope to escape the farm when their owners prepare to turn them into chicken meat pies. Chicken Run has been noted for its depiction of feminism, revolution, and fascism. The film really points to the way that masculinity and femininity are mediated in popular film genres. My favorite humorous tagline is “This ain’t no chick flick!” This is the only movie on this list that I’ve actually seen in theaters as a kid back in the year 2000, as well as the only G-rated movie to be included on my list, and I do remember enjoying it when I first saw it. Back then, I was already familiar with the co-director of this film Nick Park, Aardman Animations, and their claymation short films that featured the characters Wallace & Gromit. I thought it was so cool that this was from the creators of the Wallace & Gromit franchise, and it was a fun cinematic experience seeing this on the big screen. Well, as far as I can remember. I will admit that I use to think stop-motion animation was creepy as a child. However, when I first saw this, the film had such a charm quality throughout that it was definitely the definition of an entertaining family film perfect for all ages, and I liked that it wasn’t dark at the same level as 1995’s Babe. It was a magical new animated film that looked and sounded like no other of its time, and still does to this day. There really hasn’t been very many stop-motion animated feature films like this before or since, and it makes sense why they don’t make them much anymore. Claymations are tedious to make. Even traditional animated films aren’t really made much either, and it’s probably all because computer animation is used more often. I do honestly wish they’d make more animated films like this now days, and Chicken Run just remains so nostalgic to me.\n\n4. Traffic\n\n2000 must have been a significant year of films exploring the issues of drugs. There was another film released that same year that actually depicts a realistic portrayal of drug addiction, and that is the Darren Aronofsky directed psychological drama Requiem for a Dream. I’ve honestly never been into films about drugs, but what I like about Traffic is that it displays the issue of drugs in a political thriller approach. It is a crime drama that explores America’s war on drugs through several interconnected stories. The illegal drug trade is looked upon in the perspectives of the traffickers, the politicians, the enforcers, and the users. All of these stories are edited together throughout the film, and some of the characters do meet each other. There’s a conservative Ohio Supreme Court judge named Robert Wakefield (played by Michael Douglas), who is appointed as the nation’s Drug Tsar, and is unaware that his own daughter, a sixteen-year-old honor roll student, is a drug addict herself. Then there’s two DEA agents (played by Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman) trying to protect an informant who’s testimony will bring down a drug lord, while the wife (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) of the jailed drug lord seeks to control her husband’s lucrative business in order to keep herself in the high life. And lastly, a Mexican cop named Javier Rodriguez (played by Benicio del Toro in his Oscar winning role for Best Supporting Actor) attempts to take a lone stand against the powerful cartels in his community. The film’s screenplay was written by Stephen Gaghan, and is an adaptation of a 1989 British Channel 4 television series titled Traffik written by Simon Moore. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, and he’s also operated the hand-held camerawork himself. The writing and directing is done so well in this film, and the two men ended up winning Oscars for their work. Stephen Gaghan won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Traffic. There was another film Soderbergh directed that came out earlier that same year, and that is the biographical drama Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts. That too was a good movie, and Soderbergh was nominated for Best Director of that film as well. It was a very rare instance in Oscar history that a director was nominated for two films in the Best Director category. However, I liked Traffic better, and would agree that he deservedly won for this film. Cool that he defeated himself. This film has such a gritty tone and authentic sense of reality. The shooting style gives a documentary feel in everything of its atmosphere, and adopts a distinctive color grade for each story so that we as viewers could tell them apart. The editing is top notch too and also won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Traffic maybe political cinema, but it doesn’t try to preach the subject matter. It only shows the situations and domino effects of the drug world could have on us all. It illustrates that the war itself causes just as much damage to our humanity as the drugs themselves, and that there are other ways to help individuals personally that doesn’t always have to involve an army of drug troops.\n\n3. American Psycho\n\nThis film had a polarizing reception from audiences and critics, but has since become a cult classic over time. It was first shown at the Sundance Film Festival before getting a theatrical release some months later. Some people mistake this as a slasher horror flick, but it’s really more of a dark comedy with some psychological thriller elements. The film was based on the 1991 novel also titled American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis, and both the film and the book were deemed controversial because of the disturbing imagery and portrayal of violence towards women. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films (such as Fight Club, In the Company of Men, American Beauty, and Boys Don’t Cry), American Psycho does seem to raise the broader widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis. But the film and book don’t glorify blatant misogyny; they present themselves as more of a periodically literal interpretation of a monster inside the id that was created by consumer culture. In fact, not everybody knows this, but this film was actually directed by a woman named Mary Harron, and has also co-written the screenplay. Harron and co-writer Guinevere Turner understood that the book was more of a period comedy of manners, and tried to present the film as it is. Set in New York City during the late 1980s, it is a satirical character study of a wealthy and handsome materialistic investment banker named Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale), who seems to be just a young urban professional and typical Wall Street yuppie, but appears to also be a psychopath, and lives a secondary life as a gruesome serial killer by night. The police soon notice Patrick’s behavior as his grisly crimes become increasingly brutal. However, the more we as viewers dive deep into his violent hedonistic fantasies, we begin to question what exactly is going on in his psychopathic ego. He does narrate the story, but turns out to be an unreliable narrator. The film leaves us with ambiguity over whether Bateman might or might not have imagined the whole thing, and could be either an ordinary crazy person, or a psychotic killer. The protagonist presents himself to be suffering from some sort of personality disorder that could be antisocial, narcissistic, and/or borderline. Although, whatever psychosis or questionable depictions of reality is not necessarily important. The film focuses more on the constant quest for success, and recognition to be a somebody. People get so caught up into things that make us fit in, but become oblivious to what is actually in front of us. It makes us wonder if all his deeds were only in his head, or could be real and that everyone else is caught up and blind. American Psycho is quite a social critique of the yuppie culture back in the 80s, but is largely a critique of the shallow and vicious aspects of capitalism. The screenplay and Bale’s performance are what makes this film an interesting look at the explorations of the themes and social commentary, and I think this was a bold move in groundbreaking early 21st Century cinema.\n\n2. Memento\n\nSome folks think this was a 2001 release. It was ranked among the top ten films of the year 2001 by the National Board of Review and American Film Institute, and was even nominated for two Oscars at the 74th Academy Awards. However, it actually first premiered at the Venice International Film Festival on September 5th, 2000 and was released in European theaters the next month later. It didn’t get its American release until March 16th, 2001. The film was known to be a sleeper hit. It gained substantial word-of-month press from the film festival circuit, and this publicity from these events helped it find foreign distributors. It opened in more than twenty countries worldwide, and was promoted at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001. It had more troublesome finding American distributors. Most studio executives did love the picture, but didn’t want to distribute it because they believed that it was too confusing, and wouldn’t attract a large audience. Newmarket Films ended up deciding to distribute it, and only released it in eleven theaters during its opening weekend. But after many weeks of its distribution, it had reached more than five-hundred theaters. Memento became a blockbuster success, and received critical acclaim. This film is without a doubt fantastic. Set in the state of California, Memento is a neo-noir psychological thriller about an insurance investigator named Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) who has a rare condition of anterograde amnesia as a result of a past trauma. He has the inability to form new memories and suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard is also in the middle of a search for the persons who attacked him, as well as raping and murdering his wife, and seeks to avenge his wife’s death by killing whoever responsible. He attempts to track them down by using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to follow information he cannot remember. The film is presented in a unique nonlinear narrative structure, and portrays the protagonist as an unreliable narrator. There are two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout the film: a series in black-and-white is shown in chronological order, while a series of color sequences is shown in reverse order. The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative, and stimulate for us as an audience the mental state of the protagonist. There have been interpretations of the film’s themes, and it’s really seen as a study of deliberate self-delusion and an unprecedented depiction of grief and loss. There are also motifs of memory, perception, grief, and self-deception throughout. What makes this film so engaging is that it features one of the most accurate depictions of anterograde amnesia in the history of motion pictures, and it helps portray the character of Leonard as a realistic exploration of the idea that our memories can deceive us, or sometimes we as people deceive ourselves by choosing to forget or manipulate our memories of the past. This is a psychological analysis of something that can not only be found in individuals who have this uncommon condition, but on anybody. Memento is a very human story, and captures the human psyche in so much depth that it becomes relatable. It is one of those types of films that will make you think, as well as want to view more than once in order to understand the narrative better, and find certain details we’ve missed during the previous viewings. It’s a thought-provoking thriller. This is a form of cinematic storytelling that I find to be a good example of 2000 being a great year of introducing new ways of telling complex narratives, as well as something for many films released after 2000 to be inspired by. The two Academy Awards it was nominated for were Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. However, it probably should have been nominated in the Adapted Screenplay category instead, because it was based on a pitch that was eventually published into a short story titled Memento Mori by Jonathan Nolan, but ended up not being so on account of the fact that his story was not published before the film was released. Memento was written for the screen and directed by Jonathan Nolan’s brother Christopher Nolan, who ultimately became known as one of the most influential filmmakers of the 21st Century. Although, Chris Nolan made his directorial debut with the 1998 release of Following, it was his second feature Memento that has gained him considerable attention. He’s definitely had plenty of success and acclaim after this film, and is one of the highest-grossing film directors in cinema history. But Memento still stands as among his greatest achievements in cinema. The film was subsequently ranked one of the best films of the 2000s, and was deemed “culturally, historically, or aesthetically” significant by the United States Library of Congress, becoming the first narrative feature released in the 21st Century to be selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 2017, primarily because of its innovative cinematic storytelling.\n\n1. Gladiator\n\n“Are you not entertained?” This was the winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture of the year 2000, and the second highest-grossing film of that year worldwide (behind Mission: Impossible 2). I have always been a huge fan of historical epics and period dramas, and Gladiator was the ultimate epic released at such perfect timing in the earliest year of the 21st Century (also known as the year 2000 A.D.). The film’s genre, specifically those set in the classical period, had traditionally been incredibly successful in the film industry from its earliest days. Prior to the release of this film, the sword-and-sandal genre had fallen out of public popularity following a string of expensive box office flops such as 1963’s Cleopatra and 1964’s The Fall of the Roman Empire. In the 1990s, the historical epic genre saw a little revival in popularity, with the success of films such as 1990’s Dances with Wolves, 1993’s Schindler’s List, 1995’s Braveheart, 1997’s Titanic, and 1998’s Saving Private Ryan. Gladiator continued these films’ realism with more of a focus on Ancient history, which had not been explored extensively since the 1960s. It became one of 2000’s biggest blockbusters due to strong word-of-mouth, contributing to its long-lasting box office performance, and DreamWorks’ improving fortunes. The plot was influenced by Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre; such as 1959’s Ben-Hur, 1960’s Spartacus, and 1964’s The Fall of the Roman Empire. It’s basically a Moses-type story with a poetic spiritual sense of romance, and a yearning for great men who did great deeds. Set in Ancient Rome during the time of the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 2nd Century A.D., the epic historical drama film follows a Hispano-Roman general named Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe in his Oscar winning role for Best Leading Actor, which elevated him to leading man status), who is betrayed when Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix in his Oscar nominated role for Best Supporting Actor, which turned him into a celebrity), the dysfunctional and ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), seizes the throne after killing his own father. “Am I not merciful?” Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator, and rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor. When he goes to Rome to fight in the games at the Colosseum, his subsequent popularity in the arena threatens the throne. Commodus addresses, “A general who became a slave. A slave who became a gladiator. A gladiator who defied an emperor.” And Maximus states, “Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.” It’s a great revenge story filled with impressive action, beautiful visuals, and commanding performances.\n\nThe film has been analyzed for its themes of revenge, violence as spectacle, masculinity, and stoicism. However, the film’s narrative has become more relevant decades later than it was when first released, with its themes of populism and fascism. What makes this film different from others of its genre (other than the fact that modern digital technology and CGI visual effects upped the elaborate reconstructions than what most older theatrical epics did) is that it identified the ancient gladiatorial games as like modern entertainment games, and examines the idea that while weapons and fashion might have been different then, it’s politics and people’s behavior that have never really fundamentally changed. Looking into the research of the Roman arena, there’s a realization that it was completely the epicenter of the whole society, and feels very familiar and contemporary. The concept of an entire population being distracted by entertainment while missing the more serious issues does feel very much like now. Aside from this notion, the film certainly has heart, and is like a modern morality play. It is an emotionally character driven hero’s journey drama that’s set in an amphitheater, with a story about a strong loving man trying to find his way home, and his inner strength in a tough time. It’s a mythical story that can be relevant to anybody, especially to an audience struggling with their own days, ethics, and principles. Directed by Ridley Scott, it is quite a cinematic experience that delves deep into the complexity of characterization, and has brilliant combat sequences and spectacular Oscar winning costume design. The production design and cinematography (as well as the Oscar winning visual effects and sound mixing) are also stunning, and provide a sense of atmosphere and grittiness that makes us audiences believe we are in this particular historical time period on the big screen. The grander scale and sweeping scope is what we would anticipate from this visionary director, who sure has an eye for how to create worlds, whether it’s a historical epic, or a science fiction movie (e.g. 1982’s Blade Runner). The musical score by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is so breathtaking too, and should have won the Oscar for Best Original Score in my personal opinion.\n\nSince its release, Gladiator has been critically re-evaluated, and became a pop cultural phenomenon. It has been credited with reinventing the sword-and-sandal genre, after it waned in the public eye during the 1960s, as well as for rekindling interest in entertainment centered around ancient Greek, Rome, and other time periods throughout world history. Several films have attempted to emulate the film’s visuals, style, and tone with varying degrees of success. Dubbed the “Gladiator Effect”, the film’s mainstream success spurred a revival of the historical epic genre with films such as (to name a few) Edward Zwick’s The Last Samurai, Wolfgang Petersen’s Troy, John Lee Hancock’s The Alamo, Antoine Fuqua’s King Arthur, Oliver Stone’s Alexander, Zack Snyder’s 300, and Robert Eggers’ The Northman. Even Ridley Scott himself has tried to imitate his own success by later directing other epics such as Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Last Duel, and Napoleon. Plus, the aesthetics in the film have influenced several fantasy and superhero film genres; such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the DC Extended Universe. The gladiator arena set piece from Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones, which entered production shortly after the release of Gladiator, has been compared to the arena setting in the film. The film’s effect on culture also went beyond cinema; with the television show Rome, the miniseries Julius Caesar (also including Richard Harris, in one of his last acting roles), and the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones citing Gladiator as their impact. “Strength and honor.” Today, it remains a classic of its genre; considered to be one of the greatest historical epic films ever made, among the greatest action films of all-time, and one of the best films of both the 2000s decade and the 21st Century. “What we do in life, echoes in eternity.”\n\nTHE END"
