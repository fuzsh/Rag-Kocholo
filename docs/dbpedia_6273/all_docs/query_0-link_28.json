        "text": "As a millennial, I’ve seen many sides to television even within the thirty-odd years of my life. I recall hearing that it was a junk medium as a child, and that it wasn’t a serious art form (remember when cinema was considered as such?); it would rot our minds if we watched too much. I grew up in a television-loving household and we would have nightly events set to each day of the week (additionally, Saturday morning cartoons would be my alone time that I would also enjoy). Was I ever lucky that the Golden Age of Television of the Twenty First Century would start when I was around ten years old and was starting to get old enough to enjoy what was to come (okay, maybe I wasn’t HBO ready yet, but that would come eventually). We’re two decades (plus) into this era, and television only keeps on evolving and staying masterful. If anything, it may be the most beloved form of entertainment we have today, especially because we’re still in the middle of its best years.\n\nEven though a new masterpiece can pop up at any time (given the amount of contemporary shows that made this list, including those that are still on and/or were wrapping up whilst I was compiling this list), these selections can be old news sooner than I think. Nonetheless, I wanted to narrow down the best series I have ever seen to just one hundred selections. This doesn’t include game shows, talk shows, news and sports analyses, sketch shows, and other forms of live entertainment unrelated to narrative television (you can find fifty of my favourite shows of these natures here), and limited series are excluded from this list as well (those will pop up on a future list next month). These one hundred shows are narrative based, and both serialized and episodic series are considered. Dramas and comedies (sitcoms or not) are included as well.\n\nWhich series were the best made? If a show is long running, was its prime noteworthy enough to excuse its worse years? The consistency of a show is important to me, and something that began extremely well and dropped off enough would nullify a show for contention on this list (sorry Homeland, Dexter, and all of the other shows that had such promise). For the shows that ended or started poorly that did make this list, I tried to weigh them reasonably (do the bad seasons actually hurt the series as a whole? Does a series make its worse moments worthwhile in the long run?). A lot of time and research (countless hours, nay, months of research) went into the making of this list, and many series I adore didn’t end up making the final cut (a quick shoutout to Orphan Black and Moral Orel: the final two shows to be cut). Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy the list as much as I did working on it. Here are the one hundred best narrative television shows of all time.\n\n15. Lost\n\nWe all knew that there wasn't a show like Lost on television when it was first out. We were all united initially by the interest of the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 and this mysterious island they were stranded on, but then the mysterious, metaphysical events began (rather quickly, honestly). It was the new Twin Peaks: we collectively had to guess what was even happening. It got so deep into its own lore that forums, clubs, and so much more were spawned; the final season even had reminders of previous seasons run at the bottom of the screen as episodes aired. Over ten years afterwards, we still haven't seen anything create quite a zeitgeist as Lost, and I think that it’s much easier to appreciate its bigger picture as a whole now. When you aren’t being bamboozled on a weekly basis and can binge watch it, Lost is a powerful depiction of fates and purposes (even with its occasional flaws, it is undeniably an opus of television).\n\n12. The Prisoner\n\nTelevision will rarely be this artistic and experimental ever again. I can safely say this because The Prisoner came out in 1968, and we haven’t seen much like it since. I feel comfortable declaring this since only one season was ever made and The Prisoner was hastily left alone afterward. Patrick McGoohan wasted no time dismantling the confinements of television with this abstract depiction of an individual trapped within society like the titular lifer (we can't forget he is designated Number Six). Any attempts to leave this village are thwarted by ridiculous circumstances, and we are back to square one (hell, there is no set format to watching these episodes for the most part, as any order will give you the same result). So much was said during The Prisoner about television, the systemic ways of civilization, and then some, and it was told through fascinatingly avant-garde means that would never be allowed on network television again.\n\n8. The Sopranos\n\nIt may be difficult to pinpoint when exactly the New Golden Age of Television is going to end, but we can crown The Sopranos as the likely start of it all. Even with other shows that came before it (like Oz), The Sopranos was capable of showing us what TV in the twenty first century was going to look like. The limitless approach to swearing and violence may have been an immediate draw for the curious, but it's the nuanced storytelling — the finest you’d find at this time — that kept many staying. Furthermore, David Chase’s unveiling of the day-to-day lives of mobsters, particularly the vulnerable side of one Tony Soprano, showed that you could approach tired genres with fresh new eyes; this long form medium allows you to dive deeper into a psyche and character arc unlike any other visual method before. While I feel like some of the shows influenced by The Sopranos have surpassed it now, it was still one of the firsts of its kind, and an early sterling example of where we would go with television.\n\n3. Twin Peaks\n\nThere haven’t been many shows that have experienced an evolution via reception like Twin Peaks. The first two seasons were unlike anything on television (cinematic, abstract, and highly unusual). Once it ended abruptly, it became a cult classic years afterward. Things would turn around, and David Lynch and Mark Frost’s metaphysical crime drama would be heralded as a classic of all time; Lynch and Frost released the eventual third season at just the right time. It was at this moment that they proved that they could go even further with this distorted vision. Without The Return, Twin Peaks is a legendary show for what it was able to achieve (and for its singular experience). With the added season, it became a nearly untouchable program that was impossible to predict, pinpoint, or fully understand, and it was a sign that Lynch and Frost could challenge and break the rules of television whenever they damn well felt like it.\n\n2. Breaking Bad\n\nVince Gilligan’s suburban tragedy series Breaking Bad felt like the hip show to watch at one time early on: here’s a dying chemistry teacher that turns to the creation and selling of meth in order to leave a fortune for his family. It fell right in place with the edgier shows at the start of the decade. It would blossom into a series that only got better and better, with the devolution of the monumental antihero Walter White. Gilligan’s commentary on the exploitations of society and the extents that the everyday citizen has to go through just to live a regular life were eye opening. His twisted visions of these characters that felt like they could live right beside us were as intriguing as they were unsettling. The whole series leads up to the third last episode “Ozymandias”, and it’s at this point (and the two brilliant episodes to follow) that it’s impossible to ignore that Breaking Bad was a benchmark of how television shows can develop over time; it remains a nearly unstoppable series.\n\nGiven that David Simon’s writing served as the foundation of Homicide: Life on the Street, and his works would influence television much later, it only seemed like he was destined to be a part of the medium. He would end up creating The Wire: another depiction of the lives of crime within Baltimore. The series was ahead of its time, as it didn’t pick up the instant traction of works like The Sopranos when released. The show didn’t prioritize instant gratification of happy endings, twists to have you tuned in to the next episode, or other gimmicks. If anything, there was something else going on here. Television shows were heavily inspired by live stage productions, films, and other influences over time. Simon took a different approach, which makes sense considering he is a writer: he crafted a small screen version of the novel.\n\nEach season depicted a different part of Baltimore’s underworld, ranging from drug slinging and the importing of contraband to the corruption within politics and the media. Each season had its own feel, like we broke open a new book with many familiar faces (and some new ones), but what really made The Wire special is that we didn’t just abandon previous storylines. No. Those would continue, and the narrative infrastructure would just keep growing. The Wire was always five moves ahead of us (an analogy I have to make, given the show’s affinity for the game of chess), and it was exciting to see characters (all walks of life) trying to outsmart one another (as much as it was for ourselves to be taken for rides as well).\n\nNever has a show before or since been this in depth, this literary, or this multifaceted. That’s all well and good enough to make The Wire worthy of discussion when it comes to the topic of the greatest show of all time, but it earns this spot with the other elements that make it a complete package. It has memorable characters that you hate to love or love to hate (and then there’s Omar Little: one of the finest characters in television; rest in peace, Michael K. Williams). It is impeccably shot (not too aesthetically to detract from the crimes you’re witnessing, but beautifully enough that you’ll notice if you pay attention). Its search for the bad in the good and the good in the bad never went unfulfilled. It felt extremely real, but it also was clearly peak television: it is gripping upon your first viewing, and forever rewarding with new realizations on each subsequent rewatch. It’s a harrowing and captivating watch, and a series that keeps on giving. Even though television keeps evolving and we still find masterpieces being released nowadays, it may be impossible to trump the scale of The Wire’s ambition and brilliance. It’s safe to say that, in my opinion (and all things considered), The Wire is the greatest series of all time."
