        "text": "29. Shrek the Third (2007)\n\nWhat didn't work: Threequels are tricky. Shrek is nearly universally beloved, but follow-up installments didn't capture the magic of the ogre, the princess, and the donkey nearly as well as the original. While it seemed pretty much every fairy tale character made an appearance in this bloated installment — Captain Hook, Merlin, and Rapunzel all drop by — the laughs are few and far between and the plot left much to be desired. — Erin Strecker\n\n28. The Road to El Dorado (2000)\n\nWhat didn't work: The Road to El Dorado stars the voice talents of Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline at their most exaggerated playing con men turned New World adventurers. The adventure-comedy has received a new life as Internet memes, but there's a reason only a few moments have been immortalized as GIFs — the rest of the movie is nothing special. —Maricela Gonzalez\n\n27. Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003)\n\nWhat didn't work: Maybe it was an accident of timing: Sinbad couldn't help looking dinky next to Pixar's dazzling Finding Nemo, which was released the very same summer. Then again, the movie may have nothing to blame for its poor performance but itself; a rote story, blatant whitewashing, CGI uneasily merged with traditional animation, and a miscast Brad Pitt in the title role all helped sink this legendary sailor. —Hillary Busis\n\n26. Monsters vs. Aliens (2009)\n\nWhat didn't work: While not nearly as terrible as the similarly titled Cowboys vs. Aliens, Monsters vs. Aliens doesn't showcase the same balance of kiddie and adult humor that other DreamWorks animated movies do so well. Instead this riff on '50s and '60s-style B movies plays it safe, making it serviceable for kids but bland for whole families to enjoy. —Maricela Gonzalez\n\n25. Puss in Boots (2011)\n\nWhat didn't work: This Shrek spin-off has big boots to fill in order to capture the same comedic gold as in Shrek and Shrek 2. While it shares the same vivid look as its predecessors, Puss in Boots is not nearly as funny as it could be, even with the Zach Galfianakis-voiced Humpty Dumpty. What's more, the convoluted storyline, although peppered with Shrek-like humorous moments, falls flat. —Maricela Gonzalez\n\n24. Bee Movie (2007)\n\nWhat didn't work: Jerry Seinfeld's Bee Movie starts off buzzing as Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld) abandons the traditional path to honey-making to begin a movement to sue the human race after learning that they steal and consume bees? honey, a product of their hard work and team effort. But as the story continues, the animation becomes overly busy from the insect perspective, with trippy coloring, zigzagging, and headache-inducing camera angles. The stab at a masked-sociopolitical agenda beneath the facade of animation create a dialogue that, for what DreamWorks identifies as a family-friendly film, enters the territory of adult-only comprehension comedy. —Jacqueline Andriakos\n\n23. The Croods (2013)\n\nWhat didn't work: After an earthquake destroys the prehistoric family's cave, the Croods set off on a comedic adventure in search of a new home, braving the wilderness outside their comfort zones for the first time. A spunky little nomad named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) helps Grug, Eep, Gran, Thunk, and Ugga evolve past living in constant fear of the unknown. Despite the positive family message, much of the film feels like The Flintstones was dusted off and popped into the VCR, with Nicholas Cage tossed into the archaic mix. The animations place these Paleolithic, caveman personalities into a confusingly futuristic-looking atmosphere. For a 2013 animated film, The Croods regresses to an Ice Age-recycled storyline with weaker humor. —Jacqueline Andriakos\n\n22. Shark Tale (2004)\n\nWhat didn't work: Coming out a year after the far superior Finding Nemo, the problem with Shark Tale is not that it's a bad film. Shark Tale is actually pretty enjoyable... for an adult. Pushing jokes about Oscar (Will Smith), a fish who owes some money to ''loan sharks'' — who are actual sharks — and referencing The Godfather won't necessarily reel in the kids. But parents could appreciate the casting of Robert De Niro, Michael Imperioli, and Martin Scorsese. —Sheridan Watson\n\n21. Rise of the Guardians (2012)\n\nWhat didn't work: Well, starting off with a bit of a branding issue didn't bode well for Rise of the Guardians — not to be confused with 2010's Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole or 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy. And the idea of fairy-tale icons turned action heroes with a relatively vague mission just wasn't enough to spark the imagination. Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the like might have been better not tarnishing our memories of them. —Abby West\n\n20. Shrek Forever After (2010)\n\nWhat didn't work: In the fourth installment of the series, the references come fast and furious but the humor and engagement for children are less so. Even the involvement of contemporary pop culture stars (Mad Men's Jon Hamm, Glee's Jane Lynch, and Craig Robinson from The Office) couldn't give this one the missing spark. —Abby West\n\n19. Shrek 2 (2004)\n\nWhy it worked: It didn't reach the heights of the original, but overall Shrek 2 was a fun, family-friendly sequel that allowed fans to reconnect with the humor of the fairy-tale-out-of-water characters. Shrek 2 is really made by the introduction of Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas), a crime-fighting cat that quickly became as beloved as Shrek and Donkey, even getting his own 2011 spin-off film. —Erin Strecker\n\n18. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008)\n\nWhy it worked: It didn't revolutionize the setup — Alex the lion and his friends are still trying to make their way back to NYC — but it also retained the humor and lovable nature of the characters found in the original. —Abby West\n\n17. Turbo (2013)\n\nWhy it worked: The snail-out-of-garden story featured top-notch voice talent (Ryan Reynolds as the titular hero, plus an enviable ensemble comprised of Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph, and Samuel L. Jackson, to name a few). Though a bit sluggish in its plotting, it featured exciting action sequences that maximized the 3-D experience. —Lanford Beard\n\n16. Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014)\n\nWhy it worked: While time has made it more difficult to sustain the novelty of the '60s original (the Peabody's Improbable History segments of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show), Mr. Peabody's ironic swagger has never gone out of style, and Ty Burrell as the eponymous pooch genius got ''the character's speedy, super-logical rhythms without quite nailing his dry delight'' according to EW. —Lanford Beard\n\n15. Flushed Away (2006)\n\nWhy it worked: The madcap tale of a pet mouse named Roddy (Hugh Jackman), who enters the seamy underworld when he's flushed down the toilet, has a style and pacing that keeps young and old viewers alike plugged in. —Abby West\n\n14. Over the Hedge (2006)\n\nWhy it worked: Based on the eponymous comic strip starring a community of forest animals, Over the Hedge works as entertainment for children who like cuddly animals and as a satirical take on our consumer culture. The characterizations of the forest-dwelling creatures catapults the film over mediocre family features, particularly with such standout voice performances like Steve Carell's overactive Hammy the squirrel and Omid Djalili's diva of a Persian cat, Tiger. —Maricela Gonzalez\n\n13. Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)\n\nWhy it worked: I could leave it to one phrase: Afro-circus. But there was more to the third installment of the franchise than the sublimely catchy ads. The key thing as Alex and the gang took their trek to Europe was that the comedic timing remained pitch perfect, thanks to folks like Chris Rock and Ben Stiller. —Abby West\n\n12. Megamind (2010)\n\nWhy it worked: 2010's Despicable Me got all the buzz (and the box office), but this second supervillain story was the more ambitious of the two. True, its plot — evil overlord suffers existential crisis after finally defeating his lifelong nemesis — doesn't exactly scream ''kid-friendly.'' But it's nice to see big ideas explored in animated fare, especially when they're brought to life by an ace vocal cast including Will Ferrell and Tina Fey. —Hillary Busis\n\n11. Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)\n\nWhy it worked: Jack Black's sweet but fierce Po returned and continued his own personal growth while dispatching a new villain. His remains a victory the whole family can get behind. —Abby West\n\n10. Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002)\n\nWhy it worked: Wisecracking woodland creatures and knowing pop culture references are all well and good — but sometimes, a simple, traditionally animated story can be just what the cineplex ordered. Enter Spirit, a beautiful western starring a character who doesn't even speak (except via voiceovers delivered by Matt Damon). It's a new classic that's old-fashioned in all the right ways. —Hillary Busis\n\n9. The Prince of Egypt (1998)\n\nWhy it worked: It's easy to see why faith-based audiences would laud this biblical epic, which transforms the Book of Exodus into a sweeping animated musical. But Prince is built to satisfy regardless of a viewer's religion, thanks to its star-studded voice cast (Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock...er, Val Kilmer), its surprisingly deep story (Moses isn't just a hero, but a conflicted man forced to turn against the only family he's ever known; Rameses isn't just a villain, but an insecure leader who yearns for his father's approval), and, most, of all its soaring score — especially the Academy Award-winning song ''When You Believe.'' —Hillary Busis\n\n8. Antz (1998)\n\nWhy it worked: The first animated film by DreamWorks, Antz sure set the bar high for films to come. Z, a worker ant played to perfection by Woody Allen, rises from the lower class to try and save his beloved colony from the clutches of the evil General Mandible (Gene Hackman) and be with the ant he loves (Sharon Stone). Some of the subject matter could be a little eye-raising for young children, but it's got the essentials: it's smart, — it's basically a flick about the dangers of communism — funny, and heartwarming. Antz is what happens when you put plot and character development above gross-out laughter. —Sheridan Watson\n\n7. Madagascar (2005)\n\nWhy it worked: The first adventure of Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), the star attraction at the Central Park Zoo, Marty the neurotic zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the saucy Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) was spot on in establishing chaotic fun with characters we'd come to know and love. And the crazy lemurs on the island, led by Sacha Baron Cohen's delusional King Julien, may have thrown the former zoo animals for a loop but only further endeared the movie to us. —Abby West\n\n6. How To Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)\n\nWhy it worked: Last we saw Hiccup, the dragon-loving viking, he'd lost a leg in battle but gained everything he could've hoped for: community and paternal respect, the pretty girl, and a kick-ass pet dragon, Toothless. So when the sequel picks up five years later, he's practically a new Hiccup — cooler and more confident — faced with a new challenge that includes a real old-school villain. But Hiccup is still clever and kind, and the film remains the rare animated adventure with a sense of danger and real consequences. It's a cartoon about dragons that's never ''cartoon-y,'' and it's built to last. —Jeff Labrecque\n\n5. Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n\nWhy it worked: An all-star voice cast featuring Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, and Dustin Hoffman coupled with an emotionally resonant story about believing in yourself that appealed to both children and adults, and it's no wonder this film grossed over $215 million at the domestic box office — not to mention spawned both a feature film sequel (with another in the works) and a television series. —Erin Strecker\n\n4. How to Train Your Dragon (2010)\n\nWhy it worked: We saw ourselves in Hiccup, a scrawny Viking with a heart of gold, desperate to please his warlord father. We cracked up over the jokes thrown around by top-notch voice talent Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. But most important, we fell for the sweetest dragon there ever was: Toothless. With incredible performances, jaw-dropping animation (3-D done right!) and a beautiful score, no wonder How to Train Your Dragon flew right into everyone's hearts. —Sheridan Watson\n\n3. Chicken Run (2000)\n\nWhy it worked: Moviegoers looking for something different were instantly drawn to this stop-motion film about a group of chickens who must come up with a way to fly the coop when their owners decide to go from selling eggs to selling chicken pies. The highly original, laugh-out-loud fable was a smart and sharp feast for the eyes. —Erin Strecker\n\n2. Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)\n\nWhy it worked: The world's ''first vegetarian horror film'' is also one of its most charming stop-motion films, period. Everything is exactly on point, from the inventive story to the script's clever wordplay (a pest-control business called ''Anti-Pesto''; trying to stop the titular beast with ''24-carrot'' bullets) to Gromit's perfectly expressive (yet utterly mouthless) face. Even an uptight Brit couldn't keep a stiff upper lip while watching this gem. —Hillary Busis\n\n1. Shrek (2001)\n\nWhy it worked: Before the brand was diluted by a series of increasingly worse sequels — and before the animated film landscape got clogged with self-referential clones — there was the original Shrek, a girl-meets-ogre tale that created its own rich, compelling fantasy universe even as it mercilessly (and hilariously) mocked the fairy tale-based hits that producer Jeffrey Katzenberg once shepherded as chairman of Disney. There's a reason this movie beat out Monsters Inc. to win the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature: It's just that good. —Hillary Busis"
