        "text": "Hokey smokes! Everyone's favorite moose and squirrel are flying back onto the small screen to introduce their antics to a new generation in Amazon's The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle remake. The Amazon Prime Video series, created by DreamWorks Animation Television, will feature the same characters you know and love from the 1959 - 1964 series, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends: Rocky the Flying Squirrel, Bullwinkle J. Moose, Natasha Fatale, Boris Badenov, and Fearless Leader.\n\n\"The world-famous talking moose and flying squirrel are back in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, a serialized comedy about two goofball best friends who routinely find themselves thrust into harrowing situations but end up saving the day time and again,\" reads the description of the remake. \"As Rocky and Bullwinkle's innocent and silly ambitions to become rock stars or find lost treasure end up dovetailing with Fearless Leader's sinister plans to take over the world, our heroes are set on a collision course with his notorious super spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.\"\n\nSounds like not much has changed, except for that now you can grab your kids to watch the new episodes together! The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle will begin streaming on Amazon devices for Prime subscribers on May 11. Check out the trailer above and a few preview clips below!"
