        "text": "American actor (1920–1986)\n\nSolomon Hersh Frees (June 22, 1920 – November 2, 1986), better known as Paul Frees, was an American actor, comedian, impressionist, and vaudevillian. He is known for his work on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Walter Lantz, Rankin/Bass and Walt Disney theatrical cartoons during the Golden Age of Animation, and for providing the voice of Boris Badenov in The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.[1] Frees was known as \"The Man of a Thousand Voices\", though the appellation was more commonly bestowed on Mel Blanc.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nSolomon Hersh Frees was born to a Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, on June 22, 1920. He grew up in the Albany Park neighborhood and attended Von Steuben Junior High School.[3][4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 1930s, Frees first appeared in vaudeville as an impressionist, under the name Buddy Green. He began his career on radio in 1942 and remained active for more than 40 years.[5] During that time, he was involved in more than 250 films, cartoons, and TV appearances; as was the case for many voice actors of the time, his appearances were often uncredited.[5]\n\nFrees's early radio career was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Army during World War II, where he fought at Normandy, France, on D-Day.[6] He was wounded in action and was returned to the United States for a year of recuperation. He attended the Chouinard Art Institute under the G.I. Bill. When his first wife's health failed, he decided to drop out and return to radio work.[7]\n\nHe appeared frequently on Hollywood radio series, including Escape, playing lead roles and alternating with William Conrad as the opening announcer. He announced the dramatic signature on Suspense in the late 1940s, and parts on Gunsmoke (filling in for Howard McNear as Doc Adams in the episode \"The Cast\"), and Crime Classics. One of his few starring roles in this medium was as Jethro Dumont/Green Lama in the 1949 series The Green Lama, as well as a syndicated anthology series The Player, in which Frees narrated and played all the parts.\n\nIn movies, he often did dubbing for live-action films. Examples include Midway, dubbing Toshiro Mifune's performances as Admiral Yamamoto;[8][self-published source?] and Some Like It Hot, in which Frees provides the voice of funeral director Mozzarella as well as much of the falsetto voice for Tony Curtis' female character Josephine.[citation needed] Frees dubbed the entire role of Eddie in the Disney film The Ugly Dachshund, replacing actor Dick Wessel, who had died of a sudden heart attack after completion of principal photography.[citation needed] Frees also dubbed some of Humphrey Bogart’s lines in his final film The Harder They Fall.[9][citation needed] Bogart was suffering at the time from what was later diagnosed as esophageal cancer, thus could barely be heard in some takes, hence the need for Frees to dub in his voice. [9][citation needed]\n\nUnlike many voice actors who did most of their work for one studio, Frees worked extensively with at least nine of the major animation production companies of the 20th century: Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros. Cartoons, Walter Lantz Productions, UPA, Hanna-Barbera Productions, Filmation, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, Jay Ward Productions, Rankin/Bass, and Ruby-Spears.\n\nDisney\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of Frees' most memorable voices were for various Disney projects. Frees voiced Disney's Professor Ludwig Von Drake in 18 episodes of the Disney anthology television series,[10] beginning with the first episode of the newly renamed Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color on September 24, 1961. The character also appeared on many Disneyland Records. Von Drake's introductory cartoon, An Adventure in Color, featured \"The Spectrum Song\", sung by Frees as Von Drake. A different Frees recording of this song appeared on a children's record, and was later reissued on CD.[11]\n\nIn addition to voicing characters, Frees narrated a number of Disney cartoons, including the Disney educational short film Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land. This short originally aired in the same television episode as Von Drake's first appearance.\n\nFrees also provided voices for numerous characters at Disney parks. He voiced the unseen \"Ghost Host\" at Haunted Mansion Attraction at Disneyland and Walt Disney World. For the Pirates of the Caribbean, Frees recorded the ghost voice saying the iconic \"dead men tell no tales\" used in the ride, as well as lending his voice to several audio-animatronic characters, including the Auctioneer, Magistrate Carlos, and the \"Pooped Pirate\" in the ride.[12] Disney eventually issued limited edition compact discs commemorating The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, featuring some outtakes and unused audio tracks by Frees and others. Frees also provided narration for the Tomorrowland attraction Adventure Thru Inner Space (1967–1985, later replaced by Star Tours) and the original Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. Audio clips from the attractions in Frees's distinctive voice have been included in fireworks shows at Disneyland.\n\nAn animated singing bust in Frees's likeness appeared in the 2003 film The Haunted Mansion as a tribute. Similarly, audio recordings of Frees from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction can be heard in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in an homage to the ride.\n\nFrees also had a small on-camera role for Disney in the 1959 film The Shaggy Dog, playing Dr. Galvin, a police psychiatrist who attempts to understand why Mr. Daniels believes a shaggy dog can uncover a spy ring. He also spoke the film's opening narration.\n\nHis other Disney credits, most of them narration for segments of the Disney anthology television series, include:\n\nThe \"Man in Space\" series of shows (TV, 1954)\n\nFrom Aesop to Hans Christian Andersen (TV, 1955)\n\nMars and Beyond (film, 1957)\n\nThe Nine Lives of Elfego Baca (TV miniseries, 1958)\n\nTales of Texas John Slaughter (TV miniseries, 1958)\n\nThe Absent-Minded Professor (film, 1961)\n\nMoochie of Pop Warner Football (TV, 1960)\n\nThe Monkey's Uncle (film, 1965)\n\nFor his contributions to the Disney legacy, Frees was honored posthumously as a Disney Legend on October 9, 2006.[13]\n\nJay Ward Productions\n\n[edit]\n\nFrees was a regular presence in Jay Ward cartoons, providing the voices of Boris Badenov (from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show), Inspector Fenwick (from Dudley Do-Right, impersonating Eric Blore), Ape (impersonating Ronald Colman), District Commissioner Alistair and Weevil Plumtree in George of the Jungle, Baron Otto Matic in Tom Slick, Fred in Super Chicken, and the Hoppity Hooper narrator, among numerous others.\n\nRankin/Bass\n\n[edit]\n\nFrees is well-remembered for providing the voices for many characters in Rankin/Bass cartoons and stop-motion animated TV specials, most notably for a number of holiday-themed specials. In 1968, he appeared as Captain Jones in the Thanksgiving special The Mouse on the Mayflower, and that Christmas he appeared as the father of the Drummer Boy, Ali, and as the three Wise Men in The Little Drummer Boy. He was also Hocus Pocus, the traffic cop, the ticket-taker, and Santa Claus in Frosty the Snowman in 1969 and played the central villain, Burgermeister Meisterburger, and his assistant Grimsley in Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town in 1970. He provided several voices, including Aeon the Terrible, for Rudolph's Shiny New Year in 1976.\n\nFrees also voiced King Haggard's wizard Mabruk and the Cat in The Last Unicorn and provided several voices for the Jackson Five cartoon series between 1971 and 1973. He provided the voices for several J. R. R. Tolkien characters (most notably the dwarf Bombur) in Rankin/Bass animated versions of The Hobbit and The Return of the King.\n\nRankin/Bass TV specials or films featuring Paul Frees:\n\nCricket on the Hearth (TV special) (1967) Voice of the Sea Captain and others\n\nThe Mouse on the Mayflower (1968) Voice of Captain Jones\n\nThe Little Drummer Boy (1968) Voices of Ali, Aaron's Father, Three Wise Men\n\nFrosty the Snowman (1969) Voices of Hocus Pocus, Traffic Cop, Ticket Taker, Santa Claus\n\nThe Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians (1970) Voices of Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, and W.C Fields (uncredited)\n\nSanta Claus Is Comin' to Town (1970) Voices of Burgermeister Meisterburger, Grimsley, Topper, Kringle brothers, Sombertown Civilian, Burgermeister's soldiers, Physician\n\nHere Comes Peter Cottontail (1971) Voices of Colonel Bunny's assistant, Fireman, Man at Thanksgiving Table, Santa Claus\n\nThe First Easter Rabbit (1976) Voices of Santa, Zero, and Spats\n\nFrosty's Winter Wonderland (1976) Voices of Jack Frost and Traffic Cop\n\nRudolph's Shiny New Year (1976) Voices of Santa Claus, General Ticker, Aeon the Terrible, Humpty Dumpty, 1776 (aka Sev)\n\nThe Hobbit (1977) Voices of Bombur and Troll #1\n\nNestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey (1977) Voices of Santa Claus, Olaf and Donkey Dealer\n\nRudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979) Voices of Jack Frost, Policeman, Winterbolt\n\nJack Frost (1979) Voices of Father Winter, Kubla Kraus\n\nThe Return of the King (1980) Voices of Orc, Uruk-hai, Elrond (replacing the deceased Cyril Ritchard who voiced Elrond in The Hobbit)\n\nThe Last Unicorn (1982) Voices of Mabruk and the Cat\n\nThe Flight of Dragons (1982) Voice of Antiquity\n\nThe Legend of Frosty the Snowman (2005) Voice of Hocus Pocus (Archive Recordings)\n\nGeorge Pal\n\n[edit]\n\nFrees portrayed the Orson Welles sound-alike radio reporter in George Pal's film The War of the Worlds (1953), where he is seen dictating into a tape recorder as the military prepares the atomic bomb for use against the invading Martians. Memorably, his character says the recording is being made \"for future history ... if any\". Frees also provided the film's dramatic opening narration, prior to Sir Cedric Hardwicke's voice-over tour of the solar system.\n\nFrees subsequently provided the apocalyptic voice for the \"talking rings\" in Pal's later film The Time Machine (1960), in which he explains the ultimate fate of humanity from which the time traveler realizes the origin of the Morlocks and Eloi.\n\nProducer Pal later put Frees to work again in his fantasy film Atlantis, the Lost Continent (also 1960) and doing the opening voice-over narration for Pal's Doc Savage (1975) film.\n\nFrees did the narration for the George Pal documentary The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal (1985), written, produced, and directed by Arnold Leibovit. Two years later, Frees provided the voice for Arnie the Dinosaur and the Pillsbury Doughboy in The Puppetoon Movie (1987), also produced and directed by Leibovit.\n\nOther voice work\n\n[edit]\n\nThe versatile actor voiced several characters, including three of the main characters in the US versions of Belvision's Hergé's Adventures of Tintin cartoons, based on the books by Hergé.\n\nHe had also done work for Hanna-Barbera in their Tom and Jerry shorts at MGM. In the 1956 Cinemascope Tom and Jerry cartoon, Blue Cat Blues, he was Jerry's voice who narrated the short; he voiced Jerry's cousin Muscles in Jerry's Cousin five years earlier and the cannibals in His Mouse Friday where he said the lines \"Mmmmm, barbecued cat!\" and \"Mmmmm, barbecued mouse!\"\n\nAt the MGM Animation studio, he also did multiple voice roles for Tex Avery's short films, notably playing every role in Cellbound in 1955.\n\nFrees worked with Spike Jones on his 1960 album Omnibust, heard as announcer \"Billy Playtex\" and several other characters on \"The Late Late Late Late Movies, Part I and II\".\n\nFrom October 1961 through September 1962, Paul Frees provided the voice for the shady lawyer named Judge Oliver Wendell Clutch, a weasel on the animated program Calvin and the Colonel starring the voices of Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll. The series was an animated television remake of their radio series Amos 'n Andy.\n\nFor the 1962 Christmas special Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol, produced by UPA, Paul Frees voiced several characters, including Fezziwig, the Charity Man, and two of the opportunists who steal from the dead Scrooge (Eyepatch Man and Tall Tophat Man)[14] and Mister Magoo's Broadway theatre director. He subsequently provided numerous voices for the follow up series The Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo.\n\nFrees provided the voices of both John Lennon and George Harrison in the 1965 The Beatles cartoon series, the narrator, Big D and Fluid Man in the 1966 cartoon series, Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles, and The Thing in the 1967 series Fantastic Four, as well as President James Norcross in the 1967 cartoon series Super President. He played several roles – narrator, Chef of State, the judges and the bailiff – in the George Lucas / John Korty animated film, Twice Upon a Time.\n\nFrees provided the voice-over for the trailer to the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller, Play Misty for Me.\n\nIn television commercials, he was the voice of the Pillsbury Doughboy, the 7-Up bird Fresh-Up Freddie, Froot Loops spokesbird Toucan Sam (previously voiced by Mel Blanc, later voiced by Maurice LaMarche), Boo-Berry in the series of monster cereal commercials, and The Farmer who helps The Little Green Sprout, (voiced by Ike Eisenmann), who called out to the Jolly Green Giant, \"So what's new besides ho-ho-ho, Green Giant?\" He also played a British detective in a 1971 non-animated television commercial for Taster's Choice coffee.[15][16][17][18]\n\nFrees narrated many live action films and television series, including Naked City (1958–1963). Frees also provided the voice of the eccentric billionaire John Beresford Tipton, always seated in his chair with his back to the viewer while talking to his employee Michael Anthony (fellow voice-artist Marvin Miller), on the dramatic series The Millionaire.\n\nHe was the narrator at the beginning of the film The Disorderly Orderly starring Jerry Lewis. He also looped an actor's voice in the film The Ladies Man, also starring Jerry Lewis.\n\nIn 1980, Frees was hired by Program Director Hy Lit to be the voice of radio station WKXW (Kicks 101 1/2).\n\nFrees had a wide range of other roles, usually heard but not seen, and frequently without screen credit. The resonance of his natural voice was similar to that of Orson Welles, and he performed a Welles impression several times. Some highlights of his voice work:\n\nNarrator for The Manchurian Candidate\n\nNarrated 16 episodes of the NBC military television series Steve Canyon, starring Dean Fredericks (1958–1959), and appeared on-screen as an RAF officer attached to a USAF command in the pilot episode, \"Operation Towline.\"\n\nNarrated the documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer, The Day After Trinity (1980)\n\nThe Peter Lorre voice in the 1947 Spike Jones RCA Victor recording of the song \"My Old Flame\". When talking softly, the voice sounds much like Lorre.[19] When the character segués into a manic rant for a few lines, the voice anticipates the Ludwig Von Drake characterization. Frees appeared on several other Spike Jones recordings including \"Pop Corn Sack\" also from 1947 in which he provided the voices of Charles Boyer, Edward G. Robinson, Katharine Hepburn and Al Jolson.\n\nDialog looping for French actor Jacques Roux, among other uncredited voice work, in the 1963 film The List of Adrian Messenger\n\nThe Orson Welles sound-alike narrator in Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America Vol. 1: The Early Years.

His most notable screenwriting work was the little-seen 1960 film The Beatniks, a screed against the then-rising Beat counterculture in the vein of Reefer Madness. In 1992, the film was mocked on an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nOn rare occasions, Frees appeared on-camera, usually in minor roles. In 1954, he appeared in the film noir classic Suddenly starring Frank Sinatra and Sterling Hayden. He played a scientist in The Thing from Another World, a death-row priest in A Place in the Sun, and French fur trader McMasters in The Big Sky. In 1955, he appeared as an irate husband suing his wife (played by Ann Doran) for alimony in an episode of CBS's sitcom The Ray Milland Show; and, in 1957, in an uncredited role as a helicopter pilot in the 1957 science-fiction movie, Beginning of the End.\n\nIn Jet Pilot, Frees plays a menacing Soviet officer whose job is to watchdog pilot Janet Leigh, but instead manages to eject himself from a parked jet, enabling Leigh to rescue John Wayne and fly back to the West. He is also credited with narrating the opening of the 1958-1959 series Rescue 8 starring Jim Davis and Lang Jefferies. In the 1970 film Patton, Frees provided the voices of a war correspondent interviewing Patton while Patton rides his horse, and of a member of Patton's staff, as well as voice-overs for several other actors, including the Moroccan official hosting a troop review for Patton. Frees is also heard in Tora! Tora! Tora! as the English-language voice of the Japanese ambassador to the United States. He also does the final narration in Beneath the Planet of the Apes, the first sequel to Planet of the Apes.\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nSince Frees's death, voice actor Corey Burton has provided voices for some of Frees's characters.[citation needed] Burton, who met Frees in the late 1970s, has often re-recorded dialogue for some Disneyland attractions originally recorded by Frees.[22] In some cases, Frees's original, pre-digital recordings had simply deteriorated over time,[citation needed] and in others the dialogue had been rewritten to reflect plot changes or introduce new characters, such as the \"Stuffed Pirate\" replacing Frees's \"Pooped Pirate\" in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in 1997.[23] Dialogue that was slightly rewritten to reflect newer safety standards is performed by actors Joe Leahy (English)[24][25] and Fabio Rodriguez (Spanish).[26] In 2001, Burton provided a Paul Frees impression for the new \"Ghost Host\" of Haunted Mansion Holiday, a seasonal, holiday-themed overlay for the Haunted Mansion attraction.[27] Burton also recorded Frees's Ghost Host lines for Walt Disney Pictures' 2003 film adaptation of the ride.\n\nVoice actor Jim Kirk has also done several impressions of the \"Ghost Host\" at Disney's Haunted Mansion on Instagram and TikTok, channeling his inner Paul Frees for dramatic effect.[28]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nFrees was married five times. His first marriage was to Anelle McCloud, from 1943 until her death in 1945. He then married Kleda June Hansen in 1947, but they divorced three years later in 1950. His third wife was Joyce Schultz. They married in 1951 and had two children – a son, Fred; and a daughter, Sabrina – before eventually divorcing.[5] His fourth marriage was to Jeri J. Cole in 1967, but they divorced after just two years, in 1969. Beverly T. Marlow was Frees's fifth wife. They married in 1971 but were estranged at the time of his death fifteen years later.[29]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the last two years of his life, Frees suffered from multiple ailments, including arthritis, diabetes, and loss of vision, and had mentioned to friends that he was in near constant pain. Frees died at his home in Tiburon, California, on November 2, 1986, at the age of 66, from a self-administered overdose of pain medication. Despite his death being considered a suicide, his agent issued a press release stating that he died from heart failure.[30][5]\n\nFrees was survived by his son and daughter, and by Marlow, who had moved to Mesa, Arizona.[5][29] His body was cremated and his ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean.[5]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nLive-action\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nList of acting performances in feature films Film Year Title Role Notes 1949 The Adventures of Sir Galahad The Black Knight (voice) Uncredited 1950 Hunt the Man Down Packard 'Packy' Collins uncredited 1951 A Place in the Sun Reverend Morrison The Thing from Another World Dr. Vorhees His Kind of Woman Corley 1952 The Star Richard Stanley The Las Vegas Story District Attorney Uncredited 1953 The War of the Worlds Radio Reporter / Opening Announcer 1954 Suddenly Benny 1956 The Harder They Fall Priest Earth vs. the Flying Saucers Alien (voice) Uncredited Francis in the Haunted House Francis (voice) 1957 The 27th Day Ward Mason / Newscaster Jet Pilot Lieutenant Tiompkin The Cyclops Cyclops Beginning of the End Helicopter pilot Uncredited 1958 Space Master X-7 Dr. Charles T.
