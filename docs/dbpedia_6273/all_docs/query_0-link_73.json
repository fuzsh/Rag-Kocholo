I thank both for giving me the opportunity to study the computer-animated film. Deepest gratitude is reserved for my superlative PhD supervisor Michele Pierson, whose unwavering intellectual generosity and care for the project (as well as her trusty blue ink pen) made the work much better than it ought to have been, and the whole experience even more so. The seeds of this book were first sown whilst studying as an undergraduate student at the University of Warwick. I would therefore like to give wholehearted thanks to my very first film and television teachers José Arroyo, James Bennett, Charlotte Brunsdon, Stella Bruzzi, Richard Dyer, Ed Gallafent, Iris Kleinecke-Bates, Rachel Moseley, Amy Sargeant, Ginette Vincendeau and Helen Wheatley and for creating such an inspirational and encouraging environment all around me, and to V. F. Perkins for showing me first-hand the sheer enjoyment of it all. Though he won’t know it, Steve Allen’s last-minute decision to screen Toy Story instead of Jurassic Park on a first-year film history course caused a small lightbulb to turn on somewhere in the back of my mind that is luckily still burning bright. My thanks must also go to Tom Brown, another influential film teacher at Warwick and friend, and Jon Burrows, whose words of reassurance and supervision greatly shaped both the BA and then MA dissertations at Warwick that helped to further cultivate something of my animated enthusiasms. I continue to benefit immensely from the intellectual support of numerous teachers, colleagues and friends at King’s College and beyond, many of whom have delivered welcome moments of scholarly inspiration and clarity as this book came to fruition. Alice Haylett Bryan, Malcolm Cook, Amy M. Davis, Ivan Girina, Annabelle Honess Roe, Chris Pallant, Luke Robinson, Martha Shearer, Ben Tyrer and James Whitfield all offered their time, friendship, advice, honesty, recommendations and encouragement when I needed them most. I also wish to acknowledge the following people for their guidance and support that has come in many forms: Mark Betz, Jinhee Choi, Sarah Cooper, Victor Fan, Rosalind Galt, Hannah Hamad, Lawrence Napper, Mark Shiel, Belén Vidal and Catherine Wheatley. In addition to these names, I must add three people in particular. Edward Lamberti and Alexander Sergeant have been a constant source of friendship, and I am Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nvi\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\nenormously grateful to them both for contributing conversation, offering passionate defences of some of my early ideas that otherwise might have fallen by the wayside, keeping me focused, and then taking my mind off it all at just the right times. Sincere thanks also goes to Lilly Husbands, who provided unbeatable intellectual support during the turbulent emotions of writing and rewriting, and who continues to offer treasured friendship and characteristically excellent scholarly advice delivered with precision and humour. The opportunity to test out ideas at multiple conferences and in classrooms has been vital in seeing this project to its completion. I would like to thank in particular the many undergraduate and postgraduate students at King’s College London, London South Bank University, University of Kent and University of Surrey who have given me so much to think on and to question – their input and insights have been integral to the shape of my research. Gillian Leslie at Edinburgh University Press has been hugely supportive and enthusiastic about the project right from the start, and I thank too the reviewers for their comments on a previous draft of the manuscript. Earlier versions of Chapters 3 and 4 were previously published as ‘Notes on a Luxo world’, Animation Practice, Process & Production 4: 1 (December 2014), pp. 67–95, and ‘“I’m not a real boy, I’m a puppet’: Computer-Animated Films and Anthropomorphic Subjectivity’, animation: an interdisciplinary journal 11: 3 (November 2016), pp. 246–62, respectively. Some of the arguments in Chapter 6 appear in ‘Toying with performance: Toy Story, Virtual Puppetry and Computer-Animated Film Acting’ in Noel Brown, Susan Smith and Sam Summers (eds.), Toy Story (Animation: Key Films/Filmmakers) (London: Bloomsbury Academic, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc., 2018), pp. 87–104. I am tremendously grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their comments on these articles and chapters, and to the editors and publishers for the opportunity to further develop my thoughts around the computer-animated film. In addition, Barry Langford and Paul Wells were extremely forthcoming in the project’s early stages, with highly constructive feedback and advice when I was trying to mould everything into something that resembled a book on animation. I would also like to thank Anna Robertson, whose patience and encouragement during the writing made me believe that what I had to say might be worthwhile. Finally, I wish to make a special dedication to my parents, Frances and Robert, the best people I know. Their decision in the winter of 1992 to take me to see Walt Disney’s Aladdin as my very first film at the cinema probably explains a lot of what was to follow. To my siblings Doug, Emmajo and Louisa, for the love and laughter, I am grateful to each of you for allowing me to take over small parts of our childhood (and then even larger bits of our adulthood) with all things animation.

The rapid ascendency of computer-­animated filmmaking and the reinvention of animation as a computer-­generated medium has been widely recognised for its positive contribution to the fortunes of the US animation industry. Paul Grainge has argued that the first wave of computer-­animated blockbusters released during the 1990s and early 2000s inspired a ‘revival’ (2008: 119) of animation across millennial Hollywood cinema. Terms such as ‘revitalization’ (Krämer 2006: 168), ‘revivifying’ (Willis 2008: 47), ‘renewed’ (Dobson 2009: xlix), ‘rebirth’ (Sickels 2011: 95), ‘resurrection’ (Ghez 2011: 595), ‘resurgence’ (Brown 2012: 183) and ‘revolution’ (Sperb 2016: 86) all boldly announce the substantial impact of digital technology upon popular animated film in America. The Computer-Animated Film: Industry, Style and Genre traces the expansion of the computer-­animated film as a global phenomenon of mainstream Hollywood filmmaking and across a variety of other national cinemas. This book seeks to theorise the place of computer-­animated films within film and animation history and digital media culture, arguing that their visual currencies and formal attributes can be organised as a framework that supports their study as a new genre of contemporary cinema. This book therefore seeks to sharpen and develop the critical discussion of computer-­animated films’ defining industrial, technological, historical and textual features. It proposes a set of stylistic relationships between over 200 films released over more than a twenty-­year period, and produced by a variety of animation studios. Drawing such distinctions offers a more robust account of their visual style within the multifarious fields of popular animation and digitally assisted filmmaking. However, to Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n2\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\ntalk about computer-­animated films is to talk about the very recent history of Hollywood, and a group of films caught up in (if not fundamental to) the rapid computerisation of popular North American cinema during the mid-­1990s. This introduction therefore begins by outlining the shape of an increasingly competitive and stable computer-­animated film industry, one that began during the first decade of the new millennium, and evidenced the growing importance of computer graphics to mainstream Hollywood production.\n\nReanimating an Industry Taken together with the late-­ 1980s ‘renaissance’ of Disney Feature Animation and the almost simultaneous ‘artistic revitalization’ (Pallant 2011: 90) of the cartoon format on US television, the arrival of computer-­ animated films plotted an immediate upward trajectory for popular animation in America. Following the release of Pixar’s Toy Story (John Lasseter, 1995) on 22 November 1995, an exponential growth in the volume of studios invested in the production of feature-­length computer-­animated films reflected the industry’s direct reaction to the possibilities of three-­ dimensional computer graphics. The market response to Pixar’s debut feature was, as Scott Kirsner points out, the expansion of an animation industry almost immediately populated by copycat studios and ‘would-­be Pixars’ (2008: 74). A number of companies, facilities, divisions and subsidiaries rapidly emerged, many of which made the transition from visual effects companies offering ‘customized services on a contractual basis to major clients’ (Scott 2005: 96) to specialising in computer-­animated feature film production. With Pixar themselves having usurped the Walt Disney Studio ‘atop the proverbial heap in the cartoon world’ (Goldmark 2013: 214) through its computer-­animated films, their new station at the head of the global animation market was soon challenged as technical innovation, software availability, workforce expertise and augmented computer power enabled computer-­animated films to be produced more efficiently and cost-­effectively. Several film studios during the early 2000s established independent animation units as a way of integrating computer-­animated films into pre-­existing production hierarchies. In 2003, the San Francisco-­ based Lucasfilm founded Lucasfilm Animation; renowned visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) moved into full computer-­ animated film production with Rango (Gore Verbinski, 2011); and in 2007 filmmaker Robert Zemeckis’ ImageMovers studio founded a separate animation facility with Walt Disney Pictures under the banner Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nintr o duc t io n 3\n\nof ImageMovers Digital. Paramount Pictures announced the founding of Paramount Animation that same year, their own in-­house animation studio (their first since Paramount Cartoon Studios was dissolved in 1967) intended to challenge Pixar’s market dominance. Paramount was not the only studio to return to feature animation after a period of dormancy. Following a decade-­long hiatus from theatrical cartoons (producing only television series and shorts for The WB and Cartoon Network), Warner Brothers announced in 2013 that it was resuming feature animation as the newly formed Warner Animation Group (WAG), the successor to Warner Bros. Feature Animation that had shut down in 2004. WAG’s inaugural feature was the computer-­animated film The LEGO Movie (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, 2014), animated by Australian visual effects studio Animal Logic, who had produced their own computer-­ animated feature films Happy Feet (George Miller, 2006) and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole (Zack Snyder, 2010) a few years earlier. The restructuring of many other US studios with longer animated histories resulted in the progressive phasing out of traditional cel-­animation methods, with digital technologies firmly dislodging hand-­drawn practices as the animated film’s principal language. Crest Animation Productions, Arc Productions (formerly Starz Animation) and DNA Productions all converted from cel-­animated features to exclusively computer-­animated filmmaking. In 2000, DreamWorks Animation (initially a division of DreamWorks SKG, though now a subsidiary of NBCUniversal) purchased digital effects company Pacific Data Images, and the two merged to become DreamWorks Animation, which was spun out as a separate company in 2004 (DreamWorks would purchase another computer animation unit in 2012, Big Idea Productions). As DreamWorks co-­founder and ex-­Disney Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg proclaimed, ‘traditional animation is a thing of the past’ (in Sito 2006: 339). Among the many animation units shifting production from traditional techniques to become exclusively all-­digital animation studios, most seismic of these was Disney. The Disney studio’s fluctuating commercial and critical fortunes (particularly during the 1970s and 1980s, and then again in the early 2000s) have been used to graph the historical rise and fall of American animation as an industrial art form. In response to the force of the marketplace, Disney announced that it was ceasing traditional methods after its forty-­fifth (and, at that time, final) cel-­animated feature Home on the Range (Will Finn and John Sanford, 2004). Disney’s decision to jettison its hand-­drawn heritage in favour of computer-­animated filmmaking for its next feature, Chicken Little (Mark Dindal, 2005), signalled what John Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n4\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\nCanemaker (2005) called the end of an ‘indigenously American contribution to the international art form of animation’. The sheer volume of computer-­animated films and the rapid growth of Hollywood animation over the last twenty years has, however, prompted occasional moments of uncertainty. As early as 2006, several journalists in the US were suggesting that the computer-­animated film market may have reached its saturation point, only twenty years after the first computer-­ animated short, Pixar’s Luxo Jr. (John Lasseter, 1986), and a little over a decade since Toy Story. This unexpected congestion was widely noted in the Hollywood trade press, including cautionary pieces that made their way into the pages of Screen International and the Hollywood Reporter.1 In Variety, Ben Fritz and Dave McNary pointed out that the thirteen computer-­animated films due for release in the US during 2006 was a ‘record so out of proportion to recent years that marketers are wondering if the business has the capacity to absorb them all’ (2006: 1). Between 2007 and 2008, another ‘mass of features’ were released across America including Shrek the Third (Chris Miller and Raman Hui, 2007), Ratatouille (Brad Bird, 2007), Bee Movie (Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner, 2007) and Kung Fu Panda (John Stevenson and Mark Osborne, 2008), all of which were ‘big-­exposure’ computer-­animated films replete with ‘exorbitant budgets’ (Goldmark 2013: 214) and sustained marketing campaigns. More recently, in 2016, Hollywood’s sixteen major computer-­animated film releases (three up on the total for 2015) that premiered between Walt Disney’s Zootopia (Byron Howard and Rich Moore, 2016) in March and DreamWorks Animation’s Trolls (Mike Mitchell, 2016) in November once again surfaced popular and industry fears around another potential bumper year in which supply would outweigh demand. The question of market capacity is not far from the production of computer-­animated films, particularly as American studios remain increasingly susceptible to the lure of animation. However, any caution expressed by the Hollywood trade press against industry surplus has typically been a readymade response to box office under-­performance. In an earlier Variety piece from 2004, for example, Fritz had noted that for investors there was ‘no downside in CGI-­animated ­pics – a­ t least not yet’, and speculated that their financial security ‘will inevitably hit a bump in the road’ (2004: 6). Just two years later, Fritz and McNary’s scepticism at market saturation was in response to one such ‘bump’, namely the critical and commercial disappointment of Pixar’s Cars (John Lasseter, 2006). In 2013, Richard Verrier warned again that the ‘abundance’ of computer-­animated films might be once again ‘nearing a saturation point’ (2013). Verrier not only identified the eleven films readied for theatrical Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nintr o duc t io n 5\n\nrelease in the summer of 2013, but the thirteen slated for 2014 and the total of seventy-­ five computer-­ animated films produced since 2008. Yet his counsel of a congestion in computer-­animated film production was likewise cued by the poor critical and commercial performance of DreamWorks’ Rise of the Guardians (Peter Ramsey 2012) and Turbo (David Soren, 2013), two films described by Verrier as ‘high-­profile stumbles’ and ‘unexpected misfire[s]’ (ibid.) at odds with the high ticket sales normally expected of computer-­animated feature films. The generally positive critical and commercial reception of computer-­ animated films has certainly alleviated any concern over their projected over-­supply within the Hollywood entertainment industry. Highly profitable family-­oriented computer-­animated films have consistently attracted strong audiences ­and – ­since Toy Story and A Bug’s Life (John Lasseter, 1998) became the top grossing films of 1995 and 1998 ­respectively – ­have continued to perform successfully at both the US and global box offices. In 2012, the London-­based IHS Markit analysis group reported that the ‘booming popularity’ of computer-­animated films between 2001 and 2011 had doubled the US total box office for animated features. Their revenue within the American theatrical market is a clear indication that computer-­ animated films lie at the heart of today’s Hollywood film industry. It comes as little surprise, then, that Kristin Thompson suggested back in 2006 the anxieties expressed by studio executives and critical commentators over that year’s surge were ‘bizarre’ given their box office successes and typically favourable reviews. Thompson argued that computer-­animated films remained among the ‘best work’ (2011: 159) being produced by mainstream Hollywood, and described them as one of the most popular, commercially successful and critically lauded cinematic forms currently circulating within the global film market. The healthy commercial reputation of computer-­animated films has certainly made them increasingly desirable investments, sustaining studio interest in the production of feature-­length animation. Shilo T. McClean has specifically attributed the economic viability of computer-­animated films (especially those made at Pixar) to a ‘new willingness for studios to back long-­form animation’, previously considered to be ‘too expensive and of a limited market’ (2007: 99–100). Produced at Mac G ­ uff – a­ French visual effects studio founded in 1988, but purchased in 2011 by California-­ based production company Illumination ­Entertainment – ­the computer-­ animated film Despicable Me 2 (Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, 2013) is the most profitable film in the 101-­year history of the Universal studio. Disney’s blockbuster Frozen (Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, 2013) holds the distinction of being the top grossing animated film of all time, with Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n6\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\nonly one film in the current top ten not computer-­animated (Disney’s The Lion King [Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, 1994]). McClean, as well as Pat Brereton (2012), have noted how the ongoing achievements of the computer-­animated film in the post-­exhibition arenas of DVD/home video entertainment have only extended their lucrative commercial and consumer value. In a 2015 list of best-­selling DVDs of the past decade, the top position was once again held by Frozen, which has sold 4.26 million copies since its release in March 2014, with another computer-­animated film, the original Despicable Me (Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, 2010), currently ranked at number four. Pixar’s Finding Nemo (Andrew Stanton, 2003) remains the best-­selling DVD of all time, symbolically replacing previous number one, Disney’s cel-­animated musical The Lion King.\n\nTo Hollywood and Beyond Just as Silicon Valley’s proximity to Hollywood contributed to the area’s ‘preeminence as the locus of digital cinema’ during the late 1980s (Brown 2013: 13), Toy Story’s roots in the offices of Pixar’s then-home in Richmond, California have worked to frame North America as the standard bearer of computer-­animated film production. Yet in 2009, The New York Times ran a short feature titled ‘Animation Upstarts Are Joining the Fray’, which squared the rising volume of computer-­animated films (fourteen in 2009 compared with five in 2008) to the multitude of independent production companies now competing for their share of the Hollywood animation market. The influx of certain ‘newcomers’ was, on the one hand, still fixed to US-­based studios Snoot Toons (Battle for Terra [Aristomenis Tsirbas, 2007]) and the Exodus Film Group (Igor [Tony Leondis, 2008]), while major American studios like DreamWorks were also noted as intending to ‘ramp up production’ by ‘delivering five films every two years’ (Barnes 2009). However, the main focus of the article was Ilion Animation Studios, a Madrid-­based animation facility founded in 2002 and whose blockbuster computer-­animated feature film Planet 51 (Jorge Blanco, 2009) coincided with ‘event’ releases by Pixar, Sony, Twentieth ­Century Fox, and Imagi Studios in Hong Kong. In the twenty-three years that have elapsed since Toy Story, the computer-­animated feature film has become a global business, and many studios have extended the computer-­animated film industry beyond the geography and industrial filmmaking systems of Hollywood. Computer-­ animated films continue to be produced and distributed in countries such as Spain, Germany, Argentina, Hungary, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, Holland, India and with the release of the twenty-­minute Buz-e-Chini/The Goat Not for distribution or resale.

Since 2008, animation has emerged at the ‘forefront’ of the New Korean Wave, with ‘Korea’s own computer-­ generated cartoons [. . .] met with unprecedented levels of global success’ that has reinvigorated the Korean animation industry (Jin 2016: 18). In China, and despite origins as far back as the work of the Wan Brothers in the 1940s, animation has likewise ‘come into its own’ and ‘become a nation-­building industry’ thanks to CGI (MacDonald 2016: 1–2). The recent Oriental DreamWorks venture by DreamWorks Animation (with China Media Capital, Shanghai Media Group and Shanghai Alliance Investment) in 2012, and whose debut feature Kung Fu Panda 3 (Jennifer Yuh Nelson and Alessandro Carloni, 2016) became China’s highest grossing animated feature (Brzeski 2016), further bears out the lucrative place of computer animation within the Chinese film market. Richard Neupert similarly considers French computer-­animated films such as Renaissance (Christian Volckman, 2006) – a black and white, futuristic science fiction ­feature – ­as having redefined animation as ‘economically important, aesthetically vibrant, and culturally crucial to France’s persistently impressive national cinema’ (2011: 149). The success of the more recent A Monster in Paris (Bibo Bergeron, 2011) once again ‘proved that France could produce a world-­class digital feature with the sorts of spectacle, musical numbers, and engaging characters that one would find at Aardman, DreamWorks, or Pixar’ (Neupert 2015: 350). Indeed, British animation studio Aardman, whose reputation had been founded on stop-­ motion ‘claymation’ techniques pioneered in Chicken Run (Peter Lord and Nick Park, 2000) and Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (Nick Park and Steve Box, 2005), had themselves entered the computer-­ animated film market in partnership with DreamWorks for Flushed Away (David Bowers and Sam Fell, 2006). Aardman’s second feature, Arthur Christmas (Sarah Smith, 2011), was produced in collaboration with Sony Pictures Animation, a specialist animated film production company newly formed in May 2002 as a sub-­division of Sony Pictures Entertainment. Many other countries have acclimatised to the possibilities for computer-­ animated film production. Khan Kluay (Kompin Kemgumnird, 2006) is the first Thai animated feature film since the cel-­animated film The Adventure of Sudsakorn (Payut Ngaokrachang, 1979), with a sequel Khan Kluay 2 (Taweelap Srivuthivong, 2009) released three years later. The Emperor’s Secret (Riina Hyytia, 2006), The Adventures of Alyonushka and Yeryoma (Georgi Gitis, 2008), Goat Story (Jan Tománek, 2008), Gnomes and Trolls: The Secret Chamber (Robert Rhodin, 2008), RPG Metanoia (Luis C.

Costing $21 million, Underdogs (Juan José Campanella, 2013) is the most expensive Argentine film of all time, and the most expensive Latin American animated feature ever. Wicked Flying Monkeys (Alberto Mar, 2015) was described in the US trade press as ‘the biggest film production to date from Mexico’s Anima Estudios’ (Hopewell 2015), while El Americano: The Movie (Ricardo Arnaiz and Mike Kunkel, 2016) is first co-­production between Mexican and US studios. The Cape Town-­based Triggerfish, the studio behind computer-­animated films Zambezia (Wayne Thornley, 2012) and Khumba (Anthony Silverton, 2013), is known as the ‘Pixar of South Africa’ (Szalai 2013). Within these local productions, Denmark and Belgium have particularly vibrant computer-­animated film industries, the latter spearheaded almost entirely by the figure of Ben Stassen. Founded by Stassen in 1994, nWave Pictures have produced six computer-­animated films (all directed or co-­directed by Stassen), including Fly Me to the Moon (2008), The House of Magic (2013), The Wild Life (2016) and The Son of Bigfoot (2017). For Variety’s Guy Lodge, the nWave studio represents ‘a marker of just how swiftly Euro animation houses are catching up with their Hollywood counterparts’ (2014). Many European computer-­ animated feature films are obtaining greater visibility among international audiences via the vast distribution networks provided by US partner studios. Planet 51 was distributed by Sony (although distribution of Ilion’s next feature Mortadelo & Filemon, Mission: Implausible [Javier Fesser, 2014] was handled by Warner Brothers); Wicked Flying Monkeys by Lionsgate; while two Spanish computer-­animated features, Tad: The Lost Explorer (Enrique Gato, 2012) and Capture the Flag (Enrique Gato, 2015), marked the first time a major Hollywood studio (Paramount Pictures) had acquired worldwide distribution right for Spanish films following their strong domestic box office. Between February 2010 and August 2017, nWave also held a long-­term production partnership with StudioCanal, which exploited their direct distribution territories (UK, France, and Germany) and provided theatrical distribution for their computer-­animated films in the North American market. Several Hollywood studios such as Illumination Entertainment, DreamWorks Animation, Paramount and MGM have recently taken advantage of the increasing eminence of these international animation facilities by outsourcing computer-­animated film production, mostly to effects studios in France. In 2014, Ilion Animation was also Not for distribution or resale.

The thematic similarities between pairs of computer-­animated films produced by ­Hollywood – ­including Shark Tale (Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman, 2004), Finding Nemo and Shark Bait (Howard E. Baker and John Fox, 2006); Madagascar (Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, 2005) and The Wild (Steve Williams, 2006); Ratatouille and Flushed Away; and The Book of Life (Jorge R. Gutierrez, 2014) and Coco (Lee Unkrich, 2017) – has been matched by the rise of the transnational computer-­animated ‘mockbuster’. Mockbusters are traditionally ‘low-­budget films that are unapologetic rip-­offs of recent big-­budget films’ (Booker 2011: 49). Examples of this practice include the computer-­ animated features made by Brazilian company Vídeo Brinquedo, whose straight-to-video The Little Cars (Cristiano Valente, 2006), Ratatoing (Michelle Gabriel, 2007), Tiny Robots (Michelle Gabriel, 2008) and Little Bee (Michelle Gabriel, 2009) are mockbusters of Cars, Ratatouille, Robots (Chris Wedge, 2005)/Wall-E (Andrew Stanton, 2008) and Bee Movie respectively. The rhetoric of these imitative mockbusters seems to enact a longstanding core/periphery model between North America and other national cinemas. Yet these ‘local’ responses to the blockbuster computer-­ animated films of contemporary Hollywood animation continues the range of domestic mockbusters that similarly mine the cultural visibility of more ‘official’ computer-­ animated productions. Renegade Animation (US), Allumination Filmworks (US), Simka Entertainment (US), Brightspark Productions (UK) and Phase 4 Films (Canada) have all produced and distributed computer-­animated film mockbusters, evidencing how the manufacture of low-­ budget copycat features has remained a ‘largely American practice’ (Frelik 2014: 249) just as much as popular Hollywood cinema has historically been reworked and remade within ulterior national contexts. At the same time, the discourse of originality and resemblance that supports the mockbuster trend reflects the international capital of the computer-­animated film as a popular global form. Despite the clear international reach of computer-­animated filmmaking, and the numerous low- to mid-­budget features produced worldwide (typically financed at around 20% of the cost of Hollywood computer-­ animated films), many non-­US studios are admittedly still playing ‘catch up’ with the major Hollywood animation studios. Where previously years separated North American computer-­animated films, the gap is now a matter of months, especially as the big American studios have the Not for distribution or resale.

Since Shark Tale and Shrek 2 (Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, 2004) in 2004, DreamWorks have (aside from 2009) released two computer-­animated films annually, spiking at three releases in both 2010 and 2014. Computer-­animated feature film production evidently remains of growing importance to the North American film industry, and a lucrative and highly profitable business. Yet the particular strengths of American animation as an industrial art form can be squared to its stable studio infrastructure and quality of creative personnel.\n\nThe New American Cartoon Beyond the name recognition of John Lasseter (Disney/Pixar) and Jeffrey animated films have proven a Katzenberg (DreamWorks), computer-­ magnet for attracting high-­profile directors from live-­action film into animation for the first time. The involvement of eminent directorial figures with a renowned pedigree in live-­action cinema, such as Robert Zemeckis (The Polar Express [2004]; Beowulf [2007]; A Christmas Carol [2009]), George Miller (Happy Feet and Happy Feet Two [2011]), Zack Snyder (Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole), Gore Verbinski (Rango), and Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson (The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn [2011]), has afforded a whole new level of artistic credibility to feature-­length animation. Andrew Adamson (Shrek 2), Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), Chris Wedge (Ice Age [2002]), Brad Bird (The Incredibles [2004], Ratatouille), Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs [2009]), Gil Kenan (Monster House [2006]), and Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who! [2008]) are also all filmmakers that have moved into live-­action feature film production following their work directing computer-­animated films. The digital rejuvenation of US animation has further transformed the American cartoon by reprising something of a classic Hollywood sensibility. If Golden Age filmmaking in the studio era had the ‘Big Five’ and the ‘Little Three’ as part of its vertically integrated supply chain, then the computer-­animated film industry of contemporary Hollywood operates according to an analogous structure, with a ‘Big Five’ of Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney, Illumination Entertainment and another studio, Blue Sky. Founded in 1987 following the demise of computer technology Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nintr o duc t io n 11\n\ncompany Mathematical Applications Group, Inc., Blue Sky Studios began, like Pixar, as a visual effects company, and in 1997, were acquired by Twentieth C ­ entury Fox to produce computer-­animated feature films. Fox had already sought to break into lucrative feature animation themselves with the founding of Fox Animation Studio in 1994, headed by ex-­Disney character animator Don Bluth. However, Fox’s unit closed in 2000 having produced only two feature films, Anastasia (Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, 1997) and Titan A.E. (Don Bluth and Gary Goldman, 2000), and their partnership with Blue Sky (which is now a subsidiary of Twentieth ­Century Fox) was specifically intended to produce competitive computer-­animated feature films. It is these ‘Big Five’ that currently account for the majority of mainstream computer-­animated film production in Hollywood, and as of late 2017 have contributed a total of seventy-­six computer-­animated films between them (Pixar nineteen; DreamWorks twenty-­nine; Disney nine; Blue Sky twelve; Illumination Entertainment seven). However, these studios’ market dominance is not the only analogue to 1940s Hollywood. The loyalty that many employees have to specific animation facilities has provoked further comparisons between contemporary computer-­ animated film production and studio era filmmaking. The Pixar studio’s operations are not far from ‘Hollywood of six decades ago’ (Feeney 2009), insofar as the authorial signatures of individual expression circulate within stringent industrial parameters. Pixar have outwardly promoted their production culture according to a classical studio template, emphasising close creative and long-­term relationships with personnel, lack of migration between studios, and a loyal stable workforce. Many other creative figures are synonymous with computer-­animated film production through studio affiliation, such as Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha (Blue Sky Studios); Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud (Illumination Entertainment); and Conrad Vernon and Tom McGrath (DreamWorks Animation) amongst many others. The terms under which Pixar ‘blazed a trail for computer-­ animated films’ (Meinel 2016: 8) can be no less understood according to its formation of an industry template rooted in these same discourses of studio exclusivity. The Pixar Brain T ­ rust – a­ creative consortium that emphasises cohesive in-­house filmmaker ­collaboration – ­was closely followed by the inception of the Disney Story Trust (also by Lasseter) and then the Warner Brothers Think Tank, which comprises both live-­action and animation directors as part of its talent group. Given the vibrancy of contemporary computer-­ animated filmmaking, it is perhaps unsurprising that Dietmar Meinel speaks of a current state of ‘intensified competition’ (ibid.) supporting the North American Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n12\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\nanimation market. Particular rivalries between Pixar and DreamWorks have been widely documented in hagiographic corporate histories, and their creative enmity has invited comparison with the fruitful Golden Age competition between Walt Disney and Warner Brothers. Kathleen McDonnell remembers how the simultaneous release of DreamWorks’ Antz (Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, 1998) and Pixar’s A Bug’s Life in the late 1990s ‘saw the start of what was termed the Animation Wars’ (2005: 71). This ‘war’ was publicly fought at the 2002 Academy Awards in the category for Best Animated Feature, an honour created to respect the high quality of computer-­animated films and to recognise their revitalisation of US animation. Describing the competition between DreamWorks’ Shrek (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, 2001) and Pixar’s Monsters, Inc. (Pete Docter, 2001) for the category’s inaugural prize, Paul Karon anticipated that within the Hollywood film industry the future of animation ‘is probably healthier than many have predicted’ (2002: 36). It is difficult to comprehensively quantify the good ‘health’ of contemporary computer-­animated films, and to critically explain what is not only a mainstay of contemporary Hollywood cinema but now a mass cultural phenomenon. When a Buzz Lightyear action figure spent fifteen months orbiting the Earth aboard the Discovery Space Shuttle in May 2008, his catchphrase ‘to infinity and beyond’ became dramatically fulfilled. The elderly protagonist of Pixar’s Up (Pete Docter, 2009), Carl Fredericksen, is currently an ambassador for the Hear the World Foundation initiative, while the eponymous green ogre Shrek has been the spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) obesity campaign across America since 2007. But the reputation and regard of computer-­ animated films among both critics and audiences demands further exploration, because, as Barry Langford points out, it is ‘enormously difficult to compute popularity’ (2005: 19). The central argument of this book is ultimately that the feature-­length computer-­animated film constitutes a unique, but as yet undetermined and unrecognised, genre of contemporary cinema. There is certainly something regular and uniform, even generic, about computer-­animated films. This homogeneity is undoubtedly a function of a Hollywood industry well versed in exploiting the commercial stability and security of sameness afforded by repeating pleasures. Geoff King points out that it is ‘not hard to make sense of genre from an industrial animated perspective’ (2002a: 118), and the packaging of computer-­ films according to what this book argues is a successful narrative and characterological formula has strengthened the business and commercial structures of contemporary Hollywood’s highly ‘animated’ film industry. Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nintr o duc t io n 13\n\nCriticisms of similarity between computer-­animated films have equally supported discourses of volume and oversupply. Writing in the midst of Hollywood’s computer-­animated film surge of 2006, Laura M. Holson noted that ‘while animation continues to be popular with families, audiences complain that it is suffering from too much sameness, with movie plots and characters looking increasingly alike’ (2006). Rather than straitjacketing or impeding their close analysis through an emphasis on their many continuities, this book argues that genre provides a critical framework for better understanding the repeating content, style and formal codes of communication of computer-­animated films. The purpose of what follows is therefore to identify the features of the computer-­animated film that act as a promise of content: the generic data with which they have been encoded, and the combination and prominence of particular features across multiple computer-­animated films that mark them as distinctive. The recognition of a computer-­animated film genre should not run counter to the identification of their singularity, or violate their formal specificities. The establishment of a meaningful genre framework groups multiple film examples together, but creates an ‘orderly genericity’ (Langford 2005: 265) among a collection of popular cinema forms not normally considered in this way. Yet while genre as an interpretive label has been greatly underestimated within their critical lexicon, computer-­animated films have attracted a diverse range of attention and theorisation as the field of ‘animation studies’ has expanded almost parallel to their commercial and critical popularity. This introduction therefore continues by tracing something of this scholarly path, whilst using the story of how the computer-­animated film’s multitude of pleasures has been told to present several broader concerns of the book along the way.\n\nThe Reality Effect The elasticity of ‘digital cinema’ as a critical label bears out a degree of variance to a cinema that is (post-) produced, distributed and exhibited digitally. William Brown argues there are ‘many digital forms and filmmaking practices’, including ‘digital animations, such as Toy Story’, which fall under the auspices of a possible digital cinema (2013: 13). The contribution of digital animation and CGI within a mainstream Hollywood cinema context, however, remains largely understood through the framework of computer-­based special or visual effects (North 2008; Prince 2012; Brown 2013; Purse 2013; Whissel 2014; North et al. 2015; Turnock 2015; Keil and Whissel 2016).

For personal use only.\n\n14\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\ngenres, and with a focus on live-­action/CG composites, has meant that computer-­animated films have been mentioned only briefly as a footnote within visual effects discourse. Numerous other theorists, by comparison, have held a stronger stake in the computer-­animated film, getting to know its aesthetics, style, narratives and characters in a multitude of ways. The most fundamental assumption about computer-­animated films is that they perform an aesthetic function, offering finely tuned realistic-­ looking images of unprecented detail, resolution and surface texture. The popular and critical appreciation of their visual complexity are firmly embroiled in discourses of control (of the film image) and management of its visual (illusionist, simulationist, mimetic) possibilities. By confronting head-­on the seduction and spectacle of convincing computer graphics, certain phenomenological accounts citing the computer-­animated film counter any critical assumption that the boundaries of film sensorium and embodied spectatorship are policed solely by experimental and avant-­ garde film practices, or that they operate chiefly outside Hollywood within international art cinemas. Paying particular attention to how Toy Story’s slick, pristine computer-­generated imagery beckons our fingers, Jennifer M. Barker writes that the film’s nostalgic charm is inextricably linked to both its ‘tactile allure’ and the ‘surface of its skins’ (2009: 44–5). Vivian Sobchack is no less enamoured by the aesthetic detailing of Toy Story’s digital imagery, distinguishing the redolence of its digital surfaces and the toys’ manufactured shell that are presented to (and for) enjoyment by the body’s senses (2004: 54). Such a turn towards the ‘haptic visuality’ (Marks 2000) of digital imagery, and the situating of computer-­animated films among theories of affect and sensuous experience, belongs to a longer history of academic writing that had responded to computer-­animation’s impressive capacity for visual realism. As a reaction to Hollywood cinema’s shifting aesthetic and stylistic repertoire throughout the 1990s, computer-­generated imagery had, from its inception, been exhaustively examined as an emerging technology of persuasive realistic representation (Prince 1996). Discourses of realism no less inform the animation industry’s development of computer graphics. Progressions in texture and shadow mapping, the calculation of colour dispersal and the accuracy of raytracing light paths have brought a hitherto unseen sophistication to digitally animated aesthetics. The result is that, for David Bordwell, computer-­animated films are ‘overstuffed’ in their mise en scène, and so detailed in their surface accuracy as to ‘display a cinematic sophistication that fits contemporary tastes in live-­action movies’ (2011: 231). However, in the immediate post-Toy Story period, Andrew Darley (1997; 2000) and Julia Moszkowicz Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nintr o duc t io n 15\n\n(2002) sought to move the critical discussion of digital realism within the computer-­animated film context beyond any narrow focus on the ability of computer graphics to hold up a mirror to organic reality, and the creation of digital images that simply corresponded to the ‘light, colour, texture, movement and sound’ (Prince 1996: 23–37) of natural phenomena. Terms like ‘second-­order realism’ (Darley 1997) were suggested as useful categories to determine the visual regime of computer-­ animated films by speaking more explicitly to a perceived hybridisation of image-­making technologies. For example, Darley asked of Toy Story ‘is it cartoon animation, three-­dimensional (puppet) animation, live-­action or, perhaps, a combination of all three?’ (2000: 84). This optical illusion of the analogue would, in time, be subsumed ­by – ­and collapsed ­into – ­the dominant category of photorealism, particularly as new media theory became increasingly attentive to CGI’s capacity for cinematographic verisimilitude. As a similarly ‘second-­order’ visual discourse of photographic realism, photorealism quickly confirmed ‘the simulacral nature of digital images’ in the way that ‘they look not like original reality, or real life, but like copies of that reality’ (Brown 2013: 27). Darley and Moszkowicz thus heralded the first wave of computer-­animated films for their ability to refashion or ‘remediate’ (Boulter and Grusin 2000) cinematic realism and photography, expressing their broader affectation for lens-­based media as part of their dominant photorealistic agenda. Borrowed by film theorists from the language of new media (to cite Lev Manovich’s [2001] work on digital cinema), the audacious ‘remediation’ of the codes of live-­action cinema and the development of photorealistic effects (motion blur, depth of field, simulation of anamorphic lenses) can be understood as a digital (re)production of a cinematographic register. It is certainly not uncommon for the popular and critical lexicon of animated films to report with renewed enthusiasm on the computer-­ sophisticated levels of realism achieved in the post-­photographic age of heightened simulation. Paul Ward points out how realism remains an ‘unavoidable heuristic’ (2002: 132) for CGI given the polished glossiness and synthetic sheen of digital aesthetics. However, the limitations of what computer-­animated films are able to accomplish and where they can go stylistically are governed by self-­imposed regulations for production. William Schaffer (2004) and J. P. Telotte (2010) have each described how Pixar’s computer-­animated films strike creative bargains with the real, adopting a compromise position that checks the received teleological narrative of realism with the expressive possibilities of the cartoon. When Sobchack similarly asked ‘what do we want from animation?’ (2006: 172) in an analysis of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Hironobu Sakaguchi, Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n16\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\n2001) she both declared and unmasked the ‘myth’ of total animation and the assumed ‘authentic’ address of digital imagery as a way of responding to a cluster of computer-­animated films that had ‘shied away [. . .] from character ‘realism of any kind but emotional’ (ibid.: 173). The scholarly negotiation of the fluctuating (rather than fixed) levels of realist representation has prompted a wealth of neologistic terms such as ‘third realism’ (Cotta Vaz 1999), ‘photosurrealistic’ (Apodaca and Gritz 2000), ‘spectacular realism’ (Lister et al. 2009), and ‘irreality’ (Sobchack 2006: 179), all committed to defining a computer-­animated film aesthetic that operates in excess of realism: that is, marking a concession to the not-­quite-­ real within digital representation. Challenging the view that computer graphics are universally driven by an underlying realist hypothesis, Patrick Power (2008) envisaged a possible future for computer-­animated films in which there would lie a greater range of formal expression. This possible future has since been partially realised by a computer-­animated film industry that is increasingly turning towards ‘painterly’ rendering and image processing techniques, either by compositing cel-­animation together with cutting-­edge CGI, or in the digital replication of hand-­drawn styles. Disney’s Bolt (Byron Howard and Chris Williams, 2008) pioneered Disney’s NPR (non-­photorealistic) aesthetic, which countered the ‘hard clean geometric solutions’ characteristic of ‘CG algorithms’ (Lusinsky et al. 2009). By employing the ‘raypainting’ technique of editing detailed brushstrokes into larger three-­dimensional block colour models, and then buttressing these NPR processes with ‘tools from film such as exposure and depth of field’ (ibid.), Bolt offered a new painterly direction for computer graphics. For Helen Haswell (2014), Pixar and Disney’s nostalgic evocation of organic and imperfect hand-­drawn animation traditions (pen-­and-­ink, artistic illustration) in its shorts Day & Night (Teddy Newton, 2010), La Luna (Enrico Casarosa, 2011) and Paperman (John Kahrs, 2012) also provides a corrective to the net visual objective of computer-­generated images as that of heightened verismilitude. However, Power had already found tentative evidence of new ‘expressive advances in CG features’ (2009: 119) in the soundscapes of Pixar’s earlier Wall-E, and the Seussian exaggeration of character design in Horton Hears a Who!, which each pushed at the boundaries of the digital’s presumed telos of naturalism. The visual achievements of the computer-­animated film are certainly a central concern of this book, and in particular the identification of a set of formal devices that exist at the juncture where software meets film style. Informed by wider technological discourses and the status of animation as an industrial art form, this book not only theorises computer-­animated Not for distribution or resale.

Certain chapters argue that the distinctiveness of computer-­animated films can be located not just within the impressive accomplishments of photorealist simulation and the pleasure in the detail, but in the particular coherency of their stylistic range and formal repertoire. Chapter 4, for example, focuses on the exploitation of the virtual screen space through the innovative perspectives of capricious anthropomorphic characters, whose industrious activity creates a visual style (rooted in a non-­anthropocentric point of view) that coexists with the systems of classical Hollywood continuity. In Chapter 5, the computer-­ animated film’s re-­evalution of everyday objects, including the detailed depiction of junk, waste and discarded rubbish, is used to identify how they regularly play across the poles of microscopic representation and magnification, drawing on the opportunities afforded by scale to creatively re-­define cultural detritus through both its abundance and user potential. Greater scholarly intercessions have recently been made on behalf of computer-­animated film narratives that are becoming progressively smarter and more self-­reflective about the discourses of realism that inform them. Well-­versed in the technological and larger industry processes involved in computer-­animated film production, Telotte (2010), Thomas Elsaesser and Malte Hagener (2010) discussed the ways realism has been co-­opted into the ‘stuff of narration’, which ‘catches-­up’ the spectator in their own ‘simulacrum effect’ (Telotte 2010: 204). Whereas Darley initially argued that Toy Story is ‘about realist and illusionary qualities, not character or plot’ (2000: 87), it has become increasingly difficult to cleave form from content. The last two chapters of this book, for example, explore how the computer-­animated film’s pursuit of cinematic realism can be anchored to its strong comic verve. If contemporary visual culture has sounded the death knell for photographic cinema through the impact of digital (forms of) cinema, then Chapter 9 explains how character interaction with elements of film form (logo sequences, closing credits and widescreen matte bars) harnesses the very elements of cinema’s formal grammar as a way of extending the boundaries of the ‘deconstructive’ cartoon tradition. Chapter 10 similarly focuses on how the technical realisation and persuasive simulation of digital images that appear to be photographic are part of the computer-­animated films’ comic repertoire. It argues that the ability of the virtual camera to simulate the nuances of anamorphic lenses, ‘cinematic perspective’ (Prince 2012: 95) and focal lengths are actively reworked by the computer-­animated film as fresh sites for comedy.

In this age of Antz ‘meets Adorno’ (Strzelczyk 2008: 208), ideological criticism has certainly afforded computer-­ animated films increasing theoretical visibility and a greater level of critical focus across multiple disciplines. Computer-­animated films are not ideologically innocuous forms of commercial, family entertainment, but are rich in political allegory and serve to encode certain hegemonic values. They have been interpreted as allegorical expressions, or barometers, of an underlying social, political and economic problematic, read as instruments of cultural pedagogy that reiterate normative ideologies and discourses about race, class, gender and sexuality. The symptomatic interpretation (in Bordwell’s terminology [1989]) of computer-­animated films has therefore yielded compelling and often contentious readings that have split these digital texts ‘apart at the seams’, and penetrated into the cracks that ‘riddle’ their formal coherence (Comolli and Narboni 1977: 7). As a taxonomy of the computer-­animated film’s political functioning, such readings operate at the juncture where the ‘shiny reflective surface of the Toy Story movies’ (Botting and Wilson 2004: 70) meets the unconscious critical desire to examine the perversely utopian world of the taboo or prohibited. Yet not all ideological analysis is unambiguously critical. Richard Stamp (2004) argues that even ‘insidious’ ideologies drawn from the computer-­animated film coexist with socio-­political possibilities of critique, equipping children with tools to manoeuvre around racial, gender and sexual dynamics at a stage in their lives in which they are learning society’s most valuable lessons. Computer-­ animated films have ultimately provoked the ‘same old pedagogies’ of gender and sexuality that Elizabeth Marshall and Özlem Sensoy (2009) argue normally come with the territory of animation’s ideological underpinnings.

Strzelczyk argues that the angst and neuroses of Z in Antz are borne out by voice actor Woody Allen and his characteristic Jewishness. For Suzan G. Brydon the ‘high-­pitched commands’ of clownfish Marlin in Finding Nemo similarly contribute to the ‘mothering’ of his character, and he uses phrases ‘stereotypically attributed to mothers’ policing of children’ (2009: 139). In the case of Shrek 2, the casting of Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas are central determinants in the confirmation of Donkey and Puss as reflecting (and reflective) of contemporary cultural stereotypes (Brabham 2006), in particular the negative portrayal of ‘black’ and ‘Latino’ characters. The allying of black actor Murphy’s energetic voice and quick-­fire delivery with images of a donkey (a ‘work animal’) makes the computer-­animated character ‘appear tasteless, offensive, and racist’ (Pimental and Velázquez 2009: 13). The gradual critical turn within film studies towards screen acting has pitched up the volume of the voice in cinema (Smith 2008; Neumark et al. 2010). Such analysis of vocal performance includes a greater appreciation of inflections of tone, pitch, rhythm, metre, modulation, timbre, delivery and intonation. The computer-­animated film no less resuscitates the voice as a performance element, and Chapter 7 examines how the voice of a screen star speaks with authority by examining vocal performance in relation to elements of character design. The ideological critique of computer-­animated films has tended to focus on the uniformity of ideology and cultural politics within individual texts. By examining the rhetorical devices of The Incredibles, for example, David Hastings Dunn makes the argument that the film ‘begs to be read as an allegorical tale justifying US foreign policy under George W. Bush’ (2006: 559). Close readings of Monsters, Inc. also offer the view that the film is a ‘clever dramatisation of the problem of declining energy supplies’, raising awareness in geographical and environmental research about crafting a ‘future of child-­friendly cities’ in post-­industrial societies (Tranter and Sharpe 2008: 299). Yet studio authorship has also been a convenient way of theorising the narratives, themes, characters and ideological operations across a larger corpus. The Pixar studio’s synonymy with digital animation and their historical contribution to three-­dimensional computer graphics has been the focus of numerous critical accounts that have enforced the studio’s business evolution and corporate relationships with Apple/Steve Jobs and Lucasfilm/George Lucas (Paik 2007; Price 2009; Sito 2013).

The identity of Pixar’s computer-­animated films as ‘cultural, political, and social texts’ (Meinel 2016: 15) has paved the way for extremely rich enquiries into character construction (gender, sexuality). While much of this book deals with the tribulations of characters (as journeyers; as non-­humans; as animators; as actors), Chapter 8 will examine how the physicality, solidity and nuances of personality equipping these digital bodies contribute to the computer-­ animated film’s comic register. Interpersonal relationships are ‘the driving forces’ (Finklea 2017: 89) behind many computer-­animated films, and Chapter 8 discusses how the emotional expressivity within individual characters supports the construction of nuanced models of gender. Many Pixar-­centric studies have permitted the ideological analysis of computer-­animated films to move beyond broader labels of the ‘children’s film’ (Booker 2010; Cheu 2013) and ‘family film’ (King et al. 2010; Brown and Babbington 2015; Brown 2017) to which they are often assigned and explored as a larger animated group. However, a genre ‘by definition entails narrative, iconographic, characterological and conceivably ideological conventions’ (Langford 2005: 265), and one of this book’s lines of enquiry is how computer-­animated films transcode or relay particular ideological positions, attitudes, themes, narratives and values as a wider collection of films. For example, the computer-­animated film’s repeating journey ­narrative – ­discussed at length in Chapter ­2 – ­engages the collective mentality that Judith Halberstam (2011) has identified as part of the ideological ‘audacity’ of recent animated features. These ‘Pixarvolt’ films are characterised by narratives advocating communitarian revolt and rebellion against corporate domination, resulting in improvised social relationships and collective action. Whereas M. Keith Booker has argued set’ that children’s films consistently promote an ‘individualist mind-­ (2010: 175) in keeping with an American capitalist system, ‘Pixarvolt’ films signify an alternate ideological message. For Halberstam, Robots, Finding Nemo, Over the Hedge (Tim Johnson and Karey Kirkpatrick, 2006) and Bee Movie address the unruly child through queer embodiment, the dual rejection of the family and coupled romance, and instead enforce collective states of rebellion (therefore challenging any neo-­liberal ‘be yourself ’ attitude) (Halberstam 2011: 29).2 Beyond their contribution to the journey narrative structure, the visual pleasure and spatial dimension of these rebellious, revolting collectives will be investigated in Chapter 3 according to the computer-­animated Not for distribution or resale.

The swarms, crowds or ‘digital multitude’, as Kristen Whissel (2014) terms it, which populate computer-­ animated film worlds have generally been discussed for their ideological implications for de-­individualisation of mass society. Florentine Strzelczyk (2008) connects the insect colony in Antz to a pre-­fascist Weimar Republic; Steven C. Combs (2002) compares Antz with A Bug’s Life according to Daoist (Taoist) thought; and Christopher Falzon (2007) observes the social and political dimension of Antz and its reflection of a modern totalitarian existence. But Chapter 3 explores the properties of the digital multitude as a dynamic optical effect that illuminates the scope and expanse of the fictional space. However, the very formation of activist groups bound by communal activity across computer-­animated film narratives ultimately mirrors Halberstam’s own desire to ‘think collectively’ about them. By broadening the critical conversation around computer-­ animated films via ‘ideological-­generic criticism’ (Klinger 1984: 30–44), Halberstam maps their complex formal geography and textual system through the cinema/ideology relation. The grounding of ideology within generic textuality enables the computer-­animated film to be studied for their orthodoxies and conventions, viewed relationally rather than in isolation. However, to carry out the ideological critique of a computer-­ animated film, and their inscription of cultural images, practices, attitudes and discourses, is to analyse the richness and density of meanings contained within its complex textual strategies.\n\nFrom Technicist to Textualism Invested in the politics of representation, the wealth of ideological criticism directed at the computer-­animated film bears out something of the emergent textualist approach that has come to replace the instrumentalist or ‘technicist’ approach to digital imaging, which Darley (1990) identified at the very start of the 1990s as the dominant mode of thinking. Towards the end of computer-­animation’s second decade, Maureen Furniss admitted that the majority of books written on the subject ‘focus on techniques, providing instructions on how to use various software packages’ (1999). Long-­ running visual effects journals and popular magazines including WIRED, Cinefex and Cinefantastique continue to prize computer-­ animated films in these ‘technicist’ terms, adopting and extending the informative, highly technical tone of industry-­based papers routinely presented at annual events in the computer graphics calendar (Street 1998).

Textualist approaches to film analysis are traditionally formalist, shifting focus onto a film’s textual attributes and formal codes: its conventions, systems of organisation, norms and modes, and their effect on the spectator. Such approaches have a different emphasis than ideological criticism. They are less inclined towards the analysis of the socio-­political and historical forces shaping the text and, as Garrett Stewart argues, are ‘committed to more cinematographic specificity than one finds in the ideological critique of the apparatus per se’ (1999: 319). With a greater accent placed on form and convention, textualist approaches have opened the valve on the study of computer-­animated films, leading to a new emphasis on their formal vocabulary. Notable among such accounts is a more nuanced consideration of sound design, musical composition and melody (Wells 2009a; Hayward 2010; Whittington 2012; Goldmark 2013), and the deft contribution of unified sound-­image relations within animated storytelling (although such accounts have tended to overwhelmingly focus on Pixar’s short film format). Textualist accounts have also advanced the knowledge and appreciation of the self-­reflexive narrativisation by computer-­animated films of realism (as Telotte, Elsaesser and Hagener all describe), but in some instances evaluation. Aylish Wood has argued has been instrumental in its re-­ that computer-­animated films are not wholly powered by discourses of ‘encroaching realism’, but by the textual inscription of their technology (2007: 25). No longer attributable to the kinds of reality effects described by Darley and Moszkowicz, computer-­animated films such as Monsters, Inc. and The Incredibles momentarily convey their aesthetic specificity as computer-animation through scale, vicarious camerawork and depth of space. Textualist approaches ultimately promote the difference and, most animated films, guiding importantly, the differentiation of computer-­ an understanding of their specificity within the multifarious field of ­animation – ­with its multiple forms and ­techniques – ­but also among critical discussions of contemporary digital culture. In reframing computer-­ animated films as a film genre, such texts begin to acquire relative distance and autonomy from the ‘techno-­genre’ (Manovich 2001: 207) into which they were born, and from which they might otherwise never escape.3 With their emphasis on a film’s formal properties, purely textualist approaches have been questioned on the grounds that they are markedly ahistorical and unreflective of cinema as a social practice. However, textualist approaches need not be at odds with a parallel consideration Not for distribution or resale.

Mark Allen Peterson argues that ‘Although the formal features of ­ texts – ­ binary oppositions, tropes, intertextualities, and so ­forth – ­cannot in themselves validate particular meanings, the close reading of texts is likely to remain significant to the anthropology of media. Texts do have formal features’ (2005: 119). Chapter 1 plots the textualist trajectory for subsequent chapters by asking similar questions in relation to film genre. Drawing on relevant genre theory, the opening chapter argues for the computer-­animated film’s formal codes of signification as historically and technologically contingent, informed at every turn by a host of animated and non-­animated texts, but also by key developments in digital technology. This book argues that the generic identity of computer-­animated films emerges from the analysis of their shared formal features, and of the relationships between such elements. Qualities that seem incidental in a single computer-­animated film take on greater meaning when connected to or allied with the consistency and repeating presence of these characteristics in other films. This book explores how over 200 computer-­animated films have crafted a specific set of expectations through the deployment of consistent, repeating textual features. To recall Damon Knight’s widely repeated definition of the slippery genre of science fiction, computer-­animated films ‘mean what we point to when we say it’ (1967: 1). By employing a genre-­based approach to these lively forms of feature-­length narrative fiction, this book brings into sharper clarity what it is we talk about when we talk about computer-animated films, but also why it matters that they are discussed in such genre-­based terms. Genre is a methodology that allows this book to develop new terms of critical evaluation for a popular and rapidly accelerating cinematic form, one whose style, form and function has not yet been addressed with such breadth and scope in existing academic discourse.\n\nNotes 1. As Screen International put it, ‘Much has been made this year of the seeming over-­saturation of studios/computer-­generated titles, with critics and analysts pointing to growing movie-­goer apathy’ (Bordwell and Thompson 2011: 159). 2. By collapsing the live-­action/CG film Babe (Chris Noonan, 1995) and the claymation Chicken Run into the ‘Pixarvolt’ genre, Halberstam implies that such ‘Pixarvolt’ films need not necessarily be computer-­animated. 3.

The Computer-Animated Film and Genre\n\nPeople think of animation only doing things where people are dancing around and doing a lot of histrionics, but animation is not a genre. And people keep saying, ‘The animation genre.’ It’s not a genre! A Western is a genre! Animation is an art form, and it can do any genre. You know, it can do a detective film, a cowboy film, a horror film, an R-­rated film, or a kids’ fairytale. [. . .] And next time I hear, ‘What’s it like working in the animation genre?’ I’m going to punch that person! (Brad Bird in Weaver 2013: 231)\n\nWithin the discipline of film studies, genre theory has yet to identify the computer-­animated film as a significant mainstream genre of contemporary cinema. Despite claims made by Steve Neale at the turn of the new millennium that connections between genre and contemporary Hollywood cinema were being revived and very much ‘in vogue’ (2002: 1), the genre status of computer-­animated films has been far from secured. Such an omission is particularly puzzling given the resituating of genre back on film theory’s critical agenda after a ‘lengthy period of neglect’ (ibid.), and how its return within recent film criticism was intended to address those emerging cycles and trends now operating within contemporary Hollywood. Such a statement of scholarly purpose might have been expected to include computer-­animated films, given the shifting industrial context of studio animation, the popular chord struck with critics and audiences by computer-­animated feature films, and the acceleration of academic interest surrounding the animated medium more generally. Timothy Corrigan has, for example, summarised the first decade of the new millennium as one that exhibited an overwhelming ‘fascination with animation’ (2012: 14–15), an attraction fuelled by the wedding together of traditional animated practices with digital technologies in the immediate post-­millenial period. This chapter identifies the ways in which the shifting, contradictory relationship between animation and genre has impinged upon the delineation of computer-­animated films as a genre in their own right. It also Not for distribution or resale.

Just as the process of defining a genre as opposed to a mode, cycle, series or formula has been wrought with difficulty and contradiction, there is much contention and conflict over whether genre remains a suitable descriptor for animated films. Such questions hinge upon whether animation itself is qualified as a medium, or whether it is better described as a style or technique. Daniel Goldmark has argued that ‘animation is not a genre; it is a technological process that creates a particular (highly idiosyncratic) means of visual representation’ (2005: 3). However, this is certainly not the view held by every genre theorist seeking to place animation in the throes of generic classification (for example, the ‘cartoon’ appears among the ‘new sites’ for genre study offered by Neale [2000: 31]). This book stakes its claim that animation is not a genre, but an expressive medium involving particular kinds of image-­ making techniques. Yet given how animation comes in multiple styles and forms, and is achieved through diverse techniques and practices, computer-­animated films can be considered a specific genre of animation, and of contemporary popular cinema more broadly. However, this chapter begins by unpacking the function of genre in light of the computer-­animated film, and examines how the application of generic structures to their narratives has tended to enforce director Brad Bird’s view regarding animation’s correspondence with, and ability to ‘do’, recognisable live-­action genres.\n\nGenre/Parody/Intertextuality Submitting computer-­animated films to an iconographic treatment of ­genre – ­an approach widely used in late 1960s and early 1970s genre criticism (Kitses 1969; Alloway 1971; McArthur 1972) – involves the recognition of broad motifs, themes, archetypes and plot structures as the basis for shared commonalities. The longevity and durability of this structural approach to genres among contemporary analysis has led to the itemisation of computer-­animated films according to their most obvious generic allegiance, situating their narratives within familiar generic boundaries. M. Keith Booker, for example, has listed the genres into which computer-­ animated films most obviously fit, stating that A Bug’s Life ‘draws in important ways on the gangster genre’, Monsters, Inc. turns to the ‘horror/ monster movie genre’, and that Up is ‘essentially an entry in the adventure film genre’ (2010: 84, 110). While the challenges of post-­classical Hollywood cinema have often been squared to its greater permeability and porosity between genre boundaries (leading to post­modern traditions Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n26\n\nthe co mpute r - a nim a t e d f i l m\n\nof genre-­bending and hybridity), the iconographic analysis of generic affiliation towards the computer-­animated film paradoxically restates the stability of these same boundaries for easy recognition. While the oversimplification of Hollywood’s genre past has prompted a revising of the presumed integrity and fixity of film genres, the qualification of computer-­animated films via pre-­existing genres are not miscalculations made by the genre theorist, or iconographic errors gone unnoticed by the animators. Just as animation has historically demonstrated an overwhelming tendency to take the ‘familiar characteristics of a live-­action genre and place them with the animated context’ (Wells 1998: 171), computer-­animated films no less beg, borrow and steal from the narrative structures and thematic concerns that marshal the parameters of generic meaning. Hotel Transylvania (Genndy Tartakovsky, 2012) and its 2015 sequel shares with Monster House a reliance upon the tropes of the horror film; The Nut Job (Peter Lepeniotis, 2014) and Ozzy: The Great Furscape (Alberto Rodríguez and Nacho La Casa, 2016) draw their inspiration from the drama of the heist film genre; Kung Fu Panda, alongside its two sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 (Jennifer Yuh Nelson, 2011) and Kung Fu Panda 3, push explicitly against the margins of the martial arts film; Monsters vs. Aliens (Conrad Vernon and Rob Letterman, 2009) is DreamWorks’ homage to ‘B’ monster movies such as The Blob (Irvin Yeaworth, 1958), The Fly (Kurt Neumann, 1958) and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman (Nathan H. Juran, 1958); and the studio’s Megamind (Tom McGrath, 2010) and Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (David Soren, 2017) spoof the resurgence in superhero movies (especially the adaptations of Marvel comic books) currently proliferating across ­contemporary US cinema. By treating genres in this way, computer-­ animated films can be understood as foremost examples of genre parody, whereby pre-­existing genres become ‘resuscitated’ in ways that are ‘directly connected to (and constituents of) the genre being spoofed’ (Harries 2002: 281). Animation lies in close proximity to film parody through its potential for extreme moments of ‘inversion’, ‘literalization’ and ‘exaggeration’ that traditionally support parodic activity (ibid.: 7). For Jonathan Gray, animation as a medium ‘greatly increases scope for exaggeration and literalization’ (2006: 67), as parody’s language of the implausible, the impossible and the illogical are well-­served by animation’s ability for subversion, revelation and visualisation. Both parody and animation are thus rhetorically enunciative, insofar as they are equally committed to the weight of ‘the idea’, performing (and defining) that which is being visualised and made intelligible through the image (animation) or the act (parody).

Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Cars 2 (John Lasseter, 2011) revisit two ­genres – ­the disaster and spy ­film – ­that have waxed and waned in significance throughout Hollywood film history, while Sing (Garth Jennings, 2016) capitalises on the recent revival of the jukebox musical format across post-­millennial Hollywood, if not the return of the American film musical more broadly. The generic verisimilitude of Toy Story similarly provides an important basis for considering how the Western genre ‘lives on [. . .] as a permanent part of Hollywood’s generic repertoire available for periodic renewal’ (Langford 2005: 74–5), far from reflecting any decline of interest in the frontier myths of the American West. For Elliot West too, ‘Westerns are in’, thanks to the computer-­animated films Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010) and Rango, a ‘town-­ taming Western’ that features an ‘animated chameleon as sheriff and the familiar comic trope of mistaken identity’ (2012: 290). Gore Verbinski’s first computer-­animated film targets a number of classic Western archetypes and individual spaghetti Westerns from Django (Sergio Corbucci, 1966) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Sergio Leone, 1966) to High Noon (Fred Zinnemann, 1952) and A Fistful of Dollars (Sergio Leone, 1964), as well as including intertextual references to Robert Altman’s neo-­noir Chinatown (1974) and Francis Ford Coppola’s war epic Apocalypse Now (1979). Through their engagement with the familiarity of live-­action genres, computer-­ animated films can be considered one of the most active intertextual fields of contemporary visual culture. As Mikhail Iampolski argues, intertextuality ‘superimposes text on text, meaning on meaning’ (1998: 28), and whether organically embedded or obtrusively signposted, affectionate homage or irreverent parody, computer-­animated films routinely underscore the co-­presence of residual and implicit film genres through a stockpile of intertextual quotations. When counting the numerous film references, allusions and intertextual citations in Antz, for example, Martin Barker admits that ‘there are probably more than I spotted’ (Barker and Austin 2000: 78). Computer-­animated films ask to be worked out and worked through according to their strong dialogical engagement with recognisable genre components, participating in the invitation, promotion and orientation of the spectator as connoisseur. As both a pluralistic viewing strategy and formal set of principles, then, parody is ‘a specific mode of intertextuality that capitalizes on its ironic play between texts’ (Harries 2000: 24), and it is this interminable quality of citing and Not for distribution or resale.

Despite visual allusions to both Jaws (Steven Spielberg, 1975) and Titanic (James Cameron, 1997), it is the gangster film of early 1930s Hollywood as defined largely through the Warner Brothers ­studio – ­including Little Caesar (Mervyn LeRoy, 1931) and The Public Enemy (William A. Wellman, 1931) – that provides Shark Tale with its set of stable narrative and character archetypes. The film recasts the image of the mob family as an unlawful unit of sharks, pufferfish and octopi, who live as a subaquatic syndicate (or ‘food chain’) in a series of lavish coral milieu. Shark Tale is certainly persistent in exploiting the ‘fish-­eat-­fish world’ of underwater organised crime, where kidnapping is ‘just business’ but where ‘coldblooded’ refers simply to the shark’s biological make-­up and ‘swimming with the fishes’ is literalised by the narrative’s sunken ecology. The casting of actors Robert De Niro (as Don Edward Lino), Michael Imperioli (as Frankie Lino) and Vincent Pastore (as Luca) in Shark Tale explicitly trades on the ethnic stereotype of Italian-­American masculinity central to the thirties’ gangster film that shaped Hollywood’s mafia and mobster mythology. The Italian-­American gangster was, for Peter Bondanella, a ‘model for the new urban, Prohibition-­era gangster obviously modelled on Al Capone’ (2006: 183). The ‘link between criminality and Italian heritage’ (ibid.: 173) was further canonised in the iconicity of The Godfather (1972–90) trilogy, and by Martin Scorsese’s multiple mobster films of the 1970s. Not only has De Niro been central to the gangster cinema of post-­classical Hollywood, but both Imperioli and Pastore starred in television programme The Sopranos (David Chase, 1999–2007), a mob drama about New Jersey-­based Italian-­American crime family. Scorsese himself also voices the character of loan shark Sykes in the DreamWorks film. Shark Tale has attracted criticism for its discourse of ‘racialized anthropomorphism’ as a consequence of its ethnic caricaturing of ‘New York Italians’, replete with rituals such as a ‘Catholic burial, performed in Latin’, as a way of defining a particular form of white American masculinity (King et al. 2010: 41). But the film’s persistent dialogue with the cinematic history of gangsters bears out the transformative possibilities of Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n­\n\nf al l ing with s tyle ? 29\n\nanimation within the context of genre parody. Shark Tale shows animation to be an oppositional medium, one entirely appropriate to parody’s fundamental attitudes of affectionate admiration and aggressive disregard, which in turn allows the film to get close to (but remain fully distant from) its target text. Gray argues that when scenarios, characters and dialogue as we might know them to be in their primary context are ‘turned into a cartoon’ they are suddenly seen through ‘fresh eyes’ (2006: 66). Animation is able to afford ‘a second level of aesthetic comparison and contrast’ (Dunne 2001: 147) through its distinct visual language, which is inherent to the medium’s inventive re-­appropriations. Shark Tale’s treatment of the gangster genre is therefore one of a presence-­absence. The film is entirely creative in revealing its own connections to the Mafia through its degrees of genre literacy, which allows and invites its narrative to be understood through its density of allusions.\n\nCase Study: Hoodwinked The visual language and shorthand of familiar genres have certainly been gifts for the expressive scope given to animators as they rework and dismantle generic expectation in a multitude of imaginative ways. The Red Riding Hood adaptation Hoodwinked (Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards and Tony Leech, 2005) produced by the Kanbar Animation studios re-­tells Charles Perrault’s fairy tale through a contemporaneous detective story that utilises an unusually fragmented, divergent narrative style. Hoodwinked not only recollects the shifting chronology of both film noir and ‘hard-­boiled’ crime cinema (like Shark Tale), but borrows the complex storytelling techniques of 1990s and 2000s Hollywood cinema that rejects classical lines of causality. In its non-­ chronological and repeating organisation of fairy-­tale story material, Hoodwinked bears the imprint of what has been variously termed the ‘forking path’ narrative (Bordwell 2002), the ‘multiple-­draft’ film (Branigan 2002), the ‘database narrative’ (Kinder 2002), ‘slipstream fiction’ (Hayles and Gessler 2004), the ‘complex’ narrative (Staiger 2006), the ‘modular narrative’ (Cameron 2008) and the hyphenated ‘mind-­game film’ (Elsaesser 2009) as underlying patterns of storytelling in recent cinema. To varying degrees, these complementary labels and their claims to address forms of convoluted narration across a multitude of national contexts can be subsumed under the umbrella of the ‘puzzle film’ (Buckland 2014). For Warren Buckland, the puzzle film involves ‘fragmented spatiotemporal reality; time loops; a blurring of the boundaries of different levels of reality; unstable characters with split identities or memory loss; Not for distribution or resale.

Hoodwinked’s clever organisation and complex shifting chronology, as well as the exclusive lines of action and ‘switchpoints’ that envisage each possible future of Red Riding Hood ‘seriatim’ (Bordwell 2002), are used to craft a labyrinthine, multi-­version account of Perrault’s folk tale. As investigating Detective Nicky Flippers admits, ‘We’ve got four suspects, and that means four stories’. In telling and then re-­telling the fairy-­tale events in a non-­linear fashion, and using a plethora of narrative voices (Red, the Wolf, Granny Puckett, and the Woodsman), Hoodwinked expresses a sophisticated narrative complexity and intricate weaving together of plotlines, which manipulates the fairy-­tale genre through its convergence with the narrative logic of post-­classical (largely Hollywood) cinema and its multiplicity of unreliable narrators (Figure 1.1).\n\nThe Limits of Genre Beyond supporting a critical appreciation of the computer-­ animated film’s parodic activity towards genres, an iconographic synopsis towards a possible generic affiliation certainly proves useful for the consumer contexts in which film genres operate. To help spectators navigate through cinema’s dense genre jungle, broadcast schedules, marketing strategies, VHS, DVD and Blu-­Ray rental facilities, library catalogues and online shopping outlets are predicated on generic shorthand that clusters together specific films to provide easily identifiable signifiers. It is perhaps, therefore, useful to know that computer-­animated films such as Kaena: The Prophecy (Chris Delaporte and Pascal Pinon, 2003), Ark (Kenny Hwang, 2005), Battle for Terra, Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Dave Filoni, 2008), Space Chimps (Kirk DeMicco, 2008), Space Dogs (Inna Evlannikova and Svyatoslav Ushakov, 2010), Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back (John H. Williams, 2010), Mars Needs Moms (Simon Wells, 2011), Escape From Planet Earth (Cal Brunker, 2013), and Space Dogs: Adventure to the Moon (Mike Disa, 2016) all demonstrate a visible alliance to science fiction storytelling. Their replaying of recognisable iconography situates them within a different iconographic realm to that of the wartime-­comedy Valiant (Gary Chapman, 2005); the Frankensteinian hunchbacked horror of Igor; or the sports underdog narrative of Mexican computer-­animated film A Rooster With Many Eggs (Gabriel Riva Palacio Alatriste and Rodolfo Riva Palacio Alatriste, 2015). But while fixed genre clusters may provide an ‘easily sharable and consistently applicable vocabulary’ (Altman 1999: 89) to their narratives and character archetypes, computer-­animated films have modified the rules of the generic game.

Rio (Carlos Saldanha, 2011) is a part-­musical, part-­love story set in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro; Wall-E combines comedy, drama and romance with science fiction; and The Incredibles melds a family drama with superheroism. Even Toy Story 2 (John Lasseter, 1999) shifts the Western parameters of its predecessor, and is a film instead identified by Harries as a science fiction parody (2002: 281) alongside Galaxy Quest (Dean Parisot, 1999), which also stars US television star Tim Allen (the voice of Buzz Lightyear). Within the context of computer-­animated films, live-­action genres are thus a matter of emphasis and predominance. They are exclusive barometers of occasional, strongly fluctuating, generic identity, rather than inclusive markers that fully secure genre status. Writing in the 1970s, Ed Buscombe suggested that a genre ‘is not a mere collection of dead images waiting for a director to animate it, but a tradition with a life of its own’ (1970: 45). This statement rings particularly true in light of computer-­animated films that have been classed as ‘animated’ only when linked to external generic structures.

Certainly, the close association of a single computer-­animated film to a live-­action genre will give rise to a certain set of attributes. But as computer-­animated films manoeuvre intertextually and intersect with the iconography and motifs of already established genres, they simultaneously surrender their own preliminary features. It is these repeating features that can be used to develop the identity of the computer-­animated film as a mainstream genre, one that is constituted by a group of films that are becoming progressively ‘familiar and relatively easy to recognize’ (King 2002a: 119). To conceptualise a computer-­animated film as belonging to a wider computer-­animated film genre shifts animation as a medium beyond processes of live-­action genrification, and instead asks on what terms animation may have genres of its own, and whether such ‘genres’ deviate from those found in live-­action cinema. The approach to the identification of a unique genre typology germane to the animated medium offered by Paul Wells is instead to propose seven ‘generic deep structures’ of animation that reconcile approach and application with the ‘essence of the art’ (2002a: 66). Wells does not cleave animated films from live-­action genres altogether, but determines the impact of their many intersections and involvements with them. Rather than calling attention to the surface or iconographic manifestations of genre, these ‘deep structures’ bring into relief the immediacy of an animated film’s more profound generic content. This approach enables a variety of texts across multiple animated forms (and created through disparate processes such as cel-­animation, stop-­motion, glass and sand animation) to be grouped into generic clusters. The iconography of long-­ standing genres like the Western function as nothing more than a veneer ‘hollowed out’ by cartoonal form, crafting a conceptual space into which the real generic meanings ‘germane to the animated form’ are inserted (ibid.: 46). Such a focus on the ingenuity of process, and the particularity of animation’s virtues as an artistic practice, opens up the possibility of talking about generic outcomes in the computer-­animated film in an altogether different way. Toy Story can, for example, be examined beyond the economy of expression afforded by its Western icons (saloon, outlaw, cattle yard, heroic cowboy), and instead understood as part of a wider project to catch the spectator up in the film’s own effects of illusion. Thomas Elsaesser and Malte Hagener argue that the ‘classic movie situation’ (2010: 170) of the Western frontier dramatises the shift from traditional chemical photographic process to post-­photographic digital animation. The confrontation of Sheriff Woody and a gunslinging villain One-­Eyed Not for distribution or resale.

A ‘double reality’ is crafted whereby the staging of the Western mini-­narrative showcases creative human agency that eventually recedes within computer processing: a new frontier emerging from ‘drawing hand to generated pixel’ (ibid.). J. P. Telotte similarly suggests that the ‘artlessly constructed’ cardboard sets denoting the dependable, culturally recognised Western icons actually signals a self-­conscious ‘surface play’ concerning the new illusionary achievements of computer-­animated film worlds (2010: 205). Toy Story’s familiarity with the Western partakes in a game of illusion or joke of expectation regarding constructed realities, with its narrative knowingly in dialogue with the complex three-­dimens"
