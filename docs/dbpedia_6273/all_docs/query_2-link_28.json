        "text": "As the third film in Ti West’s X trilogy, MaXXXine is not as strong in the horror genre as his previous two films. In fact, each entry seems to be of its own period; X being a homage to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with its 70’s look and feel, while Pearl managed to be a throwback to the golden age of Hollywood. MaXXXine, set in the 80’s, replicates the style of noir crime-thrillers one could have watched on video in that era, as it features a no-nonsense femme fatale striving to reach the top while avoiding the lurkings of a mysterious stranger with a knack for leaving a trail of blood as he taunts our heroine. This shift in genre and tone is what made me wonder what West had up his sleeve since the tease appeared after Pearl‘s release.\n\nOf course, I never really expected much going for MaXXXine to begin with, other than it being a continuation of X and the aftermath of the murders that took place on the farm where adult film actress, Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) and her crew set out to make their movie, with her being the only survivor. Cut to 1985, where Maxine is trying to make it big in Hollywood, auditioning for a sequel to horror movie, The Puritan, starring scream queen Molly Bennett (Lily Collins), and directed by Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). In the first few minutes, Goth shows us yet again what she is capable of through a reading of the script for The Puritan II, showing capable emotion. Though it is hard to beat the uncut six-minute monologue she professed in Pearl, we know that we are ready for Goth to reach the heights of scream queen. It sure is enough for her to nail the audition where she claims to her gay video store employee friend, Leon (Moses Sumney) that she is the fifth actress to break into the horror scene (“Maxine F*cking Minx!”).\n\nOff the set, however, a different type of horror approaches as a mysterious serial killer known as The Night Stalker prowls through the streets of Hollywood, leaving a Satanic mark upon his victims and clues for Maxine, hinting at a personal connection.\n\nWhile MaXXXine may not have much horror as both X and Pearl did, one thing it manages to convey is the cold and dark era of the 80’s. Sure, it may have been a rockin’ and cheesily fashionable decade, but it wasn’t without its own tragedies and scandals. Mainly, MaXXXine brings to light the Satanic Panic that has been clouding through the era, with rock music, D&D, and even horror movies dubbed by parents and Conservative Christian groups as being “of the Devil”. It is a commentary that is sure to be given some props, even when done in the most ridiculous manner. Though the weakness comes in the story that carries its thoughts and feelings. On top of Maxine preparing for her big break, we are treated to her being stopped by Michelle Monaghan and Bobby Cannavale’s bickering detective duo, Williams and Torres as they pry her on her knowledge of The Night Stalker, or even trying to avoid Kevin Bacon’s sleazy private detective, John Labat, as he tries to dig up her past in a scenery-chewing performance. Most of the cast doesn’t really get enough screen time to shine and are just there for brief appearances, including Halsey’s Tabby Martin and Giancarlo Esposito’s Teddy Knight, Esq.\n\nIt is also debatable whether MaXXXine is a true horror film as it feels like a completely different movie, despite being a part of a horror trilogy. It mainly feels like West wanted to make a third outing to close the franchise, but couldn’t quite think about how to make it work as a horror sequel. Pearl may have felt unnecessary, but in a way, it worked to benefit the viewing of X. MaXXXine is just the final course of a meal that was bloody. But for what it is, MaXXXine still serves as a fitting ending to West’s trilogy and I don’t regret having caught it.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nNine years after the first Inside Out, we go back inside Riley’s head in it’s long-anticipated sequel, Inside Out 2, only Riley is now a teenager going through the trials of puberty and dealing with brand new emotions. The thing about Inside Out is that it was a truly special film in the Pixar canon. What could have been another animated family feature with cute characters ended up becoming a lot deeper than we imagined, proving that Pixar works best when they turn ideas into clever and meaningful films. Their formula is what made most of their work successful, with Toy Story being their biggest franchise. Lately, Pixar’s track record has been lacking in terms of quality. What was once an animation studio that could do no wrong in terms of animation has churned out films with bright animation, but little imagination. Inside Out 2, however, is an installment that had the potential to be an imaginative and clever film that is just as good as its predecessor, if not better. Who needs more adventures with Woody and Buzz Lightyear when we can spend time with emotions that live in Riley’s head. The possibilities are endless with an Inside Out sequel.\n\nOn top of Riley Anderson (Voice of Kensington Tallman) being a teenager, the emotions, Joy (Voice of Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voice of Phyllis Smith), Fear (Voice of Tony Hale replacing Bill Hader), Disgust (Voice of Liza Lapira, replacing Mindy Kaling), and Anger (Voice of Lewis Black) are dealing with changes in Headquarters (the place in Riley’s head), when their console that controls Riley’s behavior gets an upgrade, and a slew of emotions; Anxiety (Voice of Maya Hawke), Envy (Voice of Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Voice of Adele Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Voice of Paul Walter Hauser), move in and try to take over while helping Riley navigate hockey camp, where she tries to fit in with the cool kids there.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether Inside Out 2 is just as good as its predecessor, I can guarantee that it unsurprisingly has the same amount of clever ideas that not only kids can enjoy, but also proves relatable to adults who went through those teenage years, leading to a lot of funny jokes. The one thing I felt Inside Out 2 was missing was more emotional heft, ironically enough. Sure, Inside Out 2 deals with resonantly serious themes relating to the teenage experience, and can make you feel something by the end of it, but what made Inside Out great was not just the ideas it had, but with how heavy its themes on growing up were, which packed that emotional punch, and made many an audience member cry. Upon re-watching Inside Out this past week to show my oldest son this film, I felt more of that emotional pull as it went through those dark and serious moments. Inside Out 2 tries to do more of the same, but the stakes don’t feel quite as high, nor is the devastation truly there.\n\nWhat Inside Out 2 succeeds at is being a clever film that puts more ideas to work in a way for families to take something out of it. I even found it to be quite a good film. The characters are likable enough and the adventure is still fun. As expected, Inside Out 2 is a start for Pixar’s return at quality, even if it doesn’t feel as great as its predecessor.\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nContinue reading “Inside Out 2 – Film Review” →\n\nIn 1988, a little movie called Who Framed Roger Rabbit broke ground with its combination of live-action and animation. Even if it wasn’t the first film to do so, Roger Rabbit did it in such a way to where you believed that actors were really working with cartoon characters (a dream come true for any animation-loving kid). It, in turn, inspired a few other films to try that same form of magic. But out of all the hybrids that came after Roger Rabbit, one film managed to be overlooked where it ended up in a pile of forgotten films, and that film is The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Based on the Jay Ward cartoon, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. I didn’t really grow up with the cartoon much, but I had a VHS of it as a kid, so I have a little knowledge of the characters. Yet from what I understand of the show itself, it was sort of like a sketch series for kids, starring a flying squirrel named Rocky, and his dimwitted moose friend named Bullwinkle as they go on a series of wacky adventures with criminal masterminds, Boris and Natasha trying to outwit them. The show also included other characters such as Mr. Peabody and Sherman, a dog and boy duo who travel through different periods of time as they teach history in a parodical way, and a Canadian Mountie named Dudley Do-Right as he tries to stop the dastardly Snidley Whiplash and his crimes. It lasted 163 episodes and got cancelled in 1964, where it made a living off of re-runs.\n\nIt all seemed to fade into obscurity over the years, except to those who fondly remember the cartoon. So having a movie should be a good way to bring a long-forgotten comedy duo into the modern world for a chance to appeal to a new generation of kids, right? Well, apparently, it didn’t work as the film not only failed to impress critics, but it also ended up alienating audiences. It could be stated that the films’ failure was due to its dated humor, or lack of interest for those who were too old to appreciate the cartoon, and those young enough not to be familiar with it. Whatever the case may be, not much is said about the film, other than it being a joke. In the years since, I have noticed more appreciation for The Adventures of Rocky And Bullwinkle among critics who knew the source material well enough to appreciate its cheap gags and badly-written humor (Even Roger Ebert praised it for staying true to the original cartoon, and ended up being one of the few critics who actually liked it). I even watched it enough times as a kid on VHS, but I also was disappointed in its approach on adapting the original cartoon to the big screen; I didn’t appreciate how meta it was. As an adult knowing all this, I find myself mixed on how to feel about it. Is it terrible? Is it clever? What kind of merit does it even have? Revisiting it last night, I still don’t know how to feel about it. But maybe there is something to truly appreciate about it.\n\nThe movie takes place during the aftermath of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, when we learn during a brief history of 1964 and its significant events, that despite having a good run, that it was cancelled. This has caused a problem in the cartoon world, as it isn’t thriving like it used to be. Frostbite Falls has become a wasteland where the trees have stopped growing. Rocky has gone through a hopeless depression, losing the spunk to fly, while Bullwinkle is still as dimwitted as ever; both living off residual checks due to reruns. While Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov, and Natasha Fatale are losing any hope of conquer. Even the show’s narrator (Voice of Keith Scott) is living at his mother’s house, where he is reduced to narrating her every day life. It isn’t until the three villains find a way to a TV station in Hollywood where executive producer, Minnie Mogul (Janeane Garofalo) is rifling through scripts, in which the plot kicks off, as they trick Mogul into signing a contract to greenlight a Rocky and Bullwinkle movie, bringing them into the real world, where they are portrayed by actors Robert De Niro (Fearless Leader), Jason Alexander (Boris), and Rene Russo (Natasha) as they set out to control the world with a TV station which they call RBTV (Really Bad TeleVision) in order to turn everyone into zombies (A supposed comment on the world’s consumption of mindless programming).\n\nAfter learning of Fearless Leader’s plan, FBI director Cappy Von Trapment (Randy Quaid) recruits young agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to take down all three villains in the only way possible, by bringing moose and squirrel into the real world via movie magic by the literal green light of Hollywood. (Though they are in CG form, but voice performances retained by Keith Scott and June Foray) on a road trip/fantasy adventure to stop the Pottsylvanians from reaching world domination, with Boris and Natasha hellbent on taking down moose and squirrel permanently. What follows are a gaggle of puns, constant fourth wall breaks, and even a few celebrity cameos for good measure.\n\nHow does one fully grasp The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle without understanding its source material? As a movie, I see why it didn’t work as the film constantly goes joke after joke with no sense of stopping, making its efforts at comedy extremely tiring, and that would be enough for a modern audience at the time to handle, but there is also an ambition to its commitment of horrible gags and weak humor that it comes off as nearly admirable, with its jokes even being hilarious over time. The casting of De Niro, Alexander, and Russo is perfect. Many wonder why they stooped so low and took these roles, with money rumored to be the reason, but I think they play their parts well. While seeing Rocky and Bullwinkle exit their world being fish out of water as they try to navigate a world that has changed since they have been on TV, while bantering the whole way is interesting to say the least.\n\nThe question of whether The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is terrible or secretly clever is a baffling one to answer. But the real question is: Does it matter? In my opinion, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle lives in its own world where stupidity knows no limit. In the world of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, every cheap gag and horrible sense of humor defies logic and ensures that there are no bounds to be constricted by. So while The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle may be terrible in a traditional sense. Its ability to exist on its own wavelength and wearing its lack of logic on its sleeve makes me love it that much. It’s not Who Framed Roger Rabbit good, nor is it The Room bad. The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is just what it is; its own planet where the criteria doesn’t apply\n\nContinue reading “A Look Back at The Adventures of Rocky And Bullwinkle – Terrible Comedy or Misunderstood Flop?” →"
