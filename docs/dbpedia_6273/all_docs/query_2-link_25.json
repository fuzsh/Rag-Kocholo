An examination of classical Hollywood cinema, this course will concentrate on the period from the 1920s to the 1960s. We will look at the production and distribution practices of the Hollywood studio system, and pay special attention to the way this preeminent form of cinema established many of the norms of the immersive film experience. Among other subjects, we will consider the construction of classical continuity by studying the narrative structures and devices, stylistic techniques, and approaches to editing of a wide range of exemplary films. Weekly in-class screenings, with separate discussion.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H1\n\nTo find other courses that fulfill this and other categories, please check also the 5-Colleges Course Catalogue in Film Studies https://www.fivecolleges.edu/academics/courses/film\n\ntop\n\nFilm course after 1950s (H2)\n\nCOMP-LIT 337 - International History of Animation\n\nInstructor: Christopher Couch\n\n4 Credits\n\nThis course traces the history of animation from the late 19th century to today, including short and feature-length films from the United States, Europe and Japan.

Trying to determine if film is the most resolutely modern of them media, we’ll look at cinema as the result of two obsessive concerns 1.) The poetic, dreamlike and fantastic 2.) The factual, realistic and socially critical or anarchistic. Thus, we’ll attempt to discover how modern culture deals with avant-garde imperatives to always “make it new.” Films and filmmakers such as Breathless (Godard), My Own Private Idaho (Van Sant), The American Soldier (Fassbinder), others.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H2\n\nCOMP-LIT 383 - Narrative Avant-Garde Film (Gen.Ed.

The nature and characteristics of, as well as the relationships connecting and distinguishing, modernist cinema, art cinema, and avant-garde film during this vital period in film history will be the course’s primary concern. We will examine the notion of the auteur and consider its usefulness for thinking about this multiform, innovative cinema. What is the relationship between cinematic modernism and the core principles and representational strategies of modern art? Does modern cinema, as Gilles Deleuze suggests, function as a mental substitute for the lost connection between the individual and the world? Can it restore our belief in the world? The course will pay particular attention to distinctive stylistic attributes, but will also look at dominant thematic concerns. There will be weekly in-class screenings as well as regular streaming of films outside of class. The filmmakers we will consider include, but are not limited to: Chantal Ackerman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Theo Angelopoulos, Ingmar Bergman, Stan Brakhage, Robert Bresson, Luis Buñuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard, Peter Greenaway, Werner Herzog, Miklós Janscó, Akira Kurosawa, Kenji Mizoguchi, Yasujiro Ozu, Sergei Paradzhanov, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Alain Resnais, Jean-Marie Straub, Andrei Tarkovsky, François Truffaut, Agnès Varda, Wim Wenders.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: H2\n\nTo find other courses that fulfill this and other categories, please check also the 5-Colleges Course Catalogue in Film Studies https://www.fivecolleges.edu/academics/courses/film\n\ntop\n\nDirector or Genre course (D&G)\n\nCOMM 444 - Film Styles and Genres\n\nInstructor: Shawn Shimpach\n\n3 Credits\n\nWhy do we put certain films into categories? What constitutes a film genre, how do we recognize it, and what do we do with it? This course examines these questions and more by considering a specific genre over the course of the semester. We will learn to think of genre as a way of comparing and contrasting different films. Genre will also be thought of as a way of creating expectations and measuring experience and meaning. The power of film genre is that it allows us to understand film as a text and film as a social practice at the very same time.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nCOMM 446: Film Documentary\n\nInstructor: Bruce Geisler\n\n3 credits\n\nWe will view, analyze, and discuss films by modern documentary masters such as Michael Moore (\"Sicko\"), Chris Paine, (\"Revenge of the Electric Car\"), Seth Gordon (\"The King of Kong - A fistful of Quarters\"), Pamela Yates (\"Granito\") and many others to further the understanding of the documentary craft and art from a filmmaker's perspective. Students will also do preproduction (research and treatment) for their own short documentary, along with shorter hands-on exercises in writing narration, interview techniques, etc.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nCOMM 493L - S-Experimental Film & Video\n\nInstructor: Kevin Anderson\n\n3 Credits\n\nPrerequisites: COMM 331, 441, OR 446\n\nNOTE: Open to Seniors and Juniors only\n\nThis course explores the genre of Experimental Film and Video with a critical eye toward the history and current articulations of this form of production in both feature film and short form movies and videos. The course begins with an introduction to the genre, then explores Experimental Film; video according to three different categories: Experimentation with Narrative, Experimentation with Structure/Form, and Experimentation with the line between Fact and Fiction. Students will emerge from this course with a solid foundation in the history and theory of experimental film/video as evidenced by writing projects, research papers, and student-produced experimental media projects.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nCOMM 494BI- Countercultural Films\n\nInstructor: Bruce Geisler\n\nSeminar, Discussion. An exploration of the counter-cultural movements of the 1960s and 70s and later, hosted by someone who was there and lived to tell the tale. Through the medium of documentary and fiction films, we will delve into the musical, sexual, artistic, political and spiritual upheavals that rocked America and Europe back then and that continue to reverberate today.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nCOMP-LIT 350: INTERNATIONAL FILM\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\n4 credits\n\nThis general education course will screen films from across the globe studying examples of a range of lesser-known subgenres of the Horror film, such as Giallo (Italian genre mixing slasher horror with detective mysteries), Fantastique (French genre mixing gothic horror with fantasy erotica), and Jiangshi (Hong Kong genre mixing slasher horror with Kung Fu). And we will consider in equal measure the so-called dystopian film. We will look at the interrelationship connecting these two modes, which can be seen at work in films like Battle Royale. This course will include a primary focus on gender issues, will examine the representation of women, and will screen (transgressive) examples of these modes by women filmmakers. The intention of this course is to expose students to a cultural diversity of these vital contemporary film genres beyond the conventional Hollywood fare. Weekly film screenings and discussion.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nGenEd: AT\n\nCOMPLIT 391SF- International Sci-Fi Cinema\n\nInstructor: Christopher NC Couch\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis course provides an introduction to science fiction cinema from the end of the nineteenth century to today. Beginning with the experiments of the Melies Brothers and the importance of German Expressionist films like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the course considers technological prognostication from Destination Moon to 2001: A Space Odyssey, adventure and science fiction in films like Forbidden Planet and Star Wars, and the dystopian imagination from Invasion of the Body Snatchers to District 9. The course will also highlight the roles of women writers and directors from Thea von Harbou to Kathryn Bigelow, and technological cinematic advances from matte painting and process shots to CGI.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 330: Film Auteurs: Akira Kurosawa\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nCredits 4\n\nThis class will focus on one, or more, specific filmmaker and will aim to highlight their cinematic models, distinctive style and recurrent themes, within the theoretical framework of the \"auteur theory\", thus offering students an introductory and comprehensive view of perhaps the most central concept in film studies. In the first place, this class will address the historical evolution of the debate around \"auteur theory,\" from the \"politique des auteurs\" to the \"death of the author\", while providing author criticism and analysis in practice. It will tackle questions such as: Why do certain filmmakers qualify as auteurs? What is the difference between commercial cinema and auteur cinema? Due to the collaborative nature of filmmaking, can we talk about the author of a film? What is the intersection between gender and authorship? What does it mean to be a woman author? Secondly, it will concentrate on one specific filmmaker: students will read pertinent bibliography (e.g. biography, film reviews, etc.) on their films, watch and study their most significant film production, and contextualize it historically, geographically and culturally.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 391SF- International Sci-Fi Cinema\n\nChristopher NC Couch\n\nThis course provides an introduction to science fiction cinema from the end of the nineteenth century to today.

Scientists say yes, possibly on billions of planets in our galaxy alone. In this class, we will examine the international cinema of alien encounters and explore how these films envision the alien other. How do these films both reflect and shape our own experience of \"the alien\" or the unknown \"other\"? Since the beginning of cinema, the figure of the alien has visited the big screen with its promise of otherworldly wonders and its threat of unthinkable perils. This course will explore how alien encounters reflect the haunting of historical realities (such as European voyages of discovery, conquest, and colonization) as well as contemporary issues, such as international conflict (war or global migration), questions of identity (race, gender, sexuality), and the power and perils of emerging technologies (nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, space travel). Imagining encounters with intelligent beings beyond our own cultural and ideological sphere provides powerful new perspectives on what we think we know about the world, about ourselves, and about others.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 397E: Film at the End of the World\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3\n\nClimate disaster, world war, aliens, cosmic collisions, dystopias, zombies, the rise of the machines, catastrophic pandemics, mass extinction, prophesied apocalypse. What do films about the end of the world tell us about contemporary realities? What insights do they offer into the cultural moment that produces them and the prevailing attitudes and realities of gender, race, class, sexuality, and gender identity? How do they speak to our anxieties and fears about the future as well as our hopes and aspirations? How does the genre of end-of-the-world films intersect with other genres—thriller, action film, neo-noir, comedy, art-house, romance, drama, experimental, historical? In this course we will study the cinema of eschatology, of ultimate endings, and analyze a range of filmic approaches to the philosophical, psychological, social, and aesthetic questions posed in end-of-the-world films.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 497V – Video Essay in Film Criticism\n\nDaniel Pope\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis is a course in planning, scripting, and editing video essays in film criticism, working with films from around the world and across film history. The field of film criticism is taking new forms in recent years, with social media, podcasts, websites and blogs dedicated to analyzing and discussing movies. Out of this trend, the video essay emerges as an exceptionally attractive and powerful medium for the film critic. In this class, we examine a wide array of video essays and explore the unique analytical and expressive opportunities the medium offers. A primary emphasis in the course is the study and practice of film criticism as an intellectual and creative endeavor with its own particular objectives, challenges, and expressive powers. With this foundation, we develop the critical, creative, and technical skills necessary for making effective video essays addressing films, directors, genres, national cinemas, and cultural and social issues. Making a video essay is in many ways like making a movie. As such we are engaged not only in film analysis and film writing but also in video editing, image composition, sound design, and other aspects of moving image media.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nTo find other courses that fulfill this and other categories, please check also the 5-Colleges Course Catalogue in Film Studies https://www.fivecolleges.edu/academics/courses/film\n\ntop\n\nNational cinema course (N)\n\nFILM-ST 304: German Cinema: From Berlin to Hollywood (also: /German 304 )\n\nInstructor: Mariana Ivanova\n\nCredits: 3\n\nThis course offers a survey of German cinema from the 1920s on until the 21st century and focuses on transborder mobility of pictures and artists. We will examine the emigration of film directors from Babelsberg, the epicenter of the ‘Golden Age’ in German cinema to Hollywood. From celebrated directors such as Fritz Lang, Friedrich Murnau, and Ernst Lubitsch, to stars, such as Marlene Dietrich and Peter Lorre, we will trace the careers of those working in exile in the 1930s and 1940s. The course will continue with an exploration of the postwar period and the export of West German films into the US, while we look at the work of directors Wim Wenders, Volker Schlöndorff, Margarete von Trotta and Harun Farocki who also significantly shaped the perception of North America in Germany. We will conclude with discussions of more recent works by Tom Tykwer and Michael Hanneke, well-known among cineastes today for their international coproductions, Hollywood remakes, or Netflix series. Key issues in the course will be the transformation of film financing and material production circumstances as a result of European funding structures and a persistent ‘transnational aesthetic’ emerging in the work of the above directors. Both big budget blockbusters and independent films will be considered in their implications for film content, style, and social content. Conducted in English.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR IN BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 344: Film and Society in Israel (Also available as JUDAIC 344)\n\nInstructor: Olga Gershenson\n\nWed 4-6:45\n\nThis course uses film to discuss Israeli society.

The course will center on a variety of topics that are vital to the understanding of the most significant political, historical, social and cultural events that have shaped Latin America. Some of the topics to be examined in the class are: racial, gender, sexual and identity issues; nation formation; revolution; immigration; repression; utopia; resistance; violence; freedom and indigenism. Students will be expected to develop interpretative filmic skills through an exploration of the connections between the technical composition of the films and the social, political, and cultural context to which each film refers.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: N\n\nFILM-ST 497L /697FL Fellini- The Liar (Also available as ITALIAN 497FL/ ITALIAN 697FL)\n\n(Also available online)\n\nInstructor: Andrea Malaguti\n\nCredits: 3\n\nTue 4:00-6:30\n\nThe course examines the most important films by Federico Fellini (whose \"La dolce vita\" and \"8 1/2\" both entered the 100 greatest movies list of the British Film Institute) to understand how his work both contends with his contemporaries (especially Hollywood) and still has a strong grip on our film imagery today.

Students should expect to be familiarized with the key ideas and objectives that have inspired and driven that practice since the early 1960s, and be furnished with the technical tools and methodological skills that would permit them to understand, analyze, and think critically about the artistic and thematic aspects of the films that are screened. They should also expect the course to provide them with a critical peek into several cardinal issues of social and cultural relevance in contemporary Africa and its history. Issues of interest typically include, the nation state and its declining status, imperatives of decolonization, economic dependency and structural adjustment programs, orality and changing traditional cultures, diasporic migrations, urbanization and its problems, gender relations, civil wars, child soldiers, gangs, and related themes. Filmmakers studied include, but are not limited to, Abderrahmane Sissako, Gillo Pontecorvo, Ousmane Sembene, Raoul Peck, Jean-Marie Teno, Dani Kouyate, Mweze Ngangura, Gavin Hood, Neill Blomkamp, Moufida Tlatli, Djibril Diop Mambety (please note that this list is subject to change, and shall be updated as future changes are made). The course is conducted in English, and requires no prior knowledge of the field. All films are streamed to your computer from the UMass library on demand. Required readings are provided online, and no book purchases are necessary. (Gen.Ed.

The course seeks to equip students with a command of the diverse history of theoretical frameworks for understanding the medium and experience of cinema, from early concerns over films relation to other arts to the way the movie as a cultural form has been reconceptualized within the contemporary explosion of new media. The pressing relevance of film theory becomes clear once we stop to consider taking just one small example the many implications of a society-wide movement away from the collective experience of movies in a public theater to private viewing with earbuds on the tiny screen of a cell phone or tablet. We will explore a wide range of questions (concerning the nature of the cinematic medium and its apparatus, aspects of the spectator’s experience of film, and the aesthetic and ideological dimensions of film genre, to name just a few) as a way of putting ourselves in dialogue with various film theoreticians. And we will ground our examination by looking at cinematic practice in relation to theory.

And we will consider in equal measure the so-called dystopian film. We will look at the interrelationship connecting these two modes, which can be seen at work in films like Battle Royale. This course will include a primary focus on gender issues, will examine the representation of women, and will screen (transgressive) examples of these modes by women filmmakers. The intention of this course is to expose students to a cultural diversity of these vital contemporary film genres beyond the conventional Hollywood fare.

The course will also highlight the roles of women writers and directors from Thea von Harbou to Kathryn Bigelow, and technological cinematic advances from matte painting and process shots to CGI.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 297SF Special Topics- Possible Futures: Science Fiction in Global Cinemas\n\nInstructor: Kevin Anderson\n\n3 credits\n\nThere are multiple growing concerns regarding issues of climate, class, race, gender identity, and the nature of democracy in our contemporary world. Science fiction has proven to be a thought-provoking genre to help raise awareness to many of these social and environmental issues. This course takes a global perspective on such pressing issues by examining science fiction films from around the world. As such, the course uses science fiction films as primary texts, accompanied by weekly readings. Students will engage in a critical analysis of the assigned films and readings in order to better appreciate what we can begin to anticipate regarding our future.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G (limit one 200 level course)\n\nFILM-ST 330: Film Auteurs: Akira Kurosawa\n\nInstructor: Barry Spence\n\nCredits 4\n\nThis class will focus on one, or more, specific filmmaker and will aim to highlight their cinematic models, distinctive style and recurrent themes, within the theoretical framework of the \"auteur theory\", thus offering students an introductory and comprehensive view of perhaps the most central concept in film studies. In the first place, this class will address the historical evolution of the debate around \"auteur theory,\" from the \"politique des auteurs\" to the \"death of the author\", while providing author criticism and analysis in practice. It will tackle questions such as: Why do certain filmmakers qualify as auteurs? What is the difference between commercial cinema and auteur cinema? Due to the collaborative nature of filmmaking, can we talk about the author of a film? What is the intersection between gender and authorship? What does it mean to be a woman author? Secondly, it will concentrate on one specific filmmaker: students will read pertinent bibliography (e.g. biography, film reviews, etc.) on their films, watch and study their most significant film production, and contextualize it historically, geographically and culturally.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 391SF- International Sci-Fi Cinema\n\nChristopher NC Couch\n\nThis course provides an introduction to science fiction cinema from the end of the nineteenth century to today.

Scientists say yes, possibly on billions of planets in our galaxy alone. In this class, we will examine the international cinema of alien encounters and explore how these films envision the alien other. How do these films both reflect and shape our own experience of \"the alien\" or the unknown \"other\"? Since the beginning of cinema, the figure of the alien has visited the big screen with its promise of otherworldly wonders and its threat of unthinkable perils. This course will explore how alien encounters reflect the haunting of historical realities (such as European voyages of discovery, conquest, and colonization) as well as contemporary issues, such as international conflict (war or global migration), questions of identity (race, gender, sexuality), and the power and perils of emerging technologies (nuclear weapons, artificial intelligence, space travel). Imagining encounters with intelligent beings beyond our own cultural and ideological sphere provides powerful new perspectives on what we think we know about the world, about ourselves, and about others.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 397E: Film at the End of the World\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3\n\nClimate disaster, world war, aliens, cosmic collisions, dystopias, zombies, the rise of the machines, catastrophic pandemics, mass extinction, prophesied apocalypse. What do films about the end of the world tell us about contemporary realities? What insights do they offer into the cultural moment that produces them and the prevailing attitudes and realities of gender, race, class, sexuality, and gender identity? How do they speak to our anxieties and fears about the future as well as our hopes and aspirations? How does the genre of end-of-the-world films intersect with other genres—thriller, action film, neo-noir, comedy, art-house, romance, drama, experimental, historical? In this course we will study the cinema of eschatology, of ultimate endings, and analyze a range of filmic approaches to the philosophical, psychological, social, and aesthetic questions posed in end-of-the-world films.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: III, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G\n\nFILM-ST 304: German Cinema: From Berlin to Hollywood (also: /German 304 )\n\nInstructor: Mariana Ivanova\n\nCredits: 3\n\nThis course offers a survey of German cinema from the 1920s on until the 21st century and focuses on transborder mobility of pictures and artists. We will examine the emigration of film directors from Babelsberg, the epicenter of the ‘Golden Age’ in German cinema to Hollywood. From celebrated directors such as Fritz Lang, Friedrich Murnau, and Ernst Lubitsch, to stars, such as Marlene Dietrich and Peter Lorre, we will trace the careers of those working in exile in the 1930s and 1940s. The course will continue with an exploration of the postwar period and the export of West German films into the US, while we look at the work of directors Wim Wenders, Volker Schlöndorff, Margarete von Trotta and Harun Farocki who also significantly shaped the perception of North America in Germany. We will conclude with discussions of more recent works by Tom Tykwer and Michael Hanneke, well-known among cineastes today for their international coproductions, Hollywood remakes, or Netflix series. Key issues in the course will be the transformation of film financing and material production circumstances as a result of European funding structures and a persistent ‘transnational aesthetic’ emerging in the work of the above directors. Both big budget blockbusters and independent films will be considered in their implications for film content, style, and social content.

Students should expect to be familiarized with the key ideas and objectives that have inspired and driven that practice since the early 1960s, and be furnished with the technical tools and methodological skills that would permit them to understand, analyze, and think critically about the artistic and thematic aspects of the films that are screened. They should also expect the course to provide them with a critical peek into several cardinal issues of social and cultural relevance in contemporary Africa and its history. Issues of interest typically include, the nation state and its declining status, imperatives of decolonization, economic dependency and structural adjustment programs, orality and changing traditional cultures, diasporic migrations, urbanization and its problems, gender relations, civil wars, child soldiers, gangs, and related themes. Filmmakers studied include, but are not limited to, Abderrahmane Sissako, Gillo Pontecorvo, Ousmane Sembene, Raoul Peck, Jean-Marie Teno, Dani Kouyate, Mweze Ngangura, Gavin Hood, Neill Blomkamp, Moufida Tlatli, Djibril Diop Mambety (please note that this list is subject to change, and shall be updated as future changes are made).

We will examine the emigration of film directors from Babelsberg, the epicenter of the ‘Golden Age’ in German cinema to Hollywood. From celebrated directors such as Fritz Lang, Friedrich Murnau, and Ernst Lubitsch, to stars, such as Marlene Dietrich and Peter Lorre, we will trace the careers of those working in exile in the 1930s and 1940s. The course will continue with an exploration of the postwar period and the export of West German films into the US, while we look at the work of directors Wim Wenders, Volker Schlöndorff, Margarete von Trotta and Harun Farocki who also significantly shaped the perception of North America in Germany. We will conclude with discussions of more recent works by Tom Tykwer and Michael Hanneke, well-known among cineastes today for their international coproductions, Hollywood remakes, or Netflix series. Key issues in the course will be the transformation of film financing and material production circumstances as a result of European funding structures and a persistent ‘transnational aesthetic’ emerging in the work of the above directors. Both big budget blockbusters and independent films will be considered in their implications for film content, style, and social content.

The field of film criticism is taking new forms in recent years, with social media, podcasts, websites and blogs dedicated to analyzing and discussing movies. Out of this trend, the video essay emerges as an exceptionally attractive and powerful medium for the film critic. In this class, we examine a wide array of video essays and explore the unique analytical and expressive opportunities the medium offers. A primary emphasis in the course is the study and practice of film criticism as an intellectual and creative endeavor with its own particular objectives, challenges, and expressive powers. With this foundation, we develop the critical, creative, and technical skills necessary for making effective video essays addressing films, directors, genres, national cinemas, and cultural and social issues. Making a video essay is in many ways like making a movie. As such we are engaged not only in film analysis and film writing but also in video editing, image composition, sound design, and other aspects of moving image media.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR THROUGH BDIC CATEGORY: D&G, T\n\nFILM-ST 497P Film Podcasting\n\nInstructor: Daniel Pope\n\nCredits: 3 credits\n\nThis is, above all, a course in film criticism.

The swiftly growing field of audio podcasting offers a versatile new digital medium for film criticism, drawing on many of the strengths of traditional media and bringing its own unique qualities of engagement. In this course, we will study varieties of film writing and explore the craft of creating compelling and illuminating film criticism and the key techniques for producing rich, engaging podcast content. We will work with films across a variety of genres and time periods and do hands-on work in all aspects of producing a film criticism podcast - research, analysis, writing, planning, conducting interviews, moderating, recording, editing, and posting your finished podcasts.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: II, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR IN BDIC CATEGORY: T, E\n\nFILM-ST - 493L – S-Experimental Film & Video\n\nKevin Anderson\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis course explores the genre of Experimental Film and Video with a critical eye toward the history and current articulations of this form of production in both feature film and short form movies; videos.

We will read from an international selection of screenplays, examine clips from unconventional films, and address questions of representation, inclusion, and the work of writing underrepresented characters and untold narratives for the screen. “Untold” signifies in two ways—it can mean boundless or limitless, and it can refer to a narrative that is not recounted. We are witnessing the beginnings of a film and media renaissance, with new works emerging and evolving that tell stories not commonly told and take innovative forms that can surprise, edify, delight, and enrich us. In this class, we will write screenplays for such works, starting with an appreciation for established forms and conventions of screenwriting and pushing to expand the boundaries of what stories films can tell, and how.\n\nUNDERGRADUATE FILM STUDIES CERTIFICATE CATEGORY: IV, V\n\nFILM STUDIES MAJOR IN BDIC CATEGORY: E\n\nFILM-ST 397M: MAKING SHORT FILMS (Offered ONLINE through CPE/UWW)\n\nInstructor: David Casals-Roma\n\nCredits: 3\n\nMaking short films is a step by step course that goes through the basic aspects you need to know in order to make a film. We will start with the preproduction process and how to find engaging stories. You will learn how to break-down scripts, cast actors, find crew, scout locations, prepare budgets, shooting plans, call sheets and other important paperwork. For the production process the course will focus on shooting, blocking, lighting, directing actors, cinematography, sound and other important aspects to be aware of when you are on set. In the postproduction process you will learn the basics of editing images, sound design, music, effects and color correction. Finally, we will analyze the film market and the possibilities that new filmmakers have in the industry. (Important: There will be some practical exercises appointed by the professor. As film equipment is not provided for the class, you will need to have access to a camera)\n\nCertificate Category: V\n\nFILM MAJOR through BDIC requirement: E\n\nFilm-St 397EF - Experiments in Film (Offered ONLINE through CPE/UWW)\n\nInstructor: Christopher Janke\n\nCredits: 3\n\nLet’s Break Some Rules Together: Experiments in Film. Is Christopher Nolan experimental? Richard Linklater? Marjane Satrapi? Abbas Kiarostami? The language of contemporary cinema is made from the bold experiments of the past. Filmmakers like Chris Marker and Maya Deren turned budgetary problems into films that stand the test of time. Adrian Piper’s radical experiments in racial identity: are these films? How would we talk about how they were cast – or about the set? We will look at the risks filmmakers take and why they take them, and we will wonder how they (or we) can know if their risks have paid off. And then we will use our creative resources to turn our own challenges into artistic constraints – into visions where our problems and concerns, our inspirations and quirks, spur us to create the unusual, the unique, and the daring. Come risk and play. Requirements include: short weekly experiments, reflections, risks, and films; watching films; and an independent project. In addition to a computer and internet access, you will need access to a camera that shoots video (a cellphone can work) as well as to video editing software and to a way to transfer between the two.\n\nCertificate Category: V\n\nFILM MAJOR through BDIC requirement: E\n\nFILM-ST 497DF- Short Documentary Filmmaking (Offered ONLINE through CPE/UWW)\n\nInstructor: David Casals Roma\n\nCredits: 3\n\nIn the same way that fiction films are the mirror of our imagination, documentaries are the mirror of our surrounding reality. But making a documentary requires a creative point of view by the director and the knowledge of some filmmaking techniques. In this course you will learn how to develop your ideas for documentary, how to write a script, how to plan de production, how to shoot interviews and how to structure your movie in the editing room. Moreover, you will write, shoot and edit a 5-minute documentary during the course.
