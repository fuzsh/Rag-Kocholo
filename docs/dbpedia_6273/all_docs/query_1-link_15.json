Everyone's favorite moose and squirrel, Rocky and Bullwinkle, are back in an all-new live-action adventure! Those ruthless spies, Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo), have wrangled their way into the real world...while their Fearless Leader (2-time OscarÂ® winner Robert De Niro) is plotting to take over America. Only Rocky and Bullwinkle can save us, but first it's up to squirrel and moose to foil Fearless Leader's scheme to destroy the world! This fun-filled, pun-filled comic adventure picks up where the much-beloved series left off, spoofing television, politics, higher education, the Internet and especially themselves. They prove once again that laughter is ageless, timeless and in Rocky's case, weightless.",

        "text": "It's quite clever and quite cute, in a 10-minute-joke-stretched-into-a-feature kind of way.\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle is directed by Des McAnuff, who presumably took on this chore after the failure of his imaginative, challenging version of Ted Hughes's The Iron Giant [which he produced]. Very sad.\n\nMarch 26, 2024\n\nIn their natural pen and paint environment, Rocky and Bullwinkle shine. But they seem as dull as dishwater, and completely out of place, in a live action world. Hence, their Adventures never connect with viewers.\n\nFebruary 26, 2020\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle's CGI effects recall its antecedent Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and like that film its dialogue is packed with cultural references that will have adults laughing harder than the kids.\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nWhile the movie continually teeters on the brink of abject corniness, it never quite topples off. And it doesn't hurt to have Robert De Niro, Rene Russo and Jason Alexander camping it up as cartoon villains come to life.\n\nJanuary 18, 2018\n\nAll things considered, I got more fun out of the much maligned earlier attempt of bringing characters from the show to film, Boris and Natasha.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
