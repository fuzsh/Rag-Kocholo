        "text": "“First came Seinfeld. Then came the new Ellen DeGeneres show. Do we need yet another pack-of-pals show? And while trying to appeal to Xers, the show doesn’t exactly flatter them by portraying young adults as sex-starved losers.” Can you guess which famous TV sitcom we were referring to when the above appeared in TV GUIDE MAGAZINE’s 1994 Fall Preview issue? Answer: Friends, which is celebrating its 30-year anniversary this September. To be fair, we also called the well-known gang an “attractive bunch.” Though we were skeptical of the NBC pilot, Friends went on to become one of the biggest shows of all time. And it just goes to show that you can’t predict ’em all. But we do think we’ve gotten a lot better at spotting the hits over the last decades.…\n\nSURF’S UP It will be interesting to see if Rescue: HI-Surf on Fox [TV GUIDE MAGAZINE, August 5 cover story] portrays lifeguards unlike other shows, which do not do lifeguards justice. —@goldenstatelifeguards I saw the commercial for Rescue: HI-Surf and it kind of gives me Baywatch vibes. Can’t wait. —Brandon HEART LOVE This was the best season of Hallmark Channel’s When Calls the Heart, and Nathan and Elizabeth’s love story is epic. Both Kevin McGarry and Erin Krakow are amazing performers. Seasons 10 and 11 were earned and so needed for this show after the dark Seasons 8 and 9, where the characters were fighting and not true to themselves. We are now home. —Lillian BINGE ALERT Sad to say, but I just finished Season 2 of the Martin Freeman police drama The…\n\nSource: Nielsen Media Research, week of July 29—August 4, 2024, in millions. Noah’s Spark Sprinter Noah Lyles captured the 100-meter dash in an epic photo finish over Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson, earning the title of world’s fastest man. These Olympics proved to be a juggernaut, with average combined viewership across all NBC platforms (30.6 million watchers per day) jumping 82 percent from Tokyo. Million Dollar Baby Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel (above), the primetime revival of the quiz show was the top-rated non-Olympics program of the night. Season 3’s first four episodes have boosted its ratings by 10 percent compared to Season 2’s total average viewership. Leaps and Bounds The U.S. women’s gymnastics squad (Simone Biles, Jordan Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera) won the team gold, and Biles (right) made Olympic history, becoming the most…\n\nIt’s been just three months since the cancellation of Walker, the CW crime drama starring Jared Padalecki (right), but the actor will soon be setting the small screen ablaze again—this time with a role in CBS’s Fire Country. Padalecki will join the popular series when it returns for its third season on October 18 playing Camden, a SoCal firefighter who takes notice of former inmate Bode’s (Max Thieriot) talent in Cal Fire. While the fan-favorite Supernatural alum is only slated for a three-episode guest arc, there’s a chance we could see more of his character, or even a spinoff, given that the network has already green-lighted Sheriff County following Morena Baccarin’s (Homeland) guest stint as the stepsister of division chief Sharon Leone (Diane Farr). The possibility of adding Padalecki to an…\n\nPREMIERES After Baywatch: Moment in the Sun Aug. 28, Hulu NEW Killer Lies: Chasing a True Crime Con Man Aug. 28, 8/7c, National Geographic NEW Kaos Aug. 29, Netflix NEW K-Pop Idols Aug. 30, Apple TV+ NEW Inside the NFL Aug. 30, 9/8c, The CW The Chosen Sept. 1, 8/7c, The CW 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days Sept. 1, 8/7c, TLC Born Evil: The Serial Killer and the Savior Sept. 2, 9/8c, Investigation Discovery NEW English Teacher Sept. 2, 10/9c, FX NEW Dark Side of Reality TV Sept. 3, 9/8c, Vice NEW Outlast Sept. 4, Netflix Tell Me Lies Sept. 4, Hulu Unsellable Houses Sept. 4, 8/7c, HGTV Bargain Block Sept. 4, 9/8c, HGTV Power Book II: Ghost Sept. 6, 8/7c, Starz Whose Line Is It Anyway?

Hall is reprising the role of Dexter Morgan as the inner voice of young Dexter in the Original Sin prequel. But now the producers have announced a Dexter: Resurrection series that takes place after Dexter: New Blood, at the end of which Dexter was killed. They said at the time that he was truly dead. Please tell me this won’t be another Dallas-style Bobby Ewing-in-the-shower moment. — Karen MATT ROUSH: We may not know how they pull off Dexter’s Resurrection until we see it. Why it’s happening is less mysterious. Paramount+ With Showtime is doubling down on spinoffs of its hit franchises (including Billions), so reports of Dexter’s death may have been premature. Whether fans buy it will depend on how eager they…"
