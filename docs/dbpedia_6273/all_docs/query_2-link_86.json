        "text": "Well, it's been a long while since the post was around, and for the sake of it.. i wanted to revive it back, so that way it won't leave off many things, and that it's been years since this was around\n\nPretty much, most of the shows like ALF, Batman/Superman, Animaniacs, Goosebumps, and many others have been made throughout the channel so far.. But yeah, now it's best to return it back, and give more into thoughts on this!\n\nCode Lyoko: Evolution: Well, pretty much a series i think would be a great way to give more fans into the channel, plus.. i think it would work for a better concept with Saturdays and to be paired with Wizards VS. Aliens for the nightime block. It does hold some good aspect, and the reason i think this could work for the channel because it bares with the fact Moonscoop has worked on a few shows for the channel, so i think this can work in. Maybe even the original series someday.. i just don't think Cartoon Network is going to air it though from the way it's been given.\n\nCorneil & Bernie: Well, i've actually seen this show before, and i do pretty much agree with people on this being on The Hub.. This show does fit in the matter for Comedy, but not only that.. it's a quite good show from the eye. It rather sad that The Hub doesn't mix in some content for the channel in the mornings, especially i think being a morning of girl-centric won't help any better for variety standards, and i think it would need a little fix to make it better, sure they help the ratings. but it's not going help the diversity in a matter.\n\nDisney's Teacher's Pet: I've said it before, and i'll say it again.. This show to me can really work on The Hub, from it's nice bit of Comedy, some form of education at times, and even the style for it. not only that, it would make sense for The Hub to air it as this was created by Gary Basement (the same guy who worked on the board game, Crainium). I know it's not a popular cartoon, but i think it could spare in the additon.. Plus, we never expected a show like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids: The TV Show being on here (sure, it's a popular franchise.. but i don't know if the TV show was even memorable), It's probably the only Disney show i ever wanted to see on the channel, and for a good reason i've mentioned.\n\nThe Muppet Show/Muppets Tonight: Ever since the movies have been airing, it kinda surprises more than there hasn't been a chance on them airing for quite a long while.. I would love to see how it would work in for the channel, plus.. i think we need more of variety-sketch shows that would appeal for families (not new ones, as i don't think it would be a good way to involve the concept). They can work, especially how popular it is.. the movies on here have been doing decent.\n\nGarfield & Friends: Mostly because i think both Hasbro & Jim Davis have once shared a little with thier project (well.. the Mr. Potato Head comic), and not only that.. but airing the Garfield films on the channel, which to me.. feels like with The Muppet acquisitions.. It still shocks me a little on how it's not a good time for them to air, as i think this could help them gaining more Comedy in the weekday mornings! If not, i would say The Garfield Show.. unless if Cartoon Network loses their rights to the show.\n\nPinky & The Brain: Possibly the \"only\" WB Silver Age cartoon that may ever be on the channel, knowing that The Hub only brought Animaniacs on here was just celebrate the 20th anniversary of the show's existance, and nothing much.. But if they seem to be wanting a few more.. i think this is the only show that might be made in for the channel.\n\nThe Rocky & Bullwinkle Show: The quite popular duo, with a good format of animated variety, and could help the appeal of Retro for a block. i think this could be a great way to promote the upcoming \"Mr. Peabody & Sherman\" film coming soon, and i think it could be helpful.. mostly The Hub has done alot of shows that airs on based on something like an Anniversaries, Movie Promotions, etc. Plus, they even got to air both The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle, and even Boris & Natasha: The Movie (which was unexpected, and i didn't even know they had a movie of it.. although loosly based).\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (1970s): One of those shows that involves a little of the formula similar to ones like Sliders (or) Hercules on the channel, containing a certain superhero in a drama-based show.. and this is one of those shows that can work in for Adults to look back on. I'm not known with the show.. but in a way, i can see it fit for a good reason if The Hub seems to wanting some Marvel-content for the channel.\n\nYou're definitely not the only one.\n\nYep.\n\nSo let’s add some acquisitions for other channels.\n\nOk......\n\nFor Cartoon Network… I can see them pulling a Universal Kids, Discovery Family(which will soon be a sister network), or even a Disney Channel and show some series from Netflix, Hulu, and other services not named HBO Max.\n\nI could actually see them doing that a bit, but with more success if done right. Hell, I would actually like for them to become the American equivalent of YTV(albeit with a few hours cut off from Adult Swim, it would not kill them to lose a hour or two).\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham and the new Animaniacs are obvious choices\n\nDuh.....\n\nWarner Bros. Animation made them. They'd fit nicely on a Har Har Tharsday-esque block.\n\n, but I also want to see them acquire Power Rangers. A part of this is because…\n\nI would actually see Power Rangers fitting in very well on CN. It's already on CN channels across the world.\n\nThe Warner-Discovery deal gives them a somehow still going deal with Hasbro. Granted, most of Hasbro’s upcoming shows are going to Nickelodeon, but that brings me to…\n\nNickelodeon losing the rights to Power Rangers, likely due to mistreatment, and moving it to Netflix in the first place.\n\nExactly, Transformers: Earthspark should be on Cartoon Network, not Nickelodeon, where they're just gonna pull it if it don't get SpongeBob-sized ratings right away.\n\nThe new action show push. While CN proper is working on action shows for both girls(DC Super Hero Girls, Jade Armor, My Adventures with Superman)\n\nThat's another thing. CN should also pick up Pretty Cure, Cardcaptor Sukara(with maybe the original that only aired for a short period of time in 2001 on Toonami), Lucky Star, Powerpuff Girls Z, Kaleido Star, Kiratto Pri-Chan, LoliRock and The Idolmaster. That should get them an immediate upper-hand in the girl's demographic. And why Pretty Cure itself has never been picked up Stateside will always be beyond me.\n\nand teens\n\nWhich is another reason why I want Adult Swim to lose the 8-10PM time period. The potential for a bridge block between Cartoon Network proper and Adult Swim proper is awesome. I could just make primetime as a bridge period, but I want it for any age, which is why I would rather have the 9PM hour Monday thru Thursday be something for teens. Either an slightly older CN original comedy and a action show or Williams Street to use this hour for a weekday Toonami block. Some great shows for the teen demographic on CN would be Gundam AGE, Welcome to Demon School, Iruma-Kun, Haikyuu!!!, One Piece(moved from Toonami),Young Justice, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, the English dubs of whatever Ultraman series they can get their hands on and My Hero Academia(moved from Toonami).\n\nWhich should be the MAIN demographic for action on Cartoon Network. Great shows for the demo would be Bravest Warriors, Virus Attack, Freefonix, Wakfu, Puzzle and Dragons X, Monster Hunter Stories: Ride On, Zoids Wild, Radiant and the return of Ninjago\n\n/families(Batman, Unicorn Warriors Eternal),\n\nExactly.\n\nthey are still lacking in terms of action for boys 6-11- ironically, the traditional action demographic.\n\nExactly, with that demographic. I'd have \"Mao-Mao, D.N. Ace, the return of Bakugan, Lego Monkie Kid and Power Rangers. I'd also try to deal DIRECTLY with The Pokemon Company to try to at least get the TV rights to Pokemon as well.\n\nWith CN also pushing live action with Degrassi and some of their upcoming originals, something like Power Rangers wouldn’t be too out of the ordinary.\n\nYeah. I've actually learned to accept this with open arms and is fully aware of the network's history(I'm 15). But, I'd have the network go a different direction. I'd really rather have the network renamed Checkerboard Network while having TruTV shut down with it's shows moved to TBS, Adult Swim or HBO Max and replaced with a new Cartoon Network that airs nothing but cartoons or have Boomerang turned into Cartoon Network. If they have to have live-action, I'd rather them keep it limited outside of movies. I'd rather the network acquire the following shows: Some Assembly Required, reruns of Degrassi: The Next Generation, Skatoony, Team Toon, The Sarah Jane Adventures, and Juila Jekyll and Harriet Hyde. The thing most in common with these is that they are either Canadian, British or Australian. By doing that, they are providing somewhat of a alternative to the live-action crap on Nickelodeon and Disney Channel.\n\nAnd besides, action's not the only genre around. There's a significant amount of comedy that I would like to see on Cartoon Network: The new Johnny Test, Angelo Rules, My Life Me, My Goldfish Is Evil!, Tootuff, Dennis and Gnasher: Unleashed, Horrid Henry, Lamput, Gaston Lagaffe(the 2009 animated series) and Mr. Bean: The Animated Series.\n\nI would also like to see some comedic/dramatic anime on the network: An new dub of Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future made by CN, Bang Zoom and Viz(because the way Disney did this show was just BEYOND dirty), Fruits Basket, K-ON!, After School Dice Club, Ouran High School Host Club, Hetalia: Axis Powers, Sgt. Frog(which should have been on back in 2008/09) and Full Moon.\n\nI also would like to have some shows for Cartoonito: Auto Boy: Carl from Mobile Land, Hello Kitty and Friends: Let's Learn Together, LazyTown, Doki, Pingu and Sesame Street(PBS airings be damned).\n\nAnd since there are no real fantasy thread for Adult Swim/Toonami(and AS IS CARTOON NETWORK AT NIGHT, JUST LEGALLY SPLIT), then I'd like to see Camp Camp, Close Enough, 10 Year Old Tom, The Prince, Santa Inc, Crash Canyon, Daft Planet, Delta State, Fugget About It!, John Callahan's Quads, Life's A Zoo, Station X, Sons of Butcher, Don't Hug Me I'm Scared and a hour-long showcase devoted to animated music videos, stuff from Super Deluxe and Adult Swim's old web stuff before that stuff was cut off last year thanks to the dumb decisions by AT&T. I'd also like to see a few comedic anime air OUTSIDE OF TOONAMI like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Gal and Dino, Dokkoida?! and Lupin the Third Part 6. I would also be interested in a weekly movie showcase on Friday nights called Swim Theater that airs movies that Adult Swim could be interested in like The Room, maybe some Rifftrax-dubbed movies and anime movies.\n\nIn Toonami, I would like to see the block expanded by at least 2 hours(11PM-5AM). I would like to see RWBY, Red vs. Blue, Harley Quinn: The Animated Series, Jujutsu Kaisen, Akudama Drive, the last season of Food Wars, Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon Season 2, the new season of Primal(since last time, it failed so badly on Sundays that it put down the ratings for other premieres, and I don't get why Genndy doesn't like Toonami) and Mob Psycho 100 Season 2 air as premieres this year(in 2022). For reruns. I'd like to see the return of Ghost In The Shell: Standalone Complex, IGPX(Immortal Grand Prix), Samurai Jack and Space Dandy this year(2022).\n\nI would also like to see the return of classics playing a regular part of the network's lineup again. For classic already in the Warner Bros. Discovery Animation library. I'd like to see them air on early weekend mornings from 6-9AM(Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry and Scooby-Doo would run daily). For old Cartoon Network shows. I'd rather see the return of Cartoon Planet airing either right after Cartoonito or the hour right before primetime.\n\nI'd also like to see ACME Hour air in the last hour of Adult Swim on weeknights. I'd also like to see Super Adventures(Toonami Roulette) air in the 5AM hour on Saturdays.\n\nI'd also like a weekly action movie showcase ala the short lived Action Flicks block from 2008 that airs DC animated movies, DC/Star Wars/Marvel/action movies that they have the rights to and some anime movies like the Dragon Ball Z movies they used to show all the time in the 2000's, the Naruto movies they also used to show, some of the Miyazaki movies and maybe some other family-friendly anime movies. I'd call the showcase Saturday Theatre or X-Acme Night.\n\nI'd also like the return of viewer's choice on the network.\n\nLook, I HATE the idea of Cartoon Network either being half-littered with live-action or being banished to a channel space that people barely get, but at this point, it's far too late to save this channel, and it was too late in 2009 when CNReal first came out, and it was getting too late in 2005 when they first said live-action was coming. Perhaps it's time that another new animation network come around and pick up where Cartoon Network left off.\n\nSo yeah. Those are my thoughts and I would honestly like to see on Cartoon Network. I would really want the network to go back to their roots and show nothing BUT cartoons, but it's just not gonna happen.\n\nBTW, expect a fantasy schedule for this eventually."
