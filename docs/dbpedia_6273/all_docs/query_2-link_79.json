        "text": "Please welcome Allison Tait, a multi-genre writer who has more than twenty years of experience in magazines, newspapers, and online publishing. The Mapmaker Chronicles is her first series for children, and it is winning her a legion of fans. Book one was Race To the End of the World. Book two, Prisoner of The Black Hawk, hit the shelves April 1, and book three, the final installment in this trilogy, will be released in October 2015.\n\nPart fantasy quest, part peril on the high seas, Race to the End of the World is rollicking fun. Not since Emily Rodda’s Deltora Quest series has there been such an exciting adventure tale from an Australian author … perfect for readers aged 8 to 12 who are looking for some escapism in the sea of contemporary stories.” – Holly Harper, readings.com.au\n\nConnect with Allison on her blog, on Facebook, and on Twitter.\n\nAre You Ignoring Your Best Ideas?\n\nI never imagined I’d be an author of children’s books. When I began writing fiction seriously in my late twenties, I took it all very…seriously. I was working as a features writer at a major women’s magazine and I approached my fiction in much the same way as I would approach an article. I looked around to see where my “market” might be and I decided I would write to “target” them.\n\nAnd so I began writing romance novels. I figured that they made sense for me—there were definite market segments, I had the right “voice,” I’d read shedloads of romance novels in my late teens… how hard could it be?\n\n[pullquote]\n\nStory ideas are everywhere and, as writers, we need to train ourselves to see them. Sometimes, they might not be quite what we expect – but that just makes them more exciting!\n\n[/pullquote]\n\nAs it turned out, it was a lot harder than I thought. I really struggled to stay within the […]\n\nRead More\n\nI’ve worked with hundreds of genre novelists over the past few years, as an editor, “plotstorm” partner, and coach. My job is to help them take the swirling, chaotic mess of characters and premise fragments and “cool ideas”, and guide them to a clear, cohesive vision of how the story could work.\n\nIn all that time, I’ve noticed that when a writer is stuck, there are four basic questions which identify where they’re getting tripped up, and often how to fix it.\n\nKeep in mind: these are most applicable to genre-geared three act structure. That said, they can apply to any story. If you’re feeling stuck, see if you can answer these four questions:\n\nWhat does your character want?\n\nIf you don’t know what your protagonist wants, both in life in general and in this story particularly, then odds are good you’re going to get stuck. Protagonists are characters who, as a direct result of their journey through the struggles of the novel, change and grow. They also go from reactive to proactive. Consequently, they need to want something.\n\nThis is also best put in positive terms. State what the character wants as opposed to what he doesn’t want. It’s better to say “the character wants to make it to the American embassy” rather than “the character wants to evade the bad guys.”\n\nFor one thing, the first statement is clear, tangible, and measurable. He’s either at the embassy, or he’s not. As long as he’s not in the hands of the bad guys, on the other hand, he’s technically “evading the bad guys.”\n\nAt the very least, put a time limit or other tangible restriction on it – evade the bad guys until the package gets delivered or something. (Although, in that case, it seems like the characters goal would then be ensure delivery of the package… you see how that works?)\n\n(The other side of this coin: if you have a story with an antagonist, knowing what he wants is also crucial. He can’t simply […]\n\nRead More\n\nToday’s treat at WU has two faces—I wouldn’t be able to show you their hands, because they are typing too fast. Welcome to Johnny B. Truant and Sean Platt of Sterling and Stone, the wide website umbrella that houses their “story studio” of fiction imprints, blogs and podcast. Together, along with their other partner David Wright, they have produced an astonishing array of novels and stories over the past few years, averaging over a million and a half words a year. And popular words, from looking at their Amazon pages. Their genres run the gamut from westerns, horror, fantasy, and thrillers to children’s books. (And naughty stuff too, for large children.)\n\nTheir 2014 Write, Publish, Repeat self-publishing guide has hundreds of positive reviews; I’m one of the happy readers that regards it highly. Today we’ll discuss with Sean and Johnny how they work as writing collaborators, their remarkable productivity, and how they promote their work. And whether Sean will open up a winery. From now on I’m going to sit under their keyboards and just catch the discards—should be worth at least three novels.\n\nJumping right in, you call your main site, the Sterling and Stone site, a “story studio.” Will you explain that for the Writer Unboxed audience in terms of your imprints and the fact that you guys write in various genres, from horror, fantasy, to even children’s stuff.\n\nRead More\n\nNext week I’ll be moderating a panel at Left Coast Crime in Portland titled, “The Taste of Copper, the Smell of Cordite: Clichés in Crime Fiction.”\n\nThis topic in one form or another crops up just about every year, making the panel itself a kind of cliché. I’ve heard Martyn Waite deride the jazz-loving detective, and Karin Slaughter bemoan sex scenes where all the male hero has to do is, basically, show up.\n\nSomeone sooner or later mentions the smoky-voiced, sex-soaked femme fatale who bears a greater resemblance to Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle than to any living, breathing woman. And Chandler’s old saw, “When you get stuck, just send somebody through the door with a gun,” is always good for a brisk flogging. (Why not send him in with a dowsing rod, or a flaming parrot, or a penis pump?)\n\nBut as I began to organize my thoughts for this thing, I realized that in all the general writing conferences I’ve attended, I have never – never, not once – seen a panel titled “Clichés in Literary Fiction.”\n\nWhy is that?\n\n[pullquote]Perhaps the greatest cliché in literary fiction involves not phrasing or character, setting or plot devices, but tone. I mean, of course, irony.[/pullquote]\n\nDoes literary fiction present such a broad range of human experience – beyond what one finds, for example, down the nearest mean street, or inside the average police station – that it doesn’t need to revisit the same predictable situations over and over?\n\nPlease. I wish to introduce Exhibit A: the middle-aged college professor (or the housewife with a degree in Comp Lit) contemplating an affair.\n\nAre perhaps the writers of literary fiction so advanced in craft and lofty of mind they never succumb to a commonplace phrase?\n\nIf only.\n\nRead More\n\nI don’t tell my ‘academic’ colleagues that I write fiction. I don’t talk much about my non-fiction writing to my fiction-writing community. I LOVE e-readers because they don’t reveal whether I’m reading a steamy romance, popular history, angst-ridden literary novel, nineteenth-century article on hospitals, or an idiot’s guide to something technical that even my nine-year-old already knows how to do.\n\nWhy do I do this? Why hide my reading and writing habits? Am I ashamed of something? Scared? Yes, of course. But of what?\n\nIn switching between genres I’m scared of crossing social boundaries—of entering unknown, perhaps even unfriendly, territory; of not knowing the rules of acceptable behavior; of feeling like an outsider; of being judged, teased, criticized, left out . . . wait, this is starting to sound like conversations I’ve been having with my daughter about playground interactions.\n\nSo, does this mean genres are the literary equivalent of cliques? Hmmm. Bear with me for a little while on this.\n\nFirst off, I’m not saying cliques (or genres) are good or bad in and of themselves. They exist. I’m also not interested in examining the varying characteristics of different literary genres. I do want to examine how we use them, what we potentially get from them, and what we lose by them.\n\nRead More\n\nTherese here to officially introduce you to our newest regular contributor: Cathy Yardley! Cathy is the author of eighteen novels, published with houses such as St. Martin’s and Avon, as well as her self-published Rock Your Writing series. She’s also a developmental editor and writing coach, helping authors complete, revise, and get their stories published. Please join me in welcoming her to WU!\n\n“Everything’s been done already. Why am I even bothering?”\n\nI hear this from writers all the time. This seems especially true for genre novelists, who worry that their story idea isn’t original, or worse, that nothing is original these days.\n\nDoes the world really need another swords-and-sorcery Tolkien knock-off? Why in the world would they want yet another billionaire’s secret baby? And haven’t we seen the hard-boiled P.I. or cheerfully dotty amateur sleuth more than enough?\n\nThey’re asking the wrong question.\n\nThey’re examining the “problem” as writers — not as readers.\n\nThe better question is: why are these genres, tropes and archetypes still popular?\n\nFairy tales. Fables. Myths. Archetypes. They’ve been twisted, tweaked, and tailored to fit audiences for centuries, right up to today.\n\nWriters don’t need to write something so unique it’s unrecognizable. Instead, we can address the emotional needs served by these so-called “unoriginal” tales — and create something that serves those needs in a new way.\n\nAnd now for something completely different.\n\nTo understand why “nothing new under the sun” is not a death knell, we’re going to examine…\n\nFootball.\n\nSpecifically, The Superbowl.\n\n(If you’re not a huge American football fan, neither am I. Please bear with me.)\n\nThe Superbowl first started in 1967. In all that time, the rules have remained fairly static.\n\nThe outcome is also predictable: one team will win, one team will lose. It cannot end in a tie.\n\nNor will it end unexpectedly with the teams breaking into interpretive dance around a painted yak in the third quarter. “Originality” is not the point here.\n\nIt’s the same game every year. Only the players are different. So why do so many people tune in every year?\n\nRead More\n\nA couple of weeks ago, a client told me one of his beta readers had said his book read like a comic book. I asked why that was a bad thing.\n\nGranted, you don’t want your characters to be shallow caricatures or your plot to be mechanical or contrived, which is what many people mean by “reads like a comic book.” But all of this client’s characters were fully rounded and plausibly human. Even the psychopath who hunted people down in the woods had his vulnerable moments. And while his plot had problems, contrivance wasn’t one of them. I suspect his beta reader was complaining about the fact that his manuscript was an exciting adventure story.\n\nYears ago, I stopped reading New Yorker fiction because I lost patience with beautifully written stories in which nothing much happens. For the sake of this article (oh, the sacrifices I make.), I picked up a recent issue to try again.\n\nJoseph O’Neill’s “The Referees” tells the story of Rob, who has just returned to New York and is trying to get two character references so he can move into a co-op. We meet a lot of Rob’s former friends and get a good idea of who he is and what kind of life he’s led. He has a clear and engaging voice, and it’s hard not to like him despite his drawbacks. The story makes good use of some advanced techniques, like present-tense narration and a highly unreliable narrator. It also says some intriguing things about how we judge one another and ourselves. But by the end of the story Rob still has only one reference, which he wrote himself, and we don’t know if he gets the apartment or not. Maybe he’s changed by the experience. Maybe he’s not.\n\nIn short, nothing happens. It does it quite beautifully, but . . .\n\nI understand why some people might love quality characterization and beautiful writing so much that they’re willing to […]\n\nRead More\n\nToday we’re thrilled to have Martha Conway with us. Her latest novel, THIEVING FOREST (Noontime Books), is the story of seventeen-year-old Susanna Quiner, who watches as a band of Potawatomi Indians kidnaps her four older sisters from their cabin. With both her parents dead from Swamp Fever and all the other settlers out in their fields, Susanna makes the rash decision to pursue them herself. What follows is a young woman’s quest to find her sisters, and the parallel story of her sisters’ new lives. The book explores the transformation of all five sisters as they contend with starvation, slavery, betrayal, and love.\n\nMartha’s first novel 12 Bliss Street was nominated for an Edgar Award, and her short fiction has appeared in The Iowa Review, The Mississippi Review, The Quarterly, Folio, Carolina Quarterly, and other publications. She graduated from Vassar College and received her master’s degree in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University. She has taught fiction at Stanford University’s Online Writer’s Studio and UC Berkeley Extension, and is a recipient of a California Arts Council fellowship in Creative Writing. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, she now lives with her family in San Francisco.\n\nMartha tweets ten-minute writing prompts every morning on twitter (#10minprompt).

The traditional hero tends to stand apart from the people he meets along the way, touching down only briefly on his way toward a […]\n\nRead More\n\nWe’re thrilled to have Cathy Yardley return as our guest today!\n\nCathy Yardley is the author of seventeen traditionally published novels.

Sometimes, I want the caffeinated buzz of a twisty thriller.\n\nI consume it like a glutton at a buffet: a plate full of women’s fiction with a side of cozy mystery, then a helping of literary fiction nestled next to a generous scoop of sci-fi. Finish off with a few petit-fours of Regency romances, chased with a few stiff shots of horror.\n\n(If you’ve ever left the library with more than an armload of books at a time, hopefully you can understand the obsession.)\n\n“What difference does genre make?”\n\nI’ve met quite a few people who feel their work crosses genre – or in some cases, “transcends” it. They don’t want to be pigeon-holed. In a digital world, does it really matter? Do you really need to label your novel?\n\nIn my opinion: yes. Yes, you really do.\n\nWhy? Because it’s not about you. It’s about your readers.\n\nYour reader wants to find you – and in a digital world, full of information overload, readers are drowning in a sea of options. You want to make it as easy as possible for your reader to narrow down her choices. Genre is the first broad stroke in that attempt.\n\nHere’s an analogy. Let’s say you had a restaurant, one in a row of restaurants. They’ve all got their signs out: D’onofrio’s Fine Italian dining, Los Cabos Mexican eatery, Liberty […]\n\nRead More\n\nA lot of humorous novels build the comedy into the characters. We watch two hapless lovers stumble toward each other in rom-coms or pull themselves out of increasingly bizarre situations in screwballs. You can write this kind of humor with nothing more than insight into human nature and enough love for your characters to laugh at them. But you need a different set of skills to create a book where the comedy is built into your fictional world, whether it’s the alternate aristocracy of Jeeves and Wooster or the physics-bending fantasy of Terry Pratchett’s Diskworld.\n\nA funny world has to be consistent, for instance. Not in terms of its physics or metaphysics – in fact, the bafflegab can be less plausible in parody worlds. But place you create has to have a consistent comedic sense. A cosmos in which spaceships travel by creating random whales in low earth orbit feels like the same sort of cosmos in which the answer to the great question of life, the universe, and everything is 42.\n\nSome time ago I edited a book set in an alternate universe in which some fictional characters in our world – Sherlock Holmes, Romeo and Juliet, James Bond – had actually lived. Some, but not all – Romeo and Juliet were real, but Hamlet was not. In fact, it quickly becomes clear that fictional characters are only real in the alternate universe when it lets the writer get away with a gag. The gags weren’t bad, but the ad hoc nature of the world made it harder to believe in, and thus harder to enjoy.\n\nOne way to keep your world consistent is to think of it as just another character, with its own sensibility and voice.\n\nRead More\n\nGreetings, lovely WU community. Kath here, back from the dead, with Therese. We invite you to gather ’round and let us tell you a story of endings, beginnings, and another WU experiment…\n\nPrologue. The year is 2006. Kath is eagerly clicking open an email from her then-agent. She’s been working with said agent for a couple years now, shopping historical novels with a Gothic twist, but the traditional publishing world, awash in sexy dukes and vampires, with a voracious market looking for more of the same, isn’t interested.\n\nBut this, Kath thinks, this book is different. Written during a particularly dark time of her personal life, when a very close relative was sent to the Green Zone to serve during Operation Iraqi Freedom, she channeled her emotions into a fantasy novel that is by turns mordant, part steampunk, part fantasy, a romance against a backdrop of war. There’s some inappropriate humor laced in it. It’s her best work, she thinks, and lord she’d been at the writing game for some time now, honing her craft, absorbing the lessons of good storytelling. Surely, this time, it’ll catch.\n\nThe then-agent sent a polite, three sentence note. Paraphrase: WTF is this? I need a sexy vampire story, not this war crap. And, uh, I’ll pretend you never sent this to me, okay, and I won’t drop you.\n\nAnd Kath gets it. Which shelf would this novel sit, if published? It’s genre fiction, but could only charitably be called a mongrel, borrowing from many genres. It’s a weird book. An unboxed book.\n\nSadly, the book goes in a drawer. Kath starts working as a writer-for-hire for book packagers, to see if she can gain bonafides in a market that is starting to implode under the strains of an economic crash and the digital transition. Slowly, she starts to lose the love she has for writing fiction. An intense day job takes up even more emotional energy. It gets so bad at one point, she stops writing altogether, […]\n\nRead More\n\nThere are precious few satisfying answers to the question above. I have gone to the trouble to list them for you here.\n\n“Oh, I dabble in literary fiction, you may have heard my address at the Nobel Prize ceremony?”\n\n“Joanne Rowling. Lovely to meet you.”\n\n“Mainly plays. Probably nothing you know. Ah, you’ve read King Lear, have you?”\n\nOr even: “Very few, actually. I’ve barely put pen to paper since dashing off Catcher in the Rye back in the 50s.”\n\nWhat you don’t want to say is this:\n\n“Well, I’m technically speaking a children’s writer, but not entirely, I mean, older children, some not children at all, many perfectly sentient adults, in fact, seem to like my books, which do, of course, feature adolescents, but often incorporate quite difficult themes, say, on the subject of life and death, so that about half of my UK readers are over thirty and many of my Finnish readers are over fifty…oh, and by the way, I’ve also written three or four picture books, and am kind of mulling over a middle grade series, just for a change of pace.”\n\nAnd if you think it gets simpler, think again. I’m just finishing up my new book, with a protagonist who has graduated from art school which makes him at least 22 — a good two or three years older than many of my past protagonists.\n\nImagine that for a radical departure.\n\nThe new book is called Duck Zoo, and my hero has the wrong job and the wrong girlfriend, and two dogs who are trying to sort his life out for him. It’s pure Meg Rosoff territory, if you’ll allow me to refer to myself in the third person for a minute here (ala Gwyneth Paltrow). It’s a comedy, kind of surreal, all about love and work with lots of dogs.\n\nBut it’s a whole new genre because technically speaking, Jonathan is not a young adult.\n\nAnd all I can think is, oh dear god, won’t someone save me from marketing departments.\n\nI wonder if […]\n\nRead More\n\nUnlike many people I know, I’ve never wanted to write the story of my life. And I’ve come to belatedly believe that this lack of autobiographic desire on my part has affected my fiction writing, and not necessarily for the best.\n\nI say “belatedly” because I’ve been writing fiction for close to 15 years, but only a few years ago did I start to readjust what I now see as a rather closed and negative mindset I’d been maintaining.\n\nIn the past, I used to consciously avoid drawing on my own life and experiences when writing fiction. I’ll admit that I probably got a bit snobby about it, making blithe statements like “I prefer to write about lives far more interesting than my own,” and looking down my nose at authors who wrote what I considered to be thinly veiled memoir, but who positioned their work as fiction. Frankly, I thought they were being both lazy and self-absorbed in doing so. I’ve since reevaluated that stance.\n\nSo what has changed? Well, despite being an opinionated bastard, I do pride myself on actually listening to others, particularly those who are further along in their literary journeys. So I pay attention to the advice and insights of successful authors, and I make an attempt to try their advice on for size before dismissing it. To that end, today I’d like to share some insights I gained from two very different writers: WU’s own Barbara O’Neal, and the author of the Jack Reacher series, Lee Child.\n\nA wise woman weighs in on the stories we each own\n\nBack in 2011, I was fortunate enough to see Barbara O’Neal presenting at the RWA Women’s Fiction Conference (back when the RWA still acknowledged women’s fiction as a valid category, but don’t get me started on that sore subject). At the time, Barbara was serving as the “Wise Woman” for the Women’s Fiction chapter, a title she more than deserved. The entire conference was terrific, but I think I got the biggest personal takeaway from Barbara’ segment, where she made this simple […]\n\nRead More"
