        "text": "On October 24, 1957, animator Walt Disney testified before the putrid House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and named Disney employees he believed to be communists. In contrast to this reactionary, and traitorous, act by Disney before HUAC, I’d like to highlight some revolutionary and radical librarians in reality and in fiction in this post. I mentioned some of these librarians in my post last week, but I plan to go further in this post. Unintentionally, this post was published the same day as Caroline Cuicci’s “6 of the Most Radical Librarians in History” on Book Riot, with only one person (Audre Lore) listed there being the same as the one in this article.\n\nI’ll start with Mao Zedong. Briefly mentioned in my post last week, he served as a librarian’s assistant at Peking University from 1918-1919 where he appeared to only earn $8 a month organizing shelves and carrying periodicals to readers. This studying and experiences as a library worker was also said to help “shape his revolutionary outlook and ideas.” [1] The same was also likely the case for Kim Il Sung, who I mentioned in my post last week as being the head librarian at Yuwen Middle School, seemingly in the 1920s, earning him the nickname “librarian Kim” or “librarian Song Ju”. Mao later went onto become the leader of socialist China, which is known as People’s Republic of China or PRC. Kim later became leader of socialist Korea, also known as Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK.\n\nOthers include Christopher Okigbo, a Nigerian poet, teacher, and librarian, who was a committed African nationalist who pushed for independence of Biafra, and prolific poet and writer Audre Lorde. Lorde, another Black librarian, was born to Caribbean immigrants and described herself as a “Black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet”. She earned an MLS from Columbia University and worked as a librarian at Mount Vernon Public Library (1961-1963) and at New York City’s Town School Library (1966 to 1968). Some librarians, like Shawn(ta) Smith-Cruz, have noted that Lorde wanted to become a librarian in order to “effect social change” but left when it wasn’t enough for her, not feeling a sense of joy anymore, leading her to become a poet, revolutionary, and lesbian all at the same time. This compared to Mao who spent time in the journals section of the Beijing University Library, Karl Marx who spent long hours in the British Museum Library, and Friedrich Engels who worked in libraries as well. [2] As I noted in my post last week, Vladimir Lenin himself recognized the power of libraries, although I do not believe he ever worked in a library.\n\nMao appears in various Chinese films set in the time period he was a librarian, but without watching them, it is hard to know if he appears as a librarian there or not. The same can be said about other Chinese films which also feature Mao as a protagonist. [3] In comparison, I don’t believe that Lorde has been depicted in any fiction to date, while I’m not sure if any of the films which have depicted Marx have shown him studying in a library. The same can be said about Kim as well.\n\nThese historical figures are different from librarians like peace activist Paul Otlet. There are real-life radical librarians. This includes groups like the Radical Librarians Collective which aims to “offer a space to challenge, to provoke, to improve and develop the communications between like-minded radicals, to galvanise…collective solidarity against the marketisation of libraries and…removal of our agency to our working worlds and beyond.” Another group is the Radical Reference Collective, which is said to be a a non-hierarchical volunteer collective “who believe in supporting social justice, independent journalists, and activist causes.” There’s also publications like the Journal of Radical Librarianship, an open access journal publishing “high quality, rigorously reviewed and innovative scholarly work in the field of radical librarianship”, specifically any work that “contributes to a discourse around critical library and information theory and practice.”\n\nSome librarians have said radical librarians are those who advocate for “fundamental or revolutionary changes in current practices, conditions, or institutions.” Despite this, as Thomas Elend noted that to some people “the idea of a radical librarian, or the library as a radical place, may seem odd” and the idea of a librarian or a library as a radical person or place “is not usually brought to mind.” Some like Sanford Berman, in the anthology Revolting Librarians, called on libraries to “stock material covering all possible political and other viewpoints” and went onto lambast libraries for timid collections that “contained few countercultural and radical periodicals” and told his readers to “demand that their libraries collect the radical press, especially…[about] Third World liberation movements”. [4] Such librarians would be more radical than those in Library War which one review in an ALA publication strangely called “Radical Militant Librarians protecting books, and private access to those books”, when there are really just librarian-soldiers. They are not about being “agents of transformative social engagement — actively working to better their communities” but are acting as guardians of knowledge, rather than sharing it, from those trying to censor it. It reinforces existing typical values, in line with bourgeois sensibilities, rather than helping the people at-large.\n\nThere’s also others who were “increasingly tiresome to constantly argue against the neo-liberal, professionalist view” prevalent in workplaces, and it is laughable for defense of freedom, access, and privacy can be considered “radical” or “militant” as an ALA button, created by the Office for Intellectual Freedom in 2006, to protest “overreaching aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act.” None of those positions are radical nor “militant” in the slightest. Some have noted those who want to use existing cataloging rules to “really subvert and change things”. Otherwise, there are groups like the Progressive Librarians Guild, which is currently on hiatus and exists to “expose and call out” librarianship’s active and passive “complicity and acceptance” of oppressive systems, while offering and practicing “alternatives to those systems”. They also aim to “empower the voices of those excluded from positions of power and/or the historical record and to develop a praxis that contributes to on-going pursuits of human rights and dignity”. Their commitments go further than this. They are somewhat similar to groups such as Radical Reference, said to be a “collective of progressive library workers and students”.\n\nThere’s more that could be said about radical or revolutionary librarians, but its important to look at fictional librarians, noting if any could be considered radical or revolutionary. In some ways, Amity Blight in The Owl House could fulfill this as she is standing up to Emperor Belos and her collaborationist mother, and on the side of her girlfriend, Luz Noceda. She even ends up being stranded in the human world as a result, as shown at the end of Season 2 and into Season 3.\n\nThere’s no one like Li Dazhao, also known as Li Ta-chao, a Chinese intellectual and revolutionary who co-founded the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with Chen Duxiu in July 1921 and built a united front, at the time, between the CCP and Nationalist Party (KMT) in early 1924. He was later arrested and then executed by warlord Zhang Zuolin in Beijing in 1927. As for being a librarian, in January 1918, he was hired to be head of the library at Peking University (Beijing University) and later became a professor, and he influenced students like Mo, who then worked as an assistant in the library’s reading room!\n\nIt can be said that in many ways, Myne, the protagonist of Ascendance of a Bookworm, is radical and revolutionary. As I noted in my post last week, she crosses class barriers and develops enemies, but her family is firmly working class and detests the nobles, who are the only ones who have books. Myne works to change this by trying to make books available to everyone, even if it involves her making an alliance with a merchant,. She even becomes a priest so she can read books.\n\nUnfortunately, many fictional librarians are relatively institutional and have no intention of being revolutionary or radical. This includes those in Tatakau Shisho: The Book of Bantorra, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Bibliophile Princess. The same can be said for those in Little Demons, We Bare Bears, Horrid Henry, Mira, Royal Detective, Elena of Avalor, Archie’s Weird Mysteries, Craig of the Creek, or The Ghost and Molly McGee. Even Kaisa, the well-known librarian in Hilda, holds back on helping Frida free Hilda from troll magic, saying that magic from witches and trolls don’t mix, and not wanting to endure the ire of the Committee of Witches, which threw her “accidentally” into the void of no return for not returning an overdue library book!\n\nOthers are the spitting opposite of radical, like the excessive shushers like the Librarian in Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil, Miss Dickens in Carl Squared (“Carl’s Techno-Jinx”), Mrs. Shusher in The Replacements (“Quiet Riot”), and Rita Book in Timon & Pumbaa (“Library Brouhaha“) to name a few. However, these librarians are tame as compared to the active censor and reactionary librarian Francis Clara Censorsdoll in Moral Orel or the librarian who lets an man with a gun kidnap his patrons, the infamous Cletus Bookbinder in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends.\n\nThere are many more librarians I could cover in this post, whether talking about Archie the Archivist in Regular Show, Mr. Ambrose in Bob’s Burgers (“Y Tu Ga-Ga Tina Tambien”), any of the many non-human librarians, and those in webcomics or film. In the end, there will continue to be radical and revolutionary librarians. It remains to be seen if they will appear in pop culture. Currently fictional libraries tend to be tied to their institutions and not resist the systems they find themselves in, making them stuck in metaphoric library towers like the one Victorique finds herself in through the Gosick anime series, or thethe infamous tower Rapunzel in during Tangled. Hopefully this changes in the future with characters who have identities beyond being just librarians, allowing them to pass the Librarian Portrayal Test.\n\n© 2022-2023 Burkely Hermann.

Borges was strongly anti-communist, detesting Marxists and Communists, and anti-fascist, while Nunez was a Cuban exile. But neither are revolutionary or radical in the slightest. You could argue the same for Reinaldo Arenas, a poet, novelist, and playwright, who was a researcher in the José Martí National Library from 1963 to 1968, was imprisoned in Cuba in the 1970s for his writings and open homosexuality, then escaped to the U.S. in 1980 and settled in New York City, where he mentored several other Cuban writers in exile. The post also notes Kavevangua Kahengua, who was born in Botswana and living in Namibia since 1993, and is a librarian scholar.\n\n[2] Parnell, Stephen. “Literature, libertines and Lenin’s wife: famous people and libraries,” University of South Australia Library, Feb. 2002. There’s also anarchist and feminist activist Rosa Dubovsky, who founded the Emma Goldman library, and left Russia in 1905, when there was a revolution (which later failed) led by the Bolsheviks, and later settled in Argentina. Although he wasn’t revolutionary and was more institutional, there’s also Carlos Victor Penna who once said “without libraries, there can be no good primary schools, no efficient secondary schools and no productive universities. In the absence of libraries, it is neither possible to encourage nor to maintain a permanent education for adults.”\n\n[3] This includes The Founding of a Party aka Beginning of the Great Revival (2011), The Founding of an Army (2017), The East Is Red aka The East Is Red: A Song and Dance Epic (1965), and Breaking with Old Ideas (1975), along with the Mao Zedong TV series which ran for two seasons and 100 episodes from 2013 to 2014. There also After School (1972 film).\n\n[4] As I noted in the past, Berman was “known as a cataloger, and librarian, who directly challenged mainstream views on librarianship, including criticizing LCCO subject headings, describing them as biased in terms of race, sex, etc. and described poor cataloging as a form of censorship.” Very different from this is “The fine manual for revolutionary librarians” by an anarchist, Micheal Velli, although it is hard to say how revolutionary or radical this would be.\n\nScholar Megan Watson has argued that “effective leadership” in libraries is still defined in typically White masculine terms, despite increasing gender parity and research showing benefits of “non-normative decision-making practices.” As a result, female leaders often mix White male qualities such as “assertiveness, confidence, and decisiveness” which can be tempered by characteristics such as “kindness, empathy, and deference.” This approach has extended to women of color who are library leaders, who often want to avoid the perception they are angry, troublesome, bossy, or dangerous, which undermines their access to positions of power and management. She argues that White culture in libraries is interconnected with organizational inertia, with women of color encouraged to comply with structures of their oppression in order to succeed. At the same time, she says that while White women are hindered by gender inequity in academic libraries (and elsewhere), their Whiteness still allows them to “access and wield hegemonic privilege and power.” The latter is often paired with the idea professional success is the result of “individual hard work and merit,” resulting in White feminist neoliberal thinking. Watson suggests that leaders dismantle and question hierarchical systems which place power and influence in “hands of a select few” who often “look, sound, and act like them.” [1]\n\nWhile librarians in animation, film, and elsewhere, often only appear briefly, there are few White men, and even few who have bigger roles in these episodes. These characters can be analyzed based off Watson’s arguments, and those of others. This includes the old librarian in She-Ra: Princess of Power episode (“Three Courageous Hearts”), the unnamed librarian in an episode of Sofia the First (“Forever Royal”?), and Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, among many others. This post is relatively shorter than my post last week, but I still see it as important nonetheless.\n\nThe librarian in the episode of She-Ra: Princess of Power, voiced by George DiCenzo, looks, and sounds, like an elderly White man. While it has been noted that there is a “lack of racial diversity in academic librarianship,” it is true of librarianship as a whole. Binh P. Le wrote, in July 2021, that throughout history “library leadership positions, regardless of the type of library…have been held by White males.” So, the librarian in this animated series being a White man is not a surprise in that respect. His role as a librarian implies that White men are to be respected and be in positions of authority. However, he is not in a leadership position. As such, he can’t use any “assertiveness, confidence, and decisiveness,” nor is he technically tied to White culture in libraries, as the series is not set on Earth.\n\nThe same is, arguably, the case for other librarians as well. For instance, Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, who is voiced by Steve Zahn, is only a librarian in his debut episode. Even worse, he dumps his responsibility on two elderly White women (the other librarians) so he can help two White kids, who he doesn’t know before this, play a song to rekindle the relationship between the parents of these kids. It sounds bad when you really think about it. If that isn’t enough, he insults the library as old fashioned and seems bored with his job. It is unlikely that he attempted to disrupt Whiteness within the library where he worked.\n\nMoving on, there’s Librarian in an episode of Sarah and Duck (“Lost Librarian”) and Harold in Craig of the Creek (voiced by Matt Burnett). In the case of the first, he almost cedes his authority to the patron, Sarah, and her pet duck, who help him find the paper catalog, which happens to have all the names of the patrons in it. The fact that the catalog is on paper rather than digital, which is how many libraries organize information these days, gives the impression that libraries are old-fashioned. In contrast, although Harold is a bit grouchy and possibly annoyed with his job, he still helps patrons, no matter their skin color, and even allows a section of the library for books made by patrons themselves. That’s an ingenious way to get buy-in from patrons. He is also very passionate about his work as a librarian. He likely is disrupting Whiteness, either consciously or subconsciously.\n\nThis differs dramatically from the library guardian Archie the Archivist (voiced by John Cygan) in Regular Show or Barebones in Brownie and Barebones. The former embodies the idea of a librarian as a keeper of the books, a guardian of knowledge. This can also signify that the librarian is a bit of a gatekeeper. That, obviously, has racial connotations, as such a role can be used to keep material from Black people, or even “objectionable” material from White people. Barebones, on the other hand, is one of the most easygoing librarians ever. By that I mean that he often leaves work early, leaves a mess, and travels to other worlds. After all, he is a dragon. He leaves his White gay workaholic boss, Anthony, to go on adventures with his good friend, Brownie. As I said in my aforementioned post:\n\n…he doesn’t want to do his job and slacks off from work, yes. Also, he is not shown shushing anyone. He also steals books from the library…[and] sometimes he accidentally lights books on fire too…he wears glasses…[and] is British…there aren’t that many series I have watched as of yet, with British librarians, so that makes him different from other librarians. He also is skipping out on work all the time, more interested in going on adventures than going to the library where a strict Anthony is his boss.\n\nIn this way, he is similar to Julian in The Vampire Librarian, a White man who is masquerading as a librarian, when he is actually a vampire. Julian’s colleague, Beth, is a witchy librarian. In that way, both are bucking the norm, and not upholding the system. As for Barebones, he only cares about his job enough to earn some money, but not enough to be wedded to it, and he can easily leave his job when he wants.\n\nThis contrasts with Stewart Goodson in The Public, who is played by Emilio Estevez, and Blinkous “Blinky” Galadrigal in Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans. In the case of the latter, he is a non-human librarian, voiced by Kelsey Grammer. He is a White man when in human form, but not in the film. He is just as dedicated to knowledge as Stewart, a library assistant at a Cincinnati branch library in the film. In the sense that he stands with the homeless people instead of the library administrators, Stewart is disrupting Whiteness. Blinky is not, however, as it is only temporarily human and is more often a troll.\n\nThe worst librarian of the lot is Cletus Bookbinder in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. He appears in one episode, which is broken into various parts. He allows, and encourages, a man with a gun to abduct two of his patrons, finding them as an annoying nuisance. Even Rocky and Bullwinkle are “problem patrons”, it still would not justify what happens in this library. In many ways, he supports the existing power structure and is glad about his role.\n\nThere are many other librarians in animation and webcomics. [2] The latter includes Rex Libris in Rex Libris, but I cannot say much on him as I have not yet read Rex Libris. Once I do, I could write more about him more than the Wikipedia page says, or the official website which calls him, comically, “…a true guardian of knowledge, foe of the foolish, defender of the Dewey Decimal System, and the best hope for the future of civilization.” In the end, while there are many other White librarians that could be examined, this post is only a beginning to this topic, one that can be expanded more in the future. Until next time!\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

Gina Schlesselman-Tarango, Library Juice Press: Sacramento, CA: 2017), 156-157, 165.\n\n[2] Other librarians who appear rarely in animation include the Human librarian in The Simpsons episode (“Lisa’s Wedding”), library clerk in The Simpsons episode (“Bart’s Girlfriend”) (Voiced by Hank Azaria), and Mr. Ambrose in Bob’s Burgers episode (“Y Tu Ga-Ga Tina Tambien”) (Voiced by Billy Eichner). Also of the non-human librarians in animation I have found so far, 13 are White men. Other White male librarians in webcomics include The Librarian in Detective Comics, Rupert Giles in Giles: Girl Blue, Skeezix in Guillotine Public Library, the Ghost in Library Ghost, Crawley in Library of Ruins, Rabbi Rava in Monolith, Marten Reed in Questionable Content, Lazurus Luca in Sword & Sphere, and Daniel in The Library.\n\nx\n\nIt should be commonly acknowledged that libraries are not neutral. Some people try and argue that they are neutral, which becomes an excuse for letting reactionary groups into libraries. Unsurprisingly, there is a close association of Whiteness and neutrality, while White patriarchal authority remains dominant in academia (and outside it), replicating itself in ways that “appear normal and benign”. [2] There are various librarians in animation, especially, which replicate this in one way or another. All the while, ideology of library neutrality in the real world has minimized, obscured, denied ways that librarians are activists in their libraries. This is connected with idea that politically committed librarianship is often misrepresented or feared as partisanship. [3]\n\nOne such library is a perfect example of neutrality: Wan Shi Tong (voiced by Hector Elizondo) in Legend of Korra and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Described as an “ancient, wise, and powerful spirit” by the Avatar Wiki, he collects information for the Spirit Library he runs, he remains all-knowing. He often boasts about his intelligence, even though he is indifferent to studying human technology after leaving the physical world. The same page says he has collected for the Spirit Library since its creation, allowing anyone access if they “brought some knowledge in return.” He still forbade any violent or destructive behavior or anything which “threatened the knowledge stored there.” He aligns himself with spirits above humans, however. In other ways, you could argue he is neutral, another word for someone who is impartial, nonaligned, and nonpartisan. It means those who do not incline or actively take either side. [4]\n\nThe fourth edition of Webster’s New World College Dictionary defines it as “not taking part” in either side of a quarrel or dispute. They also say belonging to, or having a characteristic of a nation not taking part in a war or not aligned with “either side in a power struggle.” They also say it can mean something that is indifferent, middling, and indefinite. [5] The Online Etymology Dictionary says the word has its origin in the mid-15th century from the Latin neutralis “of neuter gender” while the world neutrality comes from the late 15th century, meaning a “neutral attitude or position, the middle ground”. The latter comes from an Old French word, neutralite or directly from Medieval Latin neutralitatem or Latin neutralis. It meant a “state or condition of being unengaged in a dispute or contest between others” by the 1560s.\n\nIn some way you could argue he is “neutral” in human affairs, but aligned in others by siding with the spirits. However this view is faulty. In reality, the perspective that libraries or neutral, or pontificating about “free speech”, ends up supporting “toxic sludge”, reinforcing and undergirding White supremacist status quo. The founders of SRRT (Social Responsibility Round Table) of the ALA, attacked library neutrality as an excuse to avoid “confronting social justice”. Others have said that the appearance of neutrality is a red flag as with systems (and regimes) of hegemony and power at work. [6]\n\nPerhaps Wan agrees with those who see the library as a “neutral provider” with librarians help to help patrons find the data (and information) they need. This a possibility considering that the fox spirits, the knowledge seekers, gladly help patrons. On the other hand, he takes a distinct line against those promoting violence or destruction. That is akin to those who take a line in the sand against Nazis in their libraries, even if the ALA can’t be trusted to be on their side. He probably also recognizes the “violence of status quo discourse” in which language that is everyday and plain is the “language of domination” as a “language of daily epithets”. It becomes a language of “occupations and settlements…catastrophic pipeline projects, [and] of structure of profit inevitably dependent on labor exploitation”. [7]\n\nThere is more to neutrality than just one character in one series. Consider how Cletus Bookbinder in Rocky & Bullwinkle let a man with a gun come into his library and escort out, by gunpoint, two patrons which he considered as “problems.” As I said in the October 2021 post reviewing his character and the times he appears in the series, in one episode broken into various parts, he is clearly supporting censorship, just like Francis Clara Censordoll in Moral Orel. He is actively supporting oppression. There is no doubt in my mind that neutrality for libraries is not possible. As I wrote in that post, summarizing writing on the topic, libraries aren’t neutral in “fighting against White supremacy and systemic racism” and there are current (and historic) inequities are inherent in libraries, with librarians having their own internal biases. Some even said, which I quoted and summarized in that piece, said that libraries have benefited from a system that “privileges a dominant narrative” and experiences, and perspectives, of White people, coupled with a “history of systemic inequity and bias in collections, services, spaces, cataloging, and recruitment, and other library work.” Additional people said that libraries “hold power and privilege born from white supremacy culture.”\n\nOther librarians, who I quoted in that post, said that neutrality upholds inequality, and represents indifference toward marginalized communities, calling for more diversity in collections beyond that representing “a white, male, Christian, heteronormative worldview.” Some went further in saying that libraries contribute to ongoing colonization, are political (and liberal) institutions which are stabilize intellectual property itself, and rooted in ongoing Indigenous genocides. This includes organization of information to construct Whiteness as the “default, normal, civilized and everything else is Other”, with nina de jesus calling libraries (in Canada and the U.S.) as a “a tool of oppression, rather than of liberation”\n\nEven more direct, in terms of libraries not being neutral is the episode “Checked Out” of Too Loud. As I wrote in January 2022, one conclusion from the episode is that libraries, and librarians by extension aren’t neutral. Rather they are political institutions which are integrated into oppressive systems. In the case of this episode, they are not cooperating with the police directly but are enforcing rules on their own, ones that can be very restrictive indeed. More than anything, this library, and ones in animated series I’ve covered on this blog promotes the “neutrality” of White supremacy and capitalism which renowned librarian April Hathcock criticized in her last post, to-date, saying that the ALA stood for those values. [8]\n\nScholars apart from Hathcock, which I noted in my post in April about fictional library institutions which promote and invoke power, highlighting those in various animated series, [9] have said that cataloging, description, exhibitions, and collections are resistance to change. As a result, librarians spread, keep, and reproduce specific “values and regimes of knowledge”, including Whiteness, leading to non-neutral practices. This is reflected in collections some of which contain a “heavy legacy of colonialism”. There are some examples of this, beyond Censordoll who dips books in kerosene so they can be burned and throws away others said to be “objectionable.”\n\nThe librarian-soldiers of Library War, who are a manifestation of librarians who self-sacrifice, as they fight those who try and censor books, may think they are neutral. They might also think that the library is neutral and that the books they save will enlighten society. They would oppose those like Censordoll who is in favor of censorship no matter what. She is akin to recent efforts to ban books, stop sharing LGBTQ materials, and much more. So, in that sense, she is ahead of her time, but in a very terrifying way.\n\nMore realistic librarians would agree with what Stacie Williams, a librarian/activist/writer, said, that she pushed away the idea of neutrality because nothing about her lived experience as a Black librarian, “is neutral.” Others would go as far as to say that technocratic solutions for libraries can only claim to be neutral and objective due to Whiteness, while it upholds patriarchy, and it interconnected with White masculinity. After all, search engines aren’t neutral, so why would technocratic solutions be any different?\n\nIn the end, libraries are clearly not neutral, something recognized by anyone with sense. Those who reject this are supporting systems and regimes of oppression, plain and simple. I’ll leave you with this post for today and would be happy to expand on this topic in future posts on other series, films, comics, and whatnot. Until next week!\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

Some, like scholars Rose L. Chou and Anne Pho, editors of Pushing the Margins: Women of Color and Intersectionality in LIS have argued there has to be a conscious effort to move the profession from a white and feminized one to one that is feminist by actively elevating “women on the margins”. They further noted that women of color have not received the recognition they deserve, even though they have working in libraries for a long time. [2] This connects to the topic of this post: White male librarians. Interconnected to that is anti-racism discourse, and librarians of color. This is as pertinent to post this today as it is on the day I originally scheduled to post this, June 25. It is celebrated every year in Brazil as Mixed Race Day, honoring all mixed-race Brazilians, including caboclos. As such, let me get started!\n\nThere have been analyses in the past by librarians who have highlighted stereotypes of White male librarians who are often mean, resembling the image of spinster librarians, or even implied they are gay. Some have even proposed the problematic term of “guybrarian” which begs the question of what it it means, as it implies that librarians are “inherently female” as one commenter put it. Others have even proposed terms like “manbrarian”, “wombrarian”, “ladybrarians”, “librarymans”, “gaybrarian”, “libraryman” “lesbrarian”, and “librarienne”. Some pointed out the term “guybrarian” has sexist connotations. Other scholars pointed to stereotypical images of librarians in popular culture, including that these librarians are gay and said that the “absence of visible male librarians” may be a reason there are so few of them in the profession. [3] Of course, the latter somewhat misinformed opinion doesn’t take into account that the men are managers, despite the fact there are far fewer of them than women.\n\nMany of librarians described in this post promote White masculinity. The latter is a social formation, rather than something individual White men have. It is a form of domination which “recruits other forms of dominance and unmarkedness as well as Westerness, heterosexuality, cis-genderness, and middle-classness”. This is the case if even reportedly “appearance dissatisfaction among men” is on the rise. [4]\n\nThere are various White men who are prominently featured in animated series and are librarians. This includes Swampy in Phineas and Ferb and Archie the Archivist in Regular Show. Both of these characters appear in multiple episodes. However, Swampy is only a librarian in his debut episode. Other librarians of note include the unnamed one in the She-Ra: Princess of Power episode “Three Courageous Hearts”, the aptly named Cletus Bookbinder in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends who appears in one episode which is broken into various parts, and Stewart Goodson in Emilio Estevez’s independent film, The Public. Last but not least is Barebones in the webcomic, Brownie and Barebones, who is also a dragon. His supervisor, Anthony, also a White man, is gay and in love with a handsome knight, Derek.\n\nLet me start with Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, who is also known as Sherman, and voiced by Steve Zahn. Described on his fandom page as a former drummer of a 1980s band, he becomes a “male librarian as failure”, which Jennifer Snoek-Brown defines as those who are suggestive of flaws in the library, implying that only “failures” would decide to work there. Such librarians are, as she puts it, “uncomfortable in social/outside world situations”. We don’t get much time to see the library where he works, but the staff he works alongside are two elderly White women. This supports the reality that librarianship remains one of the Whitest professions, with demographics which have “hardly shifted over the last generation”. This results in a system of exclusion for people of color through the normativity of Whiteness. [5]\n\nSwampy has relative privilege, as he can pick up and leave his job as a librarian, and begin again as a rock star. What will happen to the fellow librarians he is working with, or the patrons? This is never explained, as he is whisked away in one of the show’s classic musical numbers which claims the library has a carpet from the 80s, right in the middle of shelving library books. The song is set up in such a way that its almost like the patrons are cheering him leaving.\n\nThis ability to pick up and leave has a parallel to the legacies of librarianship. Specifically that colonialism, racism, class oppression, patriarchy, and other forms of oppression are integrated into libraries, while the embedded (and) normal nature of racism is rarely challenged, not even in library science literature. Furthermore, the Whiteness continues to distinguish and define the profession, due to barriers along the away of typical professional library careers. At the same time, the oppressive and inequitable power dynamics of society are replicated within libraries themselves. [6]\n\nAs for Swampy, considering the makeup of the town as seen so far in the series, he probably rarely thinks about race. He probably doesn’t think much about diversity either, and doesn’t think of how he is part of the “dominant culture” of Whiteness. He doesn’t have the expectation of exemplifying or conforming dominant culture foisted upon him, which asks leaders to “effectively and imperceptibly perform” Whiteness. This leads to significant emotional labor as people struggle to remain compliant but have, in academic libraries, a “compelling academic persona” in order to gain credibility. [7]\n\nIt is different for Archie the Archivist in Regular Show. A de-facto archivist, he is also a laser guardian and he works in the library. His fandom page describes him as a”tall human that has grey/brown hair and a mustache” who wears glasses and a suit. Weirdly, his name isn’t even revealed in the episode and is only mentioned in the credits. His character exemplifies the power of Whiteness, which affords specific advantages to specific people and centers their existence. This is especially the case when the power of White people is threatened”. As a White person, he has significant power in determining what ideologies he supports and what voices he validates. [8]\n\nThe same could be said for the unnamed librarian, voiced by George DiCenzo in She-Ra: Princess of Power. Described by Wiki Greyskull as a minor character from the series who oversees a library in the Valley of the Lost, with very few visiting over the years. He even manages the Inner Library, equivalent to a special collections, which has books written in a language that has been far-forgotten. The original script of his episode apparently identified him as being named “Heron” and saying he was a hermit. The librarian’s voice actor also voiced Bow and Salisticar in the episode, interestingly enough.\n\nIt is hard to say if this librarian is using his role to disrupt power structures that privilege people like himself. Surely, as I noted in my August 2020 post reviewing the one and only episode he appears in, he is helpful to the protagonists, trying to fulfill their information needs. But how much is he recognizing his privilege? If he was a real-life librarian who was in the same situation it would be hard to say whether he would ally with librarians of color to disrupt White supremacist power structures which “disadvantage people of color”. Would be commit to “difficult personal work” that forces people to address ways in which they “perpetuate systems of white supremacy.” Would be critically reflect on his social positions, how his race, class, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, gender, and so on, intersect, and contextualize that within his experience “within the constructs of society”? [9] Its hard to say. But, in this series, he is helpful to patrons, but does nothing to disrupt the existing power structure. He is completely comfortable with where he is, even though the library itself is in the Valley of the Lost, a “mysterious and dark location” where nothing ever returns, according to Wiki Greyskull.\n\nThis makes him different from other librarians, in the sense that he is in a fantasy world that doesn’t really resemble our own. He isn’t in a world that could be comfortably imagined within the existing one. Cletus Bookworm in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is one such character who appears in a world which is not far from reality. In the episode he lets Rocky and Bullwinkle be kidnapped in the library at gun-point, treating them as problem patrons who need to be “taken care of” more or less. If Rocky and Bullwinkle had been Black people, instead of a fox and a moose, he may have been even harsher. If that had been the case, he would be playing into racist dynamics which make it seem that racism is localized and isolated rather than part of a structure which “governs virtually all aspects of our lives”. [10]\n\nIn contrast to any of the librarians mentioned in this blog as of yet is Stewart Goodson in Emilio Estevez’s independent film, The Public. Like his fellow librarians, he wears simple clothes. He is a librarian at the Cincinnati Library and is not sure about homeless people using the library as a shelter. Apart from his portrayal seemingly failing the Librarian Portrayal Test as he is not shown much beyond beyond a librarian, also an atypical one, he later changes his mind. He joins the homeless patrons and sits with them in protest. In this, he stands against, at first, the Black library supervisor, Mr. Anderson, played by Jeffrey Wright, who later joins in as well. The library becomes a safe space of sorts by the end, despite some consternation. Anderson becomes a “hero” who saves the library from “villains” by the end, standing up for his fellow workers.\n\nThe Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library system has over 40 locations and millions of items. In its collection development policy they recognize that the Hamilton County and the City of Cincinnati population in the last couple decades has become “more racially, ethnically, and economically diverse.” Even so, there remain fines and fees in place, and rules against using “profane, obscene, abusive language”. Also prohibited is “deliberate repeated behavior that is intimidating, hostile, offensive, or adversely impacts staff work performance” and there are somewhat strict meeting room guidelines. Their page on hiring says they an “equal opportunity employer” which is committed to “building a diverse and dynamic workforce…responsive to the needs of our community” and that they would recruit and hire the most qualified applicant without “regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, disability, national origin, ancestry, military status, creed or any other legally protected status.” They also tout their “attractive benefits package” for anyone who wants to work at the library. [11]\n\nThis language reflects what some call the “common-sense language” or racial liberalism, including words like “diversity”. This can cause White supremacist dynamics to be extended while obscuring complex operations behind generally accepted, innocuous, and progressive conceptual frameworks. Furthermore, this results in an individualism of racism becoming an “attribute of individuals” and anti-racism as a form of “self-work” with the problem and solution “collocated and contained”. This discourse further leads to racism not being treated as a societal problem but as a personal failing of specific institutions. This causes any necessary work for building anti-racist librarianship to be lacking, while any work to “illuminate or untangle injustice” is incomplete and interdependent. [12]\n\nOther scholars, like Melissa Kalpin Prescott, have argued that here are important discussions about the invisible normality of Whiteness in library profession. As such, Prescott argued that White librarians need to develop anti-racist analysis and apply it to librarianship. They’ve further said that this anti-racism requires the development of a critical consciousness of one’s racial identity and racialization to “dismantle racist systems through activism.” This also requires uncovering how internalized racial superiority and internalized racial oppression “work together to maintain and perpetuate institutional racism”. These same scholars have argued that anti-racism can address ways that intersectionality can compound effects of societal power differentials. This means that someone who experiences gender oppression (like a woman) could still have “unearned advantages” in many parts of their life, as would be the case for a White woman, for example. [13]\n\nFurthermore, it can be said that having anti-racist views requires recognizing how racism is embedded into institutions and social systems to “maintain power and privilege for whites”. After all, people of color and White people are socialized into their “appropriate” racial roles through “persistent messages” from media, schools, families, churches, healthcare, government, and other institutions. As a result, White people internalize messages that they “worked hard” to earn the “social and economic privileges” that they possess. To counter this is required, according to Prescott, unlearning racism, even while in “inherently racist systems and institutions” and recognizing that internalized racial superiority can undermine anti-racist “work, alienate others, and hinder our process toward a positive white racial identity.”\n\nIt also necessitates realizing that experiences of people of color can be unknowingly invalidated by adopting a “white savior” mentality. This presumes that people of color need or want White people to fix racial inequities “for them” and lack the ability to “enact positive changes in their lives.” At the same it can involve dissociating oneself from other White people who “demonstrate overt racial prejudices or who don’t share an anti-racist analysis”. While Prescott said this is “highly problematic” as members of White society, especially anti-racist White allies have a responsibility to “engage in critical conversations with other white people”, this ignores the current reality. [14] If someone were to take her words to heart, it would involve trying to “convince” neo-fascists, White nationalists, Christian reactionaries, or other like people to not be racist. That is not only unlikely, but it can become dangerous. Critical conversations are important. However, having them with people who will clearly not listen and are ingesting propaganda like no one’s business, from a variety of reactionary sources, will get no one anywhere and is a waste of one’s time.\n\nThis brings me to my last two librarians that I’ll examine in this post: Barebones and his supervisor, Anthony, in Brownie and Barebones. Barebones works at his local community library somewhere in the UK, but he dislikes his boss, who is continually annoyed that he is late. However he still helps him, especially when his boss is in a pinch. when his friend Brownie’s cakes come to life and wreak havoc in the library. He gets Derek out of the there and events that follow result in him being saved by hunky firefighters, the first hint at his gay identity.\n\nAt the same time, Barebones has perhaps one of the worst work ethics and morality. I say this because he is shown stealing books in the library for himself (he claims he will later return them) and he continually annoys his boss. This includes bringing a metal detector to one day and often causing messes in the library. He also ignores those messes caused by others, like Derek. Barebone’s views are not without merit as Anthony is not a friend of Brownie and dislikes her.\n\nDespite it all, Barebones unintentionally brings a knight named Derek back from their imaginary world, a man who Anthony falls in love with. Both characters are happy together, with Derek even occasionally coming to the library, and knowing the identity of Barebones as a dragon. In some way this can be said to connect with those who use words like “anti-oppression” instead of diversity in order to name systems of oppression which “contribute to hostile work environments for librarians and staff of color.” It also relates to those who believe that anti-racist librarianship should consider each person as a complex individual rather than an “identity category” while considering how gender, race, sexuality, disability, and other identities contribute to experiences of privilege and oppression. [15]\n\nIt further relates to those who argue the necessity of assembling a “personal toolkit” of anti-racist practices with like-minded librarians, and that showing up is the first step of supporting social justice. This comes with the caveat that even if you are going to screw up, that shouldn’t dissuade you, but you should “do the work”. [16] The same could be the case for countering LGBTQ discrimination and homophobia. The latter would be important for Anthony, especially when it came to organizations like the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table of the ALA (now named the Rainbow Round Table or RRT for short), which focused on improving “library service and information access for gay and lesbian library users,” and professional needs of lesbian and gay librarians like job discrimination. However, antipathy to gay issues within the profession is “by no means dormant” even as the RRT prides itself as the first professional gay organization in the U.S., and some say the world. [17]\n\nAnthony would be right at home with the RRT, or the LGBTQ histories of the British Library. After all, there was even a LGBTQ+ Archives, Libraries, Museums and Special Collections (ALMS) conference held in the UK in 2016 and a new museum in London called Queer Britain, said to be first national LGBTQ museum in the UK. However, there are still some librarians who are nervous about loaning out LGBTQ materials in the UK, although most are positive. Some, like John Vincent, have even studied the “reasons for hostility and hatred” against LGBTQ people in the UK, in books like LGBT People and the UK Cultural Sector.\n\nWithout any more characters to add this time, I’m bringing this post to a close. With that, comments are welcome. Look forward to next week’s post which will be about reference librarianship in fiction.\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

The scene goes on until 1:07:43, with Tate asking people in the crowd to shout “we will conform” at the top of their\n\nlungs while the music swells, saying they must follow the example of Steven Shorter (played by Paul Jones) who comes to the stage. This film can be said to have parallels to the rise of the religious right in the U.S., with the former traitorous president having rallies just like this, to whoop people into a frenzy. The rally itself has echoes of Nazi rallies, which is undoubtedly intentional on the part of Watkins. Some called the film “quite prescient and influential” and “sharp, funny, and well-made satire“. Others described it as tapping “into the sinister possibilities of the growing celebrity culture”, and noted that Vanessa Ritchie (Jean Shrimpton) pushes Shorter to “question his obedience to his manipulative handlers.” It is also noted at the end of the film, Steven makes an outburst is “met with stunned horror, and he is denounced by the State, the Church, and the conformist audience.”\n\n[2] Chou, Rose L. and Anne Pho, “Introduction” in Pushing the Margins: Women of Color and Intersectionality in LIS (ed.

Later pages (90) talk about great progress in “the quantity and quality of historical and biographical studies in lesbigay history over the past quarter-century” but also says, on page 91, that “gay literature and gay studies have received uneven treatment” and states there is “recent evidence of a backlash” against such studies. On page 92, he notes that there is a lack of leadership by the ALA “in bringing gays and lesbian issues into the grand design of the organization” and what he calls, on page 93, “mothball outing” which means “outing” since-dead historical personages as gay even if they didn’t say so directly themselves. The whole article is worth a read. This includes his statement on page 99 that “before gay librarians and archivists clean up the whole palace of history, they have to air their own rooms.”\n\nToday is World Refugee Day which celebrates and honors refugees around the world on June 20 every year. Since the day includes mention of conflict and persecution refugees face, it somewhat relates is the role of libraries in perpetrating oppression. This is shown in fiction, like in the film J. Edgar, the series Avatar: The Last Airbender, Too Loud, DC Super Hero Girls, Mysticons, Steven Universe, Teamo Supremo, Moral Orel, Spy x Family, and many others.\n\nIt is little known but J. Edgar Hoover, the infamous director of the FBI, worked as a cataloger for the Library of Congress between 1913 and 1917. The skills he used there shaped the FBI and the filing system he implemented at the bureau, with his work for LOC leaving a “lasting impression” on him, as he took a job as a clerk at the Department of Justice in July 1917. [1] Some have even penned posts with titles like “How J. Edgar Hoover Used the Power of Libraries for Evil”. Although I haven’t seen the whole 2011 film, J. Edgar, the film undoubtedly has a library scene where Hoover, played by Leonardo DeCaprio, goes through the card catalogs of the Library of Congress with Annie, a girl he likes, finding a book about time, and reveals how he will use the system as a way to identify all Americans. This plan is not successful as she rejects him, he asks what she sees as a flaw in his character and she never answers that directly, saying her work comes before marriage. However, she still becomes his personal secretary.\n\nIn a voice over at the end of the scene he says “I helped organize that library just as I did with the Bureau”, claiming that many said it wasn’t needed, and declares he is an innovator. Jennifer Snoek-Brown notes that several biographers believe that if Hoover had stayed at the Library of Congress, he would have “eventually become the head librarian” and absence of a library degree wouldn’t have mattered. She also quotes a Seattle Times review of the film noting that Hoover is “thrilled by the organization of the card catalog.” Currently the film is on Snoek-Brown’s “Master List of English-Language Films” but it does not appear she has watched the film as of yet.\n\nThe screenplay includes lines where Hoover says he is going to show I’m gonna show Annie his “old card catalog system at the Library of Congress” and notes his mind thinking of a system where everyone could be tracked by a specific number, telling Annie,\n\nNow imagine if every citizen in this country were uniquely identifiable… by their own card and number, say, the pattern on their fingers. Imagine how quickly we could find them if they committed a crime.\n\nThis would worry anyone who cared about government overreach, civil rights and liberties, government surveillance and the like. But, his idea is based on the card catalogs which he describes as every item assigned an index card with a unique code, indicating the title, author, topic, and location. He boasts that “what used to take days to locate now only takes a matter of minutes.”\n\nThis has become a problem in actual libraries, like those using LexisNexis, which is funneling information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even more than ever before. In early 2021, LexisNexis signed a contract worth over $22 million with ICE, providing them with billions of private records, allowing them to conduct raids, deportations, and arrests on a huge scale. It allows them to profit more than it costs them, according to recent reports, so they have no intention of changing course.\n\nThis is related to libraries and librarians in film, television, and novels, with librarians as, two scholars, Gary P. Radford and Marie L. Radford, put it, positioned as “formidable gatekeeper between order and chaos” while the library is other-worldly and a cathedral, the user humiliated, surveillance reining supreme, and consequences from “disrupting the sacred order of texts”. These scholars add that outside of a discourse of fear, these representations of libraries “would not be recognizable as libraries or librarians at all.” [2]\n\nThere is one example in popular culture that comes to mind immediately as an example of this: Wan Shi Tong in Legend of Korra and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Since I’ll focused on Wan’s role in the former series in last week’s post, this week I’ll focus on his role in the the latter series and its connection to what I have pointed out so far. First of all, Samantha Cross of Pop Archives says that Wan is one of her favorite characters, a giant owl spirit who collects information, knowledge, and specimens for the Spirit Library, bringing the library from the spirit world into the human world so knowledge can be shared. He believes that humanity was not responsible with the knowledge, so he bans humans from using the library if they have violent or evil intentions. In the episode “The Library”, according to Cross, Sokka loudly declares that the library’s knowledge caused the Fire Nation to be defeated, leading Wan to attack him and the group. They all flee and the library sinks “back into the spirit world.” [3]\n\nMarie of Pop Goes the Librarian has a different take. She notes they only find the library (which has been buried for centuries) because a knowledge seeker, aka a fox spirit, is entering the library through an opening in the desert sand. Even with all of that, the fox spirits still do their duties, serving Wan with acquisitions and public services. Later, he lets them use the library but says anything they find can’t aid them in the war against the Fire Nation. The protagonists go against these rules and Wan shuts everything down, pulling the library from the human world, resulting in the loss of all the knowledge. [4] Wan is exemplifies the scary librarian trope, and is in charge of a “spooky silent library” as some trope sites describe it.\n\nWhen I watched the episode, I realized that Marie and Cross were right. Aang, Sokka, and Katara all promised to not use the knowledge of the library for ill ends after Wan mentions Zuko doing that years earlier, and they give something to Wan for his collections, to prove they are scholars. At one point, Sokka boasts that he fooled Wan. While at first it may seem that he is the only one doing something wrong, as he is pocketing library materials after all, this proves to not be the case. They find that the Fire Nation destroyed the part of their collections, but they have the materials Sokka stole to guide them. Thanks to this, they learn how to defeat the Fire Nation.\n\nWhat this means is that Team Avatar (Katara, Aang, and Sokka) betrayed Wan’s trust. He is not happy about this, calling out Sokka, rightly so, for using the knowledge for destructive ends. In response he tries to defend his knowledge and make sure they won’t escape, vowing to never share what the library has to offer by sinking it into the ground. Luckily for them, Toph realized the library was collapsing, and saved them all. All in all, this means that Aang, Katara, and Sokka were willing to fool Wan the whole time. Not surprisingly, they escape, but the professor who came with them stays (he is later shown in the Legend of Korra episode which features the library but is just a pile of bones), while the library sinks into the Earth.\n\nWan is the embodiment of libraries wanting to be neutral. He is refusing to take part in the war on the surface among humans and does not want to be drawn into it. His actions in Avatar: The Last Airbender have a great impact on what happens in The Legend of Korra. In his mind, since the Avatar, and his friends, took advantage of him before, why would he trust an emissary of the Avatar (then Korra), Jinora? While I still believe Wan was wrong to let Jinora be kidnapped by Unaloq, leading to additional trauma for Korra, it makes sense, from his perspective, why he did this. He is a spirit, and he sides with spirits, above humans, showing he is not neutral at all. As I said in my previous article, he values, and favors, spirits as more valuable and more important than humans. However, for all the attempts to avoid connections to systems of oppression, he creates his own restrictive rules, and cannot completely remove himself from the outside world, which he is connected to, whether he likes it or not.\n\nIn terms of real-life libraries, many have connections to carceral systems and library workers replicate “carceral behavior through care.” Others have pointed out that anti-racist strategies of libraries has inhibited “meaningful treatment of racism as a structural phenomenon” while focus on diversity in terms of demographic inclusion and “individual behavioural competence” has left little room in librarianship for “substantive engagement with race as a historically contingent phenomenon.” Additional articles noted that the 9/11 hijackers used public libraries to talk with their co-conspirators, and defined library anxiety. In the latter case it was defined as a fear of using libraries, and said to be a psychological barrier which “impedes academic achievement and the development of information literacy“. Some even noted that libraries were associated with terms like pornography, censorship, and filters. [5]\n\nPutting aside those fictional libraries with clear restrictions, there’s a book jail shown in “Checked Out” episode of Too Loud. In the episode, Desiree declares that the librarian rules with an “iron fist,” coming in and repossessing books by force. She says they need to think about the “sanctity of library property” I concluded, in my post about the episode back in January 2022, that the episode shows how libraries can be punitive in terms of efforts to protect their property and noted the episode showcases the interconnection of these efforts with the criminal legal system, which is embodied by the book jail. I still think that is a fair interpretation that the episode as criticizing this punitive nature of libraries and have a “dark side”. It could also be saying that libraries are not neutral. In fact, the NYPL has jobs such as “Investigator“, along with others focused on cybersecurity, library security, and others who protect library “staff, patrons and library assets” in the words of one job description.\n\nOther librarians also reinforce systems of oppression. Take the spinster librarians in DC Super Hero Girls and Star Wars as examples, or the curmudgeonly (strict) librarian named Mr. Snellson in Mysticons, as opposed to other librarians who fulfill stereotypes. At other times, librarians are hauled away. Take the elderly White female librarian in the first episode of Zevo-3. Her only words are identifying herself as a librarian and saying she is bad with technology, while she is arrested for illegal acts she didn’t commit, because the protagonist uses a school library connection to beat the villains who run New Eden City, which is filled with mutated animals. But, he does nothing to help the library. She has to be the only librarian, I know of, who is shown being arrested on screen. Instead, we have librarians in positions of authority.\n\nConsider Turtle Princess in Adventure Time, who shushes the protagonists, the unnamed librarian in Steven Universe, or another in The Owl House. All of them are almost set pieces, shushing people, and have no role beyond enforcing library rules. Others are more active, like the librarian in Big City Greens who will not tolerate any sound in the library and goes to extreme measures to keep it that way, Miss Dickens in Carl Squared who demands that Carl bring back stolen books before nightfall. She sadistically takes his library card, puts in a blender, and drinks it! Just as bad is the librarian who imposes an excessive fine in Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ms. Hatchet in Kim Possible who creates her own over-complicated classification system, the strict shusher in The Replacements, the sadistic librarian in Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil, or Rita Book in Timon & Pumbaa who will tolerate no sound. [6] Others are straight-up evil, like Libro Shushman who steals words from all the books with her Dictionary of Doom in an episode of Teamo Supremo, or Francis Clara Censordoll in Moral Orel who is just as rabid as current reactionaries, wanting to censor any book or material that is “inappropriate” and burning books she doesn’t like.\n\nMany of these librarians would probably favor current technology reportedly resistant to vandals and weather, designed to prevent “unwanted materials” from ending a library. Some, like Cletus Bookbinder, who let someone kidnap two of his patrons at gunpoint in an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle. These librarians who acquiesce to systems of oppression, or even enforce it, are not limited to Western animation. Take for example Sumireko Sanshokunin, a.k.a. “Pansy”, in Oresuki, who acts like the library is her own private domain. Just as bad, in another way, is an unnamed nurse (acting as a librarian) in an episode of Spy x Family who hates that someone is reading manga in a library, even though the manga is available in the library itself. The same could be said for the unnamed library supervisor in I Lost My Body, a White woman who has no voice actor, as she has no lines in the series.\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

She says the former notion creates the expectation that when libraries fail, it is the “fault of individuals failing to live up to the ideals of the profession,” rather than the fact that libraries are fundamentally flawed institutions. Since today is the World Day Against Child Labour, it makes sense to publish this today, in the sense that the labor of librarians is often tied up in the ideals of librarianship, even though there is no child labor, to my knowledge, in libraries.\n\nThere are certainly many librarians who are shown as passionate about their work, whether the old librarian in a She-Ra: Princess of Power episode (“Three Courageous Hearts”), the unnamed librarian in Sofia the First episode (“Forever Royal”?), the librarian in Sarah and Duck episode (“Lost Librarian”), Harold in Craig of the Creek, and even Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, to name a few. Arguably, the only series I can think of, apart from Moral Orel, which portrays libraries as institutions which are fundamentally flawed, is arguably The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends as Cletus Bookbinder willingly sides with censorship and lets an armed vigilante take away the two protagonists without objecting. In fact, he agrees with them being taken away, declaring they are making too much noise. More on Cletus later on in this post, as what he does continues to be relevant.\n\nThis reminds me of an August 2006 episode of Totally Spies! In the beginning of the episode, Alex, Clover, and Sam are listening to music together in the school library but are loud. They end up annoying other students, one of whom even shushes them. This doesn’t stop them from talking and they continue to do so, until they are whisked away.\n\nAlex, Clover, and Sam recognize, as library patrons, the idea that libraries represent an “underused oasis”. It is a place provides access to information of a significant quality, a democratic space where people can read that they can’t read elsewhere. Some have argued that libraries can even given power to communities, dubbing it “information power”, which helps people learn more about their lives, and disseminate information to further struggle for “increasing social justice”. Others have said there is an importance of trust in libraries. [1]\n\nBeyond this, there are lofty ideals hoisted upon librarians, whether that they should meet “vital needs” of librarians, be “information interpreters” by being advocates and active consultants of community groups. This includes librarians making libraries a space for gathering materials, future historical inquiries, and truth-seeking initiatives. [2] In some ways, the elderly White female librarian (voiced by Candi Milo) in the My Life as a Teenage Robot, embodies this, as she is shown working in bookmobile. She provides services to the neighborhood.\n\nThe aforementioned librarian in Totally Spies! undoubtedly has middle-class values. Some have written that these values cause libraries to be out of their depth, led some to critique White middle-class librarianship in and of itself, or talked about librarians doing their duty. Additional articles focus on linear productivity nodes that “undergirds capitalist exchanges”, intersectuality, neoliberal university, multiculturalism, and a world in which inequalities are growing. [3]\n\nSome of this is manifested in librarians in literature, some of whom internalize the stereotypical librarian, one of whom is a spinster, and others who go beyond the stereotypical mold. In some cases, this librarian image is positive with the fictional librarians helping ensure intellectual freedom for society. This differs from those prim, meek, and unassuming librarians with hair buns, portrayed to be suspicious, whether they are a positive or negative character. Take, for example, Mary Hatch (voiced by Donna Reed) in It’s a Wonderful Life, who was able to devote time to being a librarian and enforce “rules of silence” when not being married to George Bailey (voiced by Jimmy Stewart). Her life as a spinster librarian is shown to be less desirable than her life as a wife and mother in the real world. This contrasts with videos on YouTube created by librarians, with 68% having librarians as heroes, 23% as parody, and 14% as fun or positive. [4] Such videos provide a way for librarians to counter stereotypes of the profession.\n\nAt the same time, as fictional librarians embody the ideals of the profession, it should be recognized that stereotypical librarians never actually existed, en masse, in the library profession. They have become symbols, shorthands, whether they appear in comic books, comic strips, films, and novels. This includes well-known ones in Party Girl, Ghostbusters, Foul Play, Soylent Green, Citizen Kane, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In the latter film is one of the most hilarious library scenes ever on film, as Indiana Jones is putting a hole in the floor of the library while the librarian is slamming his stamp down. Through the whole thing he remains unaware that Indiana is breaking through the floor! He thinks the stamp has something wrong with it. [5] While you could say this comes with it the stereotype that the librarian is outdated and old, the film is set in 1938/1939, so it makes sense he would be using a stamp at that time, as computers hadn’t even come into existence at that time. In fact, the first automatic digital computer was not created until 1941, named Z3, and created by the Germans, although the U.S. Navy had developed electromagnetic computers for submarines starting in 1938.\n\nThis film, unfortunately, has all sorts of Arab stereotypes. There’s “unsightly” Egyptian Christians, a pro-Nazi sheikh. This includes Egyptians in fezzes chasing Indy, some even trying to burn him alive. There is even a famous chase scene through Venice’s canals. Even worse are the pro-Nazi Arabs, Egyptian Christians made to look fanatical and are never humanized. For some reason, even though Indy and the Egyptian Christians are on the same side, and against the Nazis, this is not shown in the film. At the same time, a European Christian knight is guarding the Holy Grail like saint. Indy’s Egyptian friend, Sallah, is also patronized as a “dumbbell” although he warns Indy about the German tank out to get him. [6]\n\nAs op culture isn’t always kind to librarians,” noting a few librarians in TV and film. Glazer and many others have made lists of librarians, whether in science fiction, fantasy, or in various mediums, sometimes even noting librarian cameos, asked why librarians are portrayed as “mean” characters. [7] One person, Marie of Pop! Goes the Librarian even pointed to a spirit owl-librarian Wan Shi Tong (voiced by Héctor Elizondo) in Avatar: The Last Airbender and Legend of Korra, as one such example. She declares that his ancient library is amazing, that fox spirits assist patrons locate information, serving as public services and acquisitions staff members. She goes onto say that while he the “worst example” of a librarian as he is spiteful, mean, territorial, and single-minded, having an innate distrust of humans, with his main concern being protection and collection of knowledge, making him like an archivist. She adds this means he may dislike rare materials from the library getting in the “wrong hands” and then in “anyone’s hands”.\n\nReviewing the episode “A New Spiritual Age” she notes that Tong is even more hostile to humans, including Jinora, the granddaughter of Aang, who she is able to offer new knowledge in exchange and stay in the library. This gets worse as he is in league with the enemy of Korra, her uncle Unalaq. She adds that the library of Wan Shi Tong and the library itself is an “incredible story”, calling him a fan-favorite character, as he wants nothing more “than to cultivate a mass of knowledge and keep it safe” with a thirst for knowledge which makes him “lower his guard twice” and when he does, his belief in the “folly of human-kind is reinforced.” She seems to defend his actions, saying that he may be mean, old, and evil, but also tired.\n\nThis differs from Sam Cross of Pop Archives. [8] She describes, like Marie, how Jinora gets into the library, noting she offers to explain how a radio works. While she gets in, it turns out that Wan sided with Unalaq, claiming that Unalaq, who wants to free the dark spirits, because he cares about spirits while “Korra has shown no such interest.” Cross argues that he is Wan is interesting because he is a “spirit of contradictions”, not wanting knowledge in his library being used for ill-purposes, but doesn’t attempt to provide context, doesn’t do his own follow-up or research. Instead, he claims he is neutral, in Cross’s words, but actually favors those who see “spirits as more valuable or important than humans.” He is, in the words of Cross, “the smartest spirit ever”, and ends up being a spirit which is unnerving, yet familiar, able to provide “access to knowledge” and possibly bite your head off like “real archivists/librarians/curators” in her words.\n\nI have a different take on Wan. While I understand what Marie and Cross are saying, he seems akin to the strict librarians I often talk about in this blog. He declares humans can no longer enter the library, he says that the last human stayed there to read, grew old and died. He sets down ground rules for Jinora, saying she can look around, but can’t break anything. Although a fox spirit helps her, she is later betrayed by him. When he sides with Unalaq it is just like the librarian Cletus Bookbinder letting Rocky and Bullwinkle be taken out of his library at gunpoint. We as the audience know that Unalaq is bad news, but due to the fact that Wan has walled himself off from everything, he has no idea of Unalaq’s true nature. The fact that he lets her be kidnapped and taken away is wrong on so many levels. What Cross and Marie are saying has a sense of truth, but it also is not recognizing the severity of the situation and how Wan is condoning a crime! What he allows to happen leads to further trauma for Korra.\n\nHis character proves the point of Alison Nastasi: that the librarian is “one of the most misunderstood figures in pop culture history,” noting various “negative, unflattering, and downright laughable images of librarians” that have inundated our society. This is especially the case when it comes to stereotypical representations of female librarians in pop culture, which Christina Niegel argues are rooted in the “gendered history of the profession” and social norms producing expectations about “service work as an extension of the caring and organizing work of women.” Such stereotypes are emblematic of the difference between real-life librarians and those in fiction, a disparity “between reality and fantasy” as Darlynn Nemitz puts it. Fictional librarians convey a certain meaning, even in more positive depictions like Barbara Gordon a.k.a. Batgirl, who many find inspiring. [9] The same can even be said for the unnamed Black male librarian in All the President’s Men.\n\nAll these depictions have a real-life impact. Some have even argued that librarian stereotypes and perceptions may be holding back library instruction, while others related fictional librarians to real life information behaviors of patrons. Additional pieces noted stereotypes in young adult literature, said that some fictional librarians can be good sleuths, or pointed to other depictions of librarians in fantasy and sci-fi, to name a few genres. This fiction differs from reality. Characters like Sam’s mom in Totally Spies, may say that librarians are a “safe” career option, but the reality is very different. [10]\n\nIn Canada, the U.S., and elsewhere, there is a continued need to rely on precious work to maintain their workforces. This is coupled with maintaining systemic barriers to those with disabilities. How can someone enforce the much-exalted “core values” of the profession, if your job is precarious? [11] The answer is that you can’t. Some librarians in fiction are shown as equivalent to precarious, like those experiencing burnout. Most prominently, apart from the blue-skinned librarian in Prisoner Zero, is Kaisa in Hilda, who is shown as exhausted at one point. I can’t think of any librarian in fiction whose labor is contingent, is precarious, but hopefully that changes in the future. That’s my hope at least. Until the next post.\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.
