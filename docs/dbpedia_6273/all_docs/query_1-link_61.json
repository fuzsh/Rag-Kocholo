The animated characters Rocky and Bullwinkle shared the screen with live actors portraying Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro), Boris Badenov (Jason Alexander), Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo), and FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo).[1]\n\nThis film is also notable for its ensemble cast featuring guest appearances by Billy Crystal, Janeane Garofalo, Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman, David Allen Grier, Kenan Thompson, Kel Mitchell, Don Novello, Jon Polito, Carl Reiner, Taraji P. Henson and Jonathan Winters, along with many fourth wall breakages.\n\nReleased in 2000, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle was the third film in four years to have been a Jay Ward cartoon adaptation (George of the Jungle (1997), and Dudley Do-Right (1999) having preceded it).\n\nContents\n\n1 Plot\n\n2 Cast\n\n3 Songs\n\n4 Reception\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nPlot\n\n1964 saw the cancellation of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show and life became rather miserable and melancholy for Rocket \"Rocky\" J. Squirrel (voiced by June Foray, reprising her longtime role) and Bullwinkle J. Moose (voiced by Keith Scott). Their home, Frostbite Falls, has been destroyed in deforestation, Rocky has lost his ability to fly, and the show's unseen Narrator (also voiced by Keith Scott) lives with his mother, spending his time narrating everything that she does (much to her annoyance). Bullwinkle and Rocky head out to address the President of the United States regarding their situation, but are stopped for six months by red tape. Meanwhile, their enemies, Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov, and Natasha Fatale lose power over Pottsylvania and dig to a Hollywood film studio where they convince Minnie Mogul (Janeane Garofalo), an executive, to sign a contract giving her rights to the show, and the villains are transformed from their two-dimensional cel animation origins, and become live-action characters (now in the form of Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, and Rene Russo, respectively). FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) and her boss, Cappy von Trapment (Randy Quaid) inform President Signoff (James Rebhorn) that Fearless Leader intends to make himself the President by brainwashing the American public with his television company, \"RBTV\" or \"Really Bad Television\". Karen is sent to a special lighthouse to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle to the real world. She succeeds, the Narrator being brought along as well but never being physically seen.\n\nFearless Leader is informed of Rocky and Bullwinkle's return and sends Boris and Natasha to destroy them. The two take a laptop with them called the CDI which can specifically destroy CGI-animated cartoon characters, and send them to the Internet. Karen manages to steal their truck after they drive her car off a cliff, but she is then arrested by the Oklahoma state police when Natasha claims to be Karen. Natasha and Boris steal a helicopter to pursue Rocky and Bullwinkle. Rocky and Bullwinkle are given a ride by Lewis (Kenan Thompson) and Martin (Kel Mitchell), two students at Bullwinkle's old university, Wossamotta U. Boris and Natasha get there first, and make a large donation to the university in Bullwinkle's name. In return, the head of the university gives Bullwinkle an honorary \"Mooster's Degree\", and Bullwinkle addresses the student body, whilst Boris attempts to kill him with the CDI upon the water tower which they built in the park. Rocky recovers his lost ability to fly and saves the oblivious Bullwinkle. Martin and Lewis lend the two their car, but Bullwinkle goes on a wild ride through Chicago. Boris and Natasha once again attempt to kill the two but instead destroy their helicopter. Karen escapes prison with help from a lovestruck Swedish guard named Ole.\n\nKaren, Rocky, and Bullwinkle are reunited but then arrested and put on trial. However the presiding Judge Cameo (Whoopi Goldberg) dismisses their case upon recognizing Rocky and Bullwinkle. The three then obtain an old biplane from a man named Old Jeb (Jonathan Winters), and escape Boris and Natasha again. Boris and Natasha consider quitting their evil occupations and getting married, but then Fearless Leader calls on the phone. Afraid to admit they failed, they lie to Fearless Leader that they killed Rocky and Bullwinkle. Meanwhile, the plane the heroes fly in is unable to fly with all three aboard. Rocky flies Karen to New York City to stop Fearless Leader, while Bullwinkle flies the plane to Washington, D.C. and lands at the White House. The villains capture Karen and Rocky, whilst Cappy faxes Bullwinkle to RBTV's headquarters to free them. A battle follows, with the heroes winning and convincing the American public to vote for whoever they want but to replant Frostbite Falls' trees. Bullwinkle fiddles with the CDI and inadvertently zaps the villains back to their two-dimensional cartoon forms, and ultimately to the internet. At the film's end, RBTV becomes \"Rocky and Bullwinkle Television\" and Karen dates Ole to see the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie.\n\nCast\n\nRobert De Niro as Fearless Leader\n\nRene Russo as Natasha Fatale\n\nJason Alexander as Boris Badenov\n\nPiper Perabo as FBI agent Karen Sympathy\n\nRandy Quaid as Cappy von Trapment\n\nJune Foray as voices of Rocky (voice)\n\nKeith Scott as the voice of Bullwinkle (voice)\n\nJim Cummings as voices of Bullwinkle (voice)\n\nCarl Reiner as P.G.

The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes stated [that] \"Though the film stays true to the nature of the original cartoon, the script is disappointing and not funny.\"[3] The Tomatometer rating for the film at Rotten Tomatoes is at 43%. However, Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, saying, \"It was a funny movie for kids and it was a funny movie for adults, too, and it has an attitude towards itself and it's in on the joke, and I really was surprised how much I liked it!\"\n\nThe film was nominated for two Saturn Awards, Alexander for Best Supporting Actor and Russo for Best Supporting Actress. Russo was also nominated for a Razzie as Worst Supporting Actress. Jason Alexander (despite getting more critical acclaim for his performance than Russo) issued a public apology for the film and his appearance in it, which was replayed a number of times on the Howard Stern Show.\n\nReferences"
