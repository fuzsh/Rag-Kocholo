        "text": "Post by Jeff Harris on\n\nWhen you have a group of many diverse voices working together, one voice shouldn't dominate the entire conversation. Corus, Nelvana's parent company, learned that the hard way last season when they brought two educational/family-friendly shows (Rescue Heroes and Pippi Longstocking), new-to-qubo episodes of network favorites (Babar and Jacob Two-Two), and three older kid-friendly shows (Being Ian, Class of the Titans, and Spliced) to the lineup. While the educational/family-friendly shows and network favorites remain on the network today and will, in all likelihood, remain in the 2010-11 season, the trio of older kid-skewering shows were yanked less than a month after they debuted, which is a shame considering they were some of the most entertaining shows on the entire qubo block. This was largely due to the interference of the majority owner, ION Media.\n\nUnfair? You bet, and considering they provide none of the actual content for the network, it kind of seems unfortunate they're controlling the direction of the lineup. It's a kids' network. It doesn't have to be educational and morally correct all the time. They want to build an audience\"? Utilize the best of Corus, Nelvana, Classic Media, NBC Universal, and Scholastic. Unlike the haphazzard set-it-and-forget-it lineup they currently have, I'd run qubo like a real channel. A family network for every member, not just the youngest (who aren't entertained by late nights anyway).\n\nAnd here's how I'd program the network:\n\nWeekdays (All Times Eastern)\n\n6 AM: Sitting Ducks/Pecola\n\n6:30 AM: 321 Penguins!\n\n7 AM - Gofrette\n\n7:30 AM - Willa's Wild Life\n\n8 AM - Zula Patrol\n\n8:30 AM - Casper and Friends\n\nIf I could, I'd get Mallory Lewis and Lamb-Chop to host the preschool morning block, and make it commercial-free throughout:\n\n9 AM - Maisy\n\n9:15 AM - Postman Pat\n\n9:30 AM - Boo\n\n9:45 AM - Gerald McBoing Boing\n\n10 AM - Turbo Dogs\n\n10:30 AM - Clifford the Big Red Dog\n\n11 AM - The Magic School Bus\n\n11:30 AM - Sammy's Story Shop\n\n12 PM - My Friend Rabbit\n\n12:15 PM - Rolie Polie Olie\n\n12:30 PM - Seven Little Monsters\n\n12:45 PM - Elliot Moose\n\n1 PM - Rocky and Bullwinkle\n\n1:30 PM - Underdog\n\n2 PM - Fat Albert\n\n2:30 PM - Miss BG\n\n3 PM - Jacob Two-Two\n\n3:30 PM - Maya and Miguel\n\n4 PM - Rescue Heroes\n\n4:30 PM - The Adventures of Tintin\n\n5 PM - George of the Jungle (2000s)\n\n5:30 PM - Richie Rich (2000s)\n\n6 PM - Babar\n\n6:30 PM - The Magic School Bus\n\n7 PM - Qubo Family Movie\n\n9 PM\n\nMondays - Famous Dog Lassie\n\nTuesdays - The Mysteries of Alfred Hedgehog\n\nWednesdays - Pearlie\n\nThursdays - The Secret World of Og\n\nFridays - Class of the Titans\n\n9:30 PM - Maya and Miguel\n\n10 PM - Jacob Two-Two\n\n10:30 PM - The Adventures of Tintin\n\n11 PM - Exo-Squad\n\n11:30 PM - The New Woody Woodpecker Show\n\n12 AM - Casper (1990s)\n\n12:30 AM - Rocky and Bullwinkle\n\n1 AM - Underdog\n\n1:30 AM - Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales\n\n2 AM - Maisy\n\n2:15 AM - Postman Pat\n\n2:30 AM - Boo\n\n2:45 AM - Gerald McBoing Boing\n\n3 AM - Turbo Dogs\n\n3:30 AM - Clifford the Big Red Dog\n\n4 AM - The Magic School Bus\n\n4:30 AM - Sammy's Story Shop\n\n5 AM- My Friend Rabbit\n\n5:15 AM - Rolie Polie Olie\n\n5:30 PM - Seven Little Monsters\n\n5:45 PM - Elliot Moose\n\nPost by Jeff Harris on\n\nAnd this is why I'm glad you joined the forum because with channel's like The Hub and Qubo I don't even know where to begin.\n\nThanks.\n\nAll I've been doing was looking around at the basic make-up of the networks and the third-parties that are programming for the network. In the case of qubo, there aren't any third-parties airing shows yet (they have a couple for the fall season like Animal Exploration from Litton and some construction show from TV Ontario), and the bulk of the lineup is from the owners of the network with the exception ION (they just own the channel space and largely dictates the network's direction).\n\nThe thing is there are a LOT of shows the partners can offer qubo but won't, and they would easily fit the E/I standards (though truth be told, they only have to show three hours of E/I per week per FCC mandate. This is just overkill. For example:\n\nScholastic - Clifford the Big Red Dog (it could be leaving PBS soon, and with its massive amount of episodes [65 + 39 additional episodes of Clifford's Puppy Days that could easily blend into the show], a daily qubo run would work), Maya and Miguel (same deal, another 65-episode series), Magic School Bus (a 52-episode series made with fellow qubo partner Nelvana that IS coming to qubo this fall), Wishbone, Goosebumps, Animorphs, and Baby-Sitters Club could all come to qubo one day.\n\nNelvana/Corus's library of shows is massive, as is Classic Media's. Why Tintin, Rolie Polie Olie, Casper, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Underdog, Basil Brush, Where's Waldo?, Lassie, Fat Albert, and others aren't on qubo is beyond me. But they're putting stuff like He-Man and Bravestarr on weekend afternoons for some odd reason. It'd be nicer if they brought back Being Ian, COTT, and Spliced.\n\nAlso, I'm curious why they haven't put a weekly or nightly family movie night on qubo in the first place. NBC Universal is a major partner in qubo, airing the block on two of their broadcast networks, and they have a huge library of family-friendly films that could be put in a package, as does Classic Media, Scholastic, and Nelvana/Corus. It would be one of the best uses of their resources. Plus, as ION has done with other studios like Warner Bros. and Fox, they could also acquire film packages just for the network.\n\nI'm not a fan of channels that are on auto-run like qubo and Boomerang are. I'm an active guy. Qubo needs to be an active network.\n\nPost by Jeff Harris on\n\nAnd the thing is there are many, many, many third-party companies just willing to almost give away shows to networks. The Big Three (Nick, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network) are so picky and have their go-to studios. It's akin to most-favored nation status. Nick, for a while, went with Animation Collective in the US and Nelvana globally. Disney went with BKN, Marathon, and DiC. Cartoon Network went with Viz, Funimation, and nowadays, 4Kids and Fresh TV. Most of the time, the networks keep their properties in-house with third-party acquisitions largely as time-fillers.\n\nWhen shows that are in the can like Ruby Gloom, Delilah and Julius, Being Ian, Carl Squared, Jacob Two-Two, and many others are just in the ether or lagging around on smaller networks instead of the big three, there's a problem. When top-tier properties like Naruto Shippuden, Dragon Ball Kai, Wolverine and the X-Men, and Spectacular Spider-Man are on the C-level spinoffs of two high-rated networks, there's a problem. And it's not one they want to address, unfortunately.\n\nOne of the reasons I'm rooting for The Hub is because they actually seem to be a legitimate contender to break the stranglehold of the Big Three. They're more open to third-party companies to provide programming for their network. Qubo, which is largely a consortium of children's entertainment companies not affiliated with the big three, has the potential of being a great children's network (not to mention one that's free and over-the-airwaves), but due to the myopic vision of ION Media, they only see the preschool audience and not willing to grab their older siblings nor their parents.\n\nQubo is like a buffet with many chefs. You have a French chef who's a master of pastries and French cuisine, an Italian chef that is globally known for their entrees, a Southern cook that excels in comfort food, and a Seattle-born barrister that can make fine coffees and beverages, and yet the owner of the buffet only offers fresh garden salad to his customers. People get bored with the same old salad, you dig?\n\nPost by donaldduck12 on\n\nMan this was a daunting task. Between rights issues and shows I am unfamiliar with (However I am intrigued by the name There's a Viking in My Bed) I am unsure how this schedule will turn out. Nevertheless here is my shot at it. In Eastern Time\n\nqubo- The Block\n\nTurbo Dogs\n\n3-2-1 Penguins\n\nFat Albert and the Cosby Kids\n\nLand Before Time\n\nCurious George (I know this is on PBS Kids, but NBC Universal needs to do their part with this)\n\nVeggie Tales\n\nqubo- The Channel\n\nWeekdays\n\n6 AM Gumby Show\n\n6:30 AM Harveytoons\n\n7 AM Dudley Do-Right Show\n\n7:30 AM Original Adventures of Felix the Cat\n\n8 AM Lamb Chop\n\n8:30 AM Charlie Horse's Music Pizza\n\n9 AM Clifford the Big Red Dog\n\n9:30 AM Clifford's Puppy Days\n\n10 AM Rolie Polie Olie\n\n10:30 AM Gerald McBoing Boing\n\n11 AM Jane and the Dragon\n\n11:30 AM Dragon\n\n12 PM Jacob Two-Two\n\n12:30 PM Babar\n\n1 PM Rescue Heroes\n\n1:30 PM Curious George\n\n2 PM Veggie Tales\n\n2:30 PM Adventures from the Book of Virtues\n\n3 PM Underdog\n\n3:30 PM Earthworm Jim\n\n4 PM Wayside\n\n4:30 PM George of the Jungle (New Series)\n\n5 PM He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\n\n5:30 PM Medabots\n\n6 PM Exosquad\n\n6:30 PM Class of the Titans\n\n7 PM Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\n\n7:30 PM Being Ian\n\n8 PM Woody Woodpecker Show\n\n8:30 PM Saved by the Bell\n\n9 PM Lassie\n\n9:30 PM Lone Ranger\n\n10 PM Roy Rogers Show\n\n10:30 PM New Lassie\n\n11 PM Original GhostBusters\n\n11:30 PM Shelldon\n\n12 AM Theodore Tugboat\n\n12:30 AM Postman Pat\n\n1 AM Zulu Patrol\n\n1:30 AM Willa's Wild Life\n\n2 AM Anatole\n\n2:30 AM Pat the Bunny\n\n3 AM Katie and Orbie\n\n3:30 AM Maisy\n\n4 AM Land Before Time\n\n4:30 AM Fat Albert and Cosby Kids\n\n5 AM Turbo Dogs\n\n5:30 AM 3-2-1 Penguins\n\nWeekends\n\n6 AM Roger Ramjet\n\n6:30 AM Archie Show\n\n7 AM Dick Tracy Show\n\n7:30 AM Famous Adventures of Mr. Magoo\n\n8 AM Tennessee Tuxedo\n\n8:30 AM King Leonardo and His Short Subjects\n\n9 AM Gumby Show\n\n9:30 AM Adventures of Tintin\n\n10 AM Uncle Waldo\n\n10:30 AM George of the Jungle\n\n11 AM Back to the Future\n\n11:30 AM Fievel's American Tales\n\n12 PM New Woody Woodpecker Show\n\n12:30 PM Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper\n\n1 PM Sitting Ducks\n\n1:30 PM Pecola\n\n2 PM BraveStarr\n\n2:30 PM Jason of Star Command\n\n3 PM Godzilla\n\n3:30 PM Mummy\n\n4 PM Redwall\n\n4:30 PM Mythic Warriors\n\n5 PM She-Ra\n\n5:30 PM Cardcaptors Sakura\n\n6 PM Family Movie\n\n8 PM Woody Woodpecker Show\n\n8:30 PM Saved by the Bell: The New Class\n\n9 PM Lassie\n\n9:30 PM Lone Ranger\n\n10 PM Roy Rogers Show\n\n10:30 PM Sgt. Preston of the Yukon\n\n11 PM-6 AM Same as Weeknights\n\nI am sure there are many shows I was ignorant towards, but I think that starting out as a franchised based network and block would be the best way to bring in new (and old) viewers. With Fat Albert, Land Before Time, Curious George, Veggie Tales, Woody Woodpecker, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Lassie, Lone Ranger, Godzilla, Roy Rogers, He-Man, Archie, Casper, Richie Rich, Mr. Magoo, Dick Tracy, An American Tail, Back to the Future, Gumby, Underdog, Babar, Lamb Chop, Clifford, Felix the Cat in addition to biblical, historical and mythical figures featured in many of the series how can this not market itself? Seriously if qubo taps into everything they have they will undoubtably have the most diverse and best line-ups on TV. Here's hoping for the best.\n\nPost by Jeff Harris on\n\nHaven't done this in a while, but considering the season has just started with a great new addition, Qubo's Night Owl (a late-night airing of classic cartoons).\n\nThat doesn't mean it can't be improved. To reiterate what I said earlier:\n\nWhen you have a group of many diverse voices working together, one voice shouldn't dominate the entire conversation.
