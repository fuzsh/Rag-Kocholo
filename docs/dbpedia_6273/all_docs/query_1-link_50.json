        "meta_description": "The old Hanna-Barbera cartoon was cheap, silly and occasionally charming in its blithe stupidity. This adaptation, combining live action with 3-D computer-generated animation, looks pretty expensive, and its stupidity is, for the most part, charmless. The human cast &#151; Freddie Prinze Jr., especially &#151; does a good-humored job of sending up and paying homage to the old show, but its efforts are overwhelmed by a relentless pop music score, hideous special effects and a plot the violates all the rules of the old series for no good reason. â€” A.

        "text": "For a while, ''Scooby-Doo'' looks as if it will turn out to be the half-successful realization of a spectacularly stupid idea. For some reason and against a great deal of evidence (''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''; ''Rocky and Bullwinkle''), Hollywood studios persist in believing that the public is clamoring for elaborate, digitally souped-up feature films based on old cartoons. The idea, presumably, is that parents who grew up on the originals will have their already overstimulated nostalgia receptors prodded again, while their kids will thrill to the dumb jokes and eye-popping effects.\n\nOr something. Look, like many others of my generation, I spent more valuable Saturday morning hours than I care to count watching Scooby-Doo and his pals caper stiffly through one cheaply animated landscape after another, my synapses as soggy as the cornflakes in my bowl. I'm not sure how to account for the show's appeal, but it was undeniable. Perhaps it lay in an easygoing admission of stupidity, a relaxed, goofy version of the hyped-up irony that would take over popular culture in subsequent years.\n\nEach episode followed a strict formula, as repeatable as a Punch and Judy show, and the predictability was part of the fun because it made even the sleepiest, dullest-witted viewer feel smarter than what was on the screen. Daphne, Velma, Fred and Shaggy would seek out ghosts and demons, only to find some bitter old man using pulleys and wind machines to scare people, in the service of a plan that would have succeeded perfectly ''if it weren't for you meddling kids.'' The entire run of the series could hardly generate enough wit or incident to eke out a feature film.\n\nBut why should that stop anyone? The movie, directed by Raja Gosnell from a script by James Gunn, is not entirely without charm. In its first sequence, and intermittently thereafter, it seeks to send up the original while remaining true to its spirit. The fun starts with a cacophonous, chaotic mini-episode in which a spooky ghost is unmasked as yet another grumpy old man. As one toddler at the screening I attended wailed in fright at the sight of the ghost, his mother tried to reassure him. ''It's a costume,'' she said. ''Listen, I promise you, that's just a costume.''\n\nAt this moment of triumph, however (which includes a cameo by Pamela Sue Anderson, the point of which is entirely beyond my powers to discern), the Mystery Inc. crew is riven by jealousy and dissension. Velma (Linda Cardellini), the smart girl, never receives enough credit from the spotlight-hogging Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), and Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is tired of being the damsel in distress. Scooby (a computer animation with the voice of Neil Fanning) and Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) look on helplessly while the others bicker, powerless to prevent the gang from splitting up.\n\nI will spare you further plot summary, except to note that the main plot is a foursquare violation of everything the old series stood for. I realize that I am defending the integrity of one of the cheapest, least original products of modern American juvenile culture, but somebody has to stand up for tradition, by gosh.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
