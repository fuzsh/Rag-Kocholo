        "text": "When I came across the webcomic, and manga, entitled Shoujo Manga Protagonist x Rival San, I never expected that libraries would be such a key part, especially in the 33rd chapter. In this post, I’ll examine those parts of this webcomic and connect them to other posts on this blog. As a fair warning, there will be some summary of this chapter (hence, spoilers) so that I can examine in later in this post.\n\nThe library begins as a place that Honoka, and her friend, Tomoe, are studying, with Honoka worrying she won’t pass a test. Soon enough, the intrigue begins, as Honoka sees a boy she has a crush on, Mizushima, with Tomoe encouraging her to ask him to tutor her. While she does so, with the literal push by Tomoe, Hiyama, her “rival” appears out of nowhere, a person who has a huge crush on Honoka. That’s where the jealousy comes in, with Hiyama annoyed that she has to study with Mizushima, seeing him as a “rival” for her love to Honoka. All of this makes Honoka sad, and causes Tomoe to intervene and sit next to Hiyama, surprising her, but annoying her.\n\nWhile she tries to make nice, Hiyama is suspicious, but takes up Tomoe on her offer to do “anything” for her, taking her away, and asks for help in getting Honoka to like her. As a result, Tomoe realizes that Hiyama, the whole time, was trying to get Honoka to get closer to her. All of this causes Honoka to become anxious and worry about what is going on between Hiyama and Tomoe. In some ways, she becomes jealous and ends up not doing much studying on her own.\n\nThere is no doubt that the romance depicted in this chapter of Shoujo Manga Protagonist x Rival San is a yuri one, as Honoka is catching feelings for Hiyama. As a spoiler, they do end up together in the end, so this is a story of slow romance, as Hiyama has a huge crush on Honoka, but it takes time for the latter to realize she also has a crush. This chapter primarily focuses on the characters and their internal struggles, so as to highlight jealousy and a love triangle of sorts (Hiyama-Honoka-Mizushima). Perhaps this is why librarians are absent here, as the author, kuu_u_, did not think they were necessary.\n\nThere are many examples of librarians being absent in fictional depictions of libraries. I have a whole tag on this blog titled “Librarian Absent”. Take for example the role of libraries in Carmen Sandiego, The Truman Show, and Wandering Son. In each of those cases, libraries play a key role in the story, but the librarians that organize the materials aren’t shown. While this can make sense, in terms of plot, it can have the unintended effect of rending the labor of the librarians invisible. I mentioned this when talking about Hilda on my sister blog, Wading Through the Cultural Stacks, writing:\n\n…After this, the librarian walks up the stairs and back into the main library. Hilda sneaks out of the room, copies the one page carelessly, without reading the footnotes, which almost destroys the copier. She leaves the book face down on the copier and reads the page she copies at a library table. Assuming she does not put the book back in the special collections room, this means that the librarian will have to re-shelve this, hinting at the work she will do off-screen, just like the work of archivists which is often unseen and unappreciated…[it is] assumedly part of the librarian’s general duties to re-shelve the book. Is this librarian a lone arranger of the special collections room? Or does she have volunteers, unpaid interns, or other staff helping her? It is my hope that this librarian has paid staff helping her, but since we don’t see any more of the library other than some snapshots, one can assume that this librarian is working by herself or with a small staff….often those who use such rooms are not aware or recognize the “extent of labor required to perform basic, yet key functions within special collections libraries,” which they put under the umbrella of invisible labor…The next scene in the library, in the same episode, shows her invisible labor has manifested…It is then it is shown that the book has been re-shelved and the librarian is nowhere in sight. If that isn’t invisible labor, I don’t know what is.\n\nAdding to this, I noted, quoting from the now-defunct Archives in Fiction Twitter account, that librarians suffer “the same lack of acknowledgment (basically invisible labor) as archivists” and are only there in a story to convey or be the “vehicle for that all-important information.” This isn’t always the case, as I’ve noted on this blog, although when it comes to archivists, there is much more invisibility, as often they are confused with librarians, or not shown at all. In fact, I have a tag on that blog, “archives-libraries confusion“. At some point, I may add a similar tag here as well, if it comes up more.\n\nThere have been some who have tried to push for invisible labor of librarians to become more visible, especially when it comes to digital projects, even putting together tools to calculate labor value. [1] As explained earlier, Shoujo Manga Protagonist x Rival San is not unique in having narratives where libraries are absent. The same is the case for various anime, such as Paradise Kiss, Ice, Macross Frontier, and Classroom of the Elite. Often library scenes in series like that are only used as set-pieces to advance the story forward, with the focus more on the plot rather than on those who provided the characters with a place to study, fulfill their information needs, or expand their knowledge.\n\nThe same, is arguably, the case in well-known Western animated series, like Cleopatra in Space, Sym-Bionic Titan, Bravest Warriors, and Stretch Armstrong. One of the most blatant examples is in RWBY, where the characters spend multiple episodes in the library, with one library scene even occurring in the first episode that a queer ship between two female characters (Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long) was born! Other examples which are blatant, without question, is the key scene in a library in Solaris, or the huge libraries featured in Amphibia and Tangled. One of most unfortunate is the series LoliRock, where the characters often organize and use a library, but there’s no librarian present! They could have had a robot, or even a one-off character, but the writers never even went to that extent, unfortunately.\n\nOf course, these aren’t the only examples. There’s a royal library in Mira Royal Detective, hidden libraries in Winx Club, the intergalactic library in Megas XLR, the public library in King of the Hill, and the magical library sadly set on fire in the High Guardian Spice series finale. None of these feature librarians. [2] Neither did the Justice League episode I examined in my post last week. As I wrote in my guest post on Reel Librarians, there are various shows which have absent archivists, with “some of these archives literally being abandoned.” This is the case for some libraries as well. I am still not sure, exactly, what encouraged writers to show libraries without librarians, apart from a need to focus on the characters, with libraries serving as somewhere to advance the plot, but series with librarians as characters are better.\n\nSuch librarians may embody stereotypes, as evidenced by my tag on this website, and its companion “library stereotypes” tag, which is less used. There is even a section on the librarians in popular culture Wikipedia page on this very topic, citing articles by scholars Linda B. Alexander, Michelle Peresie, Nicole Pagowsky, Miriam W. Rigby, Erin DeFrain, and Gretchen Keer, some of whom I have cited on this blog in the past. [3] However, there are examples of librarians who have bucked these stereotypes, which I’ve noted on this blog in the past, such as Bobby Daniels, the librarian in The Ghost and Molly McGee, Wan Shi Tong in Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, or Kaisa in Hilda, to name a few of the many out there.\n\nThat’s all for this week. Look forward to my next substantive post (my list of “Recently added titles for June 2024” is next week) on July 10 about barcodes, library slips, bookworms, and book deliveries in Whisper of the Heart! As always, comments are welcome.\n\n© 2023-2024 Burkely Hermann.

American Library Association.\n\nWhen I watched Justice League, the early 2000s superhero sci-fi action-adventure drama animated series, the first series on Cartoon Network to be produced by Warner Bros. Animation, on Netflix, I did not, necessarily, expect an episode featuring libraries. The episode, which originally aired in April 2002, is the second part of a two-part episode entitled “Legends.” Examining this episode requires connecting it to other posts on this blog, realities of real-life libraries, and focusing on themes in the episode itself, when it comes to blank books, the impact of war, and manufactured knowledge.\n\nIn her February 2019 post, which was updated in August 2021, Sam Cross examined the episode on her blog Pop Archives, noted that the series expanded on DC comics about villains and superheroes, and explained the episode: Green Lantern and Hawkgirl are trapped in a parallel dimension with Martian Manhunter and Flash, and they look at the city library to learn the reality behind this world. In the process, they learn that all the books are blank, then proceed to go to the archives. For that, I’d focused on this same episode in a post on my Wading Through the Cultural Stacks sister blog on June 5th.\n\nThere is more to the library than this. For one, it is hinting that knowledge can be manufactured and fabricated to serve nefarious means. For one, this relates to what I wrote about nuclear war and libraries in September of last year, highlighting libraries in landscapes after nuclear war in series such as Adventure Time, Twilight Zone, along with films like The Time Machine, and War of the Worlds. The blank books hint at the reality that not everything in a library is necessarily correct. Certain materials may be outright disinformation, racist, sexist, or whatnot. There is a push by some librarians to not keep this content within their collections, while others counter by saying they need “diverse” viewpoints and want to serve “their readers”. The latter are the same people who claim, laughably, that libraries are “neutral.” As the recent push for censorship and banning of books by reactionary forces, especially in the U.S., has shown, libraries are contested spaces, not some neutral space where all beliefs are “equal” to one another.\n\nAt the same time, the blank books show that in this world, the library is only a facade, not a place to store knowledge or inform others. It is a place of deception and deceit. If the books are all blank and there isn’t anything on them, what’s the point of having the library anyway? The answer is that is for “appearances.” It is to make the town look legitimate. Funny enough, those behind the reality show which enveloped the life of Truman Burbank on Seahaven Island, had enough foresight to have the school library stocked with books. The idea was to create an illusion that the world he was in was “real,” and that there was no reason to ever leave.\n\nThe library in this Justice League episode flies in the face of the ethics code shared by the ALA. That code states that libraries uphold principles of intellectual freedom, resist all “efforts to censor library resources”, distinguish between personal beliefs and professional duties, and affirm “inherent dignity and rights of every person.” [1] Beyond that code, such deception of possible patrons is clearly unethical. Clearly, Ray Thompson could care little about this. Instead, he is the mascot/sidekick of the Justice Guild of America, and has the true form of mutant who can bend reality itself to recreate the destroyed town he once lived in. He later ceases to exist when the Guild heroes fight him, and sacrifice themselves, with the remaining city residents freed from the illusion Thompson created. [2]\n\nMore broadly, books which are blank or empty are said be novelty books, with titles purporting to cover an important or serious subject, but have pages left blank, intentionally. The joke is said to be that “nothing” answers the title of the book. There has even a trend of publishing empty books as a form of political parody. [3] That is not what Thompson was attempting here. As noted earlier, it was to keep up appearances, to act like there was something more to the town than there really was, to support the idea this world wasn’t an illusion. Putting such books in a library defeats one of the oft aims of the library: that it be a place to share knowledge and inform others. How can a library help fulfill information needs of patrons with blank books? The same goes for DVDs which are not entirely playable, or overly scratched CDs. To provide such items to patrons does them a disservice, and shows that the library doesn’t really care about their patrons, even if they claim that they do.\n\nSome theorists have argued that people should go beyond seeing science as gendered and criticizing objectivity, seeing both as manufactured knowledge, but have strong objectivity which “embraces researching as embodied observations at limited locations that produce situated knowledge.” Others have said that “manufactured knowledge” is used as a basis for creating orthodoxy around knowledge, with the recognition that information and knowledge are not neutral or objective. Instead, they either serve as way to increase influence, profit, or strategic advantage, with control and influence over knowledge providing various benefits, all the more clear in international relations, especially in actions taken by hegemonic powers like the U.S. [4]\n\nComing back to this episode, Thompson was only manufacturing such knowledge for his illusion to seem plausible, so that no one questioned it. This is a key for many illusions, even throughout the Justice League series. The idea is that people will become so comfortable in them, that they will not question them, resulting in the illusions becoming their reality. There is even a term for such a practice of maintaining an illusion that everything is real, in professional wrestling: kayfabe. But, it can also be used outside of those contexts in situations “that involve maintaining an illusion of reality. ” That is certainly the case here.\n\nThis is not the only place I have talked about illusions on here. In my article last March about school librarian-then-idol Hanamaru Kunikida in Love Love! Sunshine!!, I noted that in Japan, idols are in “the business of selling dreams,” projecting an “illusion of a cute, slightly idealized person who is there for…the fan”, while music remains secondary. That part was summarizing an article by Justin Sevakis on Anime News Network entitled “Why Can’t Idol Singers Have Lives Of Their Own?,” to be clear.\n\nIt has been said that libraries are “magical,” places of fantasy, despite the problems with this perception. Can they also, at times, be unreal, deceptive, misleading, or false? I would think so. After all, there are battles over whose narrative is dominant in libraries, with some wanting the so-called “parental” (actually reactionary) view to dominate, even if it deprives others of knowledge which allows them to live more fulfilling lives. Some have posited that if content from books was stripped out, then the library itself could be “seen as a big container of content” and be anywhere, with a library of illusions never being the destination, but existing “on the way to others.” [5]\n\nAs cognitive science professor Mark Williams put it, illusions help us understand how human brains “create reality” based on input received from senses, but we don’t see the world how it is, meaning that “illusions explain to us how we are creating the world we actually perceive.” As such, as psychologist Branka Spehar added, profoundly, “on some level, everything is an illusion and nothing is an illusion.” There is even an illusion known as pareidolia, when the human brain creates “something from a lot of noise.” When it comes to libraries, there have been arguments that scholarship is not entirely self-directed and that colleges (and universities) without libraries are “like a body without a heart”. [6]\n\nSurely blank books in a library would be an affront to the generally accepted wisdom of libraries as place of knowledge and understanding. Although some have directly published blank books, which have been praised by certain critics, reading such books would fall under the ALA’s “freedom to read” statement, stating, in the first proposition, that “it is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered dangerous by the majority.” [7] Blank books differ from intentionally blank pages in books, known as vacat pages, often at the beginning or end of a book.\n\nTo close out this article, blank books, ravages of nuclear war, and manufactured knowledge combine in such a way in the aforementioned Justice League episode that they communicate something to the viewer. Whether the analysis, presented in this article, was the intended message to the viewer or not, I don’t know. Writing this post reminds me a bit of my post last week about the librarian-soldiers in Library War, who fought censorship with their guns. With that, the post comes to a close. Until next week!\n\n© 2023-2024 Burkely Hermann.

I’m actually surprised that this page is even considered notable, as it really isn’t.\n\n[3] Kean, Danuta. “Empty satire: the regrettable rise of blank-paged books in the Trump era,” The Guardian, Apr. 17, 2017. Also see the Wikipedia page “Empty book“, and other articles cited on that page, such as “What Every Man Thinks About Apart From Sex: book of blank pages become surprise bestseller,” “Meet the Man Who Sold Hundreds of Thousands of Books With Blank Pages in Them,” “Ukip supporters want the satirical book The Wit and Wisdom of Nigel Farage (that is full of blank pages) banned,” “Cylvia Hayes’ New Book On Trump Is A Page-Turner,” “New book ‘Why Trump Deserves Trust, Respect & Admiration’ has nothing but blank pages,” and “Empty Book on Palestinian History Becomes Instant Best-seller on Amazon“. The latter link refers to a mean and hostile book by a Zionist who wants to deny that Palestinians are people with history, despite books on actual Palestinian history such as The Palestinian People: A History, A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel, and The History of Palestine, among many others out there existing.

It would conflict with the public interest for them to establish their own political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated;” “It is contrary to the public interest for publishers or librarians to bar access to writings on the basis of the personal history or political affiliations of the author;” “There is no place in our society for efforts to coerce the taste of others, to confine adults to the reading matter deemed suitable for adolescents, or to inhibit the efforts of writers to achieve artistic expression;” “It is not in the public interest to force a reader to accept the prejudgment of a label characterizing any expression or its author as subversive or dangerous;” “It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians, as guardians of the people’s freedom to read, to contest encroachments upon that freedom by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large; and by the government whenever it seeks to reduce or deny public access to public information;” “It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians to give full meaning to the freedom to read by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought and expression. By the exercise of this affirmative responsibility, they can demonstrate that the answer to a ‘bad’ book is a good one, the answer to a ‘bad’ idea is a good one.” All of these embody what is often termed “intellectual freedom,” meaning “right of every individual to both seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction,” which comes with the assumption that ALL points are view are valid, even though they are not.\n\nOn February 7th, I wrote about Colin Higgins and fictional librarians in film, talking about reviews on his now-defunct blog, Librarians at the Movies. I’m continuing that in this post and going a different direction than my post last week about love in the fictional library. As a warning to all of those who are reading this post,, there will be some discussion of sexual assault and rape.\n\nThe first three he focuses on were: Oblivion (2013), On the Beach (1959), and Peeping Tom (1960). The first of these features Tom Cruise’s character entering the Round Reading Room of the British Museum “in search of a wayward robot” and he escapes with a copy of Macaulay’s Lays of Ancient Rome. In the second, crowds meet for the “Salvation Army’s services in front of Melbourne’s State Library of Victoria,” indicating that the cloud of radiation has “finally reached humanity’s final refuge. In the last of these three, a library is shown for three seconds, when it is really “a concrete secondary modern school next to crumbling tower blocks in a rundown part of north London.” Higgins argues it could indicate that “much of librarianship can be pedestrian and dull” and hints that libraries can be “places that…one might sometimes dream of escaping from.” [1] The last point is significant when it comes to library and librarian stereotypes in media.\n\nThere are many other films Higgins writes about. One of those is Prometheus. He argued that the spacecraft’s library is a “microcosm of the film,” with books of the capitalist played by Charlize Theron, with spins facing inwards, making it an unresolved puzzle, which is “stylish but confused, an unsatisfying postmodern simulacrum of its intellectual predecessor.” This contrasts with the 2005 film, Proof. That film hints that Melville Louis Kossuth “Melvil” Dewey was “anti-Semite…misogynist…[and] an extraterrestrial,” with some arguing that the Dewey Decimal Classification scheme appears “absurdly over-prepared for extraterrestrial encounters” (this is clear in Futurama) Then there’s the 1975 film, Rollerball, a sci-fi thriller, which has a library where the protagonist, Caan, goes. There is a clerk inside this library which is like a shopping center who tells him that the books have been replaced by computers and summarizes, causing him to declare “so what you’re telling me is that this isn’t a real library and you’re not a real librarian!” Later in the film, he goes to ask “questions of the largest book-munching computer” in Geneva. [2]\n\nWhat he writes about Rollerball is different from Jennifer Snoek-Brown’s analysis. She notes that the first library scene happens in a library known as a “computer center” and describes it like a “futuristic mall, with escalators,” with different information desks, with the message that the library is just one service they offer. She is much more positive on the circulation clerk than Higgins, calling her a “young, pretty, brunette…played by Nancy Bleier,” who fulfills the information provider role, while confirming Jonathan’s suspicions and getting him to seek out the reel books in Geneva. In the second library scene, in Geneva, Ralph Richardson plays the librarian, with an office which looks like a computer storage area, and he mentions that he has “misplaced some data,” terrifyingly brushing it off like this information loss is nothing. It is revealed, as she noted that the librarian has become exhausted and emotionally numb, and attempts to pry information out of the computer, making it clear that we are “impotent…in this corporatized world.” The 2002 film remake, which she also covers, is different, and with no reel librarians. [3]\n\nWith that, I move onto three other films he wrote about: Star Trek Into Darkness (2013), Take Shelter (2011), and The Adjustment Bureau (2011). On the first of these films, which I actually watched in the theater when it came out, he writes that the film sets up action by having a “bomb in an archive,” with the Kelvin Memorial Library hiding a “subterranean weapons facility…[and] a cave full of spaceships directly underneath London.” It is destroyed by a Starfleet officer, and Kirk strangely thinks it is odd to that someone would want to blow up “what is nominally a library.” I didn’t actually remember that from the film and it almost makes me want to watch it again, maybe (but probably not). In his review of the second film noted in this paragraph, Take Shelter, he writes that during the film Michael Shannon borrows books on mental illness “from the local library to help work out what’s happening to him.” This differs from in The Adjustment Bureau, with the bureau headquarters as the New York Public Library, even though the Reading Room has no books. Strangely, he writes that the library was chosen as a filming location “entirely for its non-book aesthetic”! Clearly, the library in the film is only setting, not a real library. [4]\n\nWith that, I come to three additional films: The Asphalt Jungle (1950), The Book of Eli (2010), and The Chronicles of Riddick (2004). The first of these films he describes as having a criminal, and communist named ‘Doc’ Riefenschneider (played by Sam Jaffe), as previously. working as a librarian in a prison, arguing it is only a “plot device” used in other films, and says that people shouldn’t read much into it. As for The Book of Eli, he notes its “moral writing” and its “theocratic paternalism” and notes a book ending up in a library on Alcatraz Island at the end of the film. Then there’s The Chronicles of Riddick, noting that the film looks cheap, and says that there is a small library of books shown in the film, and notes that books can be chosen from a bookstore in New York to get a certain look for a library in a film. [5]\n\nWith that, I’m going to summarize his reviews on two other films: The Darkest Hour (2011) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). In the case of the first film listed here, Higgins writes that while cinematic libraries and librarians are “unrecognized visual tools, tropes and similes,” this isn’t always true, as he argues that Lenin Library in this film is a “Moscow landmark that must be ticked off this film’s visual to-do list,” portraying Russians as kooky, intelligent, and brash, while Americans are shown positively. Despite that, which sounds bad, he still claims the film is “an enjoyable piece of escapism…and a peek inside one of the great libraries Westerners are unlikely to be aware of.” In the review of the second of these films, he notes that librarians and librarians have often appeared in “Batman’s comic-book adventures” within Gotham City, but in this film, there is a gentleman’s library within Wayne Manor. It has a revolving-bookcase-leading-to-a-secret-chamber, and as Higgins puts it, audiences are primed to think of libraries as “places of concealment” were identities, objectives, and keys to secrets are hidden, but notes that bookcase doors are often “cheap jokes.” [6]\n\nWith that, I’m moving to three more films he reviewed: The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961), The Final Countdown (1980), and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011). The first of these films features Janet Munro, who plays a character “sinecure in the library of the Daily Express” and is said to represent “an interesting mix of Jennifer Snoek-Brown’s female librarian archetypes.” He goes onto say that the final twenty minutes of the film “hollow out her character…into a librarian who falls into a man’s arms at the first hint of trouble.” That doesn’t sound good! In a review of the second film, he argues that “an endlessly expanding library is neither possible nor desirable” and notes that the ship’s library is only shown briefly. Then there’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which features Henrik Vanger’s “lamp-lit personal library, with lots of dark wood and leather-bound volumes,” and journalist Mikael Blomkvist’s interview of an elderly Nazi “surrounded by teetering piles of books…before discovering the identity of the killer.” [7]\n\nSnoek-Brown does more a deep dive into this film. She notes that unlike the 2011 American film adaptation, the original Swedish film does nor feature “the reel librarian character, Lindgren” who also appears in the book version. Instead, there is tension solely on Lisbeth tracking down clues “from the archive files and receipts and running down the bookcase aisles with loads of books and file boxes in her arms.” There is an additional library scene, but no librarian appears, again. In contrast, in the 2011 film, Bodil Lindgren (played by Anne-Li Norberg), the “archivist librarian” casts dirty looks and does tightly-lipped smiles toward Lisbeth, and almost completes the “stereotypical image of the Spinster Librarian”. Lindgen ends up being “very perturbed” with Lisabeth who didn’t even witnessing Lisbeth “eating and drinking coffee…while walking through the stacks.” The book version of this character is described through her actions and emotions, rather than any physical description. This allows her book character to be connected with that which is depicted in the film: “a judgmental, inflexible archives librarian infuriated both by Salander’s authority and by her appearance.” Snoek-Brown also gave Lindgren as “dishonorable mention” and blurring the lines between archivist and librarian. [8]\n\nThen I’ll come to The Handmaid’s Tale, which Higgins calls “a very bad film,” and notes that Duvall’s character is briefly mentioned as a librarian, but there is no other mention of this. I will say that the series is better than that film, although I don’t remember any library scenes or librarians at all. Then there’s The Ipcress File (1965). Higgins notes that there is an “uncanny confrontation in a library” between the hero and the villain. It was, as he notes, filmed in the “old Science Museum Library…part of Imperial College.” Both of these are very different in the very librarian-focused The Librarian: Quest for the Spear (2004), which centers on Flynn Carson hired as a librarian at a mysterious library which holds many mystical treasures, and he becomes a bit of a superhero. Higgins says that the film panders to some stereotypes, but also has “positive views of the library and librarian,” and he has four colleagues, who also work at the library. It was said that the film makes “librarians the objects of fun,” as well. [9]\n\nThese films are very different from two others that Higgins reviewed in 2011 and 2012: The Name of the Rose (1986) and The Ninth Gate (1999). The first of these films features a monk-librarian named William of Baskerville who “prefers books to women and wine,” and centers on the monastery library and librarian. Even so, Higgins notes that there are many questions about why the library is a labyrinth when only two people can enter, how large scriptorium exists “in an institution whose leadership promotes a policy of literary suppression” and how the said library is “famous when it is nearly impossible to access its books”. He concludes by saying the film raises interesting questions, but is badly paced and sluggish. He also criticized the 1999 film The Ninth Gate, questioning how a double-dealing antiquarian bookseller played by Johnny Depp knows so much about rare books, and noted the role of Roman Polanski as director. [10]\n\nDepp was accused of domestic abuse and sexual violence by Amber Heard, the subject of the Depp v. Heard trial in 2022, and admitted to drug addiction during that trial. Polanski drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl named Samantha Gailey and has been a fugitive from the U.S. criminal system since 1978. He has retained support of many of those in Hollywood, including Guillermo del Toro, Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, Harrison Ford, and Jeremy Irons, who signed a petition calling for his release from a Swiss prison in 2009. This is despite widespread support for Polanski’s extradition to the U.S. in France and Poland, even leading the French government dropped their public support for Polanski as well. [11]\n\nMoving back to the films, I’d like to talk about Higgins’ reviews of Thor (2011) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). In the first film, Stellan Skarsgård at local library releases there is something familiar about Thor, and that he “isn’t an escaped mental patient, but a being from an alternative dimension.” In the second film, Higgins asks where the misunderstanding about the practice of librarianship may have come from librarians themselves, as a popular pastime is recreational reading. He then notes that in that film Robert Redford plays a socially awkward bookish character who is paid to read all day for the CIA, uncovering, with his colleagues “sinister patterns and terrorist plots.” However, he says this reading is unrealistically quick, as many spend their time “flirting with one another, and being very clever,” and Redford often spends time in his office library, but apparently knows evasive moves from reading. [12]\n\nWith that, I move to two other films: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) and When Worlds Collide (1951). The first film is the second adaptation of the novel of the first name. It was adapted first in 1979 in a British live-action television series, which features a character stealing a folder from “MI6’s library-like archive repository” and a frumpy and frowning archivist present. The 2011 film, in contrast, there is a library with “three Victorian metal galleries overlooking a large void…fluorescence and shadows. [and] the female librarian is replaced by a man.” In the second film, humans escape the Earth and one of the things they bring them is a “small library of microfilmed books.” [13] How quaint. Hopefully they brought along a microfilm reader too!\n\nWith that, I come to the last three reviews of Higgins that I will mention in this post. One of those is Z for Zachariah in which a valley farm escaped the radioactive catastrophe, but “lacks vital supplies and…is supplemented with the pick of the town’s library books.”This small mention isn’t surprising for a film which, as Higgins describes it, raises questions about gender, race, class, and faith, but has infinite answers, and the “moral quandary at the film’s centre…turns on an action we never see.” This differs from Zardoz which has a ruined library which provides civilization’s last outpost. Higgins argues this is a mumbled metaphor for this “zany, psychedelic adult fairy-story.” Last but not least is Zodiac. This 2007 film centers on Jake Gyllenhaal’s character borrowing books on psychology and code-breaking, and he is a nerdish and shy library patron. In Higgins words, he gets the girl at the end of the film, “though she does look like a librarian.” [14]\n\nThis brings my post to a close. As always, comments are welcome. Next week, I will be revisiting the fictional librarian stereotype of librarian shushers. Look forward to it!\n\n© 2023-2024 Burkely Hermann.

In the first review, he declares “proponents of the theory that the librarian archetype is always negatively portrayed on-screen will find rich pickings here”.

Higgins is a scholar who once studied philosophy and began working at libraries like University of Cambridge and St Catharine’s College. However, Librarians at the Movies is currently defunct. I’d like to explain a little about his blog, and note films it covered. Some of the films that he reviewed I’ve noted on this blog and others I haven’t. But I’ll mention them all here.\n\nThe ones I’ve covered\n\nOn his blog, Higgins focuses on some films which I’ve mentioned on this blog before. One of those is All the President’s Men, a 1976 film about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two Washington Post reports attempting to break open the Watergate story. In his review, Higgins notes that they talk to a woman at the Library of Congress and travel to the Library’s Beaux-Arts Jefferson Building, asking “for list of books recently sent to the White House.” They are met by a smarmy, middle-aged, male librarian, who rejects their request, but a “hip, young, black librarian” helps them out. Apparently, as he writes “the nefarious librarian-silencer has got to the slips too.” He goes onto say that theses scenes are some of the most interesting interludes of the film, and notes that the Library of Congress is “rarely featured in cinema,” despite the Jefferson Building’s grandiose classical facade, and adds that the appearance of a black librarian, “an oddity in an overly white profession, is another satisfying subversion.” [1]\n\nI’ve written about this scene as well. I’ve noted that the Black male librarian “gives them the slips for who checked out certain books, as opposed to an interaction with a White female librarian”, added that the unnamed Black librarian may be paid at a low rate, and described the former librarian as a “obscurantist and…hostile.” In another post, I noted that fictional librarians “convey a certain meaning, even in more positive depictions”. Then, in a February 2023 post, I noted that the Black librarian, played by Jaye Stewart, gives them “perhaps thousands of check-out slips in the Reading Room of the Library of Congress,” even though it is not ethical to “give out checkout slips or records without a court order” since librarians have an “obligation to protect the privacy rights of our patrons” as Jennifer Snoek-Brown noted. However, as I said in my post at the time, it is great that a Black librarian has such a vital role in the story, giving them the request circulation records, and another unnamed one gives help later in the film. The information he gives pushes the reporters down the trail toward uncovering the Watergate scandal.\n\nThat scandal was different than what the film tells, as Mark Felt was the FBI Deputy Director and provided the vital information which broke the scandal open. He was no hero, as he was convicted, in 1980, of violating civil rights of those believed to be associated with Weather Underground. In fact, he was eyeing for the position of Director when J. Edgar Hoover died, but Nixon appointed L. Patrick Gray as Acting FBI Director instead. Even worse, Felt kept 167 files and 17,750 pages, many containing derogatory information about individuals which Hoover had investigated, in his office! Adding to this,Felt said he had mixed feelings about Gray and that many others who served under Hoover also disapproved of the management efforts of Gray. In addition, Felt had been a source for various stories Woodward wrote. It has been speculated he leaked the information because he wanted to be the head of the FBI. So, the information didn’t come from thin air. [2]\n\nSurely, Richard Nixon was forced to resign as a result of the Watergate investigations, launched by Democrats in Congress and aimed at “embarrassing or discrediting Republican Presidents” (in the case of Watergate, for a good reason). More than that, various processes were established after the scandal to investigate “allegations of unethical conduct” on part of public figures. At the same time, Nixon attempted to expand executive power and curtail influence of the national news media, while he engaged in abuses of power, with these abuses primarily found through congressional investigations. This was compounded by Republican defections and the Nixon White House was paralyzed for three years because of the Watergate scandal. [3]\n\nThis brings me to another film that Higgins covers which I’ve mentioned on this blog: Citizen Kane. This 1941 film, directed by Orson Welles, has a scene when reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) visits the Thatcher Memorial Library to review the manuscript memoirs of Kane’s guardian and a stern librarian (played Georgia Backus) takes “Thompson into a mausoleum-like reading room, arranges for him to view the manuscript, and tells him which pages he’s allowed to look at.” This library doesn’t have any shelves, the manuscript is in a safe, and this librarian is perhaps the “most severe representation of the profession ever projected onto a cinema screen” and is disliked by librarians. However, he adds that this is faulty because Backus grants “access to the library’s most treasured document, and her conditions are not unreasonable”, and even claims that Backus subverts the gendered expectations of a librarian by being “masculine, strong, and domineering, in charge of her collection, in control of the situation…empowering and emancipatory”. He then adds that the library isn’t meant to be seen as a library, but is a “room in which a book can be opened,” nothing more. [4]\n\nThat has to be the most positive view of that which I’ve seen. In contrast, I’d say she is undoubtedly stereotypical, but also supporting the existing system (she does not challenge it), with her existence promoting existing anti-woman stereotypes of librarians, to say the lease. Snoek-Brown, for her part, describes the librarian, named Miss Anderson, as steely and having “no-nonsense presence”, adding that she is a woman in an ” aggressively gender-neutralized exterior” and controls access to the persona papers of Charles Foster Kane, a “prominent male figure”, and calls her a librarian/archivist. In other articles, she adds that Miss Anderson is the strongest modern image of “the librarian as representative of the nun/monk figure” as she appears as undesirable and single woman unwilling or reluctant to share “information from the library with a reporter.” She argues, rightly, that Miss Anderson embodies the “hoarding of knowledge; the conservative dress and demeanor” and cinematically represents the “image of the (stereotypical) nun in a secular society.” [5]\n\nThe last film which I’ve reviewed on this blog that Higgins also reviews is Attack of the Clones. Primarily, I’ve reviewed it in much more detail on my Wading Through the Cultural Stacks blog, even having a tag for “Jocasta Nu” on that site, as Nu is a librarian/archivist (she’s a bit of a mix of both). Higgins writes that the Jedi Library is in Trinity’s Long Room, with deep nostalgia in Star Wars films, and noting that “for centuries, barrel-vaulted libraries and early modern storehouses of knowledge were synonymous.” He goes onto say that the Jedi librarian/archivist is an old woman with “her hair in a bun and a Jedi knight in her own right.” He describes this librarian as severe, but strangely doesn’t say the same of Miss Anderson, and calls Nu a “killer spinster”, while noting that George Lucas’ clichés were “once charming, [but] now they fall flat.” [6]\n\nWhile I’m not sure I would say the same as Higgins about the film, there is more that can be said about Nu. For one, she is a clear stereotype, modeled like a librarian even though she has been described in some sources as a “Jedi archivist” and the Temple library is a sort of archives, even more than a library. Furthermore, she is the lone arranger of the Jedi Archives, asserts the immutable part of the archives, and claims that they encompass everything (a false belief). Even worse, she isn’t helpful to her patrons on a fundamental level.\n\nOnes I haven’t covered\n\nMany of the films I’ve never even mentioned on this blog. One of those is a 2009 film, Agora. In his review, Higgins writes that his blog received many hits from “people searching Google about Rachel Weisz’s performance in The Mummy” but notes that the same voice actress also played Carnahan in The Mummy Returns, with “her character…devolved from an intellectual”, and again plays a librarian working in Egypt in Agora. He states that in the film she is “radically feminist” and works at the Library of Alexandria, and says that the library provides a “location for the film’s exquisite ending.” [7]\n\nThis differs from other films he writes about, like Atonement, which he notes that if libraries are places of order and quiet, then “sexual activity is an obvious transgression,” or Belle. In the case of the latter, he writes that film depictions of libraries are “more cinematically complex than most librarians acknowledge”, while noting that often libraries in movies are just libraries, nothing more. He adds, in his review of The Big Sleep that when referencing his atypical clothes, the librarian “subtly undermines a set of prejudices” which audiences may have put on Humphrey Bogart’s character. [8] This pails in comparison to what he writes about Blackmail and Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nIn the case of the former film, which came out in 1929, he notes that the Round Reading Room of the British Museum, which is a location in the film, is significant, as a a place where Karl Marx wrote Capital and the subject of Virginia Wolfe’s raging in A Room of her Own. He notes that this room only “appeared only three times in live-action film” with this film’s depiction as the “first, and most cinematically significant” out of all of them, in this film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, of all people. He ends his review by writing that no other library space “in the world contains so many exceptional contradictions.” This is diametrically different from what he writes about Breakfast at Tiffany’s. In that review, he notes that Holly and Paul are “together against the system” with frumpy librarian shushing them many times,while Holly does not find the library “half as much fun as Tiffany’s.” The film itself is adapted from a novel by Truman Capote, as it points out, and calls the film “a tragedy” because it was purged of the subversion and poignancy of the original. [9]\n\nThere are many others worth mentioning here, which he writes about. Some of those include Conan the Barbarian, UHF, episodes of Dr. Who, and Foul Play. For the first two of these, he notes, feature giant axe-wielding librarians, while the Dr. Who episodes have the Universal Library, said to be the “container of all human knowledge”. The latter is said to have the less-than-attractive nature of sci-fi. He then adds “I wish people cared more about their real libraries than their imagined ones.” For the film Foul Play, where Goldie Hawns plays a librarian, who unites with Chevy Chase’s character to stop the Pope’s assassination! Haven’t seen a movie like that, ever. [10]\n\nThere are many other films he mentions which I, again, have either not watched for a while or not watched at all. One of those is Hammett. This 1982 film is described as having a librarian who spends most of the film “lounging around Hammett’s apartment in a state of partial undress, or visualized in his daydreamed stories as a tough independent woman” and never talks about, or goes to, work. [11] This brings me to Higgins’ reviews of two Indiana Jones films: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nWhile I have watched both films, I didn’t remember the library scenes in either one. Perhaps that is for a reason. In the first of those films, there is a librarian-less library which he described as “immediately flagged as a mere simulacrum.” In the second, is the film with line in which Indiana Jones (also known as Professor Jones) says most archaeology work is done in the library. He adds that librarians shouldn’t get ” worked up about their cinematic depictions” because they aren’t real librarians, but are reel librarians, adding that “cinema is oversimplified and hyperdramatic reality.” [12]\n\nI am surprised that Higgins does not mention the 1989 film, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I say this because that film features a hilarious library scene in which Indiana Jones is putting a hole in the floor of the library while the librarian is slamming his stamp down. As I noted in my article in June 2023, “through the whole thing he remains unaware that Indiana is breaking through the floor! He thinks the stamp has something wrong with it.” I added that although this comes with the stereotype that the librarian is outdated and old, the film is set in 1938/1939, and computers hadn’t even come into existence. In fact, as I pointed out, “the first automatic digital computer was not created until 1941, named Z3, and created by the Germans, although the U.S. Navy had developed electromagnetic computers for submarines starting in 1938.” That makes the film worth mentioning.\n\nApart from that, all of these Indiana Jones films are strongly anti-Arab. Jack G. Shaheen, the later Lebanese-American scholar and Journalist, makes this clear in his book, Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Villifies a People. He defines Arabs as “hundreds of millions of people who reside in, and the millions around the world in the diaspora, from 22 Arab states” as I noted in my post in April 2023 about Arab and Muslim librarians in fiction. Shaheen notes that Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has a pro-Nazi Sheikh, Egyptian Christians try and burn Indiana Jones alive, stereotypical images of camels and red fezzes, and brainless Arabs. When it comes to Raiders of the Lost Ark, he describes this as having Indiana Jones shoot Arabs (specifically a famous scene where he guns down an Arab swordsman), evil Egyptians, and a mute Arab wife of Indiana Jones’ friend, Sallah. [13]\n\nNone of the other films that Higgins’ reviewed that I have mentioned so far are mentioned by Shaheen, apart from The Mummy. In his review, Higgins writes that librarians delight in the character of Evie Carnahan, even though he describes her as a sad stereotype, as she is clumsy and her main hobby is reading, while the library is “dusty, stuffed full of books with faux antiquarian bindings.” He then writes that the film is slapstick knowingness and had various sequels. [14] He says nothing about the anti-Arab bias of these films. Shaheen makes this clear. He describes The Mummy as having Arab stooges, scores of dead Arabs, invading Bedouins, Egyptians as props and zombies, and other negative Arab stereotypes. This is continued in The Mummy Lives (1993) and The Mummy Returns (2001). The first of these has Egyptians as ugly and as thieves, while the second “boosts bigotry” through demeaning depictions of Egyptians, including portraying them as evil. [15]\n\nHiggins’ reviews one of my favorite films, Network, which criticizes the power of television networks and their power over the population, talking about how it s a”rotten business,” with radical leftists negotiating with studio executives over “percentages and distribution rights”. He included the film because the New York Public Library is used for a “number of interior scenes.” [16] Like with his other reviews, he completely misses the film’s anti-Arab bias! Shaheen puts the film on his worst list, with various colloquies against Arabs, calling them “medieval fanatics,” including the Saudis, claiming they are “buying up” America, something which cannot be further from the truth. [17] While the film makes good points about television networks, its bias against Arabs is terrible (and disgusting) and should be condemned without a question in anyone’s minds.\n\nThis brings me to four more films that Higgins writes about: Looper (2012), Moon 44 (1990), National Treasure (2004), and National Treasure: Book of Secrets (2007). The first of these films, is described as having paradoxes (like the grandfather paradox) by having time travel as part of the plot, and a “brief-library-visit-as-harbinger-of-trouble scene” which involves Bruce Willis somehow still able to print private medical records, cross-reference individuals from a residency database, and print giant maps of their location from a futuristic public library. He criticizes by noting that this happens in a “highly-surveilled future.” When it comes to the second film, Moon 44, he describes it as being “blue-collar sci-fi,” with the convict teasing the cop about his fondness for reading, as he has a “small library of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century classics in his duffel bag.” [18]\n\nThis is nothing compared to National Treasure and National Treasure: Book of Secrets. He describes the films as having the “greatest library of them all” (Library of Congress) because the protagonist, voiced by Nicholas Gage, wants to do “research on how to steal the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives”. Then in the sequel, he breaks into the library so he can read a book which has presidential secrets within it, saying that hiding a book in a library “makes about as much sense as a Dan Brown plot.” He goes onto say that the Library went out of their way to promote their involvement with National Treasure: Book of Secrets, but says the films are “derivative and joyless, as hyperactive and intellectually stimulating as a game of Snap.” [19]\n\nI don’t disagree with his assessment of the films. Funny enough, I’ve rarely mentioned it on this blog, only in a post about recently-added titles back in January 2022 and in an introductory post on this blog. There’s a reason for this. I have primarily written about it on my aforementioned Wading Through the Cultural Stacks blog. In fact, I’ve written about it almost 10 times on there, from one of the first posts, and I did a whole treatment of the film, noting it has historical inaccuracies, bad preservation practices, and a stylish archivist named Abigail Chase. I noted that some argue that the film’s depiction of archivists reinforce stereotypes, and that since documents or information is stolen from archives it “implies that archival holdings have value”, with the implication that archivists are custodians of paper and “representatives of history.” Chase, to her credit, appears to be professionally trained, which is unique to see for a fictional archivist.\n\nWhile I could cover more of his reviews, I feel this post is long enough, so I’m cutting it off for now and will focus on more of his blogs later on this year. Until next week’s post, about love in the fictional library!\n\n© 2023-2024 Burkely Hermann.

I’d like to talk about socioeconomic class and fictional librarians, a topic which I want to focus on more on this blog, after writing extensively about race and librarians, noting Black librarians, White librarians, and Latine librarians. In this post, I’ll point to how radicals see the role of libraries, bourgeois sensibilities of librarians, and beyond, noting those fictional librarians in anime, Western animation, webcomics, film, and much more. This post is speculative at times, but it provides an opening to this subject which can be expanded in later posts. Perhaps I could have done more for this post, but it still seemed worth writing.\n\nWell-known radical theorists, like Vladimir Lenin, have often recognized the role of the library, especially to the general public. In fact, even Mao Zedong, later the leader of socialist China, was once a librarian. Others called armchair revolutionaries “librarian-type revolutionaries” as opposed to other revolutionary activists. This even makes an appearance in Jack London’s famous book, The Iron Heel. Kim Il Sung was called a “librarian Kim” or “librarian Song Ju” since he was in charge of the library at the Yuwen Middle School. [1] A 1925 publication also described a crisp librarian in a blue dress in the Soviet Union, noting that there were 63,000 books in the stock room of the Central Labor Union of Moscow. A 1961 publication profiled Tasya Matveyeva, librarian in Shchelkovo. In the latter case, she was noted as having library training, including going to library school, and argued you need to know your readers and they have to recognize that “our advice about books is worth following”. [2]\n\nDespite this focus by revolutionaries, radicals, and others, recognizing the importance of libraries and librarians, a good number of actual librarians are often “middle-class.” They can be said to have bourgeois sensibilities. Scholars Caitlin M. J. Pollock and Shelley P. Haley noted that social justice activism, literacy, and literary cultural production intersected for educated Black women of this class. Pollack and Haleyalso inferred that class and colorism “played a role in which Black women were placed in librarian positions.” Otherwise, it has been said that White feminism, which some librarians embody, focuses on concerns of “middle class” and upper class White women while White women of other classes are disregarded\n\nSome scholars have further argued that White masculinity is a form of domination, building uponother forms of dominance, including heterosexuality, so-called “middle-classness,” cisgender identification, and Westerness. This interlinks with the arguments, as I’ve noted in the past, that colonialism, racism, class oppression, patriarchy, and other forms of oppression are “integrated into libraries.” I even asked whether a fictional librarian (the unnamed librarian in an episode of She-Ra: Princess of Power) could critically reflect and recognize how his “race, class, ethnicity, ability, sexual orientation, gender, and so on, intersect, and contextualize that within his experience.”\n\nIn previous posts, I’ve pointed out specific librarians who seem to have bourgeois sensibilities. This included the unnamed “buff” librarian in an Totally Spies! and possibly the one briefly shown in My Life as a Teenage Robot. Otherwise, I haven’t specifically noted socioeconomic class in any of my other articles, apart from noting class prejudices against sex workers as shown in King of the Hill. It is something I will try and do more in the future, following this post’s publication. It is important to recognize that White and so-called “middle class” values not only are “inherent to both librarianship and professional job searching” [3] but are more broader in the profession and institutions.\n\nFor instance, Myne (voiced by Yuka Iguchi) in Ascendance of a Bookworm, in many ways, crosses class barriers. It may be the reason she has developed enemies. She is reincarnated in the body of a young, sickly girl, and was, in her previous life a college librarian (possibly one who was well-off). Her family is firmly working class. They detest the nobles, the only ones who have books. Myne tries to change this by working to ensure that books are available to everyone, even she has to make an alliance with a merchant and become a priest.\n\nContrast this with Japanese students like Hisami Hishishii in R.O.D. the TV, Yamada in B Gata H Kei, Azusa Aoi in Whispered Words, Fumi Manjōme in Sweet Blue Flowers, Fumio Murakumi in Girl Friend Beta, and Himeko Agari in Komi Can’t Communicate, to give a few examples. All of them are student librarians and are not, presumably, paid for their labor. Their class position is not known, but all, or some, may be what some may call “middle class.” This diverges from Aruto, Iina, and Kokoro in Kokoro Toshokan (also known as Kokoro Library) who have a library with some resources, but seem to live relatively simply. So, it’s hard to say if they are well-off, since they all wear maid uniforms for an unexplained reason. [4] Other fictional librarians are different.\n\nFor instance, there are at least four librarians I’ve found who all work as student librarians at elite or special schools: Chiyo Tsukudate in Strawberry Panic!, Anne and Grea in Manaria Friends, and the unnamed librarian in an Akebi’s Sailor Uniform episode (“There’s No School Tomorrow, Right?”). They likely have such bourgeois sensibilities, while Iku Kasahara and Asako Shibasaki in Library War may be more working-class, to give two other examples.\n\nRin Shima in Laid Back-Camp is a perfect example of a character who appears relatively well-off. She can drive anywhere in her moped and always has the supplies she needs for her camping. She is even able to convince her bosses in Laid-Back Camp Movie to let her do a project with her friends to build a campground, taking time out of the office, a form of privilege. On the other hand, she is shown, in the movie, as engaging in overwork in more ways than one, and is often tired from her job. So, it is not known how much she is making. Additionally, she sleeps at the information desk when she was in school. That may say something about her home situation.\n\nShe is in a much better position than Doctor Oldham in Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet who lives on a floating city of sorts. There are undoubtedly distinct social groupings in Gargantia. But, it is hard to say that Oldham has any sort of privilege, or how class manifests itself there. As such, he is not far above manual laborers. He varies from the unnamed librarians in Revolutionary Girl Utena episode (“The Sunlit Garden – Prelude”), at an elite academy, and the assorted librarians in episodes of Bibliophile Princess. The latter are presumably royal librarians. Both have some level of privilege.\n\nThat brings me to Black characters such as Lydia Lovely in Horrid Henry episode (“Horrid Henry: Computer Whizz”), Clara Rhone in Welcome to the Wayne, unnamed librarian in We Bare Bears episode (“Our Stuff”), O’Bengh / Cagliostro in What If…? episode (“What If… Doctor Strange Lost His Heart Instead of His Hands?”), and unnamed librarian in Little Demons episode (“Possession Obsession”). In the case of Cagliostro, he is a priest of sorts, meaning he is living in the library itself. This contrasts with Lydia and the unnamed librarian in Little Demons and We Bare Bears who may be in more stable situations, and may have some so-called “middle class” sensibilities. Of course, we can’t know for certain, as we never see them in their home environments. Compare this to Clara, who lives in an apartment building, and may not have many possessions of her own.\n\nWhile some librarians are priest-like and have some status like Wong in What If…? episode (“What If… Doctor Strange Lost His Heart Instead of His Hands?”), others are basically royal. This includes Mira an Sahi in Mira, Royal Detective episode (“The Case of the Missing Library Book”), who are both Indian. The difference comes with the unnamed librarian in We Bare Bears episode (“The Library”), who may be in a similar situation to the unnamed Black male librarian earlier in the series. Again, it is hard to determine her class from simple deduction, but she may be what some call “middle class.” This is likely also the case for Desiree in Too Loud, but it is hard to know for sure.\n\nSome other librarians clearly have some privilege, like Mateo in Elena of Avalor. He is a royal advisor to the kingdom of Avalor. In such a society, royals are presumably the upper class, although there are capitalists, of sorts, like Dona Paloma. This contrasts to Ms. Herrera in Archie’s Weird Mysteries episode (“The Haunting of Riverdale”) and Bobby Daniels in The Ghost and Molly McGee episode (“Bad Boy Bobby Daniels”). Both seem, from various clues, to be working-class, or on the edge of being working class. It is not known if this is the case with other various librarians in animation. [5] None of these librarians appear to have a maid equivalent to Aoi, who is also a student and lives with Reimi Itsushiro in the series Healer Girl.\n\nMoving onto White women librarians, many appear briefly. As such, it is hard to make any broad determinations about them, when it comes to their class position. However, there are a few exceptions. For instance, Mrs. Higgins in Sofia the First episode (“The Princess Test”) works in a royal academy, meaning she has some level of privilege. In contrast, other well-known librarians like Kaisa in Hilda, Violet Stanhope in Archie’s Weird Mysteries (“The Haunting of Riverdale”), and Francis Clara Censorsdoll in Moral Orel, may be working-class, although there isn’t enough to give a full determination of their class positions. Furthermore, any privilege that Amity Blight in The Owl House had dissipates when she breaks with her wealthy family and joins Luz Noceda, her girlfriend, and is even stranded in the human realm, without a home! This differs from the snooty, and often controlling, attitude of librarians like those in DC Super Hero Girls episode (“#SoulSisters Part 2” ), Kick Buttowski: Suburban Daredevil, or Miss Dickens in Carl Squared (“Carl’s Techno-Jinx”) and Rita Book in Timon & Pumbaa episode (“Library Brouhaha“).\n\nOften, these librarians shush patrons and seem to look down on them, in an attempt to show they have power, when the patrons don’t. This differs from less-controlling, and more even-headed, librarians in other media. Again, very little is shown about them, as they are used to further a story, then forgot about in the next episode. Such librarians are employed as plot devices, nothing more, nothing less. [6] Even so, there are those which seem disturbed by moral transgressions like the one in the Beavis and Butt-Head episode “Cyber-Butt.” She faints when she sees patrons looking at pornography on a computer. Others become literal guardians. Archie the Archivist in Regular Show wants to defend analog media by any means necessary.\n\nSome librarians appear to have enough privilege to throw their jobs away. For instance, Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, throws everything away to become a rockstar. Others are literal princesses, such as Turtle Princess in Adventure Time and Adventure Time: Distant Lands, and Twilight Sparkle in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and My Little Pony: Equestria Girls. Then there’s Dantalian (or Dantalion) in As Miss Beelzebub Likes. He is a youthful looking demon and the librarian of Pandemonium’s library. He has read all 700 million books in the library. Also, he likely has some elevated position Contrasting this are characters such as Wan Shi Tong in The Legend of Korra and Avatar : The Last Airbender. Wan is a magical owl who made a name for himself and is a defender of the library’s knowledge. But, he never leaves the library.\n\nThis deviates from those librarians like Cletus Bookbinder in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends who openly support oppressive systems. Cletus seems to have an air of elitism about him. As such, he may be of a higher class position than his patrons. He also is likely not working class like other fictional librarians. [7] Still, those like Mr. Ambrose in Bob’s Burgers, and Mr. Snellson in Mysticons (“Happily Never After”), are likely not working class. Snellson specifically is snoody and dismissive of the protagonists. Additional librarians like Anthony and Barebones in Brownie and Barebones, Valerie (the librarian) in Spidey Super Stories, and Mo Testa in Dykes to Watch Out For are also arguably “middle class” as well.\n\nThis differs from Suzie in Sex Criminals on the edge (since she and her partner, Jon, are criminals, hence the name of the comic), as are two others who are student librarians: Sabine in Sabine: an asexual coming-of-age story and Fiona Standish in The Fantasy Book Club. Similarly, Gabrielle in I Lost My Body works a second job, making me wonder whether she is actually making good pay at the library or not. Then there’s Prysia in Smitty and Majesty. She worked in a royal library, while an unnamed librarian in Zatanna & the Ripper worked in a well-off library. Similarly, Stewart Goodson in The Public might be called “middle class.” Mr. Anderson in the same film is a manager and Myra is in a similar living situation. Jayla Morgan in The Fantasy Book Club is a Black woman, library science professor, and special collections curator. She may be compensated well, but that is speculation. [8] This could also be the case for an unnamed Black librarian in All the President’s Men and unnamed library supervisor in I Lost My Body.\n\nThere is much more which can be written about fictional librarians and their socioeconomic class positions. This post provides an opening to write about this topic in the future. After all, some librarians have argued that the ALA which “represents the interests of middle management and upper management,” cozy with the federal government down to local governments. They also argued that a worker’s union as it “includes everyone from paraprofessionals to directors of large systems.” This means those who are considered “middle” and upper class. In the end, there is much more that can be said about this topic, so this post only opens this subject, as there is no doubt that some fictional librarians are affluent while others aren’t.\n\n© 2022-2023 Burkely Hermann.

The Soviet article notes that she took classes on “the professional subjects—principles of library science, bibliography and cataloging—she took courses in education, psychology, literature and history.” It also says that the “library in a small town is an important part of its cultural life” and that librarians “work a seven-hour day.” It also says that library schools “offer a five-year course of study and train librarian-bibliographers for large libraries” and says there are “134,500 public libraries in the Soviet Union, not counting scientific and other specialized libraries” with a total collection of books “somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 billion volumes.” It also said the Shchelkovo Soviet spends 124,000 rubles a year, has a collection of 40,000 volumes grouped in ten catalogue divisions like “reference, general political, Marxism-Leninism, science, technology, history, physical culture and sports, linguistics, literary criticism and fiction.” It adds that on Monday the library is closed and “she has breakfast with her husband, sees him off to work, takes her six-year-old daughter to the kindergarten, tidies the house and prepares dinner.” On page 61, it says that “the library is a vital part of the town’s cultural life” and it runs “frequent forums and writer-reader get-togethers.”\n\n[3] Galvan, Angela. “Soliciting Performance, Hiding Bias: Whiteness and Librarianship,” In the Library with the Lead Pipe, Jun. 3, 2015.\n\n[4] It is not known if Isomura in Let’s Make a Mug Too episode (“The Garden of Sky and Wind”) is the same way, but she may be, and could be working class but just has nice clothes. That is possible. It could also be the case for the unnamed/uncredited librarian in Gabriel DropOut (“Fun Forever After…”), the four unnamed/uncredited librarians in Cardcaptor Sakura episode (“Sakura and the Summer Holiday Homework”), two librarians in Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (“My Senpai is a Bunny Girl”), and an unnamed nurse (librarian) in Spy x Family (“Stella”). There’s also student librarians in Kin-iro Mosaic aka Kinmoza (“The Girl on My Mind”), My Roommate is a Cat (“What Connects Us”) [Nagisa Yasaka], Shikimori’s Not Just a Cutie (“Cultural Festival I”) [Kamiya], Oresuki [Sumireko Sanshokunin a.k.a. “Pansy”], Azumanga Daioh (episode 19 segment “Springtime of Life”) [Female Student B (librarian)], K-On! (“Finals”), Encouragement to Climb: Next Summit (“1st Season: Spring”), and in Myself ; Yourself (only in episode “The Important Melody”) to give a few examples.\n\n[5] I’m referring to the unnamed librarian in Dexter’s Laboratory episode (“The Blonde Leading the Blonde”), the librarian in The Simpsons episode (“Homer Goes to College”), the librarian in The Owl House episode (“Lost in Language”), and Lorraine Murillo / La Llorona in a Craig of the Creek episode.\n\n[6] This includes unnamed librarians in Steven Universe (“Buddy’s Book”), Futurama (“The Day the Earth Stood Stupid”), Martin Mystery (“Return of the Dark Druid” and “The Warlock Returns”), and Rugrats (“Quiet Please!”), as very little is shown of these characters. The same could be said about the librarians in Zevo-3 (“Zevo-3”), Ms. Hatchet in Kim Possible (“Overdue”), Mrs. Shusher in The Replacements (“Quiet Riot”), the Bookmobile Lady in My Life as a Teenage Robot aka Teenage Robot (“The Boy Who Cried Robot”), Arlene in Phineas & Ferb (“Phineas and Ferb’s Quantum Boogaloo”), Ms. L in Dexter’s Laboratory episode (“Book ‘Em”), Marion the Librarian in Hanny Manny, and Millie in Madagascar: A Little Wild (“Melman at the Movies”), along with the unnamed librarians in My Life as a Teenage Robot aka Teenage Robot (“Shell Game”), The Owl House (“Thanks to Them” and “Lost in Language”), Phineas & Ferb (“The Doonkelberry Imperative”), The Flintstones episode (“The Hit Songwriters”), Phineas and Ferb (“Dude, We’re Getting the Band Back Together”), Amphibia (“True Colors”), Uncle Grandpa (“Back to the Library”), and those in multiple episodes of The Simpsons (“Last Tap Dance in Springfield”, “The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace”, “Brother’s Little Helper”, “Sweets and Sour Marge”, “Eeny Teeny Maya, Moe”, “No Good Read Goes Unpunished”, “Bart the Mother”, “Dial “N” for Nerder”, “The Color Yellow”, “Dead Putting Society”, “Lisa the Greek”, and “Marge On The Lam”, “Margical History Tour”, “Looking for Mr. Goodbart”, and “Sweets and Sour Marge”).\n\n[7] This may include the librarian in Sarah and Duck episode (“Lost Librarian”), Harold in Craig of the Creek, and Library Clerk in The Simpsons episode (“Bart’s Girlfriend”). Since they live in magical realms, it is hard to know about the old librarian in She-Ra: Princess of Power (“Three Courageous Hearts”) or the unnamed librarian in Sofia the First (“Forever Royal”?). The same is the case for the non-human librarians in Big City Greens (“Quiet Please”), Courage the Cowardly Dog (“Wrath of the Librarian”), Teen Titans Go! (“Magic Man”), and Prisoner Zero, and others such as Blinkous “Blinky” Galadrigal in Tales of Arcadia, Libro Shushman in Teamo Supremo (“Word Search”), Kaeloo in Kaeloo (“Let’s Play at Reading Books”), Bat Librarian in Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (“Mystic Library”), Mr. X in Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood, Little Squeak in Colonel Bleep, Val the Octopus in Dora the Explorer (“Backpack”), Mumm-Ra in Fudêncio e Seus Amigos (“Biblioteca Maldita”), and Flippy in Happy Tree Friends (“Random Acts of Silence”) to name a few.\n\n[8] The class position of the librarians in Diamond Dive, Boyfriends, Merlin’s Story, Detective Comics, along with Mr. Scott in Tamberlane, Lara in Action Comics, Rupert Giles in Giles: Girl Blue, Grandpa Bats and Mina in Grandpabats and the Library of Infinite Worlds, Skeezix in Guillotine Public Library, Barbara Gordon in Huntress: Year One, Ghost in Library Ghost, Karma in Mekanix, and Crawley in Library of Ruins, to name a few that cannot be determined.\n\nToday is the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, which was memorialized by UNESCO in July 1998 to memorialize the transatlantic slave trade. As such, it makes sense that the intersection of White womanhood and fictional librarians should be analyzed. After all, to give one example, Vani Natarajan, the departmental and program librarian for the Humanities and Global Studies at Barnard, speaks about the persistent investment in White womanhood in librarian depictions. [1] If you wish to learn about the transatlantic slave trade and its abolition, I suggest you read a book from your local library on the topic. This post does not pander to any audience, nor does it memorialize any librarians, or riff on popular culture. Instead, it connects a day when there is a focus on oppressive systems White people were a part of to depictions of White womanhood among fictional librarians. As a warning, there will be spoilers for all the shows discussed in this post.\n\nResearch and Instruction Librarian Natarajan, who is cited at the beginning of this article, has argued that tropes of White womanhood are used in Library and Information Sciences (LIS) to enact White supremacy within the profession and “as part of a broader United States nationalist project”. This has resulted in White woman becoming the “default stewards of librarianship” and library space itself. [2] Fobazi Ettarh, a librarian who have cited on this blog frequently, has similar arguments. She argues that when experiences of White woman are thought to represent experiences of all women, then complexities of those who have multiple identities are ignored. She said that this is as true in LIS as it is in Disney animations like Tiana. She further proposed the concept of “Nice white lady syndrome” which she defined as a phenomenon which occurs when femininity is weaponized and combines with White fragility. In her words, this is exhibited by well-intentioned, non-confrontational, and female-presenting individuals who are earnestly and idealistically eager to help marginalized people but only as long as they feel comfortable. When they don’t feel comfortable, this allyship dissipates, with “wounded countenance” which centers them as being the victim. [3]\n\nThis manifests itself in series like The Simpsons, which I wrote about back in March of this year. For instance, there are various spinster librarians, with some defying the stereotype, while embodying others, like Martha, who is hinted as gay. Others in the series are either school librarians or work in a public library. [4] Specifically, in The Simpsons, there is an elderly White female school librarian, who even feeds a chopped up old book to pigs in the episode “Sweets and Sour Marge”, and unintentionally dances with one of the characters in another episode. Clearly, no books are sacred in this library! In other episodes, there is a librarian who is more formal and proper, and one who is more of a spinster, closing a library because of a silverfish infestation. This librarian is often voiced by Maggie Roswell, an later by Tress MacNeille. [5] In addition, there is a librarian who is also a spinster who tells Reverend Lovejoy that he has checked out the bible every weekend for the last nine years and asks him if it would be easier to just buy a Bible instead, with Lovejoy saying he could do that on a “librarian’s salary,” implying that librarians make a lot of money, even though they do not. As I noted in that post, many librarians, classified as “Library Technicians and Assistants” barely earn a living wage.\n\nThe show also features a human and robot librarian in a future-vision, an unnamed prison librarian (voiced by Tress MacNeille), two implied lesbian librarians in one episode, and others, like one wearing a green blazer operating a cash register in the episode “”Sweets and Sour Marge”. Many of these librarians, who are almost exclusively White women, are helpful or on good terms with Lisa Simpson, the child intellectual of the Simpsons family. However, some librarians are corrupt, like one voiced by Valerie Harper who pockets money given to her by Bart for information in the episode “Looking for Mr. Goodbart”. [6] As I noted in my post earlier this year, librarians in The Simpsons all have different styles, with some more relaxed and some more formal, while episodes consistently show libraries as “places of information, learning, and knowledge, used especially by Lisa” and also highlight information deficits. At the same time, some librarians can fall into existing stereotypes of spinsters.\n\nIt is hard to say whether any of these librarians exhibit “Nice white lady syndrome” as the librarians are rarely, if ever, shown interacting with people of color during the show, as the yellow-colored characters, which comprise most of the cast, are equivalent to White people. Even while the library in The Simpsons may have good hours (8-12 on every day of the week), as shown in the episode “In Marge We Trust”, in one episode, “The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace”, Homer goes to a children’s library because of “unpleasantness” at the main public library, from where he appears to be banned, or Homer being kicked out of the library for treating it like a convenience store. In another, Abe Simpson, Homer’s father, notes old people aren’t allowed in the library, at least maybe him and some others. [7]\n\nDue to the fact that almost all of the librarians in The Simpsons are White women, they are spreading the message that they are the default as librarians and in library space. This ends up reinforcing White supremacy within the profession, since it supports that idea that experiences of White women librarians represent experiences of all librarians, and ignores any complexities, to bring back what Fobazi Ettarh said, as I noted earlier in this post. It also ends up falling in line with the arguments of Naum Efimovich (N.E.) Ischlondsky (Ishlondsky) a Russian physiologist and chemist, who said, in his 1926 book, as translated by Henry S. Penn, that librarians are “splendid librarians” because they demonstrate a “truly phenomenal ability in memorizing the largest catalogue.” His reasoning is that female sexual hormones which do not depress nerve centers controlling memory, but “stimulate them and support their splendid development and vital activity.” He further claimed that these hormones do not “exercise as they do in man, any stimulating influence on the centers of logical perception”. These sexist arguments are line with other arguments he makes which appear to be homophobic. [8]\n\nThere are many White librarians beyond those in The Simpsons. Most prominent in recent years is Kaisa in Hilda, Amity Blight in The Owl House, and Naoufel in I Lost My Body, and Sabine in Sabine: an asexual coming-of-age story. All of them engage in library duties. Kaisa is shown shelving books and assisting patrons with their inquiries at the Trolberg Library. Amity reads to children in the library’s children’s corner at the Bonesborough Public Library. Naoufel works at a local library in France, and has an older (and stricter) librarian wearing glasses as her boss who more fits the library stereotype than her. Sabine is a college student who is works in the library on campus as a part-time job.\n\nNaoufel and Sabine do not appear challenge the library organization and its structures which reinforce White supremacy and other oppressive systems. They just go about doing their jobs. However, Kaisa and Amity stand up to their bosses. For instance, the presumed bosses of Kaisa, a committee of three witches, almost threatens to send her into the void for not returning a book. Amity ends up getting fired when going into the forbidden stacks to find a book to help a girl she likes Luz Noceda, who later becomes her girlfriend. Knowing the job means so much to Amity, Luz goes through various trials so that Amity can get her job back! She clearly is not working in the library by later in the series due to various circumstances which threaten the world itself, and use of magic. Like Kaisa, she is also a witch.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Amity would, like Kaisa, would resist White supremacist, or otherwise oppressive, systems. She would be no “Nice white lady”. On the other hand, Sabine may not be either, and nor would Naoufel, but neither stand up to their bosses so far. The latter appears to be the same for White female librarians like Mrs. Higgins in Sofia the First, or unnamed librarians in various episodes of Steven Universe, Futurama, DC Super Hero Girls and Zevo-3. However, the librarian in Zevo-3 is hauled away by goons from the repressive government for a false charge of hacking in a confidential government database in the first episode and never seen again.\n\nLibrarians which support the existing system undoubtedly include obscurantist and often hostile White women in films such as All the President’s Men (1976), Citizen Kane (1941), Hidden Figures (2016), and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002). The latter includes a librarianish archivist named Madame Jocasta Nu, who I have often discussed on my sister blog Wading Through the Cultural Stacks. The same support for the existing system may even be the case for Mary Bailey in the bizarre world of Pottersville in It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), who is assaulted / harassed by an out-of-his-mind man named George Bailey, along with the frightened librarian in the beginning of Ghostbusters (1984), or the reference librarian in Can You Ever Forgive Me? (2018). [9]\n\nJust as dedicated to the system are controlling shushers like Turtle Princess in Adventure Time, Miss Dickens in Carl Squared, Ms. Hatchet in Kim Possible, Mrs. Shusher in The Replacements, Rita Book in Timon & Pumbaa, Ms. L in Dexter’s Laborat"
