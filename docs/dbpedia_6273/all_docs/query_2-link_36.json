        "text": "Scholar Megan Watson has argued that “effective leadership” in libraries is still defined in typically White masculine terms, despite increasing gender parity and research showing benefits of “non-normative decision-making practices.” As a result, female leaders often mix White male qualities such as “assertiveness, confidence, and decisiveness” which can be tempered by characteristics such as “kindness, empathy, and deference.” This approach has extended to women of color who are library leaders, who often want to avoid the perception they are angry, troublesome, bossy, or dangerous, which undermines their access to positions of power and management. She argues that White culture in libraries is interconnected with organizational inertia, with women of color encouraged to comply with structures of their oppression in order to succeed. At the same time, she says that while White women are hindered by gender inequity in academic libraries (and elsewhere), their Whiteness still allows them to “access and wield hegemonic privilege and power.” The latter is often paired with the idea professional success is the result of “individual hard work and merit,” resulting in White feminist neoliberal thinking. Watson suggests that leaders dismantle and question hierarchical systems which place power and influence in “hands of a select few” who often “look, sound, and act like them.” [1]\n\nWhile librarians in animation, film, and elsewhere, often only appear briefly, there are few White men, and even few who have bigger roles in these episodes. These characters can be analyzed based off Watson’s arguments, and those of others. This includes the old librarian in She-Ra: Princess of Power episode (“Three Courageous Hearts”), the unnamed librarian in an episode of Sofia the First (“Forever Royal”?), and Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, among many others. This post is relatively shorter than my post last week, but I still see it as important nonetheless.\n\nThe librarian in the episode of She-Ra: Princess of Power, voiced by George DiCenzo, looks, and sounds, like an elderly White man. While it has been noted that there is a “lack of racial diversity in academic librarianship,” it is true of librarianship as a whole. Binh P. Le wrote, in July 2021, that throughout history “library leadership positions, regardless of the type of library…have been held by White males.” So, the librarian in this animated series being a White man is not a surprise in that respect. His role as a librarian implies that White men are to be respected and be in positions of authority. However, he is not in a leadership position. As such, he can’t use any “assertiveness, confidence, and decisiveness,” nor is he technically tied to White culture in libraries, as the series is not set on Earth.\n\nThe same is, arguably, the case for other librarians as well. For instance, Swampy in Phineas and Ferb, who is voiced by Steve Zahn, is only a librarian in his debut episode. Even worse, he dumps his responsibility on two elderly White women (the other librarians) so he can help two White kids, who he doesn’t know before this, play a song to rekindle the relationship between the parents of these kids. It sounds bad when you really think about it. If that isn’t enough, he insults the library as old fashioned and seems bored with his job. It is unlikely that he attempted to disrupt Whiteness within the library where he worked.\n\nMoving on, there’s Librarian in an episode of Sarah and Duck (“Lost Librarian”) and Harold in Craig of the Creek (voiced by Matt Burnett). In the case of the first, he almost cedes his authority to the patron, Sarah, and her pet duck, who help him find the paper catalog, which happens to have all the names of the patrons in it. The fact that the catalog is on paper rather than digital, which is how many libraries organize information these days, gives the impression that libraries are old-fashioned. In contrast, although Harold is a bit grouchy and possibly annoyed with his job, he still helps patrons, no matter their skin color, and even allows a section of the library for books made by patrons themselves. That’s an ingenious way to get buy-in from patrons. He is also very passionate about his work as a librarian. He likely is disrupting Whiteness, either consciously or subconsciously.\n\nThis differs dramatically from the library guardian Archie the Archivist (voiced by John Cygan) in Regular Show or Barebones in Brownie and Barebones. The former embodies the idea of a librarian as a keeper of the books, a guardian of knowledge. This can also signify that the librarian is a bit of a gatekeeper. That, obviously, has racial connotations, as such a role can be used to keep material from Black people, or even “objectionable” material from White people. Barebones, on the other hand, is one of the most easygoing librarians ever. By that I mean that he often leaves work early, leaves a mess, and travels to other worlds. After all, he is a dragon. He leaves his White gay workaholic boss, Anthony, to go on adventures with his good friend, Brownie. As I said in my aforementioned post:\n\n…he doesn’t want to do his job and slacks off from work, yes. Also, he is not shown shushing anyone. He also steals books from the library…[and] sometimes he accidentally lights books on fire too…he wears glasses…[and] is British…there aren’t that many series I have watched as of yet, with British librarians, so that makes him different from other librarians. He also is skipping out on work all the time, more interested in going on adventures than going to the library where a strict Anthony is his boss.\n\nIn this way, he is similar to Julian in The Vampire Librarian, a White man who is masquerading as a librarian, when he is actually a vampire. Julian’s colleague, Beth, is a witchy librarian. In that way, both are bucking the norm, and not upholding the system. As for Barebones, he only cares about his job enough to earn some money, but not enough to be wedded to it, and he can easily leave his job when he wants.\n\nThis contrasts with Stewart Goodson in The Public, who is played by Emilio Estevez, and Blinkous “Blinky” Galadrigal in Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans. In the case of the latter, he is a non-human librarian, voiced by Kelsey Grammer. He is a White man when in human form, but not in the film. He is just as dedicated to knowledge as Stewart, a library assistant at a Cincinnati branch library in the film. In the sense that he stands with the homeless people instead of the library administrators, Stewart is disrupting Whiteness. Blinky is not, however, as it is only temporarily human and is more often a troll.\n\nThe worst librarian of the lot is Cletus Bookbinder in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends. He appears in one episode, which is broken into various parts. He allows, and encourages, a man with a gun to abduct two of his patrons, finding them as an annoying nuisance. Even Rocky and Bullwinkle are “problem patrons”, it still would not justify what happens in this library. In many ways, he supports the existing power structure and is glad about his role.\n\nThere are many other librarians in animation and webcomics. [2] The latter includes Rex Libris in Rex Libris, but I cannot say much on him as I have not yet read Rex Libris. Once I do, I could write more about him more than the Wikipedia page says, or the official website which calls him, comically, “…a true guardian of knowledge, foe of the foolish, defender of the Dewey Decimal System, and the best hope for the future of civilization.” In the end, while there are many other White librarians that could be examined, this post is only a beginning to this topic, one that can be expanded more in the future.
