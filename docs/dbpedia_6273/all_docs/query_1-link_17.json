        "text": "It's quite clever and quite cute, in a 10-minute-joke-stretched-into-a-feature kind of way.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Mar 26, 2024\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle is directed by Des McAnuff, who presumably took on this chore after the failure of his imaginative, challenging version of Ted Hughes's The Iron Giant [which he produced]. Very sad.\n\nFull Review | Mar 26, 2024\n\n...the picture eventually segues into a frenetic and mostly kid-oriented midsection that slowly-but-surely drains one's interest...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Oct 1, 2020\n\nIn their natural pen and paint environment, Rocky and Bullwinkle shine. But they seem as dull as dishwater, and completely out of place, in a live action world. Hence, their Adventures never connect with viewers.\n\nFull Review | Feb 26, 2020\n\nRocky and Bullwinkle's CGI effects recall its antecedent Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and like that film its dialogue is packed with cultural references that will have adults laughing harder than the kids.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Apr 16, 2019\n\nWhile the movie continually teeters on the brink of abject corniness, it never quite topples off. And it doesn't hurt to have Robert De Niro, Rene Russo and Jason Alexander camping it up as cartoon villains come to life.\n\nFull Review | Jan 18, 2018\n\nKids will enjoy it, even if the jokes escape them.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Dec 28, 2010\n\nAll things considered, I got more fun out of the much maligned earlier attempt of bringing characters from the show to film, Boris and Natasha.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 26, 2010\n\nExpected punny dialogue and sight gags ensue, but also packed in are pointed, self-deprecating barbs about Hollywood, moviemaking, and the conventions of cartoons themselves.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 7, 2010\n\nThese complaints are mere trifles compared to the fun I had at seeing my favorite moose and squirrel again.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | May 26, 2006\n\nIf you liked the 1960s cartoon series upon which this film is based, you'll like this film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | May 4, 2004\n\nThere's just not enough depth of thought to sustain it onscreen for 90 minutes.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Apr 29, 2003\n\nAll of this adds up to a story we don't care about with nothing particularly involving and about two laughs both in the first ten minutes.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Dec 8, 2002"
