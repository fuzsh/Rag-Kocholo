        "text": "Everyone's favorite moose and squirrel, Rocky and Bullwinkle, are back in an all-new live-action adventure! Those ruthless spies, Boris (Jason Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo), have wrangled their way into the real world...while their Fearless Leader (2-time OscarÂ® winner Robert De Niro) is plotting to take over America. Only Rocky and Bullwinkle can save us, but first it's up to squirrel and moose to foil Fearless Leader's scheme to destroy the world! This fun-filled, pun-filled comic adventure picks up where the much-beloved series left off, spoofing television, politics, higher education, the Internet and especially themselves. They prove once again that laughter is ageless, timeless and in Rocky's case, weightless."
