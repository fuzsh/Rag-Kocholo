Add source\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the decade of the 2020s picks up speed, it’s sometimes fun to look back at the previous decades to see how the media we watch today changed and took shape through so many years. One form of media that dominated the younger audience were cartoons and ‘50s cartoons are surely some of the greatest. Simple but catchy, cartoons of the ‘50s are some of the most original and creative content we can experience on our televisions and streaming services. As the assortment of cartoons has grown since the ‘50s, one can marvel at just how fun and relevant to modern society these cartoons are.\n\nSome ‘50s cartoon characters are still remembered not only by the older generations, but also by the newer generation, who were introduced to them by their parents and grandparents. The character duo of Tom and Jerry has been able to stay relevant even after so many years. The ‘50s cartoon style is a unique one. With the focus given more to hand-drafted images, creatives in that decade had to think outside the box. With little to no help from computers and machines, this decade gave some of the most beautiful stills to look at and learn from. Even these days, people redraw the characters of 1950s cartoons while staying true to the style that made them unique.\n\nSure, when cartoons in the ‘50s had to focus more on the children's audience, it was only normal for them to be more child-friendly. These days, the variety of cartoons to choose from is massive, with some focusing more on the grownup audience exclusively. Still, when we have so many of the best cartoons to choose from, it’s important to remember the decade of the ‘50s, when cartoons were all fun and joy. If you are up for a nostalgic journey through the past, take a look at the list below to see what cartoons defined the 1950s and what they were about. Upvote the ones that you have heard about or have watched, and comment below if you have a favorite episode of the series shown.\n\n#1\n\nLooney Tunes Bugs Bunny\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1930\n\nProbably one of the most famous cartoons in the history of television, Looney Tunes was able to not only survive the 1900s but also stay relevant during the 2000s and early 2010s. With Bugs Bunny holding the wheel of the show as the main character, this show created and established so many characters, with some even remaining part of our current pop culture.\n\n#2\n\nTom And Jerry\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1940\n\nA series able to reach many different generations, Tom and Jerry is one of the few cartoons of the ‘50s that is still alive today. American animated comedy Tom and Jerry follows a foolish cat's never-ending hunt for a cunning mouse. Jerry is the vivacious mouse, while Tom is the persistent cat. The characters hardly ever spoke; the action and visual humor carried the entire series.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#3\n\nThe Woody Woodpecker Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1940\n\nOne of the more modern famous series, The Woody Woodpecker Show is a show that not only dominated the screen of the 1950s but was also revived in the upcoming decades following the ‘50s. With the simple premise focused on the character Woody the Woodpecker, this show was able to bring awareness to the woodpecker bird for the people who tuned in to watch this show.\n\n#4\n\nThe Yogi Bear Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1958\n\nWhile not having a series of his own at the start, Yogi the Bear did appear in some of the 1950s series that were quite popular. Yogi is a smooth-talking bear who not only helps educate children about the dangers of nature, but also how to preserve it so that they can enjoy the trees and animals outside the windows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#5\n\nThe Heckle And Jeckle Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1956\n\nA single bird can be annoying, but two - now that's a show. Heckle and Jeckle, two cartoon birds created by Paul Terry, are the stars of the famous ‘50s cartoon The Heckle And Jeckle Show. Known for their smartness and cleverness, these birds annoyed other characters and were also seen interacting with other famous cartoon characters of that decade.\n\n#6\n\nMighty Mouse\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1955\n\nA mighty figure does not always have to be a huge figure. The Mighty Mouse Playhouse was an anthology-style cartoon featuring the main hero, the mighty mouse. Much more so than the original film shorts, the series is credited with popularizing the Mighty Mouse figure in mainstream culture. Though Mighty Mouse wasn't particularly well-liked in theatrical cartoons, he remained Terrytoons' most well-liked character. Television is what turned him into a cultural icon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#7\n\nFelix The Cat\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1958\n\nNothing says strange like a magical cat with strange powers. Felix the cat, the protagonist of the Felix The Cat series, traveled with a magic bag that can manufacture goods as well as alter shape, form, and function. The Professor would usually come up with some crazy plan to try and take Felix's magic bag.\n\n#8\n\nThe Huckleberry Hound Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1958\n\nIf there is a magic cat, you can be sure that there is a talking dog… with a southern accent. While Huckleberry Hound is the protagonist of The Huckleberry Hound Show, not all focus was given to him. An array of characters existed in this show, each with unique talents and abilities. Every episode began and ended with the shot of Huckleberry Hound.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#9\n\nThe Road Runner Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1949\n\nThe Road Runner Show is possibly the best example of why one shouldn’t give up on dreams or ambitions. While at first being part of the Looney Tunes universe, Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner soon became household names and in the ‘60s even got their own cartoon series to boast about.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#10\n\nThe Ruff And Reddy Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1957\n\nWhile cats and dogs are not known for their friendliness to each other, this show perfectly displayed what kind of shenanigans both of them can come up with. The Ruff And Reddy Show is a show about the exploits of Reddy, a courageous and kind but not particularly intelligent dog, and Ruff, a clever and dependable cat.\n\n#11\n\nThe Bullwinkle Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nA moose and a squirrel go to a bar and become an instant classic duo in the cartoon universe of characters. Bullwinkle, a lovable but clumsy moose, and Rocky, a brave flying squirrel, have continuing adventures in this series. While the old series might start some fires due to the design of the main villain, the renewed series of the 2018s is much more friendly to modern culture.\n\n#12\n\nMr. Magoo\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1949\n\nWhile not having his own independent series, Mr. Magoo's character did have a lot of short episodes released during the 1950s, some of which were nominated for a few Oscars. Mr. Magoo is an elderly guy whose eyesight is deteriorating, but he is either unaware of this or is too stubborn to acknowledge it and/or take action.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#13\n\nCasper The Friendly Ghost\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1945\n\nCasper The Friendly Ghost has made a name for itself in every household in the world. If there is a strange sound, or if your keys disappear, it must surely be the work of Casper, the friendly ghost. As the name gives away, in his series Casper made a ton of friends, but also a few annoying enemies, who either hurt him or his friends.\n\n#14\n\nFractured Fairy Tales\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nModern for its time, starting as a segment of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends, Fractured Fairy Tales reimagined favorite fairy tales from children’s childhoods with a ridiculous modern twist, featuring a crazy ensemble cast of princesses, fairy godmothers, evil queens, and trolls.\n\n#15\n\nHergé's Adventures Of Tintin\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1957\n\nWith the cartoons on this list focusing more on the English-speaking audience, Hergé's Adventures Of Tintin is one of the more famous French cartoon series. The main characters of this cartoon are Tintin and his dog Snowy, who go on many crazy adventures with the aid of Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Thompson & Thomson, and others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#16\n\nPeabody's Improbable History\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nA smart dog is hard to find, but one who wears glasses and hangs out with an even smarter boy? Now that is impossible to even imagine. Peabody, the main character of the cartoons, is the smartest creature in existence and graduated from Harvard when he was just three years old. Going on strange adventures with his friends, this cartoon dog might be the smartest being in all of the cartoon world.\n\n#17\n\nAugie Doggie And Doggie Daddy\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nEven dogs can be super dads to their puppies. Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy are the heroes of the cartoon series named after them - Augie Doggie And Doggie Daddy. The plot revolves around the follies of a super parent who tries his best to improve his son's schooling while sometimes occasionally disliking Bobi because of his lack of discipline. The young puppy, who has an unwavering love for his father, is incredibly intelligent and driven by a desire to achieve his goals and please his father.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#18\n\nPixie And Dixie And Mr. Jinks\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1958\n\nDixie and Pixie, two curious mice with a nice eye for fashion, and Mr. Jinks, a cat, mess with each other in the same way that Tom and Jerry do too. With the show being developed by the same pair of creators as Tom and Jerry, the plot is very similar, but with the constraints of a small budget, two mice and a single cat are not quite on par with the original duo of Tom and Jerry.\n\n#19\n\nThe Mickey Mouse Club\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1955\n\nBeing the poster boy of the cartoon world, Mickey Mouse is the best example of how a character can survive even the hardest of years. With the show oriented at the younger audience, The Mickey Mouse Club was hosted by real people, while also including several animated skits of Mickey Mouse and his friends.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#20\n\nSnagglepuss\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nA character with a long list of accomplished works, this cat named Snagglepuss is one of the most recognized characters currently seen in the media. A pink cat sporting quite an outfit of an upturned collar, cuffs, and a bow tie, this character began to appear in the year 1959 and got a solo cartoon in the 1960s.\n\n#21\n\nThe Gumby Show\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1956\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be found by playing with play-doh, clay, and other easily molded materials. By using the “claymation” method of filmmaking, The Gumby Show was able to stand out from the audience by showing the many adventures of Gumby and his horse.\n\n#22\n\nQuick Draw McGraw\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nA catchy song determines quite a lot for the success of a cartoon. The cartoon Quick Draw McGraw centers on a lanky and stupid mustang horse that wreaked havoc in the Old West. Armed with a six-shooter, horrible times await if he can reach it in time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#23\n\nIvor The Engine\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nEverybody has heard of Thomas the steam engine, but few have heard of Ivor the Engine, outside the country of Wales. The animated series Ivor the Engine centers on the exploits of a diminutive green steam locomotive named Ivor who works for the Merioneth and Llantisilly Railway Traction Company Limited, residing in Wales' \"upper left-hand corner.\"\n\n#24\n\nChilly Willy\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1953\n\nA hero of the cold, Chilly Willy, and the cartoon Chilly Willy, stand side by side with Woody The Woodpecker. The penguin Chilly Willy is trying to reach the goal of staying warm. He tries to achieve this in numerous ways, one being by wearing warm clothes and venturing to distant lands to fulfill his goal.\n\n#25\n\nCaptain Pugwash\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1957\n\nThe villains of the colonial era, pirates became hero-like figures in cartoons, and in the Captain Pugwash cartoon, pirates are the main characters of the story. Captain Horatio Pugwash, the cartoon’s titular hero, navigates the open seas in his ship, the Black Pig, with the help of cabin boy Tom, pirates Willy and Barnabas, and the Master Mate. Cut-Throat Jake, the Flying Dustman's captain, is his most ferocious adversary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n#26\n\nClutch Cargo\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nNot all cartoons are destined for great things, and Clutch Cargo was not able to reach its audience completely. Clutch Cargo, an intrepid man who undertook hazardous missions all around the world, served as the protagonist of the series of adventures. He had his little ward Spinner and his pet Dachshund Paddlefoot with him when he was on the assignments.\n\n#27\n\nMatty's Funnies With Beany And Cecil\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1959\n\nA good duo of characters can make any cartoon a perfect piece of media. Beanie and Cecil, titular characters of Matty's Funnies With Beany And Cecil, joined the more famous Matty character for adventures that awaited them in the seas. In a play on child psychologists, Beanie and Cecil were added to make a statement about the violence on TV.\n\n#28\n\nLittle Audrey\n\nShare icon\n\nPremiered in 1947\n\nLaughter is the best medicine, not a cure for every disease, but the solution, when the time arises.
