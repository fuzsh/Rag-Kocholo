        "text": "Due to this article being so hilariously bad, it is being kept for entertainment purposes. Therefore, please do not delete it.\n\nThis is one of RNW's famed \"how to\" pages. It contains lots of opinions, but may also have just as much vulgarities, gross-out content, satirical humor, and NSFW elements. Also, some of these pages are freakishly long, which pretty much speaks for itself.\n\nThese pages are now considered legacy pages and can no longer be edited by ordinary contributors.\n\nThe Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius\n\nThe show airs on Disney XD from 2009 to the present day.\n\nThe pilot movie doesn't exist.\n\nWhitewash Libby.\n\nHave Cindy be a one-note Helga Pataki clone without anything to distinguish her from Helga.\n\nNick is part of the main gang instead of Carl.\n\nReplace Ultra Lord with Bibleman.\n\nThe animation is done by seinfeldspitstain. You know, the guy that made all those parodies?\n\nPlanet Sheen still exists but is somehow made even worse.\n\nEveryone's voice actors change every season, and the difference is extremely noticeable.\n\nThe single exception is Jimmy, who is consistently voiced by Pamela Adlon doing her Bobby Hill voice.\n\nMake Goddard a regular cat instead of a robot dog.\n\nHugh Neutron is replaced with post-season 8 Peter Griffin.\n\nAdd in product placement for Fortnite, Dove, Six Flags, Mountain Dew, Doritos, Burger King, Sears, RadioShack, NordVPN, Raid Shadow Legends, TikTok, PornHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, McDonalds, Minecraft, Terraria, Friday Night Funkin, Among Us, Honey, Grammarly, ExpressVPN, Skillshare and Aqua Dots.\n\nBONUS: Have the characters interrupt the show for exactly one minute to advertise the product, then threaten the viewer with death if they don't buy the product in question.\n\nSteve Urkel is a main character.\n\nEvery 20 seconds, someone burps, farts, swears, or moans.\n\nAdd syncro-vox mouths, a la Clutch Cargo.\n\nAdd in an episode where Jimmy, Sheen, Cindy, Libby, Nick, and Urkel do nothing but play Fortnite, drink Mountain Dew, and eat Doritos for 30 minutes. Not only that, but the episode has no commercial breaks.\n\nThe theme song is played on a 90's Casio keyboard.\n\nAdd in musical numbers from BTS, Linkin Park, and numerous SoundCloud mumble rappers.\n\nIn addition to Goddard, Jimmy now has a talking Funko Pop of Skipper from Penguins of Madagascar who swears every chance he gets.\n\nShoehorn in offensive messages to every episode (regardless if it's xenophobic or against religion, for example), even if the messages have nothing to do with the episode in question.\n\nAll of the characters have extremely cringy and repetitive catchphrases.\n\nJimmy's catchphrases are \"Woah! High-impact sexual violence!\" and \"GET ME SHEEN ON THE PHONE!\"\n\nSheen's catchphrases are \"Smile, Retroville, say Chuck E. Cheese!\" and \"Fuck off!\"\n\nNick's catchphrases are \"Radical, dude!\" and \"I may have gone too far in a few places!\"\n\nCindy's catchphrases are \"Men are always taking credit for things women are inventing,\" and \"That shit doesn't scare me!\"\n\nLibby's catchphrases are \"Allahu akbar!\" (when she says it, an explosion takes place in the background) and \"Did I do that?\"\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nWhen Pants Attack: Replace the pants with pairs of dirty underwear.\n\nNormal Boy: Replace the \"I'm loopy!\" dance with the Orange Justice from Fortnite.\n\nBirth of a Salesman:\n\nThe fried chicken joke is repeated a total of 25 times throughout the episode.\n\nInstead of candy, the students have to sell RadioShack gift cards.\n\nBONUS: The RadioShack gift cards are replaced with Fortnite gift cards in airings following RadioShack's bankruptcy in March 2017. Make all the fortnite cards $20\n\nThe N-Men:\n\nHave N stand for the N-word instead of Neutron.\n\nJimmy's power is turning into an orange instead of a Hulk-like creature.\n\nBONUS: When Jimmy turns into an orange, he gets eaten by Goddard, killing him.\n\nThe main gang actually dies at the end.\n\nA Beautiful Mine: The main gang ends up killing each other over the astrorubies.\n\nSorry, Wrong Era: Instead of meeting Leppy, Jimmy, Sheen, and Nick encounter a titanoboa who vores them to sexual synthesizer music.\n\nHolly Jolly Jimmy: The episode has nothing to do with Christmas.\n\nLove Potion 976/J: Have Cindy kill Jimmy at the end for rejecting her.\n\nThe League of Villains:\n\nRename the episode to The Last One Forever and Ever (For Real This Time) (We Fucking Mean It), similar to the Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode.\n\nAll of the protagonists die, followed by the villains Fortnite dancing on their corpses.

Later in the episode, they find out the myth is wrong, and the \"monster\" is really a stupid white hexagon thing, who they find in a tree in the backyard.\n\nIn \"Screwy Day\" It's about Screwy getting sick, and Zowie having to take care of him, as she is the only one in the house. In one scene, he complains that his stomach hurts, and Zowie tries to make it better by rubbing it, which only makes it make a few sounds, then he throws up on her.\n\nIn \"Beauty and the Bot\", instead of the episode ending with Polina embarrassing Screwy by making him wear her princess hat, Polina force feeds him raw beef, and when the curtains open, he vomits on the stage in front of the audience.\n\nThe Smurfs\n\nHave Grumpy Smurf be voiced by Uncle Phil.\n\nis that a fucking wishfart reference\n\nI hope not.\n\nReplace Gargamel and Azrael with Rocksteady & Bebop respectively.\n\nReplace the Season 1 theme song with an over-the-top jazz song.\n\nReplace the classical music with distorted One Direction songs.\n\nMake every Smurf ugly (like this thing) and the villains beautiful (like that guy)\n\nGive it scary vibes.\n\nThe show receives a cash cow reboot made in CGI based on the 2011 film on Nickelodeon using up half the timeslots.\n\nHave the original 80s version be made by Filmation and air on local PBS stations.\n\nVeggieTales\n\nHave the show created in 2019 and fill it with 2019 trends that died shortly after.\n\nOne character dies every episode.\n\nMake it a spinoff of Sausage Party.\n\nJunior is a crybaby and is a spoiled brat a la Caillou.

Also, the Grapes of Wrath turn out to be cherry bombs created by Bart Simpson.\n\nIn “Larry’s Lagoon” everyone goes hungry, and they try to find food on the island (and at one point, Bob/Robert tries to eat Larry/Benny and the asparaguses), but they fail to do so, and Bob/Robert, Larry/Benny, and the asparaguses starve to death as a result, yet they're alive and well in the next episode\n\nRename Rack, Shack, and Benny to \"Rack, Shack, And Larry\".

(Wait a second, how does that work? You know, when you and I think about it, a show that focuses on comic-relief characters seems to be rather meaningless.)\n\nMisty's Togepi needs constant care and wears a diaper (because it acts like a baby, duh!).\n\nBONUS: Whenever he needs a diaper change, the poop that comes out is extremely graphic. Then, Ash, Misty, Sonichu, or Brock will go up and scream \"BARF LIKE YOU MEAN IT!\".\n\nDOUBLE BONUS: When he cries, have him cry so loudly you can't hear the other characters.\n\nMisty, Brock, and their Pokémon (except for Psyduck) are killed in an explosion during the baseball game in The Double Trouble Header, leaving Ash and Sonichu to take care of Togepi.\n\nThe music is Disney-esque, using classical instruments and occasionally xylophones.\n\nThe show is very low budget.\n\nThe theme song is ME!ME!ME!

Make it lose every battle in all his forms (yes, even as a speedy little Turtwig.)\n\nPokémon Black and White\n\nNone of Ash's Unova Pokémon evolve, not even the Sunglasses Sandile.\n\nIris's Axew would refuse to evolve instead of wanting to fully evolve.\n\nAll of Ash's Unova Pokémon have the personalities of either Ash's Oshawott or Iris's Emolga, meaning that they would be selfish troublemakers or obnoxious gold-diggers.\n\nTrip's personality is the same one from the Pokémon fanfic Too Much H2O.\n\nSpeaking of which, make that fanfic into a real episode.\n\nPokémon XY\n\nRemove Alexa.\n\nMake Clemont and Bonnie puppets.\n\nRemove Clemont's Dedenne, and replace it with a Magikarp.\n\nPikachu evolves into Raichu by using a Thunder Stone, and Ash believes Pikachu ran away.\n\nKill off Penelope from the \"Kindergarten Chaos!\" episode in her first appearance.\n\nGive it a slight feel of Cool Cat Saves The Kids.\n\nLet the editors of Cool Cat Saves The Kids edit all the episodes.\n\nMake the heroes ugly (like this thing) and the villains beautiful (like that guy)\n\nThe show takes place in McDonaldland instead of Kalos.\n\nHave Serena be a shoddy mary sue.\n\nSerena's Fennekin never evolves into Braixen.\n\nAsh's Hawlucha's theme song is \"Baby Got Back\" and make him twerk while singing.\n\nEvery time Clemont's Chespin shows up, have it dance to a sped up version of PonPonPon (the Kagamine Len and 96Neko cover.)\n\nEvery 7 episodes, a scene from \"Grammar Rock\" appears at the end of each one.\n\nAll characters are voiced by the same person. In this case, Cam Clarke.\n\nAsh's Froakie doesn't evolve at all, thus Ash-Greninja is removed.\n\nIn addition, Ash's Froakie would be very weak and lose every battle.\n\nMake it a show for preschoolers.\n\nAll characters are voiced by only two voice actors, one male and one female.\n\nHave the characters ask the audience questions, especially super easy questions they already know the answers to.\n\nThe conflict is non-existent.\n\nThe characters' eyes sparkle.\n\nThe music is Disney-esque.\n\nMake Squishy the Zygarde a creepy rat.\n\nEach episode has at least two musical numbers.\n\nBONUS: They're more annoying than average mainstream 90's music.\n\nThe backgrounds are full of rainbows and smiling objects.\n\nEach episode ends with the characters going to bed as a sleep-inducing lullaby plays.\n\nPeople working in Dingo Pictures work on the occasional effects like zooming in their faces when screaming and sound effects like the \"wah-wah\" sound.\n\nSun And Moon (the Alola anime)\n\nMake Mallow an agressive alcoholic.\n\nInclude special effects a la EmpLemon YouTube Poops (example: DOWNWARD SPIRAL).\n\nEveryone is voiced by either Cam Clarke, Scott McCord (using his Yang voice), Lisa Oritz or Jennifer Darling.\n\nHave the writers of Total Drama All Stars write all the episodes.\n\nTwo words. Character derailment.\n\nAsh, Mallow, Sophocles, Lana, Lillie, and Kiawe are all 19 years old.\n\nRemove the Team Skull thugs in favor for Team Flare and a heroin addicted Lysandre.\n\nThe opening theme is My Past Is Not Today.\n\nSimilar to The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald, each episode opens with a segment done in CGI where the real Ash has a problem like the one that must solved by him in the episode. In order to become human, Ash opens a magical door that takes him to the human -or in this case, Pokemon- universe.\n\nHave it air on Adult Swim.\n\nHave it drawn in the style of 12 Oz. Mouse mixed with The Nutshack.\n\nEvery character is made to be either the comic relief or voice of reason.\n\nPopplio resembles the prototype design for the 1980s Popples toy. However, Lana's Popplio doesn't.\n\nAsh's Rowlet is a killer owl and Ash's Litten is actually on fire, all the time. He is used as a running gag until his fire is put out by a School forme Wishiwashi using Water Gun on him.\n\nEvery character is designed to be a role model.\n\nThe moral is often -if not always- the complainer is always wrong.\n\nThe background music is mainly 80's disco music.\n\nThe theme song lasts only 10 seconds.\n\nInclude a narrator who explains the obvious.\n\nA PSA is at the end of every episode.\n\nLana's Popplio is a human baby who needs constant care, much like Togepi from the Kanto-Johto section of the article.\n\nBONUS: When she cries, have her cry so loudly you can't hear the other characters.\n\nDOUBLE BONUS: Whenever she shows up, have her sing a cover of Let's Hear It For The Boy by Deniece Williams, but in baby babbles.\n\nTRIPLE BONUS: Whenever she needs a diaper change, the poop that comes out is extremely graphic.

Say Chuck E. Cheese!\"\n\nThe show is a cash cow and solely exists to keep making Pokémon merch.\n\nLillie's voice is 10x more annoying! (only applies to the English dub)\n\nLillie's Vulpix is replaced with an angry baby bear. (yeey bears )\n\nGladion’s Type: Null is killed by poachers, who mistake it for an unidentified bear-esque mutant.\n\nName it \"The Adventures Of Ash and Friends\".\n\nAsh doesn’t win the Manalo Conference, and instead loses to a trainer with lots of Legendary Pokémon (think the Lily of the Valley Conference back in Sinnoh.)\n\nAsh’s Litten and Rockruff never evolve.\n\nJourneys (the Galar anime)\n\nGoh's Scorbunny is treated like another Ash's Pikachu clone, and it doesn't evolve at all.\n\nAsh's Riolu is introduced as a baby sibling for Togepi.\n\nGoh is a huge brat who spends every episode being rude to everyone.\n\nAsh's Dragonite is a Barney the Dinosaur clone who is cheesy and lovey-dovey and sings the \"I Love You\" song from Barney and Friends every episode.\n\nChloe's Yamper is vicious and often bites people.\n\nAsh's Farfetch'd never evolves into Sirfetch'd.\n\nGoh's Sobble is a weak, useless crybaby who never evolves.\n\nAsh's Gengar loses every single battle and never gigantamaxes.\n\nAnimorphs\n\nHave the cartoon not follow the book at all.\n\nThe animals are animated in poor CGI while the humans are animated with bad motion capture.\n\nBarney the Dinosaur makes a few cameos throughout the series.\n\nThe Animorphs sing annoying songs.\n\nHalfway through the series, Bubsy Bobcat shows up and teams up with Visser Three.\n\nVisser Three kills the Animorphs in the series finale.\n\nHave it air on Fox Kids.\n\nAdd a ton of disgusting toilet humor.\n\nAx is a human weirdo lost in the streets.\n\nPopples (1986)\n\nMake the human characters Billy and Bonnie Wagner argue and scream every second.\n\nGive the Popples one-dimensional personalities that make them bland and uninteresting.\n\nChange the background music to unfitting 80's heavy metal songs.\n\nHave Bonnie spank Billy every time he annoys her.\n\nLet Punkster and Punkity never sing.

Alternate titles are \"The Tzatzi Diaz Show\" or \"Tzatzi and Friends\". Whichever one works.\n\nMarco Tzatzi is from a dimension called Tzatdiaz, a dimension related to multiple crimes (such as pedophilia, doxxing, terrorism, drug use, drug trafficking, murder and robbery). It is later revealed that Marco Tzatzi was a weed-smoking cocaine addicted terrorist.\n\nThe show promotes prostitution, incest and the usage of illegal drugs.\n\nHave a bunch of 18-year old high school dropouts write every single episode.\n\nThe show runs for 20 seasons, and each episode ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nAt the end of every episode, a rancid moral appears via a cheesy transition.

When these hashtags show up, a Minimoog cover of the Me!Me!Me! song is heard in the background, followed by an inappropriate, graphic, and/or scary anti-tobacco PSA or a cringy TikTok video.\n\nLet the animation style be drawn with Sharpies and animated with a Cray X-MP supercomputer.\n\nMake every character unlikeable, dumb and annoying, and have them suffer from their own problems:\n\nStar is a stereotypical '70s disco dancer whose catchphrase is \"Burn, baby, burn. Disco Inferno!\"\n\nBritney is a Chinese stereotype who also speaks in unsubtutled traditional Chinese very rapidly, and with poor microphone quality, so no one will understand what she's saying.\n\nMake Pony Head an overpowered Mary Sue, and she's also voiced by Haven Paschall using her Serena voice.\n\nLudo is a chainsmoker who has the same personality as Bendy from Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends (like with Bendy, he never get his comeuppance).\n\nJackie is revealed to be a stripper.\n\nGustav is replaced with a flamboyant homophobe named Gary.\n\nKill off Alfonso and Ferguson, and replace them with modern versions of Glenn Quagmire and Peter Griffin respectively.\n\nStar is voiced by Michaela Dietz (using her Riff voice) and Tzatzi is voiced by Lesslie-Cara Rudolph (using her Abby Cadabby voice).\n\nThe theme song is Vagina by CupcakKe and the credits song is a nightcore version of Mask by Dream.\n\nThe first 5 episodes are set in a town at the US-Mexican border, and in later Season 1 episodes, the setting is moved to dangerous parts of Los Angeles, and, finally the end of season 1 (and the rest of the series altogether) are set in North Korea.\n\nSeason 2- is given frequent crossovers to bad versions of TV shows set in North Korea (explained below).\n\nThe phrase \"I'm a magical princess from another dimension!\" is said 100 consecutive times in a row at the start of every episode.\n\nIn each scene, there is a camera that moves into places where it shouldn't.\n\nEveryone in the show is a Tumblr user or a TikToker. Tzatzi however is a Tumblr, Know Your Meme and Uncyclopedia user.\n\nBONUS: Marco Tzatzi also admins a cat meme page on Fakebook.\n\nThe budget is very low, and we're talking Paddy The Pelican levels of low.\n\nBecause of this, frequent stock sound effects and animation errors will be present.\n\nThe lip syncing will also be off at times.\n\nThe series is made to be a huge cash cow and solely exists to sponsor companies like McDonald's, NFL, Apple, Disney and the Partnership For Drug-Free Kids.\n\nMuch of the background music consists of crappy combinations of songs (such as this, which gets used the most).\n\nIn every episode, Félix (Adrien's prototype character for the Miraculous Ladybug anime PV) shows up, no matter what and gets more screen time than anyone else.\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nSeason 1\n\nStar Comes To Earth\n\nMarco Tzatzi comes to Earth instead with her parents.\n\nHer parents are also killed in a smoke explosion in their first appearances.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Star and Marco Tzatzi are treated to heroin, meth, weed and alcohol by Ludo.\n\nParty with a Pony\n\nMarco Tzatzi falls into the spike bed.\n\nMatch Maker\n\nRemove the \"I got an F for Fantastic!\" and \"A-plus with a smiley face\" lines in favor of cheap and cliched lines.\n\nMarco Tzatzi stabs Mrs. Skullnick with a Ginsu knife at the end of the episode.\n\nSchool Spirit\n\nMarco Tzatzi commits a shooting with Star at the football game.\n\nMonster Arm\n\nStar gets the monster arm instead.\n\nMarco Tzatzi - you guessed it - kills Jeremy with a Sonic Blade kitchen knife.\n\nThe Other Exchange Student\n\nAsh Ketchum is shoehorned into the show without permission from the creators of Pokemon.\n\nHave Star, Marco Tzatzi and Ash Ketchum hire a firing squad to kill Gustav Gary.\n\nThe Banagic Incident\n\nThe Banagic commercial is replaced with an airing of modern Family Guy, which is playing in ridiculous slow motion.\n\nRecess\n\nChange the show's title to \"TJ & Friends\".\n\nMake Ms. Finster and the other adults do absolutely nothing.\n\nReplace the music with overly cutesy and babyish stock music, which they never fit in this show with kids acting as teens.\n\nHave the Recess Gang act like teens or babies instead of kids.\n\nReplace Bonky with Barney.\n\nVince is not athletic, and in the first season, his name is Vans. His catchphrase is \"A large mouthed crocodile scene!\", which is said every time he gets surprised or interested.\n\nTake out any satire in favor of lame, corny pop culture references.\n\nHave the show made and take place in 2013.\n\nReplace Randall with Perry from The Brothers Grunt.\n\nHave the characters interact with the audience every now and then.\n\nInclude toilet humor in TJ's speeches.\n\nMake any animals in the series talk, being voiced by such celebrities as Adam Sandler and Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\nAdd Ren screaming during every mention of the word \"Whomp\".\n\nHave the kids not even sounding like kids at all.\n\nPut in annoying musical numbers that teach people to be rude, selfish, etc.\n\nLet Toon City animate all the episodes.\n\nMake Yope the 7th member of the Recess Gang.\n\nGus has permanent flu, and he is at school via TV on wheels.\n\nHave it advertise deadly weapons and aim such ads at young kids.\n\nBesides weapons, add a product placement for 90's children's toys that received controversy and let the characters sing about it sometimes.\n\nAny animation errors are intentionally made to hypnotize children.\n\nKevin from Ed, Edd n Eddy, Billy and Bonnie Wagner from Popples, and Eric Cartman are TJ's cousins.\n\nKing Bob is a bratty kindergartner.\n\nRetool the show after Season 4 and have it air on Playhouse Disney.\n\nHave it cancelled after the movie.\n\nThere's a segment titled \"The Part Of The Show Where The Lovely Ms. Finster Sings A Song\".\n\nHow to Ruin the Episodes!\n\nIn \"The Break-In\", it is in its pilot version from 1996, only with changes from above to mess it up even more.\n\nIn \"The Experiment\", have TJ kiss Ashley A. instead of Spinelli. (CUE THE TJXASHLEYA SHIPPING JOKES!)\n\nIn \"Jinxed\", Gus is forced to listen to the Miffy and Friends theme song 100 times in a row.\n\nIn \"Teacher's Lounge\", the lounge is actually a large, filthy prison.\n\n\"One Stayed Clean\" is replaced with a 10-minute animated version of the 1994 Chuck E. Cheese commercial where a boy grows old from waiting for his food. TJ replaces the boy though.\n\nI guess someone would make a script for that episode.\n\nIn \"Nobody Doesn't Like TJ\", Nobody does anything for a vast majority of the episode.\n\nIn \"Big 'Ol Mikey\", Mikey's dream is actually a reality.\n\nHorrid Henry\n\nHave it air on Nickelodeon.\n\nmika counters this: it already does in its native UK as of 2020 lol\n\nRemove Beefy Bert.\n\nMoody Margaret is more annoying.\n\nEach episode is based on a GoAnimate grounded video, with GoAnimate text-to-speech voices.\n\nThere are incredibly stupid fart jokes, and they are said frequently.\n\nPerfect Peter is actually the one behind all the mischief Henry is blamed for. Peter, however, is really smart, so knows how to get away from it all the damn time. (Kinda like this video in this link)\n\nThomas & Friends\n\nMake the show rated for adults\n\nMake Daisy even more feeble than Dennis.\n\nInclude toilet humor from season 8 onwards.\n\nNo educational value.\n\nHave all troublesome trucks and diesels swear and call the characters racist names.\n\nEveryone's face is the one in the picture: (If anyone can find it, that is.)\n\nHave dangerous and safety-ruining crashes.\n\nCall it \"Thomas & Percy\".\n\nProduct placement for a creepy anti tobacco campaign is in a episode, despite the series taking place in... whatever time period it takes place in.\n\nThe theme song is a instrumental cover of \"Neon Lights\" by Kraftwerk, played on a Roland Jupiter-8 by what sounds like a 8-year old boy.\n\nHenry loves strong pornography over special coal.\n\nAny goof (like equipment visible in the frame) is intentionally made to hypnotize viewers.\n\nThe Great and Powerful Trixie's face is flashed onscreen to hypnotize viewers.\n\nJames is named Speed Racer or Jamesphie. Also, he is faster than those bullet trains in Japan.\n\nEdward is a depressed character who tries to commit suicide every episode. He is also voiced by Denise Oliver.\n\nAnd he finally commits suicide in the movie.\n\nFfarquhar is now named after the city Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch.\n\nDiesel 10 is a giant baked potato on wheels with a face.\n\nWorsen the voices in the CGI seasons.\n\nThink about Thomas the Constipated Tank Engine, or Emily the Old Chain Smoking Scottish Stirling Single.\n\nThe show airs late at night on BBC 2 (then it would be the laughing stock of the channel probably?).\n\nBBC 2 then dissolves because of this.\n\nOh, and the show replaces the BBC 2 idents (yes,m including the iconic 1991-2001 idents).\n\nThe voice actors are:\n\nEdward: Denise Oliver\n\nPercy: Charlie Sheen (using his Dex Dogtective voice)\n\nJames(phie)/Speed Racer: Maria Darling (using her Roary the Racing Car voice)\n\nThomas: Rob Paulsen (using his Coconut Fred voice)\n\nThe original version is animated with bad motion capture, while the CGI episodes are animated like in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.\n\nEdward comes back as a zombie in the 15th season.\n\nThe learning segments are replaced with offensive humor.\n\nMake it the same as family guy, except more racist and violent\n\nMake Annie and Clarabel jerks.\n\nBob The Builder (original series)\n\nBob is voiced by Josh Peck In the US dub later on in \"Project Build It\".\n\nAdd a 1 hour series finale of Project: Build it called \"Bob The Bully” with swearing in it. And make that said episode similar to the 2004 Rated R film \"Mean Creek\".\n\nCancel the series after Project Build It.\n\nThe machines are jerks to each other.\n\nSpud is addicted to meth, complete with graphic sores on his face.\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nTravis Paints The Town\n\nRename It to \"Travis And The Nuclear Waste\"\n\nReplace the white paint with Nuclear waste.\n\nPostman Pat (Original series)\n\nReplace Jess the cat with a rabid bulldog named Rob who bites and attacks people.\n\nTotal Drama\n\nInclude Dora, Elmo, Nina (from Nina Needs to Go!), Angela Anaconda, Milo (from Mars Needs Moms), the Mega Babies, D.W. Read, and Caillou as contestants\n\nAll the first-generation contestants sans Alejandro and Sierra die due to a shark attack in the first season.\n\nYet they're alive and well in subsequent appearances.\n\nChris is a serial killer, and also an avid user of methamphetamine, complete with graphic sores on his face.\n\nIn World Tour, the contestants sing nothing but Justin Bieber songs.\n\nAnd the songs from Dora the Explorer.\n\nTake out any funny scenes in favor of stock footage of children throwing temper tantrums.\n\nWhich come from the shows \"Supernanny\" and \"Nanny 911\"\n\nHave the animation look like Mega Babies.\n\nThe challenges are easier to the point that even preschoolers can do them, like building a tower with building blocks.\n\nInclude a product placement of Toys R Us in one episode and have the contestants sing about it.\n\nNot having The Ridonculous Race for a spin-off.\n\nLet some celebrity voice all the characters since that's the formula of this list.\n\nAll marshmallows are toxic, like in Revenge of the Island. (Once eaten, they stay normal for a few minutes, and then freeze and fall down.)\n\n& knuckles NOPE.\n\nHave the show air on Nick Jr. (An unusual black sheep of the channel?! Oh boy...)\n\nReplace the theme song \"I Wanna Be Famous\" with \"One Thing\" by One Direction.\n\nThe show is produced by Cookie Jar (now a part of DHX Media).\n\nChef never appears.\n\nAnd is replaced with Fred Figglehorn.\n\nCamp Wawanakwa is taken over by Flutterbat and Pahkitew/ScrewYouitew Island is taken over by the Care Bears (in their Atkinson Film-Arts appearances).\n\nMake the credits move so fast, that you can't read anything.\n\nPahkitew Island is called ScrewYouitew Island.\n\nAnd is an island that floats in the air under a stormy sky.\n\nThe show is made just to sell toys under 30 minutes (like many 1980's cartoons).\n\nChef/Fred dances especially at inappropriate times. Sometimes, he'll do Fortnite dances.\n\nBrick is named Broke.\n\nHave Dave win the Pahkitew Island (or rather ScrewYouitew Island) season instead of either Sky or Shawn.\n\nMike and Zoey are in EVERY. FUCKING. SEASON.\n\nRemove the spinoff series (ARE YOU EVEN CRAZY).\n\nGravity Falls\n\nBill Cipher is a small, weak Dorito that acts like a MLG person, attempts anyone to get rekt, but fails to do so, and is scared of having to be eaten (Maybe it would be his true form).\n\nPeridot makes cameos sometimes.\n\nDon't forget Rosalina fetish videos\n\nMake the animation style Jim Jinkins + Old Spongebob and also a little Cyriak\n\nKill off Bill in his first appearance (And that makes him have only one appearance in this show)\n\nTo kill him off, Dipper shoots Bill Cipher with a gun that kills him off and quickly turns him into a Dorito, and Soos eats Dorito!Bill up anyway.\n\nAnd because of this, Bill Cipher informs L'il Gideon that he gave up and tells L'il Gideon that he'll never get the Mystery Shack now (despite that they are no longer teaming up though), then the part where JonTron hangs himself with a nooze happens. L'il Gideon replaces JonTron though.\n\nMake it cancelled after 13 episodes (Meaning Dreamscapers will be the last episode, and some episodes before it are skipped.)\n\nAfter Dreamscapers (This version's series finale), make some successors to this show, but add it with characters and junk not related to Gravity Falls what so ever.\n\nAnd also a nude picture of Mr. Magoo and that Lego SpongeBob set which costs lots of dollars online.\n\nAnd there's some freaks like some lazy couch potato that never does his job to do anything and also lives in his basement and a two-year old named Charles for example.\n\nAnd make it CGI too, as of 2018. (Calobi Productions reference?)\n\nKill off Stan!\n\nIn \"Soos And The Real Girl\" (in one of this version's successors), replace GIFany with Yandere from Yandere Simulator. Plus remove the \"Crazy for you Soos!\" line.\n\nThe show airs on Qubo (then it would be the laughing stock of the channel probably)\n\nThe music is played on a poor-quality Casio keyboard.\n\nPeople working in Dingo Pictures work on the occasional effects like zooming in their faces when screaming and sound effects like the \"wah-wah\" sound.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nMake it a preschool show named The Adventures of Bart Simpson.\n\nIronically, the cancelled Arabic dub, Al-Shamshoon, was targeted for kids.\n\nHave the characters ask the audience questions.\n\nMaggie poops in her diaper occasionally. Also, she cries so loud that you can hardly hear other characters.\n\nRemove the comedy and replace it with shoe-horned educational value.\n\nThe conflict is non-existent.\n\nThe characters' eyes sparkle.\n\nThe music is Disney-esque, using classical instruments and on some occasions, xylophones.\n\nDiC Entertainment produces it. (I like DiC, but let's face it: DiC would ruin The Simpsons.)\n\nThe animation for all episodes resembles the unaired version of Some Enchanted Evening.\n\nOveruse the moral \"The complainer is always wrong\" for every episode.\n\nThe theme song is just \"The Simpsons\" but over and over again instead of just once.\n\nMaggie is demoted to a minor character, let alone a wall flower.\n\nHomer loves candy and apple juice over donuts and Duff Beer.\n\nItchy and Scratchy is a non-violent cartoon throughout the entire series (like in Itchy and Scratchy and Marge).\n\nHave the show air on NBC's Saturday Morning block instead of Fox.\n\nNo guest appearances.\n\nNo Couch Gags or any other gag for that matter.\n\nNo references to popular culture.\n\nThe opening sequence is only 10 seconds long, exactly like in “Sideshow Bob Roberts”.\n\nLisa's personality is a clone of Bart's (like in the Tracey Ullman shorts).\n\nKrusty is named Buddy.\n\nEvery 5 to 20 seconds, a character sneezes or hiccups.\n\nEach episode has at least ten musical numbers.\n\nThe Kwik-E-Mart is named Q-T-Mart.\n\nThe backgrounds are full of rainbows and smiling objects.\n\nReveal Marge's rabbit ears that were supposed to be shown in the finale.\n\nEveryone is voiced by either Rob Paulsen (using both the Bubsy and Coconut Fred voices) or Sue Rose (using her Angela Anaconda voice).\n\nEach episode ends with the characters going to bed as a sleep-inducing lullaby plays.\n\nBart Simpson's theme song is \"Everyone Has Feelings\" from Care Bears in the Land Without Feelings.\n\nMilhouse is a surfer boy who uses lingo that nobody cares for anymore.\n\nLisa Simpson's theme song is \"Care-a-Lot\" from The Care Bears Movie.\n\nThe animation for all episodes resembles the unaired version of Some Enchanted Evening.\n\nwtf is that\n\nThe credits music is Baby by Justin Beiber\n\nFamily Guy\n\nMake the show's title \"Funny Times with the Griffins\".\n\nHave it be in live-action with no off-color humor or cutaway gags, and transform all non-human characters into Muppet-esque puppets (think the Lois and Bonnie puppets from Foreign Affairs). The entire series is filmed in front of a live audience with VHS tapes and a Super-8 Video Camera. Also, you can hear the camera man breathing.\n\nHave it air on Fox Kids in 1991, and it is entirely produced by Sid & Marty Krofft Productions.\n\nHave Stewie and Brian be called \"Dewy\" and \"Drunky\" respectively, and Quagmire is a drug dealer named Willie.\n\nAfter the airing of Life of Drunky, the series gets an animated reboot with no off-color humor, but rather bland, poorly-executed jokes and Smosh-esque comedy. The characters are styled to look like humans from He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special and voiced by the cast of Full English. The animation for the reboot looks like a mixture of The Christmas Tree (1991), Clutch Cargo, Angela Anaconda and Barbie and the Nutcracker.\n\n\"Scratch out\" Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.\n\nReplace the \"Iraq Lobster\" song with \"OMG\" by Jenna Rose.\n\nPeter loves orange juice over Pawtucket Patriot beer.\n\nVarious characters' personalities are changed. For example, Meg is a bossy and sassy valley girl, Drunky is short-tempered and bites people and Lois is a paranoid self-diagnosed hypocondriac.\n\nPeter eats something every 5 to 60 seconds.\n\nLois mostly screams her sentences. And to add insult to injury, she also has a speech impediment.\n\nAdd Larry and Steve to the show. (Thus, it would be too confusing on why the prototypes have to be in the same world as the released one.)\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nIn \"Road to the Multiverse\", replace the scene where Stewie/Dewy and Brian/Drunky enter a dimension where all people have to immediately go to the bathroom with a scene where Stewie/Dewy and Brian/Drunky enter a Lego universe and replace the scene where Stewie/Dewy and Brian/Drunky enter a dimension run by lesbian men with a scene where Dewy and Drunky enter a Funko Pop universe. Oh, wait...\n\nIn \"Life Of Brian/Drunky\", Vinny (who is renamed Buddy) stays with the Griffins forever.\n\nIn \"The Tan Aquatic With Steve Zissou\", Dewy dons blackface instead of going tan.\n\nIn \"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\", kill off the Koreans, Soo-Jin and Willie. In addition, Winter Summer did not exist and it is replaced with some illegally produced VHS copies of Captain Planet and The Christmas Tree (1991) that both play in ridiculous slow motion.\n\nIn \"A Lot Going On Upstairs\", Peter, Joe and Cleveland aren't confided into the attic by Lois, but rather a chicken coop. A filthy, freaking chicken coop.\n\nIn \"The Kiss Seen Around The World\", remove the Star Trek presentation scene and all scenes where Meg expresses her hatred for Neil are cut out.\n\nIn \"The Finer Strings\", Monsanto Equals Murder is removed and is replaced with Rappin' For Jesus.\n\nIn \"Saturated Fat Guy\", Peter does not get stuck in his food truck.\n\nIn \"Gronkowsbees\", Peter goes and parties with Rob Gronkowski.\n\nCourage The Cowardly Dog\n\nInclude a narrator who states the obvious, like in Peppa Pig.\n\nThe narrator is the only one in the show who does actual dialogue, the rest of the characters only scream.\n\nAir it on Adult Swim.\n\nThe colors are overly bright a la Problem Solverz.\n\nHow to ruin the episodes\n\nIn \"King Ramses' Curse\", King Ramses is replaced by Mario's Floating Head from Mario Teaches Typing who says \"Beware the diving boards!\" And also, the banana god song is replaced with the song, \"We Are Number One\" But it's very loud, So loud that Eustace's head explodes.\n\nIn \"Perfect\", Courage has another nightmare that involves Giygas who then says, \"You're...... Next......\"\n\nDemon Slayer\n\nreplace all the characters to the ones from Boku no Pico.\n\nrename the anime to Boku no Pico\n\nthe show airs in 2006\n\nYou do know that it's impossible to replace a show with another show, right?\n\nMiss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends\n\nMake the animation even more low budget.\n\nSquirt's name is Bob.\n\nShimmer is voiced by Harley Bird, using her Peppa voice. Also, she cries and throws tantrums, especially in the ruined version of \"A Cloudy Day in Sunny Patch\".\n\nBounce is renamed to Fart, and he farts instead of bounces. Also, he constantly makes very annoying dog noises all the time (barking, whining, howling, etc.), and his catchphrase is an also very annoying \"AWOOGA!!!\".\n\nDragon is a generic baby dragon with no personality who is only there to sell merchandise, like plushies and a Tamagotchi-like toy. He voiced by David Winn, using his Lumpy voice.\n\nWiggle is an obese spider who keeps his older voice from \"All Pupa'ed Out\", only more annoying. He also overeats and cries a lot.\n\nSpinner is a nerd whose voice gets more annoying as the series goes on.\n\nPansy and Snowdrop constantly get into annoying arguments throughout the series.\n\nSpiderus looks more disturbing and gruesome, and he still has his sharp teeth from the \"Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids\" pilot movie; he takes pleasure in killing and eating other bugs.\n\nThe characters swear in every episode.\n\nThe snake kills every bug in sight in every episode she appears in, although the bugs show up in the next episode completely unharmed.\n\nWhenever a certain bad thing happens to a bad character (e.g. Shimmer in the ruined version of \"A Cloudy Day in Sunny Patch\" and Spiderus in the ruined version of \"A Sticky Situation\" and \"Hum Bug\"), it manages to make you feel sorry for them, which makes you hate them and the show even more, because you shouldn't feel sorry for them.\n\nThe background music is played poorly with limited instruments.\n\nMake the Miss Spider Lost Episode Creepypasta by Irving Snordfelt a real episode.\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nIn \"A Sticky Situation\", Spiderus actually eats Squirt/Bob and Bounce/Fart. After that, when he ends up getting stuck in the pine sap, he dies, and becomes a fossil for all eternity. However, despite this, he shows up alive and well in his next appearance.\n\nIn \"A Cloudy Day in Sunny Patch\", Shimmer cries and throws tantrums throughout the entire episode, and it ends with Shimmer crying and throwing a tantrum while covered in cake, with her birthday completely ruined.\n\nIn \"Hum Bug\", Spiderus eats Bounce/Fart (like in this edit), and develops an appetite for bugs instead of berries. So he goes on a murderous rampage, in which he kills the earwig family, until he gets stuck inside the plant. Then the episode ends with him staying trapped inside of the plant until he dies. However, despite this, he shows up alive and well in his next appearance.\n\nIn the near end of \"The Jitterbug\", Squirt/Bob falls off his web again and instead of landing on Pansy's web surfer, he falls to the ground, causing a huge amount of blood to splatter everywhere. Later on, the other buggies in sunny Patch are shown to be at Squirt/Bob's funeral, yet he's alive and well in the next episode.\n\nThe episode \"Fungus Among Us\" can be ruined in either one of these ways:\n\nVersion 1: The mushrooms that Wiggle brings back are more poisonous. Spiderus never comes free from the mushrooms blocking his home, even though he shows up unharmed in his next appearance. Then when we get to Wiggle's nightmare - which is real - the mushrooms plague the entire world and when Wiggle swallows the spore, he chokes on it, and dies, immediately before coming back to life as a mushroom-shaped version of himself, only more disturbing. The episode ends with him screaming in agony, now a mushroom for all eternity.\n\nVersion 2: The episode is entirely \"Among Us\" themed, in which the \"Fungus\" is entirely cut out, and the plot is changed to Wiggle bringing home an imposter crewmate, which reproduces and kills every bug in Sunny Patch, until eventually, Wiggle accidentally swallows an imposter crewmate, causing him to transform into one. The episode ends with him screaming in agony, now an imposter crewmate for eternity, almost just like how \"Version 1\" ended.\n\nChange the title of \"Dam the Puddle\" to \"Damn the Puddle\". Also, Felix and his family move away from Sunny Patch forever at the end.\n\nIn \"Frog in the Moon\", Felix actually does return, but he falls to his death at the end, and never comes back for real.\n\nIn \"Moon Music and Sun Songs\", the singing/music is replaced with heavily drinking tequila to the point of projectile vomiting graphically. However, the crickets' howling/screaming is kept, but it's louder and more annoying. Eventually, Spiderus massacres the crickets with an AK-47.\n\nIn \"Bringing Up Shrubby\", Shrubby dies.\n\nIn \"Stuck On You\", Dragon, Spinner, Bounce/Fart, Pansy, and Snowdrop all become fossilized by the syrup. However, they show up unharmed in their next appearances.\n\nIn \"Eclipse\", Ned and Ted's fears actually come true, in which \"somebuggy\" actually does eat the sun, rather than an eclipse, causing the gruesome end of the world.\n\nBlue's Clues\n\nHave Paprika be very bossy and sassy, and frequently insults Cinnamon.\n\nHave Blue bite people.\n\nHave Steve host all episodes.\n\nBefore you say anything about Joe, Steve had to leave because he was balding and wanted to pursue a musical career. It was either have Joe live the show to its tenth anniversary or have the show get cancelled entirely.\n\nHave it air on the regular Nickelodeon schedule.\n\nHave Blue's Room in all episodes.\n\nA running gag is having Blue shove things up her butthole.\n\nAdd too many clues to confuse the kids (the amount of clues would be 10).\n\nFill it with tons of animation errors.\n\nAnd boom mics dropping into shot.\n\nAnd hands going through Mailbox (that happened in one episode).\n\nAnd Knuckles\n\nAnd itching powder. Steve would not control it.\n\nand knuckles\n\nThe songs are more annoying than bad 90's mainstream music.\n\nMake Steve run around all over every scene, especially in inappropriate situations.\n\nMailbox only sends spam messages.\n\nSlippery Soap melts in his last appearance.\n\nTickety-Tock is nothing but a sun dial.\n\nA talking one.\n\nShovel and Pail are replaced with psychotic characters known as Knife and Axe. They also try to kill Steve in every episode.\n\nNo education value.\n\nBlue and Magenta act like rabid wolves at least once an episode.\n\nThe show gets cancelled in 2002 due to Steve leaving, making \"Something to Do Blue\" the last episode.\n\nThe tree from \"The Wrong Shirt\" is in the living room in all episodes. Plus, it grows a mean, scary face slowly as the series progresses.\n\nFive words: \"A sock in a bakery.\"\n\nWe find out the \"Really Great Book\" in one episode is about... you guessed it... porn.\n\nMake an episode fully around toilet humor.\n\nReplace the background music of some songs with the soothing sounds of transformers arcing and exploding.\n\nThe \"Glasses\" song from \"Magenta Gets Glasses\" is nothing but Steve and Miranda saying \"Glasses\" over and over while Whip It by Devo plays in the background.\n\nHave there be product placement for the Easy Bake Oven and the Queasy Bake Cookerator. Seriously, look the second one up.\n\nThe Handy Dandy Notebooks are the dry-erase (and reproduction) ones you find on eBay.\n\nBRAIN FASHION is in every episode before Blue puts the pawprint on the screen.\n\nStephen King writes all episodes.\n\nAdd product placement for toys like the Pepsi Talking Vending Machine, with the characters saying \"Buy (insert toy here) or else you get tickle tortured!\".\n\nThe first episode, Snack Time, is product placement for co-op shops (a Kenner Big Burger Grill would be seen) and Irn-Bru.\n\nThe Moon in the credits of the Pajama Party episode is voiced by, who else, but Frank Welker using his Dr. Claw/Soundwave voice.\n\nSidetable leaves midway through some episodes to go to \"The Box\"\n\nHer voice actress Aleisha LaNaé Allen was a regular on Out of the Box, so why not?\n\nAdd whip cracks for every animated character's arm or leg movement (think Johnny Test, but more painful to listen to!)\n\nSidetable Drawer talks in gangster lingo (Her voice actress is black).\n\nThe Toilet Song from \"Morning Music\" is replaced with the song in the video.\n\nSteve swears every few minutes.\n\nCountless fart jokes are frequent.\n\nHave a controversial episode dedicated to everyone talking about religion.\n\nThe music is Disney-esque, using classical instruments and occasionally xylophones.\n\nNo reboot.\n\nPB&J Otter\n\nMake the title characters spoiled brats.\n\nThe show is called Rottenz Sandwichz Otterz\n\nPeanut has bloody fangs and sparkling eyes (That's like a Twilight rejection).\n\nJelly sounds like she went through puberty.\n\nButter has an evil, creepy voice and is an overpowered Mary-Sue. Also, she cries so loud, you can't hear the other characters.\n\nOpal is an alcoholic mother (Now that wouldn't be appropriate for kiddies, amirite?). She is also named Ohf***you.\n\nFlick is a rat named \"Plague\".\n\nMunchy is a stereotypical nerd with an annoying voice.\n\nThe Raccoons are hyenas instead of their namesake species.\n\nThe Noodle Dance goes like this: \"Noodle Dance! Noodle Dance! Noodle Dance! Noodle Dance! Noodle Noodle Noodle Noodle Noodle Noodle Noodle Noodle! Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Dance Noodle Dance Noodle Dance NOODLE DANCE!\"\n\nThe Noodle Dance background has light strobe effects. Any characters doing the Noodle Dance twerk entirely throughout the segment, along with them claiming that twerking is good for them.\n\nThe characters talk to the audience constantly, especially asking them questions they already know the answers to.\n\nMayor Jeff is....well, armed and dangerous. His name is also just Jeff (if you can get the reference).\n\nThe Snootie mansion is shaped like a pile of dung, and make itself stink.\n\nInsert stock footage from movies without any signs of citation in the credits and place them in random scenes with no context whatsoever.\n\nNo good morals. Only bad ones.\n\nWriters from Caillou and The Nutshack write all episodes.\n\nHave the show run from 2013-15 on a bad video streaming site (not YouTube, Vimeo, or Dailymotion).\n\nAnimate the show in poor 80's-esque CGI by Klasky-Csupo (I know that studio is usually good, but then again, they made duds).\n\nThere are villains that win every episode.\n\nThe villains would be Dora, Caillou, Barney, and Nina (from Nina Needs to Go!).\n\nEvery 2 seconds, there is an animation error.\n\nInclude a narrator that does nothing but state the obvious.\n\nLake Hoohaw is called Loser Lake.\n\nMr. Bigdog has rabies.\n\nBabbleberries are called Bubberreez.\n\nPB&J love rotten sandwiches over PB&J sandwiches.\n\nReplace Mallard Man with Fanboy and Chum-Chum.\n\nMake the credits move so fast, that you can't read anything.\n\nMake the characters puppets, like what you'd see on Potterpuppetpals. Animate it on PowerPoint.\n\nAnd have them turn into poorly-rendered CGI characters when they're annoyed.\n\nTurn the voice acting into text to speech.\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nIn \"Babbleberry/Bubberree Day\", the Bubberreez turn out to be cherry bombs created by Bart Simpson.\n\nIn \"You Can't Come In\", the characters make a slaughterhouse that kills fish complete with bloody, disgusting scenes that wouldn't look out of place on a low-budget R-rated horror movie.\n\nIn \"Go Away Gorilla\", there is an actual gorilla which murders PB&J at the end.\n\nIn \"The Silent Treatment\", Pinch decapitates Jelly for arguing.\n\nIn \"Picture Perfect\", PB&J dress like hobos and are treated to alcohol by Davey Stone from Eight Crazy Nights.\n\nIn \"Too Hot for Fishicles\", everything on Lake Hoohaw/Loser Lake decays to dust before being eaten by feral dogs.\n\nIn \"Nothin' But the Tooth\", a Titan version of Drew Pickles destroys Lake Hoohaw/Loser Lake.\n\nIn \"Soap Box Derby Day\", PB&J train a bar of giant swearing soap.

He also throws Caillou-like tantrums in every episode.\n\nWipe Tweek from existence.\n\nThe show goes until Season 8000, meaning that it'll last until your grandkids are dead.\n\nMake it a The Get Along Gang rip-off.\n\nCartman/Barry loves vegetables over Cheesy Poofs.\n\nThe season 1 theme song is an over the top jazz song.

ONE MINUTE!\n\nAll characters are voiced by the same person.\n\nThere's a narrator who explains the obvious, similar to the narrator of Peppa Pig.\n\nA PSA is at the end of every episode.\n\nMaggie and the Ferocious Beast\n\nEvery 5 seconds, the beast scares the viewers with an ugly face or an ear-bleeding roar.\n\nThe animation is very similar to The Problem Solverz.\n\nHamilton is a Daddy Pig rip-off who slaps people, then beats them up if they call him Alexander Hamilton.\n\nHave it air on Adult Swim at 2 am.\n\nThe Beast eats Maggie and Hamilton in the last episode.\n\nMake Hamilton eat feces every five minutes, then he tells the viewers to barf like they mean it.\n\nChange the name to \"Funny Times with Maggie and Friends\"\n\nMaggie is a whiny brat.\n\nThe show is rated TV-MA-DLSV\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1987\n\nRename it to “The Leonardo Show”.\n\nMake the characters ask the audience questions.\n\nHave there be shoe-horned comedy.\n\nHanna-Barbera and Ruby Spears produce it.\n\nI know, they're sibling studios, but they'd ruin TMNT 1987.\n\nWriters known for the worst cartoons ever made write all episodes.\n\nKraang is called \"Chet\".\n\nThe Shredder and the other villains do nothing but act stupid for over a hundred episodes.\n\nFor example, the Shredder thinks Dimension X is the nickname of the local Showbiz Pizza Place, and the trans-dimensional portal is used for microwaving foods and making ice cream.\n\nMona Lisa is Raphael's love interest and girlfriend in all episodes.\n\nIt would be both good and bad.\n\nEveryone is voiced by Levi Stubbs (using the Audrey II voice), Doug Parker (using the Megaman voice), Jennifer Darling, Rob Paulsen, Seth O'Hickory (using the Mailbox voice), James Murray (using his Splinter voice), and Jennie Kwan.\n\nMake all the children seen in the show spoiled brats.\n\nAll characters named Jeff are....well, armed and dangerous.\n\nMake Irma run around all over every scene, especially in inappropriate situations.\n\nRocksteady and Bebop talk only in high-school French.\n\nThe Shredder is named \"Bob\".\n\nThe Shredder/Bob rides around in a giant can of Rainy Day Foods Alfalfa Seeds on wheels with a giant Oobi-like hand thing on it.\n\nInsert stock footage.\n\nReplace all battle scenes with stock footage of people solving problems just by eating Mentos.\n\nThe plans for attacks by the villains (and vise-versa) are easier to the point that even preschoolers can do them.\n\nThe backgrounds are full of rainbows and smiling objects in the \"Red Sky\" seasons.\n\nHave the show be EVEN MORE Lighter and Softer instead of Darker and Edgier for the \"Red Sky\" seasons.\n\nEach episode ends with the characters going to bed as 70's, 80's and 90's electronic music plays (or in the case of the \"Red Sky\" seasons a sleep-inducing lullaby).\n\nHave it cancelled after 8 seasons (meaning that \"Turtle Trek\" will be the final episode).\n\nVernon eats something every 5 to 60 seconds.\n\nSplinter wears a lampshade all the time.\n\nThe animation for all episodes resembles the episodes of Scooby Doo, Where Are You?.\n\nFill it with tons of animation errors.\n\nThe Foot Clan are just guys in three-piece suits.\n\nShredder's/Bob's legs are colored flesh instead of steel, making it look like he isn't wearing pants.\n\nNew York City is called \"Famous Ray's City\"\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nIn Turtle Trek (the finale in this version), New York City/Famous Ray's City surrenders to the Care Bears.\n\nAnd also Shredder/Bob, Kraang/Chet, and the other baddies get killed, so HA!\n\nIn The Catwoman from Channel Six, the episode is nothing more than a live-action 25-minute video clip of men in Ninja Turtle costumes babysitting a 13-year old girl in a cat costume with a \"Channel 6\" necklace while speaking in hilariously bad voices with poor visual and audio quality.\n\nIn Attack of the 50-Foot Irma, Irma stays giant and gets married to Godzilla, and somehow, Mothra gets jealous.\n\nIn The Turtle Terminator, Shredder/Bob and Kraang/Chet create a drunk skeleton instead of a android clone of Irma.\n\nCould the drunk skeleton be a distant relative of Sans (from Undertale)? I guess.\n\nIn Pizza by the Shred, Weird Pizza To Go is called \"Ray's Weird Pizzas\".\n\nDanny Phantom\n\nKaBlam!\n\nThe segments are replaced with mayo.\n\nHenry and June don't appear at all, so Ryan hosts instead.\n\nHave the show be called \"KaKaKaKaMAYO TIME!\"\n\nAll the mayo is expired.\n\nInsert awful .jpg stock images.\n\nThe last episode reveals that Ryan is Peanut Otter in disguise.\n\nBoth characters are voiced by Adam Rose (who, in my opinion, is highly underrated).\n\nGive it a spin-off halfway during the third season called \"Ryan's Fun World\", which rips off Elmo's World.\n\nHave it overuse memes that were funny back in 2009.\n\nOne word: Jumpscares\n\nMiraculous: Tales Of Ladybug And Cat Noir\n\nAll of the akumatized villains win in every single episode.\n\nAdrien gets killed off in Reflectika.\n\nEach episode contains tons of filler.\n\nA Fire PIF is at the end of each episode.\n\nReplace the Kwamis (Tikki, Plagg, Nooroo, Trixx, Duusu, Wayzz) in favor of a lame magic spell.\n\nHave an episode devoted to Marinette (as Ladybug) reading \"Everybody Poops\".\n\nIt is cancelled halfway through the airing of \"Ladybug and Cat Noir (Origins - Part One)\", and afterward the full episode is leaked onto the internet.\n\nThe animation is done in the style of Grojband and The Gigglebellies.\n\nLitter it with memes that were funny back in 2015.\n\nEvery 10 seconds a character twitches, sneezes, coughs or picks his/her nose.\n\nIt airs on Cartoon Network multiple times a day.\n\nMake it in early 2016 and let it run for only one season.\n\nMake Adrien a conservative Christian nutjob who's catchphrase is \"Screw the Beatles and praise Jesus!\"\n\nMarinette's catchphrase is \"I might have gone in too many places!\"\n\nChloe isn't a snob, but rather a prissy 16 year old girl from Los Angeles who is obsessed with Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Scream Queens.\n\nReplace Hawk Moth with an exceptionally skinny person that dresses like a bald eagle named \"Angry Eagle\".\n\nSuperNoobs (this section is long as shit I'm sorry)\n\nMake it a spinoff of Johnny Test.\n\nJust kidding!

Hey, it's like Johnny Test!\n\nThe show has little regards to continuity, and forgets about plot points (like the supernatural pyramids from season two) as soon as they're brought up.\n\nKevin carries around a whistle and he blows it every time Tyler speaks.\n\nThroughout the show, Shope is referred to with both her first and last name, sorta like how everyone refers to the titular character of Angela Anaconda with both her first and last name.\n\nAll the audio is recorded using a webcam.\n\nEveryone has Kevin's personality.\n\nEach episode has at least one musical number, and they're all laced with profanity and homophobic content.\n\nThe animation for all episodes resembles a mixture of post-season 2 Johnny Test animation and Wishfart, especially the latter.\n\nHave Tyler wear a paper cup with the Scooby Doo characters on it, but Shaggy's eyes are scratched out.\n\nThere are forced educational aesops at the end of each episode.\n\nAll the female characters are voiced by either Sarah Natochenny (using her Vera voice) or Bryn McAuley, and the male characters are all voiced by either Guido Quaroni (the voice of our favorite shit-eating forklift) or Mac Heywood.\n\nThe only jokes involve way-too-cruel slapstick, cutaway gags that come out of nowhere a la Family Guy, excessive breaking of the fourth wall and toilet humor.\n\nAll the characters have bad catchphrases.\n\nTyler's catchphrase is \"Korean OMG!\" and \"GET ME KEVIN ON THE PHONE!\"\n\nKevin's catchphrases are \"When in doubt, whip it good!\" and \"I'M TOO HOT FOR YOU!\"\n\nShope's catchphrases are \"Woah! High-impact sexual violence!\" and \"That doesn't fucking scare me!\"\n\nRoach's catchphrase is \"Blame it on the rain!\" and \"Chicken fetus!\"\n\nStingy from Lazytown is a supporting character, and his catchphrase is \"It's mine, binch!\"\n\nCool Cat from Cool Cat Saves the Kids is also a supporting character and he appears in live action, green-screened onto the scenes he appears in as a framing device a la Shining Time Station. His live-action scenes are filmed with a Super-8 video camera.\n\nPictures of Yelena from Welcome to the Wayne are flashed onscreen to hypnotize viewers into worshiping her.\n\nKevin wears a lampshade all the time.\n\nThe Shopkins make time to time cameos.\n\nBONUS: The Madballs also make cameos, only making gross jokes about whatever situation the Noobs are in.\n\nThe cast of Wishfart makes time to time cameos.\n\nHave Amy be a stereotypical emo/scene girl who beats up people for fun.

This episode starts off with Kevin reading complaints from viewers of the show about despite being aimed at kids aged 12 and under, it contains racism, sexual references and homophobic messages. In response, Kevin and his friends do a hypothetical Bowderlized episode of their show to explain that their show would not be as good as it is if it was legitimately aimed at children with the help of the cast of Detention. In the Bowderlized episode, all the inappropiate content is removed in a similar way to how Pooh's Adventures is censored, and Tyler is replaced with Sans Undertale from Undertale. The episode ends with Kevin and Shope singing \"Hotel Room Service\" by Pitbull.\n\nIn the end, the whole episode is revealed to be an absinthe and acid-induced dream of Kevin's.\n\nThe characters don't move their mouths when speaking. Instead, they move their heads or arms slightly (Think My Little Pony Newborn Cuties)\n\nThe budget is very low, and we're talking Paddy The Pelican levels of low.\n\nThe series is made to be a huge cash cow and solely exists to sponsor companies like Microsoft, Disney, Dawn Dish Soap, McDonald's and Wendy's.\n\nTyler has a fetish for belly growls, luckily (at least in Tyler's case), If Roach happens to eat something, this will happen to him, and it will lead to him vomiting everywhere.\n\nMake Kevin racist and homophobic.

It also reveals that Tyler is her brother; Kevin is their older cousin that is a high ranking member of a street gang, Roach is actually Kevin's pet dog but humanized, and Mem and Zen are Tyler and Shope's gay dads.\n\nIF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SECOND VERSION ON HOW TO RUIN SUPERNOOBS, GO TO How To Make Good TV Shows Bad/Supernoobs version 2\n\nHow to ruin the episodes!\n\nSeason 1\n\nA Noob Hope:\n\nMake it a poorly made live action pilot where the Noobs destroy their school and get arrested.
