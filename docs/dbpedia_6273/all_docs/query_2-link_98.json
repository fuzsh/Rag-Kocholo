A proof will then be emailed for review but placed on hold until payment is received.\n\nMemory.\n\nIt’s one of the most frequent and common concerns of the ageing population. If I can’t remember a name, why was I able to pull a 40-year-old item from my brain files?\n\nTo better recall a particular experience, I said to myself (as always), I need to get into the Wayback Machine.\n\nDid I lose you, or are you with me?\n\nFlashback: Wayback came from the clever and extremely offbeat “Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,” which ran from 1959 to 1964.\n\nFeatured were the main characters, plus others like Snidely Whiplash, and the pair of spies, Natasha Fatale and Boris Badenov.\n\nThink Cold War.\n\nWayback was the invention of Dr. Peabody, a genius scientist, as well as a Beagle. Peabody created the machine to take “pet son” Sherman to a\n\ntime and place of historical importance, like the Charge of the Light Brigade.\n\nAnything without electricity? No thanks.\n\nBy choosing time travel in popular culture as my topic, I quickly landed in familiar territory of being in over my head. Onto the research.\n\nIt wouldn’t be surprising to simply settle on “Back to the Future” as the benchmark, at least for our generation. But we’d be so wrong.\n\nThe first mention of time travel is said to have been a Hindu Epic around 400 B.C. There was also a reference of the theme in French literature during the 1600s.\n\nDon’t confuse time travel fiction with prophetic works by seers, arguably the most famous of which is Nostradamous.\n\nThose writers foretold, or guessed, the future, but didn’t really go there. Or did they?\n\nEven through brief research, I found that time travel captured the imagination of writers across centuries. In some cases, the traveling device was magic, or at least mysterious.\n\nIn Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” 1843, Ebenezer Scrooge traveled via ghosts.\n\nH.G. Wells was among the first to bring mechanisms to life in 1895 with “The Time Machine.”\n\nLiterature is filled with time travelers, for good and evil. The young adult book, a Newberry Medal winner, “A Wrinkle in Time,” 1962, features a\n\ncosmic sliver to enter the fifth dimension.\n\nLook for wormholes, magic formulas — aka drugs — and strange talismans to make the trip.\n\nReaders always bring their own interpretation and visualization to a story. In time travel, the who, what and where was theirs to create.\n\nAs of the 20th century, new movies and adaptations, then television and other entertainment media, showed the impossible to be possible.\n\nThe 1902 French film, “A Trip to the Moon,” is cited as the first of of its genre. Inspiration was a novel by Jules Verne, another science fiction genius.\n\nIt includes one of the most well-known moving picture images of a spaceship landing in the moon’s eye.\n\nFrom then on, it was anything goes.\n\nThe perpetual Star-Trek series moved backwards, forwards and sideways around the galaxy.\n\nCurrently, the popular TV saga “Outlander,” based on a novel series, controls the calendar.\n\nIn this case, a World War II nurse “finds herself transported to 1743.” PTSD?\n\nThe website imdb.com lists 50 all-time best time travel films.\n\nOne of the loveliest was 1980’s “Somewhere in Time.” My favorite is Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris,” with its beautiful setting and inventive plot.\n\nWe appreciate the fantasy and are willing to suspend belief, but with some guidelines.\n\nBackwards seems to dominate plots, perhaps because we knew and liked it. One is warned, however, we cannot change the past.\n\nI close with a question: If Philadelphia International Airport became Philadelphia PAPTA (Pick-a-Place and Time) Airport, where would you go,\n\nand what time period would you choose?\n\nWill you stick to yesteryear, or is anyone willing to take a chance on the future?\n\nSusan L. Serbin’s Talkin’ ‘Bout My Generation appears every other week."
