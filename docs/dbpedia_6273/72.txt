Film Description: The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends is the blanket title for an American animated television series that originally aired from November 19, 1959, to June 27, 1964, on the ABC and NBC television networks. Produced by Jay Ward Productions, the series is structured as a variety show, with the main feature being the serialized adventures of the two title characters, the anthropomorphic flying squirrel Rocky and moose Bullwinkle.

The main enemies in most of their adventures are the two Russian-accented and utterly incompetent spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, both working for the dictator “Fearless Leader.” The clip to the left depicts one of the attempts by Boris and Natasha to take advantage of the show’s hapless heroes. In this specific instance, Boris and Natasha wish to steal Bullwinkle’s mattress full of money. Cartoons such as this were important in fostering impressions that anyone with a Russian accent was “bad.”
